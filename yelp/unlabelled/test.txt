Don't waste your time.  We had two different people come to our house to give us estimates for a deck (one of them the OWNER).  Both times, we never heard from them.  Not a call, not the estimate, nothing.
Wast there last Friday. Seats right in front if the stage. The show was good. The headliner, while a bit long, was good. Fantastic service from our waitresses. Will definitely go back.
Great Barnes and Noble location, and they have plenty of books that'll help you pass the time.
Good. One of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh. Went yesterday with family and enjoyed oysters(very fresh). I always like appetizers more than their entrees
This place is amazing!!! Jim is a great artist!!! Traveled all the way from Tampa just to get my tattoo!!! I would recommend this place to everyone!!!
This cafe's espresso drinks are on par with the best artisinal coffee houses anywhere.  I always go out of my way to get coffee from here when I'm in Pittsburgh.
Wings are overpriced. And the quality of them are bad. They were tough and greasy. The staff are pleasant but then over all experience was too expensive for a sports bar.
The decor is nothing fancy but the food is surprisingly good (and fresh). I've gotten takeout and eaten at the buffet. Both good for the price - it's inexpensive.
right by my house, spicy peanut and cheesy snake are amazing.
Love this place! The decor inside is really cool.\n\nI'm not from the area but I try to stop in every time I'm traveling through. So many great veg options and great drinks.
Our favorite place to go for chocolate peanut butter soy milkshakes. We've been for breakfast, lunch, and dinner and everything we've gotten has been incredibly delicious. Love this place!
Refused to take my cat, which had passed away, for cremation cause I had not been to the clinic previously. IMHO that's ridiculous. I will not recommended anyone to ever come here.
The products and service are great, but the prices are outrageous!\n\nI am on a vegan diet and have found this co-op really helpful. If you can get past the prices, the selection is great!
For 30 bucks a month, this is a pretty rad spot. I've climbed all over the US and Canada, but I'm happy to call this my home gym.
Service was okay, at best. I wouldn't go there again.  They quoted me at thousands of dollars of repairs for my car to pass inspection.  I took it somewhere else and had it done for a fraction of the quote.
Maybe I went on a bad night, but the service was stunningly bad.  Water glasses stayed empty for almost 15 minutes!  Ordered 5 dishes, all pretty average.  The tab:  $300+.  I won't be back.
I am a big fan of Max;;s for their local flair, real German food, and authentic Pittsburgh feeling. They did not sell out, are not overly commercialized, and should be supported for the long standing quality service to the city. Thanks, Max's.
still the best (and for me, the only) professional football team in the world...
This conservative POS rag makes faux news look like NPR. You got Scaife, himself pumping ten million a year from his own pocket to keep the paper up and running. No one reads it, the Post Gazette is the REAL newspaper in this city.
Nick's used to be good with the previous owner, that all changed. Which is pretty sad.
Nick's has legit New York Style pizza.  It's dirt cheap too!
People and company make mistakes. \nThe owner personally took responsibility for the mistake and fixed the problem. \n\nThis shows they care about their customers and value the business!!
Tasty
Another ugly haircut like everywhere in Pittsburgh. For $60 with the owner. Trusted the reviews, but now look like a Pittsburgh redneck. No hair on the sides and long on the back!
Had lunch with my wife. The quality of the sushi was quite good. My wife had some tempura that was fabulous. Service was friendly and quick. We really enjoyed our lunch. We will be back.
Excellent and made from scratch !!!!
This was just bad pizza.  For the money I expect that the toppings will be cooked on the pizza.  The cheese and pepparoni were added after the crust came out.  Also the mushrooms were out of a can.  Do not waste money here.
Terrible place to eat and not very clean at all. Way over priced foe fast food. 5$ for a plain roast beef forget that!
Sadly really went downhill. They switched to a new vendor, the prices went up and they are no longer having sales.
The pizza is great. Other food items might disappoint. They do deliver! Service is hit and miss. There is one rude,  smile-less bartender... I have actually seen him through the window and decided to go somewhere else because I was in the mood for good service.
What a place. What a selection.  I love it.  \n\nThis place allows you to view hundreds of beers from around the world.  You can buy mixed six packs as well. \n\nThe food is great and service is just fine.
Grabbed a couple of dozen bagels and took to work.  Man they don't last long.  Bagels are good and the service is friendly.  They were real busy but make time to chat will working.
Awful!!!\nNever EVER follows schedule! Lets you wait for literally over an hour on a bus that is supposed to be running every 15 min.
There was basically no cheese on my \"cheese combo sandwich\", the fries were gross, and the waitress was nasty to us.
Bread, slaw, tomato, fries, and a small piece of overcooked fish all piled together. Warm yiengling and mediocre service.   Aweful
I love this place. I eat here anytime I go downtown for anything. Always get the Gyro with extra meat and sauce. So amazing. YUM!
Not the best ever, but pretty decent stuff.  A slice for $2.50 in downtown? I'll be back.
Ewww, the food here is terrible.  Nothing I had tasted good.  It tasted like it had been sitting under the food warmers for hours.  The service is luke warm at best.  Just skip it.  There's so many other places out there for good italian food.
Wonderful experience!
i have been getting my hair cut here for 15 years.  Marjorie is amazing and priceless.  I am as picky about my hairstylist as i am my dentist or doctor.  I travel extensively for work and get compliments no matter where i travel.  Wouldn't go anywhere else!
I have seen a lot of shows here.  It's really nice and brings some amazing productions to the city.  \n\n(and I also saw the Great Gatsby ballet that another commenter mentioned!)
This is the worst Chinese food I've had. Ever. And Pittsburgh has some pretty bad Chinese places.  The Golden Palace buffet is bad, but at least edible.  I am utterly baffled at how this place stays in business.
Pre-fab fried food. Decor has character. The beer is cheap.
Awesome chowder but that's it...
Update - went back another time and the pizza was mediocre at best.  So disappointing, we loved it the first time!  My guess is that if you get pizza right out of the oven you're good to go - otherwise, you're SOL.
I am in town for work and I decided to order food from here. The food was awesome! I ordered the People's Special Biryani and they brought the food right to my hotel room. I will definitely order from here again the next time I'm in town.
5:30pm, worst Baingan Bartha I've ever had. Un-fresh and damn near flavorless all but for some powdery heat. Please invest in fresh chillies; they keep well and will make that \"8\" really pop with flavor.
Pho is good but its not best pho or egg rolls (they don't even serve it with the lettuce and herbs) you can get in Pittsburgh. On the flip side though, their owner is super friendly
I am from Houston, since I came here I've been searching for the perfect bowl of pho. I have to say this is the closest thing yet from home!!! Good pho with fair pricing, doesn't get ebtter than this.
Flies in this place.
Yes the pizza is the best in the burgh.  But don't don't forget the wings.  They also have the best wings in the burgh.  They don't deliver.  They don't have to.  I'd drive for miles.
Other than being open late to convenience myself and my inebriated friends I didn't like nor dislike this place. It was quite small and looked dirty. The pizza was large enough to share between me and 5 people and to absorb some alcohol. \nIt wasn't horrible.
The sales team worked with me to trade a car that needed work and put me into the car I always wanted for a price I could afford.  Talk to Jeff and Dom they are Awesome!
Not quite as good as the Squirrel Hill location, but quick service. Would recommend the Sicilian Pizza over the usual style.
Not a huge fan of their coffee, the cookies and pastries are really good, however! The lemonade is amazing. The lady who works their, is super rude and never smiles. The customer almost feels like they are bothering the workers.
Cute place with a delicious cap! Perfectly proportionate.
Excellent food. They did a great job with the renovation- the place is swank!
Not my cup of tea. I did not like my tuna entree, despite it being somewhere around $35. \n\nI do enjoy their cocktails, and like to come to the bar for happy hour.
Consistently outstanding and creative food served professionally in a great and even varied ambiance. What more could you ask for? Oh yes, excellent wine list and drinks.
Best sushi in Pittsburgh. Small restaurant so definitely make reservations and try the omakase. Like the tatami mat seating as well.
Two Words: Frozen Cosmos\n\nYou need no other motivation to go to Harris' (although, the food and service is good too)
Very good short rib tacos. Long wait for food though.
I do admit the clothes here are not exactly at the quality that I want, but if you do stop by frequently you can spot some really nice items. And the guy who works there is super nice so make sure you get to know him! He can help you a lot.
Their appetizers are very very good... I also like their daily menu, fresh stuff and high quality ingredients. The salad that comes with any entree is awesome! Overall, excellent. I go there regularly. It usually gets very crowded though, so plan ahead.
Great hotcakes. No so great wait.  The hotcakes are worth trying, but there are other places in Pittsburgh that have much shorter waits that I prefer.
Nice cozy underground restaurant that serves crepes and a great Cafe au lait.  They have plenty of sweet crepes and a few savory ones.  They could add a couple more savory ones, but otherwise I would definitely eat there again.
Cash only. We love their Crepes. I don't like latta that much. It is good experience.
Cash only. Cute place, good crepes, good coffee.
I love their vegan / vegetarian menu! The food is so good! Just remember to ask them to hold the MSG! \n\nFriendly service. Clean. Nice atmosphere.
The owner stole a bracelet brought in for repairs and has lied over and over about returning it.
Always had great food, Try the clam chowder!!!
I love New China. The service is always fast and fresh! The sweet tea is amazing. Yes, Chinese takeout is everywhere but no one can Beat NEW China in Belmont!
They do take out and delivery! The pizza is tastier than most delivery places. The 10\" is a good size for an individual pizza. The staff was a lot of fun to chat with and answered any questions we had. We will definitely be getting food from them again.
Very good classic New York pizza. I would highly recommend it. If you want to get the best pizza possible make sure you order light sauce. They tend to over do the sauce sometimes but overall great pizza place.
I am a fan of the beer selection, and beer selection only- they have a great mix of really good German beer and seem to rotate it seasonally. As for the food, it's not fair for me to comment- I just don't care for German cuisine.
Closed, and has been for a long time now.  Last visit garnered a first bucket of stale peanuts which the waitress knew we were going to say yet served them anyway before providing more.  An average steakhouse.
I used to be in the industry and I know what my car does and does not need.  They couldn't seem to get that, and kept trying to sell me crap.  Over-priced, slow, very dirty, and an overall sketchy vibe.
First class everything,  service incredible. Great hidden gem in the heart of Charlotte.  I recommend staying.
Authentic Irish feel with a friendly staff and warm atmosphere. Expected selection of draft beers for an Irish Pub. Good selection of bottled beers.
Lights too low, music too loud, not many people inside, drinks too expensive. Plus it costs 5$ just to get in. Def not worth it. Try some where else!
not thrilling, not disappointing.  RB is average across the board.  Try the Hazelnut Crusted Chicken.
one extra star because they are consistent, well priced and chicken tempura and chicken teriyaki are tastey. this is my go to spot when i want something cheap and \"asian\"
Ok but not fabulous-decor in room was bland.  Quiet with all the things a business traveler could want including business center where you can print out your boarding pass for free.  Great view of uptown and very comfortable beds.
A few of us went here for lunch on a Friday and while the food was very good the service was very slow and inattentive.   \n\nI had the Blue Petit Mignon and the portion size was just right for lunch.
I've eaten at Merts a few times and even received a free birthday meal which included a drink. Very impressed. My favorite dishes are the salmon cakes and the rice and beans with turkey sausage but that dish tends to be too salty at times. Overall, nice place to eat.
I liked the atmosphere but the food was WAY too salty.  Just didn't care for it.
Had dinner last night here. The food left a lot to be desired. Reputation aside the salmon cakes had no seasoning and the ribeye was tough. Really disappointing. I've been here before when I come to Charlotte and had better food. Hopefully, this was a one-off.
Only went there during happy hour. There was a great drink selection, but it was so crowded the service was not great.
I had a great meal with friends had drinks they had all we wanted! The staff was great not rude like the kings kitchen the food was great! thank you so very much! I shall keep coming back! Come here leave the kings kitchen food is great looks great staff out of this world!
The steak was cooked to perfection  .  Staff  is very friendly. Nice place to hang out.
Great Turkey Grinder!
Drink prices are high but the dancing is fun!
this place is fun because it is on the light rail line.   things here do tend to be expensive, but i will say the sushi is yummy and normally priced.  the tizerts cakes are so delish i would eat them until i died.
Don't eat anything but the chicken. Everything else is nasty. Charlotte should be a BBQ mecca, it isn't because of the chains. Go back to Florida, they like it there.
Ride the Intimidator. Some say to visit the great wall of China before you die...I say tide the Intimidator.
Small park, over priced food, we paid $55 for 3 slices of pizza , 2 orders of chicken wings that were the smallest flavorless wings we have ever had, and 2 beers.....never again....pack food
This ymca is very large.  It has 4 floors to exercise.  Like 10 racket ball rooms.  Towel and rags are ease of access to shower and etc.  The downside is that most hours of the day it is crowded because it is located downtown.
Solid sake menu and the staff was helpful in deciding which one to go with. Sushi rolls had an interesting spin but nothing out of the ordinary.
Food was terrible service was ok. We were told it would be a 30-45 minute wait and it turned into an hour and a half wait. Totally not worth it.
One of my favorites.  The food and service are always excellent.   Whatever you have, ending with the bread pudding (not listed on the menu) and the tiramisu are a must!!!!
Horrible customer service. Unless you are into horror movies or The Simpsons the people working the counter can't give you a honest review. However they will make fun of your movie selections and treat you like crap. Can't wait to go back!!
I've been going to the Visulite since it opened.  It's my favorite live music venue in Charlotte.  So many great bands have hit this stage.  Most of the staff have worked here since the beginning.  Great atmosphere.  Many wonderful memories!
Best sushi I have had in Charlotte!
Delicious, good service, one of our favorites places to eat.\n\nHighly recommend the sesame tofu - it is some of the best tofu I've ever had at a restaurant.
They serve THE BEST roti canai!! MUST EAT!! Highly recommendeddddddddddddddddddddddddd!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I have ordered hot subs and for some reason they don't understand that not everyone wants white american. I gave them two chances and they haven't gotten it right yet! I will go to Sub Station across the street from now on!
My man does it again.  Have taken 5 jackets to him now to tailor.  He has advised me on brands to buy that fit my build, told me to pass on tailoring pieces that will never fit me correctly, and repeatedly deliver quality work.  Highly recommend.
One oft favorite joints in Charlotte. Between the jazz band, etoufee, and shrimp& grits this place takes the cake.
What a pleasant surprise!! The fried oysters are the best ever and so is the Diane! I had it with the crawfish and shrimp. Even the garden salad was good to be pretty simple! Definitely a great value! My family and I will be returning:)
The have some of the best ribs and rib tips in Charlotte. Tea and lemonade made fresh.
All I have to say is Hayley is very talented. I had a great experience here, you may need to be patient. I took me about 3 months to get in to see her, but was well worth the wait.
Wonderful food and shopping available, but why does the restroom have a valet in it taking tips?  This isn't a European nightclub.
I was at this airport for a few mins as I connected. Would have liked to enjoy my supposedly one hour layover but my previous flight at LAX was delayed for no reason.
@ Charlotte and ready for boarding!!
Basically the totally opposite of Newark Liberty Airport.\n\nClean and well-lit. Friendly and courteous TSA members, and fast and efficient layout and service.
Huge airport.  Clean and lots of shopping.
One of the best US Airways hub airports.
They are in the middle of revamping the parking near the terminals.  Easy peasy airport.  The food options are lacking, but I imagine they will fix that eventually.  How about some of that well known NC BBQ in the terminals??
Decent airport, but it is always a mass of humanity.  Be sure to stay in your seat if you get one, because you will lose it.
It's an airport, small but had what it needed. Planes.
Standard place that grew fast and has lots of spider webs.
I have never been to an airport before where I would want to come back and just hang out. Get my nails done? Check! Superb southern food? Check! Legit shopping? Check and check!
Went there 6 in the morning. It's just like any McDonald's, you should know what they serve. The staff is very friendly and helpful.
I can't anymore. It's too busy here and service is not as fast as other Mickey D's with this kind of volume. Customers are rude too.
Not too good and not that much flavor for what chicken can have.  The sauce is nothing special and as one reviewer said, the neighborhood is suspect.  Service was good and I liked the potato salad.  Baked beans were from the can.  Drive up was good and service was super fast.
This place is as bland as they get. The food was mediocre and the atmosphere was too.
I gave up on Monterrey several yrs ago but was in the neighborhood today. I felt like Mexican for lunch. Clean, great service and the food was very good. One of the best quesadillas I've had. And the Dos Equis draft wasn't bad either!
I visit often.  Love the white salsa, great food, good prices.
It seems a rarity to find a Japanese restaurant owned and operated by Japanese. Well Musashi is one such place. The menu is not the Americanized and that is worth three stars alone. Good authentic menu, service and food!
After having a bad experience and informing the management, Dean and Deluca went above and beyond in improving my perception of the market.  Way to go!
This has always been awesome place on my list of places to shop or have a sandwich went recently and had a fantastic lunch.
Delicious Chinese food!  I had the Trio of shrimp, scallops & chicken and all food was very fresh and wasn't salty like other Chinese restaurants.  The servers were very  polite and this was a wonderful experience and will definitely go back!
Wish it had been better when I made my one and only trip.  The menu was smallish and nothing quite appealed to me.  But I know others have enjoyed it very much, maybe I am an exception.  I like the wine suggestion it was top notch.  Staff was efficient and friendly.
A very ratchet place with a very ratchet staff.
I always come here after playing a round of Par 3 golf next door.  How can you go wrong with hundreds of beers, pretty girls and descent bar food?  You can't!  Cool spot - check it out!
Good food and drinks before going to a concert at the verizon wireless amphitheatre up the street. ~Cheers
Friendliest employees ever, and those hamburgers are fantastic!  Food quality is what I'd expect at a good sit-down restaurant.
Visiting friends in NC and we stopped here for breakfast. At first our order was take out but then we decided to eat in. They got out order wrong but was friendly in fixing the error. The food was okay for the items that we got.
Great specials averaging around $7.  The portions are extra large.  Large seating area.  This is your typical quick Japanese style stir fry.  Teriyaki and Hibachi stuff!   One thing that sucks - No egg rolls!  WTF?
Awful awful awful!!!!  I have never experienced such RUDE nurses or doctor in my life. I will never go back here again. I'm not sure how they have received positive reviews.
session key
this place never disappoints me. Tough to get in, reservations are a must but always delicious.
Casual dinner with members tonight and food was great! Service was inexperienced.  Always love the location and people!
The atmosphere here is comfortable and attractive.  The service is above average.  The lunch specials are quite appealing, and the food itself is pretty tasty.
I haven't been back here in years. The food is mediocre at best. Head to Monterrey's.
Restaurant is closed.
I liked it bc of the coupons but it is now closed they informed me by email.
Good subs and cheesesteaks. Slammed at lunch. Clean. Plentiful parking.
Just went for sushi. Superman roll was good. Overall I would prefer Pisces or Ru Sans, but this place was nearby and it did the job. Service was also good although it wasn't busy at the time.
Terrible. Ugly d\u00e9cor, bad food, poor service.
The worst Macaroni Grill I've ever been to!  Do not waste your time!!!
Probably the driest and most tasteless chicken salad I've had in a long time. Our other sandwiches were just as disappointing. Just another chain food restaurant. I long for a real deli in Charlotte!
I don't even have the words!  Don't even have an app to order if you send an update that the food is out for delivery but I have to call every 20 min wondering where it is
This has been a great experience for my kids. Sean and his staff are amazing. Can't say enough about his teaching and ability to relate to younger kids.
I made it to the top- that's all that matters!\n\nLove this place.
I was down in Charlotte on business for five days and I ate here four of those days for lunch.  NEED I SAY MORE?
Great lunch spot. To repeat other reviews, the service is fast; probably the quickest I have ever experienced. As with most other locations I have visited, the staff is genuine and friendly.
Two words.  Dirty and nasty. Better off driving 3 miles to the Steele creek McDonalds!
Location is perfect view to the lake but services pretty slow, food average a place to get a beer and see the lake ......
Great little place just across the border.  Food is always great as well as service.
Food was very good. I had the Reuben sandwich. My only suggestion is that the waitress should check back more often to see if we need anything. Otherwise, I recommend it.
Ate here once with a buy one, get one coupon. I won't be heading back. Go to Los Gemelos off of State St instead.
As always excellent, locally sourced food.
We tried to order for delivery because we are 4 miles away. On their menu it says $15 minimum. We called to place the order and we were told today it's a $75 minimum. We found that insane so never ordered.
if you're looking for a nice night out, keep looking...
First we waited 20 minutes which was ok with us but then we waited 45 minutes for our two items to show up that too incomplete. As one of the reviewers mentioned the breakfast was very oily. Taste was just ok. Won't be going back.
Go soft and juicy burgers!  I dream and crave these burgers.  Basic cheese burger with pickles and they special mustard.
Delicious pork sandwich with coleslaw and very attentive service at modest prices in a rustic atmosphere
Great food, portions could be smaller. A little pricey for Middleton. Would try somewhere else next time but would also not hesitate to return.
The wait staff were non-existent, the food was atrocious, the mixed drinks weren't drinkable, and the atmosphere was filthy. What more can I say? Ick.
Wow.  What a bunch of stoners.
I love the root beer ! Service and atmosphere was cafeteria-like, food was average. Chicken strips and cheese curds were good.
Love everything about this place! My family has been ordering carry out from here for at least 10 years. It's the best Chinese on this side of town. The lo mein rocks!
Corp store on Lien rd was not a good choice.  The manager of the store was very unhelpful and gave me the run around about trying to fix my phone. If you want good service with people who actually care, go to the store on University Ave
terrible selection of shoes and jeans, and the changing rooms smell like a red line el stop. if you absolutely must visit a department store, drive a few miles and hit up macy's instead.
Worst security at any venue I have ever experienced and way overpriced drinks. $9 for a double? Fuck that noise. Security goes through literally all of your stuff at the door, I've been through airports with hassle.
Grade: C\n\nChain food. Okay service. I can't explain why I don't hate this place.
It's a national chain so you pretty much get what you'd expect. I have never had problems with the service and the food is always good.
Too institutional.  Out of a can, bag, box, or freezer.  Parking is very limited.  Not a fan.
Neighborhood delivery and takeout great....certainly a step higher than the other chains in this level.\nThey don't biast 30
Friendly staff and quick service but, unfortunately they couldn't make up for the unappetizing dining room and BLAND food.  I'll  be shopping around for another Chinese place.
Yucky greasy food.
Sweet potato hash is fantastic!  The tofu scramble has a bit of a spicy kick and is a great option for vegans.  In fact, their veg dishes are just plain good. Service is very friendly and their cheesecake is very creamy and delicious.
Slightly lower than average Hampton Inn.  Heat/AC wasn't updated, pretty typical besides that.
I love the Ohio.  It's the kind of hellhole where you can watch a prostitute sing \"like a virgin\" on karaoke night, and see old dudes in satin jackets with bar logos on them get in fights.\n\nClassy.
N E W   S E A T S !!!!  The old bench were terrible and kept us away.  We spent two games this year and we are hooked.
Really beautiful place. Must go see - herb garden - TOUCH N FEEL was really good. Otherwise really big place and definitely can cater to an event. Thai Garden was also good.
Pretty impressive landscaping, floral and fauna display. Free admission, but I suggest spending the extra $2 and visit the conservatory whi check has butterflies and a few birds.
DO NOT EAT HERE.  They changed my tip and charged me $28 for lunch.  Absolutely ridiculous.
I read the new ass't governor gave a speech there invoking God.  Please, spare me, now I will pass.\n\nPlease save that shit for church.  The rest of us will pass on this crap.
Poor service by the wait staff is my biggest complaint. We were there at 5:00 (and it wasn't busy yet), and it took probably 15 minutes to place our order. \n\nFinally, $16.95 for a fish fry. Yowzers!
Grade: D\n\nYeah, I order my martinis served on the rocks and in goblets... Duh.
The Korean tacos are not half bad, and the kid really likes the burgers.
Best BBQ in Madison.  Hands down.  Only loses a star for consistently messing up take-out orders and not being up to par compared to places in the south.
The ribs, you must try them! My major mistake was getting a 1/3 slab.
Worst service ever.  No one cares, was lied to, wasted my time, twice and ended up demanding a refund and taking business elsewhere.  NEVER AGAIN.
You will never go away hungry...and your wallet will not be much lighter.  Good food, good prices and wonderful staff.
This location used to be an absolute hole.  They recently renovated both the interior and the exterior, and now it's a very pleasant, good-looking store.\n\nHowever, it's still Wendy's food.  And that's only okay.
Sloooooowwwwwwwww. Couldn't believe how long it took to be served below mediocre food.
Typical burger and beer place.  Food is pretty good.  Service was great!
The best fast food I know of. Maybe Chipotle, as well. Staff is always friendly. I'm not from here but this place is very Wisconsin-y to me, in a food way.\n\nGood chili.
Mediocre sushi, that is priced above what it should be at.
Great bread!  But I wish the sandwiches were a little bigger.  I got the wheat sub roll with meal deal and it disappeared too quickly...left me hungry!  I guess I'll try the french bread next time.  Maybe it's a little bigger.
MTD is a great way to get to class when the weather is nasty.  However, the buses are often late, so be sure to choose a bus that arrives to your destination a few minutes early.  At least the MTD buses are free to students.
Can't go wrong with Brothers. Large airy bar that seems to be a great place to catch a game. Not as good as the Iowa location, but worth checking out.
generally okay place, a little overpriced for the settings:(  noisy and place is too small, not looking very neat... food portion is below average. maybe not again.
Boo notes and quotes for raising prices tenfold just b/c they were making illegal copies. No one should pay $150 for 100 pages of paper.
Called from marketplace mall area... When i told the girl on the phone, she said that I was serviced by a different location and that they were closed.  Then she hung up on me without as much as a goodbye.  Wow... No effort to satisfy a customer at all.
I really love chinese food but this place was absolutely horrible. I tried two dishes but both of them tasted real bad and smelled weird as well. Never go here. They have the worst food in entire Urbana-Champaign area.
Went with a friend and got a Bento box (Salmon teriyaki).  Food was good, but the place is a bit far from campus.  I'm not a fan of Miso soup, but the rest of my meal was good.
I got Sam's French Toast with a side of eggs and the eggs were fine but the french toast mostly tasted of everything else that was on the grill. I think if there were separate grills for meat vs other items it would've been better. Friendly service though.
Very good soup and fish dishes.
Daily special number 1 is the way to go! It comes with half a mackerel, and a decent bowl of tofu soup. The mackerel can be dry at times though. The kimchi jjigae has a large portion and tastes good too.
We try and go there for the best fish sandwich in town ! Be sure and order the beer batter onion rings also. A quaint Illini sports bar with a nice atmosphere and  easy access. A pay parking lot is right next door.
Ok beer selection, ok bar food (though I am a bit of a beer/food snob).  I don't mind going when a group wants to go, but not my first choice if I'm out on my own.
This guy really knows what he is doing.  I always feel better when I leave!
Nice mall great stores and food court but they need more seating for people.
Great atmosphere, delicious coffee, awesome food. This is my default stop for coffee or a place to spend the afternoon. It can get a little crowded at times though.\n\nThe Thai Tempeh sandwhich is amazing, also try the cold brew coffee sometime.
Wanted Thai while on Champaign for work. Tried this place and it was good but very small portions. So much so that I had to get taco bell fourth meal 3 hours later.
I've had good luck selling stuff here, but none when it comes to buying things. I just feel like everything here is either tacky, terribly made, or just an old trend. I definitely have better luck at TJ Maxx for sure.
This place is only good for picking up dumb underage girls.  Not worth it.
Excellent pizza (full disclosure: I was a cook here) and decent beer selection. The pool tables make it difficult to socialize at time,  the bar space is too long and not wide enough. However, if you like pool, these are very good tables.
worth the half off tues. guys... real cheese in those shakers. nuff said.
I am from Dallas and in Champaign for business.  I looked at Yelp for suggestions on good places to eat and Bacaro seemed to be the place to go.  I thought it was great.  Unique tasty dishes!
By far our favorite spot we've eaten at so far in Champaign. Our server was a little strange - definitely new to the job - but the food was excellent and the service was completely reasonable. Very large beer selection as well. Highly recommend - we'll be back!!
Amazing frozen custard. I like to stick to the basics -- vanilla or chocolate on a waffle cone. The stuff is just great.
simply fantastic, been here 4 days straight since they opened, the lemon custard is amazing in their banana splits. i would go EVERY DAY.
Seasonal place that is always a favorite. A bit off campus but worth the drive.\n\nTake your friends here when it's hot and you'll be guaranteed thanks all night.
Who doesn't love lemon custard?  So refreshing!  And really great in a lemon chiffon snowstorm.  The only negative is the long lines - but still worth it!
Pizza is great if you enjoy thin crust. Other menu items are good as well.  The service consistently sucks!  It's horrible!  Every time, service is absolutely horrendous. Proceed with caution.
The pizza wasn't horrible,  but the deal was awful.  The prices are extremely high at Dominos in general,  and their medium 2 topping is a rip off.  Low rating is for price vs.  Quality,  and value.
The food here is absolutely delicious! I would highly recommend their thai green curry (has a nice spicy kick to it), and the pad thai is worth a try as well. Unfortunately, the service is incredibly, incredibly slow.
Accommodating to gluten free needs. Fish tacos, chips, & salsa were great. Service excellent.  Also liked the complimentary chocolate tamale dessert.
If you come here to dine in close to closing time DO NOT sit in the back section or you will get scolded by the Latina hussie behind the counter.
Good for only one visit.  Very overpriced
The food is overpriced and so are the drinks. The atmosphere is not casual and the place is not very inviting. The hostess was not friendly and neither was the staff inside. I did not enjoy coming to this place and I don't think I'll be returning.
This is never a bad spot no matter the time of day. Seriously.
This place does not even deserve one star. The place was dirty and the service stunk.
It's so, so mexican food. My husband loves it- I think it's a bit greasy. La Canasta on 7th St is way, way better. The salsa they put on the table is a little too hot for my taste as well.
AWESOME. \n\nAnd sometimes when it's really busy, they take you to magical rooms of the building that you don't even know exist for extra seating. \n\nBut really everything is good here.
We saw Mary Poppins and three generations of us loved it- the show stealing was accomplished by the ensemble cast with this one. The star roles were also awesome but the ensemble scenes blew me away.
It was OK. A Mexican restaurant without con queso is crazy! Food was average at best. Service was good and the strawberry margarita was good but the food was not impressive.
Stay away from this hooters. Bad food, bad service. Bleh!
They seem to be declining over recent years but the Mizithra is so good we went back anyway.  Appetizer flatbread was fair.  Chicken parm was fair.  Mizithra was great.
Decent burger, good salads but really high prices for the quality...probably because of the location.  Nice outdoor seating area.
They also messed with my side mirror and gave me a huge blind spot which I didn't notice until driving!
Good food, quick service. Kinda pricey for the brown bag crowd. Great tea!
Awesome staff, great food and cool decor
I really dint care for this place. the music was blah and the out door seating was lame.The only cool thing i saw was the big unit. A home wrecking size weenie some old man was trying to deep throat.
Check out my blog review and photos:\n\nhttp://food-tales-and-other-fun.tumblr.com/post/24344649924/
The food was really unimpressive, especially for the prices. The Michael Bible cocktail was pretty good.
Cheap and fast -express !! - delicious hummus and taromasalata , the burgers weren't bad ,  a convenient location for where I was working - myself and colleagues had around fifteen meals here in the space of a week , - nothing wrong with any of them.
My husband and I attended the yelp sponsored date night at the Arizona Science Center. We had a blast checking out all the hands-on exhibits as well as the planetarium. The Van Gogh Alive! was an excellent immersive multimedia mix of art, music, and quotes.
This place has gone down hill. What used to be in the normal exhibits are now in a paid exhibit hall. It's sad that they have resorted to that to make money. I won't be renewing my membership.
I write this as I sit awaiting for my food.  I've been waiting for an hour now.  At a table with 10 other people, and the food is brought out 1 or 2 at a time.  This will be my last visit.
Came here for the menudo. Chips were hot and fresh tasting. Red menudo has a good taste. I still think Caramba's in downtown Glendale has the best menudo although this one is right up there. B-
Really good menudo and salsa and fresh chips are a must .. The prices are great and the food is real mexican home cooked meals ...
2 stars. Only cause the drink prices are good.
Every time I go to Whataburger, I get chicken strips. It is the only place I can think of that gives you a piece of toast with your meal.
I don't know what everyone else on here is talking about; this Whataburger is super fast!  The entire drive thru process took a grand total of four minutes.  Great place to stop for a quick lunch when you work downtown.
Disney Land for Foodies. Fresh Baked Goods, Salsas, Mexican dishes (the torta cubana is to die for) and an awesome atmosphere, plus more produce than the human eye should ever behold. My favorite place in Phoenix.
Lite lunch with the ladies.  Two of us shared Crab Cakes and Caprese salad.  I could have eaten an entire platter full of the crab cakes.
Expensive and just ok.
great place and atmosphere, great ice cream and malts.
The Best Bean Burro Enchilada Style EVER!!
Absolutely fabulous!  Why do so many people fixate on the location?  The food was super delicious, Mexican + seafood, where could things go wrong.
Should have known better than to eat in a place so dark that you can't see the food on your plate. Underwhelming and overpriced.
Love the Chihuly Art throughout the gardens, I was bummed that the cafe was closed. It's definitely a great walk this great scenery! Lovely for photos!
What a wonderful place to visit. Especially at night during the holidays. This past holiday season the Chihuly exhibit was magical. Treat yourself and go.
Loved this place.  The service was great, the restaurant was spotless, the food was really great and it was very affordable.  The Pupusa's were amazing!  I also loved their mango iced tea and the desserts were really tasty as well.
Shortly after posting this review someone from Pep Boys requested I email them about the situation at hand. Would you guess I received NO response?! What a crock. Save yourself and do not bring your car to a Pep Boys Service Center!
Avoid the lunch buffet.  Excellent Chicken Tikka Masala.
Decent. The dishes are somewhat bland and seem to be not quite as authentic as I have had in the past. The curry was ok and the tikka masala, well Ive had better. The buffet is above average and as always the Naan was wonderful!
Really great staff - friendly and professional. But the facility is beat. Rugs stained, wanted to wear flip flops in my room. Towels scratchy. They need to raze it and start over.
Above average BBQ at a resonable price.  Large portions.
Must have been an off day but still pretty good. Better luck next time!
I've been going to this particular one since 1987.  It was a ritual to go there right after the Copper World race, Indy car race and  the races at Manzanita.  Great food, great portions and great atmosphere.
The food wasn't very tasty. The bathrooms will make you leave and not even ask for your money back.
This zoo is amazing. I love that they have two splash zones. Please make sure to have your kids bring water appropriate clothes to play in. The barn and petting area is my daughters favorite place to check out!
ok food...def not thing worth driving more than 5 minutes to... i paid $6 for a burrito and a soda..not expensive but a 3 bite burrito shouldnt be 5 bucks..
Unfortunately, this place is on a downward trajectory it appears. Many businesses have closed and there are many vacancies. The ones that are there, apart from the Asian Market have changed hands. Not bad, but not worth a special trip.
Kungpao chicken is the best iv ever had!\n\nFood is great, they are fast, and friendly. \n\nI love this place!
The staff is nice .... Tables never seem to be clean and treys the beef brisket was great except for the bread
Good food\nFriendly service (only if they are not busy)\nI mainly go here for the appetizers and beer during happy hour
Good place.  Friendly staff.  It has a nice little bar with a few TV's to watch the game, which is a lot to ask in Midtown Phoenix. :)
Always a great meal, tomato moz sandwich amazing, focia pizza amazing
Super cute spot with the freshest of the fresh ingredients. Tasty sandwiches and salads. Fast and friendly service. Adorable country farm feel. What's not to love?
The best place in town to watch European football (soccer for locals). I would rate it with 5 stars but the food is just tasteless, so think about watching football and having drinks there only.
Enjoyed the fish and chips. The fish flaky, thick cut, with a thin crispy batter. The chips... a little to soft. Overall pretty good. Looks like a great place to catch a soccer game. English style food.
Horrible service, horrible attitudes. I created a yelp account to write this review. Absolutely rude and incredibly expensive.
i love this applebee's !!!! everyone is super friendly!  for dessert i recommend getting the blondie! so yummy
The Salt and Pepper flounder is amazing.  The egg drop soup is amazing as well.
The orange chicken and house rice were perfect together.  We added in a pork dish and it was a great combo.  They seated us quickly and had our drinks out right away.  The server checked on us consistently but wasn't annoying!
I just paid $20 for two drinks.  This place is delicious and healthy but the price is absolutely ridiculous.  The kale isn't fresh it's frozen. The drinks are good but not worth the price. Just juice at home or go to a neighborhood market.
Rip . off.  Thief People Up In There.
Used to be a serviceable record store but has become a shell of its former self.  OVERPRICED lps and the selection is almost the same as it was 10 years ago.  I am an avid collector and really find no reason to go here anymore.
Very upset this place has closed. Please come back! One of the few places in town where you can get healthy take-out.
I like this location.  They have a lot of turnover, but for the most part everyone has been pretty good.  Wish the outside tables were cleaned more often.  They are too dirty 90% of the time to use.
Good stuff.  Haven't had too much of the food.  Onion rings are delicious.  All beers delicious.  Good joint to grab a growler for the drive home...I mean for when you get home.
Delicious, finely crafted beer! Good food and friendly staff.
Average beer... Great food.
If you're into great craft beer, don't waste your time here. The cask conditioned IPA tastes like dish water. Food was average. Meh.
Been here before to skate and its very nice, friendly, and not crowded by any means :)
I won't lie, I've been here once or twice.  Not on par with Canadian clubs but much better than the other clubs in the valley.
This is the only place I go when I need greeting cards. The store has a wonderful assortment of gifts and seasonal items. The women who work there treat you like family.
This place is awesome!!  been going here for years the # 1 is the way to go red chili is amazing
Second try:\n\nSo I am updating my review! Received the giftcard and went ahead and tried it again ( dinned in this time around ) it was PERFECTION.  We'll go back for sure!
I Love Oregano's, but this specific location is terrible.  The food is not prepared as well as the other locations.  Very Very dissapointed
Excellent waiters, nice and clean tables and floor. Good food portions.decent prices. Food is delicious and fresh. Beer was excellent .
Amazing that a cafe like this can do great sushi, Italian pasta, and ramen!  Try the low carb soy noodles in your Italian dish.  Good stuff.
LOOOOVE this place!! PAD Thai is delicious :)
Not the best country club I have ever golfed at, but pretty nice all the same.  The course itself is well maintained, though it was aerated recently.  Customer service is obviously touted here and it shows throughout the entire facility.  I had a nice experience and will definitely be back soon.
The music was good.  The beer was warm.  Wheat beer served warm can contain bacteria.  The person I was with and myself were both sick for three days.
LOVE going to the eye doctor now!  They can get me in and out in no time.  Extremely friendly staff!
I pass by this walgreens on the way home so I stop in frequently. Always able to find what I need. Clean and organized, will come again.
Be prepared to be upset it is gone has been for several years now.
Went back to Volvo Am I for a maintenance check, and the second visit was as positive as the first.  Volvo Am I Fane
Great place, not a lot of parking.  We ordered a pizza and chicken parm.  It was really good food and the service was great.  We will be visiting this place again!
Excellent pizza and great service.  The Mediterranean Pizza and Moscato wine both get 5 stars.
This place is as bad to be expected! \n\nEssentially a warehouse stuffed with random fabric scraps, ribbon and assorted accessories. \n\nTo be honest, you better come here on a scavenger hunt, or else you will be disappointed!
Genny's is a hoot! I'm def Straight but NOT narrow.
Dennys has changed their delicious chicken fried steak to a formed meat product brick \nEPIC FAIL!!!!!!
I can almost always find something fan-fuckin-tastic for less than half the price it'd be in it's original store.
Unique food, great atmosphere, pricey but worth a trip for special occasions.
Shrimp Tacos Morongos.  There may be no better shrimp taco on this side of the border.
when you walk in its old school which is cool and the outside is cool but the food was medioca just a bit i would not give the a second shot now a different location maybe...
Decent for the money, but not spectacular. Wings were overcooked and dry. \n\nThe western bacon burger was decent. Bread was good.
It's not the easiest place to find your way around but Robert was EXtremely helpful!! my experience a little more pleasant.
THey have the best chicken fried steak that I have ever had!!! There daily specials are amazing as well!!
We got take out from here during a spring break trip. Noodles, sushi, edamame, popcorn shrimp. All delicious. I ate the leftover noodles, cold, for breakfast, the next morning.
love love moto fresh fish cool atmosphere must try this hip mod place.  The noodles are out of this world and the sushi is the best in this part of town. Be prepared for a long wait this place is popular.
Meat has decreased in quality over last couple of years. Lukes, step up your game.
Great service and prices. This is where I buy my water because its the cheapest in phoenix (even the Catalina). Fish are also healthy
I've gotten several very nice pedicures at DV.  The place isn't fancy but it's clean, the staff is friendly, and they offer good prices.
The New York Sirloin was cooked well, but it was pretty tough. The online menu said they had prime rib, which is why we came, but they don't even sell it. Our server Bryan was very good
Went here several weeks ago. My one complaint is that it is TOO dark. The food was okay, nothing special. The staff was wonderful and very attentive.
Loved.This.Place. Awesome candlelit ambience, spacious seating options, and friendly service.  Well-sorted menu with vegetarian and seafood options (yay me). Deschutes Brewery Porter. Affordable price point.
greeter which is basically security was the coolest dude there, they have hardly any wireless routers and when you ask somebody a question they are always in a hurry to get away from you to go on break i would not return to this location at all
Brought my Yorkie in and they did an amazing job! Making my next appointment now. They clipped his nails bathed and cut and even cleaned his ears. This was one of the best experiences I have had at a groomers and I highly recommend them!
This Starbucks closes late so that's the upside it has a cool patio and the inside is nice just the one thing I have to complain about is the Internet it sucks but I you come here for anything else it's all good.
Food was ok. Service was poor. Saw a roach near our table. Not my choice for a lunch companion!
Love the family atmosphere, very welcoming & friendly, excellent service & beautiful quality jewelry!
My wife and I had a great experience at Burland. Trish helped us and made it a great experience.
I'm so over this place.  Without fail, it is an unpleasant experience.  The upselling is obnoxious and they a half-assed job.
If I could give them a lower score I would. Horrible decline in quality of service. Very low morale of employees leading to poor service. Used to be great and I would go there before any other car wash or other service.
People are very rude! I was told for an extra $100 when can buff out all the scratches and it would look like a new paint job...no wonder this place has a bad rep!!! I had to give it a rating
I love the food and it is usually excellent service. I always visit the downstairs cellar bar. It has a hip rustic feel and pretty good tunes on the ipod. One of my faves
Wow!  This place is good.  My first time in Phoenix and if I ever get back I'll be sure to dine here.  So should you.  Prego.  (You're welcome.)
M'fn delicious !!! Amazing bartenders and servers... Great environment and the food is beyond delicious!!!
Been to other locations and had wonderful experience there. So I figured I would go here but it was a bad experience way to demanding for me to order as soon as we sat down so we got up and left.
Service and food was excellent!! Red sauce is to die  for! Pregnant girl's dream!! Steve was an awesome Server. Order the risotto balls!
Pleasantly surprised...thought this was just another delicatessen, but this place had a really extensive menu offering something for everyone.  I just stopped in for a snack, but would like to go back and eat a full meal.
not impressed. My salad was $17 for lunch!! and also NOT WORTH IT. Very pricey for what you get.
FYI. Chili's still sucks.
Disappointed. Suzie was very rushed. About 10 minutes into my appointment another girl walked in for her appointment. Suzie sent her to go get her feet done in the meanwhile. This is the worst my nails have looked
Amazing food and excellent service. LOVED the porcini rubbed delmonico.
I have always had a great meal here.
The room was comfortable, the wait staff was friendly and attentive. However for the price the food was just ok. It was our anniversary so we expected some little treat with a candle at the end but what they brought was a plate of pink cotton candy. Holly tooth decay Batman!
I loved the free wi-fi...but the coffee was just ok.  Wish that they would switch to a different brand of soy milk since the Silk soy has a pretty strong flavor profile.
Nothing like an Iced Almond milk Extra Dirty Chai to get this day started!!!!  A must try here.....
The Doc fixed my eye & the staff rocks... you all get out of Jail for free... Maricopa County Jail only.
I have nothing compelling to say because this restaurant is unremarkable.  The food is good.  I have eaten here a few times when I was with a group.  I wouldn't ever choose it on my own accord.
You usually can't go wrong staying at an Embassy Suites hotel.  The rooms are huge and the breakfast is yummy.  You can sometimes get free happy hour drinks too!
Great place to sit and drink wine on a Saturday afternoon where you have nothing better to do. Food's average. Lots of people watching which I  love. No indoor seating though so avoid when hot.
The store is small and uncomfortable, but the products are decent.
Another fine dinner at China Village.  I ordered Ma-Po bean curd for dinner.  I had enough to share with my dinner mate.  The service was excellent as usual.  The hostess was very concerned that my group enjoyed their dinner.
Lara was the best.  Incredible customer service.  Thank you for picking up slack for some other PB locations.
Is is awful customer service, and the people do not wear gloves.\n\ndo not go there.
this is the best car wash that I have used in Phoenix.  yelp coupon doesn't hurt either.
The problem is that the atmosphere is subpar, and the drinks are literally half full. Don't believe me order a 50/50 vesper, it's 50% full. I will not return.
Vincent's market bistro is my usual weekday go to. Always pleased with there salads, soups, apps, mains and desserts! Scotty and the staff are the best. You know a place is good when there clientele have been going there for years and years.
The new owners of Ice House Tavern are no longer hosting live bands. This is such a disappointment to the local music scene!
I am not a vegan but love vegetables and would prefer to not eat meat most of the time. This place has the best spring rolls I have ever tasted. My sister-in-law is vegan and I went with her and she liked it too!
The \"street tacos\" here are outstanding.  Consistent quality w/ a hot sauce bar that apologizes to no one.  Friendly staff.  Hear me now, believe me later.  Strong.
This place is always busy, and mistakes are made with otherwise simple menu items.
I have only gone here for kids/baby gifts and it's a great place to find that perfect, unique gift. It's really pricey, so be prepared to spend a lot. However, they have complimentary gift wrap and it looks really nice when they're done.
I would never go there again. I walked it there and the guy looked at me like I was bothering him. I guess my money will bother him too.
I just came in for an OJ and one of their fruit cups, I was in a deep craving of fruits and this was the closest spot to me that Thursday that offered such small craving to-go. The service was okay/good. Could have been better.
I waited 20 minutes for my asiago bagel and I was the only one in the dining area  but they forgot about it and burned my bagel. Service is terrible.
This place is dirty.  The plate my food was served on was dirty, our waitress's apron was dirty, and the booth we sat in was dirty; it left a huge grease stain on my daughter's pants.   This place is disgusting.
Unimpressed and disappointed. There is nothing to these sandwiches. There are so many other places to get better sandwiches. Will not be returning.
One of my favorite places to grab a quick bit, a delicious dessert, or something fun from the the store!
Went there the next day and had the chicken salad sandwich which was superb.  The people are friendly and attentive.
I stop for their great coffee every morning -- and only drive by when I can't manage to get a parking spot.  LGO also has really great unique gifts that have come in handy for Mother's Day, Christmas and \"just because\" cards and notes.
Yum!\nCute, cute place!!  Go for specialty groceries, pastries, or a quick lunch or breakfast.
Wow. Completely disappointed. I had the commuter. When did English muffins lose their crispness, holes and flavor. Not impressed at all.
Overly priced :/ they do not clean under nails. Very nice workers though. Great customer service. ;)
I LOVE this place!  My sister jokes that the only reason she comes to visit me in Arizona is for Postino's!
This place always has a fun vibe and a great patio. Love meeting girlfriends here for wine and bruschetta.  Good service and nice atmosphere, a true staple.
Not good ,, too small... n its overrated! who waits 1hr for a glass of wine., i would rather get a bottle n drink at home.
1/3 cheddar burger with all toppings.  You wish more places and owner/operators existed like this.
They quoted me 15 minutes, and just 10 minutes later called my name to say it was done. Quickest oil change I've ever had.\n\nPaid $38 and some change with the $5 off Ladies' Wednesday discount.
Best Thai in town. I've been eating here since 1994 or so.
Absolutely the best red curry in history.  Wife loved the brocoly chicken.  I live in Idaho and there are only 2 restaurants in Phoenix I go out of my way for.  Thai lahna is one of them..
The owner was so rude I walked out! And they only accept cash and the only reason I gave them a star is because the review made me! I mean this guy was ridiculous! I never had anyone greet me at the door like that!!
I do not recommend.
Down-home live music dive that's family owned and offers a great value for the money. Cheap drinks, good food, no cover (usually). Opens at 6 am most days. Get over here.
Pruitts was just ok. The place is a little trashed. The prices were ok but not as aggressive as they used to be. The service wasn't very good either granted it is a furniture store though.
Pruitts asked me to email them to allow them an opportunity to make it right. So i did. Haven't heard anything else back.
Chef cooking in the open facility. Mostly noodles. Pad Thai noodles, beef. A most desirable appetite for the hungry man. Couldn't take this to heart.
Went there for an oil change recently.  Didn't know if there's going to be a wait time so I called ahead and make an appointment.  In and out of the store in under 30 minutes.  Great service and friendly staffs.
Food is good but I was told I could not have a refill on my soda... Completely turned off by this. You charge me $2 for a soda and will not give 1 refill? Shame!
The experience at Marcellino Ristorante is perfect and I love their new location in Scottsdale!
I have been to Mary for facials seeking clear skin for 9 years.  Yes my skin looks great.  She always has the latest and best products and treatments.  Mary 's salon is always a place of welcome and relaxation.  She takes time to evaluate my skin each session.
My husband took me to dinner here once. For such a big venue it was extremely empty. \nOnce the food arrived I knew why. The food was so bland. I could have made dinner that night for way cheaper.
You get what you pay for. I may as well have let my kids paint my toenails. Not to mention the tech was rough and cut/pinched several of my toes during my pedicure.   Not impressed. I definitely won't be back.
Chile Relleno is really good. It comes with the standard side of rice and beans which is nothing special. I have been there 4 times and have the same thing each time. Don't blink or you'll drive right past this place.
Get the \"Green Beef\" from the Side Orders, with  Corn tortillas or Rice.
I  had a call this morning from Kitty, and they have agreed to refund a good portion of our repair bill.  Thank you so much for the call and concern.  I will now recommend W J Maloney Plumbing as an A-1 company.
Very happy with ease of Christmas tree shopping. Beautiful backdrop. Cookies, lights, hot cocoa, cider. A nice fire with seats and blankets. Ecstatic that we decided to turn in and buy our first tree here!!!
This place is a great dive bar. We love the drink prices and the people here are laid back and cool. (no need to worry about any fights that I could tell) Highly recommend if you like dive bars. Also they have pool tables and darts.
Delivery is super fast. If you think you can jump in the shower after you call in your order, you'll end up answering your door in a towel.
The worse service ever She went to charge me and said the last time I was in the machine didn't work and charged me for the last time i was in. Ripped off!!!Will never go there again!!!
Great job here as always, but they often mischarge me...rather, overcharge me
The food tasted really good, the time to make it, however, took a while.
It's a chain restaurant what do you expect? ..... Chips and salsa to go... Watching the cowboys hot chips seems like good start
Nothing fancy here but the price is right: $17 for a pedicure and plenty of polish colors to choose from.
Love the bagels.  But . . . Need to have the boxes ready for grab and go. Never seem to have them ready when I get here, thus waiting in line contrary to the program. Bummer.
basic food, nothing special, but all tasted good.  Limited menu, funny wine selection, no multipuciano, or other usual italian wines.  Just the popular basics.  Right next to Goodwill, but better than you'd expect
Terrible service & charged me for ceramic brakes, but only gave me lower-quality semi-metallic brakes. After I went to another mechanic to discover the problem, Fletchers still wouldn't fix the problem.
No one bothered helping us : (
Amazing food! Some of the best curry we have had! So craveable & authentic !!
Love this little, genuine place! It has great lunches and has ruined me for pad Thai anywhere else in the valley! Their soups are a must!
pinky's is closed
Full trash bins, over charged for free drink with sandwich purchase, unfriendly man working today.  \n\nThis is not what I am used to for a QT.
Decent selection, fair prices, but could use more folks at the checkout lanes, or at least a process whereby they call up more employees to help out quicker.
Love Em' new ownership, better atmosphere!\n\nFood is always tasty!
The massage therapist, Susan, is one of those rare finds in a chiropractic clinic. She is an experienced and talented massage therapist whom I highly recommend.
I stopped here occasionally when I'm in the mood for Mexican.   The food is good.   However the reason I go there is because The staff is always friendly.   It's like they're happy to see you.  Other than that it\"s just an okay place with good food
Average location. My order was incorrect as was about 5 out of the next 8 I witnessed.
i use to go to this place few years ago and then i forgot about it after moving to another city.i just saw it on YELP and i remember their amazing selection.I think it is time for some russian caviar.
I have gone here a few times in the past because its the only place around. I have since began just ordering online. The customer service here is terrible and they make you feel really stupid. Avoid it if you can.
Glad to see so many people feel the same about Dr. Larson. My husband and I have been going to him for years, for regular \"maintenance\".
Price reflects quality and service.  5/2010 purchased wedding gown, brides maids and mothers (bride and groom mothers and grandmothers) dresses.  Girls were rude and our brides maids dresses seems and straps fell apart just before the wedding.
Helpful staff! This is what I like to see!!! Love the selection and the staff was very great in helping me and my Auntie find what we needed :D
very poor customer service, i am only going to arrowhead Buckle from now on!! completely ignored at pv and there selection was poor.
Stopped for a quick gyro to go, not bad but the cucumber sauce had overpowering garlic added, very bitter and bad taste left in my mouth for hours!\n\nGirl at the register was stunningly beautiful, will return for another try!
Everytime I go to this places I am surprised.  I just expect it to be bad but the food is actually really good. I have had a salad, a sandwich, and a melt. All were good good. : ) The service is always friendly to boot.
Very good quality / price ratio. Warm and friendly welcome, good effort to understand my broken English. Well located, very good comfort room and spacious. The restaurant on the 27 th floor very well. At recomander.
The most outstanding customer service and extremely efficient wash, details, and oil changes! Anything and everything I need exceeds more than my expectations. I go to this wash at least two times a week and I leave happy every time!
Never eat here. They got my order wrong and put some spicy sauce on my taco that made me throw up.
Friday night, pretty busy, bar somewhat busy and the bartender (attractive, female, brunet) answers the house phone and has been talking for 15 minutes as I write this..  ????  WTF..  never coming back..
This company is good at cleaning your pockets and that's it. Terrible experience even after they were sent back to re-clean. This company does business under numerous names so check out the phone  number - buyer definitely BEWARE - awful cleaning service.
Wasted my time going there at 658pm Friday night when their website said they closed at 8pm.
Our family has frequented Shogun for years and we are done. The service is awful and the food has gone  downhill. While I hope that their manager Shelly has success turning it around, it is obvious that the owners don't care. Our friends are saying the same thing.
Sushi was very good and fresh. The restaurant was very busy, probably due to the $0.25 draft beers on Monday night's. The sushi counter was kinda awkard with high panels.
I will not be ordering from here again. The only good thing I ordered was the cream cheese wontons. All of the vegetables had a really funky taste, and the garlic chicken had no garlic flavor.
They have really good cheap sandwiches for lunch
Disgusting. Typical cheap, dirty, greasy Americanized Chinese food. Clean your damn restrooms! Chicken thigh meat in the chicken and broccoli. Hot and sour was pure barf. Dark.
One step above a hole in the wall buffet place.  Food was edible.  Very bland, service was very un-attentive and my egg roll was soggy to boot.  I'll take my money elsewhere.
Menu looks like every single chinese takeout place on the east coast and they aren't pretentious.  Clearly I'm not in California anymore.  Fantastic.  This place made me pretty dang happy.\n\nIt's rot gut chinese.  Boom.
Average food, VERY limited delivery area, and abrupt customer service.  Very meh.
Super veggie pizza. Steve, is always totally friendly. Solid Craft Beer Selection with 10 or so taps.  Why don't they make their apps?..Music is good as well  but they usually have the same groups.  One of my favs in the (51) Corridor.
Friendly, accommodating, and the pizza and wings are always good.  It is one of my go to places for a casual dinner out.
This was some of the worst sushi I've ever had, especially for the money. I could barely get it down. The place is dumpy and depressing inside. All around terrible.
I ordered a mozzarella and tomato sandwich, a small order of pasta salad, and a drink and it came out to $13. For $13 I could of gone to a restaurant. Paradise Bakery has some of the best cookies around but the food is a rip off.
Quick, helpful, and clean  what else do you want?
Wonderful daycare/preschool. My kids have been there for 2 years and we have had great experiences with all of the teachers. They have a Christian environment which at this age is perfect for any religion- a good foundation of bible stories, God and kindness which we can build upon at home.
Service is almost always slow and food is just okay. Even my beer was warm tonight. Kinda of pricey but what do you expect out of a hotel restaurant?
Stick with sandwiches.  Everything else is so-so.
Good service.  Free sufficient size samples and not just a spoonful.  The regular size is more than enough! When I was there, they were out of a lot of flavors though =(
If you aren't afraid of the atmosphere you'll probably like this. Not for anyone that has any diet restrictions. But man was it packed and cheap. I felt like we had found the Dallas Buyers Club of z Mexican Food.
Chorizo and bean burro and the butter tortillas are a must have! The tortillas here are sooo good :)
Love their fried fish with fries and the endless supply of ranch. Oh sooo good! The price is right, the service is ok. There's room for improvement. Call in your orders during rush hours.
They have good kettle corn
There was a wendys. Thats it in my terminal worth mentioning.  Bathroom doors don't lock.
Lots of construction going on here. But the traffic is never heavy so its ok. they have decent places to grab food and have cool trinquet shops for souvenirs . I come here cause I don't think there is a choice.
The TSA was extremely friendly and understanding
typical airport, moody security and the boarding areas are pretty small
Free WiFi! Spread far out, but I guess if you have one thing in Arizona, it's space
Great airport to fly in or out of.
Most confusing airport ever! I've been to quite a few airports and I've never seen an airport so difficult to navigate, that includes walking around inside and driving on the roads outside.  Just very poor signage.  Airport is nicely updated though...
Sky harbor in general is good but terminal 2- not much of anything. Limited restaurants and only few flights that fly out there. If you coming to terminal 2, then plan on not waiting out here too long.
Late night great food as always.  Very clean, and staff was awesome.
Called today to order a pizza was told they won't deliver to me. No reason why. Nothing. I wont order from them again. Their loss. Funny they used to deliver here. Scoffs .. Guess my money isn't green enough for them.
Great diversity of plants and they have Christmas trees this time of year. I'll definitely be back to check out the rest of the grounds. Very friendly staff that helped us with putting the tree on the roof of the car
I frequent Jays.  Best gyro deal in the area.  The place is not fancy at all.  Don't expect that great of service.  Be sure to listen for your order to be up.  It is barebones, but my stop in Tempe for gyros..
nice place to get grocery and gas, its a convenient neighborhood grocery store in south phx
T-Bone steak ride was wonderful!  Horses are beautiful and well cared for!
Unique experience but don't get suckered into the ride at night and then T Bone dinner at a cabin in the desert. The cabin is a restaurant behind a neighborhood that is ok but not worth the $50 you will spend for two people.
Took our guests from Ohio to see this unique place, and we wanted to see it too. We waited over 45 minutes and no one showed to open the gates. Very under managed and disorganized. We left to see other sites, could not wait all day!!
Decent food, when in the mood for Chinese I go here. Sometimes I even have it delivered. Food is good and service is great.
Ok ,,,, I haven't been to this restaurant in about three years I went back thinking it was going to be the same O same O(which I loved) it turned out to be a very big disappointment;( won't be back plus they were rude
I love this location.  The staff is always awesome and super friendly, especially at night :)  Out of the Taco Bell's I've been to in Phoenix, this is definitely my favorite for that very reason.
What a truly amazing view and ride through that mountainside! I will recommend this place to anyone that ends up in the area. It is something to see for sure
Great Service! Reliable and friendly. I just needed a new headlight installed and they were quick and accurate! The price is right ;) I will go back!
Could be the most inefficient operation.  They had one guy moving cars and four other guys standing around. Took over an hour to get a wash, and that included no vacuum as well.
This is my favorite sushi spot.  The price is right, the staff is friendly, the sushi is pretty darn good and the ambiance is nice and cozy.  Great for a date, or even just lunch.  I can walk out full and sakied up for 20 bucks!
Best Lo Mein anywhere in this town! Their dishes always taste fresh and are superbly balanced. We paid them many visits and were never disappointed. They deliver as well.
Staff is excellent and knowledgable.  Flatbread was fantastic.  Very cute and great atmosphere.
Overpriced and overhyped food. Last time turned around at the door due to the smell and waiting line.....
Great happy hour specials! They also do a special during the summer when the temp hits a certain point they give free chocolate or cheese fondue to they're facebook fans.
Our visit was the climax to a wonderful eveing out and the staff were so awesome in describing their menu and how it all worked.
Everything here is delicious!  Burgers on pretzel buns is where it's at.  And the fish tacos were amazing and I don't even like fish!  If you're thinking about trying is place, do yourself a favor and go!
Decent food. We ordered cod fish tacos and salmon with quinoa which was listed as lifestyle menu. My entree side was kale salad which was not my favorite. Drinks were good and service was nice but slow.
Read in the paper this location has closed! It was a decent place to eat at the handful of times I went there. Hope something good goes in its place fast.
Just makes your day better when you have friendly service and a yummy bagel!
Such great service!  Everyone in there is so nice.  My husband bought my engagement ring at Ganem and they are always so helpful whenever I bring it in to get cleaned or buffed.  Great staff & never any pressure to purchase.  The only jewelers we will use from now on.
I have been here once and tried the red velvet cake and it was great! If only they were open on Sundays too! :)\n\nWill definitely go again.
This is an alright place if you haven't experienced some of the much better places in Arizona.  I think it is somewhat overpriced compared to similar restaurants and the food isn't anything to rave about.
Was visiting friends and found this place thanks to Yelp. The food was good but not good enough to warrant 4 stars.
Had the super nachos and hard shell taco. Nachos were loaded- had extra toppings when we ran out of chips and the tacos were nice with a little heat.
Great food, good prices, and a good menu. Only downside is the wait is a little long and the place is cramped. Overall a great place for your die hard Mexican food lover.
I freaking love this place! Their Arizona Burrito with chicken is amazing! My favorite little hole in the wall Mexican restaurant!
Hair cut and price for 2 yorkies poor and it stunk smelled bad
Great service!!\n(written on 4/24/2012)
This Best Buy is not as new looking as the one by the mall but I feel like the employees here are more knowledgeable and helpful than at the other location.
I will never be back to this Best Buy and would advise everyone else to find a more customer friendly store.
I thought the whole point of taco bell is its open late. Not 11pm, or a few minutes before. Boo
Eye Priority is a fantastic business - quality and professional eye exams by caring optometrists - fashionable and large selection of frames to choose from coupled with a extremely helpful staff. No better place for prescription eyewear in Ahwatukee!
Food is barely average and going down hill fast. Service is not great but they try. But they might think of asking the waitress to shower once in a while. Gross.
After getting diarrhea from eating the mediocre Mongolian Beef here, I think I would avoid any future contact with this establishment.
This place has the best gourmet shrimp, bacon & avocado tacos!!! YUM
How the Mighty have fallen , service is pure crap
This place is beautiful. Hospitality is great. Food is good. Gym is good. Plenty to do here and plenty of swimming pools. Worth checking out.
Awesome resort and fabulous water park!  Great for the family!
Fun atmosphere, great drinks and tasty food. My wife and I had a great dinner here we will be back when were back in Phoenix :)
View was incredible. Service was quick and nice. Fried bread was delicious.  Steaks were mediocre.  Vegetables and sides were awful.
Simply put...I've had better.  I ordered two meals with fried rice.  The rice contained hard pieces that were uneatable, yuck!  Crab ragoons had an imitation crab flavor and sadly to say, I think Panda Express does it better.
First time to Waffle House and we were not disappointed. Selection is basic but service was friendly and the hot and delicious was served in under 5 minutes. We were headed out of town and this place was perfect for a hot meal on the go.
Heard good things, but, did not even measure up. Very bland...really man? It's Thai how can it be flavorless? Don't waste your time!
This practice sends out junk mail and there is no way  to get off.  From now on I am going to write a negative review about everyone who sends me junk mail
Excellent food as always
This location is clean and efficient.  Our waitress was awesome and had our order in and food out VERY quickly.  The food is all fantastic and of good quality.
I LOVE this Petsmart! I shop here, adopted my cat and my dog here, use the grooming salon (well, not personally) and just really like everything about it and its employees! They really go above and beyond to help you figure out and find what you need.
This place is pretty good. I was surprised. The service was just ok though.
Had great service here but the food was nothing special & the atmosphere wasn't either. Unless you are drinking beer & watching sports there really is no reason to be here.
Ick. Surprised this location has not been closed. There is seldom anyone there, the food is terrible and smells like dirty wet towels when you first walk in. Attention health dept, time for a spot check.
I have been going to rebeckha lafferty for years..best at cutting very thick hair and colors knowledge is great. .only go to her. .If she is off wait till she is available. ..
Such a fun place for kids and parents both.  Great place to make gifts or just to have fun.  So fun.
Meh. I've experienced better.
Lobster pot stickers, divine Butterfish, seared Ahi , chocolate lava cake all to die for!!
So slow! Waited 30 min between courses. Entree dish was barely warm- the manager removed the charge for the dish. Food was good, not the service I expect at its price point. Disappointing.
ordered the steak sandwich (medium rare).  Came out cooked medium.  Still very delicious.  French fries were not good, way too salty.  Server seemed as though he did not want to be there, with a grouchy attitude.
Good theatre, got tickets and good seats... Air conditioning worked well, bathrooms were very clean... And so were the floors in the theatre.
Absolutely love the service at Audi Scottsdale! I own my 2nd Audi and highly recommend. Wouldn't own any other brand. My service consultant, Jason, is the best!
When is Land Rover fast? When they're processing my payment. When do they take their sweet time? The remainder of the time. BTW, that free coffee is gonna cost you.
The urgent care here is ridiculous!! Waited for over a hour and  a half just to see the nurse practitioner who was only in here for 5 minutes tops. I wouldn't have come here but this was the only urgent care open on Sunday.
I like the pan fried dumplings and the hot and sour soup. The entree plates are huge and made to share. Staff is friendly and the drinks are good.
place is very clean:) Banana Republic is the only store I really go to here.
Very friendly people who work here. They were so great with my kids! Definitely will be back.
shitty pizza.. shittier customer service.. do your self a favor and order from Big Boy's. Bitch.. I am a customer. Don't get all snotty with me on the phone for asking questions about your specials.
Always great wings. I went to watch UFC with some friends. Staff is friendly drinks a plenty. good staff @ this loc.  no complaints.  my compliments
Went there last night for their monthly free planetarium show. It was a really cool show that was unfortunately set to Pink Floyd music. After the show the science dept professors had a huge telescope set up and we were able to look at the moon. First friday of every month!
Terrible customer service, they close 10 mins early as customers are getting out and turn them away, spend your money anywhere else.
Went by the other day and it is closed.  Unfortunate, now I don't know where to get the delicious sour cherries in syrup I love with greek yogurt.
My chicken was so plain. I was upset with it. It was just teriyaki chicken. Hard to mess up. I doubt ill be back. It is a relaxing place tho. Just dont go for the food.
THE BEST crab puffs, hands down.
Best Subs around period.
I love Cheba hut. My personal favorite is the White Widow. Its the best chicken bacon ranch sandwich out there. Their meat and dressings are prepared fresh daily.  Great spot for lunch breaks but be prepared to wait, the line will be long.
Service was fast, friendly and everything was so much fun . And the sandwich I ordered was phenomenally good. I should have gotten the 4 inch because that was all I could finish. When I saw the picture of Ice Cube on the ice machine I thought I would lose it. Hilarious!
Good bulgogi, and a spicy octopus platter I forgot the name of.  I'd visit again, but my eyes tear whenever I walk into the place- not their fault I'm allergic to *.
This place has AWESOME kimchi Chigae, kalbi is ok but kinda overpriced. The service is hit or miss here. \n\nBut probably one of the best korean places on the east side.
Local shop with a great selection and very helpful. \n\nGot to support the locals!
It's okay. it's nothing like San Francisco food .
I've been here 5 minutes, only one hair stylist here doing a trim on a guy's hair, while chatting and watching YouTube videos and consistently stopping. Should maybe take in to consideration that she has a customer waiting.
They certainly have everything, from tiaras to bottles of that stuff you use to create real-looking wounds. A little on the pricey side, but excellent stuff overall.
I've never really had a bad experience per se, but I've not exactly been helped a whole bunch either. It's Home Depot. What more can you expect?
More expensive than most of the sushi places in Mesa. They make the rolls look normal sized by adding extra rice using very little fish. I would not go back, very poor value.
I would give it more stars, but I don't want the bar to get too crowded.
Wow this is a really nice place. I've never visited this cinema before, but I was surprised. The restrooms are clean and modern, the theatre is a great size and they have a great selection at the snack bar. I will go back to this theatre for sure.
Can you say- alot of food. First time patron and wasn't that impressed. It's alright nothing spectacular. Just feels like and taste like your at olive garden on steroids.
4 words.  rib eye medium rare.\nand cinammon butter rolls.\nhands down, the BEST steakhouse.  better than outback, ruth chris's, all the fancy places.
Yoko is pretty good, prices are just right and service is friendly and prompt. I would recommend this to someone.
I have been coming here for over 10 yrs.  I try other places and always come back to Nancy's place.  They are friendly, I like my nails and pedi's.
i love tjs there selection of vegies,cheeses,flowers,ect ,ect, ect all at such great prices, and just there over all selection of intresting products, i  am like a kid in a candy store,
Party of 10.   Made a reservation.    Had to wait 30 minutes anyway.   Desmond, our waiter could have cared less.   Food was decent, but the service was brutal.\n\nIm guessing they either have high staff turnover or are under staffed.
Had the BBQ Burger for lunch. Too much lettuce tomato and 'fixings' to steal the taste of the burger away. \n\nLet the meat be the star of the burgers, not lettuce.
This will be quick . Was there the night of May 13. Staff were less than helpful, in fact they weren't helpful at all.
Good food, arrives hot, service is spectacular!
Carne Asada tacos are to die for. Had four at $1.10/each and was pleasantly full to the gills. Will return next time in the area.
Pretty little dive for some amazing mexican food. The street tacos are amazing and everything along with it was superb. Probably one of the top 5 spots for Mexican food in the east valley.
The valley isn't known for its \"mom and pop restaurants\" or \"Dives\" as I affectionately call them but this place was spot on a great place to eat. I'm looking forward to trying their breakfast items.
Still the best dinner theater .Great for all ages .Very clean ,and nice .
I was in the area so I tried out royal cleaners. A bit pricey I think.....the 2 out of 3 pairs of shorts I had them repair (buttons) have came off again. Being that they weren't cheap I expected a much better job
I sued these people and won. Please make sure you take pictures when you move in and when you move out! Office is full of kids that have no idea what they are doing. Check out their reputation with the BBB.
Ugg hortible service. Not helpful or smiley. Food was subpar. Flimsy lettuce and bland. Patio has no speakers or misters...but hey they have heaters..what the heck?
Have never heard a word from corporate, even an apology email would have been nice.  I'd be willing to bet they get SO MANY complaint letters they just can't keep up.  Or they just don't give a shit.  My money is on the second.
Nice 50's atmosphere albeit noisy. Had breakfast of eggs, ham and \"home fries.\" Potatoes were frozen from a bag, not fresh. Biscuits were frozen from a bag. Service was OK. Seems to be popular with the 70+ crowd.
Waiting room is not very comfortable. Too busy on a Friday be prepared for lots of upgrades. Good luck with just an oil change.  They are good and fast just keep at an oil change only.
This location could use an update,  it's pretty run down.  I do appreciate their selection of toys are better than Wal-Mart and target but I do know that they're bigger stores elsewhere.  In the EV this is the best we have.
This hospital is the best i have ever seen.  They are taking such good care of my mother. As well as all patients.  The oncology dept is the best, the friendliest ever.  Thank you
Service was excellent, food was excellent, atmosphere was comfortable.  I enjoyed eating at Serrano's.  The bean dip an salsa with their chips was excellent!  I had a 2 item combo with a tamale and enchilada.  Very tasty.
Went here because of the beautiful building and positive reviews... We were disappointed to say the least. Soggy chimichanga, mushy rice, bland machaca and chicken, chips that tasted like supermarket chips, and mediocre salsa.
It's K Mart, not bad just nothing special. Nothing really sets K Mart apart from any of the other conglomerates. Gotta shop here from time to time for MH exclusives so you'll see me busting out my Maverick patch & showing it off with pride
Its Home Depot. Decent prices & decent materials. convenient locations
So much Wrangler in here. This is redneck heaven! I will definitely be back!
I love Taco Bell! Just not this one. I now drive out of my way not to go to this one. The order is wrong Every time and I really mean every time. Bad service Bad food!
40 minutes for an oil change and then a hard up sell at the end.  At least they vacuumed my carpets.
This location blows!  From the smug attitude of many of the associates to the downright ineffectiveness of the work they pretend to be doing.  It really is awful.  Unfortunately, this location is the closest to my house.
Best buy staff are knowledgable and engaging not to happy with the venders if u will that are within the store but happy none the less
Food and service at Nellos is pretty good. Portions are a good size and the bread they give you to start the meal is delish!
Me and my husband LOVE LOVE Nello's! We have been going for years and it is by far our favorite place to go for a night out!
Lots of different options and good pizza too! Our server was a little off, but mayeb she was just having a weird day.
Awesome pizza and great service. Super friendly and a pleasure to dine out here! Don't forget to try the grilled wings!
I liked it, but my boyfriend hated it.  I might be able to talk him into going back for a happy hr or something.  They have good specials and a nice setup for drinks with friends, but no way will he want to go back at lunch time.
Waffle and banana chocolate chip pancakes are good. Service not so good. Had to wait for about two minutes for the hostess to show up. Waitress didn't smile at all :(
Pretty good breakfast, but nothing unique.
I sat in the drive thru waiting for my food for 10 minutes and was not even busy.  slow service. And they gave me the wrong order.
Horrible customer service had a receipt and wanted to exchange something like I was told I could they told me they needed the complete original packaging which was a piece of cardboard way overpriced also
We only go here for the beer selection. The food is ok,just don't stray from ordering pizza and you'll be fine.
We love ordering from these guys. Unfortunately, they're no longer in business. :(
wonderful wonderful friendly service and breakfast. sat outside but the whole place has a comfy family atmosphere. down home cooking!
Excellent, friendly service for a great price. I brought my shoes in and 2 days later they looked BRAND NEW. I would highly recommend this place. They're just 1/2 block south of Main St. by the Nile.
This location seems to go through an abnormally large number of new staff constantly. I have not had a problem with getting the correct order, but customer service is very hit and miss.
Stop by for dinner last night and place has good food and service was attentive here. Prices are good and the atmosphere is good. I be back later to see if the place stay consistent with service and food.
Slow as fudgesicles.
The food was great but the service was not nearly as good as the food. I'm pretty sure the staff did not want to be there. Next time I'll just order take out.
Did not want to give one star. Horrible service, grouchy servers..... Worst service ive ever had. Do your family a favor.... Don't eat at golden china..... Especially if your Hispanic
Take your elementary-aged children for a short day-trip.
Friendly staff\nCrunchy munchy wrap was yummy\nSweet potato wedges with sriracha mayo was pretty good.\n\nWill be back.
*Quick \n\n*Pleasant Service\n\n*Inexpensive for a generous amount of food \n\n*The best overall tasting Chinese I have found thus far in the Casa Grande Area!
Gross! I decided to try the hotel restaurant this time. It took like 40 minutes to get my food and the pasta sauce tasted like it was canned. I could have microwaved better food in my room.
Friendly, casual atmosphere with very tasty pizza.  Huge variety of toppings and an excellent olive oil base.  I find the pizzas with tomato sauce to be a little bland, but all of the rest have been fantastic.  Salads are huge and fresh.
Best pizza in ahwatukee hands down. It's also the kind of place that reminds me of home which is a great compliment.
I really  like NYPD food and service. Don't sit on the patio though, they forget about you out there. I was disgusted and left from the lack of service out there. I did eventually come back because I like their food.
Crispy thin crust, and fresh flavorful ingredients.  Very highly recommended if you want a good quality pizza.
I gave this place 5 stars in the past but I have changed my mind since new owners have taken over.  They have raised their prices and you can only get one flavor for the kid size, which you used to be able to get two.  Thumbs down!
I wish I could give them 10 stars. The service is always top notch and I love the Chimi's
Best Pho in Phoenix and the best price.  No place better and no place cheaper.  Me an My wife go back again and again. Very Very Very good.  12 - 14 dollars two people with water as drink. you can't beat that.
Really Good Vietnamese food! Good Service. I always order the same. Pho Soup, egg noddle, seafood style.
I really like that the free weights are separated from the treadmill area. pool is nice trainers are great too. I usually go after work and its never too crowded. they also have some great spin classes.
As a partner in the property management industry, I have to say that this property has already seen so many positive changes in the past few weeks.  The staff is very welcoming and it has become one of my favorite places to visit.
Good simple American Italian food. Prices are great. Service is pretty fast. \nAvoid Wednesday night as it's Lowery organ test night. Loud old-time music. Not sure why.
A most unexpected gem! If you are a wine drinker, fabulous flights! Great selection! I can't say much more other than... AWESOME!
Good Pizza,Calzones nothing exceptional.Shopping center wine bar.
Everytime I order here or stop in and eat it's been great food. The only thing is the service there is really hit and miss so ill give a 4 overall. 5 on food and 3 on service
Food was okay, my rice was good but my flautas were super greasy and not very flavorful... The best thing about the experience was probably the bean dip and chips. But I've still had better
Extremely poor customer service - the owner lied to me when I came to pick up my clothing and it wasn't ready. That was after calling the night before and getting attitude for inquiring before he originally said it would be ready. There's nothing special about this place.
The tacos here are street style, which means that they are muy tiny.  I have been here around 4 or 5 times and they are always overloaded with cilantro.  Customer service is very good however.
I really like the convenience of drive thru Starbucks, but this one has a traditional vibe that makes me want to get out of my car. They are friendly and always get my drink right.
Great coffee and snack selection.  They are friendly and efficient.  I usually end up here more than I expect because Einstein Bagels next door tends to let me down, so I walk right over here and they consistently great.
Hands down... I love this place. They  have everything! Lots and lots of variety from imported goodness to the freshest produce. A chef's dream? yes, I believe so. \nI can always find what I need here.
yes it smells but when I've been here I just imagine traveling to all the countries, ,depths and dark places to get all the things they have here.
international az
Sushi is first rate, the fish is so fresh! Loved the albacore,  tried beef toungue, DELICIOUS! Must come back and try the hot dishes.... Hard to find real Japanese food, so glad we found this!
Al does some seriously good fish - get ya sum!!!
Great slides for the three year old; haven't had a service issue, beyond typical fast food worker apathy.\nOil needs to be chaned in the fryer. :-P
You get what you pay for.  Well, I got what they paid for.
I do not believe how this place got the rating that it has. I got burnt, over cook shumai, precooked and dried out chicken.  Food is bad to go along with the unhelpful order taker.  I will not be back.
They would not even bother calling me back about getting a quote. Had to call three times to see what the deal was. Receptionist was very nice but apparently Dennis is a bum. Can't attest to any work since I was apparently not worth calling back.
It is Startbucks. Just like in your neighborhood.
Ice cream was soft and not creamy like it used to be. Way over priced
Nice icecreams with a huge amount of alternatives. Nice place to grab an icecream when in the mall. Had the donought - one. Overall good place
A fun stop on a long road.
Horrible and liars.  I asked them to not run my credit and wouldn't sign a info sheet. A few days later I checked my credit and their was a hard inquiry from them. We will spread the word about their dishonest practices and of course never buy from them.
Horrible wait time. Waited almost an hr to get help. Just to make a payment! workers are super slow. Sprint service sucks and obviously the stores/workers also, exactly why we went to tmobile instead!
I love this place! The staff is amazing and always makes you feel at home. I'm obsessed with their breakfast burritos. And the biscuits and gravy? Amazing!
Great selection, as one would exxpect from a Bath and Body Works.\n\nBut even better than that, great people.  They are always so helpful.  I will always come to this location.
I like the Cheesecake Factory menu, but the portions, calories, and sodium and fat counts are really too much. I like their happy hour, however.
I've been 2 times here and both had a good ending. I enjoy what I order, which is mainly sushi and some of their pasta dishes. Good service and nice environment.
Great service.. Friendly staff!!!!
It's nice to have kids build a bear. Unique and kids seem to love it . Expensive! We are going to do it one more time for our kid , that's it!
While they have delicious food, seating is very limited and they are MUCH too slow in cleaning the tables. Too many customers standing around looking for a place to sit and eat.
Great place for mexican food if your white and never had homemade. Just like Seranos or any other chain, plus its more expensive.
Love their chips and salsa's, sangria swirl margaritas are delicious too! Great happy hour and service!
Food is delicious, but agree with other reviewers. You don't get much for what you pay. Way too pricey!
I usually come out here after the lunch hour rush. You would think its slow enough that you can be seated immediately. Not. 3 stars is all i can give.
Drove by, they are closed :(
Scale of 1-10 (multiple visits):\n8 Food\n8 Service\n8 Atmosphere\n7 Value
Wonderful service.  Wonderful food.  Pf Chang never disappoints.   One of the best Hot n Sour soups ever.  Lettuce wraps are great.  All entres were excellent.  A great experience.  Thanks Stefanie for the nice service.
I really think this has the best ramen I have ever had. Service is surprisingly great, considering how packed it is every time I am here. Whenever someone come in town, I always suggest this place
I have been going to The Keg Steak House now ever since they first opened. I have enjoyed everything from the ambiance  to the wonderful food and the servers are great. I highly recommend this restaurant. Alot of quality for the price.
Pork egg rolls have about as much pork as the vegetable spring rolls...not much.  Nothing like the advertisement.
Food was ok the burritos come with just meat nothing else. So if you order the chicken burrito you are going to get a tortilla filled with shredded chicken. Their floutas were good I would go back for them especially with their salsa.
The green tamales are delicious! LOVE THEM.
Great pizza and wings !! get delivery from here at least 3 times a month definitely recommend it
Sat for 20 minutes and never got served. Crabby Don's should be Crappy Don's. Left for Mexican restaurant across the street.
Awesome food
Dr. Driggers is amazing. I have two Uromastyx who he has examined and I wouldn't trust their care to anyone else. No complaints.
I tried the white pizza and picnic sandwich.  The pizza was the best white pizza I've had anywhere, and the sandwich was very fresh.  I look forward to trying breakfast here.
The place gets pretty crowded. The people working there were friendly. I tried one of their favorites - Picnic with sweet potato salad. The sandwich was very good. The salad on the other hand was simply too salty to go with the sandwich.
Great food, always fresh and innovative items on the menu. The staff is very friendly and attentive to what's going on. I also like that much of their produce comes from local sources.
Kristen and the rest of the Liberty Market staff were so friendly! All the food looks unreal, atmosphere is fantastic, even down to the bathrooms. Definitely stop by if you're in the area.
Hands down can not get enough! Atmosphere, food, employees, and location! one word BOMB!!!
Get fuel here! Yay!
A good place for kids. There is a play area. The pizza was not very bland/generic. If you want good pizza this is not the place.
Zero knowledge about insurance billing and general office procedures. Office manager argues and has a bad attitude. I would not recommend this place, nor will I ever schedule another appointment. Go to Lenscrafters if you have Tricare/United Healthcare.
Love this little Mexican burrito shack! The carnesada is good! I love the beans and rice too!
Best burritos I've ever tasted from NV to AZ! Seriously can't find anywhere comparable
Everyone should eat here if they want to get really bad Food Poisoning and almost die!!!!
Great Family owned place to get all of your BBQ supplies!
The food is excellent and the delivery service is outstanding.  They handle everything with a smile. We've eaten our way through the menu and haven't found anything that wasn't good.
I have been going to Connie for about 10 years and she has always been corteous and her prices are very resonable.  I go to her for watch repairs, band replacement, batteries and I got my ring resized.  I would definitely recommend Connie to my family and friends.
play it.
Very spacious and clean. They have two train that ride around the park. I think I like riding on it even more than my daughter! They also have a carousel, two playgrounds and two snack shops. I rate this the number 1 park in Phoenix!
Took my nieces here a few weeks ago. Great place for kids of all ages. Very inexpensive too so that was a bonus.
Amazing happy hour! Spendy but not at happy hour.
I stumbled across this place while looking for lunch. Great hole in the wall, everything looked delicious. I had the gyro, not too shabby.
I don't think I saw an employee for the first 10 minutes I was in there. Once I basically ran into one he was helpful.
Very similar to Filibertos in price and quality. Good with mass quantity. The place is small, and pretty simple.
eaten here for 10 years, best sushi ever, fair prices and very nice people
Place has great food! Service was slow due to how busy it was but well worth the wait.\n\nHighly recommended place for breakfast!
Coming from Michigan which has one or two outstanding Deli's, Chompie's was a huge disappointment.  Their corned beef was lousy compared to Vienna brand.  Their prices are beyond ridiculous.  I will continue my search for a good Jewish Deli in Arizona.
I really like the food here - it's well prepared with quality ingredients. Not much on atmosphere (unless you like dining on picnic benches under the glow of florescent lighting), so it's best to call ahead and take it home with you.
Houstons is my favorite spot for lunch. Great wine list when it's not a business lunch. Sounds silly but get the chicken tenders, they will not disappoint. A child's dish done in an adult manner. The service is always great.
I prefer \"All About Tennis\" but SA gets a thumbs up for having a decent selection of Tennis-related gear, having wide-size tennis shoes in stock, XL size socks (these are shockingly hard to find), plus it's really close to home and the club.
Waiting in line to pick up ROC Race packet for 50 minutes so far and still not there yet. You would think that Sports Authority, a sponsor, would help organize packet pick up so the participants had more time to shop!
I talked to the owner to request a 1 hour donation to deliver a cake for a 4 year old little girl in hospice. The owner was extremely rude and claimed that he gave to charity often and doubted the validity of my story. I would not recommend this place to anyone.
I just had to drop a note to say just how nice it was to have fast, clear and strong Wi-Fi in my room.\nWhomever handles that for your place is doing great work.
I love this place! Great croissants, soup, and dessert! They are known for their delicious chocolate chip cookies!
We bought two cameras from Lauren. She knew we didn't live there, we were on vacation. She was patient and really went long on the set up and tips. Very engaging, this is our camera place when we are in Arizona!
Great neighborhood Deli, Bring cash, great food
Every time I've been to this Denny's the service is horrible. I tried it a few times because the first time I went was later in the night so I thought if give it another shot but every time I've gone nothing has changed.
One of our favorite restaurants in Scottsdale.  The food is very good but the service is outstanding (especially the lady who often serves as the hostess - high energy, always smiling)
Decent breakfast and service. Cute little restaurant. The fresh squeezed orange juice was amazing!
Best eyecare office in Arizona! Customer Service is best in breed and products are A rated. Highly recommended
They do a good job and they will come back out to retreat if you see any bugs.  From time to time I have needed them to come back because of scorpions which they gladly do.  I have used them since I moved into my house in 2001 and their prices seems fair.
This place is pretty damn good. The egg rolls and crab puff was amazing. I wasn't sure if this place was any good but we decided to try it out anyway and I'm glad that we did! We will definitely be ordering from here again!
Had an appointment to get liquid gel nails done.  The lady who did my nails was very rude and I didn't like how they turned out. I tired to communicate with her but was ignored.  Will not return,  would not recommend.
Highly recommend this place! Clean, friendly and pretty quick in getting you seated. Ask for Tommy, he always does a fantastic job.
Be sure to call before driving there...the website claims they are open until 5pm but there wasn't a sign of life when I showed up at 4:30 :( I'm sure the cookies are delicious, but I did not get the opportunity to make a purchase.
I have been going to Top Nails for years and can't imagine going anywhere else! I love, love, love them, Highly recommend them!
I love this place, great food and atmosphere, but on my last visit wasn't impress with new addition to menu
Bartender service is supposed to be fast and attentive.  At the bar and he decided to read the paper instead of pay attention to anyone. Blah.
Great menu and good food!
It was ok...Nothing special.  I ordered an italian sub, and it was served on a bun/roll...not the Italian bread that I'm used to.  I should have just gone to Jimmy Johns.
This place is absolutely disgusting. Dirty, dirty, dirty. I'd rather pay to sleep in my car. Also, the staff is very rude.
After leaving Jos. A Banks across the parking lot where there were no coats in my size (54), I met with Stewart who happily showed me a nice selection in my size and with buy 1 get 1 free, they are tailoring both now.  Good job and great service.
The rooms are very so so and the hospitality was non existent, I will not be going back!,
Nice hotel and friendly staff.  A nice place to get away for a few days.
wow!  such a beautiful place!  from the golf course to the bars and outside patio, it's great.  We went there for Infusioncon and it was awesome!
best ever massage I have ever had! xoxoxo
best place to buy shoes
Just the worst. Owner was ranting in the back and humiliating his staff. So nasty and so rude.
Fresh and good but the actual hot dog on the Chicago dog tastes like one from the grocery store. Meets the craving for Chicago but not completely.
I loved this place before I even got in the front door. Very good prices, and well organized.  The owner is so friendly.  It seemed like every item of fabulous clothing I picked up was on sale for half price.  I am definitely a regular now!!!
Great selection, clean, and good prices.  Nice jewelry selection too.
Tried to have a romantic dinner at this place with m y wife. Food was great, but the service not so good. Rude wait staff. Maybe a Jersey thing?? but I'm from Jersey and wasn't feeling the love...
I feel like Ra is too focused on social and not sushi. Good for groups, and decent happy hour prices. Lots of cute waitresses too.
The sushi at RA is beyond amazing!  I eat sushi about 3 times a week and if I could eat at RA evertime, I WOULD!  Happy Hour rocks and there's some really awesome stuff on the HH menu!  Absolutely love it!
Warm, friendly ....  nice and reliable and conveniently located inside PV Mall.
If you want a perfectly baked bagel, NY Bagels 'n Bialys has the best. They have a large menu to satisfy any breakfast craving and offer fast service. A great breakfast restaurant.
Food was authentic and yummy. It was very inexpensive and you can bring your own wine!! What a concept. No cork fees either.
This store always looks like a bomb went off. Every time I visit this location it is unorganized, messy, and it smells weird. The messiness makes it very difficult to find things, which can be really frustrating.
Beautiful campus!! First time attending and have the pleasure of having two exemplary  professors.  This school has a great culinary arts programs as well as an awesome hospitality program!!\n\nLove it!
A bit of an older b&n but it has all the essentials.  Good, clean store and friendly employees make the experience even better.
Went here once for labwork.  My wife had something down the street to tend to.  No one was there, and it was only me that Friday morning.  I was in and out in 7 minutes.  Too bad this place is now closed :-(!!!
They finally closed. I believe this was the first A.J.'s in Arizona......and the past few years it slowly went downhill.
had a pedi and gel mani done today! absolutely will be coming back :) everyone was so nice and the prices are perfect. \nvery very clean as well!
They did a great job. They got us right in, they have massage chairs, they were very good.  They gave us bottled water. My daughter got a flower on each of her big toes and there was no extra charge even with a jewel on it.
I have a food allergy and they had no idea how to prepare my food safely. The worst chipotle I've been to in any state.
Terrible Service... It took a few minutes just to be greeted by the Host.\nFood was ok...
Horrible service and gave our food to another table
Great sandwiches.  My kids love the pizza and soda fountain with the numerous options.
These guys are great! Kelly and mark are always professional and I always refer my customers to them.  Especially for classic cars. But, they do all makes body shop repairs! Thanks guys for helping me out! See you next time my truck needs fixed.
Great service here....the crew does a great job!
Food was great!  We went back a few more times since November.  I'm very glad Al's fixed the issues that they were having and went back to very good food again.
I do enjoy the italian bread here, but there isn't enough meat, cheese or topping to enjoy it! I definitely hate to say it but subway is just on the NW corner off the 101 and Shea. Its pretty expensive and not very loaded with toppings.
Sub par. The service, the ambiance, the menu. The best part about Zipps is the - albeit limited - selection of draft beer! If you just need a casual hang-out spot for a happy hour, this place will do just fine.
I only come her for Kiwanis Club of Scottsdale McCormick's weekly meeting.  Never played on-site or use any of their other facility other than the small banquet room facing the fountain area.  Overall service was good, but they do indeed need to improve their facilities.
Pool is in major need of renovation! Bugs everywhere in pool too. Very filthy.
I am always pleased at Galileo's. The food is phenomenal and you can't find better service anywhere else. The owners are amazing because they really make you feel welcomed and right at home.
This place is comparable to Buca di Beppo.\n\nDefinitely for the masses.
Good, solid pizza place with lots of charm and great service. Really good salads too.\n\nGreat place to go for a birthday -- the warm chocolate chip cookie w/ ice cream is sinful. Loved it!
WARNING !!!  this location is worse than any used car lot I ever visited.  Had to cancel three times before they finally stopped billing me.  Good therapists and good massage but HoRRiBLE business ethics,  DO NOT give them your credit card or checking info
They wanted 30 dollars to hem a apron..when I told them that's too expensive they told me I can go somewhere else and gave me my apron. Don't like to give bad reviews to little shops but it was upsetting
The pizza was very good.  The service was very friendly.\n\n The outdoor deck upstairs is a nice touch that makes it a more pleasant place to eat and the decor was a hit with our children.\n\nGood place to grab a pizza.
Terrible pizza. As a relatively new arizona transplant, I had been looking for a great local pizza joint. These guys charge restaurant prices for horrible rubbery SAMs club quality pizza. $30 for shit pizza. Don't waste your money.
WOW! I normally wouldn't review a gas station but this place is so bad I felt it warranted it. The angle of the lanes is absurd and it seems everyone there is pissed about something.
The idiot oil change kid tried to charge me $79.95 for an oil change that I got at Honda for $29.95. Told me my
The price was way too high for an average car wash at $13 for the basic wash.
Terrible customer service. High prices. Careless employees inside and out. I won't be back!
Evan's awesome. Great at figure skates, fitting, mounting, etc. My daughter LOVES him AND her new skates!
Seems a little small and cramped.  Location is ok, prices cheap.  Salesmen have a weird vibe- you can tell they have so many ulterior motives than to actually provide real customer service.
Decent and cheap haircut with friendly stylists. They cut me a little shorter than I would have liked but pretty good for $14.
I am not as big a fan of this place as some of the other rook your burrito chains but this particular location has the fattiest chicken and on 2 occasions the food here has made me sick.
Slowest chipotle I have ever been to. Watching people leave after standing in line so long. It's like this every time I come. Today thought if would not be bad ad there were only about 5 people ahead of me but it'd still forever.
Arriba's was not as good as they used to be, apparently the original owner passed away and its under new ownership. Won't be coming back here again.
I'm not a fan.  Pretty average burrito.
If you get the 1/2 size Nacos it is the perfect amount. Not the best place drinks wise if you are not a beer person... then again it is a brewery. I am just unable to drink beer due to allergies. So some more drink specials would be appreciated.
Decent spot, about what you would expect from a brew-pub.  This was my first time trying Four Peaks beers and I thought they were ok.  The food was your typical pub far, but much better quality.  The hummus stood out.  Would definitely return if in the area.
They microwave the eggs and meat and didn't have any bagels at left at 9am.  Won't be returning, though the service was ok.
We went in again and this time on what I have to consider one of their busiest times, Sunday mid morning for brunch. The service was fast and flawless!\n\nWildflower and Louis you convinced me! 5 stars!
If you believe bread makes a great sandwich, you will want to check out this place. I had the sausage and egg sandwich on 9 grain toasted. You could taste the fresh ingredients that all worked together beautifully. I will be back.
I love Wildflower and frequently visit. My favorite thing on the menu is the seasonal Tuscan Kale salad! \n\nThis location gets very busy for lunch so I call ahead and my food is always ready for me when I arrive.
Everyone here is wonderful.  Make no mistake this is no nationwide vision or Lenscrafters.  The doctors hear are very knowledgeable and down to earth.  I drive 45 minutes to go here.
Exellant food! Inexpensive lunch buffet ( like 8.95). Friendly staff. Best beans and rice anywhere! Not much more to ask for. Food portions are inconsistant, I think it depends on who's cooking.
So the waiter brought a me cheese enchilada and chicken taco even though I ordered a beef enchilada and chicken taco I informed him of this and he looked at me in the face and asked me if I wanted a side of beef.  I will not be back
Love scottsdale quarter and this store by far has the best semi annual sale selection. Organized, clean and I got wall flowers for $2 refills what a huge reflection will be back! A great asset to the shopping center!
Very friendly staff. Store smells awesome. Wife loves it. Do I need to say more?
We have used Target Optical on and off over the years depending upon our insurance coverage. In the beginning, I was very skeptical about using a eye doctor in a clothing/food retailer but in the end they won me over with their service and prices. Nice job!
Hadn't been here in years!  The views are fabulous and the band was great.  Beer was cold, food was really over priced!  Lower your prices and improve the service, please.
I don't write reviews, but I had to so that people would know this place is NOT a 4 star worthy Chinese restaurant.
Good on the usual suspects but other than that don't get too crazy on the others.    Service not good
Will never go to this place again.  Gross is an understatement.  Had to send my dish back as it made McDonalds look good.  Strange atmosphere.  Don't reallyfeel like going on about this place as it sucked.  Just don't go.
Agree with earlier review from Greg except service was worse than poor and entree was hot, but sides were cold; obviously sat on plate waiting for entree. Restrooms are located in the hotel lobby, nowhere near restaurant; needed a tour guide to get there! Terrible experience!
Juice bar does not wash the produce. I asked why and they said since its organic we don't wash it.. Be careful or insist that they wash the produce.. This is a health hazard and extremely dangerous for the elderly and children.
Amazing choices. Friendly staff.
This place isn't classy and has a Ross in it for crying out loud!! But...I am en love with Fredrick's of Hollywood!!! You won't find a Nordstrom in this mall.
It's ok. Prices or not cheaper than regular prices.
Not the greatest mall in the valley, but also not the worst! Decent selection of outlet stores and an ok food court. They recently added an aquarium which I think will add to the appeal. It's a shame that they closed Gameworks.
Riva's has great food, large quantities for low, low prices.  They're open 24 hours a day w/a drive through...I eat here at least once a week!
Had the mini eclair and cannoli and unfortunately it was nothing noteworthy.  They aren't located in a fun area and the business seems to focus on decorative wedding cakes.  However the person who helped us was super friendly!
Love the meals they Are the best sea food in the Arizona area
Downhill is the key word - I don't know what happened to this particular location but I am shocked they stay open. The crab cakes are abysmal and just about everything else is at best mediocre. Spare yourself and go elsewhere.
Same Kyoto bowl, in fact it was a time warp going in.  I had not been to one in years, looks the same, but well worn.  Food is still good, but a bit pricey for what you get.
Val and Bill are the bomb! Great friendly service and fresh delicious food! Chorizo made on site!
I took my cousin here to get her phone serviced. The greeter had no idea what he was doing. 20 minutes later we got some service but that was questionable as well.  Instead of replacing the phone they supposively fixed it but guess what......nope!
The Streamliner (veggie) burger and Grilled Chicken Breast Sandwich were good, but the shakes are out of this world!!  They stole the show.  I got the Strawberry Banana and my friend got the Orange Dreamsicle! YUM!
So Indie its going to make me drive to Tempe lol Love the vibe here. Reminds me of The Jamaican Blue that use to be in Scottsdale. Good mix of a crowd, indie, punk, 70s sounds. Its great
My fav all time coffee destination in Tempe. It's a fabulous place to do homework and socialize.
I found Dr. Waring not particularly attentive to my needs as a patient.
My favorite Mongolian BBQ joint in the Phoenix area. HUGE HUGE portions, the only place where they let you smash the meat with wax paper, so much sauce and even the side bar is delicious. DO IT and I dare you to finish everything in your bowl.
This place is missing one key ingredient:  Flavor.
This place is great and the service is outstanding. I had never been here before and the manager personally helped me. I will definitely return
Good food. OK prices. Just hope you never have a problem you want resolved because the management is no help whatsoever. You can't expect much from someone who manages a grocery store though.
Great layout.  It almost seemed like their bar had different venues.  Great food & selection of beers too.\n\nI was amazed how awesome the service was.  We went on a really busy night.
Back to the sweet tomatoes we know and love, but the updated dishware and decor remain for a classier feel. Recommended!
Havent had any problems (lost or damaged clothes...) with them.  My stuff is always ready when they say it will be and it always comes out looking sharp.  Good place with reasonable pricing.
I love this little coffee shop. Amidst all of the commercial coffee places around, this seems down to earth and unassuming.  The barista is always friendly.  I like to support local businesses and would, by far, support Gold Bar than Starbucks located across the parking lot.
oh my god worst pizza I've ever had. Tasted worse than school cafeteria pizza. Ordered a small at 2 bites and immediately stopped eating. DISGUSTING
Love Wendy's new salads and burgers. This was my first visit to this particular location and I found it to be very clean. I felt bad for the guy running the cash register because no one was helping him but he was very polite.
The wife and I stopped here for a bite and beer and was surprised. The steaks we ordered were huge and very tasty. Overall good beer selection and great service from Robin made foe a great evening.
Great pizza at a good price.  It isn't exactly like the Chicago style that I had in Chicago (an upside down pizza), but it is the closest I have found in the valley.
I hate myself every time I wind up shopping here. Having to lock up my purse, indifferent staff, high prices....  plus they carry very little sterling and charge through the nose for what they do have.
Generous portions and good sweet and sour shrimp but nothing extraordinary about their fried rice or lo mein
Went in on a Groupon, food was good but also greasy, but not enuff for me to go out of my way to eat there. \nWent there at lunch, it was dead, but yet took forever to get our food.
Best Mexican Food in the valley!!!  Yummmmmmy!!!!!!  Super nice family!!!!
Amazing service! I just moved to Arizona and my A/C went out, took my car in and they had it fixed the same day! The price was very affordable and Victor and the staff were very professional, definitely sticking with this shop for all my car repairs!
I don't know where everyone was but this is a rad little place. Pretty good food, cheap beers and quite delicious. Very personable staff as well. I enjoyed my visit.
1 star from the vegan perspective, as they use whey (an animal protein) in most of their breads, including their white and wheat sub breads. Please drop the whey (and all other animal products) from your breads!
Ted's is hands down my favorite place to eat hotdogs! Go during lunch hour and you may be standing in line for a little while but it's well worth the wait. Great service along with great food and decent portions, you can't go wrong.
Disappointed as I was told this was one of the BEST hot dogs ever.  We got an all beef and white hot.  Not the worse hot dogs we've had but not the best.  They do however have REALLY GOOD onion rings!
Really, the appeal is the view, which is fantastic.  The food was ok.  The atmosphere was ok.
The fried chicken wings are good.  The rest?  Below par Chinese MSG.  I might get some wings sometime, but the rest of the food is below mediocre.
Excellent prices and the people working there are friendly. CLEAN inside unlike other Mexican rest's in the area. The taste of the food is at top game and love eating at this place!
Was in there picking up my items as the older guy sat there talking trash about their customers. Also overheard in his conversation was a threat to take them outside and beat them up for complaining - as I looked at my messed up stitching... Will never go there again.
Also went here and there phos free is 60 and everywhere else is 29.99. Wayyyy overpriced
Nice, clean, friendly, and close to home.  And they don't charge a fortune.  Can't complain!  I'll be back :)
I would not go back to this place, even though it is close. It looks run down and dirty inside, both in the waiting areas and exam rooms. I did not feel very confident in the skills or assessment done by the doctor or the staff. It seemed quick and not very thorough.
This place is ok
Best gym ever. They have so much here its crazy. If you want a gym that more than just a \"gym\" come here. I have been with my personal trainer Max for a year and love it. \n\nI would highly recommend to anyone.
The GM at the Tempe location is absolutely horrible and has no clue what he's doing.. He's a baffoon and was supposed to be fired a long time ago
I've been going to Lani for a while and she is always laughing and smiling. She makes you feel comfortable right away. She has great prices and you can tell she cares a lot. I wouldn't go anywhere else!
I went to Just For You to get a wax and I was SO nervous! I saw Tamye and she made me feel so comfortable.  I was pleasantly surprised at how painless it was.  She was so amazing and I'll definitely be back.  Thank you so much Tamye!!
Great place for big meals @ a great price!
Great service, fast lunch on a work day.
down grading to a one star due to the fact that I have had a few people email me on here letting me know they too have gotten sick from this place! Eat at your own risk! Don't say I didn't warn you
Make your bowl. The place was big and clean. Very polite staff.
This used to be the best pizza in the valley.  The last two times we went we were disappointed.  The first time the pepperoni had no flaver.  This last time the italian sausage had no flavor.  The basic pizza is still good.
I got food poisoning after eating at this location, I almost went to the hospital after about 12hrs of vomiting and diarrhea. I will NEVER eat Arby's again
what a messy place! If you want to look a good bargain you have to look carefully because everything is chaos! Even Big Lots has more order. Not worth my time.
DO NOT GO HERE!  Watch out - they will ruin your clothes and then give you the biggest, most expert run around you can ever imagine if you try to get them to replace them.  The owner is a blatant lier and she will rip you off.
It's a chain, so I know the food is decent. I'm mostly turned off by the fact that I couldn't come here to watch a baseball game. No sports package at a popular burger place? I'll be going elsewhere for dinner.
Disgusted by server who goes by the name of \"Mike\" and how he served my children!!!!!!!!
Service was excellent by Jessica & Emily in the bar! Very disappointed that they don't offer anything for our Veteran's, being that it is Memorial Day weekend.. Take care of our Veteran's and I'll give  but only one star for now!!!
This place is nasty. A have friends who recently contracted food poison from their bone in wings. Someone in that kitchen isn't cooking food right. I'll never go back. Drive to a different location.
Loved the stadium recliner seats - this is a super KID-friendly area and the theatre was packed with the wee ones. Good if you're in the parent zone, but if you're not....
I had a great pedicure and it was only $20! My tech took a really long time making my nails look great, so I felt like I got my money's worth.  Only complaint is that they could use some new chairs.
They got great service but they have slow wifi download rate......down is 1.10 mps and up is 0.60 mps .... That sucks... Lol
At nails of the world they actually care about u as a person. They do great work & my polish never peals. They are Always friendly. I've been going there for a couple years now & I would recommend nails of the world to anyone of my friends & family.
It's a Target. You know the drill. Clean, well stocked, good prices. I'm a regular.
Always a great place to bring our little one (4 years old) Games are Fun, pizza is always great. Prices haven't changed much over the years. Highly recommend for anytime of day and any occasion.
This place has really good halal kohbedays.  However they close pretty early and are not even open on Sunday's . There hours are M-S 11-9.
What can I say.... This is hands down one of the best places to eat!  Visit probably once a week and always request the same waiter.  Service is great, food is excellent, prices are perfect!
Their green chile burritos are great! Enough for my husband and I to share too. Really love the chips and salsa! Better than many other places!
I do not give 1 star reviews lightly, but this business is beyond unprofessional.  Their business practices seem to change with the mood of the owner, and it is the customers who suffer.
Having car problems is already bad enough. Labor was expensive but expected for a franchise. Customer service on the other hand was awful.
Not bad, a little oily. Not sure that I like it. Might have to try it again.
It's pretty standard chain. Service leaves A LOT to be desired and you'll definitely find better.\n\nTurnaround is quick though and I don't spend a ton of time in the area so it's a quick go to that's right there.
Trashy dive bar,.gross skanky waitresses who think they are hot,mediocre food, terrible service, only good thing is cheap drinks during happy hour.Also rude doorman.Not worth it.
The pool looks nicer than it used to. Music still sucks.
Please update your hours on Yelp. We stopped by to get something framed at 5:32pm and you were closed even though it said 6pm on Yelp.
an absolute atrocity to all that is good and edible. you will see bundt cake straight from KFC. and what is up with the sushi roll with strawberries in it?!
$13.83 for a Tosted mac & cheese No meat.... but they charge like if it had shrimp!   I won't order this again. .. over priced, small portion,  and it's not even the best I ever had.
The sushi was not at all good. The service was on the poor side. Our one and only visit was not enjoyable.
Nothing special, really.  The prices were great, especially the $5 Sake Bomber special.  But overall, the food was just not sexy at all.
Eh - not bad...but not anything to write home about.
Wife and daughter ate here and got food poisoning. They had the shrimp lo mein. Beware!
I love this place - I was so happy to finally find a decent restaurant in the West Valley.  Love that its a local business.  Pizza is great and I've heard so many great reviews about the rest of the menu.  Great casual local neighborhood restaurant!  Great customer service and prices too!
The cheapest, most tasteless mexican food I've ever had. Very greasy,\nhorrible cheese.
Any type of fresh bagel and bagel sandwich you can think of. They are always fresh and use only boars head meats and cheeses. New York style deli that is simply delicious.
Superb bagel just wish they would cut back on the salt. Then I could patronize them more often.
If you're craving for bagels or breakfast, you need to go here and eat every / any bagel you can think of.
We went here for lunch while on vacation.  The food was great and the portions were quite large.  3 of us at for $30 plus tip.
Had some calamari tempura and a couple sushi rolls. Nothing was bad, but nothing was particularly memorable either. All of the staff was extremely pleasant.
Best creamy chicken pesto pasta I have had in a while.  Steak and pesto is also an option.  Great atmosphere and lighting.  Fast service and bread is to die for.  A nice Italian eatery in a Safeway shopping center.
It's hard to get pasta wrong. Its also hard to stick out. Babbo does neither. A distinctly average yet affordable dining option located north of the 101 loop. They have lunch specials and decent pizza and wine.
Went early tonight, Wed., to beat the crowd but we beat the main cook. Salad was wilted, main course lacked flavor other than the taste of the scorched vegetables. Our previous visit was just ok but this was our last visit.
Incredibly rude service from Andrea on Sept. 13. Clearly annoyed I was\n\"interrupting her\" to make my purchase. I will not use this location ever again.
Worst store I've ever been to. They never have anything in stock, they refuse to honor discounts, and they have the rudest staff I've ever encountered. Hope this place goes out of business.
Don't bother if you care about customer service. One stylist for the entire place resulted in two walkouts in 20 minutes. Amateur hour.
So now that I've been here multiple times, I must say that the rude worker was probably having an off day. Every time I've been in here everyone has been super helpful, it's always clean & everyone is friendly. LOVE TJ's!!
The sushi rolls are kinda thin. I heard a lot of good things about this place. I only found it to be ok. I was not that impressed. I'd go again but it wouldn't be my first choice.
No stars! Walk to the restroom and see the salsa and so called bean dip sitting on the counter with the dirty dishes and other cleaning equipment. I should have left then. Seriously on the cusp of calling the health dept on them.
We love going to this restaurant for lunch or dinner.  The chips, margaritas and food are Deliciouso'
Was a big fan until yesterday. Hot sauce used to be the best, now just tasted like tomato sauce. Food was awful, they're only excuse was that they are training new chefs. Sadly, we will not go back.
Huge selection of beers.. Ambiance is also great.. food is awesome....try the chicken nachos...just awesome !
I really like shopping here.  The clearance racks have some great finds at decent prices.  It is the only section I would buy from (well other than the skin care counters) though, cuz prices are steep in my opinion everywhere else in the store.
service is ok.\nfood is ok...actually really bland and plain. I had the blackened salmon and my parents had the roasted turkey breast.\nchamomile tea is the best.\n\ngood luck.
Good, small portions. Pricey for simple foods. Nice environment.
Rude & uninformed staff.   Sales girl did not know what an insurance appraisal was.
The food isn't all that great and the Mac n cheese taste like that cheap powder cheese and the staff act like they where scared to come serve us maybe because of our skin color. The place wasn't very impressive I won't be back. I tried it once that's it.
Place is a joke. Screwed up drive-thru order, food is disgusting, hard, dry. Wont answer phone. Calling MasterCard to do a chargeback.
Stopped on the way to Payson.\n\nI was hoping for a good traditional down-home breakfast. What I got was denny's quality
Breakfast is all pre-cooked.  Ham boiled.  Ordered bacon well but it comes however it is cooked prior.  No special orders here.  Not that cheap either.  Just fast, that's all!
Only reason they get two stars is because their pies are great. Terrible service and don't have enough people working so it takes half an hour to get anyone to even acknowledge that you are waiting.
Today this cafe suck for customer service.. The wait staff is clueless on the customer experience. The food is okay but there better choices up the road.
The worst fries I've ever had! The best pulled pork Reuben. The banana cream pie needs bananas in it or else it is just a cream pie. The crust was non existent! Overall disappointed dining experience!
Every time I go here there is always something wrong with my order always check your food before you leave I guarantee you will always be missing something or something ain't right.
I've been here twice now and I'm not very impressed.  The service is slow and even when there is clearly no one else in the restaurant.  The food wasn't much better, it was ok, but a bit expensive for what you get.
We loved this place a few years ago, but great food is on the menu but exiting the kitchen. Both of us here and I eat alone.
Decent food that you'd expect from a local restaurant that specializes in Mexican food. In short nothing to write home about...
I love eating there breakfast here. Country boy is my fav. Love the steak and hash brown casserole. My order was almost perfect except i got wheat bread not white, i don't like wheat but no big deal. Mike my server was great, friendl, and nice
The staff was friendly and accommodating. I had an arrangement made for my grandma. After I left I looked at the flowers and some of the roses edges were dried/dead. I think the flower arrangement was over priced for what you what you got. :-(
I dare you to find a better burger, chili or steak for the price. I love this place. It has a Grain Belt bar light. Need I say more?
Our waitress was a grouchy bitch, and there was no fresh OJ, but other than that it was OK.  Loved the sign at the register that read \"No Open Carry\" of weapons.  Hahaha!  I was concealing, anyway...
Jerry with Time Saver is a true professional. Honest, relaiable and has the experience most people only dream about. \n\nYou will not be sorry you called Time Saver for your plumbing needs.
Awesome place all around!
*  Very dirty dinning area!!\n*  Employees obviously do not care about customer service \n*  McDonalds should pull their affiliation - very bad representation of the brand
I went here yesterday and ate at Dillion's BBQ, I had a tiny issue with my food and they fixed it instantly and it was perfect. The manager was great with me, and I will defiantly be back
Rode over on our Harley with some friends. We enjoyed a great tasting lunch and a couple brews. Seems be out in the middle of no where... but we like these kind of places. Bet the place is jumping on the weekends, have to make it back some Saturday evening.
We stopped here on tour one time.  And then one time again on the way back.  Had a nice meal, some beers, some shots, hung out for a bit.  Everyone working there was really friendly.  If I'm ever headed through again I'd definitely stop in.
I have been going to the El Dorado Hot Springs for years and always have a relaxing time. Open your minds and give it a try...you won't be sorry\nMakes for a great \"day trip\"....lets relax
Staff here is usually very nice and helpful and not overbearing. Everything is kept nice and tidy. I just feel that this location does lack in variety and sizes...
terrible conditions in prime time of year. mickey mouse layout. skip it.
I have been coming here for years. Best bakery on the west side. Huge variety. I just can't decide what I want when I'm there since everything looks so delectable and fresh.
Absolutely the best customer service ever!!  They always have the best rates and great vehicles.  I would recommend them over and over again!
Ehh its ok!! The location at bell & reems is 10x better!! Better service there & better drinks. This one is okey..
Slowest and most disorganized Starbucks ever! 25 minutes for 2 regular coffees and a pre-made spinach wrap.
In the store today 2 times.....first AND last! I have never experienced such an unfriendly staff & the store is a mess.
Pretty decent location for a nice target store.\nWhen I lived in the area I would frequent this target location and was happy with the service and product selection.\nLocated in the surprise town center shopping district alongside many great shops.
Very good food!! A nice, clean and very friendly place. Prices are reasonable for authentic Mexican food. We have eaten there many times and always look forward to going back.
First arrived and the family a little bored. The staff was nice but the displays need to improve. Great building. Luckily the simulation our family signed up for saved the day. We had a great time with the simulation crew. End if day it all worked out great and family happy.
Call ahead. Eat lots of rolls. Get the double pork chop, and you will be in heaven. \n\nKey is to call ahead.\n\nIve never had a problem here and always loved my food.
food is still good, but the set up is ridiculous, yeah put the soda and ice cream right next to where the soups and pasta are to cause a huge log jam of people. Also had a hair in my salad, not cool.
This Jack's has been closed!  Thank goodness since we got food poisoning from this place!  YUCK!
love the food
Average to poor food. I've had orange chicken, a salad, and chicken enchiladas. They all sucked. They all cost more then they should have.
Super cool bar, friendly staff and very comfortable environment. Drinks and food are both very affordable and delish. Great happy hour specials too. It's s small establishment so it can get busy. But it's always fun no matter what.
It's a good thing that this place is not closer to where I live or I would weigh 400 pounds.
We bought a couple of party trays for my birthday and I have to say, it can feed a whole battalion. Not only was there a lot of food, it was also delicious, as usual. Thank you, Greek Wraps!
The food is amazing here. I've been here a few times and love it every time. I ordered the gryro platter and it comes with a Greek salad and rice. I have to say everything was delicious.
So yummy! I get 1 gyro and order an extra pita. They put enough meat in 1 that you can split into 2!
The prices are a little high and the food is ok. I have had better pizza. The wings where also ok. The people where nice both times we have eaten there.
Have been here to dine a few times. and went for happy hour on a friday night.  Very decent prices and the food is great. The place was busy but we are able to belly up to the bar. Will be back for sure.
Great service, lots of tasty options spinach enchiladas were delicious also chips and salsa they give you are great, the green salsa is my favorite! Will be back to try more.
Two stars just because the chips and salsa are good. But everything else was horrific. It tasted like frozen crap, covered with velveeta cheese. Rice has no flavor and the refried beans were oddly crusty. We will never go back.
Whataburger has a decent burger, but is definitely not one of my favorite places even for fast food. This location hasn't been too busy on the few occasions that I have dined here though, so it has been quick and convenient for me.
You can rarely go wrong here.\n\nLove the chips & salsa!\n\nHave become a big fan of Boneless Buffalo Chicken Salad!
Love the outdoor patio!  The perfect venue for relaxing with music and a cold beer.
Great food.  Very clean.  If you have special dietary needs they are able to accommodate just ask nicely.  Try them you won't be diss appointed.
This subway has terrible service. The food is just ok and the space is not well kept.
Food was bland.  Service was slow.  Screwed up my bill - chased me down in the parking lot to get me to come back to pay more.
It's a Taco Bell and Pizza Hut Express combo, what more could you really ask for?!
I didn't think it was very good. We got the chicken fried rice, paper wrapped chicken, shrimp pad thai & sesame chicken - none of which was really good. The fried rice was horrible. I don't know why this place is so busy.
It's just ok.  At first, the food tasted pretty good, but as we settled into the meal we found it to be quite greasy.  In fact, my wife got sick from the meal while I only had an upset stomach.  I think we'll have to find another place.
After reading the reviews for this place me and my roommate decided to stop by for lunch. The lunch specials are priced very nicely (6 bucks) and the portions are filling. The service was choppy but the woman had her hands full with her baby girl. I would come back.
Great environment and great price. Ask for Zulma or Rachel. Zulma can do a killer fade.
Pretty good pizza.  This place isn't far from my house, so I'll probably go back.  Not as good as my beloved Grimaldi's, but it's plenty good for the price.
My parent's love this place and now, so do I.  It is New York Style pizza (thinner crust and longer slices) very much like we got back home in NY.  Dont let their prices deceive you as it is pretty good!
This is a great hotel. They have an awesome pool. It is in a good location. The maids are always nice and clean the rooms well. The rooms are nice and comfortable. I have come here with my family 3 times and it has always been great.
CLOSED!  AND THE BIG SLIDES REMOVED??\n\nNot sure what is going on here, looks to be some renovations I'll be totally bummed if they lose the big slides.
I got a good haircut and style at a decent price. The girl did what i asked when i showed her a picture. Theres a special right now - 7 foil highlights,cut, dry, waxed brows all for $60!
This Borders closes very early compared to other stores and is always low on stock.  You can never find anybody to help you find something, but the line is short and the clearance section is nice.  The bathrooms are so-so.  The music selection is great and so are the DVDs.
No longer a hand car wash place. I had to drive my own car through. (Guess I have to try the 7 Hills hand car wash place.) This place still has great greeting cards, though!
I just stopped by and the premises were sealed by an eviction order dated 15 June---but then next to it was an order to stay the eviction dated 21 June.  The door was still chained.
Guacamole is made at the table half assed server is rushed and unpleasant. If  I wanted shitty guacamole I could of made it at home for alot cheaper very disappointed I will never go back and it was super expensive for shitty guacamole
We were at the Wildhorse for a fundraiser a few weeks back. The course was in phenomenal shape and the team running the Wildhorse was up to par! We had massive requests in which all were fulfilled with a group of 400. A great place to attend a round or organize an event
Didn't know smogs took an hour
Extremely courteous and expedient. Fixed my tire for no charge. A+
These people have had my business for quite awhile now and they will continue to receive all my business.  From greeting you at the door with a bottle of water to the quickness of service, they excel above all others.  I recommend this place to all.
Never disappointed eating here. Friendly service, hot and fantastic tasting food.  I especially like the spicy chicken bowl.  You can have it with a fountain drink for under $6, what a bargain.\nI want to try their breakfast one day.
Ordered the roast pork menehune. Looked like TV dinner.  Not coming back. The Siamin was horrible.
Very friendly staff. Little to no wait time. Helped me quickly get a replacement bank card when mine came up missing. Very easy to work with.
Bugs in my salad and vomit in the bathroom urinal. After showing the manager the chef came out and half ass apologized and said he's seen worse. Clearly they have high standards...
The only thing that I can say is YUM! I love the pancakes, the waffles and the service.
Clean place, friendly staff. The only negative thing I can say about the place is they typically have 1-2 printers down.
Best place to get a reasonably-priced meal with the freshest ingredients. The place is always clean and the staff very friendly and helpful.
Best gyros I have ever had.  \"thumbs up\"
Fat salad is a fat ripoff.   So is 2.50 for a drink
Sport Chalet only gets two stars from me because they do not carry ammunition which I was looking for on Saturday. I must say though, the staff was very friendly. The gentleman I spoke to did not hesitate to refer me to Dicks Sporting Goods. I appreciate the honesty and lack of excuses.
Register service was not pleasant. I'm not sure if the girl who rang me up just didn't like me, but she was nice to everyone else until I got up to her.
Stevie at the print/copy shop is awesome! She bend over backwards to help me and got me out of there quickly with exactly what I wanted at a price I fully expected.
Hair in my salad. No refills. Didn't ask how my food was or how my steak was cooked. Unpleasant waitress. Need I say more?
Really poor service, I fixed an appointment for test driving 2 cars. After being made to wait for over 90 minutes, they informed me that one of the cars has been sold and the other one cannot be found. Worst experience ever
My food was just ok. Not exactly what I ordered. Asked for ham but got bacon. The service was very bad. I had to flag them down to fill up coffee and they acted as they were doing me a favor. But the coffee was good. I may give them another chance.
Hadn't been here for a while and decided to get some food to go.  Fish and chips was good.  Wings tasted like they had been cooked in old oil and the French Dip was horrible - the meat was as tough as shoe leather!  Will NOT eat here again!!
Horrible job on my nails!! Never go there! I had a smudge and the fixed it by putting three extra coats on and then the polish still smudged!
I ordered for delivery, they did not include cheese on my sandwich, the pizza was stone cold, but the worst part was how rude the worker was when I called.  I will never do business with them again even if they gave me everything for free, HORRIBLE
I would not go to or order a pizza from this place. Raw pizza when asked for well done. Employees have a bad attitude the worst pizza restaurant in Southern Nevada. I will never go back to this place.
One of the best pizza places in town great food! good value! Im from the East Coast it's really hard to find a good pizza place tastes as good as theirs!
make sure you check the price on the shelf AND when they ring you up. very misleading and disappointing.
Went for lunch recently. The appetizers were good, but the main course was terrible. The beef broccoli was extremely bland and thee pad Thai was simply disgusting. There are several other Chinese and Thai places in Henderson that are far better.
I thoroughly enjoyed this place. Really nice people run the place and it's relatively inexpensive. I had the pad see ew, the mint chicken and the tom yum soup. Their soup is probably the best tom yum I have had in town.
Draft shouldn't be blank.
Terrible wings and service was not great. Waste of money the waitress was nowhere to be found anytime we needed anything.  Also she was too busy rubbing her stomach to pay attention to her customers!  NEVER AGAIN HOOTERS!!!
Horrible service, 30 minutes to get dry steaks and it was not even crowded in the restaurant! What a waste of money to dine here! Trust me people do not waste your time or money at Sonoma unless you want your night ruined
liars, thieves, dont keep their word and are worse in customer service. i will never return again and neither will my friends or family. i love toyota vehicles, but i will have to invest in a honda.
Worst bank/cu I've ever used. Fees for everything!! They're just crooks trying to rip off hard-working people.
Among my favorite places to eat. Fair price, great food, outstanding service, \"hot\" means hot. The staff is always friendly, my glass NEVER hits half empty and I drink ALOT of water. They also almost always give my kids free desert. They are awesome.
Boy how things have changed.  The staff and menu are the same, but the way the food is prepared is completely different (not in a good way) and the service has become very slow.\n\nI'm not sure what happened, by I hope they get their act together.
Absolutely disgusting.  Ive been here before and it was good. I just tried it again and got pad thai. The chicken was old and smelled and the shrimp was overcooked and not cleaned. I will never return and wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
Awful customer service.  They swear they are a high end store.  All I did was ask for a military discount and they swore I was robbing them or taking it out of their paychecks...come on!\nGEEZ...
The locations in phoenix have chicken we can add to our meal. This location does not. We drove an extra 10 minutes to get here  to find out they don't have chicken was not a pleasant surprise.
Never again , crab cake salad tasted like vomit , crawfish was way to plain and flavorless . Not worth my money sorry .
Have been to Joe's a number of times and enjoyed their food.  We have had terrible service every time, though.  It's worth going because the food is good and the atmosphere is fun.  Just be patient, and your night will be fine.
Great atmosphere.  I like to visit once in a while.
Service is good not to be confused with great, the happy hour specials are awesome draft beer for 3 bucks you cant go wrong , clam chowder is dismal , overall it is ok , waitress could have upsold the beers and explained all the specials a little more ..
KIDS ZONE! Enough said, they will babysit your children as you gamble. IM SOLD! Hotel is clean and the rooms are amazing!
I think for the price of the rooms it is a great place it is very clean and the costumer service is great. Wish the buffet lines weren't so long though!
Highly recommend anyone to go here!:) the staff is really nice and Dr.Goldman is a very good doctor and he's honest,prices are also reasonable. He saved my dog did surgery on her and I'm so thankful for his work!
Very polite service when I called Rakeman plumbing yesterday.  Charlie was at my house within the hour without having to pay a diagnostic fee as with two other plumbers I called.  Fantastic service, polite, efficient and knowledgeable.  Will definitely use again.  Thank you Charlie!
Always excellent service and food at this location.
Super disappointed w/civiche de camarones.  Seriously lacked flavor other than lime.  Nice server, loved the tableside guac & all the chips and salsa.  Entrees took forever.  Exc margarita!  I would eat there again, everyone else liked their food.
Slow service. I thought the food was kind of tasteless. I had to smother it in salsa to taste anything good.
Fantastic atmosphere, great service and the food was delicious. I've finally found a good Mexican restaurant in Vegas!  3 years later...
We are LOCALS. Station Casinos SUPPOSELY love locals. We are not pleased. We were ripped off by a bartender. I will NEVER walk into that dump again. GAME OVER.
No bad room. Ideal size for two people with king size bed.  Looking forward to show tonight. Clean with plenty of amenities.
I have came here a few times to play craps.   Some of the dealers are extremely rude.. I dont know how they make it through there shift with out getting knocked out.   \nBuffet is okay..  oyster bar is great. Movie theater are decent
Staff is nice and friendly but the car wash did a terrible job. They had employees dry my car but when I got home I discovered spots all over. I'll stick to Fabulous Freddy's from now on.
As usual they slop a whole bunch of secret sauce so you can't taste the beef or the rest of the sandwich.  I had the new advertised Rueben and sure wasn't impressed.
Probably in my top 10 things I have eaten in Vegas. I love the Bobbie and probably get one every other week. I did branch out and get a Slaw B Joe and that was unreal too.
Had the carne asada burrito. Excellent service from Ernesto and Gabe. I like the fresh made chips and salsa.
Sadly in this part of own there are not too many steakhouses and over time even restaurants have been going under.  This Outback's food has been consistently good and the service is always on point.
Yes, you can find a cheaper tire. I like this place because they offer a warranty and a bunch of other services with your tire purchase.\n\nAnother great thing - I was literally out of there in less than 15 minutes! Extra star for their awesome service!
DO NOT SHOP HERE!  My wife bought hair for my daughter, and the size was not what was indicated on the package.  They refuse to allow a return or even an exchange because they have a no return policy.  We are out over $100.
Ordered a pizza to go very light on toppings and sauce asked to reorder said no not very good customer service
Crappy service.
This is the worst chipotle that I have been too! The service wasn't all that good, and the portions were the smallest I've experienced. \nThe chipotle Location on Sahara is much better!
SHUT DOWN as of 3/31/2014 by Southern Nevada Health District for having 46 outstanding demerits. I will most likely never eat there again.
I live next to a different Smith's so when I walked into this one and saw how neat and clean they keep it, I was jealous! Freshly baked bread, deli counter, friendly employees and even hot soup that you can eat in the store! Wish I lived closer to it :(
Best green tea! Garlic tuna nigiri. Yellowtail w ponzu n jalape\u00f1o nigiri. Wild salmon. Best spicy tuna rolls. Asakusa roll is redic! Dessert great too!!!
Great sushi, first place i goto when i get into town, all you can eat is awesome. The staff make you feel wecome and also give some great suggestions if you cannot make up your mind from the vast selections of roll's
Average food. Lack presentation, ingenuity, and tasty. Taste like something I've picked up from a grocery store.
I know I gave Roberto's 5 stars but Fausto's is way better. They are just a lot farther away from my house. I love their carne asada and chips and cheese. Great place for a quick bite of tasty and blessedly unhealthy Mexican food.
The apartments are very nice but the management rips you off!! It's not worth the money to be there.
Came here because dog became sick while driving from LA. Gave great, friendly service. Walked in but did not wait long to be seen. Got examined, medicated, and bloodwork all done within an hour. Reasonably priced too.
Nice location with tough parking and a great patio. Staff is friendly but this location is pretty packed.
Trying to figure out why they charged me $14 for two pairs of dress pants. They did offer me a 10% off coupon bringing the total down to $12.60. Still not good enough.
My sister and I took my mom out for her birthday.   They changed their menu  not happy about the new menu.   We had asked our server to do something special for her birthday and never did.  The service was not great either.
Super crowded but worth the wait.
The Best place in town hands down. I  bring everyone I know when they come to visit and they always want I love sushi when they come back.
I don't usually review chains, but $8 hot n ready deep dish pizza is seriously good. And only $8!\nDemand was so high on a Thursday night that they kept running out - the stuff coming out of the oven was literally hot and ready!
Very low key kool area. A salon right across and beanch to sit on in front of the wondow. Overall it is like being in San Diego Ca.
I'm totally disappointed. The sandwich was pretty boring. Although they get kudos for slicing the meat right in front of me. Otherwise, there's just nothing appetizing about their sandwiches.
I love the cherry dipped cones!\n\nStill sad they got rid of the cotton candy blizzard- was my absolute favorite!
I had an emergency and these good folks were wonderful. They stayed after-hours to treat me. The staff couldn't have been more wonderful and Dr. Scott Manthai gave me great care and follow-up. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
Quiet, good friendly service, huge food portions. 2 people can share 1 meal.
Good service....room was unique...neighbors next door partied til 6am...security n front desk did everything they could! Lounge is always a fun time...want to try Rumors next!!!
I hear this place is hopping at around 2am.  I were here around midnight, on a Saturday night and it was dead!  The floors were sticky and the service was lacking.  I may try it again sometime but I'm not racing to go back immediatley.
Love this place. Just took down the shrimp rolls and some pho, always good no matter what time.
I prefer the pho at Pho Kim Long over any other pho restaurant in Las Vegas. Very inexpensive and delish! I don't feel overly full and stuffed. I feel healthy leaving. I've never ordered anything but pho #10. Soooo good!!
Pho Kim long took a pho Kim long time to bring us our food.  Food was very ok.  Nothing to write home to mom about...\nWould come here again because of the name....
Great hangover Pho if you ask me!
Pho wasnt all that great, but a great way to cure a hangover...\nbroth wasnt good and the waiters and waitresses forgot alotta things that we ordered.
Boyfriend and I wasn't impressed \nPho was decent \nBut the bun bo hue was very bland. I also had ask for a hot tea Togo and the guy said they don't do Togo hot teas? How interesting
Smelled like they wiped all their tables with dirty smelly rags... I can't eat in these conditions.
Pho isn't alwasy Pho.  You can end up with some terrible broths.  This place is always consistant and super busy.  I like that sometimes I have to wait in line.  It reminds me that I'm not the only one who likes this place for lunch
If you want to wait 30 mins just to place your order, come to this place. Food is great but the service is lacking.
Worst customer service in existence!   It's kinda funny to see this in this day and age.   But,  if of don't mind the attitude the food is good.
i was the first time came to Las Vegas,I was so hugely when I arrived this resturant,I feel bad when I arrived,bad service,late food and bad food,I don't want to came again.
The 24/7 pho spot. I've been here a few times. One time at 7 in the morning they were bumping EDM. Not cool when you're hungover. Other than that, the food is decent.
Food is getting worse and worse every time I came. I get very disappointed even though this is nice place. :((
Jeep wrangler Rubicon 7 Windows and strip on the front. Limo tint on the back 5, MN 35 on the driver and passenger. Total was $160 super nice accommodating folks and the tint looks amazing!
Went there on Friday for menudo but it tasted horrible.  It usually tastes good on the weekend, so not sure if I got an old batch or what.   I am going to try again on the weekend and hopefully it will taste better.
Service guy came right out that same morning I called in. He was friendly and knowledgable. Had my TV repaired that same day. The other TV repair company had installed an incorrect lamp. Now my TV looks great.
One of the best Mani-Pedi's I've ever had. Very clean and professional.
I enjoyed the foot massage and they did great job on my nails
This Starbucks is pretty disorganized.  Every time I've been in this place I wait much much longer in line than I would've if I would've gone through the drive thru.  So frustrating.  This Starbucks needs some management and better cleaners.
Bun Bo Hue.... that is all I have to say. You don't always find bun bo hue with that much flavor but this place has it all. I'll be back for sure
Dont eat here its nasty and they recycle their food.. The only good thing about this restaurant is its damn cheap hhahaha if you are cheap and want cheap quality of food then you eat here you cheap ass hahahah
Got introduce here by my ex boss. Really nice place to have lunch or dinner. Food are great. I'd say A+ to their service. Will come here more often.
Pho broth is no good. Service is no good. There are plenty of other pho places in the area. This one was not worth my time and money.
Video poker, topless dancers, 7 am to 7pm happy hour, the DJ is amazing, best party location in Vegas...enough said
Best Korean BBQ in Vegas. Love their marinated pork belly and squid. Their salad is addicting. Staff is friendly. Can be a long\nwait on weekend nights, but that's to be expected. My go to Korean BBQ spot!
Nothing new at this place, they continue to remove the expiration dates\noff their food products. Someone needs to alert the clark county health department!!!
Unbelievable. How the heck do you run out of crushed peppers and parmesan cheese?\n\nI should've run back in and grabbed a whole roll of those Bounty-like paper towels. Would've served them right.
So unprofessional. Lady that I've never seen there before was talking about her personal business like she was at home. She was venting about something to the others. Her face was ticked off. Keep your personal issues at home and serve your customers!
This was decent comfort food from back home.  Not worth a special trip but, if you're in the area, it is pretty good.
No Complaints with this place! Support the little guy, (last mom and pop shop)  and if you ever need anything repaired this is the place Vegas!
Epoys offer a variety of food and snacks. food are always warm and tasty.\nHowever, this restaurant is no longer in business. a thai restaurant replaced it.
small limited very reasonably priced friendly employees unique speciality items but not intended for your complete shopping needs this location is steady busy with lots of parking
Much better than ANY casino. Great food and service. The menu is fantastic. Breakfast and lunch.   Look for it just west across from Palace Station.
nice place not the best but def not the worst
Staying in the section of the hotel that's considered the courtyard completely nasty and awful.  The smell, look, everything else made Vegas a bad experience to start but we quickly check out and paid 50 dollars a night more and stayed at the Hard Rock Casino & Hotel.
the hotel isn't a looker but having the Oyster Bar and bingo here make it A-ok with me.
Bomb ramen. All the other food is delicious. Always worth the wait. They can always do most specials any day. Love the atmosphere and service. Never have been let down by this place.
The employees and owner here are very skilled at what they do. Santiago is the best man to do tint, and the sales reps will do anything that can to help you with you custom auto needs. I do recommend!
The raisin bread and taro pastry were both very very tasty.
Overpriced food here. The duck was OK, but i wish the skin should be crispy instead soft skin.
Very expensive tourist trap. The food is pure crap.
Be careful when you eat in this restaurant I was order ong choy it has grass in side the food they gave me an other plate the second plate it has more grass then the first plate .and the price so expensive , never again and i recommend don't go to this place .
If you want hepatitis this is a place where you can get it! Totally disgusting from the food to the restaurant and the waiters. This whole place should be bombed with RAID!
Food: Mediocre\nService: non-existence \nPrice: over-priced\nCleanness: I wonder why this place is still open.\nOverall rating: 0.5 star
Out of Business. Building has been vacant for a couple years. Will be torn down as part of the freeway expansion.
I have been here two times. It's not a bad place. Atmosphere is very nice. Waitress was friendly. Food was not bad, pretty average. If I am in the mood for simple Korean food,  would come to this place.
Will always remain one of my 'to go' places when passing through vegas.
Don't know how this chain stays in business. The food they put out is under par and when you bring it to their attention its hilarious to see the look on their face. It just comes from poor or no management.  2 people here and half the table are dirty.
The whole place smells like dirty grease.
Big portions, tasty and some of the best service we have received! This will be my Vegas go-to breakfast place.
Food OK service needs improvement my server took my order wrong and did not check until the end
The waitress was quite nice. The potato chips are awesome. The rest of our food was just ok, nothing spectacular. Place is very old school. It was an ok breakfast in general here ...
Amazing warm banana nut bread and delicious potatoes! The omelettes are huge...consider sharing. Coffee is not the best but everything else makes up for it. Friendly service and cozy place....the restaurant is inside a shopping center not to be confused by the sign.
Banana bread is the greatest on earth! It's worth driving here just for that alone. The breakfast is huge and the price is tiny! My new favorite place!
This place don't need a makeover, it needs a bulldozer.\nIt puts the whole community to shame.
Typical Cap's right next to my place so it's convenient.  The staff are actually nice...shocking I know!
I go here to get my dog food and dog utilities. Staff is nice, if you run into them they will help. The store is always clean!
I went to this location yesterday and I was very disappointed. The lady at the drive thru was very rude.
This is a good solid hobby store. Their stuff is not as complete as HobbyTown USA right across the street but is nonetheless worth a visit if you are in town.
Love supporting small businesses. You wouldn't even know the donuts were Vegan,  they were that good!
I've been coming here my whole life. The zaru soba is good. The sushi used to be better. But I'll keep coming here because I have a place in heart for it.
Really fresh sake. Great rolls. Nice option to get a half or a full roll. Delicious lychee sake. Fast service. Amazing!
Hands down, the absolute BEST Japanese restaurant in Las Vegas! The best sushi I ever had! You can't beat this place. This is what all Japanese restaurants should be measured against. I love this place and can't wait for my next trip to Vegas to go here!
I  went   there  last  Sunday   and  men  !!!   really  god  sushi   I  think  come  back   asap
This laundromat is a good price and has flat screen TVs, video games and a theater in the back. Regular prices. nice washing machines and dryers dried all my clothes for $0.75. Good atmosphere. will be going back. would recommend to friends and family
I really like this jack in the box, the people are always nice and the food is always hot! When I had to wait for my burger, I didn't order a drink i was standing near the register off to the side they handed me a free drink and thanked me for waiting.
Kevin and Tammy seem super nice. Christine has a nasty attitude she does a horrible job. She does not know how to speak to costumers. She really is a b.tch. Tammy had to redo them. Never going back! .
milk tea, fruit tea.. all good. we ordered snacks like peppered chicken and toast that were really good as well. Wanted to get their shaved ice with tapioca strips, but they were out unfortunately. This is my hang out spot almost every night while I was in Vegas!
Service has always been horrible for the past couple years, even when it used to be tea planet. The good boba never makes up for it and their slow staff.
service could be better, or maybe i am used to service back in 626?\n\ntea was alright, too much ice.
I don't like that you can't just hang out here, you have to actually make a purchase of a minimum of $5 or they kick you out. Overall, cute little tea place that's open until 2am.
I visited this location for boba. Compared to other asian boba places, this location is very clean, professional, and organized. I really like the interior of the establishment and the professional business feel. Other boba shops even nearby are very poorly designed and not very professional.
Love this place since it was tea planet.
Today was my first visit to Globe Salon, and I really enjoyed the experience. Sam provided a great consultation, great cut, and several styling tips! I am so excited to have found my new favorite salon in LV!
They called us to come At 2.we waited more than an hour for the assistance .wtf.we made a reservation before.bad service
Mediocre food. Unlimited eating for $30 per day. Go to Belagio buffet for lunch at 3pm instead. $20. Much better. \\
This buffet was way better than than the circus circus no doubt!  Thanks server bobby for making it enjoyable and for getting everybody to sing for my ten year old!!  The food was ok but...my favorite is the eggs benedict and the crab legs!
Philly Cheese Steak gave me heart burn bad!\n\nRather not go here again!
Been coming here for 10yrs. Dale and his team are best. They always go the extra mile for me and are very honest about their price. Thank you for the great service
A great Vegas tradition... it helps that I love frozen custard.  Definitely worth a trip for tourists.
Good stuff, been coming for years. Glad its getting so much hype they deserve to make some money. Do yourselves a favor and dont expect a religious experience or you will be disappointed. Its simple food made fresh on site and very good.
Meh... I thought it was very ok... And the girls working there were rude and seemed very bothered by us. I wouldn't go back
The worst customer service, and the longest delivery time I've ever experienced! After 2 hours the food showed up cold, the fingers were burnt, and the pizza crust was burnt as well. I posted pic's so please view them. Never again to return!
Just went here let me say it was lots of fun , very pact seating wasn't too great, drinks were good make sure you get JOAN he is beyond dreamy, sexy and just BEAUTIFUL you definitely won't regret it!!!!!
lord have mercy on my bowels...the burritos will cause you pain. eat one if you need a colon cleanse. only eat here during the zombie appocolypse
the tacos are off the hook yummmmmmmmy
Disappointing overall.  Spring rolls were unpleasant.  Poor flavor and texture.  Vegetarian massaman curry was okay.  Good spice, overly sweet.
This is a disgusting place which serves a what looks like an hour by hour hotel room.  Don't do it!!!!!!   The staff creepy....like something out of psycho.  Beware!!!!
Amazing company! The best one in Vegas!
Love it here. Classic Filipino cuisine. ok service average decor. Good star rating for its quality of food.
Yep, gonna visit this place if you want a job in service here in Vegas. Pretty clean, nice building, helpful staff. Pretty quick in and out as well.
This is the best Mexican food I've ever had! I literally have to drive across town to eat there! Great food and service!
Staff at this facility are outstanding. The online registration was convenient and easy to complete. Eliminated the stress of sitting in the facility trying to remember the information. Registration was simple..the nursing staff was very helpful and considerate. From check in to check out-  everyone was pleasant and professional.
Back after a few months and they still can't get these Americanos right .   How hard is it?
4 years later, this place is still terrible. Why my mom likes to go here, ill never understand.
Geek squad sucks, no customer service, no order or organization, horrible communication
Crappy service. Good food..... Ordered, then got food 50mins Later then didn't see the Waitress for another 30 mins..... When she dropped off the check...
this ross is beyond rude! will not be shopping here again!
Kind of expensive and you have to work to get your crab out. The don't have the shell crackers, only a zip tool.
I really like this beauty supply store, it's just so far from where I live.  So when I do get to that side of town, I  usually stop in because I know they have something I need or haven't seen, or need to get.
Just your average Wal-Mart what else can I say? Service prices all the same. Nothing different here than any other Wal-Mart.
We went to live to eat taco and I got the cashier service bues these ali does not want to take water from natural and has a bad attitude bad
Yeah, one star for stealing my honey's credit card.  Thank goodness American Express is more loyal to its customers than you people are.  Using his credit card up & down Nellis blvd is retarded. \nEat a dick & gain some integrity.
We came here after a stress-filled morning and were pleasantly surprised. This Denny's is nothing like the one we'd been to previously. The cook actually did a great job, the service was spot-on and the waitress was awesome.
Ok food. Ok service. Left smelling horrible of cigarette smoke.
The staff was nice but didn't listen when our order was taken and some of the order was messed up. Some of the customers were very loud and ghetto. The tables could be cleaned better! I didn't want to go into the bathroom.
Great breakfast joint that reminds me of waffle-house. Do not order anything that could be stored in the fridge as it tastes like it have ( huevos ranchos ). Massive omlettes that are worth the price.
Service is great.  Price is nice and food is good.  The real gem here are the appetizers.  The crispest fried chicken wings, \nshrimp and vegetables you will find anywhere at any cost.  Have not ate buffet...not buffet guy.
One of the worse carne asada burritos I ever had.    I will never go back.   And the salsa?   You've got to be kidding me.    Did you get it from a can?
Awesome place, they have everything, i couldn't believe my eyes. The staff there is amazing!!!
The worst of the worst, did not keep their booking prepaid for a stretch limo.\n\nTerrible customer service by management as they never call you back when a problem arises.\n\nRuined our wedding.
Negative star! This place is the last place you want to go. I went there to get my lab results, they had me wait for 2 hrs just to tell me my labs aren't ready and i had to come back!
Near Chef Rubber they have the large-scale equipment and smaller wares you would need in order to open a food business. They have a lot of dishes, tools, pans for a cheaper price if its what you need.
My favorite place to eat in Las Vegas. Solid BBQ.\n\nTry the Hot Links.
Absolutely the worst meal ever. Catfish was old fishy and the wait staff\" we've had a lot of complaints. It must really be bad\" wth . .burnt ends were crap too. Not fresh at all.
Well the food was OK at best.  Middle of the road BBQ is giving it to much credit.  I'm not a famous Dave fan but its better. Man I miss Missouri.
My brother and I were supposed to go to a movie but ended up stopping by here for lunch. Never made it to the movie but they had good pizza and my brother swears by their ranch.
German pancakes, Swedish pancakes, one side of sausages, two coffees for. $34.  Way too high for OK food.  Long wait to get table when only few customers eating and had to ask someone to send waitress to take order.  Would not return.
The food was excellent. Vegetarian omelets and banana and pumpkin pancakes. Our server, Mary was amazing, attentive and very accommodating and caring.. We will certainly be back again. Thanks Mary and thanks Original Pancake House,
5 dollar foot long
First time here ... it was alright. i ordered the chicken kabob nothing special and nothing bad. The service seemed kinda slow. Chicken was tender the rice tasted buttery. Give it a try you might like it. For me i think i will pass next time.
The foods not for fast food Chinese. It's not as greasy as some that I've had before, so it passes.
This place is very good and has good quality and service and great cocktails.
I stopped to get a quick bite to eat and wasn't disappointed. Beef chow mein is delcious,  it's not the bland stuff you'll find at similar joints.  Orange chicken is also A grade.  Service was quick to us and quick to deliver.
I ordered the garlic chicken dinner special, so good, they packed the take out container, it was so much food! Saved half for later :)
Really not good. I would never come back here. The wait staff was attentive but the food was gross. I don't know why they have an overall 4 stars.
Very nice staff. I really enjoyed my experience here and will definitely bring my dog back for her routine care.
this place is so delicious and cheap.  Very friendly and fast.\n\nAsk for no MSG and free delivery.\n\nThey give you a lot of food.  great for a local neighborhood thai place.
The creamy shrimp soup is an absolute must have.  Everything else I've had is good but a little expensive for your average Chinese restaurant.  Staff is always friendly.
Service was good fast and just like I like it and those who've read me know I like my cheese stakes
The Place is nice the bartenders are good at there job descent food and separate smoking area
Better than taco bell
Staff is rude food is not good. I have been there a few times and have had to take fries back because they were so old or had to go get the rest of my order. Go to another one much better service and better food
Yuk! Couldn't even chew the steak. I love del taco but never have I experience such a disgusting meal. Didn't get past the first bite.
No, no, no, no no!!!\n\nNo water except on jug on each nine. Saw cart girl once in four hours. Greens are terrible. Bumpy, no grass, poorly maintained. I'd never play this course again
I don't golf.  But I live here.
The food was very good and tasty. Portions were big and priced reasonably.
I like what this place does for my nails; especially my toenails. They are thick and hard to deal with at times. Whenever I ask for a design, they always accommodate and have not been rough on me at all.
they have a pretty extensive menu, you would find something to eat pretty easy. The appetizers come in pretty big portions and  their food is very Delicious. They also have an extend wine menu.
I enjoyed a nice manicotti dinner here tonight. We had a group of 12 and I believe everyone enjoyed dinner. Some nice specials were offered. Prices were reasonable.
We've been here a couple of times.  Food is always good and so is the service. We'll definitely be back.
I have been seeing Dr. Weisner for various ailments since May of 2000.  He has helped me recover from a serious car injury, and allowed me lead an active an healthy lifestyle.  \n\nAlways very professional and willing to spend time with you.  Great staff as well!
Small, but had the basics with good quality
Best grocery store in Vegas!
Both dr Martin and swainston are amazing but they are way overcrowded. I'm a little concerned about getting seen and what will happen when I go into labor. When you do see them thy give you their full attention.
What can I say...this used to be my regular as it was cheaper for dinner for two here than cooking on your own.  It's still OK.  Full of Dell Web residents if you get there for an early dinner.  Love Mirna, the waitress that has been there for years!
Worst doctor office. Do not go here. Very rude costumer service and do not care about patient health. By far one of the worst experiences I have ever had.
Best pizza I've found in Summerlin. Lots of fresh toppings and great flavor. Not the cheapest pizza, but worth it.
Very happy with their pizza.  It's my favorite in the city.  The staff is nice and they know what they're doing.  The owner is also very nice.
Banana bread was delicious and the Mediterranean omelet with shrimp and lobster inside was amazing.
The restaurant was closed to the efforts of the anti-smoking Nazi's. The beer is still great but I miss the food.
$6 exterior car wash, and you can find a $2 off coupon online.  Makes for a cheap car wash, except I have to get out of my car to dry off my car after it's been \"dried.\"  You get what you pay for!
Just okay.  My husbsnd hated it but I thought it would do in a pinch, but haven't been back in months.  Soups need improvement.  Staff was nice.
I have been going here since I was a little kid. The food had always been consistent and delicious. Even if I haven't been there in a while, the waitress always recognizes me and knows my order. BEST WONTON SOUP EVER!
This is place is clean the server is very attentive. Food was brought to us within 10/15 after we placed the order. Came for the lunch special they're priced very well. Will definitely come back. Delicious!!
This is a good sushi bar.  Other reviews say the fish is fresh and they weren't joking.  Its a small place with not much ambience, but if you're going there for good sushi, you won't be disappointed.
Best sushi in town. Sad it's such a small location because I'm impatient when it comes to waiting! The Green Valley is my personal favorite!
What can I say but awesome! A bit pricey but the best sushi in town. They have some of the freshest seafood of any sushi restaurant I've ever been to.
We just had a wonderful experience at this lakeside french restaurant! Chris our server is outstanding and the food was amazing too! Highly recommend this great place for brunch!
I love their bagels. Don't like their coffees because Starbucks is better but they have really good bagels and smoothies.
It's a quick meal for lunch, but fairly unappetizing. I am quite unsure why there was such a long line leading to the entrance. It's place I am definitely not look forward to visiting again.
A bit small inside. Bathrooms are clean and food is always great. The boy at the register is nice. There are Roberto's all over town but I prefer this one because of the cleanliness and food consistency.
A city runs through it.\n\nLas Vegas grew around this place, originally a game dressing shop.  Chuck Frommer has expanded it into the best butcher shop I know of.
Don't get scared of the line! It's so worth it! The hot links are fantastic, and the green beans are done so well even a veggie hater will eat them.
Off the charts.  Delicious.  How can a boiled rib taste so good!   Huge portions.  Really nice staff.  Thoroughly impressed.   A must eat local.
Had tri-tip and ribs with macaroni salad and yams. Meat was super tender and flavorful, best barbeque I've ever had. Sides were great, too.
I love this place.. They're sides are the bomb I always get the brisket dinner w/mac n cheese & baked beans..
The food was very good, old school the garlic toast and homemade thousand island dressing were very nostalgic.  The 2x baked potato was huge and the steak was excellent, but the bathrooms!  Please do something about them, it hurt the experience of an otherwise nice Friday night!
Used to be a favorite place to eat for my wife and I until we found a metal screw in my wifes Huevos Rancheros. Dissapointing. I had eaten there for over 20 years. Still a great place to have a beer but I'll never eat there again.
Worst food I've tasted since 1995. Service was terrible and the filet mignon was cardboard. Very disappointed. Will never return
Totally love this place..have been going here for YEARS...they have wood next door you can buy in the cord and a vet who comes in 2 times a month for low cost vet clinic!! SUPER saver!!!
Family friendly activities!\n\nIt was a flashback to my childhood skate parties.  The kids had a blast and the staff was pretty good at keeping track of the floor so the little ones didn't get run over.
Pros:  Self serve and wide variety of concessions.  Beautiful lobby.  \n\nCons:  No drink refills and the theaters themselves are not as nice as Aliante.
Fast service.  Ordered extra crispy chicken.  The food was good as usual.  Will come back again.
this is a fun place to go for a cosume if you are an entertainer or just for fun! They have some new and almost new quality clothing and you can get 30% off if you bring a donation the staff was cool sometime you can find some cool stuff antiques other random stuff.
This review was posted in error and I don't know how to delete it so I am just changing the star rating to five but I have no experience with the shop
Stayed here a couple nights.   Only payed about $40 per night.. room was okay.   Smelled weed walking dow. The hallways..  but what do you expect only $40 a night lol.  Not the worst hotel I been in.
This particular Domino's Pizza is the location I use for delivery when I would like a pizza at home.  They are always prompt and very polite when they deliver, and the pizza is hot fresh and baked perfectly.
If you want your feet to even be somewhat smooth, do not go here. Their $25 pedicure is merely a polish change and hot water soak.
This place is going down the drain. Sad. Great food but service has went down the drain. Won't be back!!
Amazing jewelry store. We've bought and had fixed/serviced our watches, rings etc They are wonderful. Unfortunately Danielle, the lady who usually answers the phone, has poor phone manners. I won't give T Bird less stars though. She just needs to check her tone of voice!
One of the more cleaner 24. But this review is based on the people that go this 24. Gym filled with racist people who will stereotype you based on your race. If you are Asian, you are not welcomed at the basketball court.
Very friendly staff. Great personal service. I needed a minivan. They offered a journey but the inside height was not tall enough for items I was transporting  They drove to another location to bring a minivan back. The went the extra mile to help me get what I needed.
The service was good but the course not so good.  Wouldnt play here again.
first time eating at sonic!  they need to open some of these in the bay area!  had the spicy southwest burger, which has crispy jalapeno strips, with some fries and a cherry limeaid drink.  pretty yummy!
Could not find out what was wrong with me. Bad bedside etiquette. Never found out what was wrong with me after 20 visits, always felt rushed and that he had better things to do.
Low expectations which are usually exceeded.
Stopped in this place and could not get past the lack of cleanliness and the terrible odor upon entry. This location definitely needs some attention to detail and cleanliness. We decided not to eat here based on the lack of cleanliness.
I ordered the Pan fried noodles (Hong Kong Style) - it was alright. I've had better. Place lacks service.
All I gotta say is.....YUMMY IN MY TUMMY!!!!!!  =)
Discount after 10pm which is great for me =) I eat late.
So disappoint... We ordered a live lobster but It turned out to be a dead one. Ruining my taste.
The food was really good!  Great spice!  \n\nReally enjoyed the meal!
We came here for Thai food with one $. It was a little pricier than expected and servings weren't generous. Decor is cute. Space is tiny. A-ok if this is your neighborhood Thai spot. No need to go out of your way.
That sundae is ridiculous. DO IT!
Love, Love, Love this place.  Always consistent.  Happy hour is a Steal!!! This place has always been in my top five!!
Loved this place. The duck tacos were fantastic. Also I would highly recommend the messy sundae.
Its ok compared to the restaurants in Socal. the service is average. but i don't know if its just me but it seems like the wings taste different.
This hotel doesn't have the glamour of other hotels on the strip if that's what you're looking for, but the dealers were very courteous and made great conversation as well
Pretty bad atmosphere. I have been waiting for 30 minutes with 8 other people to sit at a 3 dollar 6-5 blackjack table and they won't open another table or even a $5 table.
When you want wings, you want to head to Hooters...try to get seated in Ashley S's section (preferably when Mike Lee is working) and you'll get INCREDIBLE service matched only by Ashley's adorable smile!
Love this place! Their pho has that traditional home made Viet taste and very fast and good service. Highly recommended.
Perfect Pho! Stock was seasoned just right; the meat and noodle was just the right portion. Nothing you could ask for more.
Food very good ,place very clean
I could not have been more pleased with my experience here. They are fast, prompt, and extremely thorough. Make sure you ask for Taylor as your hygienist. She was absolutely amazing and you can tell she has a passion for her career.
The food was mediocre. the selection was very limited. my husband thought it was good,is why I gave it 2 stars. The squid was rubbery. the egg drop soup was barely warm and had corn it. Yuck!!
This service is great! I don't trust anyone with my son but I felt comfortable using this company. Olivia was our nanny for the evening and I think she did a fantastic job and was very attentive. Sarah, the owner is one of the nicest people out there :)
Dr Arnold is a no-nonsense professional. His staff are always friendly and courteous. I would highly recommend him.
No air conditioner! We all sweated as we ate, it's an oven in here!! Worst mc Donald and dinning experience of the summer. How can you have the dinning room open when you have no air and it's over 100 degrees
Walk in on sat. Nobody was up front and nobody helped me. So I walked out. Do not go there.
Good sushi place, prices are reasonable.  Nothing outstanding, but it a good place to go and I will be going back again.  The service was outstanding, although I did go at lunch and there were not many people there.
Not bad... the Restaurant.com coupon helped make this 2 star restaurant into a 3-star.
I have been going here like 3 years.  Lani is the best her pedicures always last forever and everyone always compliments my nails and pedicures.
Fixed my locks, was on time and reasonably priced. I was pleased with the service and the tech did not try to sell me on unnecessary extras.
Very sad to say that the bar was sold to a slot parlor & will be closing before New Years. The staff was good & so was the food. To many stupid slot parlors in this town now!
They microwaved our dim sum in front of us. Depressing. Nothing more to stay.
What the hell... Drove there today and they were closed?!?! The sign over the restaurant was taken down... So confused and sad, this was my spot!!!! I hope it's just temporary for construction. Anyone have any insight?
Sandwiches are great and I've had really nice customer service each time I've visited.
Good for a fast health food alternative than burger king. Busy with people and got my food out fast.
I love coming to Panera! Ashley Love and Luke always brighten my day. The staff here is so amazing and friendly! We have been coming for years. Great food and wonderful service!
We moved here about a month ago, and so far everything has been good! All the staff members have been very kind and helpful. The complex is great, for us and our pets, and we are excited to start enjoying all the amenities that includes. Hope to keep having a wonderful stay here!
It has a very nice, comfy and relaxing athmosphere.  It's like having ur own private dinner.  Excellent customer service.
Slow unfriendly service surprisingly from a McDonald's. Food was not fresh either. Bathrooms were a dirty wreck as if in a roadside gas station. Take your business to a different McDonald's.
It's cool that they brew their own beers. I wasn't a huge fan of the food and beer, but it is a neat restaurant in Pittsburgh!
Big fan of the Church.  Their non traditional pierogies are almost always a great choice, paired with the pizza and their beer brewed on site, this is a must stop when in the Bloomfield area of Pittsburgh.
This place is great. It is cool how they turned a church into a brew pub. The pom frites are awesome and the pizza is good.
Loved the atmosphere and the beer. Great place to meet up with friends and have some good beer and food!
Horrible bar. Horrible crowd. If you're over the age of 22 avoid at all costs.
Good place.  Almost always very busy... Might want to make a reservation.  The chefs don't seem to have a whole of personality.... And they are often times not Japanese at all... But the food is good nonetheless.
Pretty average sushi bar good food, great location. I'm a fan of this place.
Love some Tiki Lounge.\nDrink specials? A waterfall?\nJungle black out time.
I love this pizza
Get me early cuz they go quick! If you get them while they are hot you'll be hooked for sure! Best soft pretzel anywhere!
Ok place for a lunchtime burger or breakfast.\n\nThe food is consistently okay but not great.\n\nThe staff are also ok. \n\nOverall the place is remarkably average in an area with places that are much much better.
Best service I've ever had anywhere!!! I'm from MI and travel the entire east coast all the time. I love Yuengling and they had the best price and were truly kind. I would definitely recomend this place.
OMG\nTerrible even my wife likes vegetarian and hated this \nQuick give me a real egg and meat!! Even sub par for veggie lovers \nThe first experience with a yelp recommendation I was totally turned off by
Are you kidding me?  A vegetarian dream in an odd Antique store?  Yep and fantastic prices and wonderful food to boot.  More than reasonable prices, portions and panache. Seriously, though, this hole in the wall is worth finding.
Holy hell, don't eat at this BK.  It's dirty, crackheads swarm it, there are roaches.  Multiple people I know have gotten very sick from eating at this BK.  If you're craving Burger King, go else where.
Awesome in the single word! Affordable in the second word! Easy to find out whatever you need  gifting shop also can be said. Actually I love books and also this store like due to the service I have taken from them. Taken different types of books mentioned good.
Good strong fresh coffee. Cool but still friendly staff. Unhurried vibe. Super cute decor. Love it here
I wish I could live on Jean-Marc's macarons.  Seriously incredible.  \n\nWe have had Jean-Marc cakes for multiple special occasions, and they are always fantastic.  His buttercream is to die for...actually, everything here is to die for.
The incline is attractive, but the staff were universally rude and treated the customers much like cattle.
One helluva view and fantastic jalape\u00f1o crab dip.  Pair it with some ice cold beer and this place is sure to be a hit during the summer time!
Excellent service and very attentive. Had the loaded fries and grilled chicken sandwich, which were both good. Solid bar food.
Great find!  Visiting from DC and loved the unique take on menu!  Witty and original.  The food was excellent! Can't say enough about the pierogi sliders and the eggplant lasagna!!
Samosas are crispy, slightly spicy and potato-filled. Delicious for a whopping price of $1. Also a great place to buy spices. Wasn't sure where to find turmeric powder but I found it here.
College bar staple with great half-price food, a large menu, and excellent beer specials.
Spinach wrap for lunch was disgusting. Weird, pasty sauce. Whole place seems kind of dirty. Booths need to be wiped down. Don't go here unless you're an undergraduate with low standards.
Typical college restaurant. Food was mediocre for me but a good choice for college kids.  Had the pizza and the artichoke dip.  It was recommended at not that good.
Racist racist racist. I came on a Wednesday for pizza for the first time and the cook decided that it was okay to to start spewing racial slurs and making references thinking I wouldn't hear him. Gross.
I love the lunch specials, esp. the Thursday one that comes with an eggroll, ...good prices, and the soup/hot tea is great comfort food for when you're trying to keep warm and fight off a cold.
The growing number of noodle restaurants is a positive trend but is jeopardized by those who do not put honest effort into it.  I don't know what bouillon can they open to make their broth, but they need to get a stock pot and some bones.
Everything is over-sweet. No resemblance of real Asian food.
A convenient local deli which quickly serves up both hot and cold sandwiches. It's open late.
Fantastic place.  Amazing food, reasonably priced wine list, great service.  One of my favorite places in the area.
I had pants hemmed here and, while the guy did a decent job (though they still ended up too long even though he pinned them while I had them on?) it was absurdly expensive and took A WEEK.  \n\nCome on now.
Great items, great philosophy.
The food is tasty, but so much MSG!  I'm usually not very sensitive to MSG, but man you can really feel it after you eat here!
One of the few nice Chinese restaurants!
I really like this place. I like their pitza, but I usually go with the falafel salad.
Worst Chinese food ever. I totally got sick after eating their take-out.
Great spicy food. If you like spicy authentic Chinese food this place is as good as those in sf.  Try their Szechwan beef with Mala sauce...if you can take the spice
One of the better sushi places I've been to in Pittsburgh!
Best sushi I have had so far in the area.  I am still learning the ropes, but this is authentic stuff.  An authentic decor, authentic staff, and authentic sushi.  It was very very good and the rolls are creative.
The sushi was delicious. The other food didn't compare. If I go back here I would just stick with the sushi. The waitress and other employees were very attentive. Nice atmosphere.
Pretty good food. Interesting location.
Pizza is nothing special. Canned mushrooms, spinach, and shrimp. Sauce and cheese ordinary. We will not go back
Better pizza than any chain.  Better pizza that you would get anyplace other than NYC or Jersey.  BUT, why go here when just up the street is Napoli?  Mineo's has the rep, Napoli has the better pie.
Great place for drinks or to socialize.  Lots of seating around the bar plus tables and booths.  Always a busy joint and they have tons of tvs playing sports to make things better the bar food is cheap and tasty.  If i could id give this place 4.5 stars
Great service. The first reliable and honest mechanic I have encountered to date. Remember a mechanic u can trust is worth his weight in gold. Calfo's is one
Great and honest service. The guys were kind and straightforward, letting me know all that i needed in order to make decisions about my car.  Reasonably priced and quick service (considering my car was towed during a winter morning).  Thankful they were so close!!
Irene is, quite simply, the world's most talented and responsible alterations seamstress.
The food is so so but, the desserts are outstanding especially the turtle cheesecake. I would rather eat at The Cheesecake Factory . Personally I don't see what the be deal about this place is.
I had dinner here with a large business group and it was quite good.
Great food,great atmosphere and view. Very good service.
Very friendly staff. Sucks you have to pay for wifi. Room decor is outdated. The water pressure in the showers was really bad.
Stopped here this morning for some coffee.  The bagels still aren't the greatest--they're okay but not the greatest.  But the coffee is pretty good.  Susan regain human female form after 2nd cup of coffee!
Convenience is the only plus.  Quality and consistency are lacking.
Needed a late night snack after driving all day and this place was across from our hotel.  Pizza was great, crust was cooked just the way I like it, crispy on the edges and lots of cheese and toppings.   Staff was friendly.
I had the special at the servers suggestion.  It was a chicken with stuffing, mashed potatoes, and fresh vegetables.  The veggies were not fresh, the patatoes were undercooked and the chicken dry.
Great pace to relax on lunch break and snatch up some wifi on a couch!
Stayed at the Wm Penn down the street for a wedding and needed a last minute haircut. Friendly, helpful, all around good cut!
The air conditioning in room 1602 didn't work, and the hotel refused to take responsibility. They simply laughed and said that we should have let them know the night before- we didn't get in until 2am- i would not stay here again. Ridiculous customer service.
a cozy breakfast spot similar to dennys or kings minus the shit your pants feeling you get from dennys or kings.  ive only eaten breakfast here cant speak on the other foods but if you can make a bomb breakfast lunch and dinner should be similar.
Just watch where you pick up your produce.
Overpriced and small portions, but oh so delicious. Nice location. Not so friendly staff though.
Took a cab from downtown to catch dinner about 30 mins before their publicized kitchen close time. They closed the kitchen early and said they can't help me. Great. Glad I called ahead of time. Now I'm in the middle of nowhere and starving.
I am not a fondue fan so I wasn't expecting much out of a group meal but our service was extremely slow. I am under the impression they get a lot of groups and we had made a reservation way in advance. Wouldn't choose to come here again.
Poker machine gambling hole. These bums dont pay state local or federal wage taxes.
Friendly atmosphere and very good service. But the Reuben sandwich didn't have very much meat, a disappointment since the other ingredients were plentiful.
The taxi never showed up. I had this experience twice. They didn't show up after I called at 5 am when no one else would need a taxi. They suck. Don't use them.
Egg on the burger wasn't completely cooked. They kept changing TV channels, so you couldn't watch a game all the way through. So we left.
Staff is always polite and movie selection is great! Prices aren't too bad and the viewing area is always clean. Only down side is that they don't have student discounts, but that's livable
Chicken cooked at wrong temperature... Was completely red. Threw up for 3-4 straight days. Lost business over it too. Fix the kitchen, fix the restaurant... STAY AWAY!
decent at best.  if you know real cajun this place won't impress you but for the lack of any other option it's passable.  the Rat Toes appetizer is pretty good.
Nasty! Disgusting. I can't believe I even stepped in the doors.
Very nice and helpful.  If you are balling on a budget then this is the best store to visit.
Good Service! I had the usual soup, salad and breadsticks.
Fast, polite and the food was good.  The Thai Tacos and fried Mac&Cheese was yummy.  Great burgers as well. This is no culinary stop but good fast food.
Cannot believe how unhelpful and extremely rude the ladies were to me and other women here. They treat you like you're scum until you go to buy an expensive dress. Would never recommend this place to anyone looking for a nice dress shopping experience.
Tried it and they were out of everything we tried to order. Gave them another try and same thing. We gave up and wont be going back
We order our food from their carside service.  We found the food to be great, but patience trying to get your food from the carside pickup!!  (over 15 minutes past the time promised and ignored until the manager brought it out!!)
Excellent food with an intimate feel. I prefer the back patio area. The menu changes almost daily and veggies come from local growers.
Every time we have been here we have been disappointed. We are done. No more chances. There are much better pizza places around here.
Expensive (more than dealership), not fast, and they REALLY do some up-selling.
I have been to this location many times, and let me say that Einstein's is vastly superior as far as bagels are concerned. That stated, Bruegger's does serve good softwiches...however, I could get better bread and bagels elsewhere.
Came here frequently in college. Fell in love with the green curry. I had the chance to go to Thailand for myself and eat some of the dishes I learned to love at Thai Taste - and Thai Taste's versions of the dishes are amazing.
This restaurant closed on 12/16/2012.
This is one of the better places in Charlotte for good food and nice atmosphere.  The food is above average to great depending on what you get.  I like the Salmon.  There is also a nice outdoor space during the warmer months.
This place never disappoints.  I have never had a bad meal here.  There are always plenty of vegetarian selections to choose from.  I recommend making a reservation as they are always busy!
I love the atmosphere at 300 East. It is very cozy and intimate, great for a date night. The food is always really good, as is the service. I especially love the baked goat cheese appetizer and the filet. So good!
Fish tacos,  how could you go wrong with these!
I've been going here since they were in the old location up on East Blvd.  The staff is friendly and knowledgeable, and their hours are convenient for me.
Lots of really neat, unique stuff - but I kind of expected more.  Interesting location and good space and layout.  I've definitely bought a few cards there!
Paper Skyscraper is a fantastic and fun store. They have a little bit of everything. Everyone that works there are always so helpful and nice. This is a store that when my friends come from out of town, we always take them to shop here. Everyone loves it!
Simply put, the best fried chicken I have ever had! Mind you, I'm no connoisseur, but this was 110% legit; crunchy, juicy & ripe with flavor.
as far as fried chicken goes, this place is great!!!! Beware of the hours and they only take cash. Deffinetly worth a visit.
The place was less crowded this time and the restrooms were a bit cleaner. The restrooms do look and smell like they could use a good bleachy scrubdown, walls and all. The drinks were tasty and service quite friendly.
Funky, spunky....just give me the soup!!!  Believe it or not, but this place has THE best soup in Charlotte!  Don't be afraid to browse around the eclectic shop with many many organic & natural (genuinely) wares....
A great Starbucks in a great community. The staff is friendly, the music is amazing, and the energy there is just great. My only complaint? Finding parking is kind of a pain.
Good vibe, good food. Too loud on weekend nights. Make a choice, nightclub or dinner.
Excellent selection of well prepared Sushi.  Nice atmosphere that is definitely a bit \"Clubby\" as somebody previously mentioned.
The best!
This gallery has an explicit policy on their website that they will not entertain the art of any local artist.  I hope that the public will avoid them and instead go to galleries that allow Charlotte artists an opportunity to exhibit their work.
The worst collection of art suited for those who know very little about art. This gallery is neither progressive, provocative, or intellectually stimulating. It is perfect for Charlotte.
I tried this place after seeing it in the loafer so many times with rave reviews. I enjoyed my burger and fries although my guest didn't so much. I will note that they DO NOT have air conditioning. I was melting...
Its been a while since I've been here but the last time I was there the beer was not cold at all and the staff just didn't seem that interested in making sure you had a great experience. I love the location but not sure when I'd go back.
I was in the mood for breakfast and stopped in.\nI was not disappointed.\nI was seated immediately and was able to promptly place my order.\nEverything came out hot and tasty.
The best lunch spot in Charlotte. Friendly, family atmosphere. Great food, exceptional service!
Attended a gun show here. Nice facility.  Lots of parking and easy to get in and out of.
Their fish tacos are the best in Charlotte! SO DELICIOUS! And they always have a great draught selection. I LOVE CABO!
I really want to love this place but I really think it's overrated. I've been a number of times over the years and the food is rarely better than ok. The service has always been awesome though.
I ate at CFT for the first time this week with some coworkers. Delish!! I had the chicken quesadilla, and asked for light cheese...it was perfect. Looking forward to going back soon!!
Great location, good service. Just an okay food experience. Chips were cold and salsa had more corn in it then a sauce dip for chips and salsa. I ordered the shrimp tacos they were pretty good.
YES YES!  Do wish they brought back the jalapeno mashed potatoes! But every time they rock my world with the goto FISH TACO!!!!!
Great service great atmosphere and good food!!!! The mahi tacos and jalape\u00f1o mashed potatoes are good. Will come back and try the tempura tuna tacos
Nova's is great  if you get their fresh bread.  I particularly like their Focaccia\nand their savory scones.\n\nAs far as sweet treats, I love their gingerbread cookies around the holidays.
Awesome beer selection, ok latkes, and surprisingly great coffee. When I wake up a little early, this is my first stop on the way to work.
100% southern comfort food at a great price.  You can't beat it!
Really good food! Service is not great, though. The kitchen is typically slow and it takes a while to get your food. I won't make a special trip to eat here, but if I'm in the neighborhood, it's a good place to eat.
This is the coolest little coffee shop I've found, they always have cool art and they have a great menu and coffees, love it here.
This place is not the same anymore.... Waited about an hour to get mediocre food... even the atmosphere is pretty lame now.
Walked in and ignored by both the bar tender and the server. When we got the server's attention and asked to be seated it seemed like we were interrupting her. \n\nWe walked....
The only bad thing about this place is the que! Other than that the service is efficient the results are delicious and you can see them making it, pretty cool!! What a way to cool down after a day of walking around the city!
We just took our maltipoo here for the first time today and they did a wonderful job. He not only looks great, but he was very happy and loved the employees (rare since they had just groomed him). We are definitely going back!
Hadn't been in years. Now there is a bar. Food is frozen in time - same exact stuff as ten years ago. Mediocre.
Was excited to come here. Brought kids. Awful service. Nasty. Got sick. Do not recommend.
Our dinner was delicious and our waiter, Christopher, was the BEST! He made us feel special and took GREAT care of us! We definitely want to go back.
Intimate ambiance with loads of old school, steak house charm.  This restaurant is a diamond in the rough on a busy stretch of South Blvd.  Go and enjoy your favorite cut of steak and rest assured that the service will be impeccable.
If you like the early 1960s you will love this place if not stay away!  Food was average minus, walls were very dirty, service decent.  Would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.  I was told this restaurant was like Ruth Chris, don't believe it! Stay away.
Over rated.Drinks and Food are over price.
Celebrated my mother-in-law 70th birthday dinner, the food was ok...some of the vegetables were cold, lobster tail was a bit salty; however the servers were nice.
If this is a golf club, I'm the abominable snowman.  Looks like a pleasant place, but there sure as heck aren't any *golf* holes getting balled here.
I love this chick fil a. The customer service is awesome. There are always employees asking if I need anything and making sure I am satisfied. Obviously a great place for kids. The outdoor space and playground is nice and well kept.
Don't mess with entering off of Fairview or Sharon. Park in the back. Much easier in and out.
not sure whats going on,, the place seems very tattered now,  and the food quality has seem to gone way down,, Michael is doing his best I know but sometimes you need to step back and figure out whats wrong :(
I feel like the quality of this place has gone downhill slightly over the years. More globbed on sauces and general blandness. Meh.
Must be a good place at night. The espresso was collecting a social security check.
We stopped based on other reviews on Yelp.  While it is not fine dining, the food was hot and tasty.  I can't wait to try breakfast.  The staff makes the place.  They are polite, caring people taking great care of their customers.
I would have given this Marshall's 5 stars however I felt like the clothes department was fairly small...\n\nBut the home section is great!
All I can say is that it's the Disneyland of beauty supplies....Or maybe Mall of America....
OK sushi. Tried it several times. When I'm shopping at Home Depot, Target or Pet Smart. I get a thing for sushi and cold Japanese beer. Conveniently located in the same parking lot of Home Depot. Every time, disappointed.
Wow did this place suck. I came here for lunch with a work collesfur. I am from out of town but this was the closest place and it did nothing for me. Dirty interior, poor service. I just got a chicken salad and it was not memorable.
Course is in terrible condition - would not go back nor recommend anyone play this course - not worth playing for free
My boss and I go here every week. This place is clean fast and consistent they know us by name... \n\nBeyond that, they have the best club sandwich in Charlotte.
My husband is a professional Bass player and he gets everything he needs from Sam Ash. Today, we traveled 2 hours (from Asheville NC) to come here. We like this place! Decent customer service and they are willing to match prices!
This is a good local bar.  The wings were average and they had a good beer special with 3 dollar Coronas on Wednesday.
The hotel was ok with pleasant staff.  Just stayed one night as we had an early flight.  Our room was average overall and was clean.  I would recommend the North location as it is closer to the airport if you are taking a flight.
Hotel and room were fine but I was very disappointed that they wouldn't let the shuttle take us to or pick us at the light rail station. The other hotels in the area had their shuttles running without trouble. Probably won't stay here again.
Not the hotel of my choice, but definitely fit the bill for sleeping accommodations. The desk staff was pleasant and very helpful in helping us find food at 9:30pm on a Monday night.
The arroz pon collo was a great dish! The plates full of chicken and veggies to fill you up! Make sure to ask for the soft shells to go with it!
This is below average carolina barbeque. I made a special trip for a quick lunch and was very disappointed. The pork lacked flavor, the slaw was yellow from mustard, and the fries were food supply sourced. I had hoped for much better.
One of the worst BBQ I've ever had! Old and very dry! Service was okay. Wouldnt go back if you payed me $100!
Excellent prices. Decent food. Nice staff. Clean and friendly.
Pho was very good!! I had Rare Beef. Prices were the same as other places in Charlotte. I would come here again.
Good amount of food and price is decent
Awesome! Tons of new and used here. CDs, DVDs, bluerays and albums - that have it all. Staff is very friendly.
All the used records here are basically beat up dollar bin records priced at $5 and up. Bad customer service too. Not coming back.
It sucks!!! My room didnt have a trash can! The couch bed was full of springs and cover! But it was roomy and had alot of channels no elevator or handicapped equivalent.
Some friends and I tried Woodlands tonight and were not disappointed. The food is amazing. The Masala Dosa was delicious and the vada did not disappoint. I would highly recommend this place to anyone who loves indian food and pure vegetarian cuisine!
This place is awful and does not meet McDonald's standards by a long shot. Do not stop here. Servic3 is terrible dood is xold and usually comes out wrong.
Great course. Play was a little slow but overall great place to play. The best course in the university/concord area.
Cheap haircuts, done quickly, especially if you check in using their app. My only complaint is that I never seem to see the same person twice, so there is no way to have someone used to the way you want your hair done.
Ordered pizza and cheese bread tonight arrived 1:20 later with some type of cinnamon sticks. Long wait wrong order. Next time order Joe Mommas or Luigis and pick up my fault for being lazy.
To go was nice and hot when I came in.\nWings were VERY GOOD. The maui wowi and the hot ranch. I don't think I would dine in though. I got a pretty cool extra room setup for parties and everything though
I loved this place food is good. chicken. Wing delicious whit variety of the flavor we try all  .also good price en beer
This will be short and sweet!\n\nThis Walmart is always very busy. Its clean and fully stocked. Cheap prices but every time I go its an experience....I mean it's Walmart so I got exactly what I expected.
Chinese food good.I think they should just stick to Chinese food leave asian food alone. Do not Order Hibachi from this place didn't taste like it to me.
Ok food, but this Ohioan wasn't impressed. Clean inside, and nice bathrooms though.
This rental community does not offer its residences a recycling drop facility!
Used to be a great little joint for a quick salad and bowl of soup. But the past few months the service has become a real problem. Too many teenagers, not enough adults.
This CVS has a nice layout and has friendly employees.
$9 for a sandwich only. It was not worth it.
Hands down one of the best restaurants in Charlotte.  Delicious food, yummy drinks, friendly staff.
Great atmosphere, friendly welcoming service and most important the food it is delicious!!! I highly recommend it, specially if you are like me, from out of town. Great experience!!!
Always great food and great experience. We tell our family about it all the time. Our favorite restaurant for sure!
Great food, good value, huge sides and it was really nice to be casual in a steak house.  We will be there a lot.
Just OK. Better options out there. Seems a little tired....Firebirds has better food and prices.
Initial problems with a bathroom vanity but they fixed it.
Livery strong greasy odor all thru dinner
Love the fish and grits! Best in Charlotte!
Both the Gator bites, and the gumbo are amazing; I have never been disappointed by the food.
This place needs some cleaning!!!!!! We tried it because of the great reviews , the buffet was gross, the hibachi chicken was not bad, but just eating it in that dirty place wasn't pleasant.
Being the best pizza in Oregon is about the same prestige as being the best hockey player in Uganda, you don't get alot of bragging rights. The pizza and other menu items are decent , service good and the delivery is fast.
This was my first time trying Culvers. It's nothing special and is comparable to Wendy's or any other fast food burger place.
Went for Sunday brunch. Edible items include bacon and funnel cake strips. Everything else appeared to have been purchased frozen from Sam's club.
Grade: C-\n\nUmmm. Hmmm. Okay. Uhhhh. Huh. Right. What should I say? Yeah.
Best place ever! The staff are trained and educated and create a very comfortable environment. They also help with all kinds of concerns and issues.
Fresh, fresh, FRESH. There is no other fast food chain imaginable that has the local, wholesome, fresh, and ethical outlook that Chipotle does.
Good food. Great location. Good atmosphere (especially in the atrium) and great sangria. We will go back!
If you like sausages, EDM and the smell of bleach, this place is for you! Trying way too hard to be swank in a town much better suited to chill lounge. The only good thing is that I discovered Ami's next door.
Amazing food.\nService was excellent as well.\n\nI suppose when you pay these sort of prices you would better expect great good followed by great service.
Its open late and always hits the spot.  Fries in a paper bag and gyron to go with lots of white sauce on the side.  I've eaten here when not totally drunk and the food is good.  The greek salad and gyros are always a safe bet.
Quick food.  Not surprisingly it tastes like a chain
Haters gone hate
Terrible service, the food was okay. Restaurant was empty but we had to wait 20 minutes for the waiter to come and give us food. We were literally the only customers.
Went there on a saturday night.  Super loud, crazy music, and people all hovering in front of the flavors.  Too chaotic.  Yogurt not particularly good (and it does NOT take a particularly good version to please me.  Dissapointing - just ok.
Great Brats!
short menu, which is cool if ya want a burger or brat and a brew. Thought the brat was good and the beer cold. YOUNG crowd, thought the female bartender was a bit rude that being said had a good time watching the Bama / LSU game.
I always have the beef and egg or ja jang meinn!!one of my favorite take out places for Chinese food in madison!!
The place was awesome. Food was EXCEPTIONAL. And definitely reasonably priced. Check it out. I know that I will be going back.
The flavors are awesome. This is coming from a person who makes Indian food, so i know flavors and spices a lot.\nI am coming here next time too. I had catfish (Kari Lele) and it was tooo good.
Rude, racist, dark. Unconscious drunk people at the bar or at the entrance smelling like urine. Homeless old men grabbing at my date. Pretty much an assault. Place attracts the detritus.
Passable middle eastern and mediterranean food in a nice State Street setting close to campus.
The crowd is not my scene,  but they make a strong yet decent tasting long Island. the main draw for me was competitive foosball almost any night of the week. its been a few years though.
I quite like the place....their entrance is through a quaint-looking garden which sets a romantic mood. The ambiance inside is pretty nice. The food is good. Try the stuffed mushrooms. They can be pretty busy at times so I would call ahead.
OK place but had better.\nSteak was OK although for the price i was expecting better.\nwe were seated on a table and the seats were small.\nNo parking, had to drive around till i found a ramp (with pay meters) not too far.
the outdoor seating was nice.  margaritas were pretty good.  food was not good at all.  So if you want to hang out on state street and have a drink, it's nice.  If you want good food, go somewhere else.
Not sure how good the food is going to be but 45 minutes to get it is unacceptable. No apologies at all from the staff either. Finally got our food. Not worth the wait.  Skip it!
It's true that Kabul isn't really memorable. But its kabobs are good. It feels like a restaurant on a college campus should ... like it's just managing to get by. It's good food.
The food here is soooooooo good.  I ordered a vegetarian dish and words can not explain how good it was.  Enjoy!!!  Cheers!!!
Bait and switch.  They'll let your children participate in creating a craft and then charge you to keep it.
Love the Mac and Cheese.
Won't be coming back.   The food was only mediocre and the service was bad.
Can't beat $2 for a any size latte on Wednesdays.  Small latte?  $2 please.  Medium latte?  $2 please!  Large latte?  $2 please!  You get the idea.  Hint:  I'd go with the large...
Oh and get the weird maple candy waffles!
Fast and tasty sandwiches, good baked goods and soups, and a wide array of micro-brew-y beverages.\n\nThat said, their occasional live entertainment can be irritatingly faux-Joanna Newsom-y.
I like the new location. I have only tried the coffee & pastries so far but both are still excellent. Monkey Bread, mmm. The new space has a nice cafe feel that looks suitable for just relaxing, lunch or a meeting (they still have meeting space).
The place is mainly eh. The sashimi tastes like its B quality from the supermarket. Go to Red or Unami instead.
Good sushi with a reasonable price. Takara is extremely generous with their food and their staff are always very friendly.
I love the margaritas here.  I also like the chips and dip.  This place is best utilized at happy hour, for that reason.
Love this place! Get corn quesadillas!
I've lived in 7 different apartments in Madison with 6 different landlords and everyone pales in comparison to McBride. Need a repair? They've fixed it by the time you get home from work. Easy to communicate with and they keep the pressure off their customers.
The pizza here is like the kind you buy in the freezer section of a grocery store and seriously, I'd rather eat frozen pizza than have pizza here again.
This place is OK.  Shoes must be taken off before you come inside.  Staff was really, really friendly and that was nice.\n\n\nRooms are RIGHT by the kitchen which can be annoying/noisy.  Also gets FREEZING in here at night.
If you want the perfect breakfast, well this is it.  It's so busy because it's delicious.
The food and service are both very good, I do however wish they where open later on weekdays with me being a 3rd shifter the options can be somewhat limited.  I do appreciate that they have no problem calling when the driver arrives.
Speaking as someone who does not eat meat ever/very often, I am not impressed with the food as my options are extremely limited.  I am impressed with the atmosphere and beer selection. If  I lived closer, I'd hang out here.
Great meat selection. best in madison hands down
Best Chinese food in Madison  by far. Friendly staff and quick service!  They carry a wide selection of both traditional Chinese food and American Chinese food.
HANDS DOWN most authentic Asian cuisine my hubby Andi have found in Madison!  Congee love! The chicken was moist and tasty, so good!
The only reason why I go to this place is because it's the nearest Korean restaurant to Madison college campus.  I always go for their Bibimbap on Rock which is the best meal there, in my opinion.  The potato side is really good too!!
Nice to see that Panera is the same here in Madison WI. Good quality food, very nice employees. This is a fairly busy location but they move people through rather quickly.
Great vibe with too many great choices. I had the Frarattoo and would highly recommend it. Very rich and savory grain dish with poached egg. Great baked goods as well.
Hearts topping and not even worth it. Food was surprisingly bad. I had pork and Mac grill cheese which didn't work on many levels. My son's chicken fingers were better than my dish.
Went for dinner with mother and uncle. All three meals where all right but not amazing. The quality to price ratio was off (too expensive). My meal was ordinary with meatballs that where dry and over cooked. Wine was good.
I love the selection of baked goods and breakfast treats for work :)  I've never had lunch or eaten here...someday soon, will have to try it.
This Copps is near my work.  What can you say, it's part of a huge grocery chain.  They have a decent selection of beer and wine at good prices...the reasons I stop here on my way home.  It can get really busy after work, especially on Fridays.
This place used to be better and more knowledgeable and helpful.  I guess I hit bad staff day or something.\ngood prices and a great selection.   \nNeed chairs to sit and read.
Worst cheesy breadsticks! I've ordered this item from other locations and it was great but this location's version was terrible! They were over cooked, cut in half  and with 50% less bread sticks than other locations. Barely any cheese as well.
It was average. Not quite the same as italian delis in Chicago, but ok, I guess.
Good, cheap, fast, friendly. Best fresh chips and salsa.
Mmmm mmmm good!  The catfish was our favorite, but everything was soooo good.  Get the cornbread!
I have been going to Parkway for years. I really like the Parkway omelette. The service is always fast and friendly. What are you waiting for ?
This is a nice little grocer.  I wish their cash register would work better so that you don't have to wait 10 minutes to ring up.  But otherwise its nice.
They announced today they are closing. As you can see due to my previous review I am not surprised. Sad but not suprised.
Whenever we go there, we are hit with a bill of nearly $200 or more. They charge excessivley for small things like looking at some sample under a microscope for 5 mins or $20 for shampoo. We are seriously considering switching.
They charge too much, care is so-so.  I would go to Veterinary Emergency Service.  I wish I could do it all over again.  They will also suggest you take the route that is \"most expensive,\" and prey on your feelings towards our pet.  Stay away.
3 dart machines, a Foosball, a shuffleboard. Wouldn't call this a place for games. Upstairs opens at 11? What's up there that's not open at 9? But as a bonus, drinks are cheap, staff is friendly. Great job.
I love this place.  I've been going to Paisan's since i was about 10 years old.  The best is a Porta Salad and then going on to the Bella Pizza with onion's!  BEST PIZZA I've ever had!
Was here for a work dinner event.  Service was not good.  Very slow too.  Worst service I've gotten here.  Usually gotten better service.
Service was extremely slow and not very useful...never once asked if we wanted something to drink, just brought water out. Took a hour for a 9\" pizza that didn't even have all the correct toppings on it. Food was \"meh\".
A nice list of loose leaf teas, which are served in a light-bulb looking glass ware. This Jiffy Lube converted place is an unexpectedly pleasant coffee shop on the S Park street. Very friendly staff, a fantastic view of Copps, and overall a charming neighborhood cafe.
I was a regular at Nam's till they started decreasing their portion size for the same price.  K23 which was the beef pepper steak with rice is my favorite!!!  But this place does not appreciate customer loyalty, so please don't bother going there.
Always a consitent, great meal.  The service is excellent - we've always had really friendly staff.  I LOVE the beat salad and the mushroom pasta special (served only at lunch).
This is our favorite take out place.  The food is always fresh, flavorful and plentiful.  The owners are very nice also.  We drive out of the way for take out from them.
The only thing irish about this \"irish pub\" is they sever Guiness and have Jameson Whiskey. Otherwise there isn't anything irish on the menu and no irish ambiance at all. Boooring.
Good docs - young but nice and responsive to questions.  The office staff isn't the most pleasant.  \nThe prices are reasonable and the facility is new - very nice.
Monkeyshines is the way to end a night of bad decisions.
Easily my favorite restaurant in Madison. Very attentive waitstaff. I've never had a dish here that I didn't like.
Crappy vegetarian selection. The few things I had were meh. Definitely needs better labeling for the buffet for noobies like myself.
Grade: C-\n\nThe most over-rated restaurant in Madison. Decent food. Outrageous prices. Good service. How this place is still in business amazes me.
one of our favs in Madison, very consistent and good, sister-in-law and mother-in-law were impressed last night
Grade: C-\n\nLess than average service. Almost okay food. Spendy.
The wash was quick and fairly inexpensive-- $10. Yes they missed a few spots on the dash but the rest of the car was vacuumed nicely and the outside looks great. Perhaps my expectations were low given the other reviews, but I'd go again.
Worst car wash I ever got. The inside of my car is still dirty and dusty doesn't even look like I got a car wash. Should of gone to octopus what a waste of 20 dollars
By far the best place for breakfast in CU, and their coffee is always top notch. I've never had any qualms with the service, and never waited for over 5 minutes for a seat. Everyone's super friendly and I always leave in a great mood.
Love the look and feel of the place but I've eaten better food. Came here for breakfast and it was alright, nothing great. The service here was fantastic.
I went here on a number of occasions and was always super impressed with the speed and quality of care I recieved.\n\nFree cold-packs and condoms. What more could you ask for?!?
- Overrated\n- Expensive\n- Hipsters\n\nThree strikes and you're out, Caffe Paradiso.
One of the worse chocolate fraps. It was bitter, to syrupy, and over-priced. I do not recommend this place
I just have to update this to say that they no longer have a minimum for credit card purchases.  Love their spinach and feta croissants!
I took my CCW class here and the instructor was very knowledgeable.  No complaints here and he made me a more accurate shooter.  What more could you ask for?
Dont ever Fly US Airways to Hawaii. The Flight Attendants were rude and very unpleasant. Spend the Extra and Fly Hawaiian Airline.
I like US Airways because they simply fly where I go.
The Worse Airline Ever....God Forbid if they buy AA they will also screw that airline up forever also.
Here is a recipe for success:  take the two worst airlines in the industry and merge them together.  What do you think you get?  One colossal airline that completely sucks
So I'm here every other week seems like, and I haven't had any problem with US airways..
I didn't like this place at all. I came with 3 friends and non of us like there omelets. There were very dry tasting...
Buzzzzzzz in my room all night long coming from the vents. Creepy clicking speaker in the ceiling. Construction noises like a drill sting during the day. I can hear my neighbors talk. Avoid at all cost.
This place used to have really good food. Now you get more than half of your plate covered in bean sprouts. I think its over priced for what you get.\n\nI've always had good service here.
When I want a fast food burger, the Jack Sirloin burger is my go-to. Chez Jack hits the spot en route to or from a night of revelry. This Jack was fast and friendly, can't ask for more.
The jazz pianist is fantastic.\n\nOtherwise the food sucks & the place just creeps me out.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: Great piano music does not make a great restaurant
Very impressed, first time there and they had some extraordinary Art especially the Dancing Swarm of Fireflies by Yayoi Kusama ... that was worth the price of entry alone.\nNice to have Arcadia Farms there too.
I have been to 2 Cultural festivals here. It is a great venue for showcasing food and cultural performances. \nParking can be steep at the garages nearby if you cannot find it for free on the street.
Went today to drop off camaro I rented returned quick and easy and picked up new car for 2nd stage of my vacation picked up r/t challanger fast and easy once again Hertz A+++
Horrible service. 1 attendant checking in cars, at least 20 cars waiting at any point in time. We had to wait over 15 mins to get checked out. Customer service representative was rude when I asked nicely if they could get more attendants out.
I like Miracle Mile Better... We had 2 sandwiches and 2 drinks 28.00 ... Who charges 2.18 for a drink... They were cheap on the BBO...
Yummmmm! Everything was tasty, the koolaid took me back! Wish we had saved room for red velvet cake!
Next time I'm in Phoenix this is my first stop! I ordered the Lo Los with a side of green beans and corn bread. WOW, I love that southern cooking! The sweet tea was amazing and at how many places can you order Kool-Aid on tap!
My wife ate at LoLo's, brought home a dinner for me, chicken dinner. The chicken was dry and over cooked, no taste.  This dinner is not cheap, for the money, not worth it.
Horrible service. Burger cooked wrong and it took 20 minutes to get it replaced. Definately not a place to visit if you have less than 2 hours for lunch.  Entree prices good but $3 for regular ice tea :(
Pretty nice theatre. Great vibes here.
Wanted to try this place out. Went last night and it has been closed down ! Nothing inside and a couple of letters hanging on window from the state.
Highly recommend Caroline for eyebrow waxing. Nice touch, great attitude, & funny!\n\n(Highly recommend not being Indian if you want to avoid eyebrow waxing.)
Moved from Phoenix ten years ago but still crave a cheese pizza and buffalo wings from this place.
Bad feeling about foods and services. We came with 2 women, 3 men and 2 kids, the waiter fogot to bring the drink for us, the beef burn when they fried and used to make the salad.
Great Salon, Excellent prices and you love the work they do.  Ask for Sherry I use her I wont go anywhere else.
This is a place that exists.
Completely disappointed that this course failed to provide notice they were closed. If you are going to be working on the course and the entire facility is going to be unavailable you should consider posting it on your website.
Sometimes you get the uncomfortable feeling in not being welcome there in some parts of the staff is a little bit rude, i I guess you could make the best of it if it was the only place to go, but its not.
Just missed them. They are closed   , I wanted to try the shakes I'll go elsewhere.\nI Stopped by a second time still was not that inpressed but that's just my taste buds maybe you may enjoy it.
stopped in for a few pizzas with the fam. Pretty good pizza, nice local little spot. we had this pizza with meatballs and pepperoni and a margherita. Both were pretty good. Maybe next time I'll try a sandwich. solid 3 stars
Everyone raves about this place, so I tied it. It was just ok. I've had better and worse. I had an Italian sub with chips and a drink. Nothing about the place or sandwich compels me for a return visit.
The service is ok but the food is not worth it.  Found a 10 inch strand of hair in my food!! Gross
The wife and I went to Ritas a couple of months ago and let me tell you its gooood. Will come back for sure. O and thanks to Erin that made our time there awesome.
Been here a few times when I'm in town. Last time was during Phoenix Pride (I wasn't aware that pride was going on) The place was packed and lots of friendly people. If you like bears, then pay this place a visit on a Saturday..
Quite crowded with visitors and very nice music. Awesome!
As a follow up to my previous review - the practice manager called me to apologize for the bad experience and remedy the issue.  I appreciate that they took the effort to reach to me after the fact and let me know that they would address the bad experience I had.
I get all my business cards printed here.  Great, fast, reliable service!!  Dwight behind the print  counter is the man!
Heaven for vegan . \nStay away from the meat. \nGreat desserts. \nTake the Turkish coffee.
Sunday afternoon before heading back to the airport was great. Jack & I met some really nice guys. Good mix of people and the tacos were good and cheap. Fun place!
Ew, never again.
love! always a favorite!
Nice sized parking lot. Friendly staff.
Another fabulous home style Chinese food at The Prime Chinese...... If you like combo fried rice, it is the best ever....
Best chips anywhere, great decor, prime corner location, and no one else has their specialties. XLNT!
Really fun place! Great atmosphere and great food awesome parrots and cool crap everywhere decorated
Very knowledgeable and helpful. I went in for a surety bond and he made it very easy and even provided useful tips to help me out. Definitely going to be getting insurance here when my policy is close to an end.
Saw owner wipe the tops of the red ketchup bottles with the same rag he used to clean the table. Won't go back.
After numerous attempts to resolve and promises to refund prepayment,  and no apology, my money was refunded.......two months later. Thanks Hertz for ensuring my entire experience was poor. Back in Phoenix this month, going straight to enterprise!
Great place to go on a Monday afternoon. There were probably less than 20 cars in the parking lot. I was kind of leery at first because the mall here is sketchy at best, but this was a nice clean theater with friendly staff.
Great food...friendly service...and very reasonable!  Try some of their fresh lemonade instead of BYOB.
This place is fantastic!  Every time I go I try something different.  The family who owns, cooks and serves at Da Vang are very attentive, give great advice on what to try and really work hard to make your experience a good one!  Love, Love Love!
Great staff, awesome eat-in or take home experience.  Fish sauce to die for.  The best Vietnamese food in the Valley.
= = = = = = CLOSED = = = = = =\n\nThis JB's location, with it's poor building layout, poor service & mediocre food finally folded.  Good riddance!     :-)
Same 3 star food as any other location, but here they seem much happier when you are headed out the door than when you come in. Evidenced by their never asking but assuming your order is to go.
THIRTEEN places that sell SHOES??? Run down, small, hard to get in and out of and clientele is very low on the socioeconomic ladder. Do yourself a favor and skip this mess!
Very typical strip mall-ish take out joint. Nothing special at all. Service is minimal and its obvious they just want to get your money and you to get out ASAP. Food was overcooked quite a bit and just not good.
Great Pizza and Pitas, these guys are right down the street from work and we bring back lunch to the office about twice a month. Fresh ingredients, lots of cheese, cant go wrong. If you are showing up around lunch 11:30-12:30, it will be busy.
The food is ok. Average so a 3 however the attitude is a 1. We ordered the Chicken quesadilla and was charged 1$ more than posted. She said she couldn't do anything and didn't credit the difference. Based on that they get a 2.
Good food, good price, good service.
I've been coming to La Pi\u00f1ata for years and it is consistently delish!! Rice and beans are a deciding factor for me and theirs are YUM. I've never had anything not good! Do yourself a favor and ask for the hot salsa!
went to drive thru, Smh. Horrible customer service. The girl made a rude comment after I changed the size of my blizzard. So rude!!! If you don't like your job. LEAVEEEE!
Best to stick to the apple pie.  The breakfast  especially the sausage is reflective of the prices. Cheap.
Historic Institution filled with the coolest cars you've ever seen. Great service, good prices, cool guys. 5 *'s.
I think the dim sum was pretty good but their service was alright.  for some reason they seemed pissed off when they were pushing the dim sum cart.....
The worse service.
Another disappointing experience.  Why can they make good al pastor tacos. Don't even use real corn tortillas. The only good thing was the horchata.
Pricing was very competitive compared to 5 other companies.  Great work and clean- up.  It took them two days instead of 1 day as estimated to remove two 40' high pine trees.  I would use them again if the need arises.
I really love this place they make the best greek salad ever, the customer service is wonderful, they are prompt with my order and the food tastes better each and every time!
This hotel was busy during the weekend I visited, and at times the front desk was short staffed. Noise in the rooms from nearby I-17 was a problem. There are so many hotels in this area, I'll stay somewhere else in the future.
Outback Steakhouse is alright.  They have good salads.  That's about all I can say.\n\nTheir prices are decent if you just want the basic steak meal.\n\nOverall, Meh.  I've experienced better.
I usually get the sirloin,  but the fish dishes aren't bad either.  Steak is always nicely cooked,  along with the delicious side dishes.  Desserts are delicious, save some room for them. The tally nice thing is that they are consistent!
It was what i expected. They packed the box on my two item meal.
Excellent good fresh and delicious with many choices at a great price.  You get it made your way with many different choices of meats cheeses and toppings. Thru also have pastas but I recommend subs they are better.
I had the best customer service from Eric in the fan department today! Thank you for all your help Eric, you helped me more than you can imagine. I appreciate your customer service. Hopefully I'll see you again for more goodies! Your co workers were exceptionally helpful as well!!!
I grew up eating here so i really like it and the atmosphere is cozy I really like it.
Recently renovated. Very effective and well-flowing floor plan. The section for well behaved children and brats is located on the complete other side of the building from the rest of the library. Genius!
Well rude staff. Kitchen was dirty.  Waitress forgot my drink...twice and  the bun looked wrinkles and smashed, won't be back for sure.
Just barely sat in,  at least 10 servers and was not helped out for a long time. Finally got my order in and  staff is not happy at all. Will most likely be the last time I come here.
I love Sardella's!! they have great pizza and the winds are great!! they also have a killer monday special (half price pizza!)  this wings are so good they will make you wanna smack your momma!!
Ordered a pizza for the first time. The tomato taste was so overbearing that you could not taste anything else. Better off going to Little Ceasars.
Holy cow, worst customer service ever. We ordered two premium wraps through the drive through. Took about 20 mins and we were the only people there. We could here the employees screaming at each other whole making our order. Won't come here again!
Portions are huge! There is no way anyone should eat a full meal here. I'd say as far as quality they are average. Great happy hour prices.
Food prepared wrong. Charged for things that we supposed to be complimentary as per our waitress, including entrees and deserts. Not going back to this place!! Manager said she would fix things but didn't.
Excellent job!  Originally went to take a friend and was so impressed with that work that I had them do mine.  Will go back and refer friends.  Chris is friendly, professional and thorough. Car looks great!!!!
Q
Rudest people I have ever encountered.  Husband and wife owned business and when I called for service the wife was unbelievably and unnecessarily rude and demanding.  Don't waste your time calling.
Great service, fast, and friendly hops. Love the happy hour prices before 11am, and 2-4pm. Also their coupons are always a good way to save. I just reloaded a sonic card for $25 and got a free burger coupon!
Gotta have some love for the dive bars!  This really fits the mould.  Great burgers and all the beer you want as long as its a domestic :)
Great place for breakfast and to watch the airplanes land and take off - service has been mixed depending on day of week.  Obviously Sat & Sun am are very busy.
Not exactly what I would call a great place to eat. If you want to take your teenager out for a shake or ice cream you may enjoy it :)
I have been going here for many years, and every time I go it's a great personable experience. When you go to most salons there is always one person (nail tech) you prefer, but at this salon they're all amazing.
Not the best by far. I am going to stick to my location over at Camelback .
Food was good. Waitress \"Maggie\" has no common sense. Spoke with owner and got things cleared up. Still won't go back again.
Arron Kyle and the team at this Guitar Center location went above and beyond to help a local band out who barely made it to the store before the store was closed.  Thanks for the capo and saving the day Arron!
Drive thru chick named Kylie wouldn't take my order because I wanted two separate orders at 1 am. Both very small and simple, with one car in the drive thru other than myself. What a joke.
Never ever going back. The place stinks like cigarettes and the service is terrible. The food is mediocre, ihop may be better. Definitely wouldn't suggest to a friend.
Love their shakes! :)
Kung Paola's good... Trying General Tsao today
Worst staff ever. The ladies at the front desk are horrible. i liked the doctor I had but the staff is the worst
Westrige mall was better than this mall even when most of the stores were about to shut down. When I visited this mall recently most the stores looked cluttered and unkept.
Bad service altogether
Please hire more help in the evenings and keep black walnut in stock! That's all. Thank you.
Love Nurse Purtee. Hate that im always waiting over an hour past my appointment time even when im 20 minutes early. Also hate that I have to schedule immunizations over 6 weeks in advance.
hate the service. please fix
Took my grand kids for first time at this location. Where I come from they skate, not here. Order took a long time, beef way undercooked, fries blah, chick strips not good. No one liked anything...server looked stoned.
I grew up in Arizona and we went to Wongs every Sunday after church.  Three years ago we got stationed in Hawaii.  Everytime I come home, our first stop is Wongs.  I love everything about it.  Wongs is my comfort food.
Great alternative to buffet Chinese. Huge portions and cooked to order. Lunch specials come with more food than one should eat! Pleasant staff and decent atmosphere. I will eat there again.
Great simple Chinese food. We've been going here off and on for years and I'm addicted to their garlic chicken. Staff is helpful, prices are reasonable, and the portions are generous. A good, safe bet for Chinese food.
No nonsense, affordable prices.  Had my Audi in for service with Dan (someone whom I have total confidence in and have known since he worked at Chapman), no complaints as usual.
Tried this place out and the food was ok, what concerned me was the cleanliness of the kitchen. The floor was really dirty, under the burners or stove seemed to have months of grease buildup etc. 50c extra to use debit or credit card btw.
Nice place to stay, good price for. CDL and AAA 49.99  A NIGHT
This is the best drunk food drunk money can buy. Very self explanatory, if not just order a greasy burger and enjoy. Never has any issues with this place at all, always friendly and correct. :)
Save your money guys. This pace is well kept and clean but... food not so much, way over priced for the poor food quality/quantity. Your better off finding a taco truck near by or heck just goto Denny's, you won't be as disappointed there.
Friendly service. They were spot on with the special requests I asked with my order. They made sure to offer sauces and did no ice in my drink per my request. The food came out quick. What more could I ask from Taco Bell
Just went back this weekend. Not as good as 1st few times. A little bit inconsistent...uh oh..inconsistency kills
Don't waste your time or money, incredibly slow service. I get that its family owned however they need to get with the times and truly make a effort to connect with their guests, especially first time guests. Very disappointed.
An old style family restaurant.  A very good value for the money.  My entire group liked the food.  A little bit of everything for everyone.  We ate Greek food, they also have Italian.  Can not vouch for the Italian as we all ate Greek Food.
Down the street from my office, I love this place! The turkey bacon sandwich with lots of their spicy sauce is delicious! And the lady at the cashier always has a joke or pun to tell, makes a crappy day into a better one.
Salad bar was really good including peel and eat shrimp but the fish and chips were AWFUL.  Three tiny pieces that looked like they came out of a fish sticks box from the grocery freezer section.  So disappointing.  Either do it right or take it off the menu.
This is a horrible car wash.  The manager / owner is extremely rude and the quality of the work is terrible.   I would never waste the money to return here.  They only are concerned with up selling detail packages and not with the quality of car washes done.
This location closing.  Going out of business sale going on now (9/2013).  if the parking lot was this packed all the time they would not be closing.  I don't hate Wmart, I just hate being left with nothing but Wmart.
WHOA!  So many things to look at and buy!!!  You can find almost anything electronics there and at many price points.  \n\nI need limit my visits here to save my wallet's life.  LOL!
Kim took care of me. I had powder acrylic on and the last tech messed them up. She put liquid gels on for me. My hands feel clean and pretty. Thank you.
Delicious! Small hole in the wall, slow service but owned and operated by the cutest little couple! Your in for a treat here!
Brayden and shaun Will def take care if you
Great Food....\n\nGood Service\n\nExcellent Management\n\nGood Drinks\n\n115 tv's (guesstimate)
Closed kitchen early because they were slow.  Manager \"Johnny\" is a loser. We had a groupon and he would not honor it.  Hate to say this but we would never try this place again even though we lost 17.50.
The wings are to die for, atmosphere is nice, crowded but spacious enough to eat and be comfortable. I couldn't see the menu cause it's a little dark. Lol prices are great.
We have eaten here twice. Both times hamburgers. They were very good. Service was very good. Atmosphere was very noisy.
Service was great.  Food was good not great.  I can't say I was a big fan of the atmosphere.  Kind of dark and dingy.  I'd go again but this restaurant probably wouldn't be my first pick.
Nice place, clean, spacious room.
Extremely fast service food was out quick and fresh! Would most likely come back soon! Recommend this to anyone.
Great bagels! Not the best atmosphere but good coffee and bagels. Fair prices, friendly staff... I will definitely go there more often.
I never write reviews for fast food, but this place was clean and the staff was pleasant.  The food, well it was Taco Bell would you expect anything different, it was good
Absolutely AVERAGE donuts; not terrible but nothing special. To be honest I'd give the QT a higher mark for donuts than Bosa.
Best doughnuts in Chandler. Fresh doughnuts made throughout the day. Every drink under the sun besides coffee.
We have been taking all of our dogs to Dr. Weikhorst for more than 10 years. He is a very compassionate doctor and a pleasure to work with. We recommend his services to everyone.
Drive-up ordering box broken for months, today at lunch ordered a Double Del Cheeseburger but they had no meat to make burgers.  Need I say more! Off too Whataburger.
Not much to look at inside, the building is deceiving from the out side I thought there would be a lot more to look at. Walked and read the whole place in 30-45min
Pretty good and they deliver! The nachos are excellent and they put the cheese sauce in its own container and is more than enough for an extra side of chips. Most locations are cash only which can be a bummer
There is a reason Milanos has been in business as long as they have! The selection is great and it is one of those few places that you can establish a relationship with the guys working there.
Very professional and friendly to this visitor from cold Chicago here for Cubs spring training. Fit me in last minute. Great wax and pedicure - personalized service. Highly recommend.
Cranky old man who has been in the business too long. If his work product was great perhaps it would be worth it but his results are hit and miss. I would not recommend going to this man.
Great Chili Cheese fries and plenty of sports channels to pick from. Impressive shot menu as well. We'll definitely be back!!!
It's old and smells off!  Always have to wait in long lines to check out AND NO SELF CHECK OUT!  Never been impressed with Basha but this is one of their low end stores.
The staff seemed friendly, until I got my car back after denying their $300 brake replacement job. They broke an item in my car and they refused to admit it, plus the AC was on full blast.
I'm not as enthusiastic as the other two reviews, but this is above average in terms of food.  However, the atmosphere is lacking in comparision.  It really is a hole-in-the-wall.  If you want something different than a chain, you may want to consider it.
one word:  awesome!
One of my preferred pizza places.
Barro's is always awesome. When I call in an order its usually ready faster than they say it will be, and their meatball pizza is delicious.
Very disappointed with the 1 hour delivery on a Wednesday evening when we live across the street and we only ordered 2 things.  The food for tge price is not worth it.. I will never order from this place again!
Third time here. Not as good as before. Salmon not tasty, salad over loaded with dressing. Wait staff good. Restaurant clean.
One of the best gyro places in Arizona!  Large, flavorful, hot, fresh portions with fabulous tzatziki sauce!!
Prices are great, but the quality isn't the best. you have to pick threw on a few items to find something fresh
Soupy pasta sauce, very unremarkable house salad. Not great atmosphere in a little strip mall  Would not return.
Great German beer and food. I will be back!!
German cafeteria food. period.  I had the special: stuffed roast pork, red cabbage and spaetzle. (sp)
Small and quaint, the servers are friendly. Food is good, coffee is hot. Even in summer, they have decent patronage. I  sure the winter will be busy. We always like small, locally owned business - and we love our breakfast places.
They need to lay off the ice. More than 3/4 of my drink was full to the top of ice. Two sips and you're done. Is it worth 7 bucks for a crappy meal? Nope!
Pizza is great but this place is overpriced for what it is.
I just felt that the calamari was bland.  The roast beef sandwich was too fatty and the au jus was too salty.  Tirimisu was deliscious though.
Great donuts and friendly service I highly recommend & good coffee. I have no idea what the guy was complaining about the owners English was fine
Not my favorite of the local baristas but it's Starbucks...terribly consistent.
One of my favorite \"cheap eats\" places. T-bone steak & eggs dinner is the hidden gem on the menu! See photo
They have great food if you can get service.   Last time I went wewaited 30 min and didn't have any service at all so we left and done 20 min to another restaurant. We just phone order wings and pick them up now
Don't waste your time.  It used to be good.  It's not anymore.
This place was bought out by another person a year ago. He named it Taka Sushi but hasn't changed the name on the outside.\n\nThere are a few servers left from the old owner but they hate it. Ending in service going down hill.
Stay away.  Avoid at all costs.  Don't move here even if it's free.
Ambience is great. Love the band and dj on Friday and Saturday nights. Food is ok. The service, however, is horrible. Been going there for a few years and the service keeps getting worse (with the exception of Mike).
Don't go here if you need anything. They tried making it into a super Walmart but failed miserably.  There is no one around and if you need anything, go to the other two walmarts that are 3 miles apart, in the opposite direction. Super fail.
Pricey for what you get. Pretty good flavor. Service was ok. I'd say go to Elmer's right down the street instead.
I'll be honest I was not impressed with the food. Very in seasoned and greasy. Service was slow. I also received a dirty water glass and silverware. This was my first and last visit. I give it 2 stars because the cost is low.
Swanky Wendy's --- Good stuff.
It was an ok restaurant, but the service wasn't that great, they didn't pay attention to the customers and one of their machines is broken... which was supposedly also broken in another review.
This is a great restaurant. We ate here several times. Great food, ambience and location. Very polite staff.
Had a couple beers at this out of the way dive bar.  Rough crowd.
I never had any major complaints about Enterprise. Make sure you bring the car back how you left it(as far as gas is concerned) or they will charge you $10, a gallon.
You just lost our business.. no longer open on Sundays is a very bad decision. Religion and business does not belong together.. seperate
Good pizza not the best! But good
Pizza is good...we've ordered lasagna for take out too before and its good. Friendly service.
The food is good, but no better than any other Mexican restaurant. The prices are ridiculous! $3.50 for one taco. Probably won't be going here again, unless I win the lottery.
Total bait and switch sales department! Will tell you one price over the phone, then quote you another when you arrive! Happened to me personally 3 times. I bought from Scottsdale BMW. One quote, one price, done deal. Buyer beware...
I totally agree with Melissa H about the cake (having been in attendance at her wedding).  The cake was delicious !
Great customer service.
I was given a $200 gift certificate here from my sister with no expiration date! According to the Arizona State Statutes, an expiriation date must cleary be disclosed on the certificate, however, Total Bliss said that their policy is 1 year and will not honor my certificate.
I went in to look at some tile. They have a great show room with many decorating ideas!! I'm so glad I went there. I got a great price and my floor looks great!! And the price was right!
Love Tony for my nails and Lisa for my toes and eye brows! Great please... clean,  affordable...
I had heard about how good this place was and when there was a deal on HOmerun..i bought it..I have had many facials and was surprised to learn something new about my skin..awesome and informative facial!!!!!
Although, I really liked my lash extensions and Patrice, I purchased a pre-pay to get my fills, and now they've closed SHOP!!!
The Challah Bread French Toast was unique.   A good menu with items that are not associated with the normal \"breakfast place.\"  \n\nBusy place but efficient and friendly.  I would love to go back again if I make it back in the area from Chicago.
I finally made it to the breakfast club! The food was delicious and the place was gorgeous.
The breakfast menu is excellent.  Our group of nine was seated quickly and the service was great.  It's definitely a place I would return to for a brunch date or a special occasion.
Great spot to start your day. Fresh orange juice. I highly recommend just make sure you have time for waiting cause they always busy.
great time
This bar definitely feels like it should be on the beach in Mexico, and if it was it would be awesome! I thought it was just okay, not the best crowd, and a little run down. Probably won't be going back because there are so many other good places in the area.
Didn't come here to eat just drink but can't really go wrong with 2.50 coronas this is definitely is a college bar and a bit noisy what's wierd is there Oregon duck fans and not ASU fans? Great place for day drinking though
pretty laid back, good drinks and food. a couple times i went and the misters were broken and leaking. otherwise, like it
Food is good. The burger is great. The service a bit slow and dreamy. They think they are Bohemians and they aren't. Finally avoid the owner she is a complete ditz and space case...just smile and avoid this cat lady.  Cheers.
I'm sleepy so this will be short and concise. Had the garlic mushroom omelet. It was delicious! Nice patio to sit and eat breakfast. Will definitely be back!.
Totally average experience. Service was s.l.o.w.... The hummus plate was bland and boring with the pita bread stale and all curly in the edges. Save your money on that dish.
Old Town Scottsdale revolves around this place.  If you visit, have a drink, late night bar hop and enjoy.
Nice bartender. Calamari was awful. All you taste is the frying batter. Sushi rolls were fine. Beer was cold! Happy Hour is better spent elsewhere.
The food was pretty good; although the meatballs were a little too drenched in soy sauce. I wish the bar was a little bigger. They only carried a couple of beers and I like variety...all in all, it was pretty good.
very nice staff, great wine selection, and incredible food.\n\nhave been going there for 5 years, have had one bad experience out of 40.
Not only is the food delicious but the service was amazing! We ordered the meat and cheese platter with a caprese salad. It was the perfect combination for a hot night. We took our time, enjoyed the food and we never felt rushed. Now it's your turn!
You've got great food, no cover, stripper pole, beer pong tables, midget bar, strong drinks, fun atmosphere, no dress code, patio, food... What isn't to love about this place?
I think they did a really nice job with the remodel and expansion, not long ago. It is a Walmart that doesn't feel a  like a slum.
Three words: bland, expensive, bland. I went with a friend and she ordered a ham sandwich and I ordered crab cakes. We were both disappointed and found this place way OVERRATED. I think you pay for the atmosphere because the food is just your average lunch.
Man, this store is bad ass! If I lived in the area, this is where I would be shopping!
The Phoenician is a dated property and in need of a facelift.  Spend your money elsewhere!
A wonderful experience as usual.  The only hiccup was when a bartender was rude to us, but the a manager (Matthew) swooped in and made sure we were completely happy!  We love the Phoenician!
I will never take my vehicles anywhere else! This is the best, most honest and great Company. Thanks!!!!!
Just wanted to agree fully with Bill (the other reviewer) for his review regarding the event 'Beat the Heat Winterfest'.  I don't understand why this event wasn't canceled when it was so hot with no AC at the facility.  An incredibly disappointment.
Wow this place is awesome!!! Cool people and there's a hot lady that works in there. Yup. Go do some business at Hilands Cigars if you like good deals, and chilling!
Disappointing and not very good.
AWESOME chips and salsa! I ordered the Carne Asada steak and it was cooked perfectly! Their double Cadillac margaritas are AMAZING!
Food was tasty. Service was SLOW.\n\nI have been back twice since this dinner, and my two-star review stands.  The food is no doubt good.  However the wait time is extremely lacking and will make me consider other establishment in the future.
I have eaten here a few times and have had amazing food and good service. This has been my wife and I place for dinner over the past couple of years. The food, is fantastic and the service is great.
We had the Mezcal drink! Great. On to the Duck confit stuffed Rellano. OMG. The best we've ever had!
Service was spotty and the kitchen was not clean. \n\nIt used to be my favorite restaurant in Arizona now I'm debating if I'll give it another chance.
Great service and good food. It's a standard classic breakfast place that has all the expected menu items. I had the pancakes one morning and eggs another and both came out really good.
Everything is awesome.  Guac.  Their unique version of carne guisada tacos.  Carne con Queso was unique.  Redfish was tasty as well as the filet and Grouper.
Food was decent but not amazing while the service was pretty slow.  Atmosphere was rather stale and uninteresting so I'd recommend take-out.
A good place to meet with some friends for some drinks, but I agree with the space issue.  Just moving from one side of the bar to another can get downright acrobatic.
Now offering free towel dry with #3 or #4 which are $8 and $10. Your simple and mediocre drive thru car wash. At least they aren't trying to sell you on much!
All I can say is wow. Easily some of the best Italian food I've had. You certainly get what you pay for, the portions are no joke. If you are in the mood for a classy, delicious Italian dinner... this is the place to go!
Great night was had with 20+ guests. Have had Indian food in parts of AZ, as well as New York and Australia, this was one of the better places that's for sure. Staff were friendly and attentive and the meals were served quickly. Well worth a return visit.
I'm all about the tiki thing and the patio but this place is just trashy. It's obvious that this is first on the list for every guy who just turned 21. Everything had a thin layer of barf on it.
I could go into a long story about what happened but basically the girls taking cover and the bouncers can't count and are douches.  Will never go back to the place again.
Great ambience, okay service, boring food. Food was typical \"fusion,\" heavy on the pseudo-Chinese influence, kind of like a Thai-inspired PF Chang's. Definitely not terrible but I won't go back.
Service was as good as could be expected.  Atmosphere was very nice with elegant lighting and smooth jazz playing or Spanish guitar, thus the Fusion.  Food portions were generous and presented nicely.  Will definitly frequent this place.  Thank you!  Steven
Heard about this place from friends. Was excited to try it. Not really impressed. Food was just flavorful enough to not be bad. Meh....egg rolls were mushy inside. Sugarcane chicken was ok.
Horrible Customer Service!  No smiles, no personality, they called me \"You\" the entire time I was there.  Very Bad
i really want to give it 5 stars but my carne adovada sometimes is kinda fatty. i love this dish but hate sometimes picking through fat. they do have the best chipotle ranch ever!!!
One of my favorite restaurants!  Love the Enchantment Platter. The Habenero burger is the hotest hamburger I have ever eaten.  Its awesome but beware!!!!
Fun building to be in and great, fresh mexican food.  This place is off the main strip of old town but worth the detour.
I have been going to Don & Charlies for years and am amazed how consistant the food and service is. Love the creamy cole slaw, liver, Seattle Salmon and especially the ribs. The memoriabelia is a Major League plus.
Went to Uncle Sals last night for dinner with a bunch of friends.  We had a great time.  Friendly, gracious and efficient service.  The food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable.  We had everything from seafood to chicken.  Everyone raved about their entree.
Love this place. Truly one of the best Italian restaurants in the valley.. Great ambiance. Authentic Italian food. Very reasonable priced as well. Great service
I have never had a bad meal at Uncle Sal's. This is the type of italian place that has you unbuttoning your pants at the end of your meal AND taking left overs home! Great wine selection too!
What a waste of money.  I got home and cleaned off all the missed spots and glass that wasn't cleaned.  Not to mention when I was there I was hassled to upgrade to everything, even fixing my windshield. WTF
Do not go here! Horrible service! Horrible attitudes!! Stay away!!!!!
Oldest tavern in Scottsdale, and still the least Scottsdale of any bar in Scottsdale.   Go early, go late, its always good.
Definite dive bar in Scottsdale, but fun all the same.  The regulars and the bartenders were great entertainment!  Cheap beer and good people watching...fun place for a Saturday afternoon!
Came here for the first time. A roach crawled on my arm the first five minutes. Not a good thing.
I heard the music from the sidewalk and wouldn't even walk in. What a basic and lame name. I did not see any reason to go in there. I would rather walk around and listen to Andre Nickatina.
Place was good. Very friendly owners. Menu was good if you're looking to stay with a familiar territory. I could defintely tell this was a place many regulars go. We found John to be a very nice guy.
The guy working there was nice.\nTheir food is not great at all.\nThere is a full bar, which is nice.\nThere is nothing on draft (all bottles).\nBut they accept credit cards, so that is good.
Terrible in every way, worse place I have eaten in recent memory and it is expensive.  This must be a front to launder money because I don't know how else they stay in business.
Average sushi.  Young crowd.  Good happy hour.  Much better sushi can be had elsewhere, but it can be quite the swinging scene if you are into that sort of thing.  I used to come here when I was in college if that tells you anything...
we are huge fans of their reverse happy hour on sundays. we get great service and are out of there before the uppity crowd arrives for some fool-snobbery. ra is a great sushi staple in the valley.
Overpriced and not even very good. They were ok when I didn't know of better sushi options in Phoenix.
Awesome lunch specials for crazy cheap.  Greta sushi as well. Never had a bad experience.
I ordered the spicy shrimp whichis noted as very spicy.  It was so NOT spicy and NOT flavorful.  However I had a nice time inspite of the food.....
Love this place for Mexican food and margaritas.  My fave is their fish tacos, but all their food is good.  Prefer their outdoor patio area to the inside restaurant.
The food at this place was quite greasy and lacking flavor. I wouldn't call this place authentic as it's just a lot of fried food with greasy yellow cheese. I do NOT recommend this for visitors looking for authentic Mexican food.
Yummy!!!!    Very good.   Wow, calzone personal can feed two.   :)
You want Italian? You're no where near New York? Go to grimaldis. NY pizza at its  finest. Great service, great food, great venue. Thank you!!
Great reception upon entering and great food!  No one will be disappointed (unless you are looking for a real fancy place with fancy menus), but I bet the food at the Italian Grotto is better!
Owner is an arrogant prick!!! Don't care if the food is good or not, but there are too many good restaurants in old town to give this guy your hard earned $$$$
Nice ambiance and good seafood for AZ. Would definitely recommend this place. Waiter also gave us free dessert!
Did not like any of the art/photos on display.  Is it really art?  Photos were a bit disturbing, but not in a good way.
Me and a friend came here after dinner at the Pink Pony to have a drink and people watch. Great service and a pretty center bar to relax. I'd like to come back for dinner here.*
The Office Max in South Scottsdale get's the job done. They have a good selection of office products.
This place is downright awful.  The only reason I'm giving it one star is due to location to Old Town and the staff were nice.  Otherwise it would get a negative score.  Pony up the extra dough and stay at the Marriott or Hilton... you'll thank me.
High end coffee shoppe with a local \"feel\".
The service is ok, but the staff always seem put off or distant.
The people that work here are amazing. All of them. They're not only friendly but they take care things. Great experience every time.
This place has the coldest beer in town period and the hottest bar dancing women after 9:00pm in the planet! at midnight the real fun starts, but that's a different story best experienced and not told. this is a biker super hot spot during Arizona Bike Week.
I love the pizza here. I come here all the time with friends. The pizza is always delicious and the lunch specials are incredible when it comes to price. I have only had a couple encounters with snotty teenage workers but otherwise it has always been great.
This is a fantastic spot for views & a healthy lunch!  Love the Bento boxes...all under 400 calories & delicious!  Keep it up Sanctuary!
I love Roy's - almost everything is delicious and the service is top notch.  \n\nThey no longer serve bread and butter?  What's up with that?
One word: NIRVANA!
At Rita's kitchen restaurant staff is somewhat condescending; I got the entre size salad on a dish so small that is difficult to eat out of. Food is OK, expected. Big hang out place, bar area seems to be more popular.
Lovely...swimming in the pool with that amazing view alone is worth the trip.   Maybe you'll be as lucky as I was and a hummingbird will fly next to you to have a drink from the pool... Heaven, no: Paradise Valley!
A favorite place for more than a decade. Very consistent and an attentive staff that has been there for years and years.
Great atmosphere great ice cream and burgers friendly staff best DQ around looking forward to come back again
Food and drink are great.  Service is always really slow for happy hour.
Lon's is heaven. Sit outside at sunset and smell the pinon fires, watch the sun go down and enjoy the great food.
A wonderfully leisurely Sunday Brunch
A friend recommended Lon's, and I am thankful that she did. I went there for brunch, and thought the food and atmosphere were terrific. The price was also very fair for a meal of that quality. The service was also quite good.
This restaurant is always a treat. Great food and great service. The outside area is a wonderful experience.
The food is excellent, the wait staff is efficient, the place is dull.  Don't go for the vibe.  It's really, really dull.
We went in for late snacks at about 12:00 on a Saturday night. The waitress was new and ordered us the wrong food and it took for ever to get to our table. The food was just okay.
I was pretty disappointed to find out that they do not carry any type of yard art or Talavera pottery... \nI'm always looking to add a little something.
The Chicken and Gyro meet are great
I enjoy good Persian food. This place is good.  Cherry Rice misses the mark, but everything else is tasty. Very affordable too.
Great tasting Persian food. The quality of food is just great.
Not sure if this has changed hands, but the gyro I got had minimal meet at best. Big dissatisfaction. Won't be back
Best place to eat in AZ
Good gym overall. Filled with a few meatheads and people posing for competitions but they don't bother anyone and provide some entertainment. I appreciate that the trainers are independent and you aren't haggled to sign up for a session with them- they are just there if you need them!
I like it for the selection of beers, however, I hate the bar itself. I would rather go to Total Wine and bring my beers back. \n\n4 stars for the selection\n2 for the shitty bar atmosphere\n\n3 average.
The orange blossom beer is great and the staff is friendly enough. However, waiting 2 hours for your food is unacceptable and I would only recommend this place to people who want to hang out for a while and drink beer.
I've been to Papago and handful of times and love the low-key tavern like environment. I have only tried their Orange Blossom Beer- It is tasty. I want to go back and try their food.
Without a doubt one of the best and most friendly places in town. The Filet is the best and most tender. Friendly staff and seller service. Don't miss it
Should be 3 $. 10oz filet $48. Presentation looked good, sauce on the ribs and chicken was a little thick, salads were very good and so was the bread.
I don't understand why they act so unfriendly and provide such loose deadlines. Two weeks was what I was informed that it would take to fix my unit. I followed up after 9 days and was told now it will be three weeks and they haven't even started working on it.
Seriously, Woohoo! As good as it gets. The world would be a better place if all the stores treated their customers the way they do at Bob's Bike shop. Dale is absolutely awesome.
One of my favorites! Ive been there twice and got the soft shell crab which was exceptional.  The oysters are very good too for apppetizers and so is the manhattan clam chowder. It looks very small from the outside but the restaurant is underground.
This place has awful customer service and a bad attitude. It was like being in eastern Europe where attendants think they are doing me a favor by selling me something. No thanks. I won't be back. Meditate on that.
This place is THE best place for Italian Deli sandwiches in all of Phoenix (but located in Scottsdale) the bread is incredible! It's definitely an institution! Just GO!
Always will get my tires at Discount. Service and prices pretty much are hard to beat. The staff is always helpful, friendly and knows tires. HIGHLY recommend them!
For a membership only place, this place was very sub par. The food was something I would expect from a local dive bar, not a country club.\n\nThe only redeeming factor is the view of the course/camelback and the strong drinks from a limited bar.
These guys did a radiator flush for me a few days ago - The manger was the one that helped me - he was fantastic!
Been going to this car wash for a few years now. It gets slower and slower every time. Sat in waiting area for an hour last time. Not going back. 15 workers and its terrible
Ace is always more expensive than other places, but the folks there sure are helpful and know what they are talking about.
This place it is not a buffet and will not honor the 15% stays the contract has expired,therefore will not do it. Overprice and unfriendly customer service.
I went for their lunch buffet and was expecting a buffet. It was a few dishes and the honey chicken turned my mouth into a glue trap. Haven't been back since.
Okay, I love Oregenos and wrote glowingly about Ray's and NYPD a few days ago, but this is not them. It is something I crave every so often, so I really need to learn to fight these urges.  Ugh!
Super expensive. Half this stuff you can get online for 3/4 cheaper. The people who work here are also pretty rude and almost none of them are knowledgeable about their products. It's like they get their stock from adamandeve.com and then hike up the price 60%.
They have a decent selection but make sure to look at the expiration dates of the condoms you buy here. They frequently sell expired condoms. Or at least, condoms with incorrect expiration dates. I have better luck buying condoms at gas stations. Watch out.
Went here yesterday and was extremely disappointed. Both of the bagels that were ordered were burnt to a crisp (see posted photo). We got the bagels to go, so we didn't notice until we got home.. Really disappointed
Terrible customer service- did not answer their phone when I called for the status of my truck. I was quoted one price and charged more. Never called when my vehicle was done- would not recommend this place to anyone!!!
Ra is the worst place to go for sushi.
It was nothing special. Slow service by tiny ladies. The potatoes we had with brunch were not so good, and the menu selections were skim and did not show much originality. However, my girlfriend LOVED the smoked bacon!
I liked the food here, and the service has always been good.  I've been here for lunch with coworkers or to watch a game with friends.  No difference in quality at any time.
I've always had a great experience with this place.
Whisky selection is limited. But food is good. Crusted calamari is a delicious appetizer
Beer was great, atmosphere was great, food was great.
Awesome Atmosphere and Awesome Beer.  Great building with plenty of outdoor seating.  Got the Fish n Chips and they did not dissapoint.
Food was exceptional for a brew pub.  Beer was some of the best I've tried.  Service was prompt and courteous.
Best beers you can get in the valley.\n\nKiltlifter, SunBru, 8th Street, Peach Ale you can't go wrong with any of these.
Needs to turn on their fans for lunch dining area because its super hot in Tempe area. Overall, i like the music atmosphere is amazing. Customer service was okay but lunch rush hour was busy. Love the burgers! :)
Amazing patio at night! Perfect for relaxing! I love that it is in the heart of Tempe, but doesn't feel like it! The veggie burger & Kiltlifter are heavenly! The Oatmeal Stout is perfect for winter!
Goog food , great brew , a bit hot inside this place . Tv's are small to watch the game , bathrooms are dirty
Can't go wrong with their IPA!
I use to enjoy this place. But, I just had a bad experience for lunch. I even heard my server talking to his colleagues about how bad the tip was from the previous table. Also, they were out of the first two beverages that I asked for.  Will not be going back anytime soon.
The cornbread ROCKS it every time.  It sort of reminds me of Thanksgiving corn casserole.  And it's free!\n\nI recently had the chili relleno and it was tasty but could have been heated up a bit more.
Scale of 1-10 (single visit):\n7 Food\n9 Service\n7 Atmosphere\n7 Value
Makes me hungry for In-n-Out.
A solid place to get a freshly prepared burger. I like their onion rings also.
Great shop.  I can't 89 agile why anybody would complain about speed of service.  Slow is better when doing mods.  This ain't jiffy lube.
great salads and their fries and chips are to die for.My friend's love their grilled cheese (not on the menu) and i've always had awesome. service. Great place for lunch and a good beer!
We had to put our own tables together to accommodate our party of 8.  The service was very slow.  The server was forgetful.  AND... The Chicken California flatbread pizza gave my wife food poisoning!
The food is excellent but the service is horrible.  If the service was even just ok I'd give them 5 stars
Holy cow!!!! Best chorizo is right! Glad I checked the yelp reviews. I made fabulous breakfast burritos & killer burgers from the chorizo. This is my new jam 4 chorizo & tortillas
Pretty solid Ethiopian food. My only comparisons are Chicago-based, but this was a nice find. (This is really late...so I hope they're around and still serving the same I had - it was awesome!)
Hidden charges, flavorless sauce, crust wasn't cooked long enough, and they delivered the wrong toppings.
I've had this a few times since.  Delivery takes forever, customer service is god AWFUL.  Seriously, these people are such assholes.  You get what you pay for, and this place is still a ripoff.  Should never be more than a star.
One of our old standbys... friendly service, great food and not too pricey.  We always seem to get the spring rolls (Gai co cuan?) and beef with noodle bowls (Bun Bo Nuong) and I love the home-made lemonade
Oh god. Yes.\n\nThe Pho Tai here is pho king incredible.\n\nBest in the pho king Valley.
Great Pho and fast service.
Breakfast all day. Healthy portions.  Tiny diner but food was very fast.   No substitutions and no Amex.
Other than a couple waitresses with big jugs this place doesn't have much to offer. The food is bland and over priced. Only positive thing I can say is that that they warm up their muffins.
Great for breakfast/brunch! Delicious and hardy meals. We were served extremely fast and the atmosphere was fun.
The corned beef hash comes from a can, and includes an extra side of hashbrowns.  Yes, that means hashbrowns served with hashbrowns.  Are these people dumb?
Chipped beef on toast, corned beef hash, biscuits and gravy and eggs maximillion all excellent!
Common eat spot for my work peeps. People literally fly in for the Big Rigg! I somehow always order and pay for a cookie, but never see it, though. Suppose it's just some sort of karmic \"fat tax\"
Took forever to get tab. Felt ignored
This place is closed...\nNot sure why yelp hasn't updated the information yet...
This place is pretty trashy, I'd rather smoke my hookah at home.
Fun little concert venue with indoor and outdoor stages.  They have Hop Knot on tap which makes me happy.  Would not ever have a mixed drink there again however...there is something really off in the flavor of their fountain soda.
The tandoori chicken was overcooked and dry. The chicken tikka masala was a bit too salty. They serve garlic naan and give you free chai tea so that was nice.
Love to rock climb... But the staff at this gym were extremely rude and impatient! Won't be going back here because of them
very authentic but thats about it badly poured guinness and awful bangers and mash bartender was friendly but dont think ill be returning
Good vegan junk food.  Honestly, stay away from the healthier-sounding items - most of it that I've had tastes nowhere near as good as the sauce-drenched fried seitan sandwiches.
The food is good.  They put a little thought into their offerings.  If you like meat, I recommend you avoid the 'mock\"; no matter the form, mock does not taste like chicken.  If you're a mock eater, you already know Green.\n\nMike
I love the food at Green. I've tried many other vegan restaurants in the valley and Green is by far my favorite. Please consider opening a Chandler location, I would be able to go way more often.
Stopped by with my son after the zoo.  Clean, friendly and the food was good.  Portions are quite large, so definitely a great value for the price.  We will return.
Good neighborhood sports bar. Friendly staff and good management. Enjoy the pingpong n bags games for outside patio
This place has zero customer service. They lost my clothes after I confirmed they had them. The owner looked at me and told me there was nothing to do. She is miserable... DO NOT GO HERE!!!!!!!!
Great food!! The Tadiq is my fav. Love the Cornish Hen also. The kabob and steak kabob are awesome!! Yummy !!!
We went there with high hopes & but got disappointment.\nMany of the items had just rice with charred vegetables without any spice. Even meat items had no taste. We felt it too costly for the quality we got.\nDesserts were okay.
they always take great care of our little girls, even though one of them is not very friendly to other dogs. they give meds, frozen treats, and for extra, will offer play time and more treats. i especially like the report card they give you at pick up.
Use to stop by for the cheaper gas, fell in love with soda fountain!
Everything I've ordered from here has been pretty good. I will often stop here when I don't feel like cooking and the food comes out fast. The atmosphere isn't the greatest, but I'd you're doing take out that shouldn't be an issue.
Three words:  food borne illness.  Frankly, their food isn't tasty enough to warrant the risk.
Friendly wait staff.  Authentic ingredients.  However the shawarma are nothing like I had in Kuwait.  The shish kabob is worth getting.   Basmati rice needs some work.   The market next door is great.
Great meeting place for a family dinner, friend get together or to use the big room upstairs for a party. Really good skinny margarita! Their salsa is a little watery. The street chicken tacos are really good!
They've just never been a bike store that is really pro cycling, I mean not really there for cyclists. Everything is an argument, the work they do sucks, they have cheap bikes that are better than department store shit, but only just better...
This is mostly for the Imaging Center. \nGreat service; love the staff.\nGreat rates on processing.\nGo shoot some film and get it done here.
the food was good. beans are delicious. however portions are too small (compared to black bear where I usually do breakfast)the service was ok.
The desserts are a little bland and are pricey given the small size.  I've had better Japanese bakery items elsewhere.
Banana Shake and Seasoned Fries. \n\nStick with that and you are good to go!
Hard to complain, fast service, good prices
Nice small caf\u00e9 shop with machine sales on the side.\nBut as for coffee....not many choices & tasted bad.
It's cheap soup with cheap veggies, but when you're a college student and you're hungry and poor...this is a place to go.
low prices for an eclectic selection.
Attended a seminar here. The rooms were spacious, and catering for breakfast/snacks and lunch was good. The parking lot here is fairly large, so finding a space isn't too much of a problem.
Fantastic food for fantastic prices (from Chicagoan point of view!) and the service could not have been better. The pear & Brie Fremch toast was unique & delicious!
This place probably has a delicious full menu. But I wouldn't know. The prime rib and the Filet Mignon is so succulent and yummy that I have not bothered to try anything else.
Very good food! I tried it after the article about 21 best sandwiches in Phoenix. The Reuben was good, but looked nothing like the picture. Great place to enjoy a great AZ day
Went for Mother's Day.  Food was awesome and the waiter recommended the perfect wine.  Very impressed.
Food was good but the service was the worst ive ever had. To top it all off, my server charged my card a different amount than was on the receipt. $17 more to be exact! Will never go back.
Meh.  Had the filet and it was a little bland.  My salmon was very fishy.
One of our favorites... Great service, delicious food \n, and nice ambience.. Perfect for date night
Cozy atmosphere in the inside and lovely patio. Food and service was great both at lunch and dinner. I highly recommend saving room for dessert. I would have given it 5 stars but I just wasn't a fan of their cocktails.
It's a dive but I swear this is the best grilled chicken sandwich I have ever had.  We used to come here a couple times of week when I was in college.  The BBQ sauce is to die for.  And it is so cheap.
Loved the food, but I've had a hard time going back, as they only take cash.
This store is expensive, dirty, and basically a place to walk to when you're too drunk to drive to a real grocery store for more beer.
The food was disappointing to say the least. The panang was extremely watery, the sweet and sour chicken, which was supposed to be pork but she got it wrong, was mostly vegetables light on the chicken, and the chicken pad see you (spelling is way off) was extremely dry.
Very disappointed. Ordered chicken Pad Thai to go and I didn't notice until I got home that they put tofu instead of chicken. The flavor was very plain, there wasn't even peanuts in it. Don't recommend.
Great place on Sunday afternoon and sitting outside. I'll be a regular.
My all time favorite bar of all time. I frequent here at least 3-4 times a week. I have been doing that for about 4 years now. I will never stop coming here. Amazing drinks, food, beer selection, and most off all the staff! Keep it up Casey's.
I stopped here for gas and lunch one day. The employees are very friendly, fast, and great with small talk and I had no issues with my sandwich, but I can understand the frustrations of the girl who found a hair in her sandwich.
Fish dish was decent but really salty.  Didn't like the taste of the broccoli. The green beans were very good.
Our waiter Jason was great however I was not a big fan of the hokey pokey dance the staff had to do.  It was a bit loud but it helped drown out the sound of the man behind me hacking up a lung. It was high energy and a nice change.
A bit dissappointing.  I have no idea how anybody would rate this place higher than a 3/5.  For those with a 5/5, what are you thinking?  All I can imagine is the place is paying you to post on yelp.
Rent affordable! Accepts dogs of all sizes and breeds. Staff is friendly. Quiet neighborhood.
We survived inspite of the stale food! Several items on the buffet were just plain stale. Not sure how these guys are in business.
$100 for an oil change. 45m wait. Is this for real. Not impressed. Super crappy waiting area.
Positive: fast and accurate service. Close to my office. \n\nNegative: Nothing ever tastes right. The fries are limp and the frosties have an odd taste and texture. The chili is served the wrong side of warm.
Super friendly staff! They made my out of town drop in feel like home. Huge studio that can fit up to 100 students
This is the worst Einstein ever. I go to my normal local Einstein and in comparison this place is like going to a 7 eleven. Never have coffee brewed and the employees ignore you when you come in.
I ordered a couple of items from this place and nothing was really that good.  The speed of the order and customer service was excellent, but the food was average at best.
fyi they moved to a new building about 300 feet down the road..Dont be fooled by the new building same old clowns working.
I like!  They have a good selection for us vegitarians, however the consistancy in the sauces is not head on.  They deliver on time and are very courteous.
Tall soy chai tasted like any other one that I have had at Starbucks. The BFs drip coffee did not taste like it had been there for a decade.... and they had a mug his mom wanted (she collects Starbucks mugs).
Perfect place for take-out.  The dining area isn't the fanciest, but the food is great.
Great prices and helpful staff. Free pool water tests and free advice to keep your pool crystal clear.
After getting ripped off by Leslies Pool for Pool supplies and repairs, I now go miles out of my way to shop at B & B for all my Pool needs.  They are HONEST and reasonably priced. All of their technicians are knowledgeable in Pool maintenance and  repair.
On the Go - Eat at Rubio's\n\nWant fresh food in a clean environment and excellent service with smiles? People on the go eat at Rubio's.
I have been to Tott's many times and I have tried almost all the dishes on the menu. KungPao and Angel Hair soup on the menu are amazing. Great for college students.
One of my favorite places for lunch. Similar in style to places like Pei Wei, but much better quality.\n\nMy favorite is the Chicken Pad Thai.
Honestly the food is not bad at all and very short wait time and portions are large but I always get it to go since it always stinks in there which is very unpleasant they need to remodel seats are torn walls are dingy
What a store! I've never actually been in a Fry's until the other day and they have EVERYTHING! Books, music, video games, washing machines, tvs, everything. It's like the Walmart version of Best Buy.
Bad attitude  never thought I would not go to a McDonald's  this one never go back. Always trying to up sell  please its fast food
Best donuts in South Phoenix. It is the one thing that makes working over there totally worth it. The maple bar is fantastic.
great pizza, pretty fast and good quality and freshness.\n\nThis place is affordable, you have your usual big screens, the breadsticks were fantastic.
I'm not a big yelper  but this place has gone so downhill is worth warning the masses.  I use to have faith in this place but no longer.   Horrible job,  long waits.  Go elsewhere
Wasn't impressed at all. For price I expect better quality. Chicago style Pizza was burnt and wings where not even crispy.
The windows and doors are boarded up. Apparently, it is closed!\n\nThere is no way to get any food. So, I would skip this one.
= = = = = =  CLOSED  = = = = = =\n\nSorry to see Him's JL close.  I liked the place.     :-(
Greg is so professional and knowledgable. I have older windows and tried to get estimates from other companies but no other company knew how to properly install blinds with my complicated windows Not only did Greg know what to do, he did it for a better price!
Love it here!!! Must try their hot & chunky salsa! But you have to ask for it ;) taco's rock!!!
This place and other local spots like the Teepee remind us of a far gone time when our Mexican food was predictable and when our standards were low.  But sometimes that hits the spot.  This place definitely has some history, just ask Marty Robbins.
This arena is fun! Outside area reminds me of downtown Disney with all the music, people and food. Inside is clean but they need to lower the AC a little bit during the hockey game. It was too cold even for my male family members.
Not a big fan but Tax free yeah!  Off base has more selection and you can find deals. Unless your buying a high price item i would shop elsewhere. The lines get bad so don't be in a rush.
Ordered the Sicilian special.  Worst I ever ate.  Majority of pizza was tomato soaked dough.  Something tasted stale on the toppings.  Disgusting!!!  This place was actually recommended. Lol what a joke!
Grease Paradise. You can smell the grease from two blocks away...
Horrible customer service. I have to wait 40 min. To return a charger that doesn't work.
Friendly service, great food  and always very clean....this is especially impressive since this DQ sits right across the street from a High School and a block from an Elementary School!
What's to be said?....   it's Walmart's version of \"big box retail\"...  I it's huge, clean and has friendly staff.
Fantastic course.  Don't play slow or they will get on you... but a beautiful course, good pro shop...
Great food, superb service, wonderful menu.  My go to place for an elegant date night ... as Yelp says \"Yay! I'm a fan.\"
Why do I do this to myself- we had visitors so we had to do Harolds, crappy food, spotty service\nBut FUN!
Been here many times and it's always the same. Slow, confused service. I only go back because other Cave Creek bars aren't much better. Now with Oregano's opening I don't see myself coming back to Harold's anytime soon.
Food was good, atmosphere is fun.  If you like country music you'll love this place.
Live bull riding night, bbq galore, indoor and outdoor bar. View of rodeo action can be crowded. At the front door an open barrel of salted peanuts in the shell. You can even toss the peanut shells on the floor.
Really enjoyed the atmosphere and the food was good but don't order a side of beans...not very good and weren't worth the money.  Wait staff was great and food came out quickly. Would definitely go back.
Terrible  we sat at the bar and never received service ,,,, bartender was rude and spoke only to the locals.\nNot worth free beer
This school has been an amazing part of my daughters development!!!! We thank Roy, Kathy and the rest of the staff of CCM for all that you have done for us and Alessandra! I would hands down recommend this school to anyone!
The flowers were beautiful - just as displayed on their website - and they were able to fulfill a same day request.
Awesome place to stop for a beer and a burger when out on the bike... I great conversation and service. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed.
The buffalo blue cheeseburger is delicious.\n\nSmells good had to stop\nCan't get enough of that blue cheese buffalo burger smells and\nTastes so good you got to try it.
Clean, great service, great smiles, and the cooks know when it's time to take it off the grill... Eating breakfast starting my Saturday with a great Denny's start thank you.
They were great and helpful.  We had our youth soccer shirts done here. They got the shirts to me on time and exactly how I wanted them to be. Very affordable and would definitely recommend them.
.....ya know, I should have known better! never settle for less cuz your in a hurry.
its a good place for  awesome fish fry all you can eay on friday nights.yummy, so if you are in the mood for fish drop by.
Nice place for homemade food. Large portions so you will not be hungry , and affordable for senior citizens too! My mom likes this place. Cod & ribs & prime rib & breakfast are pretty taste !
out of business.
Jim and his staff are top notch, honest, and reliable. If you don't take your car to them, you are just stupid.
Love this place. Its like a neighborhood bar, but all grown up. You can enjoy a nice delicious meal. The entertainment is always great. Make reservations, gets crowded during the summer months. Service is outstanding.
Great food and great prices...been a regular here for a few months.  Really nice it's 24hrs since I work nights.  And I always hit them up for the $5 for 5 mini tacos!
Friendly? Yes. Fast? Never. Billing is always messed up. Drugs are never ready when promised.  So frustrating to deal with. I would much rather deal with the other compounding pharmacy that doesn't make me waste so much of my time.
I found nothing wrong. Nice staff. Food was fine. No complients here :) mananger was super cool.!
We went for breakfast on a busy Saturday morning, about 9 am. Food was delivered fast and hot. Omelette was big as the plate. Homemade jam for toast and the cinnamon role was divine!!!! Service was excellent!
Absolutely horrendous service, pizza that is basically worse than frozen pizza. The waitress was 100 and we waited an hour and a half for them to forget our order. Ridiculous prices for the service and the terrible food!
Website pricing is cheaper than what you will get charged at this location. Attendant and cashier both agreed, but just shrugged it off. As for the actual wash, they do good job.
Excellent family owned atmosphere.
MONEY MONEY MONEY GIVE US MONEY\n\nThere's not even a single cross at this place. It's more like a casino for adults, the house always wins.
We spent our anniversary here.  It was a good place to do so.  Very quiet and nice, but not a lot happening.
Small, quiet casino - check. Clean, spaced out machines - check. Drink options followed by food - check. Low traffic = little smoke - checkity check!
Update. Im sick of coming here and having them tell me after a long wait in line that theyre out of whatever im looking for. Please. After a few times i get the picture.
Buffet is good. Theater has shows all day for $6
angry dealers, nasty tables, not worth the gas even when you live around the corner
Been eating here for years. Service and prices cannot be beat. I will continue eating here every chance I get until I leave Vegas.
$12 for a tiny Beef on Weck sandwich and fries... $11 for a pound of wings (that's about 7 wings)...$18.25 for a large cheese and pepperoni pizza... Overpriced bar food to say the least.
Perfect for the locals to avoid the hectic crowd and pricing of other theaters at the casinos.  No need to park at  a casino and pass through it to find the theater.
Just good food very cheap. The staff loves my son and we have been coming here since I moved to Henderson in 1996. Good local place to eat. We love Frank the drink guy!!
One of the best dive restaurants ever. The portions are generous and the quality is consistent.\nThe corned beef hash is amazing and the service is efficient & friendly. Great value and worth the visit.
Food was average but waitress was terrible! Asked what was on cajun salad...she didn't know and didn't offer to ask! She tantrumed when we asked for separate checks. She rolled her eyes when my friend asked to add a salad.
They have the best music band!!!
Came in super late for some munchies and to cure our sweet tooth. I got the bread pudding and my friend got the french toast. The food was solid, but the service was less than desirable. The bartender was more concerned with her phone and gossip than being personable to us.
Sit at the bar, Jordan is awesome, friendly and always positive.   What an awesome bartender!
You're greeted by the hot air and the sound of slot machines as soon as you step out of the airplane. You know that you're in Lost Wages!!! The shuttle system is quite good, and the shops are nice too. Checked baggage also arrives promptly.
I'd give it 3 starts if it weren't for the fact that you can walk around with booze and you can play slots.  Other than that this place is not very special.  I think I'm bitter because I took US Airways.  Never will I ride them again.
Plenty to do at McCarran. Tons of shops and places to eat.  There is even a 24 hour fitness. Slots everywhere, Wolfgang Puck has a place to eat here as well.
Great airport. Easy to navigate, good shops and decent food
It's a nice airport and has many places to eat. Security seems to get you in & out quickly.
It's Vegas baby how bad can it be?
Eh...could they make an airport any longer? This place is packed and hard to maneuver through, but its convenient location and only real option into Vegas makes it \"good enough\"
This place reminds me of Fear and Loathing...
Try the pretzel dogs. They are good.
Nascar weekend, 1 shuttle running from TSA to gates, no very smart.  Almost missed my flight.  Also on a time change day.  Your killing me.
The people that work here are rude! SFO definitely way better.
Won $14 playing the penny slots, oh yeeaaah...
Easy airport to get in & out of, & convenient stores & restrooms all along. It would be nice if WiFi was free.
Renovated and gorgeous. Plus arriving here is just the best feeling in the whole world. Just writing this review makes me ready to party
I imagine at least a solid 60% of people who are trying to catch morning or afternoon flights out of here are hung over. \n\nWho thought it was a good idea to make this the loudest, brightest airport in the country?
old airport, no wifi, no charging stations.
This airport should be better..
This place is all right. Check in was a breeze (maybe because I came at 4am!). Yes it's old and outdated, but there's free wi-fi, so that's a plus for me. :)
It was my first time in Vegas. The airport itself isn't as large as what I had expected it to be. Easy to walk and navigate through. Watching people still playing on the slot machines before boarding their flight was a hoot.
In line to get my CES badge for the show, the line went pretty fast !
Excellent service...clean..organized..nkt too many shops..but usually one is done shopping as theythey've vegas
it was pretty cheap to fly to las vegas. depending on how many days you book ahead, you can save considerable monies. southwest has easy checkins. a long list of departure times and they leave from oaktown!
Flying on this airline is so much worse than driving. Anywhere that the flight is under 2 hours I think I'd rather rent a car and drive.
It's a dirty location with a foul smell of piss inside. From my short visit it's apparent their main clientele are transient.
Good hearty Asian style breakfast, brunch, lunch. Chicken, good.. crispy and moist. Platters are huge. Saimin was excellent. Long lines, but worth the wait. Mahi Mahi was pretty fresh.
This place is a gem for a local food lover... The plate lunches are awesome and the won ton min is huge!  The hotel it's located in is a dive but this is worth visiting.
Pretty good place for local food at a reasonable price. Like the korean chicken plate.
Get like 20 spam masubis.
This place is soooo Ghetto! The only reason I came here was because this Cigar lounge was inside this casino which ended up being a bust as well. This casino looks so dilapidated, dirty and dingy.
I came for the signature tamales and left wishing I would have gone to el sombrero.  the food was shlockely prepared and lacked flavor.  it was also lukewarm.  service was equally thoughtless.
i love this place. i have been going here since before the moved it into the old church. the owners are nothing but sweethearts and the food is delicious and totally inexpensive. plus i just love the atmosphere.
Friendly and helpful staff. Clean and well kept spaces for the pets. Ive been a pet owner/ foster parent my entire life and this is one of the overall best shelters i have been too. Highly recommend finding the new addition to your family here :)
It's a bit on the cheesy side and could use some major remodeling but my 2 year old enjoyed it enough.
Perfect for a local band, and the cajun fries aren't bad either. If there is a neon reverb band playing there, or another local band..you can always count on a good dive bar experience!
Awesome place, especially when Tori is working. She rocks.
Nice selection, local hangout spot, poorly located. At least currently it requires a walk slightly out of the comfort zone for some. Worth it if you aren't too cautious though.
I will never use the greyhound again, it was awful. I was going from las Vegas to CA. The seats were uncomfortable, the tvs didn't work, the driver was rude and the employees werent helpful.
I was unsatisfied with all aspects of their customer service process. they did not explain things clearly. their policies are not meant to help you and i had a very unpleasant experience. save yourself the trouble and fly with rates so low. i would give zero stars if the option existed.
Maybe the Best Pizza in Vegas
By far the most greasiest pizza I've had in Vegas. Total disappointment.
Good place to grab a quick lunch, weather you're looking for a slice of pizza, sandwich, or pasta.  Be sure to check out their daily specials!
Oml this food tastes like crap!!!The waitress is so damn slow!!They should get someone faster!It is also in a really bad area!!The food is disgusting.Dont recommend it
I went back a second time and they have changed the way they make the Wellington.  It now only comes one way you cannot order it medium well or any other way.  Just thought it was funny after my initial review.  Still very good though!

Ok - I have a new favorite downtown!  REALLY great place.  Makes all the others pale in comparison.  Cool slide into a shark tank in the middle of the place.  And the breakfast was incredible.  Didn't really win any money gambling, but had a great time.
poor in room Quality, but Close in Atmosphere.  The Hotel seemed more personal, not too extreme.  staff is friendly.  The gift Shop sales Liquor and I won $500 one night and $1600 the next on the same machine.
I didn't stay at the hotel, only went to the buffet.\n\nAll I can say is, It's bad when the best part of the buffet is the beverage.
For downtown this was a great experience.  Free parking, nice friendly staff were everywhere for whatever question you had.   NIce pool and water slide too.
Great hangout nice Pool area!
Went back here for a few days, was in G10 penthouse, could not sleep tell 2 am , to loud outside, music blasting, bad room for sleeping,
2 weeks after being promised a credit for 1 night, still nothing!!!  Was on the phone over 45 minutes with no results....
Close to downtown if that is where you need to be.  Cheap room.  Terrible food from room service, raw steak full of grizzle.
We are frequent visitors to Las Vegas and stay exclusively at the GN; rooms are clean, staff friendly, great restaurants on property and location is perfect.
Smaller than expected and none of the cast members were there.
Just a regular old pawn shop. I think I expected to see one of the cast members there, which probably would've made it a 4 star experience. Still, it's something to do if you're in the area.
Don't know why they call this buffet world famous or award winning!!! It's just a regular buffet nothing special!!!
For the money, best buffet that I've been to in Las Vegas. There are better buffets, but you'll pay a lot more. The food here was good, and the area was also clean. I'd recommend this place over the much pricier places.
Very good informative tour! It's all outside in the Boneyard, so bring a hat, sunscreen, and sunglasses! Also probably better to do a morning tour during the summer.
Very fun! I would try to go at 6:30-7ish because not all the signs work so its best to have dusk type lighting. Buy your tickets online ahead of time it's only 20 people per tour.
They don't carry bagel chips anymore and everything in there is easy found in Hawaii.  If you're from the mainland and looking for treats from Hawaii, I'd recommend asking a friend to send it to you.
The buffet was ok for $11, but it was not worth the drive from the strip.  Definitely a spot for locals and not snobby tourists like me.
Good, clean, white-trash fun. I fit in quite well.
HORRIBLE BUFFET! TGIFridays is good as usual with a great staff.  The layout is great and there is no shortage on gambling options. Can't wait for the construction to be done.
This is my favorite boa location. Staff is helpful and friendly. It can get busy tho especially with all the retailers banking here. \nI don't mind it because after your done there is so many food places around that area!
Don't get the chi foot massage. They advertise pressure points and reflex. I spent $125 for someone to rub my feet. It was terrible. No skills. They need to change their description and their customer service. Very unsatisfactory.
This restaurant is terrible the taste of The foods are awful and they serve with lack of utensils and the worst is the drinks comes in a styro foam cup . I will never recommend this restaurant at all.
Tandy leather has all sorts of supplies and unique leather pieces for you to make your own bags, belts, anything leather. They also have iron stencils for burning into leather! Such a find!
It's ok. its a good price for what you get it's about the same price is Panda. it's definitely a hole in the wall
Expensive and not that good ..the food is kind of bland. Being Jamaican myself they could do so much better. Will not be going back unless it's for something they don't cook. I was not impressed at all.
You know you're in for a bad meal when you hear\n\" DING\" come from the kitchen. This is the most flavorless Jamaican food I have ever eaten. I will NOT return. Booooo!
Good tables.\n\nWeird brutish customers.\n\nIf you go in a group, you'll have a blast.  But if you're looking to come here to practice pool by yourself, I don't recommend it.
The ladies room has a vending machine with sexual practical jokes in it for $0.75 which are not worth the price.
Definitly enjoy the pad-thai, very delicious food.
Me and my friends call this our last stop before leaving Vegas. The orange chicken and Mongolian beef is my absolute favorites. Best hangover food other than stake and eggs.
The garlic chicken is awesome. And the pad Thai is about the best ever.  We checked out the reviews and was do happy we did.
Always good and great lunch specials.
dissapoint on pricing, food didnt satisfy the spot,.2.star.for friendly staff
I have been coming here for 6 years and have always had an amazing experience.  The bartenders are always friendly - and in the dinning room, Jen is an absolute amazing person to have serve you.   Also, way cheaper for quality drinks right next to the strip.
For a chain this (flamingo ave) Ruths chris is in my top ten of all times!\nOpen till 3am awesome wine great steak and service. I have been to four RC's and I think this is the best.
Sucks! Wanted to do baby registry. They tell me to do at kiosk. After create password. It said password not match. Asking for help. Nothing we can do at the store. You have to call the hotline!! Why I'm here for!?!
Been going here for over 20 years... The owner is always very friendly and classy   My clothes always come out smelling fresh and the price aint shabby either. Definitely worth checking out.
Dim sum food came out cold.. Service is poor.. No detail on check out bill..I will not come here at all ...
Love this place, good prices, good service and the food is awesome! Now let us dance......with swords!
I've always done take out here & the pizza has always been consistently good!!!
Decent 80s style pizza, but I prefer more of a kick to pizza sauce.
Loved the pizza, garlic nots and salad. The atmosphere could use a updo, but service was good. Price fair. Great marinara, and awesome thin crust pizza. Highly recommend.
Their 50% off for locals is a big rip off. They add on 18% gratuity on the full price of the meal and to top it off their food is not very good, it's mediocre Italian at best for their prices.
This was a fantastic experience.!    Eric Schultz was a great host.  The beef carpachio was excellent.   The service was as good as the food.   Family owned and operated.   We had a 6 course meal for two on our anniversary and the cost before tip was 140.
Went last night for a late dinner around 10pm. The service and ambiance were great. I loved the entertainment. The food was pretty good except for my lamb. I ordered it medium rare and it came out well done. It was the worst lamb I ever had.
They need so much help with their security system in the Bowling Alley.  We had some things stolen.  ....they also need to get that Friday's out of there.  Baaaad service.  Baaad
Buffet here is terrible on Friday night seafood buffet! Crab was so dry it wouldn't come out of the shell! And for $20 bucks per person, the Alliante Friday night seafood buffet is much more worth it!
Fun, safe day at the range. Customer service is outstanding, we came in to shot on the range. One of the staff members looked at our equipment and asked to check it out the next thing I know he's tuning us up. thanks guys
Great service every time. Just good old fashion dinner food. Large portions at good prices nothing more nothing less.
Was not impressed.  Server was rushed. Food was low budget.  Tasted like instant potatoes.  Waitress admitted the Green beans were canned.  Peas in chicken pot pie were canned as well.  Have had much better experience at their ST George location.
This is one of my favorite places for breakfast. The service is always friendly and attentive. Food comes out amazingly quick. I highly recommend their Bacon Benedict, and a stack of some of the best pancakes you'll ever have.
Lots of IMAX theaters here, Great popcorn, all the most current movies are always playing and it's removed from the strip (but only slightly) so there's not an issue with crowds.
Seats are very comfortable.
I've been charged twice with my account and they refused to give my money back, I had to make a claim against them. The place is not very bad, but the staff are rude, and as well as residence.
This hotel is off the strip and I think all the fun of Vegas is in the heart of the strips so if you are not there then it sucks. It's hard to get around like you have to pay for taxi and everything so I would recommend staying at another hotel in the strip!
First time at Rio - check in at 5 took 20 minutes - now at taxi everyone trying leave Rio - this place suck & will never stay again - I stay cuz of friends - not worth my time or money!!! Stay away if u under 35
The Rio is aging, somewhat gracefully. While it's not the best, it's not the worst. One thing I found odd, there is nowhere at the Rio that has a selection of craft draught beers.
Great, Authentic Mexican food.  Found this place on Yelp and it was great!  Home cooked food with home/family feeling.  Would have never stopped at this place just by looking at the outside.  Well worth it
This doctor was extremely rude and did not listen to my problems. He spent more time explaining that he doesn't prescribe narcotics than he did explaining what might be wrong with me. (Note: I never even mentioned medicine to him other than what I already take)
Love this gym. Everyone's so nice n helpful. No weird-o's stareing at you making you feel uncomfortable. Great equipment. Always go early in a.m. for best workouts
So I just cancelled my membership after 6 years or so, no hassle there which was good. Got a refund for the remaining time. \nIt is a nice place, but I started taking yoga, privately, so no need for the gym for now.
This place is open 24 hours and have an excellent fast food/pizza menu. Try out their philli cheese steak pizza. Chicken burger and chicken wings were decent too. Reasonably priced. If i had to choose i will stick to pizza though
Bad customer service. Cheaply made marble tabletops are dangerous and the manager will blame you for them breaking.  I won't be back here again.
Such a waste of money! I was very disappointed when I came here for my friend's birthday dinner. It is $27.00 per person for food that is not that good. I usually enjoy Asian buffets, but I was not thrilled with this one. I will not be back.
I typically use the drive-thru and can expect to wait about 5-10 minutes before I get my burger combo and go. The food has always been good and worth the wait.
great view, great service, food could of been way better and price was way to steep.. i felt like i was paying for the view
The view at the top the Palm hotel is amazing, the service was impeccable, but the food was average french fare artistically decorated.  No one is my party of 4 was wowed by this restaurant.
Excellent value, exceptional quality. Absolutely the best AYCE sushi in Las Vegas. We've tried the others, but nothing compares to S21!
$4 Value Slam gets 2 pancakes, 2 bacon, 2 eggs. Perfect balance. Good food A+ service. Keeps me away from cooking at home. Winning.
Terrible!!!!!! greens were burnt bad, had 3 or 4 fairway greens. never again will I go there.
I only go here to buy carne asada.  It's not as salty as Cardenas meat.  Fast in and out.  Buy some green onions for the grill too...
Best selection, cuts and QUALITY of meats in the city. The NY Strip and delmonaco are outrageous... Now THAT'S what a steak is supposed to taste like...!

Got ripped off on an in store pick up that I ordered online, received one action figure instead of a three pack, beware when ordering from toysrus.com and picking up at this location.
Ghetto! No wi-fi and room service stops at 2pm!! Seriously disappointed. Jacuzzi didn't work right. Furniture was falling apart. Very sad hotel.
I dont know why everyone bashes the excalibur. I recently stayed here and it was great. Everything was clean, nice flat screen tv, walk in shower. Got upgraded for free too. :)\n\nThe pool was off the hook!
A GREAT value for your money IF you get the rennovated rooms in tower 2.\nHowever, the casino and the buffet are pretty disappointing. My advice is to get your room here and expect to party elsewhere.
Don't get fooled by the low rates. Excessive charge on the internet, uncomfortable and torn beds.
small casino area but i did have better luck with the $5 min roulette table beats the hell out of aria $15 min bet. the buffet was good for its price wish they had more food options. free luggage storage great for an early check out an late flight out.
This is the cheapest place to stay on the strip, i dont consider circus circus or stratusphere the strip. It is alot of fun staying here.
Fun casino with lots to do for the whole family. The arcade is one of the largest I've seen on the strip with tons of affordable games and tournament of kings is an awesome show
Gets the job done, large rooms, good location.  On the other hand it is run down, a bit dirty and smells funny.
Nice facility. Dealing with the behind the scenes of exhibiting can be challenging, but what do you expect?
Large facility was part of the tradeshow for info comm. fits a lot of people and easy transportation
Dans cet amas de junk food, vous cherchez de la cuisine saine ? Vaguement europ\u00e9enne ?\n\nGo there !!!
Terrible service...  way overrated osso bucco.. gave 10 bucks off from my complaint and argued with me that it was one of the house favorites. . Taste like crap on my opinion
There's a good selection of frozen drink options here.  The 190 Octane was average, but the Bellini was disgusting.  It was super sweet and tasted waaaay too artificial.  The prices are very affordable and it's worth trying.  Next time, I'll get something else.
i have only tried the bagels and bagel sandwiches here and i go back weekly.  enough said :)
Way overpriced. Ironically, in a bad neighborhood. The price range is incorrect, it's NOT \"Under $10\". Under $10 you can get some tiny side but that's it.
The best calamari I have ever tasted in my life. The sangria is also amazing. It is a very nice environment but if you don't get there early then be prepared to wait up to an hour and a half for a seat.
Skyler the bartender was outstanding. Should be nominated bartender of the year!!!! Great drinks and service.
Great fun, & great food. Usually crowded so get there early. Our group tried 4 different entries, and they were all good.
Service was great. We had to wait for our table but they quickly took an order from us at the bar for appetizers and drinks. The menu had plenty of choices and the food was excellent! Great atmosphere!
First time staying at Harrahs and the rooms were decent. Only problem we had was the noise factor!! We were on the 15th floor and could hear the live band out front all night long in our room! It was very hard to sleep!! Casino and dealers were great!
Casino review.  Place is run down.  Slow to get drinks.  I like their Lake Tahoe hotel/casino location better.  Luckily place was too expensive to stay.
In line for check in at Harrahs with people lined up going out the door and only one person working at check in. Amazing. Seriously one elderly lady all by herself.
The hotel itself if fine.\n\nThe internet is horrible. Most pages won't load, if they do it takes 3-4 minutes.
I booked here with a very good deal from expedia and it was on the LV strip. That's why I chose there. It wasn't that bad but if it wasn't on the strip I would look for somewhere else.
Food was OK, but service was awesome! Our original group of 10 ballooned to a group of 20, and they didn't blink an eye and accommodated our group's last minute changes.
See my other Yelp under Forum Shops!\n\nBut DAMN - I love this store and the Forum Shops.  Wonderful experiences.
This is a decent Mexican restaurant with great staff and a relaxed environment. We had some wonderful beef enchiladas and a nice dining exerience.
This is a great way to avoid the 100+ degree temps. The shops are high end but bargains can be had if you look around. The restaurants are of good quality with none any better or worse than the other.
The food is made to order and tastes great.  It's a small place and based on the food alone, is probably busy all the time.
Everything is good. Tacos, Enchiladas, and Mole =)
3 stars for the revolving carousel bar.  \n\n\"Bazooko's Circus is what the whole hep world would be doing Saturday nights if the Nazis had won the war. This was the Sixth Reich. \"
worst hotel in vegas\n\nsuck ass!!!
Circus Circus has not changed much since 1995, except that the buffet is $15.95 now instead of $4.95 back then!  The decor is stuck in the 1980's and the rooms are, unfortunately worse, with wildly circus-themed decors.  Much better choices!
It's certainly a start and is convenient for getting around to some places, but it really ought to go all the way to the airport.  Also, considering the short distance of travel, $5 is quite a lot.
There was a salesgirl named Jen here and she was great! She was this little bubbly thing and helped me get into my size four birthday dress........thanks!!!!!!
This place is terrible. So bad we lied to get out of staying a second night. Light and air don't work. It's liken a renovated motel 6, so shitty
went beyond my expectations!!! food,ambiance and service was awesome. I highly recommend the firecracker shrimp and the grilled chicken with cilantro cremation. we will definitely be back.
This is good old school Italian. For $32 We got soup (delicious minestrone) or salad, garlic bread, very good veal parmigiana, a full liter of house wine and a delicious cappuccino for dessert. It was worth the cost.
If you don't have a reservation don't show up. They tell ya 45 mins and it turns into 2 hours. Not worth the wait when hunger.
Food was terrible. Completely flavorless. Sauce was watery. The free wine is not drinkable.
yummy...good portions lovely atmosphere!
A standard Godiva store, but who doesn't love delicious chocolate? These tantalizing treats will give you the pick me up that you undoubtedly need after day drinking and $hopping!
A great place to pick up your snack and beverage essentials for your room.  Don't forget to pick up bottles of waters so you can stay hydrated after a day of drinking!

Very helpful every time I visit.
we each got a salad and it was fine.  nothing too exciting but left quite satisfied.  the rolls were delicious and there were a few varieties so that was fun. i might eat here again if i'm in the shops area but won't be rushing back.
I  like this place. Good price, good value, taste is good and service is good.\nPretty romantic too....
Had a catered dinner here with 40 colleagues. Food was very good, service very good. Great location - even enjoyed a live string quartet playing in the \"courtyard\" outside the restaurant's entry.\n\nDefinitely would go again.
Place is nice. Food is good. Ordered the roasted half chicken. It was superb.  It had a crunchy skin and was well spiced. Bartender was a good wine selector. Service was well oriented. 4 stars due to a higher price.
Last night we came to Canaletto for my 30th birthday! All I have to say is delicious! Food was amazing, service was great, and the view of St. Marks square was nice too. All around great experience. We will definitely be back.
The employees spend too\nMuch time with there backs to the customers talking amongst themselves instead of focusing on providing better service!
Awesome property, bur the first night our room smelled like onions & ketchup.. Tonight it smells like fish sticks. We want to move but nothing is happening. Lame!
This place sucks. Be careful when making reservations you have to tell them you want the grill.  40 bucks for dragon roll...come on. 25 bucks for four pieces of sushi. Should have went to Mandalay Bay or Luxor for some fine seafood.
The food was good but I would like more for the price I paid. Service was not that great
These people are Scam artists. They quoted me 3 times the amount as everyone else and gave me a 4 week turn around. I took my car next store to metropolitan auto body and paint and they did it in two weeks and helped me with other damage with no extra charge.
Big crooks liars people Jim is the  biggest  thief .he charge for parts that not need to be fix or replacement .watch out people from this place .
This hotel is amazing.  Love it.  The only downside, its expensive if you're price conscious.  Besides the room, plan on spending $15 per drink at the pool bar, etc.  If pleasure ranks above money when booking your next Vegas trip, stay here.
Such a beautiful hotel & the fact that they're connected to Encore makes it super easy for you to get your clubbin' on! The view of their golf course is absolutely amazing. A huge patch of green in the middle of the dessert.
RIPP OFF !!! they charged for a soup and egg white $45.00 at the casino !!! That is insane. Their staff is rude and impulite!!\nI will never, but never ever, go there again.
Reasonable place located about a mile away from the strip!  Rooms are not bad either!  Wish the waiter service was better!
Was here for breakfast the other day. Food was good and the service was excellent and quick!\n\nFood: 4\nService: 5\n\nOverall: 4.5 rounds down
Pretty average. Would equate it to a Chili's or Red Robin. Service was 5 stars. And the local music they had going was 5 stars too. Drinks were a little steep... food was good, just not very unique.
I couldn't even detect the hops in what they assured me was the IPA. The rare sirloin was the rarest rose. The breakfast burrito was good. Service was quite friendly. Smoky atmosphere, of course.
Contacted by a marketing person from Ellis Island for more info about the incident. I responded...then never heard another word. Really think they do not care about customer service. Clearly enough people show up for the cheap food. Whatever...just sad.
No idea how this place gets such high ratings. Service is terrible, slow, uninformative, no follow up, not good.  Food was average.
This place is ... too great to be describe when you want good food and cheap price!!! I had all my breakfasts there when I was visiting LA because that was the first thing that came into my mind when I woke up!!!
Meh.\nPork chop with eggs was dry. Bread had a very salty butter. Buddies steak was good. Don't care to go back.
Gets the job done .had a Weiss and a light beer ... Got me buzzed and I think I've had enough ;)unpasteurized beer is good for you in moderation .
We use to come with all our friends for their steak special but we were really disappointed the last few times we came.  Never mind the service is slow, the food was not worth the wait.
Not a good service experience after the third time. They give preference to people who arrive after you and i would not reccomend going there. Terrible experience from the OWNER.
Gandhi is awesome. Please don't take my word for it, go try their fish tikka and fish pakora and I bet you you'll fall in love with it. This comes from a foodie who loves authentic fish!
Sure you get what you pay for.  It is probably the best value in Vegas -- if fanciness is not high on your priorities.  It feels like a family place.  Casino is fine.  Buffet is a little lame but we always go to the Peppermill anyway.
Never going back. Got to our room broken pieces of hard candy on the carpet and on the shower nob, hot cheeto on the side of the night stand.
You get what you pay for and the Riviera is no exception.  The Casino is definitely dated but doesn't feel as dingy as it could.  The rooms are comfortable and the pool is decent.  Worth leaving the property to find good food.  The walk to the strip is fairly quick too.
Being generous considering we found two bugs. The beds are comfy,  staff is a little pushy on hotel promotions, not the cleanest but not the dirtiest.
The girl Sarah at the Makeup Forever counter is fantastic!!! She knew what she was talking about and made my night!!! I looked fabulous! I am so coming back for every event. Love it
Naw, I went to this club at 10:31pm on a Saturday night and there were no strippers on the dance floor! I asked the bartender when they would come out and she was like, \"I think they could be getting dressed.\" All of them??
Best Pizza I've had so far in my 29 years of existence! lol.. it has moved over to MGM grand for those that don't know
I really enjoyed the burger joint. The sandwich was great and to be honest leaves you wanting more. I enjoyed my experience.
Worst experience!\nWe sat and ate here. The service was ok but their chicken sandwich was absolutely terrible. I'm not a fan of McDonalds but their dollar menu sandwich is probably better than this $7 something piece of tasteless food.\nNever going back.
3 words: Bigass Souvenir Shop
Its a cool place to visit.  Somethings are cool but i found a lot of things to be overpriced.
Nice to look at, but it's much more crowded and everything's more expensive than the NYC location.
Another store in the sea of souvenir and tourist trap stores on the strip. This place does have cute souvenirs though they seem overpriced. T-shirts and towels for $20 each is a little steep given the free advertising I would be doing for you.
Dollar corn dogs on tuesdays...Score!\n\nLocated conveniently in the Fashion Show mall. \n\nFunnel cake sticks are amazing and only  $2.75.
Partying all night in Vegas would not be complete without a night at Drais! Hot hot crowd. Coool people. Easy to get in. Not easy to leave.
Staff was very courteous, we were there for a private Super Bowl party. It was all catered and very nice although the game sucked ;)
Spazzing bartender started a shouting match with some friends of mine. If you like the smell of sewage over cigarette smoke, then this place is for you.
Not bad - great location - $1 margaritas (small but yummy); outback steakhouse & denny's is connected to the hotel.  It's a decent place to stay if you just need a place to crash for the night.
Yummmmmmmm  eeeeeeeee!  Taste eeeeeeee!
Place was not good. Food taste bland and it is way over priced for what you get. Orange chicken was nasty and so was the fried rice. Won't be coming back here.
After making this place my first stop in Vegas every year for 10 years this will be my last. Service and good was way off tonight. I could get better at a Panda Express
Had the most amazing dinner with my wife on her birthday!\nThe sirloin was the best I've ever had, and I recommend the cheesecake for a after dinner desert.
Best steak in Vegas!
Amazing prime rib was so tender. The green beans are a must. The only downside was the price. $125 for the surf n turf!
My ny strip was very tough! Thought my knife was dull, but it was not. Would not come back!
Terrible service and terrible drinks!! Will NEVER go back!! Total waste of $200!! Ugh!!
Surprise! i loved this place. Great chips, good drinks, music, dancing, the works. The food was great. the staff superb. Wish I found it earlier.
Loved the Happy Hour!  Their bartender Frank is super friendly and made us feel very comfortable.  Taquito appetizers were fresh and very delicious.  We came back every day of our stay.
Terrible service. The guy was very mean. I'm glad I am just a tourist. But don't go here. There are other great kosher places around town. Jerusalem grill has a friendlier staff.
This place USED to be the place but the owner has tripled his prices. I will be finding another repair place.
Quick and easy money exchange at great rates. Funny thing is, the ladies behind the counter have not traveled much. But they are making their kids travel (study abroad, live abroad, and so on).
Great transaction. Ladies are wonderful and gives you awesome advices.  Validated my parking stub too. Tip: we found place easily by reading other comments on here. Rates are awesome and worth the trip.
We walked in for happy hour... took a look around... smelled like a funeral home...\n\nWalked out....\n\nMaybe this place is good if you are retired....
My chicken parm was okay. But my mom ordered the salmon and that was amazing. My Aunts was also ok and why it only got 2 stars. I would expect for consistency especially with how prices all the food is. Having to track down your waiter is another reason for its low score
Conveniently located at the entrance of the Mirage, its a great location for grabbing a quick beer.   My only issue is the two fat tire beers cost 15 bucks...yikes!
Good lord, the Chinese food here is totally dumbed down American style because it tastes nothing like Chinese! I swear their Kon Pao Chicken pass off as dog. The only thing I dug was the atmosphere for it's supposed to be tip top classy.
From the apps to the desserts, I have not had a bad meal. Yes, you can find one in most major areas, but its good food. Why not hit the places you know are dishing out consistent meals?
Good food restaurant was way too hot!!
Chris, the shuttle driver is awesome. He made my day and is a reason I'd stay with Super 8!
Food was very good.  Had an oyster sampler plate with various types.  Salmon was cooked to perfection.  Overall a fine choice.
Avoid at all costs. Horrible service and horrible food.
Total loss, the bread was like wonder bread, the pasta was good but the sauce lacked any flavor and the price for the portion was minuscule. You shouldn't go away hungry from a 23 dollar Italian entree.
One of the best meals we ever had.  Can't rave about it enough. The VIP martini was awesome. Rochelle was our waitress and she was great. Must try this restaurant if you are in Vegas. Not cheap though so bring a full wallet.
We love this place when we come to Las Vegas.  Highly recommended for the steaks!
A must every time I go to Las Vegas!  Get the lemon cake.
If you like mediocre food, slow service (like really, really slow), and indifferent food servers, then this is the place for you.  Oh, did I mention they are also way over-priced?
Great stop waiting for a concert to start. Friendly staff, good drinks!
I ordered the crispy salmon dish on a blended pea sauce.  The blended pea sauce was actually refreshing.  The salmon on the other hand was nothing to rave about.
Horrible experience!! Service is slow and food is not properly cooked. I order fetuccini pasta with steak and they overcooked the meat and brought it cold. This restaurant does not provide fine dining, I do not recommend this restsurant to anyone.
I stayed there for 4 nights and was very comfy! there is a cute little kitchen and they leave you a basket with cheese,crackers,and fruit. beds were very comfy! will come back!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Awesome indian food and service.
Very good Hotel.. Food tasted really nice.. They have a $50 gift card for $40 that you may possibly use immediately if you bought this before seating. Also, they may give you 15% of if you are group of 5 or more..
Had a bad experience, you couldn't get a place to sit unless you spent $700 plus on bottle service. Had half the club roped of and empty. FYI it was $45 a person to get in we stayed 15 minutes, it was that much of a downer
Slight mishap with being given salmon when swordfish was ordered but quickly fixed, very pleasant server, everything was fresh, food delivered timely and at a non rushed pace. Overall another very good experience.
Great atmosphere, food was comparable to Chilli's or Applebees, very entertaining.
Come here if you want to spend $50+ per head on burnt, bitter steaks, soggy vegetables and weak sour drinks.
nightmare! the reservation line and hosts are not on the same page, we waited for an hour in line anyway for overpriced, average at best food and elephants that were heard but not scene and \"under construction\".
Not very good the atmosphere was ok. The food was ok. We had a lot of kids with us and they were not that impressed also. There are better choices in Vegas.
The food is really nothing special. The great thing about this restaurant is the ambience. This fish tanks are gorgeous and awesome .\n\nFOOD = nothing to brag about. Still a nice time though.
Definitely not coming back ever. Though the sushi was good but you can find much better places around town for cheaper. Their servers are pretty bad and not attentive enough.
All I have to say - hot waiter!\nOh, and the pizza was awesome too.\n:)
CPK in Vegas is the same in LA. The servers were very attentive and we never had an empty water glass. :D ENJOY!
Loved the Prime rib. Great potatoes and Salad and wine. Waiter was friendly. Atmosphere was really good. Will go back hungrier next time.
We went here to have dinner first night in Vegas and after waiting and watching them sit four different party's that came after us without we left. Just RUDE!!!
Rooms are nothing special \nGym is small\nFree Drinks and Breakfast is only reason to stay here
Much better gambling return than on the strip.
This is the place to stay. If you don't mind being just off the strip and are looking for a great place. It has it all
Very impressed with this hotel. First time here and I must say this place is incredible.
why go any where else? Food is the best on the strip, best executed,wine list rocks with interesting choices, and the view is well, the best in Vegas
Great view. The best creamy French onion soup I have ever had. Love the staff. Love the menu. Try the lamb burger it is to die for.
Great view but the food is average and the service is ok.  If you can just go for a drink and eat somewhere else.
Great food, incredible view, excellent service. What more could you ask for. We've done the prix fix many times and just ordering off the regular menu is great too. Can't go wrong for a special occasion dinner here.
Great view, food, and service. My GF and I went here to celebrate my return home from deployment. Wonderful experience!
Had 9:00 PM reservation...finally was seated at 10:30 PM. Food was mediocre at best. Dinner for 2... $500.00. Not worth the money. The view of the fountains was the only thing favorably memorable about this resturant.
MUST to avoid. Confusing system, indifferent service, sloooooow, bland food.
Great Starbucks coffee.  Enjoyed the worship team.    Pastor kept my attentions with his style.  Enjoyed the message.   Reminds me of other Mega church styles, including Elevation in Charlotte. Central, in Vegas and Saddleback Church, in Southern CA,
Food was good, waiter wasn't personable or friendly. Asked if I wanted a refill when I still had food on my plate, one glass minimum I guess on dr peppers?
My children love coming  for dinner here. Always great food and tasty desserts! I love their coconut shrimp - ymmy :-)
Great selection of flicks, but management refuses to hire enough staff to man ticket window. Got here 15 minutes before start and couldn't buy tix in time. Line for tix machine ultra long too. No respect for customers.
there's only one reason i come to Chili's and it's their to die for  Southwestern eggrolls.  delish!
I get the Chinese donuts. I don't know why they are so mind blowing but they are just amazing!!!!! I recommend trying them if you have a sweet tooth :)
Maybe the employees shouldn't use the main entrance as their smoking area. Was disgusting having to walk through the 2nd hand smoke of 5 employees right outside the main entrance. \nKosher deli is nice.
Reopening this friday
NOT NYC style pizza. More like the pizza I had to suffer with in Buffalo, NY. Thick crust. Garlic knots with hardly any garlic. Cannoli not good either. Don't go there looking for NY style pizza!
This cafe was so good. The raw pizzas and burgers were excellent.  They also have a large selection of fresh juices and shakes. The Cookies and Cream' shake was my favorite.  I strongly recommend this place for any raw food enthusiast in the Vegas area.
Not impressed. The clothing was geared toward women in their 50's or 60's- like the matching outfits and printed pants. The prices, even after the discount, was not much lower than department stores like Dillard's. I tried going back but I didn't find anything.
Probably the most terrible customer support I have ever encountered. after being berated by the office manager over the substance of my call I was then told in other words to go to hell. I will NEVER receive services here.
Never had a bad meal here. Love their Singapore noodles plus service is great
This iHop was ok. The food was alright, has small quantities and very expensive on breakfast items even though its dinner time. The staff was alright but slow.
I just called from Calif.to buy an anniversary gift for family in Summerlin and was put on hold by the manager listening to lame elevator music for way too long.  This is not good customer service.  Hope they're better in person.  I'm taking business elsewhere
If you are looking for a Young Israel, keep looking. This Kiruv centric,  Aish Shul is great for a weekend or two but don't move to this side of the city if you are Modern O or more observant, you'll get frustrated fast.
Great food. Great service. Monday's all you can eat crab legs for $25! and they have really great bbq.
This is one of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas. It has amazing food for the price. \n\nI am also weary writing this review because I don't want that many people to know about it.
The laziest service employees you will ever encounter.. They will thwart you right from the start, give you all the kinds of excuses not related to your car's complaint and problem just to reject the job..
Every Vegas local's favorite sandwich shop. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu, but the most popular sandwich is The Bobbie. It's Thanksgiving on a sub roll, and they do it perfectly at Capriotti's.
I have not met Dr. Miller.  I go there now because Dr. Canfiled retired from his practice and sold it to Dr. Miller.  The dental hygienist was the same and she does a fine job.
Adam is a great teacher, he keeps the kids engaged in the class and laughing. My daughter's skill level goes up every class. She lives to go and looks forward to it all week.
I was charged $130 for a $60 tire, $20 for $10 tire tape, and $20 to put the tire on the rim. Outrageous
Mediocre.  Too much quantity over quality. And whats with the HUGE beverage glasses. Waitress didn't know much about the food. Have to say tho', had a better experience at their location near Las Vegas airport.
This is the best Mediterranean restaurant I've been to. The koobideh was fantastic.
The curry is bland and so was the hummus.
Great service, love the Gyro and Athens Fries
Great food and fun classy atmosphere. I love the menu because there is something for everyone. Everything I've tried has been good but my favorite is rice pudding with Turkish coffee. And the hookah lounge is a great place to hang out with friends after dinner.
They don't do AYCE :( but prices are reasonable otherwise..since we pretty much ONLY do all you can eat, we won't be back. Picked up a few rolls to go and quality was okay, not the best.
The tilapia filet as well as the babaganoush and the loubieh are amazing! Fantastic service with great fresh food make this worth the drive off the strip!
Came to watch Hockey and have a couple drinks....no sound and was told they don't turn it up. It disturbs the gamers. Why bother having the TV's. won't be back
I just went in here looking for a leash for my dog and was so disgusted by how sad and sick the dogs they had looked I had to walk out...  Something needs to be done about this place!  All of those dogs should be rescued and they need to lose their license!
I always have great service here but they messed up my order and did not have it available at expectation date.
I e-mailed them my review to give them a chance to reprive themselves, annnnnndddd nothing.
Very lame portions at this location. It's almost as if they have a game going on how little they can put into bowl... Very disappointed! Totally killed my experience at this entire chain...
The smoothies are great, I ask for no sugar because they put a quarter cup in. sandwiches are taste but they microwave the chicken. sometimes they are under staffed and you have to wait a while so give yourself time.
This is the worst location I have tried. Nothing tastes the same as the other locations the staff are like drones not enthusiastic or happy at all.  I love tropical smoothies but will drive farther just to not go to this location
This course is as advertised. Great Fairways, Great Greens, and views are awesome.  My only gripe is there is no grass range. For the price they charge, there should at least be a full sized range. not a small one.
We had a party of 8 for a bachelor party Friday night. What a great time we all had. The service was extremely attentive and fun. The food was very good and everyone loved their margaritas. \n\nWould totally recommend this place.
Awesome!!!! Not your typical Mexican restaurant. Their brunch is out of this world. Gourmet steak and eggs gourmet oysters Rockefeller gourmet green fried tomatillos. Gourmet bananas Foster crapes! At eat myself sick.
Came here while hanging at the pool for a change from the greasy pool food they serve. It was pretty good, not too pricey, and chips and salsa were pretty decent.
Yuck!  Worst all you can eat sushi experience ever!  I recommend that you take your money and go elsewhere.
The best sushi in vegas hands down my girlfriend and i love this place
All you ca eat sushi,Good price in Las Vegas, Missing one star cause Service should be more improved. I ordered a cup of water, it never came until I called the waiter 3 times.
Terrible service. There was a reason why I didn't tip the server and before I left, she stopped me and asked me why I didnt pay tip. Seriously?\n\nOkay food. \n\nTry Blue Fin instead
Been going here for years all you can eat at the top of line sushi and are the chefs here fast the service is great
So dirty, super greasy menu. Dirty plates. Food was bad. Bad interior. Very bad overall experience. I'm just being honest.
Typical diner food. Not bad not good. Egg and I is a much better breakfast place. I had classic eggs Benedict and hash browns. Nothing really blew our socks off. Husband had turkey and dressing. Little on the dry side. Gravy was bland.
Great Ambiance, went strictly for the Hooka and the booze. Comfortable lounge and eclectic music. Waiters and waitresses were very friendly and knowledgeable. Great for small groups.
No stars would be more like it. Management is BAD BAD BAD !!\nWe will NEVER return. \nI don't care how good the food is, BAD PEOPLE !!
I love Paymon's. During the summer they have the best cold cucumber soup! So delicious. The chicken curry, hummus, dolmas, lentil soup are all satisfying... I think I am going to go there tomorrow for happy hour! Yay!
Great food! The food is really good but the hookahs suck!! We had to call the waiter over 15 times to fix our hookah and it was very unenjoyable. Maybe I would eat here in the future but I will never smoke here again.
What a crappy place, surrounded by crappy people to have to get a health card. CLOSED for lunch as we arrived... Are you kidding me? What a racket for unnecessary government fees....
The phone department is very knowledgeable. The geek squad department  is slow and doesnt have great  customer service. They give  you unrealistic time frames and have you  wait an extra 30 minutes while they chit chat between each other in the back
Horrible service. Horrible food. Don't waste your time or money!
Lame reservation policy- needs to be 4 hours ahead or you have to just show up. I think if you have the availability you should make the res. had a small party- now they lost the business- dumb
Excellent food but service was slow.  Sushi is good, no craft beer.  Martini made well.  Very pricey, but location it's the reason.
As always a good meal!
The store is always stinky. It smells like death and cinnamon. They are coupon friendly, so if you're used to being around dead people who loved to chew Big Red gum, please do shop here.
My first jack in the box. Great experience. Ordered at the keiosk amd got some freebirs
I use to have my boots repaired at Jova's but they increased their prices so much I stopped.  Does pretty good work but have out priced himself!\n\nThere are other Boot Repair places in Las Vegas that do just as good work at much lower prices.
Great service and food.  We had the 2-for-$25 special and loved it.
A clean, well-lit place to stay up all night and smoke meth with the townies. I'm dead serious.
This place is a great place to help your kids get started on just about instrument. I would recommend this studio for any budding music learners!
I understand some people aren't happy with FirstService Residential however,  there is a rental department that is separate. FirstService Residential itself does not handle rentals.
One of the most unprofessional companies to deal with. The HOA due was cashed, yet they mailed my mother in law a missed payment letter. Now she has to provide proof that they cashed the check.
Great service and great prices if you have one of the fuel programs they accept and they will waive handling fees with purchase.
this place looks cool, but its now closed. Sadness i never got to experience it
You would have to be white or be with a white person to get good service around here.  I felt a racial tension when I was here last.
Excellent green curry and everything else was tasty. Portions are small... Location is so central and easy to find. Don't be scared by the strip mall appearance.
Food was good but nothing out of the ordinary.  A little greasy.  Would not make a point of coming back
Wolfgang Struck out on this one.  7 member squad and nobody liked it.  Very bland, very boring.  We're all from NJ & NY so maybe that's why??  Wouldn't spend another dollar there again.
Nice people inside, basically just a normal gas station/mart. Only thing thats lame is thats its on a corner so its more difficult to get out of with traffic! Loves it though!!
Food is great as is the service.  The restaurant is large so there is usually no wait.  This is a great family spot.  Give it a try.
Great Place to Eat.. Native New Yorker and I thought I was home with Mom.. Puerto Rican and Cuban food very similar.. Highly Recommend. .
Food was okay, but expected better.  We were the last customers in on a weekday and we finished before closing time, but we felt rushed.  Overall experience wasn't very pleasant.
Filthy store, terrible selection, only two checkout lines open.  Absolutely the worst grocery I've ever walked into.  The store needs to be demolished and rebuilt -- with new employees.  Better selection and prices at a drugstore or a convenience store.
The work they do is great, their prices are affordable. But this place is never open when they say they are.
I have been with sprint for 10 plus years..I have never had a 4G phone with fast service.. I use to pay for it each month.. They have been saying the same shit for 5 years the towers are not up yet.. Don't buy it.
Worst service ever!!!!\nThis office doesn't answer phone calls. They were supposed to pick us up from the hotel and never showed up. This office should be closed!
Quick & Delicious Lunch with a great salad bar!
Great food, decent service at not a bad price. I will go there again and again. In fact we ate ther everyday except one day while we stayed at vegas for 4 days. Will go back again.
I only like this place because I am Indian and they serve good authentic Indian food.  Haha.
Great place to sit down and enjoy great quality food. New Menu and great selections are now available. Was not too impressed with the service this time. Usually pretty good yet today was rather disappointed.
First time there, went to the lunch buffet with a couple of friends and it was amazing.\nTons of vegetarian options. Love it!
Compare to others in this area it has good buffet...I would say next to saffron this is good..
Portuguese omelette is good. Go for it!
I hardly ever go to this location and today I went there with friends. It was empty, overpriced and the beef on the rice was cold. Very disappointing. The one on Decatur is on their game though! :)
I'm Very pleased to see they've closed.  I dealt with them once.  The owner was a rude jerk.
I am a big fan of this place.  Always have been.  \n\nToday they had a demo day, and the guy doing it helped a buddy of mine with some impromptu golf lessons.
fun little course. great practice spot. cheap too. if you dont mind the noise from the planes, you will enjoy it here
Celebrated our wedding anniversary here last night and had a delicious meal. Steaks were tender and juicy.  Service was outstanding.  Thank you for making our meal one to remember!
Wow; what a great Italian place off the strip!  Fantastic food, great entertainment; very fun! The bread and cannoli's are to die for. You must check this place out!
This place is fantastic! Old Vegas lives on. Food is incredible!
Went there on superbowl weekend..loved it definitely a regular place to visit when I go to vegas again. And the free limo ride was a huge brownie point winner.
This place is totally Vegas. Food is wonderful. The atmosphere is old Vegas. The complimentary limo is a bonus. We frequent this joint every time we get a chance when visiting Vegas which is often. There's always a lounge singer which feels oh so Vegas.
Short wait.  Television available in news or sport channel. Bring reading material or tablet to pass the time. Mammography technicians were good. Office personnel really nice but a little disorganized. They really try to accommodate patients in.
great food, great ambiance but a little pricey
Descent hole in the wall local's bar.
Although when I did go it was busy making me wait a long time , I think this place has wonderful employees. Customer service is great. Although some people have very lil patience , the guys don't let any of that get to them .
Its 7-11 what to say? The Staff is funny and they joke around and make your wait not as bad when there is a lone.
Great food and great service. The chicken enchiladas suiza was delicious!
Appears to be out of business, no web site, phone disconnected and nobody there!
You have got to be kidding me?! Old stylists, even older clients nothing new or innovative. I guess this is where old stylists go to die!
Great atmosphere,prices are good,great service and food quality awesome ! Don't  forget to order the Margaritas with fresh squeeze lemon!  \"Outstanding\"The server Carlos was great!!
The restaurant was full of Mexican customers! Need I say more
The place smells wonderful.  The selection runs to mostly white flour breads and a few sweet items.  The bagels are decent--not water bagels, but there doesn't seem to be anywhere in Vegas that makes REAL bagels.
It's a pool supply store.   I usually don't go to these places, but I was trying to get a solar blanket for my pool....I had all the blue prints, but still not enough info!  Really!   Dammmm it, I have to go back again!
First timer here and I can't believe I actually paid $20 for a one day pass. Not even a free trial. Gym was super packed and machines were a good wait. Other than that, they've got every machine. This gym is OKAY.
Dirty all over the food area \nI don't know if even have health  card \nNeed in Nevada to work with food \nTaco stands are cleaner than that place .
The lady was so nice! The food is a bit Americanized but still very delicious. The spicy noodle on Korean menu was especially good.
I've been here twice in the past month, around 7ish. The drive thru takes at least 10 minutes! Horrible drive thru!!!!
Good location but please do something about all the day laborers standing outside. They line up the street!
Went twice in the last two days. We ate at the bar the first time around 4p. Chicken wings were amazing! Fries good too. Came again for breakfast on Sunday around 1030a service was horrible but food was good.
Love the wings at this place they are cooked in the pizza oven . Super crispy .love their breakfast specials For lunch get the get the taco basket !! Service is always good . Food portions are great . Friendly wait staff and bartenders
Love my gym!!! Working out!!!
Was here today the food the service was great left feeling full and complete a lot of bang for your buck
Everything you need for crafts, but be prepared for a 30 minute wait to check out...
Waited for five minutes for someone to acknowledge me. Go to Target on Blue Diamond, much more helpful!
I have been taking my two babies here for years, best docs, best staff, wouldn't trust anyone else!
Got a groupon for the ultimate wash for $5. I liked that they scrubbed the car before it went in & thoroughly dried it after. I will go back again...
Best all you can eat around!
The best AYCE sushi in town. Service, food, ambience, everything. You won't find another AYCE sushi as good as this.
Great drink prices and nice staff in the bar, but sooooo smoky that I could only stay for one drink.
Awsome
We believe the Italian food is the best here. Southern Italian is simple with just the right spices. The problem with other Southern Italian restaurants is they try to make it fancy and it don't work. This place is an authentic traditional Southern Italian Restaurant with great pastas, meatballs, and sauce.
Awful does not begin to describe this clip joint.  Awful service and the food was about on par with a Dennys.  Somehow this place has managed to stay in business. I'll never be back again.  If you want good Italian in Vegas skip this place.
I had anticipated this visit for months so there was a lot to live up to and I have to say bootleggers went above and beyond my greatest expectations. The complimentary bread is so sinfully delicious and the bolognese is comparable even to my immigrant Italian family's recipe!!
I told myself a few years ago I wouldn't go back. I gave you one more shot. Never again! \nMeatball sandwich had two, two meatballs cut in half to make a sandwich. Cheap Fu*cks! All for $8.0.
This is the pizza place we have been looking for! Great service! Great food! They have a full menu of options. Small dining area makes me feel like im back in my hometown:)
Not bad for if you're looking for some quick take out. Nothing good or bad to say. Just your standard strip mall take out place.
A-Ok in my book. Nike SB's are getting harder to find (at least in Nike Outlet stores) but this Factory Store had one so I just had to get it. My current SB is dilapidated so I needed a new one.
Brought my truck in for squeaking brakes. Tech Craig came an got me. Pads are still 95%. He said these will last long time.  No service needed.  Mary at the desk is super friendly.  Fast an honest service.  Just made a new customer. Thumbs up
These people have no idea what to sell you. They just point to the startup boxes when I could have saved money buying better items separately. No knowledge on reptile health. Also sold me a turtle with one eye. Really?
This place is terrible. The waiters are on their cell phones most of the time. Management allows other patrons to scream, yell and cuss at the television as well as other patrons, all while banging on tables and the bar.
The staff here makes the place great! Every time I come here the employees are prompt, polite and really friendly. \n\nAnd the KFC bowl is heaven in a dish.
It seems like every time visit this location they never seems to have what I need. Also some plants don't look so healthy. I go to the other location which is far. sigh
Nice people but WAY too loud for a neighborhood bar.
The Midori Margaritas are amazing! We had the carne asada tacos. They were cooked to perfection!
Every time I shop here for pool repair parts, I get the wrong part. The chemicals (chlorine, muriatic acid, etc.) are not good quality and the place is operated by amatuers/kids.
Just had some of their tres leches cake last night...very good!
I guess I'm not eating here today! Apparently it's a cash only day =(  feel like they could post a sign on the door or tell you as part of the greeting.
This Target is a great Target. It is always stock and clean. The employees are always nice and it is fun to walk around for a little while when it starts to get hot. Totally am in love with Target.
Possibly the best selection of products when it comes to a Best Buy.  Unfortunately, nothing can make up for employees who say one thing and do another.
Great staff and they never mess my hair up, perfect everytime, they so send out great coupons for an awesome cheap cut
Dishonest thieves!!! Stay away
SCAM!  They put synthetic oil in my car when it doesn't need it (confirmed with the dealer) and charged me over $70 for the oil change.\n\nAVOID THIS PLACE for their unethical business practices.
Since UPS took over Mailboxes etc that leaves Postnet for Fedex.  I had a manufacturer return package with tag ready to go and just dashed in, dropped it off, greeted by friendly staff and dashed out.  Simple and easy.
People are helpfully but poised off that the financing lady just her deck and left me there for more there 20 minutes.
I ask to see \"deep couches, ornate wood, dark fabrics\" I'm shown blue couches and I literally just walked away from the sales associate. Huge selection of lame styles.
Used to be better. Beef chow fun had hardly any beef in it. Walnut shrimp over cooked. Chicken Tsao over cooked too much fatty chicken. Yuck!
The worst company EVER!  Didn't even show up.  Booked on Tuesday for a Saturday cleaning and waited around for hours but NOTHING!  When I tried to call the office the number was disconnected.  So disappointing.  So unprofessional.
You all have to be kidding me! I am in town for business, went by all of your reviews and when I walked in, it was nothing but disappointment.  A very very small collection of books in the entire store. Geesh.  They need some stock. So many empty shelves.
Very slow service.  Been here 30+ minutes and my car still hasn't come thru the wash part yet.  No one seems to know why things are taking so long.
Worht seeking out for sure.\nEggs benedicts if really good.\nService is fast and friendy.\nMake the drive from the stip you wont be sorry.
Great food and service! Place is small but comfortable. As soon as we sat down we had someone come to us for drinks. I will definitely go back to try some of the other menu choices.
Coffee and pot of bread great....service is bad!!! Breakfast took 2 hours!!  Food was just ok. Had to ask for to go box twice and then it was thrown on table! Our bus person Jose was the nicest person there! Probably won't go back.
we are here and loving it.  great food and friendly service.  the top breakfsst restaurant on my list.
Easy to make appointments on line or calling in, no long waits for an appointment.  Appointments begin on time.  Dr Steed and staff - knowledgeable with great customer service.  Contacts and glasses come in within days of order.
Great customer service.  Always get you in and out as quickly as possible.   Employees are on top of issues and polite.
Never had a problem with this DQ. Great blizzards. Food took a little while but that's common when you order the chicken strips. Service is always prompt and pleasant.
Dawn is the best.
THIS PLACE IS A COCKROACH HAVEN!!  If you love having cockroaches in your bathroom, garage, front yard, kitchen and even at the pool live here!! This place should be condemned!!!!!
It was ok. The pineapple chicken fried rice was so gross.. The food wasn't hot and not the most flavorful. I wouldn't suggest this place.
I won't speak for the whole company, but I will tell this branch is undertrained very unfriendly and makes no apologies for it.
one word. racist.
Service sucks. They are always messing up orders and are rude to customers. One of their workers was just yelling at a kid for bringing in his skateboard and told him to have consideration. So rude and unprofessional.
Will never go back I have see 2 roaches near the sushi bar and one crawling near my plate!! Great staff. Needs to fix the bug problem!!!
Only place in Vegas that has AYCE sashimi! The restaurant itself looks outdated and old but I honestly just care for the sashimi, oysters and soft shell crab! Service can be improved upon but overall good.
Patience is required as they take their sweet time and it isn't even busy. It's been 30 minutes and I don't know that they'll be done soon. I would come back because it's cheap but definitely not during 'rush' hour.
Worst service I've ever had in my life! Horrible and unprofessional. Don't bother here!!
Very Poor Customer Service :(
Super slow service, mediocre to poor food..I'd check out other IHOP's in the area....not worth your time.
Pretty darn good chicken sandwich, french fries were above average. Chicken wrap for take out was so-so, but I'll definitely be back since its so darn convenient
Mediocre pizza.
Always friendly :) easy access on and off the highway which is great for the work commute!
Regarding their Custom Framing.  I can't believe it took them 2 full weeks to finish framing my picture.  Either they have alot of work or they work slowly.
I hate the pharmacy it's always slow at this one.
Competition for nv energy is coming in 2015 for information contact me  I can't wait to switch #deregulation of energy
Way too expensive for the type of food they serve. Even the domestic micros are at least a dollar more expensive per pint than just about anywhere else in Pittsburgh. Do yourself a favor and take your dollars elsewhere where they will go much farther.
silver clouds...amazing. \n\nsmall, intimate museum....but amazing.\n\nshows held in lobby....amazing.\n\na sure stop if youre in pittsburgh.
GREAT museum.  Loved it.  I usually spend a short time in museums, but the Warhol museum had my attention for houes.  Beautifully done, and I love that visitors can touch and interact with many of the exhibits.
Terrible service.  Rude staff.  Horrible waitress.  Don't waste your time or money.  Plenty of better restaurants to select. Will never go back
Really really great service.  Diverse menu.  Apps are excellent especially the calamari  which features some interesting use of lime.  Nice atmosphere.
Nice selection of items, good pricing and friendly atmosphere. We'll be back.
I find the decor very odd and the menu limited. The infamous burger I was supposed to order (I forget the variety) disappointed me as it was very dry and overcooked. The oft-mentioned fries were also underwhelming.
This is a fun staple in Pittsburgh where the locals and university students alike come to dine. $10 bottles of wine is an attraction as is the fried fish sandwiches. They have delicious fish sandwiches!
Good food and big portions! I usually get their burger, which is very filling. It has a nice, casual atmosphere.
Pork chops, curry soup, are tasty \n\nLo Mai Gai is good but has no lap cheung\n\nDofu pi juan is vegetarian
Price is reasonable, service is good, food average. I eat at alot of Thai restaurants but this Pud Thai is drenched in a soup like very sweet sauce that doesn't resemble the flavor or texture of authentic Pud Thai. Otherwise everything else is average.
I like this place, they have good food. I go there a lot since its so close to my job. Their service could be better, but overall is a good experience.
Not great but good.
my favorite place in madison to see a band. Good sound, not too big, and friendly staff...
Good but not the real deal.  The big 3 pizza deep dish places in Chicago I feel are better.
it's the best pizza I've ever eaten. Yes, it's a bit pricey, long waits, blah blah blah. Don't care. I love you.
Place makes legit deep dish pizza. No one does it better in champaign. Only place to go for piazza like this down south. Lunch special legs you get their piazza slice for like three bucks. Great deal for a hungry college kid
Great martinis and cocktails in general.\nThe bartenders are also sup[er sweet, so be nice to them.
I liked the pizza\nbut not enough for the wait times.\n\nI mean, really.\n\nI'd rather just go to Peter Piper, order a pizza and play some skeeball instead.
Best pizza I've had anywhere.  Perfect, perfect and I mean perfect crust.  Thin, chewy, smoky and sweet.  Lots of interesting toppings that center around fresh, local produce.  I deeply envy the regulars here.
So looks like someone at that craphole called Bianco's can't handle criticism and is send private messages. Further proof place is bogus
Pizzeria Butana\n\nWhere they treat their customers like dogs!
Il Forno ... much MUCH better!
great guy...  and great pizza..  good experience all around.
Overrated.  While the food here is good; it's not worth the long wait.
This is a good pizza place, but not up to all the hype. If you want a great pie, then take a trip to LA and visit Monzza.  Monzza makes the best pizza in all the land.
Service: 5/5 Friendly and accommodating\n\nFood: 5/5 outstanding, outstanding, outstanding pizza
I guess I don't understand the hype. The service was very good, but the pizza was completely flavorless. The sauce was the strongest point, but the cheese and sausage were completely bland. The service earned them a third star, but I won't be going back
I feel that this place is very overrated.  The wait is ridiculous if you try going for dinner and I think the food is so-so.  I would prefer to go to Cibo over Pizzeria Bianco.
Best pizza in America?  It was good but definitely not the best.  Worth trying if there is no wait.
A Wonderful Experience!  Truly great food served by Outstanding Wait-staff.  Really worth saving up for.
great service and food.  awsome place to bring out-of-town friends.  martinis and bar staff are professional and knowledgeable!  best martinis in town.
Food is 4/5 no complaints, great menu.\n\nService can be a little slow, little rowdy environment at times (crowded, etc, dark, small bathroom). \n\nDeserts are best I've seen or had at a steak house.
Great food, great service, great atmostphere. What more can you ask? Equally good for a romantic dinner or a business meal.
Great food. Who cares what it looks like outside. Fish tacos were amazing. Check this place out if you want authentic Mexican.
Basically my favorite \"creative\" Mexican food spot. Hands down, best guacamole in town. Get it with everything in it - including the pomegranate seeds. The low rider margarita is awesome. Also, their signature pork dish is pretty tasty.
Not even worth it.. $130 for a family of 4. This is the PF Chiang's or worse of Mexican Food.. $5 horchata and $10 Churros? Comedor dela Guadalajara is still the bomb...
Awesome!!  Great food! Great vibe! Great service!\nI highly recommend happy hour for $1.50 mini tacos.  They were all great, especially the shrimp and halibut.
The best guacamole! Everything fresh. We were a party of 4 and all my French guest enjoyed their meal. Perfect service and reasonable pricing for the quality of food served. Thank you !
Great Guacamole; pricey but very fresh with a different texture and unique mix of ingredients.  Fish tacos fresh and not heavily battered. Pork tacos were also very good. Side salad also very good.  Friendly service.
from the music to the coffee to the furniture this place gets it, or at least gets it for me. i havent had a bad coffee there yet. the brownies are super rediculous good. the music is loud and not on the radio.
This place is one of the best Coffeebars in Phoenix. But if you can't get your flip'n internet to work any better, I'll continue to look.
My wife goes here ever chance she get, but I refuse to go with her. Coffee deserves 5 stars but the chick behind the counter is so rude. I refuse to spend money at a place that lets it indie hipster staff treat regular Joe's like my self rudely.
Everything here is tasty.  They can be crowded, so expect that!  Wish they were open later when my friends want to go boozing and I want an espresso!
Aaaaahhhhhhhh! I walked into this place happy, and instantly turned into hipster emo girl. what is going on? The music is really sad and there are a lot of flies around. Get me outta here. The coffee and treats are always good though.
this has got to be the best, most amazing little  coffee place i've ever experienced  besides cafe trieste in san francisco!! wish we had this in boston...
Lux feels trendier than I'd prefer BUT their Mac-n-Cheese is to die for.  Go get some!  You won't regret it.
Don't shop here.  sych!
To sum it up: I sat down where President Bush sat. The food was as awful as his tenure as president. Loved the ambiance though.
Excellent Mexican food, clean and decent prices for the amount of food.  Will definitely be returning.
Yummy Mexican food, but the atmosphere feels like a chain. Still worth it for the chips and salsa. This one is really close to Scottsdale Fashion Square mall.
Great food always. Service slow tonight, but will always come back as we love this place!
Food was decent but the waitstaff absolutely sucks.  Super rude and condescending.  Not worth the time or money.  Stay away.
We went here based on a random recommendation. The chips and salsa were very good. The food is quite hot.
The customer service is horrible which is too bad because the food is great. But button-line is I just can't ever go back, customer service is key to enjoying a meal.
The salsa is excellent and hot. Last time was better. The chimichanga was over done. I'll go back to the taco next time
Great spicy NM food!
Amazing customer service.  I got the teriyaki chicken w/rice lunch special.  They had it ready for me to pickup in 15 minutes.  It was great and high quality.  I'll definitely be returning.
So..this place is cute!  Huge dance floor!  The whole place is huge! Geesh~  Fun decor and nice bartenders.  The guys there seem pretty lame though.  Cool place to get dressed up and dance.
Don't bother with this location. They don't carry hardly any inventory. Online it will say this location has something in stock-it doesn't!
We spent New Years Eve here! Great atmosphere, excellent food and friendly staff!
The macadamia but encrusted goat cheese is to die for!! Salads as well \n\nLeap of faith drink is amazing!! As was our server Brandon!
Just called for reservations was told to call back they were busy. Wow really that's how you treat customers? Thank goodness there are soo many other great options -restaurants who understand what good customer service is
We had NYE dinner with friends and the food was great! The atmosphere reminded us of Hawaii. The coconut shrimp was the best I've ever had and the filet was perfection. Just be sure to save room for dessert!
It was good, but a bit expensive when there's so many places around town offering the same thing.
It's not fancy Asian food. But it taste great. I compare other Thai / Asian food to this place. Never had a bad experience or incorrect order.
Cheap. Totally get what you pay for. Buffet was your standard cheap buffet. And it's definitely in the ghetto.
The crispy rice salad with chinese sausage, mint and lime is by far the best thing I have ever tasted.  I always order 2 portions.  If you HAVE to go to Vegas, (God forbid) you should check it out.
I came here with a large party and the service was on point!  They were very attentive, the food took a while but the restaurant was busy.   The food was very savorful and authentic.  Try it out!
Excellent fresh Thai food.  Do not let the looks of the outside of this place fool you.
This white boy likes the duck soup.
Take the time to enjoy this little treasure. The food was amazing. We began conversing with both tables next to us and sharing each other's dishes. The experience was one of my favorite times while in Vegas.
I double checked to make sure we went to the right restaurant. I would rate the food as edible but not good. Very disappointing after reading all of the reviews. Wasted money on the cab ride in addition to the bill.
Yummy!!! They offer many authentic Thai dishes not offered elsewhere. They offer a big selection of alcohol as well. The portion is a bit small for the price but the taste makes up for it! Do make a reservation! I really liked the Hor Mok with Seabass.
Have had better hibachi for less of a price. It's ok... Prob wouldn't go again maybe only if I wanted a quick snack of a couple sushi rolls.
This used to be a much cooler club. However, for some reason they changed the name and the decor... not bad now but I miss the old one.
Vodka flights.  Caviar flights.  Both awesome.  Try the German caviar!  If you want to go extra fancy, they have an ice room!  Did I mention the Vodka from all over?
I really liked this bar. It had a cool atmosphere and good drinks.\n\nI don't exactly remember what I had but I remember it being some kind of pineapple mojito with absinthe in it. It was sooooo yummy!
It was awesome, service is what you expected from this type of restaurant.\n\nThe atmosphere was very differant and fun.\n\nI hope they are around for a long time to come.
We were very excited to go to Jasmine after reading the reviews.  Big disappointment.  Overly salty, nearing inedible. Rude waiter.  Short and impatient with my wife, our order, overall experience. Will not be back.  Better service and treatment at restaurants half the price.
Mediocre in every way.  Service and food.  Overreliance on salt in the remoulade was a disappointment from this name.  The whole place looked tired and past prime.
Terrificly delicious food.  Good service.  Very enjoyable atmosphere for a dinner with friends.  A terrific meal.  I read some negative reviews before going, but I found everything to be very good and am glad we chose to go there.
I had the Hubert Keller burger and it was gooooooooood. And the hazelnut milkshake. Yuuuuuuuuuum. That is all.
The beers are good.  Avoid the Veggie Burger, it is mushy and bland.
Food was great but the service was awful. We never even got refills on our drinks when we asked numerous times. Burger was the best part of the experience.
Not bad, not great. Hamburgers are good, same level of quality at a lot of bars across America.
Horrible burger. Pale color, no flavor, pretty bun but very greasy. Fries were delicious, fresh and hot. Service was ok. For a place called burger anything you'd expect good burgers. This isn't it.
Excellent food!! I had the salmon and it was perfect.  I can tell why Bobby Flay is famous. I will be back for more on my next trip to Vegas.
Hands down favorite restaurant on the strip.  Been here multiple times and it keeps exceeding my taste buds and expectations each and every time.  Try the filet, a bit of a kick!
Maybe my expectations were too high - but food was very disappointing.  It was ok - nothing spectacular or noteworthy.  Therefore it was definitely overpriced.  Wait staff was great though.
The food was pretty descent for the most part. My biggest issue was that they used really bony scrappy cuts of meat for the lamb tenderloin and thought it was ok.
The Coffee Rubbed Filet Mignon, served with a mushroom-ancho chile sauce, was heaven. Need I say more?
The service was exceptional...like nothing I've ever experienced.  Unfortunately, I can't say the same for the food which was borderline inedible.  I honestly don't think that I would ever go back (even if I were offered a free meal).
Make sure you're ready to eat if you come here. The proportions are ginormous and will definitely leave you with a food coma. The fries that come with the sandwiches are also great.
I stop by about ounce a month with my wife it's out the way for me but well worth it the bay of pigs rocks a must go.
Beers are good as were the wings, but the burgers were a BIG disappointment. Flavorless and uninteresting.  Portions were way too big--bordering on ridiculous.  Service was good.  Would go back for a beer and appetizer but that is it
Great little find on Atwood Street. The shrimp & corn fritters were super fish. The Pad Thai was very tasty and the Malaysian meat quartet covered all the bases.
The food here is very fresh and very thai.  I really enjoyed the red curry with chicken -you need to try!  Ive eaten Thai at other places in Pittsburgh (and there are really no good asian restaurants in pittsburgh anyway), and this is THE place for Thai.
I was visiting Carnegie Mellon the day after and I stopped to have dinner here. The restaurant had fabulous good and I really really enjoyed the staff. Thanks for some great food!!!!
Very good food but a little pricey so I dropped them back a star. The service was excellent.
Overpriced. Bread was hard. The scallops had a lot of grit and very buttery. Not worth the $30 price. A lot of gnats flying around. Very dis-appointing.
Not sure what the fuss is.  Lame sandwiches.  Much better options on the strip.
The space is kind of tight and the presentation could be better but the sandwiches are delicious and fulling. Definately worth the wait for a table.
Bleh.  This place isn't even good when you are drunk.
Visited friend John Mo in Pittsburgh for one night and he brought me here...great move. Big fatty sandwich but really really delicious.
Had the fried shallot salmon roll, awesome! Very fair prices and a nice atmosphere. Can't go wrong.
Fantastic good, great service, and the only place in the Charlotte area I know of to get some real ramen! I definitely suggest the sushi as well, not overpriced to hell like other places are.
Great sushi I haven't try the sushi bar but the sushi rolls are delicious. Some many kinds of sushi with a touch of originality.  No complaints at all in so many years that I been going there.
So I've ordered pizza a couple of times from Fuel. Both times have asked for extra cheese. Must say pretty lame, very thin layer. Not worth it, will look for pizza delivery from someone else.
It's the Plaza Midwood pizza joint. It also has a Ms Pacman/Galaga arcade which I find myself playing most times I visit.
I'm jumping on the bandwagon here: the squash curry is fabulous. \n\nBrave the Willy Street construction to get there.
I've been there only once, and that was enough. Yes, it is too crowded and infested with undergrads. If you are in for a randomly meeting unattractive people, this may be the place for you.
Well, its nice.  But it could be so much more.  The former Majestic movie theater, turned into a dance club.  Apparently doing quite well as the premier Hip Hop dance spot.  Enjoyed working there, don't enjoy drinking there.
Great gym. I loved Becky's Zumba classes and the Functional Fitness 6am classes. What really made it worth it was Cheri's helpfulness in regards to membership issues.
Good food, with the usual good variety of beer choices available in Madison.  Get there early if you're with a large group, the large tables go quickly.  As usual for Madison bars, I love the no smoking law :-)
One menu item...  Bob's (Organic) Bad Breath Burger...  You just HAVE to order this!!  Living up to its name, you will have bad breath for the rest of the night.  :)  But, it's definitely well worth it!!
Best place to eat, drink and hang with friends on the isthmus.  Period.
Cornbread Update:\n\nI think they must have tweaked their recipe, because I tried a piece of the vegan cornbread again and it was perfect. Thanks, Weary Bakers!
Fun neighborhood place with good basic bar grub.
Great food & atmosphere
Come for the coffee, stay (or come back) for the excellent fresh soup, sandwiches and smoothies!  Would be 5 stars if the service was more consistent.
Not to be missed on a nice day in summer.
A definite contender for our \"Winchester\" -our go-to neighborhood pub like The Winchester in the movie Shawn of the Dead.
A small and amazing zoo. It's free, has lots of animals that people (children) like, and  is an easy way to spend a couple hours. This easily beats Chicago's Lincoln Park Zoo. A must-see!
Good food, friendly staff.
This place is a Madison game day staple. The only problem is that this is the case for hundreds of people (and that may be modest). If you are into ass to elbow people, but an incredibly good time, this is the spot for you!
The Penang is out of the world. Jungle curry was really good. Pad Thai was just ok.
One of the best Thai places in town. They have great curry, as well as noodle-based dishes. In addition, they have decent alcoholic beverages. They also deliver!!
The Kona coffee is a personal favorite for my coffee for my hubby.  We love the banana crepes and Monte Cristo.  I also love the Chicken strip salad!
I like this place.  I don't get a chance to go very often but every time I go it's always good.  I always have the Seared Tuna.  Great place to sit outside and eat when it is cooler.
Sweet place!  That's all I have to say...!
This is simply a Holiday Inn in disguise- don't expect anything more (except the flat screen haha) and you will not be disappointed.
I really enjoy coming here! They have great lunch time specials, but try their vino bambino salad (ITS AMAZING). Their pizzas are really good too! For Dessert make sure to have their pizookie!
This place has gone down hill in the past couple of years. Corporate has changed the quality of their pasta in order to save money. The only thing that really tasted good was the cheese bread. I haven't been back since.
Staff was very friendly, and atmosphere was fun, but the Margherita pizza (thin crust) was the worst I have ever had. Mozzarella was so thin you couldn't even taste it. Tasted like cardboard.
The Skinny: Encountered rude staff. \n\nThe Fat: Pit stop, the mall seemed decent but because it's also Arizona, they get a one star anyway. I absolutely hate dealing with rude staff.
food was good and the portions were large good place overall but probably would have been better with kids. good place thanks
They seriously have THE coolest set up & ambiance- but it ends there.\n\nFood is overpriced.\n\nHardly any healthy options.\n\nServers were overloaded so it took forever to get anything.
nice hotel and best bang for the buck
Very old, dated and unbelievably smokey.  Our company had a conference there. The conference area was good but getting from the front door to the upstairs conference area was gross.
Not very clean and rooms smell funny. Not geared for thwarting younger crowd.
I maintain my disdain for the Palms.  I was here last week and the service was just awful!  I was overall unhappy with my stay.
Lots to do in the hotel/casino, but it's just so isolated from the Strip!
Very low quality room off the strip. If your looking to stay at a party hotel with people passed out in the hall  ways and benches out front this is your place. We stayed at the place and it was terrible and the room was half way cleaned checking in.
Wifi doesn't work in many of the public areas!  You'd expect them to get it right.
Stayed here many times but truly nothing special, wife has never been so took her for her b day. Nice rooms and grounds but there is better for less money. Pool and hot tub close at 4:00????? WTH? Staff is very friendly and attentive.
Restaurants don't provide many gluten free or veggie options. Elevator nazis are rude. Wifi in rooms is incredibly slow. This place is stuck in 1998
Terrible, we've stayed at other MGM resorts and they were all better (regardless of price) than this one.
This hotel was horrible. The staff was too nice the food was too good and the room was clean and spacious. If i had a fridge or microwave I would have said 5 star. If you like that sort of thing stay here as for me I'm not staying here again til the next time
The fun atmosphere and nice staff, plus a great room with an awesome view, can't make up for food poisoning from the America restaurant.  I didn't want to spend my vacation in the bathroom.  We will try a different hotel next time we go to Las Vegas.
This place is pretty fun and there is lots of food at a decent price.  There's lots of neat stores including Hershey's! The music is pretty good. This place is good for a gambler on a budget (foodwise).
stayed here on my first visit to vegas.  my friend worked for hilton at the time and got the rooms for free, so why not.  found it to be pretty decent.  the thing is, this place is off the strip, and that made it a major PITA.
Feels dated with a hint of Ghetto. Low ceilings in rooms, reminds me of a better Circus Circus, with less ghettoness.
Let us check in at 9am, friendly staff.  Decor a bit old, but very clean.  Looking forward to our stay
Cheap pricing, decent rooms.\nParadise Cafe has decent food.\nBeds are comfortable, recommend Player Card for Gambling\n\n\n\nA little far from strip.
Nice little casino, went here for raiding the rock vault
This place is a run-down, neglected DUMP. Staff was not friendly at all, and my room smells like raw sewage, but I don't want to wait another HOUR in the check-in line.
Lackluster hotel that should have been torn down years ago. Stained carpets, long check in lines, tattered decor...\n\nThere are too many other places to stay in Vegas to justify staying at the LVH.
Waaaaaaay too much smoke in the Casino, yuck!\nAnd very, very low ceilings - very claustrophobic :(
Meh place, but it was the cheapest and best located decent hotel to stay.\nIf you can afford it, try the newer hotels.
Good location, the room was fairly nice. Overall, A OK. Nice cafes inside as well, decent food.
I wouldn't go to this hotel. I went to Las Vegas many many times. Check out my pictures! I go to the best and worst hotels! This hotel is 2 thumbs down!
This place does offer good sushi and prefixed menu, but it is definitly way over rated. For the price they are asking, I would expect the fish to taste as good as the fishes in Tsukiji Fish Market, in Tokyo.
Obviously, the sushi is good, but the atmosphere is blah.  You can get great sushi at many other places that are less expensive and with better vibes.  Here, you're paying for the name.
Super expensive but holy cow that's some delicious fish.
Overrated! Really. I have to say it.
Best misoyaki butterfish I ever had!  The sake, which I cant remember the name was also great.  I don't know why I have less of an issue dropping some $$$ on high end Japanese food than high end Chinese food.  Hmmmm....
Great atmosphere and food, but a little pretentious, over priced (even for Vegas), and waiters have been trained to up-sell you.
This place is decent. Good price for the strip and it's a non-nightmare. All in all a good experience. Not stellar but definitely good at least. The casinos and bars inside were good. I am a big fan of the pub and the Zowie Bowie show.
Old hotel but always filled with guest and tourists. The Jaba was a great addition to this hotel!
Really liked this place.  It had a nice layout of the casino floor, it was not smokey, and it had a very open feel to it.  Well kept up.  Stop by and say hi.
We got the spa suite, no complaints. I love the medium sized refrigerator, no microwave though.
Rooms were very old they need to update it the casino and hotel itself was not bad.
soo good!!!!!!!!!! this is the 2nd cirque show i have seen and it did not disappoint! Not for the uptight or prude! :)
Great acting....especially the MC...typical Cirque quality.  Did this instead if Believe after reading the reviews.  Glad I did.  Definitely enjoyable as a couple.
This was fun. Got a little board at times.
how can you not love this show if your in Vegas and an open mind this show will not disapoint and you might get lucky with your date afterward
I liked this show alot. It was great. There is something for guys and girls. Even big girls got love which is a surprise. BBWs walking around giving out strawberries was cool. My wife and I had a good time watching this show.
This was different than the other Cirque de Soleil  shows in a sense that it's a combination of acrobatics meets stand up comedy,  all while being sexual at the same time.  I enjoyed it and was very much entertained.
It's not what I expected. If you want real luxury in Vegas stay at Bellagio or Palazzo
Best hotel in Vegas?  Yes.  Have I been to all the hotels in Vegas?  No.\n\nI've been to some and this is AS GOOD AS IT GETS.\n\nI want to live here.
This place is great to walk around. Anyone into art needs to check this place out.
After they cancelled my reservation for no reason, embarrassing me in front of my group, I will never stay here again.  \nSad,cause it was my favorite hotel and recommended it highly to all who were coming to Vegas.
Didn't stay there but best casino ladies room on the strip.  We tried em all at some point :-)
I love it here! Stayed here for 3 nights in mid June.\n\nSuite was huge! Couldn't have asked for more. It was just perfect.\n\nWe will definitely stay here again.
This was my favorite Place on the strip. A nice chance. Plus a calming feeling in a city of constant noise and chaos. Even in the crowd, I felt I had my own experience here. Great place to shop, eat, visit, or play! Check it out.
Still nice after all these years - though the indoor/outdoor thing is still a little creepy.
checkin/checkout is really slow and crowded with the huddled masses, public areas are very smokey, restaurants are over priced, wish we had stayed at the venetian.
I'll keep it short, nice hotel for the price and great pool area. Close to all the good stuff.
box office service sucks!
Used to be a cheesy place but now it's classy and centrally located. It's rather affordable too!
BED BUGS...BEWARE. Infested and never reported.
You don't get much for your player card status at Mirage . Wi-Fi Internet access in the hotel room is terrible; which you are paying for with a resort fee.
Was having a great time until I realized they house six captive dolphins. Was shocked...they are literally in a swimming pool. Really sad. No thanks i'll stay elsewhere next time.
The bone in ribeye was freakin delicious!  I am glad had a good experience at my first Emeril restaurant.  Hopefully my next one will be Commanders Palace in 2 years.  woot woot.
I didn't get a chance to eat here but the mojitos were absolutely divine. they make their own rum in house and could easily be the elixir of the gods. worth the time, every time. highly recommend.
Great service! Excellent menu! Their chateaubriand steak was mouth-watering!
Very good, excellent sides, tasty food.
Good for the management to reach out and connect with me.  I hope they are sincere in making an effort to make this establishment a better experience for everyone.
Was a great hotel and love the fact that I got 40% off my KA tickets. But when it comes to the small things it sucks. Like no free wireless Internet, no fridge, and no microwave. But I still had a great time.
1 Star.
Stayed here for 2 weeks had a group of 20 staying here. I didn't like the place . Rooms where outdated . Casino was always busy and couldn't enjoy myself so spent the whole trip at other casinos
Love this place. It's great for all ages, and don't get me started on how comfortable the beds are. The service is fast and very responsive.
Stay away, this place is just a huge time share and they promise you the moon and after hours of what should be considered torture you feel emotionally drained. I wish I would have spit on the guy that stopped me in the street instead of give him the time of day
Ridiculously great bartenders. \nFrom Noon til 5, Monday through Friday, you can have any drink in the bar for $2.\nThey have Slim Jim's and Twinkies.\nFree shows all the damn time.
This place is super fun music is hella loud and the drinks are so heavy you can't ask anything better
booked the place. they put us on the last room before they remodeled entire hotel. find out the last day. wasn't pleasant experience
This was a very oridnary hotel, nothing especial. It did not match our expectation of a four star hotel in Vegas. We stayed there for one night, then for the same price we got another hotel that was much better.
Brings me lots luck here, specially the 777 slot machines...  :-)
Stayed here for 1 night and the room was really nice. The bed was super comfortable and the bathroom was a nice size. My only complaint was that there was no outlet by the nightstand to charge my phone.
I write this with a heavy heart. Everything was fine. But Bed Bugs attacked me :-(. And I am no Diva but this made me sad!!!!! Anyway to sanitize beds???? Otherwise A ok.
Since ditching the pirate theme, TI is hotel with identity crisis.  Not impressed with the room which had broken fixtures & loud A/C.  spa is a joke which have to pay $17 extra.  Only plus is good location.  Stay at Rio for $50 Less and much better room
This is a pretty crappy and old hotel. The room was dusty and had several missing items such as cups and laundry bags.  The bed sheet was dirty and had a huge bloodstain right in the middle of the bed. I had to ask housekeeping to come and replace the bed sheets.
The shower drain was clogged....The rooms aren't that great, but if you're a poor college student or poor postgrad...then it's not that bad.  Great location.
the most disgusting, repulsive, filthy, dishonest, poorly run hotel on the face of the earth. I would not stay here again if I were paid $10000.
Great rates and a great restaurant for breakfast. Been here twice \n(might have been more, kinda hazy) but from what I remember it was a good place to lay  my head.
I don't get it. Its about time they tore down this casino and put up a real one.
This is pretty poor French food.  I had the onion soup which was honestly the worst I've ever had in my life.  I also tried to get them to make me a crepe complet (egg, ham, cheese) and they pretty much failed.  Sad.
Great little resturaunt right outside the Paris Hotel with a nice view. We had breakfast and the service and food was great.
The steak here was very good and cooked perfectly. I love the fried potatoes that come with the meal. I think my favorite part was the bread and the foie gras! Would def come here again when i get the chance
The snails and bread were good otherwise don't eat dinner here.  Slimy undercooked farmed salmon and greasy cheesy pasta.  No one at our table liked the various other entrees. Great view of the strip though!
I am not familiar with the French restaurants, but I guess this place is ok. escargot could have been cooked better though.
The service and atmosphere was first rate and the food was very tasty.  We have enjoyed  Mon Ami Gabi in other cities but this location definately stands out.
Great spot to eat outside and watch the fountains. Great food, although since it's French it can be a bit heavy. Love the steaks and the onion soup.
Nice view of Bellagio and the watershow, romantic environment, friendly staff, and great food!\n\nI just wish it wasn't so darn expensive =/ A plate of small Caesar salad is already $9!
First of all, it's in front of the Bellagio where you can watch the water show while dining. (Well if u're seated outside) I love the food. The waiter recommended a drink and it was delicious. Will def go back here next time I'm in Vegas.
Food is good but a little pricey for the quality.  The best part of the restaurant is enjoying your meal on the patio watching the fountains and people go by.
Nice street side seating. Enjoyed the brunch (Eggs Benedict) and bloody mary bar. Overall a good experience and would return.
Lobster Roll was great. Try their French Onion Soup. I need to go back and experience more of the food. The seating was pretty good. Service was great.
Still my favorite meal since I moved to Las Vegas 7 years ago - and I've had many wonderful meals here. The French Onion soup is out of this world and comes in a huge crock. The filet mignon was melt in your mouth delicious. Highly recommend.
Great atmosphere. Prime location across from the Bellagio water fountain show. Prices are as expected for being on the strip. I've had better though...that's the reason for three stars.
Not very impressed.  For the price and location, I was expecting A LOT more.
Steak frites have a pesto like butter sauce on them.\nVery accomodating staff for our 3 children.\nQuiche is divine, I'm still thinking of it.
So freaking good. Sangria amazing! Escargots delicious, onion soup amazing, scallops I could eat all day! Fresh bread at the table still warm!!! I love this place!
Was lazy in planning and didn't make reservations in time for anyplace better.  First time visit here for me, last Saturday night.  \n\nFood was just okay, especially considering the prices.  I guess you're paying for the view of the Bellagio fountain across the street.
Effeciency of ordering and care... Hiccough only with reservation when I arrived which was quickly amended... Great food and view
The best place in Vegas with the most beautiful view of the Bellagio. Food was great, service was excellent. The bread is too die for...all in all one of the best places on The Strip.
Get the streak frites.  That is all you need to know.
Service was slow. Had to send entree back to the kitchen because it was overcooked. Food was very bland.
Love the atmosphere.  Its best to get their late in the afternoon when the Bellagio fountains go off and stay to watch the sun go down as the lights of The Strip come on.
Had a beautiful dinner on the patio overlooking the fountain show for my birthday with loved ones.  Each and every part of our experience was fantastic.  This will be one of the best French meals you'll ever have.
Wherever you are, eat where locals eat... this is not one of them...service is terrible,  and food is a long way from being 100% French... just another tourist trap....
Love their french onion soup\nLove their sea food platter\nLove their oysters\nLove their wine selection\nLove sitting on the balcony on a warm evening night people watching\n\nCheers.
best steak I've ever had. best customer service. affordable lux food.
Vintage Vegas at it's best! The retaurant is cool, but the lounge is awesome!! Perfect late-night spot for couples.
Meh. A little on the greasy side. Went for breakfast and the portions were ginormous. The food was decent, on par with Denny's or Coco's, aside of the huge portions. I'm a fan of the large coffee mugs though.
Disgusting portions of cheap and unhealthy grub. And long lines.
This is the best place to go after the club. The food is pretty good. Not the the best but it works when your intoxicated. Lol
The peppermill is one of the oldest and most established late night eateries in town. The service is always great and expedient. The peppermill is a great place to grab a bite at any time of the day.
Food is alright, not bad for a dennys variant. But service....I get better service at McDonald's.
this review will be quick and to the point!!  open 24hrs. \n\ngo hungry -- leave extremely full!!
Walked throughout here to check out their gambling scene and they seriously need an update!! Everything looked very old and worn out. The atmosphere was very dead and dull. Was not excited to try and gamble here at all!
Really chill hotel. No complaints from me.
Oh man! What a disappoint. The lunch buffet really needs a visit from Chris Angel because it's in need of a magic show, make this food disappear!
Casino: \nA little on the older side but overall great slot machines and table games.  \n\nLove the upgraded modern rooms and the prices are reasonable for being on the strip and centralized to a lot of restaurants and shopping.\n\nThe staff is always nice.
Dilapidated, overpriced, loud, dowdy, cheap, spring break crowd, wait in line for EVERYTHING, $4 for a little bottle of Dasani, service is indignant...I mean, why go here?
Casino is decent, pool is fun, rooms due for revamp.. The suite I was in had water damage from hottub in room with furniture peeling apart.  When I called the front desk they said all the rooms were like that. ;o(
Crappy hotel with crappy scary elevators, everything are outdated and worn out, CRT tv and no wifi!?
Nice rooms but I'd only return I'd there was a coffee maker in the room. If the want you to get up and gamble they shouldn't make guests wait in the 40 + people long line at either Starbucks for overpriced drip !
I was a little disappointed. My room kind of sucked and the hotel service was a little off. We had fun gambling here and there is a really fun bar to get the night started but all in all I don't plan in stating here again.
Do not come here. A million hidden fees. I had to pay to RECIEVE a package that was sent to me. Ridiculous.
Older but comfy.  Great for the you get crowd.be sure to eat at the Taco & Tequila bar!
The hotel is good but the buffet is horrible. My husband and I got sick after we left after dinner. Overall, I liked the room and casino. AVOID BUFFET!
Just checked in and found out that there's no wifi in the room, no HDTV and you'd think they'd offer a discount or credit to us disabled veterans on Veteran's Day Weekend. .... never stay here again.
Be sure to take photos of your room before you leave, the added on a BS charge for two damaged room phones and a broken door lock.  $400 for two phones I didn't even touch. Ridiculous.  Never going back to any of the MGM Mirage Properties ever again.
Had a very difficult time getting into the hotel between the Valet being full, registration very crowded with only a couple staff working the desk, slow service in the restaurant and lots of early morning noise from the housekeeping group in the hallways.
Very nice place, great restaurant and bars!! I love how they infuse the air with a coconutty smell like suntan lotion!!! Better then cigarette smoke! The staff is nice and helpful!
I loved Mandayay Bay Resort & Casino. It was clean, beautiful, fun, our room was georgous!  So much to do there, good entertainment, good food. Had a great time and we will go back soon!
Pools!! Room!! Nice place! Lots of Fun!! The pools are allot of fun!!  FUN FUN FUN
Ventilation is horrible. I feel like I smoked 3 packs of cigarettes just walking across the casino. Need major upgrade.
I guess each hotel has to have something of its own to separate them from others. And what makes Mandalay Bay one of the ultimate places for having a great time outdoors is their big artificial looking beach. Kick back relax enjoy the water and the live DJ music.
Stayed here in 2009\nBesides a roach being in our room and the staff providing us with spray so that we could handle the problem ourselves; it was a nice stay. The staff overall was kind and helpful and the resort was very close to the strip.
Do you have any idea how frustrating it is to cut a $50 ribeye with a dull steak knife?  My only memory of this place is having to saw my steak.
Side dishes were good but the New York strip was the worst I ever had! Very disappointing this type of restaurant should be top notch- skip it.
Great meal, highly recommend this place. The chef's menu is the way to go. You will not go away hungry!
The best steak house on the strip.  The roasted steaks are great.  Fries should not be missed!  Quite expensive.  Awesome service.  Incredible wine list (study it before you dine).
I've eaten here twice now. The service has been outstanding. The steaks good, the braised short ribs are to die for.
Me and my Business partner had dinner there last night. Ordered the Chief special with Kobe Ribeye and My partner ordered the Filet. Both were good. Nothing to rave over thou. I would expect better quality for the price and would probably choose a different steak house next time.
Divine!  That really sums it up.  Have the hanger steak.  It is simple perfection and honestly enough for two.  Tender, with the juices perfectly sealed in.  I dream of my next visit to Vegas and another amazing meal here.
I must have ordered the wrong thing for breakfast.  I had a typical breakfast dish with eggs and bread and there was nothing to rave about.  There was a large selection to choose from, but nothing to say wow!
Excellent meal and high quality service.  Had an excellent chicken and fries meal and a fantastic salad.  Though this was way better than Joel Robuchon.  Also, much chiller with nice bar dining area if you are not interested in a table or doing Vegas solo.
Service is soooo slow!! Food is good but nothing spectacular. Go to grand lux for beignets instead.
Do not go here. King of like maggianos. I hate it. Huge factory. We had bad experience with almost everything we ordered. If u love french fries then this is your place.\nWe both got sick after.
I was a little out of my element at this high class restaurant but it was worth the trip.  We went for breakfast and tried the Chicken and Waffles.  The baked chicken and gravy was fantastic.  The service was top notch.
Fine place to go if you want a casual dinner but don't expect much more.  Well priced, many options, everything good but nothing amazing.  Loud atmosphere, service fine. If you're looking for a more celebrity chef type restaurant you can easily find better options.
Breakfast. Decent filled omelet, nice crisp bacon, coffee stronger than American but weaker than real French, disappointingly ordinary brioche toast, fawning service. Prices not too heinous considering the location, but it's really about as French as Olive Garden is Italian.
If you're staying at Venetian, it's hard to eat anywhere else for brunch. I mean... this place was literally on our way out of the room. They have a nice patio surrounded by fountains, and the omelets are different every day ;)
Place has gone down hill.  Total tourist trap for deep wallets and/or suckers.  The ones in NY and Boston are fantastic.  To be fair, service was excellent.  That's about it.  Food was bland at best.
Good Day\nA week before Christmas we arrived in Las Vegas.  Visiting our daughter who lives in the area.\nTruly memorable,  great food , excellent service and the fountain show was so sweet. Christmas songs, great food,  wonderful ambience. \nWill definitely be back .
Best food in Vegas. All natural, fresh, healthy, and tasty!
Not that great, very busy and it seemed every store I entered was out of what I was looking for.  Parking is horrible as well.  I don't plan on ever going back to this place.  I gave it two stars instead of one since the misters are nice in the summer.
Far too many people and long lines both for counters and and fitting rooms. Try find other Premium Outlets for example near Los Angeles.
lots of shopping came to buy things\n\ndodged asian tourist to get to stores\n\nspent money - would do again
this place had terrible service the morning that i went and it's not worth it for the price we paid.  it was just ok....i wouldn't go back
All I remember is a HUGE and delicious chicken nacho. There was so much cheese that the waitress actually brought us extra chips to scoop it up. And it was ridiculously cheap. I'll go back sometime and see if other dishes are as good.
777.... that's it, you don't wanna try anything else, best steak ever. Never disappoints you..my favorite late night dinning place
Its the Hard Rock Hotel cafe.  You eat here because its convenient.  They charge in accordance of that.
This place has gone to shits !! The food sucks and the service is horrible ! It used to be good but now it's the worse.. Don't go coz the food is not good n dry n disgusting.. Sorry to say
What a downer...ended the evening here...food...just regular ole bar food...nothing special...drinks just average...water tasted good and fairly priced...
The best sushi I had in Vegas definitely a five star experience for Vegas
Really should deal with their rotten trash dead animal smell. Haven't been there for a while and hope they improve it.
Just don't eat at the one in the airport. Cold food.
After reading so many positive reviews, I expected much more from this place.  While the dish presentations were attractive and the flatbread was pretty good, the rest of our experience was unimpressive.  There are many other restaurants I would visit before considering a return to Eno Vino.
Worth the money. You'll probably see celebrities here. You have to get there early to ensure entry.
hella stuffy.\nhella no space to dance.\nloooonnnggeessst wait ever in my life (even my party was on the guestlist).
This is a really beautiful club with beautiful people. Unfortunately it was packed to the gills for the Memorial Day weekend, so it made it a little uncomfortable at times. However, it was still a fun time.
got in free before 12am one wkend - the club is smaller than i expected like the dancefloor which is weird & crowded at times and hot lol theres other VIP rooms but the decor is nice
This was the best stop that Nite Tours provided!  Dug the music and the crowd.  There are separate rooms with different music.  The \"white room\" had a great vibe to it with folks getting down to the beats.
Door staff girl was the rudest person! Even the group in front of us was complaining about her as well. We considered leaving at this point , but decided to try out the place. Very pretentious vibe! Will definitely not be going back!!!
Went here with some friends and was not familiar with the menu.  The order counter seemed confusing to me too. Got a turkey sandwich,  but think they used miracle whip not mayo.  Not a fan though.
Great food selection and excellent service.  If you're VIP you don't have to wait.  High quality and Pierre Jout Champagne.
What a disappointment! Food overcooked! Certainly not worth the $85! Much better places.
Nice place to visit to remind you how good the real thing was.  Best to go on the weekends as thats when the schweinshaxe is served.
This place is dece.
I'm not quite sure how to rate this.  In Germany this food would be 2 star food at best.  Add on another star for the live music.  IF you've never been to the real one, this is 4 or 5 stars.
Good atmosphere, good food!
this place is a blast!   like being in Munich all year...we celebrate alot of occasions here and always fun..good food..
This place is rowdy and awesome!
Great German food in an exact replica of the original Hofbrauhaus in Munich, Germany.
Fun and a good time, but not much food for your money and it's expensive. I would go back there though. Maybe a once a year trip here, not a regular location. Staff were great, polite, and fast.
Food was boring and the quality of Hometown Buffet. The price was ridiculously expensive. I will never come to this restaurant again.
The service was ridiculous, took about 20 min before our server attended us after being seated in what felt to us like a high school cafeteria.  After the food was finally brought out it was cold and didn't taste like eatable.  I would never go back.
Better than a buffet but not great. Portions were appropriate (small) and too salty. Wish I would have skipped the wine.
08/01/2013\nWe were there for Happy Hour, the Carpaccio was awesome, the Pizza Fresh, great cocktails exceptional service Nice Job!
Server very disconnected from doing his job, serving! I ordered the Seafood mixed grill... Great flavor, yet tiny portion for $30! All other Flavors rocked...
This place serves the best burger I have ever had. It's a hip joint with a great menu and amazing quality food. No weaknesses.\n\nGo for the Delux Burger with sweet taters (and extra helpings of aioli).
The food is ok.  I like the ambiance....it's a little expensive
this place is amazing. Every item we have gotten here has been awesome, including the veggie panini
The service was a bit slow but the food made up for it. The sushi was delicious and the burger was unique and flavorful. We also got the mixed delux fries basket which was phenomenal. I would definitely come back.
This such a unique place and so is the food. Oh and by the way it is fantastic!!
AMAZING!!!!! No need to bore you with the details. Look at the youtube vid for the food network that will tell you all you need to know.
The jerk chicken fried rice was incredible and the red jade chicken was delicious and the perfect heat.  However, if you are trying to eat healthy, this isn't the place for you.
Modern styles intertwined into a combo of cuisine between two cultures. Do not miss out on the Bandido.
The food here is very unique yummy fusion between Mexican & Chinese. Have to try it to believe it! very laid back & I got to have a glass of wine with my dinner. Im def a fan
This place is an Arizona treasure.  I have been going there for 15 years now and it's always consistently good.  I recommend the 7Q & 9Q with black beans and jerk fried rice.  The included Snicker Doodle cookie makes it a complete meal.
I liked that you can sample various items before ordering.  Loved the dish I ordered, but now have to go back again to order the rest!
This was a huge let down!! It's in terrible need of a MAJOR cleaning which made me wonder how dirty the kitchen and prep areas were!! We will not be going here again
Tasted worst than a college dorm cafeteria. UC Davis has a better eating experience than this buffet. Limited selection and undercooked meat.
This was the most disgusting buffet I've ever experienced. I'm actually sick in my room from this place and I hardly are anything. Nothing was fresh. Everything probably came out of a microwave. \nTerrible brunch.
Super place to eat. Don't waste your money on Denny's or Ihop. Great food, staff and service. Open 24/7
Bellagio and the Wynn Hotel buffets are two of the best in Vegas.  The quality, and culinary touch is far better than the other Vegas buffets.  Bellagio's interior decor is surprisingly a bit cafeteria styled for one of the better hotels.
I wouldn't come back here again especially for the price. I've heard great reviews about this place. But the only thing great about this buffet is the crabs! The rest of the food was BLAH! - J
Over-rated in a town where you can get better buffet food at a much lower cost. Long lines are not worth the wait. Look elsewhere
Great buffet. I think I gained 5 lbs before the check came. I just changed my mind and took away a star cuz I remember the steak or whatever meat they were serving was not that good.
Worth every penny!  Tons of selection.
Food good but not as good as Wicked Spoon of Wynn's buffet.\nService was not good.\nRestrooms were terrible!!!
Disappointed. Nothing stood out. The deserts were okay. I honestly expected more !
not too bad, but to be frank, the buffet not meet my expectation. or the buffet in some hotel in china is much better? a little disappointed.
Quality of food has gone down.  We went for dinner and were disappointed.  We have been here before so we looked forward to returning.  We will be going to Wynn instead.
Quality of the food was poor.  Lots of choices but just didn't think the food was worth the price.\n\nThink a stand-alone place is a better choice.  You'll get better quallity food & eat less.
I really liked the use of space and decorations.\n\nI also like the coupon that they give. \n\nI did not like the mediocre food. However, it IS a buffet and I did not expect too much from it.
breakfast was very good, still overpriced, but good\nalot of variety
I would definitely check this off the list and not go back. Food was not enjoyable. There were 7 of us and it was our last stop from our 24 hour Vegas buffet pass. None of us finished our food and hardly went back for seconds.
I really liked it. Loved the cupcake variety. Food was fresh, kept hot, pleasant experience. There will be lines no matter what time you go. Staff is polite and attentive. Went here on a groupon- good wine and beer choices.
Typically buffet. Dried out food and over priced. Don't go without a discount of some kind. Go the Denny's for breakfast instead.
I love this show.  It was the most amazing show I have ever seen.\n\nThe only slight problem is that now I compare every show I see to this show and always end up thinking 'it wasn't as good as Mystere'.  Like nothing can come close.
I've seen two other Cirque du Soleil shows (Love and Ka), which I like better than Mystere.  The acrobatics are amazing, but I wasn't the biggest fan of the comedic moments or the baby.
This is the second Cirque show I have seen, and I love all of them! They all seem to challenge your imagination, and the performers are amazing!
Waste of money, I went with 4 friends and all of us were falling asleep.
Great acrobatics, but weird story.  It is worth seeing once, not sure I would go back unless I score a locals deal.
brunch only until 1PM on sunday and noon on Saturday?  is it just my spoiled Chicago self, or does that seem a little early to stop serving brunch?
Good Club, but 1 Major unexcuseable problem for me...\n\nI have to wait in a line to go into the MENS restrooms????
Tao SUCKS! .....NEXT!!
the bistro is pricey but good food.  you have to want to go to enjoy the environment.\n\nthe nightclub was subpar.  they played pop music and songs that are not fun to dance to unless you're drunk off your mind.
They make you line up a mile long and wait till 1130 to let people in. \nDoormen are assholes
Hello pretty girls bathing in bathtubs.\n\nHello dude that came out from nowhere who talked to me weird.\n\nHello insanely packed crowds.\n\nHello Expensive drinks.\n\nHello Las Vegas.
The music sucks! Dj was really bad. Bunch of guys and not enough females. Dance floor too crowded
Not bad. But if ur a dude. It doesn't matter what u spend. Bathroom line is ridiculous. Not worth the cover. If ur a dude. Don't come. .
Great resort.  Everything is laid out great with the exception of the 2 mile walk to the events center and conference halls.  Room service is great and there is a great selection of amazing restaurants.
Nice hotel, excellent pool and relaxing spa
Great rooms, We had a living room and a bedroom with one and a half baths and even a TV in the master bath, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay for my boyfriends birthday.  A bit far to walk down the strip but the Mandalay Bay and the adjoining hotels have plenty to do.
Best ravioli on the planet. Great fresh fish as well
We hosted a customer dinner event here last week.  We had a group of 30 and our dinner was excellent.  Service and food was outstanding.
HOLY SH*T the bacon cheese rolls! amazballs!! good food and i liked the upscale atmosphere.  Nice place for a really expensive date night
Mediocre, pretentious and overpriced, even by Las Vegas standards. Pedestrian presentation of decent steaks. Outrageous prices on the wine list. Go somewhere else.
The sheer power and aura around this place for ten minutes helped finalize my decision to go to UW-Madison. I wanted to be there. The setting is that good.\nEnough said.
Worst restaurant during our entire stay in Vegas. Service and food was horrible. Our waiter gave us bad service. You're better off going to McDonalds. Very expensive.
Awesome crepes\nI would recommend the peanut
There's nothing quite like dancing on the deck 52 stories above the strip with the summer wind blowing your hair around. It makes anyone feel like a hip hop video vixen. Yes boys, even you.
Wasn't impressed by this show and even slept through part of it. I saw another cirque du Soleil show at Suffolk Downs a few years back that was much more entertaining. I have to give the performers credit though, the acrobatics and diving were pretty cool.
Amazing visual feast.  Well worth the price.  Just see it.
Definitely worth watching. The girlfriend took me to see this and I was very pleased. The transitioning from land to water was amazing. Don't waste your time on NY cirque du soleil shows...stick with vegas... WOW
This is my third cirque show(mystere and zarkana), this was by far the best!! Seriously, air acrobats plus diving.... Absolutely amazing. Very expensive, but definitely worth the price.  Great vegas show!
I have to say this is the worst $150 we spent in our entire life. The show may be good in early 2000s, but can't make me excited in 2013. Any circus show on Asian TV programs may be better than this. Sorry I just don't get it.
Fascinating!! Jaw dropping!
Im going to be honest, i had NO FLIPPING idea what was going on!\n\nbut it looked cool as hell, i say its an assault on your senses. prob wouldn't pay to watch it again though.
I feel asleep.... it wasnt that good... some of t he stunts were cool.. but other than that... it was okay
You can never go wrong with watching KA.  The stage is a true masterpiece since it moves.  The best seats are in the back section or else your neck might hurt from looking up if your in the front section.  Spectacular show.  A must see!
Well, this is truly a yawner.  The show does have some great acrobats, but the story is hard to follow.  The moving stage gets old quickly.  Totally not worth the high ticket price.  I was disappointed.
Not amused. It's an okay show, but actually, I was quite bored. I've seen other Cirque shows and this has to be at the bottom of my list along with Zumanity.
I Hated it!  I felt the baton throwing and staged fighting was very boring.
Came here for the Catfish Sloppy Joe recommended by Oprah. It was good but not mind blowing as Oprah has exaggerated. The clam chowder was good enough for seconds.
Great  food, but watch out for the specials with outrageous prices. Staff is apparently schooled to push the specials and avoid mentioning the super high prices. Deceptive practices like this ruin the experience.
Napkins shed little white flakes all over your clothes, the lobster and and soups are great, but the crab was bitter.
It's worth a look just to see the view from the terrace and the over-the-top decor.  I'd like to come here wearing a Members Only jacket just to bask in the irony.
Great club/Lounge. Excellent service and bottle service is a must. The view in the patio is also wonderful. Special thanks to Dimitri and Kristina S for their excellenct customer service and friendliness.
Good night view !! Service was good ! Best place for romantics date ,birthday ! When u visit vegas from other state you should try here !
We got in for free from Social House upstairs, but left pretty quickly.  The club is rather small, and when we were there, it was pretty empty.  I certainly wouldn't pay to come in here.
Just. Called no longer open to locals unless you buy a cabana. They don't like locals it's just a lame slogan.
This place always sends out shady advertising deals. I am not sure what they mean by we love locals because we are locals and avoid this place like the plague.
Denny's quality food with Las Vegas quantity prices.  Pass.
great brunch...not too pricey
Don't bother. Any breakfast dish will disappoint, but the OJ is great.
Food is Okay. Breakfast wasn't very good (which is very disappointing when you are hung over) but their salads and sandwiches were decent. Can't really complain too much since it is open 24 hours but its not super special.
I'm a fan of Cheesecake Factory but I don't think this place is that good... If you are a fan of Cheesecake Factory, go there instead.
Everything about this restaurant is excellent! Price,quality, service!We always take our guest here! Never ate at the one in The Palazzo.Weve never had a bad dish!
I like this place for the food and reasonable prices.  It is nice to take a couple steps away from the casino and have a good meal.  The staff is always helpful and breakfast is really good.  I recommend the Protein Breakfast.
The Cheesecake Factory owns this cafe.  The food is always good and the prices are what you would expect.  They are open 24/7.  The wait staff is nice.
I love grand lux. I never had a item on the menu I didn't like. Came here late late night and they were out of bread. The waitress brought us a order of fries to substitute. Try the cream of chicken soup. You'll thank me for it
Been coming here for the past few years always a must! Everything is always delicious, the staff is great. We always come for the buffalo rolls/balls and the Cesar salad is our favorite. Great quality food and quick service.
Great food! Our service was excellent from Pierre. It's quite reasonable for Vegas, but still high for the real world.
Went here for lunch and it was baaad. The cornbread was edible and that was about it.
What can I say it's The House of Blues, if you've seen one you've seen them all. mostly standing room unless you pay for bottle service or the balcony is open. Good sound I have no complaints.
Have eaten at the Jade Palace several times this past winter. Always excellent service and food. It gets busy on the weekends so plan ahead.
The food here is amazing. I have tried more then half of it and it's all great. The staff is fun and the customers new and old mike you feel at home. This is a great place to relax and have a blast.
It is sad to see taiwan Express go. I enjoyed their food enormusly
This place was not good.  Definitely not the place to be scene.  Not a good looking crowd.
Memories memories memories\n\nI have so much fond memories here.  The club is swanky and is really good with treating the girls =).  My favorite thing... playing on the pole.  Mental pictures, no cameras please =)
came for a fraternity reunion a few years ago and for a friend's bday... not impressed. this club is probably on its way to being played out...like tao, pure, etx...
Disliked the rooms. Not impressed
it's already been said in every other review, but the Mattress Factory is pretty amazing.  They have installations that are extremely unique and orginal.  You won't find art like this anywhere else in the city.
Very nice atmosphere for a date or with friends.  If you are into wine, this is a great spot.
Very Nice Atmosphere, As Far As The Food The Only I Had So Far Was The Shrimp Bisque It Was Good Not Great But Good. But I Will Go Back To Try A Few Other Things
Love this place!  I've only been here twice, both for lunch and both times were excellent.  Great place to get a sandwich - hot or cold. Fresh products make this a nice lunch spot. I'll definitely be back.
The building is cool, the food value is pretty good, but food flavor has diminished a lot.  The salsas were sweet (why sweet?), and the meats were bland.  Bummer.  Better Mexican food is pretty commonly available.
If you choose just one Mexican restaurant in Mesa, choose this one.  It ranks as one of the best in flavor, authentic food, and decor.
I've been there twice, mostly due to the ambiance. After my last experience having to order from the \"to go\" area due to a fire in the main kitchen, I have decided to never go back. Taco Bell would have been better.
Great sushi and service.  The 5th star just being held back because of the high prices.  Incredible ambiance and easy to make reservations online.
Good cold beer. Good chips & salsa. The steak pyramid was excellent! Our waiter was a bit on the slow side but we did have a large table seated so he gets a bit of a slide. Definitely recommended!
Delicious enchiladas divorciadas, and pineapple mojitos!!
Just ate there last night with my girlfriend, and it was AWESOME!!!  The braised short rib flakes off as you push down with your fork, the cocktails are great, and even their take on a fish taco has its own novel nuances.
Phenomenal service. Fresh salad and tasty soups made from scratch! I will definitely be back. They make it so easy to eat healthy.
You can never go wrong with Maggiano's. Rigitoni D is the best! I was surprised however this one wasn't crowded on a Sunday evening. The food was wonderful. The waiter did make us feel a bit rushed when ordering but accommodated our children very well.
Great food , great service, nice atmosphere.
Famous Dave's is a typical corporate barbecue place - heavy on the barbecue sauce to cover up the otherwise tasteless selection of meats. On the plus side, the bar is nice and well stocked, but I wouldn't suggest going for the food.
just get the coconut margarita! \n\ntaco bell is better in respect to the food and service quality
Not worth a penny of your money.  The food is just awful.  It's equivalent to Chevy's.  So you think Chevy's is great food, you'll love this place.  If you are looking for decent Mexican food, however, steer clear.
Quite possibly the worst Tex-Mex meal ever served.  I had dinner with my client and staff at this hotel in February 2010.  What a disaster.  It was so bad that everyone at the table commented on how bad the food was.  Save for the chips and salsa, complete disaster.
I and my 4 friends were not impressed with this place.  The pizza isn't what we feel is great pizza.  Go to La Grande Orange, Pizzaria Bianco, or Cafepino.
I love their Burrata cheese, it is to die for, and of course their pizza's are amazing! Nice patio seating is a plus, and it's not too hard to find good parking in the area.
Yummy for me tummy!
This place used to be better but unfortunately- it's going down hill. The food is bland. The chicken in their salads especially. I used to like it, but now I have no reason to go back.
Enjoyed my veggie burger with fries. Service sucked the last 2 times. We had to flag down a waitress to get our refills. Next time we'll do take out to avoid tipping poor service
I've visited Fez and few times and plan to put it on regular rotation now that I've moved back to Phx.  Tasty and inventive food, good service, really nice atmosphere.
Great lunch specials and service was great. Will be back.
Great Sunday brunch. Excellent breakfast, excellent dinner. Trendy, yet quality food. I like this place.
After the manager read my review he contact me and apologized. I have yet to return to the place, but the manager assured me my experience will be different. Since then the server that served me was terminated. Looking forward to going again.
Happy is great... good food, drink specials and the staff are nice!
Awesome! Great food, amazing sangria and the staff is very kind. Would highly recommend this place.
One of our downtown Phoenix staples. I love the strawberry blueberry cashew salad and the margaritas. Annnd the spicy harissa fries. ...Aaaand the hummus. You really can't go wrong no matter what you order.
If you like smoke-filled shitholes without working electrical outlets and staff who wait on you at THEIR convenience, then the Plaza is the hotel for you!\n\nNEVER AGAIN!  I wouldn't return if they paid me.
Quick review:\n\nWe ate at the sushi place inside and it was delicious! My boyfriend loves it here just because they offer crapless craps... I can safely say that we will probably stop by on our next trip.
Service is excellent. Food was so-so. Music is also good. Drinks were tasty. Sit upstairs where the band is.
I'm going to give this place 5 stars only because I feel bad I kinda threw up on their floor... \n\nI'm really sorry, Jimmy. I was really trashed!!
Over priced! Over rated!
it's a party on the inside, very cool decor and volcano show\n\nbetter burgers than \"The Burger Joint\" in the same location\n\naverage food but worth the price
The food is below average for the strip. The only reason to goto this place is to drink a cold one and watch all the hot chicks parade up and down the strip. Having said that, I love this place.
place is always happening and the food is great.  it can get real crowded and the wait can be long to get a seat. so i f there is room in the bar then go ahead if not. wait. its worth it
Awesome time with the family. I mean the tequilla didn't hurt, but it was good food, good music and live entertainment.  Mt three boys loved the dancing betty in a swimsuit.  Kinda pricey though.
The nachos were HUGE they were pretty good. The margaritas are really good and have a nice kick.
Great steak fajitas!!! I was super hungry after a night of cocktails & craps..I like the liveband and the decor, we'll def be back next time.
Came here one night with my hubby. We drank margaritas. The night started out with people singing karaoke, but once people stopped going up the karaoke host rocked it. It was a lot of fun!
I HATE clubbing and HATE people who refer to themselves as clubbers. This place is about as much fun as church on Sunday and has just as many fake people as Church as well. Stay away unless you want to be surrounded by douche bags.
I visited this place today for the first time in 15 years.  I have to say:  they still have all of those amazing recipes and flavors.  Now that I'm back in town it will certainly be a restaurant that I visit frequently.  Seriously tasty food!
Sticky tables, loud, mediocre food for the price, decent saki selection bumped it to 2 stars.  Look for better.
Hair in our sushi. All servers with their long hair down? Not fresh. Not good. Won't be back.
Came here late night for cocktails and a bite. Loved the dumplings.  Beef skewers were good but kinda marbled. Watermelon flavored martini was bomb but could use a little more alcohol. Overall a great experience!
no other place like it.\n\n\nleave your girlfriends/wives at home.
Great variety of machines from many eras and lots of fun.
best pinball arcade in the usa!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
What a fun trip down memory lane! I loved seeing some of the old pinball machines (and a TRON video game! Holy crap!), and letting my kids experience such a large chunk of my childhood. Everyone should go here and visit at least once.
There was a chunk of chocolate the size of a thumb in my ice cream... and I don't think it was a mistake.\n\nWay to go, you magnificent ice creamiers!
This is the BEST sanctuary on the strip. They have incredible shakes and desserts and the patio is perfect for relaxing and watching the waterfall
best best best! been there a few times and it's always the best i've ever had :)
The food and pastries here were fantastic. The service was very friendly. Their pricing is extremely high and not locals friendly.
Croissant wasn't that good. I like bouchon bakery croissant better. The red velvet taste like chocolate, but the presentation decor of each cupcake is amazing. \nMy fave is the fruit tart.
I came for Sunday brunch.  Nothing stood out.  Food was for the most part over-cooked and not memorable.  Dessert section is ok.  Definitely not worth the price and there are so many better  buffets in Vegas.  Will not be coming back.
Although we typically do not like buffets we tried this, thinking that since it is at the Wynn, it would be good.  The only thing that was half way decent was the pastries.  Everything else was typical dry, cold, and crappy buffet food.
The best Buffet on the strip, pricey but you pay for what you get and the food is top shelf, chefs are top shelf, waite staff outstanding.  You expect the best from this place this was a very enjoyable experience.
To be honest, I was disappointed. Maybe because I have high expectation since the lines are so long and waiting time is miserable. \n\nThe environment is nice but the choices are too limited. Some food are really salty.\n\nWill not eat again next time.
i may know how magnets work but...\ntex tubb's queso?\n\nSHIT IS MAGICAL.
I like the reasonably priced, reliable and tasty black bean burrito (the \"Wilmar\") with its fresh avocado inside.  Too much noise and hubbub though to eat it there during the rush- better as take out.
Oh now they've done it; added live music on select weekends! I didn't think it could get any better but it did (-:
I had a very good experience at Fix. I had the Ribeye steak and fries which was excellent. The atmosphere was upbeat and the staff was attentive and friendly.
Didn't get a chance to eat just had a couple drinks l.. really cool laid back feel. I think the whole design and the lighting. Service was really good. Will come back soon to check out the food.
Great atmosphere! I love to sit at the bar and order nachos or enchiladas and hang out with my husband. The service and food are good.
went for dim sum last summer after graduation MEDICORE! it was not that good at all
Bad service. OK food. Overpriced prices (but hey, its Vegas). I like the decor but a 20 minute meal took an hour because the waitstaff was so inattentive.
Excellent food and service.  Only mistake chef made was there was a piece of plastic paper slipped into the coffe from the kitchen.  Manager apologized and gave us free dessert. However, it was pretty dangerous that we almost drank in that plastic paper..
What a shame the groupon was the only reason I give it a star to begin with.  The meal cost us nothing but the food was worth nothing to begin with. \n\nThere was no flavor to the sushi and the service was poor.
good food. Great service but i'm still hungry after$ 60..\nI would go back. But not when i'm really hungry.
Super fun!  Great people watching!  Very nice and attentive staff.  Drinks were good, looked like the food was too!    Like I mentioned AMAZING people watching here.  \n\nIt's definitely an adult pool, no kids at all.
Fabulous Sunday Brunch! The staff was friendly and attentive (although our server disappeared for long periods of time).  Great experience and I would definitely go back. Request to sit inside on particularly hot days.
Wow what a quiet hidden gem in the middle of a loud casino. Food, service, outdoor patio all A++ amazing place for lunch on the patio overlooking golf course and waterfall.
When I got to this place I was super stoked, the ambiance was amazing, service for sure is excellent. Food ? Outback is better not worth 100 buckaroos  per plate :) hey but I heard brunch is really good here I'll try it sometime:)
Overpriced sushi that's average. Drinks are decent but also pricey.
Stoles it! I got the coconut shrimp which was amazing. The shrimp is huge! And I had the lobster, shrimp and crab sandwich which was awesome. However, the fries that went with it were average.
Always have had good experiences at Prime.  They have high quality meats and good service.
standard typical hotel cafe fare. nothing to write home about really. caution: the juice is $5.50/glass. you've been warned.
Like an Ihop or Denny's inside Monte Carlo, but not as good. Not expensive, but we should of went to the food court that was around the corner, better price and probably more appetizing.
The Bartender was rude and if I wasn't with my family I would have thrown my drink in his face.\nActually I wanted to do a lot more, but i figured a true review would hurt them most.  DONT GO!
First time visit. Great view of strip at table. Wonderful atmosphere. Great food. Good prices. Great service.
Nice place for a lunch if you're in Fashion Show and don't want standard food-court food.
I would give this place 3.5 star rating if I could. Above average quality for buffet. Lots of choices, and even they had a lot of choices of asian food and dessert. Not worth the 1.5 hours waiting though, imo.
One star for the gelato. The rest of the food was not good and the RIo hotel is in bad shape. It was recommended by Worldmark, and I am unsure why. We went on 7/6 for breakfast and there was no line at all. No wonder...
They have a good selection. Servers are friendly. Food is great except the limited selection for desserts. The last time I went there, the servers at the dessert section were chit-chatting. They know people were waiting but acted like they didn't noticed.
Everytime I go here it seems the food gets worse and the price gets higher. I'm pretty certain this will have been my last trip to the Ihop chain.
Delish! I really liked this Chelsea's we ate on the patio and it was beautiful. The food was really good I had the fillet tacos and they were perfect! The key lime pie was the best I've ever had and the service was great!
Rude staff... Way over prized. Spent $60 on two drinks and two servings....
Use to come here all the time! What happened? Very rude staff. Sat inside dust all over every where lamps etc. food does not carry the same quality! Sad to experience this... NEVER COMING BACK!!!!!
Went herewith my friends and had the lunch buffet. Very limited choices. Only chicken and vegetarian. Naan was crispy...not much more to say.
Wait, you're shitting me, right?  35mins+ wait in the hot sun to eat bacon and eggs?  No way.
way overrated! bathroom in the kitchen, gross!  know what you're eating!  how much was the oj again?
Love their cheeseburger, can tell it's real meat no 90% fillers! Hotcakes, real maple syrup and best bacon ever! Do expect about 1 to 1hr1/2 wait but totally worth it!
Long wait (40 minutes) on a Friday morning. Guess it's due to limited seating capacity. But the Five Spot and home fries were delicious!
Finally got something I've never had at this place: Good service....obviously a Phoenix landmark that should be visited by all at least once, but new location loses some of the old charm.  Limited menu, but pretty good...expect a long line...
We have friends who rave about mu shu. We like it, but not enough to make it regular, and we live just a few blocks away. Price/value is measured in pounds. Friendly service, still it's cafeteria quality
Came in at lunchtime, first thing very noisy! Margarita was good if you want tacos go to filobertos . Enjoyed the carne asada lunch bit was lacking that certain something overall good service food was good but not fantastic
I love SB.  I eat there at least once a week and find that the menu has a good variety.  I like the daily menu with different seafood items.  Jessica is the best!!
Rosie's is mine and my sister's go to beer place. It is conveniently close and just very cozy. I always get the Magner's Cider which is so damn delicious, and Wenesday's live performer is always so delightful to listen to.
Great authentic Irish Pub not a chain just a real Irish Pub, Great food, music and people.  This is a sure thing to bring out of town guests, family and to celebrate your life. Great memories here for sure.
I had the pastrami reuben, it was super delicious. The Nachos are definitely a must have as well!  It has a great atmosphere and the service was perfect! Can't wait to go again!
Overpriced.\n\nI spent about $300 on bra, underwear, garter, and stockings.\n\nIf you have boobs bigger than a C, don't expect to find your size.
Worst ted baker shopping experience ever, there's a sales guy with weird hair, he is super rude!
Seems to want to be O. But it did have good effects, music and talented artists. However, the actual story is lacking coherency and things aren't as stemless as a Cirque show.
Sat in the front row, Got wet and watched a pretty cool show. Its all mostly in water which felt kinda repetitive but still kept me interested throughout. Worth the watch but definately not for the money. Seen better for less.
This performance was on par I think to  Michael Jackson's Cirque show and much more artsy. I like the small venue and the Greek Theatre layout as well.
I agree with generally everyone:\n\nHummus, good.\n\nDrink prices and ingredients, confusing.\n\nWaitresses, awful.\n\nPotential, there.\n\nMusic, awesome.
Great place to grab a few beers with the friends. Awesome energy. Love going there!
Excellent food! Excellent service and great ambience. Will definitely come back on my next trip to Arizona
We enjoyed this buffet. It was a little too pricey considering the Bellagio (which is awesome) is only a few dollars more. But there was quite a variety of items, and staff were pleasant. Not sure if I would return with all the other options on the strip.
Yes, please!\n\nLove In & Out. \n\n#2 Animal Style is like sex.
I love Lisa's Bowl of Balls.  It is a very yummy and satisfying dish.  I go to Lisa G's just for her meatballs when I'm craving meat.  I highly recommend this dish.
It's a lounge. They serve alcohol. They play music. Simple.\n\nNothing to compliment it on. And nothing to complain about. Average.\n\nGreat for older people, I guess.
Fresh shrimp, crab legs to enjoy. Prime Ribs & Leg of lamb on carving table. Many different other dishes. A lot of desserts, including crepes made to order. Weekday price is more worth it.
I had higher expectations for this buffet.  I will say that it was just OK.  The crepes for breakfast were pretty good, and they did OK for dinner.  But it's not the best in Vegas.  Some dishes were hit or miss.
Not a lot of selection. The food sucks.
Crepes station is top notch. Seafood was okay.  Kind of worn down in the last 5 years. A deep cleaning would be great for this whole seating area. Probibly backstage too.
We came to Vegas on a very small budget. We got the buffet of buffets deal and ate at le village, it was lovely. The decor was beautiful and the food was outstanding. We even decided to return for dinner. Very pleased with the entire experience.
Get ready to wait for an hour just to sit down and eat, the service is horrible the buffet looks is half empty but for some reason it takes forever to be seated
We got there late at 9 am.  Such A LONG line, but there were tons of tables so I don't understand.  Waited thirty minutes and left.  It was 11/11/13 .  I'll use open table next time.
W & K is my go-to place for Chinese.  Great chow at a cheap price.  The sushi is very good, and inexpensive.  I love this place!
Complete assholes. Nuff said
The food was good but the waiter over sold the dish.  It was good but the way the waiter talked about the food was over rated.
Love the stuffed chicken wings and the rice combo plate as well as the pho!
Great food. Great beer. Great service. Great atmosphere.
Good food, great service, fun atmosphere. Fabulous beer selection. Need I say more?
Great flavor in the Kansas City beef ribs, but unfortunately the inside was cold... Makes me wonder if they just reheat everything... Brisket was good and with the 3-4 different BBQ sauces you'll find a flavor that suits your tastes.
Pretty good BBQ,  pulled turkey was a little dry but the green been casserole and the mac and cheese redeemed it for 3 stars. The ambiance is cool so i would still definitely come back. Live music outside is a huge plus.
Best collard greens I've ever had with BBQ to match. $3 pints of ANY BEER on Mondays. Super friendly wait staff. I'm definitely coming back here next time I'm in the area.
Great food - especially the grilled meats.  Try the Chicken BBQ, Pork BBQ or Galbi.  Remember to grab some of the free soup, it's always yummy.  The owners are very nice people and the food is consistently good.
It was nice. The cashier was chipper. The food was just like the L&L in Oahu. Wish they would crank the A/C a little more though.\n\nRestroom was a little dirty.
Decent business hotel and well off the strip--quiet. Staff were helpful and the place was clean.
It's OK food - nothing extraordinary.  The pricing, I thought, was a bit off given the quality of food/service.\n\nThe menu is pretty concise and to-the-point.  Very American palette-friendly.
Im a fan of good chinese. i must say the wonton soup was loaded with big fat wontons 8 of them and the pan fried noode dish with chicken was awesome.. i went twice.. Worth every penny!
the food was alright but definitely cost more than it should.  we went for a quick lunch and the service was alright too but the food was not up to par with your typical vegas food.  btw don't get the kim chee, not good.
Really good Chinese food.  The duck and pork noodle soup is awesome.  Portions are not that generous so be advised but worth it for Chinese hotel strip food.
Chive dumplings were ok. Fried rice was bland and too greasy, beef stew was alright, and the chicken ginger noodle soup was very bland and chicken was too dry.
It's cracker barrel... it will be just like any other cracker barrel you've been too. Big country breakfasts, down home cooking, you know the drill. It's not fancy but its dependable.
Its ok. I just expected better. food was microwaved and flavorless.
Food was so-so. Service was so-so. Location was noisy, but then again it's the Paris Hotel in Vegas.\n\nWould I recommend it? If you can't get into another place, yes. Otherwise, it's nothing special, really.
We had the lunch menu and it was great .I am sure I will be back next time in Vegas .
Service was great.  This price for dim sum at this place is the cheapest.  My favorites were  the tripe and the chicken feet.  Would definitely come here again.
Great food, great service, nice ambience, and reasonable prices (for the Strip). So far, this is the best Chinese restaurant I've found on the strip in a resort.
I like this place!! I thought the food was fresh and service was great!!  I don't think the price was really that bad if you compare it to other hotels restaurants.  The place looked cool too
Turns out eating here, appropriately, is a crap game. Food always OK To good. Service, you need to bring your luck.
Slimy noodles and lots of dim sum. Crowded, noisy, mediocre service. Very forgettable. It was so bad we went to the chocolate place at Bellagio afterward to recover.
Not for anyone looking for authentic Chinese food. I would go for the location if staying in Bellagio. Otherwise, it's overpriced and the poor quality does not deserve it.
Deelicious, reasonably priced, and excellent service.  I would go back in a heartbeat, and gladly recommend this restaurant.
Excellent service. Noodles were perfect however the flavor was nonexistent. Very nice staff and decent prices considering the location.  I don't think I would come back again but I am glad that I tried it.
Convenient location. Pork barbecue: Tasty. St. Louis ribs. Sauce: Tangy.
Excellent quality food all around and a friendly eager to please staff make for one of the better breakfast experiences in Mesa. The decor here is a little old fashioned - kinda feels like having breakfast in Kansas :)
We have lived here for almost 5 years and we just found this place!  We are always on the hunt for a great bfast place.   I
Crab omelet? More like imitation crab meat which is really just a mix of various extra fish parts, processed and flavored like crab. When will restaurants be honest about what they serve? Its just sad.
The service of our waitress was very rude and not professional.  Sat for 20min never came back to take our order. Food didn't taste good. It was too salty.
Bad food. Bad service. Bad drinks. I guess we caught our server on an off night, but the next day we ate here again after leaving the pool and the food was even worse than the night before.
Way to expensive for what you get. Glad I bought a groupon for this place. The food is way to much for what you get. The atmosphere was alright but nothing to write home to mom about.
Had the King crab legs--hard to give it anything but 5 stars, but it was pricey.  It's a great restaurant, but in a town of great restaurants, it's 4 stars.
Outstanding Chinese in the wasteland of central Illinois. Get the salt and pepper chicken. This place appears to be hardcore, no whities while I dined. The menu has a special section only in Chinese. Strange sign on the wall says: Please clean your table for the next customer.
Delicious after dinner cocktails. White Chocolate martinis, caramel and coffee deliciousness. Kinda pricey, but yummy.
Food: excellent\nService: good\nDecor: tasteful\n\nMy only complaint was the music was so loud we had to yell in order to hear each other. It really ruined the experience.
Horrible!!!   Don't bother
I love sitting at the bar, it's a wonderful experience.  The food was delicious and the execution was right on.  I wasn't crazy about every dish, but I was able to appreciate the skill that was involved with everything.  It's a pricey restaurant, but worth a visit.
Slow service and 15-20 for mediocre philly cheese steaks.  Sandwiches and fries do not have a lot of flavor.  Also the televisions are blaring loud, if you have sensitive hearing beware.  Seating is limited.
Had their Kalbi Tang.  Good quality, not very greasy like I've had at other restaurants.  Good Banchan.\n\nLooked to be a bit pricey on their BBQ menu, but good quality and close to TI.
From being greeted at the door by the owner to the kind and gentle attention one seated the experience and ambiance matched the excellent quality ingredients of the food.  Great value for the money.  Recommend come early evening or very late night.  The place is packed with locals and tourist.
Great little coffeeshop and Italian bakery. Good place to sit and peoplewatch. Pizza place in the back looks delicious and inexpensive.
I had a strawberry cream puff and it was stale. It tasted like it had been sitting in the case for about 12 hours, which I'm guessing it had. I was very disappointed.
The best part of our meal was the fruit fly I accidentally consumed while drinking my wine. Second best was the \"cheddar smashed potatoes\" from a box. Third was the steak. Pictures and further comments available upon request.
I love my wet and sloppy ribs!
Love this place! Great biscuits to start, drinks in mason jars, staff is friendly, and the food is good!
Deelish BBQ. If you are craving tasty cooked meat, and sides of comfort, go here. Lucille's has a lively atmosphere and an extensive menu. Their location is convenient.
The pork was dry to me but my husband loved it when i brought it home as a left over...
This outlet SUCKS.  The only store worth visiting is the Nike Outlet.  That's it.  Don't waste your time here.
Let's go SHOPPING! ^_^  Compared to the Charleston outlets these are more up my alley (read: typical Joe Shmoe) with some haute shops sprinkled in.  Plus it has the Lane Bryant outlet for my fellow big girls!
I have to admit, I thought it was going to be better. At its price it's good,but paying a few dollars more gets you better Indian in PGH. Sweet woman owns and operates the store. But please try it and give her some support
Over Rated FOOD!!! This place needs a good chef.. I don't plan on dining here again.  Pasta is so cheap but why charge ridiculous amount of money?
Wife and I were there about a month a go for our anniversary and let me tell you the food was great amazing service our waitress that day was Courtney and she was incredible nice really enjoy our time thanks for the great service we were there on 04 24 2014 thanks again for the great food and service
A new experience, in the end it was nasty, sauces were bland, and had massive diarrhea after wards. \n\nRATING: GARBAGE!
high quality food (no msg) , healthy, quick, tons of food, inexpensive and always left with leftovers
I've got at least thirty people hooked on ycs! They need to come to phoenix the foods worth my hour drive but, I hate the expensive gas
A little pricy but you build your own meal.  It tastes as good as you make it.
This place is disgusting. It tastes like they soak everything in margarine. Avoid at all costs.
While I definitely agree with the reviews that say the matzo ball sucks, I still enjoy the large portions and generally good sandwiches here.  I usually go here after work (11pm or so) when there's no line or anything so its fine.
wow has this place went down hill. the service and wait staff is an absolute joke. the food has went down hill. just horrible... horrible
So be warned, this place only has pizza to eat, nothing else. But the pizza is great! New York style, thin crust which is my preference. And if you don't want it too greasy avoid adding meats to it. Just stick with cheese.
Its pretty good Pho in a nice quiet location, Charming.
So while I was at this club, one of the security guards who must have been in a bad mood on this night said \"stop dancing before I step on your face\"... Customer service in VIP at its best.
Worse club ever. They advetisted  free drinks for ladies but was not true then once got inside there was nobody in there. Dance floor was empty.  Go somewhere else
By far the slowest Jiffy Lube I have ever stopped at. Thought I would be in and out in a few minutes because no one was in front if me but it took over an hour.
This place is prettty large and awesome. A wide variety of organized items. Video games, current magazines, books, and board games are a plenty. Staff is friendly.
Do not purchase video games here! Used games are ridiculously overpriced selling for more than double the price of new.
Plan ahead keep an eye on there web site family fun projects always happening helpful staff they can always direct you right were you need to be good half day with the kids on weekend project days
We went there for happy hour. The service was super slow and it was not even busy. The food was ok.
ABSOLUTE FAVORITE STEAK HOUSE OF ALL TIME!\nAmazing steaks! Extremly intresting and delicious appetizers and desserts!\nVERY EXPENSIVE!
Excellent food. Warmly lit low light ambiance and good background music. Unfriendly hostess, but waitstaff was on point. Felt decadent to be there and we'll try it again.
Oysters good. Chicken was smelly. Adult tater tots good. Took our servicer for.ever. to split our checks. Mediocre across the board.
Super quick for takeout, with a variety of Asian fusion options. The food is so-so, but satisfies if you need a quick fix in a hurry!
This place is cool and jukebox is great but the bartenders are all facing premature mid-life crisis. The only friendly bartender is the girl whom I wish would be there more often.
this place isnt bad but its not really good either. (food wise)\n\nThey have dim sum all day, and the prices are cheap so that is good.\n\nBut i won't come here again. Straight up.
Went for dim sum.  It was moderately busy, but the carts came around often.  The food was decent and the staff friendly.
Dim sum is just not good in Vegas. I would not come here again, but then again I probably won't ever get dim sum when I'm in vegas. \n\nThis place is dirty and not authentic.
Friendly. I luv their coconut bun
Meh. Okay food. Three stars because I was hugely disgusted by my water. Check then picture I added.
Nice Prices, Good Food, Okay Service...It was a nice place to have brunch at with my girls. It was new to me. Dim Sum was awesome and all the other foods were good. I would go back again.
Went here with family. \nVery busy restaurant, the food was decent, nothing special.\nCustomer service was ok, some were rude.\nPineapple buns are bomb!\nThe parking sucked.
This is just an OK dim sum place who's saving grace is that they serve dim sum all day/night with a limited selection during off peak hours. Go to Ping Pang Pong instead unless you're craving shu mai at 10 pm.
Eh, it was ok. I think Circus Circus needs to remodel this place. Haven't been here in years and it looks the same.  My son had a blast so that's all the matters.
Had to meet a client here for a quick cocktail before dinner. Being in the Four Seasons, it's a very quiet location; perfect for uninterrupted discussions. The service was excellent; our waiter was constantly available without being a nuisance.
Above average breakfast/brunch buffet, but then it would be for $36 per person.
Yogurt and Granola Yuck and Coffee sucks.  Along with their cappuccinos.  Otherwise , it is great.  Bagel and Lox are great and so is the Omelet.
great concert venue!
I felt that this little aquarium was overpriced. If you've ever been to a good aquarium, you'll be disappointed. They do a nice job with what they have, but it's not all that much and it's not that impressive.
Very disappointed with my visit here was definitely not worth the time and money... I did however purchase the 3 for $57 so we chose this the Secret Garden at mirage and Bodies the exhibition at Luxor which in my opinion was the best of the 3!
Nice place for the family to discover the wonders of the sea. An hour is about the time you need to get around the place.
Really awesome place! They have a variety of fishes and animals. Also, there is a spot where you can pet sting rays which is pretty cool. I reccomend this for little kids and children, they'll love it!
Visited the aquarium sinve it was on the 10 must do things while in vegas. Nice aquarium but not everything advertised was available. An interesting place to visit but I'm not sure it's a must see if you are in vegas
My friend and I could NOT get to this coaster! Haha and we were sober! Staff was pointing us in all different directions. It looked so fun.
It's something you should do upon your first visit to Las Vegas and not to be done again. For $14, I expect to get a free picture at least!
One of my favorite omlettes of all time. Solid cup of coffee, good ambiance, and we sat in what would otherwise have been the window dressing area had it been a retail store. Great breakfast place, be sure to stop in!
Ehh. Nothing to write home about. Good service. Food just average. Unless you are a veggie loving hipster, this place is not worth the 2+ hr wait. Save yourself the trouble and disappointment and cross Butler St to Franktuary.
The only record store in Vegas left that I will shop at now that Big B's Cds & Records - CLOSED!
Originally the food was awesome but it has steadily gone down hill.  The breakfast gig they were doing was great but it's inconsistent on when they actually open.  Showed up at 930am and still were not open.
Food tasty and generous and also a bit on the pricey side.
OK\nYou must go there, if only for the CHICKEN FRIED STEAK.\nI can't imagine it being any better
Horrible experience. Bacon...cold and old.  Pancakes dense and hard.  Potatoes deep fried and extremely salty. Please go somewhere else. Their food is NOT good.
I love this place!!! Best vegetarian eggs Benedict, and I've always had good service.
Good breakfast spot! Our waitress was Stacie and she was awesome!! Definitely try the banana nut french toast and the egg-cellent omelet... sooooooooo worth it and it'll feed 2 people no problem!
Just finished breakfast Amanda are service was fantastic!   We sat outside enjoyed the nice weather and savored out banana nut muffin!!
We loved our breakfast.  Bacon avocado omelet and carnitas pork skillet.   Great service by all the staff.   We will be back next time we are in town.
Went for lunch and the service was great. We got the lunch specials and the food was delicious! Food came out fast. I will definitely go back.
Good and dependable family pizza spot! Come here often carry out and eat in with family of kids. Great service and food. Try the buffalo bites if you are skipping your diet!
Great food, great staff that will make anything you want.  All chicken dishes can be ordered as white meat only.
We used to frequent the restaurant. Recently, the food quality and flavors changed. Not sure if there is a new cook, management or something else. So sad about that!! Used to be such a great place to get delicious take out or dine in Chinese food.
Good show since tickets were free however had I paid a lot of money I would have been disappointed. Needs way more animal skits and on more than one occasion there was screw ups. Piers Morgan would have hit the X button.
Disappointing show after waiting over an hour to get in.  Ushers don't care if you came early for better seating as the sales agent suggested.  There is NO choice in seating.  You have to sit where they place you.  Save your money for a better show with assigned seating.
Solid.  In and out in 45 minutes with a full stomach and not too much damage to the wallet.  \n\nNice staff and good service.
Worst food, and worst service.  Will never go back to Red Robin.  Do not waste your time and money.  It is horrible.
Bojangles used to be some of the best chicken in Charlotte, well I see a lot have changed- JJ's Fish is much better
Lobster Pot-Pie was not great. The lobster was over cooked and chewy. It really had no flavor. I've had much better lobster at Red Lobster. It really was disappointing especially for $85.
Food was very good, waiter (Chris) provided excellent service.  They did sit us on temporary chairs (by the kitchen too) though.\n\nNot much use even posting this because they are closing soon.
Sad to hear its closing. Was very nice.
Still a bit in the middle on this place.  Fairly pricey for good food.... UNLESS you catch the \"Happy Hour\" in which there are some deals to be had.
Awful. Nothing positive to say. Stay far, far away!
Slow service, weak margaritas and stale chips. Not coming back.
I'll leave one star just bc the waitress was nice. But seriously it has to be hard to make food taste that bland and unflavorful. It was horrible
Basic breakfast.. nothing really spectacular or bad.. just so so.. the walnut pastry was kind of dry and the service was rushed and disinterested.
My friends and I all ordered breakfast. The food was mediocre but edible. However, I was not satisfied. If I am going to pay $17 for eggs benedict, I expect it to be above average. In this case, it was just meh.
It wasn't what I expected going in but I had fun.  An hour is more than enough...especially for someone that NEVER works out!  WHEW!
I tried this place twice because it was very different.  It is different but that's it.  The place doesn't have much else going for it.
It was ok. It is like someone who is drunk and this is what the craved for munchies. They combined a Panda Express with a Taco Bell into one dish. Also the fried rice was terrible
Average food.  Great concept and enjoyed my first visit.  However, the only really good item is the Red Jade Chicken.
A great place to go if someone else is paying. Great sea food, excellent decor and if you reserve, a view of lake Monona.
The Wor Wonton Soup comes in a big container and has a flavorful broth, crisp veggies, lots of wontons and meat.  It is great with chili sauce in it.  I've heard the Peking Duck is great, but have yet to try it.
I spent 5 weeks out of the country and the first place I spent money upon my return is this home away from home. It's a great location, yummy products, priced right, and a fabulous staff!
The atmosphere was really nice. Love the outdoor patio with the metal art and concrete/bottle table. Nice change from the chain coffee shop. Customers very friendly and talkative. My drink tasted yummy but it wasn't frozen enough otherwise I'd give them 5 stars.
The cheeseburgers were nasty.  When our food was delivered the hamburgers were gray in color and they tasted soggy and flavorless.  Do not waste your money here.
Great burgers and sandwiches. Had the pastrami burger with sweet potato fries this time. Service was good and it didn't take long for our food to come out.
eh.... ok food.  Under staffed, slow, but friendly service.
Typical Vegas cafe.  Nothing out of the ordinary except for our server Bobbie Jean.  She was super courteous, attentive, and sweet.  All servers should follow her example.
Place was filled with employees but not many tables, the. Employees just standing around, not really attending the customers.
This location has moved and changed names. It is now called Sid's Cafe and is in the casino.
Have to try the brisket and the donuts.
This place is great! Meat falls off the bone and the mac n cheese and mashed potatoes are so yummy!
Great service, great drinks always at a good price music is cool.... but the main attraction.... THE TACOS!
Happy Hour is fun!  Great food and drink specials!
That place it's bad and overpriced \nDon't waste you money and time!
I love this restaurant. It has great ambience and the food is wonderful. I particularly love the guacummus (guacamole hummus) sliders. It's a great place to meet friends and colleagues.
Bluecorn enchiladas were fantastic.\nYou pay for chips and salsa that are supposed to be made when ordered but mine weren't. Pricey but good.
I love this place! The pork green chili Mac n cheese is so good I dream about it! Mojitos are awesome made by the guy bartender who is super friendly and sweet! We always sit at the bar! Just a really cool place to have some really good food!
It's a Starbucks....\n\nEach gate section has one on the secure side.  At some gates it is centered (like A) it is located at the split.  With the C gates it is only located in one section of the C gates.
I am a fan because they do not price gouge.\nThe price of a cup of coffee is the same at the airport\nas it is outside at any other Starbucks.\n\nKudos to Starbucks.
Tried Petrossian Bar twice during my recent trip. It's an excellent place to sit, relax, have a drink, and people watch. You can play spot the prostitute. :) Their Red Ruby drink was delicious.
I don't know why this place has low ratings, its good for a franchise restaurant, and way better than Olive Garden on sunset. Decent service and the food is always on point.
The service was great and the server was informative and amusingly enthusastic about the food, especially the appetizers.  For a fancy place the prices were unexpected, meaning lower than I expected due to the fanciness.  ie - dry aged steak for $25
Excellent food and excellent service.  The manager Kristen was awesome and so was our server Jeff. I highly recommend this restaurant for dinner.
The barbecue was good but not great. They do have a nice selection of barbecue sauces. The complimentary kettle chips were a nice touch. On the plus side, the food came lightning fast.
We were exploring the city and decided to stop in...we opted for the roof top seating and loved it.  Food, service and drinks were all GREAT!!!  The roof top seating was fun!!!  It was a great time!
I haven't tried many items or the lunch buffet yet, but from whatever I've had here, I would say its a decent option for Indian food. Being a vegetarian, its a nice thing to know that there is no chance of meat ending up in my food.
Breakfast buffet was decent. Food quality was average and so was service.
Decent breakfast buffet. I liked the omelet station. Some stuff was fresh and others tasted like they had been out a while. But decent selection for $15. Ours was free with our hotel stay.
Since the owner offered to make it right I have improved my rating based on his interest in customer happiness, I always try to be fair.
Always good. And they reopened. Much better. Diver's Scallops and chick peas. Who would have thought. But they were great. My girls Loved the cheese pizza. Truth be told I thought it was quite good as well.
I love this location! Wow, you cant go wrong with anything you order here. love it!
Now this airport Is much nicer. Not perfect, but much better than one in Texas Huston. \n\nPeople are welcoming. All is good. A lot stores and restaurants. I love to shop while I'm waiting for my flight. So it's all good.
Breakfast was surprisingly good! Salsa had fresh cilantro and lime. Wait staff were friendly and responsive. All good.
three-and-a-half star food at five star prices. it's not a *terrible* place, but you can find better food at better prices elsewhere on the strip. keep looking.
the house made ginger drink is as good as we heard
Do they really need another review. They are awesome, you should eat  here.
Awesome stadium. Bars everywhere, it's impossible not to get a beer. I had a full scale bar right outside my section. As far as the seats go, pretty nice view. You get almost a good view anywhere you sit. Cup holders FTW.
A decade later, it's just not the same....maybe I'm just older now. Maybe it's the crowd? Eh, whatever it was or IS, it's just not the place for me.
The food was pretty good. The service was pretty good. The problem was that it didn't really fit the Bellagio feel, it was like a straight up diner (not a cafe) in a fancy hotel.\n\nExpect a diner, not a cafe.
Waited an hour for a cold $15 burger when I got back the second time it was warm but not worth waiting for!
Not impressed. Decor is nice but that's about it. Waited to be seated, waited to have order taken, waited for food the came out undercooked and wrong. Expensive. I do not recommend.
I ordered 3 eggs and bacon * includes three pieces of bacon that didn't look very appetizing and cold toast I expected better from Bellagio I have has better bacon at Mom and Pop places..\n.
Took 30 minutes for a beer however the burger was excellent!  Staff was very friendly and apologized for the delayed beer and was very good about recovering from the mishap.  We came back the following morning for breakfast.  Again slow service and a slightly less friendly staff.  Oh well.
Save your money and eat a hot dog while watching the game.
Went to an event there last evening, their walu is to die for, fresh and delicious, not to mention their selections of different maitais, i will definitely suggest this place for an evening night out for happy hour.
The end is near. Went for one last hurrah before closing.  Love westroc and their products but the thrill is gone from tv.
White guilt told me this was some kind of racial slur against chinese people. Yelp told me it was actually a killer chinese restaurant. Yelp was right! So so so so good!
Horribly overpriced, but on Mondays the specials are a good buy and a delight of variety.  I won't come any other day of the week, but on Monday this place is a go-to-spot for sushi.  Good service but occasionally a little slow.
This macy's has the best selection of Kitchen Accessories. If I need anything Kitchen related this is the place I go.
Ah best food! Pizza is amazing, salads are to die for and dessert is heavenly! Love the friendly and chill enviorment! Have never ordered anything I did not like!
Takeout was a miserable experience here. We were told 20-25 minutes for our pizza and it took an hour and a half. We were charged a service and delivery fee online and it was not refunded when we picked our pizza up.
This is my first visit to this location, I have been to other locations and enjoyed the evening. The food was good , however the service was extremely rushed! The appetizer had barely been served when the entree followed. Not a very relaxing evening.
Good spot 1rst time here service was friendly and swift breakfast was affordable turkey link sausage 2 eggs poached hash browns not my fave but I would certainly return for some of the other options
Been here several times for breakfast and lunch.  Great home made food.  Soup is extra good.  Try the chicken salad sand. and potato salad.
Would not recommend. Food was mediocre and service was not great. McDonald is down the road save yourself time and money.
It's diner food for the most part.But I'll take it after a Long night of drinking.
Over priced food. Food was OK. \n\nNothing really speical about it. Maybe just the decorations.
Even for free it stunk.
It's ok inside.  Fried chicken was average and overpriced.\nNot sure why anyone would go here when there are other options near by...it's VEGAS!  Don't do a chain.  Do that in the Midwest.
Yeeeeehawww, well the wait was not worth the food.  Sorry Gilley's
We had lunch here last weekend and the service was slow but we loved the food! We tried the pretzel as an appetizer which came out with two sauces. We also ordered the fried chicken and brisket and they were both very good!
Will never go back again. Absolute worse service I've ever experienced!
Really, better sauce comes in a jar!  No basil on caprese salad, and swimming in dressing.  But what do I know.  Never had caprese salad with dressing.
Great place to get books for a broke college student!  Friendly staff and a great selection.
These Guys just get it right,great burgers straight forward toppings hand cut fries.I've eaten here on more than a few occasions with the family and everyone loves it.Counter service is always polite and expeditious .Enjoy.
This place kicks Candinas' ass by a long shot. Granted, you have to like dark chocolate, complex flavors, and high quality. If you don't value these qualities, go up to the capitol and get some super-sugary nonsense.
finally found a dish i like a bws.  i get the honey mustard salad which is tasty.  since my husband is a fan of bws i'll be back.
I ordered delivery, waited three hours.NO pizza and they wouldn't answer the phone. So I drove there, they told me they didn't open till ten p.m. It's the next day still nothing I had to call delivery.com and cancel my order.
Excellent lunch today for the six of us. The food was delicious and our server was just great. Brisket and pulled pork were both cooked to perfection.
This place was decent when it opened. Now it's not worth eating even if its a comp meal.   Eat at the cafe it's way better
You have to be kidding me.  Possibly the worst food in Vegas.  The only thing fresh was the salad and the horseradish.  Brisket=Leather tough.  Chicken= bla.  Dessert was sad.
Lots of options.  Decent food for the price.  Not remarkable.
Great steak experience! We had an awesome experience with the server last year; this year he's average but the food is a. Ma. Zing as always!
Great food, great server, great restaurant. One of the best experiences while travelling in the US (I am European).
Lily Barajas is an awesome manager!! Just remember it takes time for the great food!!
Definitely worth the watch. We found that they had the understudy performing parts and she often sounded better. Though mostly just a personal preference for voices.
This is the best show Ive ever seen.
This was a great venue for my first concert at the Joint. We saw Prince on Friday night and would see him from the floor and from the suite. What a show!
This is wonderful. We waited about 2 hours to sit, but played the slots and watch the fun music bead throwing going on at the bar! Great place and yummy food. worth the wait!
Very poor value for price paid and when they write fresh fish everyday. They might mean fresh frozen products as most of the dishes are tasteless.\nPlease improve the dessert section too!!\nYou have much better option in Vegas for $50 per person...
Overpriced for breakfast.  \n\nWeird seating arrangement\n.
It's simple people....  If you're in Phoenix, this is the place you must visit.  You won't regret it. Fantastic!
Best beer selection in Champaign. Cool atmosphere too.
Great beer. Great people.
friendly folks and unusual items. I've always found the quality good and the produce fress. I like the dried fruit and nut selection too.
Wow, band start and our server left twenty minutes later.  If you want quality food and any service, AVOID.  You want a bar that is under staffed and has holes in the restroom walls, this is your spot.  Band was great
Solid 4 stars. Good atmosphere, great walking distance to everything, decent parking , fries are amazing, menu has something for everyone. A bit pricey. Sometimes understaffed which causes slow service. But all and all a great place and had nothing but good times.
Nice market for healthy food and meats.  Their meat counter is great and be sure to try one of their many fresh sausages.  Very little fat in them.  Produce is good and prices lower than most super market chains.  They carry a vast selections of health food brands.
Every time we go it gets worse... Barely any steak in my California Burrito along with a tiny amount of pico and soggy fries.
My Filet was good, but when I asked for onions cooked without butter (b/c of a dairy allergy) they said they couldn't do it.
Prime rib special is a steal with soup or salad bar and great desert cherries jubilee is to die for
mediocre food and terrible service
If u come here on grave until 7am ask for Joy...great server....having saimin and Portuguese Sausage and scramble eggs....of course with rice... ono after a night out.
Oxtail soup, oxtail soup, oxtail soup.
Best selection of international specialty foods Las Vegas has to offer. There is not anything you cannot find here! Been coming here for 15 years ... It gets better each and every year.
this place is good for family,  The price is right and they serve good beer.  The food is pretty good four stars are for the service.  I don't like looking over at the kitchen and seeing the cooks eat food while they are cooking so that is why they get one star deduction
I know people love this place.  I can see why some people would really like it. However, it felt like I was in an assembly line. It is a little pricey. There are better places in Charlotte. I think people are just impressed by the free drink.
The mimosa bar on Sundays is tasty and inexpensive. I haven't had the food, but this appears to be a classic sports bar.
Food and service are excellent. Only thing keeping it from 5 stars is price...expect to spend a couple more dollars per dish than other sports bar menus.
Very nice place especially at Caesar's Palace. This was my first time trying dining at a Cheesecake Factory. The menu selection was huge.
Same everywhere. Still classy though. Same price, no happy hour though.
Excellent service, bread was hot and fresh, pizza cooked to perfection and price was very reasonable
Finally authentic Sicilian food in Phoenix. Combine it with great service and it is a classic go to restaurant.  If you haven't been to Tomaso's what are you waiting for!
Delicious Chilean Sebass, excellent Mac n cheese, and a great wine selection but the service.... A little slow
Service a little slow but when I think about the quality it all came together. Great food! Ambience was great for two people, romantic dinner in a both. Menu it's mostly steamed, broiled and fried very little chargrilled items.
Tried the \"All Lump\" crab cake after being assured it was as stated on the menu, no surprise....no lump to be found !!
I HATE IT!!!!!!!\nThey charge you twice the amount, than you would normally pay at the neighborhood corner SB's.\nIt's the same coffee dammit!
CHICKEN AND WAFFLES! you will need to split this unless you are a gluttonous horde (which I can relate :-) ) FANTASTIC!
Would have a had a 5-star if the wait and service was better.\n\nFood is amazing. They deliver on the twisted farm food promise.  \n\nThe fried sage fried chicken and the chicken and waffles were very impressive.
Most vile, disgusting breakfast I've ever had. Shit House a Go-Go is a great big no no. I was so mad when I left at being ripped off by this nasty place. Cold, huge portions of very bad food.
i got the famous andys sage benedict.  it was a little on the bland side, but because the portions are so big and the presentation really makes the atmosphere fun and exciting ill be going back for more..
Hash house a no go!!!      Found 3 out of 3 dishes lacking in flavor.    Huge portions.  Chicken hash was dry, pork Benedict was more country fried slab of over cooked meat.  Bbblt was full of bacon but not flavor.
Great food lots of portion!
Disappointed!! They  forgot I ordered coffee then didn't refill then food was cold.  The two stars is they took my meal off the bill.  Will not return.
Came to Vegas and wanted to try something different other than buffetts. I tried this place and I have to say it was pretty good. The portions are huge, you might want to share. They have a variety of food, and also specialty drinks. Overall everything was good.
OMG huge portions! You definitely should share I ate chicken and waffles which was extremely good my boyfriend ate the famous chicken thing the guy on man vs food ate and the leftovers fed us for 2 days LOL
Love this place!  Huge effing burger for a great price!  Delicious options!
OMG, I am so FULL!  Crab Cake and the ribs are my two favorite apps there! Be sure to try them. \n\nps...don't fill up on the biscuit!
Chicken Benedict is amazing!
WHY do some people recommend this place?  It took a long time to get to order, the4 food was not particularly special nor reasonable, and it was so noisy that we could hardly talk.  NOPE..will not go back there.
Great place, massive portions. Could split one order to 3 every time! Great place to go after marathons :) Yum yum!
I love this place.  When I am hungry and want to grub out I love coming here and getting different dishes.
Average taste, huge portions
Not a huge fan of this place. And Huge is what you get for portions. But each time that I gave this place a shot, no one in our party has been happy with the food. It really is flavorless. I have no plans to ever go back.
After hearing so much about this place, we went to have breakfast there.It is way overrated!!! IHOP's pancakes are way better.
My favorite place to eat in Vegas.  My wife's favorite too!!  We are so happy another one opened around the corner from us, i guess that means I'll have to go to the gym more though.
About as boring a meal as you can get without dozing off into your plate. Bland, plain and tasteless. The only part of the meal with any flavor was the large piece of salty bread. Avoid.
Mmm. Dinner here and it's so good. The chicken sandwich with cane sauce. Get here early cuz they are busy.
Visited the restaurant with a party of six and did make reservations prior. The seafood was okay, my only complaint would be the over cooked lobster. It was over cooked and had that rubbery feel to it. \n\nNot perfect and plainly okay.
I had fun when i went to this club last year!  Didn't have to wait in line at all.... fun times!
The company was much better than the food.  China Panda could give them a run for thier money.
Great food! This is a buffet style restaurant with awesome sushi, king crab legs, and tempura shrimp. The only downside is that they close at strange hours in the middle of the day.
I only went to the target here. Shopping center appeared to be huge.
I have been there a few times. The owner is a gilbert native and a very nice person. The food is of good quality, the atmosphere is great. It is best to visit here during the spring and early summer.
Love the atmosphere, food was okay for a smoked bbq joint.  Brisket decent, ribs and pulled pork were a bit dry and chicken was good... The mac and cheese was delicious!
OK BBQ. Pretty expensive for the serving size.
Good BBQ, good beans, good Mac and cheese! I wish they would have done more with the bread my pulled pork came on. Great atmosphere for a BBQ joint!
Order the ribs only next time
This place is printing money and rightfully so. They simply do a bang up job. Best BBQ in AZ.
Very good vietmanese sandwiches! Good price for a good sized sandwich, I had the grilled pork one. The only downside is the location and all the potholes in the parking lot. Worth the effort though.
Great sandwich. The location is out of the way but I'll go back.
Don't let the appearance fool you, this had good quality sandwiches. Get the grilled pork it's my favorite. really good prices too.
Not a bad joint.  Every time we go into the one at WestGate, it appears empty.\n\nFood is great.  Beer is great.  Menu is diverse.
Overpriced, slow, and undercooked vegetables. The pasta was the only highlight. Good atmosphere.
Food is just good, not great. Vanilla custard French toast is good. Omelets are a little bland. Corn beef hash was sweet and spicy...it is made in house.
Yep, this is one of the best buffet place among a thousand other Vegas casino buffet.   It was cheap as well.  I would come back again :) good food, cheap price, I can't expect more from Vegas buffets :)
Had a scoop of strawberry ice cream here. So good! They had so many other delicious flavors. The lady behind the counter was really nice. I have been here before & the quality of the ice cream is good!
You get what you pay for here. It's cheap so you that's pretty much it. They do have a happy hour but if you eat as much as an adult you might as well do AYCE.
Dolphins do not belong here.
Great experience getting a straight razor shave for the face and head..  Extremely friendly staff knowledgeable..  I will visit this location anytime I'm in town.
Curry is very dry. ordinary taste
This is the place to go for some great atmosphere and drinks the size of your head. They cost a little extra, but just get the double, its worth the jar. Live band and dancers. Great time.
Fun bar! Had live cover band and DJ Friday night. Drinks are light on alcohol.  But band was entertaining.
Group of 8 and had no desire to seat us!! Did not want to let us split up I to 4 and 4. Wanted to put us all on one check!! Not toe room receptionist was pushing 50 in buttless chaps!
I had a awesome time at this club. The wait to get in wasn't too long, the place wasn't overly packed like other Las Vegas Clubs. There is a nice outside area to relax in especially for the Summer Nights!
Poor man's version of Moon. Get ready for crazy pyrotechnics and smoke/fog machines...
The owner at N9ne Steakhouse walked the whole gang into Rain. Thanks for hooking it up. Rain was as spacious as I remembered it. I am not really into the trance scene, so we bounced after 20 mins.
Expensive drinks at $15 each, not great atmosphere since nothing is really exciting about it. Interesting performances hang from the center ring every 30 min of dancers from ropes, etc which added some fun.
I have been here a bunch of times.\nEach time, I don't pay at all.\nI will only come back if I get dragged here again.\nRain is okay, but it is not one of my favorite clubs in Vegas.
The valet service is good but flawed, Sunday wait for your car after checkout was around 30min(as I was told), I waited over an hour because they lost my car and brought it to a different tower
This condo/hotel is okay. Pros: each room has it's own balcony. Con: it's a far ass walk to MGM
Very disappointing! He did a few magics but I really expected him to do more. If you get the ticket more than $40, it is not worth watching. Also, the seats were terrible.
They are closed. New restaurant is Terrace Cafe and it's amazing. Welcome to the hood.
Great place. Friendly/efficient service and delicious food. Got a three combo platter, was plenty of food and was able to take a taco home. Generous amount of chips. Frozen margarita was strong. Definitely going back.
I came here for breakfast and it was delicious. The service is pretty good and the breakfast deal was only $3.49. Bigger portions would be nice though :)
Four Stars for Vegas Breakfast.  Had the Breakfast special.  It was a fantastic bargain for $3.95.  Only a few paces away at the MGM where I was staying and would have paid 3 or 4 times that much.  It was busy, but the staff did well despite being overwhelmed.
Very friendly n the food is pretty good! I use to work near by so my coworker n I hit this place up ordered a gyro n some fries n it was pretty filling. Very tasty plus for the owner being so sweet!!
This place rocks. They saw us on short notice and took care of business. Elvis was amazing. Was worth the trip!
I love their coffee!! Any form of mocha, cappucino, etc. Gimme gimme! Happy happy girl here. They have lovely sandwiches and you know I never got to anything else but do try the high test!
stopped here because we were starvingggg. overpriced. horrible customer service and not so great food. I ordered the cured meat sandwich, it was mediocre and basic nothing special. \ndefinitely wouldnt recommend this place.
Great food. Outside heaters not working!!! Cold!!!
Very nice place, Ate on outdoor patio. Shared a bottle of really good Riesling wine. All the food we had was very good.
Awesome place. Great service, superb food, and fun drinks. What more could you ask for?
The manchego bruschetta was amazing! Would definitely go back to try more if their dishes.
Nice place and very friendly staff. The girl taking my order was really helpful and sweet
Confirm the other posts. Don't waste your time at this rude place. Show up at their ppen time and doors wide open but tell you they are closed and not even an invite to come back. Good to not need the business I guess.
The seafood is excellent!
Great atmosphere & great service by Elizabeth.   \n\nThe food was a little above average.  Nice presentation, just not amazing.
Love this place..
This place was alright, just not what I was hoping for. The curry was a little too soupy for my liking. The customer service was great, we had a really nice waitress but unfortunately I don't think that would be enough for me to want to go back.
Once I loved this restaurant ,\nThis is third time we order vegetarian and they had chicken in it..
The wait staff kept on telling us that the bread was on its way as it was in the oven after a 1/2 hour the bread comes out wrapped in a napking and it was ice cold stale rolls  (we laughed)
Seafood combo pan roast is a must!!  Spicier the better too!
This is my favorite place to eat in Vegas. The long wait in line is oh so worth it. I can not to wait to eat there next week.
In the past I've looked forward to even craved Pho Kim's fare.  Unfortunately, my recent visits have not delivered the consistent quality I've come to expect from this establishment.  I'm beginning to think this place is not what it once was.
Ok food... I wouldnt go back. Not much else to say...
The food was great. The service was terrible.  Waited 30 minutes for our reservation. Finally had to ask then waited 10 minutes to pay the bill finally went up to the front and paid the bill. It is really noisy   If you are looking for quiet and nice look elsewhere
Service was good, and the place was big and clean.  They have so much competition in town, and the food was greatly lacking. Prices were not cheap for the lousy food my group had. I will not be back.
Good American food. Beer is pricey though.
Enjoyed our one night stay while in Scottsdale the night before we attended Eagles game at Cardinal stadium. Great location, spacious rooms, good breakfast and friendly helpful staff. My only complaint was the coffee was weak, almost like dirty water.
Good food, nice prices and friendly people. The place is well staffed although they could do a bit of spring cleaning, my side of the booth was littered with napkins and what not. Surprisingly they have delicious roast beef sliders.
TypicalMexican fare - it was pretty good but nothing special. The pollo fundido was pretty good and the bean burrito seemed pretty well executed but again there a million places like this in Phoenix.
ordered 2 carnita tacos with rice/beans. The food was cold and everything was flavorless. The food was gross and super expensive. Maybe the actual restaurant is better.
Great Mexican restaurant inside Planet Hollywood. Affordable,  a lot of food to share, good guacamole and salsa chips, friendly and fast service.  Nice seating area inside and outside, expectantly view. Over all - super satisfied!!!
Nice club, fun, friendly girls.  If you go, try to find Jade.  She does yoga, so is very flexible. She's a fun time; Let's just say I would be incredibly embarrassed if I were related to her.
Had about as much atmosphere as a walk-in fridge, so we turned around and went to Centurion.\n\nSure the house looks nice from the outside, but inside comfort and vibe did nothing to make us want to stay.
Parisian Macaroon (Red) is very bitter. I don't know if it is because of the dye or the almond flour. I can't finish it ;(\nThe filling is great tho.
Great for either a snack or a full meal. I don't think I'll ever order Nachos anywhere else. The Sopapillas were also standard-setting.
Yep, still darn good.  We ordered take out this week and it was just as good as always.  i wish that I had a Chen & Wok in my hood in Chicago.  Why is their lo mein so much better than everywhere else?
First time I have ever had anything from here. A friend ordered the red velvet bundt cake with cream cheese frosting. The cake itself was delicious, but the frosting was a tad too rich for me. I can't wait to try the other cakes they make.
The buffet is NOT what it used to be :(
I loved the tossed salad. The reason I ate here was because they had sushi...big mistake, it wasn't good at all...but I found other things that I loved. $19.99 lunch buffet and it includes your soda.
pretty good... lots of beautiful women
Overpriced rip off. Its bad enough that they charge $25 for an average weekend lunch buffet, but to throw you out at 3 pm is totally ludicrous.
Went on Valentines day and was major disappointment. Extra long wait for food that was very tasteless. We were shocked. Desert was also a disappointment.
Pretty good food. Large selection. Beer and wine were included which was a nice bonus!
Horrific.  One of the worst buffets I have ever had.  It's like going to a hometown buffet.  Some of the worst food in Vegas.
Typical Vegas bar: Beautiful girls serving expensive drinks.  Happily, however, they don't torture you too much with Beatles music.  It is VERY small and located behind the casino - so don't waste your time if you aren't staying here.
Great place loved all the B-boy events there.\nAll you can drink is lame with all the watered down cheap booze :-/
Love the music here on a Thursday!\n\nAll about the Hip Hop!!\n\nCant wait to dance here again.
Sent back a bloody steak and didnt see it for 30 minutes. desert took another 45 min to get there. Ruined our anniversery dinner, Longest meal I have ever had to sit thru...
One of the places with the best steak and service. My boyfriend took me out for a birthday dinner and I couldn't ask for better service or steak. The lava cake was nothing but a mouthful of delicious chocolate melting in your mouth. Looking forward to come back again sometome.
This was a really great \"old Vegas\" style show. I would recommend and will probably repeat.
Went to an afternoon show with my Dad (he's 76, I'm 52), and we both loved it. Only issue is that there are no servers, just a self-serve bar. Kid-friendly, too.
Very good italian restaurant within Caesar's Palace. We've had dinner here twice and both times were great. Their meatballs are fantastic. The service staff are knowledgable, helpful, and friendly. You can't ask for better.
This place is amazing all the time, everytime! Its one of our favorite stops in vegas and its worth every penny! Service and food always impeccable!
No complaints...ok well maybe one, it has nothing to do with the Spa it was me. I needed more time.
This place back in 2005 was the spot that started it all downtown. Now the last couple years it's been a joke. Drinks suck the crowd is pretty bad too.
The best there is. Simple as that. Period. Full Stop.
Sky high prices, low quality tastes. I guess you can do that when you're located right off the casino floor by the sports book.
Great place fun a fun, social dinner.
Great place! Had a party of 9 a very good place, enthusiastic waiter, food was great. The way the dessert menu is brought out so you see exactly what it's gonna look like before you get it.
Never disappoints!
Food was great and reasonably priced with restaurant.com coupon. I would've gave five stars if the waiter wasn't so cocky and direct.
Small shop in a strip mall.  Bingsoo is so tasty with frozen yogurt!  Owner is very friendly.
I filled my ample belly with OJ, fresh cantaloupe, ambrosia, easy over eggs, corned beef hash and a tiny spoonful of bread pudding.  Overall, I felt this buffet has slipped a notch since our last visit.
Cool Environment.  Expensive Food. Rude Staff.
Horrible service.  Every time we go to the Vig our servers never come by to check up on us. Last time we went, we sat for an entire hour before the server came back again. It's a shame because we really enjoy the atmosphere and the food is pretty good.
I really like the feel of this bar. I'm getting older and don't want the clubby scene of OldTown anymore. The wine selection was wonderful and I find its a nice place to hang out with your significant other or friends. Loved it.
$3 parking fee, and the valet has cones on every space. This is tantamount to a cover charge, and the food isn't THAT good.
Went to Vegas a bit TOO much but I wanted to take my brother there (family trip this time) and it was CLOSED! M&M world is 24 hours (or pretty much 24 hours) but this place was closed by like 4PM...boo!
Nothing special.  CMU's main convenience store.  Better for packaged goods than anything resembling a meal. Nice outdoor seating though.
Food and Service very good.  Ran into a few dishes we were not crazy about, but overall recommended.
This place is horrible!!! Can't believe how they are still open!! We went for RW, and what a waste of money and time!!! The only up side was the service, our waiter was very attentive ... But the food was terrible!!
great place to stay but the valet needs work......an associate by the name \"Craig mertz\" was rude and impolite, someone should teach that kid how to work in the hospitality industry
Food is great but service for food and even drinks takes FOREVER make sure you have No plans the rest if the night when coming here as you will spend most time waiting for service.
This place has great plates, ahhh gotta love the comps ;)\nlol
Ate here because we were at THE Hotel.  The restaurant is right in the lobby nicely done in dark wood and with a view of the passing Vegas crowd.   We had lunch and it was very well done.   The service was a little slow but if I was there I would go back.
I'm not a big fan of cabela's because their prices tend to be pretty high and many of the products they carry are their own brand...so much for variety.  The only things they seem to have a large variety of are fishing poles and guns.
Incredible food, ribs are great! Service is fantastic, I definitely would recommend this place !!!
A go to for a good dinner.  We have been there twice and both times were awesome.  The service was always prompt and courteous.  I have made recommendations to people I know, and have always been thanked after the fact by those who have eaten there.
doesn't matter i what i order, i'm always happy!!!!!!!\nsooo good!!!\ni live on the other side and i dont care the drive!!!!
Very good, but highly overrated.
Fantastic Pizza, wow!\n\nSo good.  Go get some authentic Italian Pizza!
The sandwiches here are very overrated.  All bread, very little meat.  The service is poor.  Take your business elsewhere.
Shrimp is really good, I always get a steak and that's good too. The butter cake is delish but the service isn't friendly and I have came back here multiple times.
Great food and very attentive service. Martinis are always awesome. Next time I may try to save room for one of their desserts.
This is an easy 5 stars. Amazing decor and atmosphere. Great selection and perfectly done steaks. My favorite is the rib eye bone in.
Missing lots of stores, is old looking, disheveled, and dirty. Very crowded despite being horribly cramped and messy. Everything about this mall screams \"don't go here.\" I'd give no stars if I could.
1 star for the fries that keep me coming back like a bad itch. Plus one more for the 24 hour bit - for the pure entertainment watching people passed out over their booth. Awesome.
My favorite place to go to de stress ! The owner \"King\" is a nice guy and really take care of his customers needs. Very reasonable prices and instructors are amazing!
Food taste good.  Portion is very small.  There is almost no service but charge 18% tip - this is not right!!!
JULY 27 2012 people go around in carts or u can order from the menu. The decor is ok. Overall this place is alright the food is not really that great. I would plan not to go to this restaraunt
Horrible place. Not happy about this selection a couple of weeks ago.  The service was horrific.  Rude and impatient staff.  Price is weird and they charge you for everything.  Not recommended at all.
The dim sum here was pretty good,  and the service was relatively friendly.  The location is right in the center of Chinatown.
Ordered dim sum for take out. When I arrived, two of three items were unavailable. I asked for two other substitute items. Also unavailable. Why did you even take my order when you are out of what I asked for?!? Next time, save me a trip.
As a frequent visitor to Las Vegas. I went there last night for the first time saturday 2/5/11. I had an awesome time. Great atmosphere and the drinks were very reasonable for such a hot nightclub. Can't wait to visit again.
Host knows just what customer service is. Friendly and handed us complimentary VIP wristbands.  More mature crowd than other nearby places (which is a good thing). Music is good.
amazing food, i loved the kobe burger, and the lobster mash potatoes. . . everything was well cooked
Had incredible ribeye steak & a Mac n cheese dish.  Perfect!
The duck fat fried French fries come out to start and you know you're in a good place. We tried a few things off the main menu but the Rib cap is seriously the best thing I've ever had.
I used to eat here, the service wasnt so great, seemed like the staff was snooty. I only liked 2 items on the menu. If you want good food with good scenery and nice friendly staff go up the road to twin peaks.
Good wine selection but the dude named Paul asked me if I need wine glasses or am I going to drink it out of the bottle.  Hu!  I have wine glasses thank you.  Rudeness tells me why he hates working here unless it's a bad joke, probably but still inappropriate.
Terrible service. Everyone in our party was forced to order their own entre, even though some of them were not hungry. The entre come with nan. The waiter refused to substitute them with similar priced roti because \"the chef was unwilling\".
Pretty expensive compared to Ghandi's just down the street.  Food was fine, but not wonderful.  A bit nicer ambience than most Indian places
The service is not that good and the food is also not that great
Had the lunch buffet for 14.95. All the basics included. As good as any Indian buffet I've had, and I like to think I've sampled some good ones. Certainly won't find a better deal on the strip for this quality.
Where can you get 20 dolla porridge and wish you were eating all you can eat king crab at Caesars??  \n\nhere.  :(  \n\nwhat was I thinking?
After trying this place for a second time during lunch, I found the food to be considerably better. I didn't order the sushi rolls and instead ordered Kung Pao Chicken and was pleasantly pleased.
I got food poisoning here last week ... and the MGM has been less than helpful in recovering the costs of having to change my travel plans, etc.  I have never been so sick.
Food and service were okay. Among the dishes I ate were sweet & sour soup and tofu with baby bok choy.\n\nThe decor seemed fancy. I liked the jellyfish lights near the entrance and the wood-covered menus.
This place has amazing shabu. The service is amazing and their meat is true quality.\nCan't wait to come back here!
I thought that this store was going to be better than the stores I have been to in California.
Very sad when this place burned down.  Loved their Hawaiian chicken. Looks like they were taken over by some new outfit.
This is an interesting place worth the trip to Tempe. OK food, OK tap, OK service. OK atmosphere. Been back three times so far and will go back again.
Pasties are good, yes? The service at this location blows. Who wants to drive all the way to Mesa, though?
Service was awesome had a waitress that was very attentive and gave great recommendations! Leak soup by far one of the best soups I have ever tried. Very unique food but good
Amazing place.
Gross!
Great Food...best Greek Salad!!  A little small gets crowded fast. Prices  Good !  love the New one in old town Scottsdale
I ordered their cafe latte, it was so plain and no coffee taste at all! Wouldn't visit their store a second time
Wonderful employees
Price was right. Cool concept but I like 5 guys better. What A Burger is my favorite burger, guess you could say I'm old school. In and out was busy and had good service but as for the burger's. A lot of hype.
always good - the perfect junk food fix that really tastes good...my guilty pleasure\n\nthe team here is consistently efficient & friendly
Visited it yesterday. The design inside is pretty simple - feels like aquarium. Sushi are overpriced and not good as expected. Not worth to visit at all.
Great food but not worth the rude and terrible service at the sushi bar.
I enjoy their burger every once in a blue moon.  I love the shakes, and the animal fries are super good!  I'd much rather order animals fries with a hamburger patty on the side.
I ordered the honey hot wings. The wings were nasty. They looked old and did not taste good at all. Sauce was horrible too!
I think the quality of food has declined recently and even got a little sick after eating there last time.  It's too bad because it used to be a great place!
I had a really nice waiter and the food were great! The waiter helped me choose an entree by describing what was in it. He made it sound really good and I ended up getting it. Taste magnificent!
My family and I came here last night to celebrate a birthday. there were 12 of us and we got the  best customer service, the food was hot when it came out. It was a wonderful experience last night.
I keep giving the Grand Cafe a second chance and then I keep regretting it. The service is incredibly slow and the food is only mediocre.
Extremely slow service.... go elsewhere!\n\nQuality of the food wasn't bad but ladies and gentlemen you will have a few birthdays by the time the food comes out.
5/29 - waaaaccckkk!!!! the only thing nice was the view! other than that, crowd was wack! there was no where to sit! small danceflr! thank goodness it was free! Rain is better than this spot.
I've always had good service here, unlike the Tempe location. I've never had to wait and the food is always fresh and yummy. Also... totally saw Dan Majerle waiting for a table there once.
Food was very good with nice size portions.  Wait staff did a great job and owner walked the floor checking and keeping things in order.
The portions are tiny, and the prices are very high. I ordered an orange juice, and received a shot glass of it. After receiving the bill, the OJ was $7 and my bagel was $5. This is the definition of a TOURIST TRAP.
Great food except for the chips.  Kind of disappointed as that is one of those cravings you want satisfied when you eat Mexican.  Service ok, not great.
The casino is old school,and so is thier restarunt,But if your looking to have breakfast you sure cant complain about the food ,or thier prices.
The quality of the food on the happy hour menu has gone down. Ordered the calamari and it came out stale and mostly all batter.
bloody mary, Amir, 70 degrees, Kona and v-land!!!! Perfect!! Great happy hour selection, beautiful outdoor venue, great drinks, delish Pad Tai !!!
Potato latke Rachel is unique and genius. Flavor is excellent and the sandwich melts in your mouth. Reasonable prices and large portions. Great experience!
Good, fresh, tasty, abundant, good value.  Say, \"Hi\", to Micky.
Having a small dogs it's comforting to know they can be off the leash with other small dogs in an open cage area. :)
white chocolate raspberry - ftw!!!!!!!!
These bundt cakes are amazing! Definite must try.
Always hits the spot when your sweet tooth is going Crazy! My favorite the Chocolate Chocolate Chip!!
Nice ambience and delicious food! Its never too crowded and the salmon green curry is amazing... This is my favorite thai place in the area. I wish they delivered during the day though :(
omg what the heck did I do? I came here again by mistake. Ordered the Satay. That is noooo chicken. Again inedible. Well, they haven't gotten any better in 2 years. Jeez I knew this place looked familiar.
Took me 1 hour to get a fish sandwich(they told me it would only take 20 minutes) ridiculous!!!!!!!
So so food...but I liked the patio.  Better food, and cheaper, can be had at Elmers or Filibertos.
Good family dining outside.
Free bean dip and salsa! The chips are hot and fresh. The portions are large so splitting helps to save money. I loved the mango margarita and the ambiance is fun. Great location!
I loved this restaurant. From the ambiance to the menu to the food and especially the check -- huevos ranchero and coffee under $9 -- it was all great. I'll be back.
What a rip off!  Ordered Margarita and they scammed me for premium tequila and when approached...they said too bad you drank it you pay for it!    Too bad restaurants have to price gouge to make their numbers.   I won't be back.
Laid back atmosphere, fresh food, very open seating. Delicious food. Plenty of parking.
basicaly, you get what you pay for.\ni had this the night before we left and i made four bathroom trips on the way home.
its 6 month's later  and i still hate this resturant ... i want my money back plus the day i wasted at the excalibur..... this place is a EPIC FAIL
Very basic and nit very good. plastic scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage...Fruit, cereals, and ughurt...Kind of like a high school cafeteria. Really bad when you compare it to M.
Fine place for any-time beakfast (certainly a step up from Dennys or IHOP). Good omlettes and if you can take the heart-clogging properties, biscuits & gravy. Also serves sandwiches, salads and smoothies.
Have not been there in a while.sorry I came back, Place smell like Pine Sol real bad! Bearly no meat on the Gyro pita no dressing on the Greek salad.
This building itself is just beautiful even if you don't step inside. The reading rooms upstairs look like something from inside a palace or cathedral. The call system for requesting books from the stacks below was way ahead of it's time. Take the time to check this place out.
Went here for happy hour and sat in the cantina, chips and salsa were delivered immediately and were delicious. Our server was kind and on top of it. The meal I got seemed a little over cooked but besides that everything was delicious and their happy hour prices were great.
Great food! Great service! Great atmosphere...99% of the time. The bar can get loud and obnoxious. If the bar is full, avoid it. The dining area is very nice. Order a cheese crisp and a beer. This place does Mexican comfort food right!
I came out from California and was looking  for good Mexican food. What I found was a diamond in the rough. The tacos were great. The staff was on point and did a great job. Will be coming back.
Terrible service terrible food. Huge disappointment. The food is plentiful but nothing special. We'll go back to Arriba.
The interior is phenomenal and the music was great! Get there earlier if you want your conversation to be heard better but still a great place to kickback with friends.
Enjoy this bar very much, always a must hit for at least 2 to 3 drinks, when ever i go downtown this bar is always a bar that i hit. Great spot highly recommended
Cool bar.  Kinda reminds me of this bar in the burbs of Cleveland called Johns Cafe I used to patron everyday!   And I love the indoor fire pits!
Just nothing good to say. Grilled salmon and grilled veggies swimming in oil and the salmon was burnt. Server never ask if ever how it was. I guess I shouldn't leave out that the rice tasted like it had been sitting around in a warmer for days.
Food was great. Service lacking. Sat at sushi bar. Sushi chefs attentive but rest of staff a little amateurish. I would go back but i was dissappointed in overall service
Always fresh and perfectly prepared. This is the only place my husband will take Japanese visitors from out of town. Enough said.
God there's a lot of hookers in Vegas.  This place in particular really seems to ring their bell.\n\nThe standard 15$ cocktail rule applies here, served by either Bartender A: douche bag or Bartender B: ho-bitch.
Such a great experience. I'm always hesitant on someone cutting my hair. Summer was great she did everything I wanted, was very professional. Will definitely be going back to them again.
Sorry ... not impressed with the pizza ... greasy ... could not finish the 1 slice I ordered ... Salad was blah ... free popcorn had no taste, no salt no butter ... blah ... not returning
Amazing food quality- had the Tuna sashimi appetizer- amazingly fresh and wonderful flavors.\nDinner was tilapia- excellent choice and perfect portion size.\nSave room for the cheesecake- it was seriously amazing with the strawberry sauce.
YUM! Nuff Said!
Excellent pulled pork sandwich! 100% pork -no fat! Also very nice French fries. My husband had an Amana blue cheese burger and he loved it also.
The lunch meals are great. I did have a bad experience with the egg foo young... I could not eat it at all.
This restaurant gave me a lovely case of food poisoning.  Need I say more?
Outstanding. Food was great and the service was outstanding too. I had chicken and my wife the spaghetti and meatballs. Both meals were outstanding. Would for sure eat here again. Little pricey but worth it.
felt like it was below quality meat covered with a straight from can type sweet sauce on top
Amazing food! Have been here twice. Very intimate setting, good service & great food. \nGarlic & spinach Nan was so yummy! So is the chicken tiki masala.
The moules frites is the best  hands down. Great ambiance.
Always a great meal. The food is out of this world. One of my fave places in the East End.
We had a second gift certificate to use, so we went back, for lunch this time and stuck to the mainstream of the menu with a pork chimichanga and a pork burrito, both of which were enormous and pretty good.
This is our \"go-to\" place for Mexican. Best taste and by far most authentic around. If you don't like real Mexican food feel free to stop at the taco bell next door.
Dont let the crowd or lack of crowd throw you off they Always serve delicious food as if as you are one of the family, classic food done right.
Phenomenally clean and the staff is beyond helpful.  They pierced my tongue a few months ago, it wasn't cheap but I really would not go elsewhere to have big needles driven through my tongue!
The piercer Kat was awesome and Effie aka stef at the front rocked and recommended some good tattoo places! Great people really quick service and great everything and affordable!
i had alot of fun last time i went there thier lounge room with the dance floor was cool and the security at the casino were frendly i enjoyed myself.
Love this casino resort off the strip! Facilities are topnotch! Even have a tv on the bathtub.
The rooms are great. The pool area is nice. My only complaint is a very high resort fee. Almost $28. I wanted to splurge a little and stay at a nice place but the fee made it not worth it.
Horrible customer service, didn't see anyone winning at all. Total waste of money and we didn't even have fun :-(
If you are Las Vegas bound and want too see the Grand Canyon the best way to go is by Helicopter with my peeps Maverick Helicopters!!! Stamp by \"MrVegasVip\"
I have been to Kincaid's for business and pleasure and all the times I have gone there, its been fantastic, classy, and delicious. Thumbs up!
Great French onion soup and French dip sand
No more than average serve and food quality with above average pricing. This is my second and last visit. They just can't pull off the fine dining restaurant concept.
Great hot chocolate, too & no complaint if you hang out for 2 hours like we did one late nite as did some other group....  The iced huge 32oz drinks are fab when it's hot.
Fresh seafood, attentive staff, and a nice physical layout. \n\nFirst time visit for AYCE lunch. Will be back!
The reviewer who described the pizza as \"tough\" was spot-on. This is literally the worst pizza I have ever had in my entire life. I would rather go hungry than eat Hungry Howie's.
nooooooooooo
Had hungry howies twice and this is really really good pizza for the price.  Out of all the places that deliver in Tempe I think this Is the best. Love their crust- we get the butter cheese and its delicious!  The price is really good and they deliver quickly.
Took my son to Oregano's last night for his birthday. Loved the Guaca-Tony!!!!!!! they gave my son a free pizza cookie for his birthday!! Thanks
Nice little pizza joint. Good pizza but only so so wine. Full bar so beer and mixed drinks available.  Don't go in with high expectations but enjoy the pizza and your company.
Nice little place with great service. Pizza was good. Will go down the menu and give it a go.
The service is great and the food is even better. Doesn't need much more explaining than that!
Chips come w/ salsa and beans. Dont be deceived - the beans are spicier than the salsa. Mix them on your plate = delish. Good, local start Mexican joint.
Totally edible chain restaurant food. Nothing exciting.
Lots of choices on there menu. \nThe grilled veggie appetizer is very good. \nNice place with a different atmosphere than an ordinary restaurant. \nVery friendly staff. \nThey also make there own soda  , which is  tasty.
Fantastic lunch buffett, pizza,  but also great if you just want a great bowl of home made soup and salad!
Should have never changed the recipes. I have been back twice since new ownership. I have to say I will give them one more shot. The place has lost the touch of service that was given. I feel while talking with workers that they can do better since everyone was really nice.
YUMMY!!!! Can't go wrong with Panera. The thing that urks me most is the single door entrance/exit...this place needs double doors with all the people going through it!
Probably the worst chinese I've had in years. Sweet and sour had almost no sauce, and the kung pao chicken tasted like beef stew, not spicy at all. Not worth half what I paid.
Two stars just for the fun of it...  but might be the dirtiest place I've seen...
I've come here a few times, the service is ok but the place itself makes me sick.  They blare the music so loud I became dizzy and got a huge headache.  I wouldn't be coming back here again
Great place to enjoys some pints and catch a game. A lot of floor space and a menu worth checking out. I little on the high side of cost for pub food, but such is expected in Scottsdale.
I go into this sprouts on a regular basis and I have never had a bad experience.
Had chicken tacos for lunch.  It's fast and inexpensive.
nothing good happens at club rehab lol\nHampton Beach NH is the same, just add cocaine and E-junkies make the world go round-keep rollin crackheads
I really enjoy what the Hale Center Theater brings.  I have seen some great performances and have been surprised at how well the scenary is done and the actors perform.  It is definitely worth it.  So happy Gilbert offers this.
Went to see Sound of Music November 29!!.  Absolutely outstanding performances from the whole cast!    Enjoyed this play more than any other I have seen there.  Fantastic! Cudos to all the crew that changes the sets also. I love this theater.
Interesting architecture, but that's all that was interesting about this place. Very college-pub atmosphere with not a whole lot interesting beer..
If you are looking for beer....stop by the pub!  The Pub has a ENORMOUS beer menu.  We didn't stop in for food, so I can't give any reviews about the grub.
This place sucks! Slow service, no beer knowledge, food taste like its leftover from a recent wedding
Great family owned business.  Friendly staff.  Great sushi and reasonable prices.  Check them out!
Get the Butterfish!
price and taste is perfect for my wallet and stomach!! love it!
Great location close to the light-rail, lots of shade, and ample restrooms. However, the beer selection is terrible, and the food choices only slightly better. But let's face it, you're going anyway. Just grab a drink and brat before you get here.
This pizza is like all of the other chains dominos, papa johns. If your looking for good or desent food go somewere else
Cheap prices and a great place to get fresh veggies. Place does get busy on the 1st and 2nd of the month given how cheap the place is so try to avoid those two days.
The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable. The service is fast and the food was great!!
The girly drink I had was sooooo good! \n\nI would pick Sierra Gold over Blue Martini any day! Half off pizzas and drinks for $3? Im game!
Typical local bar, but I'd say it's nicer than most. The drinks are cold and food is descent. The pizzas are pretty good, and even better during happy hour. The wings are good as well. Nice spot to hangout after work.
Beautiful place! Beds are great. But worst customer service. Only stayed here two times.  My wedding night and my sister in laws engagement party.  Slow service and rude workers. Too expensive for the horrible service.
Rubio's is on the corner. It is inexpensive. The food is ok. Nothing to get excited about.
I was under-impressed.  Stay far away from the calamari which came as a lump of fried mass of chewy something.
Overpriced, mediocre, lack of attention to detail and quality. Would not recommend. Don't waste your money.
A bit pricey but very good food.
The brisket and drunken shrimp are great.  live muic was fun on patio.  New owners have done a great job with refresh and menu.  New servers are nice.  Price was right
Good hike for kids!
Capo's on Sahara is delish! The pastas are yummy and service was great. The meat is cooked to perfection and seasoned very well. The ambiance is perfect for friends or a date.
Great Italian food. Great Sinatra music playing all night. Everything was excellent from service to desert. Try out the cigar room in the back.
This place was soo much fun. The food was delicious. Bobby the singer was wonderful and made my girlfriends night. Definitely will come back
Good food, fries are awesome but everything is so pricey.
I came into this place with high expectations. Boy was I disappointed, over-priced chicken fingers. Felt like chicken tenderloins that were put in oil. For the price, not worth it.
Dirty dirty dirty and their merchandising is with out a doubt the worst.
Slightly above average mexican food. One thing that keeps me coming back is they have excellent hot sauce. Service is always good. Very friendly staff. They do make great nachos maybe I should add a star!?!?
Where would I be without my TJ's???  I go for everything!  wine, coffee, cheesecake, cookies, and food!  not to mention wonderful flowers!
We came here for Valentine's Day and it was outstanding. Everything was delicious and the service was impeccable. Joon and his staff made this a very memorable evening for us. Highly recommended!
Great food and service.  Currently the best steak I've ever had, twice!  They are  consistent for sure!
Quick lunch so I had the Spinach power salad.  Pretty quick and easy.  Salad tasted pretty good.  Lots of people in there so it was pretty noisy.
Food is great when they get your order right or haven't ran out of something.  The staff needs to learn how to treat customers better...thus the 2 stars.
Love it! Very intertaining. Way better than I thought about a hynosis show.
I was super excited to see the show. I wish I didn't see the Youtube videos thouygh because I feel like I ruined the show, BUT seeing people do the silliest things is just plain hilarious.
Oh Ya!!!! The most incredible bodies on the planet. Performance is impeccable and who knew the best pop-locking I've seen in a long time!! What a great surprise! True Cabaret!
Went here for breakfast and it was just okay. The vegan options were minimal and our meal was just ehh.
I had a nice little breakfast crossiant/sandwich here and it was delicious. Place was clean and busy. Go small business!
Underwhelming service, and sub-par facilities.
Love squaw peak, 4 star rooms with a 5 star experience! good for a staycation, they'll bring you drinks while you float the lazy river. Plenty to keep the kids entertained as well.
Took forever to be seen by waitress. Not busy. Didn't ask me for anything to drink. Food was not bad but not good either. Got my order wrong. Nothing to write home about. I will not be coming back here.
By far one of the best buffets in las Vegas!
I added another star for their breakfasts. If you up for this, it's worth the $5.00 per person.
Great price and decent food selection. Discount available if you have Player's Card. \n$6.99 Breakfast\n$8.99 Lunch
Generous portions and good food.  I appreciatef the choice of black beans in addition to refried beans.
Gross, the shrimp aren't clean. The food is random and really poor quality. Small selection of food all around. My free wine was in a dirty glass.
This was the best theater I have been to in the Valley that serves food & drinks in the movie. Great lobby, statium seating, clean and friendly service. I'll be back!
When it comes to pizza, I'm all about the sauce.  \n\nBoston's has GREAT sauce.\n\nThe decor, it's kinda generic.
Best breakfast burrito in the valley. I have been here dozens of times since I have lived down the street forever and it is an old favorite. You will not be disappointed.
I use to frequent this establishment a couple of times a week for a Breakfast Burrito, however, on one of my visits the gal behind the counter seemed to have pink eye.  It's rare that I will go there now...
I have been coming here for a few years now and it is a great place to grab some quality Mexican food, and for the price, you can't beat it! I recommend the rolled tacos w/ guacamole or any of the breakfast burritos.
Best chorizo and carne asada around. Forget filibertos or any of his cousins. Los Favoritos is the bomb.
Up-scale environment and wonderful services. The food is good but not spectacular.
The place is nice, but you do expect more especially when it has Mario Batali's name involved. The portions are also small for the price you pay. The dishes are good but you want more.
Every trip to Vegas is incomplete until I end up sitting at the bar with a glass of wine, savoring the superb grilled octopus
Not good!\nService was wanna-be professional and food was average at most and WAY overpriced (had lamb for $100!).
I tried straberry waffle, it was fluffy and delicious... Coffe was ok. This is comparable with a Denis (if you ask me)\nI Did not expect to much from this restaurant; andIi liked what was served at my table.
We've eaten here 3 times and each time had great service and food. The deep fried platter for 2 is a great deal! I love the inka dish with fish and cheese and rice, it's my favorite! The selection and unique cuisine is top notch!
Awesome ceviche!
I've had better experiences at other churrascarias. the pork tenderloin and ham-and-pineapple selections were the only highlights.
Not entirely sure why this is 3 stars. I think it's delicious. The meat rodizio is amazing. Staff was kind and funny too. Definitely coming back here when I go to Vegas again.
Save your money. I got a deal 2 people for $30 and I still felt like it was a waste of money.
The food was awesome. The meats were overwhelming. The ambiance was fun. Definitely will return!
Been there today. My dog got all exiting , thought he will meet some new friends. Just kids and 1 dog on a leash . I'm still searching for a nice , crazy , open dog park. Where is it just for dogs, and they can run around no leash .
It's ok, good for a quick bite. I don't understand the almost cult like following.\nMade a mistake and had the shake instead of pop and was sick for hours.\nStaff was very friendly, but they needed someone dedicated to keeping the place clean.
I've been here a couple of times with my dad for dinner. This place serves pretty good dish. I didn't quite like the fried pork dish. I can never tell if I'm eating fat or meat. Other dishes aren't bad.
We went at noon and the three lions were all sleeping!
Blood stains on wall.   Check.\nLumpy college dorm room mattress.  Check.\nAsian guys giving me hard looks.  Check.\n$25 tables all weekend long.  Check.\n\nTwo star review.  Check.
This review is for the food court. It sucks. The price for what you get is ridiculous. Ive had better burgers at McD's and for a third of the price!
Saw Mike Tyson! Hahaha Sweeet
Very nice atmosphere if you like walking around looking at casino and shops.\n\nHowever, this place is way overpriced, with $10 cocktails.
This place is breath taking you have to go here if you go to Vegas.\nThere is everything, shopping scenery, but don't forget your camera!!
All of these casinos start to run together after awhile. But Caesar's does have one of the biggest gaming floors I remember seeing in Vegas.\n\nA good a place as any on the strip to throw away your money!
Great hotel.. Nice view of the strip from the rooms
Everything you could need is here.  Yes you can venture out... But why would you?!
Request a room in their newer towers that were recently renovated. much nicer and up to date.
I attended a meeting at Caesars in May.  I had been to Caesars many, many times, but have never stayed at the hotel.  They put us up in the Octavius Tower...very nice!  Big rooms, comfy beds, nice bathrooms and great views!
The room or pretty decent, but their WiFi policy is INSANE.  $25/day PER device.  I sucked it up and paid for my work laptop, and then determined it was $25 more for my iPad and $25 more for iPhone.  Absolutely ridiculous.
Norton my beloved retriever loves this place and the ladies here are always happy to see him walk in the door.  They have great products here carefully selected toys and treats for your dog's health.  I love that it's locally owned and I hope they do well!
The sushi here is always fresh and delicious.  Not crazy about there entries. There spicy tuna roll is jam packed with tasty tuna. Very good sushi bar.
This is my choice for Indian food. I go in for the buffet so i don't have to choose which one i want. Favorite would be the curie chicken.
I only ordered pho there and wasn't impressed at all but I saw some other dishes other people were eating looked pretty good.  It gave me the feeling that it's a more Americanized joint comparing to the ones on spring mtn. I'm willing to try again.
Just heard about yelp and looked up restaurants while in the Phoenix area. This place was amazing was there last Thursday, you gotta try their hummas combo. been to many middle eastern places, this was a treat. Great discovery!
This dog park is heavily used. The water feature for water dogs is really cool but it does not seem like people pick up after their dogs much. Boo, lots of poo!
A total waste of time. No poop bags, lots of poop everywhere, no grass, very small. My dogs thought it was boring. We are out of here.
Went back again and the food and price are still good!
I quite enjoyed the dinner I had here and would definitely return. Friendly service, excellent food... Seems on a par quality wise with Bankok Balcony in Squirrel Hill. Fairly small inside.
Asian Pear Martini, it doesn't get better!  We love the hummus sampler, too!
Good drinks one day. Great drinks another. Watered down drinks the 3rd day. That's why it got 3 stars. Wish I could have given it more. If go back though.
Un-Real best BBQ, very good!
This is an awesome venue!  I came here in April to see Garbage and the show was outstanding!  Every seat is a good one, the venue is small and intimate but not too small.  The drinks are a bit pricey but its Vegas.  The bathrooms were very clean and organized.
This is definitely the worse beach club I have been to. Yeah its fun on certain days when Party Rock makes an appearance... otherwise its just an overcrowded area with a small, dinky, and grimy pool!
I was not impressed.  My catfish tasted like some aquariums smell.
I try to avoid this market unless its absolutely necessary. Not because the selection isn't great or because the staff isn't friendly. Its because its almost always overly busy!
Great Asian Store in bad location. Too many homeless' in the parking lot  and by front of store begging for money or cigarettes.
Great burgers, waffle fries, and quick service. Much better then I expected and they have a good dinner menu and late nite burger menu also. \n\nPlus you can play keno at your table!!!
Dr Rusick is awesome! I was having chronic neck and upper back pain when one of my friends referred me to him. After just a few appointments I was feeling much better.  Dr Rusick will listen to what is bothering you and will come up with a plan to help your problem.
Dr. Rumman is NOT a helpful doctor, and she doesn't answer all my questions. Her whole attitude at the hospital seemed arrogant and least understanding.
Fun store if you are looking for Korean. To the poster that identified this store as Japanese, was wrong. Korean and Japanese foods are similar but not the same.
Definitely one of the best, if not best, sushi spots in the valley! Its a far drive for me, but well worth it to get authentic, good quality, tasty japanese food! I will definitely be back!
Can't wait until Cincinnati gets one... clean, quiet, and on-time. What more is there to say?
awesome people working there that really know their stuff. Great selection of guns. WE LOVE ARIZONA TACTICAL FIREARMS
My husband and I love, love, love the pizza. It all comes down to the crust and sauce which are both hand made each day. We always get the same waiter to serve and knows what we want. Great for a weeknight meal.
We love RPC!! We have been here for nine years and just love Pastor Bill's sermons and the worship here! Our son loves the Children's ministry and we are so happy to be a part of the RPC community!
There is always good stuff to find at the Maxx.  This store is a great way to kill an hour looking for something and end up spending 10 bucks.
Horrible customer service.  I guess you shouldn't expect the cream of the crop, but halfway friendly wouldn't be bad.
Wish it had a drive thru, but otherwise a nice location. Inside there is a lot of room and plenty of tables to sit and hang out. There are power outlets if you look, so you can also charge the computer, etc., while having coffee.
I would have given 4 stars but I got there at 10 when they opened and no one was home. 5 minutes later an employee showed up, went in and left all 4 of waiting outside for another 5 minutes. The haircut was good enough. I'd go back.
Came here while a robbery was in progress.\n\nThe cops asked me why on earth I would have come here alone (at 9pm, no less)\n\nAvoid at all costs, unless you need more excitement in your life.
Good breakfast burritos, all other food looks good too
The California Club and Breakfast Buzz are both amazing
Literally d'lish. I think I've had and loved everything on the menu. Nuts&berries salad, california club, turkey club, southwest burrito bowl, protein burger, ...everything. healthy and amazing.
What a great find! Coffee is strong and tasty. Oatmeal is very good as are the breakfast sandwiches with very fresh and high quality ingredients. Efficient, prompt and very friendly service. We'll be back!
Unbelievably great.
had them through my home warranty and they charged me 500 for a fan motor on my AC...way over priced but I was desperate and wanted it fixed. the new fan still didnt fix problem so it was a pretty big rip off. Would not recommend.
Good, consistent food in a nice setting with good service.  This is not stand out Italian food, but still worth checking out!
Great little Italian place.  Very small dining area, so a long wait.  The food was good.  The arrabiatta was actually spicy which is rare here since most places dumb it down for the general population.  Service was good.  A solid 4 star place.
Does not matter if the food is good if place is not clean.  Very dirty.
The carne asada tacos are definately worth while!!! Large size corn tortilla, good amount of meat a d great flavor! They seen to have a good selection of other authentic Mexican food! Will go again
Such amazing home services! I have had the pleasure to visit each home chatting with the employees, residents and the owner Lida. Beautiful landscaping and everyone is treated like family! I wish there was 10 stars to rate them! :)
Good chocolate croissants, even though they're shipped frozen and then baked at the premises.  \nDo they serve teas there?  I'll have to check that out next time I'm there for a croissant!
Tasty espresso, very friendly & welcoming staff, good atmosphere. Prices are competitive. Will definitely go back!!
Great place to stay!! Rooms are big and clean. The linens on the bed were great too!! Stayed here while the Ironman competition was in town and it was still nice and quite. Will definitely stay here again!!
You get what you pay for. Police where called to the room next to me. The rooms had a nice modern touch to them overall was a nice look however I did get bit by a bug while I was there.... Not cute.
Very friendly service, love that this place is locally owned! They will text you when your prescription is ready. Overall I've had great experiences here.
Loving Ulta! I wish they offered more loyalty rewards.
These guys were great.  They were prompt, even though it's quite a trip to get to my house, polite, and reasonably priced.  Everything I'm looking for in a plumber.
Great place for fast lunch!!! The buffet is always stocked here! Keep it up! Easy to get in and out of.
Your typical Buffalo Wild Wings franchise.  TV's are placed well, and no bad seat in the place.  Drink specials most of the time, and they show most UFC and boxing PPV's.
This place is shit .
This place is great! Always friendly service and they have good facebook deals too!
Yay for local babies! We got a smoking deal on a set of Dwell studio baby bedding here and stocked up on clothes and a few books. Awesome prices and the owner was friendly and helpful. We'll be back once the little one comes!
Longest wait times ever. Nobody is in the office and have been sitting here for 2 hours. Never again. Go somewhere else.
Laid back coffee shop with friendly staff, reasonable prices, and great coffee! What more can you ask for?
Solid Mexican in a seedy part of town.  It's a shame that Carolina's is so close otherwise I might drop by here more often.
too many bad experiences at this rest. to count. they always get my order wrong. if its not that they will have someone rude at the counter. they have kids running the rest. skrewing things up. burnt food, terrible customer service. stupid to eat here.
I used to love this store but it has really gone down hill the last 3 years. My last three visits to the archery counter keep getting worse and after Saturdays poor service I have had enough and won't be back.
Good as Home Depot can be. Depending on your taste, Lowe's may or may not be better for you. They're the same but different. :) Selection/brands that is.
I can't find anything here! I can't even find a nearby employee to help me. FRUSTRATING!!!!!!
Some of the worst Chinese food on the planet and it is served with some attitude. If you live in QC try China Chef by the other Fry's, blows this dump away!\nSoggy dead food! That sums this joint up.
Have to say I love this place. Usually order take out vs eating there but they are always very friendly when we go in.   Food is yummy, the price is right and service is quick.  Would have given 5 stars if they would deliver lol!
Very clean and nice staff.  Probably one of the best locations they have.
The guy working Oct 18th turned then open sign off more that 20 minutes before the 8pm close time posted.  Went in and asked if the store was still open and the response wad \"I guess I could make something.\"  Lucky we only wanted drinks.  Owner should be pissed!
This is not a place I will return.  They are not very friendly and when you make a request for a design, they look at you like you're crazy.  My designs came out absolutely horrid and I ended up just going somewhere else for a new polish.
This place was very average. I've had much better Mexican food and this reminded me a lot of a Chipotle, but maybe a step below. I'm not a fan and wont be back, there is much better Mexican food in Arizona.
I used to really love this place. The vermonter is the best sandwich I've ever had. My only issue is that they have shrunk the size of the sandwiches and kept the price the same. But the flavor is still incredible.
Ulta sells a wide range of brands of beauty products from drug store brands to high-end designer brands.  The cool thing is that they actually accept manufacturer coupons. They also have their own coupons and frequent sales, so you can get good deals here.
Yeah, its BBB....what else to say?
Place was open today! So it gets an extra star!!!
Always busy, always a full parking lot. Be prepared to hoof it.\n\nGreat selection, friendly staff.
A great experience, great driver. On time - text alert for ETA very reasonably priced
Cox was great until I spoke with their customer service person Juan (Employee #1347). All I wanted to do was take some packages off that I currently have.\n\nI'm paying the 150.00 cancellation charge and Cox can shove it!
Just horrible it taken them a month to transfer my internet over. One guy I talked to was crying about him not wanting to lose his job and that he needs his job. They also don't return their phone calls. I'm glad I payed them $60 for no internet.
WORST COMPANY EVER.  Horrible customer service, not friendly.  I had to walk the representative through the website over the phone.  They don't care about loyalty at all, or keeping customers.
One word.... Horrible.
Go in, Talk to AJ or Jeff. They do good things for people. See my upcoming review of the metrocenter store for more.
Best mocha EVER! Wayne makes the best drinks and is always a delight to see in the morning.  I moved out of town, but when I visit, I stop here every morning!!
No bueno!! I dont recommend this place. Its no where near authenic mexican food.
The food was good, but looked like they needed a maintenance person, there was food all over the trash can, the tables weren't cleaned either.
Good food and very friendly service.
Not bad at all. The refried beans and rice were standouts.
The hot dogs are pre-made and available for a \"hot dog buffet\"\n\nThey also sell cheesesteaks which are actually very good.\n\nNot fancy but good food.
I have been here several times and they have the best cheesesteaks. I was not impressed with the mexican food I ordered, but the classic cheesesteak with onion is the best, and don't forget onion rings.
Not bad.  You get bar food but I think you expect that going in.  Nice enough ambiance for lunch.  Great service.  The veggie burger was edible.  The sweet poatoes were edible.  The green tea was good.  I will go again since I live so close by.
Great place in neighborhood. Food is excellent most meats are smoked with awesome flavor.Great Happy hour for drinks and they offer their boneless wings on special.Service has been extremely slow as of late not sure why but hope it improves?
Great hang out spot in Phoenix!    Staff is amazing and I will definitly come back next time in Phoenix!
I would give zero stars based on service and courtesy if I could. The woman in the drive thru this morning was extremely rude. Glad nobody was behind me because I backed out of the drive thru and am so glad I did since now I'm eating real food.
Good food but we lately they can not get the to go orders right! \n\nNothing worse getting home with your order and it's not right! TWO TIMES AND A ROW!
Nice little place!  We had huevos rancheros with hand-made tortillas. Very nice family, their younger daughter serves.
I ordered the bite sized chicken pieces. There was a bone in the very first one I but into. It cut my gums up. I am very dissatisfied. Avoid this place,
My previous visits to this place left me quite unimpressed but recently there seems to have been a marked improvement in the food quality. The ingredients are fresher and the food is tastier. Service is friendly and the place itself remains clean, spacious, and bright as before.
This sonic is pretty bad when it comes to customer service. The window helper sounded like this was the last place she wanted to be and looked it as soon as I got to the window. I'm not expecting perky and perfect but friendly and alive would have done just find.
Very friendly service and a great dining experience.   Wr sat outside which was very nice.   The pizza was probably a 3 or 4 star but the service and atmosphere makes up the difference.  And a plus,  they serve Coke products.  And there are not too mancy choices in Verado.
Visited again today.  LOVED the new musical instrument section and the expanded sheet music area.  AWESOME.
Bookmans is all great.
Dated, but nice.  Good Chicago hot dogs and they sell Old Style beer!  Can't beat that!
Slowest rental car check in ever. Took over an hour and I wasn't even sure what the hold up was as there was not a big line at all.
I always prefer to support the local businesses but Subway is better.
Much cleaner and nicer location than 15th Ave & Bethany Home Rd. Employees are friendlier and more willing to help here it seems. Bigger store with slightly larger selection also.
They don't have the usual great subway service that you would expect from a subway. Ive been in multiple tines and employees have not had a uniform. No great and they are mean when attend to you. I recommend the service at jersey mikes better.
Pretty decent compared to other places in the area. A lot better than the one by Grand & Reems. I will come here again.
Oh my god. that's worst service. The staff is not very polite. I feel very bad, food is OK, one star, I won't go back to eat.
I was able to call these guys just after 7 on a Saturday and drop it off at 8 and pick up by 10 for a wedding.  Pretty happy so far although I haven't gone to the wedding yet..
This place was so disgusting. It was so dirty and dingy. I needed one nail repaired and a blind person could have done a better job.
Worst manicure I've ever had. I created a Yelp account just to provide this feedback.
The guy overcharged my sister for sure! Pizza was mediocre, I'm from NY and I know what good pizza tastes like.
Horchata is delish! Familiar faces is nice. Pretty good veggie burrito, bomb breakfast burrito, seriously good. Decent prices, but their guacamole could use some work.
Been going for 6 years  and great pizza just like my  previous home on Long Island. Service and atmosphere stink.
We've ordered from Slide and Bounce Around a couple of times... We love what they offer and had a Blast every time!!
Always someone or something wanting a hand out. This place smells in the early mornings
I really dislike it when i go to a resturant and do not get acknowledged. 10 min. Is just too long.  Then to serve tepid beer and not offer a glass.  Not good...not good.
They are remodeling the place. It's gigantic but a little messy
Spent 16+ on my food; got half and a flat soda. Terrible.
Healthy, Tasty, Fast, Cheap, what's not to love.  Awesome for mall food for sure!
Not bad. Fairly small location. Staff was friendly, selection is kind of lacking.
if you are looking for a pizza better then Pizza hut or Little caesers then this is your place...not much of a compliment but the pizza here is pretty ho-hum...
Is it just me, or does anyone else feel the need to sanitize themselves after leaving this dark, grimy store?
So Sad, I went here the other day craving the ZBQ pizza only to see that they are now CLOSED!!!
Golden medium wings are amazing
Im sorry that I brought 30 people into your bar. Your staff was unprofessional and rude. You are a shit bar. Go fuck yourself.
My chicken was undercooked and was onion filled in my chicken fajita pita made me not to ever get one again thanks a lot
After waiting for two hours I kept noticing that they would take \"regulars \" or friends over people waiting . They have a number system that's not worth a sh*t. Why have numbers when you're gonna pick who you want. I will never go back there again!
Came because they claim to cut high tech auto keys. Not only did I not get a key cut but I was told they could not cut the key for my Honda. If you are going to advertise that you cut high tech keys then you should be able to.
Employees are really loud and very rude while in break. Is there a reason why 3 of them are yelling and laughing hysterically and manage to be louder then all 20 ppl sitting and eating in the dining room?
I love this place! They have great gas prices and friendly staff. The lines are long but they go quick. The baggers are extremely helpful and always go above and beyond.
as far as a walgreens go this one could be a lot better. the employees are not very helpful, the pharmacy is a joke. try to avoid this one, nothing to see here folks.....
Very friendly. I went in looking for minis and Dungeons & Dragons books. I didn't find what I was looking for, but the staff was nice. If I lived closer I might check back again.
Hands on customer service. Always will return for my engraving needs.
This is by far the worse KFC I have ever been to. No matter what I have ordered it takes for ever. The food taste old! We need corporate to come revamp the staff and retrain on the cooking or they won't stay be in business much longer.
So, I decided to try the Flatizza, BIG MISTAKE. Had enough pizza sauce on it to make a large real pizza. The flatbread was so hard I couldn't eat it and the cheese was cheddar not mozzarella.
I have always found the tavern to be a good place to grab a cold one and share some conversation with your friends.  Recently they put together a bicycle bar crawl which I took part in, and had a great time.  They have all the sporting events, including UFC fights and all the NFL games.
After one of the people from this store walked around our furniture showroom and passed out her business cards to my clients, I DEFINITELY will not be shopping here. That was low. Not sure why this posted 18 days ago, this happened about a year ago.
If you don't care about quality Chinese food panda is the place...\nI don't mess with meat there
Only thing good is the garlic parm  wings. There's not a lot of meat on them and all the other flavors are disgusting
I was in North Phoenix for a friend's birthday.  This place was choose by one of our mutual friends.  This place is very authentic!!!  The help speaks Cantonese! (and English) and were very helpful in their recommendations.  I would go back if I lived up there.
LOVE the diamond ice!!!
Love their boba and especially their diamond ice that fills with fruit such as strawberries, melons, and my very favorite red beans. Always order the medium ones cause you will crave for more if you order small. Guaranteed! :)
It's always a better day in Arizona with some Boba. The spot is cool and urban, but has a touch of authenticity. Stock up on Asian supplies from the market next door while you're there.
This Place is DIRTY DIRTY DIRTY all the time!!!! Lazy employees. Please hire someone other than a nineteen year old for the fast times.
I've been a customer for several years. David came out on time and quickly found my leaking tub valve.\n\nYou can't go wrong with Citywide.
I really discount tire for their prices and warranties, but one thing I can't stand is how they scraped my lip on my new wheels when they installed the new tire. Of course they denied it...what to do, ugh.
With Walmart being so big, they lack customer service. Pressed for assistant more than 3x at the fabric section and no one showed up. They just keep losing sales over and over. Will it ever get better??!!!! Such a disappointment.
Staff here is extremely friendly. Starbucks inside is great to get before shopping. Better than most Targets I have been to.
Really good food. Get the deal for two, it's a really delicious meal for a decent price.
1. Quick place to grab a bite during lunch.\n2. decent service.\n3. decently clean place. \n\nJust OK
What a place for buying a disc golf and gathering info for disc golf! awesome selection of discs.
Small sparse store with a limited selection of books and products. Well intentioned, but sparse. Maybe their classes are good..I do not know!!
If you want to deal with uneducated and unprofessional loan officers, wait three months for your loan to close, miss your closing date, loose the house of your dreams and pay $2000 in originations charges, stop looking,this is definitely your mortgage broker!
It was just ok as far as food goes the service I give A+, I went during rest week and got a great price and good value, But as for going and paying full price.I would say I would not go back . You can find much better steakhouses in the valley for similar price
Generally, Walgreens is a great organization, but they definitely have a bad apple with this store.  Rude, inconsistent employees.  I complained to the Walgreens corporate office about them, but no response.  I guess corporate does not care about customer service complaints.
larger stores in phoenix, large selection of fresh meat and seafood and a great selection of microbrews
When I asked a employee for help with shoes he tried to run off and not help me. If you are busy just say so I will not get offended by that. Just tell me so.
This is the RUDEST Trader Joes I've been to. It was like walking into Walmart, only worse if that's possible. Only one person/employee in the whole store had anything resembling MANNERS! !\nYIKES!!!
Save your $300 initial consultation and go to a Macy's personal shopper--they are free.
Big.  Scary.  Walmart.
You will not find more honest business people than the owners of Select Glass. They stand behind what they say and do. I will do business with them again and again.
Drive thru and fast turnaround are nice but not for the rip-off price of almost $8 per garment. Especially since they don't replace buttons they cracked!
OK in a pinch but really very average when it comes to Thai food. Decent lunches but not a great Thai place like Lattitude 8.
Whenever I have extra time at lunch, I cruise over to this place. I love the spicy coconut soup with added veggies or the peanut butter chicken. Service was great as well. I have no complaints about this places so i gave it a 4 star.
This place is great. The food is really good and spicy if you want. The drive up is really helpful as well. I do wish they gave more rice than one bowl but that's not too big of a deal.
The food is definitely something that needs improvement! The pizza dough is tasteless and overall in need of improvement. Burgers and wings are just average bar food  - nothing special at all. If you like to bet on horse and dog races then this maybe your place to go.
Happy hour now sucks. Only 1 beer per month on special. Next time I'll go next door to O2. New untrained waitress had to go ask someone every question I asked her.
Food was good, but, the service was horrid. Staff was more interested in spending time socializing with their friends who were also there.
Several steps above Pei Wei - I come here for lunch frequently.  The Singapore Noodles are great, as are many of their stir frys.  Locally owned and operated!  This place has many regulars, I know of one couple that eats there every day!
This place still stinks.  Maybe they can become a vets office or something useful.
This location has been under new ownership and very well run now. The place is very clean, customer service has been top notch, and they have been more than generous with their toppings. I'll visit again and again.
I have tried 3 or 4 dishes there and none impressed me. Their pad Thai is okay... One of those restaurants that I would eat at if I craved Thai and there was nothing else nearby.
It is a small place and on busy nights do takeout. Great food for sure.  I have not tried a dish that wasn't good. Their food is prepared with care. We eat here often and always take extra home.
Review wrong restaurant.  This one is located in Walmart.
Have only been for lunch on 2 occasions.\n\nSalad and soup was great but it took awhile to get it. Not sure that would be good if I worked!
Barron's is our favorite pizza place in Anthem. The toppings are good, the service and selection are good, and the pizza isn't as salty as many pizza places.
Eh...  Ok, but not really inspiring.  Thin crust was THIN, and the toppings kind of slid off.
Worse Home Depot lazy waited 30 minutes to get help in electrical department. The CUSTOMER SERVICE person told me\" I paged the person what else can he do! \"\n\nGo to Val Vista store
Not sure what's going on, slow service many of their own beers out of stock on a slow Sunday evening.\nFood was so slow I cancelled my entr\u00e9e and left.
An absolutely stunning resort in the middle of the dessert.  Lots of great activities: horseback riding, ATV tour (a MUST), etc, and golf.
I tried the green chili omelette and a caramel roll.  There are a number of pretty unique things on the menu, and everything that we tried was prepared well.  The setting is quite nice, an older house with a nice patio for outside seating.  I would definitely come back.
The food here is awful. Go elsewhere.
This nail salon used to have much better service. Stopped going here, then decided to give them another chance.  Boy was I disappointed. Water was cold, then the girl stabbed me twice while cleaning and trimming my cuticles.
Picked me up, not a selection of cars at all, and very slow
Do not wash your car at this place. The owner Matt never answers his phone or returns calls.  He also will over charge your credit card and not make it right. This place is no good be warned.
Queso fundido, enchiladas , and guacamole all awesome. By far one of the best margaritas I have ever had. Prickly Pear was awesome!!
Not really a fan of anything they offered food and service was not even worth writing a full review!!
Dinner took 45 min to arrive despite few customers in the restaurant.  How long are you willing to wait? Staff kept saying it would be ready soon. Will think twice before going there again.
This is not the best pho in the Valley. I hate to write a poor review of a business but don't get your hopes up if you're a pho enthusiast.
Very bad customer service. Too many kids work there and goof off! No management what so ever.  Never got my lunch meat on time once. Go to the store off Combs.
I've been shopping here for a few years and this shop is the best. Fantastic prices, friendly staff, shelves full with great selection, open late. I'm always glad to support my local businesses!! Highly recommended!!
One hour till closing and the teenagers they have running this place are shutting down the line and leaving the nastiest looking food on display --- and 8 customers walked in expecting something professional.\nI'm heading over to Signal Butte next time.
Pizza tastes good. But delivery is horrible. Pick it up yourself unless you want to wait 1.5 hours to eat.
No place settings - had to steal from empty table.  Dough wasn't cooked all the way, cold and doughy in spots with hot toppings? Frozen pizza kinda quality. Salads were drenched in dressing to the point of soggy lettuce.
I'm disappointed that I left SJ, CA without any problems. But leaving Phoenix AZ I was charged 50 dollars for my luggage be 4 pounds over weight.  I left AZ with exactly what I left home with if not less.  Thanks for nothing Southwest. This is totally BS
Always packed to the walls on the weekends so plan accordingly. As usual, no gourmet pizza here of course but I still love coming here because they make a super tasty pizza! It reminds me of my childhood.
Subway is typically a good respectable place for a quick sandwich.  This location is as well.  Fast, cheap, and tasty.  Good location right off  of Higley and Pecos.
Nancy Erdmann was very rude and insensitive. I felt rushed.  Sadly, I'm someone that's going through a tough time health wise and I'm just looking for a good doctor to listen and help me.  The search continues...
Love it and love the GF menu.  It's amazing how many dishes they have
Well, let me just say I really love this food, but now when I have to wait 45 minutes for it. Their \"pasta machine\" broke. GREAT.
I absolutely love this place and desire to eat every meal I can hear because it is so healthy and the juice bar is phenomenal.!.
I always get in and out pretty fast.  The servers have always been very friendly.
Overrated. Don't go out of your way. The tortillas are better than most places but the entire dishes are not special. If you are in the neighborhood its worth a stop but don't make a special trip.
The best! if your in the area, you got to stop by carolina's. you won't be disappointed in any of the food! definitely a fast reliable, and reasonable place to regularly go to
Friendly & great service.  It is a 30 minute ride for me but well worth it!
Typical Red Robin, so not much to say. The rib tips are crappy, but the beer was nice and cold.
This is always a good place to go with family,  love the Royal hamburger and endless fries my daughter loves the mac and cheese
The employees here were extremely helpful and very nice. They helped me find exactly what I was looking for and very quickly at that. I definitely recommend this Ace for anything and everything you may need.
This is a really good restaurant!  A must try for people who like Korean food!\n\nFavorites: Bulgogi with lettuce wraps and chap chae\n\nI really want to go back to try the karaoke here.
It's very smokey but I love the true non smoking section for bingo. Bingo is great here.
Our go-to place for Chinese food in the Mesa/Tempe area! We love their Mongolian dishes, vegetable fried rice, kung pao, brown rice, Etc etc! Always great service & amazing prices!
Dollar Rent-A-Car requires you to fill up within 10 miles of the airport and show your receipt.  I used the GasBuddy app to find the cheapest gas in the area, and this Circle K fit the bill!
I've been here coupla times in the past week or so.  It's a nice clean store, nothing special, pretty helpful clerks, good selection, average prices.  There is a nice big parking lot so you can always park close.
It took 34 minutes from the time we ordered to the time we received 5 small shakes.  And when the girl arrived at the car, she didn't know which shake was which.
Really good Ethiopian food. Atmosphere lacks but don't come here for atmosphere!!\n\nThis review is for their new location.
Slow and understaffed.  Looked past me and took known guy behind
Had a scheduled appt for these guys to come out and fix patio door-no show-no call-didn't return my call. Tells me they are independently wealthy and don't need new business.  Advice to everyone, Pass on this one when looking
I hat the pepper and pork stew, it was fantastic, and very filling. Along with the stew I also had the creamy corm Polenta it was absolutely great. It had a nice atmosphere and some unusual architectural design. \nGive it a try.
Had the pork chile stew, very good.  Large portion size, make sure to ask for the bread, it is very good as well.  Great atmosphere and wait staff.
Slowwwww service. From waiting 30 minutes to be seated (with open tables) to waiting 20 minutes before being able to order and 40 minutes for our food.
Great food using local sources.  Really cool casual vibe.  Love it!
Message test dinner at MNs suggestion. Cool urban setting.  Forgot I was in Phoenix.  Felt more like Denver or San Diego.  Pizzas and salad were stand outs.
Good food, friendly wait staff, causal atmosphere and great place to meet friends for lunch or dinner for a relaxing meal. If you are looking for an adventure into the best of wine from Arizona, you can get it there.
Service Fry's & Fry's Marketplace FAIR enough.Price............HONEST so. Best for weekly  shopping like me...little but every Friday it got festive look.
Meat delil lady today talked crap to her manager about me not knowing my wife was stand right there. So she went and found me to try and help after she relized. All I was asking for was her to cut my meat. I emailed corporate about her.
Amazing food! Great prices! Love this place!
Jennifer Lynn has been my hair dresser and my kids hair dresser for years now.  She is very talented with cutting and coloring and always gives my whole family a great new do.. The salon is in a great location at Kierland also...
This Costco is our local.  Sometimes the weekends can be really busy but if you go on Thursday or Friday night it can be a quick trip.\nGas station on site is cheap (of course) but always busy.
Pretty tasty coffee and local owned and operated if I am not mistaken
Fun staff, amazing coffee. Try the caramel mocha frost. \n\nI hate the smokers outside... gross! And they ruin the view.\n\nI love this location because it's close to Whole Foods. :-)
Very good food!! Great take out. I recommend the Mongolian Beef. Small dining room if you choose to eat at the restaurant.
Average location. Clean, drive thru is a little slow, but employees are friendly and helpful.
I highly recommend this company for your auto glass.    They showed up on time and the technician did a great job.
A step above The Street in Mesa but not as good as Bomb Boba and other places in West Phoenix. Still pretty good though and they have a lot of flavors and varieties of Boba.\n\nAlways get the Honeydew Slush~
I'm still coming here for my hair. Always happy and Melinda is a great to visit with while getting my hair done.
We always get the pizza and wings when visiting this establishment.  Great wings and crispy pizza.  When your here try the pizza fries, they are awesome
Great Company & Product! Hands down
Good pizza but can be a little oily/greasy.  \n\nNot really sure what else to say here.
Service was weak for the upscale image they try to pull off. The toppings weren't balanced on the pizza pie, although I'm a fan of the brick oven and fresh ingredients. I received dirty silverware. Room for overall improvement.
I cant understand how this place is still in business, the food is over priced, the quantity is little unless you like lots of bread but not enough meat for the $8 sandwich. went  there 2 times and will not go back again.
Bad service- rude and unhelpful.  \ndirty - I saw a guy pick up the floor mats and clean them and never washed his hands. \n The food was horrible. Never again.
7 min before a server came to our table ...ill update once I actually get my food ...if I ever do
Can't go wrong with Zipps, love their wings!
Went two days in a row to be sure it was really as bad as it is.  Shrimp scampi is a good example, chopped spaghetti with  a dozen popcorn shrimp stirred in, small portion served cool, high priced for warmed over \"stuff\"
Love the lunch specials here.  Such a great spot for lunch and the food is delicious.  The service has always been great too.
Horrible customer service skills. Linda that helped us need a attitude adjustment. \nWon't go back to this location.
This place is shit the workers lie about transfer fees and when they find out you dont have an AR or Glock they are dicks.
This is the worst Whole Foods I have ever been to. This location is decorated more like a warehouse than an upscale market, and the selection seems to be lacking verses other stores I've visited in the past. If you live in this part of town just go to AJ's.
For a quick lunch, my friends and I would go here. Quick, friendly.
This is my neighborhood grocery store. It's at the two locations I shop at most. It's always clean and well stocked and I never have to wait in line for very long.
I love it!!!\nClean and great service.\nFood delicious and very fast service\nI ordered cal do de res it was delicious!!
Today I went to eat lunch and I liked the food but what I liked most was the service I received. The chimichanga was delicious.
I was in there this morning and the girls were very friendly! I spilt my smoothie all over and unfortunately didnt have time to wait for another one. But the other girl had already made me another one! \nI left a happy customer! :D
I sought out Jamba Juice their highlighted drink with the giant picture- that's what I wanted. But they were missing two of the four ingredients! I'll never go back there again
I'm on the phone with Linda right now, I called them just in case to let them know the situation after I got the news from the other plumber. and she says that she's doing everything she can make the situation right. I will keep this updated.
I waited 15 min to be helped.when I was assisted the rep seemed nice.My upset sits with the store they needed a older connection to transfer contacts from one phone to another.But the one and only transfer connection was broken.this was my experience your might be a bit better.
This store is always too busy. Be sure to bring your favorite pillow because it will be a  hour before someone can help you.
They probably only get my order right half of the time but they are so friendly and makes up for it and that is why I keep coming back.
Breakfast with Rob,  The food is good.  I had eggs, bacon and pancakes.  Not my favorite pancakes, but ok.  Love their sausage gravy however.
A group of my coworkers and I go here every other week for lunch. FYI the blackberry lemonade is to diiiiie for- I order it every time we go. They have delicious healthy options to eat as well! Something for everyone
Beat body shop in town joe is the best!!\nHe does a great job on matching exotic paint
We were so very happy with the service here I would have no problem recommending Classic Gold to anyone needing auto body work done.  It's like it never even happened.   Thanks again!!
Average customer service,  average sandwich making skills, average speed. Hence average rating.
Love this dentist's office! They are all super friendly and Dr. Carson is very professional. Would definitely recommend!
Thorough workouts, every session is different, plenty of encouragement and positive attitude!
Pizza is ok for a quick bite but the service is very slow.
Everyone is very friendly & welcoming and they don't try to \"upsell\" you as much as some other places.  They always give me a bottle of water too, which is a nice touch.  Will continue coming here for sure.
Been going here for years. A great place!
No rating (just putting that in theater 12 there is a speaker in the front right that may be damaged. I heard a crack sound ((a sound a speaker makes when damaged))\n\nOtherwise a fun movie experience. \n\nCheers
Stay away from this cleaning company.........After confirming appointment, they suddenly cancel your appointment a day before and never give you a other cleaning date for the next two months.I will never buy their coupon from groupon anymore.
Great place. BUT horrible service. Although it was a game day Sunday and it was full they only came by 2times to check if we were ok and needed something and every time we asked for something we got a different server!!!
We received a full confirmation for a vehicle at their Glendale location and am now finding out they don't have a car available but found one 20 miles away at double the cost we were quoted!
Food is still good. However, the service sucks. We went there about one hour before closing. The waitress was trying to rush us out so that she could go clubbing.\n\nNot thinking about going back there unless it got a new waitress.
My mom was visiting and wanted a haircut.  She went to Eva and got the best cut I have ever seen on her. She has been getting tons of compliments on her new style. I guess now she'll have to come down and visit more often.
Time to sweat! This place is hit or miss but I can't judge yet bcuz we still have the New Years Resolution Crowd in attendance! :)
Staff nice, but forgetful. The food was cold and bland. Wish I had checked them out here first. No wonder no one was in there.
I like this a lot better than any of the other take out pizza in the area. This is a quick and tasty Sunday night dinner.
lousy!  rude but most importantly she butchered my pants!  DO NOT USE
I eat here all the time you get alot of food for a good price. The teriyaki chicken is very good. There macaroni salad is the best I've tasted out of the few island places I've had in the area. The crab puffs are also very good.
Way too over priced. I mean its great food. With an average sized portion. But for how much I'm paying?... Not totally worth it!
The tamales here are the best! I love the green chile chicken ones and usually have to get at least one every week. They are so good my boyfriend in Washington is having me send some up.
Great little restaurant. Family owned - I think? Probably the best tamales I've had. I always try to support small and local. You won't be disappointed.
One of the best Dairy Queens I've been to.  Very clean,   friendly staff. ... We had Pumpkin pie blizzards.  Yum!
I got a hair cut and loved it, however, I was not crazy about the salon. A little too modern for me.\nSeems like a good place if you like trendy hair cuts and color.
I'm a fan of the glaze!
Yuck. How can any Mexican joint have absolutely no flavor in their meat? I really wanted to like this since it's close by and I'm all about 24 hour fast food! Bummer.
Great pizza.  Nice owners!
Fyi, the drive thru closes at 10p, apparently.  Not sure if they serve walk-ins, but the sticker on the window said they close at 10p on Friday.  Bummer.  Tempe needs more 24 hr drive thrus!
We went drive through and the cashier was extremely lazy. We asked for a medicine and she said \" we sell that upfront \"
Good wait staff. They have a nice white egg om-let. French toast and pancakes tasty.  This place is very close to the University, and within a mile of several hotels.
Very expensive. Unfriendly staff. Why can't you just sell me what I need. I should have known better when no other customers where there. Avoid this place there are many other affordable places to take your vehicle to.
Waited forever in drive thru to finally get my order that was wrong. I could here the employees inside complaining about the lines and really didn't want to be at work. Once home the sides were cold and coleslaw tasted spoiled. Will NOT return
The General Tso's chicken lacked crispiness and flavor with a heat index of pre school. I had the Garlic chicken on a previous visit, and it was pretty tasty.
Terrific food!  Great drinks.  Usually very busy but will worth the wait!  Nice place white table cloths even!
This walmart never seems to have anything. When I go to other walmarts I am surprised by all the things they offer. It is very clean and friendly staff.
Not in the best part of town, especially right now with lightrail construction but it works. This store has just about everything you can ask for or need.
This frys holds the biggest award for trash. Trashy ghetto customer, trashy customer service and lazy ass people. This store should be burned to the ground with everyone in it.
I wish there was less than 1 star because now that they don't have flour chips there is no point..... It is just another Mexican restaurant :-( Super bummer.
Food is ok. Service is ok. Crab legs are just the same with crazy buffet. Dinner at 16/head adult. Quite pricey.
Very sad food quality here.  The yoshi in central Phoenix is phenomenal, but this airport location is nor worth anyone's time.
Most people seem to like it but not me.  It was not bad, just did not seem that special to me.
The food is just okay. I have had better. Service is slow.
Very, very, happy with Integrity Auto Glass. I called them and they got my insurance on the line and my windshield was replaced  within 48 hours. Very professional service from the installer Steve. Highly recommend
This is a great clothing store. Trendy, and affordable. This is the kind of place you stop by on a friday afterwork to get your outfits for whatever you got going on that weekend. Lots of cute accessories too. I've never come here & left empty handed.
Bland breakfast burrito. Needs some salt. Yes the hot sauce is spicy but taste shouldn't be just about \"how hot\" the salsa is. I'll try it another day and update my review.
I have now attempted to remove myself from your emailing list at LEAST 4 times and you keep spamming my inbox. \nDO NOT SIGN UP FOR THEIR EMAIL!  Ugh.
Love the food.  Always clean and for the most part has friendly service. The music is strangely weird at times and much too loud.
Great car wash. Perfect location along with there other locations valleywide. Great prices for excellent washes. Only place i go customer servie is outstanding and courteous. 2 thumbs up all around
Just ok. I got the food to go and I thought it was very over priced for what we got. Don't think I'll go back. :(
Excellent place to grab a bagel and cup of coffee. I have been going there for years. It is a pleasure to be greeted by name. Keep up the Great job.
We caught quite a few fish, but the guide was pretty rude and full of himself.   Acted like it was a privilege for us to be fishing with him.\nWon't be going back.   Don't need an attitude on what should be a relaxing fish trip.
It's quite simple. The food is great! The service is slow! And 98.9% of the time they will get your order wrong!
Great take out and I finally went to the restaurant to pick up my order and the place is really nice.  We'll have to try dining in some time too
Picked up early morning to go to the airport from a hotel. Paid $15. Ordinary taxi service.
I will only get my haircut here from now on. Great customer service. It may take some extra time because they are students. I like supporting the education process.
Forever boycotting this location. Franchise-owned, doesn't accept the CBTL app rewards, doesn't brew flavored coffee after 11am, and doesn't carry quiche anymore. After several bad experiences at this location, I'll never return.
I tried a slice of lemon cake; it tasted very artificial...kind of pinesol-ish. Definitely not homemade. I also tried a few cookies that were OK, nothing to get too excited about.
Absolutely the worst customer service you can imagine.  The only thing keeping Verizon in business is the good coverage and over-priced calling plans.
Terrible prices and service.  Their yorkies start at 3k.  They are out of their mind.
Roomy, modern rooms and fun pool and hot tub. Great alternative to smoky old strip hotels. Moderately price.
Don't count on a roll-away for your family. They have a self imposed policy of 2 beds to a room and will not change no matter the circumstances, expectations, or that they advertise roll-aways available.
Don't go here for food unless you want to wait in lines forever.  Every restaurant or deli has the longest and slowest functioning lines.
I just checked in a a couple of hours and i want to check out. Im used to customer service and from the bell stand, front desk and housekeeping its the worse...smh...
I came back and Doreen helped us at the bar. She was great! She made conversation and encouraged me to try the siracha wings which were AMAZING!
High prices, bad neighbourhood. Food tastes good. But with the money i spent, could of want to the buffet instead....
Beautiful decor! They gave us some free champagne since were there for our honeymoon. The tasting menu is very decadent, with caviar and truffles. If you like sushi, this is the place to go.
Roku is to sushi as \"The Golden Child\" is to Eddie Murphy movies -- far closer to the bottom than the top.\nRoll selection was weak, and construction was worse. Having said that, their crab dynamite was delicious.
Thought the place was decent. Liked the Shima roll. Everything else was good. But did not have the WOW factor working for them
Fun sushi spot I try to hit everytime I'm in Vegas.  If you like sushi give this place a try.
Excellent. Staff, food, service, quality, freshness delish. Excellent prices.
great sushi. Fresh fish. Their toro was particularly good. Did not like their hanabi. Everything else tasted amazing.
This place sucks...... no seafood..... service is not great and people are not too friendly.after asking the waiter if they offered any seafood at all he just replied with\" you have the menu,read it,I will be back\"
Couldn't get help to try on shoes (that I would have bought) but they have more than one person greeting at the door.  Great!  No service here, although the selection isn't so bad.
I regret coming to this place!!!  The first thing they asked is do you have insurance?  No hi hello or how can we help or how are you doing??  This is the worst place for urgent care!!!! I give this place a negative 5 rating!
Was waiting their with my boyfriend for almost 10 minutes until we got seated. The place was empty the hostess didn't even bring me a menu. We just walked out worst ihop ever.
Friendly staff, clean bathroom, ATM worked, cheap drinks in comparison to other places in the area.  I'll be back often...
Awesome place. Large selection in golf clubs and tennis gear. Pretty good deals that I liked. Bill stauffer helped me and he was very knowledgable. You can get custom fitted for your clubs and they will order them for you. Very friendly and professional place.
When scheduling for your cleaning, ask for Miss Julia.... She's great!
SAGE IS  NOW UNDER NEW MANAGEMENT!! Food portions are small and prices have gone up!
Filthy line. You would think they would be more concerned with the appearance of the kitchen(line) sense it is visible. Its makes you question the sanitation. I won't be coming back.
The service was extremely unprofessional and our order was missing several items. The food quality was still good, but no one seemed to know what they were doing.
They were great. Synthetic oil change the cheapest I've seen in town. Their alignment machine was occupied so instead of holding my car hostage and trapping me, they did the paperwork and payment for the oil change and said they'd call when it was open.
I get my car washed here and really like the service and especially the professionalism of assistant manager Michael Jorgensen.  He is polite, articulate and has the energy and drive to move forward in his life.  I always enjoy our brief chats!
Loved the warm garlic bread with Gorgonzola fondue, yummy! \nTheir porterhouse with baked/mashed potatoes was the bomb!\n\nAlthough it is pricey the food is excellent.
Great meal!!!! Started with the seafood plateau and finished with the filet. They nailed it!
rubio's is amazing.  their fish tacos were so delicious.  i almost couldn't believe they were from a chain.
Their food is fine. Their prices are too high for what you get. I won't go out of my way to eat there but if I'll be in the neighborhood and  have the craving for this kind of food, I'll eat there again.
Tina Marie is amazing! She was so helpful and I really enjoyed my shopping experience with her. She was very thorough and explained everything to me along each step of the process. I can't wait to get my new glasses.
Excellent service. No problems. Free upgrade and one of the sales associates took me home when she got off work.  If I need to rent another car, I will definitely come here again.
don't go there, the most horrible experience ever. they altered my jeans to the point that i cannot wear it or return them. they were very rude and when i asked for my money back i didn't got the full price i paid. and the money was thrown to me.
You may think otherwise, but I actually have a limit for enjoying things ironically. And this is pretty much it.
You never know what you will see on Fremont st. The place for a cheep show from the man in the box to the guy painting with spray paint to the guy doing clay sculpture while you wait also you may see jesus. The light show if pretty cool to.
This place is ghetto nothing good to see my bf n I even took off our watches n rings we felt we could of been robbed ., Las Vegas blvd way better
A walk on the LV feral side! Come here for Excellent people watching,  quality look alike street performers, amazing overhead TV/Projection/Light effects, live stage performances, and even zip-lining!
They have gone severely down hill. Have gone here for a couple years for close by chinese. I wouldn't go back.
I love this place too, I also want to support them.  Best service and delicious food
Beef and broccoli was tough and chewy, broccoli was hard and undercooked. Fried rice was bland and boiled. Not great, won't be back.
Their drive through is hit or miss....sometimes it's super long and other times it's crazy fast.  You just never know. \nBut the coffee is consistent and the staff is friendly.
Inexpensive. Some good deals. Lots of regulars. Friendly family owned.
Fabulous store layout and design. Beautiful merchandise.  Enjoy stopping by after lunch in the Forum Shoppes to drool! Great sales every now and then for all you locals who can stop by whenever.  Make friends with an employee and you'll be good to go!
Best donuts ever!
I'm ordering from Linos on Graig all the time. Jammy always really nice to me! Delivery is really fast and food is fresh out of oven! I'm waiting for my ultimate seafood right now!
There are better car insurance companies.  I had Geico for a long time, but when you need them, they don't care about you at all.  Too big a company, and uncaring.
Messed up my order not once but twice. Food was decent but I probably won't be coming back
Wanted to start off day with a good meal, dropped by del taco never at breakfast here before. The food was fresh the service amazing. Thanks del taco for making me full and happy and ready to start day.
Love the food and staff, only thing is the food can be a bit pricey at times for a pub.
Was there on Sunday afternoon with my wife. Maybe 5 customers in the place, but the service from the bartender was absolutely nonexistent. Will never go back!
Very dark on the inside spinach dip was to damn parmesan...my sandwich u did had to much cheese it was nasty .. Curly fries were good
I was there last week having them check my car battery. Corry was there helping me to check the battery. He was very helpful and  honest. He helped me changed the battery and declined to accept a tip saying that he was glad that he could help me, and that was part of  his job.
It's Subway...tastes the same everywhere you go...at least this place is next to my gym and they get you in and out really quick! nuff said!
Sold me an Air Filter for $38.54. I said it's too expensive. Answer: It is a great price, filters are so expensive. I'm look today in the Internet. $10.36. It's a scam!!!
I stopped in the Albertson's on my way home because of a sale on Coke.  The store was clean and bright, and the clerk who checked me out couldn't have been friendlier.  Parking is OK here and it's easy off and back on Flamingo.
The best place in town for a girls day! Love the hot stone, n the citrus scrub, we usually go with at least 3 gals. N we all get in and out together. Lotsa choices in colors n styles.
Sign says open 24/7, not true!! Went there at 2:30 am and it was closed!! We were pretty annoyed at this.
As of 11/03/13 they appear to be closed by order of the courts and there is a for lease sign in the window.
These mother fuckers hit an ran my car! Eye witness took down their cab number and license plate. Your busted!
Taxi driver stole iphone 5. Stay away from this company!!!
Seemed like a good place to eat a first but as a first timer it's so confusing which side to order from. Just wanted a Caesar wrap and had to wait longer to order it from the \"hot\" side. I'll just go to subway thanks.
I've used Dr. C for several years. He is calm, and fast.  A great dentist. Cleanings are great. Staff is very pleasant. Can't go wrong if you are looking for a competent, relaxed dentist who knows your mouth :)
Their $9 exterior car wash was fantastic.  The exterior of my car was really clean, cleaner than the brush car washes, and since it's a hand wash, better for the paint on my car.  A+
Don't do it. Go to the place around the corner. This place sucks
Item are cleaned and ready as scheduled, they offer inexpensive but quality work, and decent hours of operations.\n\nNote, there is a drive through for those of you with children!
I love Sterling [PERIOD]. I do think, however, the bagels, at $0.95, are a bit pricey, but they are great...not NY, but as close as you can get
Solid kabob place. Absolutely zero decor in the place, but it's huge an cheap, which is great for big parties.
I've been here twice and the food is great! But what makes this place even better is the service. They go above and beyond and just make the overall environment and experience delightful! Very clean restaurant, friendly staff and great food. This one is great to revisit.
Great portions, good prices and excellent service. The ambience is friendly and the music is relaxing. Great place to go on a date or with family. We come every time we are in Vegas!
The service sucks. The entrances are weird and confusing. Employees look angry and unapproachable. They do make good hummus, pitas are dry thoughbut my husband and I would rather go elsewhere.
Very nice ambiance and service is really nice. The food pretty normal although I think their babaganoush is perfect here. Not overly tangy and the meats are cooked perfectly.
Best gyro we ever had! Worth the drive!
Decent course for the $45 off season price. Greens were in terrible shape but I'm told they are better during the summer. Be sure to practice good \"etiqueccy\" here and watch out for the Dbag wearing all black.
Well I didn't get sick and die, that counts for something these days!
the service is either hit or miss
With over 200 different major stores they have great dining a huge outdoor mega screen and lots of events including daily fashion shows.
Its one of the larger more traditional big city type malls in Vegas. Lots of department stores and tons of stores. Nothing too fantastic but it is worth checking out if you are looking for the normal shopping in Vegas.
Great mall. Need more elevators, more restrooms and what the hell, says you open at 10:00 am but the stores aren't even open yet. \n\nThis mall needs to get it together.
Great service!  Food tasted great too.
Val was very helpful and knowledgeable about the products. She helped me with a sim card issue and didn't even charge me, so I bought a stock charger for a great price. Will buy from again and refer my friends and family.
Mojitos.  Enough said.
Nice selection of cigars and a sophisticated, wide ranging bar and cocktail menu. Mojitos are very authentic.\nOdd comment for a cigar bar but we found it a little too smoky late at night.
Dr.spellman is great. I felt no pain during a filing and felt very comfortable. I'm not a fan of dentists, but he made me feel comfortable.
Food here is satisfactory. It's not going to blow your mind. I generally order the California burrito and it's good. But if your looking for something authentic look elsewhere. However, it does the job if your looking for something cheap and filling.
After trying the sundance special for the very first time, I try so hard to try other items on the menu but I seem to always revert back to my Sundance Special! Love the potatoes and banana nut muffin with my breakfast!
This place is amazing!  The bacon mashed potato omelet is a must.  The wait staff is friendly and attentive.
Good food. \nFast service. \nWell priced. \nTenikia, our server, was super friendly and nice.
It's 106 degrees outside and 90 plus inside the restaurant !!! Asked if the AC was on. Oh yes she would check??  It's 90 plus. AC is not working!!! Daaahh
Customer service here is terrible!  The teenage Asian girl there never has a clue to anything. Please hire someone with more common sense and a better personality and maybe you'll have more happy customers
Over priced. Grumpy driver. I could get 2 subs at Jimmy Johns for the price they charged me. The dessert (Cheese cake) sub parr...thick bread, hardly any meat. I do not recommend it.
Love it!  I like that they do half sushi rolls!  The best rolls are the ocean roll, sexy roll and first kiss!  And their ice cream in your mouth is a very neat dessert roll!  Their AYCE price cannot be beat it includes Everything on their menu!
The worst BBQ ever seen. Servers are fine but the best rice is really really extremely expensive. Specialty the Beef Stew. Don't ever come here.
Over-burned rockhard rice in their dolsot bibimbap almost broke my teeth. Terrible dining experience here.
Me and my friends chill here twice a week. Nader is the best bartender around. Great music, lots of tv's, and great food. I LOVE this place
The place is hit or miss depending on which bartender you get.  They have some really good ones, but they also have at least 1 really bad one.  I won't name names but I wouldn't recommend the place on certain nights of the week.
Good variety, really good prizes, service could be better. Sales people are really not interested in helping you find the right jeans model but are at least smiling..
If you like waiting then this is the company for you.  The people are fine but forget about punctuality, it's not here.  Take a cab and save some time.
Spend a little more and take a taxi. Just rude. Tried to tell us that even though we paid for hotel pick up that we had to walk 3 hotels away. We knew more about the events going on than they did. No accountability.
Never again! If you're trying to reschedule a hotel pick up, you're wasting your time and your money. Customer service sucks. You would do better to take the public bus system. Not only is it easier and more direct, it's a lot more inexpensive.
Holy Moses!!!! Best chicken cheesesteak I've ever had!!! I highly recommend this place.
Cobra Kai Is the best gym I ever went to!! sim is the best jiujitsu coach in the world I recommend this gym
The food is cook fresh and it taste delicious. The prices are really reasonable.
Worst service of my life. Slow service. Wasn't busy at all. Got cold bread around the same time my pizza came out. Save your money and go elsewhere.
Always love going to CPK. There three of us. The salad and spaghetti was excellent. Took awhile to get served, bread and a waitress. She was looking right through me as I recited my order, was slow and just not interested. I'd still go back though.
Nice prices... Horrible customer service... I'll only be back because they have really cute stuff...
This place is off the strip so the prices are better here.  Has everything you need to take to the hotel.  Local types here and friendly service.  Not a lot of transients hanging around like other places in the area.
The ultimately slowest sbux EVER!!!!!!!they seem to have plenty of employees but the speed just isn't there! Isn't Starbucks supposed to be convenient ?
Was not thrilled by the massage or the way that they try to railroad you into a contract. I did not like either one ... They pretend to be the premier place to go but truthfully they are subpar.....   I viewed them as used car salesmen....
Great place!! I love my nails and toes!! Will come back again!! Prices are reasonable and everyone is friendly and courteous!!
I love Outback, the steaks are great and a lot less pricey then the hotel steakhouses.  The wait staff, hostesses and management are awesome.
I went in for and met the Dr. very, very briefly. We decided not to do anything. I still got a bill. I don't recommend going here.
Had a mole removed over a month ago and have yet to hear from them with the results.
Every time I have used desert taxi, they have been so nice on the phone when I order a taxi, and the driver has always showed up early. In fact, If I wasn't ready, they always said, take your time.
Terrible service. They were rude over the intercom, didn't listen and hung up on us before we were finished. Never had such a hard time at a drive through. The food was ok, but just average. Most likely not returning.
Great apps! Elham is a fantastic server, ask for her if you go, but you shouldn't everything else was horrible! Just go next store to DW bistro instead!
Was close by for a doctor's appointment and yelp introduced me to this place & I fell in love with the place. Exceptional food and service, one of the best meals I have ever had in my life.
This place has some if the best Italian food I've ever had. Our waitress was terrific, the drinks were delicious, the food was phenomenal, and the view isn't so bad either!
The bread is the only thing delicious here. Service was poor,, Cesar Salad taste rotten!! Fettuccine chicken was bland!
It was a little disorganized, the staff was super friendly though. The lady that checked me out was efficiently quick and cheerful. The sales were great today as well.
Owner is a profit driven douchebag hey nothing wrong with hustling but he hustles in a rude thoughtless way..asked him to start carrying \" sage\" incents every time I go in and he refuses to even acknowledge the request..
Fast & Good!
Needed to have my phone repaired today...checked in at 3:30...wasn't helped until 5:03.  This is the same case scenario everytime I have to go in...which is a lot because my phone blows!!!  :/
Went because friends that were in town wanted to see him and he was great!  Loved the finale.  Worth the $$$$.  Just DON'T stay at Luxor.
A show you can count on for some great laughs.  Carrot Top has tons of funny props and sound effects.  I would recommend it.
I didn't think I liked Carrot Top, but after seeing great reviews decided to see his show.  I am so glad I did!  It was hilarious.  A must see in Vegas!
Great show. Half the cost of other shows and as most reviews have already said. \nDo it!!!!! Not a bad seat in the house is also true. Perfect view as rows are low enough\nthat your not looking at the back of someone's head.
We had the best Thanksgiving dinner at Arizona Charlie's buffet!  Fabulous stuffing, real mashed potatoe, great desserts!  No mess to clean up at home!  Thank you for working on this holiday and for making such good food!
They need to hire a receptionist who is willing to give business to their salon and stylist. I just got off the phone with THE WORST receptionist of all time who had no clue on how to run a salon. talking my business elsewhere.
Walked in at 1:15am August 10, 2014 & walked out 1:30.. A waitress touched pancakes with her dirty ass hands after she rang up seven people at the cash register . & serve the pancakes cold as well.
Agree with all previous reviews. This company is one of the worst I have ever dealt with...period. It was literally so bad I felt like I was on some blooper punked show. Avoid them or suffer.
APM is a complete joke!  Don't waste your time listing your investment property with them-I will let the countless horrible reviews speak for themselves and not waste my time writing all the garbage I want to write about them.
I wish I  could give it less.  They used to be good.  The owner was a jerk on the phone.
Ridiculous prices.  Not all that tasty.  Not for down-to-earth types.
A LOVELY BUNCH OF BONES comes with each choco box during hawlowene. if chocolate could talk it would saw buauahahaha spooooky.
Sooo good! Great price, good portions! This may be my favorite place for hearty meals! Such good hearty food choices, I actually thought this was a mexican restaurant, i'm not disappointed it wasn't. Yummy!
Way way way too expensive for the products being offered!  There are other locations around town with much much better deals.\nHowever, it does have shelf after shelf of items to look at as you walk through. It borders on sensory overload.
The employees are SOOO rude here. I asked for a chocolate milkshake and the response I got was \"no chocolate shake.\" That's not even a complete sentence....and they want to make $15/hr. Ridiculous!
It's a fun bar with great food and a good atmosphere.   Awesome TV's.  Great place for a pit stop or a party. :)
Try the Pan fried dumplings!
Worst service ever!! dispatchers are rude and cabs have a tendency to \"no show\"
Not sure why this place gets such great reviews. The service was good but the food just ok and the location/atmosphere ok.\nI found the price very expensive as well.\nNot worth it.
In heaven every time I step foot in this restaurant. I can't say enough about Joe's Seafood and I can't think of one entree that I haven't loved! Great lunch menu as well and the seafood salad is to die for!
Very fair.  Went with waiter's recs & shouldn't have. Joe's in Florida so much better.
Some good rolls, a lot of choice!!!  i'll go again for sure... ;)
Pricey but hey..it's Vegas.\nGreat drinks - they're strong and yummy!\nGood selection of songs and nice variety. \nLove the view!!!\n\nPS Check out the bathroom ;)
Bar is amazing.  The Restaurant was sub par for the prices.  I ordered the peppercorn filet and it was encrusted with WHOLE peppercorns which made it inedible.  It should have been stellar for that price point.
The food was great. The view is phenomenal
I just came here for the view but it made enough of an impression that I'd love to come back fro drinks and food. The view is amazing. On par with Ghostbar. Good music, sexy vibe.
We have been here 3 times, and the service has been bad every time. The view is AMAZING, but because of the poor service we will not return.
This is by far and away the finest Greek food I have ever had!  Thank God I found this place as I will be eating there often.  Fantastic flavors, portions were plentiful and the service was wonderful.
I have been coming here for several years and have always had a good experience. This is a family owned business and they all work very hard to make it a great place.
This place is great!  Great food and a great value!  The gyro and chicken plate are out of this world!
Update: the remodel makes this fast food place a much hipper experience. The play area is the same but theres a different seating setup. They also have tvs now. 4 stars.
Customer service is very bad. I wanted to return dog toy which is I never opened  they were so lazy to do it .... I gauss they were mad to me. I don't know...
Rude, that's all i have to stay about the staff and service at this branch.
While visiting with family in Las Vegas, we decided to have breakfast at Mimi's since my uncle recommended it. We were not disappointed, the food and service were great! The pumpkin spice pancakes were awesome!
This location closes early, and on the night I visited they were closed before their posted time.
For a place to have good drinks, play pool, and chill this is the place to go, never really super busy so service is always pretty good. Bluemoon always cold and fresh.
Here at fantastic sams kids are getting there haircuts for the first time here no waiting just walked right in friendly staff I will come again.
Great place to watch the games. Happy hour is perfect and the bar staff rocks ! Thanks
Generally quiet \nComfortable bed\nRenovations needed\nLackluster breakfast\nGreat service very friendly
Restaurant was open but there was no server to be found. So we just walk out and went somewhere else.
Bad Service at the desk.
Picked up a car was fine but I reserved a car to return at different station. All information I received was wrong, I called call center and they gave me wrong info. The number they gave me was useless because takes forever to get LIVE person.
This location is one of the worst! All the way from managment down, they nickel and dime me all the way!  I recommend avoiding this hertz location
It's McDonalds, not a class establishment to begin with. This one was a little dirty and not efficient with it's service. Waited a very long time for food during a not so busy time.
I ate here on dec 12 2013 and got FOOD POISONING . I was sick for 2 days . Friendly service and good sandwiches do not make up for serving bad product to guests.
Absolutely love this place! I work in the same parking lot in which they are located and after learning they have vegetarian options on their menu I decided to give it a try. Their food is always fresh and delicious and the staff is always so sweet!
I reserved a non smoking room and they messed up with that , I ended up getting a smoking room and that was so gross!!!!
Mel is without a doubt the best hard working person there, I'll go back everyday just to receive her amazing customer service.
I love starbucks and i love coffee but here my caramel macchiato shot was burnt and bitter the two times I have been here. So far the only Starbucks that screwed up my drink. I rather just go down the road and find another one a few blocks away.
We're here because pictures on yelp looked amazing but going in person was a whole other experience. Service was bad and fish was not fresh. would never go again
If you are desperate and have no where else to turn. This come close to Chinese food. I suggest going 2 China One in the Smith shipping center. Way better food for similar prices. Actually I am holding back a bit. Call me a snob but Panda is horrible.
Worst nail salon in Summerlin. Do not go here. They will tell you they can do what you want and then they don't do it and try to charge your more than quoted. This place is a joke.
I had a great time at Houdini's Magic Shop. The clerk was very helpful and answered all of my questions. He was a practicing magician too which helped a lot. He really knew his stuff!
Justin is awesome! Very attentive and professional. He has the right staff and his happy hour is phenomenal. This is my first time here and I will definitely come back. Try the soju cocktails, they are to die for.
Wow talk about a good way to go....heart attack in a box for sure but it's soooo good.  If you blink you'll drive right by it.  Patty melt was great, can't wait to try the burgers!
Best place in vegas! Al was a big help , made it so convenient . it was at a great price and got it the next day!  i wont go anywhere else for my banners! this is the place to go! great prices great quality and no shipping cost!
Not bad prices are ok as well:)
Good, quick classic Mexican food!\nNothing fancy, but very tasty.
If you want a great cut...SEE YOLANDA. She is the only person I trust with layers. Perfect everytime! Her shampoo is amazing! The salon is awesome too!!!
A friend told me about this place after my regular hairstylist moved back to Canada. I was very impressed with Molly Rose! She did an awesome job with my cut and color. She is my new go-to-hair expert! I got tons of compliments after going to see her.
A fun stop on a Vegas excursion.  Staff was friendly and patient with a group of newbs.  I chose the glock, tommy gun, and desert eagle 50 cal.  Desert eagle is a monster.  A worthwhile stop when you're in vegas.
Drive thru is super slow. No one in front of us had an order more than 2 drinks. They need to get it together. Go to the Starbucks down the street inside the smiths on windmill and rainbow.
Go to other Radio Shack! This Radio Shack its ok but other ones are better.
Poor customer service they completely suck they ruin your drinks and ruin your experience of going to Starbucks.
Paid for a venti green tea lemonade and got a tall green tea lemonade . Reason why I didn't go back was because I had to go to school was in a rush I wish the girls that always take my orders were there
Um scary...I live really close and only venture in for emergency sports bets..Super smokey and crap food. Skip it and drive to Aliante if in the area.
This is the only place I go for delicious frozen treats. I recommend this awesome place to everyone. Plus I don't deviate from the vanilla custard because it's all I ever crave!
Wasn't impressed sorry delivery was timely delivery guy was very nice but food wasn't good
This place isn't all that. Maybe its cause I went in there to early in the day.  Didn't really look like a great place to party or waste a lot of time in. Although it did have a nice Irish look. But I still won't go back.
I'm not a big club person, so I heard there was an Irish pub in Vegas, I was there on my first night. Good selection of Irish beer. We had HUGE chicken pot pies served in a pail. Soooo good.
We had such a good night here - great atmosphere, fantastic band (who took requests from the floor), a really good Irish dancer and far too much Guinness (a bit pricey but it is Vegas!). We stayed for 4 hours till closing time.
Nice Irish bar but crazy expensive. Worth a visit for a beer and then punch out. They usually have decent live music.
Wonderful place to eat dinner in Vegas!!!  We had a delightful dinner here with live music in the background.  We had to wait to get seated but totally worth it!  Very enjoyable meal.
The names of the dishes and looks may fool you but there is no meat here which is great if your a true vegan or vegetarian. I also love the Taro slush I get one every time with no Boba. Vegan style uses Soy milk.
Veggie Delight very great cooking and good flavor foods, fresh and clean.\nI love it.
I love this place. When I first moved to Las Vegas it was one of the only places I knew of to get vegan food. Took my son back today and he went crazy for his chicken sandwich and banana slush. Still as great as I remember.
I don't typically eat here but my wife likes the slushies they offer.
Happy hour from 2-5pm for slushies and 8-midnight for shakes.
I've been to this location a few times its just OK.. Two other favorite location are on Cheyenne and buffalo as well as the flamingo and Arville location! The half off shakes any time after 8pm is superb! Gotta love their banana ice cream shakes!
My husband recieved an mildewed potato. We told the staff. The manager was no where to be found! be CAREFUL!!!!! EEEKKKKK!!!! :-(
I had a super rude cashier made a huge fuss over a exchange of a broken item. I would have bought but because of her rudeness I did my exchange and left I didn't get her name but on my receipt it says cashier 1271421
Food is too expensive. The quality is too cheap and poorly prepared to justify the outrageous prices. The staff will likely ignore you until they feel like doing their jobs. The worst Panda Express I've ever been to.
Food is great but terrible service.
Very impressed!  Learned a lot about how I run and which type of shoes will help my feet stay happy.  Very friendly and great customer service, also priced well!  Nice couple who are runners own the store, so go there and support a local small business!
Worst Chinese Chicken Salad I ever had! It had 3 small pieces of chicken and was more like a garden salad! Will never go back!
Maria is AMAZING! Super personable and excited to help. Got me in right away. Took her time and made me feel extremely comfortable. The office is clean and pretty. Blows miracle in progress out of the water, I will definitely be returning!
Great sandwiches and great service.  But what's with the no restroom policy?  Isn't it a requirement that a restaurant have a public restroom?  The hand sanitizer thing hanging by the register isn't cutting it folks.
A bit pricey but the subs are so delicious it is hard to resist. I wouldn't say we are regulars but we return every once in awhile.
I love Capriotti's... Just not this location. Dirty restaurant and employees that looked like they were hired right out of a homeless shelter.
Great Service and Friendly staff. In and out quickly. Will go back for additional services when my truck needs it.
Gina was great and I really enjoyed the service - thank you!!!!
Jim and Steve did a great job with my two emission tests.   It was fast and a great price.   Super customer service and a nice clean facility.
I only get the carmel flan...they hit the spot but I've had better...for the $2 price, you can't go wrong with that.
Dr. Camp is unprofessional, money-hungry and does not care about patients or their conditions.
Seems from the reviews that more than my mother-in-law have been screwed over by this location and false reports of damage. I would steer clear or take pictures of every inch of the car, before and after renting.
My husband and I had a bad experience renting a car in La Vegas. They tried to charge us for gas even though we filled up before we returned the car.  We had a receipt so we were able to get it removed. Why should we have to go through the hassle.
Scam. For profit, non accredited scam school. You are better off spending $90.000.00 on mega bucks.
It's for profit University that only graduates 25% UNLV is at 40% Nothing about this place says it anything more scam to line some else pockets.
The service department is a joke do not take your Land Rovers here.
Best sandwich in Vegas! Excellent, friendly service. Worth a visit if you're in the neighborhood.
Two words! Tina Mateo. She makes this place fun to hang out at anytime! The Food and Gaming Specials are great too. Limited graveyard menu as well.
Negative. Food was totally bland until i ate a retadro pepper that burned my tongue so i couldn't tell it was tasteless. Decent delivery time but yea, no.
Yuck! Everything I ordered tasted gross :( I've been here often years before and this was my first time back in over 2 years. I didn't complain. I sucked it up, paid the bill and will never be back. Only good thing about the place- cheap beer.
Mikkie Finnz's sister bar next door. The food is almost as horrible.  The fish and chips suck and so does the whole menu. DO not eat here.
Loved the shepherd's pie.  Waitress was good and attentive.  I love Irish bars.  I think it's best place I have gone to for a place on Fremont Street.
Average burger , salad, beer/bar joint.
We love this place. It is like PF Chang's but less expensive. It is casual dining. Great service and I love that you can see into the kitchen. Get the Pei Wei Card if you go often. You can earn a free entree. Easy take-out too.
I waited forever for our food and it was just two of us. The entrees were incredibly bland. I will probably not return\n\nNice atmosphere though.
Couldn't tell the difference between the orange and the Kung Pau Chicken. The fried rice was mushy.\n\nWon't be going back.
I LOVE CHICKEN WINGS!! My fave is parmesan-garlic!!
Their service has improved tremendously and the staff is very upbeat and proactive.
Dr. Nathan Blanton was the reason I used to go to this location of Mountain West Chiropractic. Since Dr. Blanton is no longer practicing at this office, I stopped receiving treatment here.  I have now have no idea of the quality of treatment this office now provides.
Had one great experience, one terrible and a lot of so so in between. It would help if they didn't  change the entire staff every week.
I will not stay there again.  The train is a deal breaker for me.  The rooms are really nice and the staff is friendly and professional.
Ordered for delivery here because I was at the TownePlace Suites nearby.  Lots of food and the sushi was awesome.  Delivered in less than 30 min on a sat night.
So we arrived there for dinner yesterday after spotting it last week leaving walgreens . Dining room was empty and not one clean table available . Place was dirty so we can only imagine what the kitchen looks like . With that in mind we left and don't plan on ever going back .
I was very happy this time when I went to Hana.  They have the wild salmon back, which is SO amazing!\nThe place is small and fills up fast on any given night.  I love that you can bring your own beer wine and saki.
The service was excellent.  It was very busy so we opted to sit outside. It's byob so that was disappointing. The food was ok. It was certainly edible and the presentation was nice. It just wasn't awesome.
Decent grub, although the grape leaves sucked and the service, while quick, was RUDE. No atmosphere. Much better Med food in the 'burgh.
1 week after being charged the $25 no refund.  We called back today and a \"manager\" will need to call us back.  If that manager doesn't call back today and handle it then we'll have to file a fraudulent charge with our bank against the bar.
Cool spot sitting right above the water outside people watching. Seafood tasted frozed and not fresh never a good look for a seafood spot. Bikers were in the way of the service staff slowed service down a lot. Might return for lunch
Billy's ultimate steam pot and oysters are great. It sits right by the water too.
Nice Location.  Utterly forgettable food.  Insanely slow service.  The place was slow and the waiters just could not have cared less about our group.  Sort of unreal.
Cute place. The service was very good, really nice friendly waitress. The food was good. I had fish tacos, they were tasty. My husband's ribs were very good. My daughter tried the buffalo chicken salad and she really liked it. I would absolutely go here again.
They need to find a better way of washing dishes. Our coffee cups had stains all over, cutlery had pieces of food and had egg smell all over.
This is a great place to grab lunch! They have great soups and sandwich combos and its got a great vibe inside! Love it and will go back soon.
The location is nice and the food is delicious! I got the market fish, which was very good. The meat was so tender. Other yummy dishes were duck and pork.
Good food, service , in a cozy atmosphere.
You can't beat an $8 Indian lunch buffet. However only one of the dishes on the buffet has any meat and it was some overcooked chicken. Besides that the mushrooms were excellent and the staff was friendly. I'll definitely be stopping in again someday.
I went to the new location awhile back and it is okay.  If you like bbq then this place has to be on your list to try in Las Vegas.
Like Denny's, but more overpriced. I enjoyed my carrot apple bundt-shaped muffin and had a nice waitress. No ambiance to speak of, unless Denny's is your game.
Eaten here three times. Each time the food has been fresh and really good. Great service as well.
I like this place! Been coming here for years. Chefs are fun and servers are friendly.  Good food and great price.  Try it.
I miss this place.  Lots of live plants inside, and food that brought me right back home.
Good stuff! Much needed on a hot day!
OK for a Starbucks. It's very busy, which makes it noisy and the staff hurried. The furniture, especially the armchairs, are comfortable and a decent place ti sit and read.
DELICIOIUS!\n\nAnd they even have chopped fresh wasabi.   \n\nI got a roll and a bunch of nigiri, and everything was awesome.\n\nLoves it.
Nice hotel for young people bad experience, dealers were rude made sexual comments about my wife, the operator when i called wouldnt look up my reservation, the food at koi was a joke, Worst Hotel I have stayed in and I go to vegas a lot, dont waste your money
Very poor service it took 6 hours for them to clean up my room. 3 calls and a conversation with the manager ended with him telling me just had to wait and then he insulted me. Will not stay here again
The hotel rooms and hallways are dark and depressing.  Even the elevators are dark and depressing.  The casino is great though. The buffet is awesome.  I think I will stay at the Paris and walk over to gamble and eat at the buffet.
The rooms are so gross and dirty.  I got a skin infection from it.  Really needs updating a  good cleaning.  Very outdated.  Difficult to find anything in the hotel (mainly the gym).  Stay elsewhere.
First time in Vegas and I stayed here. Decent room loved the set up of the gambling floor. Awesome restaurants and friendly staff. I would come here again.
If you are on a salt restricted diet, don't eat here! Everything is over salted and some is actually so salty it is inedible!!!
Must support this shop and stop by whenever i get in town.  Very dope selection with a lot of hype kicks and gear.  I appreciate the staff for being chill and not bothering  when trying to browse.  Get some kicks and   rock'em right,
If you are looking for a funky pair of sneakers, this is the place to go. They have an awesome selection!!!  I will definitely be back.
dang!!!! i love eating with my hands...and IT DOES NOT GET BETTER THAN THIS!!!
King crab legs were great but the place leaves you smelling so bad that its not worth it.
awesooooooome!!!!! ask for noelle!! great service & fantastic food!!
Quick and simple!
The food is wonderful,  the inside is nice, and the service was just okay. Asked for a to go cup for my daughter's thai tea and ended up having to ask another server.
Rachel's Kitchen is a great place to go for lunch. Really small, but nice and quaint.  Great sandwiches, salads, and breakfasts. Pretty healthy too.
Another great Kimpton hotel. Service is top notch. Big pools and 2 hot tubs are a plus
Went to a game. It is always great to see baseball since we don't have a Pro team out here. Good prices on food and beer. Would recommend it for a cheap night out.
I love this place!! Every time I go to Vegas I have to get stop here for lunch. They have the best hot pastrami sandwich! Highly recommended!!
The banh mi here is good, not great like places in OC. The bread and vegetables are fresh. They load too much meat in the sandwiches, which maybe some people will like, but it really should be a balance to be a great sandwich.
Lobster. Grilled. Cheese.  That is all.
Loved it!!!! My boyfriend and I are so happy and could not stop talking about our experience. The food was not the best but it was good and we had nothing negative to say. So romantic and intimate. And great service..
I only ate here once but it was expensive and unremarkable. Generic American food. I would rather grab a burger at In-and-Out.
JULY 29, 2011 == noticed  the restaurant's  sign is gone -- definitely should call before trying to arrange a gathering here!
Great Peking Duck & Chinese Sausage Fried Rice!  Nice restaurant inside and great service.
Love how close this place is to my house, love the Californian dreamin chicken sandwich! This place has a friendly staff and is kept clean. I have been here a bunch of times and have never been disappointed!!
Great portions , fresh food , amazing customer service ! Very convenient parking and great area one of my favorite spots
I have found my new nail spot! Jenny was my nail girl 3 years ago and we lost touch when she moved. So happy I found her, she is amazing!
You wont get atmosphere, you wont get 5-star service, but you will get the best deal on food in town.  Its all about $5 for the best gyro and fries (and drink) in town.  Nuff said.
Wow, cougar city!  This must be where all divorcees end up going to find their next husbands.
awesome lanes, always busy, always clean... I think the cashier could be happier but hey, its a bowling alley.
I moved here from Chicago in July of 2011. and  i have to say this was one the best movie theaters i have been to  in a very long time,  love the decor there, price are no higher than any other theater. i would recommend this place to anyone.
Great sports bar! Really friendly service and clientele. The quesadillas are slammin!
Great dive bar! Great people! Tempes best dive bar!
Worst place ever! Their nasty karaoke singer who is a regular, physically assaulted my brother-in-law and the bartenders did not care! There was no manager or owner on staff! This place is managed horribly and I do not recommend it to anyone!
Had a great breakfast.  Bagel was good, too, and I'm not a bagel fan. Impressive bakery selection.
Excellent food! Tasty and filling ... comparable to Chipotle with some items that are not available there.
Best pho place in az.
get their veggie combo.\n\ngreat place to buy feta and olives!\n\nthe rosewater lemonade is so refreshing!\n\nsweet owners!
Amazing!  I'm here for a few short weeks from NY and I was recommended this place by a guy i met at an antique shop.  Superb!!  Everything fresh and delicious.
Everything that I've tried has been simply delicious! The sweetest people work here, and although it gets a bit busy during the popular lunch and dinner hours, it's so worth the small wait. :D Go! Right now! :) haha
I really like this place !!! The taste is good but I like people there. The servers look like they are brothers but all are very quiet but kind and don't bother you with over kindness. And their boba tea is the best in town !!!!
Honeydew boba is so yummy. I've had better pho.  Servers are nice
Drove around 30 trying to get some doughnuts found this place and my wife asked if they had sugar free doughnuts , the lady told us we had the wrong place in a hella rude attitude...
Miss eating here. Yummy food! and always fresh since they have there own veggie garden
Loved this place.  Burgers are awesome.  Especially with the baked potato fries.  Loved sitting outside.  Great family place.
Excellent breakfast and a fun place to go with kids! We have only ever had breakfast here, and on their breakfast menu the waffles amazing! The breakfast tacos and scramble bowls are excellent too.
Was an Ok experience, love the picnic tables however not the dirt.  Not sure there is much you can do about the flies being outside.  Would really like to see an area to refill coffee instead of standing in line at the food window behind several people
By far, one of my favorite places to eat in the East Valley! The food is always delicious, and the veggies are so fresh! The milkshakes may be pricey but well worth it!
Best start to my days and always a favorite amongst visiting family and friends. Can't beat the cupcakes or breakfast! Also a great place to drink coffee, relax, hangout or study.
Ew. There's always a blonde girl working in the kitchen with her hair down and I found a piece of hair in my food. I'm sorry but that's just gross. Also there was flies everywhere. The place has potential but needs to work on a few things
Food was bad, service was non existent (we had to go find our server to ask for our check), restaurant was ambienceless. No wonder it was 90% empty when we walked in.
Great little neighborhood spot.  Great breakfast and good sandwiches for lunch.  We have been there 20+ times with no issues and good food each time.
I heard the food is good. I will visit very soon
Cheerful service for an early Monday morning at the airport. Too bad the food is awful - beans, cheese, tortilla - how hard is that? (and expensive for what you get, too!) Better choice: a $5 banana & water fountain sip. Pass.
Very busy. Pricey... $14 for a margarita ...that wasnt the greatest. Food is ok... I wouldnt call it authentic.... place was packed grab a seat when you can...even if it is dirty.
Not great, but it is an airport.
I'm afraid the genius of Wing Lei's tastes and textures was too subtle for my over-stimulated palette. Had the duck tasting menu and enjoyed a few of the dishes but didn't find any remarkable.
Extremely loud. The smoked turkey sandwich bread was dry. Pear salad was good usual.
Average show worth the price of free if you can get them. Juggler comedian was the highlight.
Friendly staff and I come here for the $5 gyro sandwich lunch special. Someone else ordered meatball and pasta and has been very content.
I tried a simple cupcake. The vanilla cupcake was moist however the buttercream icing was hard, possibly old and enough to turn me off. I may try this place again if I'm in the area but I won't make a special trip.
Love this place! Friendly staff. Good prices. Lots of \"locals\" constantly in here. Great desserts and cakes that are never frozen. Red Velvet Cake was incredible! And now they have DONUTS?!
I usually get the Pad Thai and spring rolls. The soups are fantastic and quite authentic but are huge portions. Not the prettiest setting but definitely some of the more authentic Thai food in the Phoenix area.
I don't quite get this place or why Asians love it, but it is very good :)
Absolutely love this place. A locally owned pizza place that has been here for years. I love the nuclear fries with ranch dressing. Speaking of ranch dressing they make it themselves and sell it by the bottle. I personally like the pizza cut in squares. By far the best pizza in town!
Bertha's Cafe Just opened up at it's new location, 32nd street and Indian School Rd.!!!!!  I have been going through withdrawl!!! So happy they are open.
We had the seafood pancake and tofu pot.  Tofu was good, seafood pancake was lousy.  Lots of koreans so that does not say much\n\nservice was so so.
Great service and friendly staff! We ordered the short ribs and spicy pork. They were both flavorful and tender. We also go 6 side dishes to go with our lunch!
Excellent food. Excellent service. Comfortable family restaurant. Highly recommend even if you have never tried Korean food before.
My favorite place in Pittsburgh. The Craig street location has a great bar.
Loved it!  Food was fantastic and the restaurant and bar were very comfortable...good balance of trendy and casual.
8 times out of 10, I love this place! Occasionally they'll mess up an order but are good about getting it fixed. Also the service is slow sometimes, but other than that.. everything is tasty! It's also a really cool place to sit outside & enjoy the view!
Wonderful place for burgers.   The trio was a great way to try 3 different options.   Tyson our waiter was wonderful.   He took care of everthing we needed and in a timely fashion.  We will be back again soon.
This has to be the best place on the strip to get your gourmet burger fix.  I have been coming to Stripburger for years & i have never been disappointed with their food and service. I highly recommend the cheesy fries.
Pretty good subs.
Just wanted something quick and gave this place a try.\nIt was ok because I was hungry and service was good.\nStill cant beat the sushi at takamatsu which is only yards away down the street.
Expensive compared to other thai restaurants. Service is bad. Run away if your server is \"Yok\". She scares me.
Great Gelato with plenty of flavors, try the hazel nut.
Went yesterday with a girlfriend... got 4 different cupcakes.  Yummy!  I highly recommend the chocolate marshmallow :)
Cupcakes and frosting shots, oh my!  This place is always busy and I think its the cupcakes.  My absolute favs are the Cinnamon and Red Velvet cupcakes!  I can't wait for the Pumpkin cupcakes that come out in the fall.
ok they ae jopen but rareley on time  the woman on duty even as waitress  is the worst waittres  i have ever expere in my life dont shop her awful sevice
great food reviews on www.bigtsreviews.com
Nice Happy Hour spot in downtown Phoenix. Their Sunday brunch is good as well. Kind of a small establishment,. Nice friendly staff.
The food is terrible. We went for happy hour and get the caprese and the calamari. The caprese was like eating diced tomatoes that had been stewing in something. The calamari was small and predominately breading.
The barbacoa could use some actual spice and it's a little expensive.
Oh my gosh!  Hot dogs-great; onion rings-great; chili cheese fries-great; 50 cent soft serve cones-awesome.  Just want to add that so far there hasn't been anything that we've tried here that we haven't liked.
It was ok.  Had better
this place has teenagers running the place! Customer service is horrible! You are often greeted with attitude and a 15 min way on drive through with no car in front of you
Galleria mall is the last decent locals mall.
This is probably the best mall in Las Vegas ! \nIt has a wide stores selection and great prices.\nThey have an amazing restaurants and great women's care places. This is my favorite mall.
Good, large burger (got Paris one)\nAvg. fries\nAwesome milkshake!\n\nGot $30 groupon and really enjoyed it!
Good selection of machines, comfortable environment and down to earth, friendly people.
Its okay place, but I recommend go eat at the Palms for late night food, the Palms is cheaper and taste better.\n\nLate.
Really good Ahi Tuna steak, especially if you're drunk and need something to even out the alcohol. Servers are nice and quick.
Always need more check outs in the morning.
Kevin and his team did a great job of getting our sunscreens up on our house with a tight deadline. They were professional and at the end stated if there is anything you find that needs attention, don't hesitate to call.
The food was good, but was way over-priced (reminded me of Dardanelles on Monroe Street). \n\nDecor is cool though.
I usually go here instead of the Surprise Walmart because it seems less crowded and is closer to me. I don't like that they don't have self-checkouts here though. Sometimes I've had to wait in line for awhile when I only had a few items.
Love to watch movies and I love this theatre.  They have tons of options all of the time and really large theatres which makes it nice.  Always clean and lots of variety.
Take and bake sign was small and hard to see, out of towers , talked to staff about visiting nothing mentioned about cooking it, the establishment seemed to have some cooking facilities, but staff was no help, very poor questioner service.
Got very, very, sick off the french dip.  Service was without a smile. Long wait.  Would not recommend.
Great food, awesome service from Ramon. Appetizer, main course, and desert all perfect. The menu looks so good we are already talking about returning and discussing what we want to try. I don't know how this place remained elusive for so long.
This place is drowning my food with canola oil! Yikes! Heart attack awaits me, if I continue to eat here!
Went there for lunch today and had a very good turkey and brie sandwich.
Delicious Chicago Vienna Beef juicy hot dog with the works, and made from scratch french fries for $4. Best deal in town. Thanks for reading. The Bike Chaplain
This is the best dry cleaner I have found. They do a great job and have a very convenient pick up service. Their representatives are always professional and courteous. I would recommend them to anyone.
Overpriced and nothing special. Tried it twice in a year. Money better spent elsewhere.
Great food,  great service and a place to watch World Cup games at lunch time during work hours. I had the three taco platter with shrimp,  pork,  and beef.  All were very good.  The salsa at the salsa bar was a nice addition.
This is a big place.. but rooms are just okay.. a bit outdated.. i had ants in my bathroom..
Place sucks...long lines poor customer service. First u stand in a amazingly long line to get the fabric cut and then a equally long line for checkout... darn my kids art project.....
You will never leave here hungry!  Such generous portions and great prices!
The dresses are wonderful and they range from xs to 3x. \n\nHowever, it is a painful experience every-time I shop there. The sales clerks are just too cool to help me.
We made a special trip to the store, so after fighting strip traffic, 30 min. trying to find parking and another 20 min. walking we made it there. \nThe staff was very nice and helpful. But the clothes were pretty ill fitting so with sadness I left empty handed.
I have never been to a store ran by a bigger bunch of assholes in my whole life. I'd feel better having abandoned hygiene for a week and going to a Ferrari dealer.
Of all the Lodges, this one has the best bartenders and servers. All others have left a bad taste in my mouth. This location is awesome and will recommended to anyone.
I'm so sad that they closed this place down and turned it into a Mexican cantina. They had the best tapas and sangria happy hour in Las Vegas!
The check in process took way too long which caused us to miss the show. The show itself was fine, but not worth more than 10 dollars.
Short and to the point: The food is good. Littleneck clams as steamers for about $11 a dozen. Moose Drool on tap.
Awesome desserts , wide variety , decent price!
All-you-can-eat Fish Fry is the way to go.  Friday nights.  Hot, fresh and quick.  Late-night is the best.
I was pretty bummed when the Phoenix location closed.  You can always get a hearty breakfast here.  I like the spicy in-house sausage - biscuits and gravy on the side and you are talking my language.
Maybe this even deserved just one star. The bread's are just a bit better than mediocre and the sandwiches are, well, sandwiches
I never knew this was the name of the place until Saturday morning at 3:30am. o.o Oops! \n\nNot the nicest looking place inside, but it's kept very old school.\n\nGot that Drai's inside!
Pretty pricey and the food is just o.k. I have eaten there a few times and every time I came away thinking it wasn't worth the money. There are way better options in Pittsburgh
Low key atmosphere, on Mondays they have $5 burgers when you buy a $3 beer, great deal and great food.
The food alone it's worth the trip !
Nicer decor and feeling than you might expect in a \"local casino\" I tried their most popular roll sampler and a sweet/spicy beef stir fry dish. I'd go here again, and glad to have something like this out in this part of Summerlin.
Fast and friendly service. Had a yelp voucher and they were happy to accept it. Fair priced and the sushi rolls were yum! Would recommend.
Came with friends and had a great time.  Food was amazing.  Service was good. Will be back.
They don't put the price on their drinks and the margarita was 15 dollars. Service was slow, food was okay.
Darts and beer. Can't say much else.
I'm impressed with this Pizza - Mozzeralla, Provolone blend, just enough provolone to make it enhanced - The Service was Excellent!  In the past I have been unimpressed with this place... Yesterday they were ON!!!
have to ask for refills and waitress just stands around after taking your order everyone walks around with an attitude and its depressing and horrible service.  this will be the last time I come here
Went with a family group of 12 and no one had anything good to say about their meal.
They definitely need to work on customer service. I probably won't eat sushi for a year after dining here.
I had not been to Bev Mo for a long time and when walking around I remembered why this place is so overpriced.  Save yourself some money and head over to Total wine plus a lot better craft beer selection.
They have a nice assortment of music on the weekend.  The drink menu is comprehensive, we were happy with what was offered. Spacious and we were comfortably seated - much nicer than so many other bars around town.  \nIt reminded us of a cruise ship.
Extremely disappointed. Enough said.
Very pricy for the quality of food you get...definitely don't come here for the service.
Hit this place at Bally's a couple of times for their breakfast buffet. Good price. Not a huge selection, but the scrambled eggs and biscuits & gravy are both very good.
Run don't walk away from the express breakfast buffet. Way overpriced for inedible food. I've had better free hotel continental breakfasts. This place is horrid.
Wanted to try this place since it had the shortest wait time... well now I know why.. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing, but the black pepper chicken didn't have much flavor at all.. I was very disappointed and will not be coming back.
The menu is minimal and the burgers are solid.  Quick and easy.
Looking for simple then it's all about In-N-Out. Service is always good and quick. Got a double-double with some animal style fries and it was pretty satisfying.
Target is OK, nothing stood out to me on the shopping trip. Had a nice selection and well lit aisles.
I had a burger here, yes a burger at a sushi place kinda weird huh? It was amazing spicy and amazing.  Trust me please trust me.
Fantastic burgers, I really like the exotics!  Sweet potato fries are great.  Wait staff has always been happy and polite.
Phoenix airport and the whoppers here are delicious!  Service without a smile sucks though.
Took 10 minutes to get a sandwich. Corned beef sandwich was supposed to be hot. It was cold. Asked for a bagel to not be toasted. They toasted it. Corned beef was dry, might have been frozen. Never going back.
The bagels are so-so, which is not a great thing if you're called \"The Bagel Factory.\" The atmosphere is nice and so are the people.
Food was good but nothing special. Portions are small. For what you pay you are better off going somewhere else. Will never go here again.
I loved this experience! They offer an iPad with a self guided video tour filled with facts about Paris, France. The view is amazing. We stayed to watch the fountain show below (Bellagio) and the staff was great.
Enjoying an amazing birthday dinner with family and friends... With a sushi feast to make the gods green with jealousy!
Great beer selection but as far as the food and service goes maybe we were there on a bad day. After ordering we waited forever for the food to arrive and once it did it was cold.
Word to the wise, order your burger well done here. You and your toilet will be thankful. \n\nP.S. Employees handling food should always wash their hands.\n\nThat's all I am going to say.
We headed here on Saturday night.  I like the concept and the food sounded tasty.  I was also excited based on the reviews.  Unfortunately, the food for our large group trickled out  slowly, and it was only mediocre.  The server was kind, but overall not a good experience.
Sad to hear this beats the other Italian joints in the city. However, the place is good and worth a visit. Strange layout - we sat upstairs and I had a wonderful view of a balcony wall that could have been much shorter or a railing.
Food was marginal. I had a chicken taco plate and burrito that was flavorful and could have been worth the very long wait if their wasn't better available nearby. Nothing special here folks. Glad we didnt move to Ahwatukee for the food.
Thought it was pretty ridiculous when I asked for no meat- just beans, and the cashier said that would be an extra charge because it's considered making a 'substitution.' Pretty poor customer service in my opinion. I hope the GM reads this and corrects the problem.
Number 36 burrito you can't go wrong.Been going there since 82 and they haven't lost a step!
Good food, horrible customer service. I continue to give them business because it's close to work but otherwise I wouldn't bother. Nothing like being treated crappy while spending your hard earned money. Several of my co-workers have had the same experience.
wow....this was a fantastic experience
I wish the delivery guys would stop using my neighborhood like a race track.
Love this place! The ladies are pleasant here. Say hi to Jordan and Ashley when you get in and they'll take care of ya. Once you get the hang of this place and how it works, you will realize how the services will help you maintain a nice and healthy life.
The owners and service is very nice here. I come here regularly and I can always expect everybody to be incredibly friendly. The food is also exceptional.  From crab legs to fried fish, the restaurant is sure to offer a high quality meal for a reasonable price.
Prices reasonable and quick service.  I had samin, which was really tasty and received a good portion. I would have preferred it served in a bowl to enjoy at the location than a deep styrofoam cup.  And Hawaiian music would have been nice to hear in the background.
Just went here the other night. Solid food. Awesome Belgian beer.
This is my goto restaurant for moules and frites.  The beer selection is quite large and kind of $$.  Wine list is really good!  Stop by, you'll love it.
I've been here many times because its close to where I Live.\nThe menu is stale and the same old thing.\nThe food is pretty good (nothing special)\nBut is definitely overpriced.\nGood luck
Ordered a New York hot pastrami sandwhich on rye bread. not even close . it was alright, but not great. there bagels are delicious tho. I guess coming from nyc makes it hard to like the pastrami here :(
Great breakfast spot! Casual atmosphere and good food. Veggie Benny is YUM!
Definitely a good place to grab a quick breakfast. Also a decent meeting spot for business breakfasts and lunches. Personally, I think you can do better with the food but all around it is a bad joint.
ugh. mediocre at best.
Old school Vegas feel! Love it! Delicious food!!!! One of my favorite steakhouses in the country!
When I visit Madison, Swagat is always on my list of restaurants. Always fantastic! Always friendly!\n\n/
Came here with a couple of friends on a Saturday, the layout of the club is nice but the place is too packed, lots of older folks and couples as well. as far as the music goes it was okay but I left after 30 minutes.  Waste of 30 dollars in my opinion.
I was not impressed. The cover was $30 for ladies and $40 for guys. Seriously? I don't have a problem paying cover, but $30 is excessive. I ended up just heading over to a lounge that was also located in the Luxor instead.
Pretentious, over crowded, rude, bad... terrible.  No.  So many better options.
Food is delicious. I had the Vegenini, it is like a vegetarian pizza. I loved it. The potato fries are also delicious. Customer service is always friendly.
Hard to believe this place is right down the  strip from treasure island. Great Thai food and really cheap prices.Be prepared to wait around lunch or dinner times as the place is small. Must try..
The service here is so slow. I order ed my food at 430 Pm and its still now done. Hurry up.
Had a great time here. Drinks are about $14 each so be ready. But the atmosphere was great. They get some really good talent spinning here too. Not a dance floor per se, but we did plenty of dancing (as did everyone else).
Had their breakfast burrito (without sausage) and it was amazing, and the price was reasonable too.
I had the ribeye boneless medallions.  It was three different meats!  natural angus, bison and  American wagyu medium cooked.   It definitely made my top ten list in the steak department.
Our two steaks were raw in the middle. Not rare but raw. Around us other diners were calling the wait staff over for the same reason. Over cooked I can see - but serial raw? Horrible.
O M G. I think I died and went to Wagyu Beef heaven... Steak is amazing, service is awesome, food portions make it worth the price!! I'm coming back!!!
Very average.  The big eye app was not fresh.  The Kobe beef carpaccio was flavorless and seemed like it might have been seared.\n\nI left it at that before diving into a very overpriced steak
Update: As of 9 June, Memphis Best is only open Thursday-Saturday, 1100-2000. Gunny says they're shifting their emphasis to catering over the summer. Whether he'll go back to Mon-Sat in the fall remains to be seen.
bunky provides something unique downtown that i desire. \n\nthere is a small selection, hence boutique, but it is all amazing. my first visit was at least an hour, going through each item of clothing, each with its own personality. the accessories are amazing.
Free entrance if you print coupon from their website
Really enjoyed myself at the Auto Collections! The cars are beautiful, and there are so many of them! \n\nPrice is reasonable (12.50 I believe).\n\nWould recommend to anyone who loves old cars!
The caramel ones were heaven on earth, but I agree with the other Yelpers that the standard brownie is on the dry side.\n\nI still have quite a few flavors to sample, but from what I have seen so far, they are not worth the price point.
Mac n Cheese was damn good. Homemade bleu cheese was even better. Service was a little weak, but overall the dive bar/ lounge atmosphere and great beer selections are solid.\n\nWish they would expand the menu
I ordered Pho dac biet and it phokin sucked!! Only thing that was decent was the eggrolls. Decor was nice but food thumbs down!
Don't come here. They are out of everything by 6pm. Staff seemed angry the place was full. Pork chop was cooked enough for a whole pig.
This place sucks.  The brother of the current owner owns LOLOs Chicken and Waffles.  Go to LoLos.  If you want to experience reverse racism as a white person go to the Golden Rule.  Complete ahole is running his mother's landmark into the ground.
Don't understand the hype about this place. Went in today only to be disappointed.  Nothing spectacular.
THIS is my NEW favorite restaurant in Goodyear!  GREAT service, love the bartenders they are very attentive!  THE food is another plus. YOU won't be disappointed.
They keep deleting my negative review that the SharpStone grinders they have are knockoffs and they only acknowledge this if you inquire directly if they are knockoffs.  They sell them as if they are true SharpStone grinders.
I love this theater !!!  $2 Tuesday's Cheap popcorn and soda and there seats are so comfortable!!
a new found fav of mine... try something different
Good place to go to is your looking for a casual, fun night out while stumbling back to you hotel.
This place is terrible. The whole idea of the place is dumb; I'm not paying overpriced prices for bad service, bad jokes, and to be seated on a bench with other couples. I left before I ordered.
Terrible food! Terrible!!! Over priced diner food. Dry, chewy, garbage. Super suburban restaurant that tries to be silly and fun but it's just generic and terrible. If I had 20 thumbs they'd all be down.
casual. loud. ghetto. creeps and cheap half naked Butter-faces (everything is good but her face!!). \n\new never again.
Food and drinks were decent for what you pay and not horrifically overpriced. Service wasn't bad. Compared to other places I've tried in Vegas, I'd go back. Nice atmosphere.
Bad food below average service. Need to be lit to eat at this place. It will help
Good time, really good food.  Nice view of the strip.
gosh, Charlotte must have low standards in sushi. This place was fairly terrible. Threw away 80% of my order. Salmon should have a taste and rice should be white, not 50 shades of gray.
Although the customer service was super pleasant, the sub sandwiches were not.  They are great for a drunk person that just has the munchies but not the place if you are looking for quality.
Birthday party for my son and a bunch of his buddies. The boys really enjoyed the arcade games and all of them said that the food was great. Our waitress Jessie was awesome!!
Arcade for adults! If you have nothing to do, Dave and Busters is the place to go, they have games, you can grab a drink or something to eat. This location is really great on service. One bartender was doing tricks, pretty awesome.
A really good sushi bar in this tro of asian restaurants in the Benihana Village.  I had lunch here during CES week and despite the large crowds, service was still very good and the food outstanding.
First time visitor.  Food was very good.  Service was very slow.
SO FREAKING GOOD! Honestly the best BLT I've ever had. When we go to Vegas this is always one of the first places we have to eat. It's cheap and really good.
American sandwhich was really good, cranberry sauce, awesome cheese, hot sandwhich
Inside Planet Hollywood casino.  I went inside sometime during the week and it there was no line, ordered the Full Montagu, nice crispy toasted bread over the roast beef/turkey, such goodness!! $5.99 decent price for the taste/value.
Come here and grab a sangwich before you pre-game and then again after hoeing around in the club! the original and the tuna melt... that's maaaah faaavorite!!! enjoy!
Delicious hot sandwiches,  opened 24 hours, what more do I need to say?\n\nOh, get the meatball sandwich! SO GOOD!
When I am in the mood for a good sandwich- I will drive 20 minutes to get to the strip, struggle with traffic and parking and walk through a casino just to get to Earl of Sandwich.  Prices are good and every sandwich I have had there is fantastic.
Probably the best place to eat at the dead of night in Las Vegas. Cheap sandwiches ($6-7) and open 24 hours.\n\nNothing really bad to say. Drunk food or sober food, both great and at any time of the day.
You've got to eat here if you are down on your luck and need a cheap meal to pick you back up.  We walked all the way down the strip just to eat here.
Loved the tuna!
Words cannot describe the great flavors of their items. This is a 'must try' place.
Best Sandwiches ever!!! You will love it....
I went there with some friends and we all liked it. My wife and i had a vegetarian sandwich called a Caprese, my daughter had an italian and my friend had the Montagu. They were very inexpensive for the strip but i was hungry after my sandwich.
The best sandwiches that I have ever had, hands down.  This shop is actually a big reason that we book our rooms at Planet Hollywood.  Breakfast sandwiches are amazing.  We actually go to restaurants for drinks and then to Earl of Sandwich for dinner.  :)
The prices are typical Strip inflated. $3 for a bottle of water. The sandwich cost more than twice the cost at Subway, an the flavor was almost 10% of the flavor/quality of the typical Subway sandwich. I won't consider returning
I've had waaaay better sandwiches. It's perfect for the late night \"smokers\" that don't care about what the food taste like as it is shoveled into their face eyes closed.
LOVE the Thanksgiving sandwich - I'm obsessed with it, actually! I really wished we had one in SCV! Even if I'm not hungry and there's one nearby, I will pick up one of those bad boys and take it home for later!
This place has really gone downhill in the last year. Customer service is bad & the sandwiches are just ok. They do make a pretty good salad but I just can't get past the attitude of some newer employees. I don't want these knuckleheads anywhere near my food.
I do not know how this place is one of the highest rated places in LV. The sandwich is small and can no way be fresh like they claim it is. Do not waste your time in their 20-30 minute line. Marginal at best.
Awesome sandwiches, very affordable. We came here for a quick lunch and it was pretty damn good. It's kind of a food court atmosphere which i didn't care for but, if your just looking for an affordable meal or lunch on the vegas strip this place is great.
Disappointed in this sandwich bar.  I had a salad which was ok - nothing to brag about.  I was disappointed that the menu only had hot subs - no cold sandwiches.
yummmmm.. hot and toasty
OMG! The full Montague is the best sandwich ever!! Perfect amount of everything. Highly recommend the macaroni and cheese as well; its worth the money!
I thought it was a little expensive for a salad in a box that I ordered from a counter and ate outside because it was so packed inside.  It was a good salad though.  I think I will try some other places on my find out where to eat lunch tour before I go back here.
I had my wedding reception here and it turned out amazing! Lalana was great with every aspect of planning my wedding. The food was amazing, the service everything! I was so happy I chose to have my reception here, it made our day even more unforgettable!
Chicken parm was just average. Field greens salad was great. Wait staff was great. The seating is right under the blue sky and in front of a large fountain in the Forum Shops.
Service is not so great. Took long to make my order no waitress in sight for 15 mjn. Eggplant crisps are good. Margarita pizza came without basil tho :( Once fixed was good. My Italian soda never received.
It works, don't expect more or less than food court food from your local shopping mall.
The display was great. That's why I wanted to try. But the taste is totally awful. The pepperoni pretzel doesn't even taste like pretzel. Oily and tasteless.  It tasted like uncooked dough. Totally a waste of money.
Love the staff, love the beer, love the patrons.
Traveling through town and found this brewery.  They had a good selection of beer and I really enjoyed the fish tacos.
Finally popped by here for the Gail Ambrosius anniversary party. The place is gigantic. It was also really packed and parking was a pain. The beer is always good, I would have tried the food but the wait was too long. Will definitely be back.
Quick and tasty Chicken Sandwches. Nothing special
I was not expecting great sushi from a location that was formerly a Village Inn.   Fortunately the VI is long gone and the sushi was very good.    \n\nIts better than most of the other sushi places around and not too hard on the wallet.
I would give it a zero if I could brings a very unsightly crowd to a good area.
The steak here was not worth the price at all....i really don't have much to say about this place besides stay away.  Its not worth your money or time...however the decorations inside were very nice.
Good Pho, open all the time.
This place wasn't for me. Had the mexiwrap, zucchini pasta and Acai bowl. The Mexican wrap was my favorite amongst the other dishes, however when I got home I started feeling sick and ended up throwing up. Not coming back.
Our favorite local steakhouse. Went on Friday night to celebrate my husbands birthday. Adam the manager took great care of us and the food was great.
Food not that good, fair price though. I ordered a chocolate and is way too sweet! You can't even take 2 or three bites because you will get sugar rush.
Easy accessible target, always clean and neat. It has the light rail right across. An open not cluttered place. Probably my favorite target here in central Phoenix.
Meh... \n\nSuper slow going southbound in the morning. I've discovered I can get to work quicker on surface streets, which are no picnic.\n\nDecent ride when it's not rush hour.  Nice view through the mountains.
Had decent food, but shitty service. Never returning.
The layout of the parking lot is not that great especially the first intersection you come to entering from McClintock.  The stores are good though and there is good variety to satisfy most of your needs.  Clean shopping center with good stores.
Awesome place if you want to almost get hit by a car. An 8 year old can put together a more functional parking area.
I avoid this mall.  I hate parking here, and trying to get in and out is always a hassle.
I have been here many times but the place seamed different this time.  The veggi portions were tiny.  The meat seemed tough and the waitres was less than accomedating.  I think I will have to find a new place in town......what a shame.
Worst service I have ever encountered.  Passive waiters and terrible manager.  With 2 kids in tote, you would think we could have had faster service!    Would NEVER go back.
Best show I've seen... amazing stage show, great re-mix of timeless beatles songs... great looking dancers :-)
Excellent costumes amd great music however the show lacked the wow factor generally associated with cirque du soleil performances. Additionally there was minimal acrobatics and a weak storyline.
Just an ok show. Not worth the time and money!\nA live band would have been better otherwise we could just stayed home and listened to our CDs. \nLots of dancers and I guess they tried to describe the songs, but they look so disorganized on stage!
The rice is fluffy, the salsa is perfectly mild, the green corn tamale is wonderful. The service is fast and friendly.
I loved the molcajete! The margarita was really good as well, and it sneaks up on you.. i could barely make it to the car!
The pizza is good, but the pasta is outstanding. Nice quaint family outing place, or a great place to take a date for a private dinner. They, also, offer some good salads.
A GREAT show...THANK YOU ASU Marching Band !!
Ok tacos and margaritas.  Nothing to write home about
Tequila tasting can we taste some tequila next time.. was a fun experience but the tequila wasn't even a half a shot
Authentic Chinese spicy food. when I say spicy, I mean it. The heat here is not for the faint of heart. Everything is very good. I would recommend bringing a Chinese friend to help navigate the menu.
Eat here every couple of weeks, food is good, not great , but good.  It is consistent and the portions are adequate
I like it hear. Had the perfect breakfast. Two eggs sunnyside up, a slice of french toast, and FOUR turkey breakfast sausage. It was the right amount and delish.
I don't understand all the good reviews here. The hibachi here is like avg mall food court quality. I guess if you want quantity over taste, this place does ok then.
Love this place, their coffee drinks ROCK (esp. the Cafe Roma!) and their sandwiches and salads are TO DIE!! Awesome joint!!
I guess I agree with the 3 star rating the place currently has. I like the concept, love local joints, enjoyed their assortment of teas and wines, but that is about it. The service, timing, and environment needs work.
Usually a good selection of brew .. Mostly California and other West Coast breweries. Food above average.  \nService tonight was very good but I have been there when it's slow.\nWe'll be back.
Decided to try this place for after dinner drinks with wifey. They have a good selection of brews and an overall cool place to hang out.  Didn't have a chance to check out the food menu. Place is worth a visit for drinks or just hanging out.
Pepper jack lobster and shrimp tacos blue corn tortilia black beans and rice, very cold beer! Good service.
Simply Amazing!
Swanky place, good atmosphere & food, right in the heart of Madison's cultural center. A great place to meet friends for food & drinks, even catch the game @ the bar.
We rolled up on Tuesday before 8 pm and it was closed!  WTH!  I was starving and now I can't try you BBQ!
Heart Bar holds a special place in MY heart.  Why?  Because I met a 14-large bachelorette party at this bar.  Needless to say, it was a perfect weekend.  \n\nNote: Unless you're looking for hookers, avoid this place after 1am.
good atmosphere.. Reasonably priced... attentive staff.. can get busy...
Riki and John are two of the best bartenders in Vegas. The bar is loud, fun, and great drinks.
Another disappointment in a meat market here in Las Vegas. They don't even butcher their own meat. They are no better than a supermarket and not as good as Whole Foods. I would love to find a true butcher here in Las Vegas.
Room was ok...nothing special. Staff was nice. Parking garage was very spooky! Pools were not impressive to me. There is an adult store right across the street....weird & creepy. Very convenient location but I won't stay here again.
Excellent lunch buffet.  Amazing food.  Great service.  Clean.  Reasonably priced. Kids had never tried Indian food until today and LOVED it.  Will definitely be back!
Love love the food, the services super nice and the favors right on.  I suggest you guys try it out.
Koi Crispy Rice and Sparkling Sake!
This place closed down. Now it is a Thai Basil.
Good hotel for Batchlorette parties. The suits are nice, the extra room when sharing a room with four girls is a luxury.
The best buffalo chicken wings in town! Who could have imagined that a fish place would have amazing wings. They bake them first and then flash fry them. You gotta try them :-)
No longer open for lunch.
Funny, the same stuff gets executed much better here than in Atlanta's NW location, which I reviewed a few weeks ago.  Service was fine here too.
Friendly comfortable and food was great. Would have given 5 stars if they had wine or beer, but they said they were working on that.
great deep dish pizza and this is from an ex Chicagoan.  Casual surroundings and pleasant servers.  Their salads are XL and recommend the house dressing.  Deep dishes naturally take longer to make so call in and order before you show up even for dine in.
I come to Las Vegas once a year and this is the only place I go to for pizza!  The atmosphere and service are great and the food delicious.
Was really looking forward to eating here but was so disappointed. I ordered chicken Marsala and I got chicken swimming in basically soup. It was just terrible. Guess I should have stuck with the pizza.
Pizza was good, a little pricy for pizza. Hubby was disappointed they don't serve beer, or coffee. Decent service just wasn`t expecting to spend $100+ on wings and 2 pizzas.
My favorite local wine shop....great people, great staff and GREAT wine! I think everyone should check it out...worth the drive to lovely Cave Creek!
If you have a spare $100 and are not real hungry go here. Long wait,poor service very average food at best but hard to tell when it comes out cold
Live this place!!! My favorite thing to have here is blackened Puerto rican mahi, it's so tasty...I'm only allowed to eat fish once a week but if I could I would eat here everyday.
The food was not only fresh and amazing, but the service was 10 star worthy! Our server Matt went above and beyond and above again to make sure our experience was top notch!
i love how late this place opens, as most places are in Vegas. Lots of taiwanese food, but unfortunately, the food tastes so-so. the only reason i went back multiple times is because they serve stinky tofu, a dish very hard to find in the Southeast.
Nice employees, Salad Bar is good Deserts are ok but damn for almost $12.00 I could have had a better meal at Denny's which is where I will go next time I think I want to eat here.
Great place to get cold drinks and really good bar food! Bartenders are amazing and always friendly! Plenty of TV's to catch any game you wish! Can't go wrong here!
Some of the best pizza I have found since moving out to Las Vegas
Just a shout out for Ginger Luke and the outstanding creativity she has for designing hair! She is the only one that my 15 yr old daughter, Madisson, will let touch her hair.  Thanks for listening and loving what you do! :)
Don't go here, the bartenders are rude!!!
Excellent tri-tip quesadilla and brisket.  Too-die-for sweet biscuits and honey butter.  Good chicken.  Steer clear of the sweet potato side dish and (what a waste of a) roasted artichoke.
Amazing food.  The beef ribs and southern fried chicken are so good.
Lots of hands on stuff to do and explore. My faves - the robots - they never miss shooting baskets and will kick your ass at air hockey. Fun and informative way to kill an afternoon.
This place is great. Local hang out and cold beer everytime. The tortilla soup is to die for, go endless. Always a good happy hour Monday thru Friday  and fun to watch nfl games.
Went for lunch to celebrate a grinding training finally ending. Burgers and drinks were good. I wish I had time to sit there and savor it. \n\nI will go again with kids which is the true test as we all know.
I like the beer. The food is OK the chicken sandwich was good. I think it is  a little pricey but a decent deal during happy hour. One of the better places in Chandler to have a beer for sure.
Beer wasn't great and the menu was pretty lame... I expected a much better menu. Very disapointing. Gordon beirsch looks like fine dinning in comparison... I won't be back.
Love this place! We drive 50 miles from Anthem just for the beer and food. Great selecton of craft beers and the nacaroni with brisket is to die for!
Stuffed bacon cheeseburger with pretzel bun was great!! The atmosphere was good but it was a little warmer than what I feel is comfortable. Service was average. Overall, a good experience, will likely go back at some point.
This is a great find, and a wonderful value.  I've been participating in this co-op for 3 months now and have never been disappointed.  My kids always have good snacks and I've found more reasons to cook fresh.
The only reason I came here was because the TI provided us with a 2 for 1 coupon. The food was over cooked and greasy, and some just tasted funny. The desserts were the only things that we ok, not horrible but not great either. Very disappointing!
Mastro's serves up the best steak in Scottsdale.  They also offer delicious seafood and excellent side dishes.  Prices are steep. After 10pm this place becomes a pick up joint for gold digging women seeking sugar daddy's.
Mastro's has a reputation for being the best in Phoenix and they did not disappoint. I had the salmon (not a big fan of Steak) and it was excellent as were the shoestring fries.
New ownership doesn't get it .
love the freshness of the ingredients - makes it a weekly trip for me!\nthe desserts are my favorite though - the burritos are overstuffed so I have never actually eaten a whole burritos yet!
People were telling us they were laughing so hard that they cried.  We didn't experience much laughter or tears.  Not sure if it was because we could not relate to it.  This show is for 45+.
What a disappointment.  Everything was overly salted including the miso soup.  And it certainly was not worth the $50 per plate.  We won't be back,
Seen this show more than a dozen times in the span on 3 years and its always fun :) naughty!!!
We loved! Dat Phan was hilarious
This was a great show Wally the MC was the highlight. Worth the price I loved every minute
Reminded me of the days of THE ED SULLIVaN SHOW. a series of acts assembled to create a full show.  all were enjoyable.
Fish was decent a little warm for my taste. Service is good. I feel with the business they do that they can upgrade some of their products such as buying better soy sauce then higher quality of fish.
Honestly, it's a really nice place with nice decor.  I guess that's why people think that the food is good.  Actually, the food I was not impressed at all.  The rolls, the appetizers.  But hey, again, nice restaurant.
Great as usual, can never get enough of this place!! Love the all you can eat sushi and appetizers.
This is the 2nd time we've come early enough but the hostess didn't want to seat us so we are going elsewhere ... $300 tab .... Your loads mutha fuckas !!!!
Great food and a comfortable bar area, even with kids.
Yummy food! Good price.
Best Gyro I've had in AZ
Good for a quick lunch, big variety. Vitamin selection is OK, seems overpriced.
I expected more \"wolf howling at the moon\" shirts. Sorely disappointed
The ambiance was nice. But the bartenders were rude. We were handed our drinks and never heard from our bartender, Herbie, again. What's the point of looking at something nice if the service is poor. Pretty on the outside, ugly on the inside.
Overpriced. Only went because we had a coupon.  Service was OK but not overly friendly either.  Definitely don't need to go back...
Is it a steakhouse or a singles bar?  With the music blasting out of the bar area, it is difficult to tell.  There are steak options every few blocks here in the Valley of the Sun, so skip this one and go to any of the other fine options.
Absolutely wonderful!  The food is amazing, the service was impeccable and the atmosphere is trendy and inviting. Would definitely recommend!
Thank you for saving our Christmas meal ingredient scavenger hunt!! Stay open on Christmas and save more dinners!
This is the best Target in Vegas. I've been to 6 and this store is great. Staff are friendly. Returns are easy. Clearance is regularly cheaper than other area Targets. The only thing missing is a Starbucks. Please please put one in!!!
The cashier here is very mean especially a lady named Letticia!
The pickle that comes with food here is about the only thing worth writing about. Otherwise, everything is just kind of boring and not worth the trip. There are so many other good places to get a sandwich or salad that are far superior. Skip this place and try somewhere else.
This place is very loud and the staff are not friendly.  The food is ok and the drinks are pretty plain.
Chef salad was delicious and quickly prepared. Great attitude from employees Order was perfect. Open till 10pm for late time dinner.
I wish I could give 0 stars. \n\nI went back today to give them another try. The service was so disgusting I walked out. (Before getting my food). \n\nSo disgusted by them. BEWARE. You will get treated like absolute shit.
My mother and I ate here last Sunday afternoon...Excellent panang curry & pad thai! It was not greasy at all, had an excellent flavor! I ordered spice level 7 and loved it! I like it spicy!  The atmosphere was also very nice!
Large portions, great quality, lots of options, Henderson location is awesome, the fact that they have multiple locations is even more awesome! \nI would say that Pinkaow's traditional thai dishes are comparable to Lotus of Siam's and that they are simply just less busy.
$10 for a 4:20pm show. The absolute WORST movie theater popcorn I have ever eaten. I wish I'd have gone a few miles out of the way to AMC for $5 tickets and good popcorn. Very, very disappointing visit!
Great popcorn and an extremely friendly staff.  Seats are comfortable and the theatre is clean!
Nothing exceptional, yet no terrible disappointments. An Abuelos clone for sure. Don't go outta your way.
When this first opened the food was good. Now it tastes like everything came from the freezer. The food is just okay now but not for the price.
Have to bring this down.  Place was cool, but the staff became really sh*tty.  I so like the food, but geez, it's smile or something.
They always put a lot of effort into this exhibit, and considering it's a free attraction that says a lot about Bellagio! On the weekend it can get quite crowded - it's a small area - but definitely worth seeing if you are in the area!
This used to be the original location of NYPD Pizza, but the owners sold it to Pauly and the food has gone downhill since.\nI'll stick with NYPD Pizza, thank you very much.
i was only outside but the outside was beautiful. a little confusing to drive around, but a ton of little restaurants and shops. super cute.
I stopped 2 bjs to fill app for bartender ,I talked to a manager with in 10 mins That was the best interview i have had I have been a casino for 25 + yrs It was a very well conducted I am very impressed \n       bob nichols
Outfit to rock on the strip. This H&M was pretty much one of my favorite stores. Layout was great and their selection was very trendy.
This food was pretty terrible and overpriced.  I would not go back.
Worse buffet experience in Vegas.. Usually you can never go wrong with buffets in Vegas.. this was a bad choice. \n\nFood section.. quality was bad.. overpriced.. \n\nNever come here again.
Short review: Dorm Food.
Wish this site had a minus star.  This buffet was terrible.  The food was mediocre, food stations were dirty and not well stocked. The salad bar was the biggest disappointment.   Certainly NOT worth the $20 dinner price.  I would not recommed this to anyone.
I had fun here while I was in search of an inexpensive brunch before the long drive home. Great variety of dishes. One step up from the hometown buffet/golden corral type buffets.
HORRIBLE!! The chicken tastes like its from a banquet TV dinner!! Do not waste your money like we wasted ours!
This is absolutely abysmal. I'm sitting at the table trying to figure out how to get my money back...
Formerly Pharoah's Pheast.  Definately spacious dining area.  But the food was just OK.
Chad at the bar hates his job. He made that obvious through his poor service and bad attitude. Our crime? Eating dinner and buying drinks.
Service at the Las Vegas blvd location is always horrible except for the bar area. For some apparent reason I continue coming. Great bar food! Awesome beer!
Worst customer service ever!!! The hostess was more then rude & spoke to us like we were stupid & the manager was clueless
This is a outdoor shopping area.  Great shops.  Beautiful spot to stop for brunch and then go shopping!!!  Great addition to Vegas to get away from the Strip!
A few excellent shops and some good food, movie theatre... It's a suburban commercial center!!! You should know these places as they are everywhere carbon copied in any city.... But this is a really nice one
lots of shops but some are too expensive for me! great place to walk around. they do have a kids playground which is nice. fry's is next close by, there is a movie theater which is way to pricey !!!
Perfect for date night! Town Square is easy to get to, lots of parking spaces, great shopping, great bars, restaurants and a theater!\n\nKinda has a Cali feel to it, outdoor mall with palm trees everywhere, only thing missing is the weather!
Wow. Horrible counter staff. Rude, unhelpful, just awful. Why can't Rick Bayless have more outlets. This is bad.
Great spot; food ok; staff does try but not the best...love the views and the room.....
closed for ever
This place is great for large groups & their happy hour! The separate room for teppanyaki is nice & the food tastes great. It's a bit pricey but definitely worth it!
the owner likes butcher your haircut and color, then likes to argue with you on whether or not you lied to her about how you wanted your hair. Not worth the price or the time.  BEWARE!!
Disappointing. Color was not done well. Thus expensive for the results.   \nGray was not covered. Friendly. Clean
Came in at 700 pm Saturday night  place is clean  .  Waitresses were slow. Handling to many tables each\n30 minute ticket times   food was average    I'll skip next time ......
I miss this restaurant so much. Their tortilla soup and jerk chicken salad speaks to my soul. I recommend trying these two items because they are delicious. While I enjoy the Scottsdale location, the Tempe one is nice too.
Solid.\nI'm not in love with the food, but it serves a purpose.  My hubby loves the cornbread, so we usually end up here versus Kona based on the bread alone!
Came here today. Got seated by the host and never got service! After about 20 mins of servers walking by and others being served that came in after we did we decided to leave.. Maybe we smelled bad???  but still gonna give it 1 star for being seated
Island sushi  is the best , great customer service , best place for eat all you can sushi
Fish not fresh. Tuna frozen!  Ebi from same frozen shrimp I buy from 99 ranch market!  Sushi is bad. Service was really bad. Never going back!
Quite disappointed, my green beans had worms in them. Customer service was bad, still charge me full price for everything. Nobody even apologized. It was just a plain horrible experience.
Absolutely terrible food. Paying a dinner price for lunch leftovers is anathema to my wife and me. The wait staff are superb, and very nice. The Orleans has other places to eat on site, so avoid this one at all cost.
Pretty awful. Bad service.  Dirty. Crowded. Hot. And the food is junk.  I should have gone to another terminal.
Beer was not very cold.  They don't have the beer price on the menu - it is more than you'd (or I'd) expect.\n\nI went there expecting some custom beer - not here!  Standard beers on tap.
Apathetic service, not a brewing company, just a bar.  Pass this one by.
This place is a wonderfull place to go to... inexpensive and very friendly bartenders and some sexy ones at that... woo hoo!!! Love the screens in there and the food is excellent!!!
I wish I could give this place more stars but- like everyone says its over price, slow service and the food is only ok. You are better off going to the Starbucks in the hotel and getting a muffin.
This place sucks. Was told to avoid hour and a half wait to go in the lounge. Sat at a dirty table (only one available) and was totally ignored for 15 minutes so we left. Never again.
I have family out in Vegas..And its a MUST to stop by when we come into, In the middle of our stay, and right before we leave. Carne asada fries are the shit! The shrimp Burrito is pretty gnarly too..
The ambiance makes it seem like a fancy restaurant but sadly it is not. The food reminds me of Mexican fast food joints like Chilis or Chevy's. Same kind of appetizers and everything. The service is good though.
I will never eat or drink at this location. The waitress took 30 minutes to take my order and the cook handled all kinds of raw food without ever changing his gloves.
I enjoyed the novelty of getting my mercury on for $3 in a big cup. The shrimp were of poor quality - of that I am sure - but love the concept and they tasted decent.
This place is wonderful!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Fat free - new, clean place, plenty of parking - nice staff - and did I say fat free?  Great spot!
Free entrance,  free champagne all night for ladies,huka section, dance section, and 2 bars. The rooms are dark and sexy. What more could you ask for?  Enough said.\n\nHOWEVER, 2 well drinks=$26 bucks. ouch!
Whenever you're in Vegas.. Make sure to hit up this place..  I strongly suggest getting the bottle service... And if you do... Holla at my friend Shannon Belshoy (bottle agent) She is very courteous and professional.. Good Times
Is this in California too? If not, it should be. It was amazing and delicious.
Creative food, poor service. \nSpent close to an hour between appetizers and the main entries.
This place was good for the view , the drinks , the light show  and boo calling . Heck ya I got hammered and liked it .
Cheap beer and interesting crowd that go there. It's in Freemont - Downtown.
I went in today to purchase a desk, and the staff here was really helpful. The only problem I had was trying to track someone down to help me. They even put the package in my car for me. Service was excellent, but I felt they could have more staff on the floors.
Stop here almost every time we are in Vegas. Jell-o shots and redbull vodkas! We usually see the same bartenders too which is nice. Good service!
Very clean. Fair price for the quality food and ingredients. Simple menu. Good cheesesteaks and fries. Be aware of the cheese fries as they use real thick cheese :). It may be a little overwhelming. Overall, very good restaurant. We will return.
First time ever eating here, got a Gyro Salad for lunch. It's huge, only 6.95 and a great fast meal. \n\nOther stuff looks iffy, so eat at your own risk!
Did not honor website prices, overcharged on a la carte lunch specials, and charged extras without warnings. And every table was available at noon. Coincidence? I think NOT!!  What happened to the restaurant that was here under the same name a year ago!?!
Went once. Las Fuentas is sooooo much better! No need to go back here
my girlfriend and i have been there twice, and twice we have gotten upset stomachs, there were green bugs in the menus, friendly people, but get passed off to a different person both times, stay away from this place
The crowd was all old creepy drunk men , one was drooling and bragging about how much money he had, and then got kicked out bc he stole my friends iPhone!!!! music was so loud I couldn't think.. bartender was awesome though.
Just great to have a nice moment.\n\nBroad selection of wine. Ask for Alex's advice, he is surely one of the best sommelier you will ever meet.\n\nWe will go back, no doubt about it.
The bread is not warm. The half oyster plate had one empty shell so we got 5 oysters total. We ordered the bone in New York steak. I've definitely had better at lesser restaurants. The service is excellent but the food did not hit the spot.
This is definitely one of my favorite places in Vegas. It's a steakhouse, however we never tried the steak there. We always go with the seafood and French onion soup.
i had a chocolate cupcake from this today and currently am suffering from food poisoning. i suspect that it's salmonela.  i threw up everything that was inside me and still can't move, and have a crazy headache.  watch out when eating their cupcakes.
Great price for the breakfast deal $4.99 chicken steak & eggs, friendly staff good food and price. Music is little loud. But it is a bar, what can you say right ??
Love this store, whether to purchase stuff or just get some good ideas on how to decorate.  the staff is always super nice and helpful and always have lots of great stuff in stock.
Mediocre food... salsa tasted too \"tomato-y\", guacamole was very bland, taquitos were just \"ok\". Much better food from the small hole-in-the-wall Mexican joints.
Yaaawwwwwnnn!!!!! Next!\nThere are better pizza joints in town!
One of the better pizzas I've had in Phx. Sry Domino's!
Great salad, fast service and respectable pizza.  The bar setting makes this a welcoming hangout.
The only good thing about this place is getting to ride the mechanical bull.  It was empty both nights we stopped by.  At least I get to mark something off my bucket list!
I like this place.  It is in the top 5 places to get a great burger in Charlotte.  They have lots of cool signature choices, and of course you can create one any way you like.  They have great fries, both reguar potato and sweet potato.
Excellent burger!! Sweet potatoes were also awesome!  Price was a little bit high, but the food was excellent!
Had our credit card swiped twice for one bill on one visit and then it happened again a few months later...definitely not going back here.
Went here early ***Sunday** the food was great/Drinks! The hostess and servers where perfect young and energetic . Sat at the large patio great weather!
This place was horrible. Do not go here.
Love the ice cream and the mix-ins are fantastic but hate the hours of operation.
Tots tots tots what else can you ask for??? Oh yeah best beer selection at this local spot the staff is friendly and the food is delish overall a very satisfied customer!  Somebody beer me!
Golden Corral has better Quality food.
Waited here twenty minutes for service! Waiter came and got our drink order and they were never brought to us. My boyfriend and I just ended up leaving. Terrible service
The service is fine, better to go in during happy hour.... N don't miss their seafood undo pasta, yum
Found a bug in my salad. See picture.
Excellent service, good ambiance. The sushi here was above average with decent size rolls and nigiri. I gave 4 stars because the price was very reasonable
Very good food. Great flavors and amazing bread. Very friendly staff too
Good food, Good Portions, Good price
The food is decent but it gets spendy quickly!  Their OJ is the best...fresh squeezed, most breakfast items are very good, service is good.  The Tri Tip Dip is a must try!
Love our family YMCA, the new teen center is also very cool since they have Pac Man, the original. Yes, I move kids out of the way to play LOL
The salad was average but the salmon was awful! It was over priced for what you get and how you get it (cafeteria style)
Like the convenience and prices on some items. Disappointing that they don't take manufacturer coupons.  Some items are missing (low cal, low carb, etc)
Frankly, it was delicious. A carnivore's dream.
We've been here several times now, and have not been disappointed yet!  It's always fun, and the food is always good!
Not much meat selection,  really slow,  even though,I wasn't crowded.  The meat was really some poor cuts. Ie sirloin.   The salad bar was boring. I have to say I came Here about a year ago and was really impressed.
Enjoyed the coffee did not care for atmosphere.
They feature a different black coffee each day - super unique and they tell you not just the country but more specifically where it's from. Great vibe for business or catching up with friends.
The coffee is fine.  I am very thrown by the fact the don't have any center or sugar for taking.   Their poor costumer service skills is the single reason I do nor plan on caffinate here again.  They yell at their customers which is just poor business altogether.
Cute, modern, coffee warehouse type cafe building. Good baristas and coffee. A great place to chill and enjoy a espresso with friends.
I LOVE the food here, you can make your own stuff, combination, veggies and stuff.  delicious! the FOOD is great,\n\nThe service however, could be better, faster and more attentive.\n\nRonney
Every time I visit Pittsburgh I have to stop here. I've ordered a few sandwiches but just like everyone says... Everything is good! Only down side is that service is a little slow.
Besides having a Starbucks in here this is one of the best places to stop and get a peace of mind away from the hustle and bustle
its was ok. not really worth all the hype\n\nPrice: a lot\nPresentation: good\nTaste: okay\nservice: okay
The beet ravioli was gross, my hubby's steak needed salt, and service was slow. At least the waiter comped the ravioli since he was the one who suggested it. Won't be back.
You didn't offer a Zero. This place has good food but is overpriced and the music they pipe in that prohibits conversation should get someone an opportunity in another industry.
Food,staff & service all very very poor.interiors very depressing.u are better of cooking Indian food at home it will turn out better than anything served at this place
I have visited Indian Paradise on several more occasions since my first visit. The food remains very good as well as the service. Prices have gone up a bit but is still good value for the money. Try the lunch time buffet - great variety and the food is fresh and well priced.
Tandoori chicken and chicken madras is really good!
Superb place and superb food
Went for my first time to the lunch buffer.  It was fabulous.  Great food. Worth the $11.
Very good meal -- a la carte dinner. And service above and beyond. Must go back for the buffet.
I was taken here by my family for my birthday and was treated like royalty by the staff. Great selection, great food. Wr had a very enjoyable evening.
Amazing dinner experience! We had dinner on Christmas night. Set menu that evening with choice of wine pairing. The meal was glorious... Especially the chestnut soup with scallops. Service was spot-on! We had a wonderful evening and can't wait to return!
The food is good but if your eating in the bar bring a fan - it is way to hot - there is no AC - pathetic
The burger was good, the fries were ok, but once you mentally process that they were deep fried in lard, then what was tasting really good turned into a really guilt-loaded dinner. But it is what it says it is. A truly American restaurant, proud of its decadence.
So fattening. SO unhealthy. SO DELICIOUS! It was worth the drive from LA to AZ.
Really good food! I am surprised to hear about poor service as our server was friendly and our food came out SUPER fast!!!! We will definitely be back!!
I'm here almost every Saturday and I always bring friends. The barista are great, the regulars are relaxed, the drinks are carefully made (and delicious) and the atmosphere is *perfect.*
was a regular for a while. Over time found the friendliness from the staff to be a bit of an act. Zombie hipsters. Long wait.
There isn't a coffee shop at the address given in yelp. I called the number but couldn't reach them.
Stopped in with a friend of mine on a busy night. Even though busy, we were greeted and helped by a very friendly sales associate. The store was kept neat and tidy, especially considering it's the holiday shopping season. I would definitely visit this location again.
I walked out (12-30-14, 2:30 PM) in disgust after female server tried to seat me in a tiny booth even though there were many bigger booths and tables available. Asked to talk to manager but told he wasn't available.
Best sandwiches anywhere! Everything is made fresh and is outstanding. My favorite is the Turkey, Bacon, Avocado ....amazing! Even the sides are made fresh daily. The potatoes salad is out of this world good!\nYou got to try this place!
This is one of the most conveniently located costco's in the valley.\n\nyou are walking distance from a super walmart and a super target and even a movie theater.\n\nthis costco is always crowded not just on the weekends!
Rude service.  Very unpleasant order takers.  Plus bagels are Just as bad as eating doughnuts.
This place is pretty good, not the best, but it's still satisfying.
After posting this, I went in and asked for a cash refund, as I was not interested in returning and would not use a credit.  As mentioned by the owner, I was given the cash refund I requested.  I stand by all my other statements.
When the owner comes by to apologize, I'ts not a good night. Service is slow, pizza is nothing special in a town with some good pie. It's also weirdly loud in there.
Slow service, very small pour for overpriced wine.love the rustica pizza. i like to carry out garlic knots and a rustica from their tatum location. for some reason no garlic knots at the location on indian bend.
I'm a little bit disappointed.  I tried to order a smaller custom cake for a very special occasion.  Even though I inquired over 3 weeks in advance, they declined because they're too busy.
I like their food but there are some annoying flies bothering us.
Only korean place we'll go in town! Our favs include seafood pancake, bugolgi, seafood tofu soup.
Good local spot tucked away beyond the strip. Small dance floor, hookah's, Live bands are just a few things that they have to offer.
Tried various locations of Lindo around town, just not impressed. Just standard fare, with inflated prices.
Decent C+
Great service and food!\n\nLove the staff and the place.
Pretty place, but snotty management and the cocktails are not very good. After being told that a booth was reserved we were invited to sit with a large corporate group which was so kind of them. That \"reserved\" table never became filled
I don't really care what the overall stars rating is, this place is great!\nThe Shepard's pie is one of the best in the valley and the staff is always ready with a fresh pint.\nThe Sunday jam sessions for traditional music is great.
Great food...fresh beer and great service on a busy Saturday night!  The band was real good too!
Pure charm in every way, and a perfect kitchen.  Fantastic bartender.  It's one of the Valley's best!
Amazing food and cocktails. The music is to die for, if you are a reggae fan like me.\nA perfect meal!
Happy hour for drinks. Nice ambience and super customer service and Salt fish fritter! I didn't give 5 star due to not trying actual food. But great overall
An interesting concept.  All items nicely packaged.  Self checkout that works well.  Would return.
Good beer, good food, good music, good people.
If I could eat the pepper jack mac and cheese all day long, I would. I get it every time I go. The sandwiches are pretty good too. It's got a great, laid back atmosphere where you can get pretty decent bar food and a have a beer or two.
This place is a dive but is strangely appealing.  The food was good and reasonably priced.  Service was friendly and fast.  The outdoor patio is amazing with ping pong and corn hole.  They even had a band outside on a Wednesday night.  Great hang out joint.  Wii definitely be back.
Very unique and authentic breakfast. This is not a \"IHOP\" type. Everything is made and presented delicately. Will definitely go back to check out the salads.
another hidden gem - def need to get ANYTHING with sweet potatoes in it
Cool place, Great healthy food, spotty service
Consistent, eclectic fare at reasonable prices.   Large portions.   I eat mostly breakfast at ZJ's, have tried most of the menu over the years, and keep going back.   I've even figured out when to arrive so I can park!
Great food, great atmosphere, but POOR customer service.  No smiles on the cashiers at all.  They just never seem happy to be there.
Pulled pork was tough, dry, and vinegary.  Fries were old and soggy.
Used to be a lot of fun, but prices went up and service went down.\nFinding new place to hang out with friends!
We went to Pole Position as part of a team building event with work.  It was pretty fun! Definitely a great place to bring out the competitive attitude in everyone!
Stopped by this place on vacation in Scottsdale last week.  We were just looking for something quick.  The pizza was good, nothing fantastic, but pretty good.  I had a slice of pepperoni and olive.  The ingredients were all fresh and I enjoyed it.  It was very expensive given the location.
Love this place! Great sushi and Korean. Although I mostly go for the sushi
The best Korean food in Vegas. Clean and great service .A place that I would go back to.
Their Iced Mocha is really good.  I'm not to big on the bagels. That's the only reason I took off a star, everything from service to drinks is awesome!!!
Excellent food and service.  They were not that busy when we were there so we had a lot of attention from the wait staff.\n\nLobster Mac and Cheese was a definite home run.
Service was incredible.  We were a group of seven and all were pleased with the food and service provided.  We would all definitely recommend and return.
Pretty good and cozy Place for casual dinning.... Steak and lobster bisque soup were really great!!!
we have been to multiple thai restaurants in the SE Valley and this restaurant was by far the worst thai food we have eaten around here!! Service was alright but food quality was sub par... not returning
Sunday happy hour is so cheap! If you come here, get the seared salmon roll! I don't even care for salmon, and its amazing!
If sushi is what you like, visit \"The Geish\" (What I like to call it). This is a great place to bring a date. The seared salmon special and Infused saki are my favorite. The vibe is very relaxed and intimate.
The sushi was so so, service was mediocre and the drink \"hello kitty martini\" is the furthest thing from a martini. Ultimately dissatisfied.
CLOSED!!!!\n\nIt is close to work, so I went back had a hot ham and cheese it was quite good and the service was much better.  Tried to go back again last week and it's closed.  No sign, emptied out.
Very good food.  They just moved locations across the street to the old seesaw location. Good food can't really choose a bad item however the atmosphere is very ho hum.
Loved it! Best French toast ever!
Lots of variety of things to get. I've only been there the one time, but the people I was there with frequent the place, and say it's hit or miss on service but the food is nearly always delicious.
Used to go there all the time and the last time I went the tech accidentally cut off a chunk of skin which was horribly painful and two days later I found out I had a massive staph infection
Happy hour 24-7... can't get better than that and they have a better sushi selection than RA sushi. I wish the place was bigger. They finally have gift cards and a Pearl Reviews point card  SCORE!
It's a HUGE slice and a fair price but, other than that, I don't share the enthusiasm for Mamma Mia's. It's just \"OK.\"
I'm tough on pizza places. This place is good. I truly enjoy the ingredients, and preparation. Atmosphere and service are lacking.
I love Mamma Mia's and eat there often. The pizza is my favorite in town, the Caesar salad is always fresh, and the meatballs rock!! I've never had any thing there that I didn't enjoy. Don't miss out!!
I love this movie. Clean. Friendly. Management is always on their employees about customer service. They are a bit pricey but worth it. I always go an hour early because the theatre gets busy quick. Love the shopping and food around it. Always clean and on time. Awesome experience
I come here a lot. Like that they have cheap matinees and offer a variety at snack bar. Like that they have the automated ticket machines.
Location Location Location! Charlotte's great place to have a glass of wine and people watch. Dolce Vita is located in the Queen city best location in town, NODA. Great outdoor seating and good wine selection. Absolutely one of our favorites. 4 thumbs up!
I love this place in and out in no time. The food is very fresh made to order, and you can call in your order and come and pick it up I've  tried many rolls all very good.
I refer to this Fry's as \"the nice Fry's\" that is a little out of the way but we sometimes go to because it's nice.
This place had terrible service and piss poor food to boot. It was a combination of our waitress being new and not interacting well with the chief that cause the bad experience. However, there are plenty of better Italian resturants in Vegas than this.
I love shopping at this store. The meat selection is absolutely amazing. The customer service is out of this world. You have to check it out for yourselves!
We are very pleased with our new patio security door. We now only wish we had done it sooner. The entire process was professional, including the installation.
SERVICE SUCKS!! Got our drinks after we got our food. The restaurant was not even busy. After we got our separate bills, our waiter alberto had messed up our orders and proceeded to tell us they did not split checks. failed to mention that before end ordered.
Undercooked egg, overall very poor
glad I only had coffee.  meh..
I took 2 computers within 2 days and both issues were resolved.  Very nice and explains what the problems were. Very affordable.
Wasn't impressed at all.
Cafe Rio has THE BEST food, but this location has not gotten an order correct once. When ordering online, don't expect your food to be made until you get there. Make sure to check it or you will get home and find out your order is wrong!
Good Persian food with a courteous staff. Nice to have in the neighborhood.
very nice a little dated but all in all very nice. if only it was closer to my house.
the service was lousy. i have had better service before at the one at arrowhead mall. my daughter spilled her drink and they gave her an apron to clean herself? they left the soda on the floor so we had to step on it the whole time. what?
Wow, Very good, well priced.  You can't go wrong, there's delicious middle eastern food and desert.  I love the pastries.  Try a Turkish coffee.
food was fresh and authentic but way overpriced. owner was nice and so was girl behind counter will I be back maybe but only ordering food once you add in $2 drinks and $3 desserts the bill begins to rack up
Amena had really good service and have really good plates.They have great prices I recommend it.
The sushi here is good. Go during happy hour, because the prices are great! The service was really fantastic. The staff were friendly, helpful, and polite. My first experience here was a really good one. I'll be back whenever I'm back in town.
It is the place I go for burgers.  Fatburgers.  The shakes and fries simply tidy the meal up in my opinion.  :)
Love their chicken pot pie soup.  I had to get a BOWL of it.  And then a po-boy pastrami melt.  YUM!
Love this place! Employees are so friendly! Place is clean food is good. Love the pasta salad!
Anything free is alright with me, especially in Vegas! This show is alright, although the volcano flames get so hot you can feel it.
It was an ok show. Don't be too dissapointed if you miss it.
For airport Mexican food I will give it a little credit.  My suggestion is keep it simple, order something like a quesadilla where odds of failure are really low and you'll probably come out alright.
great service, amazing staff, they know their stuff.....whatever it is they have everything i need and even stuff i didn't know i needed
The bacon and eggs were great and the coffee was also.. The sandwiches not my favorite. But breakfast is a YES
RE was delicious Tapas, sadly they are now closed :(
Their emu oil is great.  I use it for inflammation of my jaw and shoulders, it's wonderful.  I highly recommend it.  We buy it at Fresh Vitamins in Mesa.  No dyes, fully refined, I love it.
Awesome!  Pizza rocks!  Pasta is great homemade stuff.  Really different than pretty much Italian type restaurants.
Driver's are crooks! They write in their own tips! Managers aren't very helpful either! All crooks! order somewhere else, not here!
For a good quick lunch, you can taste excellent burgers and meat also done in different ways. I want to emphasize the excellent quality of the meat. Priced accordingly about 10 \u20ac to persona.Enrico
To this day I will never understand the hype. It's fast food junk.
Steaks were extremely expensive and did not taste much better then what I had at an all you can eat Buffett the night before!
Amazing! Seriously amazing! From the amuse to the banana cream pie, everything was utterly delicious. We started with the  steak tartare and the crab and shrimp Louis. We then split the American Waygu ribeye and the lobster. Hands down the best meal ever!
Horrible; don't waist your money. I left before they could even finish my order. Go to a different Chipotle.
Fatty steak in the steak tacos. Toppings tossed on sloppily to bury the shells under a mound. $12 bucks for some mediocre lunch tacos... Me thinks not.
Slow service and small portions.  Food is good but not worth the wait.
It's in-n-out burger. You can't go wrong!
Really people it's in n out burger do I really have to say anymore except. Fresh and yummy.
Most locations are usually the same but this branch's lettuce tends to always be soggy and the bread either over cooked or old.
Just came in for a smog check. It's $19.95 regular price but with the coupon mailer it's $14.95. Can't really complain much about it. Simple service in and out and cheaper than jiffy smog definitely.
An AZ original 2Hippies! The best people, the best price, the best Burgers!
Got the portabello burger with a side salad and it was so so good. Everything on the menu sounds great. The employees were super nice. Can't wait to come back!
The service was outstanding.  The waiter and general manager nailed the whole experience.  The food was good, but I have had equally as good cuts of steak elsewhere for 1/2 the price.
Overpriced, food wasn't very good, the service was only decent. If you go to Cadillac Ranch go for the eye candy and the bar on a Friday or Saturday night otherwise you will walk out feeling like you just kissed your sister... yeah I said it!
Not a fan. I visited here 4 times over a year ago. Thought the food was mediocre at best. The atmosphere was cool and the service OK. Not interested in returning. Have lots of other options. The atmosphere is unique and cool, but not enough to return.
Food took forever to cone out and was cold when it did. Nobody ever checked on us and we saw our waitress a whole three times between our food arriving and paying our bill.  Despite the restaurant being empty, the manager never checked on us.  This place obviously is not in business because of the service.
I come here often for lunch and dinner, and love all the vegan options. The Crazy Pita salad and Mediterranean Salad are both great, and their hummus with whole wheat pita is delish. Crazy Pita is great!
Good food!!!
This place is heavenly!!! I have dreams about it on a regular basis. The cookies are so fresh and you can choose two different kinds and two different ice cream flavors. TASTY!
Very good sushi, prices are a bit high but I'm not complaining.  I'll be back :)
Great service every time. Food is excellent. Levi is the best server.Great place for a few glasses of wine, fun atmosphere & delicious food. The ice cream is amazing!
Best place to eat on mill if you're looking for Italian and something casual. The pizza and bruschetta is what they are known for.
Great food, but awful service.
Really great panang! This is one of the best place to eat lunch in the area.
Good place to go and eat gyros if your up in North Scottsdale. The staff is friendly and the food gets to you real fast. The price is somewhere between 7-10 per meal but that's usual for N. Scottsdale.
Just tried this place for the first time the Gyro was the best ive had. I never thought anyone could beat my greek gyro place in Scottsdale but these guys have done just that. Definitely recommend eating here.
The pizza is pretty good, and the prices are decent. I've ordered from them several times. However, the pizza never seems to be cooked fully through, it's always thin and doughy in the middle.
I've ordered their pizza based on yelpers' review... Meh... I didn't want it after a bite.
Good wings even better screwdriver plenty of TVS NICE  location kinda of on the expensive side. It's a  cardinals bar  but they show every  game that's on during Sunday
This location is awful. They changed names and nothing actually changed besides that. Food isn't very good. Dinners come with nothing but mounds of onions. So many better places to choose from. Won't be going back.
The Pho was delicious, the place was cute, and the prices were decent. Also, the service was amazing! The waiter offered to warm up my son's bottle. Good service goes a long way, so we will definitely be back!
This place is crazy dirty.  The ribs are tough, the pulled pork okay.  Ate here because we had a social media coupon.  Will not go back. I wrote another review of this place at one star but it has gone missing?
This is something I will definitely pass on next time around.  I do not know whether it was the 109 degree temperature or the throngs of people but it made it is something that not worth wasting your time on.
Doing the double-double animal style.  Though I still have love for fries well done, I made the switch back to good old regular.
Wow!  Great tasting every time!  Love everything I have ever tried!  Highly recommend!
Best tacos I have had in Vegas! The number 8, 10 and 11 all yummy!  Mind you, not traditional necessarily, more fusion in nature. So good. And cheap!
The staff is always nice and cheerful, although they can be a bit ignorant. I've received beer poured into the wrong kind of glass and they nearly always mispronounce quinoa. But the vegan tacos are yummy and the laid back atmosphere is relaxing and fun.
Great for a lunch salad with girlfriends...  if you're not into rabbit food, the pasta lunch specials are tasty too, but be prepared to nap the rest of your workday... :)
I had my daughters baby shower here. Let me tell you I was a pain with all my changes. The banquet manager, Nova was very helpful and patient. At the event the room was beautiful, service great and the food was really good. I did not have one complaint!
Solid food. Neither spectacular nor bad. Good service. Sit outside.
Loved this place. It was my first time going with some friends. Great beers on tap and you can try a new one every time you go. Go after work with some friends and enjoy HAPPY HOUR!!!
Really good food and one of if not the best selection of beer between here and the next closest Yard House.  The Happy Hour prices are even better.
Food was ok, Great place for hang  out or for watching sports great selection beers
The music is a little too loud, but their food is so good. Their burger with the lobster and asparagus is my favorite meal on the menu. Love it!
Great place! I love their veggie burger!
Over rated. Better food else where. Waitress did not bother to refill my iced tea when she brought over refills for my husband and son. My turkey club sandwich - dry. Although I did enjoy the small side of Cesar salad, hence the 2 stars.
The draft beer selection makes this place far above what the food does. The food is good, but normal. Nothing bad, but nothing amazing, besides the beer. Loved it, and I'm not even a beer fanatic!\nDave
I used to like Sundance when it just opened, but it has really gone downhill. \n\nThe service is awful and the food is just as bad..
Horrible Service. Extremely slow to seat us... and feed us... and water us... and bill us... slooooow.\nWe won't be going back.
Having the Chicken Parmesan tonight. Very good as far as coffee shops go. Service was pretty good. Very busy tonight.
Closed. Out of business, at least when trying to check the place out on July 14, 2010.
Busy airport eatery.  Nuff said.
Best sushi in AZ! Great for a group of friends. $20 all you can eat
So I usually have a good experience here. The chefs are very nice as they were today, but if you're not at the sushi bar the service is much slower when it comes to the sushi. Overall not bad, but could have been much better service.
We went for the unlimited sushi but ended up waiting around for way too long for our food. Just a truly ridiculous amount of time. I felt like the sushi was below average as well. Wouldn't come back.
The theatres are too small, they overcharge on refreshments/snacks. customer service really isnt all that great...
Was good, had more than one pool. Only downfall is that all of them only went up to 3 1/2 feet :/
Average food at best. Wings undercooked and greasy. Onion rings underwhelming. Service poor. Waited 30 minutes when place wasn't busy...  Won't be back...
Not impressed. The staff was standing around, the pizza by the slice was limited to two choices that looks to have been sitting for a while and wasn't very good.  And no one seemed to really care.
Shortline for a quick bite, nothing special!
Food was standard Chinese fare. The wonton soup is very good and worth the upgrade.\n\nWhen I went, they seemed short staffed and overwhelmed. Had a long wait between wait staff visits. Place needed cleaning from an apparent lunch rush.
It's fast, it's friendly and about as inexpensive as you can get in Desert Ridge.  Wasn't blown away by thier food, but I would go back.
Happy Halloween Costco members.  Come see us soon, the fuel price this week is $2.759.
Don't waste stomach space on Maria2 in an area this full of tasty restaurants... sugary margaritas, sloppily presented meals, stale chips...\n\nYou can do better...
I wasn't expecting authentic Mexican food but I was expecting good quality food for the price. The flavors where decent bit the meat was fatty and not cooked properly and expensive.
'We went here on a Monday night for drinks.  The drinks on the menu were creative.  I'll try the sushi next time.
There are so many reviews for this place- I'll keep it short:\n\n\nYamato roll, let's be together forever.
thought all the nicer vegas strip restaurants should have more quality....\nguess i will stick to having sashimi / sushi in LA!!!
Great service and environment. Brazilian & sushi can't go wrong. Order 3-4 items and share
Food is great.  High end sushi.  Josh the mgr hooked us up with a few apps on the house.  Bad part:  Our server was terrible. Christy or something like that.  She needs to go work at Denny's with an attitude like that.  Won't be going back.
The fixed price dinners are WELL worth the price.  The service here is just as great as the food.  I've had dinner here on two separate Vegas trips and will definitely be back.
Cost $500 every time came here to have yummy sashimi, but the last time really sucks! One oyster stink n wholly smell. Was of my favorite but won't go there again
Service A+.  Staff was very accommodating and great.  Food was overpriced and terrible. 1 star for great service but would have rather had crappy service and great food
We paid 13.99 per person and there was two aisles of the same exact food! Small amount of choices, not the best quality, not worth my money. Save your time and money, find another buffet but this one!
This is an average food spot with really good service. I'm not really big on all the wok stuff, so I had to find some alternatives...and, there really aren't many. We had a good time and our service was funny. I'd go back.
All the food was excellent, especially the sliders. Our waitress was excellent. We have been here many times and are never disappointed.
Calamari is very good. Did not like pot stickers at all and normally this is one of our favorite dishes. Chicken rice soup is absolutely delish!  Great Happy Hour menu too!
$60 for 4 rolls that we weren't that impressed with... I find that pricey.
It was okay. Overpriced for average quality food. Don't think I \nwould ever go again.\n\nThe wasabi was blue.
I purchased unlimited and I should've brought the one use pass the rides were ok. Great view however, the rides wasn't scary I'm and adrenaline junky and I love roller coasters but these rides didn't do it for me
This place runs out of certain donuts at a certain time. I was told it takes 3 hours to make chocolate munchkins.
The lady at the window was short & rude. 3/6 donuts were incorrect, she had already walked away & would not come back after handing me my 'latte' which was mostly foam. What a way to start your morning..
Horrible don't give a cr*p service. The worst I have experienced in any restaurant here in the valley! The manager Gary is an apathetic weasel with no customer service skills. Anyone want to buy a $25 gift card from this dump?
Overcrowded, overrated, overpriced tourist place in the Bellagio. Horrible, I mean HORRIBLE service.
We came here for m bachelorette party and all 15 of us girls thought it was the best restaurant and fish we had ever eaten! I highly recommend this place. Order the spicy tuna pizza! enjoy!
Forget Panda Express!\n\nBeef Roll\nPeanut Sesame Noodle\nFish & Tofu soup (MY FAVORITE) \nDuck - nice mild flavor\nKung Pao Chicken - standard but delicious
I feel like everytime I have come in service and quality have gone way down. Im going to Sauce from now on for sure.
Fried okra was fresh hot and delicious, pulled pork, beef, and chicken were all served cold, so was sauce & beans. won't return.
I asked for a grilled Tuna rare and it came to me well done along with soggy asparagus.  The rest of the table did not have any issues with their meals.
Ordered nachos...took about 20 mins for it to come out. Sour cream looked like cottage cheese and they use the shredded microwaveable cheese. \n\nThe beer is good, can't really go wrong with that!
Customer service is always and I mean always bad here and the food is just ehhh also but I continue to go here for a bowl of white rice which that they can screw up.
Dry n small tamales. I had high hopes because it seemed legit. Keep looking if you wsnt really good tamales.
Went for the \"garlic festival\".  Love this place but where was the garlic festival?  They were selling some garlic but that was it.  Very disappointing. I will continue to buy their oils and spreads but won't bother to attend anymore \"festivals\".
Not only is the food delicious, but the service was fantastic as well. The staff did everything to make sure me and my kids had a great experience. I'll be back again soon.
Worst Customer Service I have EVER recieved in my entire life. I know that sounds dramatic and harsh but it really was terrible. We got stuck in there over 3 hours. Our server was rude. Food was mediocre.
Favorite Park in the city! Beautiful spot! Fitness,Family or Fun!
Where is 2470 W Happy Valley Rd.  It's not near the large 2480 number on the building in the middle of the block on the north side of the street.
Intimate restaurant seats about 70. Neat but a bit over priced, steaks were not great, and $70/ person for 2 sodas 1 bottle of average wine with the meal and no desserts. We wouldn't go back.
Just an average bagel place.
Had a large Pho Tai with raw beef. Absolutely delicious best pho I've had in the PHX area
Very delicious and fresh food! I love the various menu items and what they have to offer. We came here for dinner with a friend from out of town, and everyone at our table was more than satisfied! I love how this place supports local produce and farms. Yum!
If you want a great, gourmet cupcake go to the Cake Artists Studio on Bloomington Road. They are cheaper and she's an accomplished pastry chef. The cupcakes at Cakes are overpriced and not special at all.
Way too yummy! Get the red velvet!
I hate to say this, but out of all of the cupcakeries I've tried, Cream & Flutter is my least favorite.  From frosting to cake...very disappointing.  Maybe I should go for a cookie next time?
Very slow service and they weren't very busy. Decent food. Very loud inside.  Nice patio when it isn't hot.
What a wonderful evening! The Ono was amazing, and our server recommended a wine that went perfectly with it. Service was great. we will be back.
We stopped here for a Friday night date night. It was our first visit and we'll definitely return! The food, the service, affordability and ambience are all excellent! On our \"keeper\" list for sure!
Beautiful lights for Christmas!  Great to come and see with or without kids.  Always try to do some of the local stuff when we go places, so while this was off the strip by a lot- it was worth the time.
I went once and wasn't impressed.  I tried it again and it didn't fare any better.
I went looking for frozen bags of edamame and sweet rice, coconut milk and ripe mango to make a sticky rice dessert. I found everything at Super L Ranch Market. I'll be back!
First time eating here last night. Started off with the hummus for an appetizer and got the gyro for my main meal. Everything was excellent..
Amazing food, friendly staff, affordable prices! You Must check it out!
Waited for an hour during lunch. They took my order, waited forever, and ended up having to leave without eating because I needed to get back to work.
Just about the only place left on Mill that you can go to dance. Good drinks, and actually pretty laid back for a club.
Friendly and courteous staff! The quality of the toppings are always properly maintained and fresh.
Ok more of a 3.5 star sushi joint. Nothing I had was mindblowing.
Not the best, not horrible. Waitress not being able to make a recommendation or knowing what anything is, pretty lame. This place is very overrated.
The boneless wings though tasty were all batter. I picked most of it off. The burger looks amazing and was huge. Could be a little more well lit during the day but the staff was wonderful and the food was pretty good.
Good food. Nice service, decent price for the strip. Way less busy than other nearby similar Mexican restaurants probably because it's indoors only but good break from the heat! Great 10$ lunch special (15 with a margarita)
Worst enchiladas EVER and decor from a 1980's attempt at a mexican restaurant.  Taco Bell is a step up!  But if you like soupy enchiladas drowning in cheez wiz this is the place for you.
Seated and forgotten on a Saturday night. Servers looking bored. How about, check you table? Jeez...
Sat for 15minutes no one came to serve us, they checked on the booth in front of us, but ignored us completely. Going to Cracker Barrel down the road.
My absolute favorite place to go in Pittsburgh. During the summer months, it gets pretty crowded but in the winter, just grab a hot chocolate then head up there at night, and it's beautiful. So peaceful.
this place used to be fun, now all you get us over priced drinks that are watered down and poor service. I definitely won't be back.
The food was not only beautifully presented but delicious. The sommelier was very approachable and helped us narrow our wine selection perfectly. A thoroughly enjoyable experience.
Best grilled chicken in Charlotte! Pio Pio!
They close at 10pm.   We got there at 9:15 and the host refuses to seat and serve us.  Will never go back there and give them anymore business.
This place blows.  Food had no taste and shake was below average for a higher than deserved price.  Johnny Rockets blows this place away and I even prefer a Denny's burger and shake for half the price
Love this place!  It is a blessing and very reasonably priced.
Corn bread--good.  Street tacos--very good.  The baked seafood enchilada--not so good (tasted very fishy).  Tortilla soup--not so good, but maybe be average for a tex-mex style.
Wow.....as bad as it gets.... And I've been traveling for 39 years. Terrible terrible terrible
Very good chinese food I had since I moved out here. I love their big portions and that they deliver all the time and on time! I love the shrimp with lobster sauce, shrimp walnut, and there egg soup! The family sets are good!
Tried it for the first time over the weekend. Ordered 2 lunch specials & the portions were awesome. The food tasted decent but I felt that the sauces were a little too sweet in flavor. I'll order different dishes next time.
Flavors and portions were spot on but customer service is lacking. While the service leaves much to be desired it wouldn't prevent me from frequenting the restaurant.
The tables are always filthy and sometimes the staff seem like they can't be bothered to deal with you, but the bagels are pretty tasty and they definitely soothe my bagel jones when I'm having cravings.
I enjoyed my experience very much.  If I lived closer I would be there often.  Great happy hour.  Should consider opening a seperate location in Summerlin that does tapas.  I would be there.
Horrible horrible horrible service. We sat for 10 minutes and were not greeted so we got up to leave and all they did was wave us goodbye
The food is decent, but with the handful of times I've been there...worst customer service, EVER.
Great food again an great service. Love the thai tea..has become a fav place..
I come here about once a year and then I remember why I don't come here more often. My car was next in line to get washed and 3 corp vans were moved in front of me. And now I wait. Will prob take 40 mins to get out of here .
My favorite boutique on Mill Ave.  The prices are very reasonable wtih a huge sale section.  I can always find something that I love and can't live without.  The store is clean and easy to navigate.  Very friendly and helpful staff as well!
Dinner was poor service, bad food and too expensive.  Good location for happy hour only.
the Front desk staff was very pleasant, Hotel is old, the kitchen appliances is very old, we booked four rooms four nights. each one w/ old appliances. Housekeeping didn't refurnish daily supply, wouldn't stay here ever again
Horrible service plus very expensive food. Restaurant was empty and it took a half an hour for a waiter to come and take our order for drinks. Would not recommend.
Loved it.  Perfect thin and charred crust and great toppings.  Very fast service for a busy place.  Better than the place at Hilldale.
Great atmosphere n great food. \nOn the pricey side.
Two words:  shitty service
Had my gf office party here. It was meh. Probably won't go here again but I can see the appeal to some folks
Friendly hostess who also brought our food. I think the food was okay for the price we paid but the coffee was excellent nice and strong unlike American coffee! Probably will give it another try soon.
Food is better than service......cashier acts as if she's doing me a favor,even though she was nicely rude....this is sad because Goodyear could use more GOOD mom & pop businesses.
Just watched the chef drop his tongs on the ground, pick them up and use them again. Refund? Yes please.  Not returning to this place. When I asked him about it he wouldn't respond to me.
The toasted panini that I had cold meat in the center. The music inside was obnoxiously loud. The only reason that I'm giving it more than one star is because the waiter was very nice. Everything else was less than savory
Good spot for brunch, but over priced
Surprised, but it actually was good ... yes, Pizza Hut and good. At least at 10:30AM, this is the place to be!
I love this location! It is extremely easy to get to and I often find myself here to check out their new styles. The prices are very reasonable and the staff is helpful.
Im not a real big shopper at DSW but I did find some super awesome boots I saw on pinterest for $100. They also give out military discounts. They have a great selection to choose from!
The food is nothing spectacular. The only reason to go is because kids eat free on tuesday.
Tylor and Glenn were the best! I was the one that got there one minute to closing and they stayed open for me! Awesome service!
Great staff but dry cigars wasted 20$ on two cigars that are as hard as a rock...very frustrating when you want to end the night with a good stogie
Nice shop with experienced barbers. One visit so far, but an excellent cut with an excellent taper in the back. \nStraight razor neck shave with cream and Oster massage at the end.\nHighly recommend Darwin the barber.
$45 before tip for a men's haircut Supercuts coulda done. I won't go back.
Scale of 1-10 (multiple visits):\n7 Food\n8 Service\n8 Atmosphere\n7 Value
Allot of good food. Cheesy garlic bread was bomb. Very addictive. Pretty busy night due to prom. Our waitress was very good. We have to make it back for the lasagne. Overall a good experience.
Huge store if you know forever 21and like try hair styles you'll love this store.though there's never anyone around when you can't reach something.
We had an amazing meal here...granted it was 3 years ago. Had a spicy shrimp dish and it was so delicious. Service was wonderful as was atmosphere. Both my husband and I still talk about the amazing Mexican meal we had here. Give it a try....
Mac&Cheese is off the chain.
Love the service and smiles everytime we visit this store!
Good food!!! But the service was slow...
I go to Starbucks all over and this one is super slow and super rude. This is def the worst starbucks in town!!! Avoid it like the plague!!!
Always a different experience I guess it just depends on whose working. Thank goodness for drive through Starbucks!
This is the only Starbucks in my neighborhood so I go here by default. Friendly enough staff but they are consistently sooooo slow :(
Service, timing and most importantly the food was great.  I ordered the filet and it was cooked perfectly the way i like it.  The asparagus and potatoes au grautin were awesome.  A must if you dine out regularly!
Steak was good. A little on the salty side but did the job. I would go back but would look at other options first.
Clean, very tasty, and I love the creativity in the dishes.  Well worth the price and I recommend trying different dishes because with each new dish I try I have not been disappointed.
Amazing food. Awesome owner. Just great everything. Love this place, and definitely plan on going back! :)
We didn't have reservations so we didn't get to try the food, but the guy in front was so rude so I don't think we'll be back.
Omikase was not worth the price. Service wasn't great. The server told us no sharing, which was a big turn-off. Would not recommend.
Great sandwiches! the bread was superb. I had a BLTDA (Bacon, lett, Tomato, date, apple) w/chicken. Yummm. such a cute spot.
$5 for a drink and original pollo bowl (rice, beans, chicken). Not a bad deal for a fast food place. It reminds me of a cheaper Chipotle. Definitely get the avocado salsa!
The Mrs and I shared a turkey and pesto and we liked it. Better than the other stuff around. We got lucky as a group of people came in after us and still weren't served as we were leaving.
Just hope you're there on a good day! Buffets are not what they used to be in Vegas.
this business is closed :(
Parking is a nightmare and the vendor's produce looks half dead every time I've been. There isn't anything here you can't get in better shape at the grocery store.
PUT A MENU ONLINE!\n\nFB page doesn't work - hurting takeout business!
Clean and cute.   Oh yeah and good food.  Service is pretty good, a little slow when they get busy, which is a lot because it's not very big.  They have wooden menus!!!
Our favorite Thai place in the valley. It is small so be prepared to wait on the weekend. Yellow curry, pepper steak and pad Thai is the best.
Muddy sound, unimpressive seats...meh.  It seemed pretty worn down for being such a new theater.  I'll stick to one of the two big chains.
Update. Holy crap - went back and ordered two scoops of ice cream. Instead was given world's biggest blob of ice cream in a huge cup. Which is good or bad, depending.
Amazing ice cream - what I appreciate the most is the natural high quality ingredients....meyer lemon is insane and the owner Helen is so helpful. What an amazing small local business!!
I love the mint chocolate chip! Real mint leaves instead of imitation flavoring. The peppermint is fabulous also! Really, you can't go wrong.
Since my last review I've eliminated dairy from my diet..boo hoo. But no worries, they have at least 4 vegan options all the time! Coconut sorbet and chocolate sorbet are amazing!
Best in Vegas, bar none.  Thanks Mr. Wynn for repeated great stays and memories.  We'll keep coming back.
Great hotel, but be cautious of the hidden fees. They will charge your credit card without your approval and dislike children staying there.
Every meal I have here is good.  I love the pancakes and breakfast burrito.  The staff is very nice and helpful (love Donna Jo), the service is great and the price is right.  :)
Great coffee but don't go here if you're in a hurry. They employ only college students who are over the top friendly but who also think keeping people waiting in line for 15 minutes while they talk to their friends is totally cool.
So apparently the food was horrible according to 4 people so i know i wont be back for food even though the gravy cheese curd fries looked yummy enough
My favorite Starbucks location.  Staff aways polite and friendly.  Clean with lots of space.  It's very convenient and easy to get in and out of parking lot.  Drive through gets me in and out in a hurry.
Never had a bad drink from this store. The drive thru can get a little long, but it's worth the wait.
Great atmosphere, good food and good service. If you are in the Belmont area, a must stop. I had a burger which was great in this little hometown Irish pub.
Great place will be back... Jock welcomed us had good conversation and answered questions i had no problem will be back
The tacos were cold and the dude was sketchy.  I probably could have told this just by looking but I had gotten lost on my way to ginger's and was hungry.\n\nAt least it was cheap.
Good food with very reasonable prices
Love their tacos. Service is fast and friendly. Place is clean..bathrooms clean. Need to be better at keeping the guacamole made so people don't have to wait.
Good ribs, amazing hot links and service with a smile!
Besides the racist joke about all single mothers are black, my nipple piercing went fairly quickly. They hurt like hell but I like it.
Amazing....hyper clean, friendly and very nice overall.  Plenty of relaxation and naked bodies for all.  If you have a naked phobia this might not be the place for you or stay upstairs. I'm a regular especially in the dry salt room!
i'm in love! wow omg this is my honey comb hideaway. Their are lots of places nearby to eat also. It's off the beaten path so it's my definition of in the CUTS :)
Horrible customer service! I will not return! If I could give this place zero stars, I would!
My wife and I come here frequently and always get the vegetable curry. Keep up the good work!
Yuk.  No casino.  No view.  Small open shared pool. \n\nWhy would you want to go to Las Vegas and stay at a hotel like this?  \n\nLuckily the staff was nice enough to not charge us for bailing.
Saggy beds piss me off
Slow and lazy people. Took 3 hours with appointment to change the tires. Wheels were not torqued to correct specs, thanks god and I didn't get into accident.
This place SUCKS my whole family threw up 2014  Santa fe SUCKS 2009 Santa fe was awesome don't eat here just go to in and out
This place is over rated. Having Tyson's chicken nuggets on the menu is not healthy. The turkey club and salad tasted like shit. I'm never going back there ever again.
The service was good but I can't say the same about the food.  My food was super greasy and it just did not taste good.  The prices are kind of high too.
The food is always awesome. The time it takes to come out is a little to long some times. Regardless it's a great place to eat and healthy.\n\nEdit: wow the article about their cookie was interesting. To good to be true. :/
I thought the frozen yogurt was good and the concept worked real well. People easily got their  frozen yogurt in a timely fashion and wow they were packed!
We waited for 20 minutes before we left.  Nobody so much as said hello. Have never gone back!
WTF YO? 5 people on line, and service is madd slow for a busy crowd.  Never come at lunchtime 12 noon and expect quick service from THIS Cane's EVER!!
Great food and nice size portions. Prices are pretty good. One of my new favorite places to eat.
Very fresh delicious chicken strips. . The texas toast is soft and delicious with just a slight toasted top .....very well worth the stop in VEGAS before heading home to los Angeles
Comfort food at a low price. This place is packed consistently for obvious reasons so be prepared to wait because seating is limited.
The wait staff was nice, The service was good, The food was as good as it always is at CPK. If you like CPK.. You will like it here
What a great place. The location is tucked back in this little strip mall area. The creamy broccoli soup was wonderful and I really enjoyed my Mediterranean wrap. Will keep this on my list for future lunch spots.
Good food, but the service is so disappointing its not worth the trip.
I came in to get a pedicure with,my friend and we had a lively time. Great atmosphere with legit technicians.
Salted caramel brownie.  Need I say more?
Good desserts and nice cool, calm atmosphere!
I love the eclectic atmosphere. ..I also love the assortment of desserts!! The lines are loooong but it moves pretty fast. My favorite sweet is the Salted Caramel Brownie. .soooooo yummy!!!!
Good stuff!!!
The Sicilian Sub here is to die for. It's made fresh right when you order. The dough is slightly crispy and soft when you bite into it and you don't want it end! I live in Surprise and still drive out to get this sub!
I don't why you would go there. DId see a few flamingos, ducks and koi. But I just don't see the point. It may take 10-15 minutes. There are too many things to do on the strip. I would avoid it.
really good stuff.  Goos sushi, great show, great service (ask for Smatt)...  we had toms of fun!
Yummo... But I wouldn't recommend the Hooters Roll...
Great French inspired cuisine in a beautiful Carefree desert setting.  You truly do feel a world away here and at Binkley's.  As good as the other stuff is, the biggest impression came from their inspired take on potato chips and fries.
Loved every bite! And the staff was very friendly. Food came out quickly and tasted amazing! I will surely become a regular.
I usually really like pita jungle but this location seems to be poorly run. Plenty of empty tables but the food took forever and they claimed the kitchen was backed up. Stems on grapes in the salad. Graffiti in the bathroom. Disappointed.
Love the chicken humus! Lots of flavor and chicken is warm and tender. You get 2 large pitas so I recommend splitting it with someone if you plan on getting a meal too.
Decent service, and good food. I like their happy hour. I wouldn't come here if I was starving but portion sizes are adequate.
Extremely poor seating layouts, be prepared to pay 50% extra on top of your $10.00 ticket for \"premium seats\" that are really the only seats that allow you to watch the movie without breaking your neck or sitting next to a wall.
Best theatre in Pittsburgh....just hate battling the traffic over the bridge to get here...
We were starving and it was the only reasonably priced place open at 9:30pm in Northern Scottsdale.  The brisket was edible and the sides were mediocre.
My wife and I looked forward to eating here for weeks. We decided to get one of our favorites tonight, bbq pork ribs. Let me say... extremely disapointed! Neither one of us would recommend this place.
I LOVE the lunch specails here... Panang Chicken is my favorite mmmm mmm And you can adjust your spice level, I always have to tone it down just a little on the spice!!
First time and food was good. Ribs fell off te bone and loved the baked beans.
Awesome service!! Love the Kona Berry Bowl!!
Disgusting behavior, meat market. I was sickened by the experience.
Sooo Sad that this location has been closed. Now we have to drive to the one located in central phoenix.
A very nice dinning experience.
Honestly, the worst service I've ever had. Tried it more than once, and I will never return.
All the food is awesome and most of it is homemade... Definitely not freezer food. Bartenders are super friendly. Beer selection is always changing and always above average. Awesome happy hour deals. Overall good atmosphere. Highly recommend it for drinking AND eating.
Not very good. My spring roll was bland and the peanut sauce was yucky. Vermicelli bowl was full of bean sprouts not noodles.
Place was dirty and did not serve vegetarians. They guy said over the phone they did. Otherwise nice people.
Surprisingly, it was one of very few things open when I went out looking for food. The service was good. Food was OK.
2 words...\nFalafel burger...
Great little rest stop along the strip. Numerous selections in burger styles. I highly recommend the chili burger.
Cool burger place at the Mirage!
Eat lunch here today, ordered a beer any tacos, the tacos were good but the glass on my beer was broken and cut my lip, the waitress brought me a new glass and no discount on my bill... Thanks for the cut lip.
Pricey but well its in The Mirage so i guess i needs to be pricey. Great burger though. If you are in the Mirage try it out. :)
So so burger,good service. I was not impressed w food.
I always love am pm :) came in here for a drink on my way home, and some gas before it doubles, yet again! \n\nClean,quick and lots of drink options!
Great place.  Great food...piping hot and delicious.  Excellent service.  House chianti was exceptional too.  I would just request to sit on the left side when you come in.  It looked to be quieter over there.  The right side is adjacent to the open kitchen.
Tasty burgers, shake and fries. Fries weren't hot, just warm.
There's nothing fancy about, rather plain actually.\nClean. Inexpensive. Quick. Good. \nFairly healthy depending on your choices.\nI always just get a simple chicken Teriyaki bowl.\nGreat value.
The Cup O' Karma is such a neat coffee shop, it has a lot of character and flair and a great iced coffee.
The product was enjoyed by our Pittsburgh family.  The delivery was there for everyone to enjoy and the three flavors that we had ordered, Cheese, Carmel and Movie Theatre were equally enjoyed.  Excellent place to do business with excellent service provided.
McKoys is great !!! My coworkers and myself rarely miss a Thursday night there. We love the 50 cent wings but everything else is fantastic too. Great  food, great atmosphere, fantastic wait staff, sometimes the only problem is finding a parking space!!
I like it. No problems! No issues :)
The coffee was hot and it was right around the corner from the condo. Grande bold every morning and didn't have to wait.
Had a great late night here. Molly was awesome! I always love a dive bar and this guy takes the cake! Bras strung around the bar and a gorgeous gal makin the drinks. This is a great spot to unwind after a long night at work.
Close and good lunch specials!
Arrived @ 6:15pm on Sat without a reservation, restaurant was fairly full.  We were seated immediately though.  No one even acknowledged our presence for 15 minutes.  We got up and left, once again, without being acknowledged.  Disappointed.
***This restaurant has closed.***
Being from the Midwest, I'd never had Del Taco. Can't really say I've missed anything: the bag probably had more flavor than the cold, limp fries and unmelted cheese on the all-lettuce \"chicken\" tacos.
they have everything you need at a really good price. dude has always been helpful not steering you to spend more money but getting the right stuff. that will keep me coming back.
Food is just ok. I'm not asking for culinary genius but something that isn't dry and hard to eat. However iron city was half off so all was not lost. Waiters would take food around to every table asking who it belonged to. This happened all night long.
Hey, they're gonna stop selling smokes soon!
This place is always out of somthing. the Dunkin Donuts on the east coast are 100% better
Just passed by this DD the other week, and sad to see it is now CLOSED.  Blame the economy I suppose.
Good food and good sushi. Pad Thai is good and portions are generous especially at dinner.
Pretty good deli sandwich but a hassle for parking. Love the selection of things to buy sorta like a little market in NY!
They have the BEST springrolls---not fried!  We also love their pad thai---spiced to your palate.
Tons of classes and equipment. Indoor and outdoor pool and hot tubs. Great food in the cafe. There are saunas and all kinds of other amenities in the locker room. Can get busy during peak times.
Ok for a quick lunch. The server was nice, but the food was average at best.
Toooooooo freaking bright ,  i am gettin lightbulb burn.   Servers sitting at the bar with their uniform.  The bartender took 8!minites to acknowled me.   Toooooooo bright! Not likelly to return :-(.
My husband and I were totally impressed by the dining experience. Everything, from good quality, presentation to service are top notch. This is our first time dining at a Michelin 3 star restaurant and Joel Robuchon definitely lives up to its reputation.
How could any Joel Robuchon restaurants disappoint you. Needless to say,  this was my best dining experience ever, from food to service to ambiance,  everything was superb.
So fresh! Fantastic customer service as well. I love that they have a drive thru too!! So lucky to live so close to this place.
Tasty... Odd ambiance of 50s diner with mediocre service but good food... I'd come again
It's nice to have a family dinner but no kid menu makes it difficult. Aside from the extra expense the place is cool very 50's diner retro like. Food was good, traditional Vietnamese style. Very laid back and casual. Delicious spring rolls.
I don't typically like Asian cuisine but When I came here I had the shrimp pho, It was so delicious! If you like spicy and seafood, this is your dish. And service here is friendly and I love the decor, it's so cute.
Enjoy the Vietnamese food the staff was friendly huge portions I would definitely get a couple of dishes for 5 friends and everybody share family style.
Nothing to rave about, it was good. My first time here.
Food is always good.
Service is good overall. The have happy hour all day. The food is not healthy, but treats great! The Blue Ribbon burger is delicious. My bf liked his colossus burger. The fries are decent,  but love that they have a range of dipping choices for them.
I wasn't a fan of the place. Not trying to be rude, the bread was stale. When we walked in there was only one other person during the lunch hour. Our order had several mistakes too. I would be hesitant to come back after this.
I love stoping by Anthology to pick up cards for special occasions and holidays.  It is very charming shop run by lovely people.  If you are looking for quality paper goods and the sweetest rubber stamps around, Anthology is surely the place for you.
Exactly like a panera minus the awesome green tea.  Their sandwiches are good, so are their soups, but I never feel like anything is fresh.  I know their soups come frozen and they just heat it.  Still satisfies when you need to drop in for a quick lunch.
Best place for healthy kids meals
Great atmosphere in this place. Had a huge booth overlooking the bar. Had the prime rib, and was happy with it. Good place, a little pricey, but you already knew that.
I just enjoy eating at the Keg
I really did like this place.  The food is very good.  I really liked the French onion soup & their burgers are great, as is the steak.  The prices are a good value and I will be going back.
This is one Cool place!  I love it and the clothes and shoes - My nieces loved it (two real dogs to play with)!  Today was only my third time visiting this store and just my second visit since the change over!
Went here for lunch and the lunch specials were so affordable. Our server was a sweet heart and the fod was very good.
Everything was delicious -- my caesar salad delisch and so large! Filet mignon was done to perfection and it had some rub on it that tasted very good. My friend had salmon and raved about it. Great place with Kobe beef!
Great food, amazing service from our server Brent was superb!\n\nArrowhead Grill is the nicest place West of Central.
3 measly chicken fingers on a pile of soggy fries. How do you mess up chicken fingers?! 9 bucks...no thank you.
The pizza is great and it's so original! The price is good and the food is great. But don't ask them for ranch it will highly offend them, they say that people use ranch to cover up the taste of bad pizza. The cheese is amazing!
I have to agree with Taric W.'s review.
It's cheap....not the best food, not the best quality. But it's fine to eat when you've been walking around shopping for 5 hours. I finally tried the meatballs and they were alright, but I wouldn't call them good.
clean and friendly. What else can you say...\n\nI diddd buy some filet mignon that was at a price that made the food even better ;j\n\nR\\_
Good ambience. Looks like the cheesecake factory. This place is super busy on the weekends so call ahead. Got the feel of an upscale olive garden. Not impressive but not disappointing either.
Tried them twice now, and as far as Italian goes, pretty bland.  Service was kind if stuffy too
Netflix is awesome. I am not sure how renting videos could be any easier. I just wish they would rent some games to me as well... oh well.\n\nUpdate: They never have any new content regarding feature films.
Decent food here but come on, is it really the food you come here for? I like coming here when I have my irish cravings and need a good ol glass of guiness.
Incredible!  Very friendly service and wonderful food.  My husband and I tried the brown stew chicken and the oxtail.  Both excellent!  Prices were very inexpensive for the quality and quantity of food.  A must try!
Pasta was good. wine was good. but I cant trust an ITALIAN restaurant that puts Herseys syrup on their tiramisu. Sorry.
We were down in the area for the arts festival and the park toward the point was all torn up and under construction. Not sure what's going on there but hopefully it will be an improvement.
I was very excited to get the opportunity to play Shadow this week.  It was everything I expected it to be.  Great layout, perfect fairways and greens, very friendly staff, and great forecaddies.  If you get the opportunity, you have to play it!
Good, fast food.\n\nI stop here every so often when I'm walking on Craig for an inexpensive, but filling meal. Go for the sub combos, easily the best deal on the menu and make sure you ask them to toast it!
I dunno, I was drunk when I got there.  It's amateur night there every night! They have a mechanical bull.  You might find yourself looking up at the sky wondering if it was 8 seconds.  Trust me it wasnt.
Terrible service. Very unprofessional would never go back. Chose a different location in the epicentre if you want a good time and to be treated well.
I had the special (a chicken sandwich) and it was okay.  I've only been once and it seemed a little pricey...but I could be wrong.  I will probably head back sometime though.  Good place to play Trivia on Tuesday.
Film selection here is not quite as good as at Concord Mills, but the theaters offer a smaller crowd, clean theaters, and most of the big hits.  It's a chain theater, so not really anything else of note.  Average size screens, average size seats, typically horrendous prices.
Yummy pizza. The garlic dipping sauce and sweet pizza sauce go well together. It was delivered hot and crisy in half the time they said. Super nice woman who answered the phone.
Yelp reviews made this place sound neat. The place has no ventilation . I walked in for 30 seconds and walked right out.  I am pretty sure I got cancer !
Decent. Nothing to write home about good place for an appetizer and beer. However the main menu has an identity crisis (bar and grill is not fried rice or egg rolls maybe dumplings not so much). Sometimes small bar drama does not need to be shared with all.
I heard this is called the Sh*take factory. Thats accurate
Food are little bit salty but the service is great. If you prefer something more special to try than buffet. Stratta would be a not bad to try. I highly recommended the tata beef appetizer.
pre-show dinner.  Excellent food and great service.
Wow this is the late night food at the Wynn? Pretty excellent service and food all around. My fettuccini carbonara w poached eggs was absolutely delicious. Pretty ridiculously nice for the late spot smack in the middle of a casino.
Food was good but service was terrible. Went with large group of 12 to celebrate a  birthday. Plan was to eat have a few drinks then take in a movie. Ending up tsking 2 hours and thats not counting the time to eat
A topless diner near the Olympic Stadium. Decent diner food, lots of security lounging about, and what looked to be a few regulars hanging out. \n\nFYI - I was the only female patron!
Good hotel. Nothing special or fancy but very clean and very friendly staff.\nRestaurant is completely overpriced. Food is so so. \nMenu has not changed since at least 7 month (could be longer).
I suppose that's what you can expect for the very reasonable prices. Food heavy on fat, light on taste, and cavernous decor.\n\nGood for a group looking to eat quality food on the cheap, but not for much else.
Classic drink food. Just Noodles, no frills, open late, cheap as dirt, served super quick in massive heart-stopping portions. I don't know for sure that it's MSG laden, but the hallucinations suggest that yes.
We took home a baguette and three fantastic portions of the charcuterie, plus homemade cornichons for $19,20. \n\nBTW, the Today show was visiting from NYC when I was there. I love this place.
i'd go here lots if i lived here. affordable prices (esp. happy hour), close to lots of stuff and the terasse is perfect for people watching. mediterranean menu items were simple and refreshing. perfect for a hot and humid day.
Cool restaurant in the heart of \"The Village\". I had a great experience, and would recommend it to adults. You can have great fun especially during the summer.
I had the burget and it was OK. Found it a bit dry, but still overall tasty. The calamari was good and a large portion.\n\nI do not recommend the poutine. The gravy ruined it.
Doughy. Is it really a bagel? Great atmosphere and fun to watch them flip the bagel. Got it to go and walked down the street munching away.
Sorry... not as good at Fairmount! The all-dressed bagel was as good as naked, with no salt to be found.
Sweet & chewy.  Great price & fast service.  I'll be back!
Been here a couple times.  This place has great deserts, but the service is LAME. Slow, non attentive, and rude.  This place can easily be 4 stars if not for the service.
Cool atmosphere, nice hot chocolate and in one word : Chocolate heaven
Didn't have a chance to try it unfortunately. We waited around twenty minutes at our table and no one came to take our order but there were five servers standing around chatting at the front so we left!  Keep in mind I've worked as a server for over five years
Excellent food and atmosphere.  All tapas we tried were amazing (olives, spanish tortilla, cod fish fritters, fideos,serrano and cheese).  Churros were a hit.  Paella was mediocre.
Have you ever asked a cab driver to take you to a good place to party? This was my first time and most likely the last.
The veal tartar was off the hook and the service was really good.  Great wine selection as well.  If you find yourself in Montreal this will be a wonderful treat.
Our favourite Japanese rest in our neighbourhood.  Small place.  Nice sushi and sash ini selection.  I enjoyed Udon noodles there last time I went...but the Tempura was a bit on the soggy side.
Excellent brunch/breakfast.  This place offers a variety a breakfast dishes that taste amazing.  I am not a breakfast fan, but this place changed my mind
One of the larger Second Cup around.  Always tons of fresh goods.\n\nCan get busy on Sundays where students come to study.
not worth the cost of the plate! paid 38$ for a chicken on a plate. no sauce and the vegtables were put on a side plate to share amongst 5 people! i was shocked!. high prices for no reason and waited forever to get served.
Family-Friendly. Affordable prices. Lots of patrons. But food was pretty average.
Second time here.  Great selection of brews, but the service is aloof.  Not sure if it is because we're Americans, but we weren't loud/obnoxious.  Just out to get a few brews before the night.
Fun restaurant, great for the cause you are going for, simple setup and service will of course vary depending on the night as many do it out of pure generosity.
yummy, great salad bar, but wish they had more veggie meat options though!
Delicious! And the owner is fabulous - very proud of his restaurant and the long family ties to it.
Il mange, elle boit, c'est comme ci, comme \u00e7a.
Looks and feel like 99c store, or $1 store with prices higher than at Macy's. You have to crawl between shelves. Do not go, do not waste your time.
Cadre sympathique, bon service et surtout de bonnes bi\u00e8res
In a city like Montreal, you have to have great food to survive.  Unfortunately, this place focuses all energy on appearance and being trendy, with the food taking second stage.  Unless you're the type of person who just wants to be seen, it's not worth the long line.
Incredible food!!! My boyfriend said he had the best Benedict ever! The Benedict are a must!!! And smoothies are amazing!! Just get it all!
Came by for dinner today and noticed that it's closed. Unclear if it is permanent or not.
Pretty good supermarket in terms of selection. Otherwise I thought it was a bit overpriced and was disappointed in the apparent freshness and selection of the items in the bakery section. Small wine selection, but the wines in stock included a few decent picks.
L'endroit id\u00e9al pour un rendez-vous d'affaire ou pour \u00e9tudier... le tout autour d'un bon caf\u00e9!
My friend brought me here to try the dim sum.  Coming from the area I grew up in the states, I've never had really good Chinese food.  I was pleasantly surprised at how delicious and delicate the dumplings were.  The prices were good too.
Waited 1 hour for food!  Someone ordered Benedict no cheese and a bowl with 2 poached eggs arrived! My sunny side up were runny.  $40 for 2 breakfasts and coffee! Waitress didn't even speak English! Ill never go back here again. Worst breakfast ever.
Nice place for a brunch. A bit expensive though and no pancakes!
Got the burger of the month.  Was good but not exceptional.  The menu is a little pricy for the quality and service.
Great new SAQ. The 4th within walking distance to my house. Hey... if you're going to have a drinking problem, have it in the Plateau;)
Great place; fantastic patio and the prices seem fair.  Sitting out front is also pleasant in the sunshine as the back patio is almost all shade.  So many tourist traps around this area, we found this one listed in Frommer's and were not disappointed.
In summer it's a great place if you're looking for a terrasse.  They also have live jazz music which adds a nice touch.  The pizzas aren't that great but the crepes and salads are usually a decent bet.
Uninspired food, cold inattentive service. I will not come back.
Cheap eats and a nice environment, very clean unlike other pho places in chinatown
I worked there. Believe me, you do not want to eat there. \nHygiene? methinks not.
We choose this hotel based on price and location  \nThe continental breakfast was good\nNothing fancy  just a place to sleep\nThere was free wi fi
I've heard good things: http://en.maplaza.ca/adresse_des_comerces-rep-addr
All the dishes are so well presented. I am a fan of Maiko Sushi the fish is fresh,the service is nice. The private room is great for parties of group gatherings. Great place. Great sushi
Food and service were just ok. We left our camera on the table after the meal. One waitress told us she saw it and kept it inside, then the ones inside denied and took it. Have left stuff at many places before, hard to find such dishonesty in North America.
Nice music, great location.
Decent mocha. Hipster heaven. Loud and angry music. Brought me back to my youth.\nThe food looked pretty good, and the drinks were cheap. Want to go back for the \"remedy\" which has ginger and whiskey.
not sure why people love this place. It is unique but not chic, more bohemian or punk i think...if u r into Italian designers, this is not ur place
Very good authentic Chinese food.  Located upstair in Chinatown alley.
The second visit made ALL the difference.\nGreat, if not amazing, service, and a super happy table of stuffed people.\nIn other words: win!\nMore dinners will be had.
Good service, tasty food. However, I have never been to Tibet so I can't compare it to the authentic one.
if you don't eat here at least once in your life you haven't really lived a fulfilling life .. from the smile and the service the food is just to die for .. ONE NOTICE don't use the wash room !
Wow. Some amazingly gourmet poutine here. Gravy obviously made from painstakingly reduced beef stock, rather than thickeners.  Deliciously sauteed red peppers. Fresh curds. A serious step above your average Montreal poutine.
Great restaurant! I've never been disappointed. The food is consistently good, and the service is very professional.
I really like this place - second time coming good for mixed groups of vegetarians and meat eaters- second time coming and very good. I really like the soup (veg lemon grass) Plus it's bring your own wine!
You can't go wrong with this place. Anything you order will melt your heart and have you wishing you lived near this bakery. Sometimes there is a line and nowhere to sit but who cares. Learn to be patient , walk to the nearest park and enjoy bliss.
Best croissance that's all u gotta say.....
Good food in a very relaxed atmosphere.  This is the place to have dinner if you are thinking asian and then heading over to hang at the Waverly or Cafe Olympico or maybe grabbing some good Scotch at Whisky Cafe.
Schwartz's is good but not great. \n\nThey are famous for being condescending but I feel this is mostly an act to keep up Schwartz's reputation.
This is easily the worst supermarket in Montr\u00e9al. They actually follow you around the store to make sure you don't steal anything. And when you finally do make it to the checkout counter with your rotten vegetables... The cashiers never say hello. Never!
Great little theater in montreal...not only do they show some pretty cool movies, but it's way cheaper than the standard theaters..\n\nalso, note the Metro grocery store right next door, great place to stock up before the movie :)
J'y vais pour le kokosh, une brioche roul\u00e9e au chocolat \u00e0 se rouler par terre
I just had appetizers (supersalty) and my date ordered a beer. Then my other friends phone got stolen :(
First poutine I've had in a long time. It was quick and I enjoyed it. If you want poutine and its 5:00AM this is the place for you. Late night, and delicious.
I had heard abt there so called BLIZZARD but was very disappointed with the taste or   Flavor or I would say was that an nice cream
Great atmosphere, good food, a nice choice of lunch sandwiches, not too many so it won't take forever to choose. Raspberry Soda is delicious.
This small cafe has the best sandwiches and cookies in town! All the waiters are very helpful and friendly and the atmosphere is cheerful.
croissants were perfect,  delicious sandwiches,  really sparse menu,  had the Cuban and wife had the cajun chicken. great location,  hip,  quirky,  very pleasant service.
Great shisha, reallly small and busy place. Friendly Arabic environment\n\nThe street is totally under construction, so you its a maze to get to the front door
Best Poutine!!!\nThis is, hands down, the best place to grab a Poutine. They serve their Poutine on Belgium fries which elevates it to the next level. The fries alone are delicious!
a fine repertory cinema/cinema museum, not to mention the high shrine to Quebec film
Caught in the rain!! We stumbled in here and had a coffee and a lemon tart.  Yum!!  Service was great and we were del get a table.  Didn't eat but the food looked good.
Excellent smell but nothing outstanding. Good portion size.
Really Excellent food, with an authentic feel. I've had Vietnamese food in many locations in Montreal (and other cities) and this one ranks high for service, and overall food quality. Looking forward to trying something new on their menu on a future visit !
This was one of the worst Chinese food meals I've ever had. Diabetics should steer clear of the General Tao chicken -- it would be less sugary if they just doused it in maple syrup. I've had better food out of a catering truck at half the price.
Love it! Sundays are crazy. I've never seen so many beautiful women in one spot at a time. Ay karumba
Must visit if your in downtown Montreal! Atmosphere is welcoming. Music is good and upstairs has outdoor lounging. The only problem is the bar gets very crowded as well as the dance floor which makes it difficult to maneuver because the people don't move for shit
absolutely amazing experience, from kind staff to fantastic food. Oysters are to die! It also must be one of the most romantic places i've visited in years. A bit hard to find since no big signs so just look for the number over the door
Average. OK winelist, food basic Italian without much thought, ambience OK. Would I recommend it? Not if I could walk somewhere closer....
Sat at the bar.  Very friendly, even charged my phone for me.  Beer good.  Flat bread and bruschetta great post hockey game fare.  Convivial, good service, good food, good drinks.
Had a late lunch with the wife and decided to try Les 3 Brasseurs on St-Denis. Place was nice and clean warm even on a gloomy day. Beer was good. Service as well. But a 15$ nothing special burger served with frozen fries. Big disappointment.
Bah! Je n'ai pas appr\u00e9ci\u00e9 mon repas. Je n'y retourne pas
Oh my lord no! The dancers here sure are skinny! In truth, the clientele do seem to be having a good time.
This hotel is absolutely gorgeous. Wonderful service, clean rooms, and interesting lay-outs. Not really sure how I feel about the bathroom situation, but the waterfall shower was really nice.
Bonnes bi\u00e8res, bonne ambiance et bien situ\u00e9. C'est bien qu'ils aient am\u00e9lior\u00e9 leur menu bouffe.
Very polite and nice service. My first time thai foods experience so can't judge too much but ok.
Not review for this location.\n\nThe bathroom was so gross and small. GROSSSSSS! I thought I would give local coffee a support. Too disappointed!
Shawarma, pita and garlic sauce can not go wrong with some vegeatables.  Their hummus is alright, and service depends on who you get, some the friendliest in the world others seem to hate their job.  Stick with the Shawarma and it is a no fail.
Montreal is a great and vibrant city but PET Airport is cramped, dated, dark, and congested.  Its too bad that everyone gave up on Mirabel Airport.
Nice to be back home...has some problem with Nexus check-in machines...Staff was most helpful and understanding
They have  naturopath that works there-great advice-and free!Just everyone can hear your problem so be aware of that when consulting. They don't stalk all the products I want to see. The owner is close minded.Isn't very giving.
Service merdique!  La serveuse m'a demand\u00e9 pourquoi je lui a avais donn\u00e9 10% de tip!  Quelle insulte!
Amazing cappuccino!! Free wifi. I would definitely go back.
Had a great stay! Best housekeeping staff! Carol is great.  Lady at c/I could have been nicer but everyone else made up for it! Love the views. Room service was fast and tasty.  Will come back
Great affordable place and all the food is very fresh. I visit a lot as it is close to my house. Tried quite a few menu items but my favourites are the rare beef and brisket soup and their mixed dumplings and imperial rolls. Yum :)
Good ambient and waiters are friendly.\nBeen a soon of a Portuguese family I was a little disappointed with the Black Cod I ordered, missing a little taste and definitely not enough sides available.\nWould give another 1/2* if was available.
Good price, good place! \nVery easy to find what you are looking for and they have something for every budget so its great.\nThe only down side would be the location.\nVery hard to find parking during the day.
Came here on a Saturday night during labour day weekend, the service wasn't good, but the place was busy. We were seated and it took about 20 minutes until a server waited on us. I had the braised lamb shank and it was okay.
Visiting for a week on business. Great local beer! Definitely worth checking out if you're in the area. I recommend the Honey  Brown. They also had a local band playing. Offers seating inside and two balconies.
Terrible gym, bad hours, close entire gym for maintenance without warning, lots of staff that do nothing because weights always everywhere, so many people there you have to wait for everything...good reviews here only for price which is pretty good.
Really nice Steakhouse. The food was absolutely fine and the stuff very friendly. We will come back as soon we are back in Montreal!
Food was really good! Very good service too
Spacious & clean .\nNo refrigerator or safe on the room.\nDid not loose anything though .\nBring your swimwear with you . The pool is OK and fairly large . 4 people could do lapses with a bit of maneuvering .
Interesting place to say the least. Crowd was good and lively and the beer was priced fairly. They have a foozball table and a good selection of music.
12.50 pitchers of Molson ex, staff are very friendly and welcoming and really good pub food.
I went there once, nothing special. I think Soup and Noodles across the street really kills their business.
Had Buffalo Chicken sandwich, it was not that bad.   My friend ordered chicken tenders, it was horrible.   Good place for people who had drinking.   Nice environment.
Very good French crepes.  I had the chocolate covered strawberries and banana.  Sweet deliciousness!
Nice drink menu and a great balcony with a view of the city. Much better than the club/pub options down the street. Very trendy vibe but worth it to avoid loud club beats on a weekend!
the chicken shwarma sandwich was pretty good, but not the best i've had.  the sandwich was dripping with grease, which might freak other people out, but i'm ok with it.  the potatoes with the garlic cream sauce is off the chain though!
A Montreal mainstay. If you are looking for chicken schwarma forget the chain restos and head to Boustans.
Gross.\n\nBut thats what you do when nothing else is open at 2 am...\n\nI am happy I didn't get sick the next day
Very good place - the food was good - the dancers made it fun - a great place for a group.
Ate there tonight. Took quite awhile to be waited on. Manicotti was good, fish was overcooked but okay. Only complaint was the service. Asked four times for water and never got it.
Nice location. Too bad Westmount Park is just a bit too far to make it before your ice cream melts! Delicious excellent ice cream and nice place to sit and enjoy.
i always like going there...the food is always good and service pretty good!\nlove the outside terrace.
Expensive and the service is hit or miss yet the food is good.
I personally thought this place was terrible. I ordered 2 cheese slices and I could barely eat it. I felt that the cheese and sauce tasted cheap....I certainly didn't think it was tasty or anything like that.
Meatballs were fantastic, service was great, the rest of the menu was good but in general too salty.
Spinning classic 80's and 90's music all night.
Overpriced and nothing to write home about. The place was amazing when it opened (in the 80s or 90s) but like many places that have become staples they no longer try. And there's nothing worse than cynical, overpriced food.
This place was great! Not a fancy place by any means. But the guy was very nice, the croissants were delicious and everything was so cheap in comparison to other places in Montreal. Would highly recommend it if you are looking for an authentic french croissanterie experience.
Our destination for brunch when we stop on Nuns Island, Montreal. Nothing special about the food but reliable. The patio is quite nice on a summer's evening.
Great location in the downtown area, great coffees, super nice staff. Did I say I thought it was great? Yes, I did. . .
nice beer selection but food was pretty subpar.
Pretty shitty place. Bad atmosphere, bad food.
Had a pitcher outside and people-watched for an hour. \n\nLots of outdoor seating which is good but I didn't check out the inside or try any of the food.
Slow servers.\n\nSoda was only refilled when I yelled out to the server.\n\nNothing too special.
Friendly service and a good place for a burger, thumbs up!
Pretty fun spot. Food is not amazing, but it's outdoor seating makes up for that. Cheese and fruit appetizer is quite good, I think appetizers and drinks are swc's specialty.
Although the food here has always been impressive on many visits, i have to say im a bit dissapointed to see my favorite dish go from $17.95 to $27 in the space of a couple years....
This is coming from someone with a Lebanese background, this is hands down one of my favourite Lebanese restaurants (outside of Lebanon lol)! A bit pricey but definitely worth it! Staff are super nice, food is super amazing!\nI HIGHLY recommend this place
Service is a hit or miss, as is their seafood. Fortunately its a BYOW and their pizza is delicious (real pizza oven).
Nothing special about this place. The food is ok and the service is slow. Not enough space between tables so its almost like your having dinner with the tables next to you.
I liked it. The food was good. They had really nice samosas. I would have to eat again to confirm 5 stars but the prices seemed right to me. Very nice.
Do not order sushi from here. The rolls are 3km in diameter and the soy sauce is so salty you may dehydrate on the spot. They use chicken fried rice in their sushi  Chow mein is also questionable. Save your money and your taste buds.
Super Nice setting. Large outdoor terrace. Large well lit and decorated dining room. Excellent  and experienced service. High class. \n\nFood is fresh, classical, and very well prepared. \n\nWine list is priced OK with many popular choices.
Poor food quality. Not worth the price.
We have been getting  their donuts for many years  and ohhhhh aren't they  the most delicious donuts in town... Only maybe not add good as Krispy Kreme.  Quality ingredients are easy to notice
Great vet clinic. They have full service including a fabulous groomer.
Awesome experience. Price point was great. They offered a free checked bag and wine and a snack on the flight. Who could ask for anything more.
A Montreal classic that is worth a visit at least once. Orange Julep is definitely the star, but hotdog with poutine wasn't bad.
Crap. Food is meh, pricy and bla service. No ambiance, waiters look always stressed out. Don't eat here.
I LOVE MARATHONS!! Everything is fantastic. It always tastes the same which equals HEAVENLY... that's all I can say.
Prix \u00e9lev\u00e9 pour le type de nourriture. Par contre, la qualit\u00e9 des produits ainsi que le go\u00fbt sont au rendez-vous!
Belle ambiance, beau menu.  Je vous conseille vivement de r\u00e9server...car c'est souvent plein.
Veggies taste sour, their rice is disgusting, and they can't even properly cook a steak.\n\nThe service was alright, but the food is just...disappointing.
let me just say off the bat the food was good.but my booth I sat in there was sticky stuff on it and the fork had crust on it.i asked for water and I got diet coke.th3 staff was friendly.
I could not find any staff to help me find a hard drive enclosure that I was looking for. No one was available or even in the store on a Saturday afternoon, I waited for 30 minutes in store.\n\nFuture Shop it is.
A great \"local\" pub with friendly staff.  Most nights have live music.  The food menu isnt bad, but wish they had a few more healthy options.
The food here is actually pretty good, but the service is absolutely terrible when the owner Rajiv is not around. And forget about the delivery, the food is always cold and then they blame you if they can't find the place.  They really need to work on the service.
The new owners are wrecking this place. Just returned to Montreal for a short vacation and the staff are way overworked. Won't be going back - it's better in my memories. The food has gone down hill.
wasn't the ownership change at the time in 2004... It was the cook, and recipe change that killed it. Went there for lunch, new owners... Horrible... Zero stars
Mediocre food, but great service. Lots of comfy seating with great views of different TVs and games.
Good service... But personality wise a little snob'ishhh.\nFood is always AAA.\nGreat place to go with friends n family.
The food is pretty expensive for what it is: generic steam table Chinese food. I would recommend other Chinese food in the plaza less you're in a hurry.
Service is slow the food is ok. I ordered a small fruit bowl and it turned out to be canned fruit. Don't order that. It is just gross!
The breads, prepared foods, and cheeses are definitely worth checking out. If you're hungry, they make very good sandwiches. Vincenzo's carries a lot of specialty items, but sometimes one can find the more common items much cheaper at a regular grocery store.
This place is amazing. Soo much to choose from. Love the hot sauce section. The cheese section is unreal. And they will let you try anything. Overall a really great store
Hey Robert.   Sent you some info online after searching for your contact. No reply. Put your email up and I'll email you. \n\nThanks\n\nCraig
Ellison's is fantastic. Don't go there if you are in hurry as Elvis(Ellison) the chef is all by himself in the kitchen making everything from scratch. The best Roti in town and a neat little place for carribean of any sort.
Has a some chairs out front so you can socialize under the hot summer sun. The employees are exceptionally friendly, particularly in the early hours of the morning when I typically grab a drink. Expect it to be moderately busy due to the location.
Great place, with a small, personal atmosphere. The service is amazing, and the beer choices are great. A lot of imported beer selection on tap. Good place for great conversation.
The food is pretty good, but I don't understand why their lunch specials are so expensive. I once ordered a pad thai to take home to my husband, after I dined with a friend at lunch, and ended up like $40 in the hole. Brutal!
Chicken schwarma here is fantastic. Best in town. Don't add onions though. Pita chips and hummus are also great.
Its my favorite Thai place in Tempe.  Sometimes there is a wait, but its always worth it.  My favorite is the Siamese Basil Chicken.
Blows. Badly. Its like new jersey meets new jerseys ugly kid brother. Smh.
A nice, grand park that's perfect for meandering or enjoying a nice picnic.  Portions of it have dense trees and it's nice to feel as if you are in a forest and far away from a city.  This place is worth the visit.
Slooooow service. Food was cold when I got it. Staff is friendly enough, they just need more staff on for the Friday rush.
Great place to having a girls night out in Vegas! The only way to start/end your night is karaoke with friends/family! Great service...great location...cool staff!
Very much a Crescent street tourist hangout. About as authentic as Mario and Luigi.\n\nGreat for American tourists and Mom and Dad visiting their little princess who goes to McGill ;)
Good food, great service and \"local flavor\" - recommended...
Everything I have eaten here is delicious...a little pricey for lunch, but worth it. Its a good idea to split a pasta meal and a salad with a friend; Then you get the best of both worlds.
We always enjoy Wildflower Bread Companys food. Always fresh and delicious.  Today there is a long wait. Bit we were informed before we ordered leaving us the choice of staying or going elsewhere.  We chose to stay.
Good pizza, I also like that they use the \"level up\" app. I saved $10 on my order.
Average American restaurant, good food, but nothing special. Safe choice restaurant.   Bar area is loud, a bit difficult to talk and hear.
The service took a little extra time but the food was amazing! Get the iron skillet mac!
went here with a friend to look around and see what is it all about maybe another time when it is not so hot  right now i think this park is not so hot as the weather is
Excellent Margaritas, Food pretty good too! Lack Mexican Ambiance, like having a mexican meal at a CPK. Nice Patio, Id go back for the Margaritas for sure. Excellent Service and very nice.
Took them half hour to get me pollo loco n las Vegas rolls. The couple that arrived after me received there food first. I did not appreciate it at all !
waited one hour between dishes. poor service! asked for a cake for my husbands borthday, they completely forgot about it.
The food is pretty good. I got the greek salad with grilled chicken, which is $10.50. Its just too expensive for fast food.
There are so many interesting book~ just got three from there and they help to make my studies life more interesting~
Excellent sushi. Sophisticated yet comfortable atmosphere and great presentation. Finding this place hidden away on a third floor is a real gem.
This place is in my neighborhood and I decided to support a local business instead of going to a chain like Little Caesar's or something. The pizza was mediocre and the price was high. Perfect. The veggies on my pizza were basically raw and the sauce did not taste good.
This place really needs to work on their service. Hiring cashiers is one thing, training them to give good service makes a business so much better. I'm pretty sure this place's management doesn't really care about customers, more focused on loss prevention and keeping the store running.
Pretty decent car wash for the price.  They were happy to go back over a couple of places that they missed on my car.
Wow this place has crazy prices for a sandwich come on get real I don't understand what justifies paying so much for a soup or a sandwich and the portions are extremely small do yourself a favor and pass unless you have money to blow
good deals\n\nfriendly
-THIS LOCATION IS CLOSED due to a fire-Was disappointed to find a boarded up front entry here today, website says it is closed \"indefinitely\", but there are several other locations in Montreal.
Do not, I repeat, do NOT go to the nail salon next to Dillard's. Very horrible service, they do not listen to you, they do a horrible polish job and of course the typical Vietnamese gossip the whole time which is very annoying.
I have two free meals here and can't seem to bring myself to going. \n\nAnyone want to try it risk free? Pm me and I will arrange the details.
Ordered take out. Best potato salad I've EVER had!! The crab cakes were delish and the corn bread was a perfect accompaniment. I also enjoyed the brown rice as well as the pasta. Can't wait to get back here and try more stuff!!
The outside and the inside is clean and looks like a Caribbean cafe but the food doesn't taste like it.
Excellent service and the food ... fabulous!  I had ribs, greens, and cole slaw. Yummy!
I sent my 18 year old college student daughter here for a procedure.  The doctors and nurses were mean, and insulting.  I would not recommend this facility.  He denegrated ASU'S academic reputation and made inappropriate comments to her.
Great patio. Great wine selection. Tasty food. Enjoy downtown Matthews!!
Good rooms but be sure to get a room that does not face the school - heavy truck traffic and garbage trucks loading/unloading Bailee's all night
The club sucks... tiny dance floor and expensive drinks... get your party on for free downstairs. The music is better and there is a lot of room to sit and chill with friends  =)
I hate this place. It is way too small. You can't move a MUSCLE. They let too many people in. Just stay downstairs and order some food. Seriously.
If I was back home in Seattle, I would consider it a good club, but for Vegas one deserves better.  Cramped and dark.  When I stopped by on a Sunday night, the music was mainly techno.
Was not impressed by my dinner. How does one prepare Marinara Sauce without garlic? No recommendations coming from this dissatisfied party.
Meatballs are excellent. Love the atmosphere too. Make sure to sit inside, way better than outside trust me.
Best coffee and Danish you can buy. I always get the cheese Danish and the cappuccino. I love the little sugar stick that comes with it too. Skip the buffet an enjoy quality breakfast.
Nice coffee shop located close to the casino and guest elevators.  I stopped in the other day to get an Italian Soda as an afternoon pick me up.  The staff was friendly and the raspberry italian soda was delicious...although a little bit pricey at nearly $6.
Not bad pizza for an airport quick bite. Line was quick. Seating was not plenty, but was able to grab spot right away.
It's a Paradise. Friendly service and consistent food as per the average Paradise. Perfect for a quick bite.
I prefer wildflower, but recently had their grilled cheese and tomato soup and it was delicious!!  Will be back for that combo!
Our favorite Sushi restaurant!  Richard is awesome and the food and presentation is Awesome!  We are here about once a week!!
The only good thing I can say about this place is the waitress was very friendly.  The chips and salsa were bland. The burrito was very boring. The carnitas tacos were dry. Nothing interesting or fresh.   Definitely not going back again.
This is one Buffet that we love to go to mainly because of the Great food and fantastic service not mention the excellent ambience
i recommend dining here during Thursday - Polynesian night! \nTry the roasted pig / lechon yum yum!
Nothing but noodles has a great selection of noodle dishes. Everything from Japanese to my Italian Favorites. I enjoy their spicy Japanese Noodles with Chicken. These guys also have bread sticks that are neck and neck with the Olive Garden.
Much better than last year!  They must have a decent saucier now. The Alfredo was right on.  [Oh my!  I just realized that their sauces must now just come out of a can.  I wish they'd tell us if they are freshly made.)
Yes, it has an extensive selection of wines (and 10 cent wine tasting), but they also have the widest selection of Scotch and Bourbon I have ever seen in one place, as well as an unbelievable number of beer choices. You can even make you own six-pack of beer.
Nice salad bar. Reminds me of Souplantation. I will be back. Wish they had clam chowder and a more desserts!
They are not strict when it comes to comps! Just go play in their casino and you would surely get a free meal that's worth it, there are a lot of choices from American to Asian food.
this is the worst casino in town, do not play here they have the worst dealers and the worst pit bosses, they suk
We went there once and would never go back. There are too many good restaurants in Madison to waste your time here. My wife got the salmon and it was disgusting, I'm fairly certain it was frozen and simply reheated.
Great service!  Very comfortable atmosphere.  Food was fine.  Nothing over the top outstanding but good and it was priced appropriately.
The food at Davios is  excellent, service is wonderful.
Called us on Father's Day, an hour before our reservation, to tell us they were going out of business!  Horrible!
4 stars food\n0 stars service, it was totally abysmal this time.  what up with that?  the girl at the front was a total you know what.  anyway...its a good thing the whole food experience saved the day.
Waiter was rude and did not bring all the foods and got irritated when asked again.  The restaurant seems to be managed by a bunch of university students with limited restaurant experiences.  Gratuities of 15% included already in the bill, like they deserve it.
Authentic CLEAN Spanish cuisine, good service.
The service alone makes this place a five-star restaurant. However, the food was spectacular as well! Fresh, flavorful, hot and served with style and a friendly smile. Highly recommend this small trattoria amidst the myriad of stores and other food options, don't miss it!
Our group got food poisoning from eating here. The service was great, but we got so sick afterwards we can never come back. \n\nStay AWAY! there are many other options for eating in the Venetian
We ordered subs for our entire team and they were 5 hours late , our team had to play a game on empty stomach then after game had to wait another 2 hours before we got out subs... No Bueno
I LOVE these sandwiches! OMG they are delicious. Customer service is always good. I didn't even know they were there....otherwise I would have gone a lot sooner!
pretty amazing experience. Good seating, good acoustics, pretty much awesome all around. seats were comfortable and the security wasn't completely overbearing.
Many of the reviews of J. Alexander's have been quite descriptive so I'm going to keep mine short and to the point:\n\nI did not enjoy my experience here in the least.  Everything about this place is simply \"typical.\"
You'll read a lot about trying the \"Golden Gazpacho.\" Believe the buzz, it's delicious. Definitely worth eating at.
Good food but sometimes slow service at times..been there 6-8 times
Food has been excellent! Wings and Tuesday night Tacos are the best.
This place has closed.  The owner converted it to a Spanish tapas place.  I want Coco Osteria.. It was my favorite spot.
Nice atmosphere, good service, mediocre food at best. My advice save your money.
Food and service is good , however, beware of the owner, Gianfranco. he has a potential to go postal on unsuspecting patrons for no apparent reason. Screaming, cursing, etc. Dine at your own risk
ONLY good for drinks, food is very bland & unappeasing how can anyone go wrong with a Philly cheese steak??? will not be returning!
I thought the brunch was just okay. The french toast was overcooked and the sausage patties were dry. I was starving so I ate it all anyway. I'd give it less stars if it weren't for the great outside dining area.
Well, it's large.  \n\nI'll sum it up quickly:  I've been to a lot of Asian grocery stores, and this one gets the honor of being the only place where I've seen large cockroaches scurrying about in broad daylight.
Meat and two place. Pretty decent food. Great service. Divey.
Eh...   Good variety of wing sauces/rubs.  But it was average.  Plenty of tvs to watch football but they are very awkwardly mounted so you have to crane your neck to see more than 1 game.
Great food, atmosphere, and service! I've been here 4 times and had a good experience each time.
Stale bread, water glass unrefilled.  Stuffed mushrooms undistinguished.  Bolognese spagetti sauce with no depth.  Portions large.  No reason to go back.
Burritos got smaller, flood still flavorful, but the attitudes of the servers aren't positive and enthusiastic as they use to be. I dont think I'll be eating here again for a while.
Fresh food, great selection, For less than $10.00 a person. hard to beat.
Was in town for Labor Day and had a BLAST at this place!  Love dueling pianos. It felt like Silky O'Sullivan's on Beale (but classier).  Will frequent this place every time I'm in town!
This facility has an abundance of reading materials.  There is a very good selection of CD's.  You will also find a decent selection of movies.  The wireless connectivity is pretty good.
Mediocre fish. Super small portions.  Bland.  No atmosphere.  Good service though.
Food is pretty good but the staff are a bunch of freaking idiot's.  Not friendly at all.
This place sucks!  There are way too many good sushi spots to even bother wasting your time here
Stopped in when they were busy, ordered and waited for more than 20 minutes for 1 smoothie before giving up.\n\nEnded up asking for our money back - their excuse - \"We're not making them in any particular order\".
FAmilia pizza is wayyyy better
Unpleasant, inexperienced, and unwilling to help.... Don't take your animals here one groomer was severely hurting one of the dogs being groomed.
So many great finds! Ive scored vintage items, hand crafted jewelry, and handmade clothing, bags, shoes, you name it! Every item is a show stopper or conversation piece.
Can you make me a venti skinny soy splenda no sweetener half caff cappucino with no foam in a grande cup while I explore plebian society while visiting from Mesa? The Willo is so edgy isn't it?
Food is blah, but atmosphere is stellar. Just stick with coffee and you'll be happy!
Ok coffee. But very nice looking place. Not bad for a good relax combo with a friend or colleague
Not very good
Food was good but, not great. Location is very cool, in the town center. (think Big White columned building with southern looking square)\n\nNo lunch specials-you paid dinner prices.
We eat here almost every month, excellent veal and pasta dishes, pizza and likes the seafood salad.
I was really disappointed in the service I received for the price I paid. Paid like $40 for a car wash. (My car needed it) They gave me decent wash, but that wasn't what I paid for. Not going back.
I order for my employee's he put too much broccoli and not enough shrimp he needs yo be fair  not much happy
Had lunch here today. At best, it's alright. I wouldn't want to rush back here anytime soon though. Typical American food (check), loud atmosphere (check), average waiters (check).
Long long long wait in drive thru.  For hard freaking chicken strips.  Overpriced.  Overrated.  Food was either overcooked or under a heat lamp all day.   A waste of a good location they could put a better fast food joint.
Wow. This was a waste of time. It seemed that they wanted to teach about a couple of habitats and be a zoo but they didn't have enough funds to realize the objective. There are a few animals and some displays about habitats, but we found this to be really disappointing.
Unpredictable each visit.  Checked the county health code web site and decided to stop going.
I went around 2:30 am the other day and tried their cookies for the first time. I am still thinking about it...enough for me to write a review at 1:30 am. Try their white chocolate macadamia sooooo good, the chocolate chunk, not so much.
And empty club (determined by friend that was already there when we showed up), and empty line, and I need to buy bottle service to get in?  No thanks.  This place is awful.
Tasty. And the lunch menu makes it affordable.
had the best breakfast sandwich ever! good service, nice decor, only complaint is lack of wifi - but it doesn't matter much
Love the food here! The portion is not big but always enough for me. I always like to order their today's special :), never disappointed!
One of Montreal's last great spots to catch independent films and an excellent way to support Montreal's documentary film industry.
Very colorful, especially if you want to smoke weed surrounded by a bunch of weirdos playing African drums...other than that it is rather boring
Just discovered this place. Food was really good! Nothing out of the ordinary food wise but it was really good and cheap. The staff was super helpful and friendly. A great first experience. We will be back!
Restaurant is nice, and service ok.\nAs a meat lover I never tasted anything that horrible as their prime rib cowboy entree serving.\nChoose another restaurant !!\nPaul
Their products are good however the customer service is not. I've been in a handful of times over the years and each time the employees act like they have a stick up their asses.  I'll go spend my money somewhere else.
Had an awesome first experience. She was nice, gentle and kept up a little chit chat with me to fill in the awkward silence haha. Cheap too! For 20 I got my eyesbrows and lip done. :)
don't waste your time! this place is no longer open.
Excellent wax.  Always great service.  Thanks
There the meat counter is the best of all to me. Also have variety of collection very competitive and active. Most of the time I went for taking their meat section -being fresh I love it.
Everything we had was very well done. Very good fresh pasta. And the salads are excellent. Very friendly staff and great service. It is a very small restaurant (super cozy!) so be prepared for that.  Also no liquor for sale but it is bring your own wine!
Positively the snobbiest Starbucks I've ever been to. Get over yourselves and crack a smile, for goodness sake!
Like most of this franchise the service sucks (slooooooowwwww) and the food is no better than mediocre.  Add to this a lack of talent and you basically have Bennigans.
Food was decent, drink was yummy....service could've been a little better, but for a sports bar, it is overall okay.
Prices are a bit steep (~$3 each for a small cup of hot chocolate and a small cup of cappuccino), but they're strong in taste.\n\nA good stop to make after visiting the basilica!
Great service, atmosphere, and food! Loved the gluten free options! Awesome experience!
Very soggy pizza, my sub same very soggy. They need to cook their bread products more. Boneless wings taste like the came from a TV dinner and out of a microwave. Service was slow, drinks were empty before an offer for refill.\n\nNot coming back.
I love all of the cupcakes!  They are so pretty and ridiculously delicious!  I am so happy they are so close to my house.  If you have not tried this place you definitely should!  You will not be disappointed.
I have been a few times with my wife and by myself. I love it. It seems clean and the help is sincere and accommodating. The chicken is good and spicy!
Great place. Tons of meat. If you're in to Grilled meat this is the place for you. A bit on the pricey side especially with all the buffets in Vegas.  Good service and atmosphere. A great place for a group dinner.
Wonderful steaks with salad bar thats fresh ;) theres so much to choose from.
I love this place but be careful you WILL overeat! Also, making reservations is better than not! And eat the meat and not the salad bar or you won't get your money's worth!
Salad bar is awesome with everything you could possibly want.  The top sirloin was my favorite but everything was wonderful.  The chocolate moose cake was to die for!!!  Good service and atmosphere... Maybe just a tad on the pricy side.
For french food, it was a regular food.. not bad and nothing out of the ordinary.
I give this location no stars cuz they are horrible at there job took them 15 min to make a latte and my girlfriends iced coffee taste horrible!
This starbucks is awful. They don't listen when you're ordering don't apologize for having to repeat yourself 5 time. Their rude and unworthy of my business.
This is NOT the best galatto in the valley. Although the view of the fountain is nice, it was way over priced for the lack of flavor. It wasn't bad, but is there such a thing as bad galatto?
I used to LOVE this place but it has quickly gone downhill as it gained popularity.  Long waits and the quality of foods is sub-McDonalds-quality.  Barf.
Just got some ink from Eric Ayala. Vintage cowgirl. It's great. Nice guy and a great artist. Will be back for more.
Wow this place has changed. Tonopah Rob might want to take a bite of some humble pie and worry about what his own farm is doing. I am done with the smugness that has over taken this place.
Just has an appointment with Luis.  Great job!!! Did an awesome color (works wonders with blondes, most people make me too brassy) and cut and threw in a great style. Definitely going back to him!
Best place to work, great atmosphere and co-workers! The Rockstars of Old Town! Ask for Albert and mention Yelp for a 20% discount. Existing client or not!
This place is horrible.  The food is raunchy,  it comes out cold and the Restaurant was so cold inside I wore a winter jacket in the summer.  Avoid this place unless you are almost starving.
I had the fish tacos, hubby had a bacon cheeseburger, and the kids had corn dogs. The fish tacos were very tasty!
Enjoyed the lychee tea. Love that each teapot is unique and their cookies were delicious.
I called a week later to see if they could update my gel nails & they were rude on the phone and were going to charge me way more than any other place.  I won't be going back there again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Great job! The guy took his time and did exactly what I wanted. I got a fill and gel polish change on my toes: )
Happy Hour staple...house wine 1/2 price on Tuesdays.  Ordered pizza to go...chicken BBQ...I loved it!  Thin crust, flavorful toppings...Bartenders are fantastic! Cozy bar.
Love the chicken teriyaki here . Cute little booth set ups and love the bar set up . Husband love the beer and sushi .
OUT OF BUSINESS Iguess you guys were right
Service at Audi Henderson is awesome. I have never felt so comfortable with anyone. Brett is an awesome guy and he is so helpful. I seriously would keep my Audi because of this guy and will continue to buy Audi just so I can take my car to him. LoL. Awesome guy.
I loved this place. They let me hold a chicken!!! There were soooo many animals!!! I was in heaven.  The fudge was amazing.  The people were super nice.  Can't wait to take my grandnieces next Thursday.
Went here before a movie, some food was warm some was cool.  but we made the movie in time!!
Good beer and decent food...
The place is clean, and well run, and the food is pretty good.  We happened to eat here during a happy hour special and everything we ordered (appetizers and entrees) were all half price.\n\nA nice variety of food at a resonible price.
Love this place, but so sad with their limited and confusing hours of operation?  The website and voice message give conflicting hours/days of operation?  Ultimately, the kitchen closes by 6 pm--super tough to make dinner plans!
was here with the hubby.  Great service!
Overpriced, even on things you can get the same of at walmart or food4less. They try to upsell you at the ice, people think its free when they ask if you would like ice, but its not. Ill start shopping here again when I am rich.
Took clients there for lunch, had a good lunch and left a nice tip. I left something very important and called. I spoke to the manager and she promised to mail it to my home address. I never received the item. Very dissappointed.
Just like my home Hot Dogs in Hermosillo by the University.\nThey are rich and gigantic, so show up hungry!
Cuban sandwich is soooo AWESOME.  Fresh pork loin and great ham comlimented by the spicy kosher pickles and pressed neatly but stuffed between two halves of a fresh roll!  I would do this one again for sure!!!
Ordered a hot sandwich......and 28 minutes later and after asking 3x's I finally got it.  Way to long to have to wait for lunch.
I eat here twice a month the food is always good.  I usually sit at the bar and the bartender always takes great care of me I think his name is ben very good.  Reliable and considtant
O.k BBQ ...we had sausage and BBQ sandwich as well as a burger they were all pretty good my favorite part of the meal was the bbq nacho for a appetizer ...
This is an above average sports bar chain with fantastic chicken wings. I like stopping here for lunch occasionally, I don't know if I'd ever bother late night.
My only complaint is they are pricey compared to other quality sushi restaurants ie sakana on Hayden and Indian school but the food was good service was good and the ambience is comfortable
Great simple, affordable, and authentic. 'nuff said. \n\nThe entrance is misleading, there is more seating in the back.
All the offices are packed with people and is never easy to get an apointment right away. The front desk people are rude and lack of compassion and understanding and they just want to have a reason to reschedule patients. I never go back to this practice again.
Simply delicious! Its a small place with big flavors! If your craving a satisfying asian noodle soup than this is one of the best places in montreal for it!! Service is also quick !
Called to place a catering order and they rudely asked me to call back in 20 minutes b/c they were busy. WTF? How about I'll call one of the other 20 Qdoba's in town to give my money to.
This is a weekly place for  us. Same two servers (mother and daughter). This is more of a hang out. Don't go for a Parisian experience dressed in your Sunday best, it's more of a mom and pop shop to hang out and enjoy some quiet time.
Some of the poorest customer service I have ever experienced, but the crepes and drinks were very good :)
Good crepes, fast and friendly service. We tried a crepe from the sweet and from the savory side: chicken supreme crepe and nutella crepe. A great place to get your crepe fix regardless of what you're in the mood for.
2 words: Awe. Some. \n\nGreat fish & Chips, great Po' Boys, so far have loved everything I have tried.
Very clean and not crowded on weekends. They do price match only with Fry's, Safeway, Albertson and Basha.
We definitely had fun and enjoyed the fan. We will be back!
we decide to have our christmas party here for the enterteiment. i was so desagree the food the plates were expensive and not very good.  also they did let us play on the table pools because the have some kind of activity with few people over.
Banh Pho and Bun are both awesome. Love this place.
All of the dishes were fantastic, when the new owner took over. Now the dishes have been of such poor quality that I would rather eat \"Asian\" frozen food.
The beans are bland as cardboard. The onions were uncooked and the salsa was not pica. I recommend taco bell over this place. However the cochata was delicious. Maybe they should rethink their mission and vision.
My rating is solely based on the service. I ordered food to eat-in but it took close to an hour to be prepared, so I changed it to take-out. Haven't tried the food yet.
Excellent service, great margaritas and fantastic food! The most authentic Mexican in Charlotte. The pork and pineapple tacos are a must have. My new favorite Mexican restaurant in Charlotte.
Food is great! Service sucks!
It's now \"$3.49 Cleaners\".  They do a decent job but I finally realized they're the ones stapling the return ticket to the garment itself.  And I don't like little holes appearing on the fronts of my dress shirts.
The food is really, really good but the service is horrifically slow.  If you are golfing or live in the community it is well worth the wait if you have a few days to spare.
Overrated brunch. I shared 2 dishes: the scotch eggs and the full monty, which is a combination of all the options for breakfast. It wasn't really tasty or that memorable.
Just a solid neighborhood pub. Good atmosphere. Good English tap list. Didn't eat anything. Impressive selection of scotch. Was full 2pm on mon.
I'd heard a few recommendations to try the pizza here. I was thoroughly disappointed. The only reason I give it 2 stars instead of 1 is that they offer some options you don't find at every pizza place. With that said, I didn't really like the pizza.
I have been to all the Ah-So Sushi locations and this is by far the best one! Go to Mr. Kim and ask for a Mr. Kim #4. Best susji I've ever had!!!
A nice variety of asian plates are offered in this place. Not the best ones I have tried in all categories but if you want variety this is a good place.
Always friendly, Call ahead and they've got it waiting.  I wish they could just know by my # what I always order.
Delicious food - eloquent, classy atmosphere and impeccable service. It's pricey but I don't mind paying for good food. There are also happy hour specials if you sit at the bar before 7.
Worst customer service, the guy really asked me for my receipt to check my bag because he assumed I was stealing and he felt like an idiot when he didn't find anything
The food is absolutely amazing. Had a cubana sandwich and fries with a coke was one of the best lunches i have ever had!!! The waitresses were very nice too!
Good Thai dishes. Make sure you understand the Spicy levels.
Solid 3 star red curry tofu.\n\nNot 5 star, not 4 star...but hey!  They did great with the one classic dish I ordered...
heeelllooooo chocolate chili milkshake!\n\ndulishus.
Food is never hot and the service is atrocious!
I like the #5..
Service was terrible, but food was delivered promptly. It seems as if this business don't value their customers. Food was alright- nothing special. Will not come back because of lack of friendliness.
Ordered a meal for pickup, went 15 minutes later and after they rang me up realized they never made it.
When I am looking for fast, cheap, good Hawaiian eats in Vegas, I stop here.  Love the marination that they use on their meats.  Great malasadas too!
This spot is legit. Great clothing, friendly and knowledgable staff and convenient location.
My husband & I both got Great work by Andrew Black! Can't wait to get more -such an amazing artist ~ thanks Andrew
Good food decent service but not amazing like Texas roadhouse.  The ribs are probably the best thing I have ever had here and they do give you amazing rolls before the meal.  I would recommend giving this place a try.
Look fo coupons! Great bread. Good food.
Really like Club 36; I'll be staying here for every Vegas trip unless I get comp'd a free stay somewhere else. The accomodations were really comfortable and the staff was extremely hospitable.
Don't believe bad reviews. This place is top notch and beats spending $150 per night on the strip. Get a free 2 night stay on the weekend by buying a package from Ontario mills. 149 and you get all your money back at the resort!
Alright at best staff wasn't very helpful and food took along time for no one to be there...
Small Indian takeout spot in Latta Arcade with pretty good food, although my veggie entree was a bit watery.  The naan was fresh which is always important.  I'll probably go back and try something different just to make sure they're legit.
I would give this place an eek methinks not except for the fact that they have such great stuff, but a no return policy...none at all, prevents me from ever going again.
Great \"Everyman\" pub. Just beer and basic drinks, but that's ok. Sociable atmosphere. Appeared to be mostly locals, but I felt right at home. 30-something crowd give or take.
My previous  review highlighted a lack of offers, this has now been challenged with this bold printout slapped on their notice board (see picture). \n\nStill there's a lack of offers regarding drinks...
Solid burgers here. Perhaps not a pinnacle of medium rare glory, but the taste is right and portions are filling. I'd opt for the sweet chili sauce as an extra topping; it combines with the default sauce in weird and interesting ways!
This is a decent-size neighborhood pub with a good, comfortable atmosphere.  The staff when friends and I visited was friendly in general, but extremely inattentive when it came to service.
Went in for a pre-theatre dinner and had the haggis, which was excellent. Staff were friendly and I'd certainly recommend CC Blooms for the food.
Just popped in here as some of our friends who joined us after work hadn't eaten so for them pizza, for us a glass of wine and beer.
Rooms small (apart from one or two fantastic suites). All a bit tired now.\nFull of american coach parties.\nOh.. and they play \"highland music\" over breakfast.  I think that says everything that needs to be said.
Tasty diner, with plenty of comfort food. The taps were dry when we visited but they have a small selection of bottled drinks to choose from. The bangers and mash and shepherds pie were decent. A great hangover meal restaurant.
Fab music and great drinks selection. Some people so cool it looked like it hurt but overall friendly and lively. Pain that the loos are all the way downstairs and not the best for 5 inch heels!!
I've been here for a couple of nights out and the cocktails are good and the music is cool! A bit crowded and full of a lot of posers taking selfies but if you can handle that then its a good place to start your night!
Kitchin is an outstanding high end restaurant in Leith with well prepared regional dishes such as grouse, and local ingredients and cheeses, and an excellent wine list.
Amazing food and the hospitality cannot be beat. Traveling alone can be tough and the staff here made me feel at home. Plus the owner was there also greeting diners. Love it- try the pizza!
Friendly staff, and great upstairs. Good views of the high street. They still don't get iced lattes quite right, but that's seemingly true for most Starbucks outside the states.
Flawless really. Great service, excellent food, classic setting. Looking forward to next time (and hoping there is one).
Great pub with friendly atmosphere and an excellent selection of food and drink. Great for a catch up with friends.
Food is quite nice and not overpriced. Recommend Haggis and seafood! The lunch set is great value
The Hampton is the nearest thing to a pub in this area of town. Nice bar area and very friendly staff. Had food once here, but as a veggie there wasn't a huge amount to choose from on the menu.   Has a good reputation for food with local folk though.
Salsa verde, cilantro, pork crackling. You can't ask for anything better. Surprisingly dioecious authentic Mexican food. Excellent drink and food selection. Having grown up on Mexican food, this is certainly up to standard. Good ambiance, too.
Went here for my birthday dinner. Food was beautiful, staff were friendly and more than accommodating. A very enjoyable dinner.
The Piemaker boasts that it's sausage rolls maintain the old miners tradition of rolling the peppery sausage meat in two layers of pastry. \nDouble pastry?!?!?!\nToo perfect.
V good service with funny and friendly staff.
Very friendly bar staff who were even willing to show the US Open golf in between World Cup games. Would return for sure!
Lovely evening out...\nA good little Spanish place...\nIs a nice, fresh meal
middling italian fare on the grassmarket. you could do much worse in the UK  (think bella italia) but you could also do better. it's a fine place to enjoy a slightly better than average italian meal on a sunny day.
Great food. Nachos are plain but the haggis is great.
Good for watching the football in & getting a bit of a flavour of the down to earth side of the West End. Clean & cheerful with pleasant service although not without pretension as Stella's \u00a33.95 a pint.
Good price and great location only a few minutes walk from the shops and the theatre. However, the room was terribly cold because the windows aren't double glazed. Saved money by staying there but ended up very cold at night.
Medieval walls stores all the prayers, thoughts and hopes whispered over the centuries. Generations passed away and now we have short moment to calmly leave our thoughts and hopes in this timeless place. Stop and appreciate this great privilege which you have.
Walked around for a while and found Jason's deli.  Place was clean and I tried their reuben sandwich today.  I give the Reuben 4 stars for taste.
Wow, harsh reviews!\n\nI found the guy behind the counter helpful.  He steered me in the right direction and I got a meal I really enjoyed.   BBQ'd tilapia and Chicken Adobo were very tasty.
This the single most unique dining experience I've ever had the pleasure to indulge. Absolutely divine.
I ordered 2 times from that place and got lazy service, late delivery and cold pizza and I do not recommend that place
Had a not-so-great experience at US Egg. My veggie frittata was really soggy, like a veggie frittata soup. The frozen vegetables must have thawed in the dish.
The burgers are good, but was really makes this place worth it are the shakes! You can get your standard shake with a variety of delicious flavors, or you can spice it up with alcoholic versions. Simply awesome.
They never disappoint. Solid place to go, never had a bad experience.
The shop closed down in February 2014.\n\nI used it once last summer because I live nearby and needed a link extractor. Even then the stock in the shop seemed very low with a lot of empty shelves and racks.
This boutique is way better than the Chanel @ The Wynn Hotel. So much selection and its huge! I ended up purchasing my black Chanel from here. I love their merchandise and now im eying on their bracelets.
Just stopped in for a quick drink at the front bar. Don't know why I'm even writing a review. It was cool, no complaints.
Insanity!\n\nIt is a beautiful place to be, but drinks are nothing but suga and wata.\n\nI did not get drunk, insanity.
This was a great experience.  A bit pricey but worth it.
out of all the metro park stores ive been including the ones in vegas this was probably the worse one ive been too. the workers looked miserable to be there and yeah thats all
very solid. great cocktails, especially if you like tequila (i do). tasty nuevo latino treats. duck empenadas (if i remember right) were ridiculously good. casual but upscale, with attentive bar service. fun.
What the truck, chuck? \n\nel servicio - no bueno\nla comida - no me gusta\nla decoracion - una estrella\nla margarita - una estrella
Sooo good! Cool place. Guacamole is expensive and not the best. They do make it in front of you which is neat.
Great atmosphere. Excellent Pork dishes.  Empanadas were really greasy, but otherwise everything was perfect.
Brunch was amazing. Mexican with a French style of cooking. I had the chicken and waffles. Nothing like Roscoe's, but still amazing in a different way.
I always take friends here from out of town.  Love this place!
It's been awhile since I last wrote a review for the mission but my love still remains. My two favorite things about the mission are their fresh guacamole and the patio atmosphere. The entire restaurant has this charming old world feel to it and the food and drinks flow with it.
Amazing! Short rib tacos were some of the best I've had. Lunch wasn't as busy as I thought it would be. Service was excellent.
The kale salad with chicken was disappointing. It's a pile of shaved kale without much else. The chicken is tasty, but there isn't much on there. All things considered, I think the food is overpriced. I wouldn't recommend it to a friend.
Never really read books but went to get magazine before.
Just go walk down it. You'll see.
your spa and salon looking stops here! I was very impressed with the wonderful massage that Janelle performed and how professional Anne, nail tech was! this was by far the best experience i have ever had at a spa! i will be definitely returning! highly recommend!
Like this place - friendly staff, huge selection of veg for all you foody needs and really well laid out, so even when its busy you can still get around. The only down side is it can be a little more expensive than some of the other shops around argyle place etc.
Great dinner and great tequila. Chips and salsa were great. \nOur server Angel brought us a complimentary flight of tequila. We had ordered two. Everyone enjoyed their meal. The only bad thing is it is in the Luxor. What a dump.
Service could not have been worse. Totally rude waitress, ridiculously long wait for food and our bill. \n\nThe food was not bad though, and the location inside the hotel and atmosphere were cool, so a few stars for that!
Good to stop in for a snack...don't go out of your way.  $5 bar snacks are good, guacamole is good and nachos.  Stay away from frozen margaritas pre-made from machine.
Food presentation was great and the chips and salsa was really yummy. Actual meal was okay. I had the El Pastor tacos and husband had enchiladas. Not bad not great. Our waiter was just okay too. Won't go back
So awful. Handed in ghds to have the fuse replaced and within 2 weeks they are broken again. Also had my iPhone screen replaced, when I left the shop it was completely broken, no touch screen at all. \u00a3145 wasted. Would never ever recommend
Anna pretty much took the words out of my mouth on this one. I'm going to add one more thing. They have a extremely unique way of arrange flowers, very modern and bespoke looking. I can't (and won't) describe it any further, visit to see!
There are so many good reviews here that I almost feel I was in a different eatery. Perhaps I need to give it another chance, yet, I found it average in every respect so I doubt I will return.
Good beer. Pretty good pizza. The only big knock on them was our service. Our waitress was new or didn't care. Either way, I'll go back when I'm up that way again.
Not a big fan of this place to be honest. Last time i enetered the store the staff were uninterested and not friendly. I find the pricing ridiculous too considering the quality/quantity of some of the products!
the good here is decent, a-ok in my book. however, the ambience is a hell of a lot nicer in the bathroom than in the actual restaurant. minus one star for that one.
Finlay's make the best black pudding ever. Their range of sausages is truly staggering. Joe Finlay has be on the shortlist for local food hero and it's absolutely deserved. They do Xmas orders.
The best mussels ever, and great pastas and pizzas. my husbands favourite is the steak in Diablo sauce.   friendly staff and great atmosphere nice selection of wines  this is  my favourite italian restaurant
A great store for rugger tragics and Antipodean lost souls like me...if only they poured a pint as well I'd never leave!
Ok mod con shops, the place could do with some pazaaz, a better food court and an injection of love.
This now a Waitrose
Bar - expensive\n\nStaff - judging\n\nLocation - alright\n\nDecor - good\n\nwine -warm\n\nToilets - BAD BAD BAD
Not that great of food. Limited wine selection. Not a kid friendly place yet I have kids around me. Would not visit again.
I am really disappointed overall-overpriced for portion of chips which looked like soggy potatoes (not very clean either-they should change the fryers more often). I have been ask to pay extra for mayo?! Really????
While visiting Edinburgh, a friend took us to the Mosque Kitchen on our last day in town. As a vegetarian, I thought they had a solid selection for a decent price. The food was tasty and the service was on point.
It's an ok place.
Great hole in the wall chicken wing joint. Large variety of flavors - will need many more visits before I've tried a majority of them. An OK beer selection, and flat screens abound for watching sports.
I keep coming back because their food is great and they are possibly the nicest restaurant owners I have ever met.\n\nI wish it were closer to our house, but its worth the drive.
Yum. After doing some shopping at the Mekong plaza we decided on having lunch here. Very clean, which is a big plus for a Vietnamese establishment. The food was great, very tasty. Would love to back.
Best Chicken Pho in town! No joke! Oh and their steak and rice dish is to absolutely die for. The seasoning is perfection. (Drool!) I need to try their Vietnamese Iced Coffee if they have it. Then my heart will be sold forever. Love this place!
City Noth=Westgate=Kierland Commons=Tempe Marketplace=Boring, Depressing, Place Unworthy of Affection
Happy hour from 11pm - 3am for $11.99 is LEGIT!!! The selection they put out during this time is limited, but is still satisfying if you want a good, cheap Korean BBQ fix
Love this place. Good happy hour specials. Food is consistently great!
Almost five stars! The sushi special not good!! It's not fresh and very simple taste... Everything else delish :)
The best farmers market I've been to in the phoenix area. Locally produced olive oil, cheese, eggs, grass fed beef and all kinds of veggies have made it a staple of my Saturdays. Show up at 11 for the cooking demo, you'll thank me!
Portions are large, ribs are tender, sauces are flavorful and prices are fair.  I'm not sure what else you can ask for in a BBQ joint.
Good food.  Bad service.
I Had the \"Big Slab\" take out, IT SUCKED!!! This place has gone downhill fast! Ribs looked like dried jerky on a bone.. I'm not going back!!!!!!
I will spare you the details and just say that I have had three bad experiences in a row at Outback Steakhouse. (three different locations too) I give up!
I used to eat here regularly, but a poor customer service experience left me with a bad taste in my mouth. So congratulations Napoli, a long time, regular customer is gone.
Great price with generous portions.
Ate here yesterday. Didn't enjoy much about the dinner except that the chicken in the chicken and waffles was well cooked. Avoid this one.
Not very impressive ... tables and floor dirty .. I spilled accidentally and staff watched as I cleaned up with no offer of help.   Left sticky residue and nobody would wipe down properly
The location of this place is pretty unfortunate (in the ghost town that is City North).  And I might be spoiled by other yogurt shops, but the variety seemed to be lacking.  The saving grace would have to be the 1/2 price Tuesday Twitter word of the day!
LOVE THIS PLACE!  I have not had a single thing that I did not enjoy and the portions are big enough for sharing.  Leftovers are great the next day.
One of the best bolba in town. I hope they dont close, lee lees seems to be in a bad situation right now but i hope if they close this place gets a new venue.
I always get friendly customer service here. And they have a lot of real fruit drinks here. I think they are one of the best places for boba drinks.
We waited two hours for our dinner.  They did not care! And even when we got our food it wasn't made to our taste. The waiters were running around like they didn't know what they were doing. I would never go there... Unless you want to starve.
We have stopped here for lunch many times and always had a good experience.  The service is good and so is the food.  I do find the price a little bit high for what you get.
Good place for lunchtime burritos. good service and nice atmosphere.
Barista can't/won't reheat cold coffee. I was told to pay for a refill if I wanted to finish my drink. No, thanks.
This is one of the best coffee spots ever!  The people are incredible and the food rocks!  I am there at least once a week. It is an fabulous place to meet with your friends.
Found out this place is closing and I am not very surprised.  It seemed to lack a good atmosphere and the coffee was not that impressive.  Best of luck to the owners, check out Crossroads Books and Coffee to support a local shop in the burbs instead.
So good and the staff is awesome! I like the pizza and salad.
Everything about our dining experience was absolutely superb!  Outstanding service and some of the most delicious steak ever.  The salad bar is incredible too!  I highly recommend it.
This isn't great food, it's simply a place you hit up when you are trashed and need to fill your belly with grub so you can sober up.
Service was good by Michelle but was told we could not order ribs in the cafe, what's so said they cooked it 4ft from our table for Benny's Smokin ?? Plus they have in the same menu as in cafe makes no since
Love it!!! Looks real divey from the outside and way small. Inside, total tiki tradition! Salty but sweet bartendress, cheap drinks guaranteed to get you wasted. Get a drink in a mug, they're worth it!!
cool setting for Vegas locals that want a hideaway!!!  Watch out for the Zombies...2 is the limit!
Bartender was a heinous miserable female but the drinks were bomb!  I would go back just for the gnarly drinks but the service was totally Yucca yucca!
Popular place on a Saturday night!  We were able to get a seat at the bar and that worked out perfect!  The bartenders were very friendly and the food was really good.  The turkey burger was great...no complaints and the fries were tasty too!
Besides the great drinks, Saffron JAK pizza is now being served at Sidebar. The super greeky pizza is AMAZING!
Atmosphere pretty good.  Had the fish and chips, good portion and fresh cod. Had an early lunch so I can't comment about the atmosphere during busy time. Give this place a try, great location in downtown Chandler.
Killer pizza!  If you are from the East Coast than it should be mandatory for you to eat here once a week!\n\nOutstanding garlic knots!
The mojito was good but it took a long time to get service.
Our service here was so slow, we thought we'd never eat. There was also confusion on the waiter's part about our orders. At least we sat somewhere away from the crowds.
I just love the Mongolian beef, I order it every time I get take out.
Great haircuts (w/ neck shave), Miller High Life on tap, and cheap. What more could you want?
Timmy is so skilled! I always know I will leave his chair looking my best.
as long as you're open minded and not easily offended, definitely worth a stop.\n\nthere's a lot of educational and historical aspects that were interesting.\n\nhighly recommended that you go in with an open mind and a lot of time.
This location is not a nice as the Saint Denis location, but the food is pretty much the same. Chocolate Chocolate and more Chocolate, if you go you must try the chocolate port, port and chocolate go so well together.
Called around and no one could beat this places offer. Quick service and phone looks like brand new. Will go again if I have too (hope I don't have to). They have my business going forward with my products. Thanks and keep it up.
Got my phone repaired here and was stoked with the price. About a month later (after the warranty expired) I dropped my phone on my bed and the screen shattered. Tape sticking out all over. Just didn't look as professional as I thought.
If you're in the area you've got to check this place out. We had both breakfast & lunch here this weekend & were incredibly impressed with their food. Plus they deliver. :-)
The place was charming, and we enjoyed the food, particularly the brats and sweet potato fries, but to call it a serious restaurant is a bit much, since the fare is mostly pub food.  Our main objection is that the music is too loud and the sound system is terrible.
We ended up only staying about 30 minutes or so.  It's pretty crowded on Saturday nights.  They have a pretty nice patio.  Seems like a fun place to hang out with a group of friends.
The wings were okay. The server was okay. The TVs were okay. The tea was okay. \n\nIt's okay.
Overpriced and out of almost everything I ordered. Why didn't I just leave? Oh that is right, I was too lazy to leave Fremont. Face. Palm.
I came here to get the new Preztel Bun Cheeseburger. It was decent, although I probably won't be back for another.
Premium price for a standard sandwich.\n\nWould have been an enjoyable visit had the deli guy been at least welcoming.
Do I really need to review a Starbucks - I think everyone knows what they are getting when they go in.  The baristas are super awesome at this location and are quick with the drinks.  Seating space is lacking, but that is OK.
The best quick teriyaki bowls that I've had in the area. I always order ahead so I don't have t
At $10 per adult, you can't really go wrong here. We spent probably a little over 2 hrs at the museum and felt it was well worth the price of admission. I enjoy American History, and this was no exception.
One of the best places for Breakfast!  My wife and I went here at least once a week!  Offers health options too!
I had the smoked salmon on a egg white omelet.  Staff nice, ambiance fantastic, easy parking, prices comparable to downtown Scottsdale.  My drink was kinda week, but I would return for sure.
Nice little place with a wide variety of food on the menu. Sitting on the patio was awesome. The sliders were amazing and I would defiantly come back again.
First time...food was great...can't wait to go to a moes that's not at the airport!
Want a late night snack at 3am?  Feel like breakfast after you get up at 1pm?  This is your place.  Always dependable.  Never had an issue with the food here.
I had the best burger in this place, it's awesome, the waiters there are so friendly, elegant atmosphere, great place and reasonable prices
Every time I've been here I've had excellent service.\n\nMy selection: Chicken and Waffles and a Sangria.
They just shoved us on to a tiny table in the corner.  Half the restaurant is open but they refuse to move us.  We are too tired to leave so we deal with it.
This place is now closed. Apparently they lost their liquor license and those of us who purchased a Yelp Deal for that place are stuck with a certificate we cannot use. Shame, because I heard so many great things about the food. RIP Antars.
I actually end up spending more time here than I do at my actual apartment. I travel to Charlotte almost weekly for work, and the staff at this hotel is amazing. They are very personable, and extremely accommodating. This is nice to have, since I am rarely home.
Food is made fresh... its good, quick and easy!  Only drawback is that you are essentially eating on the casino floor  ...but got to watch a hockey game while I ate.
Very minimal selection. Small seating area. Not many bikes either - mainly Felt. If you want coffee go to a real coffeehouse. If you want bikes go to a bike house.
Food was great, except for the desert.  We shared the tres leches and didn't care for it.  Bacon wrapped filet and chicken were great, sausage is awesome as well.
We had so much fun!   We tried everything and everything was so yummy!  Just when I had enough, we found we had missed two different meats and we had to have a try.  As full as a was they were tasty too!
Great food, fun atmosphere, and the service is excellent! Great for a special occasion, just don't forget to come hungry.
My boyfriend and I love this place! Great mojitos and be ready to eat! Great lighting. Lots of room.
This is one of those places that you must try at least one time. It is a fun experience and the meat its regularly pretty good.\nDo not come on a holiday, they do not maintain the same level of service and food quality
Sushi was delicious, had a great time singing karaoke, Wayne and his wife are a true treat amongst the typical Vegas service industry.
This place had horrible service. Waited over a hour for my food and it came out cold. Never even got my check to leave....if there was a negative star option this place would have it.
Well worth the drive.  This off the strip hotel is truly for locals but always welcomes out of towners.  Give this buffet a try, you wont be disappointed. Excellent service and a variety of food - good to satisfy anyones palate.
The highlight of our dinner was the beef ribs, prime rib and gelato. service was good but I couldnt reccomend this to family or friends visiting unless its comp.
Don't waste your time or money..... Small buffet with few options, low quality food, and poor service..   Go to the Suncoast or McDonalds down the street
I would say with out a doubt this is the worst Mexican food I have ever had my family went there and the food was cold and hard
Reviewers:\nIf you go to a chain restaurant in an airport and expect it to be exactly like the rest of the chain you've already lost the game.
Not so good! I had the aligator and crawfish combo. Both were way over cooked and very tough. The breading was too heavy and didn't have any flavor.
This place was surprisingly authentic tasting for being in Arizona.. The food came out quick and the service was good so I will definitely be recommending this place to anyone I know.
Bad service, don't go here! They don't treat their customers equally, they choose who to give good service to.
The bar food is good for what it is, bar food. I love the afternoon and late night specials.  Unfortunately the service if often suspect, that's been consensus at the various location around the city that I've frequented.
My rating on this particular location will never change. But I will say this, corporate sent me a wonderful letter and gift card in the mail because of my yucky experience and that made me appreciate the company as a whole. But you Vegas girls need to get with it!
In the past I really enjoyed Great Steak, even though it's not a legit cheesesteak they usually tide me over. However, this particular location was terrible, one of the worst sandwiches I've ever had. Won't be back. EVER.
Who the heck even wants to climb this disgusting-looking mountain? It puts the beautiful Arizona nature and scenery to shame.
VERY DISAPPOINTING. Waited for 15-20 minutes for a table despite empty tables everywhere. Order was taken and 40 minutes later they brought out our food and BOTH orders were WRONG. Sad.
Great breakfast spot.  I prefer the other location on Ironwood, as the acoustics kinda suck here and it gets noisy.  But same good grub.  Portions are generous, prices reasonable, service friendly.
Love this place! The gyros are delicious along with the honey fried bread AND chicken Caesar pita! Definitely happy to have this in my neighborhood!
Stopped if for supplies and found everything I was looking for so I vote yes to going back.
I walked into this walmart and busted up laughing 2 minutes after I entered.  Ghetto fabulous all around.  \n\nYea for covered parking, boo for not having the best food selection.
Love this place! Lettuce wraps amazing! Egg rolls so good! Love the passion tea! Good service good food good times. This location is not as busy as some of the others so it's a great place on a Friday night!
I hate that I have to come here for my packages now. This is the slowest post office aside from downtown.
do not deal with the salesman orlando. the other sales reps warned me about him. he is a liar and his sales commission goes towards his wifes drug addiction. we regret our decision to deal with that piece of shit
For it being a complete ghost town with no customers there the wait was absolutely horrendous, the one star is for the car wash
Me and my wife enjoyed it very much!We got the Groupon and it was worth it.Very good food and nice atmosphere .We will be back for sure.
I come here for my redbull fix.  They now sell 19oz redbulls.  It helps me get through the rest of the day.  Love it.  Can't wait until they start making the 40oz redubll.
It's nice to have this place close to Wynn, Palazzo and Venetian to load up on those essentials like snacks, water and sunscreen!\n\nAnother plus - it's clean and new.
I am there at least twice a year and I go there everytime and the staff are really friendly thats what we need these!! KEEP IT UP!!!!!
This Walgreen's has it all! ! Everything you could possibly need from souvenirs to spirits. Great customer service with plenty of cashiers for check out.
Only thing missing is a pool. Also the track iirc is 1/8th miles, so it takes a LOT of laps to get any real jogging in. Other than that this place is great.
Great Omlette and friendly servers.
I'm glad I had a BOGO coupon! I will give this place another try if I have another coupon.  08/24/2013 Update - I have yet to return.
The club was really spacious. You didn't feel like you were confined to two areas. It was fun dancing on the water.
Hmm I was disappointed. It smelt of feet and the music wasn't great at all but maybe I went on a bad night. Blonde barmaid is super quick and efficient though, never waited more than a minute for a drink!
Classy and beautiful with pretty girls, pools, and poles \n\nI'd recommend bottle service here for convenience
This place is awesome, plus the dance floor is spacious and music is great! Local night is on Sunday, but get in line early because the line will be 1 hour or more... My suggestion is to find promoter and get on guest list, which will make your life easier!
Absolutely the WORST club I have EVER been too. Service was horrible and they must be desperate for funds because the club was way over capacity. I love going out but I will not be returning here.
Happening..crazy busy..long wait..super busy..super crowded. .worth it....\n\nCover can be steep 55 green ones..
Love, love, love, love... the quality, the reliability (delivered on Thanksgiving), the flexibility, and the convenience! Huge fan!
New place just opened tonight stopped in and it was awesome\nAs usual 7712 Sassaman lane  off Britten smith blvd grand opening. Having basil noodle. The best Thai food around
came here with my mom for my yearly smoked meat sandwich (visiting the parents, from san francisco, for the holidays). altogether, it did the job and satisfied my craving, but i've had better smoked meat.
This place is awesome! Great for vegetarians. HUGE selection! Staff was very friendly. Super fast. And if you are not a vegetarian don't trip. They got your back too! They have hot meals too. Try the shitake mushroom roll. Its amazing.
Not impressed. Food was waaaaay too salty and bland. Save your calories and dough for the other great resturants in Vegas.
3 words!!   I'll BE BACK!!!!!
Totally disappointing, especially after dinner at SW the night before. \n\nEverything was pretty average. The short rib was one of the worst I have had. \n\nService was decent, but would have liked to have enjoyed the food. ;(
Expensive, but worth every dollar! steaks melt in your mouth and seasoning is personalized!
I would definitely recommend the rib eye and the bar tenders really know to pour solid cocktails. Price wise the menu is fairly steep, service was great though.
Great location, way overpriced. Paid $22 for a chopped salad at lunch time, and I would say it was okay. You're paying for convenience and to escape the heat without leaving the pool.
I bought a discount certificate from Local Dines and made the mistake of not looking at the hours.  We went to have dinner and they do not serve dinner, but close at 3pm.\nJust wanted everyone to be aware of this.  We were disappointed but it was our mistake.
It's one of the better meals that I've had in Las Vegas, consistently. It's a great place for lunch in particular!
The food was good.  Had the filet mignon egg sliders and fries for lunch.  \n\nService was a bit rushed and not overly friendly.
The food is ok. You won't find anything you will particularly remember fondly, but it is a quick casual and relatively cheaper alternative to everything else at encore. Unlike the food, the decor is actually very interesting and cook
Delicious food. Has low calorie options which is nice. Deserts were amazing (saved all those calories on dinner). Have had breakfast here twice and dinner once. Great every time!
Service was adequate, coffee was better than average, the line was short, and the price was better than Starbucks (so was the coffee.)
This store carries most religious items available. The staff is very friendly and patient. I went to pick up the Susan Boyle CD for my mom and a Large print Bible.
Service was good. Pepper steak was terrible. How do you make fried rice so bad??
Favorite breakfast place in Montreal. Bacon was out of this world along with the hot chocolate. Service was genuine and prompt. A very special place to take the family.
One of the slower Starbucks I have ever been to lately.  Are they union employees?  They managed to screw up my order too.
Thanks for a great brunch, Donna. The veggie crepe and banana nut muffin were yum!\n\nMy husband had the works crepe and he said it was really good.
Great place for breakfast/brunch.  The Works Omelet was very good and the warm banana nut muffin with butter was awesome.  Natasha gave great recommendations and was a terrific waitress.  Send her to Disney!
Had brunch here today and my breakfast food was as good as ever. Brady was our server and he was great: always checking on us but never bothering our conversation. Good job, Brady!
Food is pretty decent. We had double \"boygers\" and pizza. Both was decent. Price is pretty OK too. Honestly though, I prefer Dominos pizza and In n out's hamburgers.
We went for Restaurant week and it was amazing! Gigantic portions great food and the server was so friendly and warm! We would not normally go to the epicenter but for this place we will be back!
As with any other RadioShack, I can never find what I'm looking for. This place's employees don't even know anything about electronics. Surprises they're still open.
Absolutely fantastic !!!!! From the environment, the staff and the food, the gnocchi melt on your mouth. As you can see by my plate, I could have ate another dinner.
Perfect.  The best $200 I have ever spent on an aromatherapy massage. Done by a world class therapist named, Jodi!  The decor is like being in a plush, extravagant dream.  I love you, Encore spa.
Really wanted this to be good.....very dissatisfied.  Fish was dry, food was, in general not to the caliber I would have wanted from what they are representing.  Service was fair.  Good idea but for us, a miss.
It was fun, but every plate was very very bland.  I was visiting for a week and decided to try this place based on the reviews.  Absolutely not worth the price.  The Foie Gras was the only thing worth anything in the place.
Sarah A and I came here during restaurant week and enjoyed a fantastic meal.  We both got different dishes for each course which was nice because we could sample each others.  I even got a succulent salad which was crunchy and refreshing.  I'll be back with Alex C.
Worst place on the west side.  Bartenders don't know how to keep track of anything.  Charged me the same amount twice on separate debit cards.  Won't be returning
The food was okay but not great; price is just like any other Chinese restaurants in that area but the waitress there was rude.\nThe plates and tea cup are dirty.\n\nI really cannot find a good reason to eat there!!!!
It made me sick. Really sick. \n\nIt
Worst place to eat. Go somewhere else. They even Charged me extra for my 10 year because he was taller than 5ft. Terrible service, dirty and smelly. Never coming back again.!
Food look like it was jst tossed on plate and plate looked like a kids meal.not to mention i waited an hour for an appetizer tht ddnt even come with plates.horrible service
This is, without a doubt, the best Italian food you might find in Arizona. Not only is the food and service great but it comes at a very low price.
We went to Edinburgh Castle early on a Sunday morning trying to beat the crowds and it definitely worked.  The castle is very well preserved and a must see attraction while in Edinburgh.
Nice little hole in the wall. Everything was great. Even chatted up the boss a bit. Very nice guy.
Terrible. Bad employee attitudes and lack of team work. The poppyseed muffin was so hard it crumbled into crunchy pieces. Wasted money. Went to Starbucks for lemon pound cake. ..yummm
The cookies are pretty here. I like to come here and make pretend I was in the mood for something else so I can act surprised because the sandwiches are so yummy!
Warning!!!!\n\nThe Bundtinis are like Pringles. Once You Pop, You Cant Stop!!!
Everything about this place seems to be a lesser version of a normal CPK: the menu is abbreviated, the pizza seems small, and the taste is missing. Prices however remain to be the same or higher than other franchise locations. Avoid this place if you can.
Has the best nigiri that I've tasted. Get the salmon nigiri. Enjoy.
Love the beer, the appetizers are good too.  Just a great place to hang out, can't wait until it cools down and can hang in the patio!
I give this location four stars for the most improved.  Having gone from a eatery who only employed rude young adults, the customer service has greatly improved.  The food has always been well prepared by a very professional kitchen staff and the price is reasonable for what you get.
We wanted to try this place because we had a coupon. We haven't been here before. It was a nice place. The food was pretty good and the service was ok. \n\nWe can't wait to come back again.
Bleh. Meh. Pff. Overpriced low-quality diner food. Think Denny's quality with a 300% markup.
Maybe it's just me, but it seems like the staff at this location isn't all that friendly.
First time eating at Hungry Howies and will certainly go back. Service was friendly, pizza fresh and hot and we enjoyed trying the flavored crusts - Ranch and Asiago.
Great food and it won't put a hole in your wallet.  I love the Spicy Beef Vermicello soup and the rice crepes, and the avocado shakes.  I can eat here everyday.
This place is the real deal.  The pho here has really deep developed flavors.  Good sized portions & good prices.
Awesome huge slices of New York style pizza.  Perfect amound of sauce and cheese on a chewy & crisp crust.  Pizza came out hot and fresh!  Staff was happy and accommodating.  Bing bang for your buck!
Very consistent.  This location always does well with Service.
Amazing clothing and fantastic deals! As a photographer this is my first stop for designing shoots when I need amazing wardrobe items. The owners are really nice and friendly and very helpful.
Overpriced!!!\nBad service!!!\nThe MOST important thing is the food taste REALLY BAD!!!
I have ordered from Sassy Sal's in the past and the order has been wrong.  So hoping against hope we ordered again.   Guess what, order wrong again.  Last time we order from them.  Their phone help leaves a lot to be desired.
We were very disappointed. Had the ribs and pulled pork sandwich with potato salad and Mac n cheese. None of the the food had any flavor except for the potato salad. That was the only thing we finished. Don't waste your time or money on this place.
Excellent food and service. Highly recommend. Nice people, clean place. I would definetly return
This was our first time here. . The service was Fantastic and Fast!!! The food is delicious and filling. ..we will be back soon!!
Chicken fried steak and eggs rocks!!!!!!!  Service was excellent. Very attentive. Portions were big and prices were fair. Location was easily accessible with plenty of parking. Restaurant was clean and coffee delicious. We loved it. Great weekend breakfast spot.
Good food, good service! Sometimes there's a wait, but I've never waited more than 25 minutes and it's totally worth it!
This place was DELISH! !! Their biscuits & gravy are to die for.  So was the country fried steak, pancakes and french toast. We had a feast and loved every bite.  Def coming back on my next vegas trip!
One of my favorite restaurants! I eat at Cornish Pasty at least once a month because the food is that good and the atmosphere is ago much fun. Everything on the menu is yummy, but the Reuben pasty is the best on the menu. Truly delish.
So good! Perfect for comfort food! Just amazing food!
We HIGHLY, HIGHLY recommend this awesome place!  We both had the Chicken Greek Pasty...delicious! A very unique place to eat at. Cannot wait to go back to try something else on their menu. Try to go here!
I come here alot and their foods are extraordinary. The atmosphere is nice too. Be sure to order their lemonade, it was squeesh fresh when we went there. Really good serving size too. Iam sure you wont be able to finish one pastry alone.:)
Very good, like a hot pocket on steroids.
Terrific vegan food and great beer-woohoo! Just wish it were bigger so I could sit down and enjoy the food and drink more quickly!
Good food!!  Nice atmosphere!!
This place is so gross but has a good comedy show.
Can't speak for the rooms, but the Casino remodel is very nice and provides a much needed improvement.  I enjoyed gambling there for a couple of hours.
new remodel did them good.\n\nRooms smelled of smoke, even though it was non-smoking.  (room 1789)\n\nstaff were great though and the location is really good especially if you have a car.  Easy in/out of the strip area
The staffs was rude and management doesn't seem to care. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.
The remodel is on point. Favorite hotel by far. Loved the staff and that free cookie was the bees knees. I can't wait to stay again.
The staff here are friendly and go out of their way to assist their customers.  I had an awesome experience with a female security officer when I was there gambling she assisted my disabled friend and I up to our room and was extremely courteous.
This location Rocks! The staff (both front and back of house) know what they are doing - which is very refreshing these days. Just wish it wasn't overrun w/ so many loud kids. Thanks Gilbert location for holding true to Pita Jungle's standards!
Solid Pita Jungle. All our food was fresh, fast, and good. A little bit of a wait on a Friday night, but not bad. Staff was fast, friendly, and courteous. Will definitely be back.
Greasy , Wet , soagy . They were out of chicken, so i got a mixed of what ever they had left.
Disappointed. Was recommended, was expecting so much. Was a bit dirty, waited ages to get served, so long we nearly walked out. Looked like loads of managers, no staff. Staff looked bored and poorly trained. What a let down.
Great service. Good Pizza. However, the sweat tea needs help.
Phenomenal New York Pizza! One if the best pizzas I have ever had in my life. Very delicious. The service was top notch here and very fast as well. It is very affordable pricing along with a cozy setting. :) Highly recommend this place!
The best part of my experience at this over priced, noisy, average foods quality wing joint is that the service is so slow that I have time to write this review. Thank you for wasting as much of my time as possible!
Came here with the In-law family for a group dinner on a wedding weekend. Food was quite tasty and servings were just plain obnoxiously large. When I come back through, I'll make sure we make this a stop.
I still enjoy Old Chicago after all this time.  Great place with lunch specials, good soups and always something FUN on Tap!   It feels like a true pub and places that seem few and far between these days. PS. They still have the PIZZA thing Down Pat!
Tried the corn chowder and it was divine. I especially loved the grated Vermont white cheddar on top!
Great place for lunch, although the buffet selection is quite small, every item is very good.
I can't believe I paid over $13 for two milkshakes. Why would I do that? It's not that they were bad milkshakes, they were fine, but no milkshake is that good. Not in Gilbert.
Good BBQ, the brisket was good, but not great in my mind.
Best breakfast burritos.  I had about given up on this, because of the clueless and tasteless offerings from other restaurants.  Best coffee.\n\nSometimes they will lose track of your order, but this is easily fixed, and I will keep coming back.
I'm in Sun City visiting my mom, and apparently this is a favorite of she and her husband. I'm absolutely stunned, as they usually have decent taste. Thus place was truly terrible.  The only redeeming quality was that it was relatively clean.
SMall place tucked in the back of a shopping center.\n\nThe people that work there are WEIRD.  The food is GREAT!
Its a post office in a crappy ghetto location thats all
This Sonic had good food (for a Sonic) but service was very slow.\n\nBe advised that they use fake whipped cream as a topping on their shakes and (presumably) ice cream.
Good food, crowded, hurried service  (the bus boy would swoop in and grab stuff as he said \"you done\")
After 10 PM they stop serving mashed potatoes. Service is usually slow. The cooks don't really know how to cook properly. Not impressed at all. If you want a sit down late night, go to Arizona Charlie's.
tasty food and good size portions, homemade presentation and flavor.
Aloha Friday laulau plate with the butterfish was a real winnah. Customer service was down right island style.
Soooo delicious!  We always get the mixed plate with Chicken Katsu, and beef teriyaki.  The kalbi short ribs are delicious as well.  Highly recommended!
Don't know why everyone likes this place. Ate here three times in hope I was wrong. I was right, this place is over rated. Their ahi poke was salty. You can't have hawaiian food and mess up poke.
Had the Orange chicken and garlic chicken and it's ok, I've had better.  Wouldn't go back.
Not worth the time let alone the money... Given I live close by I was really routing for the place and even went twice. Second chance was just as disappointing as the first.
This is the best Kabob place I've found on the East Side. We usually do take out and the meat is cooked and seasoned perfectly and the rice is delicious. Very gracious staff as well. I usually order the beef kabob and I love it.
Beware! Place has become pretentious. Cover for women now and expensive drinks.
OK, so this place is not favorable. I do not want to incite any horror sensations. But this place brought unwanted objects in my food and a terrible case of stomach problems for a few days. Skip this place if you'er craving Thai, go elsewhere.
I wouldn't eat here again if it was free!  The food was just okay at best.  But the minute you walk in, your feet stick to the floor.  The tables and counter tops are sticky.  It is just filthy in this place.  Do not recommend this under any circumstances.
Catfish taco lunch special every Friday.  Great lunch for $5!\n\nThat said, the best time of day to visit the Kitchen is happy hour - bargains on very high quality offerings.
Went there on steak night. Didn't have a big selection of food. Steak cooked just the way u like it.Liked fried oysters and cheese cake ice cream. I think it was $12
Our breakfast buffet was disappointing on a number of levels including the absence of ripe fruit and no Chinese or Italian food. My huevos rancheros suffered from stale tortillas and overcooked eggs.
Super nice checkers Peggy, Carmallee, and Connie (store manager). Clean and very helpful meat and deli people!
I love Metta Yoga.  The instructors are so warm and helpful, and the other students too are not afraid to laugh and also help me \"get\" a pose.  Awesome vibes to this place.  I bought a package deal so I could come again after my first free class.
Cleanly place. Was satisfied with the bowl of Pho I got.
I've only ordered carryout pho from here and it was phenomenal. The broth is a tad nontraditional, but very flavorful and totally delicious.
Ok service. Bad food. We had a group of 8 and no one liked their dishes.
It's harder to find because it's located under the steps in the plaza.  It looks dodgy but this is a legit place.  Service was good and it's decent in pricing for the area.
For Arizona, this place does a pretty good breakfast. The french toast is where it's at though...So when you go, you'll want the french toast. End of story.
The staff is nice, but the clothing is super overpriced. $40 for a plain t-shirt? No thanks.
Saw 2 ROACHES my last visit, I will not be back!!!!!!! Change the name to Roaci!!!
I got a horrible haircut...will never go back...I am not very picky and all I asked was for my stylist not to take much off...she cut almost 5 inches...unacceptable
It's much too much in my opinion.  Long lines, big crowds, so much merchandise you can't digest it all.
My 4- year old likes this place. He was disappointed that they stopped giving out balloons. The food is Ok and they have a respectable beer and cocktail selection.  As far as the food, it is predictable and decent.
Just had dinner last night here.  The Pinot Grigio just ok BUT THE FOOD was really good.  I would receomend this resturant to anyone.
I really liked the place. Went and got half-priced pizza on a Wednesday. The waiter was on top of the drinks and they had a magician doing some dope magic tricks. The pizza was great in my mind and even better for the price I paid. I'm definitely going back.
Good buffet, all you can eat style restaurant. good variety of sea food, and some sushi, although i didn't eat any, my brother said it was good. good place to go for the price.
Very standard as far as buffets go. With a good seafood selection, sushi and respectable dishes (keeping in mind that Mesa is not the culinary Center of United States) I think everyone can put this on their list of \"okay\" places to eat.
The food was ok.. When they have it. I counted 8 empty pans. The ice cream was the consistency of milk. All this for $12.49?!!!!!! I got ripped off
Try the chicken and fried beef, this place is your traditional Cuban joint and one of the few that is really good in this area. Be prepared to wait a little while, but that is usually standard at most authentic Cuban places. You will not leave hungry.  They have a live band on weekends.
Ask for Kym.  Enough said.
The people who work at Dutch Bros are seriously the cutest, sweetest baristas, ever. Definitely a funky, party kind of vibe. Wonderful coffee, great service.
Great job & friendly. They do beautiful gels and the salon is clean.\nI will visit them again for sure!
Staff is always very friendly!
Really good and spicy Thai food. Definitely recommend the Kung Pao.
The food was decent at best,  service was awful.  Lazy host, slow service,  mediocre food.  I would not go back to this location.  Management needs to work on the customer service for this restaurant!!!
Not my favorite Hilton but I appreciate that the hotel is on the far end of the strip with no casino. Made it seem more like a relaxing vacation. The rooms were affordable in price but the spa is a different story. We're Hilton fans and will visit this hotel again.
Love this location!  I created NAKED SUSHI at Geisha House a few years ago and  I'm glad to see they kept it going since I left.  Food is great and the staff are very nice!
It's okay.  The food isn't even remotely Irish.  They can do better.
Love this hotel! Very kid friendly, breakfast was great and economical. Close to many restaurants and right off the freeway for easy access. Very clean and modern. Pool was clean and good size but towels very small.
I love this resort and this bar is no exception!  Beautiful decor, great service and excellent drink selections!
design orgasm.
Worst electric system. IPod hookups dont work and the speakers were blown. Butlers go through your shit and the lamps never turn off.
It's a beautiful place.  Get their Crystal Suite, you won't be disappoint.  Beautiful room and view.
If I could. I would  give u - 10 stars the worst gift shop stupid staff they don't know what they r doing they r good for nothing
This place does not live up to the hype. I was staying for a convention. The rooms were not that great. The convention center was either to hot or cold. My stomach is still recovering from the food. A serious disappointment!
Gotta be one of the nicest and fanciest rooms I've stayed in in a very long time.  The bed was so comfortable I ended up hitting the snooze button multiple times just so I could rest longer... not sure if that was a good thing or a bad thing
perfect \"10\" every time
Very disappointed in Aria.\n\n- $28 for any non-refundable charge\n- Overly engineered room. There are about 30 buttons to control the room. But, I cannot find the only one that matters : the lamp\n- The bed is too soft.
Check-in was horrible , worst I have ever seen in LV. The managers and the check in people were unconcerned about 30 min to 1 hour check in , and even rude
This was my worst Las Vegas experience.  The Aria has to be the most overpriced, worst customer service hotel in Vegas!\n\nBad, overpriced food, rude service (lose use of reference) staff.  Stay somewhere else...please!
loved this beautiful hotel!\nnice staff!...\ngreat location....next to \"crystal\"...if you love to shop =)\nI will come back again!
For the money spent (and lost) it simply didn't live up to my expectations.
The Buffet is fantastic!
I absolutely love this hotel. Service, rooms, everything is exceptional. \n\nLast there mid December. I won't stay anywhere else.
Great place to sleep while on vacation, soft pillows and beds. The bathroom is modern and spacious with more than enough room for two people to be at the same time. The food options you have at the ARIA are great but can be pricey depending on where you eat.
amazing service & incredible rooms, amenities, facilities. worth every penny, highly recommend! some (not all) of the on-site restaurants are pretty good too...
This hotel was by far one of the prettiest for its cost. The restaurants  bathrooms and rooms were killer. Clean rooms and yummy food. Best buffet by far.
Great room and even better in room dining staff. Check in line was a little long but everything else was easy thanks to the technology available (TV check out from room). Valet was easy and quick service each morning. I would stay again or recommend to others.
I'm on the fence on whether I like Aria or Cosmo better, but I know for sure that I like playing poker in Aria, so it is all the more convenient to stay there.
i would love to stay at this beautiful hotel again
Great hotel. Great service from the front desk. Have no complaints about the hotel. \n\nThe only downside is the walk to casinos, though not too bad if you want to go to Aria. \n\nDefinitely worth the stay.
Stayed here in March, asked for a upgrade to a fountain view, the view at night was unreal. Although it was easy to get to the Bellagio and the Aria, walking  to the Cosmopolitan was a maze.
This hotel is on the strip, walking distance to everything, but calm and quiet. The rooms are gorgeous. (amazing bath tub with rose petals left on your towel) The bar has an amazing view and delicious cocktails! I can't wait to stay here again and enjoy some pool time!
loved to ambience. great food. average drinks.
Was craving some Chinese fried rice and came out to find pretty good Chinese food at this hole in the wall spot. Totally a great bang for your buck which is weird to say in Vegas. Great family owned business. Will come back again
Had a good experience. I had the hot and sour soup an the mapo tofu. They were great for the price just a bit to oily. Other than that It was ok. Good for the price.
This place was amazing, best AYCE in town! The customer service was very good and they had the cutest lil Asian waitress working haha. The Sex Bomb roll was delicious and so were every other roll we ordered!  Definitely coming back soon!
OVERATED! Not impressive in the least bit. Nothing special, not fresh and the service was sub par. Wildflower is far superior.
Terrible service!! Rude manager! Lost a customer for life And the manager didn't care
So ono! Wonderful fish, wonderful service! I can't believe I didn't find out about this place sooner. I'm bummed they're closed tomorrow!
Great food. Great service. The best beer selection in all of Steele Creek.
Just ordered the steak burrito. I thought the meat was good but on the whole a very simple meal..nothing special. Decent delivery time and decent prices makes this a decent place to order from.
I'm a sushi eater and the sushi here is terrible. Everything has crab meat - even a basic salmon roll. No asparagus or wasabi aioli, etc. Teppan was decent. No fancy show but not bad
Came in from out of town needing a shave got one of the best shaves I've ever had.  The stylist was from out of town but she did a great job. Highly recommend this place
I put in an order for pick up. My food was ready on time and my order was correct even with my modifications. This is not a 5 star restaurant, but it was 5 stars for what it is!
love this place!!!!
Fun place to take the puppy.
Service by casey not so good food was excellent
Came here for happy hour, the food was ok, asked the bar tender about the free drink with any purchase offer on yelp. He didn't even know about it, and didn't give me an answer neither....
Good food, good atmosphere, terrible prices. $3 burger for $6
Terrible spring training facility. Bad food, seats all the sun, no cup holders. Many better stadiums around greater Phoenix area. Employees are rude and make the experience uninviting.
Tried to eat here.  Despite sixteen open tables there was a twenty minute wait.  When I asked the manager about this he was very rude so we left.  We will not be back.
This was by far the worst service I've had in awhile, the place was empty and our server never came to us. I think if they changed it to a serve yourself buffet it would be a much better place to have dinner
I ordered the Cajan style ribeye which is marinated for 36 hour and it was delicious. Good customer service and clean.
I had my birthday dinner here. It was my first time. I was not disappointed. I had the filet it was so good.  I could cut the steak with a butter knife. For desert, I had the ultimate cheese cake.  It was massive and delicious.
Amazing Mac and Cheese Burger.\n\nDreadful Pizza.\n\n..There were ants on the table.
Love the opera renditions. Bring me to tears.\nMinus a star for Faith Hill and \"contemporary\" selections.\n\nMy favorite thing in Vegas.
it's a very romantic beautiful spot at night, especially when the music is on. took some vedios and still feel excited when replaying it at home.
I love these fountains! I can sit there and watch them for hours.....They are beautiful and, even better, they are free! Can't beat it for sure.
Nothing says Oceans 12, we've finally made it, like watching the Bellagio fountains!\n\nPRO TIP OF THE DAY: Pay the fare to go to the top of the Paris tower to watch the show! Worth it.
Definitely do not miss this on a trip to Vegas!! This is one of the most amazing things we were lucky enough to get to see on our short trip! And its free!!
The best curry house in Edinburgh. Bar none
Nice staff. Informative during my delayed flight. Ordered the bratwurst. Good for airport food. Decent!
Extremly Dissapointed, I came to this place thinking it was truly the best place in Vegas but its not even close to Good. Don't Waist your Money.
Went here for a last minute Mother's day trip.  \n\nThey were offering a special Mother's Day menu - not impressed.
It was okay. Nothing crazy. I mean all you can eat crab legs and oysters was my highlight.
fast and friendly good food.
The buffet is well worth the price!  My kids had a great time picking out which freshly scooped icecream they wanted after their meal and the choices were endless there!  Great staff too!
Really nice 5 mile hike that was easy on the knees.
Excellent coffee drinks. They also roast a variety of their own beans so when you buy those by the pound it makes for great coffee at home.  We are hooked!
After Planet Dailies and Trader Vic's, I was soooooo happy to land at P F Chang's.  Good food, pretty good service, resonable prices.  Only a few minor negatives, but I much preferred P F Chang's.
Came with a group of 7, and had a fantastic server that got our orders right, and got them out to us very fast! \n\nLove the honey glazed chicken.
I've eaten at PF Chang's a few times and it is always a C-.  I really didn't like any of the dishes I had this time and I think I have to remind myself that even when desperate and starving, I should find somewhere else to go.
This has to be some of the worst sushi and burgers I have had in a very long time.\n\nSushi was loaded with rice and not very flavorful.  Burger tasted like a frozen patty and again lacked character and flavor
Such a great atmosphere, friendly staff and a wide variety of sushi/non sushi. Such a great surprise, can't wait to go back again!
Good food.   Fair price.  Very friendly staff\nQuick service
Pretty big menu, and overall pretty decent breakfast...nothing crazy good here though, everything I have had is just ok. Egg works got them beat for sure! Or if you want some real solid breakfast go to the coffee cup!
Very pricey for what you get. Only ok service. Sometimes staff is a bit rude.
If you just imagine you're in mainland China, this will feel right. Service is a bit strange,  but it's traditional Chinese service. I come for the ever elusive, hard to find chichen chop suey, and I love it !
Service - terrible; food - so-so; blonde waitress with a massive black eye - classy.
Went for breakfast and everyone around us was sending back the food because it was not hot. I had the Lox and bagels which was good but it seemed not a lot of people enjoyed their food. But good prices and decent food.
Macaroni and cheese with martini...a great way to end a long day. And the music in the bar area doesn't suck.
Great new location. I am excited they moved closer to us. Always the best sandwiches in Surprise.
The only thing I really get here is the salad with grilled steak.  It's pretty big and like that you can get it with shredded lettuce.  Other than that, everything else I have tried has not been as good as Chipotle's offerings.
The side cucumber pasta salad is tasty and refreshing, but the sandwiches I've tried so far have been pretty bland.  I love the sweet green tea from their dispensers though.  It's a nice atmosphere
We brought our BMW for a simple repair they gave it back to us undriveable and wouldn't help rectify the problems that they caused. We finally took it to another shop and had to pay thousands to fix the problems that goodspeed caused. Go elsewhere.
The wine here is amazing! If you are not a wine person, your choices are limited but you can still find some good beer. I'm not a big bruschetta fan, but get it with salami and pesto!! Its to die for!!
The waiting is too long!! They should expand their patio , offer a complementary drink if you wait is more then an hour ! Who waits an hour to go out to eat! This is the reason i dont come here. She wanted to come here!
You will find no other bruschetta place with such diverse menu and ever-changing wine list, which consistently exceeds expectations.
Great food crappy service and they tried to over charge us for 2 drinks wow!! I was shocked how our waitress kept walking passed us we had to ask 2 other people to help just to get place our order and get drinks.
Nice experience. Good price. For me, an hour is too long and 30 is too short.  Go for the 45.
Just got done having a nice dinner with friends. Great food and great service. Had the verde burrito. Great atmosphere and people.Will definitely be going back.
Nice hotel situated close to old Port. Rooms are comfortable, and service is amazing.......\nNice beds and the shower is pretty nice for a Westin, yo? \n\nRoom service is fast and amazing....
The food is OK, but what do you expect for a chain restaurant.  The enchilada sauce tasted like it came out of a can.
I expected so much more. The food here was eatable, there wasn't much variety. The \"sushi\" was rice and veggie rolls. I'm not coming back.
Superb Coffee shop. Very nice place, great bakery goods, excellent coffee, and also always has reliable wifi.
Taste of the mid west! No wonder the heartland is over weight! Lol
Very bad experience. Mattress was stained, bathroom door was peeling and front desk staff were rude when they were informed of the issues.
This place is simply okay.  It's usually busy, especially for breakfast on the weekends, but I believe that is because there is a lack of options in town.  Nothing here is awful, but it's just not that good either.  Meh.
Love this place!  They always have great beers on tap & the lil pig sandwich is plenty of food for lunch or dinner. We take my Dad here when he comes in from KC and he likes the BBQ.
One of my absolute favorite places in Vegas! Such a great piano bar and so completely underrated. The bartenders have some of the best voices I've ever heard (Specifically Dre- Amazing voice!!!) great entertainment and a must visit if you are in Fremont St
High on price and low on friendly customer service. Food is good but over priced. If paying for overpriced food, at least be friendly to your customers.
Yummy sushi in a clean atmosphere. I hope this place makes it because we need good sushi on the east side. Love their salad dressing too!
I love Luci's!!! Get their Hot Juan Black Bean Burger. It's the best I've ever had. Also try their sweet tots to at least once in place of their tator tots. So good YUM!
What a waste of time.. Twice the price of similar restaurants, half the portion size, and tastes average at best. Will NEVER be back.
Our favorite sushi place.  Large, creative sushi menu & complete dinners.  Attractive atmosphere w/ Japanese art & artistically drawn menu ads on the walls.  We've always had good service.
Good overall quality, a nice selection, and they deliver to my office. I tried the crab puffs and the sampler platter for my last order. The egg drop soup is especially good with a side of crispy noodles. You can order via Grub-hub.
The best! Happy hour m-f from 1030am to 7? Thats crazy! 2.00 drafts! Specials everyday. All sports on all the time! FOOD IS THE BEST!
Moira  updated their menu and took off those frozen potstickers that I mentioned in my earlier review.  Service was terrific and their new offerings were delicious.  They have a roll topped with a coconut shrimp that is very tasty.  Also enjoyed the $5 bombers that were on special for Halloween.
Gave this place one more try. My car waited 10 min after wash before any attendants started rewetting it and drying it. Skeletal crew. More expensive than other places so won't be coming back.
They rip you off for oil changes. Also, the guys are total salesmen. I would go somewhere else.
Can't say much more that what has already been said. Good service great food well executed.
bad service, overpriced (by Vegas standards).  I left in the middle of the pedicure.  'nuff said.
The food was DELICIOUS!!!!!\nI, too, like a couple of others mentioned, was a tad scared in that area. But, I think the food was worth the risk.
Went here with some coworkers for lunch. Was not impressed with the pizza at all. The garlic bread tasted store bought. Will not return.
Worst Owner/Manager, terrible receptionist.\nDon't ever buy a gift certificate, difficult to use, improper handling of appointments, rude receptionist and owner.
It's a very very good pizza. Been their 3 times  the only draw back is very dark in the parking lot.
Only been here once, but the sa cha tripe was very tasty. very fast service and a funny off-beat location. I'll definitely be back.
Haven't eaten here in over a decade but was hella impressed with the eggs benedict sandwhich. Wait was a little long.
This location sucks!!! Everyone provided horrible customer service. The manager was absolutely rude. All i wanted was for them to warm my coffee a little more in which was given to me cold. Never again going to this locations.
poor service
Not very good. My friends and I were hungry, and we mistakenly chose the first place we could find. All five of us felt like our burgers were dry, when we ordered medium, and that the buns tasted borderline stale. We all left unsatisfied.
One word. Nasty! Take a walk to burger bar at Mandalay shoppes better service and way better food!!!!
The service here is good, our server Jaimie was great and the yummy Tropical iced tea was never empty. I had the ahi steak salad which was cooked nicely but I recommend asking for the dressing on the side.
This place is CLOSED now. Waaaa! So take your stingy butts to Chipotle 3 stores down.  They got $5 burritos but NO FREE CHIPS! We will miss that!
Pink place outside Ceasars. Lousy food, lousy service.  Skip it.  If you want inexpensive, go to In-n-Out Burger!
Frozen hot chocolate, grilled cheese sandwiches, goldfishes swimming in my tomato soup, creamy mac and cheese, and one of the best chili I have tried.  Can't you tell I like this place.  My Las Vegas to go to place!
If you're from New Orleans, or love New Orleans food, do NOT waste your time. The breakfast was very disappointing.  The service was slow and not friendly. Coffee is $4 a cup, which they do not fill all the way and there are no free refills.
The employees seem to hate their lives. We waited 15 minutes before the server even acknowledged us! They need some vitamin D in their lives!
40 minute wait for hotdog and burger, others waited longer than us just for ice cream.... $10 tiny burger. Don't do it
Frozen Hot Chocolate.  That's pretty much it...it's worth the wait and worth trying it at least once, no matter what the impact on your wallet is.
The food here is mediocre. I can probably make the same thing I've had here at home. It's also way over priced. Don't waste your money on an easy Mac Alfredo pasta or a Las Vegas steak strip hard rock bread sandwich!
Great Brunch in Vegas.  sit out on the patio over the strip and people watch
Love this place.  Of course they are famous for their frozen hot chocolate.. it is amazing. The High heel pump sandwich was very good.. The food is good and a fun place to eat.. I have to go there a few times a year...
Worst service. Had reservations and was bring our child to celebrate her Bday.  Had to walk out after an hour of waiting.  Manager was passive and didn't care.  DO NOT GO HERE unless you have to do the touristy thing!
Awesome pizza but the service was horrible. It took over 20 minutes to get a glass of water. The couple next to us sat after we did but they got their water immediately. We will not return
The service takes forever... But they are nice... Obviously you must get the Frozen Hot Chocolate... Get it girrrrrrrrrrl
Good stuff great food awesome atmosphere love the restaurant I will be back. A must to if you're feeling up for dessert.
Its okay
The sushi here is very fresh and I always enjoy my meal. I would recommend to anyone in the mood for high quality sushi. Prices can be a little high for specialty rolls.
The fish was fresh enough but the spicy crab roll was all heat.  Gyoza seemed overdone and the edamame was bland.  Service was good if you don't count the servers standing around the teppanyaki table chatting away.
Excellent place , Our waitress was the best !!!
The guys at 412 are curating great merchandise from some of the top names in cutting edge, 'old school' street style that is perfect for young Pittsburgers of all ages!
Long wait but once you get in it is an experience, the food is great and the beer is as authentic as you can get out of the alps
Their beer was decent but overall I feel like there are better breweries and beer destinations in the city. I do enjoy stopping in occasionally for the atmosphere. The German music, great hall setup, shot-skis and lederhosen can make for a rowdy crowd at times.
Awesomely authentic German bier!
My boyfriend is a brewer and I'm a restaurant manager/ bartender. The only thing better than the beer was the service! Rob the bartender is great and everyone was so friendly. Giant pretzel with beer cheese is the perfect bar snack. Go here!
Don't go here to gamble! The food is good, but the bartenders are awful. They spent the whole night gossiping in the corner and talking on the phone. I'd rather take my money elsewhere.
Bons burgers. Salle sympa.
People working there are so rude. They chatting with coworker while I am waiting to check out. They told me to wait. And the cashiers so rude, no smile, anger faces. Make me feel uncomrtable.
When you say your a vegetarian don't recomend the potato soup with Bacon. Then don't mess around with me about the refund, with no mea culpa.
get rid of the fries on the sandwiches and put the toppings on that i ordered
I really enjoy watching the planes come in and out in this nice cafe spot. Food is decent and service is always prompt.
Stopped in Sunday Morning to check out.  Service was very slow and all food taste like it was cooked in the same bacon grease. Waited forever for our food and it was horrible. First and last time for this place !!!!!!!
Levi  was fast, efficient, and affordable.  My car key went missing and Levi came quick and kept his word. When I had a problem he came to fix it ASAP. THANKS
Buy me chipotle and get chipotlaid~ \n\nJk. My food was great tonight, and I now have lunch for tomorrow. Chips and guacamole from here are my favorite.
Went her yesterday nd got some English Bangers and some English Bacon.  YUMMO, they have a great aray of meat there, Will be going back there again, to get some Lamb next time.  Prices are very reasonable.
the food there was ok...\nBUT the place was dirty!! \nthe service was ok but it was sooo dirty also with the waiter's top and pants, YUCK!
If you want horrible service and want to be treated like you are an inconvenience to the wait staff, then bj's is for you. This place just flat out sucks!!! I won't be back. I'll use my federal reserve notes somewhere else.
Food is cold, over rated, not fresh and service isn't friendly. Waiters are always rushing you to order. This BJ's on this side of town is awful! Please get better management.
Server could've been more attentive.  Sat in dining area instead of bar.  My steak too done.
Typical food. Nothing fancy. No frills. But nothing bland or horrible either. If you're just looking for a place to eat, this will do.
Sloooow service. Basically they seat you and forget about you. I watched it happen to everyone who came in. Food wasn't very good, either.
This is the best 24 HF I have been to in AZ. Very clean, great equipment and plenty of space. The volume of \"lockers with free locks\" is great. This gym can get crowded when the afternoon / evening crowd arrives (5PM - 7PM).
This place is next to my work so it's convenient. The staff is friendly and always willing to help. Definitely recommend this place
Loving Hut is ok.   Great that they care.  Their heart is in the right place.  Food is average - frequently processed and over-salted.  Nice atmosphere.
This is my morning place. A quick drive from my house and conveniently located on Tatum. The lines here move quickly, coffee is great, staff are friendly. What's not to love? It's what you'd expect from a Starbucks, but what few actually deliver.
Came here for dinner. Geez, no one bothered to greet us, seat us or act like we existed. Waited long enough & finally gave up & left.  Take your business & eat where they welcome customers. These people could care less
Hands down the best Thai Restarunt in Las vegas, definitely worth checking out if u love Thai food, the portion sizes are good, great location, with great prices. Customer services is good. It can be better but I don't mind it because the food is execellente
Great meal. Tom yum soup hits the spot on a cool day. \nLast couple trips here it seems the soup and entrees come out very close to each other. I would prefer to eat the soup before the entree arrives. \nBut a solid meal everytime.
The beef terriyaki was terrible. It tasted like the meat had been frozen for months. The price was expensive too. We also ordered a couple of rolls. They tasted ok but way over priced for the portion size. I do not recommend this restaurant.
This restaurant is out of business. I was really disappointed!
Good atmosphere, tasty food. This is a fun place to grab a bite to eat and watch a game or two. Decent drink specials - they do a Wednesday night beer roulette.
Ive always loved walmart for the cheap prices and convenience.  WALMART YAY!
I have to say, I was quite disappointed with the crepes.  We got the Queen City and Mascarpone and Berries. They were thick and more like burrito texture than actually crepes.  Don't think i will  be coming here again for crepes.
Food just ok for me. I had a savory crepe with ham & cheese. Wasn't great. I'd like to go back & try a dessert crepe next time. Dim lighting, cool, calm & classy interior. great place for a date.
Rookie place. If you don't care about decor go to US Egg around the corner. Better service, food and coffee. Bacon took 25 mins to cook bad pancakes and serve cold coffee by a very annoying waitress.
went for a group dinner, meatballs were amazing, the other food was kinda egh, also a bit pricey, decor was nice. Probably go there again if it was for a date.
Best General Tso's Chicken in the valley. Higher priced but you get what you pay for. Love the option to get all white meat and brown rice.
Very good Indian food, quick service, great price. I eat mostly the vegetarian dishes from there, but have heard that the meat ones are just as good.
Went down there for compost and came home with compost AND delicious delicious bread!  I can't wait to go back again.
$12 for huge sacks of mulch, or $50 to fill the bed of our truck.
Coffee tasted like dirt. Didn't bring out the whole order when cooked. Then gave half of my order away. By the time I received the rest of my order the first half was cold. And they forgot my toast. The food was meh.
the kale salad is the bomb!
Very friendly service and nice atmosphere. They also allowed me to order the kid's bean & cheese burrito, which was only $4 and very large! It was also very good. Hopefully I will be able to return in the future to try more of the menu.
Haven't had a bad thing on the menu yet.  And surprisingly authentic!  Must try for the phoenix area.  I'm a regular.
I very rarely give a bad review but I HATE being ignored... I tip a lot \n\nBig mistake, huge.\n\nAh, well I'm off to find another place to spend my $$ :)
After visiting a few Thai restaurants in larger cities, I am pleased at how many things this place gets right.   Food is great.
Pretty easy trail but you have to pay a vehicle fee to get in.  The view isn't as great as some of the other peaks closer to Phoenix, but it's nice to avoid the crowds once in a while.
Food was delicious, portions were great, and price was very reasonable! Highly recommend
We ordered to go. Shrimp good, salad great,meat in orange beef was disgusting. Beef skewers disgusting. I'm not really sure it was beef. Not trying to be gross but I have to be honest, they are not using quality products. Never again.
Another one of my favorite brands. Whenever I'm in Vegas I have to stop by this store. Always have some good sales on some nice clothes. \n\nBen Sherman is dope!
Huge portions, good pricing, friendly service.  I really like this place.  No seating inside, but on a sunny day, great to pick up and sit in park next door.
i think this is closed??? their website is suspended?
Service isn't great.\n\nBeer is good and cold.\n\nFood is terrible, and my stomach has been turning flips since I dined here for lunch today. \n\nWe will not be retuning to Toby Keith's!
Thought it was really good.  Had the chicken pita and everything was fresh and flavorful.  The warm pita was really good and the chicken was well seasoned. Enjoyed eating on the patio. Would recommend it for lunch or casual dinner.
Coming from New York City to Pittsburgh for college, I always need to find good Chinese food around the neighborhood. My friend introduce me to this place and I have to say that the bakeries here are equally as tasty as bakeries in New York such as Taipan or Fei Da.
The concept is great and the raw foods are very good.  But it all falls down with the service.  I've experienced long waits here.
It's just your typical Starbucks, nothing special to report here.
Everything I have eaten has been delicious and reasonably priced. My favorite is the blueberry Danish. The chef and the ladies upfront are very friendly.
Great pork belly tacos.Small plates nice to try many items.Has good energy buzzing.Definitley will be returning next time in Charlotte.
The drinks are awesome. While the food is pretty good, It adds up since they are small plates. Don't go there hungry, but more so to enjoy drinks and an appetizer. Always prepare for an hr wait.
These guys have the right attitude when it comes to product and service.  They are consistently top notch.  Their people are well trained and always very friendly.  Dutch Bros is easy to give a 5 star rating for their great coffee and even better service.
Still a Star Nails fan, and receiving the same good service.  Some of the nail technicians are more experienced and perform better work; overall good value for the price.
Check out my review and photos:\n\nhttp://food-tales-and-other-fun.tumblr.com/post/29865866478/
No, No, No.\nI was expecting far better. While the service was better than the meal, I must say all I was, was disappointed. Tinoco's has become similar to a diner, with better than the average diner's pasta.
terrible experience - food, service, everything.
A nice newly renovated hotel and a super cheap rate.  I live all the Hilton products, but the Garden Inn's are the best.
This place has a nice small bar feel but still delivers all the amenities. I frequent Tailgaters during UFC events but I also enjoy non event days as well.The food is above average for bar food and the staff is great. I recommend this place and you get what you pay for.
Great breakfasts, veerrry attentive staff, and dog-friendly!  What else can I say?\n\nOh yeah, wonderful patio with outdoor bar, and quaint French-inspired bathrooms (waterclosets? :) ).
i finally was able to get hot food here. for this alone i am happy. oh, the hummus is excellent and so are the drinks.
I've been here twice for brunch and really enjoyed it. The Veggie Island breakfast was delicious, good coffee, and prompt friendly service.
Well we tried to come back..Went back this am for brunch. 8:15AM. NOT OPEN!!!  So disappointed! Signs posted say open
Love coming here food is always good no complaints here at all...And so awesome that all this worth the drive  thank you guys..
Awesome selection of vintage clothes for men and women.  Many sizes. Many colors! So cute! and the staff actually wears the clothing! :D great time! \n\nCHECK IT while you're in Las Vegas!
I really like this place.\n\nAnywhere that serves fresh juices and great big bowls of soup is always great satisfaction and hits the spot every time :)\n\nA great place to stop by for lunch with friends or just a quick juice :)
A+ amazing stuff. I love the feel of the place, the service is casual but professional and the food is next level outstanding. When it is on the ever changing menu, give the lamb osso bucco a try - it is fantastic. Prices are reasonable to boot.
One would think when there are only two other groups in the place they would get the order right but once again another place who seems to be lost in the service department and the food was just OK.
Food and Wine were excellent as always will return again very soon. The veal was fantastic.
I finally found a good Italian deli here in Las Vegas.  My only complaint is the bread on my capicola sandwich was a little tough.
Calm down, people. \n\nIt's pricey and pretty average. Go somewhere else if you can, but go if you have to, because it'll hit the spot if you want it enough.  #Firstworldproblems
I will not be coming back here again. Horrible service...... my table was being watched by the manager and it was awkward. I felt so freaked out I was scared to order anything. Not vapor friendly either. Don't eat here.
I have been here before and always enjoyed the coffee.  Today went with some friends and we all made a comment about the bad attitude of the staff.  The girl at the register was rude.  I do not think I will be going back anytime soon.
Pretty good for kids, average to below average for adults.  Friendly staff, good price.  Not the best tasting, but you can tolerate a slice or 2.  Limited dessert and salad options.
Paid top dollar to play in the morning, the greens are garbage, punched , slow , poor shape. Why pay to dollar for poor conditions
no comment!
Food a disgrace.\nBakery cloyingly sweet.\nService terrible.\nIt all change when Underground left. \nWill never go back.
Thank you Darla for a relaxing massage. The location was easy to find. Also, schedule the appointment was easy.
Chicken cobb pool-side\nSprouts, avocado, so good!\nSix dollar Cokes - bargain?
Great for Saints and LSU games.
Came here for brunch before a Cardinals' game. Food was good and drinks very generous. Love that they have the bus to the games. Very nice that everyone could enjoy their time and nobody had to worry about driving.
Tater tots and cheese with pretzel are great. But since the management change and name changes wow has the quality gone downhill. Live in the neighborhood and all this is good for now is a beer and watching football. The food and service just is so disappointing.
Fantastic wraps and pizza that we all shared! \nAwesome beer selection!\nGreat service, I would defiantly come back soon.
We enjoyed our meal, our service was excellent and most important to us our kids had a great time as well! The management was awesome when needed. Really have nothing but great things to say about dining in this establishment!
Yummy fresh alternative ---- tasty ----- the sweet potato\n fries are worth the add-on
My wife and I are regulars here.  Good because of the cost and availability of the produce.  Freshness also good.
Checked in and 2 hours later checked out.  There was no working wifi service in my room, nobody answering the switchboard, no replies from management, nobody available to help me out. Its a shame when management is so poor that a guest leaves feeling this way.
Horrible customer service! Malissa the manager would rather have a 2min + conversation about counting her daily calories then acknowledge a customer or even properly cash out a guest.
These guys are great - they texted me pictures of my animal while i was away - i would hands down hire them again and recommend them to anyone! Charges are reasonable and they provide very good customer service too!
Wasnt blown away by this place however decent selection of wine and various grocery. A bit pricey but managed to find some goodies. They have prepared food as well that sure smelled good. I may come back
Great staff, even, long lasting tan.
A family favorite. My family of four have been to the Daisy several times. It has become the go to stop that we all love. We feel right at home and get good food and service.
Favorite uptown pizzeria! Be sure to get a meat and cheese plate - it will cement the experience.
I'd go back.  Enough good unique food to go back.  The 5 star item was the dessert donuts.
Love this place!  Reasons to give them a try:  friendly service, precision manicure and pedicure, great prices.  I've been here numerous times since and have been equally satisfied after each visit.
How on earth is this show still on?  I went two years ago with friends, it was terrible.  Why oh why do people pay for this?\n\nYou will get far better value for your money by placing it all on black.
The food here is delicious, flavorful and colorful. This nice Indian buffet on the corner of Valley View and Sahara costs $11.00, and it's worth it. The restaurant has a nice elegant setting as well.
Snagged an online deal for this place after I heard about it from friends; it was really great! The portions were generous, the prices were reasonable and the staff was very kind. They don't have a full bar here though, so plan accordingly.
Food was no good. There were lots of indian customers inside. Is it a sign of good Indian food? For our taste, not good at all. Couldn't even find a spicy dish! Find another place in LV!
This market means well, but it's small and quite a hassle to get to. It mostly only has a few cheese and butcher shops and many (many!!) flower shops. I enjoyed my stop at the Choclatier here.
Very hard to get help or information. Most of the thirty workers are busy talking to each other than helping you. Does not know where or if they have a product or not. Asked five different people and non of them know what kind of specials they had for Veterans Day.
Nice place to talk and hang but service is poor, food is overpriced, wine is mediocre and we generally felt unwelcome. Hipsters would like it probably.
Very small portion relative to the price. \nthe food is salty, dry and taste alike!\nI am a REAL international traveler.
Cute place, but food was... meh. Portions are a bit smaller and the food seems a little catered to white people, as in not as spicy and seasoned. The beef salad was awesome but I'd shy away from the pad Thai and friend rice.
Its good for late night Thai food. Portions not as big as most Restaurants and a little higher priced.  good  because its open late night. Not bad, waitresses are  friendly. Has a nice bar.
Worst food terrible service and was forced to listen to the worst music ever created by a live singer hired to torture our ears\nI could not wait to get out of here.\n\nIf there were negative stars for this review\nIt would be warranted
Overpriced sandwiches!!\nWhere's the MEAT!\nOrdered a mediterranean chicken flatbread sandwich. I couldn't even find the chicken there was so much cabbage in it.
My gf sent me as a treat and it was the worst massage ever. I left before finishing the 90 minutes. I probably feel better massaging myself. So very disappointed.
Simply the best ramen in Scotland, chasu ramen all the way.
Crap, bad food, overpriced, and the worst service. Didn't know such a mediocre restaurant could even exist at a 5 star property on the strip?! Ugh!!!
Great food at a great price. Came here for happy hour and their drinks are amazing.
The food was outstanding, as were the drinks. The decor is simple, but cool. Service was top notch. Worth the price tag!
Yummy bone marrow, and oysters. Nice classy place, and great service.
The Chilean sea bass was amazing. The atmosphere was great and so was the service.
Absolutely enjoyed the dinner I had here.   Service was excellent and I have some very good memories from the dinner here.  A true pleasure and enjoyable experience.  Highly recommended.
Don't Seat on the bar very bad Service on the bar and this time the food was mediocre Bartender arguing with me about the quality of food VERY BAD SERVICE
How can this place even be considered a place to eat. The food is horible. We had to return our dishes for being cold. There was actual wilted lettuce that could'nt even be considered food for turtles. How can you mess up French Fries?
So I'm waiting in line to order take out and watch the 2nd round of the NFL playoffs, and the hostess informs me I have to be seated to order take out. Really? Fail!\n\nI'd like to give no stars if yelp allowed!
So disappointing. The space feels like a cafeteria, the food is underwhelming. The food looks good, but not the best quality. Very good service however, and I sure hope for everyone's sake employed there the place is reworked.
I am really surprised by the reviews.  We were there for lunch.  For a buffet, I thought the quality was great and there was a ton of variety.  Lunch was still a pretty good deal.  Guess I need to go try the Wynn's next visit and compare.
Excellent.  It has indian food (good for vegetarians). They make a salad in front of u whixh is good cuz they can properly toss it
Not my favorite buffet in Vegas. The price was pretty similar to The Wicked Spoon but half the selection and quality. The service was also disappointing. The plates were still left on the tables after coming back and drinks were not refilled. Felt like a cafeteria.
The owners really know their stuff. The food isn't over priced and they will get what you need if its healthy and available. Great selection of dog jackets. Good loyalty program.
Waited for ever for the host to appear. Never did. I had to walk into the restaurant and find myself a table. They need an complete overhaul of their staff. \n\nFood was standard thai. It was ok, nothing great though.
Good, but not worth the price.
If I could give this zero stars trust me I would. We had ordered Garlic Shrimp and Three Cups Chicken which both were supposed to have garlic flavor. The food came in 2 minutes indicating that it was not fresh. The food has no flavor of garlic.
All flavors are sub-standard. By far worst in east valley. Instead of being smooth & flavorful they are icy. Even my 7 year old didn't eat hers
Always nice to come here for lunch. The sandwiches are of course made super fast and the staff is uniformly friendly.
Howard the owner can be rude and unwelcoming. The rest of the staff are great.
Simply AMAZING in details and taste! A must for the love of food.
Had a wonderful meal here. The scallops appetizer was excellent thanks to the squash bed and accessory toppings. The Veal Loin was about as perfect as humanly possible. The Nutella Bombs were a nice sweet finish. All was helped by a polished professional waiter.
First time here! Food is good and customer service very good! Price is good! Love it!
The food was actually pretty tasty but the service I received spoiled the whole thing.  In this economy I'm not spending $8 on a 6 in. sub to be treated rudely.  I can go to Port of Subs or Capriotti's to the the same quality for less.
14 bucks for a meatball hero. Unreal. Walked out with my hands over my head....completely robbed. Place sucks.
Bummer. I was just there a month ago and had a good sandwich. Stopped by Friday 7/27 and the place is closed with paper over all the windows.
The food is okay. The rice is really weird.
This place is great but I dont think its open anymore.   It was closed for a few months due to fire or something.   Has it reopened?
This place sucks.  Period.  I'm a big fan of buffet, and frankly this place is what makes people hate buffets.  Never again.
I really hate cold buffet food. Nd today all items were cold. Maybe we arrived too soon after opening but we had to leave and I asked for a refund. I was given a gift card for a return visit which was nice.
lins is honestly the most amazing buffet ever !! maybe if you guys stop being disgusting and making a mess it wouldnt be so dirty ! the food is great and for a very reasonable price ! :)
Great work day gym to hit during lunch.  Just wish they would stop playing teeny bopper estrogen music in the men's locker room. ... Damn!!!
Horrible service is an understatement.  Everything wrong. Lower your standards?
Love this place!  Everything I have tried is excellent!  I love ordering online and doing takeout.  Great healthy yummy food!
Fair
good fries
It Was closed but   The Building  is Awesome and the Locations on the water is Fantastic
There for lunch and am not impressed.  The burger was fine, but not exceptional.  The service was slow and sloppy.  There were two people in the restaurant when we arrived, they left and two more came in, so it certainly wasn't a busy lunch hour.
As others had mentioned, it was just ok. Needed some food during a long layover, so it did the job. Nothing spectacular. Nice slide show of Sammy though, and nice memorabilia.
Big selection and nice people! Definitely going back to check out more!
The crew here is the best...The hawaiian guy in the front makes you not even think about stealing. The mobile department always hooks it up when it comes to the best plans. Great staff!
So dirty I was afraid to take my shoes off. Is there a way to give a quarter star?
Very fast, proffessional and a good value.
they charge a 10% restocking fee. The employees will not tell you about it till you bring the item back, even if you ask about the return process.
This place seems like a tourist trap. The food was not great. Wish we had gone somewhere else.
closed 07-13-13
LOVE this place.. we come here every time we come to Vegas.. you can find anything and everything here for a souvenir!
Went for the first time last week.  Great patio.  As far as food, only had nachos.  Wow I cant believe restaurants use cheese wiz.  Come on lets use some real cheese please !
Good place to go watch sports and just hang out with your friends. Food is pretty standard bar food and has good service.  Mixed crowd on Saturday night. I enjoyed my experience.
This place rocks!  The carne asada burrito with a side of guacamole and the other homemade salsas is sheer perfection.  Super friendly service as well.
Food might have been good, however they were out of rice, Guacamole, and oh ya, CARNE ASADA.
I love this place. A true hidden gem!!!!
Pretty nice bar area -- its quiet enough to just chill. \n\nSeemed like the older crowd likes this bar better though so if you're in your 20's, you will feel out of place :P
the fish and chips was some of the best i have ever had and the drinks were pretty good. i recomend this over the actual resturaunt.
Great gym. VERY HONEST \nGreat teachers very friendly \nAnd great kids program \nLose weight get in shape and kick some butt
Food quality was very disappointing. Our medium rare steaks came out very well done, and the chicken tasted like cardboard. There are many better choices out there.\n\nOn the plus side, the mojitos were great.
I fell in LOVE with this place so much that I went back the next day to try more food and cocktails!\nI LOVE the pretzels they serve with cocktails and the cucumber gimlets are amazing!
i dont know if the management changed again?  the place smells of cleaning supply when you enter. the buffet is horrible. its almost like the dishes are fightng for the worst tasting food competition.
CLOSED - Sadly Cafe Krishna's service went down hill in the last few months and they have now closed.  Hopefully the replacement will be as good as Krishna was before the change in staff.
Not a whole lot of ambiance going on which I was used to at Box.  A very medical office type environment but the staff is really friendly.  Love the Australian wax for its gentleness on my skin but wasn't thrilled with the results.  Wasn't as thorough as other waxes.
Have been going to Bitz-ee Mama's for years. Only for breakfast, but now will be back again. Posole is my fav the portion was enormous! Will probably ask for additional fixings next time.
Great selection of toppings and yogurt! Super clean friendly atmosphere the only place I will get yogurt from.  Do yourself a favor and go get some!
Par experience considering it was a Denny's in a casino. The pancake puppies were to DIE for though. Definitely try them while you can. the wait service was decent and the food, well it's a Denny's...
Terrible food and service.
Growing up just outside of LA, I know good mexican food. This joint is solid, from the salsa, dollar tacos, to the killer burritos. You just gotta ask for cheese and avocado in yours!
My husband loves this place.Their food is delicious and very affordable. Whenever we get a craving for Mexican food we come here :-)
I have only had the pizza here.  Did not impress me, just fair to average pizza.  I have no plans to try it again.
Started out with She Crab Soup, it was excellent should of had a bowl instead of a cup. Fish tacos where great. Will come back again for dinner.
The shrimp and grit here is great! The menu is a bit more expensive than similar style restaurants, but they do provide good food. It's a very laid back and wonderful atmosphere for personal or group dining. Would definitely come back if I'm in the area again.
Great quick lunch. Never had anything bad here. Side note the fries look burnt but are great.
Friendly staff. Great quality items at a steal!
Diner food done at a typical diner level.
First time trying.... Awesome coffee but even better service. Jordan hooked it up big time. I'm coming back for more!!!! What an awesome guy. 5 stars for sure....
Their always so friendly and happy to see everyone,  love it here,  drinks are always delicious. I recommend the iced cocomo!
Typically a nickel to seven cents cheaper than the national average and a better than average store. Always congested and on a very busy corner, but worth the stop just in gas savings.
I'm sitting in here right now trying to work and they are blasting Glenn Beck super loud. Ay yi yi. Time to leave.
This place is always packed whenever I come here.  It's good, typical do-it-youself yogurt stand.  Nice staff.  I like that they have games here, it makes for a fun night out with the family.
OMB best place for relaxing after work. Copper is the best beer I've ever had.
Service is slow, drinks are nothing to write home about.  I wanted this place to be so much more but it fell short.  \n\nI always want to try to try out coffee and drinks from other locations besides Starbucks, but it seems this place is just missing the mark.
I don't know about $8 lobster, but $33 lobster split 2 ways was phenom! We had surf and turf at $25 each. Top notch. Next time maybe the Duck.
All I can say is DELICIOUS! From their Pho, to the fried rice, to their rice plates.  Everything is just delicious.  If you don't believe me, see for yourself.
The ph\u00f2 is so good! The decor and feel of the restaurant was nice too. Servers were friendly. It was a nice experience for my first time here :)
Hole in the wall with mediocre food would not go back!
This place as accommodated big parties and small get togethers with friends. The food is cheap but tastes great. Service has been very good
got two chocolate croissants and 1 mini cake..  \n\nIf i'm paying 2-3 dollar for a croissants at least enough chocolate for taste.
The worst sushi and bad service super rude\nOn the sushi it's 99% rice and 1% fish \nVery old fish , bad flavors
Their regular customers are not very friendly if you are not a packers fan. We had great service from our waitress. This place is perfect for a Green Bay packers fan. Their wings were good.
Great Spot. Good Sandwiches and sides. Awesome beer selection. One of my favorites in Queen City
This in my opinion is the best gourmet food in all of Vegas!  The menu is ever changing and the drinks outta of this world.. Hidden gem. I had the short rib  gorgonzola polenta it was amazing.
Very good food - Also try Brownstone Pinot Grigio - Great friendly service
Good breakfast joint. They have all the basics plus the catchy protein pancake. It is good but I'd like fresh blueberries in it, not the canned kind like when you make blueberry muffins.
Tasty food, juicy dumplings. Service is less than average. \n\nTake out frozen dumplings also cook well. (just don't thaw before cooking.)
Soup watery. Food mediocre. Salad was pure vinegar.
A great place for lunch. The \"Penne Primo\" is super tasty and the bread/dip is also yummy. The service is always friendly. At around $6 a plate, how can I not be a Big Fan!
Great condo unit....really worth the time spent here...
This Johnny Rockets is better than the rest.  Even other Johnny Rockets.  Customer Service went above and beyond what we expected.  The Manager was extremely helpful.  They did nothing wrong, but acted like they did.  We would definitely return.  Food was excellent.  Shakes were great!
What a wonderful experience! I have been jumping from dentist to dentist for the last 5 years. I am happy to say I have found a place to stay!
I love going to this location because it's on my way back to Arizona and the staff is always friendly. Never had an issue with an order at this one. They never rush you. I like mine a special way and most get it right
All you can eat korean bbq ! love the selections and the old lady is super nice everytime we come here =]
Good prices, great service, great food.  If you want Korean and don't want the ambiance of Mothers, or the nastiness of Korean Garden, come here.
When i'm in Vegas for work, i often go to Sura BBQ. It's a very big place and their food is decent. Will be back in few months.
Great, loved it! Has a good selection of Korean food. Sushi is average though. Great service.
Absolutely great!!  Food is delicious and everyone is friendly. Whether it's lunch or dinner they have a great selection. Best Korean BBQ place and been to in Vegas and the best price
First time. Staff is nice. Typical bar and typical Charlotte food aka crap. But if you were born in the south you may like it. North people stay away
good drink specials. the riff raff seems to come out about 10:30-11 o'clock.
Whats up with this Staind wanna be band on Paddys Day? They arent good for the crowd
Yuck!!
Went here for dinner. Place was empty. Table was sticky. Soda was not carbonated. Food took over 30 minutes to be served and everything ordered was only sandwiches and a burger. The waitress was nice but nothing else about the food was worth a second visit.
Couldn't even get through to make a reservation. A brief hold is not 6+ minutes. Not getting my business.
Very average. Food was overdone and waitress stopped chomping her gum only long enough to take our order.
Nothing special here. Food was average at best. The wings were okay, how can you screw up wings???
I love the food here omg and 12.45 for 3 well vodka coke drinks!?!? Yummy!  We had a blonde servee...marcia...merc....something... but she was nice :)
Sushi was alright not the best i've tasted but good enough.
This is a colorful place.  The Gyro is the best!  The atmosphere is a TV playing Directv's greek channel very loud and old greek men playing dominos.  The restaurant is a dive; but, the food is always good.
Pretty good yogurt and toppings.  Always clean and staff is pleasant.
Good yogurt! Very clean establishment and fair prices. The quality of the product is good. The flavor is great. Three of us ate there for just about $11 which isn't bad.
Grainy and soft\nShould serve with a straw
As far as subs go this place is hands down a winner over the 5$ FT LNG place! Sandwiches are great.
This bridal boutique was great!!! Our bridal consultant Jessica  was so sweet and helpful.  Their dress selection was amazing and the prices were reasonable. I highly recommend finding your dream dress here.
Yuck! The teriyaki chicken did not look or taste like chicken. The price for the portion size was too damn high.
Lime service is on point, but vodka OJ's have to be approved by management. Rules are rules though...
It is bad in every way possible. We called and asked if they were busy and they hung up,  VERY expensive for low quality food, half the orders came out after everyone else was done eating, the salad was literally half a cup of chopped lettuce...
Wow, what a great Mexican place! The most amazing collection of sauces I've ever seen. Their homemade sauce was enough though, the food is very tasty, and the price is certainly right. Fish tacos FTW!
I got Terrible's diarrhea the next day. Small selection of dishes.
Great food!!! The French dip is to die for!! Great Service! Clean and fancy especially for the area it's located in!  Def a hidden gem! My husband and I both love going here and can't wait until next time.
If you have a choice, go to the one downtown. I always get the buffalo shrimp, but at this Majerle's the coating was too thick. Not to mention, our ice tea tasted like dirt and service was horrible.
Great steak sandwich and the fries have a great taste without any sauce. My wife had Mamas burger, the bun and mushrooms were great tasting, but the meat lacks flavor. We will give this place another try.
BEWARE- I had dinner there a few nights ago and they increased the amount of the tip on my credit card.  I like their food, but I will never go there again if I cannot trust that they are an honest business. Shame!
Great big Tostones, very nice hot sauce and mojo! Everyone at my table (two who had never had Cuban food) all cleaned their plates :)
Very good authentic Cuban food. Wish the place was a bit busier as I would like to see them succeed. We had a marvelous meal and the waitress was very helpful. We will go back as it is on our minds constantly.
My wife just got a haircut at this place and she seems to be pretty happy with her experience. Full marks for the ambience. The stylist name was Nathan and he seemed to be friendly and did a great job. Will be going there again. I strongly recommend R Salon.
Honk!  What a difference of opinion from the reviews read before patronizing this salon.   No one wants to go into a salon and come out looking ten years older sporting a style that is tired and not becoming.  Not a fan of the product or the attitude; won't be returning.
It was very delicious and tastey.
The Rigatoni Bolognese is amazing! It's my favorite dish is in this place. (Meant to post in 2012. Way delayed post.)
This place has got to be the slowest Burger King on earth. It also doesn't help when someone in front of you orders $36 worth of food.
If going through the drivethrough I would check your order before leaving. THIS BK CANT GET ANYTHING RIGHT!
Door guys are pretty sexy ; )
My favorite friend chicken.  I have not yet been to their new location but  their food is SO good.  can't wait to visit again.
I don't get it? Is this supposed to be delicious soul food? Its a crap piece of chicken and a crap waffle on a plate for 8 bucks. The water is from the tap. I expected delicious, I got below average at best. Back to the real restaurants for me.
Delicious chicken and even better waffles. The sweet tea is great but sometimes it can be too sweet. Give this place a try!
The food and the service are the best! Seriously, the nicest wait staff & the best damn food you'll ever have. They also happen to play my life's soundtrack. Best music ever.
Great fried chicken. Don't plan on doing anything after though because it will give you a serious case of the idis.
Lo-Lo's is the ultimate chicken and waffle spot..not only is the food good but the atmosphere is always upbeat..as you watch TV and listen to some music that will make you want to eat
Nothing special. I've had better chicken, fried okra was not crispy, corn bread ok I guess, Waffle House waffles are better. But the fried chicken gizzards were excellent.
Terrible location. Just a couple girls gossiping about their crappy relationships. Totally inattentive  and irritating. Store looked in a disarray. I WILL NOT spend my money here. They didn't even acknowledge my presence.
A friend and I decided to check this place out on Saturday afternoon, and all of the doors were locked. We were really excited to check it out! I'm not sure if it's even open for business. If it is, they need some store hours posted outside.
This place is amazing I love their pho dac biet and the rice dice with grilled pork and fried eggs on top.
Delicious Pho and summer rolls. Have also had it to go which is nice. Service could he a bit friendlier. Great Thai iced read and iced coffee!! Parking can be a bit tricky but there is extra parking around back!
This is the BEST breakfast in all of Pittsburgh.  Service is always good.  Seating is limited but it's worth the wait if you find a line.
This was a horrible experience.  I have a pretty simple hair cut, but they didn't take any interest in noticing and chopped it way too short.\n\nDon't waste your time or money here.
Fri & Sats- Latin Vibes Club 1130p-4am. Great Spot if you like Dancing, Latinas & Latin vibes.
Food is okay but a Lil overpriced.  How do you go from 6.99 sandwich to adding $5 more for fries and a drink?  I could've got a crispy chicken sandwich from jack in the box and still be satisfied.
We stopped in for breakfast.  The prices were high for very marginal food....frozen potatoes that weren't even served warm.  Food didn't seem very fresh either.  Left with that heavy, ugh feeling.
I had a great time here. Lost my money on a Ladybug penny machine and had some drinks. If you like casinos you will like it if you don't like them then you won't like it. The place is beautiful and overlooks the water.
Cheap prices but nasty food.
this place is awesome lobster roll is great just wish itwas bigger the shrimp n chips amazzzzing
Teakwoods \"touch em all\" is the best burger ever! Terrific wings too.
Short review here.\n\nHalf price rolls on Wednesday. Yes!\nWere they good? Yes!\nWould I return? Yes!
Ordered for delivery and it took over TWO HOURS to get the food, which was cold AND not what I ordered.  A trifecta of incompetence. Don't do business here.
So much for that groupon. Tried to go there today only to find the doors closed and tables gone.
Terrible chicken was old texture was odd and the food smelt foul!\nGROSS!!!!!
Was very disappointed. We have frequented this restaurant before and decided to go for date night. Food came out way to fast and tasted like it was from old supply. Chicken was rubbery,meatballs not done,bacon dates tasted mushy. So sad we will not be coming back.
Had some \"Arizona pin stripes\" on my black 4Runner. Contacted Gannon Detail to see if the scratches could be buffed out. I posted the amazing pictures! The exterior looks amazing and we are so happy!
Store closed its doors on tax day, 04/15/13 along with the location on East Blvd in Charlotte :(
There pizza is average. The customer service us sub-par and if you enjoy ranch or any extras bring your piggy bank.
Mediocre pizza.\n\nOrdered pizza for the Super Bowl and they only had half our order ready 40 minutes later. Pretty much ruined our party. We'll get our pizza from some place more reliable next time.
Enjoyed my birthday dinner here this year outside in the patio area!..  The family loved it and it was a nice cozy way to enjoy spending the evening together mixed with great food, all in all a wonderful way to celebrate.
This can company is ok. The service isn't great but I do like that they do a lot of work in sustainability.
Cockroaches at this food establishment. \n\nNot eating here again.
Staff was great...food was average at best.  Not much more to say...
Looks MUCH better inside than out.  Fast, delicious food at a great value.  Could have spent the day just enjoying the soup that came with the lunch special.
We stopped for a glass of wine and a beer. I enjoyed smoking a cigar on the patio. The staff was friendly.  But service was slow and prices were high.
Disgusting food! Tastes like frozen food that was reheated.. Only thing good were the chips. Will not return!
IF they get your order right your lucky. If it is right most of the time the burgers are made wrong.\nNot worth the stop at all.
If you are thinking about going here because someone told you it's like Chipotle but better... they lied!! We went at about 8pm the meat looked old, they charge extra for peppers... The freshness you would get from Chipotle was lacking.
I love the Olive Garden no matter what state I travel to.  I have found their food to be very good and very affordable.  The breadsticks and salad are always my favorite part, I have to try to stop before my meal comes or I am not hungry and just have to take it home.
Alway a very good lunch...make sure to try the chicken lemon rice soup that is complimentary with every meal!  Opa!
This place sucks!! Staff was rude. Rooms look like army barracks. We came for the ambiance and hospitality but were greeted with terrible service and poor attitudes!!\n\nWould not recommend!
This place was probably the worst service I have ever had. Everything I ordered came out wrong, and the girl that took my order was super rude. I will for sure not be going back to this location.
Just got out of work, decided I'd go to Carl's. I order my food and its descent. But what really made me give the place two stars would be the service. It was horrible. Never coming back to this location.
We love coming in two movies for the whole family for what it costs for a single ticket at AMC or Edwards.  The food is also reasonably priced not a gouge like the aforementioned chain theaters.  Do yourself a favor go see all you movies here !!
No reason to waste a meal here if you're visiting Montreal for a few days. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't all that good. The place was filled with tourists (myself included) and the service was understandably indifferent. Felt like a wasted 2 hours.
Fantastic food, service and surroundings and lived up to eggspectations \nEggcellent value for money.
Can't express how tasty and unique the food is here. Had the pulled pork arepa, unbelievable.
Quiet and subdued spot for breakfast, although the vibe was hurry up and finish. Check arrived unbidden, plates removed at the earliest moment. They should invest in tea cozies to keep it hot for the second cup.
Trying too hard to be upscale, with none of the effort you would expect to accompany such high prices and professional demeanor. I don't mind paying more for quality, but the only thing that was 5 star was the view and the price.
Over priced! Terrible service! Not worth the trip- go somewhere else...
Todd was a terrible bartender and ignored us the entire time we were at the bar.  He seemed to be very friendly to everyone else but walked by us each time.
Johnny B was our waiter and he was great!!!  Same for the manager.  Had a great time with great service!!!!
Real third wave coffee. Nice shop, excellent beans, and disgusting bathrooms, just like any good coffee shop :-)
Not too bad for brunch.\nIt was good, but not AMAZING good.\nInteresting interior decoration.
Not worth the money. Food isn't great. Service is alright. Can get more bang for you buck else where.
I didn't eat here, just walked in and tried to sit down at lunch time. The people were nasty so we walked out. Plus there's a $50 minimum per person. Gotta give it to 'em - they went all the way with the ridiculous minimum.
The atmosphere is excellent if you're into sports.  But the food and service need much improvement.
A Vegas must!  TV's everywhere, stadium seating and great food!  We LOVE our \"Texas connection\" bartender Daina. She is such a sweetheart and will make sure you have a great experience.  Without question the best sports book on the strip.
Good place to watch a game.  You need to make a reservation. Most tables have there own television, but there are tv clusters. It's nice to watch a game in the outdoor area by the strip. I thought the food was good. It's good bar food.
Poor beer selection for a sports bar. No drink menu. Food is just so-so. Would easily say the food is not up to emerils standard. Worse than your typical bar food.
The Flame is No longer burning. This Vintage, Iconic Steakhouse has closed its doors     for good in September of 2014.\n\nConstruction has begun on a new place. So Sad.
I'm so sad to say they are no longer here.   Not sure if they moved or went out of business but their equipment is torn out.  :(
Love this place. I drive all the way from Cave Creek just so my puppy can eat all natural. Thanks for not having sugar in your treats. Good puppy heres some sugar. Not anymore Thanks again. Dakotas fav's Stella & Chewy's duck treats.
The drinks are good, and service is spot on when the place isn't super crowded. The music can be hit or miss. Sometimes it's awesome, and sometimes not. All in all an okay place.
Pei Wei has a great selection of Asian cuisine, select from various meats, including shrimp, and your choice of brown/white rice or noodles.  Their latest offering the Japanese Beef Chile Ramen is a great new addition to the varieties offered and another sign of their commitment to quality food.
Who.\n\nWho.\n\nWho hasn't been yet, and why?
Cafe has new owners that are very nice as well as the staff.  We ordered burgers, fries, salads, and grilled ham and cheese sandwich.  All were delicious!
I hate how they just stand around and let you bag your own stuff, even when they're not actually DOING anything!
Of course I love the clothes ... but how can I avoid the mean associates that work here?  I wish I could try one clothes and purchase them without interacting with them. Ha!
Sub Par for a Westin restaurant, breakfast buffet was free which was the correct price.
They didn't get the right cigarettes I ordered & for the delivery fee it was quite frustrating but they did get here fast
Beer specials are great....   $1.99 pints.   Chips are great and portions are large.   The sopa de pollo (chicken soup)  is excellent.  Great place for all the road warriors in the two Hilton properties down the street.
3 strikes and you are out.  I've now given this place 3 tries.  Not going back again.  The service was not good and the food was only mediocre at best.
The food was so delicious! We ordered 5 pasta dishes and I large pizza! The service was even better! We all left full and happy and don't leave without trying the gelato.
I love this place and look forward to grocery shopping here whenever I can.  Things I like:   Their prices, the produce, all of their Fresh and Easy brand products and other things I'm used to and love.   Great quality products that I love at the prices that I love.
I love going to this place they have good drinks, good music, tons of parking and a overall good vibe. If you are looking for a place to do a little dancing, drinking and mingling come here.
Son said his Mochi was hard. Hubby and I thought this place isn't as good as yogurtland as far as flavors and quality.
This location has had no hot tea other than \"passion fruit\" for the past two weeks. They claim they are switching to a different brand, but every other location I visit has what I want. This is just the one closest to my house.  This seems to be poorly managed.
We just left after 3 lovely nights! So so happy! The perfect size, amazing location, scrumptious breakfast, stylish decor. We will be back! The street is \"the\" place to be in vieux Montreal!
Love this gym. Always clean, never super crowded, awesome staff. Never had any problems here. If you want to talk to an awesome manager, ask for Kevin. Awesome dude.
This 24 Hour location is really busy and the equipment is worn out. I did not like this particular 24 Hour.
So far I have only had the frozen custard...The Pecan turtle concoction to be exact, I would eat 10 if I didnt think my husband would judge me. \n\nWe plan to go back and try the burgers!
Try the colbyjack burger. Greasy Yummy. Fries is ok.
Sushi Combo B. Solid choice and value for lunch.
It was better than expected. The Upper and Lower Manhattan rolls were great. Fresh tasty and excellent service too. Glad I found Room 112 on Yelp.
My son and I had lunch here today, we had the Manhattan pizza. Flavor was good but nothing special. Above average for a little neighborhood pizza place. \nService was also a little better than expected. The guy behind the counter was very polite and attentive.
I need to update my previous review. Not sure what happened, but they've gone downhill. It's like a different place. They went from being awesome to unreliable.
Awesome, authentic Mexican cuisine.  Great service and $1 beers, what could be better.
Small local restaurant, but cheap price, good food, and lovely owner sing a song for you.
Boring menu average food
The staff worked with me regarding my son's food allergies. We had an awesome time eating dinner. Great atmosphere!
Not bad. A little pricey but what do you expect, rent there is probably a bazillion dollars. The Chai was OK but the Granita looked like shaved ice after a few sips.
Excellent Thai food and service.  Papya Salad, Silver Noodle Salad, Crab Fried Rice, Koaw Mun Gai.  Highly recommended!
Greatest burgers in the world!! Not expensive either. I could eat eat here everyday!
It doesn't get any better unless you go to a gastropub and get a burger. \n\nThis place truly does cook what the customer wants. The secret menu has some creative and amazing eats. Well done fries are my latest favorite.
Stopped in here for a few drinks on a Friday night at about 11:30, it was pretty dead considering it was a weekend. Cover charge was outrageous. I don't think we'll be going back.
Dharma Lounge is the perfect size venue with a very loungy feel which is refreshing in Charlotte over saturated market.
The best thing about this salon is the stylist Tayla Hart. She is amazing with color and cuts. I go in looking like crap and come out looking like a million bucks. I will never go to another stylist!
Great atmosphere, food was good, however, the prices were really high for what you got.
It was ok... Nothing great. It did the job. On 3rd floor of quad...24 hrs i think.
This is really cool. It's a nice lil' hike and adventure to take when visiting the viewpoints and natural history of the Phoenix area. \n\nBest to visit at sunset!
The buns are awesome. That's something I notice different about the burgers. The Wheat buns are amazing as well.
Great ambience, and the Black Scorpion drink is a must!
Great atmosphere and really yummy food. If you want drinks, go during happy hour; for food go during dinner.\n\nIn the dead of summer the flies are not a problem, mostly because the doors are closed.
Great food Horrible service.
Very enjoyable atmosphere and staff. Had the ribs with very good sauce while not swamped on it. Great taste and seasoning. Beans and rice where pretty decent will go back in the future. The muay Thais are great with just the right combination
Great meat fish market...clean and friendly service!
i love this place!!!!!!!
Delicious night out. The space is large, contemporary and edgy. The calamari was crispy but not greasy and the pasta was rich and authentic. The down side was their salmon was dry & over salted.
Bill Cleveland was great at solving my issues and following up to make sure I was satisfied with the service.
Service crew is very slow.
Decided to try this salon based on the reviews, Angel did my pedicure and she is fabulous I will defiantly be back to see her! My nails look great also I love the selection of color gel they have. Overall nice salon and believe me I'm extremely picky
Not sure what place all the reviewers are writing about ..... This place was horrible!!!! How does an Irish food place have awful Corned Beef and Cabbage???? Fish and chips were equally bad as well. Had to go to Jersey Mikes after.
Was ok- not great. Nothing unique or special.
I like to call and order a cali roll to go when I am busy running errands and shopping, it is inexpensive, they make a cool cali roll, and they are nice and fast.
our favorites are the miso soup, mermaid and baked lobster roll! I take my kids here often, we love it!  The atmosphere is nice, the kids enjoy sitting and watching them make the rolls.  The lunch specials are very affordable the customer service is great.  very clean too!
ruined a very expensive dress and when  had to reimburse me for it...pushed back. This was in in DC Ranch. DO NOT USE IN MY OPINION.
Been going here forever. Today they lost a string to my maternity shirt. Really disappointed. Time to change dry cleaners.
If you want wine and have no idea what you're doing, ask for help. They truely know their stuff. All recommendations have been great!  They have wine classes and my favorite beer The Optimator!  Coupons sometimes in newspaper or online.
Ugh the rudest cashier never spoke a word not even a hello she thru my stuff into the bags and just stuffed it with anything and everything. Ruth your a rude person
if you want a cheap hotel, go to excalibur, tropicana is declining big time, I stayed here a couple of years ago and it was adequate, I went last week and now it's supergross.com.
Half of my kalbi was cold and the solution to the problem was to order more and get I would get a little extra? No thank you. Portions are even smaller when ordered to go as well. What happened to this place?
The breakfast burrito was okay and for this reason I felt it was overpriced. The location next to Ice Den and the operating hours are really great. The staff are friendly and the service was fast.
Sulky customer service every time I've been here. They also skimp on the portions compared to other Milio's locations in Madison.
Cute store! Lots of nostalgia to look at. Would have loved to have bought the red ropes but they were near the front window & hard as rocks. Same for some of the taffy I bought. Prices seemed reasonable.
Food was semi ok and they didn't refresh the trays of food as often as they should've but I guess for the cheap price that's the quality you get
It's in the name, Fat. Don't expect something healthy. It'll satisfy your hunger.\n\nGood enough for me to come back if convenient.
broth is too salty.  beef in pho not always fresh.  spring rolls are not very fresh. i've eaten here 10xs. go to tea light if u live in north phoenix.  i've given up on this place.
Some of the best pho in town. Stumbled upon this place based on a recommendation and have found few places that have better pho. Staff is always very welcoming. Highly recommended.
Very nice little restaurant in cave creek area.  Family run restaurant.  Very Nice and polite owners.  I really like the pho there.  Thats what I get every time I go there.
I like this place because it's cheap.\n\nThe food isn't outstanding, but it's tasty enough.\n\nWe go fairly regularly because it's easy.\n\nI'd recommend it.
Service was slow and the bagel sandwhiches were lacking.  Plus they did not have any of the special that they were advertising.
So yummy! Great staff and awesome authentic mexican food! It's off the strip and well worth the drive.
I'm in town for an hour saw this place on line before we left Angel Fire.  Chef John Murphy is outstanding not only regarding the meal but in regards to excellent customer service as well. Enjoyed it immensity and will be back later this week. Thanks John! !!!
Took my boyfriend here for his birthday dinner. Outstanding service and the food was on point!
Service is the word or lack of it.  WOW!
This place is horrible! One of the employees crashed my car and rather than having them fix the problem they refuse to answer my call!!  Don't attend the phoenix (7st) location.
They have always treated me well. I will review the car and have them touch up some issues . The staff is friendly.  I have never had to worry about honesty . They will buff things out if needed.
Fair price, privately owned with friendly service and they actually know what they are doing. This is a really good alternative to the chains.
Sent my wife here once. Even though I I had followed her home the day before and checked to make sure all her lights were working front and back these guys seem to find two lights out? Keep in mind this was three years ago but never forgot it and now you know.
I first contacted Liz after another accountant botched my 2008 taxes and got me in seemingly deep trouble with the IRS. Liz went through line by line and corrected the errors, then wrote a clear and thoughtful letter to the IRS explaining the honest mistake. Highly recommended.
Fuck you yelp for removing my review BI\nTCH harbor island apartment suck ass crack with a sick dick
Takes forever for pizza to bake. Double dough is super flimsy. Pan pizza has so much dough! Love the cheese they use, but makes for a puddle of grease. Too spendy to frequent.
Rosati's was my go to while in Kansas City so i was glad to have one close that delivers. The pan and double dough are my favorite as well as the calzone and a decent salad.
Great place for drinks and happy hour.
The food is great ..we had curry chicken . sesame chicken and tempura shrimp .hot and sour soup .all of  the food was great ...
I'm sorry, but this is not a Pad Thai, the food was awful... the service.. nobody checked on us, I have to look for somebody to bring me the bill. Never ever back here!!!
Beautiful restaurant in the Ritz Carlton. Had hamburger & fries. Attending business conference at the Ritz.
This is me and my friends favorite spots after a night out! I love there salsa bar! There tacos, burritos, and sopes are on POINT!!
Overpriced and under-fun. This was more trouble than it was worth and the \"crime scenes\" were G-rated and boring. Probably OK for kids, but if you're over 12, skip it.
Had issues over parking. I went in to discuss them with the owner and found him to be most unfriendly. I will won't be eating here and would encourage others to stay away also.
The service was outstanding. The food not so. My \"firecracker\" (wontons fried with fillings) were so overcooked they were hard and like rubber, the burn taste ruined the meal. Good service and great coffee but I will stick with Macaroni Grill.
great eats, even if you don't get the all you can eat spaghetti. Had the arugula and white bean salad plus two penne pasta dishes. Both very good. Good Italian food in a nice atmosphere at decent prices with good waitstaff.
I love this place! Great prices and even better food. I try something different every time and am never disappointed.
I love the location, it is very \"little main street\" feeling. The food is good and priced very well. The service is slow, so i would not come here if you are in a rush.
My friends and I saw this show last week and I thought it was thoroughly entertaining.  They sang many classics and added a personal touch by including  their love of singing Motown as teenagers.  It was a great show.
Really want to like this place. Have been here a few times and the food was just never very good and portions were small...especially for the price. Save your money and your tastebuds...go somewhere else.
As far as salon-cafes go, this has got to be one of the better ones.  The sandwiches, while not particularly ground breaking, are thoughtful and assembled with quality components.  Also has a pretty good old-town ambiance.
Good food, lots to pick from on buffet.  Great for the kids.
Best brunch in Madison and spectacular Bloody Marys. Lunch and dinner fare is tasty. Love the atmosphere, large number of big screens, and big beer selection.
I came here for a staycation and couldn't be happier. The room is fabulous and the hotel exceeds my expectations.  Food court is a hot mess. Eat before you get here.
Bailey is great!  Gave me exactly what I wanted and and was very knowledgeable. Great experience!
Last two visits, very poor, rude service.  Very disappointing.  I will not be back for a long time, need to get the bad taste out of my mouth.
Well lit, clean, courteous help, great looking produce, organized, well maintained, and the marinated bulgogi and sides taste great.  Will be returning soon!
Caramel frap and hot chocolate were good but very disappointed in vanilla cappuccino half of the cup is foam and not a lot of vanilla.
Chicken kabobs were tasty, however the spinach wraps clearly tasted of freezer funk, so I ordered the orzo soup and hummus instead. The hummus was great but my soup had about three grains of orzo in it!! Won't be coming back.
searched this place before we go.went to this place with a friend.the food was ok service was ok,the place is ekkkkkkkkk... I would not go back again !!!
Customers are good. That's all.
good customer service but overpriced low quality sushi.
Wide, comfortable, reclining chairs perfect for cuddling and watching a movie?  Yes please!  So worth the extra $3 it costs over Harkins.
They took off my original review because I told the truth they did a horrible job and took forever and still didn't get the order right. Sad Mexican food.
Not impressed with my last visit. Pizza was not good and service wasn't either.
Decent coffee for what's located in a hotel that was off the strip. Without driving off to get Starbucks, this place is definitely liveable when you walk your butt down the elevators after a drunk night or a night of betting.
Carbonated Solutions of Las Vegas cleaned my moderately soiled area rug in their plant and it looks like brand new!  These guys did an amazing job.  They were on time for pick up and delivery.  I would definitely use them again.
kokomos ROCKS !!! This place is so clean and all their toppings are sooo fresh.. We go there 2x per week and love to see the place packed all the time.. Glad u r in town !!!
Worst Starbucks ever. Long lines and ineffective staff. Sub par baked goods. I guess they feel they can get away with bad service because the convenience of being located in the hotel. That's a shame.
decent mexican food at reasonable prices.. would not be my first choice for mexican..
Deliciously flavorful juicy burgers and fries!  My boyfriend says its one of the BEST Italian beefs he has ever had.  I would like to see more on the menu, but it is a good thing that they stick to what they do best BEEF!
Excellent beef sandwiches a little to juicy but very good Chicago style Italian beef. Fries are good with there dipping sauce. Hot dogs are very good too. The cute girls aren't bad to look at either. I would share my hot dog with them and share my fries.
Their veggie burger is absolutely delicious and the staff is super friendly !
Great taste I got the bacon burger it was amazing the place was clean and staff was friendly as for the price can't complain we will absolutely be coming back
A true gem for PHX and the west valley area. The owner provides an intimate experience and isn't afraid to offer insight on the best way to partake of the dishes. All the food was absolutely fantastic!
Food was fair, heavy on the sauce on our dishes and even the kids didn't like their noodles. Service was good, for the quality it was expensive.
Yuck.....why are their food cold?  Not 1, not 2 but 6 of us......\n\nI hope the one their are opening at LAX will be better than this one.
This place is overrated. Service was horrible, food was cold. Would rather have boiled hotdogs. Stay away!
had a groupon and now kind of wish i didn't was hoping for a good dog but ended up with an upset belly
Food is unimpressive.\n\nDrinks however.. try the lemonade or the margarita (both with alcohol) and you will not regret it!
Hits the spot. Four stars for salty fries and polish dog. Location in LA better though...
We had a groupon for Jell-o Shots at Pink's. We had green apple, blueberry, & grape. We took them outside on the nice little patio area to people watch. The Jello-o shots were really good, and the outside seating is always a plus.
It ok not worth all the hype. No space look kind of dirty in the kitchen will never want to eat there again .
i oredered take out the other night, and they forgot to include the ranch and celery. Thanksfully i had some at home, but it's not the point. Over the years, BWW has gone downhill, and this location is no exception.
Just average nothing great you can get the same food in any bar around town except bagels you can get those fresh at smiths if your hungry and have no other choice here's your place
$11 for a washing-machine margarita on the Strip? Rude service, and the bar is chilly and drafty in the winter. Not sure why I got suckered into going here, but never again.
Whatever Mexican food and crappy service.  Go find a million better restaurants on the strip.  They also charge for the chips and salsa.  This place will be gone within the year.
Over priced!  But then again it is the Las Vegas strip!! Cool atmosphere, typical food.
Food was good TexMex fare.  Margarita was one of the worst I'd ever had.  I was totally dumbfounded that their Margaritas could be so bad. Order a beer and you'll be fine.
Seriously underwhelmed.  Great location on the strip but goes downhill fast.  Bad margaritas.  Very bland food.  Overpriced because of the location.  With all the Vegas food options, avoid this place.
My sweetie and I came here for our anniversary.  The management took better care of us than we could have ever dreamed. Staff, food, view... all amazing. Highly recommend! We'll be back again!
What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas  ...unless it's delicious happy hours chicken taquito and mixed (watered down) shots!  The flavor was reminiscent of delicious but the chicken was a bit scorched on either ends.
Great atmosphere.  Hilarious menu text.  This place has real character and fantastic food to match.  The back patio is fabulous.
They have great service! Their cat fish is the best fish in Phoenix. I've gone to Mandy's down the street but it just isn't as good as Marilyn's! I'll be visiting again soon.
Not worth the waiting,\nand they let our girls in first.\nPretentious bastards!
Out of crepes at 310pm on a Saturday.  Ordered a red bean taro delight. \nNothing delightful of taro bits in this awful drink.\nOverrated!\nDon't waste your time or money!
A perfect day we will remember forever. Thank you Vicky and the rest of the staff at Vegas Weddings. I would recommend you anytime
This place has great food. I have never gotten anything that wasn't good. The atmosphere is cozy and inviting. There salsa is so.... Good it goes  in everything. My favorite is a chicken burro juicy yum.
Meat is fatty and service sucks. After the 3rd visit I was through.
Very slow service(50 minute wait).  Did not get us kids menus.   Salad had brown lettuce.  \n\nThis is not a good place to take kids.
The gumbo was GREAT!  I will have to go back to try something else.  I was in a hurry this time around.
Jambalaya was very good.  Crab cakes so- so.  Not bad.  Not great.
They were solid. The po boy was good.
Typical Starbucks, which means I'm a fan.  However, parking is a little bit hectic here, especially on the weekends due to the parking frenzy at Whole Foods, which shares the parking lot.  Nevertheless, friendly staff with smiling faces and your predictable Starbucks coffee quality.
PH Halo Margarita Bar $14 16oz drink. WHAT!\nWalk around the strip, you'll find the exact same thing, more flavor options for $5-$9
Ive been here a couple times. I think the drinks are too expensive for a neighborhood bar. . . Food is decent nothing special but not bad. . . Service is always really friendly if not always prompt and on point.
Good service but horrible garbage food and small portions
First time here, the food was good. Second time here, it was okay. Now, not so much. Doesn't seem fresh. Everything a bit flavorless.\n\nWon't be back.
The frosting is cream cheese.  I hate cream cheese. No where on their display does it say cream cheese frosting.  It's suppose to be buttercream!!!
Three stars sums this place up. Food is average. Bar is average. The massive amount of TVs is average. I could step outside and head to the sportsbook and maybe my drinks would be cheaper there.
This Goldilocks shut down and is no longer in business.
What a unique place to visit!  Alittle touristy, but alot of great spots for photo ops.  There is not much, but the name was so interesting that we had to check it out!
By far the cleanest gas stations ever. No matter where you go, they're all clean, friendly, and even in the middle of the night the safest place to get gas. Too bad their drinks are the most expensive, almost 50 cents more than Circle K.
Worst meal ever. Everything I ordered was bad and it was really expensive. The Latte I ordered was cold and she ended up microwaving it instead of making me a new one. The Tar Tar was gross. Eek! Methinks not.
Line to get a ticket is long, but moves surprisingly fast. I like the method of different tickets for different needs. It expedites the process. Friday is really busy. They have a tv.
Best waiter in years!! Gage was awesome! He is attentive but not stalkerish.  Serves can make or break an experience. If you have Gage you will definitely enjoy the awesome food.
The food here is delicious, you will not be disappointed!
The food was delicious. Got the red curry with beef. Wife got fried rice. We'll be going back.
Really good food!  I was pleasantly surprised!  Do I have a rival to my coveted Thai Spices????  One more visit to decide!
I would agree with most people that this place is pricey but David Johnson the wine and beer guy is very knowledgeable and the staff is friendly. Ask David and he can steer you into some great values on the liquor. They also have very affordable events and carry Arizona wine now-Yeah!
Not a bad choice if you want to change it up. Lots of things with a waffle you probably wouldn't think of. Service is a bit spotty.
Best waffle I've ever had...I made my own with a chocolate waffle, chocolate sauce, caramel sauce, raspberries, cherry pie filling, blueberries, whip cream and powdered sugar.  Pure bliss!
I have eaten here several times. The customer service is amazing and the food is very good. I really enjoy the atmosphere.
Pediped shoes are awesome! I'm going to be sad when my daughter grows out of them. I was so excited when they opened the corporate store. They have a wide selection, which other stores did not. You can even buy online & pick up in the store
The muffins are dry and over-baked. The selection is sparse. And the owners are RUDE. Enough said.
Took over 10 min in the drive thru. ..1st time at this location.   The woman who took my order would not let me finish speaking long enough to get understand my order... get it together DD...
I enjoy the rotating artwork from local artists, beer selection (and beer specials!), and they host a figure drawing class on Mondays.  Certainly one of my favorite bars in Plaza.
Buzzberry may not be the best coffee joint out there but it does the trick and it never hurts to support local. The staff is generally friendly and pretty quick. If you like a large drink make sure you get the \"secret menu\" large.
I really like this place. The service is really good.  The food is awesome. The price is right.  I will be back for sure.
Always quick and affordable! Like most guys, I don't like my eyebrows to look too thin, they do a good job at just cleaning up the areas that get out of control.
They now carry a perfectly servicable New Zealand sauvignon blanc, added some mood lighting, have an excellent happy hour menu and have expanded their bruchetta offerings (try the hummus...it's outrageous). Happiness.
I really enjoyed my evening at fifth and wine. The atmosphere was great and the service was attentive! I would recommend this And would visit again!
Great wine and bruschetta, especially the apple one. Good live music when I went. They need a fire pit outside though! There is not much out there and they need to liven it up some. But great wine bar
Parking free, drinks are doubles, free w/guestlist.  Spanish dancing all night in a classy location!
Located inside Monte Carlo next to Dragon Noodles. They have a Sunday Red Sauce Dinner with 3 course dinner-salad, entree, dessert. It comes with free breadsticks and marinara sauce. The waiter was good on refills. Nice place to eat there for dinner.
Beautiful spot for an afternoon tea. But the tea could be much better. When I asked where it was from they said Canada. Seems strange to get tea from Canada Mandarin can do better. \n\nI love the view its a great spot to have a tea and the finger sandwiches were excellent.
As part of my bachelorette weekend, my friends surprised with a classy afternoon for some tea and a TINY TINY lunch. =]   I wish they would have more scones and the mini sandwiches and less dessert but everything was pretty delicious.
My only complain is if you are going to add 18% gratuity please inform the guest first. I used to be a server I always inform the guest verbally or written on the check. It's really shady especially comes from an international hotel chain.
From my walking around, this was the best value margarita station ($13 half yards with $10 refills) on the main strip and the drinks didnt disappoint.  Lots of different flavors to choose from too.
Wow! This is a hidden gem! I found this place while cycling along the canal early one morning. It is very peaceful and serene. One can take a load off and get lost in the waterfall for hours. I would love to see the waterfall in the evening or at night!
sit by the aquarium!
Guy who did my nails did a horrible job. They looked awful. He seemed to be in a hurry and it showed. Definitely the worst full set I've ever had. This place is always too crowded and loud.
Just quoted me $1,200, over the phone, to install a 36\"x80\" replacement entry door in a condo!
Thought we would try it as it just opened. Food was good if pricey for Mexican (3 tacos $12.95). Extremely noisy. You cannot have a conversation ..just eat and out the door. Don't think I would make a point of going back.
Lindo MIchoacan has received so many BEST OF LAS VEGAS awards and now they have a location in Henderson with an incredible view of the city.  It doesn't get much better than great Mexican food with a view.
Gets three stars because of the service and the view. Both of which are great. The prices are way too high for the quality of the food that you get. I work near East Los and this place would shut down after two weeks there.
Decent pizza, pretty close in quality to Setabello. Menu has gotten a lot smaller and the price is a little on the high side for pizza. Good service and cozy environment.
I ate here back in December.  I love the pizza and salads here.  Absolutely delicious!!!  Try the one in Brooklyn, NY.
Terrible Prime Rib. But the drinks were good and the French Onion soup was pretty tasty.
Iam a local stayed weekend at Hooters place had great prices took a shot at it been there 4 more time whole family loves it
The chicken was fresh and very tasty first time there but greasy cant make it a habit
We went to BB Kings Blues Club hoping to .....hear blues or jazz.  Instead we watched playoff games.  Yippeee?? THe band started to warm up as we were getting ready to leave. Very disappointed but our waitress was GREAT!!
I received the worst service ever tonight nothing like a moody shift manager with a attitude.NOT A GOOD LOOK FOR YOU MCDONALD'S
I was a bit dubious about a cafe that advertises coffee that doesn't taste like coffee but the espresso was decent. Not awesome but better than Starbucks.
hard to rate a massage place, seeing as they definitely make you feel better than when you came in. it should be \"yes\" or \"no\" rating. whatever the case, the mo membership is worth it.
Their dumplings are great. But everything else tastes like something you could find in the freezer section at the grocery store. Not to mention we waited over 30 minutes for our to-go order. I would understand if it was really busy or something but we were the only ones there.
Have eaten here at least 4 times and the food was poor every time.
Walked in as a whim. Was convinced to pay 4$ more for polish that would \" last longer - at least a week\" not only did my nails chip that night, she cut me so badly i was bleeding.
Love Ruby!  I actually remember going to the old location as a kid - and how great it was then.  Same quality and service today.\n\nFUN TIP:  Make sure to check out the water fountain, too.  See if you can get it to work.  Pretty cool.
I went into Transformations for a consultation & the experience was horrible. The facility is gorgeous but the people, especially Dr. Afifi, were unkind, impatient, & had very little knowledge  of the procedure I was interested in or any people skills. Do not use this clinic!
The staff seems to enjoy talking to each other rather then help customers.  The place seems more like a Chucky Cheese than a really Rockys.  I go out of my and go to the Monona Drive location.  They seem to be the friendliest and best quality.
Best fast food burritos in town. Pancheros doesn't touch this place. Adobe is a close second. Go with the Barbacoa.
It's fair to say I'm a regular here. The service is always fast and efficient with a smile. My favorite is a Chicken bowl. It is always tasty. I sometimes get chips with guacamole. Their guacamole is delicious and always fresh.
Food was pretty good. However not a lot of options for the buffet. Service was just ok.
We love Golden Harvest! HUGE delicious portions make busy nights easy. Friendly staff. We've been coming for years and will continue.
Good Chinese food is hard to find. We were pleasantly surprised when we ate here for lunch one day. Will definitely go back.
Showed up to get oil change. One car in garage and two open bays. Informed it will be over 30 minutes before they can even get my car in.
WORST PULLED PORK, EVER!!  Didn't touch it...complained to manager...still for charged.\n\nDecent collards, however.
Eric, owner of Tuning Gruppe is a VW/Audi enthusiast and truly cares about his customers and making sure they are happy.  Eric flashed my car with the GIAC DSG flash and the car has been running great!
Having gone back twice, I can now state that their food is terrible.  The salsa is uneven.  The bean dip is good, but it tears me up inside.  Won't be back.
Overall just not that great.  I got the fajitas and was not impressed.  Service was slow even though they only had about 3 tables to wait on.  I won't be going back - wish there was better Mexican food in Gilbert!
They have great deal on taco Tuesday. It's $1 per taco. I bring all my kids for the night so I don't have to cook. Their salsa bar is pretty good too.
We stopped in for dinner on Friday night.  There was a table open and we waited right at the front door for the host.  We waited and waited.  The two waiters could have easily sat us.  The bartender kept looking over at us and nothing.  I do not recommend this place.
This place is overrated.  It was fine but not at all special, not a single one of the dishes we ordered stuck out to me as being especially good.  Sorry.\n\nConsidering how many great restaurants there are in Vegas, there is no reason to come here.
The food was excellent but it was very expensive for the portion sizes. For three of us at lunch, the bill before tip was $105 & we didn't even have drinks. Service was good too but again I can't justify the price.
Overall great experience. The mixed seafood ceviche was amazing! I wish the portion was a bit larger. I would definitely come back! I also tried the paella which was also delicious.
Love the pizza, reverse happy hour special , especially the wings and pretzels. Beer is obviously the best part
Amore is now closed and the store is cleared out.
the toddy was good, the food not so much. it was pricey and there were a few too many flies buzzing around for my liking.
The store was really good but the restaurant was terrible, the food and the service were awful. I found a hair in my coffee and on my breakfast plate.
It is little pricy but they give you o much meat that it makes up for it.  I have only has the gyros.  The have good food, beer, and wifi great place to go for lunch in between classes at GCC.
Can't comment on the food.  After 20 minutes and no server we left. Too bad my wife and I enjoying new dishes.  Not recommended!
The food was pretty good, but there was a hair in my sandwich. I obviously couldn't finish, I was very disappointed!
We have loved this place for years! I have never had a bad meal. I'm surprised at so many 1* reviews.
Good stuff and pretty cheap too!!!
It's a very close distance to ny my hotel where we were staying. the prices are great. They have gluten free pancakes which is awesome. The food is really good compare to its price range. Nothing fancy but practically good.
Poor service. Waited too long for waitress ( Kim) to take our order.  not happy. Will very likely eat somewhere else next time.
Grrrr\nHated it!\nI love this chain,but hate this location!
Great rolls and bread!
Not very fresh. Rice was hard. Beans crusted over. Taste was ok. Maybe it was a bad nite but the service was also uninspired. With many other burrito options no reason to come here.
Gold's is a nice lounge, but there is something missing from this place that makes it kinda blah over all, but was a nice place to grab a quick drink with friends.
About the worst service you can imagine. Waitresses had no idea about 2 for 1 drink coupons being handed out in the Aria casino. Also, there are few tables but apparently this was too much for wait staff to handle. 3 tv screens were good.
I love this place! I've been coming me for a few years now. They treat you like family here!
Nice facilities. Line guys are awesome, desk staff not so much. Fuel is uber-expensive, but ramp fees aren't too bad if you don't meet minimum fuel requirements to waive the fee.  This is what you get when there's no competitors on the field.
Such good Chinese food. Pleasantly surprised!
Wow. Can't believe this location is closed. I was not aware that it had and tried to stop by to grab some lunch to take back to the office. What a disappointment.
These guys are quick and very sweet. I registered online and at the last minute had to have them come to my work and pick me up. Did not take 15 min! The are the best. I was in and out in time to take my daughter to work. Love Them
Best shrimp fried rice ever. Prices are normal but the food is above avg. I try to make it here 2 times a month.
The service in this place sucks! The waiters are freaking rude! They really need to learn how to behave with customers. Apart from the wings, this place is a hell NO!
Service was good but definitely don't order a bagel especially if you are used to having one at City Deli or Bruegger's.  Ice Cream was yummy.
Food was very good an tasted fresh! The cat fish an shrimp was amazing. I will go back!
This place is now \"Las Americas\" and its Colombian food. It's authentic and the people are nice, but nothing about it really stood out.
Drive through is a plus especially at 550 in the morning. \n\nStaff seems tired and not unfriendly, just not welcoming like other places. Overall a clean store though. But ya... Nothing too special here.
Pizza is very good, and if you go on Wednesdays, they have thier Wacky Wedneday special, Large 1-topping for 5.99.  Free Flavored crust and usually quick service.  The employee even offered us free drinks while we waited in the dining room.
Great balkan style lunch menu!\nExcellent Hummus, fresh salad and vegetables and the chicken skewers were also very well seasoned.. But a little bit dry.\nService was very friendly! :-)
Food lion strip mall Chinese food, also offers deliver. Experience had always been good and food is exactly as you'd expect.
They were worthless when the screen in my galaxy cracked from from dropping it. No help at all
Stopped in on my way to work to grab a coffee & they have 2 cashiers and only 1 guy making the drinks...WTH??!?? Super slow!  This location is not recommended if you are in a hurry!
The food was fine and the service is friendly, if not the most efficient. Not a place I would go out of my way for a return visit, but wouldn't rule it out if someone else suggested it.
Good space. Has all the equipment you need. Only problem is too many personal trainers. Its a public gym, NOT a personal training studio!
I had an inspection and oil change. There was only one guy working alone and he communicated like a cave man. I will not be back.
CLOSED several months ago.  Now another restaurant, named \"Aroma\".
I have been a regular at Malibu for 3 years but was very disappointed with my last visit.  They are under new management and would not honor my gift certificate. Also the smell of burning incense was overwhelming.
Best place! Great service and selection. Also, very competitive and after much of comparison shopping I was back! \nLinas was very friendly and knowledgeable. He is very passionate for what he does and I saw him taking care of customers. \nDefinitely coming back!
The place is now Amor de Brazil, which is a much better place than Phil and Tony's ever was.
As a grocery store....it's ok. What really surprised me is when I went to their meat department looking for knockwurst. The guy in the meat department didn't even know what that was and referred me to Harris Teeter. WTF?????
This place could be excellent but they fail in the small details. First off the staff is not very friendly and we had a bad waitress, very impatient. The food is good but it is hard to lay out good money for an attitude when there is three more great places to eat in Belmont .
Upscale food and wine shopping and lovely patio dining. Attracts out of area patrons for their unique ambiance. Be sure to try it when you're in Belmont.
The barista made my frappuccino really watery and too sweet !!!!!!!! Also the whipped cream is melted ! Target sbux taste way better !
Great little family bakery with great pastry and juices.  The owners are so nice and passionate about what they do.  Can't wait to come back.  Really love their empanadas.
I received a fantastic pedicure here, but my manicure was poorly done. It was rushed. $80 for a deluxe pedi and gel mani. Kinda steep.
The food is reasonablly priced and always comes out hot. We've never had a bad meal.
Way over priced....... The service was terrible..need I go on?
I enjoyed the stromboli. The place was hectic with trivia, but otherwise fine. Would return.
Lost their lease. Closed for business
Big, clean, carries lots of variety. Some is overpriced, the rest is about average.
Expect more for a $10 sandwich. This is next a series of all mediocre reviews. Friendly servers but it needs some creativity in the kitchen and please show the chef where the spice rack is
Checked this place out for the first time.  With the exception of it being very hot inside (had all the doors open no A/C) it was a really for a social area.  We didn't have food, only drinks so I can't comment on the food.
I come here during lunch hours and love it! Friendly service and great food. :)
Decent place, cool atmosphere
The peanut brittle is great.\n\nThe customer service sucks!
Good coffee ... i'm not eating doughnuts or bagels at the moment, so it's hard to rate their signature foods. Ask me again in 40 pounds.
I never thought I'd like poutine, and I certainly don't want to eat it every day, but this stuff was really good. Get it with some bacon or sausage on top. Excellent for teenage boys.
One of the best poutines I have ever had was here. Luckily when I arrived there was hardly a line but the place was packed! Service was quick, however our waitress didn't speak English to us which would be hard for tourists but it was fine with me.
I am an absolute passionate about breakfast food, and do they deliver! Their breakfast food is delicious, as well as their poutines. burgers and shepherds pie!
Pretty good poutine. Cheese curds were a bit too chewy, but otherwise nice. Lots of flavor choices, quite heavy. Definitely preferred Comptoir 21, though.
Nice rooftop deck. They don't have many beers, but some different mix drinks made up for it.
The crepes were too chewy and hard to cut with a knife, the smoothies tasted like artificially sweetened tang and overall the price was way too much for what we ordered. The only reason why this place gets 2 stars was because of the nice staff.
Enjoyed a wonderful lunch at BC today. The food and service was wonderful. My guest who had never been there before could not stop commenting on how great the place was. It's always a joy to introduce people to a hidden gem like this.
Delicious & friendly staff! The baguette used for the sandwich was extremely soft and the potato soup was perfect for today's gloomy weather. Only downside was that the coffee was slightly acidic/sour but that's only a preference. Will def be back for lunch soon
Between the 3 of us, we had sandwiches: the chipotle, the blue Brie and the 3 cheese. All very good, but my favorite is The chipotle sandwich
Best banana pudding in Charlotte!  Servers are friendly and southern, food is very good.  Be sure to ask about the specials, they often source these from King's farmers market.  They are also happy to share their secret ingredients on the banana pudding, salad dressing, etc.
Good priced, but not the best if one is carb conscious
Chips and salsa were good but that's where it ended. Dry meat on my tacos, my wife had a really bad salad. Chicken coated with sauce that was more like Italian sauce than anything Mexican.
Always great to be back. It's a lot like eating at a Moroccan friend's house with a kick ass personal chef.
Overpriced\nI don't recommend, it first the music wasn't good, the drinks were overly overpriced even by Las Vegas standards, and the security is rude. Definitely this was a one time visit.
The club was ok. Music was not bad but there were 10 guys to every female. . . !!! Maybe cool place for couples. . . !!!
Thank you Todd #Alcatraz Lock and Key. I had called over a dozen locksmiths and none of them could cut my Key.\n\nIf you need a Bentley, Rolls Royce, Jag or other rare key made, call Todd.
Very knowledgable and professional. Unfortunate that their shutters are made in China. Would have liked to use them but couldn't overlook that.
Helpful staff small servings gelado okay
This store has the worst customer service. Had a question fitness equipment and no one helpd us. This is not the first time; matter of fact, every time. The only thing good about this store is its location and selection on clothes.
Lunch on the patio also amazing.  Can't wait for happy hour.
FYI, this place has closed its doors.
Food & beverage are great but the service is horrendous. Been there several times & my only complaint is horrible service.
This place is extremely good.  It is the second best Indian resturant in Vegas.  The first being Namaste.   It is not a hole in the wall just in an off strip location.  This is where the locals eat!
The burgers are tasty, but they're much more expensive than other fast food burger joints. It's definitely worth trying at least once if you're into burgers.
Went for dinner last night, they have closed.  Don't know if it's just a remodel or whether they are out of here...
We went in at 7pm with a groupon, got a lane right away and had a blast!\nEveryone was very nice.
This place is fast becoming my favorite AYCE spot here in Vegas - it has been more reliably good than any other.\n\nTasty appetizers (especially the garlic chicken), good quality fish and quick service make me want to keep coming back here.
Great selection, freshess of fish-good, but I've had better, prices are average, happy hour is great, as far as their service...slow and weak so they get 3 stars
Wasn't overly impressed by lunch here. Sushi was ok but service was ok at best and they kept the place freezing cold. I've had better... Won't likely return to this restaurant.
Used to be my go-to sushi joint for happy hour... That is, until I discovered Soho. There's nothing wrong with 808. It's just that, compared to Soho, there's no reason to go back to 808..
This place is the best! They have a great selection of flavors that they change daily, I think.\n\nPlus it's locally owned, so that's good.
We went on a Friday for dinner and everything was excellent? The server recommended 3 plates each. We decided to split three which was a wise choice as they were huge! Great service and atmosphere we will definitely be back.
Not a normal steak, but one of my favorites in Pgh.
The service is hit or miss, but the food is almost always great. The staff was all eating lunch at the same time one day when we came in. They had to fight over who was going to get up to seat and serve us.
Carne asada is good here!
Since writing my initial review, I have received several messages from the business owners accusing me of making false claims, being a \"troll\" and making accusations that I wrote a bad review because I didn't like a post on Facebook that they made. It has been absolutely absurd.
A bit pricey but very good pizza. If you live in the Upper St.Clair/Mt Lebo/Scott/Bridgeville area and you like Fiori's in Dormont, you'll love this place, as Folino's Bros pizza taste pretty similar to theirs.
Tori is the best eye brow threader I have ever gone to! Shes super sweet, efficient and does an amazing job. Im always so happy when I go see her! Never again would I get my eyebrows waxed, EVER.
The ice cream isn't that great and the workers look like they're half dead. No smile, no thank you, nothing. The tangerine sorbet also tastes like chemical ice.
Darren's a dootiehead again. I found nothing wrong with their pizza or wings.
Sorry to say but I'm not a fan after my first visit. Maybe I just ate on an off day but I dint enjoy the flavors as much when compared to say Pita Jungle and though the meat and vegetables were over done service was very friendly though so it wasn't all bad
Oh how I wish I could leave 0 stars, because this joint deserves it.
Very average-seafood was cold and not highest quality-for this price it should be great-and our server was goofy-and chauvanistic
Great place for gyros, meat grape leaves, everything!! Awesome! And Sam is an incredibly friendly guy! Go!!!
Note to self DON'T take super shuttle when needing to get to airport!!!!! Late & Lost...WTF
Love this location.\n\nThe food is iffy, but the staff is great.
I don't know why yinz are complaining. Every time I deal with the Parking Authority I get a free colonoscopy.
Great high quality italian for the family that is CONSISTENT every Time!
Seriously good pizza.
Nice theatre. Service was great food was good. Doors opened late staff at the door has MAJOR attitude. How about some smiles and friendly greetings to welcome your paying guests?
I don't know what everyone's issue is. Don't be a mouth-breather, have your package properly addressed with appropriate forms filled out and mail it. If you can't handle that you should stay inside.
Great lunch place. Fresh, well seasoned food. Has more than sushi.  Kimichi pork was tasty.
Ordered Sesame chicken and it was way overcooked. Like it was sitting around and they recooked it. Half of the order was not edible and there was not very much meat on the pieces I did eat.
This place is horrible. Donuts are always stale. Coffee always tastes burned. Staff is rude. I never have a good experience here. Worst dunkin donuts I have ever been to.
Had a good experience here!  Tonya was extremely kind and professional.  The owner Sonny was nice and we felt very comfortable here.  I would return!
It's Chili's which means it tips out at three stars, but in this ones case it is small with slow service. Better to wait in line at Burgatory...
I had ordered a pizza for the NFC championship game. I understand you could be busy but my order was cold and the cheese had dried out. Unacceptable.
A nice new store. There are many in the north of the valley, this one is the nicest. Out of the way so never busy. All the great little shops inside and even a Starbucks.
Excellent house turned restaurant. Great sandwiches! Great mac and cheese! A variety of beers which we didn't try today but plan to. Will definitely be back!
We had a great experience! Such down to earth people who care about good food and service. I had the Acapulco Cheesesteak with a cup of creamy asparagus soup! Thank you Kristen for the great service!!!
Unique, delicious food. Great beer selection. Quick and friendly service. Definitely coming back next time I'm in Phoenix.
Good food. Good prices. Good looking wait staff. Hostess was really nice and really cute. Service is fantastic. I come back yes.
Went tonight good drinks good food good service and live music on a sunday night. Try the sausage and mushroom gnocci very tasty.
Fried chicken was pretty good!\nGo for desert!!!\nMonkey bread + coffee! Great!
Great location. Okay food. Kinda overpriced.
Wasn't impressed as the food we ordered was average with a minimal selection. Mostly younger folks, lots of drinking
Nice to place to hangout.  I couldn't find much on the menu that really excited me so I got the Turkey Pastrami.  The sandwich was huge and was fine.  They have really good drinks.  I also like the live music.
Great food! The balls are great. Staff is nice. The curry chicken was bomb. Was a nice treat from out of town. The drinks are different too. A+++
Bomb food! Plain and simple! The pretzel with fondue is sooooo yummy and I love the chicken and Gorgonzola salad! Plus it's central to old town, walking distance from the clubs or the mall- major bonus
Just had an amazing massage at Deja Vu med spa by the wonderful Karen. Great massage, worked on my problem areas and I now feel great. Love the way the place is clean and has a great setup.  I feel very relaxed and I will definitely be back.
It was ok only. I ordered delivery and they messed up my order. They gave me egg drop, instead of wonton. The rangoon and general chicken were delicous. Other than that it was alright.
Amazing!!! I tried their Nutella-banana-nut crepe at the Old Town Farmers Market in Scottsdale, AZ and it was simply the best Nutella Crepe I've ever had. Keep it up!
So I walked this bridge many times on my way back and fourth from the Pirates game. The Bridge is closed during Pirate games, but has a safe walking area even when cars are allowed on.  The bridge has beautiful views and on one end a guy selling $1 waters and Pirate Swag.
Clerks are great, but supervisors and box services are flat out RUDE.
Terrible pharmacy.  Never on time.  Lack of responsiveness.  No follow through.
Surprisingly really good. I liked the nachos I got the most and it all tasted fresh and it was made relatively quick. Excellent service as well. I had a hard time deciding but they were patient with me
Really you're a Mexican eating establishment and don't don't have F-ing limes ????  I don't care how expensive they get. Ridiculous !!
Service was great. Food is very good. As close to authentic as you'll get in Arizona !
A blah sandwich we had to wait 20 minutes for.  Not worth the $8 price tag.  We should have gone across the street to Subway if we wanted a mediocre sandwich and saved a few bucks and some time while we were at it.
One of THEE best places to eat in Madison, for sure. It can be a bit loud inside, but who cares. The food and drinks are so delicious. The upstairs bar is very quaint and spacious. Support this bar, it is SO worth it!
About as pretentious as it gets in Scottsdale. Dark and noisy. Expensive drinks. Not really my kinda a place. But if you're into that kind of thing...
Just average food with exception of the chicken lollipops. Cool ambiance and good service
closed -
They should put the flies on the menu! We went for lunch and were bothered by so many flies that it ruined the meal. Just be prepared!
Good food. Mediocre service, but decent priced happy hour food and drinks! Love the Jalapeno Cilantro Hummus more than anything!!!! Totally crave-able.
Despite really knowing their stuff when it comes to Mediterranean food (killer falafel and baba ganoush), I now also think of them for great thin crust pizza.  The atmosphere is super cool too - try sitting outside at night.
The two times I went in there the customer service was HORRIBLE and would not go back for that reason.
Very nice brew pub to compliment the Madison beer scene. All the tastings in the beer flight were good. The food menu is also quite good. Worth a return visit.
huge projector!
Went on a night that they had a live band on the patio.....was a nice atmosphere. Drinks were good but food was just okay. May go back if other places are too busy.
Entire rental experience was a complete disaster. Rent somewhere else.
This business is now in the process of going out of business.  This is what happens to businesses in this city who voice objections to their customers who are LGBT or polyamorous.  Bigotry is not welcome in Madison.
They do serve Alcohol they have a full bar
Salsa bar alone is worth it.  Awesome artwork is worth it.  Best tacos/burritos are the cactus ones.  Not overpriced.  We love this place.
Good local sub shop.
Great food, service sucks!!!!!
Good food, but easily enough to split.  Loved the basil and cheese eggs, good potatoes.  The portions are gigantic (and for your heart's sake, I would advise splitting a meal), so come hungry.
The portion sizes and the food was amazing!!!!  I love this place.
The best meal I ate in Vegas.  I shared the Chicken Benedict.  It was soooooo good. Come hungry.  I will go back next time I go to Vegas.
Food here was surprisingly better then the Hash House on Sahara. I figured it would be the other way around but the food was actually alot better here.  Service on the other hand was not as good as the one on Sahara so i guess thats the trade off... lol
Horrible enough said and they have the nerve to sale chicken and waffles. If I was the food police they would be banded from making horrible chicken and waffles
Great experience here with the food and service. Our group ordered the chicken and waffles and this pork dish. When they say the portions are huge it's an understatement. The food was tasty and the service was friendly. Really glad I was able to try it.
Awesome I will be returning!!
Huge portions, great food & its 24 hours!!! I wish there was one these in Los Angeles. Only downside is that its always busy here. Waiting list is long. So make sure you have patience. It will pay off once you have your food. Best believe that.
Huge portions , great food and ambiance!!!!
Had the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict and it was very good, but the service was flat out horrible.  40 minutes to get our food and the beer that i ordered when i sat down.  The place wasnt all that busy either.
This used to be my favorite spot in old town...and then suede closed...and now it can only be described in ONE word: GHETTO!
One of the less-bad clubs in the area. It's a little more lounge-like and chill. I suggest visiting with a group and to prearrange seating.
Hands down the best Mexican restaurant I have found in Charlotte.  The food is consistently good, the prices are reasonable and the service is good.  You should give it a try.  you won't be disappointed.
bottom line mexican food for white people too scared to go to a taqueria . every entree is 2 dollars more than it should be , but that said the flavors were fine . salsas were nice and smokey .
Good meal, but the entrees, including the stuffed roasted rabbit loin I got, were barely lukewarm on arrival. Way too loud -- on a Monday at 8:00 -- to hold a conversation. Out of the wine we ordered. Solid service. Nice presentation.
Im not from this area so when I come around Phoenix I always have to stop at a Jersey Mikes since there are very few in So Cal.  I can't wait till they open more where I live cause you can tell the quality is unmatched compared to Subway and Quiznos.
Great tacos!!!
I am a fan of Culvers, but this location is not as awesome as the ones in Minneapolis and Wisconsin.  However, good service nonetheless, excellent burgers and mmm Culvers frozen custard.  It just can't be beat.
The burgers are FANTASTIC. The staff could be a bit more pleasant, but the food is so yummy that I'm willing to overlook their indifference. :)
Find it greasy, but my boys love it.
I just completed a trade in for a new watch. I couldn't have asked for better service or better value. if you're looking for a new watch, this is the place.
I go here every year for my birthday. It's amazing! I first tried fondue in Switzerland and this place is better! Bring your appetite and save room for the chocolate fondue portion. Pricey, but worth it!
Chicken fingers were good. The ribeye was good. Nice portions. Clean bathroom. Attentive staff. Not extra smoky. Open 24 hours. Small yet varied menu. Will probably be on our late night munchies list.
This is the closest subway to my work. Its clean and convenient.  Eat Fresh!
Very good food! Nice staff! Would come back!
Money management doesn't come naturally to most people, so I trust my finances with Silverhawk Financial!
Nice people, good prices!  Make an appointment or call ahead unless you don't mind waiting if necessary. :)
There is the old school Denny's that have been there forever and then there is the new Denny's. This is a new one. Very clean and modern. Always full. Always friendly and fast service.
Worst customer service reps I have ever dealt with. They're rude on the phone and on site. About to terminate my membership with them.
Do not use this company.  I own an electrical company and have been trying to collect payment for work we have done with this company month ago.  We have sent multiple email's and call to try to collect and have still not been paid in full.  BE AWARE!!!
Great staff! This time I'm in the ER with my daughter and the wait was... Well there wasn't really one! They do their job they're quick and caring and really know how to deal with children. I recommend this hospital to anyone with children!
Pizza quality never disappoints.  However, servers need to tie their hair back... same memory of the location by Mill Avenue.  Basic hygiene, please!
It's not as bad as the previous reviews say. I mean how bad can it be? After all, they sell video games.
Parking is a cluster if you come after noon. Come a few minutes before and you're golden.
They are closed, out of business
I ordered an S&W MP15 and and AK and had it delivered to pick up from here. All went well and quickly. Will use again
For take out pizza it was not bad!! Have so many to choose from have Never tried papa johns before! So took a chance,it was hot and came with extras! Will I order again maybe but am going to try others since I'm new to this area!
Been seeing Dr Richards, very professional, always gets me in right when I arrive or shortly after. The whole center has been fabulous.
Very clean and comfy too. Woke up refreshed and smiling. Would stay here again in a heart beat. The freebies are AWESOME. Great food and drinks.
Great pizza and good service.
#dirties - this was an ugly experience.  I got lotto and fuel and left as soon as possible lol.
Not my favorite Cycle Gear store - the selection is not as great as the one on the Cave Creek but ultimately they had what I was looking for - so who am I to complain?!
I had a horrible experience today. Their driver admitted to not reading my delivery instructions and yet they did nothing to rectify the mistake. They ruined a special tradition my husband and I have and I would never use or recommend them. It was a very costly disappointment.
Terrible service for propane... Have tried three times  at different times over three weeks to  purchase and three times told to  wait 15 minutes! I keep trying just to see what the hell will happen next
Dropped a 5 duece in this place... and I dont mean cash.
Had the veggie pan pizza. Bottom of crust was a bit greasy, but that's just how pizza hut bakes the crust.  Otherwise, pretty good.
Food was good, portions a little on the small size for the price. Service was excellent. Our server Katie was great!
Worst service ever!  11 minutes to get my order inside with only 2 people in  front of me.  They pay attention to the drive through only, and that too looks slow. Dont go here!  They are rude too!
The few times I've been inside this bank there's been  no one else there. So naturally they were pretty quick with service.
Dr. Khayami is fantastic. He is thorough and really wants the best results. The massage therapist is great and makes you feel relaxed with a massage prior to your adjustment. Went there with a neck problem and have really seen results.
Dr. Frank Castano is awesome. He walks you through all your treatment options and helps with pros and cons.  Makes sure you understand all of your treatment plan. He was also great with working with my adult down syndrome son.
I think this is the best thai in this area for sure. Their dinner dishes has really good taste and they make it look artistic and I like that !
I like the pharmacy here and I can buy most of everything I want/need here.
You can see instruments from all over the world, and actually hear the music played on them via headphones.  The teens were especially interested in the instruments owned by Elvis, John Lennon and Eric Clapton.  We were there for 2+ hours.  It was $36 for all of us and well worth it.
Been visiting this location for years. The staff is always friendly, the store is almost always in order and things are easy to find. Never had a single problem here. Love them.
I waited for an hour to get my hair highlighted I had previously called and said I was coming in and then it was my turn to be next and they took somebody else in front of me and told me to wait another 20 minutes.
Garbage services carol needs a attitude check she's a horrible manager she shouldn't even have that label horrible all the way around don't buy from here!!!
Service sucks and they leave ads up after the item is sold to get more calls
Ask for Rory. The ex-Oregon State Beaver
they do not pay their billls coution if you're vendor do not trust this company they do not pay .
Had the parmesan garlic and teriyaki wings and they where really good.  A nice and clean wing joint. Just don't be in a hurry, takes awhile to get your food.
Dema's is no more...it's Christina's now. Ate here any way... a couple things expensive, salty, terrible live music. This is one place I won't be back to.
All I can say is alot of food!! We went Mesa, AZ  day and had a reservation. The place was busy, you just look on the wall and order from there. Everything was great, however way too much food for two people.
Had the worse nail experience here. I asked for a nail trim and a fill. The woman cut off some of my skin said \"sorry\" and passed me off to someone else. Wtf?! Definitely not going back!
Michelle and I are colleagues in the Fountain Hills real estate business.  Michelle is highly respected in the community and very supportive of local business.  I admire her expertise and professionalism!
sigh
I am so happy to see Ben in his new office.  He is so knowledgable and can read the body like no other chiropractor I've been to.  He's amazing! My husband and I highly recommend Ben!
Sadly I moved and don't go here but, this gym is great. Good price and lots of equipment. But, its small and never too crowded. Open 24 hrs so you can work out whenever.
My favorite beauty store in all of AZ , hair land is a close second but this store has awesome customer service and supply selection.
All of the various cancer charities run by the Reynolds family are SCAMS. They pay themselves a fortune and give $0.02 for each dollar raised to people suffering from cancer. STAY AWAY!!!!!!!
Great food!  A little pricey for a broke mook like me to do regularly but yummy!
Just left here and they're out of everything, how does Popeye's run out of chicken? thats like Subway running out of bread...find another location besides this one.
Food does not taste good.  The food is boring and bland.  I regretted eating there the moment I tasted the food.  I will stick with the other Mexican food place down the street which is cheaper and the food tastes better!
Good Breakfast Place.  And only 1.3 miles from my office even better!
Typical Panda Express, but add a drive thru. Service is not exceptionally friendly, but lets face it, who cares. You have to deal with the employees for a whole minute and a half. Food is always good, portions are generally good, and close to shopping.
Never eating here again. They did something to my Chulpa. I have diaherrea. Everytime I buy food here, they get my order wrong.
Rude workers... ugh. Good fast food and that's about it lol. Not worth my anger to get some cheap food. Palermos at 83rd and lower buckeye is better.
I worked with Paul Parshley at the Tempe location. He was very professional, he always kept in touch, and is very knowledgeable in his line of work. With the help of Paul, everything went quickly and smoothly.
Why are your lines so long? Worked in retail for many years and really think you can do better.
I wish I had not hire them. The way they cut my grapefruit tree allowed the sun to kill it. Now I have a dead tree. Not worth the money.
Wife wanted some flip flops while on vacation so Old Navy here we come.\nOf course we get those and a few other things.\nThe security guard hiding behind all the racks was a little weird.
Good enough job. Better than Danny's. They are relentless on the up sales though. I dropped a car off to have it detailed and the guy had the stones to call me 15 minutes later trying to up sale me.
The menu is pretty standard fare for breakfast. The restaurant is always clean and the staff are friendly. Surprisingly I ordered the beef tips dinner and it was super tender and had a good flavor. I was pleasantly surprised. They have the best croutons here!
Just spent 40 mins waiting after being told the wait was 20. They were taking other walk ins who I suppose hap appointments but who knows. This place needs adult supervision...won't be back.
There's just not a big selection. The parking lot was crowded but in the store it wasn't. Friendly staff. \nI found some cute juice glasses for $0.69 that's it!
Turns out the bug infested part was BED BUGS by the way!  Yes that's right BED BUGS!
Yet again, you let me down with your terrible customer service, filibertos. Waited in the drive thru for 10 minutes before I had to drive up to the window to have my order taken.  Aaaand I got beans when I said PLEASE, no beans :/
Friendly staff and very accommodating. No need to fear the dentist Dr. Nesbit and Dr. Jones are amazing. The dentists follow up with you personally even on weekends.
I dont understand how taco bell is still in business in AZ where there are hundreds of great mexican restaurants. Taco bell is garbage!
Hesitate to say what a great barber she is because I don't want to share this hidden gem. But Sherry has earned the 5 Star rating.
Closed :(\n\nToo bad too. The pizza was awesome but the customer service was horrible.
My sales person was very knowledgable and respectful. I am very happy with Verizon and their service. Overall nice experience at this corporate owned location. Thank you!
Ordered pizza online - he took an hour to deliver at the house like its just 10 mins away
We ordered rain gutters from Ben Rutan.  They were installed in a shorter period of time than was promised.  The crew were very professional.  The gutters look great and work great!
The way they run this burger king is so inefficient with the cafeteria line style of getting your food. With having to carry your bags with you everywhere, it made it very difficult. Can ya'll just do it the normal way?
Not a fan. He keeps shilling fad \"diet\" and \"nutritional\" products from some website, claiming he doesn't make a dime on them. Other issues I won't discuss here.
Alex is absolutely awesome. I had a general idea of what I wanted but he was really able to bring it to life and give me some feedback on making it look perfect. I couldn't be happier with the finished product and will definitely be back.
They honestly all do a great job, ive been coming here two years since i moved from california and ive always loved my nails and pedicures, always leave happy! (: definitely recommend it!
Girls are sweet and prices are reasonable. The stand up bed is hot so make sure you adjust your time ( I might just be super white lol)
A small shop with a decent selection of fabrics. Prices were about average. Lots of great notions though.
We eat breakfast here frequently. It's typical IHOP, but the food is fine and the staff takes good care of us.
By far, the friendliest Chipotle I've been to. Awesome staff, above and beyond service. Thank you guys for being so awesome here!
Nice place.really busy so very hard to get appt. Or walk in. Clean and friendly. Hope it slows down so I cam get in more often. How do they remember everyone's name?! Lol
Bring on the bombers they are .... Well the bomb!!!!
Friendly staff and great options for sauce. But quality of food of comparable to cafeteria food. Feel like Im eating at high school again.
Service was good. Beer was cold. Football was on. What's not to love?
Best foot spa I have been to in AZ!  Exceptional service and top notch massage
Yummy!! The pizza is delish, the fried mushrooms heavenly, the carrot cake to die for and my family loves their wings!! I highly recommend!
Two hours later, still waiting. Others checked in after me seen. Service has gone downhill in the past year. And new policy of holding debit card isn't the best. Harder to fight inaccurate charges
fast +cheap if you order the right thing + open late + makes goofy commercials  = Jack in the Box
the staff here is not enjoying their work. It feels too much like a factory assembly line here in here. SMILE PEOPLE ! Life's too short to be miserable.
Terrible return policy, can't find staff for assistance. Not what Target used to be like 5 years ago... Big let down, I'd rather do business elsewhere from now on.
Good guacamole and the carne asada was very tender. Good salsa.
Was alright - nothing special... Chicken taco was blah, fish taco was eh, steak taco was good.
What a disappointment!!! I would seek a professional practice as compared to this Chinese Slave Camp!
Food was good. Service was a little slow. Only the owner and one wait person waiting and serving tables.
Why is it that no matter what time you come in it is always at least a 20 min wait? They need to hire more people.
The employees are courteous, the location is super clean, but the food selection sucks and there are only three pumps for cars and light trucks who need diesel.
Ice cream are super creamy if that's your ideal ice cream (personally not mine) however they give generous scoops and the views along the waterfront outside are great photo shots. Close to water taxi drop off ferry terminal
No salad bar, slow service even when its empty (which they always are) and just nit that great. Go elsewhere.
I haven't been to old navy in awhile so I was okay with this store. First time it was pretty messy from all the Christmas shoppers but the second time was a little cleaner. They did have good sales for all ages.
Good car wash at a good price.
qualified vets and techs with a lot of patience to talk to patient owners but it is well known that Banner is very revenue focused and not necessarily suggest things that are not needed but if you took your pet to a private practice you would get just as good care and pay less.
We get the fastest, most friendly service here! We have frequented this chain in 4 other states and this is the best by far! The food is always fresh and I love that they use locally grown ingredients.
This is a good shop. I needed a new radiator. They did not try to sell me non essential repairs that I can't afford. They get straight to the main problem.
The best Doctor Office EVER!!!  Great office staff, nurse practitioner and pediatric doctor.  My daughter loves their office and so do I.  I would recommend the office to anyone with a child!
Both times ive been here the appt. are late. Both about 20-30 minutes late. Of course its because they are busy....i love getting here at least 10 minutes early only to wait an addition 30 minutes past my appointment time ti be called back..
The food here is decent. The bread sticks are really yummy! It is good for large groups. They deliver for $2.50. The pizza is big which is always a plus.
Placed my order before I went to go pick up our order because usually at dinner time they get really busy.  Service was quick, easy and friendly, pizza is delicious and my mom LOVED the garlic parm wings!
The worst most traumatizing customer service experience ever. I promised I would never put a foot there again even if coffee disappeared from earth and that would be the only place left.
Typical downtown Starbucks -nice seating and the fact they have free wi if is always a good thing! Within walking distance of businesses very. Busy-friendly staff and always accurate orders with fresh ingredients
I absolutely LOVE this place.  The food is consistently amazing, high quality and fabulous tasting.  The owners genuinely CARE about the food, their staff, the clients and it shows.  Thank you for being my favorite cafe.  Keep up the awesome work.
I was very impressed with the quality of food.  A great destination for those who are looking for an organic, very tasty meal.  I'd definetely go back.
20 minutes for a California wrap and a lukewarm Maca Warroir Mocha with chocolate all over outside of the cup at a cost of $20. No thanks.
Loved the chicken fingers!
I like the back area of the bar outside. The music is pretty good. Didn't get to stay there long. I'll have to try it again some time.
My favorite cleaners 6 bucks to clean a suit and the best part is its ready the next day. This is also where I get all my pants hemmed and suit jackets taken in.
The name has changed three times and every time this place has done this, the taste has declined. Spicy chilly mint was one of my favorite dishes. Pad Thai is also no longer the same. It has become to sweet. Also They have smaller portions now.
What a disappointment. Had shellac manicure and a pedicure. I could have done a better job on my pedi and the shellac mani which usually lasts two weeks began chipping within the day. This place is an incredible rip off!
Reserved a car, but when I got there, they had none available!!! Employees were rude and spoke poorly of customers in the open! Great way to do business!
Horrible service! I ordered $145 worth of pastries and they overcharged me with sansrival that I never ordered. I called them to have them remove the charge, and the supervisor said, they can't refund the charge! Worst guest service ever!
If you need to use a fax machine, this is your place to go. I've only been here several times for ink and to use their fax machine. Their back to school sales are pretty awesome, so i usually only shop here during late summer/early fall.
excellent experience. the food is priced well, especially for vegas. friendly and speedy servers. i recommend this restaurant to anyone not looking to spend too much money while in las vegas
2 things\nthe balloon lady and the bar\nThat's it.\nEverything else is terrible.
Very slow service, 15 minutes for first glass of water, down hill from there, Food was so/so. Will not be going back here with all the other options. Maybe just a bad night was a Sunday but was not busy for the slow service.
Came here to eat prior to watching a show.  Decent American food without the outrageous Las Vegas price tag.  Then again, hard to mess up a cheeseburger...
This review is just based on walking through to get to Marquee.\n\nThis place is very nice on the outside. On the inside, it's a little dark but nice and spacious as well. It was very crowded on a Saturday night.
Beautiful!!! This is where im gonna stay next time!! The decor and furniture is ohhh sooo chic.
This hotel provided us the best view I've seen from the strip overlooking the fountain shows. The hotel was very trendy and high tech isn't even a good enough phrase to describe the ammenities. YOU must stay here if you want a great Vegas experience.
House cleaning service could have been better. What happens in vegas stays in vegas.
absolutely terrible service. waited room to be prepared for two hours after check in. key to room doesn't work. no reparations.
Parking is really bad. 30 min only one car moved. Never coming here again. Parking lot is very suffocating to be waiting for ever to get out.
This is the worst venue for a concert.. #brunomars concert avoid at all costs.. never again will I ever come here for a concert
Only reason I visited this place was because limited options for pizza in my area during late night. Next time I'll just opt for a frozen pizza in the oven. \n\nWings were terrible. Ranch is pre-packaged nasty stuff. \n\nNever again!
Use to be good, looks like the old guy who worked there before got shitty is no longer there. Disappointed.... Don't order from here
First time here and it was an amazing experience! Julia did exactly what I wanted to my hair and went above and beyond to teach me how to do it myself. Everyone is friendly and the environment is very inviting.
Cheap and fast service.  This is my 3 rd time renting with them and love it!
The trip to the location takes two busses and the wait was do long we cancelled our reservation and took a taxi ... Don't waste your time and effort on this dump!
Remember to check for coupons around the house! Also, for some reason calling in an order for a pepperoni pizza and picking it up is more expensive than ordering it online and picking up... really?
This card is a scam. Got a bill in the mail before I even received my card. Their fees are insane. You are better off using a secured card to rebuild credit. I use a capitol one card and they are awesome
I received an email today to congratulate me on my credit increase!  A credit increase after only 90 days!  Thank you Credit One!
I have been trying to close my card for 2 days and I keep getting the run around.  Terrible customer service, terrible website, too many fees and I was never late with any payments.  Shop around more...do not apply for this card.
Nice little shop. They are pretty clean and organized, but my fella did have a little trouble when he purchased a game and realized they gave him the old version only after getting home already. We went back and exchanged it for the correct version with no hassle.
The food is tasty, but pricey, huge portions. Service was just okay, even though there were no other customers, and despite the fact that I did state it was my first visit, the girl helping seemed annoyed that I had to think for a millisecond about what I wanted.
We received a flyer in the mail for a free 16 ounce uswirl, for being new residents to the area.  We called and confirmed before coming down.  When we arrived we were treated so badly that we left the creams vowing never to return.
Its been over a year since I had Chili's. I had a taste for some ribs and it really hit the spot.
Very disappointing!  One of the worst steaks ever, they don't even grill them, cooked on a flat top.  No flavor at all.  Service matched the food quality.  We won't be back.
Big puddle in the floor on the to go side waited 15 minutes for an order that was supposed to be ready ten minutes ago. Finally left after being ignored by staff. Will not be returning.
This place is located near the outlet center and is easy to access. In the store they provide you with packing tape if you need it. Unlike some other places that require that you purchase it. The customer service members are nice unlike USPS workers.
Pizza isn't SoO good as everyone say it is. Pizza took a long time, a bit too salty and it came out burnt =\\ I wouldn't go back to eat again. Nothing like the EAST Coast pizza.
Had another great pizza here tonight. Can't wait to you guys get to Chicago! Great service too, Mike at the bar was great.
Terribly maintained. The greens are worn and ripped all over the place. Nice layout, but I just had to shake my head at how poorly maintained this place was. It was as if management never took a look. Just awful.
This place is a joke for lunch. We have been here for over 40 minutes waiting on fried food and we are the only table here. You guys really need to change your whole staff. Just so you know we are still waiting.
This location is a lot cheaper than the ones at the malls. Everything was pretty much the same, minus the metal cup your extra milkshake comes in at the other locations; just better prices.
Ate ate Popeye at many states, this is not it!\nThe spicy chicken is NOT spicy yet it contains more grease then chicken, purely inedible. no idea how they get away with it in a corporate environment.
Nice, big patio to enjoy a conversation and catch up with friends. The inside was clean and service was nice. All the pastries looked especially tasty at this location. Nice job.
Conveniently located next to Southpoint Hotel and Casino so if you're looking for non hotel food dining walk or drive to this Del Taco location.\n\nService is as expected with any Del Taco.
I always come to this shop and schedule with Lee I like my nails to be different all the time and he does an amazing job
Very informative, great prices, very thoughtful and friendly. Before you get ripped-off for a new violin visit this place.\nI am saving my money for when is time to upgrade my 10 year-old violin's, will definitively buy one there.
Chimichangas are very good and filling....couldn't finish it. The salsa was decent and slightly spicy.  Had a peach Margarita...very yummy and strong.
I wonder if they charge extra if I ask for more flavor?  The Beef and Broccoli tasted like nothing; absolutely nothing!  The chicken quality is great, but all the food in general lacks in the flavor department.
We always get meat here when it has yellow tags. Saving money. Also I drop off my proscriptions and pick up later. They will send you a text when ready.
Had a good time!
Love the place! The newest songs! Best gathering place in town!
Their website doesn't work, and I tried the phone number and it isn't in service?
I ordered iced americano and sat here for longest time and went to check on my drink. My coffee was sitting there half way melted. Do they not call out when the order is ready? SMH.
Thus placer has The wrost serice   Thee doctors  are good, close from 1 to 2:15  butin realiti from 12:45 to 2:30 wors front ofices personal.
The employees at the tire desk are so short with answering questions. Very quick to brush you off.  Will not be getting tires from there anymore or will not recommend to friends, go to discount tires instead..
Still the best!! Jessica and her staff are amazing and caring! Stay independent amd come here for all your scripts!
I have nothing but positive things to say about Henry's place. My whole family and I have been taking our cars to him for years and we have never been let down. I recommend him to everyone. BEST mechanic in town!!
Staff manager isn't that friendly or helpful, and they never have what I want in stock. It is closer to my house than PetsMart, but after three unsuccessful trips I will just head to the competitor spot to get what I need.
Bought my R6 in march of 2010. Best service and still receiving discounts on gear. Manager is awesome and made my life a little happier by selling me my Yamaha.
Friendly and knowledgeable help. Wish this place was closer to us.
My first time here. Grabbed 2 bobba drinks. It was ok but super expensive. It was over $11 for just 2 drinks. Yikes! Decor is kind of outdated and grungy hence doesn't explain the high prices.
Mediocre taste and horrible service. Always one person working and takes forever to make the boba.
This place is the worst.  It is super dirty not the best part of town.  It looks like they never wash any sheets the place smells!!  I notice some of the good reviews on this place is for the casino next door that is part of the Hotel so don't be fooled
Sure am glad they built this place.  Much cleaner than the chevron and it was way to busy anyways.  Southern highlands is a large community with not enough gas stations.
What's there to say? It's a dry cleaner. It happens to be my dry cleaner of choice because it's a mere 3-minute walk from my house. I don't usually have things dry cleaned, so I cannot compare pricing. Overall... A-OK!
I've been using them for 4 years because of their close proximity to my house but I've stopped.  Too many issues the last 6 months with clothes 2-3 days late, items missing, and very inconsistent customer service.  The staff turnover is very, very high.
Had an issue while trying to cancel my reservation, but Jim S. went out of his way to call me and correct the problem. Will definitely do this on my next trip to Vegas.\n\nThanks again for being so helpful.
Yum, yum, yum....need i say more?   Expected fast somewhat mediocre greek food....got the most delicious lunch!   Be sure to get the grilled chicken salad!
service was great
iced green tea... all year long!
They the one mess up my order but she is like it my faul. after she need to make new one she said I have to make sure my order and she give me bad attitude.
I had the IPA, it was good. worth coming here for a beer if you are in the building. Service was very good. I got a very nice shirt too.
Great sales and a staff that's not too stuck up makes this an above average A&F
yay! love this place. ive been coming here for years. its always very clean & pleasant employees. Great monthly deals if you sign a year contract.
No problems with food quality, I hear they are under new management. However, they have no condiment bar. I've never heard of a Quizno's that doesn't! I need my horseradish sauce, guys.
Well this place is decent. The food was ok. I got the tamales but turn out they only have de \"elote\" I didn't liked them much. I messed up in what I got. But everyone else's plate was good.
This location is great. Always stop in when I'm in town. Huge selection and great customer service....music isn't that bad either
The manager was inflexible and would not issue a refund after I canceled my room. Rude and would never stay at this property in the future. Bad business
Stopped I for a pedicure randomly, Really fast and friendly, the guy who did my pedi was very nice even had a pleasant conversation... He told me I had healthy feet haha. No one was pushy, honestly one of my best pedicure experiences
Been a patient of Dr Soumi for years they always pleasant never late . I recommend everyone I know to try them  they are awesome
I just done happy feet pedicure ( Nu Pedicure) today with Candy so amazing, it's make my feet so smooth and it has hot stone massage so relaxing. i love it.
This is your garden variety CVS but since it's in Summerlin things are overpriced. Apathetic employees who are never in a hurry.
This place is the business.\nWhen I visit Vegas I always make sure I come here for some good seafood.\nDefinitely recommend to try out!
Love Love Love this spa!!! I have watched them grow and expand, while maintaining their Amazing customer service! I can get it all here! Gel manis, pedis, waxing and even eye lash extensions! I won't go anywhere else!
For a delivery style pizza restaurant, this place is top of the line. Every time I order form here I am impressed at the quality of food I am delivered. The pizza is much better than those main street chains and aside from the prices other places don't even compare.
Dispatcher was incredibly rude. But it's a tow company, no surprise there. Pulled up in our cab as the tow truck was pulling in with my car. Didn't even park my car on their lot and charged me $300!! What a scam!
Was in and out today. First time ever. Chairs need an upgrade. Should be a little more cautious about infection control
My hubby n I dined in tonight. Got a pizza. It was delicious! The prices are good & the staff is friendly. Extra points for this location being so convenient to where live!
Better than Starbucks. No contest! And super friendly...doesn't feel like a franchise.
Tried to redeem a voucher I purchased on Living Single, they denied it. Instead they tried to upsell me to pay twice what I paid on Living Social. They also wouldn't refund the price of the voucher.
AMAZING! Definitely great quality massages-- and for only $45 for 80 mins?? WOOORTH IT! I was helped by a student named Armando, and he was fantastic! Highly recommend!
They always take the time with my kids and are very good.  Sometimes they have a waiting list and often are booked up....so I recommend calling ahead to make an appointment.  But it is very worth it as the results speak for themselves.
I highly recommend the groomers who work here. workers and the owner are really caring. I've been a long time customer of this store because of their groomer and really great customer service.
Got the Rock Star Mani.. I love it..
Daaaaayum, everything is expensive. The only things that weren't were the souvenir shot glasses in the middle aisle for .99 haha. Sigh haha.
Ok, so I wrote my review yesterday and I am writing my update from my phone because I have no internet. In the last two hours my internet dropped 4 times and the TV lost connection 3 times. You get centurylink prism and you will be paying for intermittent service.
This place is ok, not great but alright. When your hungry for some quick Mexican food its good. But what makes me give this place 2 stars is the lady behind the counter that takes the orders. She always has a sour face like she hates her job!!!
These guys are the hardest workers I have ever witnessed. They did an EXCELLENT job with our move and I 100% recommend them.
this place is like a lost mazed, even the employees don't know where they put their stuff. Target is much better place to shop
Love this place! They are always very fast, even during the dinner rush. I highly recommend the Singapore noodles! Yuummm! :)
I'm down 20 pounds and loving it!  Adam Luckette takes awesome care of me whether its diet or health. The staff is amazing!  Give them a try!
I love how friendly everyone is and they have the best beds that give the best color in town
Worse than ever! They did not have formula for our daughter. They did not have formula. Horrible. Also, they sold us a bag of Butterfingers which was missing several of the bars. (Just empty individual packs.)
Great crew.  Each person has something special to offer and they all know what they are doing.  My mom switched after 10 years with Verizon because of some Bozo there...  Much happier with AT&T.
Another win from Sing Sing. Emailed them a pdf at 6pm on Thursday. Got a quote and a proof back at 6:15pm. 2x3 custom foam board was done by 2pm the next day. 20hr turnaround. Not. Too. Shabby.
Went there to sign up and waited 45 mins to talk to the manager. Both the front desk girl and the manager were not personable or friendly.
I live near this shop. The reviews guided me to this establishment. I tried to call before going and much to my disappointment YELP CONTAINS THE wrong number. The correct number is 702-434-9333
Amazing customer service. These guys know what they are doing. I would give them 10 stars if I could! Highly recommend.
Im not impressed with their lack of a dedicated customer service rep. The lady that tried to answer the phone several times sounded like she was on a treadmill, and guessing at pricing.
Not only are they the SLOWEST pharmacy they very seldom have the medication in stock that you will need. Do yourself a favor and go down the road and don't even bother stopping here they're going to send you to Desert Inn location anyways.
Very glad to have found and chosen this salon. Sign up was very easy, everyone I've met has been wonderful and helpful, and it's a national company so you can visit ANY palm beach tan in country. Lotion is a little pricey in-store, though.
They never showed up for cleaning despite makindg the appointment days before. No calls to explain or apologize.
Dumpy supermarket.  Try another one.  Also, don't hang around after dark.  Gets creepy in this section of town.
The ghetto Albertson's. My friend always wants to go grocery shopping at this place. I just don't like this particular location, the food quality isn't the greatest, the selection is mediocre.. Try another Albertson's location.
Terrible.  Overbooked and forced to wait an hour over appointment time after time.  If insurance let me go to other doctors would in a heartbeat.\n\nPoor bedside manner not too friendly.  Very disappointed.
Finally found an OBGYN that I feel comfortable with in LV. Earnest, efficient, gentle and thorough. Oops.....the most important....ON TIME! I hope this ones a keeper
Called to make an appointment. Was asked what insurance I have and told her I didn't have insurance. She said Dr. Venkat wasn't currently taking cash patients. Wtf! Seems kinda rude.
Good boba with a wide variety of flavors and juices to add to your mix. If you're in the area and appreciate a good boba,  definitely consider stopping by!
Every time we visit Vegas we come here for a boba milk tea as a special treat. The ladies at this store are always nice and the teas come out very quickly, even if there's a line.
good deals great chicken
ho mean, taught I was in Maui when I walked in till BOOM, register talk straight English.
Terrible service!!!! They will give every excuse in the world as to why they can't clean it same day!! Even when I called to make sure they could before I got there!!!
Hannah is fantastic! She's updated the decor since we first started coming here 2 years ago. It's beautiful. She has a great sense of humor and always tries to accommodate everyone.
Always quick and good food. Service could get a little better though. Employees always seem like they're hassled to have to take your order.
Love their spin classes & the cardio theatre. Always smells good in here , super clean and a good vibe!
This was an okay gym. Its smaller than some of their other gyms . So if your trying to lift be prepared to wait. If your looking to do cardio there more machines than you can shake a stick at .
Very clean for a robertos very fast.  Food was amazing I have been to other robertos and they were filthy and slow..
Customer service sucks hard in the pharmacy department. The bald dude with the beard really needs an attitude adjustment
I went here with 2 of my friends. It is clean and service was good but the food was disgusting. We all got different dishes and none of liked it. My sauce tasted like it was chef boyardee canned sauce. Would not recommend this place if you have taste buds.
This store does have almost everything for babies. However, prices are higher than Target or other retailers. Additionally, customer service is non existent at this location (rainbow). Expect to pay more and be patient waiting in long lines.
Ordered brisket beef sandwich - inedible, stringy and fatty. BLT salad small for $7 and very average. Would not return
Came to an event which allowed me to get the private dining experience.  Food was incredible, and service was outstanding.  Very nice outside patio ambiance.  Lots of room for people, but still managed to keep the intimate feel.
Fish tacos were very nice. Had the bartender make an avocado margarita that I once had at a 5 star resort in Mexico and it was just as good if not better.
Slow service,  average food.  In fact, I had a 100% better Cesar salad at pub in Seattle. Lame. The restaurant itself is nice and the bar area looked pretty lively.
Eric was a great waiter for our wine pairing with MyVegas.com. Explained our pairings well and went to get answers when we questioned him. He did a great job and the food was great too.   We had the linguine with clam sauce and brick chicken.
Atmosphere is great as restraunts is modern and has a nice open environment.  Food was good, nothing extremely special though in the food department as I felt it was normal. My husband and I both got the pizza and although it was good it was nothing to write home about.
excellent food and the waiter was outstanding.\nwas my wife's birthday July 4th and he had a great dessert with a sparkler candle in it\n\nrecommend to anyone
i love the cheese curds.  awesome.
Since my review I have been in contact with the management of Hussong's and have been reimbursed for my visit.  They indicate there has been re-training of the staff and are hopeful this will make a difference.  I am pleased they listened and were willing to make it right.
I ordered the Chicken Fajitas which were average.  The food is nothing special and the service is very slow.
This is a great option to Border Grill at Mandalay Bay. The food was decent and the prices were a bit lower than other places. It's a casual atmosphere with friendly service. I would surely go again for quick and cheap eats.
Have to give this place five stars.  Menu is great, value is great but the cook Jose is the best.  Great customer service, really knows how to treat a customer.  He gave me a sample of the Greek fries yesterday and they are out-of-this-world good!
Really good food. But for a $10 combo there's almost no chicken.  WTH? Last time I was here I got a nice portion.
The bathroom was very nice. \nOtherwise, overpriced drinks with lots of ice and little alcohol. Not a place to hit up.. Definitely a \"must miss.\"
Best chicken in town love this place I eat here about twice a week definitely recommend it to all my friends =)
Prefer QDub over Chipotle. They are a little weak on the meat portion and 'very little' cheese ends up being a mountain full. One of my favorite for fast food tacos.
This is one of those hole in the wall places you could quickly become addicted to going to. We had their Tijuana Torpedo hamburger special and their yummy Strawberry Shortcake. We will definitely be back.
Richard Zhao! Ask for this guy if you pay this location a visit. He's very professional, personable, and isn't pushy. Enough said.
There's many places to get a sandwich and a select few that slice the meat fresh like Goodcents. Great eats and they have a great loyalty program where you buy 9 and get 1 free.\n\nMy favorite is either the Penny club or Italian.
They do a great job with the cleaning...  very little dry time... they don't rush the job either... will use again for sure.
Great shop with a good group of Mechanics.  I've taken quite a few cars there. Support your local shops and still get it done cheaper.
Urban 7 I really want to like you but I cant. Went there for a mid week happy hour. The crowd was non-existent the service was good but awkward. May give it one more shot to redeem but for now 2 stars.
Love the MacShack. The have wheat and gluten free pasta as well. Yum yum yum
Nice clean restaurant and really really fresh food.  everything is made to order from when you order, and brought out to your table.  there is no waiter service, it's walk up, order and delivery to the table.\n\nI'll go back.
The food is really great. \n\nHaving said that, it's overpriced and they nickel and dime you on everything. Plus the portion sizes are really not big enough.
What a joke. Indifferent and rude receptionists. Lazy artists. Go to a real tattoo shop and avoid this place. For drunk tourists only!!
The oatmeal was good. The fruit was crisp and the raisins plump. The sweet tea was fresh.
I had the banana split cupcake...yuuum. I little dry on the top of the cupcake, but good overall.
How can anyone visit the boutique when there is no address listed? Plus, when I tried to click on another post that said it was closed, the response from the owner can't be seen... Not going to get business that way
Food was excellent! A must stop when in Casa Grande. Florentine omelet outstanding! We will return.
This place is legit. Had a great experience while visiting from pa and I must agree about cheesesteaks, and i have tried all the Philly spots. Good prices and great food/beer.
This place has great panang chicken ..highly recommend this place
BEST chicken pa-nang I have ever had!! Well done!
Pretty weak lunch...calamari salad was tough, cheap Chinese crap, crab dip was edible
Sam met me at the service area, checked in my vehicle for its appointment and got me a curtesy vehicle. I was excite to get my car back clean and ready to go.
The food here is pretty good. I love the wasabi tempura shrimp appetizer. The mushroom soup is very rich. \n\nThe washrooms are designed with a contemporary style, very nice.
A wonderful restaurant experience, a super friendly staff in a beautiful industrial decor.  The open kitchen gives the whole place a special touch.\n\nBut above all a stunning food, there are always new items on the menu that keep surprising us. A must try in Montreal!
The sushi was just ok and the ginger dressing was too sweet and not very ginger like. Not good enough for the price.
Decent breakfast burritos and surprisingly good rolled tacos.
Friendly staff and they try to make your wait short and comfortable while you wait for your car to be serviced.......One thing that would make it a bit nicer would be to have to drivers since they are driving us all over town to get home.
awful!!!!
Awesome place!!! You must go and try all the services!!!!
Excellent service, fabulous food, great bar. Don't miss the Welsh rarebit--heaven!
Eleanor the bartender: fuckin' awesome. Period.
This place is tons of fun! \nI stopped in with my family to have oysters and beer and we ended up eating and drinking for a couple of hours. \n\nGreat ambiance, friendly service and good food.
Busy busy place... great happy hour specials! Great server! \n\nWe will be back next time we are at the Aria.
Meh....\n\nMaybe I need to give it another shot, but I wont do that until someone else pays for it. lol Too expensive for some meh...
Beer took 20 minutes to get to our table. Fly in my water. Half of food came late. Service not worth the price but food is good.
Ate here twice during a recent visit to LV.  \nGreat food & great staff.  Super helpful in navigating significant drink and food options.  Typical overpriced LV though. Perhaps 30-40% inflated just because it is inside of ARIA.
Whole Paycheck prices, over $400 for a small cart of food is absurd!  Vitamin products are full retail prices in most cases, buy online and you can save 50%!  Wayne Gorsek
This Baja Fresh.... WAS NOT GOOD....\n\nOnly had whole beans at 5:30 pm????\n\nAirport restaraunts are usually sub-par but this was BLAH.
Tasteless burrito. I'm not picky, but the food is not good. The 2nd star is only because the Churro is quite good.
Get an entry level foot spa, and then you can enjoy this great place for a whole day!
We were excited to find a well-reviewed Chinese Restaurant close to home but were disappointed after eating the food.  My 13-month old daughter and I had an upset stomach that night and my dad got sick when he ate it for leftovers.  Needless to say, we will not return.
For some reason, I like this place.  They play some good throwback rock n roll   Located in a prime spot in the party district of Scottsdale. Good beer, good music, good location - life is good.  Happy hour specials are somewhat meager
Great bartenders! Food is surprisingly good for bar food. Always enjoy my time there. A good neighborhood bar.
Food is just okay. Ordered tofu with shredded beef. Beef is just too thick and not tender enough to chow. Spicy broth is just so so.
Shawrma was yummy.  But the parking here is a bit dicey if you use a wheelchair as I do (gravel lot, no dedicated ADA spaces).
Go see Heather G! She's cut my hair the last few times and I won't go anywhere else .. She does a. Ice scalp massage and uses good styling products.
Great burgers!!! Good drinks!! A little strange eating in a booth with sheriff Joe's picture though.
Love this place! It's close to my work, every time I walk in the bartender has a beer ready for me.  The food is amazing, I have tried almost all of their burgers and the wings are some of the BEST in phx
Great Place. I go here pretty often, same with the one in downtown.
Small and cozy diner atmosphere. Good friendly customer service. Burgers and fries are really good. I will be visiting this place often to get my hamburger fix!
People there always helpful and friendly. Reasonably priced wine
Food was ok not the best tasting Mexican food then again it is a fast food place. I had the carne asada fries, what made it edible for me was that it had sour cream which I like very much. Service was good, they got my order right.
Not much to say about this place, overprices and i could say one of the worst pho meals i have ever had.
Locale is clean, staff is friendly. Had the classic chicken, smash fries and lemon herb tea. Food is good, price is reasonable. Had a good lunch.
Good sashimi a bit high priced how ever all the fish I had was fresh and well served.  I have been three times and each time had a good experience.
The WORST sushi in my life. Too undercooked sushi rice (like long-stored bad grain), not fresh,smelly and dry fish (low quality). \nWhat should I say more? In my dinner menu, wine was only thing I could eat.
We called George to help us build two media centers to accommodate our electronics and large televisions. George gave us a fair price and did excellent work. We are very happy with his company and his services. \n\nThank you Yelp and thank you George.
Truly disgusting place.
If there were negative stars, they would get one. They told us a 10 minute wait. An hour later we left. Unbelievable. I will never be back to any saddle ranch.
Service has been horrible all 3 times we have been here.  The food is ok, but overpriced!  Not a bad place to drink as long as you don't drink fast!
Great happy hour, but very inconsistent kitchen.\n\nSome days the foods out in 10 minutes, the next it's 40. \n\nWe consider ourselves regulars , but unfortunately we won't be anymore do to the inconsistency from the kitchen.
Slow service and rude, abrasive, disrespectful mangers who called the police because we refused to pay for $100 of food and drinks that we did not order or receive. Very disappointed and shocked!
Great environment for hanging out or watching the game. The service and food were good.
Don't get me wrong, ice cream was good but dang $3.99 for a SMALL bowl.  Kiddos enjoyed it of course.  They had a good amount of seating in the small shop.
We went for Happy Hour last week so I can only comment on the drinks. I rarely drink liquor but the Spa caught my eye so I gave it a shot. Order it! So delicious!\n\nNeed to come back for breakfast - the menu looks awesome.
$10 dollars for three baby tacos with slivers and I mean slivers of fish or mushrooms, all on a wet plate?  No thanks, that was a rip off.
Meh, nice patio but lackluster service if it's busy. I don't think we're cool enough to hang here, at least that's how they made us feel, and no one should feel that way as a paying customer. Not worth a return trip.
Food is killer finger licking delicious\nservice is good\nthey have live music\ngreat beer choice\na must
It's a little loud in there, but overall the happy hour was great. Very reasonable and good drinks.
The staff of US Airways based in the McCarren Airport was very rude..I've enjoyed US Airways to/from other airports, but I will not fly with them through Las Vegas from now on.
Hate this airline.
After a friend raving about this place for 6 months I had to go.  I'd say my turkey sanwich was pretty average.\nI'd never go again simply for the fact they don't have Sweetener for their unsweetened iced tea.  Boo.
Great location right in the middle of the casino! Regular Starbucks coffee at jacked up prices but hey this is Vegas!
Portions were huge!  We ate it all though.  That must have meant the food was tasty.  My wife and I shared one dish, The New Mexican Platter.  We also enjoyed the prickly pear margarita.
They boast that they have the worlds best pancakes - and it is true! Each bite tastes like toasted butter! Quick and friendly service, cheap, and located inside the Golden Gate Casino.
The pancakes were as good as advertised! My father had the french toast and loved it as well. Freshly squeezed orange juice and crispy bacon were also good.
Their products, service and prices are phenomenal. Their product prices got my business and their prompt and courteous customer service and amazing product quality will keep me coming back. I know that once my order is placed I don't need to worry - it will done correctly and on time!
Every time I get an ice coffee it ends up tasting completely different every single time and worse and worse. No matter who makes it.
If you want to try something different and excellent try Le Chalet. The food and service is very good with menu items you will not fine in many places. They also have a full bar and happy hour.
Waiters are awesome and the food is great. I do wish the owner would allow you to order the \"la Potence\" beef tenderloin  medium instead of rare. Best dessert in town.
Awesome food and service!! Our waiter was very knowledgeable and friendly. The food however is very price, our check was well over $100 for two of us. Great place to go every now and then.
Decent lounge, good music, fun crowd.
The deuce. Pricey ass drinks as per usual.
Mmmmm, best mini burgers in the city!
I loved Zinburger! I had a Turkey Sloppy Joe and my table shared the truffle fries! Everything was so good and I plan to go back!
Amazing guacamole!! The food is wonderful! Great service too! Go on Restaurant.com to get your $$ off! We used a $50 off of $100 and ended up spending around $75 for four adults to drink and enjoy an AMAZING meal!
Pretty good a bit pricey could be cleaner
We had terrible service and I'm sad that we went. It was a busy Saturday but even the few bartenders weren't friendly or helpful. Had to ask twice for drinks and everything else. I won't be going back by choice.
Very cute little setup here. Nice simple selection. Great flavors. Nice when you hiked a couple miles on state street to take a break! Great prices !! Nice boxes for gifting or taking to work !
Keenly priced with a good selection of enterprising dishes on the menu and a reasonably well stocked bar.\n\n\n You'd not stop in for the whole night but definitely a very good option for off the cuff dining rather than a pre-booked affair.
I live a block away from the park...I won't take my daughter here since the playground is always torn up
Haha, just stood there behind another guy for ten minutes with No type of worker presence, he ate a bag of chips and we mobbed it to silver mine..if you can't be open 24hrs you should at least lock your doors..lol
Got me some pho, and it came with a standard metal spoon and didn't come with any cilanto or mint leaves. Service was less than exceptional. However, the Japanese Dancing with the Stars knockoff on TV was pretty entertaining.
Are you lost? Run away from this place as fast as you can! Not only the vodka will ruin your stomach but also the horrible thing they call food. At $35 ($45 with taxes and tips) the holidays menu is a total rip-off.
It's not made with care\nThe food....\nThe cooks don't know what they are doing... its American food not Mexican
We ate here because of convenience and location. We were at the lake, hungry, and not ready to go home yet. They have an okay menu selection, but I would never go out of my way to go back.
Great price (duh) and they are super fast. I've never waited longer than 5 minutes to get in and grab some food. Nice folks behind the counter, too.
I most certainly love Five Guys Burgers & Fries! Dude, even their hot dogs rock!
Always have to get the Pollo Fundido.  Can't go wrong with that.  It's even better on Wednesday's.  $5.
Horrible salsa and awful, stale chips. Mediocre fish tacos and they don't have black beans! Seriously?
This was a fun event in a gorgeous location. You have to get there early because they run out of many of the beers fast! As long as the weather's nice, I won't miss this event!
Are meal took along time and when it finally came they got are order wrong and acted like it was are fault. And the cheeses burgers we ordered were bland and nothing special. I dont think I would have a reason to go back.
Bland food, bad service, prepare to wait for an hour for your main course.
Really really good ! Just moved to East Vegas, wanted a good restaurant ! Found one.   Had: Crab Cheese Rangoons (delish) Chicken Satay (fabulous) Chicken Yellow Curry (perfect taste & after taste) Spicy Mint pork with...
Ambience great. Coffee ok. Service below par. That's me in there now 3 times this past week and not a smile or hello from anyone working there. One more try and then I'm moving on if no change...
Quirky interior, clearly popular and possibly the best priced pot of tea in town.\n\n\n Could maybe do with opening past 18:00.
The food ain't what it used to be here. They've introduced a carvery but only one visit per person.
I left my expensive ray-bans on the table after eating at binion's cafe. When i returned 10 minutes later for the sun glasses, they weren't there and the waiter that served us was not to be seen. Very disappointing.
Equipment is not well maintained. Pads are wearing out and not replaced on a fair amount of the machines..  No attention to oiling machines.  Place is not especially clean.  Not enough lockers.   Cardio cinema is a complete waste of space.
This was one of the more of the expensive buffets I had in Vegas, $21 a person dinner on Monday and it just wasn't that good.  Just down the street at 4 Queens we had a great meal for $9.
Went here August 1, 2014 for dinner. Should have save my $26, it was not worth it. Smelled fishy when you walked in. Save your money. Even prime rib was tough. Service was good, not there fault food is bad.
I live down the street and my boyfriend and I love coming to raising canes. The service is great! Aside from a few times of our order coming out wrong, still really good.
went here last week with friends & it was amazing. had a gr8 time. great food, great drinks, excellent atmosphere, and awesome time. i would like to bring my husband here for date night.
Probably one of the coolest bars in Madison. Quirky without being pretentious, laid back without being soporific. Fantastic beer selection and really friendly staff.
This place is very clean and has a friendly staff. Our favorite was the sisig. Too bad they took it off the menu. Their sinigang and lechon kawali are delicious.
Visited last week and was very happy. It took a few minutes longer than expected but it was well worth the wait. WILL return, next time in town.
Good, average food. Not the greatest but it hits the spot. 808 Hawaii Mixed Plate up the road has some fancier dishes, a little more tasty, but you get what you expect here.
tried the short ribs, by far the worst short ribs ive ever had. It had no taste and it was gamey.
I thought that I could only get some good noodles here on the East Coast but boy was I wrong! I cant stop thinking about how good it was. Next time I am in town, Im heading straight there!
Horrible \nGo to burger king instead....is that bad.
This Walmart was just like any other walmart, except, the employees were extremely rude and not helpful at all. I will no longer be going to this walmart, I will drive the extra miles to another walmart for the smiles and friendly help!!!
Fries are great but everything else is terrible.  I would eat here more often if they improved their burgers even just a little bit.
Gimmick - they say no enrollment fee but they want 69 admin fee.  Whatever. The other lifetime fitness is only 69 enrollment. \nBullshit
I've been going here since September of last year and I still love it. I have an awesome trainer who helps and educates his class. It may be a bit pricey but to me it's worth it.
Cute place in an authentic setting. The restaurant has Scottish charm. The food was clean and hearty. Had a halibut carpaccio which was amazing. The staff was friendly. Met the owner who was just great. Highly recommend.
Not happy, got there at open to get a meatball sub, I hope I got yesterday's marinara sauce, I hope they would not serve that crap.  It was horrible.  If that's you standard change it, I wasted my money and will not be back.
My hubby and I love this place great food and service are favorite is the peanut butter cake it is to die for !!
Extremely friendly service. Loved the food. I told my server that I thought the ginger mint tasted good and she gave me a handful to take home! She went above and beyond!
Amazing drink prices especially noted is the $5 Patron. However the food is horrible. The burger meat has made me horribly sick. I still come here for the bar though. Great day drinking spot.
Our south tower room had great view of the Strip and casino isn't so large that you get lost. Room was a bit tired and there are newer, cheaper options. Not bad.
Coffee roasted on site - Sunday afternoons. Good coffee, usually quiet atmosphere. very nice staff. sanwiches are a bit over priced, but taste good. Focus on the coffee and you will do well. Have gotten alot of work done here and have held many meetings outside.
I literally hate this place because their donut holes are so delicious and addicting! I moved into an apartment down the street and now I have to drive by it everyday... Haunting my dreams with delicious donuts
I love this place but always seem to forget about it. The rockin shrimp is an absolute must! The slider app actually makes a nice meal for the ladies. I love the salmon and my husband loves the chimichurri  skirt steak. Their happy hour is one of the best around!
Everything was fine, just surprised anyhow old of movies they were still playing. Some had been in theaters 3-4 months. Seems to be the jr. High hangout place
We were told a one hour wait ... With no one in the waiting area. And the hostess was incredibly rude and unhelpful. Such a disappointment
Edinburgh's most accomplished restaurant.  Food and wine pairings are excellent and the service sublime.  The dining room is beautifully appointed and extremely intimate.  For the most special of occasions in Edinburgh, this is definitely the place.
Busy place with a long wait...\n\nFood was mediocre....\n\nBUT their margaritas were super good. I'd come back just for those!!!
Very good food.  Very fresh for Chinese food.  The shrimp fried rice was very fresh.  Great service.  They had high chairs for my 1 year old and were very nice about the mess she made.
Overall,  good buffet selection.  Went there on Valentine's day craving for some seafood buffet.  They served complimentary champagne and unlimited lobster claws that night. The line was long but it was  worth the wait.  Asian dishes could be improved, I think.
Is the food good? Yes\n\nHowever you'll have a nicer dining experience at a fast food place. We arrived at 6:30 and we're out the door by 7:02 and not by choice.
The service sucked. Managers were outside on break or smoking when the restaurant was packed. Always out of something on the menu, like taquitos. I like el pollo loco food and will have to drive further to get better food and service then this location!
The pizza is so good that I forgive them for being Red Sox fans and will continue to eat there despite all the Red Sox posters. So if a New Yorker can tolerate Red Sox paraphernalia the Pizza has to be good!
Loved the Pizza.  Loved the service.!  What more do you want?
Love this place!! Amazing home decor! I finally found the shelf that I needed for my kitchen and they have tons of cute decorations to make your house a home, very unique!
Busy atmosphere and can be a bit of a wait. Food is decent enough and the price O.K.. \nI did find the most memorable thing about Big in Japan, was the service.
Nice if they have what you're looking for.  Limited selection can be a plus or a minus.
worthy !!
Very delicious food here
This place makes the best latte I've ever had. I miss it so much after I graduated. Hot/iced latte, macchiato, berry tart, sfogliatelle are my favorite~
This cart features local and organic fare.  The pasture raised pork carnitas are fantastic.  Hands down the best food cart around Charlotte.
fun to watch
Good enough to quiet a craving. Not good enough to create one.
Not as good as I expected. I ordered the fried oyster to start and was completely displeased. The service was not that great as well. Not returning anytime soon
Pizza is good.  Got the pasta and it was bland not thrilled with the salad either
Good atmosphere, food is very good and I would give 4 stars but service was slow to\nto arrive at our table and we waited nearly 45 minutes for a burger. Staff is very pleasant!
Best burgers in Vegas hands down!
Last night was my first time there the fries were recooked with a bottle of salt and the veggie burger fell apart....35 dollars later for two no thank you my last time
The food here is great, wonderful american-asian infusion.
highly recommended to eat a burger. i bet everything is good... this was my first time but for sure will go back and try the rest in their menu. ronin burger was extraordinary... fries was great and the dipping sauce!
Loved this place! I went here with my boyfriend for our first time and we just loved it here!
Burger GODS~  Flew in from Minnesota to have a burger, worth the flight!  Can't wait to come back!
Best burger ever! Homemade bun so soft and somewhat like Hawaiian bread. Truffle fries are amazing!
My hubby and i love the kiki burger
I love the food here. The oxtail fries is a must and the $26 Shogun Burger was worth every bite!
Good food great old school hip hop high ass prices....definitely different items ..like ox tail fries,  different.
BOBA TEA! That's all I visit this place for. I can't get enough of the milk teas & smoothies with boba!
Eh pizza is alright. Not a crazy fan of but it could also be because they took AN HOUR to deliver when we are 5 mins away.
Portions are less and the prices are substantially more. :( \n\nLove the food and the atmosphere but with the rising costs, my visits become less frequent.
Out of all the Korean food that I have tasted so far, Soyo has the best. Their bulgogi is the best!!! I love their atmosphere as well. The people are extremely friendly and the pricing is not the bad. This place is definitely five stars.
Fantastic food, eat there frequently, very good service, my wife and I enjoy Soyo evdrytime we go
Slow internet connection. No coffee available downstairs (constantly out). Breakfast was gross. Room was clean so that was a plus. But as a business traveler coffee and internet are foundation.
I've been going to this office for about 2 years now and each experience I've had has been a positive one. The staff is fabulous and I've never had a problem getting in for an appointment when it's time for my checkup.
I LOVE Couture Clips!  What a wonderful groomer - I have 2 shih tzu's and she did an amazing job.  I've been looking for a great mobile groomer for a LONG time and I finally found one!
We first came here to the emergency room for my wife.  Today she had an outpatient surgical procedure.  We are very pleased with this hospital.  The staff is excellent and caring.  We are glad to have such a good facility close to home
Great food and fast service. Loved the chicken fried noodles.
I love this place the noodles are hand made, great prices, large portions, super quick and friendly staff !
A well deserved 5 star restaurant. Cheap and authentic. Fresh pulled noodles everyday. Fast service, lots of space and clean environment.
This place is amazing! Generous portions and a great price! Service is okay, not the best but I def keep coming back because of the food!
Had the cold pig ears, pork noodle dish, and pan fried dumplings.  Meh, it was okay but not worth going back.
Check in on Yelp and get 20% of services.
I have been back here a few more times. When Mimi is not available, I have seen a few other techs. All of them are very friendly, and I leave happy every time! Love this spot! Thanks guys :)
I feel that this is one of the healthier choices for frozen yogurt.  The location is convenient although parking can be very tight.  The price per ounce has significantly increased lately which is why I give it 3 stars.
I have a spicy chicken mayo and pineapple baguette once a day. You'd think it would really work, but IT DOES. \nP.S. My brother says their sweet chilli chicken panini rocks his balls
This was the worst restaurant I have ever been to. Service was atrocious and food was bland. On my enchiladas they didn't even use real cheese. Waited over 20 minutes to get silverware and a drink refill.
I have taken my pup, Buena, here many times for both doggie day care and boarding over the weekend.  The owners/staff are always happy to see us and always take good care of Buena.  Best part is she comes home totally exhausted!
Nothing special.  Had their basic burger w fries/sweet potato fries.  It wasn't bad, but nothing makes me really want to go back. If you're in Scottsdale, try Indulge Burger instead.
Good (but weak) drinks and typical bar food. Still, a decent place to grab some grub before a show at Comedy Zone!
Food was okay it earned the 2 stars. The wait staff is horrible. Had to ask for silverware, had to ask for napkins and I had to walk up my cup for a refill.
Great service.  Good food. Great naan.
Delicious, not heavy or greasy, perfect spice, great service! We had it for take out and will definitely return, yumm!
This is a good restaurant for quick Chinese. Today the kids were rather disappointed because the orange chicken was cold and didn't have much sauce. We come here often and this was a rather lackluster visit. I hope it will be better next time.
The Best Burger I have had in Las Vegas!!!!
We've ordered cupcakes from Treehouse on two occassions.  We've had lemon blueberry, vanilla, chocolate, and churro.  All were wonderful.  The mini cupcakes are the perfect bite.  Highly recommend.
Spicy tuna roll is pretty good, big pieces of tuna, not the usual mayo mix. Nice sushi chefs, good happy hour prices, not a large sushi selection though.  (They did tell me they were in the process of expanding it.)
This place is bomb!!! Love kimchi fried rice + 4 skewers!! HEAVEN!
Subway needs to watch its back. Comparable prices, better quality, and outstanding selection put Which Wich ahead of the game. And might I recommend the Wicked?
Fun and silly place to spend a couple of hours. Learned more about mustard than I needed to or ever thought I would. Especially great on a cold and wet day.
Simpsons Arcade game!\nProp Cycle!\nMusic games!\nWHAT MORE DO YOU WANT FROM THEM!!!\nShut up and give them your money!
Too bad they're closed on sunday. Definitely better than mcdonalds. I love this place!
Kind of like a one night stand, quick, dirty, cheap and you feel like crap in the morning.
This place always has a long ass line. I don't understand it. I wish they could improve their service somehow.
The place has a cool atmosphere and people are generally nice but beware of the incredibly slippy tile floors - not even kidding. Also, the area with the DJ is far too small so don't expect to stay on the dance floor unless you want to feel like a sardine
Had a great time with friends here a couple months ago.  I'm headed back to vegas in 2 weeks. If we run out of ideas for things to do we'll be sure to hit this place up again.
Great food and great service!
Favorite Indian food in AZ. The staff is friendly, my father is a regular and they know him by name. Buffet is so good, and it tastes so flavorful. The naan is also very good and my favorite.
If you want original Indian food this is the place. It might seem a little weird in the beginning but this place is amazing. I love the buffet but specially the vegetarian food is delicious. Best place in town. With their amazing mango like ice cream.
Review pending.
I have never been to one of these chains before.  So stopped in for lunch to pick up a salad to go.  A plethora of options for salads, which is the point of a salad buffet.  Decent price and it was super clean (always important).
I've been here twice and had a brilliant time on both occasions! I would recommend a day bed! Great venue, great music, great weather, great staff! The best day party in Vegas!
Best pool party in Vegas hands down. Back in the day Rehab was the spot now this is the go to. Great crowd, great Dj's.
It's a record store. One of the only in Las Vegas. \nIf I ever pair for media, I'l likely buy it here.
Service was great! Staff was very polite and we were seen right away. My daughter seen Dr. Hill who was very kind and made her laugh. Would recommend.
The Philly sandwich on a 50 cent hotdog bun was $15 and not good at best. I would recommend moving on for the next place if you need lunch and it's not a fast stop to boot.
Such an awesome show. So much fun to be had. The music is great, the dancing is outstanding and the comedy is top rate.
Don't waste your money on this. The show is boring and has not real dance move like they had on Americas best dance crew. Total money Wasted
not bad but not that good we expected! It was OK! compare to Chris Angle show, this one was better!
The crystal veg is a great roll! Can be pretty loud but very good sushi. love the little cave like booths in the back. Great for 4 people.
Terrible! went there for lunch.\nSushi had only rise, I had a hard time finding or tasting the fish. Rise was undercooked. Wasted my time and money. I suggest you Try New Zealand, although their location is not as prime.
Great sushi!  Great service. Great atmosphere. They have real nice private seating that you should try out for date night. \n   Also - the 100%best shrimp sauce !
Very good food and service! High recommend the prime rib sandwich, the best I have ever tasted!
Loved the atmosphere, excellent music, very cool patrons and staff.  The seaweed salad was excellent!
Nice place...we usually eat at the sushi bar.  Great sushi....We come here quite a bit and have always had great service. The regular bar area is always crowded.  A big happy hour crowd.  Love this place!
Wendy's is Wendy's. One of my favorites if I am forced to eat fast food. They were out of breakfast burritos, kinda upsetting because it was early in the morning. I was surprised by how good the sausage was ok the biscuit.
The receptionist is rude. About a minute after I checked in another client came in and was offered water or coffee. Seems like she picks and chooses who to be friendly to.
Yep, it appears closed for good.
The waitress we had here was horrible.  The bus boy gave us more attention than she did.  I say give him her job!  The food was OK nothing spectacular, a little over priced, but you are paying for the ambiance I guess.
Great bagels, amazing pickles, and decent prices. The staff here is always friendly. The bakery has a huge selection for treats to take home. I love Chompies for breakfast. Try one of their eggs Benedict plates. You won't be disappointed.
good selction of beer, but the service was blah.  food was not great, but sort of expect if from a more bar setting.  someone put a lot of money into the place, but they should care a bit more about what they put out now...
pizza dough was good but everything else was way too salty. Do they ever taste it before they serve foods?
Neighborhood Snow Cone Shack !!  It can be a long wait but well worth the it !!
Hands down, best yogurt in all of lv and I assure you, I've been to all of them. The pumpkin pie flavor is BOMB!!!
Best yogurt I've ever tasted. Wonderful consistency, not watered down. Clean toppings bar and a good selection at that! I hope they keep it up!! And the pumpkin pie flavor is DELISH!!
Place is alright but clearly it does not have the character if the rest of the southside.   I am a fan of Hofbrauhaus and Claddahs in here though.  Shopping is tired and the movie theatre is so so.
Long drive thru line. Gingerbread Latte tasted so watery I thought they gave me tea. The Caramel Brulee Latte was so strong, tasted more like black coffee.
this place is super inexpensive and really fast, great place to take a quick lunch break
I probably eat here way too much. But dang, it's so delicious! The club is the best! The staff is great; always friendly and efficient.
Love this theater...I prefer to drive here over Red Rock so much less crowded. \n\nIf only LBS and Yardhouse were here as well ;D
This has to be the worst cupcake I've ever tasted. I've had better cupcakes from the grocery store. every thing is over priced (even for Vegas). But I will say that the shakes are good.
Yummy!  Very good but Expensive sweets!  Come here for a late night sugar high or yummy sweet drinks
We walked in on a Sunday morning, we're seated immediately. The wait staff were excellent, as was the food.  We had 2 more join us and the waiter pulled over another table-no problem.  Some of the best service I have had in recent years in Vegas-sweet!
And by one star mean no stars!  Mediocre ice cream, it's cold and icy, but lacks in creamy deliciousness. The \"bottled water\" is simply tap water in a reused bottle. Total rip off.
Great customer service by knowledgable, friendly staff. Not true cheapest place in town but you get what you pay for. Highly quality tint and great service. Worth every penny, money well spent. I highly recommend them.
This is probably the best coffee shop in Summerlin. It's a bit pricey, but the drinks are solid, and the macaroons are to die for.
I decided to give this place another try. It was a mistake. They were selling expired baked goods out of their fridge case. Service was average. My friend complained that her latte was all milk and no espresso and the bottom of her croissant was visibly burned.
I love this place! Haven't had anything yet that I didn't like. Service is always outstanding and the prices are very reasonable. It's my go to for Chinese. In fact when my parents visit it's their request on where to eat lol!
If you're expecting quality food, prepare to be disappointed.  Even more disappointing was the obnoxious, drunk owner who incredibly used the \"N\" word while talking to us.  Unbelievable.
Very clean tanning salon.  They keep the towels in the back so don't forget to grab one before you start your session.  Friendly employees and great stand-up beds....never a wait.
Great decor, professional dealers, and lots of celebrity poker players here.  Definitely worth checking out!
By far one of the Top 5 poker rooms in Las Vegas. Plenty of tables, good action, and good overall room. My go to spot.
Very clean and comfortable poker room. The best in Vegas! Be sure to order the cappuccino with the swizzle stick sugar.. sooo good. Also they have all kinds of delicious drinks here :)
Free WiFi internet available.
Food is really good but incredibly noisy.  Couldn't hear person next to me at our 4 top.
The mac and cheese and the ginger gin drink was great. My wife didn't like whatever chicken dish she ordered but we'll be back.
Ate there last week, kind of high priced for the fare we ordered. I had the petite steak, they were right. Did not mind the small steak, but the sides were small & not creative, should have a potato, steamed veggies, or brown rice, for this dish.
Just as good the one in Scottsdale, AZ. Great bartenders, lots of TV and lots of great beer on tap.
I'll give this place A+++++
Love this place... If your looking for something new gotta try the bulgogi tacos, fusion lettuce wraps and all the burritos are killer good!! I definitely recommend this place highly!! You won't be disappointed!
Absolutely amazing place. Reasonably priced, friendly/attentive service, and great food. Don't review much, but this was worth remembering my yelp login.
Tried to go here twice. Both times closed. Won't waste my time anymore. They don't wanna keep a regular schedule they don't need my $
Great local bike and snowsports shop...they have everything you need to get on the road or the slopes and they have a incredible selection of trek and cannon sale bike and many kinda of boards and bindings!!   The service center is also very knowledgable and reliable!!!
Nice neighborhood. We spent the day here with our dogs and 4 year old. Had no issues with either park. We will be frequent visitors.
Their beer selection was super, but pricey!  I got a Yuengling and it cost $4.75.  Hmm?  The service was pretty good and the food was alright, it just seemed a little overpriced.
Great selection of beer. Plenty of it! The food is so-so. Typical bar-food. Very nice wait-staff and bar tenders. Large enough place to accommodate a busy night. Worth the stop.
They make mulled wine on demand. Just ask. Yes, even after Christmas is over!\nThat sums up how great the service is, and the atmosphere or menu won't leave you disappointed either.
When I'm in the mood for a good hotdog this is the place to go. Always friendly staff and consistently great food. Slightly expensive for what it is but totally worth it. Thanks Luke's!
Love it.  I can share because of larger portion.  Good meat....good everything.
They have a grill for those steaks that u are craving for. Typical ham and roast beef! It was good for the price and for my boys who are at that age they can't stop eating.
The last time I was there, They had the nerve to want to charge me for a to-go water for $.99 cent. F**** this place. I just got done dishing out $8.50 for lunch, then that was the icing on the cake.
Food was great! Service was pretty good over all great time
For nearly $8 for a turkey club i was severely dissapointed when the bread ended up being stale and hard. And you could totally tell that the cheese was the cheap processed american slices type. Walking in it seems like they sacrificed quality food for a showy appearance.
I used to love it. Now their tea is watered down and no taste. Their sandwiches are of lesser quality and they no longer have the things they need to make it. The have run out of supplys like no more Boba no more chicken. Just annoying.
OK for a quick breakfast. No one can mess up a nova lox sandwich. Bottomless drinks are a plus.
Great concept and awful hours. I like the bolanis being served right now, they're savory and one of the best ways to warm yourself up in the winter.
Stopped in at 5:30 for a quick dinner. Place was nearly empty except for a few regulars at the bar. Service was prompt and the food was fine. Nothing too remarkable.
Clean shop with friendly staff.\n\nYou are not allowed to shoot certain types of firearms there unless you are a member (Class-3 & shotguns, for example) -  The person I spoke to about this could not explain \"why\" they had this rule.
I thought it was a joke when I called inquiring about patio dining sets, and the guy who answered my call told me he didn't have a \"definitive answer on whether they did or did not\".....what the heck??!!!??
Great korean owned restaurant, server was very attentive and helpful
had the #6 and also an order of wings. for the price it was great. it was good but not great. on the plus side, its 24 hours.
Don't bother with the grilled chicken it was mostly bread, the club was better and whats the deal with refills.
Very Clean tasting. Pleasing meal.
We ordered ramen with pork and the pork was just too fatty.  I didn't understand why they chose pork belly.  The broth was okay, wasn't awesome and wasn't terrible.  I'll stick with something other than ramen and try something else next time.
The ramen and the fried rise are amazing the only bad thing is the service was rude
The best ever! Everything about this place is awesome! Kimchee rice++
So good. So cheap. So perfect.
This place ROX ! The ramen was so good and flavorful but sometimes the ramen comes lukewarm. Maybe because there are too many people sometimes ?
Small hole in the wall place, worth searching for. Limited menu, awesome place if you're craving for ramen.  Small menu, very reasonable.  every time I've been there I had to wait about 15 min.worth the wait
Compared to Sora Ramen, I like this much better.  We had the thin noodles and they were al dente. The broth was also thicker and tastier. Try the takana fried rice (with mustard greens). It was also very tasty!
Great food, attentive staff, fast service. Expect a long wait Friday and Saturday nights to be seated.....especially if its a rainy day perfect for noodles.
This place was alright to me. Not the best ramen but not the worst either. I've had better but this could work if you need a quick fix on a budget.
Basic chinese food, you're getting exactly what you pay for duh. Close to my home, quick run, lots of food for the price!
Phenomenal BBQ! We had the brisket sandwich and the Smokin Plate. Everything exceeded our expectations. I'm only sorry that we don't live closer!
Not the best in any town. Went for dinner and everything was in foil on warmers. Will not return.
The show was the standard onion volcano and spinning eggs. The food was nothing special as it went from bland to weirdly seasoned back to bland. \nAwesome wait staff helped the score but the price and overall food experience means I most likely return.
OK place, pleasant staff.  Average burger.  Better than the other big burger chains.  But not 5 Guys or In-N-Out
I deducted 2 stars because the yogurt was not that frozen - actually kind of runny and melted fast.  Otherwise, a fun place and fun staff.
Great frozen yogurt, good prices. Tons of topping choices, staff is always nice, love the retro feel of the inside.
Love the rewards card!
Went here because of a Groupon.  $14 for 14\" five topping, bread sticks, and two pints domestic.  Great deal, great service, but for a pizza place the pizza was very sub par.
I love this place!!!  They are very hard working therapists that offer massage for extremely reasonable prices.  I can afford to be a regular here because of the low cost.
This place rocks! Best Sicilian style pizza in Las Vegas by far. Get the naked city and add meatballs. Meatballs and sausage are made in house and you will be able to tell immediately. Hardcore!!! Slayer on juke box while writing this!!
Not worth the wait if you go with a big party.
The bun bo hue was great but the egg rolls were spoiled We had to tell them to take it back...gross.
Very fresh and Fast service.The Pho broth is perfect.The food is clean and the place is clean.What best you can expect from all Pho or Vietnamese restaurant.The only thing that did not get 5 star from me is the ambiance.Yes for restaurant is count.
Not very friendly! I mailed a package today and had my 2 young kids with me and they rushed me out of the way at the self kiosk so they could help someone else.
Everyone there is so pleasant.
Wow I can not believe the POOR service I received from John. This place is not worth your time it looks nice from the outside but that's it. If you want to pay for over priced Mexican than waste your money here if not go somewhere that is worth it.
Disappointing.  After reading the positive reviews,  we gave Vida a try for dinner.  I agree with another reviewer that it was subpar.  Better choices are out there
Tasty guac. strong drinks. In the heart of Downtown Charlotte day and night life.\n\n- Fresh Guacamole\n- White Sangria\n- Negra Modelo on draft
July 26, 2014...first time here, awesome food, great server, cold coronas! We were a party of 6 and they took excellent care of us. Great time and a great location in the bottom of Epicenter.
Incredibly good bread, pastries, and coffee.  The croissants and baguettes are just like what you can buy in France.
Great atmosphere with the French maitre d'. The food is nothing special but the atmosphere always makes us go back. Fixed menu is good value. Mostly have to book as it gets very busy.
Really good soups.\nGreat place to get caught up on work and grab a bit e at the same time
The breakfast is consistently great here at a reasonable price, and if you go to the Val Vista and Baseline store the customer service you will get from Hector is second to none
best apple experience ever! Super quick and easy. I had a broken screen and was given a brand new phone under warranty. Byrd is the best, very friendly and knowledgable !!
Every time I have called to book an appointment I've been put on hold forever. Also, when I've gone in, I've been told to come back much later. DISLIKE
Delicious yogurt that was better than Yogurtland. Great flavors. It's been a long time since chocolate froyo has been done right. Loved the Honeydew. Pecan pie was great! Ill be back!
Located in the Riveria, If you find yourself at the end of the strip this place actually has a good breakfast.
Bequeme Umgebung + guter Preis: idealer Treffpunkt f\u00fcr Studenten. Meine Lieblingsspeise bei Kippe ist SchniPo ^^
Gerade hier einen erdbeerbecher gegessen,sehr lecker,bestes vanille und erbeereis und frische erdbeeren
Great food. Kind of pricy for the portions but it is great food!! Makes you feel good about what you are eating!!
Service was awesome. Biblical breakfast was super yummy. Can't wait to go back and try lunch!  Check their Facebook page for specials. Iced coffee had coffee ice cubes how smart!
Randomly stopped by while in Charlotte and had the best curry / hummus I have ever tasted. I wish they could ship their food to sf so I could eat it all day!
Wow! The vanilla chia pudding is great.
Great food! Very interesting concept for those that are not vegetarian! Great taste! The only negative feedback, services is very slow. It takes too long to bring the food or get anything from the waiters.
This place is slow
I would not trust anyone but Connie to watch my dog.  The pictures she has posted of her clients are so cute and adorable.   She is so flexible and when she has watched my dog in the past, I would always get a text message about how she was doing.  Great place highly recommend.
So einen schlechten D\u00f6ner hatte ich noch nie!\nDie vorigen Bewertungen kann ich nicht nachvollziehen, sorry
The best!  They've worked out all the kinks that were present in the first weeks they opened....back to great food, great service.  The sparkling sangria is a MUST.
Had a great time tonight, our server Mandy was fantastic, very sharp and on point with our order!! I am sitting in her section from now on.
Not the same as Famiglia in NYC AND double price. Tasted like some typical hotel-cantina dog-food-flavored Sbarro.
The absolute worst Arbys. They shorted me 2 deluxe sandwhiches and when i called after driving 10 minutes home. The manager pretended not speak english. Not worth driving back over there. Stay away!!!!!
The food isn't to bad.  Its a great local bar.  Very friendly and great bartenders.
War am Samstag dort 100 Jahre Malerei, war sehr sch\u00f6n, selbst die Kinder fanden es spannend, habe einige Photos dazu hochgeladen, viel Spass
Located in a new shopping center in NW Phoenix.  I had the Blimpie Best Combo and the food was good, staff was fast and friendly... overall it was a good lunch.
Wow..... We really changed things up and ate an early dinner at the bar!  Fred is awesome... And attentive to excellent customer service!
Great service and great food.  We had salmon and peel and eat shrimp and both were wonderful.  The service was quick and friendly with great attention to our needs.  Our first trip here but not our last
The food was bland and portion small and cost high.
I give this place a-ok
Some of the best Mexican near Charlotte , been here millions of times only giving a four because I had one really bad experience
my food had no flava.......& my lava cake was burnt!!!!
My favorite food truck I've tried in the city! The hot dogs are unique, the people working are nice, and you definitely get enough food for $6. Try the Igby!
Absolutely amazing! Brings a whole new dimension to hot dogs. Only the best ingredients and cooked to perfection. I had no idea that a dog this different could be so wonderful - Simply Outstanding
Unfortunately this place has closed.
The boba drink was terrible, but the shaved ice was good.
I love the field of green salad...\n\nservice not so much the bar lags on EVERY drink!!!\n\nother than that its a good place to go if your in fountain hills...
Disappointed today. This is usually a favorite. Wait for food was long, bottom of Reuben was soggy. And my husband didn't get 1000island dressing w his.  Great service and food when we've eaten there before. Don't know what was going on.
put it this way...  when your signature food is chicken fingers...  your food sucks.  Good hangout spot for watching games though. Lots of tvs
Poop. Poor service. Poor staffing. Had an issue there about a month when.........finally someone spoke with me he was a total jerkoff for lack of a better word. Almost certain his last name was Corona.
Good food but don't call the same day for reservations.  They are rude on the phone and are not helpful when you do call. Not good customer service.
I like the prices for beer. The food is ok, definitely not awful. The atmosphere is fun and everyone is very friendly.
Incompetent manager that wasn't able to cancel an order on one card so it could be put on another card....luckily for this place there is no competition so their customer service can be as poor as they want it to be
the service is excellent. the food is some of the best Mediterranean food I've had, particularly in Pittsburgh. the falafel salad is light and delicious and the pastistio is perfection.
Enjoyed a healthy and delicious lunch from a very diverse menue.  Delightful attention and atmosphere...Highly recommend the alternative experience.  I'll definitely return....
This restaurant is NOW closed. OUT-of-Business. R.I.P.
Always like butter, love the BBQ sauce!
rolled tacos and bean burrito for xmas breakfast.\nfree wifi, cold water.\nnot busy\nshould be, very few places open today.\nworth a try
Not great but worth revisiting! The grilled chicken sandwich was awesome!
Gotta agree with the praise for Los Gemelos. Great $3 sopes, tasty tacos too! All freshly made that should be freshly made. Contento!
Classrooms are dated...\nIs overflow from George Square...\nCobble and stone charm...
If you enjoy over paying for mediocre food and horrendous service Graze is the place for you.
Good food! It can be a little expensive, but quality. The cheese curds were worth the buy. They have a good happy hour, but otherwise, I've never been here for a meal. As a student and then young professional starting out, it was just too expensive.
Great food, good atmosphere, just a little bit pretentious.
My roommate and I bring our 3 dogs here to play at least 3 days a week. We love the doggie water fountains, trees, the amount of available shade and seating. Everyone in my house can realistically spend hours enjoying this park. Thank you.
We take our dog Dakota there every weekend and sometimes during the week. The best time to go is early morning when other dogs are there to play! You will see the same people and dogs routinely which is also a plus. Very clean too! Highly recommend for those who live close by!
Staff is awesome. Food is yummy. My kids love smashburger.  I prefer some other places, but their food is still tasty.
Food was pretty good. My smash fries didn't have much on them, tasted almost like reg fries. And the girl who brought us our food was rude when my girlfriend asked for more mayo.
the ceviche was a delight. We went here for our anniversary, and were not disappointed at all. Everything was fresh and delicious
Very good foie gras and pork belly over rice.  Price is decent compares to San Francisco.  Great service located in a unique location.  Reservation yes.  Great cocktail and sake menu.  For sure not for kids.  I will come back .
Reviews are pretty much right on. Stiff drinks, good prices for happy hour. Appetizers are pretty much canned salsa and cheap tortilla chips, served on Plastic plates. On par with what Dennys would serve if they were a mexican joint.
Absolutely not. My drink was weak as hell. Tastes like sour lime juice and ice. It's decor is great but whyyyyy is everything over-priced?
Not bad, service was on the slower side, but then again it was lunch time 12-1pm but very friendly and quick cashier
Love Paletas Betty!! Great location & unique flavors. My favorite are the limon, and the mango con chile. My dog loves the perroleta. Stop by and support this local business!!
Great dessert option to keep things light. Flavors are special and unique. Tried the arroz con leche and it is delicious tasting like horchata or rice pudding with cinnamon.
The food is very good and the atmosphere is great.
I'm addicted! Everyone there is so freakin nice. And Maui dogs are delicious.
Poor attempt at nachos. Chips (half plate) cheese n onions for 8 bucks? Sad at best...
Nice cozy atmosphere, friendly service, and a drink like the Campfire Mocha?  Sign me up!  It's basically like a coffee s'more in a cup, and oh so snugly wugly feeling on a dreary day.  Try it!
Coffee is better than most and yes they do a good flat white, but as mentioned in other reviewers notes, service is not up to it...unfriendly and not interested in giving their customers an all round experience.
Only 8 lanes and they are over priced.\nHate the concept of reserving lanes.\nDecent music and crowd.
They took over the old Donut Queen location.  The lamb burgers are the best.  Very good vegetarian selection.
Best margaritas in town!\n\nFood is affordable & very delicious! Best chicken tacos I've ever had!
Service staff was a mess. Food presentation was poor. Food quality was poor - B.A.L.T. was soggy and oozing all over.
The food was good, but nothing extraordinary. My husband loved the chocolate shake.  Service was good.
As you walk in it smells like chocolate! Delectable treats at every turn. I had the steak sandwich with waffle fries...yum! Aioli was a great and accompanied the fries well.
Great food.  Great drinks.  Great service.  Get a hot chocolate to go.  Sooooo good.
Amazing waffle fries, perfectly crispy and fluffy on the inside. Mozzarella Tomato add avocado Panini, perfect. Chocolate Hazelnut shake with an add shot cake vodka (per server recommendation), delicious!!! Love their theme, presentation, and service.
Yummy veggie noodle soup... Veggie spring rolls and shrimp rolls are delicious... Lightly fried... Glad my family enjoyed it and they say that Vegas doesn't have good thai food..
Cheap prices.great food..noodle dishes are what you order here
They juicy burgers in my favorite mall....  What can't I love?  The seating area for five guys was a little dirty, so I sat in the food court.    FRIES!!!
It was pretty much what I expected except for the mermaids. Kind of a let down not to see them but still nice to see and very relaxing to sit next to with the pro shop waterfall in the background. Overall it was a nice change from the overcrowded strip for a change.
If you want dumplings, this is the place.  If not, dumplings are all they have.  This is CASH ONLY despite what Yelp lists.  It's in Chinatown where the restaurants are not all real clean.  This one falls in the middle.
awful service. the guy always find excuses to prevent you from paying by credit card. food quality is nowhere near satisfactory
Ok.. Very dirty restaurant front and kitchen. \nAlso took 30 mins for simple dumplings. Think they were flown in from Queens.
Overpriced, hidden fees, bad service, dirty
Average and quite pricey for a froyo. There a tons of new froyo that opens up around where I live and usually averages about $0.35/ounces. \n\nOn the other note, friendly staff and very clean place.
Tried my first poutine! Exactly what it says fries, gravy and bland little cheese balls. I think the rendition was good but the sentimental taste is better than it actually is.  Burger was average but on a nice roll. Street watching priceless!
Refried fries in stale oil, jelly like gravy and chicken so chewy that Goodyear wants the recipe.. Yep, if that is what you are looking for!
Greeted promptly... Ron III, was great!  very patient while my 3 year old jumped from bed to bed; and even played hide and seek with him...all while talking about what my options were.
I love this place!!! My husband and I claimed this to be our quick fix for dinner options!!
Eat, Drink, Party, Sleep. Repeat.
as a Portland metroer I fucking love this place!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11
The staff is the best....Thanks Ginger,  Brian,  Tamara and Jesse. The food is also Delish. Everything had been good.
My co-workers and I came here for lunch. We ordered the chicken nachos and found two long hairs in them. It was totally gross. Other than that the food is ok.
Awesome east coast style deli food with a fresh and healthy update, this is the best, we go there all the time
This is a wonderful family owned restaurant with amazing service. Bagels are the best! Both the breakfast and lunch menus are extensive and the kitchen is very willing to make any dietary exceptions you have.
Amazing veg!  Well worth stopping in for some great food & coffee!!!
New bar down town. Awesome patio bar and restaurant!  Helpful and cute servers.
Excellent appearance of completely tasteless food.  I went in pretty hungry and the large plate I got was really bland and the ingredients themselves appeared colorful, large and appetizing but Zero flavor!
My wife and I had these hot dogs last night. Absolutely delicious!!!!! All toppings r free, n nicely presented for a 3.00 hot dog. Definitely a must for late night munchies
Spirit airline We had nothing but delays both ways and they were two hour delays the plane was not clean I have nothing good to say about them I would get another airline or would walk over taking then again, plus there was a cup in my chair covered in gum ewwwwww
Never again. Wish I had read these reviews first.
Terrible. Dirty airline. Charges ridicules fees for carry-on's.\nThe upgraded service is expensive and not worth the cost.\n\nPlease fly another airline. Jet Blue is a better service.
Never flying this lousy airline ever again. \n\nThey screw you over at every opportunity.\n\nI wish there was a way to give zero stars.
Yeah...not flying this airline again. Cheap tickets aren't that cheap after everything is said and done. Website sucks. Online check in was an unnecessary hassle.
3 out 4 delays in 6 month period that's unacceptable . We are gonna find a different airline
hands down the worst airline I have ever flown on. they have a sneaky fee policy for everything, and the customer service is horrendous. the customer is never right and if you argue too much they'll deny your boarding pass. I will never fly with them again!
Just very bad all around.   Checkin was complicated, charged for a standard carrying and crew at departure gate was CLUELESS!!!  Extremely unprofessional with lots chaos and loud conversations in what looked like a very standard boarding group!
It's Burger King, there's not much to say, but this is a nice, clean location. Good service, 24 hours and they have my favorite drink of all time... VAULT soda on tap lol.
Perfect service, polite staff, clean restaurant, excellent Pho with perfect broth! We just stopped here on our way back from Arizona because we were craving Pho...everyone is satisfied with their dish!
Fantastic service with friendly smiling staff from the moment I walked in. Atmosphere is bright and clean. Incredibly fast service with deliciously fresh flavors. So worth the drive!
Apparently they don't have room for new customers, but they do have a list of competitors you can have but they don't know how well these guys work so that's really of no use. Sorry you're too busy! I'll find my own company.
Went recently, and the sushi did not seem as fresh as I remember. I am not sure I would go back.
Best baseball/ softball park ever, I love the people that work there and play there everyone is like family. The beer is always good to have when your playing with friends great park.
The grilled pineapple is a delicious addition to the adobada taco!
delicious!
Sorry but I have a different opinion. They give you mostly hard meat. Not real meat and it's not worth the price
Great spot. Worth the wait n the $$$. The carne asada was great n el pastor meat delicious.
The asada tacos are so good! The best I've had in Vegas. Just order them the way they come. Only $2 each, and the service was super quick even though they were really busy.
Their food is okay, but they continuously change their menu and business name. It's very very irritating and confusing. I am done ordering from this place.
this looks so good! but i dont know where the menu is!!!!!!
This is our favorite breakfast place. The food is good. They have the best biscuits & gravy of any restaurant I have eaten at. The wait staff is friendly. The only complaint I have is that Sunday mornings are packed, so there can be a wait to be seated.
It was good, big portions, with tasty biscuits.
Can I just say I love Brandon and so do our two silky terriers! He came as referral and I'm so thrilled to have found him. He's so flexible, kind and does a great job every single time. I love that he is a cage free groomer :)
Didn't think that it was all that. The food was a little bland and uninspired, but that seems to be the state of Mexican food here in Vegas... Seriously, do I have to go to Del Taco to get a good chicken taco?
The rolled tacos were like chewing hard rubber and the carne asada burrito had a stale tortilla around bland meat.\n\nHaving enjoyed Robertos in other cities, I was very disappointed in the quality here and will not be back.
We stopped by on a whim. Mistake. 25 minutes between appetizer and main course. No explanation. No apology. Food was good, but not worth that kind of wait!
One of the best local places, they serve big and juicy pieces! And not to mention their fries! They might be a bit thin but they're really good and taste fresh.
If you get lucky to snag on of the 4 or 5 tables out on the balcony overlooking Freemont Street you have scored.  $3.25 for a cocktail.  Great place to rest your weary feet for awhile.
This is a great little butcher shop. I have come in several times, mainly on a whim and usually during Thanksgiving looking for a turkey, and have always been pleasantly surprised by the quality of the meats they have present.\n\nI will continue to return.
I completely dig this grocery, well as much as a dude can dig a grocery store.  I just happen to always go here because it is so close.
Like the food but what is it about this location and the music. Always way too loud. The staff is friendly but don't go here expecting to be able to chat with the people you are having lunch with. Some days it's like being at a Nine Inch Nails concert.
Can't wait for my weekly (ok - sometimes daily) coffee or Chai fix :-)  Great coffee, atmosphere and relaxing.  Amber is a great barista :-)  Try it; you'll definitely be back.
Lots of great information by a guide who knows a lot about the mob history of Vegas. Unsure exactly the real need for the bus, but I guess it's like a mini-theater. We enjoyed the info - the drive wasn't really necessary.
This is the only place I trust to do my waxing services. They have a nice relaxing facility with friendly and skilled staff.  I've been to a few other salons and the European Wax chain (horror show!), nothing compares in quality or comfort.
How do you get iced coffee wrong? I asked to have to coffee sweetened , and now I taste rock sugar that's not melted in my coffee! :( what a disappointment .
My favourite boutique in Montreal! The clothes have a vintage twist and it is cheap for the quality and unicity you get. Great accessories too.
I had the salmon and he had the pasta with chicken, both were great, make sure you say hi to Jackson he's great, oh and ask for Mathew at the bar outside.
This place is very busy till about mid nite then you have a good shot at getting a place to sit.
This Starbucks is great. It's usually pretty busy because the location but it has a drive thru which is very convenient. It's also close to my home and it's a few cents cheaper then the Starbucks in Von's up the street.
This is best the Thai restaurant I've been to in Edinburgh and has quite a unique take on a few classic dishes that works out really well in my opinion. Their Pad Thai is the best I've ever had. Being a basement restaurant it has a nice dark, cosy atmosphere.
Artie swung by when I was in a jam, promptly fixed the problem, and was incredibly professional. He's fantastic!
Wow...Ice cream benihanas! Ice cream made before your eyes on a ice pan. End result was great tasting fresh ice cream. Great Experience...take the kids and enjoy!
Very yummy food, great service, the owner really cares about his customers and their wants/needs. Highly recommend for quality Mediterranean food!
Today I had tne best hair cut of my life.  The place is cute the people and clients were very nice. My hair cut is excelent and the message was a very pleasent suprise
Just had a taste of the Ribeye Bistecca. (thanks Jan & Dave) awesome great flavour.
Pretty good drive-thru car wash, nothing out of the ordinary.  However, I was able to purchase ultd washes for the month for only $10 which is awesome!!! :)
closed - out of business!!!
The location is great (being in the centre of Places des Arts), and the decor is great. They have really good cocktails but the food is just below average. Go there for the drinks and the ambience, not for the food.
While it wasn't 'bad', there are far better places to have an enjoyable meal in the area, even if you want to catch a game.  We went once.  We saw.  We haven't been back.
It was alright. Sort of a mix between Buffalo Wild Wings and The Outback. Pretty noisy and only one steak on the menu, but the burger was decent.
If you choose this place, sit at the bar. Good place to watch sports. Menu finally revised and not so dark inside. Try it again if you were disappointed before.
I would like to give a review but they were out of mostly all the great goodies that were recommended to me, therefore I will have to go back after the holiday.
The food was mediocre compared to the Taiwanese type food I have at home. Mostly the same dishes but different flavor... I will not come back here.
I used to go here a lot... But then the staff changed and the bartenders just suck now. I still like the waitresses. Its a shame they have to deal wit slow bartenders now.
Been waiting for nearly an hour for our food and still no sign of it. When I asked what the problem was I was told  \"our normal cook is on vaca\".  Terrible service today!!!
Visited Stacks and Yolks for the first time today and the food was delicious and plentiful!  The service was prompt and attentive, and the restaurant was clean. I will definitely be back.
My God! This place keeps getting better and better!!! Even when they're so busy that the line is out the door around the corner!!!!
The food is ok. Had a really good dish just once & the other few times it wasn't anything special. The food takes a pretty long time to get to the table and there are always flys in the restaurant. The staff is nice.
Very good take out chinese food. Reasonably priced and we got tons of food. We were very happy with our order. I belive we had the take out special for 4 and it was around 45 delivered. Delivery was very quick
Had my car towed recently by these guys... Customer service is not something they are told to have... Got picked and the moron driving had such an attitude... Never would I use these guys again!
Solid chicken pad Thai and a good bang for your buck for the amount you get. Sweet lunch special for like 7 bucks I think. This is my go-to for quick Thai that is always solid.
Finally found my Thai place! Great food, decent prices and a rewards card for regulars?! Sweet. Found this place last week, ate there 3 times already, love it!
3 hour wait for reinstatements. I dont know how they work the queue here..6 people ahead of me for almost 2 hours. Will go to another DMV location next time.
This car wash does not open at seven opens at 730 this is the third time I've been to this car wash the never open on time based off of this website or the time posted that they have on other sites as well
Another Sprinkler repair Co. that did not show. I finally called Sprinkler Man he was right on time and fixed it fast
Eli and his crew are great. They take great care in making my yard look the way I want it. and Eli follows up after every visit to make sure I'm happy and get feedback. I highly recommend them.
Terrible experience and service! If you order food during happy hour, check the pricing! The waitress wouldn't correct her mistake and kept on giving excuses. Not cool....
The chicken tacos are great I hate them two days in a row since I am not out here much.
Not the best nor the worst.
The sushi is great. Everytime I go the staff is friendly and very helpful. Downside the price is a little high.
Cheap covered parking and the shuttles get you to the airport in minutes...if you book online you can get it for even cheaper.
YUM! I love their vegetable broth and garnishes and everything! Great service(FAST) and great food! What more is there to say?
Way over priced. Bartender is cute in the face but clearly miserable. Beer tap selection is far & wide though!
In bar waiting no service just stupid  need new management
No wifi. Very small, low ceilings. Equipment is very close together.
5 stars for sure!, this place has the best 'char siew' in town.  It's lean and just enough sauce without drowning it like most other places make the mistake of doing.
I had an issue with plumbing and did needed it fixed that evening.  Service was quick (only had an hour window) an problem was fixed quickly.  I definitely recommend Freddy Fox Rooter
great mixology drinks very creative,  look for Groupon 2 for 1 drinks, good atmosphere, i would recommend if you are downtown and just wanted to hangout and listen to some breakin beats
So so food. Had to send back a sandwich twice. But they were very nice about it. I agree with who ever posted the comment a few weeks ago about them putting up stickers blighting the neighborhood on street signs and light poles.
The lasagna was ok, the meat was good but it was a light on the tomato sauce. My husband had the chicken parm hero which was good. Our server recommended the Alfredo which I wish I would have gotten.
Horrible service. Good food. But horrible service.
I will echo the comments of everyone else. This was a pretty cool statue in the middle of an industrial park, although it technically is a fountain. I wouldn't go out of my way to see it but if you are in the area it's worth the stop.
We've popped by for happy hour a few times. Great prices. Love the wings! Great atmosphere, especially when it's patio weather.
This restaurant doesn't exist anymore. It was replaced by another Chinese restaurant and there is no buffet (all-you-can-eat) option.
Great airport bar that is quick and easy...and good  Def recommend if your waiting for a plane outta charlotte!
The Angus Reserve Burger at $12 was a frozen patty cooked to whatever the chef feels like cooking.  If you looking for food or drinks there are other places in Pittsburgh.  Come on Tap room, how many local breweries are located around Pittsburgh.  Update your selection
I would definitely recommend going to the waddell/litchfield location. This location always seems to be a little dirty and disorganized.
Zero stars. Really disappointed at the \"deal\" we got for pizza. Pizza is marginal at best and felt we got sold a bill of goods as we spent way too much for what we got.
Wow, busy place!  Lots of bar space, good place to hang out and drink. Drew is the best bartender!!
fun joint, right on the strip you can people watch, get hammered, DJ booth coming soon right on the patio \"I heard\" this is a deff go to place during the summer!
I'm here everytime I visit Las Vegas (and I'm here often) I absolutely love it. The bartenders are always friendly the food is awesome I've had wings and burgers here. The atmosphere is amazing highly recommend This place for sure
Sat around for 15 min a guy came around to ask us to drink... Gave us water and took forever to even come by to ask what we wanted fuck this shit no good service what so ever
The quality of sushi was excellent.  That was the only good thing about this place.  There is no reason on this earth that it should take over 45 min to get 2 rolls and I nigiri.   Terrible service.  Nearly walked out.  Also a bit noisy.
I found this restaurant late at night, and it was really awesome. The chicken was amazing, but the potato balls with rice and sweet sauce were the best things I ate in Montreal.
This is a great, quality Taco Bell recently built with fast service and consistant food. I love Taco Bell because it's cheap and yummy!
Robert Reeves is a fantastic DWI attorney. He is a zealous advocate for his clients and always does his best to obtain a favorable outcome.
This place is always such helpful to me The employees greet you when you first walk in the door they are helpful to and it's always nice in the store this is by far my favorite Walgreens in Las Vegas I recommend everyone to come and check this one out
Cupcakes were decent but nothing I'd go out of my way for. Cake part was more on the dry side and the icing was crazy sweet. I may return but it will only be to try the macaroons.
Shouldn't the 15 minutes be already up for the cupcake?
Food was not good.  Made Teach Bell taste like 5 star.  Carnitas were so tough they were like old jerky.  Will never be back!
Many flavors and great choice of toppings\nOnly 39 cents/oz\nStaff was kind and helpful as well\nDefinitely recommend this place for a good yogurt
Here for dinner with my family.  We were staying at the Pointe Hilton Squaw Peak Resort.  Nice location, casual dining.  Good menu with choices.  Service was OK, food fairly well prepared although lamb was overcooked for one of our party.  Overall, OK experience.
Their macaroons were okay. The first time i had them at a potluck they were really good. Thats the reason i decided  to go today and bought 3 diff flavors. I wasnt too happy about it. i think it was the texture of the cookie :/
Super slow service compared to other EBs. IlI go to the one on Sahara even though its 10 minutes out of the way next time.
Came here for the Belgian waffles, and we were not disappointed. Very good waffles. The whole family enjoyed it, would certainly be back.
Waffles were so good, but other breakfast items could make this place a hit. Also, not a large seating area.
Honest and upfront auto service. Always friendly and courteous. No false promises or pushy sales.
Small and ghetto. What more can I say. You will be bum rushed by panhandlers if the shirt your wearing looks clean and you are clean shaven. Area is sketchy so bring your glock!!
My two year old loves coming to Jumpstreet and his older cousins have a blast too.  I find it a good value for the amount of fun the kids have.
Great happy hour and fries are the best!!
Burgers are fairly good, albiet considerably overpriced considering that it doesn't include any sides. If you want fries, you'll have to order those separately. Thankfully, the spiked milkshakes are delicious.
Yo! I got a burger and peanut butter milkshake here! How fuckin rad is that! Peanut butter milkshake son! Burger was rad too!
The service is the BEST in town!  Did you know that this engine runs on veggie oil?  Good for your tummy and good for the environment.  An all around PERFECT experience.  Thank you Cpt. Bill
Do NOT waste your time to visit this restaurant.  Denny's quality food at top dollar prices.  Altough the service is fine... Bottom line, if you want to pay a inflated price for a fast food meal, eat at Addiction.
We came for my birthday dinner. The Ribeye was tender and juicy. The mashed potatoes were creamy and full of flavor. Service was good. The only thing I would change is the iceberg lettuce salad. Romaine would have been preferred. Great ambiance.
Trendy atmosphere, friendly yet slow staff, good sandwich but not mind-blowing. Maybe I expected too much.
For a college town-exceptional choices of tequila!  Some of the bartenders can get off the high horse and be a lil more friendly. DJ keeps crowd jumping!
I only go for the happy hour, the little tacos are good most of the time and the beer is reasonably priced.
Great happy hour spot.  Very tasty food and cheap prices during happy hour.  Use the Yelp check in to get a 1 cent house shot, which is usually 5 bucks.  Love the steak tostadas and the margaritas are excellent.
I come here every morning for my coffee and bagel.  They know my order and are SUPER friendly.  It's not the closest D&D to my house, but this is the one I go to for their service.
Dunkin coffee never seems to be strong enough.  Of course any coffee will do when you need it but I recommend getting it from some place else if you can.  Dunkin is a matter of convenience for me when I am in great need and that's about it.
Worst Espresso EVER. And my steak and egg combo was ICE cold. If I could give 0 stars I would.
Iced coffee was okay. Service was terrible.
Terrible attitude towards customers
Great street tacos!  Small portions but a good enough deal. The downfall is this is a no gun zone so I will not come back. Because we all know the criminals obey the no gun zone signs right? .
I had the Carnitas Burrito and it had no taste. I definitely know good tasting Carnitas and must echo the sentiments of that famous line in the 1988 VP Debate when I say \"You sir are not a good Carnitas Burrito\".
Simply put, amazing! Best carnitas I've ever eaten! Street tacos are fantastic. Try the trainer salad if you are watching your carb intake. Don't be put off by the mini-mall locale, this place is legit!
ONO INDEED!\n\nPOG is my favorite flavor and I usually get it with pineapple as well.  It's like being back on da islands. Love it!
So glad we a local take us here. Those red velvet pancakes were the business! Also had the Spinach and Mushroom Eggs Benedict--a great damn way to start off Vegas!\n\nGreat service, too!
Waited an hour and was disappointed by the food.. I had banana pancakes and a breakfast skillet.  The pancakes were chewy.  The skillet had no flavor.
Not so great. weird.
The ambiance was the only thing I didn't love about this place but even that was fine. The food was interesting/unique and the service was exceptional. James our server took our experience to the next level. This place was worth all of the recommendations we got from friends
Great sushi!!!! Great staff! & it's in the South Park area so there is lots to do when you leave. Great drinks!
I love this place! the food is amazing and everything is just delicious! the wait is a bit long, but its worth the wait.
Everything about this place is brilliant. Wouldn't be surprised to see them pop up all over the country, it's that fun (and delicious too). Hope one comes to Dallas, Tx, because I won't be back in NC for a while.
Excellent Sushi, great service & amazing happy hour!  The only think I would suggest is gluten free soy sauce so I don't have to bring my own.
Sake Bomb!!!  Sunday night this place has the best happy \"hour.\"  All night happy \"hour!\"\nAverage tempanyaki food, but great service and very clean and great for big parties.
I went to this place around 11:35am and the door sign say open 11:30am I tried to open the door and it's still locked but workers are already inside just looking at me i waited for them to open the door but did not. One star!
They were very friendly, showed up on time and worked quickly to get the job done. I was happy with their overall service and will use them again in the future.
Great quality food and the servers are really nice!
Lunch special only  till 4 pm . $7.99. Okay food nothing special that would make me want to come back. Service was just OK. Overall, I have had way better thai food else where .
Food came out 30 to 40 min later and the whole fish never came. Took forever to sit us as well even though no one was in line.  Pad tai taste worst than middle planet
POOR service!  Long Wait for Drinks!
The yogurt is good, but the topping choices were a little stale. Still, it was a good price and it was clean and neat.
Bland food poor service,overpriced. Goes to show if you get on a tv show people will come. I was one of the fools  a few years they will all be gone
Sage chicken and waffles and Andy's chicken benedict are always the best!! Got the watermelon kiwi lemonade this time--it was a little sweeter than I typically like, but the flavor was terrific!
Food portions were huge, food was just meh.
Love Love Love! \nAll you need to do is order dessert here. It comes in small shot glasses & the flavors explode in your mouth..
i think my lunch salad was made last night, it had no dressing and i waited 25 minutes to be seated. i'm all set. the only neat thing is every dish is under 475 calories. good concept, but it falls short. really, really short.
Pricey? YES. The food is AMAZING though. You will most def leave very satisfied. Took my boyfriend here for his birthday & he loved it (: very elegant set up as well!
We gave this place a try for breakfast and dinner, and were disappointed both times. The breakfast experience was terrible- extremely slow service, ran out of coffee, food came out wrong, took 10 minutes to get hot sauce while over cooked eggs got cold. Food was way over priced, especially for dinner.
Store and gas island are dirty. The first pump that I went to wasn't working with credit or debit cards. The store is not maintained very well, which is apparent with the dirty condition and the pumps not working
This little market has closed down . What a shame.
Nice to have a bike friendly place to go in the south. Great food and staff as well!
Sorry, to say our meal was not tasty at all and our tamale was cold. Maybe they can improve as we need more types and styles of food in Fountain Hills.
Tasteless this visit for the lunch menu. Had to soak the tacos with sour cream, salsa, salt, and pepper. They were still lacking taste. Hopefully it was just the cook. Won't consider coming back anytime soon.
Really good service. Prices are what you would expect. I couldn't find anything on sale
Massage services were great. Hair was sub-par. I had to go back for a recolor. I wouldn't go back there again.
Barely mediocre bar food.  Our beers were warm and the food was blah and greasy.  I've had better food from a fast food joint and at half the price.  Not worthy of a return.
A Phoenix coffee shop open past 9pm? Praise the baby Jesus!
Drive Thru - Super friendly and always remember us and what we like to order.
New to Vegas, I picked this place solely because it was close and convenient. What a great surprise! We just got pizza to go but it was some of the best I've had; hot, fresh ingredients and perfect thin crust. Will definitely be eating here again!
Everybody is helpful and friendly.  Great atmosphere.
Not a bad haircut, but brought the neckline up too high and trimmed some edges in a strange way.  Not the best haircut I've gotten, but not terrible either.
Friendly but just can't seem to get my hair right.... After several times trying to tell them how I wanted it... Seems like it's just cut how they want... Oh well I give up! Luckily hair grows :) best of luck to you all
I love this waffle cafe. Food is great and it's always clean when I go.  The staff is very nice.
the food was ok, nothing special... the service is not so good, forget to bring a cup of hot water we asked for and didn't say sorry when we mentioned it... tipped 10% and he yelled at us...
Had a private function here - beautiful space and the staff was attentive and friendly.  Not much here for vegan's and the kitchen didn't try to accommodate very well even though they had all the ingredients to make a great salad!
One of my favorites. Outdoor dining and entertainment in summer is best on East Madison or Sun Prairie.  Constant menu changes my only frustration. Keep the scallop pasta on there and I'd be 5 star.
Always passed this place, and finally today stopped in for a burrito. I got the AL Pastor pork burrito. It was a little heavy on the refried beans, but overall was a very nice burrito. I'll come back again and try other things.
Terrible, they have nothing of any interest there.  Not worth it.
The park is probably better known for its 6.5 miles of single track mountain biking trails.  It has a little something for all skill levels, but it's very rooty.
great gear. quality products and amazing customer service
One of my favorite stores for shoes. Wonderful selection. I especially love the clearance section organized by size. Super boot collection and great deals on purses. Self service so very comfortable environment.
You wouldn't believe how good a Subway sandwich tastes after 4 or 5 days of constantly eating in sit-down restaurants in Vegas.\n\nThey work fast and use fresh ingredients.\n\nNot much to complain about.
Awesome.  I was a bit skeptical, but the food was delicious, fresh and hot.  The crab legs were great, unfortunately, they never had enough out and people where waiting by the crab dish like they were starving.  They have a great selection of food.
What gives?  Donated items at over inflated prices...wump....wump....
I love greasy disgusting pizza so we eat Here once in awhile. The staff totally suck and now we just expect it and laugh. I think I saw a guy with a full beard and no covering in the kitchen. I checked for beard hair in my pizza and didn't see any.
The food was great and service was fast.  Place was very busy on a Wednesday evening and they accommodated us for 3 without any reservations.  Highly recommend making this a stop while in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area.
I was very disappointed in the food. Portions were quite small and monochromatic in tasty. We had to ask for bread. The dessert was very dry. All around skimpiness and not worth the money. There are many restaurants for tha same money around.
Great food, great atmosphere, cold beer. If we lived closer we would be there all the time.
Great BIG BAR! Best burger in Scottsdale yet! 4$ mini pitchers!
Mean waitress. Long wait for food. Soso food. Creep patrons. But good music.Dirty interior.
About 2 miles off the highway, but worth the stop. $3 for a 5\" turkey grinder (all the toppings) and $1.80 for an eegee (frozen drink.) The tables were clean and the service was fast.
Delicious sandwiches and soups.  Don't just get the desserts!
There is nothing positive at all. Unkind staffs and damp popcorn. the worst popcorn that I've tasted.
Went Wednesday night at 9 pm very busy and always good!
Man what happened this location has gone downhill in the past few months wheres the old crew that made this location special!!!!?????
Crisy Pata FTW!!!! We always have to order a large for the table or for home along with whatever combos we get.  Its a must try.  Dip with the soy sause that they provide or the lechon sauce.
Been to this place a few times over the last 2 years and it was pretty decent up until recently when I ordered the Beef Caldereta and the meat was spoiled.. And the wife got the bisteak that also tasted old and spoiled.. Very disappointed.
I had the BBQ chicken pizza which was very good.  I think the extra topping prices are a little high and it would be nice if they had some more options but overall pretty good.
Best pizza joint in town.  Never disappointed. The Asian cashier is always on point. I don't think I gotta tell him my order anymore cuz I think he memorized it.  Good atmosphere and I highly recommend this place.
First of all it was fun !  But the people they hired to work for them are jerks !  Pushy- RUDE oh did I mention RUDE !
My kids rode on the Zip Line again and had a great time.
I like this place. I don't love it, but I do like it a lot. It's a Charlotte institution, and the food is very good. The only thing that threw me off is that the onion rings are very soft... not thick as expected. Still good.
These guys rock. Fixed my i5 glass super fast. Nice clean friendly place. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worst service ever and over priced!! I didn't feel welcomed and they were mean. Don't go here!
Came for resto week and it was amazing.  Also came for the comedy dinner's they have on monday night.  its a great dinner a show night.  totally enjoyable food.  highly recommended!
It's a great little spot! The owner even came out to ask how I'd like my smoothie. Super sweet people. Cools spot and I love to support a local business
Love it.  Really good food and nice people.  Check out the courtyard.
Good biscuit but I like the chorizo burrito my boyfriend ordered better. It had more flavor and \"kick to it\". Staff was friendly and I enjoyed sitting out in the patio. Nice place to have brunch.
Horribly slow here with food, and some items were just downright foul (eggs in the breakfast burrito).  Hot sauce in the plastic tube was good though, as well as the spicy tomatillo sauce.  No real drive-thru.  What the heck?
This is great Mexican fast food. No fuss, no muss. Straightforward good food.
Trisha is *awesome*
Great food and very friendly service.
Really great neighborhood spot. Cool joint good home cooking food. Just get there early to get good seating or the pot of bread \"Yum\" it gets pretty busy on the weekends! Must try plenary of options and ok price.
This place is fun and the food is delicious, great service and location! Try it before or after catching a movie!
Poor service with cold food!
Never knew how big the place was. Seems like an awesome place for sporting events. I didn't get any drinks, but the specials appear good. It was freaking dead in there, but I want to try and go on a busy night for further review.
This is in the food court in Fashion Show Mall.  This was a pretty good meal for the price.  I ordered the Cubano and was quite pleased.
Very good food. Authentic. Spicy as indicated by name. We went there for dinner twice during our short visit to Vegas and we were happy both times.
We tried out the lunch specials and found them to be pretty good.  For about $6 we both got healthy portions of spicy food along with fairly good service.  Take a chance and go for the hotter dishes.  :-)
They put a sign that says 75% off on frames then i went to pay for it they said its full price ( wrong info ) , making the customer confuse...
Food ok. Service below par. \nIt seems bit amateurish, and would not suffer from some more experienced staff and management
Terrible! silverware was not clean...service was super slow...food was mediocre...took about an hr to get food on lunch break and had to get it to go and order was incorrect as well...not my daddy to say the least!
We came here a few months ago, but I can definitely say I won't be back. The food and service were slow, really slow. The food was also nothing spectacular. Portions were small and dismal looking. Definitely a disappointing place for nachos and beer.
White cheddar queso with bbq chicken, need I say more?!
Food was decent. The nachos were great but the tacos were just ok. Atmosphere was fun but not the greatest meal in Vegas.
I have to say, i am really not impressed with this place.  Service was spotty, the food was sub par.
Horrible for the overpriced food
The service was awful! The food was awful! The overall experience... You guessed it... Awful! A group of us were there Tuesday night and waited 15 minutes before ever being greeted! Our drink order was wrong, and our food sucked! So very disappointed.
I ordered the Athena pizza and I was very disappointed.  There was so much oil on the pizza.  The crust was soggy.
Great feel, good food best humus ever. A little on the pricey side but I will be back
Open kitchen, organic and local food, amazing drinks (I recommend \"spontaneous happiness\") & friendly staff. Sold!
Filthy, too busy, horrible layout for the playground area, and there are bees and wasps everywhere. The train and carousel are overpriced. Not a fun park.
Closed at 2am instead of its advertised 3am... We saw people inside and the waiters saw us, but ignored us. \n\nChange your closing time to 2am so people won't be trying to come at 2:15am to a closed establishment.
Their employees have such bad customer service. I stop going there. I drive to target now
OK food.\nI would probally get a pizza some other time.
If there was a 0 star I'd give them\nHorrible service\nPizza was all messed up in the box\nCalled and complain \nThey gave me a new one looked nice but tasted nasty\nWings are ok..
5points was the listing agent in my recent transaction.  I have emails in which Mr. Wilson promises to stand up to his commitments, but of course he did not.   If you are a buyer, stay the heck away.
Salads are delicious there jumbo shrimps go perfect on top! There unique dressings to choose from Lime infused ranch was amazing! \n\nCons- Poor customer Service, not helpful when it comes to being undecided or asking for their recommendations
Outstanding Italian Food.& Pizza! They have take-out or eat in. Haven't had anything that I didn't enjoy. Highly recommended.
Hands down best food in town. I've tried everything on the menu and it all is better than the rest. My favorite is the meatball pizza with onion and oregano.
First time trying this place out, and I must say it's pretty good :)
Terrible service and food. Really disappointing. Other Arribas are great. Waitress had a festering, scab tattoo that almost made me sick. Would've left if I noticed it earlier. Should've called health dept
Good crust. Overall an upgraded little ceaser or howies. Mostly take out setup. Hugh delivery area.
No too bad of a place, bit a bit pricy for what you get. Atmosphere is fairly decent, but parking is terrible for that entire plaza. I probably would not go back unless I was meeting friends there that I really wanted to see. Decent selection of craft beers.
AMAZING! Yum-o. Best orange chicken I have ever had in my life. I highly recommend this to EVERYONE.
Some of the best coffee I've ever had.  Only thing that takes them down is the price.
I called and left a message and emailed them through their website over a week ago and never got any response back.  Bummer...
Okay food. Nothing new or different. Your regular American food, just double the price. The most interesting thing they have is a dessert cart that they push around. Cool idea.
Excellent food, drinks, service, and ambience. I have not been let down by a dish yet. If you've never been here, I'd highly recommend that you try it. You won't be disappointed.
Your average Chinese buffet. Every meat on the buffet was high in sugar. But they had a very good vegetable selection for my vegan wife. Basically if your craving a Chinese buffet this one is about as good as any.
This place is amazing. It has its own vibe that draws just the right crowd of misfit artists. You wont find a better place to spend an evening among art and artists.
Can't go wrong for $38 for 1 hr. I have been going here weekly for almost two years now. All the staff are super duper nice and professional. Yes, they pick up their phones in the middle of massage but they're so good I don't care!
Biscuit and Gravy not very good.
I found the noodles to be a little bit too raw.\n\nThe taste of the soup was fine though
Highly recommend! Never been to one of these places. Eric is a very nice and professional.  Great value 20.00 for hour massage, very peaceful, relaxing and clean. \nTreat yourself and support local business!
If you are a collector of Star Wars memorabilia this is the place. Even if they don't have it, they will find it for you and get it ordered. They also specialize in comics and gaming.
They are awesome! Had my phone done in an hour! Great price too!
i freaking love this place! my phone broke, and they fixed it like nothing happened! i will definitely go to them when there is a problem with my phone again. thank you!
Dropped my iPhone 5c last night and broke the glass :( but took my phone here to get it repaired and it only took 30mins!! Awesome place and great prices !
Efficient and friendly service, excellent lunch specials, sushi was fresh and delicious. Recommend the Tarantula roll, and their California roll was best I've ever had (simple roll, excellently prepared).
Great atmosphere, very good service and unique and flavorful food.
I had a reaction to the Pancar Salatasi; no doubt to the canned or tinned beets. You would think for $6 for 2 bites of beets they could use a fresh one?
Great breakfast restaurant near Desert Ridge in North Phoenix--good natural, organic food.  Had chorizo and eggs, great presentation and absolutely delicious!\n\nWill be back for dinner service and can't wait to sample some organic wines!
I'm not a big a big fan of burgers but this was the best burger I've ever had! Great sweet potato tots and mini cupcakes too!
I have been in for brunch a few times and enjoyed the food a lot.  I ordered the steak and eggs which was awesome.  I would recommend the breakfast sandwich as well. Service has always been nice but can be slow at times.
Just had steak, bacon & sweet potato tots (& hot sauce!!) for breakfast, Scott had the Hawaiian Breakfast - loved it!!! Soooo good!!
Smashburger was simply ok. The food was not horrible, but based on overall value, it is not that great. It is expensive for what is served.
Food is just ok and the employees I've dealt with are so rude (girls) and if you ask them for anything they act put out.
The mac'n cheese was really lacking flavour. The Texas BBQ beans and brisket were excellent. The chicken a bit dry. And they dont give you enough sauce!!
Worst BBQ I think I have ever had and an empty restaurant should have been a clue. Brisket was not brisket, tasted more like roast beef. Won't be returning.
I got a buywithme.com  gift for this spa as a  birthday gift  this year. I have left two messages and not a call back and it has been 1.5 weeks.  I do not recommend  going to this place as they are not professional.
Expensive but terrible food! The lamb pasta recommend to me tasted worse than the lamb I could get from a mediocre Indian fast food restaurant, and the noodle need to be boiled longer. The restaurant right next to it is much better
We went for breakfast and it was a great value for the money. Owner at the front is a nice guy. Only complaint was our waitress, but I think she may have been new and still finding her groove.  Other than that, a-ok.
I go to Cassie every time I'm in that side of town or go out of my way to go there she has always done an amazing job I trust her with my eyebrows it's a clean and friendly environment
This was just outstanding.  What a great environment, super wait staff, and an amazing menu - though not extensive, I wanted to try almost everything on it - so the quality is there - and the food is just excellent.  Highly recommend it and definitely make reservations - it is clearly a hot spot
I had the lunch special Gyro. It was ok. For the price it was great value and would go again if I am craving a Gyro and am in the area.
Awesome burgers and dogs with a great secret sauce!!
I cannot recommend this place more. My dog absolutely loves his new food. \nOn top of it being super healthy for him, the owner and staff are really helpful and friendly. Their dog food and their attitude, actually made me feel like they love my dog, as much as I do!
Overpriced, bland food. I've had a cheeseburger there three times and every one made me sick. The only good thing they have is the breakfast sandwich, but I wouldn't make a special trip for it.
Not the worst, but by far not the best either. Service was very slow, food was bland, and experience was lacking. Will not return.
This is great if you are in a hurry, they have slices and salads ready to go. Above average quality and a nice open space too. Perfect stop before or after catching a movie next door.
Brewery tour rad\n\nStaff are awesome\n\nRussian bourbon aged stout is one of my top 4 favorites on earth
This place rocks!!   To be able to kick my feet up, drink my wine, have a blanket handy, and watch a movie was a great experience.  I only tried the dessert so maybe next time I'll try some of the pizzas.
Wow a movie should be watched this way!
They hosted our Notre Dame game watch party - we had a wonderful time! Great people, great service and very good food!
Standard chipolte. Not cheap on the meat like some stores. Long line during lunch but it moves fast.
Chef John sucks at everything. Luckily for him Anna is a great bartender and is super hot.
There are so many better burger places on the strip.\n\nThe malts and buffalo chicken dip were unique and tasty.\n\nMost likely will not go there again.
This place sucks..\nTook way to long to  get our food
Service has been very poor each of the three times I've been there.  The food isn't worth the price.
Been here twice, and YUM!  The shakes are de-lish.  The turkey burger is so yummy!  So are many of the others.  If you are looking for a casual, fun, and tasty place for lunch or dinner, this is a great pic.
Food is great here, but the service need a great deal of improvement! Ex: never check back, refills, dirty dishes all on table.. Don't know if a manager is working or not oh wait she dropped off one of our burgers.
Service was very good, but food was mediocre.  For the price, I expected much better.
Did they forget to toast my buns for the ahi tuna sliders?? I sure hope so because that would have made the sliders oh so much better.
Awesome veggie burger! Cant think of a veggie burger I enjoyed more.  Everything we ordered was delicious.
What a great salmon salad they have on menu. It is that good!!!
Yum! Place was good and adult shakes are great! Great place to hit up before heading to Marquee for the day club pool dealie.
Mediocre food, terrible service, overpriced. Stick to in and Out. This place is overrated
Solid burger. I forgot what I ordered but it was definitely tasty. That night was packed but this place was good.
I had the pork sliders.\nBased on that i cant recommend the place.\nIf you're staying at the Cosmopolitan, try one of the other restaurants.\nThe service was good however.
I do love this place. They do my favorite food here, mei fun, and they do it REALLY well. The soup is delicious too! And it comes out pretty fast, which is always a plus.
Loved the food. We had the chicken fried rice ,lo mein, and egg rolls. Everything was tasty and the staff was friendly.
I used a groupon and had brunch there.  The french onion soup was just ok and the chicken salad sandwich on baguette was forgettable.  I don't think I will be going back to this restaurant.  The view was nice from the window, though.  :-/
We just went there for drinks but they were excellent. And we had a great view of the strip at night. Actually it was probably my favorite view of any place we stopped over the weekend.
SmashBurger is my absolute FAVORITE.  I think it's equal to In-N-out, if not better.  I suggest the Sin CIty Burger.  WORTH THE PAY!!!!
Can never get enough! Please put more mushrooms on 4 dosen't cut it.
Pretty damn good,a little overpriced,hence only 3 stars. Love the interior,service was great,lot of options(mushroom swiss burger,sweet fries)give it a shot!
Great atmosphere food!
It's Starbucks so you know what to expect. This location is very fast and accurate despite always being extremely busy.
I heart beef bulgogi bento boxes! :)
Great food and Reasonable prices
Went here for lunch.  Fantastic prices for some really good Sushi.  Seriously good environment as well.. this is added to the once a week list for lunch!!!
Cottage Express is quick, delicious, and has large portions. Best take out Chinese in Hickory Grove!
Food was mediocre at best.  Plus they tried to over charge me.  Look at your bill carefully.
I was given a glowing recommendation of this place because of their beef noodle soup, but sadly it was a let down. I appreciate the local joint's attempt, and the price is good, but the soup was too sweet for the style they were selling.
Amazing service and amazing people. NO BS!!! Highly recommended!! Best alternative for dealership / CASA!!!!
On a subsequent visit, the shakes arrived promptly, the food also.  The waitress was also nicer/better then our first visit.  I had the wisconsin buttery, which was yummy.
Had to give the spot 4 stars... The place is cool the food is good & the price is Right :D plus its @ my Casino. SouthPoint :D perfect spot to chill, grub, burger, shake did I say chill? You gotta try it...
One of our favorite places to eat. Something to satisfy everyone.  The burgers have plenty of toppings. The chicken has just enough crisp on outside and tender inside. The atmosphere is casual and fun. 50's music.
Not sure what the fuss is about...this place was good, they had basics and some jazzy things and shakes were good as well.
Good burger and dog.  Great shake.  Great service.  Fast in.   Manager checked on us.   Fries a little cold.   A bit pricey but so is rest of Vegas!
Burgers and drinks were good service and appetizers were not that great .
Never brought the fries we ordered,  waitress finally showed up after we had finished our burgers to ask how everything was, told her we never received our order, had to ask for them removed from bill. No offer for dessert not even an apology for the mess up
I ordered Dante burger and parmesan fries. For a joint called \"I love Burgers\" I felt that the name of the place spoke more than the burger ever could. Bobby's Burger Palace definitely has a better blue cheese burger than here.
Great food and good service as well. Happy hour daily from 3-6! Definitely put it on your sushi list.  Recently tried additional items and will be sticking with the Sushi only...
This place is amazing. Great food, great service, wonderful place. We will definitely be back, often.
They have a great happy hour and the staff is awesome.
Service was great. The staff was so friendly. The sushi I had was great and the slices I had were nice and thick. Great find and great spot.  Looking forward to bringing friends and family!!!
The service is outstanding and the food is wonderful! My husband and I come here all the time.  The management and the staff is friendly and helpful.  The mardi gras roll is amazing!
Flies all over the food in the buffet and the manager was rude when we asked for a refund!! Nasty!!
Everything was great! i couldn't believe they had roasted bone marrow you can't find that in any buffet. I would of given it five stars if they had oysters and crab legs. Overall i will definitely be returning back to the wicked spoon.
In buffet world, you get what you pay for, quality versus quantity here, a little pricey but worth it! Great services too...
We are locals, and this is the only buffet we will go to.  We like that they have small portions, so we are able to take a little of everything.  Very good food.
Wow this was some next level stuff. Every dish is quality and a lot of them are world class and you get to choose which one(s) you want! I actually loathe buffets but I would come back to this one again!!!
Wicked spoon used to be my favorite buffet in vegas. But the quality has gone down while the price came up. It is still one of my top choices, but  no longer deserves a 5 star.
If you go a little after opening and it's not busy. The food will be cold and too salty - shame considering i went there 3 times 2 months ago.
If you can somehow overlook the price..\nJust know its worth it. Everything I tried was good!! Out of all the things my fav was the Thai basil rice with egg. Lol I'm Asian what can you say..
Great deal for breakfast/lunch. The food was amazing and there were lots of lighter delicious options so you weren't eating straight heavy fat. GO HERE!
The food was lacking flavor and taste, we were there for the ACF Convention. The service was lacking and non existing bussers.
Not just the best buffet we've had in Vegas, but possibly the best buffet we've ever had. The quality of food is superb.
Yummy, delicious, fresh food.  Definitely worth the price.
I had breakfast, and didn't eat much. Enough said. I thought this was a high end casino, but it falls short big time in this joint!
Yum yum! Get in this belly! And I mean PORK BELLY! at one point, I had pork belly on my plate made 3 different ways. The desserts are awesome too.
Very good buffet,allot of great fancy selection of food and salad and desserts,buetiful design and decor,good service and friendly...
The feeling of being inside a gigantic chandelier was truly a novel experience, however it wasn't worth the pretentiously pricey drinks. Weak drinks, average service. Boring
One of my favorite lounges in Vegas for the generally upscale crowd, ample seating, and elevated vantage point from the 1.5 and 3rd floors.
Expectedly high priced drinks at this lobby bar in Cosmopolitan. I think one Moscow Mule was $16 with tax and tip included. I guess this bar is good for pre-partying or people watching. I just hate spending this much on drinks though?
Not really worth the price to be honest. It's only so expensive because of the prime location.\n\nFood was okay. Nothing is very outstanding in my opinion.
I have been to the one in Washington D.C. and was already a big fan.  I have also been to some of his other restaurants.  Go...you will not be disappointed...
Show up on Monday to place your order or Pasty's - pick up Tuesday. Very good and love the brown gravy that goes with it! Nice friendly people running this very busy establishment. We're going to try breakfast there soon.
Its fair. Feels like a dim sum style place, ie order a few menu items and share bc portions are for sharing amongst people. I would come here for tacos that seems to be the best deal here.
I didn't try any of the Chinese food, the tacos were tasty but overpriced in my book. I wouldn't come here again.
1
Open till 10 every night. The white chocolate mousse is great! TCBY still holds it's own - even against Yogurtland. TCBY you SOB.
One of the top 3 Clubs in Vegas!!\n\nThe place is pretty nice but they have the Best DJ's From all over plus Monday nights are free for locals!!
Hottest club in vegas! Probably too hot. Literally. The hip hop room was so packed and sweaty you can't move.
Gorgeous space indoor and out, but the whole stairs thing just kills it!
Marquee, y u so pretentious?!
Overrated. Overpriced. Would not go again.
Crazy lines, but good thing we have VIP passes to skip the madness.\n\nEvery floor was crowded to dance and there were absolutely no seats to sit! How can a girl in heels survive?\n\nGreat music though.
What a freaking joke this place is. They don't let guys in if the ratio isn't perfect. Or if you don't have the perfect shirt. Never will i recommend . I hate Vegas and its bullshit like this.
went to the Dayclub wasn't impressed. May have been how awesome Encore was the day before but none the less seemed nowhere near on the same level. daybeds, cabana's were very cramped barely had room to walk between rows of beds.
One of my fave clubs in Vegas.  They always have great DJs performing.  Gets mega crowded but you can always hang around the pool area if you want more room and a place to breathe.
We were less than welcomed at the door. The security guard was extremely disrespectful. We would not have gone in if our birthday bud didn't insist.
First class service and the best seafood on the strip.  You definitely get what you pay for here.  Loved the food and experience.  Chef Josh is a great guy as well.
Lunch in Las Vegas does not have the power element like most other cities as everyone is on vacation! Milo's on the other hand has become my favorite new lunch restaurant to eat and be seen. With an amazing prefix menu this is the spot to be.
Very good food. Very expensive and limited choices. Not a traditional Greek restaurant. Very expensive but good.
Great location in new Scottsdale's newer retail shopping center. Decent coffee.
This store is pretty cool and is a great location for street shopping. Also had some really cool gift ideas and great for visitors but went in there specifically for arrowheads and they hand none, I feel like that's such a common thing for this area they should have that.
Hit or miss.  Food's not the freshest, but it's not that bad.  Really cheap and big portions.
The food is good. Margarita is good but a bit weak. Getting something better than the house may be different. All together a good experience.
professional, friendly staff.  dr. adaoag is very receptive and knowledgeable.  comfortable office.  most comfortable doctor visit i've had in vegas thus far.
Come here quite often, never disappoints. service is much to be desired but the food makes up for it.
Bad service but the food was okay.
Jimmy John's is the best.  The bread is always super fresh and chewy. The have super fast service and delivery. And I mean SUPER fast.  My sandwich was ready before I was done ordering.  Definitely go there.
Terribly slow drive thru and they always make my drinks wrong! Great location and a few nice baristas, but they don't make up for a poorly made $5 latte. I'd rather go out of my way to Sbucks on Trop and Fort Apache.
Emily afternoon shift had horrible customer service. I haven't been much of a complainer but im tired of people getting away with horrible customer service skills. If you can't treat everyone with respect try another job.
This is a relatively small location, for future reference I'll stick to drive-thru. But I've never had a problem so no complaints!
I love your subs , but I went in there and saw many flies , so I kindly told the worker , I was not ordering because of all the flies and walked out... ekk gross.
I dined here on Monday 04/29. I ordered the Korean steak tacos, they were ok but nothing special. The vanilla bean cheesecake however was good. The waitress young lady long blond hair, was very good and attentive.
Cardboard crust, canned sauce. Nothing special. But if you're starving and only have $2 in your pocket, this will tide you over. Nothing more.
Not exactly sure how they pulled this off, but yeah, it's legit NYC pizza.
Pabst on tap, good fresh pizza, great prices.
Not cheap @ $4.50 for a cheese slice and $24 for a whole pie. But definitely tasty. Even when you're not that hungry, so that says something! LOL  Will definitely try other menu items next time I return!
Pricy, but not so much compared to other things on the Strip, and it tasted pretty good.
Came in at 1pm on a Sunday. If I wanted pre-made, reheated pizza I could have gone to Sabaros and not waited in line. There are too many great places in Vegas...don't waste your time here.
Pretty good for 3AM pizza. Knocked off a star because the slices were sweating off oils... (probably because we ordered all of the meats). Crust is on the thin side. Would come back when craving pizza in Vegas!
Fun atmosphere, hidden hole-in-the-wall. Friendly employees. Pepperoni and meatball pizza was awesome.
Loved this place!! I went two nights in a row after the club. Pizza is great but the only drag was the wait. And it's on the 3rd floor on the opposite site of the pool tables btw ;)
One of the best pizzas I've tried. Italian and Sicilian pizza highly recommended. If u like cheese pizza try their white pizza! Bomb!
Great pizza. Very friendly staff. Slices are very big and you can add additional toppings to their already made pizzas. Cool find.   Grab a slice, a glass of wine and walk out front to the sofas by the pool table.
Nothing special. Just typical fast greasy pizza. 3 stars because it's open late.    -No regular seating FYI.
Overpriced and mediocre quality sushi. They crank the rolls out very fast so that's good...but also bad because they're not put together too well.
Great location, great environment, and great food. Oxtail fried rice and pork rib are strongly recommended.
fried chicken -------b-a-n-a-n-a-s
Ordered a regular tuna roll and there was a bone in it... The tuna itself was not that good either. This place is very pricey and not great. I would recommend going somewhere else.
Let me just keep it simple. Popo's should be named poopoo's.\nThe only people that could possibly enjoy this food is someone very intoxicated.
Saturdays and Tuesdays are $1 Margarita days.\n(Oh and the food is really good too.)
We tried it and liked it.  I thought it was better than most!  Traditional Mexican food and plenty of seafood options - or at least more than most.  It's always crowded and was recommended to us by an Arrowhead resident.
Come hungry because you get a lot. The food was delicious and the salsa tasted fresh. I think we found our new mexican restaurant home.
Really wanted to like this place, but the food was so so. Service was fine (sat at the bar), but when they get busy there seems to be a lot of work placed on to one person while a lot of other workers stand around. Pretty pricy.
Watered down iced coffee and stale donuts.
I could not find a coffee bar one morning and stumbled upon this place. It was crowded but the line moved fast. They have so many selections of munchies, teas and coffee. I was very pleased with it! Regular priced for Vegas
Hate going to the dentist... This place has been awesome though! Everyone is extra friendly and polite!! They all take time to explain things fully. No shadiness. Helpful payment plans too!
Great location.  Total eye candy.
Service is a bit slow, factor that in if you are stopping for a quick drink before a movie..
Service at the bar area is hit or miss. We had two bartenders waiting on us.  One made our drinks and delivered in record time.  We ordered a few apps and an entree. The apps all came but they completely forgot our entree.  After an hour of waiting we decided to leave.
I went here in a Saturday afternoon and I have to say it was a mistake. \n\nThe beer was stale, soapy, and flat. The food was bad and our waitress was just slow. \n\nI have nothing positive to say about The Comedy Club.
Great environment and service. If anything was wrong with our plate (ex. Undercooked steak) it was quickly replaced and re plated as if we had gotten a whole new plate. The waiters couldn't have been nicer.
Nothing special.  A bit overpriced for what you are getting, but what do you expect at a restaurant on the strip?\n\nTater tots were okay, but I've had better.  Beet salad was a winner.
Food is good.  Not one of my first picks when in Vegas but if i was staying at the Cosmo again and didn't feel like leaving the hotel, this would be a good option.
The food was good, we liked the re-fillable sparkling water bottle. The server was very casual and border line annoying. Laughed at our order and made us feel uncomfortable. The lights from the bar next door were really bright and annoying. Overall it was an OK experience.
Average food with an average menu
great service and great quality food.  \n\nthe continental breakfast was delicious and plentiful
Patio seating is lovely!
This is my favorite restaurant in Old Town hands down. Great patio on the canal when the weather is nice and gorgeous decor inside when it's too hot. I have never ordered something I didn't love.
worst food, got sick on the gross egg dish, there was also hair in the food.  Too noisy and cold, will not go here again.  Had guests and they were disappointed also.
I love this spa!  It is fantastic. Francesca and Barb are very professional. The atmosphere is classy & clean. They've got a client for life!
hovering between 3 and 2 stars. Great look to this place, but, as many others have said the drinks are bit pricey.\n\n I found the servers pretty abrupt as well.
Get the jack Mac, very good. Went for lunch. (Get the bowl if you're hungry.)\n\nDefinitely go back.
Slow service, staff needs more training. There's like 4 managers and none of the know what they are doing, i don't think this place is going to make it. Sorry but you lost 4 very good patrons Saturday night because of your poor customer service
Amazing food and champagne.  One of the best selections of champagne I have ever seen!  The Sunday Brunch is excellent, make sure you show up for that!!!  We went for dinner and had a wonderful experience.  As it got later in the evening the place got louder and more crowded.
I went here for the food and it was horrific. I guess I did it wrong because I didn't get champagne or tea. I got coffee lol. It was pretty good coffee though but the breakfast burrito sucked. A lot of food, but gross. On to the next one.
now that POP Soda shop is gone this is the next best place to go i guess.  They have a good selection of soda and candy and some toys.  i wish they had the Dublin Dr. Pepper but they don't :(
I love the fact how they are open late even if u get there juat before closing they will still take your order... The food is delicious extra chrispy wings amazing...
Long lines, rude service and prices that are \"adjusted\" for tourists. Come on Mcdonalds! You can do better than this lame excuse. If you want to get ripped off go to this Mcdonalds.. otherwise there are better options near the strip
They serve Mac Salad...their Bulgogi is awesome, been here only once but if all other restaurants fail...this is my fail safe
My Matcha Tea Latte is in a really BIG cup.  Outstanding customer service.  Wish the location had a scenery or in the inside of the plaze.
I was not impressed. Bad food and bad service. The price was out of the question for this place. I will never return.  I suggest Pacific Sea Food for the same price.
Don't miss out on this place.\nI had simple soft chicken tacos and the flavor was out of this world. \nThe beans and rice are incredibly fresh and delicious.
good food , service started fast until they got busy, kinda short staffed, waited forever to pay . fyi they dont take am/ex cards.
Customer service here is the worst!  Don't even bother ordering ahead of time because they won't have your order, or any record of your order.. Although I really like the food here, I won't be back.  2 strikes is all it takes for me,
We just randomly stopped for breakfast here.  It was really delicious! Julie was our server and she was really perfect.
Good place for a quick drink.  Met a friend for a quick drink.  Place is nice and relatively large.   Had the jumbo lump crab cake appetizer with a red onion caper sauce that was very good.
Neat vibe, lots of seating and really good lattes. The $4 guacamole with nachos is a good deal. Vegan.
I honestly have never gotten my nails done at Polished and not that I want to write a review about waxing- but all I can say is Hayley is fabulous-quick and professional. I have visited here for six years and will continue to. Tips in cash or check only.
Great service, but almost always packed! Definitely should make appointment if you're not willing to wait 20 minutes. Also a little on the expensive side for gel manicure.
This is a small pharmacy with an incredibly knowledgeable staff that will go above and beyond. They check dating on OTC bottles and will save you money with their prices.
Really! $$ is so wrong. Try $$$$. This is a hotel steak restaurant. New york strip steak was average and $49. Service was ok but inexperienced.
Meh, nothing special at all! Had the brisket sliders, more like fat sliders. Save yourself the nausea....
Salad, chicken and waffels, and the lamb burger.  So good.
very affordable and delicious filet mignon for only $32. will come back again!
Great food. Unique mixed drinks. Their chopped salad may be the best salad ever eaten.
Hubby & I celebrated our 8yr anniversary here!  We loved it all!  The chopped salad, short ribs, scallops and ended with the delicious sticky bun bread pudding!\nThe cocktails were also delightful!  The service was exceptional, as well!
This restaurant I give it a 2 star, its a real nice place small and cozy and very clean!!!! They serve there food in big white elegant plates. The food is ok not the best.
Worst venue EVER!!  Here's an idea ... SEATS!\n\nSaw an indoor and outdoor concert here.  Never again.
Pretty good food but i am not a very big fan of tapas.  overall i thought it was a fun vibe for some good wine and a light dinner
Not impressed. It does NOT resemble a cave so don't be expecting any cool ambiance.  A 4oz piece of fish or chicken is $15-20. Not worth it. Small plates are enough for 1 person. Don't go here hungry.....
I walked into Stitched and into heaven.  The clothes are amazing and Jack was friendly and very helpful.  I'm going back tomorrow to check more clothes out.  Jack is the bomb!  Very soon I will have a new wardrobe of fabulousness!  Highly recommended for the individually fashion minded.
Unbelievable gem in Apache Junction!! Great beer selection and awesome service. We even ordered food after we had just eaten dinner because they serve only local farm fresh beef and produce! Great place to spend my money!
I was not impressed with this mall.  The workers here seem to be very unfriendly and unwelcoming.  If you cant bother to acknowledge when I walk in, I'm not going to be spending my money there.
There isn't much to say that hasn't been said.  Easily the best meal I've ever had.
Loved the \"build your own burger\"  one of the best burgers I have ever had!
My favorite burger. Very good. Thick and juicy. Yum.! Also big selections of meats and toppings and even bread
this place is just great.
Dinner was pretty bad. Add slow service and it worsened the experience. Breakfast was much better. Stay away from the day old 1/2 frozen baked goods.
The house brown ale was okay, the stout on the rotating selection was amazing.  It's nothing that outlandish, but the service is good, and it's a good place to get some beers, poutine, and pub food.
We do a lot if pick up orders. They tell us 10 minutes and end up waiting another 20-25 minutes. My husband said he won't pick up any more orders for me.
Stopped in to grab a cocktail. They were good but bartender was not paying attention to what was ordered.
I've been here a few times, it's ok in a pinch. The calzone was soggy on the bottom, so was the pizza crust. Usually I'll drive past it on my way to Spinato's, even Gus' down  the street has better food.
Nice trendy bar which is frequented by locals and students alike , good food at reasonable prices , students get good deals , loads of plasma tv's showing sport all day.
I really liked the atmosphere here but I went when it wasn't very crowded (around 2). Otherwise I wouldn't have liked it nearly as much.
Pretzels were wonderful and delish. Check the dates on any products on the shelf.
When you walk in, you get the feeling of walking into a NY pizzaria. The service, the pizza, & the build you own thin crust pizza was awesome!
The ambiance was great. The food was ok. Even though the menu seemed quite eclectic and interesting, the taste was ok.
Tacos were good and simple.  They were small and cheap, you'll want to order a few. Horchata was good and homemade.  Beans were plain.  Certainly not the best I've tried but I would come back.
Cute place. Fantastic bakery items. Very accommodating with English speaking customers. Highly recommend the brioche cinnamon rolls. They were amazing! We even got more to go for the next morning.
The staff was very friendly and accommodating and the atmosphere was delightful.  However the food was just OK and somewhat overpriced.
This place sucks always get order wrong and dont want to fix it also got mold on tortilla  and they said it was ok
Bad bar food with a so-so atmosphere...  Decent happy hour prices for booze.
It's gross in here...cobwebs hanging off the lamps and tables r filthy..and how does a sandwich spot run out of wheat bread..and very wierd tht there r pictures of wierd looking kids everywhere...
The sales approach at this place is nothing short of a Used Car lot.  Three gentlemen fought over shaking my hand as I walked through the door and everything went downhill from there.
This seems to be a busy location, at least during lunch time. Service was prompt and employees were cordial.
Good location for a decent bite to eat before the game. Gets busy, but the food and service is good. Little on the pricy side.
Quite possibly the worst barber shop on the planet. I have never seen haircuts take 45 minutes or longer.  I guess these guys are not interested in making money. If you have 3 hours to kill...this is your spot.
The service is great and the atmosphere is very relaxed. The pizza was great, and the waiters are knowledgable.
This was my first time eating Neapolitan pizza, and it won't be the last. It was delicious; my girlfriend and I both enjoyed it. Also, I highly recommend the chocolate pizza for dessert.
The pizza was good but their lasagna should be changed to vegetables with cheese on top.
Slow service, weak food, im not sure the beers we ordered had any alcohol in them they tasted watered down.  The place looks promising but I was dissapointed.
We were very disappointed with the seafood options, especially shellfish. \n\nVery dark inside. Take your money to the Ocean Club instead.
Food was mediocre and overpriced. Service was slow. It's a pretty restaurant, but that's about it.
Definitely NOT the original. \n\nI went to the one in Brooklyn, better than the LV one.\nLV one too crispy. They also served another table our salad. Sauce was bland. I like the original better.
I had my meal on the premises while with a friend (I usually take it home) and it was a pretty decent experience.  The store is clean and the staff are so friendly they make you feel right at home.  Thanks, PoS!
Sound is a bit bouncy & shrill here. SouthPoint south-most bar has great football sound.  From Super Bowl Sunday...
I liked the atmosphere but was overall underwhelmed with the food.
Went for lunch and we all ordered Carne asada burrito. Food was plain and overpriced for what you get.
The chicken strips and G fries were freshly made and were very good.  I look forward to going back for the 'chicken and waffles'.
jail sucks, worst food ever!  Plus the people there stink and are mean...dont go, its not fun.   Stay home instead, or take a taxi home, dont drink and drive!
Such a horrible experience...the food was horrible...the owner is a jerk...and the cops were even present when the owner started some sort of a scene outside. I would never return.
...poorly trained stuff... took 40 minutes to get drinks, an hour to get breakfast... good luck trying it...
Do yourself a favor and enjoy some pork buns at Umami.
This is for you if you are looking for a spot to work on your laptop for hours in a quiet enough environment.\n\nThe place isn't that clean and the espresso was worse than at any major chain.
Worst excuse for mexican food, ever.  Who messes up tacos??? Tacos were full of fatty meat and the avocado was brown. Yuck. Absolutely terrible service to boot. I'll never come here again
Tried it a few times but last time I had the soup , it was stale and made me sick. Waste of money.
This place is so small from the inside!!! I would hardly call it a club! Not worth it
Got there early. It was realy dead. I'm sure if the night were to continue on it may have gotten beter, but we left. Music was nothing really to remember. Might give it a second chance next time I'm out there.
Would not recommend to anyone. We went on a Friday night, and this place was practically empty... Maybe due to the bad music. They had some good songs but mostly just crap. Not worth going to really.
still sucks! Enough said.
Unoriginal, bland and boring.Review is for Joey, not the pie. Did not want to try after talking with this guy. Congratulations Joey!!! You are a 1 star human being. Off to Grimaldi's.
Sandwich was good, but the fries were horrible! There are so many good places to get a quick bite to eat in Vegas, I would skip this as a meal place. Did not have dessert, but those looked pretty good.
If you could give zero stars, I would.  Seated on a Wednesday afternoon for a drink and sat, then sat, then sat some more.  Apparently no one was interested in taking our order as no one stopped by our table so we left after 10 minutes.
Expensive, glorified bar food and crappy server. The view was great though, right across the Bellagio fountains. Be fair warned, food is mediocre. They need to really fix this place up. How disappointing.
If I could give this company a zero I would.  The business manager \"Mike\"  is completely unprofessional and incompitent.  On top of that he smells like smoke. Have another cigarette.
Walked in dirty tables everywhere.  Pork was unforgivably dry and sauce was not tasty.  Pho was just okay.  The worst though-my partner got sick the next day.
Come for the beer, not for the food.
Perfect hotel for Phoenix they are as  racist as Arizona is .\nGood job Westin keeping it real for AZ  .. \nYou should change your publicity  only white people allow ..
Service was good but food was tasteless.  Called in advance to ask if they had a bloody mary bar and was told yes.  Upon arrival we were told it was offered only on holidays.  Dissapointed!
Open 11am-9pm. Greek guys doing white broccoli & white shrimp pizzas with buffalo wings, hot & cold subs, calzones, stromboli's, ziti, lasagna, chic parm, spaghetti. Free limited delivery
Gluten-free crust was underdone and not very tasty. :(
Cappuccino was undrinkable. It was burnt and made me want to cry. I've found that some barristas at One Coffee Co. know what they're doing and others don't.
The service was great. The staff was friendly. The food wasn't. Bad but it wasn't good. Didn't have much flavor. I wouldn't recommend this place as the food really isn't all that great.
Run of the mill bar with dirty floors and extremely loud music.
Went here on two nights where it was pretty empty on BOTH nights, but walked by Sat night and saw so many people out on the patio. Wonder if it was Carrie Underwood fans or something since she had just performed nearby?!
This airport doesn't have a lot of good food options, but would consider this place one of the better options if you have some time to kill.  Typical airport prices and okay bar food, but good service.
Food is random, management scarce it's a so so  place only survives because they offer sports to view while you eat food you could've prepared at home.
Good hotel for the price. Huge rooms. Everything is stained but to be expected by the strip. Bring your own everything. They don't even provide shampoo. Overall good FOR THE PRICE.
Great yogurt, great topping choices, very clean, and very family friendly!
I really HATE paying $30 for horrible food! This place sucks eat here at own risk.
$4.45 for Hammond lollipops that are $1.99 at WHOLE FOODS? What a rip! And teen-age clerks being too familiar and inappropriately jokey in front of me? Me thinks not!
Decent sushi. Their unagi (BBQ eel) is terrible and that's my favorite. The salmon and other rolls are good.
Came in. Waiter was alright. Gave me a stair like I didn't know what I was doing. He gave mediocre service. I'm full
Great brew pub!  Hoppy beers, friendly service, interesting crowd and atmosphere.  If you are looking for a great beer, go.
the food is great but no more steak on the menu. thats why i gave it 3 stars.
Crab BLT was a big disappointment.  Why did they chop the bacon into little pieces which kept falling off the sandwich?  Crab cakes had little flavor.  Mac &cheese was ordinary.  Overpriced considering the lack of quality.
Great place! I'm glad that we pull over here at a right place where we eat our dinner with a cool interior design that will add to your appetite.\n\nThe price is also cheaper than the others.\n\nCheck this out!
Tried their half soup and salad. Soup was a very hearty chili and beans . This was more like a bowl than a cup. The soup was like a stew. Tried their salad with fruits apples and pears . Interesting blend
Nice area, quiet, 3 separate playgrounds, 2 for my toddler that's safe enough with safety swings, and no sand which is always great. Open grass areas too. Covered picnic area so it's a good place to have a play date.
Not bad, but good either. And at $9 per sandwich there are much better places to go. Service is spotty as well. Nice folks, but they have some work to do.
Spent too long explaining my order, correcting the cashier while the manager yelled to the back our order incorrectly. Then we still did not get our order as asked. Only one of the two soda fountains worked with a low ice machine. None of the tables were clean.
Not very good. Edible but not good. I could go into details but why. I've had great Mexican food in Cali and this is not even close.
Terrible. Terrible service, bland food, dirty seating area.
The BTL Sandwich is okay. The bread is from Home. If you like how your mother make sandwich then okay. I think the bread fatter...
Big mistake ordering delivery from this place and the pizza was not good. Costco or Pizza Heaven has better tasting pizza and for a whole lot less. Never again!
Got there right at opening time and seated at the bar area where the bartender was our waiter .  He was so distracted he forgot to place our order.  One hour later the pizza came out. You have to eat it with A fork because it's soupy. Not an enjoyable experience
Lavazza coffee (no more illy) was excellent with my eggs benedict and homefry cakes  - which by the way were loaded with feta, onions and spinach. A little pricey but would do it all over again.
Too bad this place is now closed :( They had really good chai and frozen coffee drinks.... They will be missed
This place is overpriced and service is slow. They served breakfast potatoes which seemed like frozen potatoes and when we asked the waiter he did say it is frozen. Pancakes were too thick and felt doughy. \n\nTheir Mexican breakfast items are way tastier!
FYI, the prices listed on the menu linked to this profile are lower than what is on the menu at the restaurant. The burgers average about .50 and higher. The hickory loaded for example is really 9.79. Otherwise great food.
Meh, I was not impressed overall. It was just too crowded to play the games, people kept bumping into each other.
I thought this place was pretty cool old school arcade games and a bar. Its a pretty good combination.
Eh. I wouldn't clear my schedule for the night to come here, but it's a cool pregame/chill spot. In my opinion it's one of those places you need to come with a big group to have a really good time.
It was okay not as good as most pools in Vegas. There are a lot of kids. The drinks were expensive but strong. This pool is similar to the stratosphere pool in looks and overall pool quality. I wouldn't go again but it was fun one time.
New to the area, I was looking for nail salons and came here. After a week 4 of my nails peeled off easily and the rest were all well on there way to coming off. Wont be going there again.
Lots of food, good selection. I'm a little leery of  Asian buffet's, but you get your dollars worth here.. fresh Sushi.  Mongolian wok made to order. Lunch price of $ 6.99. not bad.
Great boneless wings! Joe's sauce is awesome on then. Their slices and drink combo is delicious and cheap!
Very professional and honest owner. Work done was excellent.\nhighly recommended!
We enjoy the burger with pastrami. Nice yummy taste. Nice little burger joint with a try. Their quesadillas aren't great but the burger are good.
I ordered the Philly cheese steak with extra meat and cheese. OMG, if this is extra meat then I can't imagine how little meat the normal sandwich has. \nAlmost $10 for a sandwich, it better be amazing. It wasn't. Skip it.
If you absolutely, positively, have to pay nine dollars for a gourmet whopper at two am in Vegas, this is the best, and, I suspect, only place guaranteed to satisfy a singularly bizarre craving.
I retained her fraudulent representations she set forth in a series of  emails, which contradicted each other as she back-pedalled and apologized. Bottom line, her apologizes were as empty as most Arizona rivers. Not professional.. Even her pic must be 25 years old.
Yum. I do love this shop it's close to home very affordable and delicious. Great customer service as well!!!!! Always friendly quick and helpful.
Food served on styrofoam.  Tacos the size of a small fist.  Made my bartender leave due to slowing business.  Try to avoid if possible.
The grand cafe food is wonderful - the service is very poor.  We waited in line longer to give them our money than we did sitting and eating our food!  I wish we could give you folks four stars, but service is a great deal apart of eating!!!
Great place. Good service. Tasty bar food. Friendly attentive staff. LL Cool J in the background. Life is good!
Great atmosphere, food and service! I'm usually here every week for happy hour. Can't beat the price, especially for delightful wine.
The food is ok, drinks are good. Service is slooooooooooow. They forget about you in the patio, and you wait a while for the check. Been here twice, two different servers, both slow service. But the place is pretty cool. Too bad.
They have a good selection for their lunch buffet (have both veggie and meat options). Always love their dessert options and garlic naan. Staff is friendly.
Tasty food and friendly staff. Been coming here a few years. The prices have risen lately, but still within my budget for Indian food.
Closed on a Sunday because it's \"Memorial Day weekend\".  This is why local businesses fail. Sheer laziness.  Thankfully mcdonalds knows their butts from a hole in the ground are open.
The sub contents were good but the. Bread they use is very average!
downward spiral, so can't wait for native new yorker to open.
Bad experience. They lost my son's appointment though I confirmed. Not a good first impression.
The food is always amazing-I've only tried vegetarian items.  They have a friendly staff that is happy to answer questions.
I was going to give it two stars, but its family owned and they are sweet.
the arizona burger gets the extra star here- it's wonderfully spicy. other than that, it seems like big specialty burgers that are good but not great
We ate here for St. Patrick's Day and the food was amazing!  The weight staff was friendly and very helpful.  We had never been before but glad we did and will go again.  We had the bread pudding for dessert and it was great!
This place was small and had a small selection of EVERYTHING. There are 10 better gun stores I could easily name off the top of my head. I will NOT be back!
I go to this facility usually 3 nights per week at about 2am and love it. Its jot crowded at all, usually having about 3-5 people in it. I can have the basketball court to myself I wanted and move freely through workout stations.
You do not want to go to this bar it is full of truck drivers that are just looking for a w**** hopefully you're not one of them they 86 women if they stand up for themselves I rate this bar 1 star:
Stand up live posted they would contact me on Facebook regarding not allowing me in with a valid ticket, purchased from their window \nThey blocked me instead \nWhat a great business nice \nPoor service poorly ran very upsetting to deal with !!! Stay away from this venue
Amazingly delicious burger with even tastier fries. I also had a PBC&B concrete and it was so flavourfull and rich.
Never again\n\nGot pink and white acrylics and a pedicure. \n\nThe shine dulled quickly and the powder was poor quality. \n\nWhite turned yellow and it's only been 4 days
Worst manicure I've had in years. He filed all my nails short without asking me. The polish was all over my skin around my nails and cuticles and, because it was red, it stained my skin. Do not recommend.
You want to make an appointment at this place? Go ahead! It's another story that it doesn't matter when you show up, because you still get in the line. Fail!\nPS - Some employees are super rude and would yell at you.
This used to be my favorite bbq place in Charlotte, but the last several times the pork has been very fatty. Sorry Midwood, Mac's and Queen City Q have you beat. P.S. 3-stars because the beef brisket is very tasty.
Great food , the salmon was to die for.\nThe waiter was informative and had a stupid attitude when we had questions ,good price  4 star since it was my first time here and I hate rude and very unfriendly waiter
Our service was great!! I Like the salad alot but they are going to take out the menu.. Not sure why....
Chips and salsa are amazing. Food is good. Fresh. Was disappointed to recieve fish tacos with fried fish in a restaurant of this caliber.
No where close to chipotle. Threw half my veggie Burrito away. Perhaps meat stuff or salads are better. Not going back for sure.
Great loans, long lines and angry fat women named Tracy that get mad if you ask any questions interrupting her date with the 5 boxes of crispy creams she has hidden away.
I'm from Venezuela and I can said that the food is good but the owner need to work in how him give attention to the client he is not so kind and that can make your business go down
My wife and I tried the vegetarian and reina pepiada arepa.  Both were delicious.  Just the right size and priced right.  Staff was friendly and the place was very clean and comfortable.
Really wanted to like this place :( 3 stars just for the fried yuca. The meat in my arepa tasted like steamed dog food, had a really gamey flavor. We literally took the rest of our arepas home and gave it to our dog
I was visiting my cousin from New Jersey \nI was amazed by how authentic it was they even had Taylor ham. The bagels were very good similar to what I'm used to.
This yogurt was alright, but it wasn't as creamy as I would have liked... I've had much better yogurt pretty much everywhere.\n\nWell, the sprinkles were good. I'll give them that lol
It was OK. Service was friendly, but slow. Food was OK, but I don't think it was a good value.
DJ on fridays..good drinks nice crowd.
The noodles were bland. I ordered the noodles with steak and my friend ordered the curry noodles.  Both were bland.  The prices were good and the service was friendly but this place was not worth going back to especially since it's in the same shopping square as Monta.
Fast and cheap tasty food. I like the chicken curry over rice for only 4.95!!  Also the mango pudding for dessert is delicious and only $1.25. I came here because Monta was a ridiculously long wait and it ended up being great.
Boneless Wings had a tasty sauce, but not enough sauce and too much coating for my taste.
This location had great accessories and I did get a few great blazers. The staff just wasn't the friendliest. However they weren't rude. Just kinda blah lol
I still hate this place but am cursed as my husband loves it..I tried to hide the fact they opened one in Matthews but can't ooooh noooooooo I
The food was ok not as good as a particular veit. Pho. SERVICE was not that good she didn't exactly get my order right no check ins and did not understand me well
Disgusting!  If you go into the kitchen, you will never eat at this place.  Dirty Dirty Dirty!
We went for a quick drink and dinner.  Had a salad and my husband had the fish and chips.  Overall, the food was good, drinks were on special and the service was friendly.  Great atmosphere...lots of locals.
Great local watering hole.  Diverse crowd and always someone interesting to talk to.  Good food st bar but I've never eaten more than an appetizer because let's face it...  I'm there for s martini !!
Went out to try this place out today. Pulled the door handle and the door was locked. Peeked inside, the half of the ceiling lights were on and the tables were in dissaray and without a chair insite. More than likely this place went out of business.
The place was super busy maybe that is why our food was really cold. Seemed like chicken was cold but the cheese was warm. Fries were completely cold. I would have loved to wait a little more for a better, warmer meal.
The restaurant is kind of dirty, the service is ridiculously slow, and the food is not good. You're better off going to McDonald's.
We have eaten take out many times from here and the food tastes pretty good. Orange chicken is good but not the best. \nThe curry is really delish.
They do a pretty good job, but honestly, the blond woman who i believes owns the place is pretty rude and not very friendly. Next time I plan to drive a bit farther and go to Cobblestone which actually is a little cheaper anyway.
Excellent very fresh sushi! Great crowd and worth the little wait. I am visiting from Los Angeles and this restaurant is as good as many in LA, NYC & SFO
Wonderful brunch! Has a knack for being creative and serving tasty food with a nice presentation. Food is flavorful; loved the bloody mary bar, and at a reasonable price.
Bad service, gross food, bad drinks, VERY $$$. Typical for Pittsburgh. Will never go back.
A famous restaurant. Good service, very juicy and tender steak. While, the beer collection is not so good. Almost only canned beers are available (I just saw one beer tap there, which is not on the menu).
La Shis KaBOMB !\n\nCheap...fresh....excellent flavors...nice people !!\n\nYa just cannot beat it !
Located in Red Rock Casino & Hotel. Decent food. Obviously, if you are in the hotel, convenient location and open 24hrs.
I love red velvet cakes, but the ones here were too dry. It's not even topped with cream cheese icing. I do not recommend! I also tried the \"blood\" mate tea, it was okay. The fruit yogurt parfait sucks too!
The custard is good.  We are always satisfied with the selection.  I enjoy the root beer floats, french fries and onion rings there.
Unfortunately not good!! Today's visit was the last visit. Just not impressed with how greasy the beef is. Other dishes are ok nothing impressive enough for the price charged. Well... I do like the custard so it might not be the last time.
Very tasty curry. Amazing fries and naan. And I finally tried goat. I'd definitely make another trip when we are on that side of town!
I got diesel at this \"Chevron\" in Chandler, AZ on 12/11/2009 for my R.V. \"The Black Pearl\".  It was my first time there.  The prices were competitive.
Really good food, hadn't had a good Chinese meal in a year. Buffets are not the same. Definitely coming back.
Just tried to check this one out based on Yelp reviews but they were closed. Sunday morning 8:00 am. Bummer
Quick and easy but I wouldn't say it was \"good\". More like to late to cook dinner, super hungry, deal with the quality, place.
Such a disappointment after being a regular at Boiling Crab... The staff were all good looking though. =D
It was a fun experience, I'm not sure if I'd go back because seafood isn't really my thing. Service was alright but had to keep waiting for a water!
The Portions on shrimp appeared a little skimped this time around, or it may be cc and be are giving bigger portions. Overall, it's as expected.
This is the worst place to go.. Crawfish was so small and dry... Crab legs had no taste... It took them forever to make food as well.\nBetter go seafood supermarket and buy some live crabs and boil them.
No no no no. The bartenders were rude and looked miserable. Clearly they hate their jobs as much as I hated being there. Skip this place. Not worth it.
The customer service in this store is terrible. A Manager by the name if Justin was rude and sarcastic and needs a belt to hold his pants up. If Oreily thinks guys like Justin are good managers than corporate has a poor judge of character and customer service.
We went with high hopes. We were seated and waited 20 minutes (no exaggeration) without anyone coming to our table. We tried to get the attention of the waitress as she passed and she actually looked the other way. I We ended up leaving without even being able to try it.
My boyfriend and I dropped in for the first time on a Sunday afternoon.  The atmosphere was nice and the restaurant was very clean.  Our server Dan was knowledgeable and pleasant. The food was average but good for the price. We will definately be back.
I've had better but this one was good, better than I've found so far in Phoenix. But it was a bit pricey for me and inconvenient that they only accept cash.
Came here because of the rating.  Food was average in taste and quality and pricey to boot.  Atmosphere is very basic at best...kind of like a run down college diner.   On the plus side, food was served almost instantly and the bbq sauce was tasty.
Why always such a long wait... ??? And if waiting is forever long, why install those most uncomfortable park bench... Staffs are awful & unhelpful & slow... Really ?
The flavors and toppings were okay.\nI was a little disappointed how few non-fat options there were.\nThey have an okay selection but all were of similar tastes.
I was excited to try this place, but sadly i did not get a chance. They advertise that they deliver, but apparently only on busy days, don't know which day that is. Very disappointed.
It's a beautiful salon, but a man's haircut is $65...
Not exceptional but not everyone can't be Yogurtland. Service is good they have many toppings but the yogurt itself could be better. My least favorite yogurt so far
Decided to give this place a 2nd chance since I was in the area & needed a hard wax Brazilian! And I must say it was pretty darn good! Really not painful at all for a Brazilian and super clean and speedy!
Food poisoned. Trip the hospital. Needless to say I'll never be eating here again.
Update!!! You guys don't server cold burritos anymore!!!!! Thanks ! Good food here! They have a good .99 menu everyday!!!
Buyer beware they have raised the prices here again!!!!!
Food is good, but customer service should be just as good. Very rude, not friendly makes you feel un welcome. Don't know how he stays in business. Will tell all people I know to never go there. Vegas is full of good markets and this is not one of them.
Maybe I'm too picky but after having eaten at the original place off of H street in San Diego... Nothing comes even remotely close to it. Overall food was ok; priced just right. I say try it you'll probably like it!
It was ok. Kinda pricey for what you get. Its at the end of the strip so if your faded its good!
Most authentic tacos outside of Mexico. \nNevertheless, #SrGORDO please fix your ordering system. Long lines ruin the experience.
Not as good as Molly Brannigan's, but a decent pub none the less.
Pretty good selection, they don't sell hotdogs here and make sure you check the date on some of the beer.
Still sooooooo slow!!!!! This store needs to take lessons from the Dunkin Donut stores back east where customer service is beyond excellent and the staff hustles!!!
AMAZING!!!! It's way out of the way but totally worth it! First time in there and customer service was excellent! Only complaint is serving size is a lil small. Great burgers and fries. We will be back to try other items as well!
They have a good variety on the menu, from oven wood oven baked pizza's to Osso Bucco.  Try the Mamma meatball slider to start!  Went on a saturday night, it was busy, so i can get noisy.
The scene on Columbus weekend was relaxed and uneventful.  We did enjoy hanging out in the lounges watching TV and playing PlayStation 3 in between laying out and hitting the hot tub.
Good food overall but the storefront could use some work to make for a nicer dining experience. The place was clean and service was fine. I would absolutely order take out or delivery from here.
So here's latest.  I received a message from the BBB this evening stating that they were unsuccessful at getting a response from Filibertos.  Not sure what the next step is, but I am not finished.
Ann was very professional while I was standing there practically (or totally) naked!  She made me feel very comfortable and always offered me the best deal possible.  I had never had a spray tan before and visited her multiple times.
The Stacy's on Shea is CLOSED!
Good service,  and they had decaf coffee ready (not instant or lattes only like most MTL places); toast was excellent, but the eggs, potatoes,  and pancake were just \"ok\". \"Fruit\" was laughable, more like garnish.
They are saving money by doing the first coat of polish with some crappy off brand in a similar color. The polish looks really bad, the impurities in the crappy polish are showing. Not recommended.
I am a fan of Russo's.  Tried the pizza many times and it was very good for Vegas.   I tried the wings and they were cooked to perfection.  Recommend this pizzeria.
Good food great prices!
Not the best atmosphere, but the Eggplant Szechuan over noodles made it worth coming. It's no longer available. Look at your reviews!!! (Several times this particular dish is mentioned with pics taken.) Why would you remove it from your menu?
Very poor service. We had to repeat our order at least 4 times and they still got the order wrong they where very slow.
Was good no humble pie on the menue\npizza was very good
Went here before the Foo Fighters last night, the place was crowed and not staffed at all, I was waiting at the bar for 20mins and the bartender never came to our side. This place can't handle big events downtown, Stay Away....
I've been to this location a couple of times and it is getting worse each time. The staff is good but the food is not. The lettuce looked dead and slimy on my wrap and their was a bug in my drink. I prefer twin peaks over Tilted Kilt now
Eww, food was horrible.  Only reason I gave it 1 star was because the fries were decent.\n\nEww. Never again
Don't be fooled. Charlotte doesn't seem to have much to compare. I'm a tough critic because I'm from the west coast. Not that great.
I have been here twice for lunch and both times were great. Large portions and fast service. The service was good but not great. But that shouldn't stop you from having a good meal.
We had Big J come out to confirm that we had a slab leak.  He was on-time and professional.  And, he's going to end up saving us $$ since I didn't even think to involve our insurance company!
Got the veggie burger, which was probably 98% salt. Not. Good.\n\nThe boyfriend liked the wings, though, and there were lots of TVs. If I go back, it will be for a beer, not for the food.
Worst mistake of my life. I'd give it 0 stars if I could. These are the worst \"students\" ever. I'm sure I'd be more comfortable having a monkey work on my teeth.
A great atmosphere...\nA really good selection...\nHorrible service.
Sushi was just okay.
Reasonably priced and decent portions.  The decor was a bit confusing, a dance floor and a disco ball for a restaurant off Tenaya.....doesn't quite fit the neighborhood.  Food was pretty tasty.
Lobster Roll implies it is served on a roll. Not a piece of white bread similar to Wonderbread. Respect the lobster. Respect yourself. \n\nPlus it is too pricey for what you're getting. Not into it.
Wonderful way to get around Maddy and for 10.00, you can ride as much as you like, just have to check in the bike now and then during the 24 hour period. We didn't drive the rental car once during our stay.
The poorest service I have experienced in Montreal .
Good customer service; however the prices are a bit costly; however I do think they do a good job.
Yummy!!  Offered to let us take some peanuts to go.\n\nThe soda machines are awesome with 200 different types of soda combinations.  One of the soda machines broke while we were there so took a little longer to wait for the other machine.
Ehh....just so so
The tacos were greasy and unflavorful. I was quite disappointed with my order. There was also dirt on the floors and the people making the food didn't speak much English
The teens who work here are quite rude. Wasn't expecting much for the few items I had but the service was terrible. I was the only customer in the store when I walked in and they stayed behind the counter the whole time.
They have great bands that play here , but its too small of a venue to hear music.
The carne asada tacos were amazing, reminded me of the ones in Mexico! Only thing that killed this place for me was they forgot the side of rice my girlfriend ordered, and when we finally received it the Mexican rice was undercooked, great in flavor, just super crunchy!
Beware they do not sanitize their tools.  After they are done they put the tools back in the bag and \"seal\" it again so when the next customer comes in they think the tools are clean and unused.  Never coming back here again!
It was about a 2 1/2 hour class for the adult/child/infant CPR/AED certification. John did an excellent job teaching the class. It was very informative. It was only $40. I think the American Ref Cross charges twice as much.
Cute and convenient. Friendly service. Not sure about the hype. Croissant and espresso were just okay.
Honestly nothing I have eaten here could even be considered average. The service is always solid, but the average beer selection and below average food make this place forgettable. I now spend my time at the Bulldog Pub instead which has better food, beer selection, and atmosphere.
Went for dessert & drinks.  Bar service was a slow & desserts were meh.  Did like the location & that the front walls opened to the street, but that isn't enough to get me to go back. Too many other great options around the area to settle for meh.
Its good yogurt to get your sugar fix but its not the best that i have tasted. I love how it looks inside though and the name is quite cute!
Yummy food; good service.
The quality has dropped from our last 2 visits, shrimp were old and mushy. What a shame I really enjoyed this place.
Found these guys using Bing. My iPhone home button was unresponsive. Brought it in and less than 30 minutes I was up and running. Brand new home button installed. Works better now than it did when it was new.
Four for dinner on Sat nite.  Prime rib, salmon caesar, liver and onions and mahi mahi.  Each was very good, service was very fine.  We like this place...
I ordered the Italian Club and it was decent, but underwhelming. The bread was dense and tasty, but it wasn't the largest hoagie I've had. Should have gone with the full size bec the half was not enough.
So so yogurt and with one on every corner you really have to make yourself stand out. I thought the kid behind the counter was friendly and helpful. The toppings and yogurt selections are once again so so. Does anyone else find it odd this business is categorized under Ethiopian food?
My time is short, so I will be brief. The food is great here. The waitress I had was friendly. However, the prices are too high for people like myself who have to watch their spending.
The food is good. Would give 4 starts except  I guess somewhere along the line I became an old man.. But something about 10am shoulder to shoulder with tons of people and techno from the DJ.. If you have a hangover avoid!
Also be sure to check out the reviews that are not recommended by yelp.  All say the same thing.
Took a buddy to lunch here last month.  Surprised to get there around 11:30 and be the only ones there...  The food was great, as was the service.  Looking forward to my next meal here the next time I pass through Phoenix.
Guilt-free guilty pleasure. Great for those days when you want to eat something delicious without feeling greasy after. I had one of their panini's and and loved it. I wish they stayed open a little later.
Very clean, fast service, very nice employees and good subs!!
The opening time is definitely a plus. We wondered by at 9:00pm and met a full house. Taste-wise it's just as it, I can't tell too much difference from other similar stores.
A place that has potential!  Great burgers, happy hour specials and atmosphere but the service lacks!  The service is so bad, that alone will prevent me from coming back.
The worst foot massage experienced.  My wife agreed.  The two girls chatted in Chinese non stop while we were there.  They basically touched our feet for an hour, even after we asked them to do something different.  We left the place frustrated as hell.
The grub experience was better before the takeover/makeover...but it is a very nice place to snag a drink at the little bar.  I'd go back for a bar lunch by myself.
BEST Scwerma Sandwich YET in Phx area!!!\nand friendly owner....\nRelaxed, cozy, homemade.\nDefinitely will be back.
Good sports bar lacking in beer selection but all in all cheap greasy food to soak up the booze and if u got a itchy finger to win the got the vlts too
i love good burgers and this place didnt meet my expectations what so ever. Was not even as spicy as i would have liked. If i return ill try the jalapeno burger for sure.
This is NOT the best brunch in Charlotte. It's a small chain located in a shopping plaza full of families with their 2 strollers and screaming children. The food was decent but I'm sad I made a drive this way for brunch.
Always have had good experience here but not tonight, dinner with group of friends had abysmal service. First waiter forgot our table and second waitress had a poor attitude when asked about very late food. Food was OK but definitely not as good as in the past.
1. Wings, Pablo Picasso salad, and pazooki are awesome.\n2. Great service and atmosphere.\n3. Pizza is good not great.
I had the lunch special Mini-Pizza while traveling through Tempe.  It was too salty.  Not pleasant.  The ambiance was very noisy.  The service was slow.  I would not go back.
1.5 hours late, then proceeded to lie to us about our actually reservation time being later to cover the fact that they oversold their schedule.
Susan started out great and helped with my green pool problem.  Then she stopped coming and did not return my calls or texts.  I paid Susan for a month, and possibly a month and a half for which I got no service.  When I asked for my money back I did not get a reply.
I like to call this place Corner Inconsistent. The food always tastes great, but it is often not quite what you ordered, and rarely the same from visit to visit.
XL lobster roll 23 bucks! It didnt taste fresh ( Frozen), and had to much Mayo. \n\nAlthough I really did like the Hot dog roll that was drenched in Butter and toasted to Perfection!
The lobster mac and cheese was terrible. I also tried the lobster ice cream which was another terrible idea. Won't come back for anything else. Located inside the Planet Hollywood.
Good spicy Thai food buffet
They were just featured today on channel 5's dirty dining. Six major violations. What a bummer, I really like this place, but 6 major violations?
Cute place, high priced cup cakes for the size. Nice that it's gluten free but I spent $30 and really can't say any thing I bought was memorable
this place is amazing! the sushi is really good and i had the kimchi fried rice which was amazing :) can't wait to go again
Fast and friendly service with good music. The malasada sunday was delicious! For drinks make sure you go for happy hour.
I tried to go in, and it's closed already.
Ugh Riiiiiiigby. I love you. And I want to keep loving you, but your service has gotten atrocious.
I just don't get it.  The pizza is nothing better than average.  Anyone from NY will tell you it takes much more than a thin crust to make an NY pizza.  The service was very good and the Caesar salad was fantastic.  My quest for good pizza in Las Vegas continues.
Tried to make delivery over the phone, girl could not understand me when giving my address. I would give numbers, she would rearrange the numbers, get my apartment number confused with my street number. gave up and hung up.
Pretty good. Had the curry chicken.... Was pretty enjoyable but fried rice wasn't to die for. I got delivery and it was super quick. No complaints this time :)
The worst apartment complex tied because of the management and the people here are sketchy and now there are gangs but across the street from Panda Express and down the street from the wealthiest place in Henderson but the worst cops in the nation because they are sketchy to
Banh mi dog looked great, but taste was lacking. The dog itself was rubbery and bland while the topping of lightly pickled veggies was pretty good.
I haven't had a bad hit dog yet. Everything I've tried has been delicious. Service is fast and the fries are the bomb!
Ate a chicken corn dog & fries from here yesterday. I've been sick ever since. Vomiting, diarrhea, chills, fever....definitely food poisoning of some kind. If you decide to go here make sure everything is cooked all the way through.
Very loud for my taste on a monday night, but the man working the bar was beyond attentive. I tasted the well-balanced Reuben and some gooey fluffy delightful battered cheese curds.
So please tell me why this \"restaurant\" stops selling food before 10PM when they are open until 2AM....
Good food, reasonable prices and friendly staff! Would recommend it if you're nearby.
Good portions. Service ok. Food quality questionable. Still a new location so maybe they'll get better?  Sort of expensive.
For the money and the availability this is an excellent place.  Excellent value. Clean quiet and comfortable.
Way over priced! $23 for two salads and two sodas! Really!  I will drive to Stephanie next time!
Veggie sandwich is delicious. Love the sweet potato fries.  I cannot complain about a sports bar that carries La Crema Pinot Noir just for me!
A cool coffee shop with beer, what could be better? Well how about serving beer past 10:00 on a Saturday?  Totally stupid operating hours for the bar. Reminds me of of more like a dorm room than a place to go hang out in.
Consistently ok food. I adore the fish tacos. Other meals I've had there are literally not memorable. It is a small, clean little place. The service I've had here has been pretty good on most occasions, but can be a little slow.
Clean, small. Just make sure your make an appointment otherwise you will be waiting for a long time. However, if you happen to wait for awhile they automatically give you a free tanning session.
China Star had gone out of business. Closed.
We waited for more than an hour and a half to get our food. It wasn't even that good, it was normal. But the smoothies were better, very healthy and made with real fruits.
Left them a voicemail almost a week ago and never received a call back.
Very delicious. I had great customer service, as the staff is very attentive. And they have a great brunch and dinner selection! If in the Summerin area I definitely recommend trying them out.
No
Had them before they revamped their menu, had them after. Both were disappointing. Can make my own ramen meal from packet ramens.
Honestly don't know why everyone loves this place? The Yelpers below me must be drunk when they went here... Food sucks, prices are too high for quality of service and the people cooking the food look like convicts recently released from Tent City.
I specified no sauce on stir fry vegetables they were sopping.  I specified with a call back after order extra hot mustard no mustard in delivery the soggy vegetables were swimming in the plastic take out bag I called the owner he couldn't have cared less hate this place!!!
The service stunk other than the woman bartender. Three of the guys looked at me about 5 times and didn't take my order. This is a college/young crowd bar so I probably didnt belong there anyway so live and learn when your visiting from out of town.
Shared the saut\u00e9ed mushroom and hummus appetizer. Not bad. Different concept. Cute presentation but the service...... So slow. A cool place to chill at and have a beer though.
Amazing little place!  So many sodas and root beers!  Love it must go and eat waffle sandwich. Mmmmm!
The food quality has worsened a lot in recent months. Must be a new chef. Almost every dish has less taste and less meat. Too bad.
I went in one day for a Orange Julius and the machine was not working. A week later stopped in with some coworkers and chocolate cone wasnt available. A number of workers but awkward ordering and delivery system. I could not identify a supervisor/manager on duty during either visit.
Went in for a quick lunch time mani, the lady didn't speak much but was polite and friendly. Overall she did a good job but I was very dispointed that I was charged 20.00 for a basic manicure.
Food was actually pretty darn good.  The turn off was the whole time we were trying to eat , they were walking around killing flies. Not the most appetizing thing in the world.
Mediocre quality food. Tasted fine, but was lukewarm. The fries were cold and I recieved half a cup of fries. Not a good experience at all for over $20. Will not eat here again.
Had a little bit of most of the food. Everything we had was good at a good price. Service was good too. With the variety  of items no way your not going to get your money's worth.
Typical bar-type food, good beers on draft, lots of TVs......good place to watch a game.  I highly recommend the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich, or the Blackened Tuna sandwich.
This place has a nice selection of draft beers. The pizza crust is very good and the homemade pasta's are quite tasty.
Sat down to a dirty table and waited 15 minutes for service, one of us spilled a water and the waitress asked us to leave. She was extremely rude and unprofessional. If you want to eat at a dirty restaurant with terrible service this is the place for you.
Ehhhh the food was expensive and not very good. I hoped for better and have had better.
BAD BAD BAD!!! Need I honestly say more?? Bad service and bad wings!! What else would I go for?!?!? Wings taste like the Kroger brand hot sauce. Do yourself a favor and go to Native New Yorker.
Stylish place with a nice patio (when open). Food is decent enough, but really the place to come if you like Tequila. Four hundred types of Tequila on stock.
This place's bagels are just incredible.  They are fresh, chewy, and made on-site.  I had \"The Sexy\" which was awesome.  The owner rang me up and was incredibly friendly.  If you love authentic, fresh bagels, this is your place.
food was ok
Went there for lunch last Friday with my wife sat outside good atmosphere, flat bread was great!! The app's were good as well. I'll try it again
Never again.... Got wicked food poisoning. Wish I could have given 0 star but wanted to warn others.  \nBesides the horrible food poisoning the food was mediocre at best, the sauces were soupy and bland.
I love this place! The staff is wonderful and they make you feel totally comfortable! They know what their doing and will answer any questions you possibly have; I had a ton! Laser treatment isn't a peach but it's fast and totally worth it.
Delicious.  Great vibe and ambiance. I recommend the outdoor area in the back
I just had the veggie stir fry at #2 spiciness and it was really good. Make sure you order the lunch portion though or you will definitely be in a food comma for a few hours.
Clean, really good service, quiet, and delicious of course. :)
Cool little casino, part of the Flamingo, even tho I lost on craps.
Stopped in for some Gelato for my nephew since it was so hot out. I understand this stuff melts, but why did it seem like it was melting before she scooped it? the gelato did not look appetizing one bit.
Bad! Local produce? Try spoiled produce! Appalled by the lack of freshness! Vegetables were past their prime. We left hungry. So disapointed, we wanted to support a local business, but this was so bad! All the good reviews are lies!
Honestly, I stopped here to watch people instantly die while eating this garbage. \n\nIt didn't happen. \n\nSo I moved on. \n\nSo should you.
Not that good. I've had better burgers at Jack In The Box
Absolutely disgusting!  Would never go back, food terrible, service rude, can't imagine there are enough tourists to keep this place open for much longer.  Stay far far away!!
Great Schtick, as a previous reviewer wrote. I don't remember much about the food, frankly (I seem to remember enjoying the onion rings) so it probably wasn't fantastic. But the experience of eating made the visit worth it.
just ok....
Great service, great food, priced a little high, and the coffee is horrible. They need a light breakfast blend instead of the sludge.
Not fresh and overpriced. Service lacking.
You can find better for the price.
all i can say is that they give small portions
Good service, decor is OK, food is just not good. There are probably 10 places in town for better tapas. Would never waste my time going back.
The haunted houses were not scary and in the gates of hell there was a electric fence that will keeping shocking you I was shocked three times in the eyes the acting was poor and could tell all three haunted houses were thrown together... Don't waste you money
Garden Grille & Bar  is simply the most consistent gourmet restaurant I have ever been to. I am been going there for at least 5 years and have neve had anything but a fabulous experience.
Walked out bad service no attention after 10 minutes at table then another ten with no drinks. Trust the reviews don't go
The Running of the Bulls in Cave Creek is always a good time!
Deeelicious nachos!!! But their pricey
Great little place. Drinks are a little pricey, but the bartenders are really fun to watch and the atmosphere is really great. We had alot of fun there.
Not too bad... good subs, kinda small though. 5 inches?  A+ Meatball sub tho, well done!
After entering I signed in and then waited ten minutes, and still no one acknowledged me.  So I went to front desk and said I was new to this service, she told me to fill out paperwork.  All the ladies behind the front desk were very busy chatting.  Where is customer service these days!
I didn't have an option but to choose at least one star. This is the most horrible food I have ever tasted.
Purchased botox coupon on social media site and not at all satisfied - even returned for touch up with no results...makes you wonder and question if syringe was saline or botox.  I would not recommend or return for services.
Great place!  Very clean, friendly, fast.
I went to Toast expecting an average breakfast, but they exceeded my expecations. I ordered the stuffed strawberry french toast  (delicious). I appreciated that the french toast was not soggy. The managers were friendly.
Great western omelet! Hash browns are great and I would definitely recommend the cinnamon raison bread and raspberry jelly! Service was A+ as well, coffee never ran dry.
Pretty good food and fresh. People are super friendly. Decent prices also.
I've never been a big fan of mall restaurants or bars. Though this is an improvement over Maria Maria, I'll go back if hunger or thirst kick in while shopping, but its not worth going out of your way for.
Pizza not as good as Luigis. Very pricey. Almost 3 bucks for a plain cheese slice.
I was not a fan of the psychedelic \ng strings, the neon electric pants , the store doesnt \nhave nothing nice  unless you want to wear a tutu and some crazy ass pants
Great beer selection and pretty good wings. Last time we got two large orders to go. They were over charred and tasted like they had been cooked on a dirty grill. Pretty yucky. Usually they have decent wings though.
Great atmosphere. Awesome bartenders. When they feel like it occasionally good electronic club dance music. \n\nPlease note apparently no ski hats are allowed inside...FAIL.\nSmoking is permitted so do it up.
Food took forever.\nPeople working there just seemed annoyed that people were there. Waitress making annoyed sounds and gestures to people behind their back. No good.
Stay away, the kabob meat was reheated. My family said never again.
Food took way too long.
I did not like the food. I see a lot of oil in curries. I don't recommend this to anyone.
This night is super busy! Enough meat Togo around though!
Good Service, Good food.
Not a huge fan. It was okay at best. I've been to a few of these types of places around town and this one was average.
Tacos were Ok
Ambiance yes.... sushi not so great!\nEel was fishy tasting, not very fresh same with Big eye tuna.\nA few other sushi places in area offer fresher fish but with less ambiance.
Wonderful!  The food, service & atmosphere are great.  Miso carbonara is so good without the richness.  Deserts are excellent we had the tiaramisou.  Next time we try the creme brulee.  The staff is gracious and friendly.  We will be back.
It's ok, it needs more fresh produce somewhere in the market. there are nice vendors there, but it needs more market types.
Cool concept, slight miss on execution. Half the booths are closed on Sunday. No designated parking just for the market, we got turned away across the street by the church organization. Parking garage closest to it charges $2 per 20 minutes.
Food is mediocre but the popcorn is awful. This is the only theatre that serves extremely salty popcorn. How do they manage to ruin popcorn?? Servers are a mixed bag. Few are good, others are sleepy. Don't go here for the food.
A nice change of pace from the cookie-cutter breakfast places. Decent food at a decent price with a friendly staff. If your looking for a nice small business to spend your breakfast or lunch money on, then this is it.
Great beer selection but way way way too expensive. $15 for two beers? Save your money and go elsewhere.
Pizza was delivered in a timely fashion but it was burned and almost inedible. The cheese bread was even just average. I will not be ordering here again.
Blink and you may miss the parking lot entrance! This QT is conveniently located but finding the entrance to the parking lot is easily missed if you don't enter from the  neighboring business's lot.
15 minutes for two lattes!!  The staff finished 3 orders that were behind me before realizing I was waiting for something. You're very lucky that there's not a Starbucks in Verrado.....
Beer was okay.... Couldn't find anything on the menu that wasn't fried or full of bread.  My friend ordered a pizza and it came out wrong three times.
Ok ohso I love you but seriously you charge a dollar to sample a beer?!? Just one beer?! Thats kinda ridiculous
Not surprised that they've gone under. Bad service and no lunch menu - who wants a huge $25-30 dinner entree at 12 p.m.?
From the moment we entered the building we knew it was a mistake.  The staff was a bunch of kids that didn't appear to be the least bit concerned with offering genuine customer service. The menu was extremely limited and the food was marginal.
Great brunch for $20. Food is fresh, taste good and good service.
The place is nice but it would be great if they would be consistent... Every time you go the food is different
You get what you pay for then a little more here I just  hate that they advertise hot and ready pizza but I order and it's 6 min for them to make it how is that hot and ready
Absolute ripoff.  I took 3 shirts in and they charged me 19.47.  I'll never go back.  That's what I get for not checking yelp first.
Hit & miss.   Today was a miss. Eggs and bacon both under cooked. Pecan pie was runny and glopy.
Tho Pho here is great! Broth tastes almost good as Pho So 1 :)\nthe restaurant is very empty around 4pm. (Maybe that is the only reason they have times to keep the place very clean all the time lol ) \n\nGood place!
Music was awesome! Drinks were overpriced enough that I gave this place a two. Maybe that's par for Scottsdale but I don't think 18 dollars for a captain and coke and a double red stag and coke is acceptable.
Had to go in when I saw the sign. Didn't expect to buy anything, but I found a cool zombie Hello Kitty shirt for my daughter. It's a little too big, but maybe after it gets washed a couple of times, she can wear it to kindergarten.
Real neat idea.  Neat to visit.  Some useful stuff.  A bit overpriced.  Staff very helpful.
The lady that answers the phone is rude. And btw, they no longer accept spay/neuter pet vouchers.
Great place to get that hard to find spice type of stuff.
Good service shop for basic things like a smog or quick oil change.. Prices decent, about $16 for a smog and $28 for an oil change.
This hotel was just terrible. The room they checked us into had fixtures falling off the wall, no phone and no working light! When we complained, they put us in a room not much better. Would rather camp in the parking lot!
Old Town Whiskey is closed.
My breakfast and my boyfriends was very bland. We got the waffles and the blueberry lemon pancakes. The pancakes didn't even slightly taste like lemon and the waffles were mediocre. Although the presentation was nice, I won't be coming back.
the music is wayyyyy too loud, very nice staff but I felt like I couldn't have a conversation because the music was turned up so much.
Staff was dressed in 20's gear, cute touch. Still very pricey drinks, but a very cool and mellow atmosphere. Good place to sit and talk - Saturday night they had a DJ spinning live.
Well, my favorite breakfast place just joined the mundane!  The quality and service still remain, but my favorite part of eating there, the weekend menu of surprise breakfast dishes is dead, the new menu is just like other breakfast places.  Please bring back the weekend imagination!
Went in for breakfast burritos after a big night out. Aside from my burrito leaking some sort of sauce on my pants, it was fine. Nothing great, but not bad. Did the trick and under $10.
Great place to relax and getaway from the vegas strip! Lots of competition near by but I was completely satisfied!
Food is good and service was good. Food is more expensive than IHOP.\nMe and my wife returned several weeks later and she finds hair in her food. We will NOT return.
It is pretty good place to get boba. The snow ice is good and sweet. Only problem i have with this place  is that the service is not that great. I keep coming back because the boba is good.
They have pretty much everything you'd expect in Armenian market , i liked it.
So apparently 9 out of the 9 employees working today were new? They all were standing around with a confused look on their face. California Turkey was nothing special.
This is the poor mans Paradise Bakery. Sandwiches are 95% bread and my Thai lobster curry soup was missing the lobster. It took all my energy not to ask for refund.
Very good pho. I've had better, but I was very pleased with theirs. I ordered spicy but I had to add sriracha. Perfectly hit the spot after traipsing in the snow.
Food was fantastic. I had the French Toast and my fiance had the grilled cheese and we both loved it.
The food is excellent here and it's never too crowded. Lunch prices are reasonable, but dinner is pricey.\n\nWe really enjoy ourselves here.
Overpriced coffee, $10 boxed sandwiches and salads...yeesh...I'll take a walk.  Though Lavazza is good, this was not a spectacular cup of joe.  At $8 for two 16oz. cups I'll pass.
I give this place a 0 on a scale of 1-10; 10 being the highest. Worst customer service. This place argued with me and wasn't welcoming at all. Although, the food might have been good enough for its pricing, I surely did not have a good expeirence.
had really high expectation for this place , but unfurtunately it wasn't what i was looking for . too little flavor for my taste
The pasta was great! A friend had the sandwich and it was eh. But the worst part was that the tables are bolted to the floor!!! So our party of 7 could all sit together because there wasn't a table large enough to accommodate!
Enjoyed the Tortellini and the service was excellent. Bypass the wanna be places like the Tilted Kilt in this area and go to a real place for food.
Worst customer service. They are so rude!  I go there because it is right down the street from my work. The cashiers are not friendly, the staff is not helpful and if you go there within 30 minutes of closing,  they are even more rude. If possible.
Here for the ribbon cutting with the las Vegas metro chamber of commerce,  taking pics
Good choices, great variety. Love Mongolian BBQ. This place has a chain restaurant feeling, but they do a great job!   Recommended, especially during lunch time when the price is lower!
We had a wonderful waitress Astrid! But the host had a face like she had just smelled something nasty the whole time she was very unwelcoming and rude to other customers. But again our waitress was wonderful
RUDe!!!!!
I like the fish tacos and have ordered them several times before. But today I stopped by to place an order and was completely ignored. The person at the front desk just kept speaking Spanish to someone who worked there and never made eye contact. I left without ordering.
Did a so so job. Expensive for the clumpy lashes I got. I've had far better lashes since.
I had the free range chicken, which was ok.  Although it was very tender, I thought there was going to be more flavor.  The bar cheese bread was good.  The mussles were delicious.  The cheesecake was probably my favorite here.
Grass fed burger! And four types of bloody Mary's!
Hooray for sub-par service!
Went with a friend for drinks, they close super early (830). Wha they began closing at 815 piling up tvs and electronics in the booth next to us. I won't be back.
I had a Oreo cupcake and a tiramisu one. the cupcakes are good but more of a muffin consistency than a true cupcake . The cream on top is good, but I've definitely had fresher.
WAY OVERPRICED!!!  This is a great place for first timers but i doubt they will be getting frequent customers returning.  Their menu is just too expensive.
Guacamole was absolutely amazing; had the camaron quesadilla which was also fantastic.  Nice, mellow music on the back patio.  Check it out!
Great food, huge menu with a good selection. Tuesday's are 4 tacos for $10, great deal! Service was a little slow but everything else was very good
Place is pretty busy but my hot and ready was just that so not too shabby. It is still just a five dollar pizza don't expect restaurant quality.
If you are in a pinch for some quick food while at the hotel this is not a bad choice.  I had a sandwich from the deli - the bread was fresh, meat tasty and cooked just right.  Unfortunately you pay hotel prices for a small portion.
Never would I step into a birks again because of the snobby salesman. They think their clients don't have enough money to buy a product they want to see first or something ? \n\nHorrible customer service.
Excellent shrimp cocktail and shredded beef tacos....some of the best I've ever had...customer service was very welcoming and friendly
I came here once and won't be back. The drinks were low on alcohol and they messed up my tab.
Great lunch and amazing service.  Their smoked brisket sandwich was incredible.  Plus their patio is perfectly covered and comes with misters, which will make this a great place to stop by during the summer.
Great addition to the neighborhood.  Good food & coffee. I wish they had longer hours because I like to eat lunch at 3:30. Or a mid afternoon tea & pastry.
At here last night after a rough day.  It helped.  Ordered the duck breast and duck/pork meatballs and loved it.  The chocolate souffl\u00e9 was good as well.  The staff were friendly and service was great.
Went there last night and had the meatloaf.it was very good. The service was good and the staff was very friendly and engaging.
Great drink selection. The queso dip and nachos make it worth the trip.
Pretty cool place for dancing. The bartenders are quick and very professional, they can make you any cocktail you can only imagine. Like the patio area with Paris view. Had an amazing time with my girlfriend.
How can you go wrong with Hickory Tavern? Just don't get the Tennessee Lemondae, unless you like weak drinks.
I took my mother on Monday, May 14, 2012.  It was her first one and the therapist provided extra care.  My mother is asking for another one very soon.
Got into town late Sunday night and needed a place to eat. The guy at the hotel mentioned this place was nearby. Ordered a pizza and a salad. Both were terrible and lacked ingredients shown on the menu. Avoid.
Had the pepper, cheese, and spinach pizza.\nIt was really tasty and I want to give it a higher rating but it was so bland.\nThe thin crust is great though!
I gotta say the burger was super yummy... fries not so much!
Well they no longer have the Chicken Strip Cheese sandwich and what they replaced it with pretty much sucks. Other than that its like a normal hooters with some new wing flavors and steak fries.
What a line on the weekend....the people in the office could be more organized and the rent a cop could stop trying to wave his arms and talk less!  Get people in and out!
Red velvet pancakes are the bomb, fluffy soft, not too sweet.  They made eggs well with crispy edges.  Large portions.  Unfortunately,  no specialty coffees.  Kinda out of the way to travel and neighborhood a little iffy. Food delicious,  very Hawaiian with spam options.
Pretty good Korean food. Ordered the premium short ribs and kimchee chigae both very good.  Definitely worth checking out.
Food was okay. Slow service even though it wasn't a full house. The staff also were annoyed of us because we kept asking for more salad??? I mean we were a party of 13!!! I prefer TOFU HUT!
The meat was ok but there is not a big selection for the price.  $20 for lunch and $30 for dinner with about 8 items for lunch and 13 for dinner. My friends and me ended up getting sick the next day so, I will not go back to this place again.
Horrible door men and promoters. Waited in line 20 mins after being comped. Got to the door and told couldn't get in without a ticket. Bullsh*t. Do not go here.
It was so fun!! It is a nice big club!! The line is so long but when you get in it is going down!!
I was here for my 21st birthday. It was a lot of fun, but it was rather small. It felt like they were double their max capacity. The dj was awesome, but again the dance floor was too small and crowded :(
I went on a hip hop night and not  much hip hop was played. However, it was still a good time there.
the waitress service is suspect!!!  they sat us  in a corner and forgot about us!!  our waitress was horrible!!!!!!! and rude!!!!!    but the food is good!!!!!
Terrible meal, terrible waitress. Nothing good to say about this place. Waitress dumped drink in my lap, forgot 1 out of 4 meals. Would never tell anyone about this place.
Pizza was good. Just good! After reading an article online that touted this place the number 3 pizza place in the US I had to try. I think the food would have tasted better if the prices were more reasonable!
Portabello mushroom, roma tomato, feta cheese flatbread was delish. A little pricy but you're paying for the all natural local ingredients which made for fresh taste. Got that and bottled h20 for about 10.50$
Did what they promised.
Awful sushi! Not friendly at all. The waitress had such a bad attitude. Never again. Not even for free!!!!!!
Please keep this place alive. Quick, easy, delicious - it's the American way.
I love their special vegan menu with a lot of great options. However, don't attempt to sit to long in the booth or you will be asked to leave even though the place is not even half full and your bill is over $200.
Very average pizza!  Very over priced based on the cost.  Asked for a side of sauce to add to my pizza, had to pay for the side, was tiny and when I asked about it the response was its our policy.  Hate to say it was a waste of time!
We had to try it after golf. Food was OK. Scenery was very nice and extremely young. Why do 18 year old girls think that tatoos on their bodies make them attractive??
Came here for lunch with work and ordered the salmon kale salad. Not having high expectations, it actually had a great oriental taste. The salmon was a little overlooked but the kale was delicious. This is a good bar to come to for some food, drinks and sports.
The long haired guy tried to tell me my bike didn't work (it does work) and that I needed an $80 tune-up for it to work again, I've been riding my bike all day with no problems!
Some common-a$$ food. Nothing to see here folks. Interior is lame too. Waitress was nice though. Go to Mac's or Mert's if you're in the mood for this type of food.
Not only is the bbq close to me but I can also get gas and a car wash at the same location lol. The food is really good but the sauce is just so so and thats the only reason it's not getting a 5 star.
This restaurant has a nice classic American decor; kind of American farmer, Route 66ish decor..very quaint. The food was very good and the service was really good too. Family owned, you can tell that they really care about their customers.  We will definitely be coming back.
What a bargain this place is, veryyy inexpensive and real indian food. The buffet is really good and the service was very personal, the owner of the restaurant came over several times to our table and gave very good advice on what to get. Everything was fantastic.
The food was expensive and not that good. I had the pasta beef dish
Worst fillet mignon I've ever had!! Medium does not mean charred and dry!! The soup of the day was alright, but nothing to write home about. Not going back.
Food is ok. Could definitely be better. Their gumbo is actually very good. It is not a very good place to have a casual drink. The layout is very poor and the bartenders are horrible. They don't work the bar and seem annoyed when people order a drink.
This taco bell is close t my home and we enjoy it! They've never gotten our order wrong. However they tend to close before they are supposed to but no overall issues.
Went there last night and the staff was friendly and courteous only thing is that they did forget the nachos I ordered though.
I was sadly disappointed, after reading all the excellent I thought it was shoe in. not so much. Long wait for food then it was just ok. Id rather pay more for food that tastes amazing and doesn't take forever to get.
Gorgeous boutique with runway pieces in the back including all the newest accessories - was fantastic viewing S/S2012 in person. Staff was super-friendly, fun and thoughtful. Store is well laid-out and spacious. Definitely recommend for serious eye candy.
food is always cold, never prepared right, the workers are rude, especially someone by the name of laurie and the manager ALMA,  dirty place.
Friendly service. Good pancakes. Good tasting water. Nothing else to say at this time. (Wait. Who puts cheese sauce on their omelettes? Yuk!)
Good quality food. The eggs are fresh, and received order quickly. Service was a little slow, but coffee was good.
Not sure why a surf shop is needed in the middle of the desert.  Maybe because you can surf in the monster pool at the Mandalay Bay.  It is really no different from the other chain stores that you can see in Hawaii or on the coast of California.
So good and affordable! Can make any pita anyway you like it. I wish I lived on this side of town so that I could eat here more often.
Super impressed with the vegetarian options and I love that it is right next door to Gangplank! I get my lunch at Planet Sub and walk on over to the Wednesday Brownbags. Perfect!
Don't waste your time here. This place is so slow you will die of old age before you are treated for what you came in for. Lethargic, non-caring staff and I'm pretty sue the doctor naps in between patients.
Something has changed at this location...I'm a regular here and the drive thru service has been slow for the last 3 weeks...If doesn't improve looks like Dutch bros will be worth the trip.
Management here SUCKS! They would take a to-go order by phone claiming they're too busy. Taking a look around they're not busy at all.
Food is average, especially for the price. Small quantity too. Service not terrible, I wasn't done with my soup and the girl just took it away without saying anything!!! Go somewhere else if you want to have nice Asian food. You won't find it at Sato & Chan.
Well I went in here looking for gifts for others, but only came out with stuff for myself....hummmm something is wrong with this picture! \nI love Ross stores, I shouldn't have even started looking for stuff for me, it get's me every time!
Had lunch there today. Good food, however the girl at the register could have been much friendlier. Much improvement needed at the register. Again food was good.
A family member brought a sandwich from here and found a pubic hair in it. When she took it back and told them, they laughed at her. If I could shut this place down I would! Disgusting, immature staff.
Heaven, I'm in heaven... Bacon
Horrible service, sloppy install, and late for appt more than once.  They had to come out multiple times before finally I gave up.  To top it off they damaged my car and didn't tell me.  Stay away!
Not authentic mexican food as advertise, disappointed.\nBurn beef, hard to bite commercial flour tortilla, nothing to be excited about, maybe the only mexican is the owner, sad.
They were off their game! Took 40 minutes to get our food.  Tables were dirty, customers were unhappy, food was so-so.  Just lots of little things that really built up and made for an unpleasent visit, will be hard to return anytime soon.
Menu was confusing. probably will try the other ramen spot next just to compare. Spicy options are limited. Gyoza's weren't that good. Ramen was mediocre at best.
Decent thickness and nice roast of chashu. Spicy misco doesn't go over the good taste of soup but I would still prefer the original. I will not order Gyoza next time because I am  going to save space for the ramen.
Honestly wasn't the best ramen I've tried in Vegas. The gyozas (pot stickers) weren't as crispy and the broth was a little too oily for me. This is coming from a native Japanese girl so, yeah.
The place is jam packed with stuff I do not need, but fun to look over.
Jets is delicious. You will not find any pizza place in town that gives better pizza than Jets. As a frequent goer, I recommend the 8 corner pepperoni with cheese on the crust. Also, the barbecue chicken will not disappoint.
Yum! Glad to see some new variety in town. The little spendy, but worth it!!!!
My wife & I went this buffet restaurant for lunch recently. In our opinion, we sampled many dishes, including the Mongolian Barbecue & also the sushi.  All dishes are average.  The waitress was friendly.
Very bad service.  Their payment method is very strict.  They charge about double what you would pay in Chinatown.  They aren't interested in repeat customers as they are rude.
Great spot for drinks and noshing...\n\nNow if the other people in front of me in line would just go away....
The car wash does not work very well. People inside were nice, but paid $6 for a brushless wash that should be called a wash less wash.
It's unfortunate that they don't charge a dollar or two. The quality if this theater is in par with dollar theaters. Goodyear needs a quality theater!  Both dirty and poor quality sound.
Nice clean grounds...always feel at home here.
Had my nails done for my wedding. VERY overpriced and quality not the greatest either. Just went because we were staying at the Monte Carlo. Would not go back.
For an airport eatery this is above par, hense the 4 stars. Decent medium well cooked burger with slaw. \n\nWould be a 3 star outside of an airport though.
Good burger, good waitress. Just good thing it's at the airport. Not exactly sure would have went out of the way for it if it was in general public area.
Good food, bad service. They took away our drinks (whole table) for a refills and it took 5+ minutes before they returned. I didn't even gave any water.  Had to walk to front to ask for our check too.
Food is ok, not great.  I've had way better.
This is your typical greasy spoon place. A run down resto that has amazing hot dogs, fries and poutine. Not a classy place but a great spot for a quick bite.
Pretty solid soup dumplings, and definitely worth the price, but I prefer the location on Lincoln.
Terrible food. Food all seems like it was from a box and cooked from frozer. But thank goodness there was free popcorn to fill us up. Possibly the freshest thing in the place.
Great ambiance and good service.\nWe tried the Ceviche, halibut tacos and the chocolate bread pudding. Everything was excellent!
Typical chain mexican......the salsa wasn't bad.  I had a fish taco and tortilla soup.  The fish taco tortilla was americanized as was the filling.  The tortilla soup definitely was pre-prepared.
Food was very tasty, the service was excellent but the margaritas were marginal.  Great atmosphere and people and I'd definitely recommend.
Not sure if it was because we were all super extremely drunk but the shrimp burritos were bomb.com
Worst can ride ever! The driver drives like a maniac! No meter, ghetto, and makes everyone car sick. Won't be taking any more cab rides from star cab.
I have eaten at this subway numerous times and enjoyed it. It is nice on convenient because it is across from the traffic chaos in desert ridge.  My favorite would be the new apple wood pork sandwich!  Really Gwooood!
this place has great food and great variety
I don't understand why this place is multiplying all around the city. The food is really poor. Noodle dishes are mostly noodles and oil. Rice dishes have the same sauce. pad Thai has very little but noodles. Save your money.
Good ribs. Decent brisket and pulled pork. Not my favorite chicken.  If you want some BBQ ribs - come here and get that; 5 stars in that department.
Great pulled pork, but very pricey!
I have visited with this store many times.  What I have been promised in contracts has never happened... And if you are not looking for a phone that gives the sales people a big commission, be prepared to be ignored.
Went to get a new phone there was only one guy working the others were in the back. Waited for 5mins then left.
In a word...yuk. Ordered takeout. If you like frozen pizza taste with a cardboard crust and canned sauce this is your place. Maybe kids would like it, but not adults who have ever eaten a good pizza.
I love Chinese bakery. They make beautiful cakes, not too sweet. Their breads are so moist and soft. I like their red bean buns, BBQ pork Buns, Coconut Buns and more.
the salsa bar is good, free chips and salsa.\nthe  people working on the counter are rude.\nhad the california tacos so plaine has no flavor\nwont be back
Pretty ghetto and the music is old. But we had a good time because the drinks were cheap, had a private space and were partying with good company.
I ordered the fish and chips. The fish was ok. The French fries were greasy, hand cut fries that were only half way cooked. They were so nasty I couldn't eat them. The price was $10. Total waste of money.
This placed closed a few months ago
Nothing exciting. Tasteless guacamole. Would have expected more flavour in a Mexican restaurant.
Cute store but so tiny plus they seem so overpriced for what they sell.  I enjoy the display but after going in Charming Charlie its hard to be willing to overpay for similar items and purses etc.
Soooo happy we came here!!! I'm not usually a fan of eating Indian food at a restaurant but we came here for father's day and we not disappointed. Everything was so tasty and perfectly portioned too. If you like Indian food, you must try this place.
Get an espresso drink, the brewed coffee (caf\u00e9 filtre) is mediocre and a little stale tasting.
The burgers and fries are good if you have an addiction to grease and salt. Also they are very expensive. When they first open and people got to experience five guys business continues to fall.
Service was good food was kind of crappy. It's kind of like IHOP with bigger portions.
shitty selection, go to h and m...\nalso shitty customer service. you are not allow to make returns.
Closed in under a year.... oh well Cream was better...
Some of the best tacos I've ever had. I just wish they carried pico de gallo or red sauce.
Man, talk about an express rental of food, if you know what I mean.  I think this place is a little gimmicky and the food is just so so.
Dis.gus.ting. I'm still sick to my stomach a day after.
very busy place.  you have make sure you check your plate to see if it's clean.  I had got 4 dirty plates they still had some food left on them
For the price the food was great.
Be afraid!
Mediocre steak house. Pretentious service. Don't let them seat you upstairs. Many better choices in Vegas.
I agree with an earlier post the staff was extremely friendly and helpful and the restaurant is clean. Not fancy, but very clean. The food was too dry for me.
Best revolving sushi in town compared to the one by Arrowhead and Teharu in Tempe. Reasonable prices. Quality and taste is better. Grand Canyon, Hawaiian and Spicy Tuna are the favorites. Flat screen TVs with sports games are available.
This place has good food but horrible customer service. They used to be wonderful and it was such a treat when I would drive thirty minutes just to eat here. I probably pass 25 sushi places just to get here and it was always worth it but the past couple times it has gone downhill.
I have this place another shot after a year hiatus and was very pleased. Food was great and service was awesome. Only reason I'm giving it 3 stars is because one of the sushi chefs repeatedly coughed and sneezed. Ha
This place is terrible. It dirty, the food sucks and the service is terrible. Do not waste your time or money. I came here once before and it had just opened and it was terrible. So I came back 3-5 months later and the food still sucks and now this restaurant is filthy.
The food is really good. However, the service could use some improvement. It felt like the server lacked people skills. Otherwise everything else was decent.
I took my 3 kids here, spent $40 and regretted every dollar! We won't be returning. There's much better buffets in town, I definitely don't recommend this one.
Its a cool place but as far as mini golf goes i found it too easy and cramped. It was worth visiting....but i probably wont be coming back.
The fries were good and crispy..the burger was a bit of a let down. I felt like my bacon was thicker than the party itself..I was a bit disappointed.
I think The D sucks. Fitzgeralds was more comfortable.The staff was great and friendly,the waitresses came around a lot more.there were more places to make change and cash in your tickets.I miss the Blarney Stone.I was there in April.Atmosphere was cold.
Meh was just there to get free yelp drinks..Just another Casino
smoky and old inside...not really a fan
I will never be back here, very rude staff at checkin, valet, and service. This is an old crappy motel that has a new coat of paint and a new name.  Awful!
Pros:comfortable bed, Great price 31per night, location, high energy casino, free parking. \n\nCons: dirty bathroom with leaking faucet, rooms on Fremont side very loud. AC is loud, our room was basic with no chair to sit in.
I have no idea what the owner's problem is, but he's incredibly rude. His wife, on the other hand is super nice (an odd mix).\n\nGreat space, rude owner and the coffee is average.
Great build your own burgers, crazy servings of fries. Always hot and fresh and cooked and topped to your order.
This place is perfect for a quick bite while at the speedway. The brownie shakes & new french fries are delicious. Can be a bit pricey for lunch.
Good food that fills you up quickly, like their prices too.
Soup taste good! I remember coming here when my friend was sick, and just knowing the soup hit the spot!
This guy is a scam artist!! Save yourself from going through this nightmare .He's had my car for 3 months everything's been paid for and is not even fixed!
I do not fly Delta often, but I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised and have no complaints.  All my flights along this trip were on time, and service was wonderful.
This place really sucks. Wish it would get out of Lawrenceville. No character, terrible food, and rude servers. Belongs in Station Square with the drunk suckers.
Terrible service. Never anyone around to help. Food was just ok  fries soggy. Took 10 minutes to get mustard for out burgers. Beers were flat.  Will never come back. So many other great places in Pittsburgh. This place is a complete waste of your time
Burnt hamburger. Took it back, second one same as the first. Disgusted. I just walked out. Left it on the table. Asked for another salt, she never came back.
Ice tea is awful!  Pizza has potential but the toppings were scant!  Our pizza was to have feta cheese...I expected more than the half teaspoon we received:(. Would like to see improvements in service.
We came away disappointed. The course is on a hill so the ball is constantly rolling into the edge. There also aren't very many obstacles. Needs a lot of work. The people that worked there were very friendly though.
Booked to inspect and repair some electrical issues. When I requested someone to come back because one light was still not working, I didn't get a response. Since that time, the other supposed fixes are not repaired.
Great eatery!!!!   The service was a bit slow but nice atmosphere and great food!!!
I ate hear the other day.  My fiance and I wanted to try it out for fun and it was actually really good.  I had the Cubano sandwich which was very tasty and the fries seamed to be freshly cut.  I will be going back.
Not the greatest
Sunsational is one of my hide outs when I need to get away from the house. The food is tasty and the coffee is excellent. I have often used the drive thru and the few times I have come by with my dog they have a biscuit for my little guy.
Great fun pizzas. Good wine. Would give 5 stars if service was better to ask about a second glass!
Horrible! The burgers are extremely small and not even very tasty I will never go here again! Ok service but the food was nothing special. Also over priced for the tiny portions they give you.
Great menu and atmosphere. Service wasn't the best, but the manager handled the situation very well and professionally. Unfortunately I found a dead fly tucked into the paper on my wrap. We may have had a fluke bad experience, but I won't be rushing back anytime soon.
Been here twice and both times have been good.
Good, quick sammy. Lots of options and always tasty.
I'm glad they put this location here! It's a high end fast-food burger joint with great deserts.
I went on 28th of December 2014. Everything is Okay except the STEAK. It was not the good steak I expected. I love steak and been to many steakhouses but this place is clearly overpriced. I liked oysters though.
The service was unorganized and the hostess was rude. We karaoke'd with friends and the DJ playing the music was also rude. We won't be going back.
Ever get that feeling the customer is really interfering with the bartenders work?  Yeah me to, this place is a joke.
Be prepared to wait for your food for 45 minutes. Also when it gets here it will look inedible and taste really bad. You will pay a lot too and don't say anything or risk an eye roll from the wait staff. Seriously skip this place
The absolute worst Mexican food I have ever had. Not only are the prices absurd but the food quality is low. I would rather eat from a vending machine.
One of the worst bars with horrible bartenders. Do not go if it is your birthday. There are many other great places Dow town than this place.
Overpriced and food wasn't good! It was a wild place with all the going on with the employees dressing up going around giving free shots etc., but food was bad and pricey!
The ham and cheese croquettes are delicious.  The meatballs were okay.  The artichoke appetizer was okay.  With so many options to choose from, I will go back and try more.  But, I will have the croquettes again.
We went to the location in Henderson just before the big Meltdown at the Paradise location.  The place was packed and the food was fine.
Omg this place was freaking awesome and the bar tender was freaking awesome. The tapas are amazing and the atmosphere was so great!! I will definitely be back because I loved it so much! Service was great and the drinks were bananas!!!!
Lots of food for the money! They are fast and food good...our favorite it the beef chimi and asada fries! Both are huge! Staff is always friendly.
Pricey but good. Good pizza and sandwiches.
Had the chicken pad thai.  The noodles were overdone, the chicken was gross (not sure what other word to use for it), and the sauce was sickeningly sweet.  Wouldn't go back.
I was pleasantly surprised by poutine. They have a nice variety of choices. The House Special poutine was my favorite. The service was good and plenty of room for our party of six.
Some of the best fish selection I have ever seen....a bit pretentious about making reservations...the 48$ menu is awesome price point for everything you get!!!
Very nice and grassy park- I wish the seating would get washed down more often or some bleacher type seating was installed- but over all very nice- people usually pick up after their dogs here.
Do NOT eat here! Customer service sucks! We were waiting for almost an hour and we haven't gotten our food so we left! Run far away from this restaurant!
give him a good review he will give you money off the cleaning! Great deal !!!
The car showroom is a waste of time and money.  Complete rip off and the owner is a jerk.  Do not go here!
Typical Vegas, went expecting nothing, got an incredible steak, seamless service and a good time.
I usually do not eat a lot of Mexican food.  I went to Cabo's for a Meetup.  The food was actually quite good.  I had the chicken pollo .......  I may return some time in the future for lunch.
really good mexican food at a decent price.\nreminds me of senior taco... gotta love the horchata fountain and chilaquiles
Great prices, lots of coupons available. Fresh tasty options.
The food is just not good. The crabs legs are so skinny. I should have gone some where else.
We found nothing we were looking for.  The staff was incredibly rude. I do not recommend visiting this store!
This place is ok. Have a blast.
Came for the vegan pizza on Wednesday night and none available.  If you are going to advertise vegan than please offer it.
I ate at the to go stand in the terminal, and it was awful. I ordered a bagel with cream cheese, and I got a stale bagel with one small thing of cream cheese and nothin to spread it around.
Food was great an fresh. Service was incredibly slow.
I was a fan, but would not go back.... to many other places to try
Not bad. Decent sushi. The duck bim bi bap was good. Extra half star for having Orion at the bar. View of the waterfall is cool if you're into that sort of thing.
It's food is over priced and the atmosphere is loud and chaotic. Even though there is an 'adult section', just consider this mainly a hot spot for kids and immature teenagers.
Got here at 645a, in and out ! Helps to come in early !
It's ok. First time customer and they got my order wrong. Waited over 20 mins. Finally got my order and had to add sugar to a latte? No way. Not going again.
Love the food. Not a big fan of the environment. The Chef/Owner/Namesake Antonio Park is charismatic but he lacks a staff around him to really make the restaurant work. Excited to see what it can become but not terribly impressed with the dining experience thus far.
They are not nice. I asked that half of my sub be wrapped to take home.  The server then informed me that they threw it in the garbage by mistake.  Did they try to compensate us in any way by maybe not charging us for the pie dessert? No.  Not even an apology.
Decent place but the overly loud and neurotic redhead manager/waitress lady is nerve racking!!!\n\nIf you go here to relax with a nice meal and a drink she will kill it. Her loud voice and constant complaining is like nails on a chalkboard
BEAUTIFUL cupcakes with a mediocre taste. The frosting of my cupcakes were heavy on butter and left a film in my mouth. The cake was on the drier side and lacked flavor. I'm not sure id be back.
Um, yuck. It was hot as hell, the food was okay and there were drunk people everywhere. No thanks.
This spot is great had a little trouble checking in as the system went down right when we got there, the free breakfast from 6-9am made up for the lost time will be checking out all the other spots that offer free breakfast for now on now that i know they exsist
Good food and vibe,l but stay away from the monkfish
Found a shard of glass the size of a silver dollar in the bottom of my glass.  The manager took $3.50 off of our bill. I've never been so shocked by such terrible customer service
Chili cheeseburger was great and prepared just the way I like it.  Good portion size, friendly service and a relaxed atmosphere.  I will go back next time I am in Scottsdale.
It is what it is, shaved ice in a hut.
Get your Hound on! Good Drinks, Yummy food & it's the spot to chill after work... okay & during work too. Woof!
It's 3 months after my initial review and the prosecco is still not chilled enough. What up????
I was not dazzled by the food.  The place is quaint for an uptown spot.  The food is definitely overpriced. I will not return on my dime, it would have to be someone else's.
Not very nice. Demanded  I turn off my car. Never had that happen before. Very hot day.
Really loud music...\nSam Adams is a big plus...\nStaff was unfriendly.
My husband said we got the worst pizza we ever ate there one night.  We tossed the soggy mess, and when i called back the next day the manager said i had waited too long to call and he wouldn't make it good
Staff was rude and pizza stunk!!!!
Horrible bank! Rude and unhelpful!
Two other customers in the store, five staff people working, and it takes forever for me to pay for my items due to a \"shift change.\" Horrible customer service, avoid this place; I am.
great tuna and salmon tempura sashimi! and they deliver!
Slightly better than dominos/pizza hut/little Caesars but the price doesn't pay for quality and amount of pizza. Save your money instead for another pizza place. Seriously 20 bucks for a medium sized pizza?
We like the Mellow Mushroom. Never had bad service there and the pizza is great. Good atmosphere and location.
Place was disgusting! Room was dirty and the maid forgot to clean it before I got in. This made me so uncomfortable!!! Not recommended
Ordered Chicken Biriyani and found a bone piece (with no meat). wonder if its from a left over plate.. yuck...anyways taste was also bad.
Ordered a Gilled Italian with \"NO Tomatoes\" to go as a suggestion from one of 8 people behind the counter. Didn't realize till I got home it was something totally different.  Food is just so-so.  I prefer paradise I think.
Fantastic music and the host is funny. If you love the 80's this is the place to be. But the drink prices are insane. Two vodka tonics was $28? I would tell you our total tab but it was ridiculous. I'm getting pre drinking elsewhere next time.
Beautiful space, awesome staff. I come here for the Duck Quesadilla, Beer Cheese, and of course, Stefan's phenomenal cocktails.
Went late night and they bar tenders were AWESOME. the whiskey bar and beer bar were separated. They had bands going and there was a lot of people. I like it and can see coming back again.
We ordered two combos...\ntthe refried beans were a bit watery-other than that it was pretty average. The rice was pretty good. The meals were under $15.00 for two people.
So the last couple reviews I've done have been kind of negative. So, I've decided to keep this one positive.\n\nThey have a really nice patio! That is all.
Very slow -- even without a lot of customers -- and very disorganized. You can't pay with the Starbucks app -- they have to take your phone and key in the number by hand!
Friendly staff, clean restrooms, standard cafe decor.\nthe menu for this place is very diverse. \nDon't expect world class cuisine from a cafe, and you won't be let down.\nFor what it is,it's fantastic.
My favorite place to go for fish tacos.  They are delicious.  I haven't liked the other items I've tried as much, but the fish tacos keep me coming back on a regular basis.
With so many decent taquerias in Chandler, differentiating isn't easy. But Senor Taco sets itself apart with tortilla-shell bowls (like a taco salad) and salsa bar that includes roasted peppers.
So underwhelmed. Food wasn't terrible, I have had worse in the land of BBQ but it's not great
This was my second time here, the first time I had it, the cheeseburger was sooooo good, but this time it wasn't so great.
Like chipotle with pizza, it was quick good service and overall pizza was pretty solid. will definitely return!
If i could give 0 stars I could. The service was so atrocious, its not even worth spending the time to review. Ended up walking out.
this place was a real dump  thus it closed
The office canceled appointments on the day of service twice. Very rude service, will not return.
I think all the hype about this place is for the dreamers.  I thought the cashier was inattentive, and was way too busy talking to his friends to pay any attention to us the customer's. The ice cream was alright but nothing to make me come back for more.
The place is good. Been here for lunch an dinner. Good selection of rolls and sushi. Decent ambiance.
We have eaten at Angela's several times, with friends, in hopes that it would I prove; it hasn't! The food is terrible, the prices are way too high for a senior community and the service is not so hot either. I would stay away! Lovely location though.
Good Burger but on the pricy side for what you get. I work nearby and was hoping for a lunch deal but they aren't open for lunch. Pleasant staff and service was good but no lunch no return trips.
Since my last review, Devil's Diner has undergone a change in ownership and a change in cook.  Preparation of the food is much, much better.  Tasty and at a good price.  The atmosphere is far friendlier as well.  :)
Food was very tasty and the presentation  was exceptional.  I would have preferred a larger portion. It seems in France you get generous portions, but French restaurants in the U.S. Not so much. It seemed a little pricey for the amount of food.
I would not return here again, it was very unclean, and the servers ignored us all night. The food was horrible, way try dry on the chana. I still love the indian place next them.
While the staff was friendly, my take out order was wrong--only discovered after I was home. The fries were hot, but so soggy they were almost inedible. Not what I expected from a business affiliated with Eat n' Park.
Will keep this short and sweet.   \"Don't Go\".
The burger was great and we had excellent customer service. Friday's are very busy. This is a great place for families.
Not the best not the worst. Average and okay but nothing to die for.
i have never had an issue  here. i like it
Pretty bummed, this place was awesome, I didn't have an issue with service when I went.  Food was out of this world delicious.  Not many gluten free and vegan places around, a loss.
Full of studying students and hipsters in their native environment.  Doughnuts aren't bad.
Great spot to eat lunch and dinner. Sundae roll is amazing!!!! The charge for the tea is the only reason they are getting 4 stars :)
Good choice if you are starved for sushi.  My kids loved the instant gratification.   Service was very good - we visited on Mother's day after a trip from Sedona and they had a flower for my wife.  Nice touch.
a 3 day kitchen remodel has turned into an 8 day job. all these 5 star reviews must be from people they know.  the only good thing I can say is that at least they answer their phones.
Expensive. They Don't have the red bull sugar gumming bear.\n\nOnly cool thing is location.  One of places I stay when I go vegas.
If they charge $11 for a tiny glass of friggin' Cadillac they'd better make it right. Boy, this place sucks. That is why I live in LA!
Bad service...mediocre food...what more?
These reviews are so right this is the worst store I have ever been to. There is a man who works there named Jason that is the rudest person I have ever met.  I have only found one sales person in there that knows what they are doing and has a good attitude.
Good crust and quality toppings...not bad at all.
Good flavor, good service, long wait and under done pepperonis. Gotta go to Grimaldis in Brooklyn to compare the two. Nothing special.
Terrible place to live! Maintenance crew is no better than the three stooges! Management lies about everything!  Multiple shootings, car robberies, police harrassments! What a nightmare! Can't wait till my lease is up!
Food is average at best.  Third time here and the peaks are the only attraction.  Way better than hooters.  Plenty of tv's to watch the games.  Great location.  Don't make a special trip for the food
Restaurant sympa, la nourriture est bonne et originale mais l'ambiance est un peu froide et le service impersonnel.
Upgrading Marty's - have gone back and while service is still mediocre and somewhat slow, the food really is well prepared - and it's always fresh, seasonal and delicious. This would be a five if their service could catch up to the atmosphere and food.
Not as fashionable as I had thought it would be.
This show was entertaining,but not as good as the SF show. Well worth seeing .
I am a loyal customer and love the place! The only reason I didn't give a full 5 stars is that it is pretty pricey but it's clean so I love it!
Just like many other Ritas, but this one is kosher which eliminates a few products that are even advertised inside the store.  Only reason why not 4 or 5 stars is because of the kosher options
You've gotta try the cotton candy ice with custard. It's simply incredible.
We stopped over while in Henderson visiting friends. Tasty flavors, friendly staff. Would come again if we were in the area and time was not a factor. \n\nThree frozen stars!
Great selection. Sushi. Hibachi.  Will make anything you want.
This place is dirty, and the staff are more interested in talking amongst themselves and eating than helping customers.  One dressing room (the second is filled with junk).  Not for me, but you go! animal lovers.
Linda would groom both my dogs. I enjoyed her service but unfortunately left that place because she no longer works there and the two lady's that took over are horrible groomers and the prices went up.
way to hot inside
I guess my palate just doesn't appreciate the coffee these guys serve up. For those of you you do like their stuff... Enjoy!
Had dinner there for my anniversary the other night.  The food was delicious, the service was great, and the portions were generous.\n\nThey are a bit pricey, but they do have Groupons available,
I loved the atmosphere and food.. Yummy..
Food was very good. Service was subpar. The bartender seems to ignored us and was very curt and distracted.
Modern Burger at the airport! Great breakfast burger.\n\nThis was a quick grab-n-go run, I really liked the breakfast burger. You'll pay more than you think you should, but no more than other airport food and it's way better tasting.
Cold and stale fries. Got the \"modern dog\" which is essentially a Chicago style hot dog. It wasn't clear whether they had bothered to heat it up or cook the hot dog as it was room temperature. Terrible terrible food.
Pretty good burger place in an airport! Got the breakfast burger and it was delicious. Bacon, fried egg and a juicy patty - what could go wrong? The price is reasonable but the portion was a bit small.
This place was ok. I know there's a lot of good blurb out there and that's why we visited. The service was excellent but the food and drinks were just average. And the bathrooms were dirty. Meh.
That place is horrible. We never get served and we got ignored from servers and bartender. They did not bring the  menus and didn't even ask us for drinks  for about 10 mins. So we just walked out. Again, that's terrible place to go.
No longer serving food :/ and not a huge selection of smoothies...\n\nStill nice to take advantage of a smoothie after a VegasHot! class.
Ooohh such a cute place that looks fantastic but the staff is as cold and pretentious as the menu.
NEVER USE THIS COMPANY!\nSimply called for a quote on a simple door repair and was turned down because Owner/Manager did not think it was worth his time??\n\nUse Vortex and save yourself the headache!
It has a good car wash, but the place STINKS! (Literally)
The falafel pita was ok, nothing special. The pita chips were soft and soaked with oil (I could squeeze out the oil). Overall it was disappointing. Pita Jungle tastes better and is healthier, and costs about the same.
The tacos are terrible. The shells are stale and the lack of filling that is put into the tacos makes them more of just a stale shell taco.  Customer service is a nightmare!
Always mess up my Menudo.  Always ask for no pigs foot and they always add it. They might think this is funny. That's okay. Going to El Mirage from now on. Added picture.
Their food is awesome! Yummy bagels and donuts and fresh coffee but their service sucks! They need to learn to be more friendly & have a little more sense of good customer service.
They always pass out their flyers at the house so if I'm lucky I get them before blowing all over the lawn kicker is they don't ever offer delivery in our area.
Shared a small white pie and cheese steak w/onions & cheese whiz w/my bf for dinner last night. Both were deeeelish! I would highly recommend to try.
Towbin Infiniti became Park Place Infiniti and the service quality and communications have declined.
Price - reasonable range\nService - prompt and friendly \nAtmosphere - parking kind of hard but has a nice outdoor area . Overall neat and hip\nFood - flavorful :) pretty decent overall.
Fun for a beginners
The food is great but I have problems every time I go to this location.  Service is very poor. I will not be going to this location any longer I leave upset every time. . .
Horrible place - they ran out of buffet items at 1:30 - then kept promising that they would come in 10 minutes for the next hour.
.Fake \"Chipotle\"
My friend just ordered a sandwich from here and the bottom her bread has mold on it. How disgusting. It should deserve 0 stars but it wouldn't allow me to. This mall is really going down hill into the dumps
Pool is nice, but not as ridiculous as the pools at the Flamingo, MGM or Mandalay Bay. \n\nChill atmosphere. \n\nYouthful crowd, but maybe not the \"scene\" some people look for.
Excellent job!!
We had breakfast here each morning even though we were with a convention that provided \"free\" breakfast.\n\nThe eggs benedict are to die for.  So, so good.  I dream about them.  Great service too.
The challah French toast with fried chicken is amazing...until you come back. I've been there three times already, always asking for the same plate because I loved it. Then I have felt disappointed by how the chicken has shrunk from one time to the next.
For a restaurant at an airport, it wasn't half bad! We had the yummy calamari, I had a mimosa, my friend had wine. The staff was friendly and upbeat, so I would go there again.
Super fun! Great artists and teachers. Good equipment, clean establishment, helpful staff and lots of paintings to choose from. Had a blast! Will definitely be coming back!
Came here super late like 3 in the am and needed food bad! Good customer service. They have a great selection. I had the pepperoni pizza and it was OK. It hit the spot because I had been drinking but don't know how it would have been if I was sober!
Can't beat their selection on children's clothing. I was commenting to an employee about the great finds for children's clothes and toys and she mentioned that's most of their donations. When I'm in town I'll make it a point to go there again.
Such a cool place! Stopped in for lunch and had a wonderful experience. Even got a free appetizer for checking in! Split an order of delicious calamari followed by a lobster roll. The roll was messy but worth it. Would definitely return and recommend to friends.
Went here for drinks for one night. They called last call and 5 minutes later they kicked everyone out, making my friend chug her beer. And meanwhile it wasn't closing time yet. Very crappy service.
Great patio and service, but the food is pretty bad. It's hard to mess up guacamole, and they even managed to do that. Come for a drink, but go somewhere else for dinner
The food here is great, but the service is always slow, no matter what. It took almost 15 minutes for soup and a scoop of pre-made salad, and it WASN'T busy. I have waited over 40 minutes in the past for a sandwich when it was busy.
Enjoyed a delicious dinner here last week. Friendly, knowledgeable staff,and good food. My salmon was excellent and my husband enjoyed the evening special - green chili stew.
Great service.  Large portions.  A bit tricky to find the place in the dark but it's worth it.
Cho nay gio lam. Nuoc leo khong ngon gi ca va lai mat tien. $8.25 mot to pho va cho lau lac gan het 30 phut moi co do an.
This place is quite close to the strip. Nice noodles and great new kinds of spring rolls! :) i always visit here for my vegas trip, especially in the morning after the crazy night
Actually, no star!!! Called in to inquire if we can order to-go because we have to catch a train, but the rude patron told us to call McDnonald's and hung up. Terrible customer service...
Impromptu stop here for a small bite.  Did happy hour with two visiting friends from Seattle.  Really enjoyed the place and we were all quite pleased with our food.  Mussels, fish tacos, verde stew and fried green tomatoes.
Everything is OK, prices are reasonable.  I think most of dishes are much sweeter than authentic Japanese style to me.  It is very casual place, it might be fun to come here after the long day to have fan.
Big slices, but not the most impressive place for pizza. Worth a try, but will not be our regular spot for pizza. Price doesn't match quality.
I really like this club gay friendly and ppl are 2 :DDD
The teriyaki bowls here are usually pretty good. Unfortunately, the service is usually pretty bad. Come here for the food. Don't come here if you want good customer service!
My favorite place to get breakfast. The staff is awesome, food is great and it won't kill the pockets! now I need to try something off the Lunch and Dinner Menu!
The food was not all that.  The customer service was just okay. Don't get what all the rave is about??
This place was terrible. The pictures I saw on yelp did not match what was on the menu and the staff was awful. To top it off screaming kids and you can't even have a mimosa with your brunch.
Great service and great food.  Especially loved the potatoes that came with my eggs Benedict and the waffles were fluffy and tasty.  Finding a parking space is a bit of a challenge:)
Great atmosphere, even better food! We came in for lunch, I had the blt with their homemade chips mmm. Would definitely go back!
First time in Denny's visiting Vegas from NYC. Hmmm NO Avoid this chain. Can we say extra extra Butter on everything including the butter? lol Yea no never again...
Good portions and cocktails overall. The best thing I tasted was the pretzel and fondue appetizer. Stay away from the curry chicken, it was small and didn't have much chicken in it.
Expensive Pool Food, nothing more!
The food was good. Excellent egg rolls, wonderful hot and sour soup, good pad Thai. However, service was slow and the noise level was harsh. We would get take out from her but would not come back to eat here.
31 different types of crafts on tap + some wines + great food what more can you ask for! Been here twice in less than a month, and will be def going back. Totally work a try :)
Great beer selection.  The wings and sauce were out of this world.  Cool restaurant.  Loud inside on a busy night.
The place was great looking and  the employees were great, but the food while plentful every item I had was lukewarm and average in both quality and taste.
if you're looking for customer service do not go to Bacchanal Buffet!  We hiked the maze to the buffet to show up at 10:01 only to be turned away.  Absolutely no compassion!
Definitely not worth the $35. It's decent as far as buffets go, hence two stars instead of one, but there are so many other places to eat where you won't get ripped off and have decent food.
I feel like a pig eating at the trough - that's the kind of food u get from this buffet after 2.5 hours wait. Don't waste your time and belly. Go somewhere else unless you like to be a pig - oink, oink, oink.
Had lunch buffet last week. It was a good meal but still disappointed compared to what I paid. Also disappointed that the variety of food is far less than what I expected, maybe because it was lunch, not dinner.
It's pretty good. Tons of food choices and there wasn't a line for us. Loved the sugar free cheesecake. Definitely worthy!!
Not bad.. Really clean. Great desserts. Liked it over most buffets in Vegas.
Not impressed at all!  Mostly lunch items at breakfast time. Most of the breakfast items were cold and not very well prepared. \n\nBellagio's buffet is MUCH better!
Good food, long wait. You have to give yourself at least 2 hours to stay in line. \n\nThe crab legs were great but I thought the prime rib was so so. They have a great selection of food and desserts and everything I've tried was pretty good.
I've been here a couple of times   The service is good the staff very friendly. But their food is mediocre at best. I really don't understand why everyone LOVES this place.  I would much rather go somewhere else to satisfy my chicken strip craving.
The food is good but the service is miserably slow. I go there for lunch on occasion and each time it takes over an hour and I come back late.
Went here for Brunch. Slow service. They ran out of Bloody Mary mix. Food so-so. Won't come here again.
This was disgusting ,me and my fiance both felt sick after eating at this place.. compared other Chinese buffets in town, the price was even more expensive than some of them..seriously some of the cheaper ones were better than this... i would advice everyone to avoid this place
This place closed.
This place was terrible!!!! DO NOT waste your money!!!! Frozen food, salsa from the jar and chips from the bag! Awful!!!!
Why didn't I check here first before buying the Groupon?  The wait is over 2 months and the only available time is 11 AM, which just doesn't fit into my work schedule.  I'll re-post a review if I can ever get my Groupon redeemed
They would only take 36 off for the $40 yelp deal? Floor was sticky and food was standard. I would not go back nothing special.
WARNING*** This business is closed. Me and my wife were going to eat dinner when we realized the place has been seized by the city.
The food was dry , I ordered 5 mini tacos and it was just carne Asada on tortillas .no pico de gallo or cilantro just meat . Ill never go there again
Nothing impressive about this place. The environment was not very welcoming and the ceviche I was craving for was tasteless.
Bad experience here. Food was wayyyy over salted. Couldn't finish it. I had the Carnita and Chicken Burrito.
I hate the Scottsdale location and Biltmore location is passable. Airport Blanco is superior for both food and service. Ask for Jodi.
I just tried Crust for the first time today and I am in love!  True to the name, the crust is crispy and tastes like a breadstick (they use parm cheese and garlic butter).  Prices are reasonable I'll be back for more!
My friend got the wrong sandwich ordered & my stuffed burger was just stuffed w/ mushrooms. Blue cheese dressing poured over top of burger making a mess.
This was one of my few choices for food at 2am...c'mon, Vegas!\n\nWhile limited, the late night menu was good, albeit pricey.  The Asian wings were fabulous!
Had a layover in Las Vegas airport, and decided to check this place out. Decided to get an iced tea instead of coffee. The lady working recommended the blood orange ice tea -- it was really good! Not too sweet, and it was an ice tea that was unique and different.
I remember seeing Coffee Bean in LA first and now it seems to be everywhere. I grabbed a quick breakfast and drink after landing in Vegas from here.
Burger is very sloppily thrown together. However it was very tasty!    Fries need to be crispier.  Cajun fries are the way to go!!    Service is very good!
The food is good but not great. The hamburger was very squished inside the aluminum and I would understand that at a fast food place but not in a place where they make it right there and then. I loved the fries though.
So came down here on a Friday night to check out the local scene.  Well the NO COVER advertisement is a lie and no one was even here.
Usually I'm a Starbucks girl but the Iced Chocolate Coffee I had was delicious! I look forward to trying more things!
The Garden is definitely an ok place to fill up your gas tank while you munch on some fresh produce, that is if you get a hankering to do so while traveling through Middleton, WI.
The Manager went out of his way to make us feel welcome and make our bike trip to the restaurant one that we won't forget.  Really friendly staff.  I think this new little restaurant has a lot of potential and room to grow into a great place to have breakfast and lunch.
My wife and I had breakfast here while staying at the Wigwam. The coffee was great. We both ordered omelets which were good sized and packed with ingredients. Very tasty and a good atmosphere.
Terrible. Tried the bulgogi sandwich, chicken noodle soup, and a mocha frap - none of it was good and it was as expensive as the awesome deli dinner I has the night before.
Eggs benedict sandwich great idea poor execution very bland and tasteless not enough ham English muffin was stale.
Visiting from Cali...this place was clean, staff was friendly & intuitive.  Reasonably priced, easy to find.
Best sushi I've had in Pittsburgh.  I'm surprised people have commented that it's overpriced, I thought it was reasonable for the quality.  A small BYOB, it's a great find.
OUT OF BUSINESS. Spice Asian Bistro now occupies this space. Can't wait to try them out and post my review!
Not a fan of the entrees so much (they are too salty for me), but the Frozen Custard is always great.
Place was disgusting. Couldn't even sit down anywhere for a drink. Trash and leftover food everywhere. Who knows how often wait staff cleans up.\n\nWalked in.... walked out.
3.5 star\n\nGreat neighborhood bar for a casual get-together. The food is ok and this trip we had great service. Good, clean spot to down a beer or two and roll on.
It's a fun place to go with a big group of friends. With indoor and outdoor bar seating I really enjoy sitting back on the patio. The blood orange margarita is my most preferable drink. The food there is decent. The service is as well.
Something was missing\nUsual suspects on tap...\nleaves more to desire
Slow slow slow bartenders..I thought id give it a 2nd chance. Still deadly bad, and I was in a hurry too, but still not good
I am a beer fanatic and they have a great selection here for a small bar. The staff let me try many different kinds and are happy to help. Good local place for great beers.
The two star is ONLY because I love hooters food...seriously the b*tchiest waitress I have ever encountered. The place was empty and she didn't even seem like she wanted a table! Will not be back to this location...ever.
I'm 1.8mi away and the and the crybabies would not deliver to bad I went to firehouse sub instead
Not great Mexican food, bad customer service.
Get coffee terrible taste and barely even warm. Pay for my coffee and my wife's hot chocolate get change back which the guy drops on the counter for me to grab and doesn't say anything next time you'll be picking up your teeth off the counter. Learn better customer service.
Nice decor, great service, very very mediocre sushi. Sashimi was OK but all of the rolls, from basic to specialty, were very muddled. Many other sushi options in CLT for WAY less $$$.
Great bagels, yummy coffee, friendly service. The ONLY reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars is they get slowed down significantly by only having one toaster. Sometimes it takes a very long time to get my order. Other than that, it's great!
HATE  Nothing.\n\nDISLIKE  Nothing.\n\nLIKE  The spinach curry. The chicken cutlet. The sides offered. The pleasant service. The close proximity to other local favorite spots.\n\nLOVE  Nothing.
Prices are not really any better than Wal- Mart. Clean & good selection.
Good family restaurant
This place looks much better on the inside than out!  Good pizza (they offer pizza by the slice at lunch) but the menu is a bit over priced.   Pretty good TV coverage so it could be a decent watering hole in South Charlotte!  I'll be back...
My husband and son and I discovered Z's tonight after a friend recommended it. So good. We had the Beef Massaman Curry, the Masala Curry with Chicken and Pad Thai. It was all wonderful. The service was great. We will be back.
Muy bueno pollo y carne!
Staff ruder than the main resto.  Yikes.
Stopped here  while in the airport. Had always heard about it from numerous friends. I didn't think it was anything to write home about personally.
There are two lines....
I had the daily special where you combine a BLT sandwich and a piece of pie. I don't have to mention that the pie was great but actually; the sandwich was not bad either. Friendly staff and a nice neighborhood adds to a great experience.
This place is out of business.
Creative, fresh, tasty & here to stay!\nI have had many items on the menu, breakfast and lunch, enjoyed it all.
1st time here.. interesting place. Food was good, on the small portion size. I will try it again.
The only car wash I will go to.  Extremely friendly service every time. They are fast,  efficient,  and cheap.\n\nYou can't go wrong here with a $3 car wash.
I ordered the squid salad from this place.. And I was throwing up all afternoon.. Don't eat here if you want to spend the day healthy and happy
This buckle is disconnected from the rest of the buckle stores and does not uphold the same level of personal service that you'll find at other stores in Vegas.
Sushi quality is not as good as the picture. Very disappointed. The fish on the sushi is slim and thin. It is worst than other 3 star restaurant,  so I can't believe it got four star.
It's not the worst option for fast food style airport food. They have veggie tacos that provide reasonable portions and nice scoops of guacamole. The rice is awful and the salsa is more like pizza sauce. Although it's affordable and quick.
Love this place. I like hot so the 3 is good for me. I always order the #2 with the hot ginger ale to drink. Nice atmosphere and attentive staff.
The bad: uncomfortable seating \n\nThe good: amazing food. Ordered level 4 and added hot sauce as needed. I must have burned off my taste buds...and liked every moment.
Service was excellent, but food was just okay.
It was delicious and they even brought out Thai chilis for me to pop one in my mouth as a dare which was followed by some refreshingly delicious Thai tea! Loved the raw oyster with the mushroom \"caviar\"
Best doughnuts = Krispy Kreme! And this location has wonderful friendly staff as well as being clean and well kept.
Wife got the Cubano and I got the blue cheese burger and a few tacos and Dos Equis. Food was really great and definitely glad we came by, sat on the outdoor patio and enjoyed ourselves!
Better than Wal-mart. A little dingy though.
Went in there on a Sunday with four people working and two other clients in there only. Asked for a pedi and gel manicure, they had me soaking in cold water for 30 minutes without them checking on me or notifying me of a wait before I just left.
Best food in Anthem. Been going here for years and food has been consistently delicious. These folks take pride in what they do and it shows! I hope someday they open a bigger place. Yum!
The fries are the best.  This place just isn't as clean as it used to be, starting to look like a Chinese buffet. They have changed managers a lot since they opened.
Food was okay, but coming from SoCal i've had better for less than half the price! The margaritas were awesome, but for $16 they better be!! I probably wouldn't come back here again, too expensive!
Great dinner items, the lamb was so tender. Desert menu didn't really exist, would have loved some more options to round out an excellent meal.
Javier's in California gets 5 stars! I'm new to Vegas and really miss it but this one wasn't the same. I will try it again some day. I'm glad the chips and salsa are the same.
Never order steak here! It was tough and not good quality for its price.  Steak was also bland and it was almost well done :(
I wish I'd has as good an experience as others with this cafe.  My bacon was burned and the coffee smelled and tasted burned as well.  This cafe is priced higher and the food quality is lower than other breakfast eateries in the area.  I certainly won't be back.
Fast and fresh breakfast! I like the simple things for breakfast sometimes and they do a great job at it. Will definitely be back.
uhm i get that im in vegas and things cost more...but ROFL WOW. theres a reasonable point in paying for something. \n\nto be dramatic...its like paying 10$ for a piece of gum.
I was pleasantly surprised by my lunch here the other day.  I had the turkey, ham and brie sandwich and it was delicious.  The service was friendly and I'll be back the next time I'm in the area.
Service was just ok, better than the last time. Ordered a burger medium well, got a Rare burger! Way over priced mediocre food. Drinks were good once we got them.
I'm sitting at the bar at this moment and have been sitting here for 20 minutes now and haven't been greeted by a single bar tender, waitress or any staff at all.
You definitely get your money's worth..only $14. I in a hurry is say its worth it, but if you want a real massage and your nails to really get taken care of..I'd go somewhere else.
Needs to communicate better.
Popped in for a few tacos today... The carne asada was lacking in flavor, no marinade, and pretty bland. The carnitas were very good and I'd eat a dozen at one sitting :)
It was an okay place to eat at. The restaurant was kind of small to me. Also, my friend got their food before me, so I had to wait and watch them eat before I got my food.
The food is delicious but my only concern would be the customer service. I've been there a few times.Twice, I've been ignored waiting to make an order while waiting in the front. All I see is the employees having a nice chat with another table.
So glad this place is open again fresh cut meat and cheese with fresh bread straight from the bakery
Drinks are great - wide selection of tequilas and tequila flights.  Food is so-so, we've had dinner several times at the wedge (trying different items) and have never been impressed.
Won't be eating here again. The tzatziki sauce was waterey and bland. Should be flavorful and creamy. The service was ok but the food was subpar.
NO SERVICE, Waited over an hour, ask for assistance several times, walked out and two other tables next to us also followed us out ..
The Artisan Burger with jalape\u00f1o bacon is the bomb.  Bartenders are fast and friendly
I am from Los Angeles, and this place is the closest to quality of LA. Mexican food I've found.
Me and my wife went to the meatball spot the classic ball is bland and dry. The stuffed ball I had was empty the pesto was bland. The chef needs to be given salt and pepper. Neather me or my wife will be back.
The food was fine but not amazing.  The decor is done very well.  The problem is that the service is so incredibly slow that even if the food was 5 star, the overall experience would still be average.
Great to have a new gas station next to my folks place.  Price is just right!
The food was delicious! I had the hanger steak and Tony had the clams. He ate every single one!
Half my nails were filed square and the other round. They don't know what they are doing. Waste of money.
This is one of my favorite places to eat for a fast and yummy meal.  Sometimes the staff is a little awkward but for the most part they are nice and you can't beat the food.
I had the chicken rice noodle soup and it was good, so was the fried eggroll. My husband had the chicken curry soup, I didn't care for that very much. Their thai coffee was good. I would definitely go back.
What's the point of opening until midnight when vendors are closing left and right and others are out of specials! What are we paying for?
A new restaurant with some of the rough edges showing. I'll give them another shot.
very small, and crowded, the most fun we had was taking a picture with a sexy zebra man.
This use to be one of my all time favorite stores! But it has changed soo much. The quality for some shirts or dress and pants is not worth the price. Everything is now like vail material. They use to have quality what happened?
What a disaster, not the food but the service. I would immediately fire the management. 50 minutes of hell waiting for food. Which never arrived. Asked for a refund. Will never go back. If you see a line leave as the management is a disorganized mess.
Most likely will not visit again. Overpriced for what you get. Slow service and cold food is unacceptable when there was one order before us.
Great spacious dinning area for family, friends and co workers. Pizza was delivered in a timely maner (20min). Prices are reasonable here. Courteous waiters and clean restaurant.
Not impressed.  I had barbacoa and carne asada tacos.  They were bland and small.  Nothing special.
I guess since they have the cheapest cash price for gas here in Las Vegas, you don't need to have a nice personality. The guys here are just plain dicks, one of them smelled of alcohol too.
Rip off 2.79 with car wash otherwise 3.09 what a rip.\nGas down the street is only 2.79 without the car wash , ice.   Drive further it's worth it.
Love this place! Teresa did an amazing job taking care of 30 pain in the butt engineers with grace. Thank you so much!!!
The ahi tuna tacos that everyone talks about. ..they are completely raw and cold.  I wish they had a seared option. However,  I was thrilled with the veggie enchiladas.  Vivian,  our fantastic bartender,  allowed me to get them 2 ways!
Crap..... giving two stars only because waitress was helpful. Shrimp is extremely fishy and everyone else's food was bland.
Great crepes...although it needs to open earlier and 7 days a week.  It seems that I have tried to go when it is closed as often as it is open.
Really love the vibe of this place. They make a killer Moscow Mule and always have great music playing. The prices are also really decent for this upcoming area. Lookout for their locals only red cad for drink discounts. Lastly - La Thai is right next door!
Spot on best authentic Mexican in the city.  Just had pork tamales and want more.  Run to these guys as they are future rock stars of Pittsburgh's Mexican scene!!
Delicious. Great food, we have never had a bad dish.
Pretty cool sports bar with great TV coverage, had a party of 12 so did apps and hordevres. Drinks were good but a little pricey and need better selection on whiskey.
Sat for twenty minutes before someone arrived at the table. Service very slow. Meal arrived having sat under a heat lamp. Steak ordered medium rare was now dry and well done. Eggs were dead. Wine list had nice selection.
Best eggs Benedict ever, although non - traditional. Great quiche but a puny slice. Great fritata, too. Leisurely service.
Drink service is fast. Sandwich/bagel service is so slow one wonders if they are getting stuff from other close Paradise bakery. Best to stop at copperheads instead.
Good soup, if I am stranded in summerlin I know exactly where to go if I want a Thai version of Pho.
Messed up my order the told me it was what I ordered. What I ordered was not even a soup but that's what I got. Then I had to pay for it? Won't be going back!
We came in for restaurant week, and will be back. The menu was excellent and service warm and friendly. Yeah, a bit heavy on the white hair crowd, but that is just fine with me. I am there to enjoy a great meal.
Great place to shop at, a lot of different stores to choose from.  Parking is fairly easy, especially when it's not during holiday seasons or early morning and early afternoon on week days.
Yes, this place is fast, but the front desk staff suck at customer service. The most unfriendly girls full of attitude. I will not come to this location ever again.
Cheap gas on the Western edge of town.
Go to SC to buy your gas, it's cheaper than Charlotte. This is not as cheap as going down to Rock Hill. I buy  gas here and sometimes use the car wash.
Great little waffle/breakfast joint on the South Side.  It was a little pricey and the service was sluggish, but the food was great and the portion was a decent size!
Went there around noon today and they were out of waffle batter. It's right there in your name folks. That was unbelievable.
Expensive, but food is consistent and pretty filling. I've had alot better ramen, but in Pittsburgh, choices are limited people. So if ramen is what you're craving, this is the de facto place.
Freezer burnt, mediocre at best ice cream. Won't be back.
Everyone seems to have a problem with this place, but I enjoyed some of the best fried rice of my life here. And my friend got some sort of popular Asian chicken dish and loved it. Didn't think it was overpriced and our server was great.
Meh. The location and the venue is great, but the food is only okay.  I liked the drinks, though! CREATIVE!!
The broth is weak and there's a funny taste in the meatballs. The one on rainbow used to be one of my favorites. The food quality and flavor have really slipped with the expansion. Much better Pho one block either way.
I went on easter Sunday because most places were packed. One of the worst places I've been to. Their food was terrible and was just overwhelming. And we asked what the waiter thought was good, but it wasnt wat we hoped for.
We like the soup but service is always a little slow. But the make your own soup choice is nice for picky eaters
Went from an A to a B and now to a C. Wasn't displaying the grade for awhile. Now they have their C up. I'm one of over 16 calls to the health board I'm told.
Most disgusting sushi ever.  As each dish came forward on the conveyor belt, it was like watching some bizarre game of chance.  Not really knowing if the next bite was going to make you sick(er)....
The last time i was here it wasn't as bad as i remembered it to be in the past. When you come here be prepared to wait and hour or two before you can leave. Also expect  below average customer service and bring some water and snacks lol you are welcome.
good location in the airport but the food was sub par.... not houstons like the hillstone chain...
Not worth it.
Ive been here twice and both times they have run out of cups! It is very maddening. Please have more cups. I do have to say the shaved ice is really good but Im really just interested in the Boba.
Expensive, small portions, mediocre food. Go somewhere else!
I love shanghai-nese food since I am shanghai-nese.  The staff was helpful in ordering stuff.  Food was quite good so no complaints.  I would come back when I am in town.
Horrible. Greasy, flavorless and overpriced. Captain D's makes better fish than this place. Don't waste your money.
Very disappointed...calamari was salty & Cesar salad had a bottle dressing not good. Overall food was average not worth the premium price!!!
Food was good staff is friendly but I think pricing is way to high for pub food.
Great food - miserable service.  The food is outstanding and reasonably priced for a brand name chef restaurant on The Strip.  The service was slow and inattentive.  Not a positive experience even wit wonderful dishes.
Food is good if you stick to the core of their menu.  They also have a good beer selection.  Great atmosphere for kids because it is loud.  Biggest complaint is the hostesses; they always act like you are inconveniencing them when you ask for a table.
I had a peets coffee and the bread n pastries smelled awesome...off strip find... I will have to go back to indulge in the pastries and update accordingly...
Best Chai Latte in town. We had a chocolate twist and a quiche lorraine. Both very light and delicious. Brought home a ciabatta boule, which was much more moist than we are used to but very good.
good place for us to have breakfast!
Steak was not cooked to order.  Server acted like she did not care.  Appetizer to share was small and not that good. Side Mac and cheese was great.
Nasty. I'd rather spend a little more for better quality food. This is one step up from Applebee's.
It was my first time to eat here and thought it was a nice little pizza place.  They cook the pizzas in a big ceramic open fire oven. I enjoyed the pepperoni pizza and the margarita pizza.
I personally Love Panera their food is different and tasty, Love the steak sandwich at breakfast, Frozen caramels are delicious and staff is great!
Not even worth a review.. will not spend any energy on corporate scum that steals from the poor.. Spirit Airlines of the bus industry mixed with soul plane.  WASTE OF $39 BUCKS! If theres ever a class action lawsuit I'm in.
Unfortunately they have closed and are out of business.
Great donuts and open 24/7.  I love their buttermilk donuts and they have these adorable little filled donut holes.
This is a nice quant restaurant with beautiful chandeliers. I was able to try several dishes and all time favorite was the crusted salmon!
Waited for over an hour for my scheduled appt. Barely any leg rub. My nails lasted half the time than normal. Will never go back.
Have not been at night but based off a traditional coffee shop, it's not conducive to studying. Food items seem interesting although I have not tried any.
Everything was mediocre.  You are better off going to Burger bar or Carl's Jr. to fill your burger needs.
It was a great burger, but the price tag doesn't support what you get (2 burgers, 1 order of onion rings and a drink = 75 bucks)... not this guy!
Look.  It's nothing more than a $13-a-burger burger joint. Pretty nice burger. Not the best.
Nothing special about these burgers. $14 for a cheeseburger.
Still no communication from TOCA, they obviously do not care about their customers. Oh that's right, we are not customers, we are patients. I was corrected by their staff. Thanks for pointing that out!
Just avoid this place if you can!\n:) other place offers better.
Terrible terrible food
Everything served in or on styrofoam, tasteless, overpriced.  My refrigerator has a bad smell in it from the leftovers:-(
The food is good but I'm disappointed at the stinginess .. They give plastic ware but I ask for 4 paper plates and was told I have to pay a dollar a piece? Really? Horrible business practice over something like plates!
I didn't have any food here but the service was awesome and the Bloody Mary is super spicy and delicious!!
No customer service at all. None. Zero. Nada. Zilch.
The tacos are good but not enough to fill you up and certainly not worth the\nPrice, waited a long time and got some really small tacos!!\nI would not go there again for sure!
Under construction when I visited. Small storefront with a modest selection of comic graphic novels and action figures. Also a selection of Fangoria and similar magazines. Kinda dismal vibe but that could be the construction. They also sold some snacks and drinks.
The one downtown has amazing customer service but I do not recommend shopping at the Goodyear location. Three workers were literally standing around the front door chatting and completely oblivious.
Windy City Beef N' Pizza is a lot of fun. The food is decent. I've never been to Chi-town, but it seems to represent it well. If I'm in the mood for a hot dog or slice of deep dish pizza I know where to go.
The bartender refused to serve my friend a water because she wasn't buying anymore drinks.
Skip this place. Cheap sushi, sure. But not very good at all. Just go to TA on happy hour and you get so much better quality for only a little bit more and so much more variety
Food is way to greasy for me. But if you like deep fried junk food this is the place for you.
\u00c9vitez ce resto le dimanche si vous \u00eates un groupe de 6 ou plus. Minimum 90 minutes d'attente :( mauvaise gestion des tables.
It was ok.... Over priced for some rogies, they were good but not the best I've ever had. . I'll give this place another chance tho. I really like the fact that they are open until 2 on weekends ...
A bit overpriced, both chicken and tri tip bowl were good but very dry....  This place also does not have a friendly vibe....  It's pretty pretentious.  Good intention with healthy food but smug is in the air...
Overpriced, decor is lousy, customer service is less than friendly.  Don't waste your time here.  Food is just 'ok'.
Took my daughters there for girls day out.  The decore is ok; I wish I could say the same thing for the food and or the service.   My daughters are grown with their own families;  none of us will be returning.
The French dip was really good. Staff was pretty friendly until we had to ask for something they forgot to bring and then they didn't show up as much.
Slow as molasses in an igloo. A line of ten deep took 25 minutes to go through. Also severely overpriced. $25 for a pre-made panini, two croissants and a bottle of water ($5!) yikes.
I am from Vancouver BC, never been to Dunn's before showing up here on a cold snowy night.\n\nI was really impressed with the smoked meat. Now I need to go visit the one we have on Seymour St. I didn't know we had.
Food is very good.  Service is poor.  AC never seems to be turned up enough.  Employees are kind of rude.  Get take out so you don't have to sit in the place.
What a messed up operation the help there this morning was certainly overwhelmed with the 5 customers they were trying to deal with the breakfast crosant was way to expensive compared to other fast food restaurants
Terrible service. Mediocre food.
The prime rib is not good. Not seasoned well. The service is decent but I barely started eating and the server brings the bill and never returned.
Its Starbucks. Inside the Casino. Coffee was yummy. Exactly what you're expecting when u walk in.
Ross is a hit and miss kinda place. They had very little inventory this visit. I was super disappointed. Maybe I just hit it on an off day :/
I was disappointed.   My shrimp showed signs of freezer burn.  Not up to the standard i expect from Bubba Gump.
Bland food. Serving wasn't well eg rice was cold, gyro wasn't well done, etc. kale wasnt well cut... not recommended.
I like this place for the most part but don't make the mistake of offering the eggs benidict it is sourer.  The poor lemon in it
This is not Fine Art photography.  Having money and friends to comment and say it is, does not make it so.  I have seen better pictures on tablets and phones.  The video is laughable and so amateur its pathetic.  Look at some real photographers and artists before launching this joke of a gallery.
Currently at fastmed. It's been close to two hours and still no doctor or PA or whoever to see me. Only 3 people when I got here in waiting room. definitely would not recommend this place. Too SSSSSLLLLLOOOOWWWW!
This is the worst sushi place ive ever been to in my life. Taste awful. service was so slow, one waitress, one sushi chef. will never ever go back or recommend this place.
Reasonable price for the engine swap but the guy who's in the front desk don't know how to do customer service. Owner is known to be good for swaps but the front desk guy don't know how to do customer service and pretends to know shit
Horrible service. No one had any idea what was going on. Overpriced. Everything took FOREVER to come out. Will definitely not return.
Went in on Saturday to get a full set of nails. I asked for gel clear polish which I did not get but was charged for. And all the nails on my right hand are lifting off already and its only been two days!
Not nearly as good as chipotle. The vegetables were not fresh, salsa was mediocre. Guacamole was blackened due to age, lousy iced tea . Big disappointment.
meh..
Without hesitation, the food in good! But personally waiting up an hour is not good for me. If there's a way you can improve, that would be perfect! But I still come here when not in a hurry. :)
After my knee replacement surgery they were too aggressive and I have since had to get a manipulation done.
If the name of your place is \"Biscuits\" then I would think that your biscuits would be amazing, these were eh at best.
Buddhist bowl.  Awful, the use canned bamboo shoots and other canned ingredients.  Asked for extra spicy, instead of cooking with peppers, they give a container of hot sauce.  Manchu wok was 10x better
Glad to c another restaurant with some raw food options.  Would be nice if they had some fresh pressed green juices and some raw salad options.
Not sure what all of the fuss is about. Overpriced foods that I can make at home. The only thing I would actually pay for again is the green smoothie. Oh and the jicama fries are terrible.
Place is small the staff is rude. Pool is dirty. Lol and was on a waiting list for an iron that I never got. Place sucks
I have to say some items are overpriced. The bubble tea is nice. The food is ok for me.
Drinks were good but they need to work on their anju!! Serving deep fried pre-frozen costco purchased item is not going to cut it!!!
We got a groupon to try out this place. Service was awful and the staff totally ignored us. Food was alright but over priced. It was a $30 groupon. However, we only received $28 credit on the bill. For the service alone, we will definitely never go back.
Good wings. They always have drink specials.
The skimpiest wings I've ever seen offered under the NNY banner. Don't waste your money or time...   Sorry I took my sons here for their first lesson in Buffalo Wings!
Dishonest Establishment. Waitresses are shady; stripper shady. Always check your bill.
Food was great and the employees were great.  No free beverage refills though.  I was hoping id get a little more pork also.
The service is horrible! Food is good, but they need to be trained and get some management in there that will train the waiting staff what people expect when they dine out.
I've now eaten here 3 times. 2 out of the 3, our order was taken correctly, the kitchen made the wrong order. The last time, they even made the reorder wrong. Food is decent and priced fairly. you won't be blown away by anything
One step above grocery sushi. Nothing about this restaurant makes it stand out. Nothing authentic. Won't last much longer.
Very disappointing. Chicken quesadilla was shredded and loaded with so much queso that it was soggy. Surprised because they have such a good rep but Im going to stick with Cabo Fish Taco.
Unfortunately, as of 09/18/2013 this place is now closed.
dont bother
The gelato just wasn't... gelato.  The taste was fine but the texture was lacking.
Be sure to review your dog sitter before you book with them!!!! Do not trust the reviews!!!!!  This website had great reviews for green acres dog boarding in Gilbert az and they just killed 17 dogs!!!!!!!
Overall, we got a great deal here.  Modern hotel and nice room.
It was one of those times when you walk in, look around, then walk right on back out.
The checkin person was great but besides that this hotel sucked. No ventilation, as the smoke just hit you every time you left the room. Then they nicked every cent they could from you for items that are usually free in most places. Not recommended.
Nothing special. Not nearly as nice as Hard Rock Hollywood/Fort Lauderdale. Good casino to lose at machines. Nobody seemed to be winning. Def not me. It's more like a long hallway than an open casino. Not impressed.
Lasted a month and even with the menu redo it's officially closed... again. This location has so much potential if they could find the right management and remember that its not the strip so resort prices need not apply.
Food was good. The service was disappointing. Your better off going to Gallo where people actually care.
When is SBX going to have a line for those of us wanting COFFEE and not the calorie -ladden fraps that everyone likes to CALL coffee? Express Service NOW!
Nice staff but not worth the money. Pastrami sandwich was a joke. As a whole , the restaurant has potential but I don't think I'll go back any time soon
I am not a beer drinker but went there last night with husband and friend. Hubby and friend liked the beer. Hubby had the James Brown brew. Food not so good. I had the fish and chips. I would not recommend. But service was fantastic!
This place is terrible.  The help is rude.  I have been here three times and walked out the last time after the bartender stood around and talked to his buddies instead of serving my date and I.  I know it is new, maybe it will get better.
It looks cool in the reviews but the over look is very cafeie, the drink are nice but unless its happy hour they are over priced for a mimosas and some wines, the food is worth it not bad considering the area caters to tourist and the \"Ogden\" residents
Horrible!!! Over crowded. Was like a laser tag cavern. Hot, loud and lame. Went to Tao the night before and had a blast. Also heard XS and marque are good too.
Nightclub was nice but charging me 9$$$ for a specially made extra small figi bottle of water is ridiculous. Way to go people just have your customers throw up everywhere instead of handing em cups of water...total turnoff
Overrated, No where to stand and decor was lacking..... My friends and I were truly disappointed. Do yourself a favor, regardless of the talent, hit Light, Marquee, XS, TAO...any place but here
Ok! So the music was great!!! Had fun dancing the whole night, but unless you plan on getting bottle service then you won't be able to see the stage. Drinks are very expensive.
The constant electronic/techno music made me want to shoot myself. There was absolutely no R&B or hip-hop played. The music didn't change all night!
VIP means you have to Stand in line for 2 hours. I should know better, but dont trust a promoter, especially Shawn.
Horrible atmosphere, way too crowded. The security were incredibly rude and pushy. I felt like I was in a mosh pit instead of a club.. If you're in Vegas, there are SEVERAL better places to go, don't waste a night at this place.
Went to try it today at lunch and it wasn't open.  Went to Carly's Bistro instead (fantastic!).  Called the number for Scratch when I got back to the office and it was disconnected.  Guess it's closed?
Clearly a one is generous. A clear statement by Amex regarding the complete ignorance to running a lounge and incompetence of design. Horrible food, uncomfortable furniture, no service. What the current managers do not understand about travel is shockingly clear - everything!
Food wasn't that great. I went there alone. Still they charged me 18% gratuity and about 30% tip. That's 50% in addition to the bill. I ended up paying 30$ for my lunch.
Food was really good, view of market street from second floor was nice, however slow service (10 minutes waiting for the coffee to be made)
I can't begin to explain the horrible treatment  received here.  Office staff and doctors not trained to treat women with a history of sexual abuse, and apparently without a bit of common sense.  I miss Dr. Brandon - she was the only good one here, but has unfortunately retired.
Rude staff , our appointment was at 1:45 it is 3:21 and we are still here this is ridiculous never coming back
Inferior meats used on sandwitches, looked like they buy meats from.the dollar store,used to be a lot better,.cheap, lousy meats, waste of money, go elsewhere!
The food  was great  too bad the service was terrible.  I would go back but would make sure I did not get the same server.  It would have earned them a 4 star.  It was not just that the kitchen was backed up, she was not even friendly or checked on us.
Had a reservation yet had to wait 30 min for our table, then once sat 45 min for drinks, food came out before drinks. Small plates but the menu did not state that was expecting full portion.
Soggy bun, Overcooked patty, Frozen fries, Terrible service.  This was probably the worst lunch I've ever had.  Seriously you can get a better burger at McDonalds.
Not bad at all.  I Had a cheesesteak, daughter had a dog.   The  only negative would be that the meals are entree and fries, drink is separate.  Looking forward to trying breakfast menu as well as other items.
Good place for a quick lunch. Sandwiches, soups, and salads.  Fast service although everything is prepared to order.  Prices are very reasonable.
The place had a lot of potential but they lack the right customer service and the hostesses almost create an uncomfortable atmosphere. Food is good, drinks are good, service is absolutely terrible.
Food is OK after you finally get it. Waited 45 min for breakfast and my girlfriend's food was cold. They said no problem, it will only take a minute to replace....took 10. Friendly but incapable service. 2nd try and last.
Only had the iced coffee and won't get it again. They fill half the cup with water and then put a \"concentrated\" coffee in it. Not good, tastes watered down and bitter. Brewed coffee is on the only way to go for iced coffee.
Great bar atmosphere with Chinese food! Good waitress but needed help with our large group! Food Ok!  Lots of beer selections!
So sorry to report I hade such high expectations and was so disappointed ! Packets of mayonnaise??. Restaurants in Scottsdale do better than that! Food quality did not even compare to anything in Hawaii who are your food vendors?m
The fish taco salad tasted ok but with a fountain drink my bill came to $15.10 and I was still hungry.
nice place with lackluster service and food. Depressed staff and McDonalds quality sushi... good for a quick stop if you want quantity over quality...
Caprese sandwich not what I expected the bun should have been toasted it was just lacking flavor.
Pretty good gyros. Not the best I've ever had but you won't be disappointed. Just a bit pricey. .. Probably because of lack of traffic they have to make up for it.
What's the point of having a Starbucks if it doesn't open till after 8am?!?! Most people are already at work by then..
Super fun venue for DJs and partying. Do not give these guys a credit card tho - Pay cash! Me and some girlfriends got taken to the cleaners by these bums when we rented a table with bottle service.
Had a good chicken sandwich with fries and an overly-oily salad for under $10+tax and tip. Server was really friendly and fun. \n\nDecent lunch, but I don't know that I will be rushing back.
It's consistently pretty good.  It's chain food, and I am a little against big corporate restaurants as they are all pretty vanilla.  That said there is nothing run of the mill about their chambord margarita.
Took over 20mins to just get our drinks. The steak in my burrito came out ice cold then took 20mins to get right.  Never even got my refill on my drink. Never going back
Ate here for lunch today. I had the sushi lunch sampler. Now I am throwing up and my stomach is churning. I would not recommend this place at all.
I tried out this place a week ago, what I can say is that while the place is OK, but the food does not scream quality. I am giving it 3 stars because rarely do I leave bad reviews. If you wanna have sushi this is not the greatest place for you to go.
Shop closes at 7pm and I walk in 25 minutes before closing and they wouldn't take me although they were clearly open and available. Annoying.
No bueno...pricey and the food is meh
This restaurant NEVER answered their telephone. Their info said they opened at 1130 and even up until 12 noon no one answered the telephone. All u wanted to do was make a reservation!
Poor service, lack of cleanliness, and unbelievably bad food.. A one star is too high of a rating! No second chance deserved here - no way we will be back.
Came here to check out the BBQ. It was just okay. Service was good. But just not special enough to come back to. I think this place is more for their drinks.
We stopped at Moe's today for lunch.  My wife had the pulled pork sandwich with sides of sweet potato casserole and Cole slaw and I had a shrimp sandwich with sides of mac 'n cheese and black eyed pea salad.  Our meals were both good.  Service was very good.
Had to drop my rating a couple of stars because they never offer the trout for the 3 course lunch special anymore.  The trout is what really made the lunch special great.
I just had dinner at Diya with my boyfriend. The food was good but it was pricey. It has small portions and is definitely fine dining. If you are looking for an inexpensive night of Indian food with large portions, this is not the place.
Well, if your address isn't correct and you don't pick up the phone to help with directions you can't expect a great customer response...  Was really looking forward to eating here, now not so sure.
These were the worst tacos I've ever had! No flavor at all..  I don't recommend this to any one! Service was  a 3 at best also.
Where's the beef? Very little beef on the sandwich.  Got the Philly with Am. Cheese sandwich. The cheese was over-melted, you could not tell if it had cheese on it. No peppers and very little onions on this sandwich.
I thought if I go inside and order in person it would prevent mistakes. I was wrong they ordered 3 extra things that I never said I wanted that were expensive. I didn't think The total sounded right but wasn't sure until I got home. Unreal!
I have eaten here a few times how ever tonight was not the best. I ordered a bean burrito and the beans tasted spoiled sour.
Open till 11 pm? came at 9:30 they couldn't do my acrylic fill because two people were in front of me?! 'We don't have any openings, sorry' Are you kidding?
food selection same as all the thai resturant in charlotte.i ordered yum tum soup..to greasy all i had in my soup is mushroom.nice place for friendly family dinner!they also have sushi!!
Love the food. Love the location. \nDining area and washrooms - filthy. \nStaff- ho hum. \nFloors were so sticky, my shoes still stick to the ground. \nSad.
I'm torn because they have such a great bar, but the service is terrible.  How do you not notice customers walking in when your standing right there chatting with friends?  15 minutes before service is why probably why your not earning many tips, just an fyi.
The happy hour deals at the bar were the best way to go.  Overall neat place but there are plenty of neat places in vegas.
Unprofessional. Really nice interior design though!
Brunch was garage save your time and  money and go to a real breakfast place.  2 hours for the wrong order of eggs and bacon.
Save your money.  I grew up with Michael Jackson's music and this show was awful! It was so boring and kiddish we walked out after 20 min's!  And, the seats where not high enough to look over the person in front of you.
not as good as expected..... I guess I like Cora more.....\nThe Montreal putine was too salty to have a bite. :(
Good food good prices! It just too small. It's almost like I dread going in because I know I'm going to have a hard time finding a seat and waiting for people to get up.
Burger was good. Sweet potatoes fries were burned and cold. Cookies were also cold despite website saying they would be warm. Service was courteous and okay for the most part. Food could be improved.
Need to update their menu.
Pretty good... Not as good as \"Wahoos\" in California. Very friendly staff, fresh food. Awesome clam strips.
I didn't wanna write a review but since 2 days late ,still feeling bad from the clam pizza....I'd have to say this place is no good.
Great selection and friendly bartender but lighting and crowd draw leave something to be desired.
Blendinis are u kidding me!!!! It's 4.99 for small cup that's only half full!!!! ridiculous!!!!
Staff was nice, burgers and fries fair, hole in the wall with lots of flies.
Wasn't impressed. Poorly seasoned steak and slow service. All of the food was just ok. So many better options out there. Quite disappointed.
Ordered a chicken burrito here on Friday, June 28th.  Onset of FOOD POISONING was swift and severe.  Spent Saturday pretty much bed-ridden.
This place is on par with every other sandwich chain like it. I still prefer Wildflower Bread Co, but this is a good place to see the real housewives of Gilbert during the week.
I like this place,  but the bathrooms are disgusting. There is never toilet paper, they were out of soap last time and  they had no paper towels to dry hands. Other than that, the little cafe is pretty decent and the drinks are cheap.  Good times can be had.
I love the vibes and games available here but the drinks are horrible and overpriced.
Ohai.  Tacos are good but expensive and so are the fresca.  Try to make it to happy hour(no food just drinks) Use coupons when able. Kthxbai
Service is great, drinks are good, food is only ok. Stuffed peppers and dates are the best thing there. However, the entire restaurant smells like an old dish rag. It makes me wonder how clean things are...
Very slow service.  Purchased lunch special that included beer.  They refused to give us beer and stated that they were cleaning their beer lines.  Poor planning, they should perform maintenance during closed hours, not during lunch time.  I would not return there.
Extremely disorganized and unprofessional place!  If you have time to waste this is your place.
Nasty.   Bad food.  Rude,  indifferent staff.  1 star is being generous.
Very nice bar and the prices are very reasonable, if they put 2 (diamond) tables in there instead of 1 bar table and 1 build at home type pool table it would make this bar a very awesome place to hang out at and take pool league teams all week 24/7.
The atmosphere was great. The food and service was not so great. We had a really depressed waitress and food took for ever to come out. We also noticed the food to be bland and dry. I would not recommend this place to anyone looking for authentic Mexican food.
Its a bit pricey but the dumplings and service are good.
Rien de mauvais, mais avec tous les restaurants indiens de qualit\u00e9 que Montr\u00e9al a \u00e0 offrir, on peut faire beaucoup mieux!
Atmosphere was well done,  good service but for a $20 medium pie there was no real wow factor,  good but $20 good.
Meh! A bit overpriced the help is kind of snooty. The food is only ok I probably won't go back
I got the French dip with slaw. The order was to go but it took a while to get out. The meat was pretty bland and I didn't get the correct side, potato salad instead of slaw. I was expecting more.
Over priced, the hot dog meat tasted on the tainted side. Half way through the bun got tough to eat. I was going to get a soda but I could have gotten a six pack for the same price.  Will eat some where else next time.
Drove by the other day, and it has a new name and a sign looking for employees. Looks like it's no longer Dragon :(
I hated the fact the texture of the gelato was so sticky and thick. I felt naucious and got a stomach ache from it. I feel like they put way too much sugar in their icecream creating such inconsistent texture. I'm going to baskin Robbins next time.
The weekend crew is good. Tuesday around 7pm not so snappy. Sticking to the weekend program.
Decent spot. I like the food and the people. I want to make this review long enough so it doesn't add it as a tip
All I can say is it's ether a HIT or a MISS ! Ngek. Some days you'll get the best of both worlds good chow and good service and some days will just be \" what Happened?\" Sigh :(
The sandwiches taste fine but the servings are small and the menu is really lacking variety.
1.5 hours later and we are still waiting for food! What a bummer! \nThe last time we came it was great!\n:(
I wanted to like this place, but the service is not that good. Even if the food at a restaurant is good and the service is terrible, I won't go back.
Fun pool atmosphere! Good music & wonderful staff. The property in general needs to be unkept better though!
Not impressed! The food all looks old would rather spend a couple extra dollars for fresh stuff!
They ignored our attempts to order and would not acknowledge us at the window when we tried to see if anyone was even there. So rude and the food is cold.
The decor here is really nice and no music blasting which was great for breakfast. Well that's about as good as it got. I had the 2 eggs and NY steak for $23 and that was a big mistake. The steak was too chewy but I should have expected that.
If you want great tasty boba, head next door to Super L Ranch Market.  If you want fresh daily baked breads, again, head next door to Super L.  All products are made fresh daily, no shipment come in weekdays.  All are freshly made for your enjoyment.
Do not go here, they charge too much for what you get and rip you off with the ion foot detox, which is a total hoax, these guys should be put out of business.
This place is so outdated... the rooms are for those who just want to have a place to crash... maybe with a group of friends on a whim trip! The location is nice for going places on the strip but this hotel is in need of major repair!
On good days their great on bad days, yuck. Wish they can be consistent!
Disgusting Food !!!  Slow service !!! Waste of money.. I'm not coming back. All three dishes were bad, we left it almost untouched except French fries which was ok
Good, fast, but not cheap. I thought the idea was fun, food was really tasty. The cheese bar was \"ehh\".
Nothing special here. Average tacos and below average service. If you are drunk and hungry this place might suite you.
Ordered once and never again. Pizza was terrible! No flavor and it was burnt and cold when it arrived.
way too expensive and their service is horrible it took me an hour and a half to get a cheese burger,never again
Not even worth
Not being open during posted hours when you have multiple customers outside in the heat waiting for your uhaul service is totally unacceptable.
Cheap but not great food. I like the all you can drink beer though. The waitress was a weirdo.
Can't really comment because I came on normal business hours and at normal time at 4pm and they were closed no sign no nothing . Kinda disappointing.
While I have had good service at other locations, the service that my family had tonight was horrible. It took them 25 minutes before they brought out our salads and over an hour before they brought our pizza. We saw some tables turn over twice before we got our food.
excellent but expensive pizza.  impersonal cavernous sports bar atmosphere.  bar service was lazy.
I have been to NY and had pizza and I am sorry to say this was nowhere near what you would get in NY. We ordered the NY style pizza and it just okay. The place is nice and the service was good, but I do not see myself going there ever again.
We visited this Sunday afternoon. There were three other pairs there and one person on the internet. The lattes were good. There were still a few pastries, but very little bread available. We wanted a sourdough, but no luck.
Horrible experience and will NOT return. Totally disorganized. Most of the empty tables were unbussed. Three lines merged into one and orders were not taken correctly. Workers were standing around with dazed looks and unwilling to help - they simply pointed to a different person when asked for assistance.
The ice cream here is definitely tasted, but I think the ice cream is too melted. It has already melt down to my hand even before I went out of the front yard. I prefer something with more solid texture, but if you like soft ice cream, this is definite the place to go.
The food is terrible, the drinks are good and cheap yet I'm a chef and it's sad to see the shit they put out here
Love the tvs at almost every table. Wasn't impressed with there food. The Ruben was alittle dry but all and all not a terrible place.
Employees are unhelpful and very rude. Took me 2 minutes in this location to realize that I need to stay with Verizon. I would\nNot reccomend this location to anyone!!!!!!
Hail ceasar was relatively boring.. Dressing was bland. Baby kale salad was really good. Turkey burger was okay... Don't get the gluten free bread! Drinks were good.
The only place you can drink beer is inside this little pen, like I'm a damn bull. The beer choices they have are terrible, only two. The beer they do have tastes terrible. Cash only for the beer. Cash only for the parking. Terrible cellular signal. What a dump.
Spicy Chicken Sandwich Deluxe, well for fast food it is better than Wendy's Spicy Chicken Sandwich taking over the fast food crown\n\nYou could do a lot worse fast food wise
It is pretty neat to make your pizza or salad to order. Most of the toppings are good but, the meat selections are not so great and the place is a little pricey.  The pizza is good but the salad was just okay I kinda miss Neapolitan.
The food was over 20 minutes late, cold and subpar. They get 2 stars for being cheap. Will not order again with so many other places to choose from. Plenty of mixed reviews so this place must be hit or miss. It was a miss for me.
Paid $18 (including tax and tip) for the worst beef teriyaki (lunch special) on the planet. The miso soup was basically just salt water.
Food is great but service is terrible. This is one of my favorite restaurants, but this location doesn't make the grade. Waited 15 minutes in an empty restaurant at 1:30 for a bean burrito to go. Seriously...
This hurt; but 3 stars is being generous.  Don't get me wrong, their food is great, but I spent 45 minutes waiting for my to-go lunch today; and when I walked in the door there were only 3 other people seated.
The salad dressing was good, greens a little bitter but in was okay with that.  The curry is a good japanese style curry.  If you are looking for an exact replica of CoCo Ichibanya, you should keep looking.
Lol I got like five pieces of meat blocks and a ton of rice and curry.  \nCould be better.
All Chilli and no dog... Not like the ones in LA at all!
I give this Tommy's 3 stars only because it was clean and the employees are nice. We didn't care for the food at all. Maybe when back when we were kids or teens this food would have been better.
Good pizza, cool music, friendly service in a cozy atmosphere with reasonable prices and with awesome patrons. The menu was full of variety I would recommend for family and friends or that special someone for a fun night out!!!
Tried this place a couple of times too many. It's just not that great. Pizza, salads, garlic knots... none of it stands out. Wouldn't try it again even for free. Much better places out there.
Very disappointed with the open faced roast beef. No seasoning whatsoever! Service was good and the coleslaw was tasty but won't be returning.
The restaurant no longer exists.
Ordered twice here and everything was not authentic and tooooooo salty.\nAvoid the place even you have nothing to eat at midnight.
This place is really gross. The boba tastes too chalky and it's definitely not wort more than $5. Over priced. Save yourself the woe and just drive to Chinatown.
No wifi!!! Are you kidding me, ur a cafe for god sakes!!! Won't be going back until wifi is added.
Disappointed I stop this morning to try them out, but they were closed even though the door said open at 7AM at 7:20 they were not.... Off to Jamba Juice I go...
Wonton soup is terrible. I don't know what I expected for mall food but yuck. Broth tasted gamey and the wontons themself just looked bad. Couldn't even bring myself to try one.
I think this place has closed. Couldn't find it and ended up at Cheeba Hut. I think it was in the same strip mall?? Cheeba Hut was great though!
My son walked into this barber shop, no one bothered to greet or acknowledge him. They looked at him after already being in there for five minutes and told him to sign in. Not welcoming, terrible customer service.
Overpriced for okay food.  I don't get it.  Slow service--not the food, but placing your order takes forever.  Also, don't be fooled by the two sizes--you'll want the bigger one for a normal meal.
if you need hearing aids in any kind of reasonable time frame avoid like the plague. I am still trying to clean up the mess they made of my insurance.
It's ok. If it's late and you want a place to eat, it's a good place to find some ok food.
Simply just not impressed. I've had better Chinese food buffets for less. The only reason I went out of my way to the city of Henderson was because of a groupon I received.  I will say, however,  that the place was very clean and the service was good.
Terrible food and service. The kitchen is SLOW. The food is luke warm at best. The only thing good is the Cider.
NOT an outlet. Found the exact same products and prices at my regular Disney store last week. Save your time and shop online.
Customer service sucks. They say one thing & do another. If your looking for a good gun shop in henderson, go to spurlocks. \nNever again will they have my business nor the rest of my families that went there.
As a spectator this race I wanted to get me family on video attempting these obstacles. With the amount of real estate soooo close to stands, the obstacles could have been laid out better too allow family to enjoy the race too. Very disappointed.
Pizza sauce had no seasoning in it, very sweet. Cooked pizza was very chewy, not good. I will not be back.
Ribs are good. But this place is waaaaaay overpriced. Go to Rolling Smoke it's better and cheaper
they no longer deliver...in room dining only.  Not going to patronize until they deliver again.  Just ridiculous they don't deliver.  What are they trying to do?
A coffee joint down the street recommended  this place. And since I love the coffee joint, I thought that this must be good. WRONG! We were right by the door, cashiers area & had the worst service! The food was blah!! I will NOT return.
The worse Denny's I've been to very rude employees very filthy  never eat there again
They're menu is constantly changing, and they're adding more items -- which is great! When they first opened there wasn't many choices.  Great place for Japanese curry, but I wish they had unlimited Japanese pickled items. Their Katsu curry is awesome!!!
The food was delicious like always, but the service was terrible by chubby waitress who wears glasses. Everything else was great.
Ordered Steak and Blue salad--definitely not impressed and don't recommend.  Tasteless with ground up steak bits, barely recognizable as meat.
Surprisingly good.  The charburger was tasty, their fries are above average and the price is very fair.
Nice place but was not terribly impressed.  Our waiter recommended the short ribs which were pretty good although would not put that as the first impression piece.
Some of the worst food I've been served in recent memory.  The burrito I had was greasy and completely tasteless.  I couldn't eat it.\n\nI'll never go back.  I only wish I could give this place zero stars.
The beer was ok, nothing special! I think it has a good atmosphere. But really only seemed to focus on sweeter beers. \n\nGranted they were out of the blonde and anything else lighter. We will try them again another time and re-judge!
Coffee good as usual but incredibly long lines and slow service.  Almost seemed like there was something wring with their POS system.  Staff seemed frustrated too and weren't too friendly.  Plenty of other Starbucks nearby, avoid this one.
Arguing with a fool only proves there are two!!!... a crazy lady will self destruct...trying to control everyone. And everything however just another duck....
Maybe I am growing out of my kid phase, but I thought the hot dog on a stick was gross and soggy! But I will say the lemonade is delicious! Drive thru was fast and they were nice. So-so. Nothing to brag about.
Seriously I have two jimmy johns the same distance from me and neither will deliver. To me that's just a pathetic excuse to be lazy.
Although the representatives are relatively friendly, the company is very unprofessional, charges higher than standard storage rates, refuses to state formal policies and procedures, and behaves more like a seedy pawn shop than a legitimate business.
The boba here is decent, depends on what you get. The food is horrible. Don't bother with the food menu.
I'm not crazy about the food here, but there's a great (huge!) patio and I would go for a cocktail or glass of wine anytime :)
I would have thought they would have better service considering the overabundance of staff. Kind of an \"iffy\" location. Not easy in & out access. Parking behind store only.
I'm not usually one to leave negative reviews and usually give the benefit of the doubt when I have one bad experience, but our family came here and finally left after waiting forever and never getting served. Too bad, because I LOVE places like this and have heard great things.
Started getting a stomach ache before I got halfway into my burrito. And the taste wasn't worth it. And the salsa wasn't spicy. And the place was freezing. Don't recommend at all.
It is 4am and I am writing this review as I stand outside the Constellation, because the fire alarm has been going off for 45 plus minutes. This has happened multiple times in the past year.
After reading the reviews I will NOT give this place a try! HAIR in food! That's the worst. It ruins the whole experience.
This drive thru line is beyond insanely slow. If I could get out of line I would. I'm held hostage. I've listened to 4 songs in my CD already and I'm only third in line. Not worth the time wasted.
I went on Sunday at 2.  The sign says their open, yet the doors were locked. Dissapointing!
3+ stars, fast service, decent pizza but prefer a hand tossed dough. Not my cup of tea pizza wise but for those that like a crispy pizza, it's right up your alley with customization up to 7 ingredients. Decently priced meal with drink less than $11.00.
Super super slow. Expect a 15 minute wait in the drive through and about 50% if the time the food is cold or old.
I've given this location a try twice. They screwed up both orders, once giving us a happy meal with an empty box where the nuggets should have been.\n\nSkip it.
Decent food but chicken has no flavor! Drink prices are good and especially during happy hour or a nfl or college game!
Poor service, over-priced and mediocre food at best. They were not accommodating to special requests such as a different pasta sauce or adding cracked red pepper to a dish. People come here for the name but leave thinking Buddy V should stick to cake instead of restaurants.
Super slow hostess with empty tables. Probably not a good idea for lunch. Or parties more than 4.
Food is good. Service is not so good. If you're already in the area its a good option, but I wouldn't go out of my way.
Unfriendly and unhelpful service. Our shrimp was undercooked and noodle dish had no flavor.Will not be returning.
Not bad. Not awesome. They had a great drink selection and some cool cocktails. Food was decent, the bacon wrapped wings were okay but really didn't need the bacon since they were swimming in bbq sauce anyway. I enjoyed the signature burger, however. Nice ambiance.
Awful, service is awful\nfood not cooked all the way through\nwill not recommend it at all.\n\nTHIS IS NOT FOR KIDS AT ALL OR BABIES.
We came here for restaurant week and while nothing was bad, nothing was good enough to mandate a return visit.  Oh well, there are plenty of other seafood restaurants in the sea...
Super friendly and attentive staff, the turkey in the sub I purchased was fine, but the rest of the ingredients were low-quality bland central and very little selection. \n\nWouldn't go back, sorry.
If you want to be ignored, listen to your bartenders complain about their lives, enjoy a marginal selection of draft beers, and have that true crap Southside experience, this is the place to be.
Nice atmosphere. the breakfast is good. The staff seems friendly enough.  The macaroons are disappointing.although tasty, they are a little soggier than I would prefer. The Union at Biltmore has far better macaroons than these and 2-3 times the variety.
They charged me $150 for $60 worth of transmission fluid, they must not realize how easy it is to look up the parts in their invoices. I can understand a business marking up parts, but almost 3x markup is just greedy
Mike their \"broker\" has no personality and is rude on the phone. He is impolite to his costumer and will drop the phone on you, avoid dealing with people like him and move on to the next business that cares about costumer service.
Went in around lunch time and the place is tiny, had to wait about 10 minutes just to sit down somewhere... The food was excellent, just felt rushed and crammed into a small location.\n\nOh and they have free ice cream, which is delicious.
Had the breakfast wrap. It had so much oil in it. I mean tons of oil dripping everywhere. I always thought of pei Wei as the healthier option, not anymore.
I ate here on last weekend and thought the burgers were really good. Although... A friend and myself became deathly ill that night. If you ever had food poisoning it is not fun. I know for a fact it was from there.
Horrible bland food. Horrible service, but a sweet girl. TVs were waaaay too loud -only 30 people in the huge place, the loud volume was not necessary. Table was dirty. We'll never go back.
Had the sausage skillet was good but the toast came later and was butterd on one side
It was ok.  I was hoping for better service and few more choices on the menu.
Stopped for breakfast while waiting for my connection in PHX. Food quality was really poor. Wilted fruit, soggy home fried and an undercooked egg. Would not recommend to a friend.
Customer service was poor. And the smoothie I got was so awful I had a horrible taste in my mouth for the longest time.
It was horrible to park.  There were way to many people.  The lines to everything were long.  Bring cash most vendors don't take credit cards.  $10 per person to get in and we left after 20 minutes due to too many people.
Great chicken fingers. Bland and boring coleslaw. Regular old krinkle cut fries. Come for the chicken fingers and cane sauce, skip the rest.
Not at all what was expected. The website leads you to believe bit is a gourmet bakery and breakfast place, when in reality it is a run of the mill mediocre sandwich shop.
To begin with, The Sugar Factory at Town Square has a great staff and an amazing experience. The only minus is that the food comes from a very select menu and is not all that great. Also, it doesn't even compare to The Sugar Factory on the Strip!
It's all about the staff, second disappointment and we didn't even eat there. I thought this one would be different but I was wrong. No more sugar factory for me.
Horrible service, hot chocolate was delivered 10 minutes after the rest of our order, and tasted terrible. Avoid this place.
This is ridiculous, the place is empty and I can't get a table to eat desert, I need to order at least appetizers.\nI was honest to say I want I have a desert, hosted was unbelievable rude.
Not a good place to go. Worst service. Waiting times. After waiting  one hour and forty five minutes food arrives but no more drinks.  to bad this is a new location not planing to go back any time soon ...
Just ok nothing special. Live around the corner probably won't be back it ain't my thang.
Nice atmosphere, semi interesting menu.  However, $7+ for a burger when I can get a better one at elsewhere with bacon for less, left me feeling unsatisfied.
Food is absolutely not up to par for Montreal. Service is horrible. Been waiting 25 min already for our bill! Skip this place
Food was enjoyable and there was plenty. I just hate when restaurants cheapen the quality of the meat. The steak used to be actual steak but is now a cheap philly steak type of thing and charging for the sauce that used to be put on the food is a bit much as well.
It was okay, very clean, nice atmosphere but the food itself was a little disappointing.
63.25for two pizzas and salad pretty freAking krazy?
I was not impressed. Food quality was low and tasted cheap. I have no idea why ppl rave about it. I won't go back. Liberty is across the parking lot and a thousand times better plus they use local food.
Not a big casino like others on the strip. What I liked about this place was that it wasn't crowded. Next time I would like to hit up the stores during business hours.
Questionable
Small rooms w/ small beds, walls are extremely thin, no wonder it's cheap, you really get what you pay for, will never stay here again.
Food wasn't that good. gyro had meat that was flat and lacked flavor.  seemed over priced too.
Fresh ingredients but my gyro was slathered in tzatziki sauce and devoid of any real flavor.  The falafel was kind of the same.  I'm not a big fan of the dumb down the spices for the American folk cuisine.
Not impressed at all , the food didn't have much taste to it and it's overpriced for the portion you get .
Really good tacos but overpriced for what it is.
blech.  this isn't pizza.  the steak hoagie tasted decent, but that's not steak either... then again this wouldn't be worst decision you could make at 1AM
This year all the markets were labeled \"Edinburgh's Christmas\" but some of the old faves were still at the old school end. Not as many pretty handcrafted things, but lots of options for nibbles and plenty of entertainment.
Excellent presentation.\nNice decor (unchanged from painted pony)\nCalamari appetizer so so.\nGood service.
This spot just doesn't do it for me.  Flavors fall short.  Vegetables are over cooked and soggy.  \n\nThe service is fine. The location is nice. Overall the food was mediocre.
Food was OK, service was bad,  and atmosphere was good. Server never checked on us, and we waited for awhile to order. Longer than it should take. Probably won't come back again.
Burger was good, fried oysters weren't as good. Overall good lunch.
Average at best and I might be being generous. The food was OK. Service was average.  Not what I expected.
Horrible! Please don't waste your time or money. I got a pedi and gel layover with gel polish and two days later the gel start peeling. Two thumbs down! They should change the name to \"Nails you Hate\"
Hit and miss. Some dishes were amazing. Others were average. I would go back tho. Great service.
Drove all the way here and they are closed for maintenance until end of May. I just wish that businesses that are on yelp would make us aware of these types of things, bc now I have a bad taste in my mouth...
Food is good service sucks. Super slow! Not good for people who work here and have times breaks. I wish they would pick up speed. 15 mins for French fries is out of control. Get it together!!!! So I can enjoy your food.
Green Acres killed my 3 dogs and 19 others last week. I hope they have shut down. Yelp please don't delete this truthful post as you have all the others. You could be saving a dogs life by keeping this up !
Good beer selection, food was just ok and wait staff was rather unfriendly. Probably won't be going back.
Mellow mushroom is terrible.  I have never written a review before but this place is a grotesquely racist establishment and i never want to return to it ever again.  I would give it negative 100 stars if i could.
Good place and has a nice potential of becoming a mix for both, tourists and locals but the coffee shop doesn't have heavy cream. I am on the mission to find at least a couple of coffee shops in downtown that could make a cappuccino with heavy cream.
Horrible company that lies to employees and withholds pay without any communication or reason. The people who are suppose to support you jump to conclusions. \n\n\nDon't work here unless u want to make 60% of what you earn.
Management at this location needs some work. I have been to this location multiple times now as I love Chipotle, but this location is not run well.
I have no idea what is going on here.  Go somewhere else for you veggie/vegan needs.  This place seemed promising, too.
Saw roaches on the floor. Waitresses were hella rude. Complained to the manager and she spit in our faces and cursed us out. The chef looks like a fat sweaty slob. Just a horrible experience. Customer service is foreign to them.
Ummm just ok by food and setup but service was fabulous and there was no waite and yes the karaoke was fun to watch ... Not sure if I'll be back but I won't say never
The food is great the service sucks never met ruder people in my life, and they over charged paid $30.00 a salad and didn't want to deal with it!
An animal rescue group I support held a fundraiser here in Feb 2014, and the owners promised to donate a portion of what was raised back to the rescue. Instead they kept all of the money. Very shady and we will not return!
The combos aren't combos and the guy behind the counter looks like he's gonna cry.  D,:
Great music, but bartenders seems to be bothered or you feel unwelcome, no smile :( just drink!
The staff could have been friendlier.  We were greeted by \"What do you want?\"  The food was O.K.  We ate there and everything was in Styrofoam.   I was expecting some plates.  The price wasn't bad. I will give it another try.
It was just OK. Ive definitely had better Indian food before (not in Vegas but back home in the UK).\n\nLets just say, I wont be ordering from here again lol. I ordered a Lamb curry/biriyani
Delicious chicken teriyaki bowl with veggies! Sometimes I indulge in their crab rangoons, too...tasty little morsels!
We ordered Mic Ultra, nice and cold! But the tri tip nachos were blah, no favor. I was disappointed, but I'll probably come again due to the quick service and beer on tap.
Good stuff, poorly priced. If I wanted to pay as much as they have it listed as, I would buy new.
Just ok, we order the Cesar salad witch was soaked in dressing and had no croutons at all. Then I had the shrimp fajita ( no salsa, no Guac and no sour cream :/ whaawhaa I did love the decor tho!
If a neighborhood Chicago bar had gambling, this would be it. The low-limit tables are the only asset I can see. Go for the people watching and to practice without losing a fortune.
So much for Sunday Funday the waitresses are more interested in the guys then taking care of you
Probably the most pathetic place I have ever been. Bouncers think that being a bouncer is really important. Getting inside is like accomplishing absolutely nothing. Nothing to see. Nothing to do. Guys with big egos and small ....  Go somewhere else.
Incompetent and rude staff in the office. They do not even acknowledge maintenance requests within a reasonable amount of time, let alone perform the repairs. People are breaking rules e.g. parking, noise, satellite dishes, chairs and garbage out on the landing, which makes it unpleasant.
Got a tepid cup of coffee at 7:00 am that tastes like it was brewed with tea mixed in with it.  It doesn't appear these people can even do coffee correctly.
Too expensive! Casino owned (Harrahs). Double the price of a regular corporate owned Starbucks.
I love the bread pudding and the soup.  But the prices are high, not open on Sunday, and I was not impressed with the breakfast.
Just heard this place closed as of 7/31/2014. Why am I not surprised? Such a disappointment.  Guess I won't get the chance to give it another chance. Can we have Blue Burrito back now, please?
They get one star for cleanliness and decor. Aside from that, the service was horrible and they were out of half of the items on the menu.
The lettuce was brown and the owner tried to convince me it was fresh. That was after I came back to tell him that I got sick from eating there. Never going back. We
Atmosphere is great! Food is not. Had the pasta w meatballs which consisted of a bowl of gummy flavorless pasta w 2 small meatballs for $15.00. I left hungry and went home and ate a PB&J sandwich.
The service was terrible. I could hear the servers in their service station all huddled together cussing loud enough for me to hear. Not very classy. Needless to say the food was good, but you can get great meals anywhere in this city. Service is what sets it apart. Not a fan
Great location to ride your bike to and enjoy  Sunday.  Unfortunately, the positive experience stops there.  Overwhelmed with the drinking crowd, the service was minimal, glasses were dirty and the food is not worth the effort.
Hey, I loved the breakfast bowl I got here. I think all the breakfast bowls here are really good. Other than that though, the service is just extremely slow.
So not feeling it. The drinks were watered down .. The food came out cold and one of my tacos fell on the table the waitress didn't even offer to replace it. So not worth it. Never coming again.
This is not a restaurant that I will ever come back to. The food was poorly made, not a representation of the images on the menu. I spent the early portion of my morning and day attending to a very upset stomach after a few bites!
I want to like this place because it is near the house but the incredibly poor service makes that impossible.   With so many people out of work you would think they would be able to hire someone mildly competent.
Food was good but it all came out 5-10min apart. Actually had to have one dish wrapped up because it never came out. The rice was good and so was the hummus. Will go back but gonna wait a while to see if they get it together
Rude welcoming by owner. Store was completely empty and owner yells from back of salon \"what do u need\". Walked out before giving a dime to a business that doesn't understand service
Convenient, efficient, and one spot above \"fast food\" but a gimmicky upgrade only and def overpriced.....welcome to Vegas!
I wish I could do zero stars! I scheduled an appointment (and received a confirmation) only to wait two hours with no show and also no call back! I was extremely disappointed and wish I had read the reviews ahead of time.
The burgers are perfectly season that you don't need the condiments. Which is very rare to find. They just need to work on service.
Rio has ruined a great breakfast. Food is not the same as the original. Food was cold service is poor. Go to the free standing spot not in a casino.
I had a huge burger and it was ok. I would have liked a little less quantity and more quality. Not a place I would return to. I ate about 1/3 my meal and was disappointed. The tractor is cool.
Great locations, forget the rest! It's old! I will not stay there again
Horrible. Dirty. Unfriendly valet and front desk people. Go anywhere else. Waste of money.
the worst!!!! room was incredibly dirty. left over trash from previous guests. blood stained boot prints on the couch! a t-shirt and an ear ring left in the bed. on top of all of this it was the worst costumer service ever! pictures will be posted.
The worst customer service experience. Unfortunately for them, my expectations for customer service are a bit higher seeing that this is a higher end Vegas spot...but damn. Just really upsetting.
Stay away! The food from the buffet is not worth ten dollars...I wouldn't eat it if it was free.As I write this I have a stomach ache after one medium size plate of food.
Just had the worst experience at this place the staff is rude there was 20 open tables 4 party sitting horrible service do not go...
Very slow...and there's not very many people.   Didn't bring food for two people.   When we asked why they said the cooked accidentally closed our order.   No real apologies.  Food ok but not worth the lack of service.
I loved the environment, and the staff was incredible.  \n\nthe food wasn't amazing.. just .. good.\nand the cost didn't justify what was on my plate.
Boring, small and nothing to say about it.... slow service.... no atmosphere.... food wasn't anything specials... not worth going out of your way for!
Every single bartender is a rookie. Not one of them knows the basic ingredients in any common drink! They didn't hire these chicks for their brains or abilities!
Went there for lunch yesterday, food was ok, service was lacking, server forgot our soup and fries, had to ask for them, never refilled my tea. Will not be going back.
Slow slow slow slow slow! No point in using the drive thru because you would have taken the same time parking and going inside. If you must go, great brownies and turkey sandwiches too!
Traveling from San Francisco saw the store ate breakfast next door and then went to go to the uniform store and they were closed even though the sign said they open at 8am\nWe waited until 815 still no sign of anyone \nVery disappointing
Not a fan\nVery slow service and what little attention we did get from the server was not good.\nfood was marginal at best, pizza was bland and the crust was doughy.
this was the worst experience I've ever had at a place that calls themselves a bar!! we went in and tried to to order shots and they told us shots or drinks not both . and the food we ordered tasted like salt and grease!!!
Horrible crooks !!! These people are con artists and are now impersonating another moving company with good reviews to get clients ! Please file a complaint online with the attorney general if they have scammed you and damaged your items.
Running out of Gyros on a thursday night ?? really ?? extremely disappointing. we came for their main dish and they ran out of it.
Loved the drinks but the service was horrible. We ordered an appetizer that never came (and was later put on the bill). I would rather just sit at the bar than deal with the server's attitude.
Was super excited to enjoy shaved snow in my neighborhood but that excitement quickly diminished after one taste.  Overly priced and not worth the cost.  I'll continue to drive to China Town for some yummy shaved snow.
Service was good... The food taste terrible, feels like the boiling pot in LA, but taste totally different. I ordered the spicy pot, the super spicy one, it's not spicy at all...disoppionted
My boyfriend reeeeally enjoyed the fried chicken wings...other than that, this place was alright.
Prices are fair but 45 minutes to wash and vac my car? That's a little much. Undecided if I'll be a returning customer.
Not that good, over-priced, bad service, tables were dirty.
Small and not enough room. Avoid this place if you're bringing a whole team. Last resort.
Fuckture prune is the donuts on earth man! Fuckture prune is the donuts on earth man! Fuckture prune is the donuts on earth man! Fuckture prune is the donuts on earth man!
Friendly service but food quite ordinary.  Did not enjoy the food except sou p which was okay
Great choice of toppings but bland beef. Loved the spicy relish and wasabi mayo on the Hawaiian burger.
Made 2 appts n waited all afternoon for them then got txts saying they cant make, not wasting anymore time on this unreliable service
I   was given the bate and switch routine that sleazy car dealers are known for  and I would never recommend CardinaleWay Mazda Peoria Az to anyone
Avoid Dr. Troung. I had a horrible experience here.
The Cake Boss should be ashamed of his store. The service was horrible and we never had any cake. We waited 45 mins.
I was expecting it to be better. I got a brownie and a cream puff and both were average. I've had better at a supermarket. I love cake boss so I was hoping this would be good. I'll just stick to the cupcakery for my baked goods.
Just made it back in to give it another shot. I just had to make it on here to say that I had a very nice Jimmy Johns experience. The sandwich had some meat on it. The service was great and served up very fast!
The sandwich filling options are good, but the bread is dry, crumbly, and tastes mass produced. With options like milio's and Jimmy john's so close by with much better bread, it's hard to justify paying so much for a sandwich here.
It's purely a Novelty.  It's decent coffee and the service is great.  I could see it becoming a phenomenon, though, if they expanded the coffee menu as well as start serving some pastries.
If you're looking for pizza, this is not the spot. Too expensive for the ass tasting food. No nutrition and very not macro friendly. This place is shit.
Go somewhere else.  The food is very over priced and tastes terrible. The presentation/plating is well done but otherwise is a complete miss.
Unreasonably overpriced. $22 for a ramen and barely got 3 spoonfuls of noodles. You can give this place a pass and not miss out on anything. Not to mention it did not taste good at all. No one in my party liked what they got.
Horrible drive thru and slowest service. I have tried to give them chances but it never gets better. Last week was the final straw. I was behind one car and no one was inside and it took forever.
Two burritos, 3 hours later 2 sick people
Food was good at best, they serve alcohol but there's no scene, no outside seating, and uncomfortable seating.
beet salad was fantastic. service was new and they spilled water over my table while I was eating. the short rib loco moco was too salty for my taste.
Over priced for portion size. Good luck actually tasting the guacamole in their food.  Also look out for cold food, half way through my carne asada burro was cold. I will say that they did replace it.  Otherwise the taste of the food is great.
Drive through is soooo slow.  Had to repeat order 3 times and been in line for nearly 10 minutes now.  Just brutal!
Closed. Sign on door said they are locked out.
Have had the philly twice now.  It is pretty good. Not the best in town but up there.  Nice atmosphere with lots of screens for sports.  Get the onion rings, they are very good.
Did I call it or what?! It was only a matter of time before this place was closed down. Better luck at your next location.
Overpriced! My wife got a regular salad with nothing on it for $8.00. We will not be coming back.
Poorly managed. Went in to get a sandwich at 12:25 pm on a Saturday and they had no bread! Maybe they should change their name. Not our first bad experience here. Won't be coming back.
Wanted to like this joint...yelp reviewers were positive...but sheesh, cannot\nrecommend anything.  Service was awful & taco corn tortillas were hard &\nbrittle.  Fillings were below par too.
Place looks nice, The food is pretty average though, tasted like nothing...
Prices are a bit more than $5 so a bit misleading. Food was average except Thai which was the only dishes worth getting. No credit cards and $1 charge for debit.  It is a smoky dive where you need a key to get to the restroom.
Before I even entered they wanted to charge me and my partner $40.00 as an entrance fee. Go to share or piranha night club they do not charge locals an entrance fee.
Not my favorite club in Las vegas.
Went opening weekend...waste of time. Not a real pool party when you have to keep alcohol 4 feet from the pool. Went to wet republic pool party at mgm the next day and that was a million times better.
We ordered for take out, and this was the worst burger I've ever had! And to top it off, we ordered a chocolate shake and what we got was chocolate milk with crushed ice done in a blender!  The service was friendly.
The salon is brand new and beautiful there are plenty of stations and spa chairs for pedis and even cute small pink chairs for kids. I came in for the 20 dollar pedi special. The people who work there are friendly. The pedi I got was average nothing amazing though.
This place has horrendous customer service. Sat at a table for atleast 15min and no server came to take our order or atleast give us water. I never write a yelp review but this place is so horrible I had to.
Selection is ok, but salespeople are annoyingly attentive.  I think sales techniques same at all stores, maybe they think I plan to steal or something.  I do prefer the outlet store in Glendale.
They are kind of hidden in Scottsdale Quarters upstairs next to Tanzy and iPic, so don't give up when looking for them!
I give it 2 stars.....ONLY because the staff and service were good. You may rate it higher if you are fond of those frozen Healthy Choice bowls.
Not impressed. Overpriced. Mediocre coffee.\n\nWhat kind of cafe doesn't have wifi, anyway?
For $20 food I would rather go to Thai BBQ. The servings here are to small for the price.
food isn't good
Good service, nice patio atmosphere, generous portions, excellent drinks. I would recommend the fish tacos and the house margarita, but skip the ceviche.
Came in at 315pm on a Sunday, they could not seat me until 4pm due to them transitioning from lunch.\n\nGood job with this policy...just lost a customer, I'm sure you'll lose many more...
Had key lime & maple bacon bar. Both were good but not great. 4 choices for coffee, 3 were empty so had to get the only choice. It is Sunday afternoon so will give them one more try on a morning.
We have ordered a pizza and waited long time. But at the end, they gave us a hoagie... The lady there promised to refund us, but we never received it.
Food was salty, service was OK. I only got 5 skimpy pieces of chicken in my pho ga. :(
Worst Mexican food I've ever had and being from San Diego, I've sampled tons. The food is bland and the workers were constantly getting orders wrong.
Too bad you have to select a star I wouldn't give them any!! Decided to try this place out worst decision ever.. They messed up everything we ordered. 3 phone calls and 2 deliveries later still didn't get what we ordered. Never again!!!
Food were nice but way too expensive. We waited too long between orders (waiters said too many orders and they all messed up). The waiter set us in an awful spot (in a grim corner). Last order around 9:30 PM or earlier, be prepared for that.
Overall it's a nice place the reason for only 3 stars is this: $5 to park,$35.99 entrance, $8 small locker, $3 water and only 5 working slides, a wave pool and lazy river. Make up your own minds ...
I was so excited to go to this place especially for their 40 cent wing night. What a let down!
Not a great job and mows with guards up.  Damaged my car and then denied it and started cussing.  Unprofessional and Rude and not very good landscape service.  I to wish they had a 0 star.
We waited over an hour for our food, which showed up to be only mediocre. They had live music which was decent.
I like Jinya.  I like everything about a small ramen bar with enthusiastic service and great music.  The appetizers are delicious.  I will definitely go back for more sometime soon.
Service is great! Prices are crazy though, in my personal opinion two entrees and an order of pan fried dumplings for $27 is kind of a shocker. The food is good but it's not $27 good. Very nice customer service.
The red velvet pancakes were spongy and had a sour  taste. The breakfast calzpne was mostly dough that was still raw. TERRIBLE!
Have eaten there many times. Although the food is good they seldom get the order right.
Don't buy the bananas!  They refrigerate them.  They turn brown by the end of the day. Dole bananas are the worst.
So ordered at 7pm. Pizza still not here and it's 8:50.  delivery time 8:05-8:15. Right :/ maybe I'll get it before the 2 hour marker.  Never have had it take this long usually here faster than given time. Not happy
People love this place.  I am just not a fan of their pizza.  Then again, I am an ex-New Yorker!
Service was fine but the worst corn beef hash I have ever had. Really ruined the whole meal. The server was polite but didn't seem to know what to do. There are so many better options around here.
I was so disappointed when I had my favorite \"salads rolls\" and the sauce came out tasting like snot! Very friendly though.
Food looked good but tasted decent, but there were nats and mosquitos flying around in the restaurant so it was difficult to enjoy. I had to stop eating my meal bc they flew into my food, was very disappointed.
Service sucked !13$ soggy so also sucked. Sad I was looking forward to this place wonder why people rave about it. Stick to in and out...and they charge 20% tip so I guess service doesn't matter...
Para ser arroz y frijoles,  esta muy caro. No es mi gusto en comida. Pueda que a otros les guste, en lo personal a mi no!!!
Packed up the kids and headed down to try a new pizzeria. Called in the afternoon they said they would be open until 10 PM. Pulled up at 7 PM and they said sorry we are closed.
Food is OK. Environment is awesome. Service is off. As previous review mentioned, chashu bun is a must try. Fried apply pie is special. However, the waitress is not prompt, who won't come to check if water is needed for the entire dinner.
Service was confusing and the menu transition from lunch to dinner was frustrating. Over all pizza was grand.
Unfortunately everything that my husband and I ordered was unsatisfactory. The burnt ends were extremely dry, and the crab cakes and chili were terribly bland. On a brighter note, the sweet tea was delicious.
Great menu options. Service was hit & miss. Atmosphere lacked a little bit of energy. Food was good. Grits & Pork Belly was my favorite . Quality of food was even better. Pricey for BBQ. Once management figures it out will be a great place.
I've been there twice.\n\nThe first time, the food was good and the service was great.\n\nThe second time, the food was just OK, their best dish (pork belly & grits) was not available and the service was poor.
Lee's sandwiches are lee's sandwiches iam just excited I don't have to drive all the way to China Town to get my Viet Sandwich fix...Yay!!!
The meat is bbq less. Who wants to add sauce to their own bbq...not me. It was 3 star worthy. The fries & beans were just ok. Will I return maybe.
This is by far the worst experience I have ever had. I've always loved Bahama bucks and never had a problem. But today I ordered ice cream flavored shaved ice and get a cup of ice cream and shaved ice. This is ridiculous...
$25 worth of trash. Look at the picture. We waited in line for 30 minutes to get nasty hamburgers some lame chicken french fries that were soggy all in the container here's the real show
The food wasn't bad, but it was incredibly slow service. It took forever to place an order and there was no one in line. I probably won't be back .. I can't stand slow service
I was not impressed by this restaurant.The staff was friendly and the food was quick. However, the ingredients were not anything you couldn't throw together yourself and make at home for the same cost ( and personally this pizza lacked all flavor.) I most likely will not dine here again.
Same story as everybody else. Waiting in a really long line, and only 2 attendants. They must not care too much about customer service around here.
I've made the mistake of renting here twice. Each time the line was over an hour long. Life is too short. Go elsewhere.
Just ok...cute atmosphere, friendly staff, but really nothing special about the donuts.  I was expecting a lot more, I guess!
We have eaten here three times now and the food is decent. The only complaint that I have is the size of the containers used to put salsa in. When I asked the girl if I could get a larger container she rudely said no.
I had a nice time celebrating at the club. My only issue it that the well drinks are very strong with cheap liquor. If you use less liquor you can afford to buy a better grade of liquor.
I got pushed here from the flamingo for a night. Even though it's free don't do it. Pay to go elsewhere.  Service was terrible. Check in was forever long and there was no expedite for total reward tiers.
Food was terrible. Do yourself a favor and head 1 block south to four peaks. This place will probably be shut down in 3 months.
This place is the worst,  they deserve NO STARS but Yelp wouldn't allow that. Terrible service,  bad food. DON'T GO!!!
We just ordered nachos and a burrito for delivery (via postmates) and were very disappointed by the quality of the food. It was average at best and pretty forgettable. We won't likely return again.
Stopped in for a quick dinner. Had the Sushi Combo 2 for $18, with a spicy tuna roll.\nFelt it was just alright, nothing terrible but I wouldn't want to order it again. service was great though.
Service was fast, but the burger, hotdog, and fries were overrated for the expensive price.\nInn n Out  is still my favorite fast food burger and Bachi Burger is my favorite gourmet burger place in Vegas!
