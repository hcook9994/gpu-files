0,"dr. goldberg offers everything i look for in a general practitioner.  he's nice and easy to talk to without being patronizing; he's always on time in seeing his patients; he's affiliated with a top-notch hospital (nyu) which my parents have explained to me is very important in case something happens and you need surgery; and you can get referrals to see specialists without having to see him first.  really, what more do you need?  i'm sitting here trying to think of any complaints i have about him, but i'm really drawing a blank.",5
1,"Unfortunately, the frustration of being Dr. Goldberg's patient is a repeat of the experience I've had with so many other doctors in NYC -- good doctor, terrible staff.  It seems that his staff simply never answers the phone.  It usually takes 2 hours of repeated calling to get an answer.  Who has time for that or wants to deal with it?  I have run into this problem with many other doctors and I just don't get it.  You have office workers, you have patients with medical needs, why isn't anyone answering the phone?  It's incomprehensible and not work the aggravation.  It's with regret that I feel that I have to give Dr. Goldberg 2 stars.",2
2,"Been going to Dr. Goldberg for over 10 years. I think I was one of his 1st patients when he started at MHMG. He's been great over the years and is really all about the big picture. It is because of him, not my now former gyn Dr. Markoff, that I found out I have fibroids. He explores all options with you and is very patient and understanding. He doesn't judge and asks all the right questions. Very thorough and wants to be kept in the loop on every aspect of your medical health and your life.",4
3,Got a letter in the mail last week that said Dr. Goldberg is moving to Arizona to take a new position there in June.  He will be missed very much.  \n\nI think finding a new doctor in NYC that you actually like might almost be as awful as trying to find a date!,4
4,"I don't know what Dr. Goldberg was like before  moving to Arizona, but let me tell you, STAY AWAY from this doctor and this office. I was going to Dr. Johnson before he left and Goldberg took over when Johnson left. He is not a caring doctor. He is only interested in the co-pay and having you come in for medication refills every month. He will not give refills and could less about patients's financial situations. Trying to get your 90 days mail away pharmacy prescriptions through this guy is a joke. And to make matters even worse, his office staff is incompetent. 90% of the time when you call the office, they'll put you through to a voice mail, that NO ONE ever answers or returns your call. Both my adult children and husband have decided to leave this practice after experiencing such frustration. The entire office has an attitude like they are doing you a favor. Give me a break! Stay away from this doc and the practice. You deserve better and they will not be there when you really need them. I have never felt compelled to write a bad review about anyone until I met this pathetic excuse for a doctor who is all about the money.",1
5,Top notch doctor in a top notch practice. Can't say I am surprised when I was referred to him by another doctor who I think is wonderful and because he went to one of the best medical schools in the country. \nIt is really easy to get an appointment. There is minimal wait to be seen and his bedside manner is great.,5
6,"Dr. Eric Goldberg is a fantastic doctor who has correctly diagnosed every issue that my wife and I have had. Unlike many of my past doctors, Dr. Goldberg is very accessible and we have been able to schedule appointments with him and his staff very quickly. We are happy to have him in the neighborhood and look forward to being his patients for many years to come.",5
7,"I'm writing this review to give you a heads up before you see this Doctor. The office staff and administration are very unprofessional. I left a message with multiple people regarding my bill, and no one ever called me back. I had to hound them to get an answer about my bill. \n\nSecond, and most important, make sure your insurance is going to cover Dr. Goldberg's visits and blood work. He recommended to me that I get a physical, and he knew I was a student because I told him. I got the physical done. Later, I found out my health insurance doesn't pay for preventative visits. I received an $800.00 bill for the blood work. I can't pay for my bill because I'm a student and don't have any cash flow at this current time. I can't believe the Doctor wouldn't give me a heads up to make sure my insurance would cover work that wasn't necessary and was strictly preventative. The office can't do anything to help me cover the bill. In addition, the office staff said the onus is on me to make sure my insurance covers visits. Frustrating situation!",1
8,"Wing sauce is like water. Pretty much a lot of butter and some hot sauce (franks red hot maybe).  The whole wings are good size and crispy, but for $1 a wing the sauce could be better. The hot and extra hot are about the same flavor/heat.  The fish sandwich is good and is a large portion, sides are decent.",2
9,"Decent range somewhat close to the city.  The mats are pretty solid; however, the grass range needs to be tended too.  It's like hitting out of US Open type rough...not very amenable to practicing.  Which kind of defeats the purpose of going to a golf range...Still gets 3 stars because the range is lit up at night which is excellent for those of us who are addicted to this amazing game, but are somewhat short on time (having a job kinda sucks sometimes, no?).",3
10,"Owning a driving range inside the city limits is like a license to print money.  I don't think I ask much out of a driving range.  Decent mats, clean balls and accessible hours.  Hell you need even less people now with the advent of the machine that doles out the balls.  This place has none of them.  It is april and there are no grass tees yet.  BTW they opened for the season this week although it has been golfing weather for a month.  The mats look like the carpet at my 107 year old aunt Irene's house.  Worn and thread bare.  Let's talk about the hours.  This place is equipped with lights yet they only sell buckets of balls until 730.  It is still light out.  Finally lets you have the pit to hit into.  When I arrived I wasn't sure if this was a driving range or an excavation site for a mastodon or a strip mining operation.  There is no grass on the range. Just mud.  Makes it a good tool to figure out how far you actually are hitting the ball.  Oh, they are cash only also.\n\nBottom line, this place sucks.  The best hope is that the owner sells it to someone that actually wants to make money and service golfers in Pittsburgh.",1
11,"This place is absolute garbage...  Half of the tees are not available, including all the grass tees.  It is cash only, and they sell the last bucket at 8, despite having lights.  And if you finish even a minute after 8, don't plan on getting a drink.  The vending machines are sold out (of course) and they sell drinks inside, but close the drawers at 8 on the dot.  There are weeds grown all over the place.  I noticed some sort of batting cage, but it looks like those are out of order as well.  Someone should buy this place and turn it into what it should be.",1
12,"I drove by yesterday to get a sneak peak.  It re-opens on July 14th and I can't wait to take my kids.  The new range looks amazing.  The entire range appears to be turf, which may or many not help your game, but it looks really nice.  The tee boxes look state of the art and the club house looks like something you'll see on a newer course.  Can't wait to experience it!",4
13,"After waiting for almost 30 minutes to trade in an old phone part of the buy back program, our customer service rep incorrectly processed the transaction. This led to us waiting another 30 minutes for him to correct it. Don't visit this store if you want pleasant or good service.",2
14,"This place was DELICIOUS!!  My parents saw a recommendation to visit this place from Rick Sebak's \""25 Things I Like About Pittsburgh\"" and he's usually pretty accurate.  His recommendations were to try the Reuben, Fish Sandwich and Open-Faced Steak Sandwich.  We went early afternoon for a late lunch today (a Saturday) and were seated right away.  The staff is extremely friendly.  My Mom & I each had the fish sandwich, while my Dad & Brother had a Reuben sandwich.  The fish was very good, but the Reuben was to die for!  Both dishes were massive, and could very easily be shared between two people.  On top of being extremely large portions, it was incredibly affordable.  The giant fish sandwich was $8 and the giant Reuben was $7.50.  Our drinks were always filled and we were checked on several times during the meal.  We will definitely be back!!!  Oh and a bit of advice ahead of time - they take CASH ONLY.  So come prepared, but I'm pretty sure I saw an ATM there as well.  And I do believe they are closed on Sundays & Mondays.",5
15,Can't miss stop for the best Fish Sandwich in Pittsburgh.,5
16,"This place should have a lot more reviews - but I'm glad it doesn't, they don't need to get any busier.\n\nIts been there ages, and looks it. If you're all about ambiance, don't bother. If you pretend you're in a movie set in Pittsburgh 30 years ago it works pretty well. The service is sometimes hit or miss. Most of girls are good, one is very slow, one is amazing. They are all friendly and usually a few different people will check in to make sure that you're happy. Everything is made fresh so be prepared that nothing comes flying out of that kitchen - busy times it can take a good while to get food. \n\nThe food is AWESOME! Worth any little complaints I might think up before it gets there. Once its on the table, I forget them all.\n\n-Fish Sandwiich\n-Salmon (huge and delicious)\n-Flounder\n-Shrimp a few ways (\""Norfolk\"" style is oily for my taste, and I never had it growing up in Norfolk.)\n-Hawkins St Special\n-Prime Rib (sized for two, watch it)\n\nThe prices are low, the portions are large, and just about everything on the menu  is delicious. I'm not one to pick a place because they give you a lot of food, but if you like a good value and don't want to compromise on taste, this place is a gem.",5
17,"Old school.....traditional \""mom 'n pop\"" quality and perfection. The best fish and chips you'll ever enjoy and equally superb fried shrimp. A great out of the way, non-corporate, vestige of Americana. You will love it.",5
18,Good fish sandwich.,5
19,"After a morning of Thrift Store hunting, a friend and I were thinking of lunch, and he suggested Emil's after he'd seen Chris Sebak do a bit on it and had tried it a time or two before, and I had not. He said they had a decent Reuben, but to be prepared to step back in time.\n\nWell, seeing as how I'm kind of addicted to late 40's and early 50's, and the whole Rat Pack scene, stepping back in time is a welcomed change in da burgh...as long as it doesn't involve 1979, which I can see all around me every day.\n\nAnd yet another shot at finding a decent Reuben in da burgh...well, that's like hunting the Holy Grail. So looking under one more bush certainly wouldn't hurt.\n\nSo off we go right at lunchtime in the middle of...where exactly were we? At first I thought we were lost, driving around a handful of very rather dismal looking blocks in what looked like a neighborhood that had been blighted by the building of a highway. And then...AHA! Here it is! And yep, there it was. This little unassuming building with an add-on entrance with what looked like a very old hand painted sign stating quite simply 'Emil's. \n\nWe walked in the front door, and entered another world. Another time, and another place. Oh, and any Big Burrito/Sousa foodies might as well stop reading now. I wouldn't want to see you walk in, roll your eyes and say 'Reaaaaaalllly?'\n\nThis is about as old world bar/lounge/restaurant as it gets. Plain, with a dark wood bar on one side, plain white walls with no yinzer pics, good sturdy chairs and actual white linens on the tables. This is the kind of neighborhood dive that I could see Frank and Dino pulling a few tables together for some poker, a fish sammich, and some cheap scotch. And THAT is exactly what I love.\n\nOh...but good food counts too. \n\nWe each had a Reuben, and my friend had a side of fries. The Reubens were decent, but not NY awesome. A little too thick on the bread, but overall, tasty and definitely filling. Not too skimpy on the meat. I seriously CRAVE a true, good NY Reuben, but since I can't afford to travel right now, what I find in da burgh will have to do. But as we sat and ate, burgers came out to an adjoining table. Those were some big thick burgers. A steak went past for the table behind us. That was HUGE! And when we asked about it, the waitress said 'Yeah, it's huge and really good, and he only charges $12.99 for it, ain't that nuts?' Another table of five came in, and wham. Fish sandwiches PILED with breaded fish that looked amazing. Yeah, I want that, that, that and THAT!\n\nMy friend also mentioned that they have a Chicken Parm special one day of the week that is only served UNTIL 4 pm, and that it is fantastic. If only I could GET there on that week day before 4...\n\nThe waitress did a good job, especially since there was quite a growing crowd at lunchtime on a Saturday, and only one of her. She kept up and was very friendly. \n\nThey only have Pepsi products, so I had a brewed iced tea, which was very fresh, and she did pop by to ask about refills as often as she could. As the lunch hour went on, they were getting busy.\n\nEmil's is no frills, good portions, very reasonable prices, VERY comfortable neighborhood hole in the wall...kind of like Cheers, but in a blue collar neighborhood in the 1950's. Fan-freakin-tastic! I could feel at home here.\n\nYou definitely want to hit Mapquest or plug in your GPS though. I am not sure that I could find it again on my own...it really is a hidden gem. I will be making my friend take me back until I can memorize where the heck it is.\n\nAddendum: 2nd visit for the fish sandwich. Excellent. Truly. A pound of fish on a fish-shaped bun (as opposed to da burgh's seemingly popular hamburger bun). The fish was flavorful, the batter excellent, and for just $8. This may have been the best fish sandwich I've yet to have in da burgh.",5
20,"A great townie bar with tasty food and an interesting clientele. I went to check this place out on the way home from the airport one Friday night and it didn't disappoint. It is refreshing to walk into a townie bar and not feel like the music stops and everyone in the place is staring at you - I'm guessing the mixed crowd of older hockey fans, young men in collared shirts, and thirtysomethings have probably seen it all during their time at this place. \n\nThe staff was top notch - the orders were somewhat overwhelming as they appeared short-staffed for the night, but my waitress tried to keep a positive attitude for my entire visit. The other waiter was wearing a hooded cardigan, and I wanted to steal it from him due to my difficulty in finding such a quality article of clothing.\n\nWe ordered a white pizza - large in size, engulfed in cheese, full of garlic flavor, flavorful hot sausage. An overall delicious pizza, aside from 2 things: 1, way too much grease (I know this comes with the territory, but still, it is sometimes unbearable); 2, CANNED MUSHROOMS - the worst thing to come out of a can. Ever. I would rather eat canned Alpo than canned mushrooms. And if the mushrooms weren't canned, they were just the worst mushrooms I've ever consumed. The mushroom debacle is enough to lower the review by an entire star - disgusting!\n\nMy advice for the place is keep everything awesome - random music from the jukebox, tasty food, great prices, good crowd and staff - and get some decent mushrooms; why they spoil an otherwise above average pie with such inferior crap, I'll never know.",4
21,"Good beer selection. Understaffed for a light Monday night crowd, it wasn't her fault she was the only server. But it took about an hour to get our sandwiches. Mine was one of the best reubens I've ever had.",3
22,Very disappointed in the customer service. We ordered Reuben's  and wanted coleslaw instead of kraut. They charged us $3.00 for the coleslaw. We will not be back . The iced tea is also terrible tasting.,2
23,"Let there be no question: Alexions owns the best cheeseburger in the region and they have now for decades. Try a burger on Italian bread. The service is flawlessly friendly, the food is amazing, and the wings? Oh the wings... but it's still about the cheeseburger. The atmosphere is inviting, but you can't eat atmosphere... so go right now. Grab the car keys... you know you're hungry for an amazing cheeseburger, maybe some wings, and a cold beer! Easily, hands down, the best bar and grill in Pittsburgh.",5
24,"Used to go there for tires, brakes, etc.  Their prices have gone way up-$400 for 4 mid-level tires for a Toyota.  Plus, 1 of the new tires went flat within 3 weeks.  Since they don\""t make appointments,  the wait to get the tire looked at was ~2 hours.  Sorry--can't wait that long to get a warranted repair,  They lost my business for good.",1
25,"Terrible. Preordered my tires and when I arrived they couldn't find the order anywhere. Once we got through that process I waited over 2 hours for them to be put on... I was originally told it would take 30 mins. Slow, over priced, I'll go elsewhere next time.",1
26,"Last summer I had an appointment to get new tires and had to wait a super long time. I also went in this week for them to fix a minor problem with a tire they put on. They \""fixed\"" it for free, and the very next morning I had the same issue. I called to complain, and the \""manager\"" didn't even apologize!!! So frustrated. Never going back.  They seem overpriced, too.",1
27,"I will start by saying we have a nice new deck. That is where the good part ends.\n\nWhy two stars if we have a nice deck now? Well, it all started in May when we had a man named Al come out and talk to us about the process. He was a true salesman, I'll tell you that. Not a straight shooter, but an excited salesman that wanted to sell... And we bought into it.\n\nHe told us they were backed up with the harsh winter and a lot of jobs, but they could probably start by June 24th. Mind you, this was the end of May we met with him. He said they would have to do a survey of our land and get a permit from Dormont before they started. We felt confident in going with them, and booked it.\n\nHere's where things fell apart. Weeks went by with no word from them on the process. Finally I called and left messages. Al finally got in touch with me and the conversation was utterly confusing. He must have not understood me because he just kept talking in circles. So I hung up not knowing what was going on. Finally I called back and the admin told me that the survey could take a couple weeks to come back. I wish Al would have told us that.\n\nSo our June 24th date came and went. We finally got our survey. And they were quick to bill us for it, but no word on where we were in the process. I called back a couple times with no real answers from the admin. Apparently they were now waiting for the permit from Dormont.\n\nA month later, I was frustrated and asked to speak with someone at the company. I spoke with someone who told me that Dormont usually takes a week to process the permit, but we were now going on a month. He told me he would bug the guy about it and we finally got it. \n\nI completely understand that waiting on the permit is not their fault, but why no communication about it? Just call me and tell me they're waiting for the permit, but they'll work towards asking Dormont what the hold up is. Seems simple.\n\nFinally we get the permit and work is supposed to start. Tuesday comes and they have to wait for approval from Dormont on holes they're digging. So holes are dug and equipment is put in my backyard and then nothing happens for two days. Where did everyone go? Who knows, because I wasn't informed! \n\nI was upset and contacted the company owner, Dave, by email. I told him how frustrated I was about the lack of communication. He wrote me two sentences that  said \""there will be acres there tomorrow morning to finish and most will be done tomorrow.\"" Well, that didn't happen.\n\nThen two other dudes show up two days later and did work for about three hours and left. The main guy comes back the next day and says they did it wrong. So apparently the part about how they wouldn't need access to my house changes to they're drilling bolts into my house to secure he deck. \n\nFinally, the second week into construction, my tiny 10x11 foot deck is done. It was upsetting that they left the deck dirty, and all the dirt and cement they moved around wasn't cleaned up. I even asked them to fill all the holes they dug up and didn't use, and they only filled up one. When you create a construction project, isn't it just good business to clean it up and make it look nice? Didn't happen here.\n\nMy main point is, contractors have a reputation for not being the most trustworthy. Why be that company? Why not be an upstanding company that consumers can trust? My main issues with them were that things were not communicated to me properly up front, nor was the ongoing process communicated to me. Then they left everything unfinished in my eyes, leaving the site dirty. I understand things happen and things get delayed, but just email or call me. It's not that hard to keep me updated, it is 2014 with a million ways to be contacted.\n\nEven though I have a nice deck (after I clean things up myself!), I would not recommend them to anyone.",2
28,Hoofah.,2
29,I heart King's. I've always been a fan and this one was as good as my old one in Monaca.,4
30,Average run of the mill store.  Associates are young teens and they really don't know where anything is.  Luckily I am able to get around to find everything.  Found my puppy treats and moved on.,2
31,"Two meals, on the recommendation of a friend who lives near the place, and after the second trip, I was compelled to write. 'Rocky' would definitely describe the experiences.\n\nOn the first trip, I went to try their (at that time)raved about Reuben. And YET to find a true good Reuben in da burgh, I tried it.\n\nWell, they were out of the proper bread, and the guy had to run to the store to buy the closest thing he could find, which was not the proper bread, and instead of one of their 'raved about' Reubens, I received two mini-Reubens, which basically took the guts from one Reuben, and spread it out onto two sandwiches on regular sized bread. I ate it. It wasn't great, but they swore it was because they'd run out of the bread. Bread or not, it still wasn't great. The atmosphere was pleasant in that 'blue collar bar' kind of way, and the staff was very nice, but not a winning pitch on the Reuben.\n\nThe second trip was after a long day of moving furniture with the same friend. Sat in the back room, instead of the bar, which felt more like a restaurant, of course, with the big screen TV covering the sports of the moment.\n\nI was in the mood for dinner this time, and after a scan, decided on fried chicken and mashed potatoes with the salad bar. My friend ordered one of her faves, the breaded pork chops.\n\nWe hit the salad bar, which was uber-basic. Three soups (mostly vegetable loaded, which left me out), basic iceberg lettuce mix (very probably out of a bag), a few veggie toppings, and three or four dressings. It was a basic salad, no big deal. More or less an appetizer filler before the meal.\n\nThe mind-blower in this trip was the ordering of the fried chicken dinner. Our waiter looked like a 19 year old gas station attendant, skinny little blonde guy with a sweet but incredibly naive face, and an air of vapidity, which was confirmed when I placed my order. I asked what chicken pieces came in the dinner, and asked if it was possible to only get dark meat. I never imagined how confusing a question that could possibly be. It literally took him two trips back to the kitchen to 'ask', and the child honestly had no clue what 'white meat' and 'dark meat' meant. The first answer he came back with was that the chicken came in a pre-portioned prepared bag, kind of Kentucky Fried Chicken style...which didn't answer my question, thus prompting the second trip. \n\nAfter the second trip back I heard the cook holler 'Tell him I'll fix him up'. \n\nWell, the chicken was prepackaged dreck like you'd find in the freezer case of Walmart, tiny and not good, and the potatoes had that slight tinge of chem-spuds flavor, laden with some kind of chopped up green (parsley?), and a side of that basic brown gravy served up in 5 gallon buckets.\n\nThank goodness for the basic salad bar.\n\nEven my friend admitted that her pork chops were different and not what she'd expected. They also appeared to be from a freezer bag.\n\nThe irony was that the boy who didn't know white meat from dark meat, was chatting with some other customers...about baseball...and he was a genius about the mindless sport of baseball. Ahhhh da burgh.\n\nThird base? Nah...why bother when there are so many other options around. Go on in a grab a beer and chat black and gold if you happen to be in Carnegie...they can help you out all types of ways in that area. Just don't go hungry if you actually have tastebuds.\n\nFrom what I understand it 'used to be' really good homecooked food. But apparently, mama has left the kitchen.",2
32,"Rocky's has been in business since the 1980s and still going strong.  Their food is good.  Not haute cuisine, pretentious!  Everyday, well prepared and taste bud pleasing home style cooking.  I've mostly gone during supper hours and  and ate in the dining room, but, today I introduced an old friend to \""linner\"" in the bar.\nHe ordered the large version of fish sandwich.  Rocky's is famous for their fish.  Three large breaded and fried fish filets, bun and fries for under $10.  Needless to say, he had no complaints and brought home more than he ate.\nI ordered the meatball grill.  It was delish.  Served on thick cut Italian bread and made \""grilled cheese\"" (mozzarella) style.  Meatballs and tomato sauce are both good!  Also, served with fries.  I brought home half the sandwich.\nAnother good meal there.  Friends, mother, and former boss all enjoy their food!",4
33,"If you want a true understanding of Pittsburgh in the morning, come here. This greasy spoon is always packed, and is one of the better of its kind south of the city.\n\nThey serve waffles in halves, which is great. The eggs and toast are good, the homemade hot sausage is excellent. The drawback are the barely cooked potatoes.\n\nIf you're hungry, get \""The Mixed Grill\""... Gab and Eat's brand of the \""kitchen sink\"" breakfast that all Midwest places are about.",3
34,"Cheap, unpretentious, and, for this, one of my favorite breakfast joints in the country.  Simply put I LOVE it here.  The mixed grill, the sausage and egg on a biscuit, the home fries.  This it the very definition of diner.  Thank you Gab 'n' Eat!",5
35,"I miss this place. When I return home to pittsburgh this is always a must to ease myself into a saturday morning recovery after getting banged up on cheap south side cocktails the night before. When I think of pittsburgh, I remember cutting morning classes in highschool just to get after the best bacon egg and cheese i know of. Honestly i live in nyc where you can get a bacon egg and cheese on every single corner, and nowhere that i have been does it as well as this joint. Go here and you will be happy you did.",4
36,Love this place.  Never had a bad meal.  Good portions and great people.  Be ready to stand in line.,5
37,"OK, what is with all of these \""CASH ONLY\"" places in Pittsburgh? I can appreciate that some smaller businesses might have trouble installing a credit card system in their store/resturant, but could you perhaps provide an ATM?  In the past, this would deter me from eating at this place. \n\nLooking at a standard breakfast menu, I decided to go with a tuna melt instead. What I got was a cold tuna salad sandwich with a slice of cheese on toast. I had ordered a melt being in the mood for a warm meal, but to no avail. One day later I can't even remember what my side was. I suppose it didn't leave much of an impression on me.  I have to say that the dessert was really good! The cherry pecan pie! I have not seen this concoction anywhere else but this was awesome! The cherries were not the sweet canned variety, but a pie worthy tart topped with sugar. I think I want to make this pie with my parents next harvest of our cherry tree!\n\nMy first impression is \""Eh.\""  I am learning how crazy Pittsburghers are over breakfast! Seriously, waiting 30 minutes for a table at a tiny diner with a menu that reads as follows:  \n\n\""2 eggs and toast $x.xx\""\n\""2 eggs, meat, and toast $x.xx\""\n\""2 eggs and pancake $x.xx\""\n\nI'd rather go to a Denny's and order the \""create your own Grand Slam!\""",3
38,"BEST DINER IN THE COUNRTY!!! We've been to many famous diners across the country and we still give  Gab and Eat the best rating !! I was a little intimidated when I first walked in and there was like 2 pounds of butter just sitting on top of the homefires on the grill.  If you are looking for a healthy breakfast they probably can accomodate you, but Everything I ate was clearly the opposite of healthy.  After trying like every meal they have I would recommend the mix grill(half unless you are sharing) adding cajun seasoning with the texas toast.  Burgers are great too.\n\nIt's hard to find a place that makes a better breakfast than you could make by yourself at home, but this place does it.  The atmosphere is classy, old school Americana.",5
39,"Great breakfast, good price. You might have to stand outside in line though, so I don't really recommend winter time to go. lol. Very friendly service, interesting coffee mugs. They have great deserts and such also. Bring your cash though as they dont' take cards.",4
40,"I always love a good diner.  Gab and Eat was just what we were looking for on a Saturday morning.  Good food.  Great people. Pittsburgh ambiance. \n\nThis place is obviously a beloved neighborhood gem.  I had french toast and bacon.  The french toast was made with the best Italian bread.  My fiance had what they called a 'mixed grill.\""  It consisted of eggs, peppers, onions and home made sausage.  Not something you would eat everyday, but he loved it!   They also had great coffee.  They actually ground up the beans in front of us.  Now that's fresh.\n\nWe want to return sometime for \""turkey day.\""  Apparently they made fresh turkey every Tuesday.  Now that sounds good!\n\nCan't wait to return.",5
41,"I have been coming to Gab n Eat for almost 20 years and They have never let me down. I get a typical breakfast if eggs, ham, toast, and home fries. Delicious as usual. The ambience however is usually lacking. The walls are dark, with writing and signatures of semi famous people all over the place. Pictures of local people hang on the walls(i secretly want mine up there) along with posters galore. While its fun to look at the first 10 times, it gets a little boring after awhile. So today when I arrived I expected the same old experience. Wow was I wrong! As soon as I looked at the door I knew something was different. The place seemed lighter and brighter. To my pleasant surprise, they painted and got new counter tops!! They're not quite done yet but the place has a new Happy vibe to it. The awesome breakfast, the new decor and the 5 guys sitting at the counter making me laugh are why I will be back( maybe for lunch).",5
42,"What a find! I stopped in here for breakfast while in town for business. The service is so friendly I thought I was down south. The service was quick, frankly and felt like I was with family. \nFantastic poached eggs, Cajun homefries and crispy bacon. Gab and Eat is definitely a place I world recommend to locals. I was stuffed and the bill was only $8.00.",5
43,Great little place. Treats you like a local.Eaten here 3 times a week for a month.  Same overtime. Barb is always here.,5
44,"My first time going to Barb's Country Junction and I really wanted to like this place, I really did...however, I didn't.\n\nThe food was decent, some was above average and some below but it was overall decent. I got pancakes, bacon and eggs. The pancakes were really good and fluffy, the home fries were simply okay and the eggs were not cooked well. My son had a burger and it was good. The coffee at this place was brewed to perfection which a appreciate. I would give the food 3/5.\n\nThe service was subpar for sure. While our waitress was a really nice girl, she wasn't on top of anything at all. Had to ask for coffee refills, had to ask for silverware, for napkins...etc. She got the order messed up and so on. I give the service 2/5.\n\nThe inside of the place had some country charm as you'd expect but want particularly cleanly. It also had a leaky roof in several places which had buckets collecting the water. A customer even tripped over the buckets and fell. I give the interior 2/5.\n\nThe prices were decent. I fed my whole family breakfast (3 of us) for $23. I give the prices 3/5.\n\nSo in summary, you can get okay food here for a rather cheap price but it is not a great place to dine in by any means. There are better diners in the area that I will patronize in the future rather than Barb's.",2
45,"My husband and I tried this place for the first time today. It was easy to find and no problems with parking. It's \""Seat Yourself\"", but there were no signs stating this, so we stood there looking like fools for a minute. It took awhile for the waitress to acknowledge us and I'm guessing that this was Barb. She apologized and said that one of her workers called off today. No big deal and her apology was appreciated. She came back with our drinks, dropped them off, and left again. We didn't see her for another 20 minutes. Ultimately, we were there for 30 minutes before she took our order. This was aggravating to me. I don't mind waiting for my food if I know it's going to be awesome and they're making it with love, but come on now. We ordered the hot pepper omelette/home fries/ toast and chocolate chip pancakes/sausage. The food was alright, really nothing special. A new waitress ended up taking care of us and she was much more attentive. We may or may not go back.",3
46,Tonya is super sweet and the front desk people are very helpful,5
47,"If I could give this place less than one star, I would. I have no idea who gave this place high reviews but they must either own the place or be time travelers from back in the day when this place might not have sucked. The decor is tired and grimy, the place reeked of smoke, and the bartender/server was surly, to put it mildly. We went there on a Saturday night with a mind to try the Irish food. Apparently, we were out of luck. I've always thought that the secrets of restaurant success is to actually stock food for people to eat. He told us before we ordered that they had no \""pies\"". No chicken pot pie, no shepherds pie, etc. So, we gamely tried to order other things. We placed our order. My wife, for example, ordered the Irish stew and he came back 5 min later telling us they were out of that and even more things for several people in our party. At that point my wife picked out a third option, ham and cabbage, only to be told again that \""they were out\"". At that point, realizing that the only food to be had in the place was what was crusted on the menus, we asked to pay for our drinks and left. They actually then gave us flack for not having enough to put it on a debit card. In short, unless you like your dinner with a side of disappointment and depression, I'd probably avoid this place like the plague. Speaking of the plague, I suppose we should thank Mr. Surly for inspiring us to walk out. I only have two bathrooms at my house and would've been hard pressed to accommodate several violently ill people at once.",1
48,"Best Irish food in the Burgh.  Great bar food too.  The service is maybe a bit surly and it's not the cleanest, nor the best decor.  But, that's not what this place is about.  It's a town Irish bar and it serves great solid Irish fare and suds to the locals.  And it does it better than anyone.  I go back again and again.",4
49,"Okay, so hopefully you haven't been enjoying happy hour @ Riley's Pour House before you read this or you might not be able to follow the lilting Irish owners. \n\nTo recap: Murphy's Pour House from 1979-1985. Sullivan's Pour House from 1995-2002. Paddy's Pour House from 2002-2012. And, bagpipe please, Riley's Pour House opens March 1 of 2012. Still with me?\n\nIt's a tiny long bar just like the old Irish pubs. No more smoking allowed. Hurrah!!!  Same lousy service. \n\nMy guess is that the entire place needs (no, strike that .... demands) an automated food/beverage ticketing system. None of the cooks, bartenders, or waitresses know who ordered what nor what ticket belongs to which table. It's actually pretty funny if you're not a) hungry or b) thirsty. \n\nI really really want this place to do better. We need more Irish pubs and local old time watering holes. \n\nGet it together, Murphy's ... er, I mean Sullivan's....er, I mean Paddy's or is it Riley's? ;  ).  Whatever the case, they have cold Guinness. And Irish music.  And fun patrons.",2
50,"The delivery driver mistakenly rang my doorbell, having confused 133 and 113.\n\nRather than taking a step back and analyzing the situation, he begins to accuse my wife and I of ordering and refusing to pay for this pizza.\n\nThe driver then gets on his cell phone and rather than calling the number than was given when the order was placed, begins to call his bosses and starts threatening me with felony charges. \n\nSo I take the initiative and ask the fine upstanding gentleman what the phone number of the order-er was, phone my neighbor and discover the mistake. Rather than a thank you or a sorry, he just speeds off (breaking the speed limit on our block) to reach his destination 50 feet away.\n\nI would call to complain, but based on the other reviews, its clear the owners do not care about Carnegie or it's residents, and its pretty well known around town just how awful their food is, so it would be pointless to boycott a place I'd never order from again anyway.\n\nDo yourself a favor and order from ANY other establishment in town.",1
51,3/6/12  visit -  i am from san francisco bay area and if u want a dive go to china town in san francisco. - this place was dirty like chinatown dive but some of the best food i have every tasted came from a dive. the food was really good and my group ordered a bunch of different things it was all good- a- taste.- prices are reasonable a-. --------they dont speak english very good and got my order wrong.\nsweet potatoe fries a+\npizza  - a\neggplant hoagie b+\ngreek salad b+\ngyro a+\nif they scrubbed the place down and the lady spoke better english 4 star ****,3
52,"Some of the worst pizza I've ever had.  We used a coupon from the paper for a 2 topping 8 cut Sicilian. First of all the pizza wasn't even cut through, and the sad attempt at cutting was so uneven that 4 of the slices were about an inch wide, while the others were about 4\"" each. The toppings were scarce, they used mini pepperoni and put maybe 8 on the whole pizza. The onions were huge chunks and the mushrooms were straight from a can. The worst part though was the thick doughy crust that tasted more like a fishy sourdough roll. I'm serious... It was so noticeable that it made me wonder if the dough was bad or if they for some weird reason put fish sauce in it. It was gross. \n\nWe also ordered steak and Italian hoagies. The veggies were old and wilted, and there was no dressing on either. The Italian had deli meat that was clearly bottom of the line and not very generous. The \""steak\"" (if you an call it that) was greyish instead of brown and looked like it was a processed meat chopped into pieces. No flavor or seasoning and the texture was reminiscent of spam. It was so bad that I only ate 1/4 of it and tossed the rest. \n\nI have ordered from here in the past and always been disappointed. I thought I would give them another try since I'd never ordered a Sicilian pizza from there. What a mistake. I will never order from them again!",1
53,"I needed alterations done to my suit very quickly. Like three days quickly. Not only did Filberto at Alteration World have it ready, the price was beyond reasonable and the work was EXCELLENT! I plan on bringing all my clothes to him from now on.\n\nOh and he let me know that they also dry-clean. Wonderful shop!",5

But I had to stop here on my way home from work tonight. \n(I think I feel my heart yelling at me again) , The gal at the drive thru window was just soooo sweet , I just might go back and ask her to marry me! \nBut then again , she gave me a slip with a survey on it to fill out online. \nMaybe she just wanted my positive response. Ok Sarah B. you got it ... now where's my free coke ?",3
56,By far the worst most unprofessional dentist I have ever experienced her staff is too busy watching soap operas on all the TVs in each room instead of cleaning and she gave me a filling which was too deep which could have been understandable as her son had his pictures delivered from Hawaii and she had to stop 3 times to pay for them and show her whole staff all of them must be nice to have a 14 year old go to Hawaii on her moms dime and have her patience wait to see all of this happen I had to have oral surgery and have the tooth removed because she put the filling in too deep an abscessed tooth was the result I wouldn't recommend her to an ex girlfriend or someone I hate because of the three months of extreme tooth pain I had to deal with because of her lack of care and follow through even after I called and asked them for advice and follow up they simply could care less and did not even offer to reschedule an appointment other than prescribing me vicodin and antibiotics do not recommend and do not go to her license should be pulled!!,1
57,"When I moved to the area, Dr. Weinberg was recommended to me by my cousin who had been a client for years. I've had nothing but positive experiences with her and her staff since seeing her two years ago. The team is professional, nice and courteous. I recently had to reschedule an appointment due to a last minute work thing and they were very accommodating. My daughter looks forward to coming to the dentist so that's saying something. I DO wish they would turn off FOX news in the lobby as I'd rather watch paint dry but... nobody's perfect.",4
58,"In all fairness - I did not see this dentist but did schedule an appointment and waited 15 minutes for them to open.\n\nWhen I look at Yelp reviews, I usually weed out the outliers (the best and the worst).   Unfortunately, there are only two reviews.\n\nIt was my first time at the office.   The office admin (very nice) asked for me to come early (before 9am) to complete paperwork.   I arrived at 8:50.    I waited.   I watched 2 employees walk by me (unlocked the door and re-locked it).    They did not acknowledge me.\n\nThe door I was at had signage (open hours).    I decided to leave because of a review where the staff seemed distracted or disinterested in my presence.\n\nThe office admin (very nice) called me to inform I am missing my appointment.   I explained to her that there were too many indications where this was not going to be a good fit and wished her the best of luck.\n\nI recommend if you see this dentist you go to the front door (furthest away from the parking lot) for the entrance.\n\nPoor recommendation because the staff who walked by me seemed to be distracted which was pointed out in a previous review.",1
59,"I've been to this office a good amount of times.  Each time the receptionists give of a vibe of entitlement and it is very uncomfortable.  Dr. Weinberg herself is very nice, but I doubt her ability. Every procedure she has done to my teeth has backfired. The third and last issue I have is that i always paid cash at the end of my visits and somehow I have received an invoice for $55. I called and of course the receptionist was sassy and rude so I gave up. Will never go back or refer anyone else",1
60,"Don Don is a restaurant I find myself missing now and again, it's probably my favorite restaurant in Carnegie. Simple setup, just a small restaurant with a few tables and a TV. Oddly enough I think my favorite thing to eat there is the wonton soup, never had better. The food is average but I always enjoyed eating there, great service and a cheap place to get Chinese food.",3
61,Take it from me; avoid this place at all cost.  The only time I go is when I am starved and don't have the energy to cook or get edible food.  And then after I have been kicking myself.,1
62,Far away from real Chinese food. Doesn't even taste good as American style Chinese food.,2
63,"I used to order takeout here once every month or so. The food tastes average and the price is good. It's your typical low-end Chinese place. \n\nThe last (and final) time I ordered here I just so happened to be picking up my order while a health inspector from allegheny county health department was making his rounds. While I was waiting on my food (which took much longer than usual) the inspector was pointing out violations. He also requested a copy of a certificate that the man behind the register was unable to produce. The inspector looked at me like I was crazy for waiting on my food despite the obvious poor conditions.  \n\nAs for the rest of the place - it's always been kind of dirty inside. The carpets are just FILTHY and the walls match. There are always children's toys scattered about the floor because the owners children are always there, so be careful not to trip. \n\nThe workers do seem like nice people just trying to make a living but when it comes to cleanliness Don Don is lacking.",2
64,We went on a weeknight.  Place was not busy waited over 20 minutes for drinks and to have our order taken.  We ordered an app and it came out with the meals and that was another 20 minutes or so.  Food was luke warm at best.  I would not go back.,1
65,"This location never disappoints!! Food is always consistently great, and if you come at the right time, (witching hours) you may see the cook singing and dancing along with the music in the back. And it is awesome! ! Love this place!!",5
66,"I belong to this gym...  I live in the South section of Pittsburgh, and I find that this gym is not too far from me.  The staff is friendly, the equipment is quite good.  You get two free personal training sessions when you join.  They have lots of weights (which my boyfriend uses) and a decent cardio room.  The only thing I would say is to increase some of the cardio equipment.  Water is only $1 a bottle!",4
67,"I bought a three month membership last year, mainly to attend the Silver Sneakers classes. I was in my early sixties and hadn't exercised in a while. I tried the evening classes but they were very crowded and difficult, so I tried a morning class for seniors. I like to stretch out before my class actually starts, so I went to the tail end of a yoga class. The women in this class were very nasty to me and told me that I wasn't welcome to stretch out in their class. I never went back thanks to the attitude of the other members. I didn't feel welcome here. I complained to the manager, who said that I was welcome to stretch out in whatever class I wanted to, but the hostility of these yoga students was very evident. Do they think that this is their private gym?",2

69,"I brought my husband and my parents all to Papa J's last time my husband and I were in Pittsburgh. My parents are really picky about their italian food, usually they drive places in east bumf*@ (tarentum, ligonier...) to get their capital I-talian.\n\nMy pop is kinda grumbly, and getting him to try something new is like pulling teeth. The only reason I got him here was becuase they were on their way to drop us at the airport.\n\nWell, my dad goes back now regularly and that says a lot, considering he lives in Murrysville. \n\nThe first good sign Dad was happy was that he seemed impressed when it was open- it was noon a few days after Christmas. Second good sign was that Dad ordered wine, at it was only 1 pm. Dad, while not a teetotaler, rarely has a drink before 5 pm so I know he was anticipating a good meal. The kicker was that he was so happy he left our waitress a $20 tip on a $50 meal. \n\nCan I say, I live in Texas now and I still relive this afternoon back in December? I had chicken picatta...it was perfect. My dad had eggplant rollatini, my mom had a pizza, and my hubby had basic pasta and marinara. It all was amazing, delicous, and inexpensive. In Austin, you can't get a decent italian meal, much less a decent italian meal for under $50 for four people.\n\nI know there are so many good Italian places in Pittsburgh but I just think back so fondly on this day...when me Dad liked someplace I took him :)",5
70,"I've been to Papa J's twice and had mixed experiences.\n\nBoth times I had the banana pepper appetizer, which is great and goes really well with the FRESH and delicious bread and cheese they give you at the start of your meal.\n\nFor entrees, me and my girlfriend have had mixed experience.  I've had the fish sandwich (very good) and the eggplant parm sandwich (okay).  My girlfriend got the salad with bread and basil on it, but the basil was over powering and the bread was soggy with the dressing. \n\nThe service is also a mixed bag.  The first time our server went out of her way to take care of us and even MADE me cocktail sauce for my fish sandwich.  The second time, the server was lackluster, didn't know anything about the menu and wasn't able to take proper care of us.  \n\nI would return to Papa J's, but I my terrible experience last time isn't enough to say it would be my first pick of places to eat around Carnegie/Robinson.",3
71,"What a wonderful surprise found in Carnegie PA, just south of Pittsburgh.  I was in town on business with a couple co-workers and after having a not so great meal the night before, we asked one of the locals for a recomendation.  They told us to try this little Italian place called Papa J's and boy did they send us to a great place.\n\nFirst off, when you walk up to the place, the front and side windows give you a fantastic open view into the kitchen from the outside.  You can stand outside and watch the chef making all the wonderful food and you can smell the fresh bread before you even walk in the door.\n\nI am not sure how long this place has been around but the kitchen looked well used, while the dining area as well as the bar looked very clean and modern, almost as if it had been freshly updated.  \n\nThe server was quick to welcome us and suggested several different items off the menu as his favorites when asked.  The three of us were very hungry and wanting to try a few different things, so we began with a Margherita pizza which was absolutely perfect.  They obviously make their own breads and dough for the pizza and I don't think this pizza could have tasted any better.  Then came bowls of Italian wedding soup which was pretty good.  Of everything there, this was the one item I probably could have done without.  Not that it was bad, but there was nothing particularly special about it.  \n\nWe also ordered the Garlic Rolls (not that the bread they already give you and the pizza was not enough carbs for 1 meal) and they were to die for.  Crunchy on the outside and warm and chewy inside, these things were a meal by themselves.  One of the guys with me said the pizza sauce would be good on them so he ordered a cup of the pizza sauce (which is fresh made there, not out of some can) and he was right.  As if these little killer bread balls with garlic were not good enough, dipped in the pizza sauce they were even that much better.  \n\nBy the time our meals came, we were all pretty full, but we pushed on and continued to eat.  I had the Veal Parmigiano which was tender and very good.  It came with a side of pasta which I tasted just to try and it was excelent as well.  Had I not been eating a weeks worth of carbs in one sitting with all the pre-meal stuff, I certainly would have finished it.  As it was, I ate most but not all of the generous portion of veal.  \n\nOne of my co-workers had the Chicken Picatta which he said was one of the best he had ever had and the other guy tried a pasta dish which he said was very good as well.  \n\nThey had a great wine selection as well at reasonable prices by the glass or bottle.\n\nOverall a fantastic experience with great food and atmosphere.  I don't really know how expensive the area is for food, but coming from the Chicagoland area, I fouknd this place to be pretty reasonable.  The three of us ate very very well for an average of aproximately $30 each not including alcahol.  Fantastic fresh food at a reasonable price, who could ask for more.\n\nMy only complaint is that I had to return to Chicago and I am now craving to return to Papa J's.  I hope work sends me out here again sometime soon!!!",5
72,"Yay, I'm a fan but sometimes service is a little slow, it was very good for us this visit.  Go to Papa j's every once in a while but mostly for the White Pizza.  It is the best white pizza I have ever had.  Order the white pizza on our visit this  weekend... it has garlic, spinach, feta cheese and we usually add some veggie on top.  It was delicious!  Order fried calamari and it was OK...note to self next time try the calamari roman style.\n\nLike the dinning room with the hardwood floors and bright lighting.  \n\nThe bar was jumping thou never go to the bar.",4
73,"Terrible service.  Food unremarkable.  Waiter disappeared for 45 minutes to serve larger group due to staffing mismanagement.  Saved his tip by discounting meal after I complained.  All and all, a very crude and unpleasant dining experience for me and my guests.  Not to be repeated, never again!",1
74,"Yay, I'm a fan of the white pizza.  Had take out.  \n\nThe bar was jumping when I picked up our order.\n\nThe white pizza is so delicious...with garlic, spinach, feta, and added some veggies.  Tried the Roman Style calamari, very good better than the fried calamari we had last time.",4
75,"OK, its Friday night and have about 70 minutes to eat. Driving by Papa J's and W says, lets stop in and get a quick dinner. \n\nAdvice host that we are in a hurry.  The host advised us it is a 90 minute service. The place was crowded, we were seated at the last open table. However our waiter, Jason, said he will do his best to get as out on time. We ordered our dinner immediately, with a salad and a glass of wine. In a few minutes we had our wine, then in a few more seconds we had our salads and some great homemade Italian bread with some olive oil and balsamic ving. for dipping.  Yum!\n\nJust as we were finishing our salads our dinners were delivered. Great job Jason! The Fettuccine Carbanara was very good; a thick cream sauce with bacon and ricotta.  In and out in 60 minutes.  Now that is some good service.",4
76,"Great little gem! The food was fantastic was very food and just the right price. The Italian food was amazing, but you can not leave without a dessert and be prepared for giant serving. I had the carrot cake yummy!! Def a place everyone should try.",4
77,"I have to say that I write this review with much regret, because I have always loved PaPa J's. But my recent experience there has changed my mind a bit. \n\nFrom the minute we were seated, we were greeted by a server that was clearly inexperienced and didn't know the menu. As I said before, I've been to PaPa J's a good handful of times so I know the menu decently well, but the server couldn't explain any of the questions I had about a couple new dishes I was thinking about trying. I swear this guy must have just looked at the menu for the first time a few minutes ago.\n\nBut it wasn't just the knowledge of the menu. It was one thing after another with our server. My wife asked for a glass of water 4 times until she finally got it (at which point the meal was over, so we didn't care at that point).  I mean come on, for a restaurant of this calibre and price is it too much to ask for a glass of water? There was no one filling up water.\n\nMy biggest complaint, however, is what happened with our meals. My dad and I both ordered the trout special (trout with roasted red peppers and lump crabmeat). Instead, the meal that was delivered to both of us was trout with a heaping pile of spinach and mushrooms. Not what the special was at all.  And by the way, that item is on the menu as a regular item so whether or not the mistake was made by the server (which, we are sure it was) or the chef, who knows for certain. Not to mention, though, that a good server wouldn't have served us that regardless. \n\nBut before you think we had an unusal experience that was all due to a poor server, let me continue. When we informed our server of the mistake, he didn't really believe us until he checked his order sheet, and then he blamed the error on the chef. At this point, the meal had been sitting (because it took us forever to flag this guy down again) so the trout was basically cold. The server then said he would have the meals re-made. So, he took the meals back to the kitchen. Meanwhile, of course, my wife and mom are eating their meals and my dad and I are sitting there with no meals. Also keep in mind that my wife still had not gotten the water she had been asking for, and my iced tea had been refilled with a soda (yes, believe that or not). All the kitchen did was scrape their \""mistake\"" off of our fish! They didn't remake anything. Our fish was served to us again with little pieces of spinach and mushrooms sticking all over it. Quite frankly, the fish wasn't good at all. I honestly would have rather had a fish sandwich from McDonald's that night. The server never did anything to try to make our experience better - he knew we weren't happy, but never offered anything such as dessert on the house. I'm not looking for a handout, but our experience was just plain awful that night. The guy never really even apologized for the mistake. Normally, I may have asked for a manager, but at this point I was ready to just get out of there (plus, we had to be somewhere else that night).\n\nMy opinion... for the money, there are many other restaurants I would rather eat at.",2
78,san francisco california visitor liked the food and the local is great. I am thinking about relocating to pttsbrgh area. I liked Carnegie because u can stroll down Main street and hit a couple places for lunch. I imagine this place would be crazy busy on friday or saturday night. we ate a lunchtime and it was nice.,4
79,"Coming here you get the feeling they haven't changed much.  The tables, the decorations, the menu.  All the same.  Does that make you a little worried?  Yes.\n\nI ordered the mushroom ravioli and it was... oily.  Very very oily.  The actual ravioli was okay, enough mushrooms.  but it was oily.  Did I mention that?  \n\nAmbiance, like I said, left much to be desired.  I don't think I'd have this place on my list of \""musts\"" for downtown.  Much better restaurants to visit!",2
80,"Had dinner at Papa J's with a group of 6.  I loved how the restaurant is in a old brick building with large windows. It felt like a neighborhood restaurant. On a Saturday night, the restaurant was full but not crowded.  We were seated in a room with poor acoustics.  It was difficult to hear people at our table and the waitress.  While she tried, I can see the asperation in her face when she had to repeat the specials to both sides of the table.\n\nPeople ordered bourbon on the rocks before dinner which seemed watered down, while my lemon drop was made nice.  The bread was delicious!  Can you describe it to be creamy?  The fried zucchini was lightly breaded and not too oily.  It was a large portion made up of 2 sliced zucchinis.\n\nWe ordered a variety of dishes.  The pasta dish was dry with more pasta than sauce or meat.  Those who ordered the fish special thought it was delicious.  The shrimp dish was enjoyed as well.  I had the chicken marsala which was pretty good.  The marsala sauce wasn't too thick, and the chicken moist.\n\nHard to tell if the deserts were \""homemade.\""  The tiramisu and spumoni were small in portion and meant for one. \n\nOn the whole, I was on the fence with my overall impression of Papa J's.  \""A-ok\"" probably is the best way to describe it.",3
81,"Service in this place is poor because of lack of acknowledgment since people working there are \""just\"" working . They have nice decor,nice bar and good bread. Consider where this place is ,the prices are really really high . Nothing is served on the side with main dishes ....",2
82,Terrible service...terrible food...this place smells like rotten wet wood,1
83,"Although the first impression through the door is charming and the aroma enticing  as you enter this restaurant- much can be improved upon for the prices asked for the dining experience. Our group of 7 had called a week ahead and were seated in the back of the far dining room, right by a door where clinking pots /pans and  dishes were heard throughout our meal, as well as a Darth Vader type noise coming from the ceiling vent. Our waitress was not knowledgable of all menu items, and three of our  very simple requests did not come out as ordered. ( dressing on the side of a salad,  less feta on an entree and no oil on another entree) The waitress blamed it on the cook, but did offer to get one entree changed. Also we were asked if we wanted pine nuts, feta or Gorgonzola on our salad and then were charged 2.00 extra per item in addition to the salad price (6.99) which brought the salad up to 10.99 ! Outrageous !\nThere is so much possibility for ambiance in this restaurant , but they miss the mark on service and atmosphere. I will most likely not return. Very overpriced for the quality and service.",2
84,Papa J's is expensive and inconsistent.  The ambiance is nice but it doesn't justify the prices.  There are better restaurants in Carnegie.,2
85,"I was pleasantly surprised by this restaurant.  Came here with no expectations.  \n\nI was greeted by a large open (garage style) window, that opened the whole lounge bar area to the street.  It had modern furnishings and the staff were quite friendly.\n\nOrdered the quattro formaggi pizza.  Quite good!!!  Great balance of cheeses.  Not too rich at all.  Crust was excellent too.  Can't wait to come back.",4
86,"Absolutely Awful Service.  Went to Papa J's awhile ago and the service was bad - the waiter was surly, rude and unhelpful..  Decided to try it again since it is close to Stage 62.  Big mistake.  Greeted by a dour manager that seemed mad that we had a reservation. 30 minutes to get a glass of wine.  At one hour and 45 minutes complained to the manager that we still had not received out entrees.  He said 'What do you want me to do about it?\"" and said they had a busy night.  This is when tables around us sat empty. I then had to go back to the manager to give us our bill so we could get away from this ruined evening.  The bill was prepared incorrectly. If you want average food and terrible service, this is your place.  We will never go back.",1
87,"Service was great. Apps delish, specifically the stuffed banana peppers & lentil with ham soup. I think I chose the wrong entree though because I ordered a cod with crabmeat special. The cod was completely tasteless with some crabmeat layed across the top. It all reminded me of boiled fish. Yuck! Note to self. Order the pasta!",3
88,"I love this place! The food is always so fresh and delicious. The staff is always friendly, as well.",5

90,It was just what we were looking for. The service was great. My husband had the veal sausage on green pepper appetizer in the larger size. It was great (spicy) and enough for a meal. I had the stuffed eggplant. That was very good but the sauce could have been a bit heartier. I would definitely go back. Really nice atmosphere and free parking in the back.,5
91,"We stopped at Papa J's last Friday night (8/1) for a round of drinks. There were 7 of us altogether and we had eaten at another restaurant earlier in the evening.  One member of our party walked up to the bar to let them know we were sitting on the couches along the wall, as it was fairly busy that night. In the short time that he was there, a man who was behind the bar looked at him and then turn away without saying a word or notifying anyone else. He then turned to a waitress who had approached the service area of the bar and asked her if  we could have a server take our drink order. She said \""yep\"" and then abruptly turned and walked away. At that point, he asked to see the manager  who came a few minutes later. When my friend told him of what had occurred, the manager said \""What do you want me to do\""?\n\nMy friend said \""An apology would be a good start\"" whereupon the manager looked back at him and said \""Get out and don't come back\"" ???????? Are you kidding????\n\nMy friend is well traveled and frequently stays at higher end hotels and dines at quality restaurants. He was not screaming or belligerent in any way, shape, or form; simply informing the manager of what had occurred. \n\nThat being said, we left and went back to 131 East, where we had previously eaten. The service there was fabulous, as was the meal and the drinks creative and exquisite.\n\nThere are new restaurants that have opened in Carnegie as of late. Papa J's is no longer the only game in town.  Obviously this is the way a simple complaint is handled by management. Appalling!!  Do yourself a favor and frequent any of the other restaurants that are within walking distance of Papa J's. They understand the concept of  customer service.",1
92,Some of the best chow around--love this place. The bread and salads and soups are great.,5
93,"Finally, great Tuscan-style Italian food in Pittsburgh, not that tasteless stuff that locals think is Italian.\n\nThe bread was warm and fresh. The bolognese sauce was creamy and rich, and unlike most restaurants was made with veal. I love the fresh smell of baking bread throughout the restaurant.\n\nI'm looking forward to working my way through the menu of chicken options, and next time, I'm saving room for dessert! The display of cakes and pastries at the door was amazing.",5
94,"Man has this place gone down hill.  My husband and I went a couple of weeks ago.  We had salads and pasta.  Both were on the verge of inedible.  With a single glass of wine, I felt downright robbed at the $50 price tag.  Seriously, I could have easily made what we had with jarred sauce and boxed pasta at home. Classico is better.  And the service was pretty absent to make it even worse... seemed she knew it was terrible and didn't want to deal with it.  Seriously, I'd rather eat at the OG.",2
95,"Talk about overpriced. $18 for a fairly basic pasta with some obviously frozen chicken chopped up over it. The latter was terrible, thin and flabby and rather unappealing. The pasta itself was ok, as was the sauce. The desserts are pretty good. But honestly, that is a $10 dish whose price has been inflated.",3
96,"I've decided where I stand with Emmert Dental. They are unprofessional, rude and have no clue what they're doing (behind the desk). I will not be going back nor will I have nice things to say about them.",1
97,"THE WORST DENTAL EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE.  THEY ARE BUTCHERS!  My husband and I went to Emmert Dental in Bethel Park for a routine cleaning and check up.  I had one tooth that I had a recent root canal on and a few small cavities that needed filled.  After the so called dentist - Dr Carnavali - did my exam, I needed 3 additional root canals and an extraction! An extraction on the tooth that just had a root canal. I was told that part of the tooth had broken off and that a crown was no longer possible.  I didn't know any better, so I agreed to schedule the extraction for a few weeks later. The \""dentist\"" wanted to extract it that day, but I had plans for the weekend and was not about to be in pain. So, 2 weeks later, I went in for the extraction.  After they gave me novocaine they get me with \""you need a bone graft also in that area since we are extracting that tooth\"". I have never had any issues with bone loss with previous extractions so I didn't feel it was necessary. I had 3 employees surrounding me, pressuring me for this bone graft. So, I reluctantly agreed. I had to pay $259.00 for this \""bone graft\"". So, I signed everything. I wasn't even given enough time to read the document, so I should have known and got up and left right then and there. The \""dentist\"" started the extraction. I have never been so uncomfortable in my life. He pulled on my tooth, used a metal instrument to pound on my tooth and was pulling so hard that my head was coming up and slamming back down against the head rest.  Finally, after a good 15 minutes of this torture, he ripped the tooth out of the side of my jaw. I was literally ganging from all the blood running down the back of my throat. He then stuck some pink powder up in the extraction area. I'm assuming this was the bone graft.  I ended up with many stitches. I was given an antibiotic and instructed to schedule an appointment for the following Saturday so they could start the bridge. Then I was hit with a bill of $569.00! My insurance covers 100% of extractions.  I was in so much pain for 2 weeks following the extraction. Pain severe enough that I had to call off work and I couldn't sleep at night.  I refused to go back to Emmert Dental.  And after a visit to a very reputable dentist, an endodontist and an oral surgeon, I have to have oral surgery to try and repair the damage Emmert Dental has done to my mouth.  They caused a very large deformity in my jaw and I am at risk to lose additional teeth.  Save yourself a lot of time, money and pain.  Emmert dental only cares about the money, will over charge you and leave you less than happy with the dental work.  They are butchers and should not even call themselves dentist. And if you have an issue with their billing practices, don't expect to that resolved easily.  I have called numerous times and I am always told that the manager and or billing department is not in.  I have contacted the BBB and a lawyer.  I expect and want a full refund.  No one should have to go thru what I am currently going thru.  They do unnecessary extractions so they can do a more expensive procedure such as a bridge or an implant.  Now I have to go thru oral surgery, more pain and suffering and more time missed from work because of Emmert Dental.  And the root canals they said I needed, my current dentist and my endodontist both agreed that I do not need tooth canals.  In fact, the teeth are perfectly healthy.  They are crooks and butchers.",1
98,The worst dental office I ever been. No one can beat it!!! You should avoid it at any time.,1
99,"Eat at your own risk. The service is terrible, the staff seem to be generally clueless, the management is inclined to blame the staff for their own mistakes, and there's no sense of FAST in their fast food. When we came, half of the menu board was still on breakfast, and it was 4:30p. The only thing they have going for them is that the food is hot and tastes just like McDonald's should. \n\nThen again, the franchise is owned by Rice, and I've come to take terrible service is their MO.",1
100,"My expectations for McDonalds are t rarely high. But for one to still fail so spectacularly...that takes something special!\nThe cashier took my friends's order, then promptly ignored me. I had to force myself in front of a cashier who opened his register to wait on the person BEHIND me. I waited over five minutes for a gigantic order that included precisely one kid's meal. After watching two people who ordered after me be handed their food, I asked where mine was. The manager started yelling at the cashiers for \""serving off their orders\"" when they didn't have their food. But neither cashier was anywhere near those controls, and the manager was the one serving food to customers and clearing the boards.\nThe manager was rude when giving me my order. She didn't make sure that I had everything ON MY RECEIPT, and never even had the decency to apologize that I felt I was getting poor service.\nI've eaten at various McDonalds restaurants for over 30 years. I've worked at more than one location. I expect bad days, bad moods, and the occasional mistake. But I have yet to have a decent experience at this store. It will remain a place I avoid unless someone in my party needs to avoid illness from low blood sugar. Perhaps I should go back to the racially biased service of Steak n Shake instead!",1
101,"I've tried to give this McDonalds a chance but my patience has run out. The only reason why I came here as much as I did is because I like the $1 iced coffees. But it's not even worth it. This McDonalds is poo and so is most of the staff. \n\nWhenever I want to go through the drive-thru I can't because there is a line of cars wrapped half away around the building. And even when the line is shorter there's always a hold up of some sort. So most of the time I just park and go inside the restaurant. \n\nToday was a horrible day. I ordered an iced coffee (no cream or sugar) and a chocolate chip cookie. It only takes 30 seconds to fill a cup with coffee and 30 seconds to take a cookie out of the case. I waited 10 minutes!! Sorry but that's too long just to get a coffee and a cookie! It's not like I ordered a meal! During that time I saw people come in after me and get their milkshakes and iced coffees within two minutes! WTH?! I told the petite sleepy eyed cashier I wanted my money back! Her eyes opened wide in surprise, like I really woke her up or something. She said,\""Youre the one who ordered the iced coffee? I can get it for you!\"" For real? She was the one who took my order! I told her I waited too long and I just want my money back. The manager offered to make my iced coffee, but  I refused because I had just had enough.\n\nThere are *few* employees there who work hard but everyone else is dragging their feet. There is no organization or teamwork, everyone is scrabbling. It looks like none of them want to be there. I used to work in fast food and I know it sucks, but come on!\n\nI'm sorry but I can't recommend this Mcdonalds. It's poo. I'm not coming back here anymore. Guess I'll be going to Starbucks- and their iced coffees taste better anyway!",1
102,"This McDonald's is so bad it's amazing.  \n\nOrder:  Big mac, large fries, diet coke.\n\nThe soda machine was broken.   No sodas.\n\nThen I got to the window.  \""We rang you up for medium fries.\""   (Not what I asked for)  \""Well, if you want a large, you're gonna have to wait 4 minutes.  We just started a new batch.\""\n\nLeft with:  Big mac, medium fries, no coke.\n\nActually, now that I think about it, this was one of my better experiences there...",1
103,"We had the worst possible experience at the Eat N Park at Waterfront on 2/12/10 at around 10pm. Our waitress (Annemarie) was inattentive and got us the wrong order. We ended up with a dish we had not even ordered and still got charged for it on the check. \n\nOne of my friends ordered a Buffalo Chicken Sandwich, which according to the menu description, should've had lettuce and tomato in it. But the sandwich that arrived on our table had none of those ingredients. When pointed out to the waitress, she just brought some lettuce and tomatoes in a plate! How crude! \n\nSpoke to the manager after paying the full check and first of all, she did not even offer to re-imburse for the item we did not even order, and that had been forcibly thrust upon us. \n\nWhen I asked the manager about the Buffalo Chicken sandwich not having any lettuce and tomato, she said they just got new menus and that description is not correct and that Buffalo Chicken Sandwich is supposed to be without lettuce and tomato! What a lame excuse! Even your online menu says under the description for a Buffalo Chicken sandwich that its supposed to have both those ingredients - \""Served with lettuce and tomato on a fresh-baked Kaiser roll.\"" - That's what the last line in the description of Buffalo Chicken Sandwich says. Shame on you Manager for lying! Instead of admitting her fault, she was blaming it to a new menu!\n\nNot only did we have to pay for something that we didn't order or eat, but we got sub-standard food that was different from what was described in the menu, and had to deal with a really bad waitress and insensitive and deceitful manager to top off the whole experience. \n\nI am never going to come back to any Eat N Park location ever again, and will never recommend one to any of my friends either. What a waste of time and money! Plus dealing with callous and lying people - my goodness, I surely had my patience tested this evening!",1
104,"They burned my fish and they burned it bad.  Ordering fish at Eat'n Park is always a gamble.  I just never know how it's going to turn out.  I'm a risk taker so I ordered two pieces of baked lemon sole. \n\nWell it went terribly wrong.  My waiter came out and said, \""They burned your fish, so I had them put two new pieces in the oven.\""  I was impressed by his honesty and didn't mind waiting for two new pieces.  \n\n I gladly helped myself to my boyfriend's french toast while I waited. \n\nThen out of no where another server comes to the table with the burnt fish and sets it down infront of me. With the burnt side down of course.  That just shows the kitchen is not in total coordination.  \n\nLike I said getting fish from Eatn' Park is a toss up. In the end I got two nicely baked pieces of sole to replace the burnt ones, so I left satisfied.",3
105,"Some how even though the food at this Eat'n Park is down right abominable, the smiles and laughter is always there.  How can I stay mad when the prices or so cheep? Myself my boyfriend and his nephew had lunch with milkshakes and me having a coffee it was $31.00\n\nOn this particular occasion the fire alarm went off and rang and rang and rang loud and long for over 15 minutes before the fire department got there realized they didn't have key to turn it off and than another 10 minutes later finally shut it off...only at Eatn' Park.\n\nMy baked potato was hard as a rock, I had ordered two pieces of baked cod and only received one. \n\nThe waitress was very sweet and attentive and really attempted to build a rapport with our lil nephew which I thought was sweet.",2
106,Mmm...peppermint mocha\n\nIn my quest to visit every Starbucks in the USA I have stopped at yet another location.  This one is located in the center of a circle road -- very cache and in a newer part of the area.,3
107,"If there was ever a \""get your coffee and go\"" Starbucks, this is it. Right in the center of the Waterfront, this Starbucks has no sofa, comfy chairs, only table seating. I love the baristas here, But I don't like the location of the building.",2
108,"I just realized they remodeled this one recently-ish. Well, in my world recently because it's been a while since I've been here.\n\nThey've added more seating which makes it way more conducive to having a meeting here. Which is my concern during the week. I imagine during the weekend it just fills up with tweens getting their sugar rush before hitting the movie theater. \n\nThe coffee, or tea for me.. Is still same old same old. I don't imagine one single Starbucks will break the mold and make original drinks...",3
109,Great location!  Close to shops and theatre.  Nice staff.,5
110,This Starbucks is teeny-tiny!\n\nSeating inside is VERY limited.  This is a Starbucks to grab and go and continue your shopping at the Waterfront.\n\nBaristas are friendly and fast.,2
111,"As far as Starbucks go, this is a pretty nice one.  The baristas are friendly and while I was here, a lot of regulars must have come in, because they bantered away with almost everyone.  The bathroom was clean and well maintained and the trash wasn't overflowing in the canisters around the store.  The pastries looked fresh, but I didn't partake.  The noise level was also at a nice working level - not too loud, music just barely audible.\n\nI do wish there was more seating.  It is nice that this location has a counter at the end of the bar for sole workers, but it doesn't replace more tables.  I'm sure this isn't as much of a problem in the summer when there's the space outside.\n\nThere was a treat receipt promo going on, but the barista didn't tell me about it, which I found odd.  Usually when they have promos like that going on, they ask everyone if they want their receipt to come back later in the day to claim whatever the offer is.  Today it was one of their new pastries for $1, I know in the summer they do $2 grande iced drinks with that morning's receipt.\n\nOverall, nice working or socializing environment.  Very friendly and inviting.  It's what I've come to expect from Starbucks, so points for consistency.",3
112,"I'm not a huge fan of this location. I think that it was oddly built- the small, alley-like front makes it difficult to get past people on your way to/from the bathroom or tables when it's busy. And there's hardly any tables to sit at. Furthermore, people tend to clog the front on their way in, which makes things particularly difficult (especially in the winter weather). The staff were pretty impersonal to be, but maybe that was due to the high traffic of the place and the time I was there. And the coffee that I had was cold- I'm sure it was probably the bottom of the batch. I'd probably only walk in here again if someone else suggested it before or after a movie or while we were shopping in the area.",2
113,"This Starbucks is 5-Star Friendly. The shift supervisor Lucious keeps the energy in there moving and light. He recently helped me with a merchandise return and embodied everything a good manager and all around mensch person should - patience, kindness, generosity and fairness. I left that afternoon loving Starbucks even more than when I went in. It's great that a company and their employees can be as loyal to their customers as their customers are to them.",5
114,"For someone who straddles the line between sometimes craft-er, this store can seem vast and confusing.  There's rows and rows of baskets and bedazzling jewels and paper and...oh my...scrap booking!  When I want to find boring old felt....it's like...where do I start?  \n\nI'm in a hurry, as always, and I rush in and the first thing I look for is an employee.  No one to be found.  I could call out and my voice would come echoing back.  I run between rows of paper, wood and gosh darn scrap booking....no felt!  Where do I find felt!  Where do I find an employee!?\n\nFINALLY, I find one after 15 minutes of wondering around.  She's incredibly nice and leads me to the felt.  This is not the first time I've been hard up to find help.  I tell her she was hard to find, and she tells me that they're \""low on payroll\"" and can't have any one the floor BUT HER!  In that WHOLE store, JUST HER!  That's ridic!\n\nNot a month ago I was, again, in a slight hurry and stood in line for about 15 minutes to check out, with 2 employees at the register and 6 people per line, I gave up and walked out.  \n\nHey Michael, do you pick up what I'm putting down?  You're not making any money because your costumer service SUCKS....in fact, there's no service to be found!",2
115,"I have been frequently shopping at this Michaels store over the last couple months since I began taking a cake decorating class and hosted a large baby shower at my home. The store has typically had the supplies that I need from cake and cupcake baking and icing to scrap booking supplies. This location is pretty average compared to other Michaels - it's exactly what you would expect when going to this store. It's not a large store, but it's not a small store -- just average.\n\nI do enjoy using the Michael's coupons when shopping. I definitely save a lot of money! Instead of toting around the paper versions, I actually have the iPhone app that has coupons available to use from the app. \n\nMy only complaint is that sometimes it takes a while to check out at this location. I don't normally have a problem - usually only one or two people ahead of me - but sometimes it can be much slower. Today, for example, there were only two customers ahead of me, but one of them was having issues with a coupon. The line began to get longer and longer, and though a couple associates were lingering up front, they kept calling for someone else. From personal experience of being a manger in a retail store, do not linger or let your associates linger near the cashiers without jumping on register. Whatever the reason may be that you are not helping customers, it still appears rude and make everyone more impatient....",3
116,"The one good thing I can say about Michael's is that they have a wide variety of hobbies and crafts included in their selection. They've got items for woodwork, painting, knitting, kids crafts, scrapbooks, you name it. The problem is, the variety of products for your particular craft is probably dismal. They've got lots of cool items all over the store that you're convinced that somehow you need. (Because it is soooo cute, and you could TOTALLY do something with it. Right..?) The store feels cluttered because there is so much stuff everywhere. However, if you're looking for something specific, good luck. It's not even a matter of the product being difficult to find in the store. It's that when you find the right section, there's either nothing in stock, or they simply don't even carry what you need. \n\nI stopped in for crochet supplies, and the yarn selection was laughable compared to many other craft stores. I ended up going elsewhere for my stuff anyway. \n\nPlus the prices at Michael's are significantly more than other area craft stores. I usually only stop there if I'm already at tend Waterfront. I'd recommend checking other craft stores first. Unless you need glitter. Especially fine glitter. Michael's has the best glitter selection/quality of any store I've ever been to.",2

It was so bad and we had waited a ridiculous amount of time (c'mon, Steak N Shake is basically a glorified McD's), our waiter comped our WHOLE MEAL.\n\nIf not for the compensation, I would have been pissed that we had to pay for such a crappy meal.

You can't entirely blame the waitress since she was the only one there for the entire place...poor scheduling on the manager's part. However, while she can't be accountable for the slooooow service, she was accountable for both orders being incorrect.  The burgers were over cooked and the fries were soggie and the milkshake was runny at best...\n\nBy far my worst visit to Steak n' Shake!",2
122,"Rather typical SnS.  Had a good lunch crowd.  Milkshake was good but not as good as EnP down the street.  It took to long to get the burger for some reason, 25 minutes, I realized cooked to order but this is a little long for SnS.  Ordered the Guacamole Steakburger and it only had a small portion of Gauc...not your usual amount..kitchen was not up to speed on portion sizing for some reason.

Before we, and another party walked out without even being greeted properly, I observed several employees traipse out the front door, several tables who were waiting for their food for a long time,  several employees just standing around out of direct view of the tables, a morbidly obese hostess that could barely physically walk from one end of the store to the other. I think one server was high. \n  \n  Going there was a  special request by a 7 year old getting over a long-ish illness, so that makes the shabby treatment more enraging.",1
126,This place is s l o w....like so slow I have got up and left after waiting 30 minutes and not even being acknowledged by a server. The food is okay. Def not worth the wait. Milkshakes are just okay as well. Booooooo.,2
127,I really like the chili. Burgers are fair and salads are pretty bad. Pretty hard to mess up a side salad. As others have said you never know what kind of service you will get. Store is usually understaffed and cleanliness is fair. The staff is usually disinterested with customers and sometimes outright rude. All in all what you pay is what you get. Cheap and crap service.,2
128,"Fast food done right, what more can you want?\n\nA throwback to old timey diners, steak and shake is where you get a decent meal at a good price. \n\nMy sisters and I arrived on a Tuesday afternoon around 3pm catching their 2-4 happy hour, which we read on the door upon entry; a lovely surprise. This meant that all shakes and drinks were 50% off! \n\nI ordered the western BBQ burger, which was 2 thin patties, cheese, bacon, BBQ sauce, and fried onions. It came with shoe string fries (my favorite), all for the low price of $4.79. Are you kidding me? What's not to like! The food was actually pretty good! I liked it a lot. Since it was happy hour I also \""splurged\"" on a chocolate covered strawberry shake. It was meh. Could have gone without it. The overpowering taste of artificial strawberry really turned me off, but the hot fudge saved it. But, how can you really go wrong with hot fudge?\n\nAll in all, 3 meals and 3 shakes came to $20. A steal. Also the food is good! I enjoyed it. I'd come back.",3
129,Fast food in a resturant setting.  Considering this food is good and cheap plus you can get food to go.  Must be a reason why this place is always packed.,4
130,"The food is good. Unfortunately the service is very hit or miss. The main issue seems to be with the kitchen, the waiters and waitresses are often very apologetic for the long waits and it's pretty obvious that some of them avoid the tables after taking the initial order to avoid hearing complaints.",2
131,"Food is good, what you'd expect from Steak n Shake. THE SERVICE IS AWFUL. so incredibly awful. expect to take at least an hour for your meal, even when it's slow. I've been going here for years when I want a cheap meal, but the service is so so so awful. Go to McDonalds.",1

She never brought my check, never checked to see if my drink needed refilled, she just mopped the floors. \n\nThe burger was really greasy, the fries were Luke warm and the cheese on them wasn't as flavorful as it should be. As a new Pittsburgher I'm not impressed.",1
133,"I should have known better than to stop here, but I was nursing a hangover and just wanted something quick and simple.  I should kick myself for thinking of this place.\n\nGranted I decided to go to the drive thru and knew there would be a wait.  The sign actually says that the food is prepared when you order it.  I sat for almost ten minutes at the window while my food was prepared.  During that time I wished I could have taken back my order and also wished that I hadn't paid already.  \n\nWhile sitting at the window I decided to just stare inside and watch some of the employees doing their job.  What disturbed me the most was watching the employee making the milkshakes.  Making a milkshake isn't that hard or glamorous of a thing to watch.  What disgusted me was that the guy actually lifted several of the containers for the milkshakes and smelt them.  I mean smelt them to see if they were clean, instead of actually taking the extra minute or two to clean the container.  After witnessing this my food was finally ready and I drove away.\n\nWhen I finally got to eating my food I was underwhelmed.  The fries had no flavor and with the size of the cut it appears you get more than what you ordered.  The \""steakburger\"" really, they should just call it a burger, was overpowered by the BBQ sauce on it.  It was all I could taste.\n\nAll this has cemented me in not wanting to ever step foot in one of these establishments ever again.",1
134,"Burgers are not the best quality. Better than McDonald's but not much better. The fries are fairly thin, but crispy. They aren't bad. The prices are also quite decent. However, their shakes are amazing. Thick and creamy. It's also great that they have half off shakes on weekdays in the early morning like 1-3am.",3
135,"You know what you're getting with a Steak N Shake: it's about one rung up from a McD's in quality, and about two rungs down in quickness. At least, you think you know. \n\nI used to have a small place in my heart (though the salt and fat weren't very kind to said organ) for Steak N Shake, because hey, who can argue with beef and drinkable ice cream? But after my last trip, I can think of nothing more disgusting than having to eat here, this location in particular. I haven't been back in over year, and I will never step foot into a Steak N Shake as long as I have an immune system that I care about. \n\nAfter having eaten here, I hit the restroom on my way out (along with my two friends....hey, we're girls, it's acceptable!). One stall was already taken, so two of us are stuck waiting while this occupant does her....shall we say, business? After a few seconds, we realize that she's not only there to relieve herself, but to also take drive-through orders. Yes, that's right....\""You want fries with that? *flush* Okay, that will be $5.50\"". I have never, ever witnessed anything so insane as a drive-through restroom. To top it off, after finishing her \""bathroom break\"", she walks straight out of the stall and into the restaurant. I guess she was in too much of a rush to complete the order she had just taken that she didn't have time to wash her hands. And I was in too much of a rush to choke back up what I had just eaten before it wreaked mayhem on my stomach.",1
136,"I love Steak N Shake. This one, however, leaves a lot to be desired. The food often comes out cold and the servers are apathetic at best. Most of the time, they're downright rude. I highly recommend avoiding this location if possible. There's one on Route 51 that's worth the 15 minutes it'll take you to get there.",1
137,"Every time we come here the service is laughably bad. On this visit a tabe which was sat after us had their food before our server graced us with her surly presence. Good restaurant elsewhere, just avoid this location if you want to get your food inside an hour.",1
138,"Wow. Dirty and slow.  The floors felt like they had the days burger grease spilled all over, and it took 30 m8n to get our take out order.",1
139,"This place teeters between a 2 and a 3 star review.  I've had pretty good experiences inside, it's usually the drive-thru where things fall a part.  \n\nIt's the rare place I can get a Frisco Melt well, the ONLY place I can get a Frisco Melt!  and that steak burger alone is worth the risk, Walk In OR Drive Thru.\n\nJust take a gun on Weekends, you'll be fine.",2
140,"This location is terrible. The drive-thru workers are rude and they give you crap food. I waited 5 minutes before being able to order, even when there was only 1 car ahead of me. Then the lady proceeded to ask me if I would like anything on my burger, and (thinking the pictures on the menu are what they're supposed to look like and they would never false advertise) I asked \""doesn't it come with the fixings like in the picture?\"" she then told me it only comes with cheese. So I then went on to tell her what I wanted on my burger. Pulled around and got my order pretty quick, but later when I open my burger its just meat and cheese. The meat is badly burned and cold. It was clear to me this burger was not fresh. I didn't even attempt to eat it, what a waste of a place. They definitely need better workers.",1
141,"Steak 'n Shake's food is pretty good and the prices aren't bad for the quantity of food. I ordered a grilled chicken salad with no dressing. The salad looked thrown together and was $5.49 for 2 croutons, tomatoes, carrots, cabbage, lettuce and chicken breast. (They forgot the cheese!) The staff wasn't very friendly or helpful and seemed like they didn't want to be there. There usually is a long wait at Steak 'n Shake, but if you catch them when they aren't busy, you will breeze through- drive-thru that is. I do like their food and you can eat healthy options, but the staff isn't helpful and the quality isn't always there.",3
142,"Nice staff but apparently there is little manager oversight around 3:28am.\n\nI do like this place.  It must be nice to work somewhere that allows you to choose your own tasks.  Like smoking, sitting and texting.  I'm fine with cooking my food being fourth on the \""to do\"" list because there is no where else togo really....\n\nWhy didn't they answer me at the drive through? I think they wanted me to come inside because my girlfriend and I are really really really good looking.\n\nThis was annoying but understandable.",2
143,"It's okay. Food is cheap but portions are small. For example I order the chicken tenders, and I got 3 little tiny tenders, and a decent amount of fries. Also the restaurant is not really clean either.  This restaurant is not my number 1 choice.",2
144,"As far as I'm concerned, Filene's Basement is good for two things: cheap dresses and cheap accessories.\r\n\r\nAs a young performer, I need good-looking dresses for frequent auditions -- and I need a couple, so I'm not wearing the same thing every time. The dresses on the second floor usually range from $30-60 and are good for over a year. It can be hard to find a full-length dress that's not reminiscent of a prom dress, but their selection of cocktail-length dresses is ample.\r\n\r\nAs far as accessories go, Filene's tends to have cheap versions of popular trends. If I feel the need to stock my wardrobe with a transient fad, Filene's is the place to go.",4
145,"Even when we didn't have a car Filene's Basement was worth the bus trip to the Waterfront. I always find something (usually I find 3-4 things and spend about $60) and better still, I am always still wearing the clothes and shoes 3 months later. \n\nI kind of suspect this is the best shopping in Pittsburgh; it's much better than the usual department stores, better than Marshall's and TJ Maxx and better than the Saks downtown, even when it has a sale. Selection, bargains AND quality.\n\nI like this Filene's better than Gabriel Brothers, which are harder to get to. Gabriel Brothers are a real discount shopper's challenge and I'm afraid I didn't live in Pittsburgh long enough to develop the necessary skills . . . Filene's was still up and running in June 2007 when I left town.",4
146,"Love this store!  Don't always have much luck with the sales, but I always find something I like here.  This isn't your average Marshall's or TJ Max.  I think the green dress I'm wearing is from Filene's!",5
147,Another store which has gone the way of the Dodo bird. Actually there was nothing basement like about it. What will be done with the empty space that is the question?,2
148,"$9.75 for a red bull and vodka? I'm sorry, I thought I was in Pittsburgh, not New York City. Sing Sing, a dueling piano bar, is fun, but it would be a hell of a lot more fun if I could have more than one watered down drink before I warbled my way through \""Paradise City\"" with the rest of the crowd.",2
149,"Really enjoyed this a lot more than I thought I would.  The drinks were on the pricey side, but I didn't head here to get smashed.",3
150,Had a great time at Sing Sing a while ago with friends.  Friendly staff.  Will return.,5
151,"In my opinion, Sing Sing is really not worth it. It gets expensive because you drink, maybe start to sing a few lyrics, drink some more, think of a song you wanna hear, put $5 and title of said song on a piece of paper, you drink, they play it, everyone else is trying to get their songs played so you put $10 on your next sticky note...and so on and so forth. I wasn't really into it when I first got there but as the night went on and lager went in I started to warm up to the place. I feel that if I have to drink in order to have a good time, it's not worth it. But again, that's just me.\n\nThe 2 stars are for the piano players, who are entertaining and very talented, and the Rock Bottom brews they serve.",2
152,"Dueling piano bars in Pittsburgh started at Station Square, and they died out. Then when the chain restaurant magnet \""waterfront\"" opened in 2000 the parent company of The Rock Bottom Breweries decided to open Sing Sing in back of The Brewery.\n\nWhen it first opened it was pretty cool. The very first house band could put on a show that led to standing ovations. I know, I was there. From Stairway to Heaven to Free Bird, Stayin' Alive to She's My Cherry Pie, Elton John to the Boss, they were amazing at sounding like the bands they were covering. Equally incredible were the obscure songs that audience members would shout out, songs only you though you knew, and they would effortlessly sing a good portion of the song, sounding like the band who's song they sung.\n\nBut today, Sing Sing seems like it's stuck in the early part of the 21st century. The whole dueling piano, shout out a song to stump the band, Sing us a song you're the piano man has run it's course. I don't hate Sing Sing, but I could never come here more than once a year. It's a been there, done that kind of place.",3
153,"Sing Sing is awesome!! Give a buck or more and they will play anything, and if they don't know it, they will search for who requested the song so they can do something else the person will enjoy! :) Great humor too!! :)",5
154,"What a great time!  This place was awesome!  I wish I lived right down the road, because I could see myself being a regular here.\n\nHonestly, these guys have got some talent, like real talent.  They can play the piano, sing, play guitar, and the drums.  Did I mention that they are all pretty hilarious, too.  I'd easily pay the $7 cover to get in here any day because it really is worth it.  \n\nI am sure I will be back in no time at all.  Next time, I am bringing a big group of friends.",5
155,"This place has gone significantly down hill.  I've gone to Sing Sing about once a year for the last 6 or 7 years.  When we started going there you couldn't get a seat unless you got there early.  It was always packed.  However, each year the crowd seems to get smaller and smaller.  Crowd is an important component of a piano bar due to the interactive nature of it all.  I was there last Saturday night (8/4/12) and there was about 20-30 people there.  Very slow and boring.  It appears the crowd is no longer allowed up on stage, taking a lot of the interactive fun out of what this place used to be.  This was likely my last time at Sing Sing.  Save your $7 and skip this place.  A real shame because this place was once a lot of fun.",2
156,"Went here for the first time this past weekend. Needless to say I'll be returning! It was a blast!!!\n\nIt was cheap to get in and since we got there a bit earlier we got a semi-good table. Though it was very annoying that people had reserved tables right up front and never showed up. WHAT IS WRONG WITH THESE PEOPLE?! Everything if you ask me! Seriously though if you're going to reserve a table, you better freaking go! \n\nI had no complaints about the place itself! The guys were hilarious and watching my brother get made fun of multiple times was just the cherry on top! Anddd this has to be the only place I've ever enjoyed being around people who were sloppy drunk, because the comedians take no prisoners! \n\nI did enjoy when Matt and Joey were the ones up there because they are just amazing and make it so much better! They are great at what they do. Can't wait to go back!",5
157,"Always a good time, although it's definitely not a place I would visit often. It's great for groups....which is quite obvious since there are always several folks there for bachelorette  parties and birthdays. \n\nShut out to the piano players, who can not only play the piano, but also sing, play the drums and the sax. They are funny and know how to keep a crowd entertained. Also know some pretty obscure songs. \n\nMy big criticism is the set up. If you don't have a reservation and/or come later in the evening, it's difficult to get seats. Believe me, I don't mind standing, but it does become a bit awkward when you have to keep scooting over to let waitresses and patrons past you. If you do find a seat, it is often littered with someone else's empty glasses.",4
158,"The musicians at this place work hard to entertain the crowd, so I can't say they are all bad.  However the minimum for a song request is $5.  I spent $20 on a song for my girlfriend and they NEVER played it!!  They were playing songs for $5 and $10, but my $40 got me no where.  Even if they didn't know the song, which I doubt, they could have picked one they knew and improvised,  my tip, save your $$ on the requests.\n\nOtherwise it's fun for special events every once in awhile.",3
159,"I went here with a bachelorette party. We had reservations, which was good because it was packed that Saturday night. The performers were very talented, but the acoustics were strangely off.   The theme that ran through the whole show was, to quote some phrases they kept repeating, \""you bitch, you slut, you whore\"" and  \""twinkle twinkle little slut, why don't you take it up the butt\"" which one of the pianists wrote on the mirror at the back of the stage... You get the idea?  Perhaps if I had not been the designated driver, alcohol would have made these jokes funny the fifth, sixth, seventh time. Or maybe not.",2
160,He was incredibly sexist/homophobic. He could barely play the piano and when we finally recognized a song we could actually dance to he literally asked me to get off stage because he didn't like another on stage who could actually dance with the girls.,1
161,"Pretty fun place to go every once in a while, but, believe me, by the end of the night you'll be ready to go. The show lasts around 5 hours, by the 3 hour mark you'll be sick of sitting there in the crowd with your $9 a pop drinks listening to the same dirty jokes over and over and over again.",3
162,"My best friend took me to Sing Sing for my bachelor party. I had a blast. The musicians (dueling pianists) made fun of me in a bunch of songs. They also were really good at playing requested tunes (rock). When the show was over we shuffled across the hall to the connected \""Rock Bottom\"" restaurant for some grub. We all had so much fun that we went back for my buddy's bachelor party.\n\nThere were some drawbacks though. We went on a Thursday night so the atmosphere was lacking as the place was pretty empty. And of course they are a little pushy soliciting tips when the place is empty. But it's not our fault the place is empty on Thirsty Thursday, if their drinks weren't so damn expensive maybe more people would show up. And sometimes they used vulgar language which was just unnecessary since they would have otherwise still been hilarious. Also there was no table service, and the only bartender was a bitch. I'll probably be back, but only for a special occasion when I can afford it.",3
163,"I usually have nothing but good things to say about this place. I've dealt with Fran and others and have had very good experiences. However, this time was very different. I called to find out how much they might charge to install some brakes and rotors that I had, i was reffered to Mark, the mechanic. I made the appointment with him for Tuesday Sept 30th, he quoted me between $179 - $200 for the work (though the first person I spoke to quoted $150-$179) and told me to bring it at 8am and it would be finished the same day.when I brought it on Tuesday, Septempber 30th at 8 am, Mark forgets that i even made the appointment with him (or didnt bother to make a note of it) saying, \""oh, I thought you were supposed to bring this by yesterday\"". He says I should expect this to probably be done before 3pm. \n\nI soon recieve a call from Mark at 10:25am, where he tells me the charge will actually be $240 (for four hours of labor + $13 worth of materials, before even getting started to see how long the job would actually take) and that the car would be ready by 3pm, if not possibly before that. Also for good measure he decides to randomly throw in, \""oh, and we don't take checks\"". \n\nThe next phone call is at 3:50pm to ask if i actually need to have the car back today, I tell Mark, \""yes, of course\"". (I was expecting to be ready by 3, if not before like he said) When I express that I definitely need it today, he says that he just has to finish this one side and it will be ready by 415. This leaves me with barely enough time to get a bus and get over there before they close at 430. Honestly if what he had to finish on my car could easily be completed between 3:50 and 4:15, i dont think he would bother asking if i still needed to have it that day. As a result I feel that he may have rushed something while putting my car back together, because now something feels slightly off with the feeling of how the cars is aligned or the way the car drifts at times.",2
164,"Typical, but new.  \n\nYou see all of the people that are walking in and out and, I must say, the customers look like they work for a living hear.  I swear one of the guys was covered head to toe in soot.  That is amazing.  \n\nRan around the store looking for those few items that I needed to satisfy my need to build and create.  Minimal help from the small quantities of employees, but some of them actually asked if I needed help -- after I had found the item.",3
165,"When making a Customer's paymento atLowe's, we have our checklist:\n\n1. Do the phone numbers match?  Nope, but that's fine since people are always changing their phone numbers anyways.\n2.

Why should it, those computers are always making mistakes.\n\nNow that we have verified that all the information is correct, we can process the payment.

167,Your typical area big box hardware store.  It's convenient to go to because of the proximity to other stores and how close it is to so many communities.\n\nCan't really say much else about this place other than with the self checkout lanes it's a breeze to run in and then out without having to deal with a single associate.,3
168,"This local Lowe's serves its purpose for my husband and me -- a convenient home improvement store that we run into every month or two. I am most impressed by the lawn and garden section of the store. I am not sure how it compares to other Lowe's stores, but when shopping at the Home Depot in North Fayette last fall, their flower selection was dismal compared to this Lowe's.",3
169,"Waterfront Lowe's beats Monroeville Lowe's for lawn and garden.  Hate to admit it, but it's true.",4
170,"The food here can actually be a little hit and miss, but I love the grilled cheese club with fries. I get it way too much. People make fun of me.\n\nThey have a ten dollar minimum for credit cards, fyi.",5
171,This place is overrated. A friend and I were looking forward to a beer and some good bar food- instead the wings were terrible and the beer was good but overpriced. There's nothing wrong with this place I just don't understand the clout around it. There should be no clout.,2
172,"There's lots of potential here because of the wonderful character and ambiance of this place, but the food was average at best.  We were there on a Pens Playoff night and there were 2 people working all the tables in both rooms.  Our food came to us cold and unimpressive at that.  Our orders were somewhat mixed up.  The potato skins used a really cheap artificial cheese that was not very appealing.  I tasted a slice of pizza, which is definitely the best thing they offer.  The crust was delicious and homemade.  If you are going to order something, I would go with the pizza.  We also ordered the chicken wings which were pretty good, also.  If you are looking for good food, Homestead better choices at Blue Dust or Tin Front.",2
173,"Before today I probably would have given this place three stars based mostly on their beer selection; however, today the service was terrible. We waited two hours for a pizza sub, French onion soup, fries, and buffalo chicken tenders. About an hour and a half in we finally got the small pizza sub and the wrongly made buffalo chicken tenders (ie, no hot sauce). We were told by the waitress that she realized it was wrong, but decided to still bring it out to see if my gf would eat it. She sent it back. By a half hour later, we still had not received the buffalo chicken tenders, nor the French onion soup (which should have been mostly made already), and no fries.  We were told the chef was new, but no effort was made really to make the situation better. No quick and easy app or beers on the house. To boot, the beer was pretty expensive. I will probably give the place another chance based on their beer selection, but it won't be for a while. The food has always been average at best, and the pizza sub was no different. We ended up leaving after two hours without receiving 75% of our order.",1
174,"I'm reading on here that the food is really hit or miss. I've only gone to Duke's one time, but the food was good. It wasn't too busy so our service was very attentive and it didn't take long to get our food at all.\n\nThe place is separated between a bar area and a more family style dining area. We sat in the dining area because the bar area was pretty full. The dining room area definitely fills up with an older, have lived in Pittsburgh all their lives crowd, while the younger crowd is in the bar area. \n\nI'll definitely be back since I live in the area.",3
175,"I've been to Duke's three times now. When I first came to PGH, a lot of locals were telling me that this was a good place to catch a game, drink some brews and get great food. Most of that is true, but the bad has mostly outweighed the good.\n\nThey have an excellent new tap system. Last time I went, they had Thirsty Dog Leghumpper on draft, and it was perfect. The system really elevates already awesome beer. Plus, the selection is awesome. \n\nIt is a sports-themed bar, so you can expect drunk locals, loud TV's and plenty of yelling. I'm sort of into that, so it doesn't bother me, although I do think their staff is not well equipped enough to work among the chaos. Service is often slow, and they give the waitresses ZERO training in the beers that they offer. This is not a good place for trying something new, as they can't tell you a thing about it. \n\nThe biggest downfall of Duke's, though, is the food. I've had three different, but equally simple, dishes there; A Burger, a Cheesesteak and Chicken Tenders. The first was flavorless and cold. The second was passable, but nothing special. And the last were absolutely awful. Honestly, the batter and size of the chicken made me so ill, I had to call it an early night. I ate two of the 7 tenders (SEVEN!) and had to quit. \nTheir fries are very good. And so are the wings.\n\nI'd say Duke's is a good place to drink, but that's about it.",2
176,"D&B is nice once in a while but the food is insanely unhealthy. They are also really clever about designing the psychological context in ways to extract money from their customers. You feel a bit milked afterwards. Also much fatter.\n\nYou pay for games using credits from mag-stripe cards. This lets D&B give their games arbitrary prices and makes it harder for you to really know how much you are spending. Menus for drinks and food have no prices. $6.05 for a Banana Split cocktail? $3.40 for a Michelob?  I have no idea whether that is expensive but not showing the prices is clever because they can price their things and not have to obey pricing psychology (like anchors and so forth).\n\nWaitstaff hassle you repeatedly to order desserts. Oh, and the dining room has plastic demos dessert trays to get that thought going in your mind as you walk to your table.\n\nThe games are all violent shooters or racing games don't appear to have changed much since 2002 when I last went to D&B in California. Hope they can find more innovative arcade games in the future.\n\nNot a pleasant experience, but at least it's different from going to an ordinary restaurant.",2
177,"This was actually the first time I've ever been to a Dave and Buster's.\n\nWalking into such a huge space, especially coming from the often narrow venues in San Francisco was strange.\n\nUn-nerving actually. \n\nBecause Dave and Buster's is all about excess. Almost obscenely so.\n\nAs far as food - their stuff is standard. Most of it is fried and as another reviewer pointed out - not very healthy. At all actually. You have to really scour the menu to find some somewhat decent viable and nutritious options.\n\nBut most people don't come to Dave & Buster's for food. They come for the games.\n\nAnd while I've never been that into video games or arcade games - my brother and sister always have.  I was apprehensive about having a good time here  - but after awhile - my siblings' enthusiasm about the place became contagious and I found myself really enjoying myself.\n\nEspecially once i realized that I have mad skills at Skee Ball. And proceeded to dominate.\n\nTrust.",3
178,"I love the games here but can't go very often since they don't rotate new games in very often.

179,"Dave and Buster's is an enigma, is it dining, a bar, or  playground for video game lovers? Let me get the bar part out of the way first, it's overpriced, and they try to get you to buy a glass to jack up your bill. \n\nNext, the food. Just like all the chain places at the Waterfront, there are sandwiches, burgers (yes they have a blue cheese burger, who doesn't?) pasta, salads, chicken fingers, yadda yadda. \n\nThe games, I swear over three quarters of the games have been there since 2000 when the place opened. I guess in ten years no new games have hit the scene.\n\nOverall Dave and buster's is unique to the Waterfront, but it's time to update the menu, update the games, and get into the second decade of the 21st century.",2
180,"The food was absolutely gross! I ordered a turkey club which comes on a wheat bun with avocado, bacon, and turkey breast. What I got was TOTALLY different from the picture! First of all the sandwich was on sliced bread (lame)! There was no avocado, 1 slice of bacon, no lettuce, and to TOP it off instead of turkey breast they used freaking LUNCH MEAT! lol No, not the kind that you get from the deli, the other sweaty nasty looking stuff! Gross! \n\nOur waitress was awful but they were extremely understaffed so I would have a bit of an attitude if I had to wait 10 tables without assistance too.   \n\nThe manager was really nice...

183,"When did Dave and Buster's become a daycare?? Everywhere you look, there are signs that say kids must be accompanied by an adult, but apparently no one was honoring that at 6PM on a Saturday. I couldn't even walk through the place without someone shoving me. AHHH!\nI get that Dave and Buster's is an arcade and that you're going there to play some games, maybe eat, and kill some time. When I last went there a few years ago, we there for my bachelor party, and while I'm sure we got into some shenanigans, I don't remember children running wild there. We were having adult beverages, playing games, and having a good time. This time, it was ridiculous. It isn't Chuck E. Cheese, yet that's how parents seem to be treating the place.\nOn top of that, the customer service sucked. The place is gigantic, with tables and serving areas everywhere, yet on a Saturday at 6PM, the hostess told us (after interrupting us three times to chat with the other hostess) told us it would be a three hour wait, despite the fact that there were empty tables all over the dining room. I suspect this is a ploy to get you to play games and spend money until you're table is ready, but the food at Dave and Buster's is not worth a three hour wait on any day.\nThe hostess told us we could be served right away if we went to the midway and found an empty table, so we attempted that. Most of those tables were empty with usually one or two adults at a giant empty table filled with coats who informed us that they needed the table because their kids would be back soon after playing games. Next, i engaged in the most rudest thing I've ever done- I began stalking tables where people were finishing up. I would walk up to people paying their check, ask if I could have their table when they were done, and they would inform me that there were already two or three people who asked them and I should get in line.\nFinally, we found a table and proceeded to spend two hours eating dinner. It wasn't because we ordered a lot of food- it was that the waiter took forever to bring our food out. He seemed to have no problem getting us fresh drinks, until we drank as much as we could and then asked for water. After that, he seemed to come around a lot less. \nI had the build your own chicken tacos, which comes on a giant plate with all kinds of fixings. The fixings were fresh, but the chicken was cold and dry, and the tortillas were dried out as well. For $14, it wasn't worth it. \nAfter dinner we proceeded to play games, which entails shoving people to get through areas and waiting in line to play anything. \nAll in all, I didn't like my experience at Dave and Busters. I remembered it being a fun place to go and unwind as an adult. but between all the kids and the crappy service, can't recommend this place. If anyone asks me to go back, I may elect to stay home and poke my eyes with a fork.",2
184,"Dave and Buster's has to be split up into separate experiences to rate it. \n\nDining: 2 stars\n\nI had a party of 20 coming in; I had called ahead of time, and arrived early. They immediately set up the table while about 4 of my friends and I waited; the hostess, after taking my name, never spoke to us again. She did not tell us when we could sit, how long it would be, or any other information. And then they made us wait for 75% of our party to show up before they would seat us. Mind you, there was no one else waiting, and the table was ready, and we were ready to order. But they didn't tell us this; I didn't even know why we were being forced to wait until I heard a supervisor whispering to the waitress about making us wait. I still have no idea why we were forced to wait. \n\nWhen my full party was finally seated, we were helped by two waiters who were perfectly polite and nice. BUT, our service was rather haphazard. People would order drinks and food, and get things at wildly different times. One person was done eating appetizers and drinks when another was just getting their first drink. I know there was chaos to a big party, but it got a little out of hand.\n\nThe food is pretty standard American chain food, comparable to Appleby's and Chili's - not offensive, but nothing to knock your socks off. It has a decent selection, and a few good desserts and appetizers, and everything was competently prepared. Overall, it is a fine enough meal for a large group before going to enjoy the arcade at fairly reasonable prices, but some of the service standards are poor. In the future we will probably eat at one of the other restaurants in the area and then move over to D&B's for games.\n\nBar: 1 Star\n\nDrinks are predictably expensive, but there is a wide variety. The problem is that about half of them don't even kind of resemble what is on the menu, and most don't have enough alcohol to even taste. Worse yet, while you can get a drink at the bar in the arcade, the staff is either completely non-interactive or just rude. You have to track them down, and then have a minimum of interaction before they stomp off like you ruined their life.\n\nArcade: 4 Stars\n\nThere are a lot of great games here to play, and many that are fun with groups or pairs. It is a great place for a large party, because you can mingle with all your friends playing many different very fun games. If you are a couple, there are also many great selections that everyone enjoys. The staff on the floor is helpful and fast to fix games that have problems, and are typically polite. The ticket prizes are cheap as expected, but kind of fun, and the people in the ticket shop were always nice and quick to help.\n\n\nOverall: 3 Stars\n\nIf you want to hang out here, I would suggest eating somewhere else, and then playing games and having fun here, but only order beer at the bar and don't expect a smile.",3
185,"Chuckie Cheese for grown ups...Yeah, that could sum up my review for sure (but I'll try to make it a bit more interesting than that).\n\nFirst let me say that this isn't my first trip to a Dave & Buster's.  Second, I actually experience all of it while here.  We will start with the food/service.  Staff, you were wonderful.  You were polite, you greeted us as soon as we walked in the door, gave us no qualms while ordering and were swift with your delivery.  Food, you were not wonderful.  I ordered the BBQ chicken breasts.  This came with a side of broccoli and their type of mashed potatoes.  The chicken was a bit dry and in some places you can tell it was left on the grill a little too long.  There were actually some bites that all I could taste was charred meat.  There wasn't enough BBQ sauce on the the chicken either.  The broccoli appeared to have been cooked prior and then thrown back into a pan to be seared.  Some of my broccoli actually had some burnt crisp areas on it.  Also I noticed that there were still some leaves left on the broccoli.  The mashed potatoes I wanted to like (which I hoped would be the best part of the dish, I'm a bit of a potato freak), but alas, I was let down. *sad face* They were cold and such a tiny portion.  With a tiny amount of shredded cheese and bacon but into that divot they made with the scoop to get it out of it's container.  Oh food, how if I didn't need you to survive, I wouldn't complain about you.\n\nThe building right now is in disarray.  They are in the midst of a remodel with lovely plastic curtains covering up certain sections of their dining area.  No bar out in the dining area right now and the pool tables were absent as well.  If you wanted a drink you had to go back into the game room.\n\nSpeaking of the game room, by far the best part.  With the meal I ordered I got the $20 play card (the best part of the meal, super charge it for $3 more and it's even better).  The game room  you can tell is in need of an update.  The carpet is worn and other signs of wear are noticeable as well.  One good thing is the games.  They change them up so often that there is always something new once you return.  Who knew that playing Connect 4 could be so fun, or for that matter Skee Ball rises to the top of my list to play.\n\nI will return again, but only after I eat elsewhere first.",3
186,Mediocre service. COLD food! Our food waited so long the lettuce & pickles wilted. Bland food. Crazy overpriced. Long waits in the arcade. 1 beer per hour maximum.  Avoid at all costs. Fair manager.,1
187,"Not being from the area, I traveled an hour to come here from Uniontown, PA. I was excited! I haven't been to this Dave and Buster's since I was younger and was ready to go back and play me some games! I went with my cousins, mind you, we hadn't ate all day and were very hungry. So, we decided to do the Eat & Play Combo, naturally. Here's where it gets bad. First of all, we get a very snobby hostess that shows us to our table. Then, we wait...and wait...and finally after about 25 mins we get a waitress. Her name was Ashley. We had plenty of time to decide what we wanted, so we quickly put our order in. Next, we were sitting and talking, waiting, we had empty glasses and our waitress had never even come around to see if we needed refills except for one time. She said she'd come back right away with our refills...yea, right. 20 mins later we get our refills. Mind you, our food still hasn't came yet. I see other people getting their food that had come in after us. I was frustrated. After waiting 45 mins for our food, I asked to speak with a manager. One of the servers who I asked replied rudely with \""Well, he's really busy right now. I doubt he'll be able to come out and talk to you\"". Finally, 15 mins later...that's one hour, folks. We get our food. What do you think the next problem was? Yep, the food was cold. I was completely fed up at this point, and told my waitress how disappointed I was, especially after driving one hour just to have this terrible service. The manager never came to speak with me, and we didn't even receive our meals for free. The only compensation we got were $10 game cards. Woopty-doo. The only thing good about this place is the games, but the prizes you get for your tickets are all junk and worthless. So, in conclusion...I DO NOT RECOMMEND THE WATERFRONT DAVE AND BUSTERS OF HOMESTEAD, PA. It was horrible, and I will not be returning for a very long time!",2
188,This place just plain sucks\nBad management lost them biz\nDumb arcade drama*\n\n* they have recently changed their under 21 policy so no one underage can even be in the arcade or restaurant after 10pm despite having a guardian over 30 years old,1
189,i had fun here.. fun big kid games for me!!!\nO.. But the bartender Melissa was a SUPER bitch and RUDE \nHope they fire her..,3
190,"DAVE & BUSTERS!  It's a nice place to eat, have fun and drink!!  All ages can enjoy this place.  I was so EXCITED to hear them announce that after 10p, all children whether accompanied by a guardian or not had to go!  It made for a nice evening for adults only.  \n\nEverytime we go whether we play or not we enjoy ourselves.  I didn't give it FOUR STARS because every time I've went I haven't been able to eat in the restaurant area of there.  I know I still get the same food that everyone else does wherever you sit.  Sometimes, I like the nice relaxing atmosphere of the restaurant.  I haven't as of yet, been seated there.  \n\nNot to mention that the servers around the bar, are a little slow at responding to customers as well.  So all in all, D&B's is a good spot to stop at for food and entertainment.  Just don't expect to be seated in the restaurant portion, and expect to wait awhile for food service in the bar area.",3
191,"A fun place and lots to do but a bit pricy. $20.00 will buy you a hundred points which will last you a little over an hour.I recommend the bowling game ,ball racing car game and connect 4 also there are several games that can be played in groups of 4",3
192,"Visited the Dave and Busters in Homestead, PA last night. Waitress mixed up our credit cards and gave my brothers credit card to someone else and he theirs. Charged them already too - both incorrectly My brother had to walk around and find out who it was. Waitress never apologized. GM was extremely rude and refused to give my brother his original receipt back saying they had thrown it out. DID NOTHING TO REMEDY the situation and ignored us the rest of our visit - not even a refill. After spending over $300 plus games, we will never go back. Whatever happened to the customer is always right? HORRIBLE service",1
193,"My boyfriend and I are in our 20s, and have visited this D&B multiple times. After our visit yesterday, however, I don't think we'll be back. When we arrived we were greeted by a long line of people waiting to buy game cards. At first there were 2 extremely slow workers trying to do this, then one left while the line was still out the door! The girl that was left was more than incompetent, and was taking extremely long to fill these game cards. We stood in line for over 20 minutes before being told that there was another attendant in the actual game room. Needless to say, the line in the game room was just as long, and they still only had one girl in the booth. It was a Saturday! After we finally got our cards we had to wait yet again to get a beer. 2 bartenders on staff while the bar was completely full. It took us almost an hour before we actually could start gaming. The floors were filthy with trash, and the bathrooms: repulsive! I had to use the restrooms twice during our visit, and not only did both bathrooms I used have no toilet paper in them, but there was TP all over the floors, and the sinks were less than cleanly. My boyfriend mentioned that the guys restroom was no better, as it smelled like pee and the paper towel dispenser didn't work. All I have to say is get your crap together. We could see a difference in the type of crowed that was there on Saturday compared to what it used to be, and I'm I have no doubt it's due to the poor service and attention to cleanliness. For how expensive they are they need to staff better on weekends. It's a shame how quickly this place has gone down hill and we will NOT be returning anytime soon!",2
194,"Most of the games were out of order and I had to find one of those referee looking people to fix 2 of them that took some of our credits.  Apathetic service staff all around, the Peanut and I were really disappointed.  Won't be back.",1
195,"ehh, 3.5 -- I can't rate it super low because i do smile a lot during my visits. Speaking of that, I've been here a few times, but never wrote a review for D&B. \n\nI'm a kid at heart and honestly do enjoy the games. However, there have been multiple instances where I swiped my game card & it took my credits, but no game began. There have also been times that I won and no tickets were released. I guess nothing is perfect but it does happen atleast once a visit (each scenerio)  It's hard to find a worker walking around and for half-price games, you kind of just take your loss with the 1.3 credits for skee ball (hmph!)\n\nThe food- it really isnt anything too fancy. I've had okay food, but super long wait times for a simple chicken fingers & fries for example. It's your basic sandwiches, salads, appetizers & a few pastas. I believe all sandwiches & burgers are around $10 & served with fries.  You can get the Eat & Play deal which includes food from a specific menu + a game card. Besides the game card deal, if you wanted to make D&B a date night you might be better off heading to another place to eat in Waterfront for amazing food.. but to each their own.  Try it once I suppose. The brownie sundae that i devoured last night was satisfying (2 brownies, 2 scoops of ice cream.. one with chocolate syrup; the other with raspberry sauce & fresh strawberries. Oh & whip cream)\n\nDrinks- pretty weak. We ordered 2 liquid maryjanes (2 each that is) which are filled with multiple shots of alchy & didn't really catch a buzz. Oh welllll. They do have a happy hour from 5-7pm. I'd go during that time for the best deal. I believe cocktails are half off & $3 off  bottles of wine. I've never seen anyone walking around with a wine glass though lol. \n\nThe prizes- as others have noted, the prizes are a little cheap for the amount of tickets they \""cost\"" However, it's cool to leave with a D&B coffee mug, cup or shot glass. Last night for 2500 tickets we decided on magnetic-style dart board (1,300?) a coffee mug, a D&B glass (our plastic one bit the dust) & a D&B coffee travel mug.. I might be missing a few odds & ends.\n\nOverall it's a fun time but can be pricey. It's best to head here Wednesday for half price games or get the Eat & Play deal while dining. \n\nI can't lie though, I find myself smiling ear to ear a few times within those 3 hours (woah, seemed longer than amount of time :D ) Speaking of which, in that time-frame we played 250 credits (cost= $40) but it was half-price games.",3
196,"Ok! Let me tell you about my bad experience first. I went to D&B last night for a post wedding party - which, side note, is a great idea!\n\nIt was around midnight and the bar wasn't really populated. There were three bartenders and only one was actually making rounds to see if anyone needed anything. The two other bartenders were chatting on the far side of the bar that no one was sitting at. Kind of counter productive if you ask me. \n\nI stood there for about 5 minutes, which for a busy bar is fine but when I am the only one with my card out then, it just seems a little ridiculous. I made eye contact with the one girl twice and gave her a smile and she literally turned away. I finally had to walk to them to get their attention.  I was standing right in front of them smiling and they didn't ask if i need anything. I finally said, \""Are you working?\"" and they gave each other a weird look. I felt like i was the crazy one. I asked for a beer/got the beer.\n\nIn between that time, the other bartender brought food over and set it down. She took a fry from the plate (right in front of me) and then served it to someone on the other side of the bar. What the hell! I felt like i was in some grimy bar in out in the sticks - not an established D&B. \n\nI was just really turned off from that experience. \n\nThe good is that D&B provides a different type of entertainment when you want to mix things up. I remember going here with my grandparents when I was a kid and it was the best treat ever! We would eat at the restaurant and then spend hours playing games. This place holds some really good memories for me. \n\nIt's a shame that my experience last night has spoiled the high standards I held for it.",2
197,"I used to love D&B when it first opened in the Waterfront, but it has gone down hill over the years. The games are not as fun and do not give you as many tickets and the prizes have gotten cheaper in quality. It takes a whole heck of a lot of tickets for you to even get a pencil! The atmosphere is okay but it used to be so much better with the funnest games and diverse groups of people! Now, it is run down and many of the games are app related games (Fruit Ninja) and 3D Experience rides. With such \""games\"", you can't even earn tickets and they take a lot of tokens! Last time I went, back in the winter, many of the games were broken, which made for a negative player experience. I would go to D&B to play some games again in the future, but it is no longer one of my favorite places to go due to the decline of fun games where you can earn tickets.",2
198,"I was here on 10/3 and I have to say this was a horrible experience.  Me and a friend went here to eat and play a couple games afterwards.  It took the waitress at least 10-15 minutes to greet us and by that time we knew we should just order then because we might not see her again.  We ordered and got our drinks and well let's just say we didn't see the waitress again until she was giving us our check (some manager delivered the food to the table).  No refill on my beverage, no how is your food, no ketchup for my burger or fries was offered.  Lots of people running around like crazy and if your understaffed hire more people!  I will not be back again to eat.",1
199,"I'll have a biased opinion of any place like this. What could be wrong with playing old and new school games, drinking, and eating all at the same place? The one thing I can think of is the price. On the surface, this is a pretty expensive place; however, they give a bunch of good deals depending on the time you go, whether or not you \""donate\"" money to the Make-a-Wish Foundation, and if you're lucky when you take a spin on the wheel of prizes! But honestly, know what the deals are before you go to make sure to get the best price available. \nIn regards to the games, there's a plethora for your enjoyment. Although it is nice to play games that spit out tickets, the last couple of times I've gone I've gotten 2 hours of arcade games for a very cheap price (Mario Kart, anyone?!). Either way, it's a really fun place that you'll most certainly have a good time at.",4
200,"First off, let me say that I find the people who usually work at Dave and busters usually don't care or seem to be angry and hate their job. A friend and I went here and found that a couple of the machines ran out tickets and someone was always there and happy to help. The staff went out of their way to make sure we had a good time. The manager Tony was very sweet and made sure everything was ok. Every staff member we talked to was extremely nice. This is by far the best Dave and busters I've had been to!",5
201,"My sister and law wanted to go here for lunch so all the kids could play games after we all had some lunch together. This place is huge and was moderately clean except the bathrooms. All of the food looked great on the 16 page menu. When our food came though, everything was below average. They have a huge selection of games for the kids to play, but you pay dearly to play games here. The food is  overpriced and the drinks are drastically overpriced.",2
202,"Rock Bottom Brewery in Homestead is always a good time.  They brew their own semi-micro brew here and generally have as many as eight brews to chose from.  Saturday night C and I stopped by to have a little dinner and enjoy some of their frosty beverages.  \n\nOur first issue of the night was getting to Rock Bottom.  As the restaurant is located in Homestead, a trip across the Hi Level Bridge was in order.  Little did we realize that the bridge was under construction and it took nearly 40 minutes to get across it.  Upon arriving at the restaurant we were presented with the task of finding a place to park which proved to be a daunting task.  This place was absolutely packed due to several locations sharing a parking lot.  After we got inside, our wait was about 45 minutes but luckily we were able to find a seat inside the packed bar while we waited.\n\nThe food at Rock Bottom is quite tasty, but it is all pretty standard bar fare with the nachos and burgers leading their menu.  They also have entrees such as steaks, but this place is not exactly known for their high class food products.  I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food and we quickly determined that this would not be your average plate of nachos in a bar.\n\nOur order consisted of a plethora of items from their appetizer menu including Chicken Nachos, Quesadillas and Ball Park Pretzels.  We had planned on splitting a meal for dinner, but by the time the appetizers arrived, we knew we had way too much food in front of us. \n\nThe nachos were on a gigantic plate and piled high with cheese, sour cream, guacamole and shredded chicken.  Containing just the right amount of jalapenos they had a nice little kick as well.  In much the same way, the quesadilla was much more than an appetizer portion.  With shredded meats and cheeses overflowing from the tortilla, there was enough food here for a two person entree.  The Ball Park Pretzels are the reason we come to this place.  They are always so light and soft with just the right amount of salt.\n\nAs far as the beers are concerned, I ordered up the sampler so that I could get a taste of the various brews.  They make a wide assortment of brews, from the Bud Lightesque \""Lumpy Dog\"" to a dark \""Brew masters Choice.\""  I found many of the beers to be quite tasty, however, nothing exactly special about them.  I would be that a taste test would find one hard pressed to chose the Rock Bottom brew over any off the shelf six pack.  Don't get me wrong - still excellent brews, but I would expect more from a place that claims to be a brewery.\n\nI give it 3 out of 5 Rinsem's due to the lack of originality in the brews and the amount of traffic involved with getting in and out of the place.",3
203,"Horrible beer, horrible service, horrible menu",1
204,"SUMMARY:\nIf I was in the area and no one had a better suggestion for where to go, I might come back for beer and appetizers.\n\nGOOD:\n- Decent beer...\n- Original pretzel appetizer.  You take chunks of soft pretzel and dunk it in spinach cheese dip.\n- Huge portions.  Most of us had leftovers.  The RB Appetizer Sampler was multi-story and way more food that we could handle.  The half order of ribs looked like a full rack.\n- Attentive service with quick seating and frequent drink/water refills.\n- Amusing name.\n\nBAD:\n- Lots of food choices... burgers... steak... chicken... salads.  Lots of drink choices... beers... wines... mixed drinks.  I guess this could be seen as good, but it takes a while for everyone to pick something and since no one's awesome at everything, you could tell right away that nothing distinguishes this place.\n- None of the food was super awesome.  Nothing was awful, but nothing stood out in any way.  I've had better beer, appetizers, and a better main course at plenty of breweries.\n- Kind of dead on a Monday night with 3/4 of the place empty.\n\nCome if you want bar food, but keep your expectations low.",2
205,"Not the greatest ale house in the city but certainly not the worst.\n\nI like the food and I have tried all the beers.  They're just \""OK\"" as far as beer goes.\n\nLarge portions. Friendly staff.",3
206,My friends got everyhing from steak(they didn't even get a well done steak right) to mahi tacos and the only great menu item was the seasoned vegetables- give it a miss. Sing sing next door is awesome but get dinner somewere else. After we were done the waiter asked if we were ready for the checks and I had ordered meal that came with a desert! Really dissapointing all around.,1
207,"Little slow on the service and didn't have the beer I wanted on the menu. But you get those things when they brew their own beers on-site.   But the stadium pretzels are good.  The cream stout is tasty.\n\nThe burgers are good and big with the little skinny fries.  I'm not a fan of the skinny fry, but hey the burgers would choke a horse - and almost did.  :o)",3
208,"Lately, the Rock Bottom is hit or miss. The beers are always good and the Uppity Jagoff IPA is one of the best India Pale Ales I've ever tasted. The low point lately has been the food. I will never forgive the idiot in management who took the chicken quesadilla off the menu. That said, I ordered the lobster roll and when it arrived, the bread was as hard as a brick and cold. The filling was okay, but the lobster flavor was masked by over spicing. I suggest you eat somewhere else and imbibe at the Rock Bottom.",2
209,"Went with a group after work for dinner and a brew.  We ordered a few appetizers first.  The wings are good and the soft pretzels with spicy spinach cheese dip was fun.  Had a burger, you can create your own from veggie, turkey, or fresh ground beef. Had a fresh ground beef and the meat was fresh and cooked perfectly with a fresh bun.\n\nThe brew pub is nice and was surprised it wasn't busier.",3
210,"Beer selection was good, but they were out of the ones we wanted. 4 of the 6 people in our group ordered steaks all of them were cooked to their satisfaction. The bourbanzola was a good addition. Defiantly a place I would go again. Joe, our server, was awesome and super friendly.",4
211,"I always feel like I am constantly bashing breweries for their food, but in my opinion, I feel the bar is raised for places like this. It seems there are so many breweries out there that offer great beer, and slack off on the food. Unfortunately Rock Bottom is one that falls into that category. Let's be honest, when you go to a brewery, you want the full experience. If it was only about the beer, I'd go buy a growler and take it home. \n\nSo, about the beer....EXCELLENT!!!!! The Jagoff IPA is with out a doubt one of the best IPAs I have ever had! They only I can think of that I think is better is Dogfish Head, but that's a matter of opinion. The beer selection is constantly changing, and they always have some excellent seasonal beers. You can't go wrong, there's bound to be a beer everyone will like. \n\nAs for the food.......it's pretty much a crap shoot. Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's terrible. My biggest problem is there is absolutely no consistency when it comes to the food. One time it's perfect, then maybe it's cold, or it's burned, or it tastes completely different from the last time you had it. Unfortunately, it seems there is zero attention to food quality. \n\nThat's pretty much it. This place fixes it's food consistency, and it's a five star place. Till then, it's hit or miss!",2
212,"I was SO ready to like this place!  Turns out, not so much.  It was okay.  No better than TGIFridays, but better than Eat n Park!  The deets.\n\nThe hubster and I were here on a Saturday evening after a show at the Improv so we were happy and in a good mood and ready to enjoy some good eats.  We ordered drinks.  He a wheat beer of their brewing, me my fave Bloody Mary with Absolut Peppar.  The hubster deemed the beer acceptable, but wouldn't go out of his way to come back just for another one....yes, he DID order another one \""just to be sure.\""  My Bloody sucked.  Watered down tomato juice with no discernible Peppar of any kind, let alone any other seasonings.  Even a good standard mix would have been better.  Our very efficient and friendly waitress took it back and watched while it was remade by the other bartender.  Nope, no better at all.  That went back and I went with a you-can't-screw-it-up Amaretto sour.  It was fine.\n\nHub ordered a Reuben - why, I'll never know because they simply never measure up to the gold standard of what used to be at the long-lamented Gazebo in Shadyside.  You younguns wouldn't have a clue of the establishment of which I speak.  He said this one was \""fine.\""  I had the Texas Fire steak with jalapeno butter which I enjoyed very much!  Packed a punch of heat and flavor, but the sides were uninspired.  Steamed veggies.  Any flavor was steamed out in the process - eh.  Cheddar mashed potatoes - there was cheddar in there?????  No way!\n\nThe tab was reasonable - we DID have a Living Social deal that took $30 off, so our check was for $12 and change, not including tip.  Not bad (even with the $15 cost of the LS Deal), but had we paid full price, it wouldn't have been worth the experience.  We'll hit the Improv again - we have before - but, we'll head somewhere else afterwards.",3
213,"I must admit, I do like the brews.  I also like the white cheddar mash potatoes.  Other than that, meh.  The food is pretty forgettable.  Another \""brewery\"" that sadly fails to be anything special in the food department.  With the restaurants upping the ante on 8th Ave, you may want to kick it up a notch Rock Bottom.  But how would anyone know to?  It's a chain.  Whomp whomp!",2
214,For a brewery who is attempting to take advantage of Oktoberfest you wonder how at 7 pm they could be out of mashed potatoes & sauerkraut then a sausage platter with sweet mustard guess they have not been to Germany. Not worth $5.95 unfortunately the sausage platter was $15.95.,1
215,"Dined in twice, food ok, atmosphere good.",3
216,"I've always been pleasantly surprised with the food I've gotten at Rock Bottom.  I say \""surprised' because with any restaurant that falls into the slippery territory of a \""chain\"", you expect to find your fair share of culinary duds.  But I've really had a lot of good meals at Rock Bottom.  Now, granted, you do owe it to yourself when ordering to not forget where you are (a \""bar-straunt\"" if you will), and don't get anything above and beyond this place's call of duty.  For instance, I will never be ordering the ahi tuna.  I'll leave that to my favorite sushi bars and restaurants a bit closer to the water (the Mon doesn't count.....).\n\nBut besides that, I always really enjoy my meal choices.  I've recently gotten the chicken avocado sandwich.  Chicken was grilled perfectly, plenty of avocado, and it was a good sized sandwich without being excessive.  I've also ordered the Margherita pizza, which could definitely be split between two people.  It's an eight cut that comes to you on a big wooden pizza paddle.  The pizza was really great.  The crust was crispy, it had a good balance of cheese and tomatoes, and the basil pesto was fresh and tasty.  And not greasy whatsoever - BIG bonus points there.  But my biggest surprise as of late was when I ordered their chicken flautas.  I'm a HUGE Mexican food fan and always hesitate to order Mexican outside of a Mexican restaurant for fear of being disappointed.  But I had an insatiable craving one night and decided to go for it.  It was DELICIOUS.  The flautas are deep fried which gives you an amazing crunch, and they still managed to not dry out the inner ingredients.  The accompanying rice was nice and moist as well.  I was so happy!\n\nI've always been quite happy with the service there as well.  I go on Thursday evenings for trivia, and nine times out of ten the service is really spot on.  The ladies servicing the bar area are friendly and attentive.  Only once or twice, to my memory, has my service been sub-par, and that can usually be chalked up to an extremely packed Trivia Night with only two visible servers helping 50+ people.\n\nI definitely give Rock Bottom two thumbs up for taking your typical chain-found food and making it fresh, yummy, and worth coming back for more.",4
217,"I went to Rock Bottom this past weekend, and it was \""nice\"" to see that nothing has changed in the year or two since my last visit. While the beer is pretty good, it has never outweighed the fact that the service isn't good and the food is average, at best.\n\nIt was even difficult to get beers at the bar...we tried to have the girls order, thinking they'd have better luck...when that failed, the men tried...that didn't work either. If we hadn't REALLY wanted a cold beer after a comedy show at The Improv, we would've just left. It definitely wasn't busy enough to be noticed and ignored by the bartender, so I can't overlook it. Of course, the service has always been spotty at Rock Bottom, so it was hardly surprising.\n\nCombine the weak food and poor service with Rock Bottom being too far from home for a night out just to drink, and you get the exact formula that's kept me from going there in the past...and will keep me from going often in the future.",2
218,"The only reason Rock Bottom gets 3 stars is because of the brews. Food was \""eh\"", not many vegetarian options and hostesses who will ignore you because they are too busy chatting about who didn't text them back. This place has the potential to be great, but sadly, it falls way too short in almost all areas.",3
219,"Rock Bottom was our first stop on a 17 mile pub crawl.  As expected, the bar was lively, the food was good, and the service was accommodating,  The beers are better than Church Brew Works and the bar was populated.  The bartender readily offered a taste of beer and gave us a hat to wear for the rest of the crawl.  \nI vote for Rock Bottom as the anchor store of the Water Works.",4
220,"I haven't been to Rock Bottom in years.  Maybe even decades...is that even possible?  Well, either way, it's been awhile.  So with my gift certificate I took my brother out for a birthday dinner.  \n\nAs I get older, my tolerance for things like crowds and youngsters gets lower and lower.  As a result, I told my brother to be ready by 4pm so we could head to the Waterfront before everyone goes out for date night.  Plus the Pirates were playing at 4:05 so we could enjoy our beers and the game.\n\nWhen we arrived, the bar side was already pretty packed but we were still able to get a table.  Our server was very attentive, friendly and helpful.  Right off the bat we both ordered samplers so we could try all of their beers.  We loved the fact that as she approached our table with a full tray of samples our server said, \""I have to go back for the rest.\""  In all we were served 10 different beers each (in 3 oz glasses, maybe 4 - I can never tell).  I gotta say, Rock Bottom knows their beer.  I liked more than I didn't, and very few were not to my liking.  So the $6.95 10 beer sampler was well worth it.  \n\nDuring our sampling we indulged on some Southwest Egg Rolls.  They were okay, but not quite what I expected.  The spicy ranch was top notch, though.  As we ran out of beer, we each ordered up a Kobe Burger.  They were both cooked exactly to our liking (medium).  And to top off our wonderful evening, the Pirates brought home a win!\n\nMy only complaint, as a beer drinker, is the cost for a growler.  The glass container itself is sold for $12.95.  That's the empty price.  To me, that's a little ridiculous when East End only charges $3 for the bottle and Penn Brewery $5.  Paying more for the bottle than the beer inside seems like insanity to me.  So I walked out empty handed.    But it won't deter me from returning.",4
221,Slow service\nBelow average food \nIll pass,2
222,"Its not bad. I'm not into chain kind of places, but if you're with a group that doesn't do anything more adventurous, you'll do fine here. I vacillated between 2 and 3 stars but the house beer I had will make sure I come back from time to time.",3
223,"Went to Rock Bottom for lunch the other day and was very pleased. My coworker had printed out a coupon for a free mini appetizer. The waitress told us that they were not making mini appetizers and gave us a full sized chicken quesadilla. If you have ever had the southwestern egg rolls from Chili's - the filling tasted like that and I am a big fan! \n\nMondays are half off burger days and I tried the just hot enough burger - topped with crispy jalapenos, pepper jack cheese, pico de gallo and housemade habanero ketchup. It was delish! The ketchup was so good and the fries were extremely crispy. \n\nThe prices are a little steep for lunch but if you go on Monday, it's totally worth it. I think that the quality of food more than makes up for it but don't expect for pay under $10 for a sit down. \n\nI felt that the staff was very nice and the waitress was very attentive. The service was quick and I think you can get in and out in under an hour.",4
224,"Rock Bottom is a chain brew pub one that, in my opinion, is just \""OK\"".  The restaurant is rather large with lots of seating and a pool table. They have many of their own brews that you can sample but to tell you the truth none of them are that good. I have had several of their beers and all of them have been forgettable. \n\nTheir food is pretty much like their beers, forgettable. I have had one of their burgers and their pizza and they really weren't anything to write home about.\n\nI feel they will impress those who have never been to a brew pub but I would probably describe them as the Chili's of Brew Pubs. If you are in homestead and are looking for a burger and a beer it might be a good choice for a bite, or at least until the Burgatory opens!",2
225,"Went here last night to meet folks for a friend's birthday party. Docking one star due to a few unfortunate things that happened, otherwise I'd be fine giving this place a 3.\n\nOur waiter was very attentive and kept our water and soda cups refilled, the food was decent overall - I had a plain ol' burger and a delicious berry sangria - and the place overall had a nice vibe to it and was pretty comfortable and fun to be in...you'd think this would just be another average place not-great-but-not-bad and I'd be ready to go on to the next review right there.\n\nHere's where I ran into problems. I'd checked the website in advance to try and plan my meal since I do my best to pick items on menus that aren't, say, 2,000 calories in one sitting. Their website advertises that they make skinny drinks; when I asked my waiter he said it was possible but that they did not normally do this and that it's a hassle for the people at the bar, so he didn't recommend it. Then why tell us on your website that you'll do it??? \n\nAdditionally, while we had checked in advance when we made our reservation about bringing a birthday cake and the restaurant's ability to handle us lighting candles, apparently there was a break down in communication; we never got the candles we had asked for, and in fact the poor waiter struggled to even find a lighter before realizing there were no candles available. Obviously whatever error occurred wasn't the waiter's fault, and we definitely thanked him and tipped him well for doing the best that he could with what he had.\n \nOn a final note, this is also one of those places where if you ask for a medium rare burger, they will overcook it; I've started ordering medium rare on purpose specifically so that I get a medium cooked burger instead of medium well or well done.\n\nFinal verdict: go for the brews if you must, and the food's nice enough. I was admittedly left a little underwhelmed.",2
226,"Nothing special. Just like Applebee's, Chili's or Fridays. Stick to the bar food (burgers, sandwiches, pizza, wings and salads) and you will be okay. \n\nThis was our second attempt at trying Rock Bottom on Fathers Day. The first time almost ten years ago. We went in the early afternoon and they had already ran out of steaks. How do you do that on Fathers Day?! This time we went around 12 noon and beat the rush.\n\nMy wife got and loved the Berry Bash Sangria. She just said it had too much ice in it. Our daughter got the root beer float which she love and I started with a Mango Ice Tea, but later switched for a raspberry ice tea as the mango ice tea wasn't sweet enough.\n\nWe started off the the Kobe beef sliders as our app. It took at least 15 minutes to get them. You get three sliders and they were very good.\n\nMy wife got a small greenhouse salad with Jalapeno ranch dressing to start off with which she enjoyed and the lobster & shrimp enchiladas as her main entree. She complained about how salty it was and the fact that there was no lobster in it at all.\n\nOur daughter got the kids burger and fries. No surprise there.\n\nI ordered the New York Strip with mashed potatoes and it came with green bean as well. My strip was cooked perfectly and has a decent taste. Longhorn has a much, much better quality of steak though. The green beans were pretty good and my mashed potatoes very bland and pretty average. \n\nThe kitchen sounded like an live episode of Hell's Kitchen. The waiters were repeatedly asking for orders at least 5 to 6 times. The kitchen was backed up the whole time we were there.\n\nOn a different note, our waitress Susan was very good. Come here for drinks and the bar food. Skip everything else.",3
227,"I go to Rock Bottom pretty often for dinner or their awesome beer, so I was really really excited to have my bridal shower there.  My maid of honor reserved the banquet room which was very nice and separated from the rest of the restaurant.  My MOH and mother said that the person they talked to about reservations and arrangements was wonderful and easy to get in touch with.  My shower was wonderful, the wait staff was great and kept everyone's glasses full.  It started pouring down rain and they let us stay a little longer so my gifts wouldn't get wet when taking them out to the car.  The only reason this place gets 4 stars is because we were not allowed to take our leftover food from the buffet home.  There was salmon, chicken, potatoes, and mac and cheese left over and they told us we couldn't box it up.  Not sure why- they can't re-serve it!  It would have just gone to waste!\n\nAlso, not at all related to the shower, their trivia night is super fun!",4
228,"I rarely give a business a superior rating, but I have to say my wife and I had one of the best dining experiences at the Rock Bottom Brewery.   The food was delicious,  the beer, every recipe sampled,  was amazing and the service was wonderful.  The staff made us feel like we were the most important guests in the restaurant. \n\nPlease support this business.  I guarantee you will not be disappointed.",5
229,"I'm not much of a beer drinker, but my fiancee is a major enthusiast, so I agreed to tag along.  I'm glad I did!  Our waitress was very knowledgeable about the extensive house-brewed beer selection, and helped me to pick one I would love (the kolsch was very crisp, light, and drinkable.)  The food was standard pub fare with a twist, well-executed.  My burger was topped with onion petals and gorgonzola, and cooked to perfection.  The waitress recommended their macaroni and cheese for a side, which was definitely a good choice.  My only complaint is that most of the food was rather heavy, and I spent the rest of the night wallowing on the couch.  Not sure I would make the hour+ trip to Pittsburgh again, but if I found myself in the city, I may just stop by.",4
230,Came with my BF we started with the crab artichoke dip. It was very greasy and had virtually no crab. The wedge salad was good and crisp. I had the hazelnut crusted chicken. This has to be one of the worst dishes I've ever had it was like pancake syrup over breaded chicken. To finish the meal we had the homemade chocolate chip cookies served with hot fudge. Well there was no hot fudge it was chocolate syrup the ice cream was so crystallized from melting and re-freezing all around disappointing.,1
231,"Tom and I decided to try this place out before catching a late movie on a Saturday night. He is a beer buff, and neither of us had ever been there, so we gave it a go.\n\nWe walked in around 8pm and we were told that there would be an hour long wait. We put our names on the list and went shopping around the area. About 25 minutes later, our table was ready. Parking was a cluster since the lot is shared with Dave & Busters and a karaoke bar called Sing Sing. Tom dropped me off at the door so I could secure our table.\n\nOur server, Jackie, approached me almost immediately and brought two waters to the table to start. She was very attentive and funny, and probably the best part of our experience at the restaurant. Tom ordered a Red Ale and to his surprise, didn't care for it. Jackie gave Tom three free samples of beers she thought he would like after talking to him about his beer drinking habits. He loved all three, and chose the most bizarre (and expensive) beer. Jackie switched the Red Ale to the beer of Tom's choice, and charged us for the less expensive beer. Very nice of her!\n\nWe started out with the Ball Park Pretzels with Jalapeno dip. The pretzels came out quickly and they were very fresh, not to mention huge! We only ate one and took the other to go. Very good app though! \n\nTom ordered some sort of bacon cheeseburger, and I got the Chicken Fried Chicken, which was a pounded chicken breast, breaded and fried, over white cheddar mashed potatoes with a side of gravy and some apple coleslaw.  Tom's burger came with a small handful of fries, and my meal was very spread out on my plate, like something was missing. Not very good presentation at all. The food itself was okay, nothing to write home about. The potatoes were my favorite part. Tom said that his burger was mediocre.\n\nAnother note: The bathrooms are shared with the Sing Sing karaoke bar that is in the same building, so expect drunk singing women in the bathrooms and brides-to-be puking in the stall next to you after enjoying too much alcohol at their bachelorette party... Yuck.\n\nOverall, we might come back for the beer and service, but not for the food. And DEFINITELY not to use the bathroom...",3
232,I really miss the Northstar Amber but the specialty beers are always good.  Food is excellent and the service staff is friendly.,4
233,"So after an evening of enjoying a comedy show at the Waterfront, we headed to Rock Bottom for some late night grub.  The place was pretty busy, we had to walk around the bar area for several minutes until a nice couple told us they were about to leave and we could have their bar table.  As nice as this was of them it was awkward standing over them as they finished their drinks paid their bill and left.  \n\nSo finally seated I look over the drinks and being the huge IPA lover that I am I went with that and it was indeed a good choice.  The hubby had the Red Ale which was also rather good.\n\nThe service was OK, not the best not the worst.  But moving on to more important thing, the food.  Talk about missing the mark hugely!  I ordered the mini street fish tacos.  You get four mini tacos with a marinated in lime piece of fish, and tomatillo salsa.  They were just strokes away from inedible.  I love fish tacos, I mean it is such a simple concept so why do people have such a hard time executing this dish? The shells were hard and literally split at the bottom when I picked them up.  The sour cream sprayed all over the plate only made them messy and the poor fish was just so overcooked.  If I wasn't so hungry I wouldn't have eaten them at all! Lesson learn on that.\n\nThe husband had the BBQ Chicken Pizza.  It had beans and corn with roasted red pepper on it along with some sour cream.  My husband is usually the type that will order these lovely specialty pizza's and ask for them to remove all the wonderful unique toppings!  For instance, he would usually just say, Chicken BBQ and cheese, nothing else!  I refused to let him do that this time, because I was really intrigued in the combination of ingredients on this pie.  And boy was I jealous when it came out.  It blew my crappy tacos out of the water!  Should have stuck with something simple.  \n\nFurthermore I could care less if I come back to this location.  The beers were good but hell you can get a decent IPA just about anywhere anymore.  And the underwhelming food sealed the deal.  I know this is a chain, but it still doesn't have to stink...",2
234,Another good meal ... this time the Housemade Meatloaf. It's a blend of turkey and sausage instead of the standard ground beef. A refreshing and delicious twist on a comfort food staple. Served over cheddar mashed and mixed veggies. The server could have behaved like she wanted to be there but everyone has a bad day once in awhile. Service was prompt just the same. Overall good experience.,4
235,"Poor service and food. I waited 20 minutes at the bar for someone to just acknowledge my presence. They finally brought my food out and left it without asking for me to pay.... So I had to wait an additional 15 minutes to find someone to pay. Yes, I had to TRY and give them money.\n\nOn to the important part... Food was terrible. I had a burger and it was pathetic.",1
236,"Planned a surprise birthday party here for my wife and they did an amazing job helping to pull it off! Service was extremely helpful, professional, and on point all night. Lauren (one of the managers) was reliable and pleasant throughout the entire planning process. If anyone is looking to plan an event I would highly recommend Rock Bottom. Couldn't be happier!",5
237,"The staff here is very nice and the set up has TVs all around the family so enjoy mostly all sports, the music is nice and pretty mellow and the place is very spacey and the prices are pretty reasonable. And most importantly is the place seems to be kept clean at all times.",4
238,"Good food and large portions. I ordered the Veggie Burger for $8.50 and I loved it! It's one of the most unique veggie burgers I have ever had: a homemade patty of beans, rolled oats and veggies. The chipotle mayo really gave it that oomph. My burger was more than enough for me to handle and everything was worth the price. As for drinks, I'm a complete noob when it comes to beer but my friend ordered a tap and even from a small taste, I could tell it was very good quality beer. Bitter and sweet, with a slight tang. I rarely drink beer but i I'm going to, then might as well drink the best kind there is - fresh and microbrewed.\n\nNOTE: There aren't too many options for vegetarians. The veggie burger was pretty good and I'd recommend it, but other than that, there's also the veggie tacos, a few select appetizers, and a few salads from which to choose.",4
239,"The food is standard American fare--a bit overpriced in my mind--and the beers range from mediocre to very bad.  The K\u00f6lsch is the only decent beer of the bunch.  The service is good, but the wait for food or a table can be quite long (generally 20-30 minutes even for just beer and apps).  I've been to the one at the Denver airport as well, but I was stranded and had free meal tickets, so okay-but-nothing-special pizza from Rock Bottom it was.  Since it's a recognizable national chain, I think of places like this as more of a tourist brewery rather than a true Pittsburgh craft-brew experience.",2
240,"The beer is good but the food is nothing to brag about at ALL. I've tried many things on the menu, and if you have developed a \""foodie\"" palate, don't even bother, because you will be very disappointed. If you feel comfortable with chain restaurants and their lack of innovative touch (which, nothing wrong with that!) you will most likely enjoy Rockbottom. The only entree I did enjoy were the lobster and shrimp enchiladas (minus the repulsive beans and rice) and the asiago crab dip as an appetizer. Otherwise, you are better off skipping it.",2
241,"Be careful. The servers can't pay attention to save their lives, and the management cares even less. I want to make sure people know how careless the management is, particularly Mark who seems to let his staff run around.",1
242,"This is  a \""Okay\"" place to eat.  The food is nothing special.  I guess what they have going for them is the beer.  Order the  Guacamole for the starter which was okay but for $8.50 and the portion was not worth it.  Rice (Cajun Taco) was not cooked well.  Would I go there again \""maybe\"".  If your into beer and watching the game, then yeah go there.",3
243,"Good club for a good laugh. High food prices (most comedy clubs are), 2 item min. The food was less than stellar. I wouldve enjoyed Burger King more. \n\nService was decent, I believe the waiters/waitresses could hustle a little more or the club should hire more waiters/waitresses. I get grouchy when my glass is sitting empty for more than 2 mins.",3
244,"They have good acts coming around here, and often give out free tickets, particularly ine summer. I've never actually paid full price for a ticket here. \n\nThe two-item minimum is bit bothersome to me though...I don't mind the requirement so much, but the quality isn't good and the prices are high. Our four items total came to about $30 (two appetizers and two beers) and the apps were really nothing to write home about and the servers aren't even very friendly. Also beware...they have a lot of rules here. They won't seat till the whole party is there; if you get dinner reservations everyone in the party HAS to order dinner, automatic gratuity added to the check, etc. etc.\n\nThe \""box office\"" is also weird...you get your tickets at this window complete with microphone and slide-under slot...then you walk into the club and the box office is completely open and the workers are just sitting right there, so I don't get the whole hoopla with the window.\n\nAll in all though, the seats are comfy enough, the atmosphere is pretty nice, and the acts are good.",3
245,"Came here to see Charlie Murphy. \nParking was nightmare. I would expect nothing less on a Saturday night.\nThe 15 minute wait to get inside was torture. They need to implement a system where if you purchased tickets in advance you don't have to wait outside. Once inside you we were seated pretty quickly.\nSeating is first come first serve.\n\nThe Server was pretty quick to take our orders. I misread the menu description and didn't realize my BBQ sandwich came \nwith cheese.  I don't eat cheese, and had send my order back. The waiter was gracious and returned with my modified order in about 15 minutes. I've never heard of throwing cheese pulled pork sandwich, maybe it's a northern thing. \nWe got our checks quickly, and without issue.",3
246,"I'm HUGE SNL fan, so naturally if someone who's been in the cast is touring, I'll come here to see them. Some have been really great...Jim Breuer. Some have been (surprisingly) very bad....Tracy Morgan. But it's always been a pleasant experience at the venue.  There's not a bad seat in the house and it's small enough that you get to see and hear everything from the stage.  Beware if you sit in the very front, you KNOW what's going to happen!\n\nA couple downsides.... \n\nWaiting outside in a line in the dead of winter.  The lobby is so small you're forced to wait outside until the first show starts or the first show let's out.  And if you want a good seat, you may be waiting in line for a while.  BURR!\n\nThe two drink minimum. I kinda get why they do it, to make money, of course. But this means they jack up the prices of watered down drinks. Better to stick with beer and wine at these places. No frou frou drinks for me! \n\nAlso, as to be expected, the food's not that great. In a perfect foodie world, places that served food would make it fantastic! Since that's not going to happen, you just go into those places hoping for the best. I've never had anything great here. Nacho platter too many re fried beans, to little nacho's....annnnnd I'm out! \n\nSo what did we learn here? Good venue, stick to beer and wine and eat at a better restaurant beforehand. The talent is really what you're there for so, enjoy the show!",3
247,"I've been here twice now, and like the others you really only come to Improve Comedy Club for the show. Very reasonably priced for shows  though they have the two item minimum so would suggest they all be drinks.\n\nThe food leaves little to be desired. We decided for the sake of time to grab dinner at the venue since the show started at 7. Having a free appetizer coupon we ordered the spinach and artichoke dip along with the sauteed grilled chicken. Spinach and artichoke dip was good though cheesy rich along with cheese sprinkled on top of the chips. Sauteed grilled chicken - hmmm.... I think the chicken was frozen - definitely not fresh - and the guacamole was artificial with a glop of cheese. It looked like a mess with big ole pile of fries. A lot of food for $10. Service has always been pleasant though they do automatically tack on the tip for you at 18%.",3
248,"There's nothing like a Saturday night filled with some good laughs, a few chuckles and a couple of good guffaws thrown in for good measure.  That's exactly what we enjoyed on Saturday night!\n\nWe hit the comedy club for an evening of Tammy Pescatelli - the hubby and I have enjoyed her routine on TV and on the occasional DVE morning show..  She didn't fail to give us a good evening of laughs!  The big surprise, was Gene Collier - yep, of the Post-Gazette sports writer fame - as the opener.  What a great opening act!  He cracked wise about the perils of being 58 and a baby boomer.  We could relate!\n\nThe sightlines were lacking.  There was a rather large woman at the table in front of us with massive Pittsburgh BIG HAIR.  All night long my own head bobbed from side to side as I attempted to actually watch the show, and not just listen to it, as she reached repeatedly and unceasingly for her tableful of snacks.  \n\nWith a 2 drink minimum, my first drink was weak and the 2nd was quite strong!  All in all, the two balanced each other out.  But then, you don't go for the drinks, do you?  An enjoyable evening!",3
249,"My friends & I all purchased Groupons  for the Pittsburgh Improv on or around March 22nd, 2012. At that time, only a few big name comedians were listed on the Improv's website as Special Events. You can use the Groupon on anything that isn't a Special Event. That seemd reasonable. The day the Groupons were purchased, my friend Katrina called & reserved two tickets to Jim Jeffries for 3/30 at 10pm. They allowed her to use her Groupon & gave her a confirmation code & everything! Shortly after, they changed many of the comedians on their website, including Jim Jeffries, to Special Events. When I called I was told I could not use my Groupon. The same thing happened to many of my friends. It's a classic bait & switch. These comedians were NOT Special Events until after the Groupon came out. In addition, other restrictions, such not being able to use the Groupons on Saturdays & having to use the additional four vouchers for one show, were NOT listed under the restrictions when the Groupon was for sale. \n\nSo tonight, my friends & I had pretty much resolved ourselves to the fact that we were not going to the Improv because they wouldn't allow us to use our Groupons. But I walked over to the Will Call window with my friend Katrina so she could at least get her tickets. Big surprise - she was told they didn't have her reservation or her name in their computers! They wouldn't give her the tickets. It's an absolute joke of a deal. How is everyone going to use their Groupons by Sept. if all of the shows are Special Events now? \n\nIn addition, no one at the Improv answers the phones or responds to emails. \n\nMy friends & I (about 10 of us total) are all getting refunds through Groupon and/or our credit card companies & we are all reporting the Improv to the Better Business Bureau, etc. \n\nThe Pittsburgh Improv is extremely shady & does not care about their customers.",1
250,"The place does what it does best - Comedy.  The food, however.  Blah.\n\nFirst off, If you go to a show, please note there is a two item per person minimum.  This means that from their extensive menu of overpriced bar food and drinks, you are REQUIRED to choose two items each.    \n\nSecond, the sodas are NOT FREE REFILLS!  I learned that one the hard way.  Get water. \n\nThird, before tipping your server, please make sure she hasn't already taken her cut out.  Even after paying for two very bland, overpriced meals and way too many Diet Cokes, I thought that my bill was rather high.  Upon further inspection, I noticed that my server had taken an 18% gratuity.  The menu explicitly says that an automatic gratuity will be taken out for parties of six or more, but there was only two of us and we weren't even drunk.  I found this tactic awfully presumptuous and left her tip at the 18% even though I typically tip well over 20%.    \n\nOverall, I don't like the idea of being required to purchase food just to see a comedy show.  I can see why they do it, but if I were required to buy a crappy popcorn and overpriced pop every time I went to the movies, I would be far less inclined to go as I am not inclined to go to the Improv again.",2
251,"The Pittsburgh Improv is unfortunately another great idea hamstrung by the details of mediocre execution (some specific examples at the end).\n\nThe setup is nice, a delightful--if a bit sterile--reproduction of what you'd think a comedy club should like if you watch enough TV.  The interior is clean; the seats are comfortable; and it's an OK atmosphere to see a show and laugh.\n\nIt's too small, however, to attract many of the best acts, which limits its ability to ever become the central hub for Pittsburgh comedy.  Most of the big names that have recently come through Pittsburgh--Jim Gaffigan, Louis CK, Second City--all perform elsewhere (though they managed to get Bob Saget, to their credit).\n\nBut the biggest problem is the food and drink.  They're very up front about their mandatory two item minimum, but the forced service requires that you spend extra money and get interrupted by waitstaff at least several times during the show.  The prices are well above what I'd consider reasonable given the quality, and I'd begrudgingly--or even happily--just shrug off the cost the same way I would a stadium concession stand markup...but the food is bad.  You're forced to either (a) buy extremely overpriced drinks (3.50 for a soda, for example, with no refills--or ten dollars for one with refills), or (b) buy moderately overpriced food which you wouldn't want in the first place.  I thought the ten dollar chicken sandwich looked reasonable, until a few bites in I decided I'd rather just throw away the money than keep eating it.\n\nStill, I think this place has a lot of potential; the core idea is very workable; and they do attract some really good comedians.  Two stars for now, with high hopes for improvements.\n\nA few specific drawbacks which could be VERY easily fixed:\n1 - A lot of the drinks didn't have prices on them.  I know this isn't uncommon, but at a venue where every question you ask interrupts not only your own show-viewing experience as well as the experiences of your neighbors, it's an incredibly poor decision here.  Make everything on the menu exceptionally clear.  It's not that hard.\n2 - Put the drink prices on the website too.  An Improv representative has personally responded to many of these Yelp reviews, and she once said \""Our menus and pricing are listed on our website, which makes for easy planning!\""  I'm calling shenanigans.  Not all the prices are on the website, which makes for difficult planning.\n3 - Reminding me to tip my server during the show AND adding an automatic gratuity to the check makes me feel like you're trying to trick me.  It's kind of an unprofessional way to say goodbye to one's customers.\n4 - Since the $3.50 soft drinks don't come with free refills, the servers shouldn't ask \""would you like a refill on that?\"" or anything of the sort.  They should ask \""would you like another one?\"" instead.  They should also respond to requests for refills by saying \""we don't offer refills, but I'd be happy to get you another one.\""  Just because there's a 10 dollar refillable soda option on the menu doesn't mean people all figure it out.  Most patrons don't even bother reading the beverage section of the menu if all they want is a standard beverage offered almost everywhere (like a cola or diet cola), and the reading difficulties imposed by the darkness make them even less likely to browse the offerings.",2
252,"I love the Improv. I think its a great way to start or spend a night! Nothing like a laughter filled night. I think its great that we get so many great comedians coming our way (Owen Benjamin, Pablo Francisco super funny Tammy Pescatelli not so much.)\n\nThings you should be aware of: The staff is really strict on the 2 drink minimum so be prepared to spend money on the pricey food and drinks. I kinda wish their menu was a little bit more extensive. Their service is spotty\n\nThe wait staff is a little iffy. I have been here MANY times and sometimes I get an attentive waitress and sometimes not. Most recently our waitress was rude, didn't bother with pleasantries and barely took notice of us. Also beware of the fact they automatically add gratuity. If our waitress was nice I would be more than glad to add to it but this time I was like no way!\n\np.s. when I used my groupon I didn't have any trouble",3
253,"My husband and I went to do something fun. The comedy was great!  The food, however, is mediocre at best. In addition, we were seated in the last row, and 10 minutes into the headliner they sat someone else at our table, so that they were in front of us. I could not see a thing. When we received our check, they had added an 18% gratuity without permission or notification.  I will not be returning anytime soon.",2
254,"We came to the Improv for the first time on Friday night for my wife's work holiday party. We arrived early for dinner and drinks from a predetermined menu. Dinner started with a salad of clearly bagged, almost brown iceberg lettuce, with some croutons and frozen-then-thawed looking tomatoes that were pinkish at best. I took a few bites of this unappetizing poor excuse for a salad, and I can tell you it was downright tragic. Dinner arrived and since there wasn't any vegetarian options on this predetermined menu, we received a dish that was supposed to contain meat with the meat omitted. It was a huge pile of spaghetti in a bowl. It looked sloppy and tasted worse than it looked. The pasta was overcooked, and the tomato sauce was just watered down pur\u00e9ed canned tomatoes. I saw traces of onion in my dish but didn't taste them at all. I was so hungry that I salted the heck out of this abomination and took a few bites. Yuck. I didn't make a dent in this crapfest. For dessert we were given a choice of chocolate cake, which my wife ordered, and cheesecake, which I ordered. The chocolate cake had freezer burn. Inexcusable! It wasn't edible. The cheesecake was only a hair better, but it had obviously come out of the freezer as well. I know people aren't coming here for the food, but if you are FORCING them to order things off of your menu to fulfill some outdated requirements (two drink/two menu item minimum) then at least make some halfway decent food. It doesn't even have to be memorable...just not OFFENSIVE. Which it was!! Had I paid for any of this I would have made a huge stink, but I tried to be polite and push my food around and make small talk. \n\nThe comedians were good. The venue was nice-ish and we got to sit in the front because we arrived early for our \""event\"". Not always the best thing in a comedy club (we only got picked on a little bit). But damn, I was hungry! I found myself fantasizing about all of the crappy Waterfront restaurants and how I'd rather be there...how I'd rather be heating up a discount microwave dinner...how I'd rather have a giant bowl of Captain Crunch...how I'd rather go back in time and eat spaghetti from my high school cafeteria...what a dreadful dining experience.\n\nMy car was also violated in the parking lot. I had an adorable German license plate on the front of my adorable German car which was stolen while I was eating hideous food, which was just the slap in the face I wanted when finally retreating to my car. I feel sick in so many different ways about this experience as a whole.\n\nThe Improv should consider outsourcing the food prep to a catering company. I truly believe that's the only thing that can save this place. Do yourself a favor and eat beforehand, and just order a beer. Well, two I guess. Other diners at our table complained about the quality of the cocktails so I'd steer clear of those. Unless there is a can't miss type of comedian here, I can't ever picture going back to the Improv. I'd give the comedians 4 stars, and the food ZERO stars.",2
255,"This was my second visit to the club and it was still a blast. My girlfriends bought tickets for John Witherspoon for my bachelorette. We were all looking forward to it and it was hilarious! He was wonderful. \n\nThe servers were fantastic. They always came back to check in on us and make sure we had plenty to eat and drink. I suggest the Pink Cadillac for a drink as well as the cheese cake and chocolate cake for dessert. \n\nThe only reason it isn't 5 stars is because they had us wait an hour past the time we were to enter the building. We were to see the 9pm showing so the doors were to open at 8:45pm. They came out and explained that the show had run over and we wouldn't be able to even enter the building until 9:20pm. It was 28 degrees outside. We finally were able to enter the building, order drinks then the show finally started at 9:45pm.  The host did offer a blanket apology which was nice but hardly made up for the fact the show started almost an hour late.",4
256,"Good! I can't comment on the food or the bathrooms, but from what experienced it was great! The drinks were decent, and I  believe you must order two items at minimum. The staff is quick, but they should have more people working on a Saturday night. Before you can ask for anything else they bolt to the next table or to the kitchen.\n\nThe comics we saw were funny as well. Will definitely go back!",4
257,I love that we have a great comedy club in Pittsburgh with a great location at the Waterfront.  Perfect for a date night and I recommend going to a later show and grabbing dinner beforehand.  I received an online coupon code for $5 tickets for John Heffron. What a deal-def. check for deals before you pay full price for any shows here.  We went early to pick up the tickets at the ticket office.  People were lined up outside about an hour before the show and it was freezing out.  I had no interest in doing this so we grabbed a beer across the street at Rock Bottom. Once they opened the doors (15 minutes before show time) the line went quickly and even though we were at the end we still got seated at a table in the back.  It is not huge inside so there aren't really any bad seats.  They usually have an MC for the night who starts  warming up the crowd. This guy was funny and so was the opening act before John Heffron.  My only complaint about this place is that they have a two drink minimum and the prices are outrageous.  $9.50 for a mixed well drink and $7 for draft beers.  The soda was $3.50! Yikes!  At least we didn't pay full price for the tickets.,3
258,"I went here for the first time the other night and had a great time!  The comedian was hilarious and it was a great intimate setting for a fun night out with friends!  My only complaint was that it was a little pricey for the overall experience because not only do you need to buy a ticket, but every person needs to buy 2 items of food/drink and the drinks aren't cheap (around $10-12).  However, I would definitely go back sometime!",4
259,"So...we got here and seated by 635pm. Orders placed. Drinks served. Now it is 752pm. One of my party has still not received his chicken sandwich. I had\nMy shrimp diablo. It was as described. Spicy and good!!! But hour plus for a chicken sandwich is unacceptable. We also sent an order of chicken fingers back...dryer than sand. And my fianc\u00e9s chicken Caesar salad chicken was as dry as the chicken fingers. Barely edible, in fact, she didn't eat more than 3 pieces of it. Upgrade the food service and this place would be somewhat a lil better.",2
260,"This is the best Giant Eagle in the area and is the most like grocery stores in Bay Area. Here's why:\n\n1. They sell beer!\n2. Huuuuuge produce selection\n3. Natural/organic foods section: cereal, pasta, soups, etc and fancy chocolate bars\n4. Long isle of ethnic foods includes mexican, indian, italian, asian and , of course, jewish\n5. Functioning bakery with fresh, appetizing breads and desserts (I am still loyal to Allegro Hearth though)\n\nThe store is huge and I haven't been to all of it yet but they also have nicer flowers, balloons, home/seasonal section, DVD rentals and a photo center as well as a drive-through pharmacy. \n\nIt seems as this GE just might be the answer to my grocery stores woes.",5
261,"Probably the most comprehensive supermarket in the county, if not all of southwestern PA. Its selection is considerably larger than what you can find in most Giant Eagles, and it has more upscale items. I live an easy walk from the Swissvale Giant Eagle, but I often drive to this location for the superior selection.",5
262,"Nice Giant Eagle, not as nice as their new Market Districts, but you can look at this Giant Eagle and see how they came up with the Market District Idea and rolled with it. Fresh made sushi, good cheese selection, awesome bakery.",3
263,"Wahhhhh!!!! They're remodeling this one and it's frustrating! I swear I don't mind change. I really don't~  I should have seen this coming.  There were telltale signs of this happening. First, they switched the pharmacy to the other end of the store where the now defunct Iggle video was. That's A-ok with me, I didn't use the pharmacy anyway. \n\nBut THEN, THEN they moved the whole toiletries section over there. They put my spaghetti and \""ethnic food\"" section (by the way, I love that ethnic food includes spaghetti) to where my Tylenol was. My kitty food is now where my spaghetti once was. Can you tell how exasperated I'm getting?? \n\nDid I mention I don't mind change? But here's the thing, I really hate grocery shopping. It's kinda sorta my own fault because I must read every label to make sure I'm not eating something with 25 grams of fat and 5000 calories (even though ice cream may go into my cart from time to time.) So going to this Giant Eagle frequently was nice because I KNEW WERE EVERYTHING WAS. Now I don't....wahhh! \n\nOk, I'll stop crying. I know I'll eventually be back. I'm sure (??) it will be an even better more magical grocery shopping experience once they're done. But I can't take it for right now. I'll be forced to shop at the Ghetto Bird down in the Southside until my former #1 store is all shiny and new again.",3
264,"You're getting an extra star for two solid reasons.  \n\nOne is because the remodel is over and the store is pretty again (and a bit fancier).  Two, and thee most important part, this iggle has the best quality and well made sushi out of any Iggle's out there!  Believe me, I've eaten many a rainbow roll from many different locations around the Burgh and nothing has compared.  Dare I say, it's as close as you get to going to a good sushi restaurant.  Bold statement, right? \n\nI  just love me some sushi and want it often, quick and convenient and this serves all those purposes with upholding the quality.  Need a quick sushi fix?  This place is it!",4
265,"This is easily one of the best Giant Eagles I've ever been to. Huge. Very nice selection. Easily comparable to Whole Foods. Went to their cheese market, and was pleasantly surprised with the selection. I got Beemster Vlaskas, an amazing Gouda. Very large parking lot.",5
266,This place has amazing selection when it comes to some things and zero selection when it comes to others.  We popped in here a couple times over the weekend I spent in PIT and both times they didn't really have what we were looking for.  Visit #1: Liquid smoke.  Visit #2: Hawaiian rolls.  I know these items must exist in PA just not @G-Eagle.  \n\nThey did however have crazy selection when it came to things like....corned beef brisket or anything that has potato in it.  My californian mind was boggled by the variety of brands and cuts of corned beef that were available.  Too bad that wasn't what I was there for.,3
267,"oddly enough, of all the giant eagles i have visited in pittsburgh, this is the only location that carries the toothpaste that i've used for most of my life (outside of pittsburgh). the location is clean and the staff are friendly.  i sometimes resent having a market district being the closest giant eagle to my apartment, as many of the items that i buy there are severely overpriced. but whenever i run out of groceries and toothpaste at the same time, i take the hike down to waterfront to shop here, although they may not carry all the groceries that i'd like.",4
268,"I'm with Rachel C. on this one. You get an extra star for being a pretty Giant Eagle and a Cafe with a very decent beer selection of 6packs and individual bottles. Even though the Giant Eagle in Robinson is better in my opinion you, Waterfront Giant Eagle, are not bad and pretty close to where I live.",4
269,"This review is specifically for the DFS cleaners at this Giant Eagle location.  I dropped clothing off for the sake of convenience once (I really should have known better).  Never again.  My items came back completely covered in lint.  I could let this slide, however my pencil skirt was safety pinned to the hanger.  The weight of the skirt caused even larger holes than what were placed there by the pins.  Being that it's a pencil skirt designed to have a blouse tucked in, there's no way that I can wear it again.  This was an expensive skirt, completely ruined.  Very disappointed.  Again, this review is just for the dry cleaners.  The rest of the store is actually better than a lot of other GE's I've been to in Pittsburgh.  Just don't take your dry cleaning here.",1
270,"I don't know why, but I just can't like this location very much.  I lived in the area for a little over three years and would always go to another GE before this one.  Maybe it's the way it's set up or maybe it's the way that the lighting seems so very dim.\n\nThe selection is typical for any GE, broad and expansive.  Some prices are a bit steep.  \n\nThis location, like many others, has expanded their pharmacy/health care area.  Which is nice, it saves an extra trip to a drug store.",3
271,"One comfy seat in the entire place, but they have a cafe, they have good books to look at, and they are open until 11pm.  What more could you want?  Why an APPLE PURSE of course!  And a nice Earl Gray tea thrown in for good measure.  Wow...I love this place.  I am such a nerd...only a nerd would enjoy going to a book store and reading as much as I do.  The extra amenities just make it that much more enjoyable.",4
272,"Barnes & Noble, it's like the Wal-Mart of bookstores.  Beating down the competition of other now defunct national competitors and mom and pop type stores alike.  \n\nI'm not quite sure whether I'm in a cafe, at a newspaper stand, a book store, a CD shop, a movie house or a flea market sometimes.  With all the tables and shelves that  you have to dodge it's a bit hard to figure it out.  Feels like the place should implode on itself and then reform into an audio book about coffee.\n\nI don't know about y'all, but I'd rather buy my books from a place that has more knowledge about the merchandise they are selling than a national chain like this.",2
273,Such nice staff.  \n\nI really lament the decline of the modern bookstore.  I really enjoy browsing and picking up a new book.  \n\nThe store has a great selection and the staff are always helpful and kind.  \n\nI really hope this store stays here for some.  The prices are also fair and often have great discounts.,5
274,"I have to agree with Matthew U on this one. I do enjoy Barnes & Nobles but sometimes i get lost just trying to find a darn calendar. I went here after a dinner date with some neighbors and couldn't believe how packed it was. We had to wait 10 minutes just to find enough chairs to seat 4 people. We ended up stealing them from other tables. Not to mention my hubby stood in line for 15 minutes just to get an Ice tea lemonade.\n\nSo amidst all the books, newspapers and magazines they have an audio and video section. The prices aren't anything to rave about. I can buy the same movies online for a lot cheaper there's just the waiting period. I do shop here sometimes for there discount books. I found a lot of great recipe and mystery books for really cheap, like under $5. That's a pretty good deal but considering there is a half priced book store who has a great selection of books for literally half the price of retailers, how can you beat those prices. \n\nB&N is more of a hangout spot with books in case you want to buy one right there and then. But everything is kind of confusing you always need to ask where something is. I'd rather shop online for anything i really want. It's just not worth it to buy it wholesale.",3
275,"Nice venue,  good food, great beer, awful service.  Staying at the Sheraton here I've patronized Bar Louie a dozen times recently and they screw up the order in some fashion every single time, without exception.",3
276,"I stopped here yesterday with Rob and Matt after golf to have a few drinks prior to seeing \""The Hangover\"" at Loews across the street.  Incidentally, \""The Hangover\"" is one of the funniest movies I've seen in years and worth the $10 to see it in the theater.  Okay, back to the restaurant the space itself is very nice.  There are plenty of hightops, plasmas and a few booths.  It's spacious and they have outdoor seating and open windows.  We sat at the bar and were greeted relatively quickly by the bartender who was tending a pretty much empty bar.  I ordered a guinness as usual, Rob ordered a long island iced tea and Matt had a miller light.  Make sure and tell them if you want a top shelf tea else you'll be getting the stuff in the plastic bottles.  I sampled Rob's long island tea and it was not that good way too much sours.  The next one he ordered was much better after a little guidance to the bartender.  The bartender herself was okay, not too friendly but quick enough with the pours.  I don't remember her name which is usually not a good sign.  We ordered a few things from the appetizer menu.  We started with the chips and salsa.  The chips were crisp enough, but not served warm and the salsa had some spice but the colors were a little off kind of looked like the color of pea soup.  Rob then ordered the philly cheese steak sliders.  I tried one it was okay I guess  the bun was warm and it was pretty loaded with cheese and onions.  He asked for a side of mayo and they said they were out, which is bizarre because there is a giant eagle a couple blocks away.  This pretty much sums up my experiences at the Bar Louie's I've been too.  They kind of do just enough for me to come back but rarely make any real effort with service.  Maybe I'm being too critical... I tried to order the baked goat cheese, but they were out... So, I settled on the hummus appetizer.  This was surprisingly pretty good.  The pita was warm and toasted the hummus had lots of flavor and the tabouleh was edible.  It's probably best to stick to simple stuff when dining here.  Matt had the hot wings which I tried one and it was okay, your pretty standard mass produced chicken wing.  All in all this place isn't that bad.  If you want to grab a drink before or after the movie and you're more concerned with convenience than necessarily friendly service and really good food than you could do worse.",2
277,"An absolute must if you're going to a movie and want a drink ($3 drafts and $5 special martinis) and some half-off apps on a weekday from 5 to 7. However, we were bothered that none of the special martinis actually resembled a real martini. No gin or vermouth was used, it's mostly purees and champagne floats with flavored vodkas.\n\nAnyway, the small plates made for good \""upscale\"" bar food. Half-price apps make for a cheap, but nice, dinner and a movie - great, great specials. However, I would not buy a full-priced dinner here. Nothing aside from the apps grabbed me for the outstanding price. The baked goat cheese was small but delicious, and the tempura fried shrimp was just right but the sauces didn't match up exactly.\n\nBe warned that the seats make you feel like you're going to be swallowed by them. Seriously, the booth was like sitting in the mouth of a whale.",3
278,"The Pros: Great view of the city and river in good weather...  \nLovely for loud large groups\nVaried menu with some original items\nGreat place to watch a game inside with a huge bar\nFun location\nGood place to take out of towners.\n\nThe Cons: The food when I went yesterday was not great.  We got the wrong sandwich, our order wasn't as described because the kitchen was out of \""lots of things\""  (Tell us when we order, not when you deliver the meal without elements on the plate.)  \nCan be loud--not a place for a romantic date...\nThe bathroom condition was really bad.\n\nThe server did comp up an appetizer, and they were friendly enough.. they just failed to wow. \n\nThe view was great, and we did enjoy walking around seeing the fountain dance to \""Pour some sugar on me\""  seriously?!?!?  Yes!   Classy eh?",3
279,"I had the EXACT same experience as John R. Went here to get a quick bite to eat before seeing a movie across the street. The place was near empty and there were three waitresses. Got seated and waited on immediately. Ordered drinks, and it took them 15 minutes to come...no, not alcoholic drinks, two waters and an iced tea. This should have been a bad sign, but at this point we ordered food.\n\n20 minutes go by...we flag down our waitress, to let her know that we need to get to a movie in 45 minutes. She said our food would be out in a few minutes. Another 20 minutes, still no food, and our waitress is nowhere to be seen. We flag down another waitress, she says she will find our waitress, who we then notice is chatting with one of the other waitresses. She finishes her conversation and finally makes her way over to our table about five minutes later. She says she didn't even realize our food hadn't arrived (well, you never even checked on us, so of course you didn't). After speaking with the kitchen staff, she informs us that she \""definitely\"" put our order in so it \""must have been given to someone else by mistake.\"" Because they wouldn't have noticed that that WASN'T what they ordered? Seriously?\n\nThe waitress told us she could give us our food for take out and, since we were starving, we reluctantly agreed. 10 minutes later, our food and the bill arrived. All that was comped was the iced tea, and we got some free utensils and wetnaps. How generous! We shovelled what we could into our mouths, did NOT leave a tip (thankfully, we didn't have the added gratuity that John had), and sprinted to our movie where we covertly finished our smuggled food. Worst part? I opened the wetnap, and it was totally dry. Of course.\n\nHowever, I gave this place two stars instead of one. That's because my food, when I finally got it, was perfect. I had the Greek burger and it was huge, cooked exactly how I like it, with delicious toppings. I really wish I could come back here for the food but...hell no.",2
280,"Service has always been good and the food consistent, we usually come for happy hour when apps are half off and there's some great deals on drinks as well.\n\nThings that stand out to me: veggie wrap, fried zucchini, hummus tabuleh and tzatziki platter, and house salad with ranch (their ranch is so good I could eat it with a spoon)",3
281,"Let me just say that this used to be a place I loved.\n\nRemember when you'd go somewhere and have good food, great service and a general pleasant experience and then a few months you'd go back and have it all again? Well one day you decide to go back and you realized everything has changed in a way that you can't describe and the place is no longer familiar. To me, that is Bar Louie\n\nI can't say the food is bad. I had an order of the pretzel sticks for an appetizer and the cinnamon sauce tasted like water and the pretzels were stale. I will say I still ate them so shame on me. My  sandwich (the Mario) as always was very good.\n\nNow here comes the bad:\n\n1. There were fruit flies EVERYWHERE. I felt like we were eating on top of a garbage dump. At one point I had to get a new drink because one flew in my beer. I understand that the establishment is an indoor/outdoor place but there is no reason for 15 fruit flies to hover over my table.\n\n2. The place is enormous and they had one, very nice, but over worked server. The girl looked like she was about to have a heart attack because she never stopped moving.\n\n3. Because of number two our service in general was not good. I can't totally blame the girl she did the best we could. I mean. I've played Diner Dash on my iPad, I know what happens when a place fills up too quickly when you are the only one working.\n\nIt's sad when a place you love turns into a place you never want to go again. I think I'm being very generous by giving it two stars but because I used to love it so much I can't rate it that low. Part of me hopes it gets better, but like an absentee father it'll just let me down again.",2
282,"We were going to see a movie that started at 9:40pm. The 2 of us got to Bar Louie at 8:30.  We sat outside, and it was nearly 30 minutes before the waiter even stopped to get our order.  I tried stopping a waitress but was told 'this isn't my table'.  Finally the waiter took our order.  1 Sam Adams light bottle, and one Pineapple Juice+Vodka.  After about 15minutes another waiter (maybe the manager I don't know) asked if we had been waited on. We said yes, and told him we had been waiting.  He left, and another (different) waitress came to bring us our drinks.. they were wrong.. My date was given vodka on the rocks. and I was given a Sam Adams.. \nThey took these back, and another 10 minutes before the correct order was served.. We told them to bring another round and the check.  It was 20 minutes before they returned.. and they forgot the check.\n\nBy this time we had to go to be on time for the movie.. my date asked for the check again so we could leave.. finally they brought it and I gave him my card, when he came back we signed it and left in a hurry to catch the movie.\n\nfor 2 bottle beers, and 2 pineapple juice + vodka I was charged $31.03. I didn't have time to complain or ask. I won't be going back.",1
283,Food was ok. Waitress was a huge air head. Waited 25 min for my $7.00 beer. Only got it after I reminded her. It is just another disappointing chain restaurant disguised as a local commodity.,3
284,"Although I wouldn't  travel out of my way to have dinner here, this is a resturant that I enjoy having a meal at, when I am in the Homestead water front. On all of my visits here I have enjoyed the tempura shrimp. The dipping sauce are to die for.  I've found myself craveing the tempura shrimp, and the accompanying sauces. \n\nThe first time I ever had dinner here was as a birthday dinner with me and my big sister. So this resturant has sentimental value to me. I attach eating here to having a special night out in the Waterfront. \n\nBar Louie has some very flavorful and fun dishes for bar food, that is.",3
285,When the ratio to wait staff to diners is 3:1 you'd think you could get service!!!\n\nNothing erks me more then seeing idol wait staff and hungry patrons. I very rarely walk out of a restaurant with out having eaten first. I came here on Saturday ay 6pm. Almost none of the diners had food on their table and many of them didn't have drinks in the 15 minutes I was there I counted 9 waitress again I counted 9 waitresses and not a one of them came over to our table to get even a drink order. Just from the looks of it I could tell staying any longer would be a total train wreck. So after 15 minutes of waitress counting we left with empty bellies.,1
286,"I came here last night to get a few appetizers before a movie, and was hoping to be able to write a review on the food. Unfortunately, I cannot because the service was so bad that I left before I had the chance to order. We found seats at the bar behind the taps. After sitting there for 5 minutes and not being acknowledged, we thought that they might not be able to see us, and so we moved to a different pair of seats in the middle of the bar, grabbing a few menus on the way so we would be ready to order. It was fairly busy, but it is not like there were people standing at the bar trying to get drinks - everyone was seated and I'm sure they face much busier times. We sat in our new seats for almost 15 minutes (I timed it - I am not exaggerating), and were not even acknowledged. You would at least think the bartender would acknowledge us and tell us he would be with us when he could, but despite staring him down almost the whole time, we could not even make eye contact. I hope this is a fluke but will probably not be back to find out.",1
287,"The absolute worst service I have ever had at any bar or restaraunt.  And, in looking at other reviews, I am not the first.  There are many options at the Waterfront, and I would suggest you try any of them; but stay far away from this place!",1
288,"I've eaten just once, mostly I go for drinks. Nice, lively place, nice outdoor seating for the summer and fall.\nDrinks are good, service is good.\nLocation is great as well, right across the movie theater.",4
289,$1 burger night on Tuesday. Add ons more.,5
290,"It was the first time that I went to this location.  We sat outside and it was a beautiful night.  I had the BBQ Burger with fries.  For the price of the burger I expected something much better.  It was a very thin burger when it came to the meat.  As a whole it looked large but that was only because of what they piled on top of it.  In addition, their drinks are expensive!  Just one cocktail could run between $10-$12 and they aren't very large.  Our waitress spent more time talking to her friends at the next table than actually tending to our needs.  There are enough restaurants at the Waterfront that I don't know that I will come back here.",3
291,"I personally enjoyed my recent visit to Bar Louie with a friend but completely understand the poor reviews on help. The restaurant is pricey for what it is, and our waitress was a bit lackluster.\n\nSo why does Bar Louie get 3 stars? Happy Hour and a nice patio!\n\nHappy Hour is on Monday-Friday from 4-7pm and offers lots of different options -- $3 Drafts, $4 Wines, $5 Martinis, and 1/2 Price Select Appetizers and Flatbreads. My friend and I ordered 4 Martinis and 3 Appetizers between the 2 of us, and our bill was less than $40 total. Not bad!\n\nI ordered a Strawberry Peach Bellini and a S'Mores Martini, and both were tasty. We shared Bruschetta Pomodoro, Spinach & Artichoke Dip, and Roasted Vegetable Flatbread. The food was also good, and I would order all three items again in the future.\n\nMy recommendation is to understand what Bar Louie is good at (Happy Hour) and only frequent the restaurant at those times!",3
292,"This is one of those places where the presentation is nice, but the taste is too ordinary. Friends and I went here for happy hour (starting at 5pm). They claimed to have $1 draft, $5 mixed drinks, and half off appetizers. When we got there, we realized the happy hour special only applies to certain items, so pretty much the discount was pointless. We ended up spending a fortune on beer and mediocre appetizers. \n\nI only had appetizers here so I can't really judge them for their entr\u00e9es, but I will rate according to my eating/drinking experience.  I got the spinach artichoke dip. It was a little runny and the dip to chips ratio was disappointing. For a dip, it had way too many obstacles built in to it. I don't know what they did with the artichoke, but it was super fibrous...I felt like I was chewing grass. \n\nOverall, I would not recommend this place unless you have money to make it rain. Food was way too average for the high price.",2
293,"Servers are chatting, not paying attention to tables. I can see my salad is ready at the window. Worst serves ever.",1
294,"Meh, I just don't see the appeal Bar Louis has to Pittsburghers. I guess this particular restaurant benefits from people who work at the Waterfront stopping in after a shift. It's always packed. Being so close to the AMC theater, they get traffic before and after movies. \n\nIt's expensive, the food is so so. Before I get ahead of myself, I had the BBQ ranch chicken salad without chicken. The BBQ ranch dressing was very good, but it's very easy to duplicate at home. It's equal parts ranch dressing and KC Masterpiece hickory BBQ sauce and a drop or two of Worcestershire and a drop of franks hot sauce. \n\nTuesday is dollar burgers 5 until midnight, daily drink and happy hour selections, but even that's not enough to get me here. Skip it. One caveat for this location, free parking. At Station Square's location you gotta pay to park the jalopy.\n\nI'm eager to see if this place sees a huge drop in business when Burgatory opens across the street.",1
295,"I am normally a Bar Louie Fan - my husband and I LOVE the one in Tampa.  This location needs a lot of work.  We went on a Friday evening before a show at the Improv.  We were looking to meet up with friends and have drinks and a quick bite to eat.  We never got to the food part because of the level of service that we received.  We got there at about 6:40/6:45 so Happy Hour was wrapping up, but I would say that the bar was not even 3/4 full.  There were also plenty of empty tables.  This should have been our sign to run in the opposite direction.  But we grabbed a table.  I am not a clock watcher, so I am not sure how long it took us to get a server but it was at least 5-7 minutes.  Then we got our drinks at 7:04.  The only reason that I know is because I was looking at my phone because my husband and I wanted to get some apps ordered before the end of Happy Hour.  That went out the window.  When our friends for there; they ordered drinks.  We finished them and left.  The server was nice, that is not the issue.  The issue was how GROSSLY UNDERSTAFFED they were.  They had two bartenders on (I think) and not nearly enough cocktail servers.  The server apologized for the wait on the drinks, but explained it away with \""this happens at the end of happy hour because the bar get swamped\"".  That is a sign that you need more staff.  I have never had this happen at any other bar before.  Get more staff.  We ended up passing up on food because we were worried about time, not the fact that we did not get HH pricing.  Even though, in my opinion, they should have honored HH pricing since we were ready to order food at 7:50/7:55.  We ended up going to the Improv and got food there.  Bar Louie lost a great deal of my money because their lack of staffing and they will never get our Pittsburgh business again or our friends who live there.",2
296,"We stopped here to enjoy a drink before our movie. Our server, was friendly. My husband had a margarita and my server suggested a berry mojito to me.\nBoth drinks were overly sweet and barely any alcohol.  After I finished my drink, I used my fork to dig for the blackberries at the bottom only to find (to my disgust), a decent sized piece of clear saran wrap! Ugg! Did they muddle the mint into the saran wrap?!!! She comped the drink but we won't be back.\nCan't speak about the food since we didn't have any but atmosphere was loud and it was difficult to have a conversation without repeating yourself.",1
297,"I can't even review this place. We sat ourselves and waited for a waitress to take our order, and we waited and waited until we got tired and just left. And I have to be clear it was a Saturday afternoon, maybe like 10 tables with people at them and I saw 3 waitress walking around. I think it's probably a bad idea to ignore people that come into your restaurant, especially since burgatory just opened across the street.",1
298,The food was okay. The noise level--with 10 people in a huge room--deafening. Awful acoustics!,2
299,Food is Shitty probably would be good if they had a cook that knew how to cook it correctly.  Staff is ok no complaints drinks are good as well,2
300,"Eh, this place was okay but it was sort of a weird crowd/overall experience for a Saturday night.\n\nBobby and I came here after dinner and sat up at the bar. Tip: if you sit behind the taps, no one will bother to acknowledge you exist. When we moved seats, we were finally asked what we would like to drink after waiting for 5+ minutes in our original seats. It wasn't all that busy, either. Most of the people sitting at the bar were a bit older than we were. It seems that Bar Louie is trying too hard to be trendy with the decor/neon blue lighting/extensive martini list. Maybe I'm just salty about the wait.",2
301,Really the only thing good about this place is the happy hour. No one wants to pay $8 for a glass of wine that is a short pour and bottom quality.,2
302,"I don't frequent Bar Louie, and I really don't plan to change that any time soon. I've eaten here and stopped in for drinks a couple times over the years and I just haven't been super impressed by the place.\n\nThe food has been decent - a few years back I splurged on an enormous fried chicken sandwich and definitely enjoyed it, glutton that I am - but their meals and appetizers alike have admittedly never \""wowed\"" me. And while I enjoy their cocktails and would consider stopping in just for drinks more often, the problem is that things are way overpriced here. Even during the happy hour drinks are pretty costly, not to mention that I think most of the drinks I personally like don't qualify for the happy hour discount, which is disappointing. Once I stopped in with friends after a movie and one drink cost me $10 here. Not even a large one, either! Sorry, but I find that to be kind of ridiculous, especially since there's cheaper places to get drinks in the area.\n\nStill, the food and drinks are definitely a-ok albeit overpriced, so this place would be rated 3 stars in my mind IF I could hear myself think when I eat here. But good Lord, they're just so loud! I always leave with a sore throat from yelling to make myself heard. Not cool, Bar Louie. Not cool.\n\nSo while the food and drinks are fine enough the loud venue and prices mean that this is definitely not one of my favorite places - and given the other options we have at the Waterfront I don't expect to be back in any time soon.",2
303,"My sons a and I came for Tuesday Dollar Burger Night. You can gat a \""burger\"" (beef, chicken, portabella, or turkey) in a bun with lettuce for a buck. Then you can add toppings to complete your burger at a small cost-cheese 75 cents, veggies 50 cents, Artery Cloggers 75 cents, sauce 25 cents. Those are the headings and they have items listed under them-like 9 different cheeses. You can also get a basket of tots or fries for a small price as well. \nMy burger was $2.25 after I added toppings. Is it the best burger I've ever had? No. But is it the best $2.25 burger I've ever had?  Yes. It's kind if a Russian roulette as to how your burger will come to you cooked. Mine was well done and one if my son's burger had pink in the middle. We probably could have sent it back but we don't mind a little pink. \nI love the tater tots!  They are crispy and have the right amount of salt. Yummy!!\nOur server was great and we'll definitely be back.",3
304,Great environment at night! Songs going on very lively!! The food of my friends who ordered burger and fried shrimps was not that great. But I ordered chicken flatbread which was really delicious! Absolutely loved it  will definitely go here again just for the flatbreads,3
305,"I'm not into waterparks as much as I am into amusement parks.  I go to Sandcastle maybe once a year.  But my Chicago friend Catherine came in to visit for the weekend and after a day at the zoo, we donned our swimsuits and came here.  The main part of the park is closed in the evenings, but the Sandbar and the Sandbar Pool and the Hot Tub remain open for the 21 and over set.  The Sandbar has a great menu of food and drinks and has a $6.00 cover charge to get in.  Occasionally there's live entertainment.\n\nIt's hard to believe that before they built this place, it was the site of an abandoned steel mill.  Actually, it was the railroad yard for the nearby Homestead Works.  But after site-clearing and clean-up, they turned it into a beautiful place to spend a warm day or nice evening.  The view across the Mon is quite beautiful with a wooded hillside on the other side.  There's even a boat dock, so you can arrive by river if you desire.\n\nI'm glad I renewed my acquaintance with this place and hopefully, I'll get another chance to come back.",4
306,"It's fun, but not as fun as Kennywood. The boardwalk food is a bit too far from the wave pool and that makes for a lot of shoes on/shoes off events. The lazy river could be much better. I did like the water slides and the Potato Patch fries, as well as the scenic location.",2
307,"Sandcastle is a mixed bag for the kiddos.  On the one hand, there are plenty of waterslides/pools that are a good fit for young \""riders\"", on the other hand, Sandcastle, like any city amusement park, attracts more than its fair share of highschool kids looking to spend some time away from their parents and assert their personhood.  \n\nUnfortunately that element doesn't particularly care about \""censoring\"" speech for 9 year old ears, and worse, in the Mon Tsunami, about personal space, since the wave pool becomes a near mosh pit of jostling and strutting and shoving and 'showing off' for the fairer sex, and that can be a little dicey for the littler kids.\n\nHaving said that, it's still a good day at the park. . . cheese fries, a cool dip in the pool on a hot day, some fun slides. . . \n\nI think in rating Sandcastle fairly you have to understand the context of the park.  It is NOT policed particularly effectively.  if you take small children you have to be a diligent parent and be aware of your surroundings, paying attention to the group of 17 somethings thrashing around in your near vicinity, \""accidentally\"" bumping into people for a reaction from their group.  \n\nMOSTLY it's a good time.  Mostly.",3
308,"So the last time I went to a water park was probably when I was in elementary school and didn't really know how to swim (... I still kinda don't. lol). Anyway, it was in California at Raging Rivers and it was a traumatizing experience. Screaming & being tossed around in the pool that pushes periodic waves at the sound of a loud horn and ending up with scraped knees and feet. Not fun.\n\nSo to say the least, I was a bit nervous coming to this water park afraid to have another episode of feeling I was being drowned. Luckily that did not happen.\n\nI seriously had SO MUCH fun here! I honestly was only expecting to go on the Lazy River pool all day but with my bf, we hit up so many rides... tandem AND single rides! I feel like such a big girl now! Definitely lean back while you're on those single donuts on the water rides, or else you feel like you're going to flip over while swishing down the tubes. The new dragon ride they just opened up was okay. I was expecting it to be so much more fun, but literally you just slide down a dark tube into a circular room where you just slowly swirl your way down the middle hole and that was it. \n\nThere was this one ride where you slide down the tubes for a few seconds, then you land into a pool where a worker pushes you into another tube and this continues about 3 times. It was weird. Kinda awkward with the worker having to grab you and push you through. Although it was still fun. The last dude threw me in backwards! Scared the crap out of me but it was fun :)\n\nThe food here is surprisingly pretty affordable. Plus, who wants to eat a huge meal while in your swim suit. Me don't want no pot belly. \n\nOverall I had such a fun time here. It definitely made me rethink my fear of water parks. By the way, we went on a Saturday in early June and it wasn't as packed as I thought it would be! So the lines weren't long at all. Also, go to Giant Eagle to purchase your discounted tickets. You save a few bucks versus buying them at the water park. Oh and don't forget to bring sandals while walking around. Your feet will literally feel like they're burning from the ground. Now go off and have some fun! :)",4
309,"okay, so it's not as fun as kennywood but i guess it's still cool... \n\ni planned ahead a day to go for me & bobby (his first time) it was supposed to be nice day, but the weather changed in 2 weeks.. \n\nwe picked a nice time.. since it was literally supposed to rain all day, there werent any long lines/ we literally rode every water slide in one hour. then we went to head to the lazy river--- & it was closed! they said it was closed due to not enough attendence, but i mean come on. we still paid $70 for 2 people to come in this park where i just rode everything in one hour.. keep the lazy river open so i can kill an hour! aah. the cliff hanger was also closed- like always. \n\nso we just went and rode everything again. the Dragon's Den is sweet and the blue tubaluba is as well. bobby had a blast on the speed slides. i have to admit though, i do miss the regular body slide. \n\nanother reason i chose august 3rd to go to sandcastle was that the park was open until 7pm rather than 5 or 6 like regular days. well actually at 4:45 we recieved a \""15 minute warning\"" that the park was closing at 5 due to rain. ugh, a little more time would've been helpful. \n\ni couldnt hear the warning and asked an employee who said they were closing in ten minutes due to the weather and being under-staffed to stay open until 7. it started to rain at 5 and literally at 5:20 the rain was over . the park could've just shut down the rides until the rain cloud passed,  but due to being under-staffed would rather hand out rain checks.. which is fine because we get an another entire day, but i mean it would be a terrible inconvience from someone out of town who planned a family day. \n\noverall, the smile on my boyfriend's face was priceless, but i truly wish we could've enjoyed the lazy river and the park until 7. hopefully next time things go as planned....",3
310,"Sandcastle Water Park in P-Burgh was just \""okay\"" for me. I really think that this place is geared towards children more so than adults or \""family\"" because there isn't much fun here for people older than 16. The water slides here were lacking. There were very few of them and the majority of them are boring. The last time I was there (not too long ago) there weren't any extremely modern slides like a tornado slide, so they really have some updating to do. \n\nThey do have an \""adult pool\"" and bar area but it was so packed that it was hard to actually have fun in this area. The pool is very small, similar to one you'd find at a hotel chain. It has a hot tub area but it sits about 8 adults max. and people were fighting tooth and nail to get in. It wasn't too impressive to me. \n\nThey also have a lazy river at this park and, while I do enjoy lazy rivers, this one was so packed that it was hard to breathe. People kept bumping into me and touching me and it made me grossed out. \n\nThe one attraction that I did enjoy was the wave pool. It was crowded as well but large enough to fit everybody comfortably. The water was nice and clean (a big plus) and the wave action was strong. I could have stayed in there for the entire time we were at the park.\n\nOverall, this place is just mediocre. It doesn't \""wow\"" me very much but if you live in the area, have kids, and are looking for somewhere to go in the summer other than the mall, it'll provide them with a lot of fun.",2
311,"For some reason, I had a tremendous amount of anxiety about buying a new mattress. Maybe I was just self-conscious about rolling around on a bunch of beds in a public place. \n\nABD Mattress quickly alleviated any idiotic fears I may have had. The store was empty when I arrived on a Monday afternoon and I was attended to immediately and never felt pressured. ABD has a great selection of mattresses, and the prices cannot be beat. I picked up a full plush pillow-top mattress for a cool $375 (without a box spring or a frame, since I already had one). Better yet? Delivery is free AND prompt. You pick a three-hour timeframe, and the store will call you on the day of delivery to narrow it to a one-hour slot so you're not sitting around all afternoon.",5
312,"I'm a mattress buying novice. I also hate buying things that require you to try-before-you-buy. I also seem to give explanatory information about myself before reviews. Anyway. \n\nI had a lot of anxiousness about buying a mattress. If it's terrible, you'll be spending a large proportion of your life in misery until you fix the problem. Who wants that? Especially for something that can be as expensive as a mattress? \n\nThese people were great. They patiently answered all of my mattress questions and treated me like a valued customer - both times I called, the man on the phone remembered my name (and number!) and took care of me. When I failed to buy a box spring (why oh why did I think I could go without a box spring??) they were able to take care of me over the phone and get me a box spring in the SAME day. Within hours, even. They even helped me set up the mattress that I DIDN'T purchase from them, which blew me away. \n\nTheir professionalism and friendliness are excellent. I will recommend them to everyone who's in the market for a mattress, especially students, because their student deals are fantastic.",5
313,"Great customer service.  I was in Pittsburgh for business and needed a car to get back to the airport.  I found these guys on Yelp, and the reviews were not wrong.  It was easy to order the car and pick-up was prompt.",5
314,"Other people may have had a better experience with this company but that was not the case for us.  We had rented a limo/bus for a bachelor party.  Our driver Scott, was completely clueless in navigating the city. Constantly making wrong turns and missing exits. All of this after very thorough instruction as to where to go. Each destination took 3-4 times longer to reach due to his incompetence. This caused us to have to skip a couple of our originally planned stops. After returning to the bus after one of our stops we were informed by Scott that the police had come onto the bus and searched it with dogs. Really?!??!  Why??!!  How??!!  We found that our bags had been rifled through and we all felt a little violated and confused. By this point we decided to call it a night. More than half of our passengers didn't care to step back onto the bus and took cabs home. \n\nJust when we thought the worst was over we were wrong. As we enter the highway we realize that Scott has driven all the way up the ramp and onto the highway going THE WRONG WAY!!!  He starts slowly reversing down the ramp while oncoming cars honk and swerve all around us!  Truly terrifying. After that, we were very upset and just wanted to get home. So after several more wrong turns we finally get home. Absolutely terrible night. \n\nSo if you'd like to book a party bus that will include a geographically blind driver, unecessary police involvement, a near death experience and just an overall sense of frustration mixed with panic then go with these guys. Otherwise, I would suggest staying far, far away!",1
315,So I moved to Pittsburgh from Los Angeles. I know I know I know!\nAnyway so theres absolutely no places in Homestead that delivered Chinese so I decided to walk down to the closest Chinese food/restaurant to my house. \n\nThe family that runs the restaurant is very friendly. I read a review about them on Google that said the  mom looks like she might want to cook you alive. Don't believe it!\n\nOn this visit I ordered the Steamed Dumplings(recommended by some reviewer on google...THAT LIAR) and the Vegetable Chow Fun. I generally enjoy steamed dumplings but these dumplings(too much dumpling little meat) werent so good. Theyll probably be sitting in my mini fridge tomorrow and I'll force myself to eat them when I have the munchies/starving to death. The Vegetable Chow Fun on the other hand verrrrrrrrrrrrrry yummy. Definately most have next time anyone decides to stop by. \n\nBut all in all the verdict is you typical Chinese Take Out Place.\n\n*puts the menu on the fridge*,3
316,"The worse \""Chinese food\"", even the white rice which came with the ogle sweet and sour chicken is really bad.  Please don't eat this food.",1
317,"Meh, I've experienced better is an understatement.\n\nFriday's is like the \""fine dining chain\"" for every yinzer in Pittsburgh...\n\n1.  When we were seated, it was quick which was a surprise.  Somehow this restaurant gets packed and I never understand why.  I was happy about that.\n2.  I ordered one of their \""skinny margaritas\"", blackberry to be exact.  It was a nice size, however, at $6.00/pop, that was half of my food bill.\n3.  The waitress started off attentive, but after our food came out she was gone.  I ordered a turkey burger with pickle and mustard.  Loaded mashed potato on the side because I wanted heartburn ha!\n4.  Food came.  My burger had lettuce on it only.  Waitress was supposed to go and get our next round of drinks.  I had to wait to ask for my pickle.\n5.  The loaded potatoes were more like rubber than potatoes and not what I was expecting.  Disappointment.\n6.  The waitress then went into oblivion and only returned with our check.  \n\nNever again will I eat at Friday's.  I will, however, go should a happy hour arise...",2
318,This place.. Is ok if ur grabn something quick .. But they do have a great happy hour tho,2
319,Boo!  What happened to this location?  It used to be happy and fun!  It just feels depressing and nearly everyone there is just doing the bare minimum to get by?  So sad.,1
320,"I'm not opposed to chain restaurants but this TGI Fridays in comparison to some of the other ones in the area truly falls short of the \""chain\"" expectation. \n\nI order the Jack Daniel's chicken and shrimp with just fries. The fries were undercooked and thrown haphazardly into the sauce holder. The shrimp was over cooked and just deepfried. The chicken was fatty and just tasted like it came from their freezer. Even the water tasted weird.\n\nFortunately, we had a very nice and charismatic waiter and all of the staff was very friendly. \n\nI'd recommend the TGI Fridays out in South Hills Village over this one any day.",2
321,I had a gift card so I decided to use it for a to go order. The food tasted frozen and microwaved. Nothing special just around average!,2
322,"Went with 5 others for a weeknight dinner. The server was very friendly, but seemed a little overwhelmed. Maybe they were short handed.  The food was to me not even average. I ordered a burger, which very overdone and dry. Had to drown it in mayo to get moisture in it.  My friend ordered nachos and what arrived looked like they had broken some taco shells down the middle, then put cheese and one jalape\u00f1o slice on each piece. Imagine 6 half-moons of taco shell.  Not like any nachos I've ever seen, and more importantly not even the way they were served the three prior times my friend had ordered them.",2
323,"I don't care what Cub and Bulls fans think, this Steeler and Penguins fan thinks deep dish pizza is not all that. First, the crust tastes like a biscuit, and biscuits belong nowhere near or on a pizza. I will give UNOs a thumbs up on it's flatbread, it's better pizza than some pizzerias In the area. When I look over uno's menu almost nothing excites me, this place is a dud. Guess what? Chicagoans don't know how to eat hot dogs either!",2
324,"Not quite authentic but good enough for Pittsburgh. It's the only place that I've found that even comes close to a classic Chicago style deep dish.\nI also had the french onion soup that wasn't bad. The croutons were still crunchy and it had just the right amount of cheese.\n\nMy girlfriend really enjoyed her Caesar salad and said she'd come back just for the salad.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed it and would come back the next time I get a craving for a deep dish pizza. It wasn't authentic but it certainly was not terrible.",3
325,"Awful everything. From the bad service, to the diluted soup, to the lame-no chicken on the chicken salad, to the PRE-fabricated pizza. AVOID THIS PLACE!",1
326,"I really love deep dish pizza. The thick crust that is crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. The spicy, peppery sauce that can singe your tongue. The mixture of ingredients just sliding down your chin as it bubbles out of your mouth. That being said, I really don't understand why people go to Pizzeria Uno. This chain has done to the deep dish pizza what McDonald's has done to hamburgers, Pizza Hut has done to pan pizza, Dominoes has done to hand tossed pizza, and Taco Bell has done to Tex-Mex; it has made it almost unpalatable. On our menu:\n\nFrench onion\nChicken bites\nPizza with pepperoni, hamburger, and romano\n\nLooking past the fact that the service was not the best or the fact that the food came out undercooked and tepid in temperature, the food just was not good. Don't get me wrong, this is not the worst pizza I have ever eaten, but this chain is a perfect example of what happens when something becomes so prescribed, overhandled, and overthought that it no longer resembles the original piece of art that tasted so good. \n\nI really never want to return.",2
327,Food was ok had a steak w/ shrimp side Ass mashed potatoes. Everything was ok not a lot of flavor.,2
328,"I ate here at around 8:00 on a Saturday night.  Reading the other reviews, it makes me wonder if people were a the same restaurant I was.  Sure, it isn't a world class dining establishment, but it is decent considering it is a chain.  You should know that going into any chain, really.  It was basically exactly what I expected in terms of food quality and price.\n\nWe were greeted immediately upon entering, and while the hostess went to grab menus, another server asked us if we were taken care of.  Service at our table was very attentive and water and other beverages were promptly refilled.  I ordered soup and two appetizers instead of an entree or pizza and the server made sure to ask me about the order in which I would prefer receiving my food.  \n\nMy fiance ordered a deep dish pizza and we know they take longer to make than other food items.  It was quicker than we thought it would be and he really enjoyed it.  I had the potato skin appetizer.  It reminds me of a \""baked potato pizza\"" that I used to enjoy at a local place back in Buffalo.  It was delicious, especially with the addition of a little bit of hot sauce.\n\nOverall, it doesn't even come close to visiting an Uno's in Chicago, but then again, when does a copy every live up to the original?  It won't be a regular location in our  dining rotation, but it is good to know that when we have a craving for deep dish, Uno will do the trick and cost a lot less than a trip to Chicago.",3
329,My girlfriends made reservations here for my bachelorette party last Saturday. I highly suggest that you make reservations because we were able to just walk right in and sit down. There were people there waiting 30 minutes+. We had the sangria which was amazing. Our sever Alex recommend it and it was perfect for the 4 of us.  I had their thin crust pepperoni pizza which really hit the spot. My two friend had salads which they said were amazing and my other friend joined me in ordering a pesto chicken pizza. Let's just say there wasn't any food left on the table when we were finished.  I will be back for sure.,4
330,Pizza ok on it's own nothing great . Definitely not worth the restaurant price.  definitely not like pizzeria UNO in Chicago. Are they even related   or are they just using their name and trademark.,2
331,"The menu is outstanding but the pizza and beer is too expensive. For 2 personal pizzas (the size of pizza hut) 2 beers and 2 salads, we paid over $50 bucks. The personal pizzas alone were $11 each... If you want pizza and beer go somewhere else-pasta appetizers, or sandwiches... this place is good.",2
332,"Well this visit started off good. I was seated right away, no wait. Was given a good beer selection of some PA Craft beers. Ordered the traditional deep dish pizza, but with no onions. Now after we ordered, it just went downhill from there. Was never asked if I wanted another beer, the waitress just gave me more water. My pizza still had onions in it. Which I stated right off the bat, that I didn't blame the girl who took my order. I know cooks can't read. I was one for many years. Mistakes happen, and the manger took care of it and took the item off my bill. NO complaints, still ate the food and it was good. Just not a fan of onions on my pizza. \n\nNow onto the bill, the server continues to tell me that she was sorry for the mistake and declares she told the cooks not to add onions. I already said it was taking care of and there's no worries. She goes on to say that the next day was her birthday, and if I felt like leaving all my money as a tip, it wouldn't go unnoticed. I took this as a joke as I had told her earlier I worked in the industry. When I hand over the gift card I had on hand, she comes back and again repeats herself, tells me that cash as a tip is preferred as she doesn't have to claim it at the end of the night. And again if I felt like leaving her all my money, she would just be so freaking happy. Let me explain one thing and hopefully I am very clear on it. No server, and I mean NO server anywhere, should ever ask a guest or customer for a tip, yet alone, do it twice! So out of kindness, which I shouldn't have left anything by this point. I left a nice tip for the cost of what food I did  have to pay for.\n\nBottom line, the food was good for the price, but the service from this one person as I don't know how the rest of the servers are. Was just horrible.",3
333,"All in favor of a deep dish pizza say I!.......IIIIIII,  ok now that i have that out of my system. This place is such a great hangout/eat-in spot. I hadn't been here and years and some friends invited us out for the evening. I was so glad they were paying cause  I was low on funds at the time.\n\nWe arrived on a friday night and of course it was busy there. We waited about 10 minutes to get a table which wasn't bad considering the crowd. We looked over the menu and they have so many great choices. Pizza, pasta, appetizers, seafood, burgers, salads and sandwiches. \n\nAfter ordering two mango lemonades that were wayyyyy over sweetened we ordered our food. We both are going gluten free which is tough but UNO's gave us a nice selection of dishes to choose from. Plus! They make a thin crust gluten free pizza which taste great. My hubby ordered the mediterrean thin crust because he loves kalamata olives and I ordered the Guac-alicious burger with a Caesar side salad. My salad came out pretty quick which was nice but it had a little too much dressing on it. I didn't complain, it still tasted great.\n\nI'm not into red meat so I tried to order a black bean burger or get chicken instead of beef, but the ran out of black bean and they couldn't get the chicken so i just ordered it anyway. The burger was piled really high with all the toppings including guacamole and it was very creamy but i couldn't get over the taste of the burger because it just didn't have any flavor. Very saddening. I ended up just eating the veggies and discarding the meat. I snacked on some of my hubbies pizza even though it was only a small amount. \n\nWe came here twice in one week. The second time we ordered the 9-grain deep dish with mushrooms, parmesan and a garlic white sauce. Was this pizza amazing or what?? I will probably always eat this pizza whenever I come. \n\nOnly down side is slow service. It took 20 minutes for our pizza to come out and my hubbies was a little over cooked. He got the numero uno which was ok but mine had way more flavor!!",4
334,I had the deep dish pizza and it was very good!  The individual size was smaller Than I expected for $12 but I wasn't starving so it was very filling.  Our waitress April was very nice and attentive for how busy it was.  We had about a 30 minute wait but it was worth it!  I can't wait to try it again!,4
335,"My friend and I have never eaten here before so last night we decided to check it out. For a Thursday it wasn't that crowded and we were seated promptly. There were plenty of flat screens and warm lighting that made the place cozy. We ordered a thin crust pizza: on one side there was chicken, hamburger and pepperoni (for him) while the other side had just pepperoni (for me). I was expecting the pizza to be bland and warm but it was surprisingly hot and savory. I even tried a slice of my friend's pizza and the hamburger and chicken were moist, not dried out. This wasn't bad for a first visit so I will definitely be back in the future to try more menu items. I'm only giving Uno 4 stars because the waitress brought us a plate that still had old food stuck to it. Hello! The plate was yellow! How could she not have seen that?!",4
336,"Well, it started well. Food was okay. Deep dish pizza was good. But the salad we had - too tiny portion!!!\nWe were greeted and seated well. But later the service was not all good. Bad bad service. First of all we had to ask for everything we wanted. The server didn't even had courtesy to ask if we wanted anything more or would like to go for deserts. She just handed over the check when we even didn't ask for it (we wanted to order more).\nLater when we talked about this in the front, the girl there also just listened and said \""okay\"", not even a sorry once!!!\nI would not like to go there again... :(",1
337,Nope!,1
338,Was very disappointed with the food. It was overcooked and not seasoned very well,2
339,Nice place but some of the items on the menu are not available unless you get a 2 for 12 but that's not what the online menu states. And it's a salad come on..,2
340,Love the stores selection but HATE how the girls chase you around to tell you their sales. If I wanted to know I'd ask !!!,3
341,"Interesting the reviews here are less than stellar already. I would normally not review a chain retail store, but the service I received today just really got my blood boiling.\n\nI will state, as I always do in these types of situations, that I have worked many years in retail. I know what you're supposed to do. I know the ways I've displayed exemplary service and I know the ways I've slacked off. I get it, I really do.\n\nSo I'm in the store early. Hardly any people in there. Weird for the Semi-Annual Sale time of year. Usually it doesn't matter what time you're there during the sale, it's always busy. \n\nI went through my usual bins and picked up a mess of undies and bras. Since no one was at the check out counter and I needed a spot to go through things, I set them down and started to try and chat with the sales chick. I actually always like to do this, just to shoot the breeze, but also to get their opinions on items I'm buying. \n\nThe girl behind the counter was having non of this though.I asked her about a bra and she said she didn't know about that one, but said it should work. I understand, you can't try them all. But the thing that really irked me was that she was definitely not hiding her annoyance at me setting down my things on the counter. I even looked back to make sure there were no people checking out behind me. Ghost town. Tumbleweed rolled by. No one.\n\nSo I'm going through my stuff and separating what I want and don't want and she's sighing and grabbing things saying \""Soooo, you DON'T want these???\"" Um, I'm not asking you to help me sort things. I'm not holding up a line. I'm just trying to not spend $$$ on an accidental XS pair of undies that got mixed in! \n\nAfter that, it's not exactly what she said, but how she acted. I have never felt more uncomfortable in a retail store before. I ended up grabbing my discards and putting them back myself (which I really don't mind doing, but after she huffed and puffed, I didn't even want to deal with her). \n\nThe thing is, I was nice the entire time. I don't expect you to sit there and be sugary sweet either. Just do what you were hired to do. Be nice and sell some bras. If you come to work in a bad mood, the real world is not going to give you a hug. Suck it up and do your job or work where you don't have to talk to anyone else ever.",1
342,"Wasn't terrible,\nBut certainly wasn't great.\nSave your hard-earned cash.",3
343,"Honestly, I'm furious. I enjoyed PF Chang's restaurants in the Chicago area, and my wife and I have eaten a few times at this Pittsburgh-area location. Over the last year, we have tried repeatedly, but the 90-120 minute wait for dinner is unacceptable. We tried going early, late -- it never made any difference. The front staff was rude, and the wait was too long.\n\nTonight, we had a special date planned, and made reservations a week in advance. We came in the door exactly on time, waited in the line to see the front staff, and we were promptly handed a pager. They couldn't tell us when we would be seated.\n\nI imagined a short wait, so we went outside, crossed into a store to wait (since the entrance of this location is so packed, it's impossible to wait at the bar or in the meager seating).\n\nAfter 20 minutes we gave up. We went back to PF Chang's and the front office staff still couldn't tell us when we would be seated. I saw open tables.\n\nWhat on earth is the point of accepting reservations if you do not honor them?\n\nThe food here is good, but certainly not great. We went to a local Thai place and were seated with no problem in 5 minutes. The food was much better, the service was good even in a crowded busy restaurant. Oh, and the local place was a much more reasonable price.\n\nWe certainly will never visit PF Chang's again.",1
344,"Stars are for the food only.    2.5 rating\n\nGot there at 8pm on Saturday night, they told us it was an hour wait which was expected, but it only took 30minutes to be seated so that was a bonus.  Started off with the lettuce wraps and i used to be a fan of these but they just seem to bore me now(FYI-love the lettuce wraps at the cheesecake factory).  I had the Singapore rice noodles.  This was so so as i thought immediately that lu lu noodles and asian cafe are better.  The fried rice was disappointing and the vegetables tasted raw.   Some good notes were the Dynamite shrimp, plump, juicy, tangy with a small kick.    Sweet and sour chicken was just the same minus the kick. \n\nThe service was annoying.   We were there less than 45 minutes and it seemed like our waiter was in a rush to get us out of there.   Constantly asking if he could remove my plate.  I had to sternly say at one point that I will let you know when i am finished.  I found it rude especially since  there wasn't even a line at this point.  \n\nI think we will travel elsewhere following a movie.  The result never quite met the anticipation.",2
345,"Went there for lunch and had a decent meal.  While the Mongolian Beef was beyond excellent, the Moo Goo Gai Pan was average (although I did enjoy the shrimp in it).  Service was fine and decor is pleasant.  For some reason I'm just not in the mood to write a detailed review - please accept my apologies.",3
346,"Sadly I've been here a few times because it's a crowd pleaser when my girlfriend's parents come down to visit. There's nothing really WRONG with it. The portions are big and the food is \""alright\"" and the interior gives you the superficial impression that you're encountering fine dining.\n\nThe food is sooooo bland though. Everything you get at P.F. Chang's you can get elsewhere in Pittsburgh at a much lower cost and it'll be made with more precision and have better flavor. The honey chicken at P.F. Chang's was so mediocre all I could think about while eating it was heading over to Wai Wai in Bloomfield and getting a tastier order of it for 8 bucks.\n\nLast time we were there the server was horrendous as well. I don't think I've ever felt as awkward at a restaurant. He brought my girlfriend's father (Don) his unsweetened tea then told him he didn't bring sugar because he asked for it sweetened and then did not understand the concept of sweetening it yourself. He then got all huffy when Don kept asking for it and actually seemed angry at us. When he came back to take our order Don ordered for himself and his wife and before Janey (my girlfriend) and I could order he had already started to walk away. We actually had to yell out to get him to come back and finish our order. (not in an uncivilized or malicious way, either) After that he must have thought we were terrible diners (I don't think I've ever been impolite to someone who is currently at work, or ANYONE for that matter) and he showed it by being silent and plopping things down in a passive aggressive way. It was really embarrassing and every time he came by the conversation died.\n\nObviously the attitude of one idiot who can't hide his bad day well doesn't really have anything to do with the restaurant. But it's soooooo bland! Go somewhere else for Chinese! Look up Chinese on Urbanspoon and it'll give you a variety of good, local places to choose from at half the price.",2
347,"We visitied PF Changs on Sunday with a large group of 20 people.  Although they had to split the tables - everything was delicious!\n\nWe enjoyed everything from the spring rolls and chicken lettuce wraps...to the mooshu that they made special vegetarian for one of the guests...to the fried banana dessert!\n\nif you are with a group, and you want dessert - get the fried bananas!  They come wrapped in a spring roll wrapper and with coconut/pineapple ice cream.\n\nOverall, we had a great time and would come back here again.",4
348,"I've had PF Changs both in Pgh and KC and honestly, I'm never been disappointed nor elated with the food. It's 'upscale' Ameri-Chinese food. You don't come here seeking 'authentic' Asian staples; it's all changed to some degree to suit American taste buds... nothing wrong with that, imo. Do I even know what 'authentic' Chinese food is? Yes, sortuv, somewhat. Will I stop putting quotes around 'everything'? Definitely not!\n\nIt was 45 min from closing time when we (party of 6) rushed in on a weeknight; got seated, ordered and ate without feeling rushed by the staff.\n\nThis particular PF Changs, on the Homestead Waterfront, had fast and friendly service, though he forgot our order of asparagus. We sampled everything from the the Szechuan shrimp to the Mongolian beef to the Dan Dan Noodles. Good flavors, nothing that stepped out in the crowd.\n\nI don't come here all that often but when I do, I invariably leave feeling satisfied and full.",3
349,"So I have never been to P.F. Chang's before since I'm Chinese and I'm not a huge fan of eating at Chinese/American restaurants when I can eat delicious authentic Chinese food at home (courtesy of my momma). My boyfriend and I were at Dave & Busters and weren't in the mood for American food, which was what we were all surrounded by so I decided to give P.F. Chang's a try. \n\nWe came on a Saturday night without reservations, so we had to wait 45min :( Luckily time went by fast while I was on my phone looking at the Yelp reviews for this place. When we were seated, we ordered immediately and our server was very friendly. We got the salt and pepper calamari as an appetizer and then the Dan Dan noodles and Shanghai shrimp with garlic sauce. The food came out quick which was a huge plus considering how busy they were. The calamari was okay. I felt like the strips were cut too thin and we should have received more. The Dan Dan noodles were actually very delicious and flavorful. I really enjoyed them and definitely recommend them. The shrimp was cooked well and was also good. Overall I was happy with my first time experience here and would consider coming back if I'm ever in the mood for Chinese/American food.",4
350,LOVE the food!!!!!! Try the bomb pop martini. The service has definitely Gone down hill in the past year. And when I've  told the manger he just doesn't give a shit.  It's either hit Or miss with service. But food is ALWAYS GOOD,3
351,"The service was lackluster. Coffee was warm but delicious. Limited to one cup, apparently, as the waitress never offered a second.\n\nDaughter had sweet and sour shrimp. Wife had spicy chicken. I had wonton soup. Dumplings as an appetizer for the table. All arrived warm. The brown rice was dry as sand and the white rice was delayed by rice cooker problems. Also dry as sand. I guess that is how they serve it.\n\nThe base flavors for the shrimp and chicken were nearly identical. I had expected them to be more diverse. \n\nIn all, expectations were not met for what is advertised as upscale. I'd rather have the local Chinese cuisine which more flavorful, and much less expensive.",2
352,"This was my first time at this PF Chang's and I was not impressed. The service was extremely slow even though it was a Sunday night and the restaurant was not very busy. The portions were small. \n\nThey were also playing 5 year old pop music really loud. Pop music?! Come on--this is an \""Asian Bistro.\""",1
353,"I was unimpressed with my food and I am even more sad to see, now that P.F Chang's mass produces frozen dinners. \nThis is about as far away from Chinese food you can get, unless of course you are eating microwaved warmed shrimp fried rice. The restaurant is cluttered and the music was up so loud.  I had to yell to carry on a conversation. P.F Chang's in the Waterfront is a unmemorable experience. Maybe I would have better luck microwaving my own meal at home?",3
354,"I really enjoyed my Mongolian beef and pork pot stickers, but \nThere was NO presentation of pfc mixing sauces. \nOne of the things that sets pfc apart from the run of the mill Non franchise is PRESENTATION and experience.  I was extremely disappointed by the LACK of presentation. \n\nReservations:\nOur party arrived about 15 minutes before our 5:30 reservations.\n\nAt 6:11 we were informed our reserved table had been given to another party . Obviously someone dropped the ball here.....\n\nWhen we requested silverware for the table. Our waitress blamed it on the hostess. Yes, theHostess should have provided silverware.. However It was unprofessional of our waitress to pass buck. As a Patron I could care less who's fault it is; just $@&&@in fix it. Defiantly took away from my pfc experience.\n\nMy Hot and sour soup is usally served with\""noodley\"" things that I drop in the soup. We weren't given any \""noodley \"" things . Not trying to be a jerk but all things being equal the pfc isn't selling food as much as they are selling an experience. This experience is what sets this restaurant apart.",2
355,"I have mixed feelings about this place. I wish I could give 2.5 stars, but I'm in a good mood so I'm rounding up today. \n\nThis was my first time here and I honestly wasn't sure what to expect. The first thing I noticed when I walked in was the layout of the dining area. It seemed less intimate than I had pictured in my mind. The tables were all jammed together and the restaurant had a crowded feel to it. Fortunately, there wasn't a long wait as we had made a reservation. \n\nWe were seated at a table in the middle of the dining room alongside a busy throughway. It seemed all the servers were destined to walk past our table. I appreciated that their menu pointed out that their meals were \""meant to be shared.\"" My wife and I decided to share our two meals: Chang's Spicy Chicken and Double Pan Fried Noodles. Before our meal came out our waitress set some sauces on the table in a \""here's your sauce\"" kind of way. I remember thinking, \""That's very nice, but I have no idea why you just gave us sauce.\"" There was no explanation - just a little tray of sauces. Our food came out and she finally asked if we like mild, medium, or hot sauce. We picked medium and, with a few scoops, she turned our three sauces into three mixed sauces and I still didn't know what they were for. \n\nForget the sauce though, my attention was now drawn to our meal. For meals that were \""meant to be shared\"" these sure are little portions. I guess when you go for that high-end presentation you can charge 50% more for 50% less. The food itself was good (in an ok sort of way). I can't say it was the best I've had, but it was good enough. \n\nOverall I thought the experience was lacking. P.F. Chang's tries to be classy, but does it in a cafeteria sort of way. I was constantly distracted by the front doors opening and icy air pouring across the room. The music didn't fit the ambiance. Our table felt like it was in the middle of the road. The restaurant was loud and crowded. The girls at the table next to us were taking those annoying duck-face puckered lip pictures...  \n\nI think our experience may have been different if we were seated at one of the booths along the side of the restaurant, but no such luck.",3
356,"Surprised how empty the restaurant was tonight.   First time at this location.  Great service, but wasn't hard to do.....\n\nHad a combination Orange Shrimp and Chicken and Chicken Fried Rice.  It was typical PF Changs (Very good).  You can get the Fried Rice off the kids menu for $2.95 versus $8 for a big bowl off the regular menu.",3
357,"Let me start by saying that I do like their food. \n\nLast night I went with my wife and two guests. The apps came out fast and were fantastic. Dinner on the other hand, didn't come out quickly at all. The rice was undercooked, and we told our server. He set the rice on the empty table next to us and forgot to bring a new order. By the time I was almost finished with my meal, another server came over and they brought back another bowl of crunchy white rice.\n(is that the way rice is prepared now?)\n\nI ordered the chocolate cake. I asked for a container to take half home. The server brought out a small container and when I asked for a larger one, she said we can just squeeze it in there, and started to flatten the cake. She then realized that a larger one would be better.\n\n4 people, not crowded...2 hours total.",2
358,"ok so i've eaten here more than once but just thought to write a review on it. now, i'll be honest this is the only one i've ever been to, so i don't know if they're all the same but every time i'm underwhelmed. i get there, look at their giant selection and get excited. then i get my meal and remember that i've never had anything too great. don't get me wrong, it's not bad, but for how much they charge, they really need to step it up or at least give me a huge portion. just saying...",2
359,"Our last few visits have left something to desire, One of the things I always notice is the demeanor of an establishments employees. These people look miserable, no one smiles or greets you appropriately, it's more like get in, get out, turn the tables,\n\nThe food has remained consistently good... when we can order it. the last time JB and I came for a quick dinner, the place was not busy yet we were passed by 6 frowning waitstaff without getting drinks... for 15 minutes we were left suiting at our table with our menus closed and sitting on the edge of the table (HINT, HINT) so we left and most likely will not be returning.",2
360,"If you look at other reviews you will see that I am a very positive person, but tonight was an utter disaster!!  We sat at the bar and the female bartender  was miserable. We ordered drinks and she was unhappy that we did.  She spent 20 minutes sending text messages and took 3 smoke brakes in one hour while our drinks were empty. We ordered appetizers and they never came out.  She actually brought us our check and we never got our food. By the way we were the only people at the bar.  Finally a bus boy brought us our food after we payed. We payed before our food came because we thought our table was ready. We finally got seated by the windows. Do not sit by the windows because it was very cold. We ordered our dinner and drinks and guess what no drinks. After our food came we asked about our drinks and the waiter said he forgot. Nothing was comped and no manager was available. This PF Changs needs new management!! We will never return. I will give it 2 stars because the food was great, but the employees are absolutely miserably from hostess to waiters to bartenders. Steer clear until changes are made. It's not worth the headache.",2
361,"A big thank you to Chad Cynamom, manager at PF Chang's for making our anniversary night so special.  He seated us, brought us drinks and told us about the menu.  Every time my fiance and I go to this PF Chang's, we get the best service.  Food isn't the most authentic chinese food we've ever had, hence the 4 stars.  It is a bit overpriced as well, but the service makes up for it.",4
362,"Walked in tonight, Wednesday, at 9:50, the place was empty. Asked for a table, the hostess told us one moment when she finds one for us, then proceeded to walk to a dirty table and clean it!  The phone rang and she answered it as we stood at the door. When she hung up the phone she walked back to the table and proceeded to clean it again!!  Didn't say a word to us. Unbelievable!  Will not be back there-- rude hostess!",1
363,Good quality pork fried dumpling and mongo beef.  Bar service was fast and Efficent.   Good value.  Not a 5 cause dragon eye tea was cold first time around and beef had minor amount of fat.   Fortune was even Postive!,4
364,"I seriously don't know why people love this place so much, the food here is horrible. The rice is never cooked properly.. And it's not even Asian food. It's fake asian food. I never come here anymore.",2
365,"We had another opportunity to eat here today and the experience was much improved. There was no crowd to fight and we weren't seated near the door as we were last time. As I expected, getting a table near the edge of the restaurant provides for a much nicer dining experience. Our service was good and they accommodated our 1 year old nicely. I appreciate that they serve steamed veggies on the kids menu. \n\nI still left with the impression that the serving sizes were small in comparison to most other places, but we were satisfied and happy.",4
366,"We went last night Saturday night to P.F.Chang located at the Kierlands in Scottsdale. Terrible Experience!!! after waiting over one hour to be seated, we ordered calamari for appetizer which came with a horrible strange salty sauce and salt and pepper mix on the side. then I ordered beef and broccoli and my husband ordered a vegetarian dish with peanut sauce . After a long wait my food came so salty that I could not even eat and as much as I hate to complain but I had to let the waiter know, so he went to get me one with less salt. My husband's dish was OK. then the second one was a bit less salty but the meat had a terrible liver kind of taste which totally turned my stomach. I feel the reason they added so much salt was to hide the bad tasting rotted meat. Very bad experience. Our waiter was kind and sympathetic. ruined my evening out :(",1
367,"Let me start off by saying I have mostly simple tastes, and my favorite lunch spot for Chinese has been the New Dumpling House in Squirrel Hill. But since that restaurant is undergoing renovations, I was forced to try something new.\n\nSo... I thought I'd try the chain PF Chang's Chinese Restaurant at the Waterfront. Wow, what an unsatisfying mistake that turned out to be.\n\nI started with a cup of their Wonton soup. At $2.95 it wasn't too outrageous of a price, the broth had some flavor and there was much more in it than I was used to, including three giant basil (I think?) leafs that covered everything beneath. In the broth were chunks of chicken, two shrimp, some sliced water chestnuts and two \""pork\""-filled wontons. As I said, the broth had decent flavor, but the wontons were thick, doughy and under-cooked, and the chicken chunks were dry, which is amazing since they were drowned in broth! On a scale of bad to good, it was kind of meh.\n\nNext came my \""lunch-portion\"" order of Chang's Kung Pao Chicken (the dinner portion is $5 more). \n\nAt the New Dumpling House, this dish is served with a delectable dark, rich, tangy sauce, which I was really hoping for... Not at PF Chang's. \n\nOn my plate I received about 8 quarter-size chunks of lightly breaded and browned chicken, 7 hot Chinese red chili peppers (mostly inedible unless they are diced into a sauce), a handful of blanched, unsalted peanuts, a few sliced scallions, and a bed of the most bland brown rice I have ever encountered. Uncle Ben would've been ashamed if that stuff came out of one of his boxes.\n\nGlaringly, there was NO SAUCE!. None at all.\n\nI've had Kung Pao Chicken in New York City, San Francisco, and even from a hole in the wall in Bethel Park, PA that was much, much better. Never have I had it served in such a bland, skimpy, and overpriced way! The \""lunch-portion\"" cost was $9.95.\n\nAt The New Dumpling House, I could have a delicious lunch, with soup, entree and complimentary hot tea, and I could leave satisfied with just $8 out-of-pocket -- and that includes the tip.\n\nThe service was decent. However, lesson learned. One and done. Never going back to PF Changs.",1
368,This is the fourth Changs I've eat ate. It was pretty good. The food was kinda like it had been previously frozen. Had a strange texture. Some of the changs chicken pieces was stuck together and the breading on the sweet and sour chicken was mushy and falling off the chicken. Overall still pretty good. Would eat at this one again.,4
369,"Our family loves this restaurant.  My children and I suffer from food allergies.   I have Celiac's Disease and their gluten free selection for a Chinese restaurant is great.  My children are a completely different ball game.  They have a rare disease called Eosinophilic Esophagitus where food attacks their body.  They are very limited on their food selctions due to not being able to consume any food with gluten, soy, eggs, dairy, nuts, tree nuts, fish, shellfish, amd corn.  This restaurant takes special care of my kids by making sure they get chicken that has not gone through the egg wash.  The servers and managers are all trained in how to be careful.  Our favorite manager is Joe and favorite server is Kevin.  Call ahead if you have any questions and they will answer your questions.",5
370,"This place hit the spot. \n\nStopped here before a movie and ate at the bar. We got just what we wanted: quick service and some good eats. \n\nI recommend the fried green beans with aioli  -- soooo good! Who knew I liked green beans?! And this trip I tried some sushi and got the spicy tuna roll. Although it was clearly not pieced together by an expert sushi chef, it was extremely fresh and delish (so who cares if it's not beautiful?!)",5
371,Extremely helpful staff that knows exactly what shoes are comfortable yet stylish. The shoes I bought were high quality and durable. I was extremely impressed by the staff.,5
372,"I live close by so I go here frequently pretty much for the free WIFI and espresso. But here's a secret - they don't seem to know what an Americano is so often I am charged like 75 cents for a double shot of espresso to which they add hot water upon my request. Needless to say coffee is not expensive here as you can fill up as many times as needed without being hassled. Although there regular coffee is undrinkable to my taste. Pastries are baked fresh and are plentiful. There is other foods to choose from ie whole grain bagels are edible and about a buck with no extra charge for butta. Outside seating and people watching is always a good distraction plus there are all kinds of people who frequent this Panera from the very very old and decrepit to the fashionistas taking a break from Victoria Secrets, Ulta, Wet Seal and the other various shops at this water front location.",4
373,"I've had bad experiences here a few times now.  I wrote panera bread and haven't heard back.  Bad service all around!!!  Basically, we ordered our food, they ran out of what we wanted, so just decided to make us something else with out telling us.  When we got our food, we asked why they made us that instead of what we ordered---'oh it was the closest to what you wanted'.....hmmmm how about you tell us that before we pay, and how about you give us our money back.  Really, you don't get much for what you pay for at panera.  Its not very good at all.",2
374,I like Panera bread but this one is a so so. I always get my fuji chicken salad in every Panera bread I go. All of the other use spring mix to make their fuji chicken salad except this one.. They just use regular salad and salad doesn't taste or look very fresh either. I was kind of excited to find there is a panera bread around us but I am disappointed after trying it. Don't know if we will be back again.,3
375,Panera bread has to be the most inconsistent restaurant I have ever been to. I have posted two pictures of the strawberry poppyseed chicken salad. The first one looks delicious the second one looks like they could've used a smaller bowl. It did not even look appetizing.,2
376,"The food was fine. It's a chain. I'm not rating it. \n\nThe service was absolutely horrible. It started well enough when we ordered lunch, but ended horribly when my daughter said we should get a treat for my husband. \n\nBetween being ignored by the girl at the counter, her not listening to the order, then arguing with me when I told her I did not ask for what she brought me, I really can't decide which is worse. I rather spend my money somewhere local where they appreciate my business, rather than take attitude from Panera employees.",1
377,"It was my first time here.  Was recommended by my coworker.  However, I was a little unsure as I've read some bad reviews about this place.\n\nThe first visit was great.  The receptionists were helpful and gave me guidance on how to get my dog licensed.  Everyone seemed happy and talkative.  \n\nDr. Bezak was very nice.  He had a smile on him the entire time I was there.  He was very quick to give me information about anything and everything relating to the dog.  Overall, I had a good first visit and definitely going back.\n\nThe only thing that made it didn't earn a five-star is that my appointment is at 12:15pm.  The entire office have their lunch at 1pm.  So I can tell there was alot of hustle to get me out of their asap.  I don't mind that it was a quick visit, but I would have liked to had time to ask more questions.  If you want adequate time with the doc, consider making your appointment after their lunch.",4
378,"The problem I have this experience compared to my last is that the examination lasted 3 minutes.  The vet checked the ears, teeth, and nails then called it a day.  \n\nI came home looked at his teeth and saw my pup had a \""slab fracture\""  which was still attached to the gum.  The vet didn't mentioned it during the \""exam\"" other than telling me to buy a finger brush to brush his teeth.\n\nI was primarily there for a vaccination shot but if they're going to charge me for a examination, they should do a proper examination.  I just felt I was rushed out of there. \n\nI took my dog to another vet where they told me about the slab fracture, gave me info on how it usually happens, potential problems that it can cause, and recommendations on ways to fix the problem.",2
379,I only allow my dogs to go to Dr. Bezak. I've had a couple Chow Chow's who a lot of vets are afraid of. Doc had a Chow himself so knew what to look out for in the breed. He has taken good care of them over the years.,5
380,"I mean, it's Target. It has everything. You just need to know what to buy there, and not get sucked into the convenience of buying everything in one spot.\n\nBeware -- though their merchandise looks nice, and it's a good buy for a student, you don't want to make long-term purchases here. The zipper on a skirt I bought broke the first time I wore it. I've heard horror stories about disintegrating comforters during their first wash.\n\nThat said, their store-brand toiletries and other sundry items are fairly cheap, and they have a wider selection than Giant Eagle or CVS. They also have a cool program with Flickr.com -- you can upload your photos, order them online from Target's One-Hour Photo kiosk, and pay by credit card when you pick them up.\n\nI love their cheap accessories -- glasses, bags, jewelry. Along with Claire's and Filene's, Target is my favorite place to shop for those things.",3
381,"What can I say, I'm a shill for Target!  Like another reviewer says, you have to watch the impulse buying here because it is so easy to do!\n\nBut as for the name brands here, I've never had a problem with them.  I bought some Woolrich blankets and sheets here that my husband and I have been very satisfied with.  The housewares section here is positively unbeatable.  My husband Rick is an amateur chef and he could blow his paycheck on the kitchen utensils.  He particularly likes the Michael Graves ones.  He is also an amateur photographer and he still works with film, so he likes the film development here.\n\nMe, I also like buying household cleaners and personal items such as soaps, toothpaste, deoderant, etc because the selection is so good.  I've also purchased a lot of my casual wear here.",4
382,"Oh Target!  You are big corporate America!  But how can I not love you so?  Your prices are the best whenever I need household goods like detergents, cleaners, etc.  For personal effects such as toiletries, soap, etc, you can't be beat!  Your cookware and bakeware department is every bit as good as Macy's!\n\nAnd I see you have the retro tees too.  You know:  Yes http://www.dovenetq.net.au/~mahayes/Graphics/YesLogoFullCircle1.jpg Boston http://www.vinylrecords.ch/B/BO/Boston/Boston/boston-63.jpg Led Zeppelin http://henrikfalck.com/blog/uploaded_images/LedZeppelinLedZeppelinalbumcover-716782.jpg  We know what \""retro tee\"" means:  faux aged, catering to boomers and teens, and costing way more than they origianlly did.  Oh and made in China of course!",4
383,"Target is one of my favorite stores -- I just love wandering around late at night when the store is quiet -- it's just so therapeutic! This location is now my closest store, so I drop by pretty often.\n\nThis store is pretty average. Inventory and customer service aren't particularly stellar but isn't poor either. I've generally been able to find what I need here and check out pretty quickly. \n\nIn addition to the common pharmacy and photo studio found in most Targets, this location also has an optical department. Of the 10-15 locations in the Pittsburgh area, only this store and the Cranberry store sell glasses. I purchased a pair of glasses and sunglasses through Target Optical three years ago and have been very happy with their product and customer service.",4
384,"It's not the greatest Target of all time but it still meets all of your basic needs.\n\nIf you're looking for produce, lower prices, and bigger selection in every department then head to the Target in East Liberty.",3
385,"I've been to many Targets and they're all the same. However, this particular one is currently being remodeled. Children's clothing, toys, electronics and health & beauty items have been moved to other parts of the store. There is a new Starbucks that is now open. The cafe that is there has been remodeled and will serve Pizza Hut pizza and other new menu items. The area where the electronics used to be it is now going to have a small grocery section. Basically, this Target in Homestead will eventually look like the one in East Liberty. I like this Target, so I am pleased with the new changes (especially Starbucks)!",4
386,"Watch out when it looks like something is on sale.  They mark a rack or table with a big buy one get one or 50% off sign, then only some of the stuff on the rack is on sale.",2
387,"Let's start this review by saying that when we are at that point, my girlfriend and I will be going to Jos. A. Bank for mine and my groomsman's suits.  Allow me to give you a numbered breakdown of the issues we encountered when renting from Men's Wearhouse to be the groomsmen in our friends wedding.\n\n1- They never contacted us after the fitting after saying there would be a followup call.  The other groomsmen and I had to follow up repeatedly to get an answer as to when our tuxedos would arrive and the staff were very short with our honest questions over the phone.\n2- They sent two of our tuxedos to Homestead when we asked for them to be sent to Ross Park Mall during the fitting.\n3- When one of us called two days prior to the wedding to ask if our tux's had arrived the guy answering the phone said \""Oh... I don't know\"" (insert an awkward, pregnant pause here while waiting for him to say \""Let me check that for you\"") he instead said \""Well, I'm going to hang up now.\""  And he made good on that promise, and hung up.\n4- Despite saying we'd get a call a few weeks ahead of the wedding to be resized in case one of us gained a few lbs over the winter, this call never came so we basically had to hope that everything fit as it needed to.\n5- We were at one point informed that MW had our emails on file and that when our tuxes arrived at the store we would receive an email letting us know.  Not a single groomsman received any such email to that effect.\n6- One of the groomsmen randomly received a black tie while everybody else had white.  Another received no studs.  We discovered this approximately two hours to show-time while relatively far from civilization.\n7- On picking up my tux I informed the associate \""I'll be unable to get to a Men's Wearhouse for a few days after the wedding, is this alright?\"" to which she responded \""Yeah that should be fine\"" so when my girlfriend graciously dropped off my tux for me a few days later and learned of the $100 late fee, I was totally caught off guard.\n8- My girlfriend was also caught totally off guard by the associate at Ross Park Mall who was incredibly rude to her when  he informed her of said late fee.\n9- As the Best Man I was given a coupon card for $50 off my next rental at Men's Wearhouse.  Since I am in another wedding next month with rentals from MW I figured this would be an opportune time to use it.  Imagine my shock while paying for the next weddings rental, when I presented the coupon and was told \""Oh, that isn't for this.  That is intended for YOUR wedding.  Oh and it expires on December 31st of this year.\"" \n10- The groom himself decided to use a coupon to purchase a suit for the wedding and to own, rather than rent a tux for the occasion.  He was ensured by the Homestead staff that the coupon would be fine for this purpose and got fitted for it.  When he went to pick up his suit and pay with the aid of said approved coupon he was instead forced into an argument with an associate who insisted he could not use the coupon towards the suit that an associate a few weeks earlier had insisted he could use.  Granted, now I am speaking for another person so take that with as much salt as you may, but he reiterated this fact to me several times prior to his wedding last week.\n\nOver my friends wedding weekend, any time anything even went slightly wrong at and around his wedding, the joke between the Groom and his Groomsmen was \""Effing Men's Wearhouse.\""  For example, at a restaurant, \""Wait I asked for no onions on this sandwich. - Effing Men's Wearhouse!\""  \""Noise complaint at the hotel room? Men's Wearhouse.\""\n\nAnother groomsman looked at me when we discovered the wrong color tie one of us received and said to me \""I hope you're taking notes for your own impending wedding\"" to which I replied \""Perhaps I could find better service from GoodWill of Western PA\""\n\nCongrats Men's Wearhouse.  You became the butt of every joke for every mishap for an entire weekend around a wedding to which you provided the suits.\n\nTL;DR - 10 mistakes, several rude associates and 1 future groom going to Jos. A. Bank.",1
388,"I went in to get my suit that I bought last year tailored because I had lost some weight and I couldn't have had a better experience. When I walked in I was immediately created by Bill who was warm and friendly. Anna came out to perform the measurements and mark up the suit. She checked everything, even changes I hadn't thought to have made to make sure the suit fits me perfectly when they are done. Best of all, when I asked if they could ship the suits to me at my house since I no longer live in Pittsburgh, they asked when I was leaving town and promised they would get it done for me before I left  the next day. Better yet, they had the suit ready for me early, avoiding the rush for me to pick it up before I left. Everyone was extremely helpful and diligent and I will continue to only get changes done at this store.",5
389,It's not that delish.,2
390,Great on line service!!!  2nd time placing an order on line and they made it easy as far as getting the correct sizes in a timely manner.,5
391,"This store has such bad service. The service staff are rude rude rude.  Save your money, shop elsewhere.",1
392,"I love bed bath & beyond! \n\nThe employees at this particular one are always available and helpful!  \n\nThe selection, plus the 20% off coupons keep me coming back, and its also where I get all of the things for my soda stream. \n\nOverall I will be back many, many times",4
393,"We just completed our wedding registry at the Homestead location. The customer service was outstanding! One of the employees, Chris, walked around with us to help us pick out exactly what we needed. The wedding registry coordinator, Christina, was also very helpful and accommodating. They treated us as if we were royalty. I would recommend this wedding registry without a doubt!",5
394,"Much like every other Eat 'n Park (3 or 4 stars worth of chain-diner food), except the last five times I've been here, the service has been damn, damn, daaaaaaaamn slow.  It's always fun to see the staff smoking out back while I've waited an hour for some scrambled eggs.",2
395,"If you must eat at Eat N Park, this is the one you want to go to. Why you ask? The corporate offices are right next door and the suits are there every day, breakfast lunch and dinner. \n\nWhen I spend a few hours with dear old mom, she enjoyed spending a day at the Waterfront, she loved the since closed 39 center store, where she could buy her monthly greeting cards for 39 cents each. Then we drive over to this eat n park where she has her breakfast smile and I enjoy an egg beater sandwich and fresh fruit.\n\nThis place is spotless, the salad bar always looks fresh and the food is good, for a chain.",3
396,Great location!  I love that you can substitute burger with a veggi patti and that they have gluten free bread.  Love love love the smiley cookies :),5
397,"The food is usually pretty good, however the service is almost ALWAYS very VERY slow. Most of the staff are pretty friendly and sweet but there are a few sour ones in the bunch that make the experience not as nice as it could be. Although they still technically do their job, you can FEEL very negative vibes from them and see how inefficient they are with the way they do things. It's a hit and miss. Unless you know one of the servers and their schedules. The low rating is mainly for the slow service and the handful of staff members who aren't very pleasant.",2
398,They make a nice breakfast for less than the tip form dinner the night before.  That's not bad!,3
399,"Eat n Park is usually decent.  This location though has HORRIBLY SLOW service.  Seriously, we never wait less than 10 minutes for a server to acknowledge us, and we live near the Waterfront, so we've given this location the benefit of the doubt numerous times.  Each time hoping that the last was just a fluke, new staff, or something.  It's not.  Doesn't matter what time we go.  It seems we are not acknowledged for several minutes, and then the service is mediocre at best.  Occasionally, we've had a stellar service, but it's few and far between.  Today, after waiting 15 minutes, then getting up to find a server in another section, we were informed that we were sitting in a \""closed\"" section.  That server offered to serve us, but honestly, we left.  I told the hostess who seated us about the mixup, and got a blank stare.  I've never had this issue at any other EnP.  We left, drove to the Squirrel Hill location, and our orders were taken in the amount of time we wasted at the Waterfront.  Mgmt- you have a beautiful, prime location.  Get your hosts and servers on the same page!",2
400,Very good cheap food. Pittsburgh classic.Great desserts! The oreo pie is amazing! The servers are always very friendly. The salad bar could be a little more clean.,4
401,"God i hate eat n park. Only reason i have gone is for the salad bar because u cant find a decent salad bar in this city. Just about every entree iv had here is nothing more than rubbish, except maybe the cheesteak. Only go if u have little kids",2
402,"If you're looking for a wallet, a new cheap purse or something of that nature--this is the place to go.\n\nOtherwise, this kind of shopping just isn't for me!\nI don't have the patience for clothes shopping here though.\nThe racks drive me nuts bc they're in no particular order.\n\nIts \""Shirts/Sizes\"", \""Pants/Sizes\"", \""Jeans/Sizes\"", \""Coats/Sizes\""\nI can't look through a gazillion racks of shirts looking for something I like (aimlessly) in a M or L...

403,"Went in here to grab a last minute item I needed for an outfit.  I wasn't going to hold my breath here either, I know it's a Marshalls and that doesn't always mean the best selection.  It's hit or miss no matter what you are looking for.\n\nThis day, was a hit, maybe even a home run.  I do have to admit, the Kenneth Cole shirt I got not only looked great on me, but made my wallet feel even better!",3
404,"Since both Marshalls and TJ Maxx are owned by the same company, I make sure to stop by both locations when shopping at the Waterfront. I generally find nothing or spend only $10 or so at Marshalls, while being enticed to spend at least $50-100 at TJ Maxx. The Waterfront TJ Maxx seems to have not only the same product as this Marshalls plus a whole lot more. All that to say, I consider shopping here a waste of time since I could just drive a block or so and be at a store owned by the same company that always has what I want and need. Sorry, Marshalls, but you're just OK to me.",2

407,"Service was slow, but that was because one of our party insisted that the bartender, her favorite server, serve us in our private room for a party of 8.  The food and drinks were good and we woud return.",4
408,"I am bummed about this- I had high hopes. Here's a rundown of the evening:\n\nPros:\n- super friendly waitress, Stephanie, who maintained her professionalism and friendliness throughout \n- yummy elderflower and pear beverage\n- lobster bisque was nice and lobster-y\n- hot delicious bread\n\nCons:\n- oysters were sketch. And I don't feel good about that. Stephanie brought us an order of East Coast oysters to replace the West Coast ones that we sent back.\n- fresh grated horseradish had NO flavor or heat- what's up with that?\n- scallops were meh- came with weird veggies, unevenly seared, and no real flavor. And at a whopping $25 a plate, I expect some nummers!\n\nI doubt we'll go back- for those prices, I would prefer McCormick's or Ruth's Chris.",2
409,Service an atmosphere was great. I had the shrimp boil and it was very under-seasoned. Much closer to bland than anything.,2
410,"I'm not a mean reviewer, if you look at the other places I've reviewed, but this was just so so so disappointing. The Shanghai style Merlin was very poorly done. The meat was extremely bland, with very little seasoning. I have a very low sodium tolerance and yet I still found this fish to be made too bland. The rice was entirely uncooked and it made crunching sounds as I took my first bite. I talked to the waitress and she offered to bring out another side. It wasn't the same. The whole dish was a fail and I don't think I am ever coming back again :(",1
411,"Will I come here again?  Yes absolutely for drinks, they knocked the Ketel One extra dirty blue cheese olive martini outta the park.  The ambiance is very nice.  Of the 4 types of reviews I give (awesome, OK, bad where they get slammed and bad where I hope they improve) here I am giving the heartfelt \""bad where I hope they improve.\""  Our waitress was very friendly and did a good job.  I mentioned the gritty redskins of the mashed potato.  We went with appetizers she recommended.  Not good.  \n\nSeared ahi tuna: horrible flavors mixed with the rub, the prep, the tuna wasn't cool inside, the chips were not good, there was no soy sauce but there was wasabi.  NOT good.  With heartfelt advice, compare this against Outback's ahi tuna appetizer and it's no contest.  The chef should do so.  (He's a nice guy like me I hope.)  \n\nBBQ shrimp: go try Redstone's (Philly) buffalo shrimp appetizer.  It is chilled, very delicious.  This appetizer was recommended and was garbage.  The barbecue sauce was horrible, overwhelmed and left an unsavory aftertaste in both my and my clients' palate.  Gordon Food Service or Sysco BBQ sauce.  A real \""must-miss\"".  \n\nCod entree was OK.  The skillet beans were too firm, too mature, they need petite green beans.  Potato skin had grit in the mashed.  Why 1 star?  The price was close to Capital Grille, but far from the cuisine.  I hope they spruce it up.  The place is nice.",1
412,"The service was mostly friendly but I was disappointed in my meal. My meal was way over cooked. The soda was flat and the carbonation needed changed and I felt like we inconvenienced our server by asking for new ones.  Overall, I thought it was mediocre and I was expecting more for the prices.",2
413,"The food was really good, but the prices were pretty high and the portions were on the small side. The desserts were the high point of the meal for me. I got the \""shark fin\"" pie and it was really good. The waitress thought I wouldn't be able to finish it... but I showed her. Take that, waitress.",3
414,"I have passed by this place a zillion times and never given it a second look.  I thought it might be a Red Lobster knock off.  Then I asked a friend if they had ever heard of it and they had, and liked it.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised by how nice the ambiance was inside.  Very cozy.  Much more upscale than I had thought it would be.  The service was terrific.  Lots of things to choose from on the menu.  A bit pricier than I had imagined.  Most entrees were anywhere from $17 to $30.  But this is Pittsburgh and this is seafood.\n\nThat said, they started us off with really delicious sour dough bread.  Butter was soft which I like.  Our entrees came pretty quickly.  I had a seafood assortment of blackened talapia, grilled sea scallops and salmon cooked on a plank.  The scallops were just done, I like them cooked a little more.  Everything else was pretty good.\nMy beloved had the crab cakes and really enjoyed them.\n\nWe'll probably be back, but will order something different.   We liked it.",3
415,"Food was only ok. Had lobster bisque soup not to good. Had the shang Hai Seafood Sampler. The scallops were hard, over cooked. The samon was good. Shrimp had no flavor. I will say the service was the best. Our waiter was great!!",2
416,"We had a bigger party and I think that might have flustered the waitresses just a bit. They forgot about our waters until the food came out, but were super apologetic when they did bring them. The food was ok. I ordered the crab cakes they were a bit heavy on the breading, so I would give them a rating of, \""eh\"". My friend ordered a steak, asked for medium rare, and it came out...well done. He was too hungry to complain and just ate it. We might go back again, and this time maybe take a bit more time looking over the menu.",3
417,Beautiful decor. Very genuine staff. Very clean washrooms. Delicious food. I tried the market trio. The blackened tilapia was nice with a little bit of spice. This is a great place for a seafood lover.,5
418,"My husband and I went to Mitchell's last summer for our wedding anniversary. We both took a half day at work and we arrived in the early afternoon (after lunch but before the dinner crowd). I can't say enough about this place...we have gone here on a few occasions and I've always been please with everything. \n\nPros: Nice friendly waitress, who took some time to take our picture (since it was our anniversary), food was excellent and not extremely overpriced, restaurant and bathrooms were clean!\n\nCons: None on this visit or any previous visits",5
419,"I have eaten some very good dinners here.  Although it's a chain, I would say it's several notches above the other chain restaurants.  The chef here seems to add some creativity to the menu, so I will be definitely back again soon.",3
420,"Went for dinner Friday evening with friends and sat at the outdoor patio. It is so nice and relaxing there with the river and bike trail. The sourdough bread they serve is always hot and fresh. The Chilean sea bass just melts in your mouth, it was awesome. The Cod stuffed with shrimp and lobster was also very good. I had the carrot cake for dessert, it is big enough for 3 people. It was so delicious. My friend had the creme  br\u00fbl\u00e9e, which she said was very good. I was here 3 times this summer and every meal was excellent.",5
421,"Top points. \nService. I was there with a large group for a meeting. They gave us a private room and two servers took care of us. They were efficient and very accommodating. Kudos. \n\nAppetizers: had the crab dip and calamari. Both were good. Servers brought extra chips with the dip as they were needed. I'm always surprised that more chips are not just added to the original dish at this point. Dip was good. Calamari was done well. Preferred the shrimp cocktail Sauce with it versus the Asian type soy sauce that is served with it. \n\nWedge salad with bleu cheese. Waaaaaay too much cheese and I like bleu cheese. \n\nI had the blackened tuna with mashed potatoes and seasonal veggies. Carrots were carrot sticks hardly cooked and dry! Green beans overdone and broccoli had seen better days. Simple green beans would have been more appetizing. \nTuna had blackening spices but needed a better sear on it. Was not over cooked. Potatoes as expected. \nOther dishes seen--fisherman's platter. Looked a little greasy, but that's expected from me in a full fried dish. Would be nice if this was offered broiled as well. Crab cakes and filet looked okay. \n\nOverall I'm always underwhelmed and overcharged here. I guess with chain places you get that, but I want more from a place that charges me 25 bucks for sub-seared tuna.",3
422,"My husbands first time.  Nice to be able to pick your fish and style of cooking.  I had a trio of Jamaican jerk tilapia,  salmon,  and scallops.  All good but too much sauce on scallops.  Husband had surf n turf special. Snow crab legs tasty but smaller portion than I expected. Glad they had raw oysters,  but no idea where they were from.  For $2.50 each you'd think they'd say.  Waitstaff friendly but inexperienced when it came to wine.  We taught two of them how to open a champagne bottle.  Nice time out,  but two gripes... #1 Used my phones flashlight to see if there was an outlet on the floor.  Felt like an archaeologist finding old remains of dinners gone by.  Crumbs,  napkins wedged between booth and wall,  gum,  dirt.  For the price I would expect a cleaner place. #2 our waiter kept saying Thank you. After every single sentence,  even when it wasn't appropriate.  Silly gripe,  right?  But it was way over the top and felt more like,  Can I have a tip?  Can I have a tip?",4
423,"In the Homestead area of Pittsburgh. Seafood gumbo was very good.\nBroiled scallops were very good, partner had sea bass stuffed with lobster, also very good. Vegetable sides were not as good as the fish. With two glasses of wine the total was $83. In and out in an hour.\nI'd go back because the fish was that good",4
424,"Very bad purchase experience. I bought a shirt with a hole covered in the rolled up sleeves, but they denied my request to return it. I am so angery at this and will never shop their chothes anymore.",1
425,"After further consideration, this store does not deserve a 4 star review. The Old Navy product has been pretty weak recently, which isn't the store's fault, but the severe lack of customer service doesn't help the situation. \n\nWhile shopping here on Friday, I was one of maybe 3-5 people in the store. I would practically walk into a sales associate but not even receive a glance or smile. No one working here seems to give an iota whether or not product is being sold. To avoid inconveniencing the associates, I will be taking my Old Navy purchases online in the future.",2
426,"I'm not too impressed with this particular Dick's Sporting Goods. It is in a great location in the Waterfront, but the selection seems a bit limited to me. They have what you need, but they don't have many options it seems.\n\nI went in there the other day and it looks like they also have a snowboarding section now, which they definitely did not have last season. They also have hunting, golfing and biking, in addition to the other regular deptartments. \n\nYour normal Dick's. Nothing spectacular, but it will do.",3
427,I don't see to many options in Pittsburgh for sporting goods. Dick's seems to be the big chain for sporting paraphernalia in this neck of the woods. Their selection is poor especially in the snowboarding and biking section. Maybe it's good for small children who want their first snowboard? It is a very average store with average products. I would like to see some attempt to carry more high end products. I am not into fishing or hunting live prey so I am not sure about these departments? I guess if you want some Under Armor products then this is the place to go because I see aisles upon endless aisles of these types of products.,2
428,"I enter every sporting goods stores as a soccer player, runner, and sports fan, so my reviews will always be skewed towards those particular areas. With that said, this is probably the worst Dick's location that I've ever been to. The selection is very limited for soccer gear, which must be a testament to the lack of the local customer base seeking out soccer gear. It's mostly low-end youth gear, too, which makes it nearly useless to adults or even some teenage soccer players.\n\nThe staff at this location has always been really nice, though, and it's the closest location to where we live, so I still end up going there quite a bit for running and clothing needs (of course, we usually leave empty-handed as they don't have what we're looking for). \n\nThey do have quite an extensive fan gear section if you're looking to support the local Pittsburgh teams, but this store just doesn't have the overall inventory necessary to be considered a \""good\"" Dick's location.",2
429,living alone I love the 5 for $20 deals they have on meat. I also love Faygo products when I have a party or bbq so their sales are always right on time. They don't have as many stores in the area but they are worth checking out. The lines are a lot shorter and the staff is a lot friendlier.,3
430,This store has changed hands many times over the past few years and it shows. Fifteen years ago if you didn't get there by 9am you would have fight a crowd. Now it never seems all that busy. Many of the store's best and dedicated employees left or were let go (about five years ago) and product lines change with each new owner. The most recent owner seems to be improving the store and employee turnover has seemed to slow.,3
431,A group of us traveld here to go kenneywood park across the road but we decided not to after what we drove throuhg to get there so we atleast decided to get somthing to eat and man where we happey to get out alive. We where the only normal people in this place. The kids next to us who where only 14 where bragging and saying that they went to jail 2 times in their life. You had people selling their food outsdie the resturant. after seeing that we quickly left and hid in our cars with the doors locked. While we where in there my friend got hit on by 2 girls and they gave him there numbers while the other young guy across the table yeld dont do it dont do it. Must I say more? bottom line is dont go if you are normal and get the hell out of that area cause if you call a shank a happey meal toy then that is the resturant for you.,1
432,"By far the worst McDonald's in the world.  Employees are to busy playing grab ass behind the counter, to get your order correct.  Ninety percent of the time you receive the wrong order, after waiting what seems an eternity.  I've even enjoyed the experience of going through the drive thru, only to get home and find no beef patties on my Big Mac.  Save yourself the aggravation, and do not go here.",1
433,"By far the absolute worst Mcdonalds in the\nWorld. You can pretty much rest assured that, after your long wait in the drive thru, your order will most definitely be wrong.  Calls to the owner go ignored. Rice Enterprises own a majority of the McDonalds in the South Hills.  They have all gone down hill in quality, service and cleanliness.  The owner has to be the problem.",1
434,Underated and ignored!  if you see this ol time pizzaria near Kennywood stop on by good crust nice and buttery in the sicilian style!  Better then DiSallas  the only thing I can say that is better then Latinas is Mineo's !  they say the best pizzarias are the little holes in the wall type places and this is one of those enviroments!  Small and cozy very nice and relaxing afternoon!  To just enjoy with yourself and a friend!,4
435,"This is the best experience I've had at a bike store in the Pittsburgh area.  I have been shopping around for a couple months for a new road bike (which was going to be my first road bike ever, meaning that I'm fairly clueless about how to pick one out).  Also, since I'm a student, I don't have particularly deep pockets.\n\nAt Big Bang, I was greeted basically the moment I walked in the door.  I'm kind of shy when I know that I don't really know what I'm doing, but I wasn't pressured or harassed in any way by the staff.  Even though my price range was pretty low, they still tried their hardest to find a bike that suited my needs, and they found a bike that fitted me perfectly (and gave me an *excellent* deal on the price).  They take a lot of care to make sure you're properly fitted to the bike.\n\nAlso, this is one of the few bike stores I've been to where test riding is gleefully encouraged, rather than grudgingly allowed.  Definitely it's the only bike store where they'll tell you \""You haven't tried it out enough, go climb up the hill on  it!\"" -- they definitely put the emphasis on matching rider with bike, rather than making a quick sale.\n\nI would definitely recommend this place to anyone who's looking for a road bike, whether they're a seasoned racer or a neophyte rider like me.",5
436,"I've had mixed results here. I would definitely recommend if buying a new bike, but have had much less success with items/parts I've ordered or with repairs.",3
437,"When I think BBB... I think the days of simply bringing your bike in for a quick and relatively inexpensive tune-up and a few fixes are long gone.    \n\nThis review is more for the repair end of BBB. In their defense BBB does appear to carry some amazing brands of bike (ie Colnago) that you just don't find anywhere else in Pittsburgh. \n\nAt BBB I was charged $250 for a tune up and a few other things. Granted this included installing a sew up tire (which I can understand would cost approx $50), Swapping out a left side (big ring) shifter on my down tube (this should have cost approx. $20 at most) and installing new bar tape (cost of tape $20 and $20 to install?).. SO WHAT\""S WITH $140 FOR A TUNE UP? Well the story goes like this:\n\nI bring the bike into BBB prior to the nice weather hitting Pittsburgh in hopes of trying what people have said is a great bike shop and getting my OCLV TREK 5900 ready for the season. Turns out I don't hear from these guys. A week goes by ...two weeks...I think that's ok I have two or three other bike I can turn to for a ride. Then I wind up going out of town for a week thinking for sure I'll get a call from them re: my bike is ready to roll...but no dice. So I call. Turns out a screw snapped when the mechanic was re-installing the down tube shifter and it had to be tapped out (is that my fault?). He says \""Should be ready in a few days\"". So I come in a few days later to this mammoth bill. I ask if I am paying for the labor of taping out the screw? I don't think I ever got a straight answer? I look at the bill and can't see a good breakdown of the charges. Normally I would \""duke it over\"" a bill like this but I figured...I had somewhere I to be 10 minutes ago and at least I finally have my bike. I would expect that for that money my bike could have been stripped down to the frame and totally gone over (overhauled). But it wasn't.  Well BBB I'll give you a star because the mechanic did do a good job in that my cycle shifts well and the tape job on the bars looks great (nice wrap). Plus I'll toss in a star for your outstanding selection of high end cycles. Maybe I would have rated BBB higher if I was in the market for a purchase instead of a simple repair?",2
438,"Bought a bike there on my second time in the shop.   Glen is very knowledgeable but can be a bit overwhelming, annoying and pushy, I can see how he can be very helpful to the average Joe, but if you are in his shop you should have done your homework, as this place is not walmart, mid to high level product here. I would encourage getting fitted and even buying a bike there, but going back for service is a whole different story.  Same day service is unheard of here, even for the simplest of adjustments, no service is available at all on the weekends.  the first time I took a bike there to have a rear derailer hanger replaced and re-adjusted (I had already purchased and had the hanger) 11 days went by before I returned to pick my bike up after not being called.  I figured it was just a fluke experience and gave them the benefit of the doubt.  The second time. I took a bike in to have a damaged shift lever replaced with a new 7800 pair. I called after 9 days and they said it wold be 2 days more.  when I showed up 2 days later it still wasn't done, it took 2 more following that, 13 days total.  Stay away from their service department",2
439,"Big Bang Bicycles is phenomenal! Amazing selection and service! I live in the San Francisco, Bay Area with plenty of premium bicycle shops available, but I do most of my cycling shopping at Big Bang Bicycles when I visit family in Pittsburgh. This shop carries top gear and has in stock tons of options so you can see, feel and evaluate them first hand to know what's going to give you the best feel and performance. Glenn, the owner, is very knowledgeable, friendly and you can feel his passion for cycling and making sure you get the right product and fit for you.  Even if you're not in the Pittsburgh area but you know what you want -- send your order to Big Bang Bicycles and I'm certain you'll have a great experience. Awesome shop! Thank you Glenn and team!",5
440,"Okay so I just moved to the outskirts of Duquesne, PA which is outside of Pittsburgh from Harrisburg, PA of all places. Where I am at, really there is no delivery but these guys did. They were nice and cordial and cheap but I have been spoiled by the pizza shop in Harrisburg, Downtown, run my an old world Italian guy named Luigi. That pizza is/was MILES better than this. This crust, while thin, did not have flavor and was hard. The slices were small for their 8 slice which I did like. The cheese was good. The sauce was meh. I've definitely had way better. 2 stars for being cheap and delivering.",2
441,Good pizza and i love the breadsticks...i don't know too much else about this place,3
442,"Pizza is very hit or miss. When the owners are there, it's really good. When they aren't, you get pizza that is over cooked (more like burnt) and LONG delivery times. The pizza, even when plain, is very greasy. Way more than other places around. Usually pizza that greasy is caused by low quality cheese. Also they do not take credit or debit cards. There are better options.",2
443,I have been looking for 3 years for good crab rangoon - I finally found it!!!  We had boneless ribs that were absolutely wonderful.  Definitely going back!!!,5
444,"Ok this is my first yelp review, I never left any reviews for other restaurants, but I am writing it because I want others to know about this place more.\n\nRestaurant run by family. very friendly, clean cooking environment, and Great food. I would come to this place again and again whenever I visit Pittsburgh.\n\nIts less than 10min drive from Kennywood, if you are visiting Kennywood you should definitely try this place.",5
445,"Came here from PGH for the first time.  This bakery is legit.  I bought some Rye bread and Italian 5 grain.  Delicious.  A strange snickerdoodle thing with pink frosting.  Delicious. Chocolate chip cookie dipped in chocolate, extra chewy and humongous.  Delicious.\n\nAnd a sweet old lady serving em up.\n\nThe best.\n\nDelicious.",5
446,"Love butter? Then get thee to Pierogies Plus.\n\nI live in St. Louis, and it seems like the only pierogi I can find are in my grocer's freezer. Oh, but when I go home to Pittsburgh, I can have as much of the chewy, flavorful, buttery goodness as I desire from Pierogies Plus.\n\nThe place still looks like an old service station with a tiny building and a roof over an old gas pump island. Inside, though, magical elves... uh... I mean fabulous Polish women... create deliciousness with love -- and butter. Have I mentioned that butter is a part of the deal? Because it totally is. You really should fast for two days before picking up pierogi from here.\n\nOh, but you'll be happy you did. I'm vegetarian, so I only order meat-free pierogi. I'm in love with the saurkraut and the cheese varieties. When you pick up a hot order, you'll get your pierogi covered in with rich butter and sauteed onions. No, I'm serious -- the pierogi are SWIMMING in butter. It's the best thing ever. Everything is packed inside a styrofoam container and a plastic bag, because butter WILL spill out.\n\nYou also can order cold or frozen pierogi if you plan to, say, lug them to the middle of the country to enjoy in a far-off city.\n\nBesides many varieties of pierogi, you also can get things from the deli cases. Last time, I had some apricot blintzes, a latke and some type of apple turnover thingy. I really hope Pierogies Plus has the blintzes when I visit next.\n\nAwesome thing: Pierogies Plus usually has coupons in the Entertainment Book. My best friend and I steal all of the coupons from our families so that I can get a steady stream of discounted Polish goodness each time I visit.\n\nThe only downside is that Pierogies Plus often closes for several days around holidays. I totally understand it -- family time is important! -- but that often coincides with my visits (I head east around the holidays mainly because I get an extra day with the fam without having to take another vacation day). I've learned to plan my trips around the Pierogies Plus schedule, though, because I MUST have yummy goodness. A pierogi-less Allison is a cranky Allison.",5
447,Well for my first time here I was way less than impressed. The lady at the front counter was a crab and  the Pierogies really weren't that great. Rather than be kind and answering my questions I settled with the potato and cheese pierogies. I guess Bloomfield Bridge tavern or Mrs. T's is still my go to place. And plus this place is way out of my way to be treated poorly. I wouldn't go back,1
448,"OMG good pierogis in a classic blue collar 'hood. At first glance, it looks like a place to get a flat fixed on your tire. Instead, I re-learn why I always avoid the corporate food franchises and seek places like this out. Just go there and eat whatever the nice woman behind the counter tells you to! It's well worth the mapquest ...",4
449,"Best pierogies in tahn!  \n\nI usually just go with the standard potato and cheese but I've also tried a few of the other pierogies and some of the plus.  These pierogies can't be beat.  Made by hand with love in the traditional old world style, I have yet to find better.\n\nIt's amazing to get there at 10:55am, 5 minutes before they open and see the mad rush of people getting pierogies.  By 11am, the line is already out the door.  Always a good sign.  They serve their pierogies hot, cold or frozen.  I always go with the hot because nothing beats pierogies bathing in butter and onions.  And here at Pierogies Plus, they are definitely worth the wait.",5
450,Just finished a dinner of pierogies that our Pgh family brought to WV - always look forward to Pierogies Plus - try the apricot for a sweet treet!,5
451,"The experience was not that great. The lady taking the orders was nice, but not helpful with what to order. The owner kept her back turn to us the entire time, based on the pictures and news articles I read about her I thought she would have been more social. To what really matters we got #2 sampler and order of jalape\u00f1o pierogies and the Ruben pierogies a lot of food for two guys. Really had no idea what to expect. Haluski was good, the pierogies came Luke warm and soaked in oily butter. Like the cab driver said you can find better. I'd pass on this spot.",2
452,Have been here two times after stopping at Mancini's Bakery. Have only had the Hamburger/Cheese/Bacon w/ fries but huge portions and great price. Great Quality also. Server is really nice also. Will be eating here again. Heard the Breakfast items are also great. Saw the waffles and pancakes....were huge!,4
453,"On a random Sunday morning I went in search of a good breakfast spot.  I decided to explore the McKees Rocks neighborhood and came upon Marge's Place.  I hadn't heard much about this place, but after reading the few reviews I could find, I decided to give it a try.  \n\nInside, it's bigger than I expected but still has that down home diner feel.  My guess is that most of the people there were regulars.  The wait staff was friendly to those they knew but also welcoming to me, someone they had never seen before.  I picked a table in the corner so I could observe what I imagine was a typical Sunday morning.  I ordered the breakfast special: 2 scrambled eggs with bacon, potatoes and toast.  Any place that has Mancini's Italian toast already gets thumbs up in my book.  Being in McKees Rocks, though, they really don't have a choice.  The potatoes were thin sliced with onions and very flavorful.  The only way I can think of to describe the bacon is...porkier.  Is that even a word?  I just don't know how else to descibe it.  The combination of foods was served in generous portions at a great price (under $5).  \n\nOne random note: I liked the tables and chairs.  They were comfortable not just for sitting and enjoying a cup of coffee with my morning paper but also very comfortable for sitting and eating.  Good distance between the table and chairs.  That may sound silly, and I thought so, too, at first.  But when I go to a place and the booth is too wide or too narrow, it can hinder my enjoyment.  \n\nNot only will I return, but I will also recommend Marge's Place to anyone in the area.  It was a surprisingly good find.  I like places like neighborhood businesses like this where they make everyone feel like they belong.",5
454,"Very quaint! Stopped here for lunch while traveling for work, and I felt like I was in a diner in the 1950s. Had a grilled cheese and fries - the food was good and everyone was friendly.",4
455,"Great service, friendly staff, great food, great prices. What more can you ask for in a small town breakfast place? Will definitely be back",5
456,"They do great quality work. The only reason I did not give them five stars is for their lack of customer courtesy not once but twice. I am a very patient and understanding person, but being rude twice means you dont want my business and I tipped 20%.",2
457,ewwww,1
458,"It wasn't a busy night at the neighborhood, but you could have been fooled by how long the food took.  While it did take a while everyone was extremely friendly.  The food did come out hot, at least mine did, the rest of the plates were plate-warmer hot.  Everyone in the table resented me for \""holding back\"" the table since they staff pointed out they were waiting on my burger.\n\nWhich hey works as a segway onto the burger.  Quesadilla Burger.  I knew that was a mistake but I did it anyways.  The patty was sorta flavorful.  The toppings were in the bland category.  Cheese went MIA.  And the tortilla were over-toasted and tasteless.\n\nA big blah overall, which is sad, since we've had a grand ole time and good food in past visits.",2
459,"Called for an arrangement for pickup, told the person who took my order that I would be able to pick the arrangement up at 5:30pm.  She asked if I could get there any earlier, I said I would try my best, but I work until 5pm, so maybe not.  She said ok.  \n\nComes to be 5pm and I get a call from a guy at the shop asking where I was!  The lady who took my order wrote down that I'd be there at 5pm.  I explained that I never said that and picked the arrangement up a little before 5:30pm.  \n\nArrangement was just OK.  I specifically wanted a lot of orange flowers, which they did, but they added strange colors with the orange... and some of the flowers were already a little wilted.  \n\nEven though the location is convenient, I will probably go elsewhere for a flower order next time.",2
460,The order process went well and the delivery arrived in a timely manner. I saw a picture of the flowers my friend received and the arrangement  wasn't even close to what was pictured on the website...a lot more filler flowers despite ordering the premium arrangement. I picked this place specifically because of what they offered despite other cheaper places in the area. I am disappointed because I wanted the best arrangement possible for my friend who is going through a tough time. \n\nI will not order from this place again.,2
461,"Meh. I've ordered from here twice and not really been enthusiastic about the results either time. Keep in mind that I haven't had pizza from this place yet!\n\nTheir steak hoagie is middling-good; nothing to write home about, but a pretty good example of the standard Pittsburgh pizza place steak hoagie.\n\nThe seafood calzone is another story. Something in it was so bitter I couldn't quite eat it; I'm wondering if it was the garlic or perhaps a leftover burnt taste from the oven. Whatever it was, it was gross. The shrimp weren't that good either, suffering as they did from that certain \""I taste like iodine\"" flavor.\n\nThe advantage to R&B is that they're open reasonably late, given the location, but the phone service is rather surly and it always takes them an hour plus to deliver. Which would be OK if I didn't live a block away (normally I'd just walk and pick it up, but just for you, Yelpers, I subject myself to the vagaries of sitting on my rear end on the couch waiting for my food to arrive).",2
462,A great little place. Delicious and affordable Italian food. Great salads and pasta. Try the pizza rolls!,4
463,"I stopped by here this past Tuesday in order to pick up a to go pizza.  My fiance, a friend and I were trying pizza from three different places and Luigi's was one of them.  I have driven by Luigi's many times before and for some reason had never stopped in but that did allow it to come to mind whenever I was looking for a pizza place I had not yet tried in the Bellevue area.  Whenever I called to place my order I was told that my pizza would be ready in about 15 minutes.  I arrived closer to 30 minutes later and was immediately confused whenever I walked into the restaurant.  You see there was a large dining room on the left that was full of people and I didn't immediately see the are where I would get my pizza from.  Finally after a few steps into the restaurant I noticed that the whole back area of the restaurant was where I needed to be and I made my way back there.  My pizza was ready for me and I quickly paid and was leaving whenever the cashier told me \""Stay out of trouble\"".  I really hope that was a friendly sentiment and not one that was based upon my appearance or anything else.  The pizza itself had a medium thick crust with a bland sauce which is weird since I could see a ton of green herbs in it.  The cheese was just ok and nothing special while the pizza itself had a slightly sour taste to it which I did not enjoy.  Out of the three different pizzas we ate that night this one was overwhelmingly our least favorite which was evidenced by the fact that 3/4 of it was left after the evening.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I will probably not head back to Luigi's in the future.  I just don't see myself making a trip to Luigi's between the weird experience (although not bad) that I had in the restaurant and the fact that there are much better pizza places nearby.",2
464,Luigi's pizza is amazing! The sicilian pizza takes me back to how my grandma used to make homemade pizza. I can't wait to go back - definitely worth the 45-minute trip there :),5
465,"Recently I've found myself patronizing Bellevue a little more, namely because I've bought a house in the area, and have been checking out some of the mom and pops along the little strip of Mayberry RFD that is the quaint main street. Luigi's is one of those little mom and pops that offers standard basic Italian in a comfortable setting. It's a little kitchy, red-white-and-green, with Dino and Frankie tunes playing in the background.\n\nI've stopped in on several occasions now for dinner, with various friends, and the food has been consistent...it's good...satisfying. Not over-the-top gourmet, or even in the remotest sense 'pretentious'. It's just a good ol' night out for some pasta or lasagna, with a side salad, garlic bread and conversation with your pals.\n\nThe portions are ample, the prices are reasonable, the flavors won't knock your socks off and make you think you've died and gone to Sicily, but they won't make you cringe at having given your money to a profiteering Chef Boyardee either. The service is decent, kind of point blank, not rude, nor over the top friendly. \n\nThe crowd can fluctuate between 'Oh my god, I'm surrounded by Hillbillies' to 'the local gathering at Mayberry', but that seems to be the norm for most places in da burgh.\n\nI've not had the pizza, which apparently get raves, because frankly I only think of pizza as coming in a box to my front door when I'm too lazy to do any cooking at home. But I've had three or four of the pasta dishes, and they come in a generous portion, with a side salad and an order of garlic toast. They taste fine, fill you up, and don't break your bank.\n\nAnd for a local neighborhood joint, that's exactly what I'd hope for. A place you can go to find a dependable and reasonable meal, on a semi-regular basis, in a comfortable setting, with no frills or pretense. \n\nAnd that is exactly what Luigi's is.",3
466,I stop by here frequently when I am on my way to work for breakfast. The drive thru is fast but they do tend to get the order wrong. But I will say that I have had more free meals here due to them comping me for all messed up orders. \n\nThe staff is friendly.,3
467,"I have never gotten an order correct from this specific McDonald's. I'm not sure what the problem is, but it is never, ever right. It is never quick. The staff is always rude. After trying at least 12-15 times over the past year, I've finally given up hope on this place. Do not recommend.",1
468,My orders have come out bad pretty much every time I have ordered from here. The chicken nuggets come out under par. I'm lucky if the fries come out right. My last experience is the last straw. I recently posted a photo of my Chicken Ranch Club. That has no chicken. This is ridiculous. I am done going to this Mcd's.,1
469,"Delivery is slow and not even close to the best Chinese in the area.  No matter if it's rice or noodles or chicken or pork, everything tastes off--like it's been overcooked in mop-bucket-water.  Try House of Lee instead.",1
470,"Wow. What a shame. My family just moved to the area and have been sampling the local cuisine. We are a very large family and love foods of all kind. We've eaten Chinese food from a hundred different places in a dozen different cities. Hands down, this was the worst we've ever had. Cold, tough, congealed, and tasteless - that's the only way to describe it. I'll never order from here again. Quite frankly, the fact that I took time away from my kids to type this out should tell you how awful it was. My complaints fell on deaf ears. I guess they were shocked that someone thought that they were serving low grade dog food. I understand that sometimes restaurants crank out bad food. It happens. But when it does, you bend over backwards to make it right. Not at this place. I was told that he would have to speak with the owner in order to help me. I guess that's how they deflect complaints - blame it on the owners that aren't there and make the customer for away angry.  Too bad. Because we will be visiting a competitor in the future. This family of 7 won't be visiting China Sea ever again. Oh, and by the way, why can't I give this place zero stars?",1
471,"The pros:\nYou get a TON of food for your money. If the food was actually decent, this would have been even better because... LEFTOVERS. \nThey have coupons on their website that you can use whenever. \n\n\nThe cons:\nThe woman who answers the phone is kinda rude. You try to ask her questions and she gets an attitude with you like you're wasting her time. \nMy pork dumplings were \""fried\"" only on one side and were raw in the middle. \nEverything was pretty darn salty. Yeah, I get it. Chinese food tends to be a little salty, but this was unacceptably salty. \nLeftovers... Yes this is also a con because I threw it away. Suffering through it once was enough! \n\nIf you're craving something made fresh that is spicy and sweet, you're not going to find it here. Just very greasy, very salty, poor excuse for Chinese takeout.",1
472,"We ordered from here because Uncle Chen, our go-to takeout place down the road, was closed. \n\nI ordered the General Tso tofu, a favorite dish of mine, and hubby ordered the beef Mei Fun noodles. We always grab some egg rolls too. The lady on the phone wasn't rude, per se, but she wasn't exactly helpful or answering any of my questions, either (hubby wanted to see about getting a different sauce on his noodles, and I had to ask a few times before she finally answered my question about how large the tofu dish was). I was in a good mood though, so the attitude over the phone didn't bother me. Price was good, typical takeout rates. The good news is that they will allow you to pay with credit cards over the phone, so if you're like me and never carry cash, you can still get delivery. She told me 45 minutes for the food.\n\nThe food arrived in about 20 minutes (we live half a mile away), it was hot and smelled great. Hubby's Mei Fun looked typical, but he was saddened to see that they didn't exchange the white sauce for brown sauce. The beef was pretty mushy, and didn't taste all that great. The veggies were fresh, and pretty crispy even after soaking in sauce. Noodles were alright, nothing to write home about. My General Tso tofu was delicious, and tasted exactly like the dish I was craving. Fried to perfection, perfect-sized pieces of tofu, and a fantastic sauce. The broccoli was fresh and tasted good. This particular dish only came in one size: Enormous. I think hubby and I just ended up sharing my meal, paired with some mediocre egg rolls.\n\nSo, long story short, lady on the phone was a bit irritating, delivery was fast, food was fresh, and, depending on what you order, the food quality ranges from so-so to great. If you're looking for a quick fix to your Chinese food craving, this is a good place to order from, although I'll be going back to Uncle Chen before I try China Sea again.",3
473,"If you have any common sense at all, please don't stay here.  Once, it almost burnt down...and I'm pretty sure most of the locals were chanting \""burn, baby, burn.\""",1
474,"Horrifying.  This place should be ashamed of itself.  DO NOT STAY HERE.  Beyond dirty, just absolutely rank.",1
475,came back to Pittsburgh for a wedding and couldn't find anything in my price range close to the city until i found this motel...it was very affordable....room was okay...cable tv and a/c worked fine....,4
476,"OMG who wrote the review below? A big fat liar/someone that was paid to write that! I stayed there for an hour this past weekend (my friend and I were both intoxicated and figured laying down a few hours would get us better suited to finish driving home). This place looks like it hasb't been cleaned (or furnished) since the 80s. Literally there was grime on the walls, and squashed, unwiped bug smears too. Ok, so not the best, but for two hours, we could deal. We looked for bed bugs, and didn't see any immediate signs of them- so we laid down to rest. After about 20-30 minutes, we both started itching like crazy. I ran to the bathroom mirror (there was mold all over the bathroom) and saw bed bug bites all on my shoulders, arms, and legs. HORRIBLE!! PLEASE Health Department, shut them down! It's deplorable in there!!",1
477,"I was in need of a pedicure before my beach vacation, so I decided to stop in to Star Nails in Bellevue. I've never had a pedicure before, mostly because I'm super-ticklish, but I felt like it was about time.\n\nThe salon looks quite nice inside; wood (well, laminate) floors, clean decor, and four pedicure chairs up on the platform on the right. I didn't have an appointment, and waited about ten minutes on a Wednesday evening.\n\nNancy was my nail technician, and she greeted me warmly and helped me over into the pedicure area. Pro tip: Don't wear a past-knee-length skirt, as it can make straddling the foot bath to get into the chair slightly awkward. Nancy helped me out like a pro and I was all set.\n\nThe pedicure chairs have a massage feature that reminded me of the Migun massage tables. They don't just vibrate; they knead. The controller is right next to you, so you can stop and start as you like. I just made sure the thing kept running the whole time. The foot bath was nice and warm. I'd brought a book to keep myself busy but turns out all my attention was occupied by relaxing.\n\nNancy guided me through the steps and the slight language barrier isn't much of a problem. She completely understood that I was super-ticklish from the flinching involved, and somehow managed to be very careful about it. It wasn't at all unpleasant, which is what I'd kind of expected.\n\nThis is the awful TMI section, so avert your ayes if you are at all sensitive. Since I've never had a pedicure and I tend to walk around either barefoot or in thin-soled shoes, I had quite a lot of callus built up. The removal was kind of disgusting, so I just didn't look, but it didn't hurt at all. I also tend to ingrown toenails on both big toes, and she dealt with them gently and quickly. I was a bit concerned about having that done at a salon, but it's a week later and my toes haven't turned gangrene, so all's well that ends well.\nEND TMI\n\nEven though it wasn't the spa pedicure (not sure what else THAT involves), I got a full foot and calf massage. Polish on and all done! At which point I thought I might as well get a manicure, too.\n\nThe manicure involved heated mitts and a hand massage, and was very nice. Total cost was $37 plus tip (I gave her $10 for having to deal with my nasty feet). I had some fun conversations with other patrons, and overall a great experience. I'd go back once a day if it were in any way reasonable to do so, but this is getting placed on the once-a-month schedule for sure.\n\nThe polish from the pedicure is still holding up like a champ after a week. The manicure was pretty well shot after a couple of days, so I'll probably just stick with doing the polish at home, although I can't complain about the massage and cuticle care.\n\nAgain, I don't have other salons or spas to compare with, but it seemed like a good, basic service with a few little extras. The staff were all friendly and remembered the repeat customers who came in. They do take credit cards, and you can put the tip on the card as well; I brought cash for that as I am not used to salons taking tips on cards.\n\nThey also offer acrylics (which I don't do), gel nails (which I'd like to try), and nail art. I'm not sure if they do waxing. I am sure that it's a friendly place, that it's clean (important!), and that they made me feel relaxed even though I was beyond nervous going in.",3
478,"My Mom was up from Mississippi for Thanksgiving, and claimed to be in dire need of a manicure. I wanted to try somewhere in my new 'hood (Brighton Heights), so I turned to trusty Yelp for advice. Off to Star Nails we went. The inside was bright and tidy, the pedicure stations looked clean and newer, and the ladies were friendly. Unfortunately, the good feelings didn't last long. We each picked a color, and went to our respective technicians. The technician doing my nails as very nice and talkative, but just very inattentive to detail. I got no hand/arm massage, minimal shaping, and the polish application was exceptionally sloppy and thick. Her attempts to clean up the polish all over my cuticles were futile. Their actual technique was strange too, as both technicians had us dry our nails after the first coat was applied. My Mom and I left and almost in unison declared it to be the worst manicure we've gotten. At least the price wasn't exorbitant ($13 + tip each). Perhaps their other services are better, but I'll be giving the other nail shops in the area a chance next time.",2
479,"I got a pedicure here. Not bad, they were pretty thorough. But two days later both of my big toes were infected and oozing pus where she trimmed my toenails on the sides (which was weird anyway). I hate to rate a local shop down, but man my toes hurt.",1
480,"This is my favorite 'event' restaurant (by which I mean, spendy, but definitely worth it for special occasions).  It is great for intimate birthdays, celebrations, etc.  Whatever karmic intervention gave the 'Bustling Borough of Bellevue' this restaurant makes me think we, as a community, has done something right. \n\nBut more importantly the food...  Oh, the food!  The owner/chef takes so much care, it makes the whole experience very enjoyable.  I have never had a bad meal.  \n\nI",5

482,"STAY AWAY, the owners are so rude, they blatantly say they are not doing well and then try to pretend they have the best hairdressers in Pittsburgh. they make you feel so unwelcome, advertise they offer a bunch of services and then when you ask they snap at you that they only do hair.  it was so awkward and weird .  i received warnings not to get my hair done there so i was going to get a pedicure because i had a gift certificate.  she told me her employees will only take cash if they have to touch a client's feet.  I may go there just to get bangs trimmed since i do not want to completely waste the certificate, but this place gives me the creeps, sounds dirty, and has beyond bad customer service.  They definitely do NOT know how to run a business and it is obvious why they are not doing well. Sue and Kristi pass the phone back and forth because noone wants to take a call.  she reiterates that the business is doing bad and they need more clients.  i have never experienced a ruder salon, or should i say dead beat shack.",1
483,"I think it is ridiculous that they say they need more clients!  I was all ready to be a new client.  I had a 12:30 appointment with them, and when I arrived at 12:30 on the dot, the place was locked and dark and no one was there!  I waited for five minutes (in the rain), and they still didn't show.  I called and left a voicemail saying that I was still willing to wait, and I understood if there was some confusion, but could they call my cell (I gave them the number, as I had previously given my home number when I made the appointment).  I waited nearby at a coffee shop, went back after another five minutes, and it was still locked and I hadn't received a call.  And I am definitely not estimating the time, either.  I was willing to wait a bit, and I looked very closely at the time on my phone to be sure that I wasn't jumping the gun on calling and then leaving.  Finally, I went on with my day and when I got home, they had left a voicemail on my HOME PHONE, which I had specifically asked them not to call, saying, \""Oh hi.  Sorry you missed me, but I was MAYBE two minutes late at the most.  I hope you haven't left, but you should just call back to reschedule.'  Seriously?  When I was waiting, another woman came to the door.  I thought she worked there, but she was just another client, also trying to get in!  When I told this story at another local business, the women there said that I was probably the fourth person who had had this same experience at this place.  I couldn't believe it.  This place is the worst, and I have never even stepped inside!",1
484,"Now I'm picky about my hair, but Mane Attractions was so bad that I walked out after about 15 minutes of watching the stylists work on other clients.\n\nI had desperately needed a haircut and walked in for a major trim and re-shaping of my layers.  First, the girl at the counter said my hair might be \""difficult\"" due to the length (it was nearly long enough to sit on at the time) and that I would probably have to stand while it was cut.  Weird, but okay.  Second, no one there knew anything about donating to \""Locks of Love,\"" and I feel like salons should be aware of things like that.  I needed a cut so I went for it anyway.\n\nI watched the two stylists while I waited for my turn.  One stylist told the client whose hair she was cutting that she was going to do something other than what they discussed because it \""wasn't looking right.\""  Ummm, okay.  The other stylist was too busy checking her phone every three seconds to notice she was yanking on her client's hair so hard with the comb that she was giving her poor client whiplash.\n\nAt that point, I just pretended like I had received an urgent text and said, \""I have to leave, so sorry \""as I bolted for the door.",1
485,"Let me just tell you, I have really, really difficult hair.  type 3b Naturally curly, 100% grey, I dye it dark and mess with the color myself. ( never good)  If you want to know where to get a good haircut you ask someone with my hair. Since I have been going to Mane Attractions I have really LOVED my hair. I have been going there for about 4 years. Kristi was even able to cut my curly hair into a short reverse bob without making me look like i was wearing a helmet. ( you curly girls know what I am talking about). I have had nothing but complements on my hair and even my mom( who is always honest) is impressed. The only complaint I ever have is that yes, sometimes I have gone there on the spur of the moment and it has been closed during the week. I just know to call and schedule things. it is a small business and I get it.  P.S. kids haircuts are only 10$ and My daughter loves it.",5

487,"Lincoln Bakery is yet another local bakery I've been meaning to try.  When a Google Offer came up, I took it so I would have no excuse to keep avoiding it.  The place has a nice neighborhood bakery feel; as I took in the many selections it seemed that everyone who came in was a regular.  There weren't many people when I was there (it was still relatively early) but I got the impression that at times there can be a line to the door.  \nOne thing that I didn't like was although they had many pastries to choose from, nothing was labeled.  So I had to keep asking what things were.  The cinnamon roll was okay, nothing spectacular.  But the pastries I got were very good.  I'd recommend checking it out.  I know if I'm ever in the neighborhood I will stop in for a treat myself.",3
488,Cookies aren't bad.  Haven't had a reason to buy cakes or other pastries.  Staff is friendly and it smells like heaven.,3
489,"Lincoln Bakery makes very delicious donuts, pastries, and desserts. Their bread selection, however, was very limited and upon making our choice the quality of the bread was mediocre. We were also disappointed that many of the things in the shop are not labeled and when the store is busy it can be difficult to find staff to explain what different options are. Still, this should be a go to for a local bakery if you are looking for something sweet.",4
490,"Got a key lime pie from this place. It was horrid. Icing was stale cake thick, crust was not even crunchy or had taste, and the key lime was weak. Pie looked it it was sitting out for a day or 2.",1
491,Everytime I eat at this location I end up with a sick stomach.  I don't have that problem at other Arby's.  The dining area is clean and everything else seems ok but I always get a sick stomach.  Maybe they should relook at their food prep.,2
492,"So I came to this Red White and Blue with high hopes of thrift store mecca, and I will get to how I left empty handed and in tears.  First, I'll walk you through my experience. \n This place is pretty large, and relatively clean, with a nice parking lot.  The racks are packed with clothes - and I mean, hard to move the hangers because there is so much stock, which can be a pro or a con depending on how you like it.  I found it a bit cumbersome since although the clothes are organized by type (dress vs. blouse) there is NO size separation.  In a place this huge, it takes quite a long time to find what you're looking for without the size separation.  But, I'm not one to abandon a bargain because I don't want to look around (after all, that is what its all about), so I gave a good 30 min-45 and got a handful of garments to try on.  (I would typically spend a few hours, but I was trying to spare a friend not as keen on secondhand garments).  With my carefully extracted finds I searched in vain for a fitting room, never to find one.  After asking the staff where it was, I had to take a seat and leave my jaw dropped for a while because THERE IS NO FITTING ROOM! \nI couldn't take this fact into my brain, and although there were some household items I wanted to go back and buy, I was too upset to continue.  (Sidenote: yes, I can understand how this can work for the RWB, but imho it is unforgivable, and I wish there was at least some warning before spending my time searching for a bargain when I couldn't even see if it would fit). \n\nI would recommend this store if you are looking for something specific secondhand especially for dishes, or older electronics, or even beauty products.  There was even a used Nikon SLR with a wide angle lens ($200 though)!  \nBut if you plan on buying a sundress, and don't plan on stripping down in front of your fellow thrifties, you'd better be confident in your purchase.  RWB is just like any other thrift store, and you can't return or exchange your items, so you'd be out of luck and out of money.",2
493,"Woo Hoo!  Dead Lady.\n\nThis thrift store rocks.  I have been doing this for more years that I haven't been, and it is the best in the city.\n\nI would make a weekly trek to RWB, and would never be disappointed.  These were the days when you could find a vintage 50s something or other on the racks, before there was a \""Vintage\"" section.  Still, recently, there is always a treasure to be had, especially in the housewares department.  The proximity of this thrift store to the affluent neighborhood of Sewickley accounts for its top-notch merch.  Whenever we'd have a particularly good day, my frends and I would joke...\""dead lady.\""",5
494,"I came here all the time while I was freelancing and in charge of my own schedule.  It has a lot of points going for it that other thrift shops consistently mess up.\n\n1. It's well lit.  You can SEE the clothing, see whatever might be wrong with it, and make an honest assessment.  You're never surprised when you leave at the state of the items you've just bought.\n\n2. It is surprisingly clean.  Nothing seems to smell, so I can only imagine they've laundered everything thoroughly. \n\n3. There are good quality brands--Ann Taylor, Kenneth Cole, etc.  It's mainly items along these lines.  You're more likely to find twinsets than clubbing tops here, which if you're over the age of 21 is a good thing.\n\n4. Markdowns and fresh merchandise.  These people *know* how to turn over their stock.  Because the place is never empty, and there are specials every day, the stock flips rapidly.  The merchandise is never the same week to week, so as I mentioned before, it's addictive.  You never know what you'll find.\n\nA summary of a few things I've bought here: a 6 dollar designer knit dress, a few silk twinsets ($2-$5), countless heels, two pairs of Birkenstocks and two pairs of Doc Martens ($4-$8), a dressmaker's bust ($5), a pressure cooker ($7)....\n\nYou get the picture.  The prices aren't rock bottom, but close enough, and the quality of the clothing will help anyone but the stingiest person get over the 50 cents extra.\n\nCan't recommend it enough!",5
495,"Simply the best thrift store I've ever been to. Well worth the 3 1/2 hour drive from my hometown.\n\nFirst, and foremost, EVERYTHING IS 1/2 off all of the time!\n\nSecondly, bring cash. They DO NOT accept credit cards.\n\nThe store is full of wonderful pieces of clothing, all arranged by color and type (not by size, which is unfortunate). I found a wide selection of everything from casual pieces to high-end business attire to super-trendy teen clothing... what surprised me most about this store was the QUALITY of the clothing. Almost all of the pieces were flawless, a few were worn or faded in some way and the price reflected that. Brand names were bountiful; Banana Republic, Ralph Lauren, Chico's, Jones New York, Ann Taylor, American Eagle, H&M. There were also some wonderful vintage pieces from the 80s, bright colors and crazy shoulder pads that would have made a more adventurous fashionista very happy indeed!\n\nThe clothing smells wonderful, not musty or dirty as in some thrift stores, and there was even a large selection of plus-sized clothing carefully culled out in a special section.\n\nI went to Red White & Blue to find some business attire for my new job, and came home with two gorgeous, flawless statement blazers from Ann Taylor Loft and Banana Republic... for a total of $7!\n\nCome to this thrift store; it'll make all other shopping obsolete!",5
496,"I cannot imagine a more miserable place to shop than this jam-packed monstrosity.  This is a store that makes me thankful for Goodwill and The Salvation Army resale stores.  The customers and the staff are miserable at Red White and Blue.  The clothes are priced far higher than other such shops.  Merchandise is not refundable or exchangeable, and there are no fitting rooms!  One purchases clothes at their own risk!  What person would buy a suit under these conditions, hoping the pants will fit?  Unlike other stores, there is no senior discount and no credit cards accepted, a rare cash only business.  To the reviewer who boasts that everything is 50% off every day, how is that a sale?  It is bogus pricing.  Red White and Blue, uggh!",1
497,"Ever shopped at a Thrift Shop that sells high end labels, some brand new and gently used items like backpacks for $5? This is a great place to discover unique things.

498,"Love the store. Great stuff, High price. Buyer BEWARE of the RUDE cashier SYLVIA, extremely unpleasant, unwilling to help and always with NEGATIVE attitude.

499,"I love a deal, and this has been my favorite thrift store since I was a kid.  \n\nFirst, there is some sort of half-off deal every day.\n\nSecond, the used book selection is pretty decent.  Yeah, there are a ton of self-help and Patterson mass markets that you have wade through, but T.C. Boyle for two bucks?  Yes, please.\n\nThird, the home goods.  I've gotten huge solid wood picture frames for only a couple dollars.  The art prints inside were hideous...but I threw those away, re-stained the frames to my liking, cut new mats, and inserting art quoted as $360 each to frame at a big chain fabric store for under $30.  Boom.\n\nFinally, there is a decent selection of lamp to re-wire, always lot of furniture, some diamond in the rough clothes on occasion, and lots of other wacky stuff that's just fun to sift through.\n\nCASH ONLY and the cashiers are pretty rude/lazy, but that never bothers me.\n\nBONUS:  They pick up your donations for free from your porch.  http://www.pickupplease.org/  Super easy.",5
500,Prices not great for true thrifters. Staff completely useless. No dressing rooms. I simply have nothing to say about this place.,2
501,"I love love LOVE this store. I thought the one on Saw Mill Run was great but this was i think is way awesomer. If only awesomer were a word. I love to go here and find lots of home decor items to decorate my house. candle holders, DIning sets, paints, sculptures and sooo much more. I found this small desk lamp that has a victorian look to it with the shade included for $4. The lamp shade was made of some kind of smooth material almost like leather. It's such a great find. There are plenty of items for sale at this place and most of them are in great shape. \n\nSo the clothes which occupy most of the store are the best find. The Store has certain days that offer you %50 certain color tags. I went on a Monday and it was half off yellow and white tags. Other days its half off blue, or green or red. I love to go on Saturdays!! This past week it was half off every tag except white. I found so many items for such a cheap price. $7 shirts for $3.50 and tunics for $4. Have you ever find items for $1?? I have!!! I love when I find a great shirt or sweater for $3 or less. Or when you find a brand new item with the tags on them for under $7. I bought a brand new pair of Arizona Jeans (in my size) for $5. I couldn't believe it. I was too excited.\n\nThe clothes are organized by color but not by size which is a good and bad thing. I like to shop by color since I don't wear too many yellows or purples. I can avoid those sections all together but when I do find a nice shirt in the color I want the size becomes an issue. There were a lot of nice shirt that were just too small or too big. Even when i have to pass on a nice shirt I tend to find one that's just as good at the same price. \n\nShopping here is a gold find!! My sister was the one who introduced me to this store and i used to make fun of her for shopping thrift. If I had known that It was nothing like the Good Will I would have been here a lot sooner. Now my sister makes fun f me for going so often. What an amazing place this is!! I'll probably never shop retail again!!\n\nREMINDER: CASH ONLY!!\n-But they have an ATM!! $2.50 fee",5
502,"I can't believe I've been here multiple times and haven't reviewed it yet.  I absolutely love this place.  It's a super thrift store if you will.\n\nNo matter when I come here, I always find something.  It quite the experience.  I always make sure it's a day when I am off of work because I can literally spend hours here just looking.  It's a good thing that I do this, you can't just show up here and think that you will be able to gran an item and then leave.  \n\nLike a fellow reviewer said, there are not fitting rooms here, so be prepared to walk into someone trying on a potential great new garment for them self in the middle of an aisle.  Sometimes you just can't avoid this, I blame the fact that they have mirrors set up throughout stores.\n\nThey have everything you can seem to desire here.  Clothing to electronics, furniture to bedding, books to movies.  EVERYTHING is under this roof.\n\n*Cash only, ATM on premise.",4
503,"This thrift store is one of the best in Pittsburgh; it's huge and has a great selection of books, clothes and housewares.\n\nWith that being said, there are a number of drawbacks to shopping here because of its popularity. It starts with the parking. There are a few spots in front of the store, with two \""overflow\"" lots that quickly fill up. Getting out is a bear if you're heading back towards the city, like I usually am, because to pull up to the traffic light you have to go the wrong way through the very narrow parking area in front of the store. Crossing three lanes on 51 without the help of a traffic light just seems like a bad plan.\n\nOnce inside the store, beware of other customers on the weekends. I've encountered aggressive shoppers on multiple occasions who are usually welding carts as weapons. Let's just say some shoppers think it's OK to block off entire aisles so they can peruse a section.\n\nOther notes: There are no fitting rooms. I sometimes try on clothes over the ones I'm wearing in front of a mirror, because hey, it's a thrift store.\n\nAlso, they're cash only.\n\nDespite these setbacks, I find myself coming back every few months because I've found some really awesome things here, from dresses to plates. Just think of the trip as a little adventure.",4
504,nice and clean with well organized large selection but was expensive. I was looking for some twin size thin cotton blankets easy to wash and hang dry for my dog and the prices were $14.99 of course somewere high quality items which u would have to pay new retail store price $40-50 but still overpriced. I finally found a small blanket for $7 on sale.,3
505,"The home-cooked breakfasts at The Rusty Nail in Bellevue are wonderful, prices are reasonable, the wait staff are gems, and is often bragged about by Bellevue locals.  That said, two stars is all I can muster primarily due to the tiny, cramped dining area.  I've witness people at three tables being disrupted while they are eating so departing diners would have enough room to push their chair away from the table and pass by others just to leave.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I adore that Pittsburgh is a small, friendly city, but I'm not fond of getting elbowed in the back as the guy behind me cuts his breakfast steak and eggs, nor knowing his guest gargled with Cool Mint Listerine this morning (or worse, didn't) .  Yes, the tables are packed THAT close together.  And whatever you do, don't dare bring a large friend here to dine when it's busy unless you enjoy feeling like a complete 'jag off' for doing so on the way out.",2
506,"I've been going here since I was a wee tot.  I have always enjoyed their food even though there's nothing too special about it.  I really like their breakfast menu.  You always seem to get lots of food for very little money, which is nice.  \n\nMy only complaint is that it is WAY TOO SMALL and always very busy.  They should really look at expanding the restaurant.",4
507,"I really wanted to like the Rusty Nail.  I love little local restaurants like this.  But it really is a very tight squeeze, to begin with.  They really need to pull some tables out of there to make more room.  We were right on top of another table with two very loud young children, and there was just no buffer.  And the food was.... just so bland!  I get that it was supposed to be homestyle cooking, but it just had no flavor.  To be fair, we did go for dinner, and I understand that this place is more of a breakfast joint, so I would be willing to try it again sometime for breakfast.  For dinner though, unless you like super-bland food, I probably wouldn't return for seconds.",2
508,"Given that the Rusty Nail has been highly recommended to me as a good breakfast spot by various sources, I'm sad to say I was sorely disappointed. \n\nThey have a wide selection of breakfast options.  However, even with numerous breakfast specials listed, not one included eggs, meat, potatoes AND toast.  Yes, that's right.  I had to order the eggs, bacon and toast special with a side of the potatoes.  When my food was served, the portions were average except for the side order of potatoes.  I did greatly enjoy the potatoes, though, which I ordered deep fried.  My dining companion ordered the French toast with ham and enjoyed it very much.  \n\nWe were here on a weekday morning so we didn't have to worry about it being crowded.  The service was good.  And it's not that I thought anything was bad, it's just that, as the two star rating says, \""Meh, I've experienced better.\""  Given the plethora of choices in Bellevue, this will not be my first stop should I find myself on Lincoln Avenue for breakfast again.",2
509,"I always see this place, and Saturday we decided to stop in for lunch. The atmosphere was pleasant. My boyfriend had the buffalo chicken sandwich, which he loved. I however, ordered the steak and cheese pita and was extremely disappointed. The pita was soft and fresh but the steak was terrible. It was very steak-um like and saturated with grease. When I picked up the sandwich grease poured from it. I'm not one to send back food, and that's my fault, but the waitress came by once as I was eating, over heard me upset about my food, looked at me then continued on her way. Needless to say I don't think I will be returning.",2
510,"I ate here this past Sunday morning for breakfast with my girlfriend.  I have been by this place many times and was excited to finally make it inside.  We were lucky that we went fairly early as a line developed shortly after we were seated at our table.  The Rusty Nail is prepared for this in a pretty cool way though as they have a list outside of the restaurant that you can sign into as well as some coffee to partake of while you wait.\n\nFor my entree I decided to go with one of the specials for the day which was the Rusty Nail omelet while my girlfriend decided on another special which was the a mushroom, spinach and feta junior omelet.  Her omelet is self explanatory while mine had in it some salami, cheese and three pieces of sliced pepperoni on top of it.  It was readily apparent that the pepperoni was not the cheap kind that you get on most pizzas as it had more flavoring and tasted much better.  Both omelets came with sides of home fries and toast for which we both ordered deli rye.  The junior omelet tasted good as the sourness of the feta played nicely with earthy mushrooms while the spinach made it feel like I was eating healthy.  My omelet was just as good if not better than the junior omelet as the cheese and meats combined to make it seem like I was almost eating a pizza.  Some of my hash browns were slightly overcooked and they had too many onions for my taste but we still decent enough to be a side to the main show.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here in the future.  Everything that I tasted was good and I would not hesitate to take any of my friends here for a breakfast.",4
511,"A great Pittsburgh diner with friendly service and good diner food. If there are any problems, the prices a bit high for diner food and, as others have said, it's extremely cramped. Otherwise, it's an enjoyable place to eat and the food is, indeed, very good.",3
512,"I am very happy to be moving into a 'neighborhood' that has a line-up of decent mom-and-pop shops to find a reasonable meal when the cupboard is bare, or the energy banks are depleted for cooking. Bellevue does seem to have a small collection of decent eats at reasonable prices, and The Rusty Nail is one of that handful of good examples of neighborhood haunts.\n\nIt's touted as a 'diner' in many of the reviews, but it really is a step above your average 'diner', and is more of a cozy neighborhood gathering spot for a decent burger, or entree. I've not made it there for the breakfast, but have always been satisfied by the dinners.\n\nRusty Nail is hardly on the gourmet end of the scale. In fact, I would imagine the Sysco truck pulls up out back regularly with deliveries of food parts, from cans of sauces to frozen animal chunks. As long as those parts are assembled and doctored to make them seem a bit fresher than the typical conveyor-belt diner, all is fine. And indeed, all IS fine.\n\nSo few of our local 'diners' are up to snuff when it comes to serving up decent 'diner' fare, that I can't call Rusty Nail a diner. It's a neighborhood family restaurant. Period.\n\nBurgers, meatloaf, pot roast, fish sammiches, salads, pastas...a varied but adequate menu. Fair and decent prices. Friendly and attentive service. A cozy enough atmosphere (although I have to say AGAIN in a review of a restaurant, if you've got multiple TVs in the space, for gods sake, can ONE of them NOT be showing SPORTS coverage??) and a pleasant crowd of patrons. \n\nDuring my last visit, there was a large family gathering at the next table. A nicely polished middle-class clan, ranging in age from gramps to granddaughter. At one point, dad received a phone call on his cell...and actually stepped OUTSIDE to have his conversation. As I was leaving I had to pat him on the back and thank him for being one of the few remaining decent guys with manners!\n\nBottom line...Rusty Nail is comfortable. It's not a drive-out-of-you-way destination for dining. It is what it is. A great little neighborhood spot FOR the neighborhood. \n\nBut do bring cash. The don't take credit cards. Believe it or not, they WILL actually take a check.",3
513,Place has amazing omelettes that are almost as big as the size of the plate. You get a really big side of home fries too. This is probably my favorite place for breakfast in Pittsburgh. I generally go in and get a seat right away without waiting. Service is usually fast and friendly. Two downsides to the place. 1) they are cash only which can be an inconvenience. I never remember to have cash until I get my bill so I have to run to the ATM. 2) the seating is limited and the tables are very close to each other so people there can most likely hear your conversations. Place overall is excellent and is worth a try at least for breakfast. The lunches and dinner selections aren't bad either!!,5
514,This place is overpriced and the service is not good at all.  When we where there children were riding bikes in the lot near the tables.  One almost hit our child.  Another customer said that if the owner had been there she would have not allowed the bikes to be there.  The cone was large to say the least but the taste left something to be desired.  Not the best neighborhood either with a bar nearby.  Our children were exposed to language that would have made a sailor blush.  We will not be back.  Also they will accept a credit card but not a debit card?????  Please get up with the times.,1
515,First time here and I wasnt impressed at all!  I should have gone to the dairy queen :-(,2
516,Thank You Kim and Kurt! It was very nice of you guys to take the time to post your reviews on our service. We really appreciate it. We hope your clocks will continue to do well for years to come. Please dont hesitate to give us a call if there's anything else we can do for you.\n\nLisa\nPaul's Clock Repair,5
517,"I can not express my thanks & gratitude enough to everyone at Paul's Clock Repair.  I needed an Atmos clock repaired, which was given to me by my mother who had recently passed away.  I needed it done on a short time line since I live out-of-town and was leaving soon.  It is next to impossible to find anyone who can actually fix that type of clock especially anywhere close to where I live.  They were so accommodating and really really helped me out during a hard time.  Much thanks to Lisa for spending the time to teach my about the clock & how to take care of it and her dad for fixing it up!  My Atmos clock is now working great and looks wonderful on my mantle!",5
518,"Good selection, but it will cost you.\nMultiple fridges of cold beer, but only the cheap beer is cold.\nNice in person, but rude on the phone.\nParking lot, but none of the customers understand how to park.\n\nEvery good thing about this place is equaled with a bad thing about this place - hence it probably deserves 3 stars. I would really give it a 3.5 if available as this is currently my beer distributor of choice, but since its not possible I have to go with 4.\n\nWhy 4 you ask, when I just went through all that 3 star crap? Any place that offers beer samples provided by attractive women gets a half star boost for sure, and as long as I'm going there anyway it really makes for a more interesting trip.\n\nAfter all, if you don't like free beer, you are probably a terrorist.",4
519,I stopped by here on my way home from whole foods market. They had just paved there parking lot which can only fit 3 max cars at a time. It was not as big as the one I normally shop at in Penn Hills. They are a beer distributor and have a way hugger selection. But they serve all of penn hills so go figure.\n\nI was looking for a gluten free beer which they had four kinds including cider. The prices were crazy expensive. $35 for a 24 pack of cider. NO way!! \n\nI had to buy it though cause it was sunday at 4:30 and all the stores close at 5 so i had no choice. I should have waited but i drove all the way here to get it so I should just buy it while i'm there. Aside from the money issue this place was just ok to me.,3
520,"We are fans of Pistella Beer Distributors simply because we needed beer one night while visiting some friends and family in Pittsburgh and they happened to be on the way to something we were doing.  It's a hole in the wall kind of facade but they do have a good selection.  I don't remember the price being that expensive but looking at the average review so far...it shows $$$$.  I'm sure they have some nice stuff, but we just got a case of beer (I think one of those Magic Hat variety packs) and it seemed similar to what we would pay in the other stores.  Anyway, we had a good experience with this place and don't really have anything bad to say about them.",4
521,"Animal Elegance is not much on the outside but the owner was very nice & LISTENED to how I wanted my teacup poodle groomed and used the products that I requested.\nI was very happy with my services and I will return. \n My poodles groom was $50,including tip, which I think is very reasonable.",4
522,"I had a very unfortunate experience with this groomer. My dog  was not groomed to my specifications; infact she was butchered. I went to the trouble of taking a photo of my dog with  the haircut that I wanted, as well as speaking with the woman who assured me she would be grooming my dog. The owner groomed my dog, not the woman that I spoke with and she looked nothing like my dog when I picked her up. The owner was rude and did not even apologize for the horrible service. Do not take your dog there to be groomed!",1
523,"They made my Portuguese Water Dog look horrible. \n\nThey actually sheared all the fur from my dog claiming that it was matted and therefore they had no choice. This isn't true as I personally brush my dog every morning. When I complained, the owner said: \""But we did tell you that we will cut the dog's fur short.\""  Yes, they did, and I thought that considering that the days are hot in August, they are proposing a little cooler grooming. I never expected them to just shear the dog to the skin. \nI think they did it because they are hopelessly irresponsible. Although they charged $70 for this brutally simple operation they have not even trimmed dog's ears and tail. Consequently, the dog has disproportionally long hair on its tail and the ears. \nI used Animal Elegance for more than a decade. Long before current management took over. Over all these years I sometimes took in stride their accessional compromise of standards and always paid their exorbitant prices without complaint. However, this fragrant negligence, combined with their total disregard of the fact that I was an old and loyal customer did it. I will avoid this place from now on and would like to suggest that you do the same.",1
524,"I made it back here about two weeks ago.  I must say the experience was night and day compared to the one at the end of July.  Whether or not it was an off night I do not know, but the place was loud and crowded, the service was bad, and the food was mediocre at best.  I should have just waited it out at Point Brugge.  I won't becoming back anytime soon.",2
525,"I've been told several times that this place had a great brunch.  Upon arrival, the menu was very limited and the service was abysmal despite a nearly empty restaurant.  We literally waited 15 mins. at our table and then left prior to ordering.",1
526,"I often have lunch at the nearby Point Brugge Cafe, but I decided to give Pino's a try today for a change of pace.  Bad idea.  My lady friend and I started with a pair of appetizers: greens & beans and \""Italian frites.\""  The latter, which the menu described as \""fresh cut, twice cooked, fresh herbs & roasted garlic,\"" were basically just regular-ass french fries - decent, but nowhere near worth their $6 price tag.  The greens and beans were even more of a rip-off: 8 FREAKIN' DOLLARS for a smallish bowl of rather flavorless produce.  Talk about a profit margin!\n\nAs a main course we shared a flatbread with goat cheese, caramelized onions, and roasted red pepper.  It was pretty good, but my enjoyment was diminished by the FM radio that was blaring through the loudspeakers.  Who wants to hear car commercials while eating a meal at a \""nice\"" restaurant?  Classless.\n\nConclusion: I'd rather wait 45 minutes for a table at Point Brugge than be seated immediately at Pino's.",2
527,"Pino's appears to fashion itself something of a nouveau-Italian, smart casual neighborhood restaurant, and it's literally just that. Translation: the menu is uninspired and predictable. A relatively encompassing selection of appetizers and entrees revealed not quite a soul-crushing, but certainly a lackadaisical attitude toward ingredients, recipes and presentation, though the service was refreshingly excellent. Unfortunately, the only other reason you'd be dining in Point Breeze would be to enjoy the amazing Point Brugge Cafe just down the street. As a previous reviewer mentioned, I stopped in simply because the Brugge was full, but I unfortunately won't be making that mistake again.",2
528,"\""God this is the best eggplant that I have ever tasted!\""  was what our friend said after he took his first bite of the Sicilian eggplant served at Pino's.  My husband couldn't wait to have the seafood fra diavlo, which he had last time...again, a 10 out of 10!  I had the roasted veggie platter for my entree, which is really an appetizer--and I had to share--way too much for one person to eat.  Another comment from our friend (who was a first timer at Pino's) was that it was the best Italian dressing that he ever had.  As I write, I want to go back for dinner tonight!!\n\nForgot to mention, they also have local beers on tap (East End Brewery), the men enjoyed the Homewood brew (dark lager type beer), it's great to see the owners supporting local businesses!",5
529,"I went to Pino's to celebrate a friends birthday on a Thursday night.  I hadn't been in Pino's since they renovated, but I have to say that they made the interior beautiful.  We made reservations, but I don't think we would have needed them since there was just a few other parties seated when we came in.  \n\nMy two girlfriends and I always have a tough time deciding what to order...so naturally we order one of everything that looks good.  We started with the Charcuterie platter, which was a mix of absolutely delicious prosciutto, capicola, and soppressata with a bit of veggies and mozzarella.  This was an impressive way to start out the meal.  We all wanted to try the seasonal ravioli, which was pumpkin (too tempting for three certified pumpkin fanatics), so we got an order to share as an appetizer.  This was unlike other pumpkin ravioli I've had...very pumpkiny.  The ravioli was good, although we all agreed that we wouldn't have been able to eat a whole order.  It was very sweetly spiced and I was missing a little bit of savory with the dish.  \n\nI ordered the grilled sausage pizza for my entree, and was pleased with it.  I admittedly never get too excited about pizza, and this was good, but nothing that I was dreaming about later that night.  Overall, the food was a 3-4 for me.  \n\nThe service was outstanding.  Our waiter was very welcoming and knowledgable.  My friends got dessert, and when the chef (I assume Chef Pino?) came over to ask how it was, my friend jokingly said that it was delicious, but would be perfect with a bit of sauce.  Before she could take another bite, he whisked both of the desserts away and added fresh strawberries and sauce, saying that he would be serving the dish that way for now on.  Talk about service!  The whole experience was fantastic, service gets a 5.  \n\nAdded bonus:  Awesome beer selection, some brews I haven't seen.  Only place I've been that had East End Homewood Reserve on tap for me to try (exciting for a beer dork like me, and it is tasty, by the way).",4
530,"I have had lunch at Pinos's several times probably at least 5 times. Usually I am there  for a business lunch when I am in the area. I find that we are well served, not rushed and the noise level is not too loud at lunch We have several times asked the Chef to make us some special version of his menu and we are always accommodated. To me this is excellent service. Makes you feel like coming back.\nI would have to admit that I usually order the garlic fries which are really great. I do this if I am not going back to the office or out to meet a client.\nNormally I would add a soup of the day which are always nice, and a sandwich of the day. \nI have never been disappointed and certainly would continue to conduct business lunches here. Pino's has been very reliable and dependable in all aspects.  I would make it 3 1/2 stars.",3
531,The food here is ok but not worth the price. $15 corking fee? $9 a glass of garbage wine? Me thinks not.\n\nWhat really tops it off is the owner is beyond rude and doesn't care about the business. I heard it used to be much better but now I don't know anyone who eats there...,1
532,"Another really good meal here!  My friend and I went for soup and appetizers--and licked the plates clean!  Gazpacho, pasta fagiole, homemade bread, eggplant with mozzarella and my favorite...the roasted veggie platter.  So much food we didn't think we would eat it, but it was so good we did!  They also had their doors open and we were able to sit outside in the cool summer air--great way to kick of summer!",5
533,"I ate here this past Friday with my girlfriend and two other dining companions.  We decided to come here because it was Pittsburgh restaurant week and they offered a special 3 course $30 fixed price menu with 2 course wine pairing for $12.  It ended up being a small little restaurant in the middle of Point Breeze which I had been past many times previously but never really noticed.\n\nThe restaurant was swamped whenever we got there, probably due to a combination of it being Friday night and restaurant week, so thankfully we had made reservations and were seated almost immediately.  I decided to start off my meal with a salad while my girlfriend had the tomato garlic bisque.  My salad was good and came with goat cheese, pears and a vinaigrette which all tasted nicely.  It was nothing amazing but I think it takes a really special salad to be amazing.  I also tried my girlfriends bisque and unsurprisingly found it to be a bit tomato-y since I do not enjoy tomatoes very much but she really enjoyed it.  For my entree I decided to get two small plates instead of a larger entree and settled on the mac n cheese and fish tacos.  The tacos were a bit sloppy/wet but had some nice flavors (cilantro, aoili and pico) in them along with some chili sauce that gave it a nice little kick.  My mac n cheese came out in its own little cast iron type pot and was good.  There was an adequate amount of cheese throughout and I liked that they even had some ricotta buried inside the dish.  I was also able to try the Arrabbita that one of our dining companions had ordered.  Wow was it good and it packed quite the spicy punch too.  Immediately I regretted not ordering it although I still did enjoy my two small plates.  For my dessert course I ended up having the White Chocolate Creme Brulee.  My girlfriend decided upon the tiramisu while another at our table had the peaches and puff pastry.  All of the desserts seemed large and made sure that we did not go home hungry!  My creme brulee tasted decently and ended up being a good finish to my meal.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here in the future.  Their regular menu seemed reasonably priced and everything that I had tried throughout the night was good.",4
534,"I grew up just the street from Pino's and my family were probably its most regular customers -- we got take-out at least once or twice a week for many many years, and always enjoyed the pizza and hot subs. I've just been back for the first time in 6 years after moving away, and was pretty unimpressed... The decor looks nice, but the food was wayyyyy overpriced for what it was. $22 dollars for a plate of pasta, really? It claimed to be \""fresh pasta,\"" but it was completely tough and chewy (not \""al dente,\"" just undercooked), and not very large. I'm not sure when the restaurant changed, but I think it really missed the mark... People WANT a casual, friendly, affordable neighborhood place that they can bring the kids to. Why take that away?",2
535,"Went here with a gift card from the restaurant week photo competition. \n\nWe were one of two tables there and a bunch of staff showing up during the meal. \n\nOur waitress was good, but that couldn't save the food.\n\nThe meal started out with some what I guess used to be foccacia.  I say used to be because it no longer represented anything other than long pieces of brick or bark very stale and tasteless.\n\nWe ordered the vegetable board which was probably the best thing we ordered with light and bright vegetables perfectly cooked and paired with two delicious sauces. \n\nThen we ordered the octopus which was fine, but very cold and the octopus had little to no flavor, being overwhelmed by the citrus in the dish. \n\nThe tuscan wings were ok, but they were really ordered for my husband who seemed to enjoy them. \n\nFinally the diver scallops.  This dish was indeible.  The scallops were very overcooked and the pea puree was so minty I was unable to eat it. We sent it back and they did take off half of the price (weren't expecting anything just didn't want to eat it). \n\nAfter that we decided against dessert and left.  I probably will not return.",2
536,"My husband and I celebrated our one year wedding anniversary this past weekend and since we recently have moved into a new area of town, we made reservations here because word on the street was that it was good. Verdict? It was so-so. We had reservations at 7:15 and were seated promptly, which was fine, except we were seated OUTSIDE! Listen folks, it's COLD when the sun goes down. They have three tables set outside, I guess trying to squeeze out some more business. Our server was nice, but not attentive at all.  We were left waiting for things for 10-20 minutes at a time. Also, because we were sitting on the sidewalk, people and animals and cars kept sweeping by us. It took the waiter three tries to get our meal order because he had to keep stepping out of the way of people walking down the street. Wine was good. Food was ehhhhhh. We had the mussel and clam appetizer and when it came out, about 1/2 of the order was not edible and all the innards had fallen into the sauce, which by the way smelled like stinky cheese. My dinner and my husbands dinner was good, no real complaints there. Espresso and a S'more cupcake for dessert and I grand total of $134 later before tip? Definitely not worth it at all.  The best part of the night? Leaving. The worst part of the night? Associating this place with my anniversary.",2
537,"Nice atmosphere with above average food. This restaurant has a lot of potential. The wait staff was far below average: They were slow, and we had to ask multiple times for things. They were not the most polite wait staff, and our waitress was either a little demeaning or very socially awkward.",2
538,"We were huge fans of Pinos a few years back before the wine bar concept was adopted. In all honesty, we haven't been back for a year though we kept saying \"" we have to get to Pinos!\"" Needless to say, we were disappointed.  The place has changed and not for the better.  It seems in an effort to create a quaint wine bar, Pinos lost sight of the original draw and that was the food.  The menu has been scaled back considerably.  Though the food was adequate, it's not the same.  I came here because the food was amazing and with that no longer being the case, I doubt we will return.  Hopefully, things will change back to how they were.  Customer advice for what it's worth.  Refocus on great italian food not a wine bar concept.   Sometimes a liquor license is not the best investment!!!",2
539,"There was absolutely nothing not to like.  Reasonably priced wines, home style Italian cooking. Great upbeat ambience.",5
540,"Small portions. Over priced food. Very small menu (dinner). Was OK, but disappointing overall.",3
541,"I went to Pino's with my three other friends for Restaurant Week and was underwhelmed and completely disappointed. We chose an option for each course of  the very limited Restaurant Week menu. I selected the baked eggplant caprese appetizer, Lazy Man lasagna Florentine and then the panna cotta for dessert. \n\nBaked eggplant caprese: the breaded eggplant was a soggy mess. \nLazy Man Lasagna Florentine: it was essentially two huge lasagna noodles sandwiching huge clumps of spinach (I'm talking like a 3-inch high pile of clumped spinach) with a few mushrooms peppered in. The spinach ratio was out of control and I honestly ate a few bites and couldn't even continue. \nPanna cotta: this was the most decent of the items we ordered.\n\nMy friend ordered off the regular menu, which she advised not to do since her food would come out at a different time?? Why? \nWe tried my friend's appetizer of the Italian Fries, which are described on the menu as sounding very similar to the amazing fries at Point Brugge...but it was just a bowl of regular French fries, which were lackluster and misleading. She also got the house soup with chickpeas and it looked like Spaghetti-o's and tasted even worse.\n\nI don't know where all the positive reviews are coming from. There was not one thing we ate that was impressive in any way. All of it was overpriced and below mediocre. I wasted my money, and I will never, ever go back there.",1
542,"I went to Pino's recently, only to be disappointed by the owner himself. I guess I should have read the reviews on here before going, seeing as a lot of people echo the sentiments that I feel.\n\nAfter my mother sent back her extremely oversalted steak, the chef came out to \""apologize\"". It was very embarrassing how he chastised her for not enjoying her meal. He then snidely commented, as walking away, that he would \""never salt his steak again\"". I don't really take kindly to people speaking so rudely to my mother. She was very polite about sending it back and certainly didn't deserve any attitude. We had an event to attend, which we were very clear with to our waitress. So when my mother reordered another meal (a salad), which took another twenty minutes, my mom asked for it to be immediately wrapped up. The chef returned, obviously chewing to make a point, and sneered at my mother, announcing her steak that she refused to eat was actually quiet good. Well, I have never felt more embarrassed in a situation. I said he was being rude to my mother, a paying customer. He proceeded to get heated and tell me it was not his job to make people happy (!??!) and that everyone else seemed to enjoy their meal and we just had to get to the inside of the steak to appreciate it. \n\nThe drama continued when he did not have change for $100 for a $57 bill. Sorry, how can you not have $33 in change?! He ended the night by throwing our bill in a crumbled mess on the floor and walking out. \n\nOverall, embarrassing. It was an embarrassing situation for anyone to witness. Take heed of the negative comments on this site. I certainly wish I would have.",1
543,"Very disappointing meal.  After waiting for a half hour, my meal arrived and we were told that my friend's meal would be coming in a few minutes. Very awkward.t.  Salad was average at best.  The beets tasted like canned beets and the chicken was covered with blackish oil from a burnt oil pan.\n\n  Then, to make matters worse the chef came out to argue with a patron who returned her food.  The chef came out to humiliate the customer explaining that her returned steak was great and himself was enjoying it.  Eating food from a customers plate was a real turn-off....what else does he do when cooking? \n\nTo make matters worse, when paying the bill, the chef did not have change for a $100 bill for the customer who returned her steak..  It was very uncomfortable watching the elderly customer and her young friend deal with the situation. He kept  loudly requesting a credit card  and the women did not have one.   Another customer provided them with change as the chef crumbled the check. I think I would have just left and not paid....give the lady great for dealing with such a lunatic.\n\nLong story short....if you want to eat below average food and watch a chef loose it....this is your place!",1
544,"This was the place I brought friends visiting from out of town when I wanted to show them the classy Italian  spots in Pittsburgh. After my visit last night, I have no desire to ever go again. \n\nI don't know the owner, Joe, personally but he has stopped by our table a few times and said \""dish looks beautiful.\"" He was always confident in his food which I guess is a good thing if the good is delicious,  which it usually is  \n\nThe table next to ours had a two women, a mother and daughter. The mother asked the server for a new steak as hers was a bit salty (I've never had the steak as I'm vegetarian but my guests have mentioned the abundance of salt). The server apologizes and returns to the kitchen. The owner comes out and fakes an apology claiming his steaks are perfect. At this point the whole restaurant is listening it's that crazy.  The  best part? He comes out again and says \""I really enjoyed the steak you sent back.\"" He was eating the steak and had some in his mouth! I can't make stuff like this up!\nAt this point the whole place feels bad for the mother and daughter. Clearly an awkward situation. The owner got so nasty the daughter tried to reason with him and he said \""it's not my job to make people happy\"" that's strange considering he wants our business. \nSo the mother tries to pay the bill with a $100 and leave but he said they can't make change. Eventually another customer helps make change and they leave.\n\nI couldn't finish my dinner I was so mad.  Maybe Joe was having a bad day but there is no excuse for how he treated those customers.  Sorry, we will never step foot in here again.",1
545,"If you don't like your food... do not send it back to the kitchen... The \""Chef\"" will come out and scream at you... Stay away from this place.",1
546,"Pinos offers an unhappy marriage of good food at bad prices.  The food is tasty but not transcendent.  The prices in the high $20's for most of the entrees are not justified by the quality, location, or portions.  The food is essentially slightly hipper Olive Garden fare at double the prices.\n\nFor dinner entrees you can get more for your money elsewhere.  But it's not all bad.  The atmosphere is pleasant and the service was excellent.  I had a good time and I'd happily go back for appetizers (most are $8-10).\n\nPino's is frequented by a large rambunctious flock of malbec massacring 40-50 year old women.  My friend and I were the only males there.  If cougar hunting is your sport of choice, you'll feel right at home in Pino's jungle safari!",3
547,Great,1
548,"Definitely overpriced for what they offered.  Took my car in to check my AC, they didn't get back to me for the whole day, and decided to fix whatever the problem was without asking me and charging me an insane about (approximately $150 more than most places).  Definitely will not go back there again.",1
549,"This Giant Eagle truly is giant!  And believe me, that's about all it has going for it!  You would think that this means you can find what you want, and generally you can, but it also means enormous crowds, no matter when you shop here.\n\nYou know that a trip to a large, \""one size fits all\"" chain grocery store like this is not quite the same as shopping at Macy's or Boscov's.  You know that it's pretty hard to give a place like this five stars.  Its purpose is purely utilitarian.  But good gravy, you'd think that a place like this could handle large crowds.  It shouldn't take you a half-hour just to get one item.  \n\nThat's what happened to me yesterday.  I would have been better off going to Cogo's or 7-11.  I might have paid a bit more, but I would have been in-and-out in under five minutes.  I prefer the Giant Eagle in Squirrel Hill.",2
550,"I have to agree that this is one of the poor examples that Giant Eagle has.  Granted, it has the basics you need, and is 1 of the biggest in the city itself.  Finding things takes work.  My big gripe is that it has one of the weirdest and most illogical layouts that I've seen.  It actually takes time to find what you need as compared to most stores where once you are in there a few times, you easily find everything.  Parts of this store are diagonal and that causes you to go in every direction possible.  Here is a quick summary of the setup as it can be classified as a maze:\n\n1.) When you enter the store through the slow wide door, you go to the left and walk past the front registers to produce.  Normal enough.\n\n2.) From produce in front of you (a quasi L-shaped department), you take a quick left and go diagonally to the right to walk past the pharmacy.  Take a hard right down aisle 1 and then you hit the bakery.   \n\n3.)  From the bakery, you walk along a long meat wall.  Diagonally to the left, you'll find the service meat/seafood counters. And because how the wall goes diagonal to the left, the sign for Aisle 9 is facing diagonally to the right so you don't miss it because the 1 side is longer towards the back than the other. (Aisles 9-14 are almost twice as long as 1-8).\n\n4.) From meat, you have frozen straight back on a long back wall in its own cove.  A hard right (if you bypass frozen) brings you last to hot foods, the deli, and then facing in front of you, the Customer Service desk which is tucked away in a corner (not really visible when you walk in the store).\n\n5.) Once you pass the deli and customer service, take a hard right, then to the left (almost a U-turn) to the checkouts, and then you take a hard left to leave.\n\nMost of the other Giant Eagle stores are much more logical in how their aisles and deparment locations are set up.   You're not going every which way to try and find things.\n\nAlso, the service isn't that great as one of the other reviews said.  Given that, I would take Market District on Centre Ave or GE on Murray Ave over this store.\n\nHowever, for those who remember the Giant Eagle on Centre Ave at N. Craig St, nothing beats how BAD that store was.  There is a reason that store was nicknamed \""the dirty bird.\""  Compared to that North Oakland store that closed several years ago, Shakespeare St GE is light years ahead.",2
551,"I cannot in my life understand why this Giant Eagle, of all the Giant Eagles, would get a five star rating.  From the moment you walk into here it's like someone has hit you on the head very hard and you walk around in a confused state the rest of the time you're in there.\n\nThe set up is ridiculous.  I mean, who wants to walk around in the freezer section and then go through a smaller than usual end of the aisle to see, SURPRISE, the meat section hidden off in an area where they could have knocked down the wall so you didn't have to do a little dance to get to it.  Aisles seem extra long in this store, you can tell that they worked with the space they had.  It's like when you are half way through the aisle and realize it's too late to turn around because it's the same distance to the end as it was to the beginning of the aisle, but you kind of just want to give up and sit on the floor because you feel like you've been walking forever.  \n\nHonestly, I only went here because I was at Target and didn't want to venture any further to complete my shopping.",2
552,"This Giant Eagle seems more like a GetGo than an actual supermarket. As soon as you get in you want to get out as quickly as possible.\n\n You don't want to do any major grocery shopping here. For one, the prices are high. Secondly, this Giant Eagle does not carry everything you need. Who has time to run to another store? Just get your basic necessities here.\n\nAs for produce, it can be awful at times. Whenever I go to Giant Eagle Market District down the street, the produce is fresh and smells invigorating.  However, at Shakespeare, you are bound to find produce with wrinkles, open areas, mold and fruit flies- being sold at the same high prices. I can go to Trader Joe's and find much better produce for less.\n\nA pet peeve of mine is the self-checkout lines. Two of them are express lanes for items less than 12; the other lane has a belt if more than 12 items are being purchased. There should be TWO LINES but for some reason customers want to form one long super line, which holds up everything. The staff rarely sorts this out.\nThe customer service is average here and I don't expect it to get any better.\n\nI only go here if I have to grab one or two items. The best times to go are early in the morning or late at night.",2
553,"I prefer this store to the Market District on Centre. It's just as overpriced and poorly laid out and maybe a bit grimy, but carries less products to sift through when you just need to grab some simple things, hopefully not produce. Parking is easy and you can hit up the unpretentious Wine and Spirits in the same stop. I think this plaza still exists to prevent impoverished people from venturing into the other newer fancier stores which are a mere half mile away and designed to appeal to people who think they are cultured and discerning.",2
554,"Been yelled at by other customers (today for instance)...place is super ghetto...avoid at all cost. Today, left a full cart bacause a woman (with a baby in a stoller) shouted at me for \""cutting in line\"". Will never go back. At night it is a nightmare.",1
555,I been going to this place since the 90s and this place is the MIDDLE CLASS GE. I stopped going to this place since I got a job at whole foods. My mom went here a two weeks ago for the first tine in a long time she say that the people are still there and the place looks better and the people are a lot friendly now. \nSo if you don't what too shop at a Middle Class food store in East Liberty then go to The Market in Shadyside.,5
556,"I agree with other reviews, this store is poorly laid out and honestly makes no sense. Sometimes bigger is not always better. I used to head here often while living near Shadyside to stop at the Family Dollar & hit GE in one run. \n\nI normally only stopped here for a Redbox movie. My debit card got hacked at an outdoor Redbox at a Get Go so I'll only go to a Redbox that is indoor like this one. \n\nAnyways, I'd hit up the liquor store for some wine afterwards for dealing with long lines/wait & awkward clientele outside.",2

I wanted to grow out my hair longer but it was looking messy.  So I asked her for a trim to get the sides/back cleaned up.  She said ok and off she goes.  5 minutes later, we were done.   Yes, just like a bad date, we were done in 5 minutes.\n\nI got home, showered, and saw the damage.  It was messy.  What's worst is every day it grows, it looked even worst.\n\nI'll just stick to my usual barber.",1
559,"Nothing spectacular, but I go there regularly, and generally get a cut that works fine for at least a couple of months.  They did a good job after I had a botched cut overseas (hairdressers in Japan are, understandably, not necessarily qualified to work on non-Asian hair, as they don't cut a lot of it). Parking can be tough, depending on time of day--there's a shared private lot, but it's small.",3
560,"I wish I could return a haircut.\n\nUnfortunately Kelly, Melissa, and Jen were not there so I settled for whoever was free at the time. \n\nWorst trim of my life:\nshe cut off over an inch more than just the dead/split ends\nshe did not cut the hair how I described initially\nshe did not change the cut to how I repeated during the cut when I noticed she was cutting it straight across instead of curving it in the back, which does NOT mix well with my curly hair\nafter retelling her how I wanted it cut, she compared this tragedy to deaths of family/friends and how I should get over it\nthe beautiful long layers I had and wanted again are now choppy, medium layers\nmy left side is even choppier than the right side of my hair\nI fear straightening my hair to make this unevenness less evident\n\nI regret tipping her because I understand how the service industry works because my minimum tip of 20% for all service people is undeserved for her lack of work.\n\nI want everyone to know how the only good hair stylists there are Kelly (who moved to Philly), Melissa and Jen. If they are not available, do NOT risk going.\n\nAlso, the Supercuts Oakland location is horrible at waxing eyebrows unless you are lucky to get the only woman of color there.\n\nWhile it was a $20 cut (after the 20% tip), I know had to buy biotin to grow my hair faster so it is more expensive to me in the end. I hope this proves helpful to all perspective customers!",1

562,"Went here with a friend for his haircut. It's been a long time since I've been to a barber shop or haircut salon/store, but from what I remember this place seems completely average. The hair stylists seem nice enough and competent. The wait was a few minutes- I actually expected the wait to be longer because we came in on a Saturday. If I ever need a haircut (which I haven't gotten in maybe 5 years!), I wouldn't have a problem stopping in here- but I tend to enjoy my long shaggy mop.....",3

Eddie's Pizza Place  is all of these things and since I live in this neighborhood this is my favorite.",5
565,"Decent neighborhood pizza can be found in morningside at eddies pizza haus. The sauce and cheese are perfect, but the crust falls short.  It has a nice texture and overall the pizza isn't greasy, but the crust lacks much flavor. Maybe a little more salt is needed in the dough to compensate? The pizza is decent enough though and merits a try, perhaps it was an off day for Eddies.",3
566,"Food: There are countless options to choose from for vegetarians or carnivores, but the food is only so-so.  We've ordered takeout numerous times due to proximity, and nothing has been bad, but nothing has been special.  The general Tso's tofu and the Moo Shu vegetables are the best things we've ordered.  The eggplant was soggy and not great.  The portions are large.  Nothing is particularly spicy even if it is mentioned as being spicy on the menu.\n\nPrice: Tasty is cheap.  \n\nDrinks: N/A\n\nAtmosphere: Typical Chinese takeout place.  A photo of every single meal they offer is on the wall.  Located in the plaza next to Pizza Parma.  Decent location for that end of Shadyside.\n\nService: The employees speak poor English but can usually understand what you are askingt/telling them.  The food is usually ready for takeout within 10-15 minutes.\n\n(+): many options, cheap, ready quickly\n\n(-): food is nothing to write home about\n\nWould I go back again? If I'm feeling too lazy/broke to go anywhere else.",2
567,"This place features everything you can expect from a standard hole-in-a-wall Chinese restaurant. There's zero ambiance, offers quick take-out and the service is rude. I decided to give Tasty a try because it's conveniently located on Highland Avenue and has easy parking.\n\nI ordered the Kung Pao Chicken and Crab Rangoon. Sadly, they prepared Kung Pao Beef instead. It's extremely disappointing to receive the wrong food. It's even more disappointing when the restaurant refuses to correct the order. While it wasn't what I ordered, the food was good...but there is better Chinese food out there.",2
568,"Note: Tasty has a credit card minimum of $10 and has a parking lot\n\nTasty is another standard chinese takeout place - it didn't blow my mind but overall it was good, especially considering the price. Before I continue, I will come out and say that all of the food was a little tough - the eggroll especially(As was warned) -  and the rice had some dark spots(I assume it was from the bottom of the cooking vessel).  However, I will chalk some of it up to my mistake because I thought they closed a half hour later,  than they did, and consequently ordered about 10 minutes before they closed. So, Tasty, you get a pass on the rice\n\nAnyhow, I ordered a vegetable eggroll($1.50) and general tso's tofu($8.25)(I've learned to accept my guilty pleasure). I ordered the general tso's extra spicy - it was not. Also, the tofu was in very large chunks, which has seemed to be my luck lately. I want surface area, and I don't want to have to figure out how to cut my food with chopsticks. I will say, though, that the sauce was very tasty - enough to seal the deal for a future order at this place.\n\nThe eggroll, as I said, was tough.. It tasted good, but it was tough, and small... This probably won't be in my future order, however with the $10 minimum I do need to order something else with my tofu... I hope the soup is good.\n\nThe lady behind the counter was friendly and was decent on the phone and didn't once mention that they were closing so close to when I ordered. Portion size was good, for the $10.44 it cost me, I'll definitely be able to make a lunch out of what is left.",3

My wife and I are moving to North Carolina in two days, and Tasty Chinese was the thing about Pittsburgh that we said we would miss the very most.  These are great folks, and I wish them the best of success in the future.  Remember, everyone, just because you read a negative review it does not mean that the food is bad!

573,Home of the Italian Army.\n\nVento's is located in the East Liberty section of Pittsburgh right next to Home Depot. They have been in business forever! They are a pizza and hoagie shop. They are famous for their Italian Army hoagie. I have friends that as soon as they land in Pittsburgh they come straight to Vento's for the pizza! It is Sicilian style pizza and It is delicious! Everything is made fresh so sometimes you have to wait a little while for your food. It's best to call ahead if you're really hungry.\n\nThey have tables and booths for seating. You can even play the PA lottery there. \n\nNo debit or credit cards. CASH ONLY!\n\n(F.Y.I. There is a generic ATM that charges $1.75 to make a withdraw.),5
574,Good pizza and hoagies.  It is always busy.  Cash only.,4
575,"I had heard lots of good things about Vento's. Unfortunately I did not get to experience these things. The service was slow and lukewarm. The pizza was expensive and not the same price in the restaurant as advertised on the website http://www.ventospizza.com/. Also, no credit or debit cards here.  You're directed to the ATM in the restaurant that charges a fee of $1.75.   I ordered ahead and although I had to wait for my pizza when I got there I received it cold and it just was not that good.  I also ordered provolone sticks which also did not taste good.",2
576,"We were visiting from out of town and just spent 6 hours driving. Found this place, read reviews on Yelp which were OK, and decided to ordered two slices. Hum...sorry not slices. More like two squares of cheesy bread. When we said these aren't slices, the lady at the register looked confused as though pizzas always look like that. We obviously aren't locals by the way we were dressed so the lady (who talked terribly) should have notified us when we first ordered it! They also have pictures of real pizzas on the wall -_-\nIt also took a really long time to cook those little things because they weren't pizzas. Since I was so hungry, i ordered another square of unhappiness and it was handed to me in the cooking wrapper not a paper plate, ugh. Definitely never going there if we come to visit again!",1
577,"Horrible Food don't waste your money\n\nThis is the worse cardboard covered cheese & sauce so called pizza I've ever had, I haven't had this garbage since grade school cafeteria food, Most of the reviews on here rant about what a great place this is how much fun you'll have there. IDK where that place is cuz the one I wan in today in East Liberty by the Home Depot was getto beyond belief the food is bad & the people aren't nice & friendly.\n\nLoudness is an issue there when the lottery area has a sign saying because of back round noise your number may be wrong. Not one person there had decent customer service skills I had to ask the girl 3 times to speak up and I have excellent hearing. I ordered a small pizza I got a medium that was greasy on top but the crust was stale. \n\nI looked forward to getting some great pizza man this place really disappointed me today.",1
578,"This place has the worst service I've ever seen. I called in two cold sandwiches and was told it would be 15 mins. When I got to the counter, the lady working rudely told me to wait for my name to be called because she didn't have my ticket to ring up the order. Um, okay...then walk over and get it so i can pay for it! So I waited and waited as people who came in long after me got their orders. The \""workers\"" just stand around and spend more time talking to the regulars and trying to act like they are a big deal. I had to leave without my order after 40 minutes. DO NOT GO HERE!",1
579,"This is a Pittsburgh/Shadyside institution.\n\nWhat can I say, this place is good-eatin' basic Italian food!  Not spectacular, but when you want a good nuthin-fancy dinner, this is the place to go.  The pizza is outstanding.",4
580,"This was one of the worst dinners out I've had in recent memory. On the other hand, I wasn't expecting much, so I guess the place lived up to my expectations. I've been trying to think of a good way to describe their food, and the best I can come up with is as follows. Imagine a cafeteria pasta dinner you might have been served as a child away at summer camp, and you'll have a pretty good idea. In other words, the food is perfectly edible here, but boring, and nothing you would want to actually pay for. There was nothing disgusting about it, it was just extremely uninspiring. To be fair, I only tried the pasta, bread, salad, soup, and calamari, so maybe they have amazing pizza here... It's possible, although unlikely based on what I've seen.\n\nOn the upside, the service was friendly enough, and there were plenty of empty tables at prime dinner time! If you're hungry, you'll definitely be full when you leave.",2
581,"I went to this place because I had a LivingSocial voucher. Even with this voucher I feel like I paid too much money. I think I could have had better food if I went over to the Giant Eagle across the street and heated up a Lean Cuisine. I do have to wonder why the owners would put out the living social deal when what really would help business at the restaurant would be simply to improve the quality of the food.\nThe only positives I can give are that it isn't pretentious and the waiter provided very good service. It was almost empty for a Monday at 7 PM, so if you are desperately starving, not able to go to better restaurants nearby or heat up food from your local grocer's freezer, this might be a tolerable food option.  Again, it is advisable to be desperately starving.",2
582,"Based on some recent reviews, it looks like the quality of food at Minutellos has slipped a little bit.  Still as I mentioned before, it's a Shadyside institution located in the basement of an apartment building.  \n\nAnyway, the main reason to come to Minutellos is for the pizza.  My cousin and I did just that the other night when we were in the area.  We did the whole 'Build Your Own Pizza' thing, ordering ours with pepperoni, green peppers, onions, and mushrooms.  Good pizza even if the place is beginning to look a little dated.",3
583,"Minutello's is going out of business. Last day of operation is Sunday, February 17, 2013.",3
584,"The people that work here make an unfortunate incident a breeze to work through.  I woke up one morning to find a note attached to my windshield to inform me that I was the victim of a hit and run.  The damage was minimal, but after calling it into my insurance company, they directed me to come here.\n\nWithin minutes of me hanging up my phone with the insurance company my phone was ringing to indicate that Mikes was calling to set up an appointment to get my car in for an estimate.  I set up an appointment that was convenient for me and went about my day.\n\nWhen I arrived here to have my car viewed it was quite the easy task.  My wait was minimal, the staff were polite and I wasn't being jerked around.  Within five minutes of them looking at my car, I was out the door and heading back to my place.  \n\nUnfortunately, they did not do any work to my vehicle at this point because the police are still looking into the person that hit my car.  But if we get to that step, I am confident that they could not do anything wrong in my eyes.  If their body work for a vehicle is anything like their customer service, they are definitely one of the best places to go in the city.\n\nYes people, this isn't the best neighborhood in the city, but get over it.",5
585,Mikes took my car after horrible repairs/service from Kenny Ross South.  The service was great and I even got to meet the owner who came out to personally speak with me on a busy Friday afternoon.  Great guys there.,5
586,"I took my car to Mike's auto body as it's recommended by Geico and is part of their easy claims and repair process.  This was a big mistake.  Like many of the reviewers here, I was initially told it would take a certain amount of time, and then, at the last minute, on the day I was supposed to get my car back, they told me it would be a few more days.  Their excuse?  The headlamp that came in didn't have a bulb with it.  Seriously?  Since this was the Geico rep telling me this I couldn't really argue, but I don't know why Geico keeps working with a business that repeatedly does this to its customers.\n\nI got the car back in great condition, cleaned on the outside, and the console wiped down inside.  All in all, just alright - go here if you're not pressed for time and you've got Geico, otherwise shop around.",2
587,"I had a great experience taking my vehicle to Mike's for repair after a fender bender. I used the Geico express service - I booked the estimate and repair online for the next day. When I dropped off my car, they were expecting me, it took less than 30 minutes and every single person I encountered at the shop was helpful and friendly and showed concern for me. The damage was minor, and the repairs took less than 48 hours to complete. My policy provides a rental car, and Enterprise was there when I checked in with my vehicle and the rental process was streamlined and easy. When I picked up my repaired car, it was just as efficient and friendly. Getting into an accident is frustrating and inconvenient and costly but Mike's Auto Body made the process of fixing things and getting me back on the road into a good experience. I wish more businesses treated their customers like Mike's treated me.",5
588,"I'm a crazy cat lady and proud of it! \n\nBeing a volunteer here has been so fulfilling on many different levels.  It has made me feel so good to be able to help out with something that I feel passionately about.  You can tell that the staff puts a lot of effort into taking care of these animals they accept in.  A lot of times people will say, oh I can't do it, it's too sad.  But the thing is, it's not.  It's actually so great because these animals come here and find loving homes instead of being on the street or in an environment that's toxic.  I rarely see animals there for a long time.  I think that's a testament to the way they are treated while they're in the facility. \n\nNow I'll admit, I'm not the biggest dog fan, so I help out in the cat shelter.  I can talk about that with a lot more knowledge than the dog side.  They just built a new cat facility on their property so they have their own shelter.  The cats are all set up in a huge room.  They have two rooms for people to play with the cats when they are looking to adopt them.  These rooms are also used for \""cat cuddling.\""  That's what I do when I volunteer.  I get to take the cats out so that they can play, be cuddled or just run around.  Then the cats are able to get out of the cages and get used to human contact. \n\nThe other great thing about the ARL is that they have foster parents who take in cats and dogs while they're waiting to be adopted.  This way, they get a great home environment and it relieves the facility of having too many animals at one time. At different points in the year the adoption rates are different depending on the amount of animals they have.  Cat rates are usually cheaper in the Spring/Summer because there's more coming in and dog rates are cheap in the late summer months.  The added bonus of adopting a pet from the ARL is that they are spade or neutered when you adopt them.  It's actually cheaper then taking them to a normal vet on your own. \n\nI would STRONGLY recommend coming here to check out the animals and hopefully find your next furry friend!  OR you can volunteer!  They have volunteer informational sessions the first Saturday of every month.  After that you only have one training session to complete and you're ready to volunteer!  \n\nJust check it out if you're curious.  You won't regret it!  Your new furry friends will appreciate it as well!",5
589,I have an almost three-year-old cat named Jack that I spoil as if he were my son. I honestly never experienced the love for and from an animal until I adopted Jack from an Animal Rescue League. It was one of the best decisions I've ever made.\n\nThe shelter is great and I'll probably get another cat in the near future. Check this location out!,5
590,"Please do not adopt any pets from here until they update their standards.  I hate to think of animals living in cages, but...\n\n!! At least two cats adopted from here in September have diagnosed with the herpes virus by the vet, and this is contagious to other cats. !!\n\nAKA, it is likely that the shelter staff is not washing hands between handling pets and they are not testing for a virus that can be fatal in kittens.\n\nI recently adopted a kitten from their shelter--I picked him up from their Pittsburgh Public Market adoption station.  I was told that he had been tested for common feline viruses and up-to-date on vaccinations.  These were both untrue statements.  The kitten has the herpes virus and was not vaccinated against this.  My roommate, who was with me, and I were warned about the upper respiratory infection (URI) that can occur because of this virus and others, but we were not told that he was neither tested nor vaccinated for the herpes virus.  They gave me a paper with his vaccinations, but it was in vet-speak, so I took their word for it. \n\nFurthermore, the shelter staff put my kitten in my roommate's name mistakenly (and claimed that if we just called in that they would fix this mistake, but then wouldn't), so when he got sick, no one from their clinic would return my calls--I'm guessing this was since I wasn't the owner according to their records.  I had to email them to get a response, which basically said sorry that we didn't return your calls but this is your problem now.  They never apologized for the kitten's health or asked if he was feeling better.  Where's the compassion for the animal?\n\nSo now I have a very sick kitten on my hands.  I took him to the Big Easy in Lawrenceville when he stopped eating, and Dr. Ruiz is the best.  She took care of him, but it cost $160 to treat the virus he picked up at the shelter.\n\nThe Animal Rescue League shelter/clinic said that it does not and will not cover expenses for this.  After I had already taken him elsewhere, the clinic staff said that they would have given me a discount if I had waited two days to go to their clinic, but who would wait two days while the kitten wouldn't eat??  And now this virus makes him ineligible for pet insurance.  It  will cost hundreds of extra dollars a year to keep him healthy. \n\nHad I not fallen in love with the little monster, I would have taken him back to another shelter.  That's what the person who adopted the other kitten with virus did.  Whenever he gets an outbreak, he will get another URI.  This means a lethargic cat who sneezes, gags, and coughs because he can't breathe and who won't eat because he's too congested to smell his food.  It's very sad--protect your cats with the herpes vaccination, please!\n\nOh, and in case you were wondering: just like in humans, cat herpes is fo' life.  Poor little guy.  This also ruins my plan of getting another cat in the future.  Bad shelter!",1
591,"I adopted a dog from the ARL this past spring.  During the adoption process the employees were polite and seemed genuinely happy for me.  Shortly after the adoption, I received emails from a volunteer to check in and to inquire about how the dog and I were adjusting.  A few months after the adoption, it became clear that the dog had some pretty serious anxiety and behavioral issues (please note that there is no way the shelter staff could have known about the issues while the dog was in the shelter).  I contacted the shelter and they practically  bent over backwards to help me with the dog's issues.  The dog and I participated in two sessions of behavioral classes (Lacey is wonderful and never gave up on my dog!), consulted with veterinary staff, and received constant emails from staff offering suggestions and checking in to see how I was doing.  In the end, I learned how to manage the dog's behaviors and I love the dog dearly.  Nine months later, I still receive emails from the shelter asking about the dog and offering more suggestions.\n\nI would highy suggest adopting from this shelter.  I understand that my dog is sort of a worse-case-senerio of adopting a pre-owned dog; however, this shelter will make sure you are happy with your adoption and literally will do everything in their power to ensure both you and the adopted animal are ok.  The shetler staff care deeply about the animal AND the human's well-being!",5
592,"Our cat recently came down with some health issues that we could not afford to address. He was in pain and we decided the humane thing was to put him to sleep. We went to the ARL and asked the receptionist there if we had any other options available to us. \""Well basically the only thing you can do is sign him over for euthanasia\"" she said in the most uncaring, apathetic voice possible. We were heartbroken of course. \""Go wait by that door and someone will meet you.\"" After a few minutes another woman came out and took the carrier. \""I'll bring your carrier back out in a minute.\"" We said no, that's okay, keep the carrier. She said okay and took our cat to the back. And that was it. No kind words, no sympathetic gestures, no \""Would you like a moment before I take him?\"" No \""I'm sorry.\"" Nothing. For us this was one of the worst days of our lives but nobody at the ARL seemed to care, or at least have been trained to pretend to care, one bit. \n\nThey get a couple stars for offering a necessary service. But other than that, this place will only be associated with making a terrible day that much worse with their lack of caring or empathy.",2
593,"Staff members here have always come up short. A past kennel worker  sold his litter of pit bull puppies in east liberty and the shelter was made aware of it  but excused it. \n\nThey will lie to surrendering families because they don't  want the cold hard truth, the good, bad and the ugly to leak out to the public. They lie ! \nThey kill many many animals because of a very subjective behavioral test that their dog hating staff performs .\n\nThey kill more pets for space than any other pittsburgh shelter.\n\nMany volunteers walk on eggshells here because they know an animals life is hanging in the balance and they are afraid to speak up or not allowed back in to volunteer . \n\nWeak leadership. This is the cities highest cat and dog death rate of any shelter or rescue in western pa",1

It appears that they routinely turn away (or kill, unless you state you will take them back) cats because they are \""overcrowded.\""  They will tell you that your cat has a \"" behavioral issue\"" to address turning said animal away.

595,This place is PHENOMENAL.\nI got my bunny here a few months ago and the ladies were so nice and helpful and they take SUCH good care of the animals.  They gave me a bit of hay and food for her that lasted me close to three months.  Then when we were leaving we saw a cage of six dwarf hamsters and they gave us a deal of 2/$10.\nI love my animals so much and I will always check here first for pets before anywhere else.,5
596,"This is a bizarre CVS, the kind you would only want to go to in a pinch, and maybe not even then.\n\nI went to this one with my husband a couple of times to pick up prescriptions, and the vibe from start to finish is so weird. Let's start with parking, which is in a lot behind the store. There's not a lot of visibility to the lot since it is on the back side of the CVS. Being that it is a pharmacy, there wouldn't be a back door or windows, so the lot has a feeling of dangerous seclusion.\n\nInside the store, everything I saw told me that \""this is a pharmacy that is in a rough neighborhood\"": shelves are only about 4'6\"" tall (presumably so workers can see what people are doing in the aisles); bizarre things are locked in cabinets with clear covers (regular brands of shampoo?!); beauty items regularly updated, weren't (I, er, have a nail polish problem; some of the products were about 4 seasons behind and quite a few polishes were separated); it feels like there isn't enough room for the products, which are disorganized and crammed onto shelves (reference the odd shelf height limitation).\n\nIf you can spare the gas and time, there is another a CVS on Center Ave within a mile or so or a Walgreen's (Penn Circ S+Trade St.) and a Rite Aid (Baum+Negley) within 1/2 mile.",2
597,"I go to this CVS all the time, since I work in the neighborhood.  I'm not a huge fan of it - I go mostly due to convenience.  Their greeting card selection is kind of lousy - I don't think I've ever found a decent card here.  I keep trying, every holiday or birthday, but every section is just full of duds.  Also, a lot of stuff is locked behind panels that you need the employees to unlock.  Like, razor blades.  And body wash.  BODY WASH?  It drives me nuts that I need to ask someone to open that shelf for me.  It makes no sense.  Staff is hit-or-miss with friendliness.  Some people are cheerful, and some act like they want you to go away.\n\nGood things - I love their coupon rewards.  I guess that's for all CVSes, not just this one, but it keeps me coming back because I get mad style coupons like every other visit.  And I had a good experience getting a walk-in flu shot from the pharmacy from the friendly (and quite attractive) pharmacist.  \n\nI'm just not crazy about the vibe here.  It just seems kind of depressing, with the stuff locked up and the smallish store with kind of a blargh selection.  I would much rather go to other pharmacies, but you can't beat this one for convenience (for me, anyway).  And they have a parking lot, if that helps you.",2
598,"Never again. Let me repeat, never again. \n\nThe primary reason I used to visit this store was to fill medical prescriptions. Due to their repeated inability and ineptness in fulfilling simple requests, I cannot continue to patronize this store.\n\nWalking into the store, you are given the stink-eye by a minimum wage security guard, which automatically gives you as a customer the warm and fuzzy \""guilty-until-proven guilty\"" feeling a shoplifter would get, which is what this store assumes everyone is based upon their decision to lock up the mouthwash and shampoo.\n\nThe pharmacy seems to be staffed by high school interns.  They have no concept of customer service, nor do they display any attention to detail, which is quite frankly frightening in a pharmacy.  I really think my chihuahua would make a better pharmacist than the people who work here - my chihuahua lick you to death before you got your prescriptions, but at least you'd get greeted when you approach the counter, and you'd get what you ask for.\n\nThe first mishap was when my wife and I changed prescription insurance providers.  i handed wanna-be pharmacist #1 my new insurance card.  After spending about 5 minutes staring into a computer screen behind the counter, he assured me that they had my insurance information in the computer.  I then returned in the following days to fill a prescription, trusting in what wanna-be pharmacist #1 had told me in the days prior.  When I went to check out the bill came to over $300, which I chalked up \""maybe I have to meet a deductible before the coverage kicks in.\""  Upon further research, we discovered that wanna-be pharmacist #1 had NOT updated my insurance information and had run the numerous prescriptions I filled under my old insurance.\n\nThe latest of many \""adventures\"" involved my wife calling in a prescription refill.  We stopped to pick it up on the way home from work, only to be told when we arrived that the insurance won't cover the refill until tomorrow.  Again, she CALLED and SPOKE to one of them to refill the prescription before showing up.  I guess it's too much to ask to TELL someone you're speaking to on the phone that they need to wait a day for the insurance to work before coming into a ghetto pharmacy to not pick up a prescription.  But hey, at least wanna-be pharmacist #2 behind the counter was dressed like a stripper, which gave me and my wife some comic relief for the moment.  \n\nWe then returned the following day to (again) pick up the prescription we called to have refilled 2 days prior.  We were first told by wanna-be pharmacist #3 that there weren't any prescriptions waiting for us.  After searching around for a few minutes, they \""found\"" my wife's prescription refill, but it would take 10 minutes to be ready.  Yes, the prescription that we tried to pick up yesterday would need another 10 minutes to be prepared.  Hence, I am now here, writing this review.\n\nNever, ever again.",1
599,"The times I've been here, its been an OK experience. However, their store hours are absolutely terrible. Closing at 7pm basically means they're never open when I would need to go there. Despite this being more conveniently located, Walgreens and Target end up getting most of my quick-shop business, simply due to late hours at night when I need to cook, clean, realize I'm out of toothpaste, have a headache, need a last-minute birthday card or whatever.",2
600,"This place is a disaster. I made an appointment online for 5:30PM. When I got there they refused me service, asserting they close at 6:00PM. Nevermind that online published hours are from 7AM to 7PM. Furthermore, their own system sent me a confirmation email for my 5:30PM appointment. Finally, this building is an absolute dump... Goodyear should be ashamed to have the brand attached to it.",1
601,"Tire replacement, was told it would take about 1.5 hours (when I had an existing appointment). It's almost been 2.5 hours and I'm still waiting. Ridiculous.",1
602,"I was just there this morning for a 10am appointment to get my summer tires swapped out for my winter tires.  My regular mechanic was overbooked and there is snow coming on Monday.  Receptionist scheduled me in just fine and the quoted price was reasonable, so I said OK.  Upon arrival, store manager stated that they will not touch the car as it has aftermarket rims and lug nuts.  He did not state any restrictions about aftermarket parts as they could not guarantee the work.  I asked if this was the case for all rims and he became a little snotty.  I had heart surgery a while back and I can't do the jack and tire work as not to tear at my incision/breastplate, if this was not the case with my health, I'd certainly take care of it.  Aftermarket rims are common - should not be an issue.  Last time I ever set foot in that place.",1
603,"Poor service that leaves tenants to fight mildew on their own. When asked to repair something, Rockwel Realty will do it on their terms and refuse to give you notice of when they will enter your apartment despite multiple requests\n\nWhen asked to clean mildew, they did in fact clean it with bleach while also spilling bleach on my sheets and ruining them. When told about this problem and that the mildew returned they said it was my fault for not turning the heat up and that damage done during service is an inherent risk the tenant is responsible for and nothing could be done. Their solution was for me to clean the mildew instead of properly insulating the unit to prevent mildew. \n\nThe entire building also has severe electrical problems that causes all lights to be replaced twice a month. No permanent fixes are made to existing units, but there is constant construction to expand an old building so they can collect more rent.",1
604,"Exceptionally poor maintenance service. They refused to start heat before mid-October and the centrally heated apartment grew very chilly as Fall progressed. On another occasion, they refused to change a rusted and weak lock. The lock eventually gave way and I locked myself into the bathroom. After the incident, I requested that the lock be changed immediately, and one of the owners threatened saying that we were in default of our lease agreement for not keeping our apartment as clean as when it had been leased to us. Dealing with Rocco and Elisabeth is nice, but good luck getting anything done with Nick who seems to be increasingly handling the operations of Rockwel.",1
605,I'm a lawyer in NY and I'm visiting a friend in Pittsburgh. I am blown away by the code violations in this unit. The tenants said they have reported these issues to the owner and to no avail. I am hoping to direct these tenants to a lawyer in PA.,1
606,"This is one of my two favorite coffeehouses in town. It took me far too long to come around and love Tazza D'oro. A horrible ex of mine loved this place and I admit that this soured me. I regret the time I wasted not going here. The dark wood inside comforts me. The small tables outside are a great place to spend the summer. \n\nTazza D'Oro brews Batdorf and Bronson beans (amazing), provides Enrico pastries (amazing) free wireless (amazing) and one of the most talented and friendly staffs I've ever met (amazing). Everyone who works there is *so* nice and *so* good at what they do. \n\nThey have a small menu of local/fresh food that looks amazing, but I have never actually eaten it. The espresso served here is actually better than the average shot served at Batdorf and Bronson locations in Olympia, WA. I talked about this with one of the barristas at TD'o and they were offended - \""we calibrate our machines the same, we use the same beans, the exact same blends and milks and everything, it can't be different.\"" Sorry, Tazza D'oro, you are better. \n\nThe lines get long on weekend mornings, but they move quickly. There's a sense of community nestled here, just off the \""main drag\"" of Highland Park, between Bryant st. and the reservoir. This is where you can pick up your CSA shipment for the week, where multiple weekly bike rides originate, where there are lively discussion groups meeting nearly every day. The percentage of students is low. Like the rest of Pittsburgh, there's a good chance you'll run into someone you know, but generally I see people I like and miss, which is different than the norm in Pittsburgh for me.",5
607,"Tazza D'Oro has a generally European decor, with dark, rich colors and textures, and a cozy layout that makes the most of the space. The espresso is, bar none, the best I've had - including my admittedly limited travels in Italy. It's stellar espresso - rich, thick, potent without being sour or bitter, with unique nuances that vary slightly depending on the shot and the weather, but are always fantastic.\n\nThe coffee is also terrific, and Tazza D'Oro uses Batdorf & Bronson beans - the best I've ever had for home grinding. They have a good selection of pastries and cookies, as well as a broad selection of tasty sandwiches that come with a satisfying side salad.\n\nIn addition, they have a wonderful selection of teas; I'm no expert, and don't know their supplier, but the half-dozen different blends I've tried were all memorably flavorful.\n\nAll that, and it's a lovely center of community, where you can bring your laptop or a book or a friend and spend the day. No one is rushed out the door, and there almost always seems to be a little room for your studies or conversation.",5
608,The coffee here was excellent! Had a double espresso. Apparently their roaster is in Santa Cruz Ca. Large selection of French Press Coffees. Baked goods did not look too great but that is not why I came here. Atmosphere is very mellow and comfortable. Also has Wifi which works! Nice to find a place like this when traveling. Is in the middle of a residential area and there doesnt seem to be anything else around here.,5
609,"I love tazza.. Their coffees are excellent and its a great place to enjoy a relaxing evening..I also like their Baklawa, sandwiches and Brownies..",5
610,"Best coffee in Pittsburgh, without a doubt. Believe the hype. I've been going here for years, and every visit is a pleasure.",5
611,"local, friendly businesses serving a great product DO still exist.",5
612,"Reasons:\n\n1. LOCATION and setting: Highland Park is simply lovely - makes you feel as if you are in a small English town, where time has stood still. The art and small tables inside and outside are charming.\n2. Socially Responsible:Fair trade and international array of coffee.\n3. Fresh Meat:  Local pasture raised meat/ local produce in their tasty panini's.\n4. Nice crowd and staff.",3
613,"The coffee here is amazing (I love when the baristas take the effort to make patterns in the foam). The baristas were extremely friendly and the pastries looked delicious. While there are a number of tables, Enrico's was busy even on a Friday night...I would imagine that it would be hard to find a table during peak hours.",5
614,"I've read countless 5-star reviews of this coffee shop and I'm sorry, but I don't wholly agree with, well, everyone else; so, here's my slightly alternative take on the cafe.  I'm aware, like many reviewers on this site, that not every place is aiming for me as the target customer; but even still, there's no way this is a five star coffee shop. Yes, the coffee is good and if I happen to be lost in highland park someday on foot, I'm sure I'd stop in to get it again.  But the place itself was a turn off, despite the interesting people that it attracts.  Glossy refinished exposed wood beams, fake grape vines over the windows, and odd light fixtures create a tacky atmosphere I can't overlook or sit in.  I think this is a great coffee shop if you happen to own a house in highland park, but for me it's going to be voluto or espresso a mano from now on - it's just not worth the drive.",3
615,"This is where I learned what good espresso tastes like. If you make it to Highland Park, stop there and get some great neighborhood atmosphere.",4
616,"I'll preface this by reminding anyone who reads my reviews that 3 stars is a good review for me--it means it's good, but I'm not going to go out of my way for it.  \n\nEnrico's Tazza D'oro Cafe is definitely very good--I love the location in Highland Park, and the early morning crowd seemed pretty nice and very eclectic.  We even ran in to a friend while we were there and had a nice chat.  \n\nMy girlfriend and I ordered lattes which were excellent--the space was overall very nice inside and while the selection of pastries was a bit thin I would say the ones they had looked good.  I do wish they had more outdoor seating, though.  It's tough to make the \""I'm a fan\"" list for coffee houses.  I'll try it again and may change my review in the future.  \n\nWhile I\""m on the note of Highland Park, I want to join the chorus of people who are dismayed by the recent hit and run involving the two bikers in Highland Park.  Accidents (no matter how horrible) do happen, and as such I'm not as angry about the actual accident;  but to just drive away and leave people severely injured by the side of the road is pretty wretched behavior.  At this point, i only hope that if you are the person who did this, you will at least dedicate the rest of your life to doing good to balance your to-date lousy behavior.\n\nIt's never too late.",3
617,"I think the lattes have improved since my last review and their soy cappuccinos are the best I've ever had, in fact, I never even cared for them until trying Tazza D'oro's. I still hold their teas in high regard. However, the food here sucks. They've always had a limited sandwich menu, but at some point even that has been reduced to three choices. I am a sucker for a good veggie sandwich, especially in combination with caffeine. Even though Enrico's is an easy walk from my home, I find myself either walking further or driving elsewhere for the caffeinated lunch experience. I guess they are trying to keep focus on the brews, but I don't think it's that hard to do both; I mean the staff seems highly competent, they have a kitchen and sandwiches are pretty simple recipes to follow and learn. With a new lunch joint in the 'hood (Park Bruges), why not expand lunch options rather than downgrade to the point of forfeiting without even the slightest struggle?",3
618,"Maybe Tazza D'Oro doesn't need another review, but I guess it never hurts to lend your voice to the chorus of those praising a good, solid and well-run local business.  \n\nThe coffee selection is terrific.  The baristas are professional and courteous.  No, they are not chatty, but they are polite and friendly.  I'm not there for conversation, but for good coffee.  And that's what you get.  \n\nThe pastries and snacks are fine.  Good variety.  \n\nThe atmosphere is JUST what I want when I need a cup of coffee: relatively quiet, comfortable and calming.  \n\nWhen it first opened (how long ago how?) it was mobbed by some of my neighbors (I live in Highland Park) who adopted it as their private club and often seemed peeved at \""others\"" who stopped by.   They've either relaxed or found other obsessions.  The clientele is, as folks said, eclectic and invigorating.  \n\nIt's become our after-dinner spot after a meal at Park Bruges or Smiling Banana Leaf, too!",4
619,"Still one of the best places to get soy capps, but they no longer have an extensive tea list. What's left is not a bad selection, but there are dramatically less choices, so it's no longer where I would go to sample new varieties of tea. Sandwich menu is even more severely limited and it seems that pretty much all the food is provided by U.S. Foods, or the like; nothing is local. It'd be way cool if they would source their pastries and bread locally. Until then, it is simply a great place to get coffee and espresso, with nice vibes and pleasant service.",3
620,"Great variety of coffee and methods (press, Chemex, pour-over).  I did not get a chance to try to the espresso, but it looked very good as well. Verve and Olympia are two very solid roasters and provide a wealth of choices. \n\nStaff was very helpful, location great. All around a good place in Pittsburgh.",4
621,"I had always meant to visit Enrico's, and since my friend recently moved to the neighborhood, it was a perfect opportunity to cross it off my list.\n\nSo here's what I liked: the cappuccino was perfect. It's an awesome cappuccino, topped with a cute foam art leaf.\n\nHere's what I didn't like: Sometimes I take my cappuccino plain, sometimes I take it with a shot of syrup. On this occassion I asked if I could get amaretto syrup, which they had. But the barista responded: \""No, you can't.\"" He said they only make their cappuccino plain, and if I liked sweet, he could make me something special, but I would have to trust his taste. Here's the thing...I don't like sweet! I don't have much of a sweet tooth. I just wanted a tiny bit of sweet, so I didn't think trusting his mystery concoction was a good idea. I just got it plain.\n\nI'm not a big fan of coffee shop snobbery nor the fact that this guy seemed to have sterotyped me as a Starbucks-guzzling yuppie who had to be shown what a \""REAL\"" cappuccino tasted like. Please, I lived in Italy, I've had a \""REAL\"" cappuccino...but right now, I want a flavor shot in it. I still tipped because I wasn't sure if it was the barista or just a general rule at this place, and he did offer to make me something different. I just don't get what the deal is here...why do they even bother having flavor syrups if you're not \""allowed\"" to add them to your drink? \n\nIt's a 5-star cappuccino for sure, but I had to subtract a star for the attitude.",4
622,"BEST COFFEE IN PITTSBURGH!\n\nYou might think there is better coffee elsewhere.  You're wrong!\n\nI love this coffee shop, and there is a second location the Gates Building at CMU that I like to go to--their panini are to die for.\n\nI love this place, and you will too!",5
623,"Best coffee it Pittsburgh? Maybe, but this place is certainly competitive. French Press, Drip, espresso, or pour over? You name it they've got it. Only downside of this place is a limited food and pastry selection. If it is just coffee you want you this is the place. It is it a bit snobbish sure, but not nearly as much as many of the other coffee shops in Pittsburgh.",4
624,"This is a quiet little nook in Highland Park that is perfect for tea, coffee, snacks and getting some work done or catching up with an old friend. I used to frequent this place much more when I lived in Pittsburgh, but I still make an effort to come back a few times a year for the ambience. It is great in the summer and fall because they have a few tables outside.  The staff is great and the prices are reasonable, too. The only change I could think of would be to put on some soft easy listening music. It'd make the vibe a little more comfortable!",4
625,Really hard to find a good cup of coffee in the states... I'd say this is the best  cappuccino I've had since Italy.,5
626,"So I went on a marathon 2 hour bike ride right before heading to Enrico's for the first time and on my last mile all I could think was \""iced caffe mocha, iced caffe mocha\"" over and over again.  Did I mention that I forgot my water bottle on my ride too?  I was a desperate woman at the end of that one.\n\nSo I got home aired myself out and drove myself to Enrico's since a previous yelper mentioned she had the best iced caffe mocha there.  There was easy street parking right out front and I really liked that it was nestled in the middle of a neighborhood and not a loud crowded street.  Tables are large enough for good work space and folks had their laptops out inside enjoying the free wifi while the tables outside were filled with friends.\n\nSo why the 3 stars?  Well the iced caffe mocha was a bit subpar.  The syrup was all at the bottom leaving my first couple sips very watery.  Could have been a better mix.  Would I give this another try?  Sure but I definitely will ask for a nice hard shake of my iced caffe mocha before taking a swig.\n\nThe coffee place at the Walnut Mall in Shadyside is still my favorite for the iced coffee of the year award.  Try the iced OR blended ghiradelli mocha when you are shopping Shady-style - AWESOME!",3
627,"The coffee was ok, but the service and ambiance left much to be desired. The place was dirty, with straw wrappers etc on the floor. The light fixtures were too modern to be considered cozy. There were four people on staff but it took at least 2 minutes for one of them to stop gossiping with the others and take our order.  I got the feeling that this place has had a lot of success and the owners have let things slide. It was ok, but in looking for a coffee shop to make my regular hangout, I would not go back.",2
628,We ordered a double espresso which looked more like a single shot. Cozy coffeeshop with an ample amount of seating.\n\nThere were different types of coffee available for purchase to drink there and beans to take home.\n\nCute neighborhood coffeeshop type feel.,3
629,"I adore this place! The light green walls are serene, the chairs and tables are comfortable, and I love their little brownies with three kinds of chocolate chips in them! The coffee is perfectly smooth and rich, which is the most important thing to get right. (I'm not into masking the taste of burnt espresso with a mocha!) If a place can provide me with a cup of coffee that doesn't taste like it will give me an ulcer, I'll be a fan for life. The only other Pittsburgh place where I've found coffee this delicious was at Commonplace Coffee in Squirrel Hill. I went to college near Chicago and come from California. I count Intelligentsia and Blue Bottle Coffee as some of my favorite places, so I mean it when I say the coffee here is wonderful. Try it out, you won't be let down.",5
630,"The people who work here are very rude. I have gone back a few times thinking it may have just been the person working that day was just a rude person, but no it happen every time. I am not a young hip person and felt very out of place there. It is like you are walking into someone's house and bothering them. The people working behind the counter act like you are interfering with there conversation. Plus it is very dirty. Perhaps the people working there should try cleaning the place instead of talking to each other. I will not go back again.",1
631,"Best Cafe in Pittsburgh - like a hidden gem. The sandwiches are delicious, you must try the chocolate chip brownie, and the coffee is great and made exactly the way you like it.",4
632,"went in as a guest of a friend of mine who is a member there... nice atmosphere.  LOT of oldddd folks and they seem to market themselves as \""Silver Fitness\"" sort of fitness center...

633,"This is not a review on this gym. It is a review on their customer/membership service. I just called there. All I wanted to know is what their monthly fees were. Simple right? Wrong. They want your name and phone number and the rights to your first born child and then they won't even tell you anything without you physically coming to them to \""talk\"" about what's best for you. I took psychology classes, I know what they are trying to do by talking to you face to face. I am sorry, but I want a gym, not a drug dealer. I don't need you to try to shove your products down my throat, I want to go somewhere to work out and be left alone. (That's why I wear headphones and don't make eye contact). \n\nI just wish places like this would give you a straight answer about their membership fees without hassling you. I won't go here now, period, because I don't believe in these kind of tactics. Just be straight with people, is that so hard?",2

I drink this beer regularly, and something was wrong with the beer. Its definitely hard to describe, but something is always off (others in my party notice it too).\n\nThe food is hit or miss. I got the French onion soup last time. It was good. Nothing ground breaking, but solid soup. I've had the pork nachos and they were blah.",2

641,"I found Buffalo Blues to be merely OK.  I thought that their prices were a bit high for the size of the portions, and their wings were rather small.  I actually liked the wing sauces I tried, though (red hot and spicy garlic).

For $10 I would certainly get my money's worth, and the quality of the food was OK.\n\nSurprisingly, lots of vegetarian options.

I don't think I have ever eaten the other food here except for the wings because they are pretty good. The only downside to this place is that service is really really slow.",3
644,"I ate at this restaurant last night with three dining companions.  We decided to sit in the bar area at a high table which had views of the ample number of TV's.  The beer list that they had was nice with about 20 different beers on tap and a nice selection of bottles.  I ended up having the Philly Shackamaximum with my waitress telling me that she preferred the Long Trails Porter.  It was served in a chilled glass and tasted pretty good to me.\n\nFor dinner we attempted to start off by ordering the Blues BBQ Pork Nachos.  We were told that they did not have any pork and so we were not able to order it.  At this point we were also told that they did not have any veggie burgers as well.  So we started out with the Chicken Chili Nachos.  They were pretty good and were covered with real cheese as opposed to nacho cheese which was to my liking.  For dinner I decided on having the Lovely Lisa's Salad since I love both blue cheese and granny smith apples.  Upon receiving the salad I dug in.  The chicken was cooked nicely, moist and tender, and there was a nice coating of blue cheese on the salad.  However there was a problem since there were no granny smith apples on the salad.  Whenever the waitress came back to check on us I asked about the missing apples.  She went to the kitchen and came back and told us that they were out of them and promptly left.  I am not normally one to complain but I feel like something could have been substituted in for the apples, or that I should have been told before ordering or they could have discounted the salad but none of that occurred.  It is sad that it happened too because the rest of my salad was pretty good but that left the proverbial bitter taste in my mouth.\n\nThe bottom line is that I have been here before and the food is generally good.   However, leaving a major part off an item and being told that the kitchen is out without any rectification will make me think twice before returning here again.  It is a shame because Buffalo Blues does have potential.",2
645,"My coworkers and I had lunch here on a Friday afternoon, and it was a pretty \""meh\"" experience for me.  We were seated all the way in the back of the restaurant/bar, in a room that I didn't even know existed, so apparently Buffalo Blues is bigger than I thought.  It's nice that they have some tables away from the main bar area.\n\nI went for the Hot Veggie Sandwich with sweet potato fries, in some kind of attempt to be healthy.  The sweet potato fries weren't too bad, with a good flaky crisp.  The sandwich left something to be desired.  It wasn't hot, first of all - I'd say the (slightly crumbly) bread had been toasted with the cheese, but all the veggie ingredients were cold, leaving an overall lukewarm effect on the sandwich.  The hummus spread didn't taste much like hummus, and was thick and pastey instead of smooth and creamy.  There wasn't a lot of exciting flavor,  It was just belly-filler, really.  I guess that's what I get for trying to order healthy here.  \n\nI just wasn't much interested in it, and I don't think it was worth anywhere near $8.  I better have a darn good sandwich if I'm paying $8.  Also, it was relatively small in size - I don't have a huge appetite, so that wasn't a problem.  But I guess I think an $8 sandwich should either be awesomely delicious, or big enough that I can take half home.  Buffalo Blues was neither.\n\nNot particularly interested in returning for any reason.",2
646,"The best thing about Buffalo Blues revolves around Sundays during football season. For me, personally, it's one of the best places to catch an NFL game...especially if you're not a Steelers fan. On any given Sunday, you'll find fans of just about every team in the NFL taking in a game, so the atmosphere is a positive one. Seating is the only issue. Get there early or you might end up standing to see your particular game, as seating can be a premium by the time the games begin. Luckily, the TV's (there are lots of them) are all labeled with the day's matchups, so finding the game you're looking for isn't a problem.\n\nThe draft beer selection usually has something for everyone, from local craft brews by East End Brewing, to seasonals and your simpler standards (hello, PBR), so if you're a beer person, you won't be disappointed.\n\nAs far as service goes, it's hit-or-miss. I've had mostly great service at the bar, but I've also had average to below average service at tables. During bigger sporting events - primarily Steelers games - the service can be even more iffy due to the sheer volume of people in the bar area.\n\nOverall, I have to rate the food as average. I LOVE their boneless wings, and their wing sauces are all very excellent. Their pulled pork is really tender and delicious, as well, but most of their sandwiches and burgers are simply average. The fries can be either really good, or too soggy and greasy. I think the inconsistency in the quality of the cooking is the main issue. The menu reads really well, which raises your expectations, but sometimes the execution will leave you a little disappointed. It's never horrible, but you'll rarely be blown away by your meal.\n\nIn the end, I'm giving Buffalo Blues a higher rating based on the experience during sporting events, which, let's face it, is the real draw of a \""sports bar.\"" As far as sports bars go, it's my favorite place to catch a game. They always get a good crowd for games (whether Sundays during the NFL season, Saturdays during big college games, or for Pens games), and if you stick to the wings and beer, odds are your experience will be great. There's a good chance that you can go in and find fans of your team if you're an out-of-towner looking for a game, and the crowd is much more accepting, friendly, and relaxed than the crowds I've experience in other sports bars in town. Most of my average experiences revolved around non-game times when you try to get a more traditional meal and realize that there are just better options in Shadyside for lunch and dinner.",3
647,"So, I went to Buffalo Blues tonight for the second time (not the second time tonight, the second time in my life) for dinner and some drinks, and to sum up my experience in a few words, both times it was about what I expected.  Just a fine sports bar - no more, no less.\n\nI'll start with the drinks.  They have a good draft selection, and supposedly they've got a nice bottle list too, though I didn't have a look at it, so I can't judge; and the Happy Hour special compliments it well ($1 off all drinks 5PM-7PM).   Plus they have East End drafts at $3/glass all the time, though they were out of Big Hop (the only East End choice they have) when I was there (I don't know if this is a regular occurrence, but if it is, they better do something about it).  The bartenders were friendly and quick to serve, qualities that carried over to the food service as well.\n\nThe menu has a pretty good selection of pub-y and Southwestern-themed foods from which I picked the black bean and corn quesadilla.  Although at the end I was running low on guacamole (which is $1 extra for a small cup) and sour cream, this is a small quibble.  The meal overall  was good, and since I got it with the happy hour special, I can't complain.  One thing I will mention is that there aren't too many vegetarian choices on the menu (I'm not vegetarian, but I try not to eat too much meat, so I notice these things), so if you're a vegetarian, I would try to look up the menu beforehand just to be sure there's something for you.\n\nI know I haven't said much negative about Buffalo Blues in this review, yet I'm still giving it only three stars.  This is the kind of place that makes me appreciate the \""word versions\"" of the ratings that Yelp gives us.  \""A-OK,\"" which, if you didn't know, is how Yelp describes three-star reviews, is exactly how I would describe Buffalo Blues.  The comparison I keep going to in my head is Die Hard 2.  It's not nearly as good as its predecessor, but it's still something I'm fine with popping in every once in a while when there's nothing better to watch.\n\nTo sum it up - I'm not a big sports guy.  Buffalo Blues, though it is a sports bar, is not the place that would sway me to go to watch a game there with my friends (I'll still say that some kind of playoff game of the Steelers-Ravens I watched at Big Jim's was one of the best sports-watching experiences of my life).  And, judging it as a sports bar, it didn't do anything to justify my giving it anything but \""just fine.\""  But I'm sure I'll go back there for happy hour again sometime.",3
648,"When Hotlick's died, Buffalo blues was born. It really is a Pittsburgh staple but come on....\n\nFood is really, really average. I love the ribs and wings, but it's about the same as any other rib place in the city, only they charge an arm and a leg for it. This place is for the people that feel that they are at a real rib place, but don't want to cross Centre or Penn Ave. to get real ribs. It, technically is in Shadyside so your Mercedes will be safe! \n\nThe ambiance: The restaurant is always crowded. Not just crowded, but packed with teens underage drinking, families with too many kids that overflow to your \""space\"" and collage kids who also spill over from the bar. IT'S LOUD AS HELL!!! Forget about a nice quiet dinner. There seems to be no consideration for customers at all. Last time I was there, there was a St. Patrick's Day party (it was NOT St. Patrick's Day) that took over the whole place. Though the staff tried (nah, they didn't really try) to keep them in the so called \""party room\"" I was bumped into several times, spilled my beer, and couldn't hear my wife speak. But as long as they got their money; they could give a crap. Oh and there are like 100 TVs to interrupt any conversation at your table.\n\nWant to sit in the bar area? Good luck. You will see a mix of drunk people, women who look like high-end prostitutes and college kids who are only missing a beer bong. Also IT'S LOUD AS HELL!!!!!!!!\n\nThe \""wonderful\"" Staff: It seems like it's everyone's first day. To put it lightly; the staff suck! To be sure, you will be waiting for your your drinks, food and bill for a very, very long time. Expect to be there for about 2-3 hours. The wait staff are forgetful, inattentive and very sloppy at their job. It pains me to leave any tip for them. Most of the staff are hot, stacked, absolutely stupid and should be working at Hooters not a place where your bill will be upwards of $50 for two people. Be prepared to be met with this saying, \""Oh, like ohmygod, I am so sorry i forgot that, he he!\"" (oh she's twisting her finger in her hair while she's talking). You will get bad service...period (in fact, I can't remember the last time a wait person actually wrote down my order, and they're idiots so no worries).\n\nThe food: Kinda good. Menu is huge, you'll find something you like. But I go there about 2-3 times a year for the food. It is way too expensive. Do not take a date there. Your average bill for a meal with actual proteins will run you in the high 40s without booze. There are so many bar-food places that don't claim to be high class that are just as good as this place. I grew up with the rib sauce and love it, but for your average consumer, skip it!\n\nThis place is a wannabe sports bar that tries too hard to be high end. Just watch out for the vomiting college kids with trust funds...they're everywhere!!!!!",2
649,"Food: 2 stars. It's really not very good. Especially the entirety of the combination platter they make with chicken fingers and wings. Blue cheese wasn't bad though. My wedge salad was enormous- more like a half head of lettuce than a wedge. Nice and fresh though. \n\nDrinks: 3 stars, for the decent variety (better than expected from a place like this) and the game time specials.\n\nService: 3 stars. Could have been better, could have been worse. Friendly but unattentive and not good at realizing when to come to the table. (Hint: if one person calls you over for a drink, make sure the rest of us are set before running away.) \n\nAtmosphere: 4 stars - really good job of having enough televisions for everyone to see the game/s and marking each so you know what's on. \n\n1 Bonus star for accommodating the Pittsburgh area Buffalo Bills fans! GO BILLS!!!",4
650,"Oh how the mighty have fallen. This place used to be good. Something happened and the wings are small dry and just generally bad. Since wings are supposed to be their thing this is pretty unacceptable.\n\nWriting this review makes me sad because it is a great place to drink beer and watch the game. The beer is reasonably priced but the food is just expensive for what it is. I essentially live across the street so I know I'll go back, but I hope some of these poor reviews will help them turn things around in the kitchen.",2
651,Good fun place to watch games while drinking and eating chicken wings or sandwiches.They have a good selection of wings and decent beer. I try different kinds of wings  every time  I go in but so far spicy garlic has been my favorite. This is a typical sports bar.,4
652,"Good place to watch a sports game.  Beer specials were good. Food is very overpriced though.  The wings are about the worst I've ever had... and I've had alot of wings growing up in Buffalo, NY.",2
653,"This is the worst service (or worst non-service) I have ever experienced. Since I can't give zero stars, I'm giving the service one. We didn't eat anything so I can't comment on the food. \n\nMy husband and I went to Buffalo Blues last night. We stood at the empty hostess stand for a while. When no one came to seat us, and we couldn't find anyone to seat us, we seated ourselves figuring that's what we were supposed to do.\n\nThe bar was full, but not packed. There were only two other tables with guests, one of which had empty plates on the table during this entire experience. After what seemed like forever, my husband got up to find a server. He literally walked around the restaurant to find someone, but couldn't. He then tried to ask the bartender, but she was just as elusive. When he finally found a server,  she acted totally shocked that we were there. Maybe if someone had been doing their job, they wouldn't be surprised to find hungry people in a restaurant.\n\nShe came to our table, got our drinks (a soda and a water) and asked us if we were ready to order. When we said no she said she would be back. We could see her chit chatting with another server, but again, couldn't get her attention to come back to take our order. After another ten minutes of waiting for her to return, we put a few dollars on the table for my soda and we left. We ordered a pizza at a local shop and picked it up on our way home.\n\nTwenty-five minutes passed and we only get drinks? Such a waste of time. It took us 20 minutes just to make the drive there, 25 of waiting, and another 20 to get home. That's over an hour of our evening completely wasted which left us starving after a hard days work. I used to work as a server so I could understand if the place was busy and the staff was short handed, but it was basically a dead night table top wise. I will NEVER go back.",1
654,"Their food is okay and beer selection is diverse and good. \n\nThe problem i have with the place is that Buffalo Bills fans congregate here and cheer on every mediocre play their football team makes, (or almost makes) so it's like watching the Superbowl except it's a losing record team stopping a team on third down.",3
655,"I hate this place. I have been here many times and I am just finally getting around to writing a review.  Let me state that my wife made me go here tonight because my friends wanted to and she said I need to indulge their interests. Even if they suck. \n\nBuffalo Blues is like a Hooters, except the girls where more clothes and are not as good looking. The service is horrendous and the food may be better at Hooters.  The beer selection is decent at Buffalo Blues but it is expensive and they often run out of things that are still on the board.\n\nMy friends like going for all you can eat wing night but frankly I don't get it. You get 10 wings up front they will give more wings 5 at a time. The problem is that you get those wings in 30 minute intervals.  So the max you could eat is 55 wings. Did I mention that  the wings are really tiny and the sauce is tossed on like a Jackson Pollack painting.  They also charge extra for blue cheese or ranch.  The wings do not come with celery. This is a crime against humanity and the city of Buffalo.  \n\nI chose to detour from wings tonight and ordered a chicken sandwich. Apparently this was a bad choice.  It took a full hour to get my food. It was so long that the rest of the table ate their wings and ordered more and the waitress didn't think this was a problem. When my meal did arrive everything was cold. The sandwich was ok, but the fries were just tiny pieces that were limp and flavorless.\n\nI paid $16 for a beer and a sandwich that my friends had to wait for me to eat to leave.  I would say I won't go back, but apparently I like my friends more than I like good food and service.",1
656,"Went here this past Saturday afternoon, 11/2. My friends and I sat at the pretty much empty bar for over 5 minutes with no service. The bartender walked by us a few times and didn't even acknowledge we were there. As we walked out, we saw the bartender on the phone and other staff members standing in the back chatting. We went next door to Mad Mex and got much better service!",1
657,Loved the hot vegetarian sandwich. Not easy to find veggie dishes which don't feel like a compromise. This was great. Excellent service from waitress Ariella with the long black pony tail (don't know her last name). Nice casual atmosphere. Resonable prices.,4
658,"I have a love-hate relationship with this place...  \n\nI love it because it's extremely close to me (so, it's convenient when I'm craving a beer) and the atmosphere on Sundays is outstanding.  I'm a giant Steeler fan, but you'll probably find fans from all 32 teams in Buffalo blues, which gives it a fun and exciting feel during NFL Sundays.  \n\nHowever, I hate it because I believe the alcohol and food is overpriced.  The food wouldn't rub me the wrong way so much if I thought it was worth the price, but I don't.  Not even a little bit.  The only thing I have found to be delicious there were the wings; however, you can go to almost any other bar to get delicious and cheaper wings.  So, it's not really much of a win at all.  Also, I want to have a handful of beers during the games, but I don't want to empty my pockets doing it.  So, all in all, I recommend going once and awhile (mainly on Sundays) for a beer or two, but other than that it's not worth much of a visit.",2
659,"I have mixed feelings about this place.  I'll say up front: I only ever go there on Sundays for football, and I would never go there for any other reason.  It is the only bar I know of in the city where you can reliably find every NFL game televised and enjoy your Sunday if you're not a Steelers fan.  Pretty much every team is represented by the crowd on Sundays, with a disproportional number of Bills and Redskins fans.  The crowd is generally friendly, with many of the same faces from week to week.\n\nThey tend to have a wide selection of beers that rotates pretty regularly, but wide selection doesn't always mean good selection.  That said, sometimes they get some really great beers that you wouldn't expect to find at a sports bar.  Whatever you do, don't order a bloody Mary, they're atrociously bad.  The staff is almost universally friendly, with the exception of one barback who seems to always be in a bad mood and rude to customers (he often takes over as bartender later in the day on Sundays).  That said, the wait staff don't seem to know much about the food or beers that are offered, often mis-characterizing new beers that are on tap or giving wrong information about things on the menu.\n\nThe food is mediocre and over-priced.  When two of us go for one game on a Sunday, drink 3-4 beers each and each order an entr\u00e9e, we generally end up with a tab in the $80-90 range, depending on what we're drinking that day.  In a city that is almost universally accommodating to vegetarians, this place is most decidedly not.  They have a veggie burger which is actually pretty good, but it's the only decent thing on the menu for a vegetarian to eat (there is also a grilled cheese sandwich and a veggie sandwich, both of which are bland to the point of tasteless.  It's like eating plain bread).  They have 4 entr\u00e9e salads, and every one of them has meat as a defining ingredient.  They don't even have beans so you could have decent veggie nachos.  I know, it's a sports bar, but I don't want to eat the same veggie burger every Sunday for 17 weeks.  It gets old.  Fast.\n\nUpshot?  In the absence of a new sports bar opening up, we'll be back next season, but not before then.",3
660,"To be honest, I think this is one of the worst bars in the entire city.  The food was sub-par, even for bar food, the service was awful, especially during a game. I do enjoy a good sports bar, but I think the thing I hated most about this place was the other people that frequent there. It's the quintessential Shadyside bar, equipped with doughebag bros that went to the same fraternity in college and the Jersey Shore bimbos who pine for them. The last time that I went there were two guys throwing up outside of the bar on the sidewalk. I fully admit this is a subjective review, because this bar was obviously not my scene- but I still do not like this place at all.",1
661,"Unfortunately, the service we were given ruined our overall experience at Buffalo Blues. We sat down and put in our drink order.  My husband was excited about the amount of beers they had on tap. Fifteen minutes later and still without drinks, we saw our server trying to hunt the bartender down. Once the bartender finally started working on our drinks, she realized the keg for the beer my husband ordered was tapped. We were sitting at the booths right next to the bar but instead of the bartender just telling us so we could make another decision and get our drinks as soon as possible, she waited for the waitress to come back to tell her. Then, the waitress came back and did not apologize at all but simply said that he had to pick a different beer because they were out of that one. Anyway, long story short, it took way too long to get drinks and there was never any recognition from the staff of the issue. The restaurant seemed poorly managed and subpar. We will not be back.",1
662,"I would take advantage of All you can eat wings on Wednesday. \n\nWe went on a regular oll Sunday night and even though the wings were tasty, my frugal self would've rather had AYCE. We tried a variety of sauces (we ordered 20 wings and every 5 can be a different flavor) The Buffalo Blues sauce was ok. It was just their signature bbq sauce. WE also tried garlic parm, honey teriyaki & gold rush. All were ok.\n\n The boozy buffalo is a good drink. It consist of smirnoff orange, tanquery, jose cuervo, captain, triple sec, OJ, fresh squeezed lemon and a splash of Coke. I seriously felt fabulous after one. It's served in a mason jar. ($12)\n\nLauren was a nice server even though the table in front of us put her through some bs-- they ate all of their food then complained to the server and asked for the manager complaining that what they got it wasn't what they ordered... no idea why they waited until every scrap of food was gone to complain but you know, you'll have that. kudos to Lauren for keeping a smile on her face.",3
663,"I've been to Buffalo Blues a few times at Happy Hour, and met my daughter there last night for Happy Hour specials as advertised on the web site.  First clue:  no Happy Hour promos mentioned in the bar except for the Yeungs and Wings (which was not what we were looking for).  We came close to leaving as my beer was off the draft list, but we decided to stay and were disappointed that my daughter's choice was already gone although still ilsted.  The food was awful, the service worse.  Maybe a busser should clean the table after removing the dirty dishes--our table was a sticky  mess.  The service:  one beer to the table at a time.  Next round I saw two beers go to a three-top, removed and sent to the bar, poured out and the glasses refilled and brought to us.  Someone else's food was brought to our table, our fries came out --lukewarm---but our wing order never went in.  So we got our garlic parm wings which tasted like old overcooked chicken and was way too crispy and greasy for my taste.  We ate two each, then told the server we didn't want them.  She offered to take them off, but we told her that wasn't necessary, so they took off 1/2 the price as a Customer service gesture.  Still, we had a Happy Hour bill for 1/2 eaten fries, barely touched wings, and 6 drafts total of $45 at a dirty table.  At least the place was quiet--there were empty tables everywhere.  I think we're done here.",1
664,"This is my go-to place for curing a hangover. I don't know what it is about Chinese buffets the day after a long night of round after round, but it does the trick. I also like to come here before I go grocery shopping at the nearby Trader Joe's because everybody knows it's a bad idea to go shopping for food stuff on an empty stomach.\n\nAll of my favorites are here, veggie lo mien, string beans, mac 'n cheese, crab rangoon, hot & sour soup, I haven't seen dan bing (egg pancakes) in awhile but when they have them, they are out of this world with some peanut sauce. Another thing I miss is creamed spinach... I have yet to see this dish on a Pittsburgh buffet but if you go outside of the city it is a staple among Chines buffets.\n\nAnother star got knocked off for the lack of fresh fruit on the dessert table. Canned pineapple and mandarin oranges will always carry that metallic taste to them that is just no comparison to having the real thing.",3
665,"The food here is good but it is not exceptional. \n\n I've been to this restaurant occasionally for a couple years and the menu hasn't changed at all. There is the typical Asian fare such as General Tso's, fried rice, noodles, stuffed shrimp and dumplings. There is also American macaroni and cheese, home fries and ham. \n\nWhen I go to China Garden, I always request a carry out container as I find it nauseating to sit in the dining area and see other patrons pile their plates with astonishing heaps of food. One thing for sure is that China Garden gets plenty of customers.\n\nDefinitely come here for a reasonably priced buffet!",3
666,"Just ate there, right next to GameStop & Google, has 3 small booths, & ordered the pepper steak w/ onion ($10.95). Food is fast fresh & hot, but mine had too much onion & not enough steak. At the end of the meal I was just eating onions with rice, though I hear this is healthy for you. Counter lady was cordial, but didn't reply when customers told her, \""Have a nice day\"" #awkward. I know that English isn't her first language but she needs to catch on that people are wishing her well. Wasn't stuffed full either despite having eaten a large plate (I usually get this feeling eating Asian). This is basically a nice place to go for lunch that won't ruin your appetite for dinner. (Side note: Food is very clean. Brushed my teeth an hour before w/ Tom's of Maine fluoride-free peppermint & still had minty fresh breath an hour after eating)",3
667,The location is convenient but I was not a fan of the food. I had shrimp and Chinese veggies and crab Rangoon. They cut the veggies way too big and the sauce was bland. I won't go back for food but the crab Rangoon was ok. They didn't give any sauce. You have to ask for it. That sucks.,2
668,"This is an average Chinese buffet. The food was not bad, but not impressive neither, plus some cheap American food. The food was a little too greasy even by American Chinese food standard, and my stomach complained soon after I left that place. To me, that's a no-go signal.\n\nOn the other hand, they seemed to have a non-buffet counter next-door, perhaps the food would be better there.",2
669,I think 2 or 3 stars is accurate for this joint... The chicken is quality meat and its lightly saut\u00e9ed but the sauce is to blah. It's a nice place to sit down and have Chinese food if you have no other local options.  \n\nIt's my last resort for Chinese food in the area. Prices are absurd!!!,3
670,"That is a great cat they have working, but they only have 3 brands of cat food, all of them expensive.  Funny enough though not as expensive as what I was looking for.  They followed me around like I was going to stuff my pockets and that just ruined the whole mom and pop thing.",1
671,"Smiley's is wonderful... filled with things to keep our trio of cats well-fed, well-treated, and well-entertained. Certainly this is not a big box store, but, honestly, I wouldn't give my pets 99% of the food, treats, or toys that can be found in those stores, so, really, Smiley's offers me a better selection of what I actually want than any big box does. (They have a very good selection of toys for cats!)  And Smiley's takes bulk orders and has the food within a few days... saving us the trouble of schlepping out to the 'burbs.",5
672,Dr. Eric Segal was a complete ass. He was rude and obnoxious to me and my wife. We went to him for an adjustment and I left wanting to adjust this idiot's face.

673,"I had to get new tires mounted and balanced and when I went to pay, the guy at the register actually says something to the effect of \""Do you have any idea what this is supposed to cost? So, I could charge you $400 and you wouldn't know the difference?\"" Joking or not, why even go there?",2
674,Made an appointment for 3:30. They completely forgot I was coming but said they could start on my car in ten minutes and be done in an hour. Came back an hour later only to see my car in the same spot. They said it would take another two hours to start work. Completely unhelpful and unapologetic.,1
675,"I came in with a flat.  They said they couldn't repair the tire because there was cracking on the edges.  True there were cracks, but they were hairline cracks and superficial.  The diagnosis was done just from examining the exterior, which I discovered, is not sufficient to adequately judge if the cracking is bad enough--you have to actually take the tire off.\n\nCoincidentally, all four tires had the light cracking and therefore all four tires would probably need replacing.  Hmmm....  How convenient for Monro?\n\nWell, even if I give them the benefit of the doubt on the tire cracking, the pricing on the tires was ridiculous.  My tires, which were under warranty, would have cost over $500 to get replaced with crap tires (that's with the warranty credit applied).  Oh but wait, they could make me a deal with some in-house tires that were even crappier for $480.  How did I know they were crappy?  I looked them up online.  Guess what else I found.  Both sets of tires were significantly cheaper according to the Manufacturer's website even when including installation, balancing, and disposal!  \n\nSo no, no thank you.  I don't want to pay $500 to get cheap tires on my car.\n\nFortunately, my tire would hold air for a few hours so I drove to another place.  They fixed the flat no problem for $20.  Guess that cracking wasn't so bad after all.",1
676,"I came in here to have a diagnosis done on my car because the ABS light was on. \nThey removed all the tires, showed me how the sensor and ABS work, did not perform the diagnosis I originally went in for and told me that I should have the back wheel hubs replaced for a total of $1,222, this with a new set of breaks (that I knew about) and \""without\"" charging me labor. \nI may not know much about cars but I know how to search the internet and ask for advice. I found the cost of wheel hubs, they are no more than $150 each (for my car) and here they said that they cost $550 each (before labor). \n\nI also found out that the sensors get so soiled from all the dirt and salt that most of the time all the car needs is a simple wash on the undercarriage. You should always have your car washed, specially in the winter. It may save you $100's.\n\nThis place will rob you blind.\n\nNever have work done in a place like this until you do your homework!",1
677,"I knew I needed new tires and an alignment so I ordered the tires ahead so I could be in-and-out as quickly as possible to make it to class. Showed up noone had ordered the tires but they said they'd split the difference of a different brand. I was a little irritated but agreed and thought this was going to be a bad decision coming here (I'm from out of town); however, I was pleasantly surprised by the service. The mechanics noticed the car's bushings were what was causing the problems it took awhile and they offered a little extra discount which was much appreciated. Overall, it took 2 and 1/2 hours, had front aligned, bushings replaced, two new tires, and an oil change....cost $606. So, I still believe it was a little pricey but the guys were great and I can definitely note an overall difference in my car.",3
678,"I took a subaru outback here for the annual state safety and emissions inspections.  First I was charged more for this service than what was clearly posted on the service station wall.  Secondly I was failed for a lug nut that had rusted to the point that the technicians could not get it off.   I was quoted $425 for them to get it off.  I was able to accomplish this with a $6 bottle of penetrating oil and a breaker bar.  \n\nWhen I returned to have the reinspection I was charged for it (their policy posted on the service wall clearly states you get a second inspection within 30 days of initially failing free of charge).  This time they were able to get the lug nut off but supposedly could not get it back on.  This was odd as I had taken it off and put it back on numerous times to ensure it was okay to pass.  They once again quoted me $425, stating they would have to replace the wheel stud.  The new wheel stud cost me $3.50 at the local parts store and I did the job in under an hour without a single power tool.  \n\nThis shop is not following the guidelines they have clearly posted on their wall and are fabricating problems in an effort to overcharge you for simple repairs.  Avoid this shop.",1
679,"Have taken my car here a few times because there's a bus stop out front so it's convenient to drop my car off and get to work. But after what happened I will never be back. They just cost me money and lost my tires. \n\nIn March I blew a tire on a pothole (naturally) and they replaced the two front tires for me. The second tire was fine but you have to replace both, I kept it so that I would have a spare if another one blew out. Put the tires in my basement, no problem. Saved for a rainy day. \n\nThis week I ran over a nail and the tire wasn't fixable so I had to get it replaced. Luckily I've got a spare! I called Monro early this morning to see if I could get in but they said it would be tomorrow at the earliest. I needed my car so I took it to pep boys (three hour turnaround - also the last time I needed an oil change they said they were booked for three days, good lord). \n\nI drop the car off at Pep Boys and tell them the extra tire is in the back. They call me up and tell me the tire is the wrong size. What? Monro gave me the wrong tires back when they replaced them in March. So I had to buy a new tire when I had a perfectly good one that is now god knows where. The tire was the wrong size and definitely didn't come from my car as it wouldn't have fit on the rim. \n\nAfter paying for the tire at Pep Boys I went over to Monro to see what they would do about it. They informed me that because I already had the new tire put on they couldn't do anything but the next time I came in they \""would work with me\"". Why the hell would I come back when you just screwed me out of a hundred bucks and a good tire? Not worth chancing. Because you couldn't fit me in within a day I get screwed? \n\nIf you need tires go to Pep Boys on Milvalle. If you need an oil change go to Midas on Penn Circle they'll be able to get you in and not wait three days.",1
680,"Ah Monro, where \""45 minutes\"" is actually 2 hours and running at the time of this post. My car is on a lift with no tires and the employees are smoking cigarettes laughing.

I thought I would try some of the world famous cuisine so I pulled up on a Thursday evening. \""Gar\u00e7on\"" I asked, \""may I try some of your french fried potatoes?\"" I was greeted with a crackled mutter as I inched my vehicle forward. I was then treated to a relaxing 15 minute wait as nobody moved in line. Perhaps it was the clientele, a 1992 minivan filled with some savvy locals. Perhaps it was the professional waitstaff, whom I could hear laughing and socializing through my window. Whatever it was, the dining experience was filled with culinary magic and spa-like service. After some deep meditation, I realized that perhaps tonight was not the best night to sample such fine delicacies so I pulled away. I cannot wait to return to this location and try my luck at trying these elusive fries. I highly recommend this palace of excellence.",1

686,"I just want to echo what everyone else has already said about this mechanic.  My brakes gave out and I came upon the glowing reviews for Walter's, so I gave them a call.  Not only did Tim fix my car quickly and inexpensively, he actually came to pick it up himself so that I wouldn't have to spend money on a tow truck!

687,"Scenario: Get into my car at 3:30 and head to campus for a meeting. All of a sudden, the tire warning signal lights up even though I don't remember running over anything. I get out of the car to carefully inspect my tires and they feel/look completely OK. But after owning a BMW for 3 years and having constant wheel alignment/tire issues (ie. when a tire warning signal lights up, it usually means my tire's about to blow out!!), I freaked out and frantically drove my Infiniti to the first 3 auto shops on Baum Blvd. I waited at the first stop for 5-10 minutes and the guy did not get off the phone. I got back into the car and drove it over to Pep Boy's where a mechanic was outside smoking. He says I need to go through their service desk (inside their huge store) and deal with them first. I'm thinking, \""ugh. no time. I have class in 40 minutes and I'm already late to my meeting.\"" I drive past the 3rd shop and I don't even see anyone sitting at the reception desk and figure it's going to take forever to get what I'm asking for.\n\nThen, I remembered the really positive experience I had with Walter's. I decided to drive to the end of Baum Blvd. to find his place and boy, am I glad I did. As soon as I got there, the service coordinator told me to pull my car around front so that their mechanic could take a look at my tires. He stopped what he was doing to do this and told me I could just stay in my car. Then, he reassured me that my tires were OK and he proceeded to inflate them, explaining to me why the signals might have come on.\n\nFree of charge, in and out within 5 minutes, and helpful/reassuring. I love this about Walter's Automative. They're not out just to make money. They genuinely just want to help. Highly reccommend!!",5
688,"Great place. I take my car there for everything. Inexpensive, friendly, and knowledgeable. They've fixed my tire, taped a broken hose temporarily, and done other things for no charge several times. I'd definitely recommend them.",5
689,I thought I need an alignment and turns out all I needed was a tire balance. I stopped by he had me go with him and we drove around the block. I didn't cost me a thing because the tire balance was under warranty. Really  nice guy.,5
690,"I had to get a new mechanic since I recently moved here. That worried me, a lot, as I own a VW. Thankfully I found all these reviews on Yelp about Walters and decided to give it a shot. \n\nRules about Walters: Plan at least two weeks ahead for an appointment. It is worth it. \n\nFrom there you don't have to worry about anything. On my particular car I always have to fix the suspension, and I ended up needing the same repair from last year. Last year I spent $1,300 from my very reasonable and trustworthy mechanic I had been using for years at home. This year Walters quoted me just under $700. I was pretty blown away by that considering the other place I go to is just as down to earth as Walter's.\n\nWalters took the time to put my tennis racquets in my trunk and remove my aftermarket stereo so they wouldn't be seen. He explained everything to me thoroughly and was really friendly when I came to pick up my car. \n\nI know a lot about cars and mechanics since I've worked at a dealership and the honesty of Walters still amazes me. I will take my car here every time I need to get something done, even if I get a newer car with a warranty from a dealership.",5

The woman on the phone said to just stop right by during their hours. I went by this morning and their (small) lot was full so I just sat in my car while I believe who was Tim was finished chatting with another guy. I continued to sat in my car for a couple of minutes while Tim quickly inspected my headlight. Unfortunately he did not have any replacement bulbs but ordered them right on the spot while I was there and told me to come back any time in the afternoon. Fast forward a few hours later. I  just popped by and after popping my hood and going into their office to pay, my headlight was replaced! Friendly, honest, fair and quick service. No BS. Highly recommend Walter's Automotive.",5
692,"I have an older car and so sometimes things go wonky. One night I had to drop it off because it was barely running and I had no idea why. This was the first time I went to Walter's, turns out that it was only an oil changing problem. Car places usually screw me over because I know nothing about cars, but Walters did not. They are really great and fix the car for your needs. Yesterday I returned for inspection and once again he treated me fairly and only mentioned things that I already knew needed work. I would recommend this place to anyone with an older car and wants an honest car repair man. Walter's will definitely be getting my business in the future!",5
693,Honest. Reliable. Trust Worthy.\n\nTim goes above and beyond with his service. He came to my house 3x one day to check everything he could before I ended up towing it to the garage. I will definitely go back!,5

695,"The Kelly Strayhorn is a good idea which is poorly executed.  The facility has problems:  the stairs on the house are too narrow causing trips, the bathrooms don't really have the capacity for over 300 patrons, etc.\n\nBeyond the facility you get to the actual 'poorly executed' idea.  The staff is extremely un-knowledgeable about the subjects they are producing.  For instance none of the programmers on staff have any training in performing arts, they are all visual arts people playing at another field.  As a result they don't even know what they are really producing and any experienced person in the field can tell.  \n\nThe sad part about this is they REALLY try.  They throw staff and new ideas at every opportunity.  Don't expect great performances here, expect a talked up mediocre performance.  \n\nAudience follows content and they don't have content or the staff that is knowledgeable enough to know better.

I have been to several fundraisers hosted by the Kelly Strayhorn, and they have always been first rate.  Also, I recently attended the Kelly Strayhorn's own fundraiser, Full Bloom, which was lots of fun.

698,"This place has probably some of the best pastries I've ever encountered.  The treats are consistently great to amazing to even mouth watering.  The bakery is this quaint little place that is really cute with nice baking decorations and everything.  The staff is really friendly and always helpful with making the hard selection.  The cupcakes are these cream-stuffed pieces of heaven, and their signature sandwiches are out of this world.  Everything else leaves nothing to be desired, and keeps me coming back as frequently as I can find someone to accompany me.",5
699,"I arrived on a Thursday afternoon at 5pm when there was absolutely no other soul in the bakery (except for the staff). My pumpkin pastry with carmel topping was alright.

We purchased a crispy elephant ear-like dessert sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar. It was glorious. I bought a piece of apple-walnut-cinnamon sugar cake with cream cheese frosting. It was delicious an moist. We also purchased freshly baked chocolate chip cookies. They were absolutely rich and scrumptious. The woman who was there an greeted us seemed like she might be the owner. She was sweet and very helpful. Great disposition. This is probably my favorite small bakery in Pittsburgh. Delightful.",5
701,"Food glorious foooood, hot sausage and MUStard...\n\nActually they don't sell hot sausage and mustard but, you know. \n\nThey do have amazing ham and cheese sandwiches, that are kinda pricy, but oh so good. And if you want them, you better get there early on the weekend! They're small, so get 2 for yourself at least :)\n\nWe've also tried the Nutella tart, which i've had twice now because it's SO DELICIOUS. The fruit tart is not bad, cinnamon buns are great, jewish pizza is ok (not what I was expecting - it's kinda like a fruitcake - like the dreaded holiday kind - but denser and drier), strata (eggy bread dish) which was pretty good, key lime cake - so so good, and quiche (good). \n\nSeating is hit or miss, since there's only a few tables (3 of them seat 4 people, 1 seats 2 people). On a quieter morning you should be able to find a seat. They serve coffee as well (nothing to write home about), $2 a cup, but if you like coffee with your dessert like me, it's nice to have.",5
702,"Came across this place after checking out a Thai restaurant across the street. The name intrigued my family and I, and it looked like adorable from the outside. \n\nI fell in love instantly. And came back several times after first discovering this hidden gem. You walk in and the wonderful smells just overwhelm you in just an amazing way. The ambiance is that of an old style kitchen- personally, it reminds me of one of my aunts kitchens, which gives it that homey feel that is so comforting. They have seating- which I never saw in any bakeries prior to this one. They also serve coffee and encourage you to take a seat and enjoy your sweet treat. \n\nThey offer such a unique array of sweets. Definitely not your typical bakery. Pies, tortes, mooses and cookies.. And when they do have cinnamon rolls, grab them! They are a hot commodity! My personal favorite is their key lime pie. Oh my goodness. It's amazing. They have had it every time that I came, thank goodness. Their key lime cake is phenomenal as well. Their fruit tarts are incredible, the chocolate moose is amazing- they have a lot of items with fresh fruit which I love! \n\nMy only critiques- the hours: they are closed on Mondays and Sundays :/, not ideal for someone whose only day off is typically Sunday. And also, they write all the items thy have in the case on a small chalkboard posted on the wall to the right of the case. Every time I go, I find myself asking the employees what everything is, which I find to be a little annoying. Regardless- it's worth it. It's such a hidden gem and going there and experiencing their sweets is a real treat.",5
703,"I've had a wide range of experiences here.  Let's just say, when I first moved here, one of the employees gave me poor advice and ended up totally screwing up my title.  It's been a tremendous ordeal to get it fixed.  Another employee tried to help me fix it and screwed that up too.  Now I'm working with a third person who seems very competent and committed to helping me solve this problem, but even she is like \""I can't believe those other people told you to do that....they made this so much harder than it needed to be.\""  My thoughts exactly.\n\nWork with Barb, if you can.  She knows her stuff.  I don't quite trust anybody else to help me properly.  Also they're only open from 830-4 (or is it 430?) so you pretty much have to go before work, or on Saturday.  And I will be going in tomorrow at 830 until my car title saga finally comes to its conclusion....\n\nAlso, parking is free in their lot.  And if you are a AAA member, I think your fees are lower, or something like that.  I do have AAA, so it makes sense for me to come here - I can't say what the experience is like for non members.",2
704,"I have to say that I have had quick and efficient stops in here for all of my car needs. Firstly, walking into this building is quite a spectacle, from the beautiful exterior and interior. I have to be honest, my first trip in here I felt like taking my escalator down into the pit that is AAA was equivalent to taking a trip into the fifth ring of hell. I hate anything dealing with the DMV, registration, license, tags, blah blah blah. However, both of the times I stopped in here it was not crowded at all, and the women that helped me were very nice and thoughtful. The stations you must go through are quick and effective. Both times I had business here, I was in and out in less than a half hour- which was far better than the marathon nightmare I was expecting.",4
705,"I moved to Pgh from San Francisco in 2010, and every single dealing I've had with AAA since I moved here has been great -- straightforward, super helpful people, and mostly quite brief wait times. \n\nThe agent that I have worked with from the start, whose name I think is Heather (long dark hair, second desk from the left), has always been willing to spend as much time with me as I needed to understand what I was buying and/or the process that I needed to go through.\n\nAlso, my car was totaled a couple of years ago (some jagoff who was texting rear-ended me, ahem, please don't do this), and they were phenomenal. I had a check for the full amount in less than a week.\n\nI see a lot of negative reviews here for services that are title related. I don't know if those people are even AAA employees, they might be DOT for all we know. I've had three title transactions, including one for a car that was from out of state, and they all went smoothly. \n\nI've been with AAA for more than 40 years, and when I lived in California I was seriously considering switching.

708,"As a Brooklyn based live indie-electronic/hiphop performer that travels, Shadow Lounge is by far one of my all time favorites.  As a Pittsburgh native remembering it's first opening when it was just bboys, graff heads, MC's and DJ's doing their local thing, it's amazing to see this place has become so professional, original, and really stands-out and is positively active for the community and continuing growth of Pittsburgh.  The service is delightful on both sides (AVA/Shadow Lounge), the prices are just right, the sound system is a complete BANGER with crisp and clean sound.   The crowd is mad cool and always responsive to good music.  Shadow Lounge really holds it down for Pittsburgh's scenes no matter the genre.

Every night was different: African night, Latin Dance, Brass Band (that was amazing). The Ownership is way friendly & open to chatting which I love. The bartenders are open, friendly & genuine...anyone who remembers my name & my drink is a winner in my book! It shows they are listening when they actually ask you a question! The ownership was willing to allow us to order & set on fire a Flaming Dr. Pepper.....had to bring a little Southern treasure North! ;)\n\nI love the diverse, yet open and friendly crowd each night.

Geez... way to be behind the times Rachel!\n\nI've been interested in a bunch of the nights they've hosted before, but have never made way way over. I went to celebrate one Miss Aja J's birthday for Hip Hop vs House night. I'm a big hip hop fan, but not much into house. They had two dueling DJ's and an MC hosting the event. I actually liked the mash up of the two genre's. It was definitely better than just house.\n\nThey have about 5 beers on tap, which I think is impressive for a \""club.\"" Especially different since it was much more than Miller Light. They actually had a Pumpkin brew on tap, which forgive me for not remember, I was into! At $5.50 it wasn't breaking the bank, but it wasn't a $3 Miller Light fo sho! \n\nWe came a little early, but it seemed like the night really started to pick up around 11pm. Yep, I'm old, I left at 11pm. Lame, I know! \n\nI hope they find a new home, because I think it's a place we don't have anywhere else and I'm happy to have been finally!",4

717,"I love hardware stores.  LOVE.  But this Home Depot has disappointed me.  The location is great, but the floor staff is unhelpful.\n\nTonight was a great example of I don't like the floor staff.  My vacuum stopped picking up anything but the largest pieces of dust.  After opening her up, I quickly realized I needed a new belt.  It was pouring down rain, but I put on my rainboots, grabbed an umbrella, and hoofed it over to ye ole Home Depot.  I had to stand over the shoulders of five--yep, I counted five--employees in appliances for a full minute before one of them would help me.\n\nAfter someone directed me to the vacuum parts, I had two male employees stop by to see if I needed help as I searched for the correct belt.  I had the vacuum's name and number written down, as well as the belt style, and had the actual busted belt with me.  Yet, each of these men acted like I was some stupid girl.  \""Did you unplug the vacuum before you removed the old belt?\"" one asked me.  Duh.  I'm not an idiot.  The other later asked, \""Do you always wear bright yellow rainboots when you're doing repairs?\"" and snickered.  Look, all I said to both gentlemen was \""I'm just looking for the correct style number.  But thanks.\""\n\nI received similar treatment I stopped by to buy a new set of bits for my drill.  \""You know drills come in more than one kind, right?\"" I was asked.  And when I needed a new bag of dirt of my cacti, I was question about why I wanted succulent dirt over potting soil.  Every time a male employee here approaches me, I'm questioned or given unsolicited advice in a snotty way.\n\nThis girl may wear bright yellow rainboots, but I am also the Norm Abram of my family.  AKA I'm pretty handy.  Oh, and the vacuum works perfectly now.\n\nShout out goes to the check out attendants, who were SUPER polite.  Nice work, ladies.",3
718,"This was my first time to this Home Depot.  Very impressed with the customer service here.  We were redoing a bathroom and went in for more tiles.  They were out of them.  However, a staff member helped us use other tile and decorative pieces to compliment the tile we already had, instead of schlepping all the way to Monroeville to pick up the tile up were originally looking for.  We were very happy with the result!",3

I mean I know how to swing a hammer and push a button to start a machine, but all the other stuff...meh.\n\nI've only really gone in here to pick up paint, so I'll focus on that.  I feel bad for the lady that works the paint counter.  Each time I'm in there she always seems to be by herself with a line of customers all wanting there base paint tinted.  I don't believe there was ever a time I could just walk up to the counter and have my paint mixed for me.  Give that woman a hand.",2
720,"This is a pretty good HD. It is somewhat smaller than the ones in Ross Park and Monroeville, but they seem to stock most of the same items. Occasionally I do need to go to Monroeville to find specific items, however. With a 1920s house, I spend quite a bit of time here for getting materials for repairs.\n\nCustomer service is about average. Some people are very helpful, others not so much. In general, they seem to be better than the Lowes at the Waterfront. At least HD people know where items are in the store. I can't tell you how many times I've received completely different (and wrong) answers to finding stuff at Lowes.\n\nI would prefer a small hardware store (such as an Ace) closer to me for things like nuts, bolts, and screws. Ace seems to have a better selection than HD does for hard-to-find items. HD has most of the basics covered, however, and probably a little cheaper.\n\nI generally avoid their paint section except for equipment. I prefer the service at a Sherwin-Williams or Masterwork Paint store. \n\nWe've had decent luck with their garden department. We've had to return a few plants that died the day after we planted them, but they have never given us any problems with returns. \n\nIt's a big-box home improvement store, for better or worse. It's a convenient location with a decent selection. 'Nuff said.",3
721,"I would rather drive out of my way to another Home Depot than give this location my business. \n\nEmployees are unhelpful and the most of them are too busy talking to each other and complaining about their jobs to notice you're standing there in front of them. Strike that... I'm certain they notice, they just don't care.\n\nI'm a pretty understanding person, but when this sort of thing happens more than once on the same visit, it's time to go. There are plenty of HD's around, seek them out and skip this one (especially if you're going to have questions)!",1
722,"Most of the home depots i've seen are the same and that includes this one. aisles full of hardware supplies, tools, bathroom accessories and even a small nursery for gardening. \n\nMy favorite section is the tool section seeing that I'm a DIY-er. (Do it yourself) if you didn't already know that. I enjoy building, maintaining and fixing things in my own home as opposed to hiring a contractor and paying a boat load. I'm best known at the Home Depot in monroeville. I come in there so often a lot of the employees know me just by my dog. Yes my dog, who i have brought into this store several times. They allow pets i'm assuming because i've never been asked to leave and I've seen others with their pets as well. \n\nThat's the best part about the store is the animal policy and the fact that they offer enough supplies for you to practically build a house. Some things are cost efficient while others are kinda breaking the bank. There not as modern as lowes but they have alot of the same products. I recently built my own in home bar. t's 8 by 2, a long bar that i (a girl) built by hand. I'm very proud of the work i did. I installed lights and polished it and it has a resin top with ceramic tiles beneath it. It's a real beauty and i got all the supplies at home depot. Cost me about $600 to make but i put it together in 2 months so that's a plus. \n\nBut yea if your in need of some nice plants to go in the kitchen or patio OR you just want to spruce up a few things around the house, then this Mega home repair store is where you ought to be.

When I asked if I could order it and have it delivered to the store (to save the shipping costs) I was told that the items I wanted were not \""qualified\"" for delivery to the store.  \""When will the items be restocked?\""  \""Don't know.\""  \""Would it be possible to get the items delivered from another store in the region?\""  \""No, that 'messes with' our inventory controls.\""  Oh, but I was told I could haul my sorry butt out to Monroeville where the stock of everything I wanted was plentiful.  Really? \n\nThe staff I dealt with could not have cared less about helping me.  Maybe because it was a holiday (New Year's Eve).  Dunno.  Don't care.  Customer service should not ebb and flow based on the day/date.  \n\nThe East Liberty HD used to have shelves full of product and plenty of choices.  And the staff was helpful and eager to engage with customers.  No longer.  It appears that the company has given up on the location and is letting it die a slow and painful (for its customers) death.  \n\nVERY disappointing to me.",1

Plus, on gallery crawl nights (First Friday of every month!) they have snacks galore.",4
728,"A few hours before the event, we happened across the ad in the City Paper and decided to give it a shot.  We were excited to get there as the event said we would be making something, there would be food and music, demonstrations, live music, and a gallery.  Booking our reservations for 6pm was quick and easy over the phone; $60 for a couple.  Upon arrival, we checked in and were asked if we wanted to purchase another item to make; we were confused because we assumed that we would each get to make something.  In the end, we chose not to spend the extra $15 to make another garden float/ornament; aka a hollow glass ball.  \n\nWhen our 'instructor' met with us, he was very friendly but it was loud and he was very hard to hear.  He ran through everything at lightning speed and in the end, all we got to do was blow air in a tube for 10 seconds.  Had the first attempt not popped, I wouldn't even have been able to do anything!  From a teacher's standpoint, there were many other steps in the process that we should have been able to participate in; I would've been happy to sign a waiver if that is part of the issue.  Within 15 minutes, our ball was done and we were shuffled out so another couple could have their turn.\n\nWe then worked our way downstairs to the food and drink and there was an assortment of beer, wine, sparkling juices, veggies, fruit, cheese, and some deli meats.  The assortment was nice, as we were able to snack on the healthy side, but the beer was still warm.\n\nThe gallery was nice to walk through with work on display from so many talented people, the live music added to the ambiance, and the demonstrations were interesting to watch.\n\nIn the end, it was nice experience, but were severely let down by the make-it/take-it section of the evening (the part we were most excited for!).  It really started to bug us, when later in the evening, we saw an older couple getting to do more of the steps in the process (mind you, we aren't young kids, but young professionals).  We would have liked to have a small 'info talk' about the steps that will take place, why they are that way, the tools used, maybe some quick science behind it, then get to work on the item.",2
729,"I went to a yelp event here, where we were able to make a fused glass piece and also watch some demonstrations and go to the gallery. Everything in the gallery was amazing. The demonstrations were neat, and the fused glass was something I would go back to do again.\n\nI really didn't know that the glass center was open most of the time, and if you go there on any random day, you can watch whatever is going on. I think that is pretty cool! They also have classes where you can blow glass or make beads or whatever you want... I can't wait to pick up my piece and come back for another class!",5
730,Got my hair done in an updo (for only $25!!!!)  yesterday for my wedding.  they did amazing!  they listened to what i wanted and although it took quite a while (i have really long hair) she spent the time to do it right and exactly how i wanted it.  great service!!

733,"Provolone sticks arrived undercooked, cheese was fully solid, they tasted okay. The pizza also arrived undercooked, the dough itself was partially uncooked in the middle. I had to put it back into my own oven to finish it off, and then it was greasy and just okay.",1
734,"Worst pizza I've had in Pittsburgh. I ordered from here last weekend. The pizza (pepperoni) had no flavor and the crust was way too chewy. The Buffalo wings were cooked well, and were tender and juicy, but they had almost no sauce on them whatsoever; luckily I had some wing sauce in my fridge in order to save them. \n\nMaybe it was one bad night, and I can give them another chance later, but based on my one experience, I can't recommend this place to anyone.",2
735,I order from these guys on campusfood.com\nThey are pretty good .. i get my order on time and their quality has been pretty consistent\nI mostly get things like hoagies and pizzas.. they are pretty decent\nThis place is pretty convenient for me when I am working on campus late at night when most other places have shut down.,4

737,"Ahh, the only place near the train station that is open past 9 PM, isn't overpriced and/or full of people who are way too jolly for such an early hour. I got a slice of cheese pizza and onion rings. The pizza was decent. There was nothing flavorful about the sauce and the grease would not stop oozing out of the cheese. I felt sick before I got halfway through it. That reminds me - the slices are HUGE, and are $2. The onion rings were extremely basic - I gave most of them to a couple of drunken girls who debated about what to eat for half an hour.\nOne irritating thing I overheard: as a girl was trying to place an order, the cashier kept interrupting her to say things like \""we don't have those anymore\"" or \""no, we can't cook wings dry.\"" Sounds like the menu and staff needs to be updated.",2
738,"I had some pizza from Pizza Parma today during a lunch meeting at work.  A colleague brought it in, so I didn't pay for it and can't comment on the price.  I had a few slices of the pepperoni pizza and found them to be resoundingly average.  Nothing special, nothing especially good or bad.  Crust, sauce, cheese, pepperoni, fin.  It was a little greasy, and quite cheesy as well.  I was starving so I really enjoyed it, but I think overall the pizza is pretty generic.  Still, for a late night slice or if you live nearby and just need to pick up a quick pizza for dinner, I'd say go for it.  Just don't have very high expectations.",3
739,"Pizza Parma has many of the characteristics I like in a pizza joint. \n1) They deliver when they say they will, \n2) Diverse menu and toppings, \n3) Coupons, \n4) Online ordering, and \n5) Take credit cards. \n\nI think Pizza Parma shines with their specialty pizzas. Artichoke, Buffalo Chicken, Spinach & Feta, and Greek pies are all delicious. I've also had some of their pasta dishes, and I can't complain. It's nice to have something other than pizza delivered; the portions are huge, and they come with bread and a salad. Pizza Parma fails on wings, though. The texture is unappealing (aka, flappy chicken skin-- yuk!), and the sauces lack depth. Desserts are also not worth the buy.",3
740,I like the pizza and the selection of toppings.  They are reliable.  Great option for take out food.,3
741,This was one of first pizza places that I've tried inPittsburgh. It was about 5 years ago. I don't have a clear memory of that time but I have Parma pizza phobia ever since... So go figure...,2
742,"I've should have known better than to order a salad from a pizza joint.  I also should have known that I shouldn't have cheated on my diet.\n\nI figured I'd choose today to be my cheat day and order with everyone else at work for take out.  I opted for the Popcorn Chicken Salad.  Sounds tasty, looked tasty, and yes it even tasted tasty.  Iceberg lettuce, grape tomatoes, cucumbers, red onions, french fries, popcorn chicken, and three types of cheese.  \n\nI have to say that even though I was saying yes, my body was saying, 'OH hell no!'\n\nI'm regretting this decision now as I am sitting here in discomfort.  Not sure what on the salad made me feel this way.  But I'm not liking the effect I'm getting right now.  Could just be karma turning around and kicking me in the ass for eating what looked healthy but was really nothing more than the equivalent of a fried chicken sandwich combo meal from a fast food joint.\n\nI'll think twice before the next time rolls around to order from here.",2
743,"Three stars is super accurate for this place. We decided to do take out from here after walking by it a hundred times after the gym and hearing radio commercials about it from that god forsaken BUBBA SHOW (does that plug raise anyone else's blood pressure??) Our order was ready in 15 minutes (speedy!) and we got a large 1 topping pizza for ~$8 and a side of fries. All together like $13 for three people, which is pretty good. As for the pizza, the crust was crispy and not too thick or thin, and the sauce was sweet, not seasoned. I prefer a more herby sauce myself, so I wasn't wowed by it. The fries were a bit soggy, but tasty. Overall, if I were in a pinch I'd order from here no problem but it's not a place I'd set out to order from because I love it.",3
744,"Pizza Parma delivers through GrubHub, which is the primary reason I ordered sandwiches from them. BBQ chicken was ok. The bread is a little more on the burnt than toasted side, leading it to be dry. The value is good. The 20\"" sandwich was about $11.",3
745,"Great friendly service and my order was done fast, which was amazing since I was a walk-in. Lots of toppings piled high but I wish there was more cheese. They did have small bottles of vanilla Coke, which is a rare find these days.",3
746,"When my boyfriend and I were down with the flu, we ordered some food here through Eat24. I got a chicken noodle soup and he got the seafood calzone. When I unpacked the food and tried a sip of my soup, I found that it was cold and had bubbles in it, as if there was soap in it. I couldn't really taste anything, but my boyfriend said it smelled like dishwater. To say the least, I was disappointed in my soup. When my boyfriend cut into his calzone, he said the cheese was barely melted. We thought it was undercooked and touched the outside. It was cold, as if it was sitting out in the open for a long time. He tried to take a bite, but the dough was barely even cooked and the contents of the seafood calzone was cold and tasted sour.\nThis was our first time ordering from here and it was such a sad experience to have, since our food was inedible. I heard this place was good and had great calzones and tasty soup, but what we received was the complete opposite from the praise I've heard about this place.",1
747,"Some friends and I ordered a couple of pizzas for delivery from here tonight.  We'd bought a few growlers of hard cider from a local establishment, and we were looking for some fuel to help us soak up the booze.  My friend suggested getting pizza from here, and I didn't object, since I'd never had pizza from here before, and I'd heard the pizza from here was consistently decent.\n\nThe pizza showed up about 45 min. after we ordered it, right about at the time estimated, so no complaints there.  As for the pizza itself, it was solidly A-OK--nothing special, but nothing horrible, either.  It was a bit on the greasy side, and I could tell from pulling the first piece away from the pie that the crust wasn't crispy.  Biting into my first slice of pepperoni pizza confirmed my suspicions about the floppiness of the crust.  As for the flavor, it was your standard pizza flavor--again, nothing special, but nothing horrible, either.  It was more greasy than I'd like, but not to the point where I felt it necessary to dab off the grease with a napkin (though I was tempted to do so).\n\nAs the bottom line, the pizza was fine for our purposes (to soak up alcohol). It was better than Vocelli's, and about on par with Papa John's.  I wouldn't go out of my way to order from here again, but I wouldn't object to it, either.",3
748,"This place is bright and clean and I've seen staff taking care of machines every time I've been there (different times/different days) so I imagine it's well maintained in general.  Love that there are bus stops directly in front of and across the street AND that this is a 24-hour place.  I usually spend $7.50 every 2 weeks* though I could probably get away with using the single load machines and a few minutes less in the dryer.  I especially appreciate the good spin cycle from these washers as that means less time it has to be in the dryer!\n\nAround here, you can walk around the 'hood while waiting for your cycle to finish (pizza place, convenience store, coffee/ice cream shops next door, Border's bookstore down the block, more shops on Ellsworth nearby)\n\n*I'm a female doing laundry for 1 so it takes a while to have enough for separate whites/color load.  I've also been to The Laundry Factory a few blocks away and I prefer Econowash over The Laundry Factory.",3
749,"I was all set to want to give this place 3 stars simply because another laundry place put me in a bind and this place was open 24 hrs.  I thought the late hours alone should give it a star. Then I had this experience\n\n--Poor ventilation I could barely breath its cramped and small with dryers and washers lining two narrow corridors. \n\n---- misleading advertising it boasts \""high capacity\"" washers an says its air conditioned, well the air conditioners and vents in the ceiling both were dripping in black dust and look like they were installed in 1963. which might have been why I felt an instant asthma attack coming on. \n\nThen the high capacity washers were all of 2.... not great enough to meet demand as it turns out one girl took up both of them while I was waiting. Then another woman waited for hers to wash and took up two again this was at 1030-11:00  pm at night so I can only Imagine what its like to try and get one at other hours. \n\nThen there was this guy I guess he was an attendant or the owner, he was wiping down the machines and dryers. I was moving my clothes out of the dryer and I had put my bras hangers and a few shirts on top of my washer. I was literally loading right in the same area and was heading back to grab my things when he touched them!!\n\nUgh laundry violation ya don't touch someone's wet clothes it feels like that time in college when someone would mess with you and dump your clothes behind the washers if you didn't move them out quickly enough. Sooo that pissed me off...... but I have to get the job done so I load up my clothes. \n\nI come back in to check on drying clothes.... and what do I find but my dryer mysteriously switched from high heat to low heat. Now I am forced to put in another quarter to finish my load. All in all I spent 8$ at the econowash for 2 large loads I wasn't able to do my third load in the washers he had for under that. I can do that much at Laundry Factory around the corner though. So I will be going there. I don't need a creepy dude changing my dryer settings and touching my stuff.",1
750,"So, unfortunately I've had to outsource my laundry-doing in the last couple of weeks because the dryer in my building has broken down and my not-so-prudent landlord hasn't been helpful at all in repairs (ugh!!). Twice in the last two weeks, I've washed loads of laundry late at night and discovered my dryer hasn't worked. It's really great to know that this place is right down the street and is open 24/7, especially when the Laundry Factory down the street closes at about 9pm (which in general I much prefer to this place). But for convenience-sake, I appreciate this place. On the cons list, it's not incredibly clean and I have used dryers that simply don't work here.",3
751,"I think the only thing I appreciate about Whole Foods is entering the store and seeing their fresh cut flowers.  Let's see why.....\n\nI attempt to drive to Whole Foods only to be caught in a line of 5-6 cars attempting to get into the parking lot.  (I guess I'm not cool enough to ride Pat Transit from the South Pittsburgh home).  When I find a place to park, after the Lexus SUV (HA!) pulls out, I find that they didn't put their cart back.  \n\nSo I enter the store and admire how their design is very appealing to the eyes (how DO organic oranges get so ROUND and so ORANGE) and everything is stacked so neatly.  Then I read that a pound of these oranges are $1.99...  Then I go to the meat section, which I don't even eat, to find that the prices are double those of Trader Joe's or even Market District (see future review).  So I walk around and debate to see if I should buy Clif Bars and Naked Juice (which happens to be on sale) because LORD KNOWS I don't need bulk-blanched-almonds.  But then I decide to buy \""fresh\"" CHUNKY peanut butter because it would be fun to try.  (When I get home later, however, I bought Valencia peanut butter, whatever the hell that is, and cannot stomach it.  Gimmie my Jif.)  So while I am waiting in line, I see the  bikes (those rebellious urbanites moved from Quiet Storm) and wonder if my money is better spent elsewhere.  \n\nRegardless, I whole-heartedly (no pun intended) support organic and sustainable farming, but I'd rather go to the farmer's market or drive a bit further out of the city to go somewhere real to buy my \""whole food\"".  And at least I put my cart back.",2
752,"I don't know, maybe I'm not clear on the concept of Whole Foods.  Don't get me wrong, there's nothing really wrong with shopping at Whole Foods.  Whole Foods does have wonderful merchandise, but...\n\nI have found that I can buy a lot of the same organic things and environmentally safe cleaners at Giant Eagle for less.\n\nThier wine and beer selection, supposedly quite remarkable in other states, well remember, this is Pennsylvania.  You can't buy those things at the grocery store.  \n\nI can get just as good quality meat and produce in the Strip District.  Sometimes, even better quality.\n\nI guess the benefit of Whole Foods  is that you can find a lot under one roof and don't have to spend a lot of time and gas going to different stores.  I'm not slamming Whole Foods at all, but I actually like Trader Joe's better.",2
753,"I loved Whole Foods in Ohio.  It was calm and quiet and had lots of pretty organic produce.\n\nHere?  Well, first of all, the parking lot is a death-trap full of upscale SUVs who have no idea how to drive courteously.  (A few pointers: use your turn signals, wait your turn, drive slowly in a parking lot, and put your cart back!)  My blood pressure skyrockets the second I even try to pull in here.\n\nSecondly, the whole store seems weirdly dark.  I don't know if it's the high, exposed-ductwork ceiling or what, but it's depressing.\n\nThirdly, they offer plenty of bulk beans and nuts, but few varieties of rice.  \n\nThere are a few good points, though.  The sushi (at least the vegetarian varieties) are good, and the desserts are delicious and beautiful.  The salad bar and prepared foods always look good, and the staff is friendly.  But I still try to avoid Whole Foods as much as possible simply because of the insane parking lot.",2
754,"Everybody, chill out.  This is a trendy place to shop, yes, but it also has better prices on some things than Giant Eagle or Trader Joe's (Gasp!).  I split my time between Here, Giant Eagle and Trader Joe's pretty evenly, depending on what specialty items I might need.\n\nOh yeah, don't drive here.  Walk, ride your bike or take the bus.  If you're really smart, you'll avoid the headache and park on one of the many adjacent side streets.",3
755,"AH!  I am never shopping anywhere else for groceries ever again (except if I want like ketchup and bologna and stuff-- then I'll have to go to giant eagle.)

756,Whole paycheck is a fitting name.\n\nThis Whole Foods is decent for regular items but their prepared food prices have gotten really high as of late.  \n\nI used to shop here for almost everything but their common products can now be had at almost any other grocery store for less.\n\nWhole Foods had it's day as a unique place to shop with hard to find organic produce and products. \n\nNow it's just more expensive.,2

758,"Hello!\n\nI work pretty close to Whole Foods so I frequent it about 3-4 times a week for lunch. If you're there M-F between 12-1, you can find me in the salad/bread area (on the north end). \n\nCompared to other Whole Foods I've been to, I would actually rate it a 3 but considering I do not know of any other Whole Foods around, I thought it's my duty to those that do not know about Whole Foods a chance to give it a try. If the zucchinis at Market District looked a little weak, give Whole Foods a try. Plus their pre-made food is actually yummy.\n\nI'm able to keep my lunch on a budget by only buying lettuce and chicken from the salad bar (typically under 1/2 pound). I stash dressing, cranberries, and cheese in my office. I've tried buying the bag of pre-washed lettuce but I never finish them and I hate seeing them go bad. $3 lunches isn't bad at all.\n\nOther notes: The tofu chicken is really good (part of the salad bar)! It's not always available though. Also, none of their bread varieties impress me. I like their sushi rolls. If I could afford $8/day lunches, I'd probably have it everyday. I'd give their cashiers 5 stars. =)",4
759,"3.5 stars, actually. Would be 4 but I had to knock off half a star because of the parking situation. The lot sucks, I used to work at Whole Foods and I can not recall how many times I almost got hit by a car when retrieving carts. I am one of the lucky ones, I know of a few people who weren't so lucky. \n\nI'm a huge fan of the salad and hot bar - not a fan of the price though. To be fair, I can only blame myself for ending up with an $11 salad (but everything is so good and actually fresh I can't stop myself from piling it on). The prepared sandwich's are pretty awesome too and if you go after 9p, they are buy 1 get 1. \n\nI now work with a lot of children on special diets and I have no problem finding lots of GFCF treats for them here. \n\nGroceries range from expensive to moderate depending on the brand. The WFM's 365 line is an excellent bargain. \n\nThe bakery is full of tasty treats. You've gotta try the pumpkin pumpkin pie, though I believe it is only available around the holidays. \n\nThe whole store gets crazy busy on and around holidays.",3
760,"Worst parking lot in Pittsburgh. Bring popcorn to watch middle-aged, self-important mouth breathers gun their BMWs at one another to illegally park in the handicapped spots .If one didn't know better, one could mistake the parking lot drama for a permanent, outdoor performance art installation (allbeit an extraordinarily douchey one). Snotty clientele, over priced prepared items, no longer have a monopoly on ANY product in Pittsburgh. That being said, they do have a great selection of produce, probably the best in Pittsburgh, but you'll pay dearly for it. 1 very large, organic, honeycrisp apple you ask? Try $5, for real. If you want to sum up Whole Foods, just remember it's a place where you can literally spend $5 on an apple. Also, the CEO John Mackey voted for MItt Romney (http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/20/magazine/john-mackey-the-kale-king.html?_r=0), so if you think you're shopping in a mecca of neo-progressive, pre-utopian bliss, think again.

If that's the case, you might want to rein in your spending a little. \n\nI actually took a notebook to Trader Joe's, Giant Eagle, and Whole Foods when I first moved to Pittsburgh to compare prices. Giant Eagle (Greenfield location) was the most expensive by an overwhelming margin! Trader Joe's was the best value overall, but Whole Foods was very close, and sometimes a little better quality might be worth it. Their 365 brand is especially reasonable for your regular grocery staples.\n\nAs for the occasional splurge, this is a good place to try something different. I admit it's hard not to get something extra, but I know I can only blame that final total on myself!",4
769,"I am a big fan of the Whole Foods company in general.  The store back home (Omaha) had a wine bar, espresso bar, gelato, sushi and udon stand, a GIANT cheese counter where you could sample...I could go on.\n\nThe Pittsburgh Whole Foods is small, and almost as overcrowded as its parking lot.  Two-thirds of the time they are out of what I came for.  I'm sorry, but if I'm paying THAT much for groceries, I want a stellar shopping experience.  This WF is mediocre at best.",2
770,"Parking is tough, the food selection is great, and if you call ahead they will set aside awesome moving boxes for you.",4
771,"I have tried Whole Foods recently even after hearing about the attitude of the butthole, hipster employees and presumptuous, anti-bourgeois customers that will literally push you aside a turn their noses up at you a million times. The rumors were true!!! \n\nEven though I was only there one time, first impressions are a bitch! The selection is great! I can't afford any of it, but it's great! I have never seen such expensive rice! Here is the bro-down...\n\nThe food: Plentiful and too expensive to even think of buying. The freshest fish that isn't in the Strip...but you need to take a second mortgage to buy fish for a family. I bought sushi rice, a piece of fish and a salad, my bill: $25! The salad with lettuce, carrots, chick peas, onions and about 5 pieces of chicken was $11+\n\nThe employees: Hipsters with thick-rimmed glasses, tattoos and facial piercings that slack like I have never seen \""workers\"" slack before. In fact there was a sign above some fresh fish stating \""We will prepare you fish any way you want, just ask\"" HA...HA! When I asked to have a tiny fish to be filleted (something that would take me about 10 seconds at home) I was scoffed at by the so called fish monger who was obviously not a trained fish monger, but got his job because of his Progressive music of the soviet era bachelors degree . It took him the better part of 20 minutes to fillet a f-ing fish! All I got was a chopped up piece of crap that was useless. And scoffing is what these people are good at. Pushing your cart down the aisles is like running a scoffing gauntlet. Staff huff and puff when you get in their way?! The cashiers just stand and talk to each other or run to get organic iced tea to drink WHILE they ring you up...they don't even do that at Giant Eagle!\n\nThe other customers: This one is a peach! If you're not pulling in a good $60K a year you are dirt to these people. I was at the salad bar (it is a good salad bar, but expensive) an older woman in a mink coat bumped, no, pushed into me then stared at me and turned her nose up at me, can you believe it? She actually turned her nose up at me! Others in the aisles will grunt like cantankerous old people if they can't get through. They push ahead in line, give you dirty looks, and act like it's a class struggle...it kind of is!\n\nSo unless you have a lot (i mean A LOT) of disposable income, have never needed to use coupons, drive a $50K car (parking is terrible there), are the president of the United States, CEO of Microsoft, a widow whose wardrobe is more extensive than the explanation of the formula explaining an event horizon or a hipster who looks poor, but lives off daddy and mommy (though they'll never admit it) you shouldn't and really won't be able to afford this place...but why would you want to?\n\nI'll stick with Trader Joe's for my alternative market, thank you! I prefer employees with edges that are a little rough to ones with pants so tight, I can see their junk.",1
772,"I always thought 1-star reviews on Yelp were written by bitter, resentful people who had nothing better to do than just complain. But now I feel their pain. It really doesn't hit you, until it... hits you.\n\nYou pay a premium at WF, you expect a premium, right? Well parking is part of the shopping experience. It's why they have parking lots in the first place. But never mind the atrocious parking lot and not being able to easily maneuver in it.\n\nI'm talking about being TOWED. Towed, not for leaving the parking lot, but for legitimately shopping at WF. Yes, this could happen to you too.\n\nUpon contacting the towing company, they demanded $135 (cash only) to return my vehicle. Upon contacting WF (since I was a legitimate shopper there and didn't leave the lot) they just shrugged their shoulders and just told me the name of the company that managed the lot.\n\nAnd that's it?! $135 is no chump change, but it seems like WF wants me to carry an extra $135 every time I frequent them (thankfully, never, since I don't live in Pittsburgh). This whole parking/towing situation is extremely shady, but the only company I'm going to point my finger at is Whole Foods for doing business with such a shady complex and passing the burden on to its customers.\n\nTip: Bring an extra $135 to pay for parking, or just go to Trader Joe's/Giant Eagle for a better parking/shopping experience.",1
773,"This review is for the buffet at Whole Foods. Overall, it is good, and there are lots of great options. The food seems fresh and it is a good place to get a quick, healthy lunch on-the-go. I went with a friend and we spent a little over $20 on lunch for the 2 of us, which seems a little high for what it is, but I think we must have just gotten a lot of food because $7.99/lb is fair. Plus it is hard to get lunch for any less than that these days without eating fast food.",4
774,"I'll be honest, I just don't get it.  When it comes to eating I do not adhere to any particular mantra or dietary restriction like vegan, organic, vegetarian, ethical, etc.  If it's edible and it's within my palate's liking range then I eat it.\n\nFrom that perspective this place just gets two stars.  Some items were higher priced but the value added (from organic to vegan certified) would I guess justify it if you had to have it.  But the items that do no fall under any of those premium-restriction value types are still just as highly priced.  So it feels like 90% of their inventory is priced at a whole-store experience premium.\n\nTheir prepared meals section was marvelous, and their cut fruit section was like I had died and gone to heaven.  But that's about the only two sections I probably would have been willing to open up my wallet.",2
775,"NO WI-FI.  Just FYI.  \n\nWhen I lived in Cleveland and my first (truly terrible) apartment had no wi-fi Whole Foods was my second home...I would buy a little sampler of buffet foods and salads, a coffee, maybe a vegan cookie, and park myself at a booth for an hour (or more, let's be real).  After I taught a yoga class.  I know, I know, I'm such a white liberal yuppie, it's painful.\n\nAnyway, so when the internet went out at my Pittsburgh home I trotted off to Whole Foods, bought some food and a coffee...and asked about the wi-fi.  \""We have it,\"" said Cashier #1.  \""It's probably just under \""Whole Foods.\""\""  \""We have it,\"" said Cashier #2, \""but I don't know the password - ask customer service.\""  \""We don't have it,\"" said Customer Service, \""go to Starbucks.\""\n\nBelieve it or not, Starbucks is letting me drink my coffee & eat my vegan cookie and didn't make me buy anything.\n\nNO WI-FI.  Otherwise, this Whole Foods is pretty good.",3
776,"I love shopping here. The staff is really nice, no attitudes. Even the other shoppers are kind. It's always nice. Thanks to everyone for making Whole Foods a nice shopping experience.",5
777,"I loved it, parking and all, after all, they had Palak Paneer! Mmmmm. It was tasty. I spent a lot, but I was ok with the occasional splurge. the second trip, i again bought my hit foods Palak Paneer and it had obviously gone over. \n\nEver have whoopsies after green Indian cuisine?\n\nIt's off my list now. Forever.",1
778,"This store is great - it's got all of the fresh specialty items we need for cooking great weekend meals for friends, but isn't a vast, overpowering warehouse. Items are well organized, and easy to find. As others' state, it ain't cheap! \n\nOne way we lowered our Whole Foods bill was to go for their 365 in-house brand, which is typically priced at the same pricepoint as similar items in the regular chain grocery stores. We don't use Whole Foods for all of our supermarket needs, just the specialty items, great produce, and seafood.\n\nI docked two stars for absolutely terrible parking - yep. I know that's harsh, but every time we come here, we need to factor in another 10-15 minutes to get a parking spot and be able to leave safely (there are always cars behind us looking for a spot when we are trying to leave, and so we often can't just pull out of the space and leave quickly...) Even being careful, we have almost been hit multiple times by people losing their cool with the terrible parking.\n\nThat being said, we will continue to come here to stock our home when we plan to entertain at home.",3
779,"I think Whole Foods and Giant Eagle Market District are competing for the title of most annoying place to shop. It all starts with the parking experience, which is ridiculously horrible at this location - very poorly planned. And then, there's the prices - Giant Eagle being quite expensive compared to similar grocers in other cities, Whole Foods obviously has to get a one up on those; it's inherent in the scheme of selling premium \""natural\"" goods. Whole Foods does have better lighting and layout than GE, and yes, a more discriminative selection of products, especially for people with specialized diets, like vegans (me) and gluten free adherents. The house baked bread here might be worse than GE (tough contest) - often under baked and thus soggy in middle and crusts tend to fall off; making gluten free-dom seem appealing. And I don't even need to talk about customer demographics, because you've all seen Rachel C.'s link!",2
780,"This store is pretty good. Yes it is fairly expensive but you can get quite a few items that are difficult if not impossible to find at other stores. They have a nice meat department with quite a few good naturally raised products, particularly beef. We've been very happy with their produce, which we find noticeably better than Trader Joe.\n\nI wish it was bigger so there was a larger selection and a larger prepared food selection (we are used to the larger stores in Chicago). Also wish there was a liquor department but I'll probably have to run for state office for that. Frankly the worst part is often parking. Don't know what causes everyone to behave badly in their lot (myself included) but man it can be a mess. \n\nAnyway we'll keep going at least for meats and produce.",3
781,"Just wanted to write a review based on my experience today.\n\nEverything I went for was in stock today (which doesn't always happen). The place was crowded, as usual, but the line went fairly quickly. On my way in, I saw a $5 fish sandwich with creamy coleslaw advertised outside. Three guys were there cooking. Looked and smelled delicious, so I paid inside with my groceries. When I came out, I told the guys I bought one. They were really nice and asked me what kind of bread I wanted and what I wanted on the sandwich.\n\nSome lady that was \""in a rush\"" was upset her sandwich wasn't ready when she came out (but they explained the fish was cooked, but they couldn't set up the sandwich without knowing what bread or toppings she wanted). Just watching the way they dealt with this customer was great for me. The guys were so friendly and patient.\n\nAlso, the sandwich was delicious! The coleslaw was also awesome! Yay! I am so happy I stopped by when I did.",4
782,"I love everything that Whole Foods offers, but I can't stand the experience of going there. The parking lot is a mess of aggressive drivers acting like the extra 50 feet of walking will negatively affect the environment more than their driving around the parking lot until a better space opens up. Once you get a space and finally get inside, the experience mirrors that of the parking lot. Everyone is in each others' way and trying to be the first one to find the best organic orange or grab the last package vegan general tso's in the store.\n\nTo be fair, though, the experience is still 100 times better than going to the Market District a few blocks down the same street. Similar in-store and in-lot experience, but with a better and higher-quality selection. The staff is always really nice and super helpful, and their trays of fruit and veggies are excellent. We've ordered them countless times for parties and have never been let down. Pricey, but excellent quality. The prepared foods are delicious, and their prepackaged prepared foods are also really good...but like nearly everything else in Whole Foods, a little pricey. For example, their yummy tomato bisque is $7. Hardly cheap enough for a quick lunch, but it is yummy. Their baked goods are delicious as well. We're constantly picking up bread from there (and the occasional doughnut), and we're never disappointed.\n\nTheir meats and seafoods departments are also excellent. They have a great variety and are always helpful in answering any questions that I've had (although we still opt for our meats from DJ's). Of course, if you're at Whole Foods your'e likely there for the organic options, and as to be expected, you're not going to find a better selection anywhere else. More unique, perhaps, but their inventory just won't be matched any time soon for those foods. Surprisingly, third-party & prepackaged pricing is actually on-par with Giant Eagle, so whenever we're looking for those types of items (milk/eggs/pastas, etc.), we always opt for Whole Foods.",3
783,"So..... when I think about shopping at Whole Foods, I always create an alternate universe where I think I would be able to shop here. I think: if I made at least twice the amount of money I currently do, I would be able to be a member of the club and shop here. .... but I don't. Thus, I only stop in here on very special occasions when I 1. can withstand the rage I feel when I pull into this parking lot; and 2. I want to either eat at the buffet or buy a very specific item. I would definitely recommend that others stop in sometime to get some food at the buffet. The quality of everything is pretty incredible (though of course it's typically really expensive).",3
784,"I love Whole Foods, and I have been a fan for a few years now. I've visited Whole Foods locations around the country, but this Pittsburgh location is one of my favorites. It's a small store, but it feels homey and comfortable.\n\nStaff: Most of the staff members are super friendly and willing to do just about anything to help you find what you are looking for. I had one staff member begrudgingly help me out, but I assumed he was having a bad day or was very busy. Either way, it's nice to treat others with respect. \n\nThe cashiers here are so fantastic. They are never rushing and throwing food into bags. They take their time, ask you questions and treat you like a person instead of another number in a long line. \n\nDeli/Made-To-Order: The deli and made-to-order foods are currently my favorite. Sometimes I would rather spend $20 on lunch here with my boyfriend than go to a restaurant or get fast food. My favorite is the vegan chicken salad on foccacia bread. I adore this bread. It's just the right texture, it's nice and herby and deliciously buttery. Topped with swiss or muenster, it's a super delish sandwich. If I am extra peckish, I get extra veg. chicken salad. Yum yum yum! \n\nThe tomato bisque they have is something I newly tried. I'm very picky about my tomatoes and tomato products. This soup delivers. I wish I could have it every single day. It's so phenomenal! My boyfriend got it today alongside a cheddar biscuit that paired beautifully with the soup. \n\nCheeses: If you want fancy gourmet cheeses, the Whole Foods deli counter might be the best choice. We purchased a small amount of Midnight Moon Goat Cheese Gouda and made the most expensively delicious grilled cheese sandwich. We're grown-ups now, say goodbye to gross American cheeses! The cheese counter is so great because all of the cheeses are labeled with the kind of rennet used in the processing. You can easily find a high-quality vegetarian cheese with just a glance. The cheese experts are also willing to talk cheese to you for as long as you like. \n\nStore Selection: Overall the store has great options, but they don't carry everything that I wish they did. Unfortunately, they discontinued one of my favorite products - Field Roast Deli Slices. They bring in new and trendy foodstuffs though, so it's enough to keep me happy. \n\nWhole Foods can be pretty expensive, but if you don't fall for the tempting packaged foods, you can get away with a reasonable grocery bill! I primarily shop here for special items though. \n\nP.S. Their selection of natural body and haircare is great and affordable. If you have sensitive skin or don't want your products tested on animals, go here!",4
785,"My expectations for Whole Foods Market had been established as was growing up in the DMV (D.C., MD, VA) area. Thus, very fresh produce, high-quality meats, diverse cheeses, expansive bulk section, novel food items, exceptional food bars, and excellent customer service were essentially a given. On the other hand, I also expected parking difficulties, even at stores with multi-story garages.\n\nThe Whole Foods Market in Pittsburgh is not much different from those in the DMV area. However, the parking is horrendous! Really, a medium-size private parking lot for the only Whole Foods Market in the Pittsburgh area right along a congested major road? Let me say that Whole Foods Markets in D.C. are also close to major roads, but they at least have underground or aboveground garages and fairly decent road infrastructure to accommodate for the influx and outflux of shoppers. I would love if the Pittsburgh store can build a garage of some sort (I'm not counting the garage next to the Starbucks and Walgreens) with smooth entry and exit so as to prevent a mini-gridlock along Centre Avenue.\n\nParking situation aside, the Pittsburgh store does live up to my expectations established from the DMV stores. You will rarely find a bad apple (no pun intended), and the store usually keeps shelves stocked (except when there is a major sale or promotion going on). Now, if only its prices and my budget could meet halfway so I could frequent this store more--via bike or my own two feet.",3
786,"I will start by saying this review is for the hot bar and I must of gone at an off hour for the hot bar and by that I mean during the dinner rush before they replenished it. I would say everything I got from the salad bar to the hot bar was good apart from they had run out of soup/special of the day and the chicken was beyond dry, the time I spent in the dessert was a wet oasis compared to the chicken. I just feel that for the price I paid it was not worth it. I have been to a smaller whole foods with a better hot bar and to the one in New York City and remember it being great. I only give this one 3 stars because the Mac n cheese and vegan tofu loaf was rather good. But I must repeat myself about the price. For what I got it's way to much. It's hard to justify paying that much when I could make it for 1/5th the price at home. Now I know I don't have to cook or clean and that's the point of eating out but I could also go to trader joes get a few frozen meals and eat for over a day for the price of one hot bar meal from whole foods.",3
787,"Yes, the parking lot in crazy. Yes, the prices are outrageously high (it's not called Whole Paychecks for nuthin'). Yes, the store is small and usually crowded and the majority of the people who shop who here completely unaware they are NOT the only people on the planet. All those things aside, I love Whole Foods. Most of the issues can be handled by slight changes in habit. For instance, park farther away instead of circling the GD parking lot for the closest spot!!! I get so sick of people complaining about that damn parking lot when all you have to do is park by Walgreens and walk. Seriously, the walk won't kill most of us. Stop being lazy. (Sorry, for the tirade; that's a pet peeve of mine). \n\nThe produce is fantastic, always. And not just the organic stuff either. The regular pesticide-laden produce is great. The quality of the meat department is second to none. Now, the bakery is a little 'Eh' for me. The muffins and cookies and cakes always look De-Lish!, but they aren't. Usually to dry or dense or flavorless. It really doesn't matter because the star of the show is...\n\nThe HOT FOODS BAR. The quality and taste of most of the hot foods/prepared foods bar is unbeatable. I lovelvoelove the breakfast bar. My dream weekend starts with waking up and taking a nice long walk, stopping for coffee then heading on to WF to pick up Eggs Rancheros Burritos and Sausage patties from the breakfast bar. I may get creamed by a bus the second I leave, but I will die happy. \n\nSome of my other favorites are a Vegan General Tso's \""chicken\"" that has the BEST real chicken texture. It's really good! The mozzarella pasta salad, Sicilian cauliflower and the egg rolls which are seasonal. Don't forget to check out the packaged hot foods across from the salad bar; same stuff but pre-packaged. \n\nAs a note though, the chicken fiesta soup is nooooot good. Bland with a capital B! In general the soups are hit or miss, but a real hit is the triple squash or Butternut squash, something like that. It's next to sushi. It's very good",4
788,"As a vegan (since 2008) we are a regular at whole foods. It's convenient since we live in Lawrenceville. My one and biggest complaint is that they need to carry more (if not all) organic produce. Not this \""conventional\"" garbage. Other than that they have a huge variety of products and grocery items to choose from. Staff is always friendly and helpful.",4
789,"Alright, so I braved this place yesterday (new years eve) and it was totally insane. There was honking, some road rage and confusion. But I will say that I should have known better coming into a grocery store before a major partying holiday.  \n\nAnyway, in terms of produce this place is awesome. I got my meat and bacon from this joint and have not been disappointed. I also love their premade hamburgers. They are delish. This is also a great place to find a great assortment of cheeses and grass fed butter ( I go for the kerry gold products, they are just awesome).  \n\nAlso if you are grilling and dont want to cook too many sides, you can pick up some of their sides from their deli section. I haven't had a bad experience with their food and you can always give everything a taste before having the clerk put it in a container.  This is certainly the place to get specialty items like hemp seeds, chia seeds, and other natural dietary supplements... just beware they are not cheap. Overall, whole foods is not cheap, but if you want quality this is the place to go. Just dont go here on New Year's Eve or Christmas Eve... you'll end up ripping your hair out!!",5
790,"I went here to get my serpentine belt replaced and a transmission flushed and these guys were friendly and efficient.  They took the time to explain things to me and I felt comfortable that they were making the appropriate recommendations without trying to charge me for things I didn't need.  It was ready in just a few hours as promised so I was able to pick it up same day.  Only complaint is that they left my transmission fluid dipstick out of place under the hood so it was just laying on top, but fortunately it didn't fall down and screw up anything since it was laying flat on the top, but if it had that could've been a more serious problem.  So I subtracted a star for that since it seemed a bit careless.",4
791,"If I could give them zero stars, I would. Awful! My car wouldn't start so I called the tow and he managed to get it started, but it's been acting up so I brought it in anyways. After having my car for an entire week and not calling me once, after I've called twice, the man on the phone told me it was ready to pick up, nothing wrong with it. When I went to pick it up, I turned it on and before I could even leave the lot, it died! I went back in and told him that the tow truck operator hooked it up to a jumper box and pumped the gas to start it. That's what he did. Then told me it probably didn't start because it was sitting so long. Then he told me \""I don't know anything about your car\""! I left and sure enough had trouble getting it started at my next destination, had to pump the gas pedal. Yeah, that sounds like \""nothing's wrong\"". DO NOT BRING YOUR CAR HERE.

795,"Jimmy Tsang's Chinese Restaurant is one of the old \""traditional\"" Pittsburgh restaurants, a place you remember as always \""being there.\""  My parents feel the same way about it.  It is a good, if unspectacular place with reliable, tasty fare like honey chicken, Chinese flank steak, and authentic eggrolls.  \n\nI don't normally go for the spicy fare, indeed I prefer the plainer dishes like chicken with vegetables, but they have one item on the menu that I've always wanted to try--Sau La Gi, which is stir-fried hot spicy chicken, onions, green onions & fresh bean sprouts.  Perhaps I've never noticed, but I don't recall seeing it anywhere else.  It was good, but Hoo-Boy did I have to pace myself while eating it.  And have plenty of water nearby!  Sau La Gi was worth trying once, but it really wasn't to my tastes and I doubt I'll have it again.\n\nMy friend Maryann tried  Ching Za Gai (spicy also) which is roasted crispy chicken served with tangy vinaigrette sauce.  I sampled it and perhaps I will order that for myself next time.  I'd like to cook a milder version of it myself at home.  \n\nMore to my tastes however are the Garden Chicken, Chicken with Broccoli, or Beef with Pea Pods.  Seafood dishes include Sweet and Sour Shrimp and  Sauteed Shrimp Szechaun Style.  Yeah, I'm a little unimaginative when it comes to Chinese food, but I know what I like and if a place can do the basics right, it's okay in my book!\n\nJimmy Tsang's also has a convenient and inexpensive lunch menu.  The place also does Korean Barbecue and you can book a private dining room for you and your special someone with a $100 deposit.",3
796,"Walking into Jimmy Tsang's was like walking into the Chinese restaurant that was on Hawaii Five-0 - it puts you back in time to the 1960's and the food is reminiscent of that era also.\n\nHot & Sour soup was highly americanized, not very hot or very sour.\nWonton Soup was a very large portion and good.\n\nEgg Rolls were large, slightly greasy but the filling was flavorless, not very good.\nCheese wonton's were okay but the old grease used to fry them in over-powered the flavor.\nChinese Flank steak was tough and chewy in a soy style sauce thickened with cornstarch, a little too salty and greasy but overall it was good.\nFlaming chicken was chicken breast with sugar peas, bamboo shoots and baby corn in a white/clear cornstarch chicken base sauce, that lacked much of any flavor except slat - it was just okay.\n\nTea tasted like American Lipton brewed in large quantities in the back than served in a generic tea-pot.\n\nThe place was clean service was good, prices are very good, but the food was just average.",2
797,"I really feel bad about giving a one-star review.  First, it's not about the service, price, decor, or the food.  I'm writing this review after going there twice.  The first time my husband and I went, the dinner was good.  We thought this place has the potential to be our go-to Chinese restaurant in Pgh.  Today I remembered that they have an early-bird special 3-6pm (m-sat).  The won ton soup was not authentic (more like chicken noodle soup) but wasn't bad.  The entree was fine.  \n\nWhat really knocked the score down to 1 is the awful tobacco/cigarette smell from the tea!! ? !!   I had to go to the grocery store and buy a pack of gum.

Selection by the glass is limited.  \n\nAs for their menu/dinner - this is totally a different story.  I haven't really been disappointed yet!  The appetizers/small plates all pretty good, I really like the chevre croquettes ($7).  The salads are good and although I haven't gotten the soup anytime lately, I hear great things from my friends.  The entrees are always excellent - I usually tend to stick to the seafood (halibut, $29) and never have been disappointed (and importantly, nothing has ever been overcooked).  The signature orecchiette dish ($20) is soooo delicious - just ignore the fact that it is a heart attack waiting to happen - it's worth it.  The desserts are ok, personally, I feel that you would be better advised to stick to filling up on the entrees.  \n\nOh, and let me recommend the blood orange martini if they have it - very very yummy!  And it is nice that you can order Veuve Cliquot by the glass ($16).\n\nPrices are a bit high for what you'd expect for Pittsburgh, but considering the quality of food, I would recommend it.\n\nP.S. I have heard that they have a great brunch on Sundays. I personally haven't tried it, but with the number of compliments I hear, it's probably worth the try!\n\n-------------------------\nUpdate 12/9/07:  Went to the brunch.  What a great deal!  For $22, you get a choice of alcoholic beverage (bloody mary, mimosa, bellini) as well as a starter and then the entree.  They have a lot of choices, so be prepared to just try one and come back again to try the other stuff!  The smoked salmon appetizer was good although with too much mayonnaise sauce and for me, too much onion.  The truffled potato was yummy.  The arugula salad was as delicious as ever!  And for entree, we both got the Casbah benedict.  I have to admit that neither of us was blown away, but it was good and filling.  I think that we will both be back to try other things on the menu!",4
805,"As the reviews of Casbah appear to be particularly long-winded ... the place is nice, fancy, organic-ish, alternating menu, nice atmosphere. Good date restaurant. Good food-lovers restaurant.",5
806,"The food here is pretty good.  Comparable to any 3 to 3.5 star restaurant.  The lamb is definitely good.  And it is definitely a good date restaurant.  I would rather give it 3.5 stars since I've definitely eaten at better restaurants. But for Pittsburgh, it ranks pretty high up.",4
807,Can be moderately priced for lunch -- take advantage!  We had a cheese tasting simply because I *never* pass up Pleasant Ridge Reserve when given the opportunity.  They also choose a lovely soft sheep's milk and an herbed goat cheese from Cypress Grove.  Nice work but pricey -- only two slices of baguette and apple!  I had the romaine salad -- should have gone with a sandwich and the delicious looking truffle fries!  The feta and red pepper dressing were just too salty and rich for 1pm.  I spied a number of delicious looking sandwiches from my table...\n\nService was great and the waiter even went out of his way to answer a couple questions about the cheese selection.,4
808,"Another great big burrito restaurant, Casbah offers some great wine and spectacular food in some great, and varied, dining rooms.\n\nThe three dinning rooms, \""outside,\"" inside and downstairs.  While downstairs isn't always open when it is try and get a seat down there, it is beautiful and quiet.  Perfect for a larger group of people.  Outside is always open and you don't really realize you are outside aside from the non-padded patio chairs and heat lamps all around.\n\nThe food is Mediterranean fusion, not exactly sure what is meant by that but it is good. The hummus here was actually the first hummus that I had ever had and I am sorry to say it is what I compare all other to, few match up.\n\nThe wine list is extensive, but if you are going for an upscale bar this isn't the place, for that you'll want to go down the road to Soba.  If you want a nice place to have a drink and a conversation, Casbah is it.",4
809,"Meh.  Seriously?  Mediterranean?  What?  Sorry, but just because you serve scallops on babah ganoush doesn't make your restaurant Mediterranean.\n\nThis was kind of a disappointment, if you couldn't tell by my sarcastic tone.  The food was good, and I had a great time, but the food lacked the final eyebrow raising component that you come to expect with the bill that follows.\n\nThat said, the wine list was good and the prices were reasonable relative to the food.  Get the cheese course for dessert and you'll go home happy.",3
810,"Amazing brunch! I'd never been to Casbah before until this past Sunday when we decided to check it out for their prix-fixe menu.\n\nFor $22, you get your choice of alcoholic brunch beverage, an appetizer and an entree. An incredible price for a serious amount of great food. They had many options on their fixed menu - something for everyone. From huge waffles and omelets to lamb dishes, fish and the usual brunch regulars such as eggs benedict too. The appetizers list was equally as large. \n\nI started with a bloody mary. Was a nice middle ground between heavy and light - and it had some kick to it. Very good. For an appetizer I got the cheese and fruit plate with french baguette slices. There was a soft brie-like goat cheese, a blue cheese and a mild dry sheeps milk cheese as well. All were wonderful. For my entree I went with the Salmon Eggs Benedict. It was perfect. The fruit on the side was fresh cut, and the home fries were crispy on the outside, soft on the inside.\n\nI tasted a couple of other things as well. Both the polenta and the mushroom soup on the appetizer list were great. Didn't try any of the other entrees, but everyone seemed pleased. The only complaint was from a friend that ordered the truffle omelet - and it was that he thought they went too heavy on truffle oil, drowning out the eggs. \n\nAlso, service was absolutely perfect. We had a tall waiter, forget his name, but he was one of the most professional servers I've ever had. The table was cleared and cleaned immediately...he was never pushy, always friendly, and had great suggestions. One of the best experiences I've had for restaurant service anywhere.\n\nFor brunch in Pittsburgh, this is my favorite so far. Not to be missed!\n\nNow I just need to make plans to go back for dinner.",4
811,"There is a disconnect here between this name, the decor and the food. That said, I had the best pork chop I've ever had here and for that I was endlessly thankful. Good salad, delicious bread and hummus. Great service. For Pittsburgh, top notch.",4
812,"This is my favorite Big Burrito restaurant and definitely one of my favorite restaurants in the country. \n\nGotta be honest, though. Just about every time I'd been here, it's with colleagues, which means lots and lots of boozing!! Therefore, consequently, as a result, in sum, I don't have a crystal clear memory of what I had for appetizer, entree, dessert, etc. \n\nWhat I can tell you is that I had never been disappointed with anything I've ordered here. And believe you me, if the food is not that good, I will remember it no matter how drunk I am. Sure, it's not exactly a \""Mediterranean\"" restaurant, but who cares? The food is great, it's in a super cute hood, the atmosphere is cozy and comfy, and the service is always spot on. \n\nI do recall that the very last time I ate here was with a dear friend and two of her British colleagues, and we had ourselves a grand ol' time. I had the arugula --one of my favorite words. It's lovely, no? Say it with me. A -ru-gu-la! Fun, right?!! And so flavorful!! --salad and cioppino, which was outstanding with super freshy fresh ingredients. What about dessert, you ask? Sorry, kids. By that time I really was drunk, and I can't remember. It was super tasty, though! I remember everyone liking mine the best. Sure do, sugar!\n\nSo pay no mind to others' taxonomy quip and give this place a whirl. It's a great date or small group place. Oh, and super fantastic wine list, too!",5
813,"I was determined to let this one pass (experience was not worth commentary) until I made a disturbing discovery...\n\nI made a reservation for inside. They sat us outside. That turned out to be preferable to us because the tables that WERE available inside were very close to others. The patio was spacious and decorated with busts, slightly preferable to the inner cheap.trendy.interiors.com shit. Have you seen the terrible bathroom wallpaper borders? Probably not, as the ladies room is a very dim place; don't expect to be able to notice that your botox implant is crooked. Anyway, It was HOT under the Space-Ray heater on the patio, making for a sweaty and ice-instantly-melted beverage winter night. The food was alright with some interesting flavor pairings, but it was certainly not quite worth the price. The bread was the best I've had in Pittsburgh. Our server made it seem that everything she was doing was somebody else's job, in fact, it was mostly other people who delivered, which made it confusing in terms of knowing who to ask for things and whether or not to factor some of the fine service into the tip that presumably goes mostly to the primary server who was sub-par for upscale dining; our question for the kitchen left unanswered, \""the host is supposed to do that but I will...\"" Run on. When I described the qualities I was looking for in my wine choice during beverage inquiry, she just stared blankly and waited for me to decide. The wine list did not include descriptions. The gal who delivered the wine thankfully did describe it before popping the top and it was determined that I did not want this cheapest option before me! She described another bubbly that sounded and was, according to my own tastes, delightful. \n\nI was so very satisfied with the sparkling sensation of the meal that I sought it out at the Wine and Spirits store. This was the moment that my minor disappointment in the value of my special-occasion dinner at Casbah turned into a feeling of devastating violation. I am talking about a 400% markup on the retail price of this wine. If you want to do your own math: at Casbah the 1/2 bottle of Gruet Blanc Du Noirs cost $35, while a WHOLE bottle at W&S is priced at $16.99. You can bet that I will choose to enjoy this wine elsewhere, like Avenue B (byob), next time. \n\nCasbah is lacking the quality service, honesty and original ambiance that should accompany creative food at moderately high prices.\n\n**Update: I recently saw a full size bottle of the Gruet on a restaurant menu for $30; Casbah, take a tip!",2
814,"My boyfriend took me to Casbah for my birthday this March. This is one of our twice-a-year splurges and I have been wanted to go to this restaurant for ages.\nWe were seated outside, in the covered, heated patio. We were far enough away from the heaters that we didn't get too hot, and far enough from the doors that we didn't get too cold. The menu has changed slightly since we dined there, but some of the things have stayed the same.\nWe started with the sheep's milk gnudi, which is like ravioli without the pasta. I have a gluten allergy and I have missed ravioli quite a bit, so I was happy to eat this. The flavor of the sheep's milk is quite strong and unique, which I like. \nFor entree, I had the double-cut pork chop. This was absolutely great - the flavors and textures of the pork, butternut squash risotto, braised kale, garlic cream, and sage jus went really well together. It was an enormous portion, as well - I took some home and ate it the next day!\nMy boyfriend had the seared rare tuna. He was less thrilled with his dish, and when I tasted it, I agreed. I normally LOVE seared tuna but this was not the best treatment of it. It tasted a little too \""fishy\"" and I didn't think the other flavors complimented the tuna. \nInstead of dessert, we sampled two dessert wines recommended to us by the server. I do think that $10 is a little much to charge for such a small glass of wine, but I guess that's what you have to expect when you dine at this level.\nWe are great fans of the Big Burrito restaurants, and I think we preferred our experience at Soba to Casbah. While our food was really good, the prices were a little unreasonably high. And I wouldn't recommend the seared tuna!",4
815,"For our last lunch in Pittsburgh we decided to return to the Big Burrito Group; Eleven was quite good and both Gayot and Pittsburgh Magazine compared the experience at Casbah favorably to that of Big Burrito's crown jewel.  Citing a mix of Mediterranean and Northern African influences with a bargain Piccola Gusto Menu for lunch and the option for indoor or al fresco dining it seemed as if Casbah was a can't miss option...well, sometimes things don't turn out quite as you expect - almost everything that transpired from the moment we arrived until the moment we left was a failure.\n\nWhen our server, a young woman named Amanda L who would prove quite inept and inefficient from start to finish, finally did arrive our menus were delivered with a brief hello before she wandered away - another server later stopped by to fill our water and drinks were never even offered.  When Amanda finally did return she was capable of answering a couple questions about portion size and our orders were placed.  With my mom and sister opting for the two-course Gusto lunch and myself choosing two courses a la carte we sat and sipped our water.\n\nWaiting approximately 10 minutes another ancillary server arrived with bread and butter - a light and airy white bread with a hefty crust paired with a sweet and salted cow's milk butter - decent, but nothing to write home about compared to the myriad bread options at Eleven.  After this point we would not see another staff member for 30 minutes...well, we would see them, they just wouldn't be walking anywhere near our table - instead bussing tables and running around while the hostess flirted with a man at the bar...I'll note that my water glass remained empty for greater than 15 minutes.\n\nFinished with our first courses approximately 10 minutes would pass - long enough for me to actively collect each and every plate and stack them at the empty seat of our four-top - before Amanda would finally return to collect the dirty plates...we'd not see her again until 15 minutes later when she filled our water glasses and told us our main courses would be \""right out.\""  While I guess she didn't define \""right out,\"" what this actually meant was \""in 25 minutes.\""  Starting first with my mother's combo - Jumbo Lump Crab, pepper bacon, avocado, radish sprouts, on a paesano bun and Orecchiette Pasta with grilled chicken, dried cranberries, Riverview Farms goat cheese, sage cream. While the sandwich may not be memorable, the pasta was actually quite impressive.  Using a less salty cheese and mild cream to flavor the al dente little ears of pasta worked wonders while the sweet/savory m\u00e9lange of craisins and grilled chicken were a nice match.\n\nVastly less well done than my mother's plate would be my sister's option - the Grilled Vegetables, portobello, zucchini, eggplant, arugula, chickpea hummus, on baguette and Maccheretto pasta with wild mushrooms, white beans, sun-dried tomatoes, rapini pesto, fontina, walnuts.  Beginning with the sandwich, the bite I had was good in taste but rather mushy in consistency - too many similar vegetable textures and the hummus spread too thickly.  Moving on to the pasta - we all tasted it, but I'm still not sure what we were supposed to be tasting - it tasted like watery cheese...no spice, no salt, and certainly nothing resembling pesto or tomatoes.  For the first time in the meal Amanda actually opted to check on us approximately 10 minutes into our main courses and when told of the watery pasta she did apologize and offered to replace it with something else - more Orcchiette.\n\nFor my main course I received a simple side salad-fresh greens, crispy onion strings, and a pleasant vinaigrette.  The salad, of course, was served alongside Elysian Fields Lamb \""Mac and Cheese\"", tubetti pasta, mascarpone, cheddar, Pecorino-Romano, and bread crumbs.  Piping hot and browned with crispy bread crumbs the dish was a decent Macaroni and Cheese, but honestly the lamb was so scarce and thinly cut that it added little.\n\nCompleting our mains approximately 110 minutes after entering Casbah we again waited nearly ten minutes before anyone would stop by to collect dirty plates-a different ancillary server this time.  With my mother and sister already deciding enough was enough they stood up to use the restroom before leaving-by the time Amanda would stop by to ask if anyone would care for dessert our two course meal had lasted 2:05 and I skipped on a menu entailing bread pudding, carrot cake, and panna cotta with \""just the bill.\""\n\nSettling the bill via credit card no tip was left because no tip was deserved - in reality Amanda may have actually be the worst server I've encountered at a fine dining establishment in the last 2 years.  I will note that when I wrote to Big Burrito was met by a (seemingly) sincere apology without excuses - the Manager stated things don't' normally happen like that and he'd be sure the issue was addressed.  He closed with \""I hope you will join us again.\"" I will not.",1
816,"great atmosphere and great food. while the menu changes seasonally, my group all enjoyed the food - crab/scallop pasta, pumpkin risotto and rare tuna.\n\ncasbah also has a great wine list, and great service that is there when you need them, but doesn't annoy.",4
817,"I've been here twice now, once for drinks and once for dinner, and I'd have to say that generally, I'm a fan.  Their happy hour has some good deals - $6 cocktails and glasses of wine, and $1 of bottled beer.  It was a fun, trendy atmosphere and a nice place to go for a glass of sangria after a busy day.\n\nI came back for dinner a month or so later.  We had reservations (on a Monday night) and were seated immediately -even though the restaurant was surprisingly busy.  We sat in the covered area out front - sort of like sitting in a dim, Mediterranean garden.  And yes - the lights are low throughout the whole restaurant.  Even with my young eyes, I still needed a candle to read the menu.  But it is romantic and a peaceful place to eat.  A little uncomfortable, as they have metal chairs (sort of like upscale patio furniture), but not a big deal.  Sit inside at a booth if you need to sit on something soft.\n\nThe menu is pricey and we're all poor, so we just got entrees.  I actually had a cocktail to start - the Perfect Pear - with elderflower liqueur, vodka, sage, pear, and vermouth.  There was even a little sage leaf floating in the glass.  It was a wonderful drink, with all the flavors I love.  Still, for the price, I think the portion was a little stingy.  When I buy an $11 cocktail, I like it to really fill the glass.  We nibbled on warm bread while we waited, and all tried their pesto on top - I think it was an unusual homemade pesto, something like walnut-watercress?  It was a bit bland - I think regular basil pesto would've been a better choice.\n\nThings got better during the actual dinner.  I ordered the Heritage Farms Chicken which was juicy and fresh, and served with a tangy pasta.  Each little detail of the dish was well-chosen - honestly, even the grilled baby squash was outstanding.  It's just squash!  But somehow, it was heavenly.  My friend enjoyed her Cioppino, and my boyfriend liked his veal tortellini, complete with rich pieces of lobster.  I tried a little bit, and it was tasty - very herbal and really bursting with flavor.  The only dish that fell a little flat was the potato gnocchi - my friend's boyfriend ordered it.  Actually he liked most of it very much, but he couldn't get past the aggressive bitterness of the turnip greens.  I tasted them too, and I have to say - it was off-putting.  Perhaps that's just the way turnip greens are, but it really didn't work for us in the dish.  Fortunately, the waitress was incredibly kind and helpful, and brought him out a new plate sans greens, which he finished happily.\n\nWe also had a few desserts - vanilla bean creme brulee for us, flourless chocolate torte for them.  I didn't taste it, but apparently it was incredibly rich.  I enjoyed our creme brulee - because I enjoy all creme brulee - although the roasted quince on top didn't quite work for me.  \n\nOverall, the meal ranged between good and very good, but the great service from our waitress really pushed this to a 4 star rating.  I had hoped to be a little more wowed by the food.  But this experience was definitely positive enough to warrant a second visit for dinner.  I think it'd be a nice place to go for a special occasion, or if you feel like a little splurge on a flavorful meal.",4
818,"Very tasty food and drinks! Its a little pricey, but worth it if you want something better than a typical chain.",3
819,"The interior is very nice. The food is a hit or miss. We went for brunch today. You can select a drink (alcoholic or non), an appetizer, and a brunch entree for the price of $22. The appetizers we had (pollenta and squash&chestnut soup) were very good. The entrees, on the other hand, left a lot to be desired. We got the mushroom omelet and jumbo lump crab and tomato omelet. The omelet was very bland. It did not have much flavor and needed seasoning and more ingredients than just eggs. Basically, I have had better omelets at some Denny's. My drink mimosa was just OK. My girlfriend's blood mary was delicious, though -- uniquely spicy. \n\nI have been to Casbah 4 times, last time being for brunch today. The first time, it was good, worthy of 4 stars. It gradually went down to 3 stars. The wine selection is good. But the food is definitely hit or miss. Once I had a halibut that smelled like the ocean. It was not well cooked or fresh, or something. Consistency is the key in a nice restaurant; Casbah leaves much to be desired in this regard.",3
820,"Disappointing. \n\nMy bf and I went for JUST dessert and wine, which we told the hostess ahead of time. The waitress was very curt and disrespectful. We were rushed to order (even though there were plenty of empty tables and it was NOT closing time). She did not offer suggestions or advice.\n\nWe ended up ordering the flourless chocolate cake. The cake was extremely rich (but delicious!) and the portion was just right for sharing after dinner. The marscapone was silky and paired perfectly with the cherries on top.\n\nThe waitress kept coming back to see if we were done and ready for our check. After we got the check, she was in a hurry to get us out the door. I am completely dissatisfied with the service and will not go back to this restaurant simply because of it.",2
821,"I have to agree with the \""hit or miss\"" reviewers about Casbah, at least when it comes to the food. I came here for brunch last weekend with a big group. They were very accomodating to us throughout the reservation process and the brunch, which was good. And our waiter, Daniel, was great. \n\nThe previous reviewer who said the Bloody Mary is the best drink was spot-on. It had a great spice and was the only drink that seemed like it had any alcohol in it at all. The mimosa and sangria were very \""eh.\"" \n\nI loved my smoked salmon appetizer (and that did seem to be the hit at the table), but entrees around the table left people disappointed. The goat cheese and mushroom omelette could have had a heckuva lot more goat cheese and mushrooms, and my scallop/sausage/grits/egg dish just had way too much going on. The grits were actually fabulous, but the scallops were overcooked and got lost next to the scrambled eggs (?) and sage sausage crumbles. \n\nIf I lived in Pittsburgh, I could see myself coming back here for wine and appetizers, but I'm not sure I would make it a regular brunch or dinner spot.",3
822,"I came here with a friend for her birthday, and the food really isn't particularly special.  Portions are decent, and I guess the prices are reasonable... if they had better food. \n\nThe outside of restaurant makes me think that the inside will be just as square and boring, but the inside patio area was pretty nice actually.\n\nOverall, I just wasn't very impressed with the food.  If I was offered to eat this food for free, sure, I'd take a helping, but probably not seconds.",2
823,"My husband and I went to Casbah to celebrate my birthday one evening.  We were seated on the patio which was fine before a party of 20 was seated with a 1 year old who was banging his silverware on the table all night.  So much for romantic!  Ever hear of a babysitter?  Anyway, ambience aside, let's get to the food which overall I would give a C+.  We started with the veal and pork meatballs which were the highlight of the meal.  The perfect blend of sweet (fresh tomato sauce) and spicy -- the meatballs had a nice tang, and the polenta was delicious albeit there wasn't much of it there.  We each then had the heirloom tomato salad which was tasteless.  I grow heirlooms and know the intense and wonderful flavor they should have. These tasted like a grocery store tomato bought in December.  Very disappointing.  I opted for the cavatelli entree which was not prepared as described on the menu.  It was swimming in tomato sauce and overall was very bland.  Another disappointment.  My husband had the pork chop which wasn't bad but certainly didn't leave us wanting to return here for the food.  All this said, the service was professional, we enjoyed the drinks (he had the sangria and I their house cosmopolitan) and had a lovely bottle of wine.  I might return here for happy hour but it was not the right choice for a romantic special occasion dinner.  And we had the decency to hire a babysitter for our children, otherwise we would have stayed home.",3
824,"I finally went to Casbah for brunch today. Rolled in at 10am to meet a handful of people. Because it is Labor Day weekend, the place was empty except for a woman who had just gotten there too which was nice because a friend had warned me that the place gets crazy. We sat outside and atmosphere was cozy under the tent with the warm colors of the decor. Our waitress was incredibly friendly and presented us with the menus. I think it is great they have a prix fixe brunch - 1 alchy or nonalchy drink, an appetizer and an entree - but for $24. It looks like they have since raised the prices since Miles O. went. I felt it was just a tad steep and a lot of food but took the plunge anyway. I ordered the smoked salmon for the appetizer and the mushroom omlette for my entree, and had a hot coffee (they did not have ice coffee though offered to put ice with hot coffee if I wanted it). The waitress brought out some delicious mini baked treats before we got our dishes - poppy scone (on the crispier side but delicious), blueberry muffins and biscuits, which were all buttery goodness. After eating these I was getting a little full and then after my appetizer I realized I probably should not have gotten the prix fixe but could have would have should have. I ended up boxing half of my omlette entree. Portions were large, atmosphere was cool, food was good and wait staff were awesome but in the end I don't think $24 (not including the tip and tax) was worth it.",3
825,"Passed this restaurant for years on my way to Buffalo Blues or more recently Mad Mex but have never actually eaten here.  Having finally come for lunch, I overall enjoyed it but it had some ups and some downs.  \n\nI ordered the Piccola Gusto Menu which for me included the Cream of Cauliflower soup, the Orecchiette Pasta and the Roasted Turkey Sandwich.  It sounds like a lot of food but the pasta serving is mini and it's a half sandwich.  For me, the size was just right.  The soup was awesome, and I could have eaten an entire lunch of just it.  The pasta was a little too creamy for me and just didn't have enough seasoning or spice.  I did love the addition of the cranberries in it though.  The perfect amount of sweet to offset the cream.  The roast turkey sandwich was just that.  Not out of this world, but not bad.  My biggest complaint was the service.  It took a really long time to get our meals which is always a bad thing during a weekday lunch.  \n\nI'd like to go back here for a happy hour when it's warm so I can enjoy the covered patio though and a nice glass of wine!",3
826,This place was recommended by an employee at Evolve spa across the street and I was very happy with the restaurant. The Salmon appetizer was delicious as was the gnocchi meal. I will definitely go back to this restaurant when I visit the area.,4
827,Food phenomenal! Service can be hit or miss.,4
828,"1. Sat outside on patio metallic chairs and tables, when we made reservation expecting to sit in the restaurant, not outside! There was no information about this. If the restaurant inside seats g is full. Then they should mention to the customers making reservations that they will be sitting outside!!!\n2. Food is mediocre at best! They even screwed my order. Asked for risotto and got some pasta, not sure what.\n3. Asked for two cabs, someone at restaurant changed it to one big cab instead which could not hold all of us so we had to wait for another 25 mins for another one!!\n Would not recommend to anyone. Enough other good restaurants in Pittsburgh to go to. They have to have paid their way into magazines rating them highly!",2
829,"Overall a good experience. Food was mostly very good. My sweet pea risotto was just OK. My wife's short rib ravioli was creative and very tasty. Neither of us are big eaters, but noted how small the portions were, especially compared to the price. One cup of risotto for $20+? Four ravioli for the same?\n\nThey altered the desert recipe on request, which for sure was over and above the call.\n\nService was attentive and the setting nice.",4
830,"Sharia don't like it, and neither does Becky. \n\nBoy and I went to Casbah on a warm Tuesday evening. The restaurant wasn't busy, and we were seated in the inviting outdoor patio. Our waitress was very pleasant and extremely informative about both the drink and food menus. \n\nWe shared a bottle of Mission la Caminade (Malbec, French). This was a very good, medium-bodied wine. \n\nMany yelpers have raved about Casbah's bread and pesto. I don't get it. I've had much better sourdough elsewhere and the pesto wasn't anything to write home about. \n\nI had the asparagus soup with crab for an appetizer.  The soup was served cold and tasted fresh enough, but something was off, and I barely ate half of it. \n\nI ordered the orecchiette pasta as an entree, which was served with grilled chicken and cranberries in a goat cheese cream sauce. I am upset to report that this tasted rather bland. The cranberries were the only spark of flavor in the dish.  Boy ordered the ricotta cavatelli pasta, which was in a marinara sauce with sausage and ricotta. I am sad to report that this too was tasteless. The ricotta was dumped on top and added nothing to the dish. \n\nWe glanced at the dessert menu, after spending so much on food we didn't enjoy, boy and I decided to cross the street for ice cream, instead. \n\nOverall, Casbah has a nice atmosphere and service, but their food quality doesn't match the price tag.",2
831,"I had a free entree from Big Burrito for my birthday, for which we decided to use at Casbah a few weeks ago. It was my first time there, though I've tried a few other BB restaurants in the past. \n\nFood: \n- Cracked pepper butter was delicious - I had to warn the waitress not to let me have any more bread and ruin my meal!\n- Grilled Bruschetta (ricotta, fava beans, Swiss chard,  preserved lemon, arugula, chervil, Calcagno) was a bit too lemon-y for my liking\n- Short Rib Raviolli (Short Rib Ravioli, Swiss chard, oyster mushrooms, roasted shallots, gremolata) was very savory and I would definitely order it again\n- Double-Cut Pork Chop (with braised kale, prosciutto & parmesan risotto, garlic cream, sage jus) was Joe's meal. I tasted a bit of everything and really enjoyed the kale. I like really really creamy risotto, and this wasn't quite there. I dont want to say it was undercooked, as I like I just like mine over-cooked.\n- Fried Apple Empanadas (vanilla bean cider reduction, toasted oat streusel,  \ncaramel ice cream) The ice cream was great, but the empanadas were bland to me.\n\nService: Not terrible. I understand at nice restaurants people enjoy taking their time to relax, enjoy their meals, and converse with their dinner-mates, but our server should have been more observant to the fact that we would be just sitting there with empty places waiting for the desert menu. I will note, though, that the table next to us returned two glasses of the same wine and the bartender came over and very politely suggested an alternative wine for the patron. They were very accommodating in this way. \n\nWill I go back? Someday - but I think I may try Soba or Kaya first.",3
832,"I was treated to Casbah for lunch by a potential employer who had passed me over, but really, really liked me. She said it was her favorite restaurant, but that she didn't go as often as she'd like.\n\nI knew the building from the early 80's when it had been one of Pittsburgh's dive gay bars called 'The Tender Trap', and knowing this, as well as a lot about the Big Bistroid Group...oops...Big BURRITO Group, I was curious to try it out and see if it lived up to the usual Big Burrito hype.  And voila, indeed, it's another excruciatingly overpriced bistroid in da burgh.\n\nThe atmosphere is actually quite lovely, inside or out. The colors are comfortable, the noise levels subtle, the seating comfortable, and the service staff looks professional (YOUNG) with no Coney Island side show appearances.\n\nThe service was good. Not overly friendly, but not uppity like young people waiting tables in more upscale restaurants tend to be in da bugh.\n\nThe menu was short, but did have a list of pretty unique offerings.  My friend had a salmon salad, and I opted to try the Farm Lamb Mac-n-Cheese.  The waiter brought a small basket with bread to the table accompanied by a single medium sized pat of salted butter to spread.  For a beverage, we both opted for just water.\n\nI have to say, if I actually had to pay for this, I would have been pretty miffed.  \n\nFor LUNCH, the prices were all around the $15 range, and the portions were NOT large.  The portions were actually fine for lunch, not overly filling (by any stretch of the imagination), but they didn't leave you hungry.\n\nI can't speak for the salmon, as I have NEVER had salmon in any form other than lox that didn't taste like a dried sawdust version of some strong fish. She seemed to enjoy it very much, so there it is.\n\nThe Farm Lamb mac n cheese was tasty. The lamb was tender and moist, and the mac n cheese was a tiny tube pasta with a very nice creamy cheesy sauce, all topped with a bread crumb covering when it was broiled until crispy.  It was accompanied by a 'pinch' of mesclun salad topped with another pinch of fried onions.\n\nBasically - take one large spoonful of mac n cheese with a higher end cheese sauce and a fancier noodle than comes in the average box - mix in about four cubes of roast lamb, sprinkle on a layer of bread crumbs and toss it in the broiler until the crumbs are toasted - then using your index finger and thumb, pick up a pinch of mesclun and sit it on the plate next to the mac n cheese bowl - and you have a bistroid expensive art project on a plate.\n\nSeriously? $15 for lunch? It's mac n cheese people!\n\nI also have to call into question the name and theme.  Mad Mex is bistroid Tex Mex.  Soba is bistroid Asian.  Kaya is bistroid Caribbean-ish.  Casbah? Farm Lamb mac n cheese? Sure, I can see this as a box lunch while riding a camel through the desert...not.\n\nI can't say the experience was awful. The company was awesome, and we had a nice unpressured amount of time for fun chat.  The atmosphere was comfortable, and the food was tasty.  But was it all worthy of a return trip or recommendation?  I honestly can't say 'yes' with any kind of cheerleader rave.  \n\nI'm not quite sure that I comprehend the mindset of people in this burgh who think paying that kind of money for food is worth it, when honestly, food with just as much flavor can be found in abundance around town for half the price and twice the portion. \n\nWho are all of these easily dupe-able rich people, and where do they come from? Want to blow that kind of money? Get out your check book and let me give you my address!",3
833,"I'm actually giving it 3.5 stars.  3 for the appetizers and 4 for the entrees.  My wife and I went to Casbah for the first time.  As we usually do, we decided to share our entrees (TIP - you can get half portion sizes of the pastas!!) and augment the meal with a few appetizers.  For the appetizers, we got the chickpea flatbread, the arugula salad and the sea scallops.  The flatbread and salad were just OK.  The sea scallops would have been delicious except for the \""cured egg yolk\"" which was infused in the avacado sauce.  For those who have never tried a cured egg yolk, I would consider yourself lucky.  Actually, the taste wasn't too bad.  The smell, however, reminded me of what you would smell if you were on the set of a nasty version of a Hoarders TV episode.  Must be an acquired taste.\n\nFor the main course, we chose the short rib ravioli and the cavatelli.  Both were excellent, especially the ravioli.  No complaints at all.\n\nOverall, a very pleasant experience.  Good atmosphere.  Our waitress was very friendly.  The place was busy and had a nice vibe to it.  Unfortunately, some of the food was a slight disappointment.",3
834,"Hard to remember another restaurant that hit home runs from start to finish.  Yinzes say it's pricey but I disagree, the quality is hard to find period.  Very progressive menu but not too wild, products are from near area farms, very knowledgable staff.  And butter served at the right temperature, that's a novel idea!  Just a great experience, can't wait to get back there.",5
835,"Service is a little slow but overall the best food I've had in Pittsburgh so far. If you're a seafood fan, the scallops are amazing. Very decent wine list and lots of parking.",4
836,"casbah is the last big burrito restaurant i had left to try and i really liked it. i started with the sangria to drink which was delicious, and i'm usually not a huge fan of sweet drinks like that. we split the grilled flatbread app. the dips weren't anything super special, but the bread was thick and flavorful. no complaints. then we both got piccola gusta and split all our items. (the piccola gusta gives you salad or soup, half a sandwich, and half a pasta) between the two of us we had the tomato & basil bisque, arugula salad, crab cake sandwich, salumi sandwich, orecchiette pasta, and ricotta cavatelli.\ni'm not a big fan of tomato soup, in fact, i never eat it, but i tried the bisque and loved it. it tasted more like a tomato sauce than soup. the arugula salad was great as well. the crab cake sandwich was really small but good, and the salumi sandwich was amazing... probably my favorite part of the meal. both pastas were good, but i personally preferred the orecchiette, the cranberries sealed the deal for me.\ni love the atmosphere, we sat out on the covered patio, and the service was great as well.\ni'll definitely be back again, hopefully to try the different brunch and dinner menus!",5
837,"Casbah is definitely my favorite restaurant in P-burgh; in fact, usually when I go somewhere else I wind up regretting that I didn't just go to Casbah. Every dish I've had has been excellent; some favorites are the sheep's milk gnudi, tuna tartare, arugala salad, bread pudding, and pretty much every soup. The short rib ravioli is a must have although arguably a touch salty. The menu is so inventive!",5
838,"My wife and I go to Casbah every year for my birthday. It is my favorite of the Big  Burrito restaurants, and they have a birthday deal for $30 off an entree. \n\nThis time I started with the Parsnip & Chestnut Soup, garnished with braised chicken, arugula & almond pesto. It was divine, with the rich sweetness for which parsnips are noted. My main course was Elysian Fields Farm Lamb Loin with flageolet beans, merguez sausage, turnips, greens and whole grain mustard. It was cooked perfectly pink, as ordered, and the flavors complemented each other.\n\nFor dessert, I skipped my usual chocolate - they offered Chocolate Mousse, Chocolate Cheesecake and Dark Chocolate Raspberry Bread Pudding. I decided to try the Pumpkin Bread with Butter Rum Sauce and Cream Cheese Ice Cream.  The cake was light and tasty and the ice cream and sauce were excellent.",5
839,"Glad to see that the Big Burrito restaurants are alive and well in Pittsburgh, and dinner tonight was my first time in awhile at one of their establishments.\n\nBit of a complex review.  My biggest gripe with Casbah is that it's Casbah Mediterranean when the menu (at least on this night, but I don't think it changes all that much) offers very authentic Mediterranean dishes.  One lamb dish (not overly Mediterranean) and no couscous or tagine, which are major staples of Mediterranean cuisine.  Even a side of hummus and pita or veggies would be nice.  Nonetheless, the menu has lots of fine options, just none that I've seen in a typical Mediterranean joint.  I think it's a little misleading especially if you're seeking Mediterranean cuisine.\n\nWe sampled several of the cocktails, all of which were creative and well priced.  As for food, we split the bruschetta (prosciutto and blue cheese), meatballs (pork) and the brussel sprouts were quite tasty, beet salad, and the potato gnocchi. So lots of food!  All was freshly prepared with quality ingredients and served with sophisticated presentation.\n\nLots of fine restaurants opening in the area, but it's clear to see that they have a loyal following.",3
840,"When scoping around online for a good NYE dinner destination for my husband and me, Casbah's prix fixe menu really jumped off the page! Since the Big Burrito group is so popular, I was happy to get reservations, especially since a lot of times were already booked.\n\nThe hubby and I arrived a few minutes early for dinner. I had planned additional time to park and was delightfully reminded that Big Burrito restaurants have free valet parking -- so great, especially with slushy snow on the ground! Even though we were a few minutes early, the hostess took our coats and seated us immediately.  \n\nService was extremely attentive from start to finish. Waters were re-filled quickly. Bread was brought to the table almost immediately and we were offered another basket as soon as we finished the first. The bread came with a delicious spread - was it goat cheese? - that I just couldn't stop eating. Silverware whisked away with each course was promptly replaced.\n\nWe ordered both the land and sea courses to share so we could try the entire NYE prix fixe menu. None of the eight dishes disappointed! The first courses were Sea Scallops & Octopus and Duck Confit. The sea scallop was perfectly cooked, the octopus - thought not my cup of tea! - was also well cooked, and the balsamic flavor in the dish was very tasty. I absolutely loved the duck confit dish. It was served with mustard greens and fruit with a to-die-for dressing - a delicious combination!\n\nThe second courses were Potato Gnocchi and Mushroom Tortelloni. The gnocchi was served with lobster, which was a unique but nice paring. Though a strongly flavored dish, the tortelloni was delicious, and I enjoyed another unique paring, tortelloni with chunks of beef short rib.\n\nLake Ontario Walleye and Roasted Veal Strip Loin were the third courses. Both were cooked to perfection. The walleye's skin was perfectly crispy, and the veal strip loin was cooked medium well but was still deliciously juicy and tender. However, a component of each dish was disappointing -- a mustard flavor in the walleye and pickled mustard seeds covering the veal. I really can't hold this against Casbah though. I'm just not a fan of mustard!\n\nFinally, the desserts was fantastic! The Chocolate Ganache Tart was the ending of the sea courses. The chocolate was strong, even a little bitter, and was served with a little champagne strawberry compote. I grew more accustomed to the bitterness with each bite, and it was the perfect ending to three courses filled with fish. A Caramel Macaroon completed the land courses. The macaroon was delicious and served with a little apple sorbet and caramel sauce.\n\nOur experience at Casbah was spectacular! Based on this experience, I debated giving the restaurant five stars... but decided to wait until I returned a second time. And I can't wait to return!",4
841,"Brunch = best in the burgh.  Hands down.  Best. eggs. ever. I am not even sure how the eggs can be that good.  I know what you are saying, \""They are eggs, Jessica.  Get a grip.\""  No.  I will not.  I cannot.  I want to stand on top of rooftops and shout my love for these eggs all over town.  \n\nJ, H and I went there a few Sundays ago.  We all got the same thing. When was the last time you went to a meal and all three people ordered the same thing.  It was that good.  The scallop breakfast is out of this world.  2 perfectly cooked scallops, scrambled eggs (the eggs!!!), the creamiest, tastiest grits in the world, buttery croissant and sausage, apples and butternut squash.  Don't think those things go together?  They do and are awesome!  J and I also both got orders of bacon cause no brunch is complete without bacon.  \n\nOur service was also great.  Nice hostess, awesome waiter.  All was perfect.  \n\nReally freaking good brunch.  Really.  Cannot say enough about those freaking eggs.  \n\nOh, but don't order an additional mimosa from the deal - they are $8 a piece which is a bit steep.",5
842,- Great food. I had the Gerber's Amish Farm Chicken Breast and it was cooked perfectly and delicious =]\n- Nice wine selection. Though I'm a beer guy.\n- Friendly staff.\n- Okay atmosphere.\n\nThis place is definitely worth trying. Will be back for seconds!,4
843,"Hey do I really need to review this place? Look at the previous reviews but I will let you know that they have a great lunch deal, the piccolo gusto menu. I highly recommend it because it is a heck of a deal and you can have tastes of a few different items so it pairs well with my self diagnosis of A.D.D. no offense to anyone who has A.D.D but it definitely kept my attention throughout my lunch experience. First off the service was excellent very attentive server who was really a foodie, which I really appreciated. She knew a heck of a lot about the seemingly simple dishes I had ordered. The Piccolo Forno allows for a choice of Salad or soup, a pasta or risotto, half sandwich. I went with a taste of the Pea Tendrils and Frisee Salad, while slightly complex to eat, it had a savory flavor from the light dressing and blue cheese crumbles, then I went with cauliflower risotto which was riculous. That is how you make risotto people. For the half samich I went with the half turkey. The turkey wasn't just a normal turkey slice from the deli counter this was actually very nicely trimmed meat off of a bird that was prepared in house and it was immediately noticeable. All this for $15 dollars, I'll take it....And I'll do it again many times over again. Come here for lunch sometime and check it for yourself.",4
844,"Good food, great service, but high prices.\n\nMy date and I shared 2 appetizers, a salad and each had an entree with the recommended wine pairings. Bill was $115 without tax--pricey by my standards for this experience. The new tuna tartare appetizer was the highlight of our night. The bruschetta with fig and grape butter, prosciutto and blue cheese was good, so was the beet salad.\n\nWe were disappointed with our entrees. My roasted duck breast with spinach and gnocchi was not hot. My date had the salmon with potato fennel puree, which she said tasted fishy.\n\nMake sure you aren't seated inside the tent where patrons are eating on a slope on outdoor metal tables--this is not my idea of a good dinner at this price range.\n\nAlthough I would come here again, there are certainly much better restaurants in the city. I would rank Casbah below Eleven within the Big Burrito group of restaurants.",2
845,"Not a good vegan experience.  We were meeting friends at Casbah for dinner -their choice.  Since I follow a version of vegan, I called ahead and was assured that they had vegan versions of a couple of pasta dishes.  Server was very cooperative and said she would instruct the kitchen to omit the meat and  increase the veggies on their cavatelli.   Well, they omitted the meat, but I was left with one of the smallest servings of pasta that I have ever seen.  At about $20, it was close to the price of caviar!",1
846,"Love this place. I've never had anything that wasn't tasty here. They do fish and meat very well. It's not obscure molecular gastronomy style, but dishes we have had here were all well prepared and savory. We have been to several business dinners in their space downstairs, and it really is my favorite place for these - even more than the pricier steakhouses 'dahntahn.'\n\nWait staff were very attentive, and really made our experiences here great. Food was served efficiently for large groups, and arrived at the correct temperature. They have a great wine list, and overall offer a comfortable space with delicious food and drinks. Try the lamb loin, chicken, and cioppino - my three current favorites. Their pork chops are the specialty of the house, I'm told.\n\nWill definitely be back.",4
847,Oh I love this place.  It has a great menu and wine list.  It has all the great dishes with a touch of flare.  I took this meal to seafood town from start to finish and have no regrets.  The staff was really friendly - realized I was there for a special occasion and brought out a desert that said congratulations - the little things.\n\nWe dined outside and I felt tucked away in a Europe-esque atmosphere for a few hours.\n\nIt is worth reserving a spot on the patio to get the full experience.,5
848,A delicious menu with a twist. Unique wine list too!,4
849,"Though Casbah has been around for ages this was our first time dining there. In short, the restaurant itself was nice and the food interesting though a little on the pricey side. Service started out great but for some reason our entrees took forever and our waiter more or less abandoned us. If I'm spending a $150 on dinner for 2 I expect some sort of explanation on why we are having to wait 45 minutes plus between our appetizer and the entrees. At a minimum, I don't want to have to flag down the server to order another drink and for god's sake don't make me ask for a refill of my water.  If I was only basing my decision on food I'd probably go back but all things considered there are too many other restaurants in Pittsburgh where I can get amazing food AND an amazing dining experience.",2
850,Love Casbah.  Been going there for years and have never had a less than great meal and service.  OF course their signature lamb is to die for (with the Stag's Leap Petite Syrah).  What can I say -- the cheese plate is great.  Everything is well-prepared and the service is among the best in the -burgh.,5
851,"Casbah is fast becoming my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. I have been there twice now and both times the service and food was impeccable. \n\nThe calamari and the proscuitto appetizer are a great start to the meal and not too heavy or filling and I could eat a whole basket of the warm bread. I'd love to know where they get it from as I can't imagine they bake it there, but maybe they do! \n\nThe pork chop is their signature dish and does not disappoint. My husband had the duck the last time we were there and it was juicy on the inside and had a great crispy skin. I had the red pepper casereccia and was thrilled with the amount of seafood in the dish. There were 4 HUGE, delicious scallops and a ton of lump crab. Very impressive. I was there with a group of 6 this time and everyone had clean plates at the end of the meal. \n\nI like the fact that it seems like the menu changes with the seasons. The proteins may stay static, but since they use a lot of local ingredients, the accompaniments/side dishes might be different every time you come. Honestly, this is one of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh. I plan on trying it for brunch or lunch sometime soon.",5
852,"My absolutely favorite dish is the potato gnocchi. Just amazing! Service is fantastic, nice decor. I wish they wouldn't use such huge paper towels in the bathroom, but other than that I really like this place.",5
853,"Tonight's review: it started with a table for two stuffed between two other tables. Yes there were five other more comfortable two tops available. We asked and after some sighs were granted our seemingly offensive request. Punishment was fast...we sipped our water, were provided a refill but no offer to acquire other beverages. With plenty of time to review the night's menu, we made our selection. My request was well done Salmon (heart issues require well done) the chef's feelings were clear; as I sawed through the salmon I thought it could possibly be a message. I again had offended by my request. I like Casbah and the other BB restaurants but tonight I should have selected a friendlier more customer focused establishment. YES I will return and still recommend Casbah. Oh we did finally get to place a cocktail order.  \nM",2
854,"Visited for brunch again on a rainy winter Sunday.  I reaffirm my previous comments.\n\nGood service.  Generally great food (the breakfast pastries, my breakfast polenta and the wife's scallops were fantastic), however inconsistencies still prevent the 5-star praise.\n\nWhile the coffee is great, the crud in the creamer and a dirty spoon to start the meal off were not.  In addition, I may have had one of the most bi-polar plates of my life...  braised lamb on grilled sourdough.  The lamb itself was kiss-yo-mama good...  seriously, this meat is a fork cutting affair.  However, the bread itself seemed stale and completely took away from the star in the spot light.\n\nAs with Eleven, you can't go wrong with the brunch pre-fix, so be prepared to need a wheel barrel to get yourself out the door!",4
855,"I recently realized that I had only given Casbah four stars after my first visit here for New Year's Eve 2012... What a terrible judgment call that was on my part. So I'm back to proclaim that over a year later - having dined here again in 2013 - with a year of dining experiences across the country -  I still regularly dream of this restaurant. Do I dare say it's my favorite restaurant? I'm not sure, but if it's not my favorite, it's certainly close.\n\nWe returned after NYE last year to celebrate my birthday in March, making sure to bring along the oh-so-coveted Big Burrito birthday coupon. I ordered the Orecchiette with Chicken, Cranberries, Goat Cheese & Sage Cream. Oh. My. Goodness. Don't order this if you're on a diet... but order this if you love delicious food and living life to the fullest. It was ridiculously creamy, and the cranberries packed the perfect fruity balance to the rich dish. My husband ordered the Double-Cut Pork Chop with Kale & Butternut Squash Risotto. While recently dining at a highly rated restaurant in NYC, he said, \""My double-cut pork chop at Casbah was better than this double-cut pork chop.\"" That's when I knew that I needed to update my review of Casbah.\n\nFinally, my delicious birthday dinner ended with the Dark Chocolate-Raspberry Bread Pudding. I love ordering bread pudding at restaurants, and I think this is the best of them all. I would confidently enter this dessert in a bread pudding competition, knowing that I would be walking away with the blue ribbon.",5
856,"I have a soft spot for this place -- probably because it is one of the first restaurants my fiance ever took me to, and he made a special night out of it. We've been back many times, for many occasions, and Casbah has never disappointed. Great wine, cocktails, food, service, and atmosphere. It can be a little more cramped on the inside, but it's never too loud. If you can sit outside, it feels nice and spacious. It's also very nice downstairs.\n\nThe valet parking is a huge plus in my book, especially in that area of Shadyside. The service is always prompt and never overbearing. \n\nThe last time we went, we had the sheep's milk gnudi and I'm pretty sure it was sent straight from heaven down on to our plate. I nearly fought my fiance for the last piece. He loves me so he let me have it. The swordfish was wonderful. The lamb is always great. The short rib ravioli melts in your mouth. I'd highly recommend any of those.\n\nThe dark chocolate raspberry bread pudding is worth unbuttoning your pants for...and if you like dessert wines, you'll be in heaven for sure!",5
857,"I am definitely the salt queen.  I literally salt everything from pizza, McDonalds French Fries (even though I know that they already have tons of salt on them).  I also salt ham and processed foods.   I always salt food before even tasting it.  Nothing is off limits when it comes to me and my salt shaker.\n\nWell when my beautiful meal arrived I asked my server for the salt.  None of the tables had salt or pepper shakers on them.  As my server went to get me the salt shaker, I took a bite of my potatoes.  Whoa!!!!!  They were extremely salty!!!!   For the first time in my life,  I didn't add any additional salt to my meal.  For me to say something is \""very\"" salty.... It is very salty. \n\nBeing the salt queen,  I stll  was able to enjoy and love my meal.  I am almost guarantee that the average person would not have enjoyed this food..  My friend also tasted my meal and immediately noticed the heavy taste of salt.  However he never salts anything so something with one grain of salt on it, he will be about to tell.  \n\nIt really suprised me that such an upscaled restaurant would have this much salt added to their food.  I am sure that it was an error or something.  I have eaten here in the past and never experience so much salt.\n\nStill my meal \""for me\"" was delicious.  For the first time in my life, I am glad that I did not add any salt to my meal.\n\n  I do love Casbah alot.  It is probably my second favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh.",4
858,"Best \""Babaganoush\"" we've had since we visited Egypt.\nThe gaspacho soup was fantastic, and since my husband wouldn't share his short rib ravioli, I can only assume they were suburb also. \nThe atmosphere was a tad basic, but it was also different and therefore interesting and enjoyable.",5
859,"The food here was absolute perfection; each bite was perfectly orchestrated to deliver optimal flavor and enjoyment. The service was also fantastic!\n\nFor my entree, I had the cioppino -- it may be one of the best that I've ever had. The bowl was filled with beautiful looking seafood: large shrimp, clams in their shells, mussels in their shells, a gorgeous piece of perfectly seasoned halibut, and enormous wonderfully cooked scallops. They knew how to cook each piece of seafood to showcase it well. And the charred sourdough served with the cioppino was the perfect complement to soak up all of the delicious, savory flavors of the broth without becoming a soggy mush! My grandfather had the halibut and loved it... Cleaned the plate!\n\nI had heard rave reviews of the dark chocolate raspberry bread pudding, so we had to share one for dessert! My grandfather said it was incomparable to any bread pudding; it was a sweet, smooth, decadent indulgence that paired well with the house coffee.\n\nAnd the complementary salted caramels presented with the check were also amazing! I definitely need to come back again to try more of the menu... I think only wonderful items could possibly come out of that kitchen!",5
860,"Made a reservation on opentable for Friday at 6pm.  It wasn't packed at all but the hostess decided to sit us outside without asking where we'd prefer to sit. It was really hot that day so it was pretty uncomfortable. \n\nI immediately noticed that a lot of CMU undergrads worked there. While I was dining there I saw 3 CMU classmates. \n\nI started off with the gazpacho and it was very tasty. We were also given some bread with a lavender goat cheese spread. The spread was ok. \n\nFor the entrees I got the roasted pepper cavereccia that had crab in it and ricotta cavatelli with sausage.\n\nFor the cavereccia I thought there was going to be big chunks of crab but I was disappointed to see that the crab was shredded into small pieces. The pasta was a little undercooked and the sauce was ok.\n\nThe cavatelli was extremely oily. The more you ate it the more you saw the pool of oil it was swimming in. I had to wipe some of the oil off the pasta. \n\nLastly I had the dark chocolate raspberry bread pudding. It was pretty good but I wish there were more raspberries in it. \n\nService was pretty good and the decor outside was nice, although, it got really stuffy in the outdoor tent. \n\nThis place is pretty expensive and based on the food I wouldn't go back for that price.",2
861,"I took my boyfriend to Casbah at the end of September for his birthday. We were seated near the door for our reservation however it was a very warm night so it was nice to sit in an open air setting. Our server, her name has slipped my mind, was excellent. I am not a fan of red wines but my boyfriend is and it being his birthday, of course I said let's get a bottle of red. We explained to our server what white varietals I enjoy and she suggested a bottle (which has also slipped my mind being months ago that we were there)that was perfect-both of us enjoyed it. We started off with the papardelle. The rabbit was delicious and it was perfectly seasoned, perfectly cooked-the flavors were amazing together! For entrees, my boyfriend ordered the duck and I ordered the short rib ravioli. His words to describe the duck were \""life changing\"". I was only able to taste a small piece of his since he ate it so quickly, but I agree it was excellent. The short rib was so tender and juicy. I was concerned it would be overly salty and it was not. It was the best ravioli I have eaten hands down! For dessert, we ordered a cheese tasting. It was the perfect way to end our meal-with the cheese tasting and a glass of wine. I can't wait to go back to Casbah and sample some other items-I would have ordered the entire menu on our first visit if I could have!",5
862,"This might be the best food I've had in Pittsburgh.\n\nThe restaurant set up is a little odd in that there is a tented outdoor space that you walk through to get to the hostess stand. The hostess stand is located in the indoor space. We were seated in the outdoor section in a corner which was fairly drafty. This is the only negative point I have about the meal.\n\nWe ordered the cheese  tasting menu, the duck, the scallop pasta, and the lemon sponge cake. Each bite was perfect -- flavorful and expertly cooked. The waiter was friendly and knowledgable. We left feeling full and happy.",4
863,"This update is for Casbah's brunch.\n\nAlright, Casbah. You got me, you got me good. Dinner as I mentioned before was decent, but the brunch, amazing. Compared to dinner, brunch at Casbah is definitely the better meal and deal. I don't advocate playing favorites when it comes to siblings in the same family, but sometimes you can't help it. Brother Brunch gets the nod here.\n\nBrunch is basically a fixed set. For $28, you choose an adult beverage (or non-alcoholic), an appetizer, and an entree. They start you off with some pistachio scones, buttermilk biscuits, and cornbread. Perfect, I like to stretch before I get my grub on. For my Prix-Fixe (fixed set), I went with the mimosa, smoked salmon, and sea scallop fry. \n\nSMOKED SALMON: If you like smoked salmon, then you would enjoy this appetizer. It's what you would expect but also a larger size than I thought it would be! \""Oh no, there's too much of something I like,\"" said nobody ever. Upon seeing the smoked salmon display fanned out on its plate with bits of egg, red onion, and aioli garnished over top, my salivary glands couldn't control themselves! \n\nSEA SCALLOP FRY: You know I love me some scallops. The dish came with two scallops, a small croissant, small bits of fennel sausage, a side of white corn grits, and a little bit of butternut squash and caramelized onions. I was tempted to go with the classic eggs/toast/waffle as an entree, but I am so glad I put on my big boy foodie stretchy pants and took a chance. It's not your typical brunch dish and it's one I would definitely recommend. \n\nAll in all, fantastic brunch experience. Definitely felt comfortably full, but not in a self-hatred, \""I-regret-this-decision-immediately\"" kind of way. Service was professional; our waitress kept the waters filled and came in to check on us a little after each dish was served.",5
864,"While I have always had a great experience with my food, I feel the need to update my prior review based on my experience at brunch today.  \n\nWhen my food came out, there was a very visible hair on my plate. I was with a large group and did not want to make a scene, so I mentioned it to the server who immediately took my plate away. The manager on duty came out to apologize, which I did appreciate. However, I was a little surprised because when they brought my plate out about 5 minutes later, I could tell that it was the same exact plate. \n\nFirst off, it was not even warm, so if they made my meal on the spot you would think it would be hot, or at the very least warm. I had also substituted bacon for the sausage that normally comes with the entree, and if the chef had made a new plate on the spot, he would probably have sent it out with the sausage (or with a side of bacon again), which he did not (they had served my bacon on the side when they brought it out initially).     Everything was in the exact same place on the plate. I wasn't going to cause a scene, so I pretended to enjoy it, but did not. I was quite repulsed.\n\nin my last review I had said that Casbah was my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. I had mentioned that the Cassericia dish was my favorite but that they had removed it from the menu the last time I tried to order it there for dinner. I received a response from someone at the restaurant that she was not sure why I would think that because it is still offered, and I explained that the waiter told me it was removed from the menu. \n\nI'm not really sure what happened here, but I can tell you this... I don't think that Casbah is my favorite anymore. In fact not only is it not my favorite, it has taken a plunge to the bottom of my list of places to eat. \n\nFor me, if you expect to eat at a top restaurant, the service should be top of the line, and it has just been too inconsistent for my taste. No thanks Casbah!",2
865,"Let me say that my five stars are based primarily on the calamari appetizer ... it is SOOO good! The squid was very lightly battered and fried so briefly that it was tender and delicious. Seriously, it was one of the best I've eaten, and I've made it a point of sampling calamari. The entrees (short rib ravioli and cavatelli) were very good, too. As for the Carrot Cob for dessert, forget it. It only detracts from the otherwise wonderful meal.",5
866,"Upon receipt of the much-coveted Big Burrito birthday voucher, I had to make the tough decision about which of their restaurants to visit.  I was torn between Casbah and Eleven, but upon perusing the menus, reading reviews, and giving the matter much thought, I settled on Casbah.  I knew I'd made a good decision when I invited some friends to join me, and they said that, based on their past experience, I'd made an excellent choice!\n\nOur meal started off with a few slices of bread, which came with butter and a Greek yogurt spread.  The butter was good, but the yogurt spread was amazing, and both of them dressed up the bread very well.  We then ordered an appetizer of the bruschetta, which was not your normal bruschetta, but was delicious.  I'm not entirely sure of the ingredients, since what we received doesn't match the menu description posted on the website, but one notable thing about it was that it had some pomegranate seeds that gave it a subtle sweetness and juiciness, complementing the other savory ingredients.  For my entree, I ordered the orecchiette, a dish consisting of ear-shaped pasta tossed in a goat cheese and sage cream sauce, with chicken and dried cranberries.  Flavorwise, this was one of the most well-balanced dishes I've ever eaten, with the savory ingredients and sweet hints from the cranberries (which were actual cranberries, rather than craisins, as I'd imagined) melding together in perfect culinary harmony.  The pasta was also cooked to a perfect al dente firmness, which held up well in the microwave several days later when I ate the leftovers.  The cranberry-lime dry soda that I ordered to go with this entree complemented it very nicely, and was a great alternative to wine (while I was tempted, I didn't order any since my dining companions decided not to, due to having driven).\n\nMy two dining companions ordered the Scottish salmon and the gnocchi, respectively.  Based on the samples that they provided me, Casbah did a great job on these dishes, as well!  The salmon had a subtle saltiness that complemented the flavor nicely, without overpowering it.  My friend who ordered it had had it before at Casbah, but had since been to Scotland, and he said that it was very similar in quality and taste to the versions of this dish that he'd tried there.  The gnocchi was one of the most unique and varied dishes I've encountered, and, based on the two bites that I tried, brought the ingredients together in a medley of flavors and textures.  I think my friend who ordered it described it best by saying that every bite was a bit different, but that they were all delicious!  Although all of us tried bites of each other's dishes, we each liked our own choice best, so we chose well.\n\nAfter our entrees, we decided to order dessert.  Although I was tempted by the dark chocolate raspberry bread pudding, since many reviewers speak highly of it, I decided to follow my instinct and get the chocolate-hazelnut bomba.  I'm so glad that I did, since this dessert was amazing!  If you like dark chocolatey, torte-like desserts or Nutella, this dessert is a must-try. Since I mentioned I was at Casbah for a birthday dinner, the dessert was served with \""Happy birthday\"" written on the plate in chocolate icing, which was a nice touch.  My dining partners ordered the creme brulee to split between themselves, which came topped with an apple compote.  Based on the bite that I tried, it was a good rendition of a brulee, but couldn't match the star power of the chocolate bomba.\n\nWe visited at 7:30pm last Sun., at the later end of their serving hours, but service from our waiter, Brian, was very good.  We were seated in the tent-like area in the front of the restaurant, which stayed surprisingly warm during most of our visit.  At one point before dessert, upon returning from the restroom, I noticed that it'd cooled off, but the manager came out to turn on the heating elements, and it warmed back up in less than 10 min.\n\nIn sum, if you're looking for a solid fine dining experience with innovative, delicious food, Casbah is a great choice.  The food was impressive in its quality, and the service was what I've come to expect at a higher-end restaurant.  I'd particularly recommend getting on the Big Burrito mailing list to receive a $30 birthday voucher and $10 off coupons for the holidays, and taking advantage of one of these occasions to try it.  I'm certain that you'll be as pleased with your experience there as me and my dining partners!",5
867,"Three strikes and you're out!  We had brunch there a few months back, and the meal was so salty that we could barely begin to eat it.  That meal was comped and I figured it was an off day.  We went back about a month later for dinner, and that meal was also very salty and we could not finish it.  We were willing to try again, so we went for dinner tonight.  I ordered the filet, and it was like eating a salt shaker.  I was shocked that, for a third time, I had a piss poor meal at Casbah.  I sent that back, and ordered the sea bass.  When I got to the end of the piece of fish, it was raw.  Needless to say, I will NEVER return to this restaurant.  Looking back, what should I have expected from the sister restaurant of Mad Mex?",1
868,Casbah continues to be my favorite Pittsburgh restaurant. High quality service and creative dishes. Sign up for mailers for Big Burrito special offers and birthday discount.  \n\nMust try:\nCalamari\nCheese plate\nShort Rib Ravioli\nPork Chop\nWatermelon Gin Fizz,5
869,"Mixed results.  Made a reservation and we were seated in a dark corner at a tiny table. Is the money from having that table worth the negative experience guests will receive? Methinks not.  I had to ask to be moved to the patio, which was much better.\n\nThe drinks we ordered from the bar were watery (the Manhattan and some drink with applejack in it). Later, they made a mistake and sent us the wrong cocktail, which turned out to be much better than the ones we wanted. \n\nAppetizers (meatballs with Brussels sprouts and beet salad) were very good, but the main courses left a lot to be desired in terms of seasoning.  The texture of the short rib in the ravioli wasn't quite right, sort of dry, maybe overcooked.  We had a bread pudding for dessert, which was probably the best part of the meal. I expect a better overall experience for the money.",3
870,"Though I didn't get a chance to visit this place when I visited last month, I really do love Quiet Storm and I will be sure I hit it up next time I'm in town visiting my friends there. The decor is adorable. The prices are reasonable. It was an intimate place to see a show and it's too bad they are no longer doing them here. I really feel like this place was one of the first things that made me heart Pittsburgh. It's truly a unique space.",4
871,"I used to live about four blocks from the Quiet Storm, and for a period breakfast here was an every day affair.  Those two facts have nothing to do with each other--the period in question was close to the end of the first semester of my (super-)senior year, when my friends and I would stay in our studios all night working, haul ass out to Quiet Storm for ambrosia-caliber restorative tofu scramble and coffee, and go back to school bright-eyed and bushy-tailed for another day of class.  And then usually I'd take a three-hour nap after the first class.  But I'm sorry, what is it I'm reviewing here?\n\nThe Quiet Storm has absolutely the best tofu scramble I've ever had.  I'm an accomplished vegan eater (I get stuff in my mouth first try nine times out of ten), I've had the best scrambles New York and San Francisco have to offer.  Believe you me, Quiet Storm tops them all.  I wish I knew their secret recipe, but the part I do know--baking the tofu rather than just sauteeing it--makes a tremendous difference.  Come in on a lazy Sunday morning, get the Nothin' Fancy, and you will see for yourself just how good tofu can be.  On top of that, they are as vegan-friendly as can be, with earth balance for the toast; soy, rice, and almond milks; and a selection of specifically vegan mixed drinks and milkshakes.  Plus, sandwiches!  Get the spicy spinach and peanut butter wrap, ask for added tofu (planks not crumble), and be astonished yet again.\n\nAND AND, as a delicious cherry on top, they have theme brunches, fantastic theme brunches that show off the creativity and chops of the cooks here in a way that the regular menu can only hint at.  Check out their website and see when the next theme brunch is, and make a point of going.  Get there early.",5
872,Wondering where the Pittsburgh hipster crowd hangs out? Look no further than the fixie parked outside the Quiet Storm. \n\nAnd then go inside and have some delicious food and drink.,4
873,"This place is cool!  But it is also 'cool'.  Service is so-so, but the staff doesn't have an attitude, they just aren't into serving.  And I'm not a vegan, but the food is so good that a carnivore like me doesn't even care. The menu is also huge.  \n\nFor those of you looking for an ATM- there's one a half block away if you just exit, go left and cross the street to the corer convenience store.\n\nI could always find a table and spread out with my books. Comfy, young, hip, worth it.  I wish they had alcohol.\n\nTry it!",4
874,"It's good when they are on, but they are so inconsistent you never know what you are going to get.  The coffee machine looks like it hasn't been cleaned in the last century which is off putting.  Generally, I wouldn't recommend it unless you are in the neighborhood and desperately hungry--you MIGHT catch a lucky break and be there on a good day.",2
875,"Food is tasty, though portions are for the waifish hipster types. Location is inconvenient and I would not recommend people walking by themselves at night on that stretch of Penn. Service is very uneven i.e. bad, even when the place is practically dead. I can't really speak on the coffee, though they do have good tissanes(however getting them to refill your hot water is another thing).\n\n**************\nOkay I won't change my rating, but I take back what I said about the food. They have changed the menu and it is really bad. \n\nWe had Buffalo Tofu sticks which were ridiculously dry. \n\nI had the Thai Peanut Tofu Wrap which tasted just like peanut butter. \n\nI don't understand the point of Mockamole? It's made with peas instead of avocado. \n\nHow to describe the food... it's as if they took pictures of how food should look and made the food without thinking about how food should taste. Gee peas are green, just like avocados?? \n\nI would go there for coffee/tea or whatever to hang out, but not for the food. \n\nOkay there was one decent thing on the menu which was the artichoke dip. I was completely disappointed.",3

877,"CASH ONLY!!!  What a pleasant surprise!  I went here for the first time last night and wasn't sure what to expect when i walked in.  The place seems to have some spacial issues.  There was a bar but they don't serve alcohol, more of a coffee/diner bar.  The tables and chairs seem odd and it took me a while to find a chair that was comfortable, but maybe this is by design.  I am not a coffee expert but i really enjoyed my several cups of decaf.  Anyhoo, to the food.  This place is vegetarian only.   I started with a Hummus plate, unlike most creamy hummuses this hummus was gritty as i could actually taste the chick peas with each bite.  The hummus was surrounded by fresh crisp cucumbers, carrots, celery, calamata olives (big fan) and pita. Perfect starter.  For my main entree i ordered the curry special.  Do not expect an Indian food experience but this will not disappoint.   Everything was in the bowl, chick peas, basmanti rice, carrots, and other miscellaneous items.  Once i started dipping my pita into it I could not stop.  It was savory, spicy and just the perfect compliment to the cold snowy night.    This is one storm i will enjoy braving from time to time.",5
878,"Quiet Storm is, perhaps, the most expensive vegetarian diner I have ever been to, even by big city standards! Cash-only makes this even more difficult. Tofu wings appetizer was simply not very good; and I usually love these things! I tried the gyro wrap which was also a big disappointment. As far as I know, gyros are supposed to be pretty meaty, but this was mostly lettuce with sporadic chunks of seitan and cucumber,along  with dreaded diced unripe tomato. The wrap was dry and upon looking at the menu again, I see that the sauce that it probably requires costs an extra $.50. The tortilla itself was very white and seemingly unnatural compared to those found at most veggie establishments. My beverage was good and affordable--ginger lemonade. It was sweet for my tastes, but I am sure most people would have thought it perfect. I'll keep Quiet Storm in mind as a coffee shop, only.\n\nF.Y.I after splitting the cost of the appetizer with a friend, my lunch cost me $17--ouch! I did have half of the wrap leftover and ate it later as a salad with my own dressing. It was quite good that way and I might recommend that QS rethink the Gyro presentation if they want to continue using so much lettuce.",2
879,"pretty good veggie food.  I've had breakfast, lunch, and dinner here.  French toast, tofu scramble, museli, salads, sandwiches, lasagna.  They have a pretty decent variety.",3
880,"I must be a glutton for punishment, because I keep finding myself hungrily returning to the Quiet Storm. The menu has slightly changed, and they are no longer cash only... This time it was the \""8th Ward\"" that inflicted extreme disappointment. Not sure what 8th Ward is supposed to mean, but I will forever associate it with a dry boring place. And I thought we were getting a party platter! This appetizer sampler included THE WORST hummus evaar; I am near positive that they forgot to add garlic, lemon, salt and tahini to this chickpea paste that which was described as \""garlicky\"" on the menu. Sooo wrong. \""The Butter,\"" another WTF of a name, was also very dry and bland. The salsa was good! And there were plenty of dipping accessories, too many really, given the smallness of the unappetizing dip portions.\n\nAt this point, I've tried most of the vegan options QS has to offer and the only luck I've had has been with the B.Y.O.B. Go figure. \n\nI wouldn't care so much about how much of a tease this place is if I didn't REALLY desire a comfortable neighborhood place to eat comfortable food with a comfortable view of a cute waitress who writes fiction. And it frustrates me that few others seem to recognize the culinary (I shutter at even calling it that) mediocrity of \""the best\"" vegetarian restaurant Pittsburgh has to offer.",1
881,"Well, I think Heidi S. pretty much covered all of the bases here. The lemon-ginger tea that I ordered was weak, perhaps not steeped hot enough? The hummus, wow, definitely the worst; tasted like paste. Yuck with a capital whY. I considered giving two stars because the service and atmosphere were pleasant, but since I do not plan to return, I guess methinks not.",1
882,"i was super excited to try quiet storm when i moved to pittsburgh because all of the reviews i read were fantastic.  however, i have visited multiple times now continuously hoping for improvement and each time i've been disappointed.  let's start with the good things.  QS has a great atmosphere, it definitely helped the transition from austin.  very chill \""hippie\"" vibe.  however, the servers although friendly can  sometimes be a touch \""hippie-elitest\"".  the food was alright.  their homefries were quite tasty but little else has tantalized my taste buds and i have tried many things.  i do love their thai dressing, very yummy on the salads.  will i continue to go back?  probably, wishful thinking is  a good thing.",2
883,"We go here all the time and have ordered almost everything on the menu and never been disappointed. It's veggie diner food at it's best (at least in my opinion). My bf is a meat & potatoes man but he absolutely loves the breakfast  Homefries with tofu instead of eggs. The waitstaff have always been exceptionally nice and very attentive. This establishment is best described as a greasy spoon for vegans and vegetarians so if you go in expecting gourmet, you may find yourself disappointed.\n\nOn cold wintery days try a Mexican Hot Chocolate - it will surely warm your heart!",4
884,"Aw it's places like this that make me love Pittsburgh. Its hodge podge decor and hipster crowd are what drew me here in the first place, but turns out the food and coffee is pretty decent even delicious. Since it's far from where I live I don't get to come here half as often as I'd like but I'm always pleased when I do. \n\nSuch cute boys.",4
885,"This place is so hit-or-miss for me. Sometimes the food is amazing; sometimes it is terrible. Example: I ordered the spicy peanut wrap for the first time and fell in love with it. I came back a couple weeks later, and it was bland and unappetizing. Maybe there is someone who works in the kitchen who doesn't know where the spice rack is-- I don't know.\n\nThe 'waitstaff' is hit-or-miss, too. Sometimes, they're great. Other times, I've waited for ages just for a menu. One guy actually snapped at me for asking for a breakfast item at lunch. \n\nThat said, there are some good dishes, like the Black & Gold. I like that in some dishes you can replace rice with salad. A lot of people I've eaten with here have raved about the quesadillas. There's a nice laid back atmosphere and fun retro diner decor. There's also an extensive (but expensive) drinks menu with milkshakes, teas and coffee drinks, and a nice selection of locally-made vegan sweets and pastries. And I love the magazine and book rack, even though the magazines are usually two years old. Still fun to read.",3
886,"Remember the days of bands in the back at night, and interesting kids hanging out at the bar all day? Well, the bands were the first to go, followed quickly by the comfy sofas. The kids didn't take long to leave, and now, years later, faced with a frankly less-than-appetizing Saturday menu, I find that the ability to substitute something else for the increasing amounts of potato filler is gone, too.\n\nQuiet Storm used to be a straight five star. My last experience was honestly two-star, but nostalgia and history don't allow me to give it less than a three.\n\nI'm sure all the changes over the years have been in the name of efficiency, but they've come at expense to the clientele. Here's hoping Quiet Storm rediscovers the mojo (and the menu) that once made them great.",3
887,"The menu looks awesome and the dish concepts are good except everything that comes out is disappointingly bland. Thank god there were bottles of hot sauce and salt on the table. The best part of the meal was the peanut butter chocolate milk shake. The burger and \""spicy\"" Cajun soup were very mediocre.",2
888,"I'm a vegetarian and have lived behind the restaurant for over 3 years. Every time I have ever gone, the service is awful. It's as if they're doing you a favor by waiting on you. I think their breakfasts are pretty good and their lentil loaf is good but usually your sides consist of yellow nacho chips with brown jalopeno slaw. Also, the cooks look like they are lacking hygeine. the one great thing about this place is their coffee, and that's it.",1
889,"Quiet storm is a really cool vegetarian restaurant. The time I was there the service was fine and the food was unique. Their menu is a limited on the weekdays, your best bet is one of their many quesadillas.\n\nI'm not as concerned about the preservation of vibe and atmosphere, as long as the food still tastes good. I was in love with the pierogidilla and happy to leave the table feeling full without having any meat.\n\nI wrote a review of Quiet Storm on my web site, Binge! http://eatinginpittsburgh.com/2010/07/07/ive-got-an-itch-for-kitsch-quiet-storm-in-bloomfield/",4
890,"We stopped by Quiet Storm for a late lunch while on vacation in Pittsburgh.  The food was excellent.  I had the cheese steak and my husband had a peanut tofu wrap, both were served with chips.  Everything was great.  If I had any complaint it would be that I didn't see on the menu that my cheese steak had mayo on it.  I'm not a big fan of it, so had I see that I would have asked for it without.  Other then that great place!",3
891,"I didn't realize that Quiet Storm was a completely vegetarian restaurant until I noticed the word \""seitan\"" printed after every meat item on the menu. Normally I'd find this annoying, as I'm an unabashed and unapologetic meat eater. That doesn't mean I don't love a good veggie dish, but fake meat masquerading as real meat is one of my pet peeves. If you're going to serve vegetarian food, don't try to pretend it's anything else.\n\nThat grievance having been aired, I ordered the Blackadilla, a quesadilla boasting no false meat items, but stuffed with black beans, basmati rice, sweet potatoes, pineapple and cheddar cheese. It was delicious and filling, and at $8 for the enormous quesadilla and a small house salad, a pretty good deal. \n\nThe menu at Quiet Storm is large, with breakfast and lunch/dinner items as well as an array of cafe drinks and desserts. In spite of the prevalence of seitan and tofu, there are a number of dishes that I look forward to sampling upon return.\n\nAnd I do plan to return. As those of you who have read my other Yelp reviews know, the atmosphere of public places is very important to me, and the atmosphere at Quiet Storm does not disappoint. It's got a retro cool '50s diner vibe and a more modern but equally cool soundtrack that entices customers to stick around. The wait staff encourages this practice, giving diners plenty of space to hang out long after they've finished eating.\n\nThe one downside of Quiet Storm is its location, floating among gas stations and abandoned houses in Garfield, an area sandwiched between the more pedestrian friendly neighborhoods of Bloomfield and East Liberty, but not quickly accessible from either. It has to be a pre-determined destination rather than a drop in for random passersby. But that might just be OK.",4
892,"Daniel Fast friendly restaurant with good food. Stopped for an early supper before Saturday night church service after searching Yelp for vegan restaurant options. Food was good, service was good, price was very reasonable. Think I just found a new Saturday evening supper spot.",3
893,"Why do vegetarian restaurants think we need \""fake\"" meat, this I do not understand.  I had a primavera sandwich which was just ok, but the patty on the roll was just as perplexing as the \""mystery meat\"" you get in your elementary school cafeteria. My sandwich came with a boring pasta salad and some tortilla chips out of a bag.  Otherwise the atmosphere was fun, and the wifi was free if you ask for the password.",2
894,"I've been back to Quiet Storm many times. I can accept the hit or miss service since it's pretty cheap and casual. That's not really an excuse for bad service, it only somehow softens the blow, but why be mediocre? \n\nThe environment is comfortable (unless you sense the servers don't want you there). The music ranges and is appropriate for the environment. It's never too loud or aggressive. Free wi-fi helps and the milkshakes are slammin! The food is inconsistent, but often good. The Black-a-dilla is my favorite. \n\nI really want to like Quiet Storm, but it only merits 2 stars. Their food, service, and hours are inconsistent. It seems they often close early. \n\nOwners, please stick to your business hours. It's not like you're open that late to begin with! Perhaps everybody wants to go home, I don't blame them for that, and you may have run out of a few things, but try to imagine the disappointment of trekking out there to enjoy your favorite shake or snack and then being turned away.  \n\nOR, If you believe this is an acceptable business practice, it would be less infuriating if you simply changed your hours to '9am - until we feel like it.'  This way there are no set expectations and we can't really begrudge you for it. \n\n...My vote is to just stick with the hours you created.\n\nThanks!",2
895,"My experience has been ok at the Quiet Storm because I have 1) not deviated much from my usual menu choice (Original Home Fries = delicious) and 2) I have often known several members of the wait staff at any given time.\n\nThis has given me reason to continue eating at Quiet Storm on occasion.\n\nNegatives... I have eaten with several others over the years who have been wholly dissatisfied with their meals (small portions, not enough seasonings, could taste baking soda flavor in baked goods, etc). Service can be a little slow at times. And I have been burned a few times when going out of my way (it is a little off the beaten path for many) to score some delicious Home Fries only to find that the QS had inexplicably closed early.\n\nDespite this, FOR PITTSBURGH, the QS is a good spot for vegan/vegetarian fare.",3
896,"So when we first went here for brunch, I had no idea it was a vegetarian restaurant.  That's an unpleasant prospect to face down after a hard night of drinking, which is the only time the idea of brunch ever occurs to me.  But then, the grim Spectre of Laziness appeared to me and asked, \""Do you really want to drive to another place?  Just look at you. Your wearing the same shirt that you wore yesterday dude.\""  \n\nThe Spectre of Laziness is a dick, but he was also right.  And to my surprise, nothing I had was bad at all.  For brunch options, meat eaters will find that potatoes and eggs are the cornerstone of any breakfast, and seitan substitutions are not as bad as say, having the grim Spectre of Laziness point out your slovenly appearance.  \n\nI think the biggest surprise in this place is that, though nothing is particularly jarring to the palate, there is nothing that really stands out as being amazing.  In Yelp terms: it's kind of a 3.  For hard core vegetarians having a night, er, mid-afternoon on the town, it's probably a blessed change from the meat based culture that Pittsburgh is pretty famous for.  But I'm willing to wager that very meat eaters will become converted to vegetarians after this.  Maybe they did TOO good of a job substituting meat items.  That being said, we did make it back another time for lunch where I had a vegetarian gyro.  My friend said it best: \""What's the fucking point?\""\n\nThe service is always very sweet, but both times the waiters have been curiously, nay ominously spacey.  Even when it wasn't crowded there had to be some substantial flag downs and polite and doleful eye contact before they would do what you needed.  If you're in the area and looking for...this type of thing, you really don't have too many other options so just eat it.",3
897,"Honestly, this the last place you'd ever expect to see me. First it's a vegan/veggie cafe, I am a complete carnivore. Secondly, it's like hipster brunch paradise, I'm super preppy (a heavily tattoed preppy person but still).  Yet this was one of the only places open on Labor Day and I walked in with my vegan friend, she immediately recognized her people and practically jizzed in her pants over the menu. OMG seitan gravy and cheez?\n\nWTF is seitan gravy and cheez? Why does she keep calling vegan cheese, \""cheez\"" anyway? I decided to go with the flow and order the Home Fries Ranchero. Basically their \""famous\"" home fries, chili, sour cream, eggs or tofu and cheez. I went native and ordered tofu vs eggs, and you know what? I liked it. It came out in a big heaping pile on a 70s retro plastic plate, accompanied with some awesome coffee. My friend had hummus and pita, cause not only is she vegan she only eats things in the white/beige color range (food racist).\n\nOne bad thing, the bathroom has no door, only the stall does. Basically it's a unisex bathroom where all the delightful sounds and smells can be experienced by diners directly in front of you. For a place that serves chili and \""cheez\"" they may want to reconsider this open approach.\n\nThere are some previous reviews about arrogant hipsters/bad service etc. I have say our waitress was awesome and attentive. My coffee was filled routinely, she understood that requesting a \""buttload\"" of cream meant a larger carafe of cream rather than a thimble. The host was apologetic for making us wait for more than a few minutes to sit down.I do admit it does have the indie coffee house feel, and yes hipsters abound here, but I have a feeling these are some legit hipsters. Not the trust fund having, whiny, I drink PBR, and annoy people with my smugness style hipster.  I bet these hipsters been squezzing their junk into tight pants long before I was born. I don't know, I just get that impression. \n\nI however feel a little weird for writing such a positive review on a uber crunchy place, so I feel the need to go slash tires on someone's Prius now.",3
898,"Quiet Storm occupies a special place in my heart compartment because, one lazy Sunday in 2004, I discovered Alfred Bester's The Demolished Man. Imagine my joy: a cyberpunk fan, finding a tattered copy of some anonymous-looking book in some proto-hipster cafe (this was back before it was toooo hipster), and discovering the glories of Alfred Bester. (Seriously, The Demolished Man is good.) It also fit in perfectly with the blue collar/gentrified charm of Pittsburgh in general, and the Hill District/Lawrenceville/Bloomfield in particular.\n\nAnyway. I have returned now in 2011 for a veg brunch, and it was a pleasant, if not-so-good-value-for-money experience. I got the True Grits (yeah, Jeff Bridges, yeah), which was a HUGE bowl of grits (some shaved, grocery store-feeling cheddar on top), a pile of delicious, chopped lemony kale, some pretty blah scrambled eggs and a large glass of cranberry juice (very healthy!). Overall, it was fine. I didn't like the $12 price tag so much (seriously, grits is pioneer food and you're charging me $12!), nor did I dig the shades of hipper-than-thou among the clientele, but shrug shrug.",4
899,"They have these tofu tenders, which are akin to a vegan buffalo wing.  I can't put my finger on it, as there really doesn't appear to be much to them in terms of some sort of secret cooking technique, but holy crap, I can't get enough of them!  I had 3 orders in 2 days, and since it's tofu & not some greasy wings... it's a legitimately healthy meal/snack.\nThe Cheesy Snake -- a vegetarian cheese steak -- can be made with vegan cheese, and it's pretty slammin, too.  \nThe slaw tastes like liking a brick of salt, and the coffee etiquette -- pouring old pots into other, half-full pots -- leaves a bit to be desired, but overall, I know that it's one of a few places in Pittsburgh that serves vegan food that's pretty awesome.",4
900,"Despite my 3-star rating, I think I will be coming back here again to give it a second try.\n\nI got the smashed potatoes with seitan, cheese, and aioli.  The first bite was OK--the aioli didn't quite suit my taste, but everything else worked pretty well together.  However, 20 some-odd bites in to the dish, the flavors were getting repetitive and the mushy texture started to gross me out.  I got about half-way through eating the dish and the so-so aioli became too much for me.  I couldn't take another bite.\n\nHowever, my wife's apple panini was delicious.  I would probably eat a few of those if I came back.  The cream cheese, cinnamon (from the bread?), and apple all worked together in glorious harmony.\n\nOn a strange note, while we were eating, some camera guys came in and started setting up what looked to be an interview.  We asked the staff what was going on.  Apparently someone was filming their submission/application to be on a reality show.  \""Oh cool,\"" we thought.  \""What reality show?\"" we asked.  \""Not sure, something on the Golf Channel,\"" they replied.  HAHAHAHA!  I thought watching grass growing on TV was boring enough.  Now they're making a reality show about it.\n\nIn the end,  the gross aioli was inexcusable to me.  Otherwise, I'd probably go 4 stars.   I still plan to come back and give it another shot.",3
901,"Yes, it is reasonably priced.  Yes, my food was tasty (6 on a scale of 1-10).  However, the place did not look clean to me--I won't be back because of that.",1
902,"Yes, I know.  I'm probably one of the few people that has rated this place with two stars.\n\nBut let me explain.  My friends and I wanted to try this place out and had high hopes.  I haven't heard of many vegetarian/vegan places in Pittsburgh so I expected to have some awesome vegetarian food.  However, from the get go, our host was absolutely terrible.  He did not look us in the eye and was just overall awkward.  There was obviously room in the restaurant for the four of us but he had to \""look in the back\"" to see if there was room.  One of the other servers eventually sat us in a clearly empty table that we could have picked out for ourselves.  Our first host came back, reiterated the same thing the server told us, but never gave us menus.  I had to go out of my way to ask for menus about five or ten minutes after we had been seated.\n\nTo be fair, our assigned server was very nice.  She was friendly and approachable.  But of course, our food came and mine was cold.  The potatoes in the hash I ordered was stale, old and cold and had such a small accompanying serving of bread.  Also, our utensils weren't given to us until after our food was served.  I know I may be sounding like a little bit of a snob but utensils should be expected before the food arrives.  Not to be completely biased, the rest my party had decent food.  It just wasn't anything special.  Definitely not worth $12 for brunch.\n\nNeedless to say, I will not be coming back to this place.",2
903,"I came into Quiet Storm not intending to have lunch, but just a latte and hang out to answer some emails for a little while (working from home makes me stir crazy, so bouncing around local coffeehouses, completely NOT fitting in with the crowd kinda makes my day sometimes). \n\nI walked up to the bar and was just going to grab a seat there, but super hipster server guy asked me to take a table, because it had an outlet to plug my laptop in. I didn't need to, but  ... good lookin' out. \n\nAnyway, ordered my latte - good espresso, but pretty weak foam. Served in a pint glass. That's fine. \n\nMenu actually looked really good, so I went for a sammy with apples, seitan sausage crumbles, and cheese. They offer different sides, but my super hipster server guy didn't ask me what I wanted; so being a newbie I figured maybe that was only with certain menu items. I was wrong, when the guy taking care of the table behind me was asked what he wanted. My fault for not speaking up. Sandwich was good, not to die for though, and frankly kinda small for $8. \n\nI'll finish with this: Internets are free, right? So, where's the code? Did I need to ask??\nI'll definitely go back though, intrigued by a few other things on the menu (like bbq tenders and pulled 'pork' quesadilla), and hopefully be a little more impressed.",3
904,"After three trips to Quiet Storm I am hooked.   I had the Bahn Mi, then the Veggie Gyro, then a burrito.  All were a large portion with excellent fresh ingredients at a price that was really really great.  \n\nMy significant other is addicted to the chili, which actually has a good heat level.  \n\nAlso the milkshakes are to die for.  Can't get enough of them.\n\nService is prompt and attentive.  The waitstaff is knowledgeable and friendly.  Service is quick even when they are busy.  This is the perfect casual restaurant.  The decor is funky  and cool.  There is even a pinball machine!\n\nWill return again and again I am sure.",5
905,"So I admit my boyfriend and I actually didn't know it was vegetarian/vegan until we had ordered our food and looked more closely.\n \nWe went this past weekend and had brunch. We each had thai coffee which was ok, not stupendous, not horrible. He ordered the veggie burger, and I had the chocolate oatmeal pancakes.\n\nHis burger was unseasoned and fairly cold, my pancakes were okay...but to be honest really lacked flavor (the taste of what I imagine cardboard to be came to mind). I don't discriminate, I'm all for veggies and vegan food, but just because those are your ingredients doesn't mean you can't cook things well and add seasoning.\n\nI am intrigued to go back because the apple cheese panini sounded possibly better than what we had.  \n\nI will note that ourwaitress was very sweet and friendly, but the food was just lacking in flavor so much that it's really deterred us from going back.",2
906,"Ugh... I got a plate with seisage, tofu scramble, and sundried tomato toast. My whole plate was entirely dry, chewy, and unpalatable. I had high hopes for the tofu scramble, especially after seeing positive reviews about it. But honestly... It tasted like nothing. I thought it'd be moister with a creamy consistency that might come from silken tofu, but it was hard, dry, and chewy. Hubby got a country burrito that was much better in comparison to my plate... But that might have been due to the fact that his whole plate was doused in gravy. Anything will taste better drenched in gravy. We think the gravy tastes like the powdered packet kind where you just add water. On top of all this service wasn't the greatest. I had to fish around for my own ketchup and they didn't even bother to ask me what kind of toast (3 options on the menu)I wanted when I ordered the toast option for my meal. Then they didn't bother to ask hubby if he wanted anything to drink after he had picked one of the $12 entrees that come with coffee or juice. We had to tell someone else to get it for us. Also they don't really wash their cups. There are 2 sink basins at the front where they just dunk the cups in one soapy basin then dunk the cups in a second water basin and then stack them next to the sink. It made me not want to drink my water even though I was thirsty. Good idea, but poorly executed food. I've had good vegan and vegetarian food before that's consisted of a lot of fresh greens, avocados, and more. For a vegetarian place, there was nothing green on our plates. This experience sadly fell enormously short of our expectations... Could've eaten at kaya or meat and potatoes for the same price.",1
907,"My husband and I stopped going here, back in 2010, because of the bad service we were receiving. We used to call the servers \""Whole Foods Rejects\""; they were always cranky and we felt not welcomed, rushed. At the end of 2011, I think they got a new manager, the service has been optimal and we haven't stopped going since. Their food is delicious as well as their drinks and coffee.",5
908,"Worst tofu scramble ever. Days old, cold, hard, inedible.  Sent it back and had no time to wait for another dish. I can't even believe that the server, let alone the  \""chef\"" thought it appropriate to serve. \n\nBrought my 2 year old along, had to get a high chair, I'm able to do this just would have been nice if asked by server if we needed one.",1
909,"Nothing matches in this place! The tables, the chairs, the tiles and that's how we like it! Lots of delicious vegan items. Definitely a good place to try new things. Good coffee too!",5
910,"I've found the service here to be pretty terrible. Servers can be pretty careless about taking care of simple things and my friends have had similar experiences. The food is really pretty good, but if the overall service sucks, then well, it makes it hard to enjoy a tasty meal. Sorry Storm, you need to improve this.",2
911,Great cafe for brunch and coffee. Lots of vegetarian options and nice atmosphere. Come check out the place if you're in the area and would like to try some healthy foods. Was here for some brunch with friends and our food did take a while to make it to the table but everyone enjoyed their meal. If you come too late during the evenings for dinner the food options are less then what's on the menu.,4
912,"Me and my kids got food togo from here, because it came recommended from someone at the local food co-op as a place with good vegan options.\n\nCute and attractive DIY style decor.\nFriendly staff.\n\nI really liked the food quite a lot (i'de give it 4/5 stars).  GOt a tofu banh mi with a side salad.  When I asked what dressing they had, I expected to hear the list of \""usual\"" uninspiring dressings that vev/non-veg restaurants often have.  The first one she mentioned was a green chili dressing tasted as fun and yummy as it sounded.\n\nMy kids didn't really love their vegan homefries meal (with scrambled tofu and a weird vegan cheese sauce thang).\n\nAnyhoo.  Really pleasantly surprised with this joint, and the food was pretty reasonably priced.  \n\nAs with any place I review, I am subtracting a star because they aren't all veg.  Anyplace selling eggs dairy and flesh isn't perfect for me.  I'de probably really call this 3.5 stars.",4
913,"I love quiet storm! I think it's as good as you can get for vegan cuisine. The country burrito is BOMB! So good, there has to be crack in the gravy. I also enjoy the tahini queso, I often add it to my burrito. It's best on the nachos. For around $13 you can get a delicious filling breakfast/brunch coffee/tea included. They also have great pastries & dairy free coffee drinks & milkshakes! It's a vegan dream come true. It does get a little crowded during Saturday mornings so expect a wait, but completely worth it. The atmosphere is oozing with hipster ambiance associated with the area (Garfield) which also means they often play good music! Last time I was there it was all Neil Young! Accompanied my burrito perfectly! I definitely recommend this place to vegans & NON-vegans alike!",5
914,"The Quiet Storm was great. I started with the soup of the day which was something along the lines of a carrot pumpkin curry. It had an unexpected texture but I still quite enjoyed it. For my entr\u00e9e I had the Spinach Burger, which was quite filling. It is quite unique and comes with plenty of options for toppings. I couldn't resist putting cheese on the otherwise vegan burger, but still felt very healthy eating such a veggie-filled dinner! Their milkshakes also looked amazing - I would have tried one but I needed something to warm me up instead so I got a latte, which was also very good. One other thing I thought was neat was that the sell mixers and encourage you to bring your own champagne and/or vodka. I haven't seen that before, but it's a great idea!\n\nI was also intrigued by some of the other items on the menu, so I will need to go back to try more.",4
915,"Sandy had me holed up in Pittsburgh looking for a flight and staying with my wife's aunt. She adventurously agreed to go with me to a veggie place and that's how I ended up here. \n\nNice layout with tables along the windows and more in back. If you're not familiar with this kind of scene it could seem a little rundown, but to my eyes it was fine. Really, it's kind of the proto-typical East Coast college town vegetarian hangout.\n\nThe aunt-in-law is a meateater and in her seventies, but she really enjoyed her tempeh Cubano. And she loved her lavender lemonade. No room for dessert though.\n\nI got the Banh Mi and it was very tasty. 'Nuff said.\n\nThe service was in my mind delightful. The server was engaging and welcoming to my somewhat timorous companion, explaining the dishes to her and making a recommendation that worked out. He was efficient and personable.\n\nToo bad I won't be back in Pittsburgh anytime soon, or I would make a repeat visit for sure.",4
916,"Andrew here said it best: \""...  food served by workers who mostly don't seem to notice they're working, and when they do, only respond snarkily.\""\n\nIt took me 40 minutes to get a sandwich here, and when I complained I didn't get an apology, just a snarky remark \""well you can see we have a small kitchen\""",2
917,"I'm still not convinced that this is a vegetarian restaurant. It just has to be a parody of a vegetarian restaurant. Like, every time I start reading the menu I think Ashton Kutcher is going to pop out and tell me I've been Punk'd.\n\nA small disclaimer: I am not vegan or vegetarian and I never will be. I love meat. But I also love vegetables and fruits and pretty much the entire food pyramid. And these things can be combined to make tasty vegan food. But \""Texturized vegetable protein hydrated with seasonings\"" is not food to me. Yep, that description of their \""chorizo\"" comes directly off their menu. Eating vegetarian does NOT mean you need to subject yourself to these highly processed \""foods.\""\n\nLess processed substitutes like tofu, tempeh, and seitan are used as well, but they are mostly treated as a stand-in for meat. I guess if you are a vegetarian that misses eating meat, this may satisfy you. However, as an omnivore, why would I eat a faux-BLT when I can eat a real one? How about instead of trying to imitate the flavor and texture of meat, we actually come up with creative combinations of vegetables, fruits, and legumes that are delicious in their own right. What a concept! Have you ever eaten a vegetarian dish and thought, \""Whoa, I can't believe I actually like this better than meat\""? I have! But don't expect that feeling here. It will be more like: \""Umm...I guess tofu mixed with nutritional yeast is kinda reminiscent of scrambled eggs?\""\n\nTwo stars because I really like the drinks here. The ones I remember trying were the ginger lemonade, the Mexican hot chocolate, and the root beer with a shot of espresso. They have some really wonderful sounding tea options that I wish I could try, but I generally avoid this place because of the food.",2
918,"I don't think I would have known about Quiet Storm if it hadn't popped up several times in friends' Yelp feeds in the last couple years.  I'm all about veg/vegan restaurants, but I have to agree with other reviewers who wish Quiet Storm's food was *slightly* more interesting.  \n\nHusband and I ordered take-out so we could enjoy a late lunch al fresco at Schenley Park overlook.  Folks working were vegan-hipster quirky, but friendly and helpful.  We ended up waiting about 30 minutes for our food, so we decided to partake in an afternoon coffee to pass the time.  I  had an iced Morroccan latt\u00e9 with cardamom and rose,  husband the Mandorla sweet almond milk latt\u00e9.  Both were excellent.\n\nFor my meal I picked the Tahini Bowl with brown rice, spinach, roasted red pepper, tomatoes, pepitas and fried tofu cutlet with a tahini dressing.  I wished there had been less rice and more dressing; the bowl was also screaming for more seasoning.  Husband opted for the Crunch Wrap Extreme: scrambled tofu tossed with celery, carrots, edamame, kale and spinach, dressed with vegan wasabi mayo.  Again, twice as much dressing would have added flavor and moisture to an otherwise fine wrap.\n\nAnd that's just it: the food at Quiet Storm is fine.  When really, I'd been hoping to be utterly wowed by the magic capable of being worked by nothing more than mere vegetables, plain grains and humble legumes.  Still, I won't discourage you from eating here.  I just might come back myself.",3
919,"I was somewhat worried about going here since the reviews seem to be bimodal, so I was pleasantly surprised when our food was flavorful (some reviewers complained of blandness) and not trying to imitate meat (some reviewers said that seemed to be the goal), but exploiting the wonderfulness of vegetables and scrambled tofu (which, despite the other complaints, was just fine). We had the \""tenders\"" appetizer, with both the vegan BBQ sauce and the vegan wasabi mayonnaise. We much preferred the BBQ sauce, but I am guessing if you are a wasabi fan, you would like that too. We all thought it was wonderful. On the advice of the server, I had the peanut wrap. It was spicy, heavily peanut-flavored, but full of yummy veggies. I also had a side of chili, that I liked a lot (and I make my own veggie chili at home, so I am picky). Ben had the apple panini with the gazpacho side. We both thought the gazpacho was kind of plain (it got better by adding chili!), but the apple panini (with \""seisage\"", cheese, etc.) was very good. Finally, Panchu had the coconut burrito, which was huge, but he ate the whole thing, and was very happy. We all split a vegan cinnamon roll for dessert, and I really wish I had been able to get my own!\n\nSome complained about the wait; I think this place fits well with the \""slow food movement.\"" If you want fast food, go to McDonald's.\n\nSo, based on one observation, I gave it five stars. YMMV.",5
920,"Quiet Storm is a delicious and cozy little place located in the colorful Bloomfield area. The buildings surrounding Quiet Storm are often painted with cute art or have little interesting things about them. I love this neighborhood, but I love Quiet Storm even more! \n\nI've only been here twice, and I always want to go more often but somehow it doesn't happen. I've turned on three of my friends to Quiet Storm too, and they love it just as much. The first time I visited I ordered a tofu hash. It was an amazing blend of seasonal vegetables, including some I would never eat otherwise. The tofu was nice and firm, the seisage was spicy and perfectly chewy. The vegan \""cheese\"" sauce was also rich and delicious.  The portion was so huge, I couldn't finish it. Leftovers are rarely as good as when the meal is fresh, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that my leftovers were even BETTER than the fresh meal. I think this is because the spices and vegetables had more time to meld together in a perfect veggie harmony. \n\nThe second time I visited was 4/21/2013. A group of my friends came here for Brunch. Two of us ordered the Vegan Country Burrito, another friend ordered the french toast with pistachio honey topping and my other friend ordered a tofu hash with black beans and salsa. Everything was generously portioned, but some meal choices were sold out. They were a bit disappointed that there was no more falafel. All of us devoured our plates and happily chattered about the complexity of flavor, protein content in vegan food items and how much we loved the atmosphere. \n\nQuiet Storm is a great little place to visit. It's never lacking in interesting things to look at while you eat. Food comes as quickly as possible. There are plenty of options to please everyone, and if you think you don't like vegetables, try one of their plates and you may change your mind. (Seriously, I am one of those vegans who hates veggies, but Quiet Storm food can get me to finish all of mine) \n\nTip: If you want to go for Sunday brunch, go early so your favorites will still be available. \n\nYou may also want to nudge the servers a little more than you usually would, because even though our drinks were bottomless, it was a pain to get them back to give us refills - even for water.",5
921,"My friend and I were having a weekend trip to Pittsburgh (first time!) and stopped in for brunch on Sunday before our visit to the nearby Pittsburgh Glass Center. We weren't familiar with the area & this looked like a cute place- ended up definitely enjoying our time here!\n\nWe weren't aware that it was a vegan place; regardless, the drinks menu & and the brunch menu both looked amazing. Friend ordered the Nyam, which she said was very filling (surprisingly). I had the the Country burrito, which definitely surpassed my expectations. Decent, good. \n\nFriend & I both ordered the Don Juan mocktail which was the highlight of the meal- holy crap! AMAZINGLY GOOD- I always think that horchata tastes a little too watery but the coconut juice & caramel helps round out the drink & make my tastebuds sing. I'm only sad that I can't keep visiting and trying more of their drinks. \n\nMight not necessarily go out of my way to come back BUT I would definitely go again if I were in the area. :)",4
922,"This place is a train wreck. Quiet? No. Storm? Yes. Loud, slow, bland food and annoying service are only a few of the complaints that I have.\n \n1. The Vegan / Hipster / Metal thing has got to go. All I kept on seeing through the kitchen window was the armpit hair of the cook wearing the Mot\u00f6rhead tank top. I am a huge Mot\u00f6rhead fan, but when I go to an overpriced restaurant I don't want Lemmy to be making my food.\n \n2. The food is bland. Shoving a bunch of brown rice and black beans in a tortilla does not automatically make the food vegan and there were very few things on the menu that were 100% vegan.\n \n3. The service was pretty bad. Our appetizer came to the table with our main dish and the entire time we watched the staff eat their dinner in front of everyone at the counter. I am pretty sure that three different cooks made our order, as the cooks were tag teaming the line while they were eating.\n \n4. Last, but not least... the volume level in the place was numbing. The guy working the counter kept on slamming the ice cream freezer door every time he made a milkshake, the music was some sort of Bjork style electronica that I am pretty sure was written to induce migraines and there were about 6 hippy couples letting their kids run wild.\n \nI have been to plenty of vegetarian restaurants in my travels and Quiet Storm does not even come close to the top 10. I think Pittsburgh deserves better.",2
923,"Delicious!! Not a vegetarian, but this place might convince me to switch over. Had a few breakfast options and was blown away by the Greek plate and the QTF. Excellent coffee too.",4
924,"This place is great! Cute inside, great milkshake and hot and cold coffee drink options. We had the horchata was didn't taste exactly like horchata but was delicious. We ordered the bah mi which came with two types of fake meat on it. It wasn't a traditional tasting bah mi as it didn't have enough jalepanos, cilantro and it was much heavier but the bread was good and all in all it was a delicious sandwich. We also had the flower salad which comes with a heavy dose of kale and smoked tempeh. Really really good with the peanut dressing! Tempeh is soft and very flavorful. Will get again. Found out that they are closing/ moving to an unspecified location next week so we hope that they will be there on our next trip through Pittsburgh!",4

On a recent to trip to Pittsburgh I tried alot of pizza and this was good pizza.  \n\nOne thing about Pitt pizza... it is slightly different than true NYC style:  the crust is not as thin and there's a whole lot more cheese.  As a rule Pitt pizza also has a slightly sweeter tomato sauce.  The sum of its parts is still a delicious close cousin to NYC pizza.\n\nThe pizza I tried in Pitt in my order of favorites:\nFiori's\nPizza Sola (Penn Circle Branch)\nPizza Perfectta\nAiello's (Murray Street)\nBeto's\n\nSave for Beto's, I thought they were all delicious.

My friend and I were given our pizza in a box although we were planning on eating on the premises.  Still, it seemed like we were not wanted and decided not to press the point.  We walked across the street to a parking lot and saw a Pizza Perfecttta box and some leftover pizza littered on the ground.  In the end we didn't finish our pizza and assumed that many people in the past have been hastily handed their pizza, pushed out the door, only to walk across the street, eat mediocre pizza, and decide it wasn't even worth the energy to pick it up and throw it away.",2

I have only had the food at this place by delivery and it has always come before and hour has passed. The pizza always comes warm and ready to eat. Nothing to complain about. I did give it only 4 stars because there are a couple of other places that serve homemade ranch on the side which makes the pizza taste even extra delicious.",4
937,"The food and customer service from this restaurant are really top notch.  I am continually impressed with how fast the delivery is and how likeable the drivers are.\n\nThe pizzas here are excellent as long as you don't get the \""crab meat\"" topping (I should have expected gross imitation crab meat since we're so far from the coast).\n\nThe breadsticks, jalapeno poppers, and wings are also delicious.\n\nSome of the best pizza in Pennsylvania.",4
938,"I was pretty disappointed with this place. I thought from the good reviews that the pizza would taste okay. I went here around 12am on a Friday so maybe their ingredients weren't as fresh. I ordered a medium veggie pizza with a side of fries. The fries were super soggy and the pizza was pretty flavorless. There are only about 2 seats inside so you pretty much have to take it to go which was fine with me. \n\nThe people working there are really nice though which is a plus. Overall, i wouldn't go back.",1

I will never be ordering from them again, which is a shame since they are so close to me. I immediately called Pizza Parma which gladly delivered to me. I recommend ordering from Pizza Parma since they have similar menu items, they post accurate hours, and they don't hang up on you! Seriously? Why answer the phone?",1

The order itself arrived within thirty minutes which was great. Although the pizza tasted decent, the crust was not crispy at all, the slices were pretty floppy. They also skimped on the toppings a bit. I was hoping for a more loaded pizza. I'm not watching my weight--I can handle it. As far as the popcorn chicken goes, it was too salty, even with the honey Dijon dipping sauce. Probably not ordering from here again.",2

Over the past 3 years I have taken my cat there not only for his yearly's but for other heatlth issues and was alway met with caring staff. Dr. Simard is my favorite vet there, and I try to get her as often as I can, but I have also seen Dr. Berger who is great and have heard good things about Dr. Schroth as well. Dr. Gerson is the owner, I have seen him once and he is a tad gruff, but if you are direct with him he is easy to work with. \nMy cat has always had a bit of a weight issue and since going to Point Breeze and working with Dr. Simard my cat has gone from 25 lbs to 18lbs and we seem to be well on the way to Dr. Simards goal of 16lbs. \nMy cat was also treated by Dr. Simard for a bad case of worms, after apparently catching and consuming a mouse in our basement - again they got me in right away and before I knew it he was worm-free. \nI have never felt like they wanted to up-sell me on anything, and they have always been very patient and willing to hear my concerns. \nI really love this clinic, and truely believe that they exceed in animal care.",5
943,"I took my cat here for a preliminary checkup after adopting her from the animal shelter & then again to have her declawed. I was very impressed by the facilities and service. The facilities are spotless & modern, and the vets seem both knowledgeable and willing to spend time with you and your animal.\n\nI was particularly impressed when I had my cat declawed. They kept her for several days to monitor my progress & called me each day to update me on her progress.\n\nIt seems a bit expensive (although I have no other point of comparison) but the service is well worth it.",5
944,"The vet met with us for a very short amount of time. She was rushed, seemed distracted, and was abrupt. She very quickly said that it seemed like SCC, or oral cancer, and that there was no cure and the prognosis wasn't good. She left the room seconds after and only came back in to say that they would get blood work and schedule a biopsy. After she said she thought it was SCC, she didn't give us a chance to ask questions or respond. \n\nThe technician didn't have any demeanor with our cat, nor with us as clients. She seemed tired, and overworked.\n\nAll in all, this was a negative experience. I recommend that you take your pets to another vet :(",1
945,"I guess I'm getting burned out on winter.  That's what made me think about this place.  See, as Julina below says, it's close to Frick Park and it's a wonderful place to pick up sandwiches, pop, or picnic supplies before going over there.  It's also a great place to sit outside with a cup of coffee or a cold drink or snack before going over to the Frick Mansion.  So you can stop here with your out-of-town guests while sightseeing.\n\nThis is truly a little out-of-the-way gem, located on a side street.  I haven't been up this way in awhile (I was also nosing around on Google Maps/Street View yesterday, so that's also why I thought of this place) so I hope nothing much has changed here.",4
946,"There is nothing better than a neighborhood market, and Frick Park Market fits the bill. Come here for grocery staples, a great homemade sandwich (get the breakfast sandwich, any of them!), or just to hang out. The owner will be there & is happy to talk to you.\n\nThe best part about the market, though, is when the kids get off school & come into the store for candy & soda. You can tell that the business is connected to the neighborhood and that everyone gets along. Pittsburgh treasure!",5
947,anything you need you can find it at the market :),5
948,"I like this place; it single-handedly made me hate Pittsburgh just a little less.  In fact, this would be an easy 5 stars if it wasn't in Pittsburgh and therefore emblazoned with all manner of Steelers propaganda, and as a Browns fan I...I just can't do it.  I'm sorry.  The sandwiches were good and prepared with genuine care and attention to detail, the people were friendly and the prices reasonable.  Get the soft pretzels, toss 'em in the microwave and eat them with mustard.",4
949,"As a displaced west-coaster, I appreciate a store like this in Pittsburgh. \n\nI like the bulk goods and spices because you can take as much as you need, you get the spices whole and they put them in big jars so you can sniff them if you want before you buy (the downside to that is that every time the jars get opened the spices probably lose some oils), and there's a huge selection. \n\nThis place has my quinoa, pearled barley, spelt flour, and nutritional yeast. \n\nSome of the vegetables pop out at me and I'm tempted to buy a lemon or some really ripe piece of fruit. Usually I don't though. During the summer they were selling fresh herbs in pots. That was really tempting. Once they sold kittens. That was amazing. \n\nIt doesn't hurt that its right by the climbing wall, fencing, gymnastics, and bike shop.",4
950,"This is a good co-op, with a generous selection for it's smallish size. Prices are better here than in some co-ops I've shopped at. Competitive with the big boxes, as far as I can tell. I have tried some hot-bar/cafe items and quite liked them. The java jolt smoothie is amazing, as is the lemon pepper tofu sandwich!\n\nIf you can judge a town by its co-op, which I am prone to do, Pittsburgh proves to be a decent place to be a conscientious vegetarian shopper.",4
951,"There is nothing like this in chicago!  (that I know of).....I hope I get to stay in Pittsburgh long enough just to take advantage of this co-op.  I love the bulk section, especially since I can choose the quantity of what I want to buy.  Super convenient for travelers.  You can buy pasta, granolla, flour, quinoa, cous cous, cane sugar, spices, YERBA MATE!!!, dried fruit, nuts, olive oil, peanut & almond butter, soap.....man, I could go on & on.  You can buy all of that stuff & choose how much you want of it.  \n\nI was suprised that they had cacao powder, for such a small place.  They have a nice little section of tofu, tempeh, & seitan next to a bunch of vegan cheese that looked really good.  \n\nThey also have a juice bar & vegetarian \""cafe.\""  I don't think I'd call it a cafe, more like buffet.  I wasn't all that impressed with the food they had cooked, but I'm not going to penalize them for that.  For such a small place it's pretty amazing what they already have going on there.  I really want to try something from their juice bar too!!  \n\nThere must be someone dj'ing the music in the store because I heard some great music that you wouldn't hear on the radio.  Everyone was very curteous and nice.  I should try to make friends with these people since I'm new in town.",5
952,"Kind of small, but I've had excellent luck with produce here: fresh and organic. In-store coffee bar is a nice plus.",4
953,"This place has steadily improved over the years, and never fails to make me happy.  \n\nIt's stocked with every variety of weird hippie food.  It's also stocked with the best produce anywhere in the city in the winter months when Giant Eagle's selection looks beat up.  The prepared foods case in the back is deliciously weird.  And it's locally owned/operated, so you're not exactly sending your hard earned money to Whole Food's CEO.\n\nThe membership is lifetime, apparently, which the employees always kind of failed to express; I thought you had to pay for it yearly, and the difference is pretty big.   That said, I live far enough away that getting here regularly still doesn't justify the membership.",4
954,"Lots of great vegan, local, organic, gluten-free, and/or raw food, though some items are quite pricey. Very good rotating-item hot bar for take-out lunch or dinner. Great bulk food selection, including diverse reusable glassware of known tare weight. Fresh fruits and vegetables are right-priced, but processed items like meats, cheeses, and frozen items can be surprisingly expensive. Fairly comprehensive selection, akin to a Whole Foods.",4
955,"Just moved here from Baltimore and ran across this place.  Love it!  Watch yourself at the hot bar.  There's no scale (should be).  Your mea l(of veggies, tofu and kale) could end up costing $20 easily.  I usually grab a hot meal and play on my computer 1-2 hours.  Love the carrott juice with ginger YUM!  A small is $4.30 ouch!  Just found out they won't charge you for bags if you bring your own....COOL!",4
956,"Ooooppss...update time.   Got the regular (steamed spinach and lasagna) from the hot bar on my way to work.   So, I'm on my dinner break sitting, chatting it up with a co worker while eating.  I see something white in the spinach just before putting it in my mouth.  WTF is that!  OMG, it looks like one of those fat ass worms we'd  pluck from the greens in my grandma's garden.  I threw the fork down and my co worker says...\"" you're seeing stuff.\""  Um NOT!  I sat there digging through the spinach determined to find that damn worm.  Thirty minutes later  SHAZAM...found it. Ugh, my coworker spread open the spinach leaf.  EEEkkkk, it was bigger and fatter with black spikes poking out.  FUCK!  Call the manager at Co-op and he says...\""Bring it in for a refund, thanks for being so nice about it...We usually just see worms in the fruits.\""  Geez, thanks for that lil tidbit.    This happened last week around the Sept 14, 2010.  Guess that means it's really organic, huh?",2
957,"I really love this little place. The hot bar is almost always completely wonderful. I especially love the breakfast/brunch on weekends, it's one of my favorite meals. The potatoes and garbanzo bean patties are amazing.\n\nThe prices are pretty much in line with any smaller heath and local food oriented grocer. I can usually count on them to have specific items that Whole Foods is sold out of and sometimes at a better price. Plus, the Co-op hot bar is a million times better than the Whole Foods hot bar - quality over quantity all the way.\n\nShort lines, great staff, good for Pittsburgh.",4
958,"It's disappointing that you got lukewarm service, Erina.  I've had pretty consistently good vibes (har har--get it?--hippie reference) there from the staff, who've been enthusiastic about helping me find what I need.  Hands down, this place beats Whole Foods for price and general atmosphere, and their salad and hot bar is my go-to when I don't feel like cooking.  Absolutely GREAT bulk section with a wide variety of grains, legumes, and pastas.  Killer cookies and baked goods.  \nOn the other hand--if I lived on my own, I could do all my shopping here.  But, since I don't--I can't.  It's tough to stock a household kitchen solely from the EEFC--I mean, I can't really afford to regularly buy $15 laundry detergent.  \nRealistically, the Co-op can't serve most of us for one-stop shopping.  But it's worth it to put down a few extra pennies for potatoes or juice to support a genuinely community-oriented business.",4
959,"I just found this place a month back and I'm kind of blown away by how awesome it is. Fresh produce, awesome prepared salads and dips, bulk everything, natural cleaners, and plenty of hippie garbage you can't help but fill your shelves with. The best part is that they try to stock up with locally sourced produce, milk, and meat. And you can get a good discount if you purchase stock in the co-op.",5
960,"I was visiting Pittsburgh and looking for a throat spray called Singers Saving Grace. Whole Foods didn't have the item in stock but East End Co-Op did! Also, had a smoothie while a shopped. \n\nWhat a great find!",5
961,"This co-op is probably great for vegans and vegetarians, but I am Paleo.  I was very happy to find grassfed butter, raw milk, and cheese at reasonable prices.  The bulk foods section was missing a few mainstay items I typically pick up, and the meat selection was very poor.  I would like to see a better listing of which meat is grass fed and grass finished, as many of the farms in the frozen meat section did not have any of that information.\n\nFor my future needs, I will be ordering directly from the farm (this co-op sells items from the farm that I will be direct ordering from) at a lower price and will fill in the gaps elsewhere.",3
962,"Forget Whole Foods when you have East End Cooperative! Honestly, this is quite possibly one of my favorite coops. They make some amazing deli items...so amazing that I went back twice during my visit to PA. I was only expecting to have a few options in the prepared food section, but the vegan options were plentiful. Their mock tuna salad was impressive, made with tvp, vegenaise, and spices. The potato salad was creamy and exceptionally delicious. And the vegan pasta salad was also impressive. Generally most grocers fail in this department, but East End excels by leaps and bounds. I can't believe how tasty their store-made food was. The prices were also very reasonable, if not low. If I lived in PA, I'd join their coop and would go there frequently.",5
963,"I have been going to CJ since it opened. I try to go once a week. I have received some good deals there, but in the past couple years, the prices seem to be higher than they should be for used / overstock items. I find myself buying less items than I used to. I think if the prices were more reasonable, they would sell more.\nA new \""reuse\"" store has opened in the area nearby. They have more reasonble prices and thier building is heated.",3
964,"just got off the phone with a lady from construction junction.  normally, i have had the best experiences there. . . all have been very cooperative and helpful.  but, i guess they are so successful that they are becoming arrogant.  here's the rub:  my hubby sent me a picture of a chandelier they had; i did not see the picture until 30 minutes later; by then he had left the store.  i called to BUY the chandelier over the phone.  this has been done before (we WERE construction junction junkies).  the lady adamantly refused to help me. she adamantly refuesed to even listen to a description of the fixture!  she gave the following excuses:\"" well, if you have been here in the last 12 years, you know how this place works\"";  \""I can't go back there and try to find out what you want\""; \""i am the only one on the floor\""; \""this is first come, first serve\""; \""if your husband comes in and it is still here, then we'll sell it to him\""  \""how will i know which one it is - we have so many back there...\"" .... i could hear the smirk in her voice as she enjoyed blowing me off. . .  i even offered to send her the picture my husband sent me via email - she refused.  keep in mind, i wanted to pay for the item.  my husband cannot go back to construction junction today. . . most likely the item will be gone. . . it would have been nice had this  sales agent been more helpful - especially when it was clear how badly i wanted to buy the fixture.  she did not express any concern whatsoever for my requests:  (like, so sorry, i can't help you at the moment, please call back and i'll try to accomodate; give me a brief description and i'll try to find it... etc.).  sometimes, even if you can't accomodate someone, it's how you say it that makes all the difference.  construction junction will implode if it begins to treat its customers indifferently.",2

They have old appliances , bathroom sinks and toilets, lighting fixtures, wood, paint, counter tops, flooring materials, some tile, etc., etc.!",5
967,"Very primitive bouldering area, but the routes were challenging, in part due to the lack of a smearable surface (plywood kinda painted to look like rocks),  mega shitty footholds (jibs worn down to shiny scummy nubs that sorely needed cleaning or replacing), and a distinct lack of fall-friendliness (one old mat to be shared among every 3 or 4 walls, and an unforgiving floor that thudded every time someone landed on it).  Not a bargain for a $12 day pass since the routes did not seem to have been changed very often and all climbs shared the same foot jibs which looked practically permanent. The changing room was literally a closet.\n\nAll that griping aside, there were some decent climbs. The V3's were fairly easy but the V3/V4's were exponentially harder. I was able to do one V4/V5, but my butt was royally kicked on everything else. No ego boosts here, and the masochist in me awards 3 stars to this old school climbing gym.",3
968,"The blonde woman who tuns the gym was extremely rude to us. First time we went she refused yo.get off the phone on a personal call to help us. Then she gave us the rules for the bouldering area in a rapid bored monotone. Compared to other climbing gyms I have gone to this gym is less safe (no gri-gris), unfriendly, and more expensive. Definitely not worth it. Worst customer service I've seen in a while.",1
969,"Pittsburgh doesn't really have its choice of indoor climbing walls, but I was pretty impressed by this location (though note, this review is just for bouldering). The bouldering area is huge, and on a Saturday afternoon surprisingly empty with no need to wait for any route. It's labeled from V0 upwards... although the floor is padded, the walls do go up pretty high (the 10ft estimate from before is accurate), so a fall would be pretty scary... they do give you an option to wear a helmet, but I saw nobody doing so.\n\nThe routes are all clearly marked, and difficulty seemed to correspond with rating - there are also a ton to choose from, so you won't get bored. One staff member in particular was amazing - Allen - who spent the time giving climbing tips and encouragement to whomever needed it. Costs are also reasonable ($12/day, + $3/shoes, $2/chalk), and it's located in a nice strip mall with the East End Co-Op nearby for food. Overall, not a bad place to spend an afternoon!",4
970,"I'm giving this the ok rating, I am not an experienced climber but a beginner. The last climb I went out was a real one in Utah with my brother who got me all harnessed up only to instruct me to place my foot and hand level with my head and pull myself up . You can imagine how that went with my golden retriever feverish barking and running below instructing my brother to let me down lol.\n\nSo for a beginner I found the price to be ok I went with a group and paid 16$ for shoe rental and I guess climbing fee? We stayed for about two hours. We went on a Saturday it was very crowded probably 15-30 people in the place but there are so many choices you can still get a wall. There were several beginner climbs that are easy for anyone with a shred of upper body strength. Then some V2 and V3 and V4, the other beginner gals I was climbing with found there was a pretty big variation from the VB to V2 on some of the climbs. So sometimes it was better just not to follow the stickers completely if you're a beginner but still looking for variation while bouldering. \n\nI think safety-wise things are bit of a liability here, walls are high, mats are very old and very few. Also lots of people don't follow the basic rules including teenagers who are there alone. So be cautious of your space an d others space and consider fatigue when getting to the top of those walls with your hands all sweaty. \n\nI also expected it to be a little larger based on the website photos, but I understand that this is Pittsburgh not a city with room for a huge gym like out west. I also think if they were to build a bigger newer gym here with higher climbs, then you would be looking at paying $25 and up. \n\nMy biggest complaint is that you can only do lessons at certain times with a harness, this makes it harder for beginners to get in and get a feel. I did complete one or two V7 or V8. Just to push myself but I would have had more fun if I had the support of a rope so the next time I go back I will consider classes. Which costs a little bit more but oh well. Class times are limited check the website.",3
971,"Some helpful hints for the Climbing Wall:\n\n-A one-day pass is $12.  College students/active military pay $10.  Wednesday is 1/2 price for ladies (but only after they pay full price on the first visit).  Wednesday is also 1/2 price for guys who wear a sports bra.  Yup, you heard me right.  Wednesdays are usually pretty crowded.\n\n-They run a different membership special every month.  If you climb more than once a week, a membership can definitely be worth it.\n\n-If it's your first time at the wall, I highly suggest just doing the \""bouldering certification\"" instead of the \""safety and belay certification class.\""  The bouldering certification takes about 5 minutes and then you can start climbing.  Decide if you like it, then do the belay certification.\n\n-If you \""like\"" them on facebook, you can get updates about when they change the routes, what membership specials they're running, if they're selling any old/used shoes for discounted prices, etc.  \n\nThe wall is in a great location, on several bus routes, and right next to the East End Food Co-op.  It can get crowded, but everyone takes turns so you have plenty of opportunities.",5
972,"Went to this place on a Groupon and fell in love. It reminds me of the days when I lived in Denver. I miss it! The routes are decently hard and allow me to push myself to get better. Staff has always been awesome. People there help give pointers. It does get pretty crowded sometimes, especially on Friday nights. I'd say they are almost in need of an expansion! Keep up the good work, Climbing Wall. I'll be seeing you a lot for the next year :)",5
973,"I've been climbing for a few years but have friends who have never climbed. This place has lots of climbs at all different levels so my friends and I can enjoy climbing here together.  Plus they have instructional classes if you want to learn more. It has a great atmosphere - a great place to hang out with friends or meet new people. The staff are amazing! Very nice and very helpful. The prices are very reasonable, lower than any other gym I have climbed in (and I have climbed in lots of facilities). I definitely recommend climbing here.",5
974,"As a new climber I found the whole process intimidating, but the staff at The Climbing Wall helped me get on the right path. Also, the regulars here seemed very nice and always willing to help out a newbie. It isn't very expensive either, 10 or 12 bucks for a full day of bouldering is a very reasonable deal (I haven't seen many places which were cheaper). \n\nI'm sure a lot of people, including myself, wish this place was a little bigger, but for being in the city it's not a bad size. It's actually surprising how many routes they managed to plan out for the size of the place, there's more than enough to keep the walls feeling fresh even after many climbs. The diversity of the routes is really great too, there's plenty of routes for each skill level and climbing style. \n\nThe overall experience was wonderful: great staff, great people, and a great setup. \n\nTip: If you're a beginner without your own equipment, the shoe rental is worth the extra 3 or 4 bucks.",4
975,"I like this place but the hours are inconvenient (top roping doesn't open until 5PM during the week!!!!) I wish they would expand their hours. Otherwise, they make a nice effort to change their routes relatively often.",4
976,"Dirty slick holds. Hate the fact I can't move mats. Some problems were fun, some were awful. The staff is very unfriendly. Unless you're part if the clique no one will talk to you.",3
977,"Sub-par setting quality, infrequent wall resetting, inconsistent grading, poor climate control, poor air quality (no chalk filter), silly rule where they make everyone wear paper wristbands before entry. + 1 star because they are finally installing air conditioning.",2
978,"Pros:\n- At least there's a climbing gym in this area\n- Walls get reset often\n\nCons:\n- I've been coming here a couple times a week for the past few months now, and I have felt like some of the walls really need some padding besides the not-so-great spring board they have. The walls are pretty high and the height + lack of mats retract me from climbing certain routes, which is really disappointing because it ruins my climbing experience. \n- I brought up the aforementioned lack of mats to the woman who works here, and she snapped at me: \""Mats are only supposed to be under walls that are sloped.\"" I told her the wall I was talking about was sloped, and she replied curtly \""If you don't feel comfortable climbing those walls without a mat, then you shouldn't even be climbing them.\"" I was in shock. Is this a way you should be addressing your climbers' legitimate concerns? Even if it isn't possible to have mats, she could have at least told me in a nicer way instead of talking to me as if I knew nothing. \n- The gym closes at 11PM on Fridays. I usually go at night until they close, but the staff passive aggressively starts turning off the gym lights around 10:50PM. I get it, it's a Friday night and you want to get outta here. But the business hours are until 11PM, so let me enjoy my last ten minutes of climbing because I am paying for my climbing membership and I want to get as much climbing as I can get out of my sessions at the gym. \n- The holds are old and covered in rubber from the shoes. It would be nice if they could at least pressure wash them every once in a while. \n- The fees are unreasonable for the customer experience we get here.",1
979,"I was home for the holidays and wanted to take some friends of mine climbing.  They've never belayed and don't have equipment so my hope was that we could go, I could test out of the belay class and we could top rope some easy climbs.\n\nDreams crushed.  Only people that are belay certified can even be in the top rope room.  I would've had to pay $5 to test out of the certification and even if my friends wanted to take a quick lesson on how to belay, its only at very specific times and you need to give advanced notice.\n\nSo we bouldered.  The walls are old, made of smooth plywood and though the walls are a good variety, you eventually end up right on top of one another.  You can only top out on one tiny section, everything else backs right up to another wall or and abyss.  With someone who isn't super comfortable down climbing or jumping from the top, I wasn't always super excited to fall when there wasn't a nice big cushion.  Those were only on the overhanging walls.\n\nThe place was super busy on a Sunday afternoon and group after group rolled in.  I understood why there were so many VB and VB+ routes (easier than V0's).\n\nSide note: cubbies are completely separate from the bouldering area and no food or drinks are allowed inside the bouldering area.  Therefore your water stays in your cubby, plan carefully.\n\nI expected better from Pittsburgh and heard that there is a new gym coming, so I'll be waiting for that one before I try to climb again in da burgh.",1
980,"There are some really good things to say about the climbing wall, but overall I was quite disappointed.  I wanted to like this place, so I'll start with the positive aspects.  \n\nFirst of all, the gym in pretty cheap.  And the bouldering area is really quite good.  To be honest, this should only be a bouldering gym. There were a lot of different volumes, nice routes, some top outs, and a good cave area.  Even a small crack with a few problems set on it. \n\nIt seems like whoever is in charge of setting the boulder problems really has some talent.  I might be back to bolder once in a blue moon.  The other climbers here were pretty cool, so the place might have a good vibe/community aspect. \n\n\nNow the downsides.  The staff wasn't very helpful.  The rules regarding the top rope area are nonsensical, and the only reasoning offered up was insurance. I wanted to belay for a friend, but he wasn't allowed in the top rope area unless belay tested. Belay testing also cost $5, and I hate when gyms charge for a test.  It's poor form. \n\nThe ropes aren't doubled up, and with the short wall it gives way too much pull.  They require you to clip into daisy chains on the ground.  I wanted to lead climb, but there was no one at the gym that could give a lead test. The TR routes were really hit or miss, a lot of them just confusing and not fun. They aren't rated properly, just easy, medium, or hard. \n\nThe walls are painted plywood, so smearing is basically impossible.  Further, I question if the holds have ever been cleaned.  Some of them are so polished to the point that it's dangerous.  \n\nThere's only once changing room, and overall the place isn't very clean.  I believe there is some potential here, but it seems to be mismanaged and on the whole, a missed opportunity.",2
981,Don't go. I got more problems and sounds on my car after I spent $800 there. unbelievable!,1
982,"This place is looking to make money and rip you off.  The door of my car had a dent in it for over three years when I took it here for my annual inspection.  Never before did anywhere else have a problem with it, but this place said they would not pass it.  Weird how it passed inspection 3 times already with no other place mentioning the door being a problem.  Never giving this place any business again, I went to a different Meineke in Homestead where they are helpful and work with you.",1
983,"I definitely got the best service of the restaurants on Ellsworth from this restaurant, and they also offer the best food for the price.  \n\nThe menu is creative and dinner (soup, salad and salmon) were delicious, but there is nothing that Portugese about this place (except the decor and a very sweet older lady hostess who may in fact be Portugese).  In fact, I think it would be considered a national security threat in Portugal to have a place that serves dinner NOT serve wine.  The government of this state is partly to blame though.  Since when did PA become goddamn Utah?!  But Rendell's gotta get his cut I guess...\n\nAnyway, the place is small and intimate, one server handles the floor.  Minus points for the lack of alcohol,and frozen butter with the bread, but this restaurant is a neighborhood gem.",4
984,"OK, so I admit that I was underwhelmed by Cafe Zinho when I first went, a few years ago.  And then I didn't go for a long time.  A few months back, my husband and I randomly decided to give it another try, and boy am I glad we did!  It's fantastic, and has quickly become part of our regular line up.\n\nI'll say again that I'm not certain how the food is Portuguese.  That being said, it is mighty delicious.  I love the personal service.  I love the corn bread.  The starters are phenomenal, to the point where I sometimes think that the entrees are superfluous.  But when we get them, they are lovely too.  I love the ambiance.  In short, I owe Cafe Zinho an apology.",5
985,"Lamb burger was outright bad(tasted off and charred). We shared and together only ate half. The filet was decent but not $25 worth of decent. Waiter was kind and the ambience is romantic but at the end of the day the food just wasn't that good. There are lots of great byo's in the city and in my opinion, this isn't one of them.",2
986,"I've eaten here once after having it suggested by numerous people, I was totally disappointed with the service, food, and the place itself, I will not be headed back......ever\nSave your money, or starve either would be a better option",1
987,"The adjectives that come to mind when I think of Cafe Zinho are cute, quaint, cozy and in a random area. I don't think I would have stumbled upon this place just upon chance. I made a reservation for three on a Tuesday night at 7. My two friends were already there and then... there was just me in the restaurant, which scared me a little bit but I have to have faith in my fellow Yelpers. \n\nThe waitress was an adorable woman who was so friendly, helpful and enthusiastic about the dishes in a quiet manner. You just wanted to pinch her cheeks or something. Anyway she gave us some bread which was sweet, unlike many of the other restaurants breads that I have had, which I enjoyed. We ordered the goat cheese for an appetizer which was just so ooey and gooey deliciousness and then for the piece de resistance ordered the sea bass special that night which had capers, a potato, rice and some roasted vegetables. Great light combination and not too heavy. The size of the sea bass was like of the entire whole fish. To top it off we had the rice pudding dessert which was similar to flan but I thought this was so tasty. I kind of want one right now as I am typing this review.\n\n\nI am so glad I went to Cafe Zinho finally and would happily come back here again.",4
988,Atmosphere and service was great. Appitizers were good. For dinner We ate the pork tenderloin and a ravioli of some sort.  Both tasted good with the pork tenderlion being the best.,4
989,"Visiting from NY, we actually found this highly-rated restaurant on Yelp ... and we were certainly not disappointed! It's situated on a nice residential block near a large liquor store (byob).  The ambiance is fantastic and the staff are warm, friendly and attentive. We were seated in the private back room because no other tables were available. A real VIP treatment.  \nFor starters, the goat cheese pastry and smoked salmon appetizers were to die for. Many of the others sounded great too.  Our daughter, who is at college here, was missing some of the food options of NY. Not any more. She had the lamb burger with feta cheese. I had the seafood stew and my wife had Chilean sea bass.  All fantastic! Thankfully we had just enough room for tres leches dessert. If anyone knows of a Portuguese restaurant this good in NYC ... or even in Newark Ironbound I'd love to hear about it.  We will definitely be back!",5
990,"I was underwhelmed with our dining experience. We are just learning Portuguese for an upcoming trip to Brazil and were excited about the option of using some of the vocab we had learned.\n\nMenu was somewhat limited, although we didn't try any starters which many of the other reviews state are the best offerings on the menu. I ordered the seafood stew and my husband had the chicken dish. The stew had seafood: clams, mussels, shrimp, scallops, and some type of summer sausage, but not much else. The broth was oily. My husband's chicken was prepared adequately; however the rice it was paired with was extremely underdone while the veggies were over-cooked and mushy. \n\nI might go back once more with a bottle of wine for appetizers only but for the price I will dine on entrees elsewhere.",2
991,"This was the first time for me and my wife at the celebrated Cafe Zinho. Parking in the residential area in which the restaurant is located is next to impossible on a busy Saturday night; the diner should be prepared to walk a distance to get to the restaurant from where he or she is ultimately able to park.  The greatest drawback is that the restaurant is tiny and the seating so tight that at our table, it was necessary to sit uncomfortably in order to avoid being bumped by anyone that walked by, which happened repeatedly as we were in a busy thoroughfare of food delivery.  No other table offered a much better situation and all others were occupied at the busy time we arrived, 6:45 p. m. The online menu boasts of a daily vegetarian and vegan special entree, but there was no such entree on this night.  There was only one non-meat item on the small menu, ravioli.  Our gracious server, Ramon, said that the kitchen could prepare a couscous and vegetable dish if the vegetarian in our party wanted it, and that was what we did.  The restaurant permits customers to bring their own alcoholic beverages, a nice convenience and savings for the diner.  A small portion of bread was served with a tiny amount of rock-hard butter.  My mushroom and cheese soup was a large portion, served piping hot, which was great, but it was a puree with no distinct mushroom pieces.  I would not have been able to distinguish it as mushroom soup.  All of our entrees were attractively presented and were tasty, average size portions.  All were served with a small amount of good, fresh vegetables. It would be helpful if the menu offered some description of the following entree so that the diner with an interest in a chicken dish would not have to inquire about it of the server:  \""chicken maputo\nRoasted w/ piri piri & chocolate scented sauce\"".  Does the average diner know what \""maputo\"" and \""piri piri\"" are? The lemon tart dessert was a small piece not suitable for sharing, served with two minute pieces of strawberries and a small dollop of whipped cream.  It was not flavorful or moist nor worth the calories.  The gracious owner, Tony Pais, stopped at our table for a moment to greet us, a nice touch, and there were quality checks by a manager and Ramon.  I noticed a number of prominent people from the community dining here, individuals whom I was surprised were willing to spend a good deal of money to be packed into a sardine can of a restaurant.  Apparently they consider this to be the only restaurant in town.  The rest rooms are small, one-person facilities, naturally. An unfortunate surprise occurred when the individual that was picking up the check for my party presented his credit card only to be told that the restaurant accepts only cash and checks, this for a tariff of $148 plus gratuity.  It is supposed to be of some consolation that there is an Automatic Teller Machine on site.  I imagine less than 1% of expensive restaurants today are cash only.  Cafe Zinho is a highly flawed restaurant, demonstrating that there is more to a fine dining experience than simply offering fine cuisine.  If one is able to get beyond the feeling one has when visiting the rest room on a commercial airliner, the diner might enjoy it: not us.\n\nI posted comments about the restaurant at its Facebook page, in which I noted my displeasure with being cramped and uncomfortable, and about the restaurant being unique in its unwillingness to accept credit cards for a $148 check.  An individual identifying himself as the manager, who apparently had never received constructive criticism from anyone, initially demonstrated rage, posting a message that I can go to the Oiive Garden the next time I dine out.  He later added with similar condescension that I can use a coupon and a credit card at The Olive Garden.  Later, he thought better of his outburst and removed the comments...along with mine.  He ultimately offered me and my wife the opportunity to return to the restaurant at his expense.  I thanked him for the offer, but told him that one experience at Cafe Zinho was enough.  I had no intention of returning even if he had responded to my comments like a gentleman.",1
992,"My partner and I were visiting my family in Pittsburgh we live in San Diego. my partner was born and raised in Portugal. My mom heard about this resaurant and was excited to take my partner and I to a Portuguese restaurant in Pittsburgh. We went, looked at the menu and did not find anything Portuguese on the menu. Why does this restaurant promote itself as Portuguese, fly the Portuguese flag and not have ANY Portuguese dishes. We left.",1
993,"This is a cozy little place. I made last minute reservations for a Saturday evening because the restaurant we were supposed to go to  closed due to an emergency. Major bummer for us, but life goes on and luckily we were able to get a table at this place. At first we were seated by the register area and that was a little awkward because it felt like the hostess and waitresses were right at the table with us. I wasn't in the mood for a large group dinner so we asked to be moved, a request they graciously accomodated. Unfortunately, we were then seated pretty close to the door and it was a cold February evening so that was a little rough. Fortunately, we had a whole bottle of wine to warm us up.\n\nOK, so now let's talk about the wine thing: \nthis is the first BYOB place I've ever eaten at and I loved it! It's pretty great to share a bottle of wine that you can pick out yourself, rather than spend a fortune on some ordinary bottle offered by the restaurant. I didn't know if we had to open the bottle ourselves and brought a cork screw just in case, but turns out they open it for you; I can't remember if there was a corkage fee, but it they do it's a small fee.\n\nNow, for the food: we shared a sardine appetizer and it was quite good. The bread was also really delicious, very fresh and soft. For my entree I ordered the lobster tail and that was very tasty! The veggies served alongside were cooked perfectly and the sauce was light and flavorful. We ended the meal with a chocolate mousse, which my partner didn't love, but I thought it was pretty good, definitely not the best I've had, but good!\n\nTo sum it all up: good food, cozy place, and friendly staff!",4
994,"What a gem of a place in Shadyside.  It s places like this that makes me miss living there.  Food was outstanding!  Because it was our first time, we wanted to do a little bit of this and that.  2 appetizers, Becky s salad and the special of the eve:  smoked salmon on crostini with creme fresh, a clam dish, forgot name, with the best tomatoe-white wine, I could have drunk from the bowl, broth; Becky s salad (the lemon dressing was out of this world delicious--again, could have drunk it, good).  I m usually not fan of walnut in my salad, but the crumbled goat cheese made me forget about my dislike of it, that I ate it happily.  Good pairing.  The special of the night, we opted for sharing the lamb shank with reduced red wine sauce and simple veggies.  Small veggie selection by american standards--half russet potato, slither of zucchini, and a stem of green onion, but the star afterall was the lamb, and it was meduim perfect, just as I ordered!  \n\""Would you care for some dessert?\"", Ramon, our waiter (he was fabulous!) asked.  And so round 3 begins.  Coffee, a chocolate mousse with whip cream, beauty and...  their version of creme brulee.  I thought it had a hint of peanut butter, but not sure.  Regardless it was  so, so divine.\nThis place was busy but we did not feel rushed, unlike most places.  The service was great, the atmoshphere quaint; it s definitely a neighbourhood cafe-- alot of repeat clientele, from what I gathered.  We shall return.\nFinally, on an end note. Cafe Zinho is BYOB, so bring your favourite bottle or magnum of vino.  And they only take cash or personal check, but they do have an ATM.",5
995,Recently dined here for the first time and can say that I was pleased with all of the food choices we had made at this establishment. The cold prickly pear soup was certainly a good choice of appetizer. The service was acceptable and the staff very welcoming. The only downside to this place is the atmosphere. It can get extremely loud at times (especially when you are sitting next to a party of 12) and it becomes rather difficult to have any table conversation.,3
996,"Cafe Zinho is a cute little restaurant tucked away on a street corner in Shadyside that serves up Portuguese food. Everything looked great on the menu, but execution was flawed through out our meal. Also, their dishes are not really Portuguese.\n\nFor appetizers, we got chicken livers and portuguese bread pudding with mushroom cream sauce. The chicken livers lacked flavor, which is unfortunate because chicken livers on their own are not very tasty. The bread pudding was pretty good though.\n\nEntrees were, on the whole, not impressive. The lamb chops were obviously over cooked (we ordered medium rare, and the insides were almost fully cooked). The duck breast which people raved about online were tough and the sauce was too sweet. The seafood stew lacked flavor. The lamb burger was also overcooked.",2
997,"The grounds are very nice here, but I have to say the part I loved best was the collection of cars. I've never seen so many antique vehicles in one place. Definitely makes it worth checking out. However. The location is a bit wacky. It's right outside of Wilkinsburg, which isn't a place to visit at all. But still, it is nice enough to check out. Especially if you want to just go have a nice lunch at the cafe.",4
998,"The Frick Car and Carriage Museum is interesting and fun. They play very informative short films in a screening room and the docents there are very friendly, helpful people. The Car and Carriage Museum is very well worth going to. And the amazing part is that is free. \n\nThe Frick Art Museum is not really that interesting or great. There is hardly anything of note. As far as I can see, Helen Frick had way more money than taste and money can't buy you taste. When J.P. Morgan died, he donated his entire art collection to the Met in New York. However the Met did not want everything. Helen Frick bought many pieces that the Met had already passed on, with good reason. Of course not all of the Frick Art collection consists of the Met's castoffs. There many portraits of insignificant nobility done by French court painters who had little talent. Just bec. art is old or expensive, doesn't mean it's really any good. It's a good thing this museum is free.",3
999,"I was here on Mother's Day with my Mom, my mother-in-law, my aunt, and my cousin.  This was a \""girl's day out\"", a gift to ourselves (we left the menfolk at home!).  Afternoon Tea was absolutely exquisite.  Don't get me wrong--I love a good ballgame and hotdog just like everyone else.  But sometimes I gotta do \""chick stuff\"" like this too!  \n\nWe took the tour of the mansion and the Frick Art Museum.  Current exhibits include The Road to Impressionism: Barbizon Landscapes from the Walters Art Museum and 1806, Jena, a significant late-nineteenth-century painting by French artist Jean-Louis-Ernest Meissonier.  \n\nThere is a lot to see and do at the Frick.  Get off your butts Pittsburghers and enjoy this place!",5
1000,"It's free, and the car & carriage museum has a Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost.\n\nWe skipped the house tour ($10), the cafe, and the art museum.   It was still worth visiting just for the old cars.",3
1001,"Very nice home and grounds.  I could not exactly say I am a fan of the owner or how he earned his money but I did appreciate how original the house and belongings are and how beautiful the grounds and buildings are.   Can you say Johnstown flood?  How about the Homestead strike?  Celebrating the extreme wealth of few on the backs of a billion who worked 16 hour days for nothing isn't exactly something I really love to do but I can appreciate beautiful art and architecture of which there is plenty to see here.  We toured Clayton (the home), art museum, conservatory and the car and carriage museum.  The conservatory didn't have a lot of impressive specimens and was far from full but is a great building.  Be sure to earmark about 4 hours for the whole experience including, perhaps, a pricey but tasty snack at the cafe (make a reservation).  We had a really nice time and I do recommend a visit if you are here so you can not only see some great furnishings but so that you may learn some of the history of the economy here.  After all, we shouldn't turn our backs on the reality of our collective history lest we make the same mistakes again.  I am glad they are doing such a fine job preserving this place for generations to come.",3
1002,"What a Frick-ing fantastic place!\n\nThe Frick Art & Historical Center has all the bases covered when it comes to museums: historical site, visual art, beautiful grounds, classic cars and buggies, restaurant, greenhouse.  Not to mention that everything -- with the exception of the house tour -- is free.  No one could possibly say there's *nothing* that here interests him here.  Husband certainly couldn't convince me.\n\nI kid.  He's a trooper.\n\nWe arrived at the Frick on a gorgeous blue morning and started out with an excellent tour of the Frick family abode.  When the family moved to New York City after Henry Clay struck it rich in the steel business, they kept their house in Pittsburgh for return visits to the city; 93% of what's in the house is original to the Frick family, which always makes a house tour more interesting to me.  They lived lavishly, and Frick was an avid art collector.  His personal collection -- displayed both in the home and museum -- is impressive.\n\nAfter our tour we visited the Car and Carriage Museum, which had husband transfixed with its Model T Touring Car, Rolls Royce Silver Ghost, American Bantam Convertible Coupe, Panhard et Levassor Tonneau and Lincoln Model K Sport Phaeton among others.  Finally, we finished up with a spin around the Art Museum itself.  It's a beautiful building with a very manageable size.  I was thrilled to find a current exhibition of Medieval Persian pottery -- found along the ancient Silk Road route -- currently running as well.\n\nSay what you will about H. C. Frick (let's be real: the Johnstown Flood and handling of the Homestead Strike would have tarnished Mother Teresa's image), the Museum and Historical Site are *well* worth your time.",5
1003,"A delightful (and free?) way to spend the afternoon. The grounds are beautiful, and the architecture is great, and the nearby Frick Park is a wonderful walk. It is quite a gem in the middle of this city. Didn't tour the Clayton (reservation needed), so can't comment on that building.",4
1004,"How have I been living in Pittsburgh for over a year without a visit to this awesome site?!  My husband and I finally paid a visit to the Frick thanks to the \""We Love Our Members\"" promotion that local museums were offering to their members.  (We are members at the Carnegie).  I was vaguely familiar with who Frick was and knew there was a house tour, but I had no idea how much this site had to offer.  \n\nOur visit began with a trip into the shop/visitor's center.  There we browsed the gift shop while waiting for the tour to begin.  The gift shop building was once a playhouse for the children and you can still see where gutters for the bowling alley run through the middle of the floor.  It was a great place to start the tour and begin learning about the family and their connection to the area and American industry.  I am not a Pittsburgh native, so I knew very little about them.  It is important to note that you can't bring large bags with you on the tour, but they do provide free lockers to store them while you are in the house.\n\nThe tour continued by entering the house.  The enclosed porch provides a coat rack so you don't have to lug it around with you.  The house is detailed as if the Frick family was still living there.  We learned from our docent that they were fortunate that one of the family members lived there through the 1980s, so the house was well maintained and preserved.  Each room has exquisite detail and decor.  Our guide spent a great deal of time explaining and showcasing the art work.  Many local Pittsburgh artists were featured along with well known artists such as Monet.  Every aspect of the rooms were detailed including showcasing the new development at the time, aluminum.  The rooms upstairs featured less detail but were still interesting.  \n\nAfter our visit to the house, we stopped in the green house.  I'm not that in to plants, but it was interesting to learn that the plants grown there are used in the cafe.\n\nSpeaking of the cafe, we stopped in just to check it out.  They were fully booked that day (which is fine since we weren't planning on eating anyway) but we were so enticed by the dessert selections that we got two desserts to go.  A nutella cheese cake and a baked apple.  We enjoyed those later that evening after dinner.\n\nI am not that in to cars, but the car and carriage museum was very interesting.  The first section is carriages that the Frick family used.  My favorite was their \""special occasion\"" carriage that even had  foot warmer!  The car area featured various automobiles that had a connection to Pittsburgh.  There is also the option of watching three short videos about automobiles in Pittsburgh.\n\nThe art museum alone is worth a visit.  They were preparing for an exhibit when we were there so only the Italian and French sections were open, but they were fantastic.  A great collection with amazing detail and descriptions of each of the paintings.  The interior of the building is an attraction itself.  It does not look like it was built in the 1960s with the fantastic marble and woodwork.\n\nOverall, a very enjoyable place to visit that I highly recommend to anyone because there really is something for everyone at Frick.",5
1005,An often overlooked gem in the heart of Pittsburghs most beautiful neighborhood.\n\nThe Frick is essentially 5 small sights in one. \n\nThe grounds.  Nice 5 acre area that is well maintained giving a park like atmosphere.\n\nThe greenhouse. Lovely little greenhouse you can walk through.\n\nThe car museum is neat but currently closed for 18 months.  An early electric and steam car are the highlights.  Lots of olds rolls royces.\n\nThe cafe. Food.\n\nThe Clayton house.  12 dollar tour worth every penny.  The house tour takes about one hour and really is fascinating.  Not a huge mansion.\n\n\nAll in all just a nice place.,5
1006,"These people could not care less.\n\n I am still waiting for my washer dryer to get fixed -its been almost a month now and I am being told that they don't even know when the technician will return. The technician has been here 4 times already. Each time there is supposedly something else wrong and so they have to order another part. Miraculously the part is wrong (first week), They forgot to order the second part (2nd week), Part comes in but they need a suppossed other part and it will be \""another 3-5 days\""(3rd week), Fourth week rolls by and they \""don't know\"" when its coming in (thats up to the distributor). When I ask for an ETA (because I am wearing dirty clothes, and I am sick of technicians coming back 5 times and I already took off a week of work to meet these people) the cus.t service rep gets mad at me and offers me a refund. (The washer is on warranty) They obviously don't want to deal with any problems they created. So now I have to call the distributor to see when the part is coming in (yup,  thats YOUR job Appliance Service Center!).",1
1007,"so...my Maytag Neptune front-load washer...is malfunctioning...again! Evertime I try to wash a load of clothes...some of the water goes into the washer...then the rest of the water which is a lot...floods out of detergent dispenser and all over the exterior washer and onto my basement floor... \n\ntried to fix it my self but unsuccessful...fed up with the constant flooding...I called the Appliance Service Center like I usually do when my washer goes hay-wire... Customer service lady was okay...no awards for customer service excellence though...lol :) the appliance guy gave me a call...staying he will be at my home in 10 minutes which I thought was very considerate... the appliance guy...i call him...Mr. G... shows up and fixes the problem in 5 minutes! (to include the time it takes for introduction, background, and for him to take the lid of the washer off, diagnosis of the problem, and fixing the problem). He was very friendly and personable. \n\nthe cost of the 5 min fix is $92 bucks! and I have been a customer with this company for while... $92 bucks is cheap...in comparison to their other fixes on that washer... \n\nbeing able to wash your clothes at home is a blessing but may break ur bank if you go with this company depending on the malfunction...but everytime they fix it...the problem never re-occurs but something else always manages to break on that washer! I would rather pay the price knowing it gets fixed right the first time than to find another person to fix a mistake and pay more in the long run :)",4
1008,"Okay.  Here's an update to my original experience.  I have to say that Emilio, the owner of Izzazu is the consumate professional when it comes to customer service and follow up.  After my first appointment - at that time to be my last appointment - he doggedly tried to contact me to make the first appointment right.  Emilio and I had quite a lengthly and productive conversation.  He cares very much about making the customer happy AND correcting the situation that was unsatisfactory.  \n\nI did go back and was very pleased with my cut once again.  Because Marshall was running late (20 minutes and counting) Caesar cut my hair this time.  Another great cut!\n\nAgain, however, the desk needs training in customer service.  After a 20 minute wait, the receptionist still hadn't notified Marshall that I was there.   A downtown salon depends on clients who are on their lunch hours for the most part.  Next appointment I'll call ahead to see how they're running before heading to the salon and waiting.\n\nEmilio IS working on the front desk situation.  In the meantime, I'll continue to go for the wonderful cut!",3
1009,"I am a jack of all trades and a do it yourself-er at heart. While in college I worked as a promotional photographer for my very dear friends salon. As a barter service she always did my hair for free! !0 years I had this deal going on. As you can imagine I was pretty spoiled and didn't want to start paying to get my hair did. I began coloring it myself. Now as a licensed skin care specialist you pick things up from the cosmetologists working with you.\n\nI killed it, fried it and melted it. My hair was in dire straights! I have dark hair but I love being a red head. Marcia Cross red to be exact. Whoops! Lightening that many levels should not ever be done by a novice. What can I say?  I'm stubborn that way, and think I can do it all! \n\nI reached out to Emilio for help! I have to say that after many hours of laying down color he managed to make my hair healthy again and I left feeling like a movie star. A red headed movie star! I was flipping my hair all the way to the parking garage and even did a photo-shoot later that evening. Yes I did a photo-shoot because I needed a professional head shot for my work portfolio.\n\n\nI don't know if I'm being too harsh but my hair did turn out much darker than I had wanted it to be. I know sometimes it is hard to predict the outcome when mixing chemistries. \n\nThe other problem I had was the price tag, or the surprise when I went to pay. $250.00 for a color correction! I know this is normal sometimes when fixing the damage but it is also crucial to give your client some kind of idea on payment. I had gone in for color estimated at around $70. I think they did a decent job but for that money It should have been closer to what I asked for. Needless to say I haven't been back but would recommend in a jam.",2
1010,"Sadly, the professionalism of the front desk never got better.  Despite Emilio's assurances that changes were being made, my latest visit proved otherwise.  I called ahead and was assured that Marshall was on time...in fact, he didn't have an appointment ahead of mine and could take me as soon as I got there.  I was there a few minutes before my appointment.  I waited.  And waited.  Fifteen minutes later, I asked if Marshall knew I was waiting.  I was told by the brunette that they had been busy.  Odd, she, the blonde and two other employees had been standing there talking for a while.  She went back to notify Marshall.  When Marshall came up front to get me, the brunette admonished him that he should keep an eye out for his clients - she shouldn't have to notify him that his appointment is there.  Wow.  And the purpose of a receptionist is....what?  I'm done.  I'm out.  Apparently nothing will help Izzazu's but getting rid of the front desk staff.  \n\nOn a positive note, it was another great cut.  Not good enough to lure me back, though.",1
1011,"I recently had semi-permanent lashes put on for my wedding at the WEXFORD Izzazu salon. Upon completion, I thought they looked a bit odd, but figured I just wasn't used to them yet. The next day was my wedding day, and my bridesmaids and I got our hair and makeup done at the downtown Izzazu salon. The makeup artist (who was great) said they looked terrible (which they did- they were uneven and there was white glue all over them) and had to remove them and reapply. They are supposed to last 2 weeks, so removing them the next morning was very unpleasant and I ended up losing a ton of my real lashes when everything was said and done. This added 1 hour+ onto my appointment and I ended up barely having any time for pictures before my wedding. I would steer clear of Izzazu for semi permanent lashes!",2
1012,"I had an appointment that was made 2 months in advance and when I turned up they told me that the person I had the appointment with quit 6 weeks ago and they didn't have anyone available to take me. They made no attempt to reschedule me with someone else or call me to cancel. To make things worse, the battleax at the front desk had such an attitude. Here's a tip, when you are in the beauty salon business, staff the front desk with someone who looks like they have actually BEEN to a salon. Not with rude women that have hairdos from 20 years ago. Will never go back.",1
1013,"Emailed and called several times to get a pricing on having several services done at once as a graduation present to myself. I was put on hold twice and never picked back up. Emails went unanswered.  :(\n\nI was going to have SO MUCH done, too!! Hair cut, color with highlights, spa manicure/pedicure and an hour massage! All as a graduation present to myself but if they can't be attentive to prospective customers then I can't imagine that they'd be attentive in the store. I'll spend my money elsewhere!",1

1015,"Unbelievable experience! Literally unbelievable. I waited 50 minutes and finally walked out. Receptionists were beyond awful. I booked 3 style appointments in advance for a wedding. One person was taken right away, 20 minutes later the second person was taken.  I WAITED 50 MINUTES while being ignored by the receptionists.  I can celled because the others were almost done and we would be running late. My stylist finally came out and said he'd quickly do my hair. What !! I'm not paying $100 to get rushed service. We were looking forward to a relaxing, fun experience. More unbelievable, I waited 20 minutes to pay for the two services. One receptionist couldn't take transactions and another was occupied with a wedding party.  I was so close to walking out and not paying. Unfortunately the two stylists didn't get a tip through no fault of their own. I can't give an unbiased opinion of their work as I am still furious in the way I was treated.  I would expect some ambiance at $100 for shampoo & style. I could never recommend Izzazu. Denham & Company is on Market Square, their rates are reasonable and within walking distance of the Fairmont. I am calling the concierge tomorrow informing her of my experience.",1
1016,The best place for an artic swirl. :),5
1017,"Best place close to the city for a Dippy cone! I grew up in small town that hosted a Whippy Dip! Every time I see this type of privately run ice cream shop it reminds me of home and lazy summer days with my girlfriends. Riding bikes to the local pool, playing at the beach on lakeside, or causing a ruckus at the Whippy Dip! Oh, sooo serious summer romances... flirting with boys while throwing ice from our slushies was a regular occurrence.\n\nFinally, a warm spring day on the books and the only place I want to go is The Page. The location is so weird! Under this huge bridge away from any greenery or picnic tables next to a low end used car dealer. I suggest grabbing your food and heading elsewhere. There is always some sort of line and it gets worse on the weekend. These guys and gals are pros when it comes to ice cream and will recite all the flavors with speed that you might miss them. It's kind of like the Cheese steak place in Philly. Know your order when you get to the counter, pay, and move OVER!\n\nThey have so many flavors of ice cream! The menu is extensive, you can get anything here, brgrs, fries, hot fudge brownie sundae, or a banana split! I will be back all summer!",4

Check it out, freaky good ice cream, better blizzards than Dairy Queen, shakes that would have Ronald McDonald spinning in his grave if he were dead. \n\nI love Page's dairy mart, and look forward to opening day every spring, then go at least every week on those warm summer nights and have a cone or my favorite, peanut butter chocolate ice cream with butterfingers and reeses peanut butter cups running through it. Then I go run for two hours to burn it off, but it's worth it.\n\nWhy four stars? Bad intersection (Carson and Beck's Run) and parking can be a motherbucket.\n\nYou're still sitting there reading this? GO TO PAGE'S NOW!",4
1019,"I have lived in the area of Page's Dairy Mart for about 40 yrs. I have always enjoyed the ice cream until\"" this\"" day. I ordered an artic swirl (chocolate ice cream with chocolate chip cookie dough) I have ordered this same item over and over again. When I took first taste, no chocolate chip cookie dough pieces, second taste, same thing, third taste, same thing and so on for approximately 5 or 6 tastes. I took the cup with remaining up to counter and asked them to remake, I was denied told it would waste \""their\"" money, nothing about mine, what I had ordered was more expensive than plain chocolate ice cream. They dumped what was in the medium cup into a small and handed back to me. Well it wasn't even a medium desert, since it fit into a small cup. I even tipped the girl $2 when I first received my desert. I will never return, to make any other purchases. I will however return to express my disdain to the owner when I can find him there. I hope he reads this.",2
1020,"Hubby and I have taken to driving up Carson street to get to the Southside in order to avoid that HORRENDOUS traffic in Squirrel Hill.  We drove by Page Dairy Mart a few times and each time he would casually mention that he would like to go there someday.\n\nWell, we did.\n\nI wish I could comment on one of the DELICIOUS looking Sundaes, but I'm watching what I eat soooo... frozen yogurt it was.\n\nWhat I can say is that the yogurt was smooth and creamy and I LOVE that they have a ton of flavors they can \""mix into\"" the yogurt so you can get almost any flavor you want.  Hubby had a cone of regular soft serve ice cream and said it was really yummy.  He also had an order of cheese sticks and said they were just o.k., so we will probably stick to ice cream/frozen yogurt from this place.\n\nThe kids working were fast and friendly so we left them a nice tip.  As someone who worked her way through college working at a frozen yogurt shop I can say -- TIP YOUR SERVERS, even if just your change -- they will greatly appreciate it.  :-)",5
1021,"Stopped in here after a bit of night time sightseeing of Pittsburgh. My sister and brother-in-law, who are the ones who live in Pitt, had never been here before, so we were all newbies! Huge plus that it's open until 11pm on weekdays. This little place is great. You walk up to the order window, pick from a handful of different soft serve favors and cone choices, and are given your fresh ice cream in no time! I ordered the strawberry soft serve in a waffle cone. HUGE portion, and less than $3! Obviously shocking to me as a native New Yorker, since nothing around here is ever that cheap. My sister had cheesecake soft serve, my other sister had blueberry soft serve, both also in waffle cones. My brother-in-law had key lime soft serve in a pretzel cone! So unique and actually really delicious, having that savory/sweet thing going on. 4 cones of ice cream for less than $12. Fresh, homemade ice cream, with really nice staff. I look forward to my next visit to pittsburgh, so I can enjoy this place again!",5
1022,"Damn good ice cream.  \n\nI love a great generational dining experience, my grandma took me here when I was a little girl and this past weekend I got to share the experience with my boyfriend his mom and nephews.\n\nI ordered a traditional banana split, but really I wanted to have one of everything on the menu. \n\nThe strawberries are real strawberries!!! That alone sets Page Dairy Mart a part from the rest.",4
1023,"Have driven by this establishment many times when I lived in Pittsburgh and in my visits, but I never pulled over to sample the goods. That is until today and it was really good!\n\nDon't be swayed by the lines. The staff is really efficient and move quickly. Prices are reasonable and portions are huge. \n\nAlthough I was really impressed by the different flavors of soft serve and that they are all homemade, I saw the sign for the apple dumpling sundae so I opted for that instead. My aunt went with a classic chocolate shake. \n\nThe sundae is massive and the ice cream was so good, some of the best vanilla that I've had. Only critique is that the core part of the dessert were canned and were too sweet and sugary(- a star)\n\nEven though I don't opt for anything vanilla in life, I think I might squeeze in one more scoop on this trip!",4
1024,Great ice-cream at a reasonable price. I love their chocolate banana milkshake.,5
1025,Get a Southside Shake with hot fudge shake and peanut butter sundae on top - absolutely amazing!,5
1026,"The best soft serve I have ever had. Some flavors are better than others. Of the mint chocolate chip, toasted coconut, and pistachio that I tried last night (what can I say, I was hungry) the toasted coconut was the best. It has real pieces of toasted coconut.\n\nA very good value for your money.\n\nDon't expect to find any seating here.",4
1027,"This place is a little gem! Hidden just down E Carson, past all the shops and busy streets there is a tiny little unassuming building on a large corner lot. I've never been a fan of soft serve or gone out of my way for it, but this place will make you do just that. Not to mention the fresh squeezed lemonade made to order (yes, they squeeze the lemons right into your cup.) Burgers and fries are also made to order, so be prepared for a short wait while you prepare mentally for the heaven you're about to consume. I'm not a fan of their fries (they tasted like they were made in old grease) but wow that cheeseburger. I have a small appetite and can't usually finish most things - so when I ordered my burger and fries I let the bf know he was expected to finish it for me. Little did we know he wouldn't get any of that delicious burger, because the second I took the first bite the rest magically disappeared. \n\nOh! They also have old fashioned dip cones which are one of my favs. \n\nDefinitely recommended.",5
1028,I have had lots of items off of their large menu and everything has been good.,5
1029,"I've been coming to page's since I was about 5, literally. I love it. It's a local favorite for sure and for many reasons. 1) the history behind page's... Literally if you walk behind page's there are old photos of what the building used to look like and some south side history :P. 2) their ice cream is incredibleeee. They have a ton of unique flavors and combinations. My favorite item on the menu is their strawberry sundae with twist ice cream, with an Esther's chocolate covered pretzel on the side. Pure heaven. 3) their food is amazing as well. I love their south side hot dog! It's unique and amazing.. Toast bun, grilled dog and chilli sauce.. So good. Their fries are awesome as well. I also adore their lemonade, both regular and freckled. Keep in mind they are cash only though!",5
1030,"Page's is a Pittsburgh icon. The ice cream is good, the selection is vast, and the price is right. They have so many different things to try, it's nearly impossible to choose. I'm a big fan of the cookie sundae, brownie sundae, and cinnamon roll sundae. The options at this place are pretty much endless. But sometimes a regular soft serve sugar cone is the way to go. It's better than Dairy Queen, AND you support a local business by going here. What more could you ask for. \n\nI don't know if I would say that Page's has particularly superior soft serve, but it's the experience and variety that makes this a four star place. I do think the ice cream is better than somewhere like Dairy Queen, but not by much. What makes Page's special is wide variety of options and soft serve flavors. It's also the nostalgia that goes along with it. It's a business that hasn't changed much in it's lifetime, and that's what most people like about it. You can count on Page's to be there every March-October. They're going to offer the same treats you loved as a kid for your whole lifetime.  It represents the change of the seasons and brings back memories for people. It means a lot more to people than just a summertime ice cream stop. \n\nFor those who have never been there, there is no interior so you'll have to eat in your car or standing outside. I prefer to open the back of my SUV, sit there and enjoy the night while I eat my ice cream. The parking lot is hectic and downright scary sometimes. I typically avoid this place on busy nights just for that reason. \n\nBeware, they only accept cash. But there is an ATM on site!",4
1031,"I have been driving by this little bakery for several years now and always wanting to stop in and try it.  Unfortunately, they are usually closed when I have the time to stop.  I was finally lucky enough to find them open at a time when I had a chance to stop and pop in.  The cases were less than half full and I found this a tad disconcerting and so asked the lady behind the counter why they were so empty.  She said they they normally sell out of most of their fare very early in the day.  Luckily, they did have a small yellow cake with butter cream frosting.  I ordered one and took it home.\n\nThe cake was good, but it wasn't as good as some of the other bakeries in the Pittsburgh Metro.  I would never crave it, but I would return if the other bakeries were closed at the time.",3
1032,"Mmmmm. Their Egg drop soup is sooo good as is the General Tso's, and they deliver FAST!",4
1033,Horrible - they use chicken that's been out uncover all day . And they smoke around the food.:(,1
1034,"I gotta give my man Jonathan kudos for some recent changes he's implemented.  The upstairs now has a menu with smaller lighter items for the bar.  I can now finally go here and just grab an app' at the bar without having the customary food coma afterwards after his multicourse feast.  He's upgraded the staff and kept the pro's from the past (marney and errol).  Steve and Clint are good newer additions as server and bartender.  This is only my second 5 star review, probably should deserve 4.5, but wtf it's so obvious he cares and appreciates the business so much.  The food is still great, the patio is nice, the hood' location is still scary and fun and the smaller menu items and additional staff are appreciated.  I do wish he had more options than just italian wine, but last night we were able to find a great white.  The salmon carpaccio last night is the best I've ever had.  The mussels with diablo sauce was also excellent.  I  don't know of any other small restaurant chef in Pittsburgh that takes as much care in the quality of ingredients used (except for Douglas Dick at Bona Terra).  In my original post I said it was a bit pricey, but I've decided it's well worth the cost now.  I also tried a ceviche here that was out of this world.  There's definitely a lot more to have at this italian place than just pasta and red sauce.",5
1035,"The food is unforgettable, but unfortunately so is the bill.  Sicilian themed with fresh ingredients in an intimate setting all prepared in an open kitchen.\n\nAsk before you order a special, or you might be stunned when you are handed the check. But if you love food and money is no object, this is your place. A great place for Valentine's day or a special anniversary splurge, with the emphasis on the word 'splurge'.",4
1036,"Some people train for marathons, other people train for this meal. Before sitting down make sure you get in the proper state of mind and prepare yourself for a long night of indulgence. This being my first dining experience at Alla Famiglia, I was unaware of the challenge that I had undertaken. We had A Party of Five, empty bellies and an optimistic mentality; we couldn't resist the tempting appetizers recited to us and ended up ordering the mega meatball, calamari and shrimp, and sausage over polenta. All were amazing. The meatball was the highlight: twelve ounces of perfectly cooked beef, filled with mozzarella and covered in sauce and provolone (kisses fingers). Big plus for including the tentacles in the calamari. I've noticed these legs less and less while dining out, when did they lose suction as a staple of a calamari appetizer? Also adorning our table were a few clothing options in which to dress the bread, all of them enjoyable on their own or as an ensemble.\n\nOne would think after such a hearty opener all that remained was the main course. How wrong of an assumption that turned out to be. Before we could even think about crushing our dinners, we had to face two formidable courses of salad and pasta. As mentioned by other reviewers, the salad is great. Nice dressing, nice fillers, nice roughage. The pasta that's included with the entree was a fusilli bucati in a vodka sauce served family style. Unable to pass up the promise of a great carbonara with guanciale and fresh egg, we had two pasta opponents to tackle. Both were cooked so perfectly al dente I would have put them on my NHL all-star ballot as a write-in if voting hadn't already closed.\n\nAt this point in the meal, I had completely forgotten that I still hadn't even seen my main course. And I was fine with that. As a table we compiled quite the culinary collection: bistecca fiorentina, veal milanese, veal marsala, mussels in a diavola sauce and the sea bass special for the evening. You know when a meal is so utterly divine that you just stop talking to everyone around you and have a one on one pow wow with the gastro-gods? Yeah, that's what happened. I will say at one point during the meal, my brother had to get up and take a walk around the restaurant for fear he would wake up two days later in the ICU if he didn't fight off the impending food coma that threatened his existence. Instead of napkins they should have given us a white towel and a trainer to throw it on the table for us because we were doing our best impression of Apollo Creed...and our food was Ivan Drago.\n\nOur waiter, who we thought was our friend, then had the nerve to ask if we wanted dessert, some balls on that guy. Of course we wanted dessert. We decided on the tiramisu which I hope had a clean bill of health because it blew our minds. It was so good that I was upset with myself. I did exactly what I hate seeing someone do on any and every food network show. I took a bite, put down my fork, closed my eyes and just said, \""wow!\"" I just hope it was as good for the tiramisu.\n\nOther housekeeping items: you can bring your own wine for which they charge a corking fee. All the water is bottled, but I didn't see it on the bill so I figure it's included. The chef/owner is extremely friendly and accessible, as he is cooking basically right next to your table. Parking at the meters next to the building is free after 6pm, despite what it says on the signs; our waiter informed us they have an unspoken agreement with the parking authority.\n\nHeavy on the belly, heavy on the wallet, heavy in our hearts!",5
1037,Always fantastic.,5
1038,"The menu online gives no prices, and the entrees are ridiculously overpriced for what you get - a good meal, but far too much food, and nothing extraordinary. The entrees are $50 - $60. BE WARNED - if you want atmosphere to go with your $60 entree, you'd better REQUEST DOWNSTAIRS! Otherwise you can have your anniversary dinner in a small room in front of large televisions. Who knew? And the staff will definitely not accommodate your request for a more romantic spot - even if they know it is your tenth anniversary! Wow. Should have walked out.",1
1039,Incredible Italian food. Mushroom appetizer is just phenomenal. So is the mozzarella cheese. Great fish. Expensive but worth it!,5
1040,"Might be the best restaurant I have been to in Pittsburgh! Made reservations on a Friday evening at 9:00PM for two.\n\nApps: The service was great, the server knew all menu items in detail by heart. We started with 2 appetizers my fiance wanted the Calamari and Shrimp that was in a garlic, herb lemon sauce...best shrimp I have ever had, they were colossal! I ordered the Meatball stuffed with bufala mozzarella smothered in a plum tomato sauce, it was unbelievable! \nThe salads course was great and I'm not a salad guy. We were both almost full at this point and we still had the pasta and entree course ahead.\n\nThe Pasta Course: The owner wheels out a cart to our table with a whole wheel of Locatelli Pecorino Romano, in which he will use to make our Cacio e Pepe, table side. He pours 2 portions of linguini on top of the cheese wheel, adding the heavy cream, EVOO and pepper, he mixes and digs into the top layer of the cheese wheel and serves it into our bowls.\n\nEntrees: I ordered the Veal Chop Milanese, I was so full at this point I took 2 bites out of my Veal and couldn't go anymore, but this was the best veal chop I have ever had, had to take the rest home. My Fianc\u00e9, she ordered the Chilean Sea Bass, but was equally as full, the fish was perfectly prepared and melted in your mouth, she took all, but 2 bites home also. Unbelievable experience!!",5
1041,"No better in taste than a Fazoli or even an Olive Garden.  Inflated prices, like the cheapest entree was $40, try to disguise this place as something it is not.  Went with a group of co workers, so we pretty much got everything on the menu and not one thing stuck out really good.  Service is incredibly slow.  Not worth it at all.  Even if you tell yourself that atleast the portions are large, the food is just not good enough to warrant wasting a meal eating there.",1
1042,Fabulous!,5
1043,"good food, we had the bean appetizer, seafood diablo, and the flounder...It is expensive but well worth the money, classic.",5
1044,"I stopped by here this past Thursday with my fiance and 4 other dining companions for dinner.  Alla Famiglia has been on my list of places to try for quite a long time and I was eagerly anticipating eating a dinner here.  We arrived shortly before our reservation time of 7:30 at about the same time as another couple from our party. We were almost immediately taken back to our table which was on the first floor in a back room.  I honestly didn't notice too much while we were walking back to our table but thought there was not much decoration in the room we were in.  Yes there was a fireplace but nothing else really sticks out besides the fact that the lights would dim a bit for about 5 seconds before eventually brightening back up every 10 minutes or so.\n\nSince none of our party had ever been to Alla Famiglia before our server took the time to go over the menu with us.  Whenever he got to the veal chop and explained it was their specialty, I immediately knew that was what I wanted.  So I ended up ordering that with the pizzaiolo option while my fiance went with the seafood diavolo.  My veal chop was described as a double cut natural chop braised with hot and sweet peppers, homemade Italian sausage, and plum tomatoes while my fiances seafood diavola had many different types of seafood in it including a lobster tail.  All entrees also come with a first course of salad and a second course of pasta with vodka sauce, both served family style.  While we were waiting for our first course to come out they served us some crusty Italian bread along with a couple of different dipping sauces of which I remember one that had a couple of different imported cheeses, one with goat cheese and then another which was olive oil based and called the holy oil(?) due to a trio of herbs of which one was basil.  That one was my favorite and when combined with some of the Parmesan cheese that they had on the table was awesome.  After a short while our salads came out, 2 family style bowls for the 6 of us along with a dish of Gorgonzola so that we could top our salads with it.  The salad ended up tasting decent, I only wish that I had more of it.  The six of us quickly finished it all and then were in for quite a bit of a wait before our pasta with vodka sauce arrived.  It was long enough for all of us to notice and wonder what was taking so long for pasta.  Whenever it arrived, once again 2 family style bowls for the 6 of us, I thought that it tasted pretty good.  It wasn't the best vodka sauce I have ever tasted but since I was still pretty hungry at this point I really enjoyed it especially after adding some of the chili oil that they brought to the table with it.  The chili oil gave the sauce that perfect bite for me.  Almost immediately after finishing our pasta our dinner entrees arrived.  My veal chop looked impressive and was big enough to make comments about how it could tip the car on the Flintstones.  Most of that was due to the size of the bone although there was a decent amount of meat on it.  The veal itself was cooked perfectly as it was moist and juicy and I  ended up enjoying it. The pizzaiolo sauce was just ok though as some of the sausage that I had seemed to be burnt while others were fine.  Whenever I had the non burnt pieces I liked it but the couple of burnt pieces really made the sauce inconsistent from bite to bite.  I was also lucky enough to try some of my wonderful fiances lobster tail and thought that it was very good.  It was cooked perfectly and was tender and tasty while not being overdone at all.  After all that we had eaten our whole table ended up passing on dessert and I left the restaurant full but not overly so.  I am still wondering about all of these reviews that tell you how much food they received which was also said by the valet on the way in.  It made me wonder do they normally serve a family style portion to two people instead of the three like they did at our table?  Should I feel cheated on this one?  Maybe I will find out on a future visit but then again maybe I will not.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I might come back here again in the future but I don't think that this would be my first choice.  Don't get me wrong, the food here was pretty good but whenever my food bill after tip is coming out to about $150, they had better either have impeccable service like the Capital Grille or Ruth Chris' or to die for food.  Sadly Alla Famiglia let me down on both accounts here as the food was good and the service average.",4
1045,"Seated in the bar after having made reservations a week in advance. That, paired with a mediocre menu and overall experience, gives this two stars. Save your money and stay in town. I would probably send you to the (gasp) Olive Garden before I referred you here.",2
1046,"Words to the wise:\n1) Don't eat for approximately 3 days before having dinner here.  You'll thank me later.\n2) The bread and fixins (especially the bean and cheese gustoso), while EXTREMELY yummy, pale in comparison to the rest of the meal.  You want to wait for your meal.  Trust me.  YOU want to wait for the homemade pasta.\nThe smaller portions of veal are PLENTY and so unbelievably tender.  Also the preparation is really well balanced.  I had the Escalopes of veal (lots of mushrooms and spinach) and it felt like the veggies were integral to the dish.  Most places would have skimped . . . not Alla Famiglia.\n\nReally good.  So good that I ate till I looked like I had a food baby in my stomach.  Pretty?  No.  Completely worth it?  Yes.",4
1047,"Incredibly authentic Italian cuisine. If your looking for a memorable spot with some of the most delicious actually Italian dishes then look no further than Alla Famiglia. This is a restaurant to celebrate an occasion at such as New Years, Valentines Day, Anniversaries,etc. \nmy girlfriend and I came here for New Year's Eve and we could not have enjoyed it more. To start we had the Alla Famiglia Meatball. I couldn't get over the rich tomato sauce that the meatball was surrounded in and the smoothness of the actual meat. Just delicious, must have.\nWhen you order an entree you also get their house salad served in a homemade Italian vinaigrette (light and complimenting to the diverse salad topped with great peppers!) and their Penne Alla Vodka. This pasta dish alone is enough to warrant a visit . I am a alla vodka lover and this is the best I've ever had. It's hard to describe but its not to rich or creamy it's absolutely just right. The pasta itself was so smooth and melted in your mouth with their sauce.\n\nFor entree my girlfriend had their Ahi Tuna Steak (special). Prepared perfectly and with a great lemon butter sauce. I had their speciality, their double cut Veal Chop. This is something straight out of The Flintstones in its portion but let me tell you it's with every penny. I had the Veal Chop Pizzoaloa style wivh was with hot & sweet peppers, a great tomato sauce covered in provolone cheese. This was such a moist Veal Chop that literally fell off the bone and with the marbling it just melted in your mouth. \nEverything was spectacular , it's a restaurant you have to visit if your in the area at least once given you are willing to spend for your meal. $$$$ but you absolutely get what you pay for.",5
1048,"My boyfriend & I went to Alla Famiglia for our (late) Valentine's Day dinner last night. We don't go out & splurge like this often, so we were really excited for a special dinner. The food was out of this world (bread & sides, salad, pasta alla vodka and veal chop Milanese), but the service was absolute garbage. I've seriously been treated better at a TGIFriday's. We waited, pretty much unattended to, at the bar until 8:20 for an 8:00 reservation. Once seated, I practically had to beg for a wine list. We called a cab at the end of our meal and decided to get drinks & wait back at the bar. The cab was taking forever, so we called a different company. As my boyfriend was talking with the cab company, a waitress walked by. We heard her walk into the kitchen and loudly announce to the rest of the staff, \""UGH, those people at the bar are JUST now ordering a cab.\"" It was 10:30. On a Saturday night.\n\nI don't know if it was the fact that we were some of the youngest patrons in there (early/mid 20s), but we felt talked down to and disrespected the entire time. Maybe if we were in our 50s like everyone else, they would've treated us like adults.\n\nWhen I plunk down $160 for one of the most highly-recommended restaurants around, I expect to be treated like I'm spending $160 at your restaurant. Despite how great the food was, I won't be returning. SO disappointed.",2
1049,Just recently returned. PHENOMENAL meal! Glenn our waiter was superb. Loved the veal dishes.  I also enjoyed the new cocktail menu. One of the drinks was iced coffee with orangicello and frangelica cream. DELICIOUS!,5
1050,"The food was delicious. But it is a ridiculously expensive restaurant. If you're intimidated by spending $100 or more on a complete meal for 1 person, then this is not the place for you. Knowing that we had other plans for our evening, my date and I cut the meal short with appetizers, salad, and a bottle of one of the lesser expensive wines they offer, which was $54 a bottle. Our check was still $120, and we left hungry. Which is a shame, because the little of what we did have, we fully enjoyed. There are plenty of Italian restaurants in Pittsburgh, and many of them are very, very good - where one can enjoy a meal for a fraction of what it costs here.",3
1051,"The first time I went here was with a group - we had reserved the entire restaurant for a retirement party.   I had a horrible experience.  Vowed never to go back!  At that time, I even had a terrible interaction with the owner.\n\nThis time I was invited with a couple of girlfriends because they love it. Decided to try again since it was more about the \""get together\"" than the food/location.\n\nThis time, overpriced food and bad service.  Overall, it was not anything out of the ordinary and not worth the price.   I had the veal speciality.   Large portion, but ok.  Staff was not very attentive for the small amount of customers present.\n\nI am a Pittsburgh native.  This is a bad neighborhood. \n\nI am NOT interested in ever going back!",1
1052,"UPDATED: Just wanted to share that we attempted to visit for a third time when my husband's brother was in town in mid-November of 2014.  We had reservations for 7:30 on a Tuesday, so we obviously figured we would be seated immediately.  The brother and his girlfriend arrived a couple minutes before the reservation and were told to go up to the bar while they set the table and wait for the rest of the party.  I arrived about a minute after and my husband a few minutes behind me as he needed to park due to the lack of valet during the week.  There was no one at the host stand when either of us came in.  So we went up to the bar, declined a drink... and waited, and waited.  The bartender soon became deeply involved in picking a wine for a couple at the bar, not his fault.  The brother eventually was able to flag down a waitress to ask if she could check on our table.  She looked very annoyed.  She eventually went over to the phone at the bar, called down, hung up the phone and said, dead pan, \""no, it's not ready yet.\""  Not a smile, not a sorry, not a \""can we get you a drink on the house?\"" Meanwhile, there was an open table for 4 on that floor.  The bartender eventually told us \""that's for a reservation.\"" \""Yes, we have a reservation... for 25 minutes ago.\""  \""They must have specifically requested that table.\""  They did, however, offer us the table right next to the door on the first floor though - the one with the 10 degree breeze coming in that night.  No thank you.  We were very insulted by the lack of table for our reservation, but more so by the lack of acceptable service.  We decided to leave and spend $20 on pizza instead of $100+ per person and enjoyed much better service.. which is never the way it should be.  Hopefully they solve this problem soon.  We'll give it one more go when the insult has worn off.\n\nMy husband won't hesitate to tell you what his favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh is: Alla Famiglia.  And to be honest, these days I agree with him!  \n\nWhile my husband enjoys many of the more \""up and coming\"" restaurants with smaller portions and interesting flavor combinations, he often finds himself longing for the same quality food with better cuts of meat and bigger portions.  This is where we satisfy both of our appetites for big flavor and, well, big portions.  But to reduce Alla Famiglia to those two things alone would not do it justice.\n\nLet's start out instead with addressing the two biggest critiques of this place: its location and the price.  Yes, it is in Allentown, but they also have plenty of parking and valet if you prefer.  Honestly, we drive almost everywhere to get dinner, so this is not an issue for us.  The other thing I always hear about is how expensive it is.  Some of those complaints come from people who I know have no problem giving their money to the big steakhouse chains, while getting a lot less value.  No, it is not cheap.  You will likely pay upwards of $50 for your entry.  The veal chops are close to $70.  But, that's not all you get.  You get delicious, fresh baked bread, a spread, dipping oil and gustoso for same, a delicious salad, and homemade pasta served family style.  If you wanted to be especially frugal, you could approach this place like an Olive Garden senior special: feast on the freebies and take your entree to go.  But, even if you're full, it may be too difficult not to savor the meal as it comes out...\n\nI've been here twice and my husband has been here three times (lucky - he got to go for work and he said they ordered almost every appetizer, all of which were apparently delicious).  The first time I ordered the filet with gorgonzola.  It was one of the most delicious and largest filets I've ever had.  My husband ordered a veal chop with prosciutto which I don't think I recognized on the current menu, but he absolutely loved it.  The veal chop is one of the largest bone-in cuts of meat I've seen and the sear on it was absolutely perfect.  We also ordered the mussels, which were spicy and delicious, and the meatball appetizer, which I remember being tasty, but nothing too out of the ordinary.  I think there are other things on the menu to try first. \n\nThe second time we came I ordered the Milanese veal chop, breaded, slightly citrusy, and absolutely heavenly.    He had the cowboy ribeye which was also large and an absolutely beautiful cut of meat.  The husband has a thing about fatty cuts and avoiding anything that is the least bit chewy, and he barely had to leave a piece on his plate.  We also got the calamari appetizer, which was perfectly, lightly fried with a savory, garlic sauce that sets it apart from the sweet sauces often served with calamari.\n\nFinally, I should note that the service we have received here has always been exceptional.  Everyone is always professional and courteous.",5
1053,Love it here. The food was great and had anazing service. Will be back again! Everyone was so poliet and greeted us with a smile.,4
1054,"The name is ABC Garden and this is the best Chinese food I've had in Pittsburgh.  This place completely satisfies my Chinese food craving when I want that balance between fried deliciousness and fresh ingredients.  The neighborhood is kinda dodgy but since they deliver (and quick, i might add), there is no need to tread into Sketchville to pick up the delectable Chinese offerings.   Also, there are free extras when you order $20 or more (such as a 2 liter of Pepsi).\n\nUpdate:  Much to my great sadness and disappointment, I have had to stop patronizing this establishment due to the extremely rude and unprofessional man they hired to answer the phone.  We tolerated it the first few times, even got a laugh out of the fact that he actually dropped the F bomb a few times while taking our order.   But when he became hostile and irate with me on a recent order, it was all over.  He started like he always does by laughing at our street name and having me spell it 5 times, then interrupted the order without excusing himself to set down the phone and yell at some children I heard in the background, then he argued with me about what the menu in my hand said, telling me I was wrong and it said something different.  He was aggressive, frustrated, impatient and clearly has some psychological problems.    I had to make the painful decision to give up this place in spite of the lovely fresh vegetables and tofu cooked to perfection.  :(  I'm trying No. 1 Kitchen on Brownsville instead.",3
1055,"Well, the delivery was fast at least. Everything else was yucky. Avoid!",2
1056,"Never thought I would be reviewing a bank, but that's the beauty of yelp! You can review so much more than just restaurants! \n\nI live fairly close to this bank and my parents use dollar bank, which is basically the reason I use them. I have been with this bank for about 8 years or so and have never had a problem with them! I love their free checking and I have a savings account with them as well. Their home equity is awesome too- fixed interest rate of 3.25%. \n\nThis particular branch has very helpful and friendly employees. They have a drive thru and it is always quick and easy. They will even give your dog a treat if they are in the car :). I've also never experienced long lines in this branch which is always nice!",5
1057,"Our experience not so great.  We have mortgage as well as basic free checking and savings with Dollar in Squirrel Hill.  Mortgage application process was brutal.  Starting with the advertised rate of 2.85% being suddenly not available when we decided to lock it in; got 3.01%.  Automatic deduction of mortgage payment was required to secure this rate and it came out of the required Dollar checking account on the first business day of the month.  Free checking is free ... until.  Beware of Funds Availability policy.  We deposit a check monthly at the end of the month.  In August, the end of the month was a weekend and Labor Day was on September 1.  So our check did not get deposited until 9/2.  Mortgage payment hit on 9/2. It was paid, but we were charged $36 insufficient funds due solely to Funds Availability Policy.  After doing this first, Dollar then merrily hits us with two more $36 charges on smaller checks that would have cleared had they been processed before the mortgage payment.  Had we NOT been required to submit to automatic deduction of mortgage, according to our monthly statement, we had at least 10 days grace to make the payment, so Dollar's requirements and policies trapped us into this situation.  Moreover, there was over $3000 in the associated savings account that was ignored.  I called to protest, and one of the $36 fees was waived.  Then I was offered the \""deal\"" of overdraft protection from the savings account for an annual fee plus a $10 transaction fee should this situation ever arise again.  Needless to say, I declined this deal and transferred the savings to the checking account where it sits until I find another bank and then fire Dollar.",2
1058,"I was thrilled to finally find a yelp review with 4 stars and only one dollar sign on Yelp in the South Hills. Moving from LA recently where for some reason EVERYTHING is more expensive... except nail salons! Now, I am by no means, a spa rat but I do like to pamper the toes every now and again. So one afternoon when I had some spare time, I gave them a try. I was totally underwhelmed. From nail polish in the front with dust on it (how long have they been there?) To sitting in a spa chair with ripped upholstery I felt neither pampered nor impressed. I MIGHT have looked beyond such things because of the affordable price till I got home and realized that my nails hadn't been cut short as I had very clearly asked nor had she taking care of an ingrown toenail. A week later I had to cut my own toes and ruin my all right looking pedicure. This place doesn't feel clean or inviting. The decor was junkie and old and cluttered. I will say that everyone was very friendly and they did take me right away when I walked in. I was really pulling for you, Future Nails. But sadly, I don't see you at all in my future. 1.5 Stars",2
1059,If it wasn't for how fast and affordable the place is It would have no stars at all. I got a fill and a fix because I broke a nail. First off they didn't cut down my nails so now they are obnoxiously long. Second off they are so thin I feel like they are just going to crack off.  Not to mention it seems very dirty.. I was very uncomfortable the whole time I was there. One of the nail techs was constantly hitting on me. I will not be returning again.,2
1060,It's pretty average Chinese food. Their egg rolls and dumplings were decent enough as was the Hawaii Five O dish I had was ok too. The service is a little slow as well.,3
1061,"Had Hunan Wok yesterday because it was on my way home. I've heard mixed reviews so I wanted to try it for myself. I tried to peruse the menu before ordering but I couldn't find it online anywhere which is disappointing because the hard copy they have available had at least 300 different options from apps, combos, sides, and entrees. \n\nI got their General Tso's Chicken (extra spicy) and because my order was a take-out over $12, they threw in two free egg rolls. #win \n\n(Other offers are Free 1 Small Fried Rice w/purchase of $16, Free General Tso's or Sesame Chicken w/purchase over $28)  \n\nI called on my way there and it took about 10-15 .... When I walked in, everything was ready to go. Large portion of chicken was served in plastic and rice was in standard paper folder container. They were not stingy about duck sauce, soy sauce, and fortune cookies. #win #win\n\nJust like the reviews below, the General Tso's was just so-so. It definitely wasn't extra spicy but it did have a mild kick to it. To me, the sauce tasted a bit like wing sauce from a dive bar. I would get it again because it was good but it didn't have an oriental flavor to it. When ordering from a strip mall Chinese food place, I always expect each piece of General Tso's to be a quarter chicken and the rest fatty breading to which I dissect and just eat the meat.  My expectations were met but I wasn't disappointed because the chicken was good. \nThe meal had a decent amount of broccoli in it which was cooked perfectly for my taste, a little firmer. \n\nThe egg rolls were OK. Super crispy and not much filling...plenty of oil. They were free and so I can't really complain.  \n\nI will definitely eat here again. I'll probably try Sha Cha chicken because it's spicier or Kung Po. This place is good if you want cheap food that will hit a Chinese take-out craving. \n\nEveryone that worked there was really nice - Even the chef in the back said hello. That alone goes a long way in my opinion. \n\nSide note - It's the day after and I'm not sick so I give my seal of health approval.",3
1062,"I live closeby so I've been there dozens of times. I usually get chicken with broccoli or moo goo gai pan. My sister Vi usually gets moo shoo pork. The food is excellent American Chinese cuisine. The broccoli is always cooked perfectly, it is nice and bright green and firm yet not tough to chew. The chicken breast is always light and lean. Love the garlic white sauce used on the moo goo gai pan. Vi loves the plum sauce. There are several Chinese restaurants in Carrick and Mt. Oliver and I'd rate this one the best. I wish the broth used in the wonton soup was a bit richer and the egg rolls would be better if they were lighter.",3
1063,Had chicken salad. Was good but very pricey. Their pizza is about 20-30% more expensive than any comparable pizza in the area. And since the pizza is just mediocre it is definitely not a good value so I'll pass!,2
1064,"Yesterday I had the misfortune of getting a pizza from Bishops. It was my first time getting a pizza from there in a long time. Needless to say. I won't be getting one again. I got a pepperoni and sausage pizza. The pizza was bland , tasteless. Crust tasted like frozen pizza crust. The sauce was meh. Cheese was okay. Sausage was disgusting. Bishops used to use a delicious hot sausage. I don't know what this sausage was other then disgusting. I don't recommend getting a pizza from Bishops",1
1065,"The customer service is absolutely horrible. They made me wait an hour before anybody got to me, and there were 3 available beauticians in the back. I complained and got waited on right away. I thought the customer always came first. Why would they want to risk a customer not coming back. I mean I can just go down the road to Borics. These women are old middle aged miserable employees with no passion for their jobs. I won't be back. DISAPPOINTED...:(",1
1066,Open 24hrs on Friday and Saturday how can you not love it. Total old school mom and pop diner. Wouldn't recommend anything other than breakfast. On top of everything else it cost nickels and dimes to eat here. After you've blown all your money at a bar in southside you'll still have enough to eat away some of your drunkness on the way home.,4
1067,"My first trip here was on a Sunday at 4pm. I was surprised to see I was the only customer. We were met by friendly staff took our choice of seat and gazed at the menu. I wanted a verity so I picked the 2 pancakes, 2 eggs, toast, sausage or bacon.\nI ordered my eggs scrambled and sausage links. I also ordered home fries and a glass of white milk. I could smell my food cooking as I waited anxiously ( I was starving)\nMy food was ready in about 8 minutes and looked tasty.\n\nAll in all good bargain and equal food quality I'll give them 2 stars.\nLike a Pirmantis it would probably be better if I had been drinking.",2
1068,"I recently bought my first motorcycle (a 2001 KTM Duke II) and found Bohn's when searching online for KTM dealers. I went in with the intention of buying a jacket, helmet and gloves. Their store is pretty nice inside, and they have a good selection of gear (mostly dirt-oriented though). \n\nI wasn't quite sure what I wanted, so I asked a lady for some assistance in picking out a helmet. She was helpful, and recommended a jacket that would be usable in different types of weather. However, a friend who was with me said he had a different type of jacket (which they also sold), and she commented that the \""hated\"" that jacket and that the liner was \""nothing more than a glorified garbage bag.\"" Ok...\n\nWe also talked to a guy at the register about a '96 KTM 300 MXC that my friend just bought, and asked a simple question about a clutch cable. The guy seemed totally disinterested and clueless, and I'm not really sure if he even knew what a clutch was. He ended the conversation by saying that my friend should just throw his bike away because it was so old. What!?\n\nEven after that, I still bought a jacket from them and ordered a helmet I liked that they had assured me would be in later that week. I then got a call from them a few days later saying that the helmet was no longer available, but that I could pick another style. I then just ordered the helmet online and went back the next day to get a refund.\n\nI wanted to like this place, but between the thinly-veiled insults and seemingly clueless repair staff, I don't think I'll ever return. Their prices and selection are pretty decent, so if you are in the area and know what you want, it might be OK to stop by and pick something up. If you have any alternative, though, I would avoid this place.",2
1069,"I'm in the market for a fun little scooter to have fun and commute on, and at the suggestion of a friend, I went to Bohn Cycle Shop to check out what they had in the shop. Immediately upon walking in, it took 15 minutes for someone to ask if we were helped. When I mentioned that I wanted to learn more about a Zuma over in the corner, the dude at the desk was disinterested and unhelpful.\n\nWhen I tried to pay for the scooter and roll it out, an older woman stewed around and gave me annoyed looks for coming into the store and not calling ahead. When I tried to pay with a bank-issued check, I had to wait around for nearly 20 minutes before they told me that they have never seen a bank-issued check and sent me on my way.\n\nThe entire time I was there, it felt like they thought I just stole a bunch of money and were treating me like a crook. I am definitely not going back to complete the transaction. If I'm going to be buying an expensive piece of machinery, I really expect the service to at least be a little more enthusiastic.\n\nLike Nick T. said, I guess it's a good place if you wanna grab a used bike or know exactly what you want. If you're looking to broker a new bike, go to a bigger shop with salesmen that actually sound like they're living beings.",1
1070,I usually love this place but it's gone bad. Went to one in wv the other day and it was good. I think different owners. My beef this one is the cheese. Very pour quality. Bread and sauce still good though.,3
1071,"I am kind to all service workers! always! This place has the worst service I have ever seen. I do not expect four star treatment from fast food but this place is ridiculous. You better check your bag because they are going to forget something. Yesterday my husband went to get a quickie family fish dinner. He was told that no sorry we are out of hushpuppies and Pepsi. Okay thats fine but what can we have to replace the hushpuppies? He was told to go down the street there is a store. This is inside, not the drive thru. It seems that this is a common experience at this restaurant. I already sparingly frequent fast food establishments but this will definitely be the last attempt. And yes I have contacted the corp. I dont want anything from them though, they can keep it.",1
1072,"The service here can be hit-or-miss, but more often than not, I don't have problems. Usually, when my friend and I stop by, we're waited on by the same server, and our food comes up relatively quickly. It's always fresh, too. Unfortunately, when they get busy, it creates problems because they don't have a stock of anything prepared, which in turn creates delays. Their cashiers have a habit of walking away from the counter in the evening, leaving customers waiting for however long it takes them to notice someone is standing there. While I understand that they have to clean up the restaurant for closing, there should always be someone to watch the counter.\n\nAs a side note, their drive-thru speaker went down about a month ago and still hasn't been repaired. It creates delays at the drive-thru window for placing orders, especially later in the evening due to above mentioned cashier habits.",2
1073,"Someone please change the cooking oil!! With the construction on Rt. 51, it has been a very long time since I decided to put up with the craziness that makes up this intersection. A nagging for fried fish however, sent my daughter, and me to this LJS. Mistake number 1 was ignoring the deserted parking lot. Mistake number 2, was placing an order at the drive thru, and eating our 2 piece fish and more dinners, after the smell of old cooking oil put a damper on our nagging for fried fish.\n\nThe service at the drive thru was friendly, the girl at the window friendly, but the smell of old cooking oil, not so much. Not a soul in sight at this LJS. Yes, there are other places to get great fried fish, and after our experience, perhaps it's time to let this LJS walk the plank off our list. The fish was edible, not the usual crunchy, crumbly LJS fish. The hush puppies were soggy from either drowning in old oil too long, or sitting under heat lamps too long. The fries, endured the same sad torture as the others. Cheap, yes, but not worth the money, or Rt. 51 traffic anymore.",2
1074,It has rebounded from when it closed in 08 and now does some veg stuff along with the bar food. I'd still much rather eat up the street at Max's though.\n\nThat said the clientele is nice/colorful & im glad it's reopened.,3
1075,"I love this place.  They'll all know your name after the second or third visit and people tend to be very welcoming and open without being too \""Cheers-y\""\n\nFood is above average for a bar, especially the Middle Eastern selections.",4
1076,This is one of my favorite bars in Pittsburgh. They have  been getting a lot of bands to play. Especially font of the Wednesday night Blue Grass jam night. The hummus is great. The staff is exceptionally friendly and knows my name. They have a great beer selection too.,5
1077,"I went to Park House after much internal deliberation. And after reading all the high reviews from fellow yelpers. \n\n  This bar is less than 5 minutes from where I live.  I stopped in on a Saturday night and was pleased with the music that was playing and also the fact that the bar was not overcrowded. The bar tender barely acknowledged me the whole night.  \n\nThere wasn't any free peanuts or popcorn when I visited. Nor did they have the beer that I like on tap.  I did get a very tasty double chocolate stout, which I found to be delicious in every way.  The owner of the place even gave me an annoyed look.\n\nSaturday night is usually a crappy night to try out any new place.  The service was slow but I got the feeling that the bartender couldn't be bothered to wait on me.  \n\nI haven't completely written this place off.  I'll just try again during the week.",3
1078,"Went my first time for Thursday karaoke and had a blast!  They serve mediterranean fare; at least half the menu is vegetarian/easily vegan.  There are at least 2 bike racks outside, cars have decent options too.  At 10pm an improv comedy group showed... you can imagine the energy.  Super fun night, met some cool people, ate healthy food.  Oh yes, and it's no smoking!     \n\nDownside?  It's a little pricey, but the quality is there, so... you decide.",4
1079,"Really great place to go. There was bluegrass music playing when I went which was a pleasant surprise. It wasn't too loud, so you could talk with others at your table. The food and service was great. Definitely want to come back here again",5
1080,"This place is like none other! Bar, yes-but so much more! Great food! Great people! It's the Pittsburgh CHEERS with a kick of Healthy! YEP-I said healthy. For example-the menu is limited, but everything is great!! How about trying the Golani Platter-veggie dish with wonderful spices! Hummus, pita, feta and an amazing spinach patty -the likes I've never had before!\n\nLove it there and would encourage those interested in a bar atmospher with a twist to try it. You won't be disappointed.",4
1081,"Good beer, Wednesday night is banjo night which always draws a crowd. Definitely a hipster bar. Food is fresh & worth trying. Get a dish that includes the house humus.",3
1082,"I was here for the well-known bluegrass night on a Wednesday a couple weeks ago and had a pretty good time. A friend met up with me here and we were able to enjoy the live music close to the bar and actually meet a few of the locals. I enjoyed the crowd- it seemed to mostly consist of 20 and 30 somethings, a bunch of bros, some couples, single girls and guys. We got some of the hummus, which was pretty good. If someone invited me, I'd definitely stop in again. $2 Yuenglings for the bluegrass night (that's reason enough to stop in again, right?).",3
1083,"I had heard a lot about their food and decided to check it out one night after purchasing a Groupon. This review is strictly for the food. It was not good. The hummus was okay, and our main plate seemed to be microwaved. \n\nThe bar ambiance seemed cool though. So if you are looking for a bar atmosphere, I'd probably rate this 3.5 stars. For dinner, not that great.",2
1084,"Unfortunately, I was not all that impressed with Bernie's.  It's a shame it's the only real photography store in the city, but they could definitley do better.\n\nAs part of a black and white photography class, I needed to pick up film and photo paper, among a few other things.  While Bernie's had everything I needed (and lots of other supplies) I didn't feel all that appreciated for coming in.  I spent a couple hundred bucks and felt like I was being shuffled out the door as quickly as possible.\n\nI will give the one guy at the counter some credit because a woman right before me asked to get a roll or two of film developed in just barely an hour.  I could tell he wanted to get to it quickly, but still felt like I was hassling the guy just being there.\n\nI hate to see real camera stores shut down, but unless I'm in a pinch I'm probably going to order supplies online from now on.",2
1085,"I had a totally mixed experience with Bernie's, which may explain the other reviews. \n\nI have a DSLR that I got from my father - it had never been cleaned or adjusted. It had been having some trouble with the battery, so I took it to the only place in Pittsburgh (apparently) that will help with this. A dark-haired guy greeted me as I walked in and treated me like a total noob, and his demeanor made me feel like the dirt under his shoes. However, he did give me good information and service about my camera when prompted by another man in the shop (who I might assume is Bernie). \n\nThey told me they could send it to the manufacturer where they'd clean it for a couple hundred bucks, but instead they cleaned out the sensors and the lens right there at the counter and checked the contacts between the lens and the camera. The dark-haired guy showed me through a magnifying glass what I was looking at, and explained that some spots I saw in the viewfinder were inside the top of the camera and wouldn't appear on the pictures. The other guy (Bernie?) explained to me some of the functions of the camera -- I knew these already, but it was nice to hear them explained and he showed me a few examples. They advised me to get a UV filter to protect my lens, which I knew was overpriced but I happily bought anyway to pay for their service. \n\nSo I think the kind of experience you get depends entirely on the person you run into. I can see how someone would be put off by the dark haired guy I ran into first, and how someone would absolutely love the service from the other guy. All in all I'm pleased with my encounter with this shop, but I probably won't buy anything from there considering how overpriced it was -- however, if something goes wrong or I need any service, I'll definitely go back.",3
1086,"Up-charges most of their products that you can find on B&H for way less money. Sales person treated me like I was a very inexperienced. Not a bad place if you're in need of camera gear without a moments notice, but overall definitely order offline.",2
1087,"I developed my 120 film here the other day, and they charged me an extra 4 dollars a roll for no reason.  On the website they say $8 but they charged me $12.  The owner is very pretentious and rude.  When I told him that it says 8 dollars online he didn't care at all.  When I dropped my film off the high school kid didn't even tell me the price because \""it is too much for me to calculate\""  Also, the photo equipment, darkroom equipment and film are way over priced.  I am never going back to this place.  I strongly urge everyone to never enter or deal with Bernie's Photo.  Rather, use the websites of companies like B&H, Adorama, or Calumet.  The have MUCH better customer service and better prices.  Very disappointed that this is the only photo store in the city.",1
1088,"Went in to buy a cold shoe adapter in a pinch on my way to a shoot. He charged me $20 for the same exact item that sells for $6.29 at B&H. I bought it without thinking, as I was stressing on the way to a gig, but was furious when I thought about it in the car.\nUnfortunately, this is the only game in town. Makes me glad I live in New York City. You would think a store in a dying industry would thrive to provide better customer service, pretty much the only reason why I would go to a small store rather than a big one. They don't even offer that.",1
1089,"Just stopped in to see about selling my Canon Rebel T3 to buy a 60D (that they don't have in stock because it's \""old\""). I was offered $50 for my T3, that is currently being sold online for over $300. I asked why such a low price and was told that since it was an older model it wasn't worth as much. Needless to say, I walked out with my T3. Sucks that this is the ONLY camera shop in Pittsburgh.",1
1090,"Crap!  I can't believe that I missed a \""First to Review\"" by just a matter of weeks.  Max's Allegheny Tavern has been a shining star and a \""must\"" for my Pittsburgh rotation of places to visit.  Years ago, when I worked on the Northside for Heinz, I spent many a rowdy Friday night here in the basement with factory workers.  \n\nWhat's there to say?  It's a Northside institution and always has a mixed crowd that is super cool and friendly.  The bartenders are friendly and manage to remember my name and drink choice even though I'm here only a few times a year.  My Friday nights here must have made quite an impression!  I love the decor here, dark wood paneling with lots of stained glass, and the downstairs bar is where the naughty people hang.  Jukebox and room for dancing.  The food is very homey and very reasonably priced.  The German nachos are always worth ordering, and they are smothered with Gouda cheese.  The spatzle is also a creamy indulgent treat.  And for those seeking the real Deutsch culinary experience, they have a large variety of sausages and schnitzels.  So it's a sausage factory in more ways than one.",5
1091,"Despite living in PIttsburgh for most of my life, I've somehow managed to never eat at Max's Allegheny Tavern until recently.  \n\nMy initial impression of the restaurant was positive - the place had an old neighborhood feel to it, a small crowd was drinking at the end of the antique hardwood bar, and the German murals on the walls made me crave an icy-cold German lager with a stout head of foam.  I thought about how well German potato salad would taste with that beer.  So I grabbed a seat at the bar and eagerly awaited the first taste of my beer.\n\nAnd I waited...and waited...and waited some more - for over 15 minutes before someone came around to take the order.  Actually that isn't quite accurate.  Two employees came around - one to the end of the bar, and one behind the bar directly opposite me.  Both of them stared at me.  Neither one greeted me or asked me what I would have like to order.  I stared back, incredulously, and even made a \""what's going on here\"" palms-extended-upward-shoulder-shrug gesture.  Neither one took the hint.\n\nFinally a third employee came around the bar and took my order.  Great, I thought to myself, finally that beer.  She served the beer in a Mason jar.  WTF?!?  Who serves imported German lager at a German restaurant in a freaking Mason jar?  Max's does.  The beer was devoid of its head, likely the result of a bad beer pour and/or a less than perfectly clean glass (an endemic problem with Pittsburgh restaurants, in my observation).  I was sad.  I quaffed my beer quickly in an attempt to salve my irritation and opened the menu.\n\nMy first impression of the menu can be summed as follows: \""Uh-oh\"".  The menu is huge with a number of \""slow-food\"" stews and braises.  The restaurant is more than half-empty.  How can a restaurant prepare such a large number of menu items, including more than a few labor-intensive dishes, freshly every day and still stay in business when the place isn't even half-full?  Answer: They can't.  The food isn't fresh.\n\nI ordered the Wiener Schnitzel.  I love properly prepared Wiener Schnitzel.  Made with fresh butterflied veal breast, slightly pounded and seasoned, well-coated in fresh bread crumbs, and pan-fried in clarified butter until golden brown on the outside and juicy on the inside, Wiener Schnitzel is the ultimate comfort food.  \n\nSadly, Max's Wiener Schnitzel had nothing to do with properly prepared Schnitzel.  The veal was super-thin, had a texture that strongly suggested it had been mechanically processed, and tasted as if it was pre-breaded and frozen.  It wasn't pan fried either.  The breaded, frozen, puck was simply dropped into a fryolater - where the breading puffed out and fell off of the meat in places (which doesn't happen when the cutlet is resting against the cooking surface under its own weight as when the dish is properly pan-fried).  The edges of the sad Schnitzel had curled up and it looked a horrible mess on the plate.  Curly Schnitzel?!?  My stomach dropped.\n\nMy sides, German potato salad and braised red cabbage, were equally awful.  The German potato salad had an unnatural glossy sheen - the kind that typically comes from bottled sauces that contain high fructose corn syrup.  The \""bacon\"" in the dressing was nothing more than tiny flecks of some sort of processed, possibly faux, \""meat\"".  The potatoes were suspiciously uniform in thickness and roundness - exactly the homogeneity that is found in pre-peeled, pre-sliced, vacuum-sealed processed potatoes.  It was a gluey, sickly sweet, mess.  I didn't have more than a bite or two.  The braised red cabbage didn't taste fresh - it tasted like it had been sitting in a steam table for a day or two and my order was its last chance to be eaten.  \n\nMax's Allegheny Tavern bills itself on their web site as, \""The Best in German Fare.  The Best in Service\"".\n\nThat's total bullshit.  It's awful - both for service and fare.\n\nIf you want good, authentic, German fare (in which the Schnitzel is properly pan-fried to order and delicious), join the Teutonia Mannerchor down the street.  \n\nI'll never return.",1
1092,"I like this restaurant so much I had my wedding rehearsal dinner here.  (Both the families liked the food very much.)  Max's is the best German food in Pittsburgh -- actually, it's the best German food I've had outside of Germany, and I've definitely had worse meals in Germany as well.\n\nMax's is in a restored hotel, and the decor is very much in the Victorian style of the original hotel building.  The exception is the bar area that's good for happy hour or watching a game, or just having a beer -- that has a lot of neon and a jukebox.  But the bar area is also tasteful and pleasant to be in.  Max's has a full bar, but their real specialty is their excellent selection of German beers, both in bottles and on tap.\n\nI haven't met a wurst I didn't like, and they're pretty much all offered here.  The Braunschweiger sandwich is pretty delicious and unique in my experience, and the schnitzels are very delicious as well.  Another specialty is the kase spatzle (Spatzle noodles with smoked Gouda cheese -- a twist on mac and cheese that ensures that even a picky child will have something to enjoy here), but my two favorite menu picks here are the hassenpfeffer and the spinach salad with warm bacon dressing.  For sides, the red cabbage salad is my favorite, although the sauerkraut is also very good.  I don't care for the German potato salad, however -- I like the kind that has caraway seeds and vinegar, and is served cold, but Max's offers the kind that has an unidentifiable sauce and is served warm.  Some people like that style of potato salad though, and from what I can tell, Max's does a decent rendition of it.\n\nIf you're looking to reserve a room here for a banquet, you have a lot of options.  The basement \""Rathskellar\"" is more bar-like in its atmosphere.  It would be a good place for some guys to have a birthday party or something.  For a rehearsal dinner or other formal event, one of the upstairs banquet rooms would be better.  Depending on the size of your group, you can arrange to have a buffet-style dinner, or individuals in the group can order directly off the regular dinner menu.",5
1093,"Real german food (sausage, etc) and decent beer in family friendly atmosphere.\n\nThis is one of the good joints.",4
1094,"I must of been eating at another Max's in a pararell universe!\n\nFood was terriable, service was worse! Went and got Sushi!",1
1095,"Definitely my favorite German restaurant, this place brings back memories.... often a bit negative as it's right near the hospital... yes, my Mom took me there after my arm breaking fiasco, that time I got hit by the car, etc., etc. (I was obviously an uncoordinated child), but also wonderful as I could literally lose myself in their vast array of tasty foods.  It's definitely a North Side staple, and the atmosphere has a \""well worn\"" appeal with old pictures of the local Germanic community and of the area.  This place has it's own personality, which is a plus in my opinion!\n\nAs for the food... well, you can't find much better German food than this and at this price!  Both of my parents favor the peasant platter.  Me, I love the stuffed pretzel appetizer, all the different sausages (the weisswurst is amazing!), and their kasespatzle (thick, doughy egg noodles with butter and cheese).  I will always associate Max's with the best, most flavorful German food at an affordable price!",5
1096,"Visiting from San Francisco. Food was mediocre at best. Bland is the best description.  Sausages and  Weiner Schmitzel were unremarkable. Best was the sweet & sour cabbage that accompanied. But also served were over-boiled 'daily vegetable' of snap peas, asparagus, and red peppers.... to the point that they were losing their color. Good beer. Yes it has old photos of days gone by... but really there seemed no joy here now...",2
1097,"Not only does this place have a very nice atmosphere, the food is good (and cheap) too!\nFor under 10 dollars a person we each got:\n-A drink\n-A Bradtwurst sausage\n-2 giant potato pancakes, served with sourcream (note that these are NOT latkes)\n-A huge bowl of saurkraut, which also contained some pork and cranberries.\nDelicious home-baked bread, which was served with some saurkraut (prepared differently than the side) and apple-butter sauce.\n\nYUM!\n\nIt's hard not to like this place. I'm still having cravings for those pancakes :(",5
1098,"Great atmosphere of a neighborhood pub, good German beer selection, but food was less than mediocre.  Won't be back. Weisswurst was very bland.  Sauerbraten was dry and tasteless.  Spaetzle was, well, not tradidional German Spaetzle.  Schnitzel and purple cabbage  were the high points, but then again, it's hard to screw up a fried veal cutlet.",2
1099,"After a long day at work I met up with a friend for some German fair on the northside. I don't get out to this neck of the woods that often so it was a treat for me! All appetizers are  $2.99 during happy hour so we went with the Potato pockets which were perogies in my book. They were crispy and creamy, and topped with fried onions. They also had a side of french onion sour cream. Pretty tasty stuff! Plus they gave you so many I could have filled up just on the app. I ordered the Bell's Oberon while my dining partner ordered the sampler. I have to say that she wasn't that impressed with the brew. \""Dirty pipes\"" and I quote. I had the same taste from my order so I focused on the food.\n\nWe both ended up ordering Max's Goulash that was suggested by another Yelper! You can't go wrong when you have that recommendation. This is not our small town neighborhood goulash made from egg noodles and a mix with ground beef. The noodles in this feast were homemade and chunky, piled high with a peppery meaty sauce infused with fall off the fork beef, carrots, peas, and tiny pearl onions. If you remember yesterday was a cold, rainy, gloomy day. This was real comfort and I had to take it to go. Rain is still in the forecast so leftovers will be grand!",3
1100,I really like this Northside institution.  They serve the beer in jars and I had Spaten German beer- very good.  They put really buttery free popcorn on the table so be careful- the grease sticks to your fingers.  In the bar they have an old fashioned player piano.  I really like the German fare- big portions. The schitzel is good but not great but overall way better than Hofbrauhaus and not Disney- it's the real McCoy.,4
1101,"A Pittsburgh tradition.  Try the Cheese stuffed pretzel appetizer, Count Esterhazy Schnitzel, and Apple Strudel (of course) for dessert.  Yum",5
1102,"I've been going to Max's off and on for 31 years (I KNOW!  How could someone as young as I am been going there for THAT long?)    And I am not from nor ever lived in the North Side!\n\nThat said...i have always loved the food and the place.   I was great the first time and was great last night!   Most of the mains can be recommended without reservation....last night I had roasted pork with dressing and gravy.  It was deliscious!    As for sides....I ALWAYS have potato pancakes and sweet and sour cabbage.  (Because of my eastern european background I am partial to both cabbage and potatoes.   Do not be afraid of the cabbage unless you dislike sour! \n\nWe didn't have dessert, but did have beer and drinks.   They have a nice selection.\n\nMy only complaint was that the food was slow to come out.   It was a busy Friday night and I wasn't going anywhere so I had anover beer.   No big problem.\n\nGive Max's a try.....it might make your favorite like it did mine!",4
1103,The goulash was (sickeningly) sweet and the bread pudding wasn't sweet at all.  But the atmosphere is kind of cool.  And the prices are downright cheap.,3
1104,"Let me preface this by saying that my understanding of goulash came from what my mom called goulash.  Goulash in the Contrucci household was made of elbow noodles, beef and spaghetti sauce.  I guess you can't believe everything your parents tell you right?  \n\nSo going in here, I was thinking, great...mom's goulash!  What was set in front me looked NOTHING like what I was used to.  It was a mish mosh of veggies,noodles, gravy and some random unidentifiable food items.  I usually eat whatever is put in front of me, so I wasn't scared to dive it.  Sadly, I just didn't like it.  I thought it was actually not very appetizing at all.  I know, I know, this is like \""world famous\"" goulash, but I was NOT into it!  \n\nWhat I was into was the German Potato Salad.  I love it, and honestly, I feel like I never get the same version of it anywhere in the Burgh.  This was a no frills version, with scallop sliced potatoes and a thick vinegar sauce.  Maybe a bit too much, but not enough for me to eat it all!  \n\nWould I go back? If someone else really wanted to go there, but I wouldn't suggest it nor would I go on my own.  Oh well, on to the next one right?",2
1105,"I have been going to Max's for 20 years.  I love this place.  The Einlauf soup is just simple good eats, but if you're ever there when the soup special is beer cheese - ORDER IT!!.  I love their potato pancakes, sauerbraten and the basket of German rolls served with sauerkraut salad and apple butter.  The waitresses have been there for years, they are the best!  Most delicious long island iced tea in the city.",5
1106,"This is my favorite restaurant on the Northside, possibly favorite restaurant in all of Pittsburgh.  I tell all my friends that this little restaurant is the best kept secret in Pittsburgh.  Max's is a quaint little German place that always has plenty of seating, even on Friday and Saturday nights.  The service is good.  The food is great, I always end up getting the potato pancakes.  If you are looking for a place to check out that isn't going to be as crowded and will be more \""authentic\"" German food than other places you should definitely come to Max's!",5
1107,"Excellent German food.  I went in for an early lunch, the service was great.  Had a whole feast of great dishes.  The best sauerkraut i've ever had -- subtle, with caraway.  Sweet and sour cabbage, potato salad, spaetzle, a great weisswurst, and a great wheat beer on tap.",5
1108,"I honestly can't get enough of this place.  We used to come here after going to Pirates games since its right up the road.  Now its one of my favorite places to go out with my friends.\n\nIts a bit pricey (~$15/person), but the quality and quantity is superb.  The service is pretty good.  The atmosphere has a nice feel to it, perhaps its the antiquity.. I love the cuckoo clock and tapestries they have.\n\nNow, to the food:\nThe bread they give you... with apple butter!! ... is very fresh and tasty.  Try not to fill up on it while waiting on your huge main course.. The Bavarian soft pretzels were warm and soft when we ordered them.  Also delicious.\n\nThe sampler platter is a great deal if you don't know yet what you like.  You get 3 entrees and the typical sides for ~$16.  My favorite, though, is the schnitzel liechtenstein, with sauerkraut and potato pancakes.  Fresh and delicious everytime.\n\nI would definitely recommend this place to anybody who likes ethnic, or German/Bavarian food, or just trying new stuff.  It's awesome.",5
1109,"I really thought I'd never be back.  The goulash I had was so so gross.  But then,  was roped in by some friends who were doing a Sunday brunch book club.  Of course I couldn't miss out on tantalizing conversation... so I obliged.  \n\nI really had no clue what they offered for brunch options, but quickly learned they have a a pretty decent size brunch buffet.  I'm not below buffets at all, it's the fat kid in me!  Most things still looked a little questionable to me, but I went for the big ticket items.  Make your own omelets, potato pancakes and dessert.  I'd hit up the buffet again, but still be hasty to check out the regular menu again.  \n\nThe omelet was made right in front of you, so I added cheese, mushrooms, peppers, tomatoes and onions.  I was super excited about it because it was the size of a football.  Sadly, it was pretty tasteless.  I don't think they added any salt or pepper to the egg mix, so it came out really bland, despite loading up on ingredients.  \n\nBut the potato pancakes... I could survive on them forever.  They were amazeballs!  Add some sour cream and I was in potato patch heaven!  I had to keep myself from getting more because of the other thing I loaded up on... dessert.  \n\nThe desserts looked unassuming, but they were also awesome.  I had a smattering of delectable bites.  The scones were so moist and tasty.  I had to stop myself from taking more than 20.  I also had some carrot cake, brownies, cookies among other things I inhaled and didn't pay attention too.  Should I be embarrassed?  Probably.  But I don't care because it was darn good!",3
1110,"Our dinner here was a nice experience.  We were going to a concert and when we arrived many people were waiting to be seated.  We were told to expect a half hour wait.  We sat at the bar and had a drink and in what must have been only ten minutes we were asked if we would mind eating at a booth in the bar area rather than wait for the dinning room.  We were thrilled, because we were considering eating at the bar.  The booth worked out just fine.  It wasn't too noisy and  we got served quickly.  Even though there were several specials that tempted us, we both ordered the best thing on the menu - their J\u00e4ger Schnitzel, with sides of hot German potato salad and sweet and sour cabbage.  I had a German black lager and my wife a glass of wine.  The basket of assorted rolls comes with delicious apple butter and sauerkraut relish, both very tasty.  The schnitzel is quite large, and we only made it about halfway thru when we asked for a to-go box.  We're looking forward to finishing it here at home.  Maybe next time we'll try something different....but probably not!\nPros: inexpensive, very tasty schnitzels\nCons: no reservations for parties under 5",3
1111,been here a number of times and it's my favorite German food in Pgh!,4
1112,"What to eat for dinner? Hmmm, a nearby German restaurant sounds good (and it was). There's nothing extraordinary to get into detail about so:\n\n1 star for free street parking\n1 star for ample seating/tables\n1 star for friendly service\n1 star for a very good meal\n\nSimple, yet effective. Danke.",4
1113,"The food isn't as good as it once was.  The atmosphere is kind of dark and needs to be updated.  We ordered potato pancakes that had to be returned because they somehow tasted fishy (I don't even want to speculate).  The other items we ordered were ok. Staff is great, very friendly and attentive.",3
1114,"Not sure why my review was flagged but I can assure that I,m not an employee or another restaurant making trouble for a competitor, just an average consumer that lives on the Northside .\n         When will I ever learn. I really want to like this place. It's a cool building with neat old fashion feel to it. But the food is mediocre at best.The last time I was there I got what they called German goulash. I have had this made for me by real German cooks so I have a good idea what it's supposed to taste like and this isn't it. It was made from pork instead of beef with frozen peas and carrots. The gravy wasn't a rich and savory, it was canned or packaged with I don't even know what spices in it. When I complained to the waitress she said that most people don't like it either. She asked me if I wanted something else but I was in a hurry and ate the meat after I scraped the gravy off of it. I have been to this place 1 or 2 times a year and I have had undercooked potato pancakes, greasy rubins and cold sausages. The only thing I can say is really good is the spinach salad with warm bacon dressing. It is a bit over priced for the size, but it is always really good.\n\nSunday brunch\nA neighbor talked me into going here for the brunch and I was glad she did. For an all you can eat brunch they do a nice job keeping things stocked and fresh. The omelet chef was very good making stuff just as you asked him for, yum. The sausage is great and the bacon is cooked in a range of doneness that everyone can find. So, for dinner and lunch my original 2 stars stand but the Sunday brunch is a solid 4 1/2 stars.",2
1115,"My husband and I have been to this restaurant many times over the past 20 years and went for sandwiches tonight. Sorry to say it was the worst food we have ever eaten at this place. Reuben sandwich was greasy and had little meat. Sweet potato fries were not edible. We ate at a table at the bar and told Andy our bartender but got zero satisfaction. Since we've had such a bad experience and no effort by the restaurant to remedy a BAD MEAL, be warned!",1
1116,"I work on the North Shore and have heard many coworkers rave about Max's.  When I finally tried it, I wish I had not waited so long.  Entering Max's is like going into your grandmother's living room.  Very welcoming and nostalgic.\n\nThe menu is bigger than I expected with a variety of traditional appetizers and sandwiches along with a large selection of German items.  Everything from multiple varieties of schnitzels, sausages, chickens and a sampler platter that lets you choose a combination of all of the above.  All of the items we tried were full of flavor and served at the perfect temperature.  Speaking of being full, the food is very rich so you will leave with a full stomach.  \n\nThey have a good selection of beers and even offer a sampler option.  The dessert selection looked delicious, but we were beyond stuffed so will have to savor them on a future visit.  I can't wait to go back!",5
1117,"This is americanized German food.  For real German food, go to Hofbrauhaus and ask for a schnitzel.",3
1118,"I've been here once because this was an easy place to meet for dinner with a friend. I enjoyed eating here well enough.\n\nI'm honestly not a die-hard fan of German food, although I guess that wouldn't have mattered: a peak at the menu beforehand revealed that this place's menu is mostly Americanized - proof of this is the fact that my salad was topped with French fries (only in Pittsburgh...). Trust me, even if you don't really like German food, there'll at least be a sandwich you'll like here.\n\nThinking about my usual \""overall\"" summary, I have to say this place wasn't bad and served as a reasonable place to meet - the beer menu looked nice from what I saw and the atmosphere was pretty cozy and even nostalgic and homely - but man, the dining options really weren't that extraordinary. I'm still torn as to how to feel about its menu, because on the one hand obviously it being Americanized meant even I could find something to enjoy, but on the other I feel bad for the people who do like German food and may not be getting what they hope for. \n\nIt wasn't bad enough that I'd say don't try it and see - just understand it may not be exactly what you expect.",3
1119,"I went to Max's for the first time with my family a few weeks ago. I ordered the kielbasa sandwich with a side of kase spaetzle. The kielbasa on the sandwich was topped with a serving of sauerkraut and served on a toasted roll.  It was your average kielbasa sandwich. Satisfying, but nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nThe kase spaetzle however was noteworthy and delicious. It was smothered in gouda cheese sauce and I love me some gouda! I ate it all and I would have licked the plate if it were socially acceptable. \n\nAs for the environment, the restaurant is housed in what looks like what might of used to be a house back in the day. It had lots of little dining rooms. The decor was kind of outdated, but I think that's what you'd expect and it's part of the charm. The tables were spaced a little too close for my liking, but it was tolerable. \n\nOverall, I'd go back if invited, but I don't know if I'd go again on my own.",3
1120,"First I'll start off with the homemade beer.  Nothing spectacular, but it has flavor and is very reasonably priced, as is the menu.  I went with the potato pancake Reuben.  HOLY CRAP.  Probably the most filling meal I've ever ate, but it was worth it.  My boyfriend was pretty happy he got to finish my leftovers.  The German potato salad I had for my side was equally as good.  It had a bit of a bite to it, which I really liked.  I also had to try my boyfriends meal.  He went with one of the wursts, but the exact name is escaping me.  It was made with veal, and was so light and tender - YUM.  That will be my meal when we return.  I can't believe it took me so long to eat here!",4
1121,"I have stopped going to Max's for regular meals because the food isn't so good but a friend likes to go for Sunday brunch.I find a good portion of the food is acceptable for the brunch,except the food is not kept hot or even warm on the buffet. Cold kielbasi and sauerkraut is a turn off even though it would be great if it was warmer.  The chef that makes the eggs and omelets to order is really good and the sausage is the best. The bacon and the chicken needs to be cooked a little longer as they are always half raw.\nSo much of what they have would be good if it was kept at least warm. Since they have it in chaffing dishes, I've found that the food comes out cold from the kitchen. Makes you wonder just how safe the kitchen is.",2
1122,"Brunch, brunch, brunch.  Max's serves an awesome Sunday Brunch Buffet!  The omelet station is standard (no egg whites for you health-nuts) and heavenly pastries will always await you along with potato pancakes.  I'm not in love with their potato pancakes, but being that Max's specializes in German food, you've got to try at least one with their homemade applesauce.\n\nSome of my rotating favorites on the buffet include red cabbage, Eggs Benedict, and the Farmer's Breakfast.  You can order off the menu during brunch if you aren't in mood to gorge yourself on the buffet.  No drinks included with the buffet :( but you can order them, of course.\n\nI love the decor at Max's - it's an old house, and much of the furniture looks like it was in this house and just remained when it converted to a restaurant.  Max's location in Old Deutschtown on the North Side fits it perfectly.  They even offer a shuttle to Heinz Field on Steeler game days (small fee applies).",3
1123,"This is one of the only German restaurants I know of in the area. The meal was good and reasonably priced. They also have a good beer selection on draft and in bottles. We had a party of 6 going for a 7:30 dinner on a Thursday. \n\nBigger parties tend to chat a little more and take longer in my experience. I felt like they were sort of rushing us out. That might be because they closed the dining room door and started vacuuming the front bar room while we were still finishing up our dinner. I'm not sure if anyone was eating out there but I'm very happy we weren't because it seems really gross to me to vacuum around food. This was around 9:15 and I'm pretty sure they serve until 10. \n\nBesides that, our service was good and so was the food. We all split the stuffed pretzels and potato skins as an appetizer. The pretzels are delicious, I could have eaten them all myself! Deep-fried and stuffed with cheese, yummy! \n\nI ordered the Chicken Viennese and was pleased with my meal. It came with a choice of two sides and I went with a delicious sweet potato casserole and my favorite thing of the night: POTATO PANCAKES. I prefer sour cream, but you can also get applesauce. Yum yum yum get lots of potato pancakes! The chicken was delicious and was served over spaetzel, which was just ok. I've had the kase spaetzel there before which is served in a cheese sauce and much better than the regular. \n\nThere was a variety of entrees ordered from sausage platters to wiener schnitzel and everyone seemed pleased with their meals. You get a lot for your money and I'll never turn down a chance to eat potato pancakes!",3
1124,"I ordered the Roast Pork loin with Apple raisin dressing, sauerkraut, and German potatoes. Oh yeah... Right Choice! Took a little longer than usual as there was a Large Party of 16 that ordered Just prior to us. Happy to say the waitress took Great care of us, plenty of rolls, drink refills, etc. as we waited. Apple Strudel for the Final Act. So Good, I forgot to take a picture. lol",4
1125,"I really like this place. It has a neat atmosphere where the entrance has a nice bar and then there are a few other rooms that have the feeling of a living room or dining room. I really enjoy their brunches, but their pretzels are amazing. The one thing I don't like, which is a bit disappointing, is their potato pancakes. They are a little lumpy and not quite fried enough. With that said, it is definitely worth the visit.",4
1126,"Tremendous selection of German dishes.  All the sausages come from a particular manufacturer in Wisconsin that uses 100 year old methods of making them (according to the menu).  I don't know if that's a good thing or not, but they taste terrific.  \n\nThe options for sides are as plentiful as the moan dishes and the hot bacon potato salad was awesome.  \n\nDefinitely recommend giving this a try.",5
1127,"Max's is great. It feels like your German grandmothers house and the service matches this feeling. The food is authentic and inexpensive. If you are not too familiar with German food, just ask and the waitress will walk you though the favorites.\n\nI love the sausages and the stuffed pretzels are amazing, but the Apple Fritter is the greatest thing ever.",5
1128,"This used to be the best German food in town. I have seen a gradual decline in the food over the past several years. The gravies have changed and the Max's Goulash (one of my favorite dishes) has a different sauce (strangely dessert sweet) and change in the protein. The sides are still great, but the food used to be so much better.",2
1129,"Max's was good, but I've had better.\n\nThe restaurant is located in a tired part of town. It isn't in a bad area, but I'm not sure how I would feel eating there after dark. When you walk in you walk through the tavern portion of the restaurant, which is dark and gloomy. We were escorted to the rear of the tavern, which is covered in B&W pictures from the 40's, which gives it a old world tired feeling.\n\nThe menu choices were standard faire for a true german restaurant. I had Max's Goulash, which said it came with spaetzle, but it is piled in the bottom of the bowl and not on the side, which was okay. The goulash was too vinegary for my tastes, but it was okay.\n\nMy wife's Jaeger Schnitzel was good, but I've had better at Das Wald Cafe (http://www.yelp.com/biz/das-waldcafe-newport-news).",2
1130,"Man, I just love this place.  Pennsylvanian German for sure. Some peeps don't know the Difference. If you want real Pennsylvanian German food, then this is your place. This is the kind of food that my grandmother cooked up in Erie, and my uncle sells at the butcher shop in Girard.  Go in the off hours; cause the bar is packed at lunch and late. Also go ahead and put a coin in the machine! You'll see. It pisses the bar crowd off temporarily but so worth it!",5
1131,"This place is awesome.  Authentic, home-made German food that is extra delicious.  Really neat place too!  Potato Pancakes are delicious.  Can't wait to go back.  I would take out of town people here instead of Church Brew any day.",4

Had a couple of yuenglings, a warm, salty yummy soft pretzel and a big ole plate of German goodness in da tummy!\n\nThe Peasant Platter had knock wurst, weisswurst and a pork chop on top of heap of sauerkraut...with potato pancakes, spaetzel and a basket of baked breads!  So.much.food.  And oh soooo good!\n\nThe bar is cool, staff is really nice and I believe they offer their patrons a free ride to and from on game days!",4
1133,"I cannot believe Max's is going from 5 stars to 2 stars for me.\n\nYou have to understand, I love this place.  Over the years we have had so many family dinners here including my sisters rehearsal dinner, that it's almost become like eating at a relatives house.\n\nBut now that relative has gone senile and needs to go to a nursing home, and they can't cook anymore.\n\nFor the past two years, every time we come here we say, \""This just isn't as good as I remember.\""  For starters, the food is always served cold.  Don't believe me?  I hope you enjoy tepid knackwurst and cold mashed potatoes.\n\nBTW, to whoever makes their mashed potatoes, you have to boil the potatoes before you mash them.  Yesterday they were undercooked, gritty, and gross.\n\nIn fact, all of the food is becoming gross.  My friend got the roasted beef and what came out looked like a cold cut covered with a congealed beef gravy that had bits of carrots in it.  wtf was that????\n\nI'm done.  This place has gone down hill.  You need a new chef, immediately.  Max's is a North Side institution but there are so many new, better restaurants opening up that they really need to up their game.\n\nPS--thanks for the nausea and hurling about 6 hours after dinner.",2
1134,"I love this place.  The atmosphere, the bartenders, the waitresses and most of all the food. The potato pancakes are delicious as are all their soups. I think there is something for everyone here. Their desserts are all delicious. We eat here before most concert or sporting event.",5
1135,The old arcade game was excellent and only a few quarters to play.\nDrinks nice enough .\nBartenders were really nice.\n NIce enough place.,3
1136,"Got take out from this place on the weekend.  Ordered kung pao chicken, steamed dumplings, and pork egg rolls.  I was really hungry so it hit the spot, but there wasn't that many chicken pieces in my kung pao chicken - a lot of peanuts (as expected) and a whole lot of celery and carrots (aka filler).  So I was a bit disappointed in that.  \n\nThe steam dumplings were good, especially when fresh and hot.  The egg roll was tasty as well - I didn't find it too oily.  Very affordable and a generous portion - I had the leftovers the next day.",3
1137,"I work on the North Side and went for a walk to find something new for lunch.  I am quickly growing tired of Eco Bistro directly downstairs from my office at Allegheny Center.\n\nAt any rate, came across this place at the corner of Ohio and the onramp to 279.  The lunch special was inexpensive and grabbed a soda for about $6 in all.  I had the Kung Pao Chicken and it was prepared to order.  Tasty, cheap, fast.  I ate inside - there are only a handful of tables in this place and it's decently clean.",3
1138,"I somehow discovered this place when searching for sandwich places to enjoy with a friend.  How I have never noticed it when walking by it on East Ohio Street, not 10 minutes from my house, I will never understand.  Maybe because the entrance is set back from the sidewalk a bit, so it looks dark (i.e. possibly closed) when you first walk by.  Or maybe because it's overshadowed by the Isaly's next door.  Please, I beg of you, fellow Yelpers, don't ignore this place any longer!\n\nPlease note, as other reviewers have, that North Shore Deli is cash only.  But believe me, you won't need much.  They do have a website that really just lists the sandwiches they offer and their hours or see my photo of the menu board showing the sandwiches available (all named after local streets).  \n\nIt was difficult to decide on just one sandwich.  But after reading the few reviews here, I decided to go with the hot sausage.  When I first arrived, the meat was still cooking.  I didn't mind, I told the gentleman I would return and took a stroll over to Priory for some sweet treats for later.  When I returned, I was the only patron there but was greeted again and friendly small talk ensued.  I opted for a side of macaroni salad as well.  \n\nWhen I got home and unwrapped my sandwich, I was surprised by the hot sausage that looked like it was exploding at both ends.  And that it was, my friends.  Exploding with flavor, that is.  The ends were crispy and delicious and the sausage was just hot enough that the macaroni salad was the perfect cool salad compliment.  I guarantee you, this is only the first of many visits.",5
1139,"You really need to try's this place. Great sandwiches, a hot dog/sausage cart, and friendly service!",5
1140,"I really wanted to like this place. Great reviews and a renovated priory--what a great idea! The pictures on the website are beautiful.\n\nWe found a grumpy old man at the front desk, and he could not have been less interested in our arrival. It felt like we were disturbing him to ask for our room key. But the fun started when we returned later in the evening. We found the rollaway we had requested (and paid for) not present, and I went back down to the old gentleman. He stared at me and then went back to pecking at his computer. I waited. Suddenly he looked up at me and started yelling, something to the effect that there wasn't anything that he could do, and that he would see if someone could do something but probably not. He also angrily admitted that the reservation did show the rollaway.\n\nI slunk away with my guest who had by now come down, too, embarrassed and insulted. It shouldn't be this way. If this is personalized service, I'd rather stay at a motel.\n\nEven without grumpy old man, there's nothing special about this place. The rooms were ok, but the bathrooms tiny (I guess they should be called showerrooms). Everything else was sub-par. The dining room breakfast was served in was tacky and the coffee awful. We did not dare try the free wine. The hotel is in a bad neighborhood.\n\nFor the money, find a special at the William Penn on the Omni Hotels website. If you want a boutique hotel, try the Inn on the Mexican War Streets--a beautiful building with friendly owners just across from the National Aviary and that beautiful park. The Priory does not feel boutique and is not worth the hassle.\n\nPriory, get grumpy old man out of a customer-facing role.",1
1141,"My wife and I stayed at The Priory when we went out to Pittsburgh for Superbowl weekend. \n\nThe hotel is beautiful inside and out. We don't normally stay in nice hotels, so we were surprised by how nice it was, especially the extremely comfortable king-sized bed. It made for the perfect romantic getaway in a hectic weekend filled with bars, parties, and souvenir shopping on The Strip.\n\nThere are some things you should know before you book at The Priory, however. The hotel is right across the street from a housing project. There isn't enough parking, especially if The Grand Hall is hosting a wedding when you arrive. If you get a room that is street-adjacent you may be woken up by sounds like people talking or shoveling the sidewalk. \n\nOverall, none of these things bothered me that much (aside from getting woken up by the snow shoveler, but I suppose that was better than cracking my head on an icy sidewalk later!). However, if you're the type of person who gets easily annoyed at minor inconveniences or gets uncomfortable around lots of african-americans, you may want to stay at the Doubletree or Westin or something. \n\nIf you're looking for a charming boutique hotel and you're not afraid of being on the North Side, you should definitely check out The Priory.",4
1142,"We stayed here and was initially disappointed-- being new to town, our first impression was that Pittsburgh was a very very bad town full of homeless and degenerates (the area, I find out later, is one of the worst spots in the city!).  The hotel is located across the street from a housing authority building.  Projects?  UGH.  Great.  \n\nThen we were put into a \""historical\"" room that was similar to that of a rundown cheap apartment-- old shower stall, moldy threadbare carpeting, lumpy squeaky bed.  \n\nI find out an hour later (after freaking out about the lo-end aspect of this room) that they have new rooms that were just recently renovated.  I asked to see the room, and then ultimately change to that room-- for a fee, of course.  About 50% more expensive.  But I pay more because NO WAY would I be able to exist in this old \""historical\"" creepy room.  \n\nFinally, a regular room-- the \""renovated\"" room was similar to that of an acceptable hotel room.  Why even keep this historical, old, dingy, dirty room?  Do they figure unsuspecting people who don't know any better will just accept it b/c they have no other choice?? \n\nI slept well in the \""new\"" renovated room, and would have been freaked out all night in the old room. What a difference. Actually, the bed and linens were very, very comfortable.  The bathroom was nice and clean.  The room was what I expected a hotel room to be... not high end four seasons, but not cheap and nasty either. \n\nThe hotel obviously had availabilities of the new, renovated rooms, so why put us in an old, unrenovated, ugly old apartment looking room? If they believed in upgrading, then they would have at least gotten repeat business!! For those who are going to book here, pay more for the new rooms, or go somewhere else.  The option of staying in the old room should not be an option at all.  \n\nI don't think I will ever go back here if I ever go back to Pittsburgh.  I will stay at a chain hotel-- marriot or whatever.  What is money except a means to be comfortable and live?  I will spend more next time.\n\nBreakfast was \""eh\"".  It was free-- small stations of some fruit, cheese, small pastries, cereal, yougurt and two hot items:  sausage + bacon.  OJ, Cranberry, Milk and Coffee also available.  Honestly, I felt like I was in college, and watching my pennies (poor), staying here...",1
1143,"We've stayed here twice during recent trips to Pittsburgh, and while the city itself is a bit hit and miss, the Priory is always comfortable and welcoming. A great place to escape after a long drive or a stressful drive around the maze of roads and traffic that make up Pittsburgh.\n\nEach room is pretty unique and always well appointed and very clean. The staff are friendly and helpful with whatever you might need and it's an easy drive to most of the attractions around town.",5
1144,Great european style boutique hotel.  You can not beat this hotel for the money!,5
1145,"Was at a beautiful wedding.  Staff was terrible, unpleasant, and the two slobs at the front desk need to be in the back with their people skills.  Nice hotel but make sure you take some warm bodies with you because the \""people\"" at the priory are cold, miserable and just plain miserable. I get better guest service at Holiday Inn",1
1146,"I was very specific when I made my reservations several months ago. I needed a non-entrance level room away from noise. We were given a room right off of the hotel Foyer. It is mid-night and a party rages just outside my door even though I have called the front desk asking for their assistance. Right now I would prefer to be in a Motel6.  This room was relatively not cheap, it should have at least been cut-rate given out only as a last resort.  The next time I am in Pittsburgh it will not include a stay at The Priory, which is a shame because besides this issue it is a nice place. But if you are considering staying at this hotel why take the chance. While the party continues and I am getting no help from the front desk I am tempted to lower my rating to a single star. But, hey, I can always catch up on my sleep tomorrow night.",2
1147,"Ended up here since for some reason all the major hotels on the North Side were booked.  Overall this is a solid option if that happens to you, but probably wouldn't make a point to stay here otherwise.\n\nNice staff, fairly easy walk to North Side or across the bridges but as others have mentioned it's not in a great area.  Literally \""on the wrong side of the tracks\"".  I live in a similar area in Philly so it didn't bother me as much but can see this being an issue for others.  I also walked the whole time and didn't use the shuttle so that's an option as well, but did hear others waiting a while to that just to go to PNC Park which I simply walked to myself in 10 minutes.\n\nIt's definitely an old place, so you could see that as \""charm\"" or simply as old.  Again, not a bad place at all but nowhere I'd miss if I stayed elsewhere.",3
1148,"booked through a third party site and they tried to stick us in a queen room even though they had plenty of kings available. definitely gave attitude about it but \""upgraded\"" anyway. he wanted to charge me the difference but I refused. just bad service overall. no one to help with bags morning or night. even the day front desk person was short with us and rude. I couldn't wait to get out of there. the room was clean and charming. the area is definitely rough. I wouldn't stay here again.",2
1149,"We decided to have a little staycation at the Priory earlier this month.  My husband made the reservation with a special they were having for a dinner date night.  With the special, they give you a few Pittsburgh restaurants to choose from and you get a $50 voucher to that restaurant.  When my husband called the Priory, they said they would make the reservations and call us back on the time.  We never got a call about the reservation time which was annoying.  But the main issue was we checked in, talked to the girl at the front desk about having the shuttle take us to this reservation at Meat and Potatoes, and she set us up with the shuttle.  We go in the room, look around for the $50 voucher, and it's not in the room so we assumed (i know we should never assume) that it was taken care of with Meat and Potatoes when they  made our reservation.  We had a fabulous dinner at M&P, great food, great service, and the bill comes.  We asked the server about this Priory $50 voucher and he had never heard about it so the manager comes over and says they didn't give them anything but to have them call and ask for him and he'll work it out.  We called the Priory and told them this, the girl who answered gave us an attitude and said you should have asked for it.  Then refused to call M&P to talk to the manager.  She just said to pay the full bill and we can work it out when we get back to the hotel.  We gave the manager our phone and he was yelled at as well about this.  He took our word that the Priory would deliver it to him the next day and he deducted the $50 from our bill.  It was embarrassing and it wasn't the issue with the money, just the service with the priory.  This showed us two things: We won't be going back to the Priory due to the lack of service and lack of respect and we WILL be going back to M&P because their service was impeccable.",1
1150,"After considerable research for a hotel on the night of a Steelers football game (a Sunday night against the Baltimore Ravens, no less!), The Priory was my top choice in that it was relatively reasonably priced and offered shuttle service free of charge to/from the game.  In spite of the hotel being located in the less-than-revered North Side of the city, the place has charm and character with a friendly, accommodating staff.  At no point did I feel unsafe, although in full disclosure, I did not spend considerable time in the hotel's neighborhood, other than to frequent a nearby watering hole, the James Street Gastropub and Speakeasy.  The hotel has ample complimentary parking nearby (one lot across the street, another around the block), including one lot that is only accessible to hotel guests.  The other lot is posted to only permit hotel guests to park there but there did not appear to be a way to monitor this, although it is possible (likely?) hotel staff does so.  In addition to the friendliness of the staff and shuttle service to the stadium, the continental breakfast that was provided was pleasantly surprising in that in addition to the typical fare (cereal, muffins, danish, hard boiled eggs, coffee, etc.), there was a generous selection of meats, cheeses, and fruits.  I would gladly stay at this clean, comfortable, and charming hotel again!",4
1151,"So apparently I have this habit, at least last week, of visiting a bar/restaurant during its most dead time. In this case, it was somewhat understandable for Clark Bar & Grill because it was a very uneventful sports week. Regardless, I wanted to check out this place, housed in the old manufacturing warehouse of the historic Clark Bar Candy Co. (RIP) just north of PNC Park.\n\nI wasn't overly impressed with either the menu or beer selections. In fact, there were only five beers on tap and one had just kicked. I ordered the special, a Reuben sandwich with tater tots, which were both decent. I washed it down with a Penn Pilsner (local brew) and then left to go check out another place on the North Side.\n\nThis may be a good spot to hit up before/after a Pirates or Steelers game because of its proximity to both stadiums, but I'm not sure I'd venture back otherwise.",3
1152,"My review is limited to the restroom.  I was in town for a Steelers/Jets game and the portable toilet line was very long.  So I walked over here and for $5 the allowed me to use the restroom for the rest of the day (they stamped my hand).  I was told that it would be donated to a charity (I believe he said ALS).  Great idea if it is true.  The restroom is not very large (men's room had 2 urinals and 2 toilets) but it is much better than the options out in the parking lot.  \n\nAs far as the rest of the place, it was packed with fans prior to game time.  Lots of food, drinks and tv.  Might be a better hang out spot if the weather is crummy. But I prefer to tailgate.  It'd be a good spot to watch the game if you did not have a ticket and tailgated with your friends.",3
1153,"First I would like to say the Pasta Too of old had good food, this was just average.  The italian and mushroom steak hoagies weren't that great.  The steak was so chopped that it kept falling out of the bun.  The pizza wasn't that good either.  The prices are higher than the food was good. $6.25 for 7\"" italian and $7.50 for 7\"" mushroom steak. So not worth it but I guess they figure they can get from the people who work at the hospital and with all the new housing going up.  I will not get anything from there again.",2
1154,Awesome fast pizza,5
1155,"We didn't order directly from them, so I'm not ranking any lower than three stars.\n\nHOWEVER, our wedding catering sourced their bread from Breadworks and it was quite unimpressive.  In fact, many of our guests identified it as the one thing they would have changed about our meal...\n\nNot sure if it was because our reception was on a Saturday and maybe the hotel only takes deliveries on weekdays or something, but it just wasn't fresh-tasting and certainly wasn't on-par with say, Mancini's.",3
1156,"Breadworks has great bread although I usually only buy it in the summer because I make my own bread. I am rating it 4 stars and not 5 for one thing, the focaccia. They now stick it in pizza box and you can't see what your getting. The last 2 times I got it, the bread was burnt. At the price of this bread it shouldn't be burnt and it never was when you could see it before you got it home. I think I will stick to what I can see.",4
1157,"I was fortunate enough to enjoy a Saturday night Oktoberfest celebration here this past weekend. A friend of mine is a member of this private German heritage club, and got tickets for me and our lady friends for this celebration.\n\nWe brought our own steins (which cost varying prices to fill throughout the night depending on whom we asked), but were always full of beer from excellent breweries like Spaten and Hofbrauhaus. We enjoyed a phenomenal buffet, with two delicious wursts, pork cutlets, potato pancakes, sauerkraut, and a whole mess of tasty German sides dishes. And we spent the next three or four hours in a handsome ballroom with folks as much as three times our age, drinking beer and enjoying awesomely German music from \""Fred Zurich and His Sound Machine\"".\n\nWhat a great time this place was! I've never had so much fun being 1/4 German in all my life. If you have a chance to visit, take it!",5
1158,"Okay, I'm biased because I'm actually German. And in Germany I'd probably never set a foot into a traditionally designed beer house - just because I'm from Berlin and this is more stuff Bavarians would do.\n\nBut I was in Pittsburgh so different rules. Came here for brunch on a Sunday because of an invite. You're not a member? Sorry no entry. Luckily, my accent gave it away and apparently Germans are always welcome.\n\nThey serve proper Bavarian food - Wurst, Bacon (?), Red Cabbage, fried potatoes - pretty solid. You can also get omelettes together with a Krug of German beer. Is that what we Germans do for breakfast back home? Maybe in the Bavarian woods, I'm not sure, but it is definitely something.\n\nThe interior is quite unique - imagine Oktoberfest in 1935 and you get the idea. Fun fact: not everyone in there speaks German and they have waitresses that work there for over a decade. I do, however, appreciate that this Pittsburgh institution is around for more than 100 years and hope they'll stick around for a while.\n\nMaybe, in another 100 years, even the neighborhood won't look as dodgy as it looks right now.",3
1159,"If this place wasn't up on a hill, it might be a hipster paradise. As it stands, it is a beloved and well-attended local bar with frequent karaoke nights. I've been there twice, and so far the bartender has been the same wonderful, slightly hurried lady, who remembered us the second time around and who was willing to help me experiment by making a manly cocktail with a raw egg shaken into it. I guess it helps that the other half of Billy's bar is Billy's restaurant, with eggs to spare. A good time is always had, belting out the classics with friendly faces and free popcorn abounding.  Be forewarned: if you start coming every week, some of the classics will become even more \""classic\"", as you start to realize your new friends have favourite songs to jive to on a regular basis....",3
1160,"I really don't know how this place got any good reviews. One big problem is that the place is dirty, the carpets, the lighting above the tables and the furniture. I have tried this place 5 times in the past 2 years and this is how it went. The 1st time I had a burger which tasted funny and I didn't finish it. I got food poisoning and was so sick. This I thought might have been a stomach flu so I did try this place again. The 2nd time I was with some friends from the neighborhood and 3/5 of us had the spaghetti and meatballs and we got food poisoning.Now I'm thinking that they have a hygiene problem with the ground meat. I was going to stay away from the place but a friend from Troy hill liked to stop there because it was close to her home. No problem,next time I got french fries with gravy. How could this be a problem?.When they got to the table they had put cold canned gravy on my fries.When I told the waitress about it she took it back to the kitchen and microwaved it till it was the heat of lava. Needless to say I refused to pay for them. The 4th time my friend dragged me there, I had a salad. I didn't get sick but it wasn't anything special with bagged salad mix and a couple of under ripe tomato pieces and cucumber. The last time I only got a slice of pie and this was good. I no longer have to go to Billy's, my dear friend has passed away and I refuse to go anywhere near the place. To the owner-Please sell the restaurant, you obviously don't care for the place or know how to handle food safely.",1
1161,"This place was a total surprise to me. I didn't really know anything existed on Troy Hill aside from Penn Brewery until I went for a ride through the area this past weekend. While passing through I noticed Billy's, it was open, the steeler game was about to start.... Why not check it out?!\n\nThe interior is dated, but clean and has some character. You enter though the bar and the dining room is on your right, this being a Sunday afternoon though, the dining room was not open. No biggie, I'll saddle up to the bar which seats about 12 people. The bartender was very nice, introduced herself and wanted to get to know me. \n\nThis seems like a mostly locals only bar, but they are very happy when people from outside the neighborhood stop in. One thing I heard several times while I was in there was \""Troy Hill is getting better, more people should come here and find out.\""\n\nI tried the soup of the day, chicken and corn chowder, and an order of their wings, $.60 during the Steelers games. Both were very good and made me want to come back to try more of the menu. The beer selection is a bit limited, they mostly stick with the big name domestics, but that being said, the beer is pretty darn cheap. Sam Adams Octoberfest was $2.50 a glass or $12 a pitcher! \n\nI'll certainly be back to Billy's and I think you should go too, turns out there are things on Troy Hill!",3
1162,"Good neighborhood bar/restaurant. Always good food. Never got sick, or anyone I was with get sick. Have been there with another person upto party's of 10. Always friendly staff. Usually goto Billy's once a month, maybe more. Living right on top of the hill from Billy's, we are regulars there!",5
1163,"How to put this gently?\n\nWhile I may go back to Pittsburgh some day, I will never return to the Carnegie Museum of Art. \n\nIt's not that I mind that its gallery seemed small compared to others I have viewed (sometimes small museums have some hidden treasures) or that one whole gallery was blown glass and I felt like I was at a bong shop on haight st. in sf. \n\nIt comes down to the fact that a docent, while trying to explain a painting with a watchtower in it, told the students it was a watchtower \""from Auschwitz, a place where they basically fried a lot of Jews\"".  Seriously? That's how she chose to describe concentration camps to a large class of what I could only guess were middle schoolers? It sounded like she described a bad breakfast joint...\""oh that place? they basically just fry eggs\"".\n\nOn top of all that, the description of the piece stated the watchtower was reminiscent of those that were spread throughout East and West Germany during Hitler's rule (i.e. not those in Auschwitz).\n\nIn sum, docents are a reflection of the institution in which they volunteer, and this one sucked. So, Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh, if you're going to hire racist people to lead your tours, at least make sure they have their facts straight (or can read).",1
1164,"I visited both the art and natural history museums last weekend. I majorly bummed that the large dinosaur exhibit was under refurbishment. Most of the rest of the museum is a large taxidermy exhibit - not my thing.\n\nIn addition, the art museum, although nice, did not live up to the \""major impressionist collection\"" rep it has. Maybe I'm just spoiled with Philly museums, but this one was a bit of a disappointment. Major thumbs down to the museum for not notifying visitors ahead of time that the statue room was shut down for a private function during the day.",3
1165,"Why Go?\nYou want to see lots of shiny gems, random contemporary art that doesn't make any sense (at least to me), and dinos all in one place\n\nWhen to Go?\nIf you're cheap go 1hr or 1.5 hr before closing cuz we got in FREE!!!\nbut keep in mind you only have so much time to spend so be selective\n\nWhat You Should See?\n1.)

1166,"The boy and I spent most of a day here.  In the morning, we and his sister-in-law and 18-month nephew went through the Natural History museum.  The dinosaur exhibit was, of course, the highlight.  I was also impressed by the bird collection.  We were both a little disappointed at the botany display, which was only one smallish room.  I noticed that in a few of the displays, cards indicated that a certain number of artifacts were supposed to be on display, but some had been removed with no explanation or updating to the information.  Or maybe someone stole them and the museum hasn't noticed yet!!\n\nIn terms of natural history museums, I think we have been spoiled for all others by the Field Museum in Chicago.\n\nWe spent the afternoon on the art side, and only managed to get through a couple of the modern art displays before becoming overwhelmed.  There was one film about migration in the modern art room which we both really enjoyed.  I found the art involving the venetian blinds and various types of light bulbs to be fascinating.  We spent the last hour of our time upstairs in the Ancient Egypt exhibit.  Unfortunately, there seemed to be a corporate event happening that afternoon which involved a scavenger hunt; if you think that children's field trips and scavenger hunts are annoying, imagine a whole herd of businessmen and women on a scavenger hunt, and not using their indoor voices, either.\n\nOther than that, the museums were both quite pleasant and not too crowded.  Well worth the student price of $11.",4
1167,"There are actually 4 museums in the Carnegie Museum group in Pittsburgh. I'll review the Natural History and Art Museums in this review (separate review for the Warhol forthcoming.)\n\nThe low-down - for $15 you get admission to both the Natural History Museum and the Art Museum. It is well worth the money as you can spend hours on both sides.\n\nThe Natural History Museum is a dinosaur lover heaven. The fossils are seriously awesome, especially the one that you see when you walk in (that is still in the huge rock face.)  Just a great collection and definitely a good place for families.\n\nThe art museum has some great items in it - the Monet probably stands out for most people. I loved the \""Chariot of Aurora\"" installation - a 32 panel wall that once graced the luxury cruiseliner Normandie. There were plenty of gems in the modern collection besides the Monet - loved the John Singer Sargent and the Bourgerou. \n\nAlso impressive was the Hall of Architecture and the Hall of Sculpture. These transform you into another place and time while you are there. \n\nI thoroughly enjoyed the time I spent here and would not hesitate to come here again. Highly recommended.",5
1168,"I'm from Detroit. We have a decent art museum, but nothing this awesome.\n\nThe Carnegie Museum houses two very nice museums. Natural History and Art. The Natural History Museum is very impressive and it's cool knowing that all the specimens belong to the museum and they aren't on loan from some hoity-toity New York museum. It's not huge like the Smithsonian, but it's certainly cool seeing real dinosaur bones. My accompaniment had to stifle all my Jurassic Park \""Mr. DNA\"" references.\n\nThe art section is also quite impressive. I personally still prefer my Detroit Institute of Art, but this museum is still nice. I got a little confused about how to walk around. I prefer my museums in chronological order, not cool to less cool, which is what this seems to be. The modern art is very cool, but after being at the Warhol the day before, I had my fill of high-concept stuff. There's quite a bit of Impressionism, which by scientific fact all women love.\n\nThis is great way to spend a long afternoon and there's plenty to do in Oakland afterwards.",4
1169,"Totally incredible way to spend an afternoon with my family - these museums have it all! Since we have a family membership (which I highly recommend), we typically pop in for an hour or two at a time, focusing on different areas of the complex in Oakland every time we go. Our daughter seems to enjoy the dinosaurs the most, but she's also intrigued by the art collection! My favorite part is the Hall of Architecture, filled with many incredible casts of facades and sculptures. Just the fact that they have casts of the Venus de Milo and Nike of Samothrace is unbelieveable - I don't think that casting of these timeless works of art is even allowed anymore. Don't miss out on the basement kid's room, because it's full of hands-on activities for the young ones.\n\nWe will definitely keep our membership current as the years go on - it's timeless, and always fun!",5

Pay them no mind. The range and quality of exhibits at the Carnegie are rightly rich sources of pride and accomplishment to the organization and Pittsburgh. And, each and every staff member I spoke with was courteous, helpful and obviously well trained...something that's not always the case in many exalted European settings. If you're traveling with children you'll appreciate the numerous interactive areas created for the kids.  \n\nPittsburgh is so much more than football, hockey and salads with hidden french fries (tell me again why they do that?).

1174,"Decided to hit this place before hitting on 12 while the dealer shows a 9 at the Rivers.   We didn't have a reservation but the server seated us anyways (we had to be done by 7).  It is BYOB but they deal you a $4 corkage fee per person drinking.  The bread sticks were fresh and warm and were the perfect accompaniment to the delicious soup du jour, potato soup.  The side salad that comes with the meal would make the hall of fame for any side salad league.  It came with olives, Gorgonzola, julienned carrots and other veggies.  I had the pork tenderloin with veggies and mashed potatoes.   The tenderloin was perfectly cooked and the mashed potatoes were like having two aces in the hole.   It would be tough to find a better waitstaff.   Plates disappeared, water was filled, and I never knew they were there.  If your looking for a place to try before going to the casino or bucco game this is a sure bet, just call ahead for reservations.  They do have outdoor seating but the views wont show up on any postcard.  PS The 7:00 reservation called to say they were going to be late so we were allowed to relax at the table till 7:30.",5
1175,"Food: menu will appeal to vegetarians and non-vegetarians, with daily dinner specials, separate lunch (sandwiches) and dinner (entrees) menus, both soups were vegetarian (according to the waitress, never heard of vegetarian minestrone before), I ordered penne with multiple veggies and a white wine sauce, it was above average but not great, soup was good, a bowl of bread sticks was on the table and replaced regularly, salad was average size and quality\n\nPrice: dinners range from $12-18 with most toward the higher end of that range, not expensive, but the quality of the food probably deserves the lower end of that scale\n\nDrinks: BYOB\n\nAtmosphere: sports bar-family restaurant type setting, with pictures of athletes all over the wall, but better than sports bar quality food and service\n\nService: waitress refilled water many times, was on the ball and timely, answered all questions about the menu\n\n(+): good service, reasonable prices, good but not great food\n\n(-): nothing wrong with Legends, but also nothing spectacular\n\nWould I go back again? I wouldn't drive to the North Side to eat here, but if I was in the North Side, it would be at the top of the list, particularly if friends/family were at AGH (directly across the street).",3
1176,"So....what do you say when a highly rated place let's you down??  It was okay....\n\nWhen a meal rocks my world, I usually want to lick the bowl clean, yes, like a dog.  I did not, sadly, feel that way about this place.  It IS BYOB but the catch is it's $4 PER glass.  Yep, that's right, not per table my friend.  Keep that in mind.\n\nI got the greens and beans on recommendation from many Yelpers on here.  Maybe I just don't have the taste for it, but I thought it was weird, watery and....not good.  I also thought it was going to be green beans and it was kidney beans and spinach that tasted like a warm Caesar salad.  No thanks....\n\nI ordered the Penne Vodka, which is my fav meal to order at Italian restaurants.  I also like to add a meatball on if it's homemade.  It was, in fact, confirmed to be homemade so I was all over it!  The meatball itself was delicious.  I love a bread-y meatball.  You know the type.  Soft and packed with flavor.  It was the winner of the night.  The vodka sauce was good, but I wanted way more.  Now I have to preface this by saying I'm a total sauce-aholic.  I love me a good amount of sauce, this didn't even come close.  Then I looked over at Serena R's plate, and her ravioli (which I thought was the same) was SWIMMING in it!  So I stole some of hers....\n\nWould I come back?  If someone really wanted to.  But I have a hunch there's way better Italian places to dine at in the Burgh...so now I'm on the hunt!  I gotta connect with my roots, ya' know?",3
1177,"Small, overcrowded, unfriendly staff.\n\nThe food is okay - typical Italian fair that could be better seasoned. \n\nThere are much better options nearby, but in a pinch, it's decent.",2
1178,"This is our favorite restaurant, bar none. The food is terrific, the service is top notch, they remember our names and it always feels special when we dine there. I've never had a pasta special I didn't adore. \n\nI truly feel like they are happy to see us when we come in the door and go to extra pains to treat us well and we are just an average couple who aren't spending hundreds. That doesn't matter - we are their customers. \n\nWe've been by for lunch which is very competitive price wise with nearby restaurants.",5
1179,We made reservations for my mother's birthday for 14. No one in my family had ever been to the restaurant; we used yelp and trip advisor to find it.  They were ready for us and everything was fabulous.  \n\nI had spaghetti and meatball.  The pasta was perfectly done. The kitchen was great.  Everyone got their meals almost at the same time (which is very hard for a small restaurant with a big group).  The people were professional and friendly.  The BYOB allowed us to have wine that suited everyone's taste.  They did the pasta and non-pasta dishes very well.  \n\nThis small restaurant is a gem in an up and coming neighborhood.  We walked from the Priory Hotel on a beautiful March evening.,5
1180,"Service is friendly and quick! Everything comes at a timely manner and all the food is fairly priced. Although it's a little small, it's really amazing! The pasta is incredible!",5
1181,"I have been here several times and always have a great experience! The food is always delicious, the staff is super friendly, and there are plenty of different dishes to choose from. The desserts are particularly great! The apple pie is delicious :)",5
1182,"Legends...interesting name. With a name like Legends, one would assume sports bar, but not so much. And I very much liked it that way! Let's roll into a pro/con list...\n\nPros:\n-Great, friendly service. Morgan was my server and she was super fantastic. Quick, efficient, sweet. She offered up helpful suggestions and even let me try a sample of the soup of the day before I placed my order.\n-Homemade focaccia: Mmmm rosemary! Tasty and free slivers of love to go with your meal. \n-Portions: Mammoth. From the bowls of soup to the pastas to the pies...sharing is caring.\n-Spinach ravioli: My main dish of choice. Flavorful spinach and cheese pillows of pasta cooked al dente and smothered with tomato basil sauce with a touch of cream. Damn good pasta, my friends.\n\nCons:\n-Menu items price out a few dollars higher than similar Italian joints. But, the value is here, though, because of the increased portions. \n-Restaurant set up/ambiance: Is a bit odd. It's kinda like a diner...with bare tables...and carpet...and a few random pictures on the wall. \n-No booze, beer or wine. It is BYO, but I didn't see the corkage fees listed on their menu.\n\nOverall, a solid place for homecooked Italian eats. I would sprint back to Legends just for that ravioli! Mangia!",4
1183,"This is a really small restaurant and is BYOB. The servers are friendly and the food was good. I ordered two appetizers (small plates) which were very good - greens and beans and then muscles. The flavours were both good, but the muscles were served with multiple closed shells which for the small portion was a negative. I don't have much to say about this experience....It was just a-ok.",3
1184,"OK, so based off the recommendation of my date, I thought  that I would like Legends North Shore but I left dinner disappointed and in need of a mint to mask the over abundance of garlic (salt) that I had consumed.\n\nThis restaurant is in a prime location on the North Side and has plenty of opportunity to capitalize on the growth in the area. That said, allow me to jump into some of the minuses:\n\nBeans and Greens appetizer - I love beans and greens, but was shocked by the amount of garlic the chef added. Actually, I don't think it was garlic...I believe it was garlic salt (a huge no-no) Don't get me wrong, I love garlic, but there was so much that it killed a simple, rustic dish.\n\nBlackened Shrimp Pasta - My date and I shared this dish. This dish tasted as though an entire container of garlic salt had accidentally been dropped onto the plate before being served. The shrimp and pasta, however, were cooked well. Had the chef backed off the garlic he would have presented a more edible dinner. i was not in the mood to send this dish back to the kitchen, but did call this out to the waitress once our meal concluded.\n\nThe restaurant is cute, in a great location, and service is friendly and prompt. These are all important things to me, but quality and taste takes precedence.  Unfortunately, Legends just didn't do it for me.\n\nWould I go back? Most likely not. There are far too many other Italian restaurants in Pittsburgh that I would like to give a try.",2
1185,"This restaurant is a gem. Wanted to check out another neighborhood in Pittsburgh. To an ignorant outsider, North Side didn't seem much more sketch than South Side or Oakland. \n\nAfter picking up two bottles of red at Wine and Spirits on Ohio Street, my team and I got a table at the warm, homey Legends of the North Shore, where it's BYOB. For appetizers we ordered the margherita bruschetta (best choice), fried polenta, and greens 'n beans (mainly because we went on a Tuesday when they had a special deal for 99 cents with any entree). The focaccia bread is great with the homemade mixture of olive oil and herbs. \n\nI ordered the mussels bianca over linguine--terrific. Also comes with shrimp. The portions are generous but delicious, in part because it's clear that the tomato sauces are all made fresh and in-house. I tried my coworkers gnocchi--good, but I was quite satisfied with my own dish. My coworker who ordered the eggplant parmigiano really enjoyed her dish as well.",4
1186,"Legends is good...but not special. It's just your typical Italian-American restaurant, but with a shorter menu than most. Huge portions of pasta, as expected. Started with Mussels Diablo which were good, but we had a lot of closed shells. I had the Penne alla Vodka and the sauce was good, especially with fresh basil leaves. The pasta was a bit overcooked. Basically, if you're Italian you know how to make this food at home. That doesn't make it bad, just A-OK!\n\nThe party next to us brought a bottle of grape Pucker vodka and tonic water as their BYOB. Hey, whatever works...",3
1187,"I've eat'n here a few times over the last couple of years and have been very pleased with both the food and service every time.  I most recently was there on this past Saturday, which I don't recommend showing up on a Saturday without reservations,  we got the last two seats at the bar and were lucky to get those.  We ordered the pasta special and it was amazing.  It was shrimp and crab ravioli in a white wine sauce, cooked with asparagus, roasted yellow peppers, and mushrooms.  It was probably the best ravioli I ever had.  It was topped with four huge pieces of shrimp cooked to perfection.  Most meals come with either soup or salad, either is guaranteed to be delicious, and some bread served with olive oil for dipping.  Some other things I've had that I really enjoyed were the spaghetti and meatball, the hot anti-pasta, and their fudge.  Everything has a very home cooked feel to it, better than mom used to make.  They also use the freshest of ingredients, the secret to any good Italian meal.  The service here is very good too, and very friendly.  If you want a good home cooked Italian meal and warm, friendly atmosphere, this is the place for you.",5
1188,"I ate here this past Friday evening with my girlfriend and two other dining companions.  I had made 7 PM reservations for us and we arrived shortly before that to a table that was ready for us.  The inside of the restaurant is actually much tinier than I had expected with as many people crammed in as possible.  It probably was helped that the night we were there, there was a party of 10+ next to us.  They would also order just before us understandably leading to some slower service times for us which I would guess is not the norm.  Other than it being crowded there was not much else in the dining room to look, just some table and chairs as well as some pictures on the walls.\n\nFor dinner my girlfriend and I decided to start of the evening with the polenta to share.  It came out cut into pieces and served with some sweet sausage and a pesto drizzle.  I thought that the sweet sausage was the best part of it with the polenta being ok while my girlfriend really enjoyed the polenta.  For our dinner entrees I ordered the Penne Vodka which came with a tomato basil cream sauce and prosciutto while my girlfriend went with the Penne Parma that had some artichoke hearts, roasted red peppers, olives and sweet sausage in a garlic wine sauce.  Both pastas also came with salads before the meal and both my girlfriend and I ordered the house balsamic dressing.  The salads came topped with many different things and I thought that they were pretty good salads for being included in the meal.  The Penne Vodka that I ordered ended up being really good!  It was delivered when still at a fairly hot temperature and I really enjoyed the sauce.  It's only peculiar item was that the prosciutto was almost off to the side and not in the pasta which I found to be odd but I still enjoyed it.  Even though I really enjoyed my pasta, I actually thought that my girlfriends meal tasted better.  The garlic wine sauce on hers was awesome and made each bite of her entr\u00e9e that I had a treat.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here again.  I was very happy with all of the food that we had and also loved that the prices were good for the quality of food that they were serving.",5
1189,"Legends of the North Shore on the top 25 restaurants in Pittsburgh list? I would have to disagree. I joined a three dining companions for dinner on a recent Friday night. When I walked in, I was shocked by how incredibly tiny it is inside. We were crammed at a table next to a large party. Our server was very matter of fact and to the point. What I would expect eating at a dinner, not a nice Italian restaurant. I decided to order the Penne Vodka with prosciutto and the wedding soup. The soup was nothing memorable. I enjoyed the crisp bread (foccacia) and oil better. When the entree's arrived, I was surprised that my Penne vodka was garnished with prosciutto. I assumed from the menu that there would be more proscuitto than a thin two inch slice on top of the dish. Overall, the sauce was very good. Not too creamy, not to tomatoey. However, I enjoyed my husband's gnocchi bolognese much more. The gnocchi was tender and the sauce was flavorful and meaty. All in all, I doubt I will be heading back to Legends. With so many great restaurants in Pittsburgh, Legends doesn't make my list.",3
1190,"Stopped by for lunch and was greeted by great-looking focaccia coming out of the oven. Based on that view, I decided to have the eggplant foccacia. It came with homemade Italian wedding soup, which was good with fresh veggies.  It also came with delicious bread and seasoned oil for dipping-- excellent!  The eggplant was good, but honestly, the sun dried tomato and olive tapenade did not enhance the sandwich. It would have rocked with a homemade marinara instead.  \nThe waitress was friendly in a casual way, and the atmosphere was warm and contemporary.  I will try something else next time, as it is worth a return visit!",3
1191,"After reading some peoples reviews I wasn't sure of this place. My boyfriend and I decided to go anyways. All I can say is, wow you people don't know food if you left a negative remark! Our food was phenomenal. The service was phenomenal. No it isn't a super fancy place, but the food is incredible and very reasonably priced. Our $56 dinner was worth every penny. I had a special, he had ravioli's and we split a desert. Amazing little place that I will 100% go to again.",5
1192,"Rated one of Pittsburgh's best in 2012 I was excited to enter Legends and prepare for  what was sure to be an amazing meal. Upon entering Legends, you get the immediate \""hole in the wall\"" vibe (a vibe that I love) with diner style tables and chairs. \n\nWe started with the margarita bruschetta. This was delicious increasing my already high expectations. Our waitress came back- I ordered the Penne Vodka and was excited, but overwhelmingly disappointed. The sauce, although good, is simply ordinary. I've been to countless Italian restaurants in Pittsburgh and could name at least 20 better than Legends.  \n\nHad Legends not received substantial praise I may have not been so disappointed, but when you're touted as one of the best I expect nothing short. To their benefit the restaurant is BYOB, maybe this gets so much praise because everyone's drunk before their meal is served...\n\nFood C+, Service B-",3
1193,"If I could give this restaurant a zero, I would. We were just asked by our waitress to leave because someone with a reservation was waiting for our table. My father and father-in-law were still finishing up their coffee and we had not yet finished our dessert! I've never been so humiliated. Do NOT go to this restaurant!\nTheir food was mediocre at best. If you want excellent Italian in a small intimate restaurant, go to Dish on the South Side. I will not be going back.",1
1194,"Caruso's is the best place to buy beer (and pop and snacks and smokes) on the northside by far. Hidden in its original spot in the Mexican War Streets, Caruso's is a home away from home. He has a wide range, from cheep crap to really really good stuff. If you don't see it he will try to get it in. You can go and just hang if you want as well. Dogs welcome. Family owned since 1930 and Sam has been there for 40 years. Do yourself a favor and stop by.",5
1195,"The best thing about this place is Sam. The worst thing about this place is also Sam.\n\nWhat was great was that Sam made me feel at home and treated me like someone he had known for a long time. He took me to the back of his warehouse, gave me a free beer to drink, and engaged me in plenty of conversation. At one point, though, he said, \""You look oriental, but you also look American.\"" I'm pretty sure he wasn't meaning for it to be offensive, and I just discounted it as his being an old man who didn't know it was no longer politically correct to say things like that.\n\nThis is not why I recommend against Caruso's, however. The reason why I'll never go there again is because Sam knowingly sold me expired beer.\n\nI was on my way back from the North Side to the East End where I live and after seeing these good reviews, I decided to stop by. I wanted a case of Yuengling, but Sam said, \""Why don't you try this instead,\"" and popped open a fresh bottle of Castello, an Italian beer. He had me drink it, all the while espousing its comparative taste to Yuengling at a cheaper price point. It certainly tasted alright, and a case of it was a couple dollars less than what Yuengling was going for.\n\nSince the Castello tasted fine, I ended up buying a case of it on Sam's recommendation. A few days later when I opened the box and drank a couple of the beers, however, I noticed that they tasted funny. That's when I looked at the label and saw how each of the bottles had its \""sell by\"" date marked out in black Sharpie. You could see the numbers underneath the Sharpie, and the dates were for well over two years ago. So basically, Sam had convinced me to buy something he hadn't been able to sell, knowing that I lived in the East End and probably wasn't going to visit again anyway.\n\nStale beer aside, there's another big reason not to go to Caruso's: Their prices are steep--$24 for a case of Yuengling. While Sam might be a more charming character than the young folks at my neighborhood distributor Pistella's, at least I know that Pistella's has significantly lower prices and actually has enough customers and product turnover that they won't purposely sell me something that's not fresh.",1
1196,"Awful.  I didn't know how bad it was until I went to a different GE and saw how good it could be.  The lines are long, the produce selection is minimal, and the store is overcrowded.\n\nThe last straw was yesterday when the cashier blew her nose, stuck kleenex up her nose, then put it back in her pocket and continued to scan groceries.  When I complained to the manager, they denied any of their employees were sick.\n\nI'm done shopping at this store.",1
1197,"Scariest/shadiest grocery store experience in my life. Hubby and I pulled in only to see a few cars down, people selling who-knows-what out of their car trunk. Also this is the only Giant Eagle tht gives you a really hard time if you ever forget your advantage card and give your phone no instead (it works at the other ones just fine). Then we leave by waiting for a really dazed/swaying woman to finish wandering around back and forth in front of us, and pass by a drive-by fat cash exchange (drugs?) on our way out of the parking lot. We are definitely scared to return, and will never need grapes (or any other groceries) so desperately again.",1
1198,"The store reeks of rotting fish, the security guards watch you like a hawk and the food selection is the worse I've seen in any Giant Eagle in the city.\n\nOne plus if you must shop here there are plenty of jitney drivers waiting for you to come out to offer you a ride.  That can be a big help if you are like me and don't have a car. \""Need a car\"" haha some things about living in the hood just never change. \n\nWith this being the closet G E to Downtown and PNC Park and Heinz field I would think they would renovate but it's been years and still no change.",1
1199,"Awful.  Worst grocery store I've ever been to.  To make it worse, they are supposed to open at 7.  At 7:10, I was told they were \""still getting ready to open\"" and I should come back \""around 7:30\""",1
1200,The store has a weird rotting meat smell sometimes. The selection isn't amazing but there are a few interesting items here. As other people commented there are always people hanging around outside.... But they are friendly at least to me! One thing I like about the store is the proximity to my house. The biggest let down is the sky high prices that I think GE is notorious for... I miss Kroger,1
1201,"Zero stars? Really terrible store. High prices, THE WORST PRODUCE EVER (And no, it isn't the lighting...) and rude employees. \nNever mind the people hanging out out front and in the parking lot, who cares. What I'm truly concerned about is the vast discrepancy between this store and very nearly all of the other Giant Eagle locations in the Pittsburgh area. One would assume that there would be some quality control within their chain of stores. Truly sad that the North Side has so few options at which to shop for reasonably priced, fresh food. \n\nAlso, enjoy getting followed around by the walleyed \""undercover\"" employee. Looks like Lurch from the Addams Family. Good riddance.",1
1202,"It's close to my neighborhood, hence the 2 star. \nbut seriously, it's like Walmart stuff at Whole Food's price. for the same item, it charges substantially higher (~40%+) than Target -which is not even known for cheap grocery.  \nI still go there because it's close, and I go for specific items on sale so it's not bad. But overall the store is way too pricy - for no good reason! which is probably the reason it gets on my nerve the most! over the years I've frequented many pricy groceries: Andronico's (CA), Morton Williams (NY), Wegman (MD), and Whole Foods everywhere - and these stores all had one common quality: they carry nice stuff! When I want to cook pretentious gourmet food, they have every ingredient ready. I don't expect every store to be cheap and carry good stuff like Trader Joe's, ergo I was never the one to oppose stores just because they're pricy. But this one is just pricy unjustifiably. You can over charge me on truffle oil and duck confit, but I'm not happy to be charged double on corn syrup and canola oil. Same brand, same item, nearly double the price. even the CVS downtown don't overcharge as much so don't say this is for the location. This is the definition of a rip off.",2
1203,"So I got a call from Giant Eagle asking me to give my opinion of this store. My recommendation was to burn this place to the ground. Buckle up for crappy produce, rotten fish, old meat, and security guards that speck you be stealin! This is the Gh**to Eagle!",1
1204,"This Giant Eagle is one of the few that only use the Giant Eagle name, but is owned independently of the Giant Eagle company. It is a franchise, which may explain why it is such a dump.\n\nTo shop here, you first have to get into the store, which means dodging bums and people selling EBT cards just outside the store. \n\nOnce inside, you have to find a cart that has all 4 wheels, travels in a straight line, doesn't make squeeky noises, and isn't wet or filled with trash. \n\nThen go to the produce department. Whenever I go to the produce department of any other grocer, I notice some of the produce has fallen on the floor, and some has rolled under the shelves. I'm almost positive that this produce is collected and sent to the Cedar ave Giant Eagle.\n\nThis store is not clean.\n\nTo its credit, they still have people who bag groceries for you, and the staff are decent, especially considering the demoralizing nature of their work environment. The location is also very good.\n\nIf the Cedar Ave Giant Eagle wants to improve, it needs to hire security to keep the parking lot clear of panhandlers, get new shopping carts, get rid of the self-checkout registers, improve their produce department, and have an overnight cleaning team. Until then, they will keep pushing me and everyone else to shop with their competition.",2
1205,"OK-- I need to stick up for this store after reading these other reviews.  I live nearby and have shopped here multiple times a week for the past year or so.  I find this store to be consistently clean and the employees to be helpful, polite, and efficient.  Despite being much smaller than most Giant Eagle stores, this one offers a decent selection of international foods, organic products, and vegetarian/vegan items.  I regularly buy produce here and see no difference between the quality/freshness of what this store offers and what other Giant Eagle stores sell.  The main difference in the produce section is, truly, the lack of dim, directional lighting that new and newly renovated stores use to give their produce that false garden-fresh glow.  Harsh overhead lighting doesn't create much of a mood, but at least I can see clearly enough to choose the freshest items.\n\nAs for all the remarks about this store's clientele...wow.  It's amazing how people in the politically-correct 21st century manage to find new ways to express 19th-century bigotry.  All the comments about \""thugs\"" and \""bums\"" and \""EBT cards\""?  Why don't you just say what you mean?  Better yet, just stay in the homogenous suburbs where you can buy your mood-lit grapes among \""your kind.\""\n\nNo, this isn't the world's greatest grocery store.  Yes, I sometimes fantasize that it will close and a Trader Joe's will move in.  But it's not the terrifying, stinking hellhole full of rotten food and sneering employees that these other reviews portray it to be.  In dozens of trips here, I've never had anything but an ordinary, inoffensive shopping experience.  Do you really need more from a small, neighborhood grocery store?",3
1206,It wasn't as horrid as the reviews would lead you to think. Just don't expect a gleaming suburban-style mega-mart and you will be fine.,3
1207,"I hate to agree with the other poor reviews of this branch, but this is definitely far from the best Eagle in the city. I'll say upfront that I never felt unsafe the three times that I have been here. However, the quality of the produce from my experience is pretty poor. The lines are always long and take forever to get through. Furthermore, the stuff in the bakery and goodies are below par. I'd recommend stopping in another Giant Eagle if you can. However, this location DOES have a Redbox, which is nice.",2
1208,"I've had a lot of bad experiences at this store. The employees have been rude so much that I just expect them to roll there eyes when I get deli meat. Lines are long, and there's always a crowd of people hanging out front begging for money, cigarettes, or trying to sell their food stamps. \n\nI have filed a complaint with corporate about this store before and I was contacted by a manager. I do have to say, that this manager really, sincerely cares about this store and customer experience. I talked to him for 20 minutes and he was polite and friendly. His name is Mr. Youngblood, and he urges you to ask for a manager if you're having a bad experience.\n\nProduce selection is terrible, there is not a meat counter in store, and it's just feels dirty. \n\nThis is the only grocery store on the north side, so it's not as easy to \""just go somewhere else\"" sometimes when you get off work, you don't want to drive 10 minutes to go to Kuhns on mcknight.",2
1209,Why all the hate for this Giant Eagle? Sure it's not in the ritzy part of town but they have everything all the other Giant Eagles have. I've never gone here and not found what I needed. Don't be scared of people just because they are different than you. This Giant Eagle gets the job done and is fine by me! BTW the charmingly ghetto picture is hilarious and we'll fitting! Bravo!,3
1210,The problem with this dry cleaner is poor counter service.  I have never been treated in such a poor manner - and the sad part is that this SERVICE provider doesn't care.  I recommend going elsewhere.  They are not worth my money.,1
1211,"I went here on a Saturday night with a few friends.  They had  a DJ so there was a cover of $3 - boo!  I'm really adverse to covers unless there's something really great going on and considering I had never been in this place before, I was taking a chance.  For those that know me, I'm not the gambling kind.  \n\nBut I thought ok it's just $3 so it's not like I'd be going broke.  The music was fairly loud which made it difficult to talk and no one was dancing.  It wasn't overly crowded which made it easy to get drinks.  \n\nAm I glad I checked this place out - sure, but have I been to better dance clubs/bars - yes.  If you're in the area and looking for something to do, then check it out, but I wouldn't make a special trip to go here.",2
1212,Get me some Peanutzz!! We decided on a whim to try something different for a bar and this place indeed was. Saturdays there is a cover for the DJ which was $3. This didn't seem so bad to me after coming from other cities where the covers are $15 and $20 and higher but I feel like the place could use the money. Peanutz is a small venue. The bar area is narrow and cramped then to the left of it there is a dark area where the DJ is along with some tables and then the stairs to the bathroom. If you weren't at the bar then people were just sitting at the tables starring at the DJ or at you... Maybe one or two people were dancing to the music. I thought the music was awesome though - a mix of old school and underground hip hop. Beers were so cheap - I think we paid $5 for three draft beers. Woot!! However some folks were smoking and the bathrooms were gross. My jacket took a few days to air out the smell of the smoke. I won't be returning even if Peanutz offered some peanuts.,2
1213,"I am a pretty easygoing guy. I would've overlooked the fact(s) that:\n\n1. Jim Beam is your only bourbon. \n2. For some reason two drinks came out to $9.90.* \n3. Even with only 10 people in the bar, the music was absolutely deafening. \n4. You charge a $3 cover for no discernible reason.\n5. Rolling blunts is apparently kosher inside the bar, but sharing, not so much.\n\nHowever, I can't let this slide: your claw machine is BULLSHIT. That is the weakest claw of all time, and there's no chance it is EVER picking up anything in that cage. I feel violated, and I want my dollar back. \n___________\n\n*I think that's some sort of weird PA tax thing.",2
1214,"To start, the bathrooms are DISGUSTING, with that being said I would never EAT anything here again.  This is a neighborhood bar for me.  I've been in here a handful of times, the crowd is never rowdy or out of control.  The bar area is clean and the restaurant has a very nice mellow atmosphere. I normally only drink Coor Light drafts which are 2.75!!! that's a lot of beer for less than 3 dollars.  I have had the wings in the past, before I saw what a disaster the bathrooms were.  They fry their wings to order and they come out hot and fresh. \n\nThe patrons are a older work crowd, not too may youngsters here.  \nI have enjoyed myself here and will probably be going back again this weekend.",2
1215,Our bartender didn't know what a pint was or how to pour a beer,1
1216,"I haven't been a member of the Allegheny YMCA for very long, but I've had a great experience so far.\n\nThe building itself is on the older side -- I'd guess it's probably about 100 years old.  The equipment, however, is pretty modern, and many of the rooms have been retrofitted for modern gym conveniences such as air conditioning.  \n\nThe Allegheny YMCA has the following features:\n1) A room with cardio machines (some traditional elliptical trainers, some of the newer breed of elliptical trainers that are like a mating between a stair-stepper and an elliptical, rowing machines, and exercise bikes).  Most of the cardio machines are only about a year old and have those weird little TVs mounted on top, so you can see Barack Obama's mouth silently moving as you get your workout.\n2) A basketball court with a track on top of it (28 laps = 1 mile).\n3) A spinning studio.\n4) A pretty decent weightlifting room, with a good balance between weight machines and free weights.  There's also a good range of free weights, so a weakling like me and a strong man like the dude I saw with biceps bigger than my waist can both use the weight room.\n5) A pool that is not Olympic size, but is big enough to get in a decent workout by swimming lengths.\n6) Secure access to the women's locker room (as well as to the fancy men's locker room).\n7) A group exercise room.  Group exercise classes are included in the membership fee, and the instructors are really nice and also inspiring/motivating.  There's a good range of classes for all ages and fitness levels, including Pilates, yoga, water aerobics, spinning, and cardio kickboxing.\n\nThe membership fees are pretty reasonable here (a family membership for 2 adults and 2 children is $58/month plus a $125 joining fee), and if you are employed by UPMC, you get an additional discount.\n\nMost importantly, the Allegheny YMCA is a very welcoming place, regardless of your age, gender, or current fitness level.  Gyms can be intimidating if you aren't in the greatest shape to begin with, and some gyms have members who aren't kind towards women who aren't super-fit or super-skinny.  But at the Allegheny Y, everyone I have met has been extremely friendly and nice to me, which is the best incentive to keep going to the gym.",5
1217,"I'm still giving this Y five stars because I like the other patrons and the atmosphere so much; I just want to re-evaluate the place now that I've gotten way better at various activities.\n\nThe cardio room is still really, really good.  I've never had to wait for a machine, and the machines are quite nice and new still.  \n\nThe weightlifting room is also totally adequate, with pretty much a full complement of machines (older, but still serviceable), and a good assortment of free weights and related paraphernalia, including a Smith machine and a regular good ol' power cage.  There isn't any platform for Olympic lifts, and I haven't seen anyone in here perform them (there isn't a lot of room, so I'm not really sure how one would even go about powerlifting safely in this gym.)  However, there is a bucket of chalk in one corner.  Go figure.\n\nThe pool is fine if you aren't really hardcore into swimming.  If swimming is a major form of exercise for you, however, it might not be the best pool for your needs.  It's a four-lane pool, I think 25 yards long.  It is heavily chlorinated, and it tends to be QUITE warm, especially on Monday mornings (this is because kids with sickle-cell anemia use the pool on Sundays, and the water needs to be especially warm for them -- it hasn't cooled down yet by Monday.)  Since I am at Pitt, I have access to the pool at Trees Hall, which is superior by any metric, so I use that instead.\n\nI like this Y quite a lot and wouldn't consider switching, even though there are newer/fancier Y's in the area.",5
1218,"Four stars - not because the facility itself is stellar, it certainly needs updates and could use more space - but the staff was so friendly and helpful! The atmosphere was inviting and communal, really nice to see a Y that is still a full mission where men can stay and get on their feet. And art classes! And dodgeball! And I had a great workout in the gym.",4
1219,"Awesome spot to grab a dog for a buck. Nothing fancy, must standard ingredients and friendly service.",5
1220,Best place in the city to get a dog,4
1221,"Classic North Side staple.  The food is made to order, the service is fast, and the staff is great.  My stand order is hot dog with onions and a side of fries.  But the grilled cheese is also exceptional.  The lunch line can be unreal, so I usually just stop for dinner on my way home from work.\n\nCASH ONLY.",5
1222,"I really wasn't thrilled with our meal here. The service was fine, although a bit slow for a not-so-busy Wednesday night. We started with the breaded zucchini, which was about 90% breading, 10% zucchini. The breading was much too heavy and you could barely taste the vegetable.\n\nI had the parmesan crusted chicken with pasta, which seemed to be coated in the same breading they used on the zucchini, still too heavy and altogether flavorless. The chicken was cooked perfectly though, it just needed some spices and salt and pepper for goodness sake. The pasta was cooked well and the sauce was fine though. My husband was not thrilled with his pasta primavera, which was, strangely enough, very spicy (though the server did warn us about this beforehand, to her credit) and again, not much flavor and many of the veggies not cooked thoroughly.",2
1223,"STAY AWAY...\nWe've been 3 times over the past few years, each time we say \""let's try it again\"" followed by \""wish we'd done something else\"".\n\nReminds me of the movie line \""Run away, run very far away\""\n\nLast nite after Steelers/Jets was last straw. I hope the owner or general manager reads this. And think the health department should too.\n\nService is mediocre and slow. consistently. Waitress was ok in attitude.\n\nAfter our soup starter (good french onion soup) we waited and waited and waited and waited for our mains. Noticing us staring at her, waitress stopped by, went into kitchen, came back and said we were next. my watch said 8:31. Then her manager came by and argued with me and said we were next, then at 8:52pm the horrible food finally arrived. That's 21 minutes to be next. In that time we watched 4 tables turn from being seated to drinks to mains to check down while we waited for our main. \n\nManager embarrassed himself. Said they were busy and working our food and he had checked and would come soon. I told him about the 4 tables turning and he said no they didn't. then I said I used to manage restaurants and know what customer service and ticket times are and he challenged me and said no I didn;t and I had no idea what I was talking about. What an idiot! First rule of restaurant business is the customer is always right.\n\nThen the food arrived. How hard is it to do chicken marsala with mushrooms, seriously? It was two soggy fried chicken tenders from the deep fryer (not pan sauteed) over a bowl of bowtie pasta with shrooms and a sauce. While the sauce did have some marsala in it, it was full of sour cream and tasted like stroganoff and a little funny. The Penne ala vodka was sauteed canned tomatoes and no flavor. We were so hungry we ate most and left.\n\n1 hour later I was sick on the side of the road from the dinner and still feel really rough this morning.",1
1224,"I have been to Atria locations around the city - but this was my first time at the Atria's location at PNC Park on the North Shore of Pittsburgh. My young professional group had an event there last night, so it was a good chance to check it out. Our event was held upstairs, and since we had a small group, they wouldn't guarantee the private room downstairs. It worked for the most part, but those of us that sat in the back had trouble hearing the speakers, and the lights were dim. The noise from the diners downstairs plus the house music carried through and at times it was very loud and hard to hear. I would say that it's a good place for a group dinner, but not for a speaking event. I can't comment on food/drink as I didn't have any. The atmosphere is nice BUT I wasn't too impressed with the layout of the whole place. Didn't see to have a good flow to it. Also, the bathrooms upstairs where our event was were out of order, so everyone had to go downstairs to use the restrooms.",3
1225,"The food is good and the portions are large.  The service is terrible.  The servers are just \""too cool,\"" to show any sort of hospitality.  No personality or spark.  I don't know if they hate working there or hate serving people.  It's puzzling.  Why be in the service business if you have a bad attitude?  I have been here a couple of times and it doesn't change.  They just look at you blankly, like they don't understand what you are saying.  I've never had a staring contest with a hostess before.  It's bizarre.  I wonder if they are all on Xanax...",2
1226,"I love coming to PNC Park in the Summer. If i get here early enough i stop by atria's and have a scotch, Johnny Walker, rocks, no water, what did that scotch ever do to you? When i was eating meat I'd get the lobster bisque or a huge plate of pot roast nachos. The meat that covered those nachos were perfectly cooked with a nice char outside, moist and succulent inside. Lots of cheese and other nacho fixens. Good Stuff!\n\nThe burgers here are just as glorious, nice crisp outside, moist and tender inside, good bun, great bacon if i ordered it. Atria's is a great restaurant in PNC Park, but when i go to PNC Park, I want ballpark food. So I head to Atria's when the Bucs are out of town.",3
1227,"I feel bad about giving this place such a meh review but every time I go that's exactly how I feel when I leave. Atria's is one of those places that I've never had any type of memorable service experience or food experience for that matter.\n\nI can't say the food is bad, but it's not really great either. I will say the service is always so. It's almost as if they don't realize you have other places to go; you can just sit at their restaurant all day. On the upside the busboy's and girls are hounding your table filling your water glass after taking a sip. So if you're a horse you won't go thirsty.\n\nHonestly though. you are better off eating the park. I mean who doesn't love Manny's BBQ?",2
1228,"My husband and I are Cubs fans and flew into Pittsburgh to see Friday and Saturday's Cubs-Pirates game this past weekend (7/7 & 8).  We got to PNC Park around 5 p.m. and since the gates weren't open we decided to sit and have some drinks before the game.  We stopped first at Atria's.  Although there was only one other table occupied outside, we were told if we weren't going to order food (just drink) we would have to give up our table if people, who were eating food needed it.  This was RIDICULOUS  to us so we left!  We were paying guests just like their other guests!!  Anyway we went a few businesses down and drank at Dominic's.  We went to Dominic's both nights and probably spent close to $100 AND did up getting FOOD.  Atria's better rethink how they treat guests....",1
1229,"Ugh, I hate this place.  People from work drag me here to lunch more often than I would like.  The food is overpriced.  The service is snotty and slow.  I can barely get free in under an hour-and-a-half.  The food is forgettable and the menu sparse.  They're terrible for pick-up too - even when you call way ahead, you're made to wait, and they're surly about taking care of you when you arrive for your food.  You can do better for lunch on the northshore pretty much anywhere.  Try SoHo or Finnegan's instead.",1
1230,"The food is acceptable. They have a pretty wide range, but narrow the menu on Pirates game days. I tried the seared ahi tuna. It was good, but nothing memorable. The location appears to be the best thing about the place. Sitting outside on a warm evening, looking at the city skyline and seeing people walk around before a Pirates game is an interested dinner experience. But don't go for the menu.",2
1231,"I wasn't expecting 4 star service. We walked in and had to wait 5 minutes before one of the servers noticed us since the hostess wasn't at her post. He took us to the banquet room and seated us at the last table in the front. The tables had plastic table cloths that have seen better days ours had holes in it and still had some caked on super stain sauce in one area. Then we waited 20 minutes before our waitress came to greet us. She took our drink order and our dinner order. (pretty simple since it was a prix fix menu with only choices for soup or salad and a choice of ham or turkey and either Apple or Pumpkin Pie). She brought the drinks right away. Then 10 minutes for the salad/soup -- very tasty, but no rolls were delivered to go with and no sign of the waitress. One of the employees goes out the emergency exit door located directly behind me (BLAST OF COLD AIR) Only after finishing the first course did she bring the rolls/butter and didn't clear the dirty plates. Another 15 minutes passed before the waitress stopped by the table and cleared the dirty dishes. (THE HOSTESS COMES IN FROM OUTSIDE THROUGH THE DOOR WITH A BLAST OF COLD AIR) A minute later she came by and said our main course would be along in a minute and she proceeded to go out the door directly behind me. (MORE COLD AIR) The main course was delivered by a food runner. The turkey was tasty and just a little on the dry side and needed more gravy, but there was no sign of our waitress to even ask for more gravy. Eating as slowly as possible so as to have the opportunity to get gravy for the turkey there simply was no attention paid to us. (ANOTHER EMPLOYEE GOES THROUGH THE DOOR, MORE COLD AIR) Finally the waitress comes over and asks how was it, I explain that the cold air is too much to handle. THE EMPLOYEE WHO WENT OUT CAME BACK IN AND WE ALL GET BLASTED BY COLD AIR. She replies it is what it is and shrugs and walks away. She must have said something to the manager, because he comes over to ask how our meal was. I reply that it was just OK, that the food was good for the most part (he gave a shocked reply because I didn't say it was great) but that I was disturbed with the number of times the employees kept using the door to go outside to smoke. He seemed shocked to learn that that door was being used at all and said he'd put a stop to it. We said that we usually tip 100% on holiday meals like this since the workers have to give up a day with their family but that since the staff didn't seem to care as much about us, so we would not be doing 100% tip this time. I explained that we don't expect any kind of comp, but that he needed to know that his employees were making the dining room uncomfortable by using the emergency exit for their smoke breaks and social encounters. He said he was sorry for our experience and left the table. Our waitress eventually stopped by and we requested our pie packed to go. She delivered the pie and the bill at the same time. -- it isn't over yet. . . .  While in the process of signing the bill the hostess comes over to request the chairs at our table. I explain to her that we are leaving. She was very impatient and said she only needed a minute to take the chairs and I scolded her saying that we are leaving right away and to give us 30 seconds to sign the check and she can have all the chairs at our table she scuffed off to take chairs from an empty table and blocked our attempt to exit while she was struggling to move the chair she grabbed. We chose to exit through the main dining room and bar as should be the practice for all patrons and employees. Like I said to the manager, we consider ourselves to be fairly regular patrons of Atria's PNC Park, and Atria's Fox Chapel -- but this was the worst service I've ever for an Atria's Restaurant. I don't want anything for publishing this review other than people to be highly aware of the lack of common sense by the staff on this particular day. I'll eat at Atria's again but it will be with some trepidation and with high caution that they'll probably screw something up so I have to be on high alert to get what I pay for. Posting this on Facebook and to yelp and tripadvisor might help get the owner's attention. The place could be great if they just had proper training, rules and regulations for their staff and a dose of common sense.",2
1232,"As your standard restaurant, Atria's has no personality: the food is blah, the service is eh, and nothing is really all that memorable.  The patio and it's proximity to the ball parks are its saving grace.  \n\nNow, let's talk about when we reserved a room for a bridal shower...  We had a fixed menu for a group of about 50 ladies.  I understand that.  But when the bride asks for no tomatoes, you as a server do not say, \""No substitutions!\"" in your meanest voice.  Lighten up, it's her day.  I ended up just taking the tomatoes off for her--and just chalked it up to another maid of honor duty.  The server also kept clearing the bride's drinks while she mingled.  This was annoying, but at least we had paid a flat fee for drinks, so it wasn't the hugest deal.\n\nOverall, the server for the bride's table was just awful and kept treating us like little children.  Yes, the table was the bridal party and the bride's cousins.  Yes, we are all under 30.  But we are also young professionals and the ones who booked the event.  The servers who waited on the rest of the tables containing the mothers, aunts, great aunts, and grandmothers were polite...even when my near-senile grandmother started yelling about bandits.  Later, another server apologized on behalf of our bad server and mumbled that, \""he just must be on his period.\""\n\nWhile Atria's is fine for a glass of wine before a Pirate's game if a table is open outside, I certainly would never book it again for a private function.",2
1233,I think the low marks for this place are unwarranted. Quality of food at this location is every bit as good as the other Atria's around town. Pot roast nachos are out of this world!,4
1234,"Having lived near this Atria's location in the past, I can say that I've spent more than my fair share of time at the PNC Park Atria's. My wife and I stopped in this past week, and for me, I was reminded of why I enjoy Atria's...but this having been our first time at Atria's together, and witnessing my wife's experience, I realized why the place could garner such low reviews.\n\nFor someone like myself, who's actually had enough positive and negative food experiences at Atria's to know exactly what to order and what to steer clear of, I can make the experience a positive one, but that's a situation I'm afforded now thanks to my previous patience and convenience. My wife, opting to stray from my suggestions had an awful dinner. Her plate of bland fish and asparagus left her turned off completely. Luckily, we were using a gift card, so it wasn't as frustrating for her as it could've been. Regardless, walking away from an entire plate of food is disheartening.\n\nThat led me to realize this: If you're only at Atria's once, you're odds aren't that great of having a good experience. That's just the reality of the situation. There are a handful of really good things on the menu that I LOVE. The parmesan crusted chicken is really good, although it can sometimes be a little too oily. The pot roast is excellent, but it's way too heavy for most of the year...ESPECIALLY during baseball season when they're busier. Their chili is really on-point...especially paired with their bread, and the salmon salad is excellent. Although, I don't like the salmon, so I swap the salmon for chicken for a great salad option. The carrot cake is insanely good, but truth be told, it's not homemade. I could care less, though, as it's still some of the best carrot cake I've ever eaten. Period. Other notable items are the pot roast nachos, crab cakes, red skin smashed potatoes, and the reuben.\n\nThat's really where the positives end, though. I've learned to steer clear of the burgers because of the inconsistency with which they're prepared. I've received more undercooked burgers at Atria's than any other restaurant, and it's just not worth the gamble anymore. My filets have always been perfectly-prepared, but the one time I got a strip it was practically burned on one side and undercooked on the other. Failing to cook burgers and steaks correctly isn't that surprising, but deciding to serve them to customers despite their incorrect preparation IS surprising...and poor.\n\nI know that the last time I had salmon on my salad, the fish tasted \""off\"" and I paid the price for it later. I've never given a single fish meal a chance there since (we're talking years now). Hence, my request for chicken on my salads now. Most of the meals that I've had are average, and I've practically tried the entirety of the menu over the years, so believe me when I say it.\n\nWhy do I continue to go? Well, because the few items that I do love, are crave-worthy, and having become a regular (less so, nowadays), the service that I received at the bar was always excellent. Daniel and Roy have always provided  great service to me, and good service goes the distance, as far I'm concerned, so it's been worth stopping in from time-to-time. Unfortunately, if I can't sit at the bar, I don't always stick around, as the service at the tables is really hit-or-miss. For every good server they have, they have two more that could care less about their jobs...especially during peak times.\n\nRegardless, this is my favorite Atria's location, because it's the least \""stuffy\"" and pretentious location of them all, but there's still a lot of room to improve...and I hope it does.",3
1235,Atria's is a pretty good restaurant if you're at or near PNC Park - as expected from anything located in a ballpark it's not the best restaurant ever but it's consistently decent.  On different visits I have tried the Margherita Flatbread and Cheese Dip which were both fine (although the fried pita chips were really salty) as well as the Diablo pasta which was okay and the Pork Filet Gorgonzola which was quite good.  In an ideal world I would walk over the bridge and eat at a more unique restaurant downtown but when I have to choose from something nearby Atria's is one of the better choices.  A number of my colleagues prefer this as their go-to restaurant and while I'm not quite as enamored as them I definitely consider this an A-OK restaurant and I'll be back.,3
1236,"Located right next to PNC Park, so is a decent place to get a beer and some grub prior to game day. That and outdoor seating are main perks. Otherwise, food and prices are not worth a stop. This place will fill up on game day, but should be avoided when the Pirates aren't in town. It isn't a BAD experience. If you are siting outside and you have a view of Pittsburgh, it can't be that bad.",2
1237,"I was neither particularly pleased nor dissatisfied with my lunch experience here... It was just \""meh.\"" It's kinda pricey for what you get, but the service is prompt and friendly and the music is fun and modern.\n\nThey serve a mean crab bisque. It was deliciously creamy, quite generous with the crab meat and very filling without that nasty sick after-feeling. The coconut shrimp (with a nice crunchy, coconut-y breading) was also very tasty, and the portion was satisfyingly large for an app! The house salad was just a typical salad of iceberg and romaine lettuce drenched in shredded cheddar cheese and sprinkled with a few other veggies. Nothing special.  Just a random quirk I noticed:  for being a rather classy restaurant, I was surprised that they didn't add a slice of lemon to my glass of water (though I'm sure you could ask for it).  \n\nWould I recommend the place? Probably not but it was certainly not a bad experience! Just one that didn't stand out for the money you'll spend.",3
1238,"I came here with a party of 40 very hungry Pitt students. The food was amazing. We had roasted beef, chicken, and pasta. The management was lovely and really involved during any party issues. The staff was also very kind and able to keep everyone's glass full, despite our camel like drinking habits. Thank you!",5
1239,"Here before Bucs VICTORY OVER THE CARDS in game 3 of the NLDS, a Sunday. Game at 4:30, got here at 2:30. Packed both inside and out. Can't comment on any other time but this really hectic one. \n\nOrdered Pepsi and brisket nachos. AWFUL. Soggy chips, some shredded beef drenched in sweet generic BBQ sauce, a blanket of cold congealed cheese spotted with jalape\u00f1o slices. Not a degree above room temp. \n\nWill give them 1 star for tasty Pepsi and keeping it filled.",1
1240,"Came in late night during Light the Night, just for for drinks and a snack. Service was fast, but the salad and cup of soup were disappointing. The chopped salad had weird cheap ingredients like celery and carrot. I was excited about the crab bisque, but they must have been running low and it must have been half sherry because it tasted like I was taking a shot of cheap white wine with every bite. Hope the dinner fare is better.",2
1241,"ok, i don't want to judge all atria's by this one. in fact, i wouldn't even judge this atria's solely by this one experience. but let me tell you, i was highly disappointed.\ni will point out the good parts of the night first. we arrived to see a band play. the entertainment was great, didn't cost extra (although there was a $20 minimum per person), and i liked the set up in the room where they played. also, the soup i got (crab bisque) was delicious!\nok, now, for the rest of the experience. first of all, our service was AWFUL. i don't know our server's name, and i know some of the wait wasn't his fault, as there was a large party upstairs. but it took at least ten minutes to even order our drinks, another 15 before we even got them. ten more minutes before we could order our food, and after the meal, we must have waited at least 15 if not 20 minutes for our check before one of the members in our party finally had to go up to our waiter and complain. i saw him checking on other tables, and it didn't seem like he had many tables to keep him so busy. as a server, myself, i always give my servers the benefit of the doubt, but it really got to be too much. the one thing i will say for him though, was that he was very nice. but for how much we waited, we should have had something comped or at least got some sort of apology BEFORE we had to complain.\nthe rest of the food and drinks were okay. good, but not enough to make up for the service. i had the berry mojito to drink and the greek salad to eat.\ni'd try another atria's before i'd go back to this one. but now i'm weary of the restaurant all together.",1
1242,I came here on the Fourth of July after getting off of work. My friend and I stopped for one drink before the fireworks. Let's just say I will never return. I stood there for a good 15 minutes with maybe 5 people tops at the bar. The bartenders never once acknowledged me yet they did manage to make eye contact. They then all walked out from behind the bar and went outside. It took another ten minutes until finally the manager came over and served me. I am a bartender and I am appalled to see such people being employed at what seems like a decent place. I am a phenomenal tipper being that I am in the industry and sadly I didn't leave a single dollar. Hopefully they can learn from their mistakes instead of probably losing more potential customers.  What a shame.,1
1243,"Average experience. The entrees that we chose (chicken marsala and chicken piccata) were fine but under seasoned. The cheese plate was the best part of the meal: four cheeses selected and served by Carole \""dear heart\"" from Penn Mac. Exceptional choices, good crusty bread and she's lovely and a Pittsburgh institution. \n\nService was spotty. I was there representing my company. We produced the music that evening. I'm not sure if the server assumed that we wouldn't be ordering food or what, but after we ordered the cheese course and wine, he came back only to attempt to take away our menus not to take our order. I had to ask to order entrees. It was just odd. I've heard similar things from others that have been there on our music nights.",3
1244,"After eating lunch several days a week at Atrias PNC Park restaurant for many years, I have finally decided that the price has just lost any relation to portions/quality and will not be dining there anytime in the near future.\n\nGradually, over the past year, the prices have continued to increase to the point of being dinner menu prices for lunch size meals.  Recently, the portion size has significantly diminished, to the point of being almost comical today.\n\nThe fish \""special\"" today was BBQ salmon with asparagus.  It consisted of about 3oz of salmon and four spears of asparagus.  It actually looked ridiculous on the plate.  The specials used to have 5-6 oz of fish, included a decent portion of vegetables, and rice, all for a dollar or two less.  While a bit more than I wanted to spend for lunch, at least the quality and size of portion made some sense.  Today, I spent $15 plus tax and tip and left feeling like I had eaten an appetizer and still hungry.\n\nThey have pushed it too far, I am no longer willing to waste my money at Atria's.  Too bad, we used to really enjoy lunch there.",1
1245,"I decided to check out downtown Pittsburgh on my trip for a family visit recently. We took a walk around the area and this location caught our eye. It had outdoor seating and was right outside of PNC Park. We decided on the Pot Roast nachos as an appetizer. It was pretty good. Nice chunks of Pot Roast and various cheeses. I than decided on the Atria combo which had andouille sausage, Perogies, Chicken and Sauerkraut. I figured that this would be something different. The sausage was great and so were the perogies. I did not care for the chicken too much. It was dark meat with bread crumbs. I prefer white meat so that was probably the reason. I also tasted my friends steak  hoagie. I am from the area so I have had better. It was a little dry and not enough cheese and onions. The outdoors ambiance was great! Pittsburgh has a great downtown. Nothing like Detroit. It was alive, various things to do and was a beautiful city. Overall the restaurant was a good experience. The waiter was great and funny also. We also talked to some people sitting beside us. it made for a good time. However, I would opt for another place when I visit again.",3
1246,"I was here on a business dinner and it firmly seated itself as the absolute WORST place I've ever eaten at. \n-hair in the food\n-crab cakes were touted as amazing, in reality disgusting ice cream scoops of poor crab and mayonnaise \n-\""risotto\"" uncooked and congealed to plate. \n-vegetables gummy and soaked in oil. Not properly prepped and served with woody stems. \n\nI was shocked this place turns a profit",1
1247,"Absolutely the best!!!  \n\nNot from Pittsburgh.  Was there on vacation with my kids.  They absolutely LOVED IT.  Even my youngest, who is hard to entertain, left the place praising it.  If you have kids and are in Pittsburgh, this is a great place to take them.  We have been to other city's children's museums and this is one of the best.\n\nThere are tons of stuff for them to do.  There is also a nice variety.  Something for everyone.  Even my wife and I were entertained.  The price of admission was well worth it considering movies are about $10 for only 1-2 hours.  We were there for at least 5 hrs and it didn't even feel like it.  The best was there were activities that left you with free \""souvenirs\"".  We left with various art creations that the kids made that were really cool.",5
1248,"Oh my God. They're playing the chicken dance song on their website! Bahaha!\n\nSo what is so great about this place? Mister Rogers of course! For those not in the know, Fred Rogers was from Pittsburgh, so of course there will be a great display of his world somewhere in the city. And here it is. \n\nBeyond that there are always cool displays up in the rest of the museem. Bottom line: Great for adults and kids alike, another of the must see Pittsburgh sites.",5
1249,"Why would I be writing a review of a Children's museum when I don't have any children?!  Because it's an awesome museum, that's why!\n\nBut in all seriousness, they throw the best parties, mostly because they have thee coolest space to do it in!  When you go to a party at the museum you're allowed to \""play\"" just like a kid would during regular business hours.  \n\nHave I gone down the twisted slide connected to the treehouse in a cocktail dress?  Yes I have!  Have I walked across the mini Pittsburgh bridge in the mini-Pittsburgh playroom?  Yes I have!  \n\nLike any good museum, they constantly have changing exhibits, so things I saw are probably not there anymore.  But the interactive exhibits are all about participation.  If it peeked my interest, I'm sure it would peek a child's! I have no doubt people of any age would have a great time here!",5
1250,This place is amazing from top to bottom. 2 hours down we are still here.,5
1251,"Good times for kiddies of all ages and grown up too. \n\nI especially love the art studio on the first floor, there is always 2 or 3  different art activities that are happening. \n\nMy niece had her birthday party here, in January, I felt a little rushed, because a few of our guests were late.  The Children's Museum supplied a craft and two party assistants, along with a large space for the guests. \n\nI don't know how much my sister in law paid for the party, but I get the feeling it was expensive. \n\nMy family and I get to enjoy this museum fairly often because it's across the street from my mom's house. It's a treat to have such a fabulous museum near by. \n\nBe sure to visit the water floor on the fourth floor, the kids never want to leave the museum after they've played in the water tables. It stretches from one way to the next. \n\nI have so many happy memories from this place, it totally rocks!",4
1252,"This place is a blast for kids of all ages! All floors are packed full of great fun for kids, and make this place a nice way to spend a lazy Saturday with your turbo-charged little one - just be sure you are well-rested before you go!\n\nThe only place that was a bit much was the water zone, but that's to be expected whenever you join a young child and lots of splashy water fun. Our little one looked like she worked on \""The Deadliest Catch\"" after she was done terrorizing the place, but it was well worth it to see her having such a good time; it's similar to the \""other\"" kids' museum nearby. They are renovating this exhibit, and it will be interesting to see how it evolves.\n\nLoved the art studio, the garage, and the nursery, where our little one really had a blast running around and playing with all of the activities. Obviously, the section on Mr. Rogers brought back all sorts of warm, fuzzy memories! Admission was completely reasonable, and a membership is totally worth it if you will visit with two adults and one child 3x in one year; you even get reciprocal admission to many science and childrens' museums nationwide!",5
1253,"I moved from Columbus, OH to Pittsburgh and was elated to find out that my COSI membership in Columbus was still usable at the Children's Museum. While C-bus's children's museum is mainly about science, Pittsburgh's has art and what not going on. \n\nMy son loves this place and has finally discovered the art room. He's not super creative but he likes the fact that he can pop on an apron and paint. He even threw a clay cup and silk screened some paper cut outs.\n\nThey have other workshop space where you can sew or build lil motors. The changing tough art exhibits are neat too. \n\nOn the downside, if an exhibit opens try to see it early. Simply because kids tear shit up. We went on the opening day of Clifford and by the final week props were missing and there were kid bite marks on Clifford's bones o.0 .",5
1254,"I love this museum! I've gone several times with friends and their children. There are so many fun things for kids to go, and so much to explore, even if you are an adult.\n\nKids seem to love the art stations where there are always a variety of crafts and items to create/construct. I love how they are always changing exhibits to stay current and keep things fun and creative for the regulars. \n\nMy favorite thing about this museum is the \""funhouse\"" slide area. My nephew loves this slide and loves the anti-gravity feel when he is inside. It's too fun!",5
1255,"Can't get an order right! 6 of the last 8 times we ordered they have messed it up.   I know, each time I forgive them and think they can't possibly mess up again, but they do.  Not only that, but they quote 45 minutes then take anywhere from 1-2 hours to deliver.  Wont be ordering from here again!",2
1256,"was in the neighborhood on a girls weekend. this place is fantastic.  great prices, great slice.  service is a tad bit slow (since they make it to order!) but the food is worth the wait. they seemed to be doing a great take out/carry out order,  If you are in the area, stop by . . . it is totally worth it!",5
1257,"Okay hold the phone, I wouldn't call Pickles an Emporium.\n\nI haven't actually eaten their sandwiches, what I typically order is the bacon cheddar fries, which are pretty damn tasty for a pizza shop.  Anyway on the bacon Cheddar fries there is tons of melted cheese and real bacon!!!  Oh yeah  a total guilty pleasure. \n\n\nAnyway, I was raised eating at Pickles. This was our go to pizza place at home but not due to quality, but more do their willingness to deliver to our house.  In the neighborhoods I live in \""the pizza man don't deliver around here anymore.\""  \n\n\nFor some tasty fries, I would highly recommend Pickles, for anything else I would suggest going else where.",3
1258,"I lived off of pickles in college!  The only downfall was their delivery time.  It always took almost an hour and a half to receive my food, 10 minutes down the road. \n\nI moved, still in delivery distance, and had a terrible experience.\nI called my order in and had a total of 11 and some change.  I told them I'd be laying cash.  When the delivery guy arrived he couldn't stop complaining about walking up my steps and I would have to meet him downstairs next time.  When I handed him a 20 he told me, sorry I don't have any change.  So he walked off with a 9 dollar tip after being terribly late, rude, and forgot my drink.\n\nGood food, but rude service on the phone and in person. \nI have not been back since.",2
1259,"I tried Pickles tonight for the first time.  I called ahead to order a gyro calzone and was told 20 minutes.  I got there and was told it would be another 10.   It was another 20 before I got my food.  In a bad frame of mind, I tried my food.  I must admit it was good.  Not great, but good.  I didn't have an issue with the place or the other patrons.  I dig that kind of place.  But if you tell someone a time, you should be able to deliver.  The food itself warrents a higher rating, but the overall experience was a disappointment.",2
1260,"I've enjoyed the pizza, salads, and hoagies we've gotten from Pickles. Delivery time was decent. Fries are really tasty, but need to be blanched, or at least punch holes in styrofoam container.",4
1261,"Went there for lunch today. Needing some food other than hospital food. Short walk to it from Allegheny General. \n\nThought about ordering lunch special,  but she said if we wanted more than two slices get the pizza on sale. 10 slice pizza for $8.25 and one topping. \n\nGreat pizza. Crust was excellent, tiny bit of garlic and lightly sweet. Ham was tasty Canadian bacon. Nice size to for price.  Pop sold by can at .85cents.\n\nLady at counter said she made crust and bread from scratch,  we could tell.\n\nI would have given it a 4 star but bathroom cleanliness held them back. I didn't add the street people into my review. The street is being revitalized so a lot of businesses are open and some closed. If it was farther from the liquor store the street people would not have been so plentiful.",3
1262,Don't do it! \n\nThe ribs are average at best. The sides are just as average as well. The bones are small and barely have any meat on them at all. The greens were decent and the macaroni salad was awful with tons of water in it. \n\nThis place is almost as bad as the now closed Mr Willie's BBQ in Squirrel Hill! I had such high hopes for this place. Oh well. That's what I get for trying to cheat on Showcase BBQ in Homewood. Now those are the best ribs in Pittsburgh and some of the best in the country! \n\nThey don't take debit or credit cards. Cash Only!,2
1263,"The ribs were great with mild sauce.  The chicken with hot sauce was ok.  Hot sauce was nice and hot,  but not the greatest flavor.  Mild sauce was delicious.  Slaw wasn't very good.  Mac salad was good.  Collard greens... Well,  not for me... \n\nDefinitely worth a visit.",3
1264,"We love the ribs here.  Watch out, the spicy sauce is really spicy.  The location is nice to grab something for a tailgate party.  Never disappointed, although the place looks like a dive, it's actually really really good.  I wish they still made pulled pork sandwiches, maybe someday...",4

1273,"I wanted to choose something special for my 100th review.  It has to be something near and dear to my heart...I choose to rate my most favorite professional sports team, the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nBeing that I was born in Western Pennsylvania and raised in Pittsburgh during the dawn of the Steel Curtain, the Immaculate Reception, and the four Super Bowls in the late 70's and early 80's, it is hard to find a better reason to not rate this sports team a 5 Yelp Stars.  Now that the 21st Century is started....2 more Lombardi trophies were added.  I am not saying dynasty, but this team has a history of success and it is not hard to say for a small market team...this team is very successful.\n\nAs a fan of National Football League and the Pittsburgh Steelers, this team is a model for the way other organizations should be managed.\n\nDallas and San Francisco are in the holding pattern at 5 Super Bowls.  New England, New York Giants, and the Indianapolis Colts' does not have the history and only time will tell.....here we go Steelers, here we go!!!",5

Vegas owns the NFL!  Sheiiit!!!",1

From the ownership, the players, stadium, to the fan base we have it all. The ONLY downfall of being a Steeler fan is that trying to get tickets is about as difficult as trying to catch a cheetah in the open prairie. \n\nFor those that want to experience what this is like bad can't land tickets to the game I would recommend going 2-3 hours before the game and join in the tailgating festivities. Once the game starts take your friends over to one of the many northside bars to enjoy the game. McFaddens and Bettis's are tops on that list.",4

1277,"I have been a Steelers fan as long as I can remember. I love the Steelers as a sports team, BUT this week I am very disappointed. Tisk Tisk Steeler higher ups. This does have to do directly with Steelers policy not Heinz Field.\n\n I have a 9 month old daughter and I was so looking forward to taking her to her very first Steeler game! Now, she is a very very good baby and in social situations I have been able to take her everywhere. She loves people and loves to take in new and exciting experiences. The point of this is that she would be well behaved, laughing at a Steelers game, and most likely clapping with rowdy fans not throwing a temper tantrum and disrupting the game for others. I would take her out if she was upset, believe me I get it!\n\nI feel that The Steeler organization is trying to weed out the younger crowd by charging full price for a ticket and a seat that a baby can't even use. Most kid friendly places don't charge for Children 2 and under, that includes Aiirlines in the US, museums, fairs, Zoos, Concert Venues, Pitt games(at Heinz Field) Baseball games(PNC park), and many more less opulent businesses.  \n\nAs far as the Steelers are concerned even though your child won't be using a seat they have to buy a full price ticket. I asked about Club level seating and yes especially in the club. Which would be the best place to walk around and entertain a youngster if fussy. If you purchase non club seating then it doesn't matter where your baby sits if you have lower level seats. Getting 3 seats together can be much pricier than a pair and are harder to find. I asked why this was the policy and an unfriendly person told me that \""Steeler Policy states that gate operator is not incumbent to assess a childs age of 2 or under so they do not have the resources available for gate entry for people in line entering the stadium.\""\n\nSorry but considering the Pirates allow free entry under 2 and offer discounted tickets for children under 2 if they want to participate in the activities for children's days.

It was bad. Totally skimpy on the meat, and it had American cheese and mayo, which don't go well with Italian meats at all...provolone and oil & vinegar would have made way more sense. The bread was a squishy white bun. I mean, I still ate it, but I didn't really enjoy it. It made me kind of sad. It was just a sad, floppy excuse for a sandwich.

Alas a bad losing streak towards the end of the summer brought the team down in the standings, but a lesson learned, at least they know they can win.

An article in the paper said that they were playing small ball, which must eman they're working on the little things, the fundamentals.  \n\nNow let's see if we can keep the momentum going for the rest of the season and finish with at least a winning record for a chiange.

But was a winning season too much to ask for?  This marks the 20th anniversary since the Pirates' last winning season.  That's right folks--it's been since 1992.  Let's take a look at the world of 1992.\n\nBASEBALL:  The Pirates' roster that year included Stan Belinda, Doug Drabek, Zane Smith, Denny Neagle, Jay Bell, Orlando Merced, Andy Van Slyke, and of course Barry Bonds.  All have since retired.  The only new ballparks were New Comiskey Park (now U.S. Cellular Field) and Camden Yards.  No stadiums had corporate names.  The Arizona Diamondbacks, the Colorado Rockies, the Miami Marlins, and the Tampa Bay (Devil) Rays didn't exist.  The Washington Nationals were the Montreal Expos.  The Milwaukee Brewers were in the AL.  Both the NL and the AL only had two divisions each.  The minor league Washington Wild Things didn't exist either and nor did their league.  KBL was the big cable sports channel.\n\nTV:  \""Saturday NIght Live's\"" cast included Dana Carvey, Ellen Cleghorne, Chris Farley, Tim Meadows, Mike Myers, Kevin Nealon, Phil Hartman,  Chris Rock, Adam Sandler, Rob Schneider, and David Spade.  \""Seinfeld\"" hadn't become a huge hit yet and no one knew Kramer's first name.  Monday nights on NBC included \""Murphy Brown\"", \""Evening Shade\"" and \"" Northern Exposure\"".\n\nMOVIES:  The top movies included \""Lethal Weapon 3\"", \""Basic Instinct\"", \""Hone Alone 2\"", \""The Bodyguard\"" and \""Aladdin\"".  When you wanted to watch movies at home, you had to rent them from the video store and you watched them on VHS tapes or laserdiscs.  \n\nMUSIC:  Bruce Springsteen released \""Lucky Town\"" and \""Human Touch\""  on the same day.  R.E.M. had \""Automatic for the People\"".  Gin Blossoms released their first album \""New Miserable Experience\"", which stayed on the charts for almost two years.  Bare Naked Ladies \""Gordon\"" featured the cult classic \""If I Had a Million Dollars.\""  You either listened to albums on cassette or CD and you bought them at record stores like National Record Mart.  Doug Hopkins (Gin Blossoms), Kurt Cobain (Nirvana), Shannon Hoon (Bline Melon) and Jerry Garcia (Grateful Dead) were all alive.\n\nTECHNOLOGY:  Few people had internet access.  You also used pay phones because you didn't have a cell phone.  You watched movies on a VCR.  You met up with your friends without texting them.  You ordered merchandise by \""sending in\"" or by calling an \""800\"" number.  You had to buy tickets by waiting in line.  \n\nAnd OJ Simpson was still a football hero.\n\nSo that's it, Pittsburgh Pirates.  I feel like telling you I'm done with you guys.  I'm no fair weather fan, but 20+ years of losing is enough.",1

The tour guides -- free tours Sat through Thu at 1, 2, and 3pm -- are extremely knowledgeable and open to any and all questions.\n\nWe were just blown away by the rich history and beauty of the place plunked down in the middle of a rather ordinary corner of the North Side.\n\nIf you have guests in town looking for something out of the ordinary or if you've never been, it's well worth the schlep.",4
1293,My wife and I have visited St. Anthony's Chapel three time so far and every time the experience is a moving one.  I would recommend the guided tour.  The amount of relics contained in the chapel is amazing.  If you a person of faith this is a wonderful place.,5
1294,"I was raised Catholic (but no longer practice), and have always been fascinated by relics and the stories of saints--so I was really looking forward to our tour of St Anthony's. BEWARE: I can't speak for their other guides, but the gentleman (a lay person, not a priest) who \""led\"" ours was far more interested in haranguing the crowd on the nature of TRUE believers, the infallibility of the Catholic faith, and whether we'd all found our \""charisms\"" - the gifts we needed to be using if we were going to be saints, too--than showing us any relics. After an hour of his sermon--and nary a single fact about the hundreds of relics that surrounded us--we left. What a disappointment. What a huckster.",1
1295,"I wouldn't pay attention to the Trib's news coverage, since it's mostly far-right propaganda. Two stars for their decent sports coverage - Mike Prisuta and Joe Starkey are worth reading.",2
1296,"So, this is what happened.\n\nI went their complaining about a possible over heating and requesting a change of oil. This was my first visit there. They topped off my coolant for free and changed my oil. I had a check engine light on for which I knew the code and was holding off on repairing it. \n\nThey charged me $20 for reading the check engine light code and turning it off. I didn't want that. I pointed this out on the bill and he said that, its fine, I can just pay for the oil change (~$42). He asked me if I had $42 cash on me. If I did, I could have paid and left a happy customer. But I didn't, so I gave him my card and he went in the back and swiped it for the full price ($42 + $20 + tax). When I was signing the transaction receipt, I told him that he swiped for the full price. This apparently pissed him off a lot, he very rudely handed $20 from his pocket and asked me to \""Get out of there\"" - and walked out. I tried to talk to him and explain my reason of asking - it not being the matter of $20 but of the principle that he said he wasn't going to charge me for what I didn't want. But he wouldn't listen, was very rude and said \""You're Done\"" and \""Get out\"" more times. I left. \n\nI ain't going back where they treat customers like that.",1
1297,"Although I've never had any of their other menu items except their gyro, I wish I would have gone elsewhere. Since I can only comment on their gyro; here goes... First, the meat is embroiled with fatty particles (it's fake meat or something), second; they don't include enough dressing, third; there are way, way too many onions, forth; there were only two very small slices of tomatoe, fifth; the feta cheese is not crumbled but in a patty, sixth; they just pile the stuff on top of a pita, - to be quite honest, it just tastes bad.",2
1298,"This is a gem in Pittsburgh.  The owner, Tom, and the workers will remember your name.  Its just like being in a small town.  Fresh meat and friendly people.  The meat is the best I have found in the city and is affordable too.  The best steaks I have ever eaten have been purchased from there and cooked in my own kitchen!  They are also very knowledgeable.  They can answer any question you have about what cut of meat to choose or how to cook something.  They're also more than happy to share tried and true recipes, which have always worked out for me.",5
1299,"\""grossest hostess\""\nOkay, so you know when you go into  place and it's close to closing time?  You aren't sure whether the staff will be cordial and inviting or straight up rude.  Well my wife and I went into Millers at 9:15 pm for dinner.  The hostess was incredibly rude directly off of the bat.  she said \""ughhhh you know it's close to closing time, right\""?  my wife said, \""what time do you close\""?  The older, short blond curly haired hostess with glasses said \""we close at ten\"".  TEN???  TEN????  They weren't closing for 45 minutes!!!!  This was the second time she did this to us and it will be the last because they have lost our business for good.  We even heard a phone ring at quarter to ten and she didn't even answer the phone, she just picked it up and snarled \""closed\"" and hung up on the person!  Our server however, was spot on and the food was decent but the hostess or manager or whatever she was left the worst taste in our moths and spoiled Millers Seafood forever.  If you go to Miller's Seafood and you see her at the front, turn and run!",2
1300,"I have eaten here twice. Both times I thought the food was sub-par. The first time was a birthday lunch that was lousy, but I was feeling under the weather, so I gave it another try about a year later for dinner. It was just as lousy as the lunch. My wife definitely agreed, and although we can walk there in 15 minutes, we will never eat there again.",2
1301,"Okay so I tried this place twice before writing a review to give them a fair shot. Unfortunately, the second visit wasn't any better.\n\nI will start with the good. Service is pretty good.\n\nThe place smells of smoke. Why? Because you can smoke in the bar and there is an opening from the bar into the restaurant. This has to be a violation of the no smoking in dining areas in Pittsburgh. Gross. \n\nThe floor (carpeted) is so old that it is sticky and worn down. Walking on it with shoes on disgusted me. The walls have wall paper torn off throughout the place. Please, remodel! At least make me feel like the place is clean. If I feel like it is dirty in the dining hall, I can't imagine it's clean in the kitchen.\n\nNow for the food. I am pretty picky about seafood. It needs to be fresh and cooked correctly. Don't get the Salmon or Tuna Steak. Tuna and Salmon should be easy to get right if you just season and cook it properly. Both tasted very fishy to me. Salmon that tastes overly fishy, to me, screams \""this fish is not fresh\"". Mashed potatoes are not made from real potatoes. Don't get them unless you are looking to eat boxed potatoes. I get it, you wanna have a mom and pop shop. But to do that you need to have great food.\n\nOverall, I just don't think this place is good, and don't want to go back.",2
1302,"I've been there twice, and they have yet to impress me. The decor is old and dingy at best, the seats are gross, and the carpet looks to be 30 years old and identified to my grandma's. My biggest issue was the food. I just assumed that a sea food restaurant would serve fresh fish, but I was sadly mistaken. Every meal I, or friends, have had here was poorly prepared, greasy, and clearly had been frozen for an extended period of time.\nThe only plus side of the place was that it was dirt cheap, but be prepared to get what you pay for.",2
1303,"I don't really mind dive places because there are times that they have really good food.  The place is dated and could use updating.\n\nThe waitress was good.  I think she knew we weren't all that pleased with our food even though we told her it was good.\n\nThe food....my daughter-in-law had the shrimp scampi.  We are pros at making our own at home, but when it was served, I told her that there are variations to it.  Her first bite she made a sour face.  My son and I then tasted it...understood the face after that.  Way too much lemon juice in it, soaked in oil and not quite sure what the seasoning was, but seemed like pesto.  The pasta was overcooked and the shrimp just sort of were there. \n\nMy son and I had the fried seafood platter.  Aside from overcooked breading and soaked in grease, the oysters were raw, and the battered fish had no flavor.  The breaded shrimp tasted weird too.  Needless to say, none of us finished our food. Underneath the food, the plate had a puddle of grease. \n\nOn the upside, the coleslaw, bread, and crab cake was good.  The make and cheese was edible, but seemed to comparable to Stauffer's.\n\nThis was our first, and more than likely, our last, visit.  For a $65 dollar meal, it wasn't worth $10. .",2
1304,"I've been going to Miller's since I was just a little tyke.  Unfortunately, over the years, this joint has gone downhill.  \n\nI think I really began to notice it when they put a big tv in the dining area.  Now you can imagine that you're home in front of your own tv while you dine.  Holy Hell.  It's a mess.  \n\nThe food isn't nearly as good as it once was.  The pierogi special is good if it's on the menu - they are Pierogi Plus pierogies.  The bread is Bread Work's bread, so that's good.  My favorite thing on the menu used to be the devonshire, but only the brave try it these days.  In the grand scheme of life, this place is a fine local blue collar restaurant, but compared to the days of old the food is just blah.\n\nps. The ladies who wait here are always and have always been the nicest of folk.",3
1305,"I worked at millers back in the nineties. The fish was fresh every day from wholeys, the bread was fresh everyday from mancini's, and the perogies were made by little old babushka women at St. George's down the street. \nIt was a great place to eat. People cared about the food and it showed. I can only attribute it's decline to a change in ownership. \nI stopped in to satisfy a craving for fish and was very disappointed by the grease pile I got instead. \nI used to be proud to cook there. Now I wouldn't put it on a resume for fear that people have experienced it lately.",2
1306,"Ordered a lg pizza for pick up, 30-40 min wait. Went to pick up my pizza and I arrived to have no pizza at all. They told a driver must have taken by accident. The skinny, is it took an hour for a new pizza, and they offered me nothing",1
1307,"Terrible. I lived about 2 blocks away - and with no other options - I still can't bring myself to order from here. Ordered twice in the last 90 days and both times it was terrible. Ended up waiting over an hour each time. First time I got home to find a totally different order; the send time waited over 1.5 hrs for a pizza. Both were crappy, at best. Staff was really rude both times.",1
1308,"We just moved in a couple blocks away and thought we'd try them out. Their prices are great but, seriously, worst customer service I've ever seen. I walked in and the guy had to finish his cell phone game before helping me. I get home and realize we were given the wrong pizza. When I called to see if they had our correct one the guy tells me that's what we ordered. I assured him we didn't, I was there when my girlfriend called the order in. He just said \""sorry man\"" and didn't offer any solutions. So we just picked off the garbage toppings that we didn't order and threw most of it away. It would've taken very little effort to fix it for us. All this after it took them an hour to make the thing. I'd go back if I were desperate but it's seriously amateur hour.",2
1309,"Too much cheese on their pizzas, and the customer service is incredibly poor.  This is nothing new, we have been in Brighton Heights for many years.  My husband LOVES their buffalo chicken pizza, but after his last experience waiting over an hour for pick up, we would only order from Chubby's if every other local pizza joint was closed.",2
1310,"Review #200\n\nI got hooked on this bakery while living in Brighton Heights.  Now, when I drive past, I HAVE to stop.  I think this one is so much better than the sister store in West View.  I don't know why; I just like it better.\n\nThe sweetest ladies run this local bakery, and they always serve with a smile.  It's usually pretty fast too!  And they're CHEAP.  Doughnuts and giant muffins for $.65.  Cookies of all shapes and sizes are delicious and cheap as well.  It makes me so happy.  Some favorites:\n\nAll of the doughnuts:  Raised or cake, cream or jelly, chocolate or vanilla, they're ALL SO GOOD.  I wish I could stop and say no.  But I just can't.  The selection here doesn't go too fast.  I can usually still get one around lunch time, but if you want options, go early.\n\nLemon Poppyseed Muffin:  They run out quick, but they're so yummy!  It usually triumphs over the doughnuts.\n\nThumbprint cookies:  Maybe I just love the cookie, but I really like them here too!\n\nIs the cliental a little special sometimes?  You bet.  Are the hours old fashioned early to open and early to close?  Yup.  But I just view it as absence makes the heart grow fonder.... :)",4
1311,"My dog means the world to me and I couldn't imagine anyone better to handle her care than Dr. Dorn. I grew up raising puppies as a family hobby and became very attached to quality care from a vet in my hometown. My standards for a vet are high and I was more than pleasantly surprised by WLAH. \n\nMy first experience with Dr. Dorn was no more than 2 weeks after my adoption of my dog. I was pretty certain that she had UTI and it was confirmed. He was such a nice doctor and all of his staff was understandable and sweet. It also felt like a family environment and the office building is adorable. I didn't feel like I was taking my dog to some overly commercial MedVet (the worst place you can go) or chain. The whole appointment, plus medicine, plus taking out her stitches (for free) was $45. I was in shock! It was very reasonable.\n\nNo matter where you live in the city, I highly recommend Dr. Dorn!",5
1312,"I'm underwhelmed. Being a Mike & Tonys kind of girl, I was not really expecting a whole lot. But this meal left me feeling totally \""meh\"". I've personally made better tzatziki sauce before. Their gyro meat has some flavor but it's way too salty for me. I give it a 3 purely for the fact that their staff is helpful and super nice. That always makes a difference to me. Still it is not going to be enough to make me want to go back. I'm sticking with my original choice!",3
1313,"This place has THE WORST customer relations I've experienced in Pittsburgh since I moved here two months ago. My boyfriend was about to order a gyro, I was waiting for him at the table outside near the street with a drink and hotdog I had gotten elsewhere, there was absolutely no one else in their establishment. The person behind the counter then told my boyfriend that I was not welcome to sit at their outdoor seating area with him while he enjoyed his gyro. He canceled his order and we sat at the friendly place next door. Not only did Knossos lose my boyfriend's business that day, but they also lost both of us as future customers. What a petty and pathetic place.",1
1314,"Honestly, it's pretty unassuming from the outside. Inside it's a tiny greek diner, albeit some \""Americanized\"" choices on the menu. Hello buffalo chicken gyro!\n\nBut if you are craving for a fixin' of some stuffed cabbage, potato pierogies, or halushki, this is your place. And for dirt cheap too. I think our total bill was like $10. \n\nObviously you'll get the traditional gyro's here as well, with the twist of the buffalo chicken one. Obviously, I'm intrigued. They also sell ice cream, which if I wasn't so full from my meal, I definitely would have indulged in!",4
1315,"Hummus is very good. Not a place you'd want to \""go out\"" for dinner but great for a quick bite to eat. Would go there again.",3
1316,"Very disappointed. Delivery was late, our gyros were cold and fries were soggy. I wont be ordering from here again.",1
1317,"Awful poor excuse for a gyro. Food is always soggy. Meat is pure horsec*ck. Very unfriendly staff, but what do you expect from Greek f@ggots. Will never order from here again, total trash.",1
1318,"It's a used media store chain. Not to much to say about it. I usually shy away from these places because they run the independent stores out of business. I still stand by that but I gotta say that no matter which one of these I walk into, the people working here always know they're stuff and are really cool which makes me want to buy something from them. This one is no exception, I asked the guy if I could see something on the top shelf and the guy practically ran to the back room to get a ladder, now that's service!  I still have to knock some stars off for the low trade in value they give and the fact that their prices on some stuff is pretty steep for used. Still, the employees rock!",3

If you need to feel pretentious while you are out, you can go to Diesel which is a 3 star 'club'\n\nThe apple has dart boards and will order your favorite beer for you if you ask them.  A good crew works the bar, and my buddy lives right by there so I am there too much.\n\nPerhaps pricier than it should be, but again:  It's a bar.

1323,The apple is decent if you live within walking distance but nothing to write home about.  Average draft selection.  Didn't get into bottles but found that the bartender that happened to be working was not overly friendly.  Went for a happy hour and it was dead.  Haven't been to the Apple in years but seems like a good place to meet friends and play darts all night.  Smoker friendly.  I couldn't tell the crowd that frequents it because it was so dead.,3
1324,"Pretty good place to grab a few drink. Extremely expensive for the area however. I also don't understand their happy hour, .50 cents off drafts? That's pretty lame if you ask me considering their happy hour is always dead.",3

1326,"I love this store. They have a little bit of everything, and since they moved to a bigger location, they keep getting new stuff in. Check here for incense, jewelery, herbs, tea, books, minerals, crystals, and just about anything else you could want. They also offer tarot readings. Make sure you say hi to the cat (I think his name is Baloo) while your there!",4
1327,"I have to say, as far \""new age bookstores\"" go, this one is the most impressive shop I have had the privilege to visit thus far. Moonstones is deceptively small looking from the outside, but on the inside there are as many things to see as there are spiritual paths. \n\nAfter years of searching, I found a pendulum! I was so surprised to find the unassuming tiny metal acorn literally jump at me! I had assumed that what I needed would be an ornate crystal pendulum, but \""great things come in small packages\"". After I took it home it took no time to get acquainted with it. \n\nThe store contains many crystals, gems, jewelry, oils, and even jars of dried herbs. There were around 60 different bumper stickers to chooses from. And hard to find matchstick incense. It is exactly what you think, a match you strike that burns as incense. Speaking of which, I was disappointed to not find any \""pick your own\"" incense sticks. My supply is quite depleted, and I need more. I did but a very dainty scarf from the selection of hats and clothing on the top most floor of the labyrinth. \n\nI hope to attend one of the interesting classes that I have seen mentioned. It does appear that the list needs to be updated. \n\nI also LOVE how the shopkeepers don't keep a hawk's eyes on you. Instead they allow you to spend your time browsing the merchandise alone. After all, it is difficult to hear a small voice when an item is calling out to you if you are anxious from unwelcome stares.",4
1328,"For six years now I have been threatening to purchase a salt lamp for my bedside table. The early spring and late summer when I'm using allergy medication like a fish uses water, I thought a little natural relief while I sleep would help alleviate the morning sneezing fits. I got one here for an Amazon price of relatively cheap. I also bought some healing stones and crystals. She also carries some impressive jewelry and stones that can be set in necklaces and brackets. The place is huge, and just when you think you've seen everything, you can walk down a hew hallway and find more things. \n\nGreat little shop that reminds me of a shop in a Stephen King novel called Needful Things. Although that shop was owned by Satan and made his customers do unspeakable things to each other, this is far from that. But you do get the feeling here that we are not alone and there are other realms to our world. Books galore on the occult, spirit worlds, shadow people, how to rid your home of evil spirits and I just wish she wasn't closing the store when I was walking in. She was nice enough to stay open until I purchased my salt lamp. I'll return and get my fill of this place and look around for four or five hours.",3
1329,"I recently had my 21 birthday and booked Entertainment Unlimited to DJ at my party. I had talked to him we worked out types of music and a playlist that would best fit my party and it's theme.

Overall it was a great time and I would be happy to recommend them to anyone.",3
1330,"Great small grocer!\n\nGiant Eagle offers a lot of things, but they don't offer me everything I am looking for when I go shopping.  Kuhn's, on the other hand, offers all of those little idiosyncrasies and nuances that I look for that I cannot find anywhere else.  The biggest thing for me is the fact that they carry Boar's Head brand luncheon meats.  I really don't know how anyone eats any other brand of luncheon meat since they all just taste so stale in comparison.  \n\nI can tell that a higher number of Italian-American folk patronize this store as well.  Why? The pasta selection is awesome.  I despise the typical noodles carried everywhere else; but here I can find the noodles that I have grown to love.  \n\nGetting beyond the reasons above, I do enjoy the store as a whole and the fact that I can find what I am looking for.  I will definitely be returning; I just have to make certain to be careful of the parking situation since this particular store's parking lot layout is prone to jamming.  In this case, it is better to park near PNC and walk.",5
1331,"Kuhn's seems like they pride themselves on being a \""Family\"" themed grocery store.\n\nI've been to Kuhn's quite a few times, since they are located so close to me, and have found their products to be much more expensive than other grocery stores, and I understand that they take pride in what they offer to their customers and buy their produce locally. But, to me, as a cheap ass, I don't care how they get their products, all I really care about is the price. And their prices are too expensive. \n\nThe store itself is very small and cramped, I get confused very easily as to where to find some products.\n\nI do like the friendly atmosphere inside Kuhn's though, all of the employees seem really nice and are eager to please and talk to you, and for that I'll give them three stars. But other than the friendliness, I'm going to Aldi, where stuff is MUCH cheaper..",3
1332,"Thank God for Kuhn's. Seriously, after having to survive on Foodland, the only \""neighborhood\"" grocery store in Mt. Washington, this is a welcome change. I actually was excited to move to Dormont knowing we'd potentially have a better place to grocery shop locally.\n\nKuhn's has absolutely surpassed Foodland. It's clean, has most everything I need and it's at the right price. I'm actually surprised how much variety they offer in such a \""small\"" space. Small being the operative word, considering most Giant Eagle's are ginormous. \n\nI've even discovered new products here, like my delicious Lara Fiber Bars. I'm surprised at the nice gourmet cheese selection, the big deli area and even a counter for fresh seafood. So now I can just run down the block if I need to pick up something quick or do my whole week's shopping here. It's glorious! \n\nThe only thing I wish for is a better parking lot. Since I'm coming off Dwight Ave it's nice to sneak right in. But coming out is another issue. There's only one way traffic around the parking lot. So you're usually stuck waiting behind cars trying to park and pull out. This is very minor though... just an impatient person talking here.\n\nThe main point.. it's WAY cheaper than Giant Eagle! Neighbors rejoice!",4
1333,"So I have to ask myself, why don't I shop here more often? My family and I tend to shop at Giant Eagle, partly because of the large size of their stores and partly because of their GetGo rewards. Kuhn's has somehow become the place we stop when we don't have time to drive to Giant Eagle. \n\nWhich is totally a shame, because whenever I DO stop in here I'm reminded about how nice the place actually is. Today a simple trip for milk turned into a fall-themed decoration shopping spree that went really well (yay super cute owl pillows!) and I ended up picking some breakfast and lunch items as well just because of how cheap they were. I know from past experience that the produce is fresh, and between the wonderful aroma and colorful display the bakery here is absolutely torturous to pass. There's also a ready-made dinner/lunch shelf with sandwiches, chicken wings, pizzas and a few dessert items if you want to grab those on your way out; I've actually gotten dinner here a few times on my way home from the city when I was too tired to cook. What's not to like about affordable and delicious food, right?\n\nHowever, there is at least one thing that does keep me from wanting to be a regular here and giving Kuhn's a 5 star review: the blasted parking lot you have to deal with to go here, which I've cursed in other reviews. This lot is the one that fills up super quickly, creates miniature traffic jams like no one's business, and is a time-stealing trap. Sigh. Suddenly I think I understand why my family always goes to Giant Eagle.\n\nSorry, Kuhn's. Your prices are wonderful, your set-up fantastic, and your options well varied and impressive. But can you blame a girl for hating a poorly constructed parking lot? (Don't worry. You're still great. I'm sure I'll see you again!)",4
1334,"Kuhn's is really the only convenient grocery for where we live and they do have a great selection of higher end lunch meats, etc., but I had a terrible experience with their poultry. It took several minutes to sort through the grey, fatty boneless, skinless chicken breasts and when I finally found a package that didn't appear to have spoiled, I came home to find that the breasts had never been cut into breasts. There were several large pieces with a ton of trimming to be done. Drive the extra distance to Giant Eagle if you need anything from the meat department.",2
1335,I haven't been to Kuhn's in months and forgot how much I prefer it over the other grocery stores in the area.  Once you get past the craziness in the parking lot it's not so bad.  It's smaller than the other grocery stores around but still have ample choices of all your produce/meat/dairy/deli needs fo sho.  Their prices are less expensive than GE too!  If only they had fuel perks...  The service is always fast and friendly.  I'll be doing the rest of my thanksgiving shopping there.  They have some good deals going on right now.  .99lb Honeysuckle turkeys no min purchase!,4
1336,Had a friend who went here. REALLY BAD experience,1

When I ordered the 2nd latte I sat down and realized I didn't have any foam so went back to the counter to ask for some and and she wanted to charge me!? Really!? Maybe it sound petty to you but I like my lattes fixed a certain way and foam is the best part! It's all about customer service and considering I had just spent over $25.00 a little foam wasn't much to ask. Good coffee. Bad customer service.",1

If you live in beechview you already know about this place, but if you don't you need to try this place out if you are passing through.\n\nAt first glance, you will barely notice the bar/restaurant from the exterior.  Inside it is your typical Pittsburgh bar with a some additional seating in the back.  So you would think, why take the time to review this place.  Well they have a old-fashion popcorn machine which they offer free while you are drinking at the bar and this popcorn was phenomenal.  But it only gets better, happy hour pints for 90 cents.  So, delicious popcorn + beer= Great afternoon after work.  Well at this point, I was like wow, this little place well served its purpose for a cheap happy hour on my way home from work. \n\nAnd then: The Reuben.  Now I am not the connoisseur of Reubens but, this one was absolutely flavorful.\n\nAll in All- check this place out if you are in the area and need to grab a cold one.",3
1345,"I like the double cooked wings, but they're like chick wings they're so mini.  The thing that turns me off the most about this place is they have cardboard disposable bowls for their complimentary popcorn - however they get upset if u try and use it to put wing bones or other things in it because they insist on wiping out & reusing the disposable bowls. Disgusting & totally unsanitary IMO. If they insist on reusing those, imagine where they are cutting corners behind closed kitchen doors. I'd go back for bottled beer, that's about it.",2
1346,"... Look... I hate writing a less than stellar review of a business. It actually makes my cold goth baby heart sad. No one WANTS to go somewhere and get bad service, thats just ludicrous. (Not Ludacris, close but not the same.)\n\nI have just recently moved to Beechview and the best part of moving to a new part of this wonderful city is giving new businesses a try! I have sampled so many tasty and amazing new food items and coffee drinks etc etc. I am always in search of a non-smoking bar where I can hang out, eat, drink, and get to know the locals. I prefer small bars with \""yinzers\"" as they tend to be a true gauge of a neighborhood for me. \n\nWe have many friends in this area, which means that we got some great tips before we even moved in about different types of food, stores, laundromats, and bars. One of these tips, repeated from friend to friend, was The Huddle. As the name implies it is a bar where you can be certain you can watch a sports game of whatever sport-ball type you're interested in. It is indeed non-smoking, a handful of tables suitable for 4 people and a \""U\"" shaped bar right in the center as soon as you come in. It is a cash only establishment with an ATM on site for quick transactions. The have free popcorn from a popcorn machine which makes the place smell amazing. It's been around quite a while which means that there is a great group of locals who frequent the establishment. \n\nThis is truly everything I need in a local bar. We had been in for the very first time for drinks shortly after moving in and happened to be in there on one of their two weekly wing nights. This are not the wee tiny wings, more a weird in between of some of the \""full\"" size wings I've had other places that clearly came from giant monster mutant chickens (I mean maybe they were goose wings, who even knows... they were huge) and the teeny tiny wing night wings you find most other places. They have two options; buffalo (sloppy) and \""tanned\"" which are buffalo then cooked again so they are drier and crisp and un-freaking-believeable. The prices are mega cheap and it's so filling and delicious we've been back more than once for them. I like this place so much we have even taken the handsome-boyfriend's mother there when she was in town for the weekend. (P.S. She loved it too!) \n\nMy dear sweet lovely readers, here is where I have to talk about something less than all of the amazing parts I've already mentioned. Tonight, both ravenous from too little food and too much work-day, we trekked up the monster that is Coast Avenue for beers and food and a chill environment (that would undoubtably involve pre-season football). We walk in the door and aside from an employee (other than the bartender) and a few people in the back at tables, we are the only patrons aside from one regular. We belly up to the bar on the far side and say our hellos. This is where I get a serious case of the sad. The bartender working seemed annoyed by our presence. Ok, I get it... I work sort of indirectly with the public I have days where I can't handle people. It happens! As customers come in and sit down, she greets them with a warmth that was clearly lacking. Ok. That's sort of disappointing but still fine. When we got to the point that we asked for a menu three times while she retrieved menus and took orders for the people next to us an hour after we came in... thats where I start to have an issue with the service. Eventually we decided to leave because I was tipping over the line to \""hangry\"" and was afraid I'd lose my temper after the 3rd time we had asked for menus and didn't get them while she continued to warmly greet other patrons and provide them menus and take their orders while refilling our beers seemed to be an annoyance to her to the point of not even asking if we wanted another or the same beer and just taking the glass and starting to fill it (wherein I had to stop her because I hadn't asked her for another one and actually just wanted the tab cashed out).\n\nYes, of course I'll give it another try, I want this to be my local hang out bar. My service in sitting at the table or being served by the woman I presume is the owner has been great. The food is amazing. The prices are great. Don't let me down, The Huddle.",2
1347,Good food. Reasonable pricing. Wings and rings were my fair my most recent stop here\nMy friend had a steak which looked and smelled delicious. She confirmed that it was.,4
1348,Always leaving incredibly happy,5
1349,"Because I am the cheapskatiest of cheapskates, I love Groupon, but I have always been wary of buying Groupons for things like haircuts - they're so personal, and when they go wrong, they can go SO VERY WRONG. \n\nBut, feeling particularly poor and without having established a favorite hair person here in Pittsburgh, I took a chance and bought a Groupon for Sergios.  I even made an appointment with someone totally unknown - no yelp reviews, no word of mouth approval, no bio on the website, no nothing!  That's right y'all I can be spontaneous.   Good thing I only had highlights & a trim planned...and lucky me, it was fantastic.\n\nYou can tell that the space has fairly recently transitioned from down-home barbershop to classy salon (due to a change of ownership from father to son, apparently).  All of the staff seemed uniformly very young and very hip, but still friendly and accommodating.  The music was all 90s and 2000s pop and alternative throwbacks that were such a delight.  And my mystery hairstylist was awesome - Dave not only gave me a really great cut and the most thorough highlighting of my life, but he also charmed my pants off - just a genuine, friendly, interesting fellow.\n\nI highly recommend this little gem - and if you've never been to Dormont, here's your chance! (I hear there's karaoke at the Apple on Tuesdays...)",5
1350,"Sushi Three is located in a strip of shops on Beverly Road, alongside a coffee shop, florist, several banks, and two pizza places.  This and Little Tokyo are, to my knowledge, the only sushi restaurants in Mt. Lebanon.\n\nSushi Three has an extensive menu that seems to have expanded since the last time I visited, and has lots more than just sushi.  There is a long list of appetizers, tempuras and teriyaki dishes, and some Chinese offerings.  The main focus, the sushi, takes up a large portion of the menu, and there are many different rolls, ranging from the basic kappa rolls to the complex southside roll (shrimp, smoked eel, fish flakes, cucumber, spinach, mushrooms, egg and caviar).  As a vegetarian, I appreciate the vegetable sushi platter, which I have never seen anywhere else and only costs $12.  There is even a separate vegetarian menu.\n\nWhile I do appreciate the wide-ranging menu, I just can't like the atmosphere.  It's always very quiet and dark inside, and I always get the feeling of being in a cave.  I prefer to get take-out or delivery.\n\nOverall, I prefer Little Tokyo, but with Sushi Three's improved menu and large number of vegetarian options, my rating may change soon.",3
1351,"I just got lunch from here today.  For $9.63, I got soup, salad, vegetables tempura, 6 avocado rolls, steamed rice, and pickles.  It was a ton of food and more than filling enough - I didn't even eat the salad and I was stuffed.  I will agree that the wasabi was pretty weak - I added tons of it and it added almost no spice or flavor.  Even though it was a bit pricier than I was expecting (my menu was outdated and said the lunch would be $6.95.  Oops.), it was also very filling and worth it for a once-in-a-while treat.",4
1352,Sushi selection limited...  Miso soup tasted a little fishy.,3
1353,sushi was dry and unenjoyable. the place itself is clean and the decor was minimal.  I was not a fan and probably won't be back.,2
1354,"Just moved to the area, so I was looking for a good sushi place. This is a nice little joint.  It's very intimate, but they would have no problem seating a large party.  When my BF and i arrived we were the only ppl there (it was memorial day, so sushi isn't too high up ppls lists for dinner)  \nWe ordered the spicy Edamame and 4 rolls.  Everything was reasonably priced, and very good.  \nStaff was friendly!\n\nWill definitely be back!",4
1355,"This was my second visit and alas, my last. \n\nOur first visit was at lunch and it was just OK. We weren't blown away nor were we impressed. But I will always opt to support a local Mom & Pop shop if all things are equal. This last visit was the pits.\n\nIt was 5:30pm on a Saturday night. We were one of two tables. This is usually an indication of something fishy (excuse the pun.) Appetizer was edamame. It was overcooked and left uneaten. I am not the adventurous sushi order-er; I had California rolls and spicy tuna. The tuna rolls were mostly spicy sauce then fish, very mayonnaise-y and unsatisfying. As for my CA rolls, the avocado was all brown! Not just the parts on the top (because I checked!) all the way through. When I brought it to the staff's attention her response was \""Oh, yea. Avocado is like banana. They get brown very easily and we cut that yesterday.\"" WHAT?!? They did bring me another batch (that was part brown, part green) but it was too late. This was my first sushi restaurant EVER that we left half the rolls on the plate uneaten. Since we were all still hungry, my daughter picked up the table tent listing all the desserts. Yuck! Filthy. Not wiped down in a long while or perhaps ever. When I set it back is when I noticed the wall also needed a good wipe down. Needless to say, we skipped dessert. \n\nOur first visit deserved a 2.5 but this visit was a 1.",1
1356,"I am a huge fan of Sushi Three. They live within walking distance of my home, so it's no problem getting here and the temptation for sushi is always in the back of my mind! Admittedly, the price of the food here tends to keep my cravings in check for a couple months at a time, but when I do come here, I enjoy every bite. Occasionally I also order take-out since they have very reasonable lunch deals, but really, I prefer to sit and eat at the restaurant itself.\n\nSpeaking of: the place itself is very quiet, which I actually like; I can just sit, talk with a friend or read a book, and then (what a radical concept) enjoy my food in peace. This is a big deal for me because the other places I know of where I can get sushi are loud, busy, and quite frankly, a little limiting options-wise compared to Sushi Three's menu. If I want sushi, I either come here or I get a small pack at Giant Eagle. That's how much I hate the other sushi places I've visited in Pittsburgh. If I'm going to pay as much as I do for my fish, I want to be in a place I can sit and actually enjoy my food.\n\nBy the way, Sushi Three does serve things other than sushi, so people looking for some Japanese food that isn't rice and fish are definitely going to find something. There's some really delicious beef, chicken and pork dishes. But of course, a place with the word \""sushi\"" in its name is going to specialize in sushi, and there are pages and pages of sushi options available here. The orders come in various styles and sizes as well, so couples can get something to share or just get something smaller for themselves. The combos all come with soup and salad, which are also very yummy.\n\nI at this point have developed a routine order: a large salad and an order of softshell crab rolls are all I need here. Sure, I'll occasionally snag a bite from someone here with me, but the truth is that Sushi Three makes such enormous orders that I can't eat more than that without feeling a bit sick. \n\nBut hey, at least you get your money's worth! I say definitely give this place a shot if you're a sushi fan.",5
1357,"I go there as a tradition with my best friend when she comes home and it's one of my favorite places. The resteraunt is quiet and low lit so it's very relaxing. Service is quick and friendly. The lunch specials are amazing deals and there's enough variety there that I never get bored with the choices. Their tempura is the best i've ever had, and the rest of their food is just as amazing. Their ginger dressing makes me want to drink it straight. Even thinking about it has set me drooling!",5
1358,"Well, finally tried the place with the Green door and High Step!  Always seem to be people going in and out.  Heard from one of my kids it was just OK, cause he had take out once with some buddies.  Well, we ventured in and ordered a few things so we could share.  General Ts0's chicken was  to be crisp and Ouch spicy...Well, the outer crust was crisp, chicken was hard..hard to chew, tasteless and somewhat sweet sauce???  The Shrimp Lo Mein was Ok but the shrimp was overcooked.  The Moo Shu Pork was forgettable.",2
1359,"Green Garden is not, by any means, the pinnacle of Chinese food. It is, however, a suitable meal for reasonable prices.\n\nThe staff is very friendly and casual. After so many years of eating there, they know my family and it is nice to remembered after having spent so much money there.\n\nOur regular dishes of fried dumplings, chicken and broccoli, etc. are all well done standards of Chinese takeout. It may not be spectacular but it gets the job done.\n\nWhen push comes to shove, Green Garden is an acceptable restaurant with great service. I will always be a regular (save something horrendous happens with one of our meals, but is hasn't happened yet).",3
1360,"Yeah, don't order from here, unless it's for dumplings. since they arev fast and the potstickers are really good. Everything else we had sucked. Shrimp and Scallop with garlic was bland as hell. The Beef on a Stick was liked eating a marinated shoe with a skewer in it. Yuk.",2
1361,"Ordered General Tso's shrimp, Kung Pao chicken, soup and egg rolls. Price was slightly higher and portions maybe slightly smaller than similar stores, but food quality was certainly in line with food of this type.  \n  The only notable ding I would give is the spicing. Both of our dishes are supposed to have a bit of spice flavor, and they are noted on the menu as spicy dishes, but there was a notable absence of spice.  There weren't even chilis in the Kung Pao sauce.  It's like someone forgot to spice the dishses.",3
1362,Cool pool hall.  The front is a small neighborhood bar type of place that has good beer prices and almost everything seemed to be on special the night we were there.  The pool hall in the back was much bigger than I expected it to be.  There were a lot of tables and plenty of room.  If you see the \u20ac20 note hanging up on the wall that was from a friend of mine that donated it during our trip to Pittsburgh.,3
1363,"Since moving to dormont, I've been here few times for darts and drinks. This place is divided into a bar (in the front) and a huge pool hall at the back along with a single dart board (manual) which is the only reason we come here every once in a while. Although you're not allowed to smoke in the pool hall - the hall reeks of cigarette smoke residue. So, do be prepared to take a shower and do the laundry as soon as you get home.\n\nBesides, that - I think it's a pretty cool hang out place if you're into pool. The people here are friendly, the service has been good so far and the prices for the drinks are super reasonable.",3
1364,Pool hall and pretty crappy bar. Not much else to write home about. Was not a fan and won't be back here.,1
1365,"Brought the family to Tom's last weekend, and was disappointed.  On the positive side, the prices were excellent, much better than the canonical breakfast spots in the strip.  However, the food was heavy, greasy, and made from mediocre ingredients.  I didn't care for the spinach  / feta omelet, the kids' pancakes were heavy, and the home fries were greasy.  True, the place felt 50s, but kind of worn out.   We won't go again.",2
1366,The service here was outstanding with a very friendly staff. I could not believe the amount of food we got for $7 per plate. Great food. Great prices. A new Pittsburgh favorite of mine.,4
1367,"I can't comment on how it is for actual meals, but If you want food in the middle of the night, you can't really be picky and they get the job done.  At first I thought the price on the strawberry pancake breakfast meal was high (around $9), but it comes with lots of food (3 big pancakes plus sausage & potatoes).  Nothing special compared to other pancake places, but any stack of warm pancakes late at night is delicious to me.  The waitresses seemed nice and friendly, especially considering it was past 2 AM and they have to deal with all the drunk people coming in.  Overall, I liked it.",4
1368,"I know Tom's is a South Hills staple, but other than the convenience of it being open 24 hours a day, I'm not impressed. Even by greasy spoon standards this isn't great. The wait staff is hit and miss. Some are friendly and attentive (there's an awesome Greek lady there that I love), but just as often drinks sit unrefreshed for an entire meal and I can't get anyone's attention to prepare the check. The food is really bland (hard to make a boring grilled cheese, but they manage it) and priced pretty high for what it is. I've been there five or six times in an effort to find a reliably good menu item, but I've given up. It's just bad.",2
1369,I've given this place enough 2nd chances and have had my last meal at this DIVE.\nFood is mediocre at best and you can't get any service because the \nwait staff is always outside having a cigarette. Very unappetizing to watch\nthem and the cook smoking then come back inside and NOT WASH THEIR\nHANDS. DISGUSTING !!!!!!!!!!!!!,1
1370,"Tom's Diner is a bit retro, a bit hole-in-the-wall and a bit of a good deal!\n\nThe wait staff is super friendly and on top of the service, the decor is retro and the booths are true diner style. \n\nI ordered the breakfast burrito. It was pretty tasty and very filling. The salsa it came with wasn't anything phenomenal, but I'm ok with that.  The peppers and onions were well cooked, the sausage was tasty (it's sausage, not chorizo) and the breakfast potatoes on the side were just ok. They needed a little salt, which I understand and I think some ketchup would've done them well.  \n\nThis wasn't the best burrito I've ever had but it was good and super filling. I ate it around 9 and wasn't hungry until 4pm! Well done!\n\nBreakfast burrito breakdown\nThe food: It was good. It was great, it wasn't bad, it was good.\nThe value: That burrito was just under $6 and it was a monster!\nThe experience: it's nice and quiet in the mornings! I bet it gets really crowded though.\nWould I return?: Hmmm, I don't think I need to.\n3 stars?: It was good!",3
1371,Open 24 hours is the key. Good food at any time. Gyros are their specialty and are very good. Remember it is a diner.  The decor is out dated.,4
1372,"Tom's Diner is one of those places I really, really want to like. You see it when driving down the street and it looks like a cool, retro place that got picked up from the past and dropped in the present next to the chain stores and abandoned buildings lining the rest of the street. If only the experience here matched the charming exterior.\n\nI don't have a problem with the diner food, first of all; it's not great, but hey, for cheap eats, it's not bad. They make a mean French onion soup, I admit. \n\nMy problem is more with the maintenance of the place. The windows are dirty, seats are busted, tables aren't properly cleaned - those things really detract from the experience and make the place look run-down and a bit unwelcoming.\n\nThe biggest offense for me, though? The service. My waitress? It took her three trips to remember I had ordered an additional drink (yes, we reminded her), by which time I was almost done with my meal. Also: this diner does not have ketchup at its tables. This would be okay if the servers remembered to bring it out with all meals. They do not. \n\nSeriously, guys: you operate in Pittsburgh. Ketchup is mandatory.\n\nI may poke in for a quick bite again, but I'll be honest with my final opinion: considering how mediocre my experience was on a slow Saturday night, I suspect some fast food chains could knock Tom's out of the park on a busy day at this diner.",2
1373,"Any place where I can crack up, cut up, let my hair down and be loose is a place I love to be. It's a diner , kinda of self explanatory seeing as to how that's part of the name.  So they have your typical dinner fare, breakfast items, sandwichs CHICKEN TENDERS.  You get it, I don't need to explain a diner to you. \n\n\n Don't judge me I'm usually wasted upon arrival to Tom's Diner it's not a place where I plan on ending up just a place that I manage to get lol.\n\nAnyhow the pancakes are good and the wait staff is down to earth and very tolerant. \nIn my opinion it's not worth a trip across town, but with friends in Dormont it's a sure stop if I'm visiting over that way. \n\nEnjoy!",4
1374,"I love how it's the only restaurant that is open 24 hours near Mt Lebanon\n\nIt's always good food, even after a night out at the bars.",5
1375,"I came in and a waitress came to our table , took our order and then walked away. Another lady came to us and asked what we wanted , then the first girl came back and asked us again!!! The restaurant has 4 people. This is not good! Write it down you dumb blonde",2
1376,The food is ok and I like that they're 24 hours. One of the things that I don't like is that you sit yourself but you don't figure it out until a while. Waitress also take a while to take your order. Other than that is ok.,3
1377,"Read my first review... loved this place... Today I stopped in to look around,my niece was with me and I remembered that they had help wanted postings somewhere.. she inquired and the teenage girl behind the counter was SO rude, full on glaring and rolling of the eyes!

This was supposed to be a surprise at the party but it was on the receipt. How terrible! They knew when we placed the order that this was supposed to be a secret. When confronted with their error they were dismissive, condescending, and there was no effort to compensate her for her pain in finding out the gender at the bakery.

Not once did I see someone clean tables or remove the number tags from the table.  We had to clean our own table.  The floor was littered with straw wrappers and napkins, especially under our table.  The bathroom was in shambles and my friend mentioned that the ladies room was out of tp.  \n\nTherefore--three stars, with the pizza saving the review from total damnation.",3
1385,"Any pittsburgher knows the top 3 pizza joints: Beto's, Fiori's, and Vesuvio's. Beto's is my favourite. \n\nI was never a fan of square pizza until I was introduced to this place.

1386,"Being from Chicago, I'm a pizza snob.  Yeah, I know, it's like comparing apples to oranges, but still...this is my review for Beto's.  Anywhoo--this was a unique experience...the pizza comes out of the oven with just sauce, then mozzerella is piled on for a semi-melt addition.  Who would have thought of this!? \n\nThe pizza itself was good, and the sauce decent, but the whole semi-melt, I'll have to get used to.  :-)  I'd be back for a second shot at it!",3

It is square cut and the cheese is put on after the crust and sauce are cooked. MONEY!\n\nIf you are taking it out get the cheese on the side, we even get 'extra cheese' a lot of the time.\n\nToppings: most toppings on the pizza are put on after it is cooked also. I usually go straight cheese ( not a fan of cold pep or mushrooms) \n\nThe sause is old school nothing fancy but darn good, nice chunks of tomatos in the sauce.  \n\nIf your in town worth the experience, if you live near by...lucky you!",5
1388,"From reading other reviews and dining guides, it looks like this is very much a hit or miss place. Either you love pizza with toppings thrown on after cooking, or you don't. I fall into the later category: I didn't like it at all.\n\nI ordered a slice of cheese pizza and a grilled chicken salad. For the pizza, the crust was salvageable after I pushed aside a good quantity of cheese (most of it). The salad was...nothing short of horrific. Overloaded with fries and (big surprise) more cheese, getting to the lettuce and other toppings took some digging. Eventually, I found bland tomatoes and shredded iceberg lettuce hidden far below.\n\nI don't get this place.",1
1389,"Beto's is one of the childhood memories I'm most fondest of. I remember dear old dad and me getting in the car, driving to Banksville road and getting a few slices. I remember that crusty bottom crust, the simple sauce of just tomatoes, the cool cheese on the top, and gooey cheese closer to the hot crust. This is a unique pizza. You get crunchy, chewy, warm, and cool in each bite. Now if you take it home the cheese will melt,(by the way this is the best cold breakfast pizza you'll ever have!) but if you do like locals do, you'll eat it there and enjoy it the way it's supposed to be eaten. The bread fresh from the oven, cold, full fat mozzarella spread on top. Then when you order a slice or two, some very nice Beto pizza chef with a heavy hand will put at least a quarter pound of cheese on each slice. I must get to Beto's soon and have a slice or two and think back to childhood memories and dad.",4
1390,"Sorry, but our pizza was cold.  All nine cuts of it.  And the garlic wings didn't taste like garlic.  Maybe it was an off night?",2
1391,"There are only so many ways to make the American bastardized version of a pizza, but for some reason there are as many \""pizza shops\"" as there are stars in a clear night sky. As they may be stunning to behold, from afar each one is pretty much the same thing. This shop is another place that tosses sauce and cheese on bread and serves it to their patrons. Ok, so they DO have a slightly different take, throwing the cold shredded cheese onto the pie as soon as the dough is out of the oven. This does not melt the cheese, and I do see how the pizza would be cold after heaping on the cheese.  Some customers may like it, me, not so much. I tried the Italian hoagie.  It was a good size and the meat was flavorful. But that's about it. They put oil on the sandwich, but no other dressing. I expected a nice tangy flavor to compliment the meat but was disappointed. My date ordered a hot sausage hoagie. I didn't sample it, he liked it, but it was way too messy. The bread got soggy and the darn thing fell apart. It looked more like tomato soup with sausage than a sandwich.  The staff did seem pretty nice, even trying to keep a smile while dealing with the stress of a busy crowded restaurant. The dining room is also a bit cramped. There are plenty of booths, but the tables are rather close together and hard to maneuver between. Hungry patrons also are constantly getting up to visit the soda fountain. When they are busy, it is a claustrophobic nightmare.",2
1392,"This is my Man's favorite pizza place.  When he has visited Pittsburgh in the past without me, he sends me picture messages of his slices.  On the plane ride coming into Pittsburgh last week, all he could talk about was Beto's.  So, when we landed we of course drove right over (after being awake all night on a red eye flight) so that I could taste all that is awesome in Beto's pizza slices.  It was very good.  We ordered the simple extra cheese pizza.  For those of you who are like me (from Oregon where I guess NO pizza is good), this pizza was hot crust, sauce, and minimal melted cheese, with fresh cold mozzarella piled HIGH on top.  I have never had a slice of pizza put in front of me with so much cold cheese piled on it before.  I wasn't exactly sure how to eat it, but figured it out, and it was very good, different but good.  I would take Beto's pizza over Oregon pizza any day.",4
1393,"I was out with lesbian friend of Joe D the night before new years eve. Note to self: veggie burgers are not a meal for a man. After seeing Harry Potter 7.1 at the theatre we both proclaimed we were hungry for abnormal pizza. Let me explain, we didn't want to order generic, neighborhood delivery pizza. Pretty much I'm tired of tasteless, no crust pies that lack nuance. Since lesbian friend of Joe D lives in Dormont, Beto's was a natural. She's never had the beto's experience. So I told her to follow my lead, I ordered two slices, one with black olives, the other was plain, small drink. She ordered two slices , extra cheese and pepperoni. I forgot to tell her, nay, I purposely didn't tell her about the cheese because I knew she'd turn her nose up at it because the idea of cheese not melted on a pizza would surely upset the planets and cause disruption in the space/time continuem. But it backfired on me and the one thing I didn't expect was her to order extra cheese. \n\nWe sat down and I explained to her the total stupidity of ordering a large drink in a place that offers free refills. Order a small, it's way cheaper and this really sounds like a scene that could have played out on an episode of Seinfeld.\n\nPizza time! The look on her face was one of shock, like mine when I realized that America was indeed stupid enough to elect George Bust for a second term. The cheese was piled high, and no visible evidence of anything under this massive mass of diary goodness. Like a trooper she picked up a slice and dived in. She liked it!\n\nAfter we downed our slices I told her how sitting here has brought me back to my high school years. The pizza still has that same texture, creamy cool cheese, warm crunchy crust, and wonderful smell. Beto's is still my choice for best pie in the Burgh",5
1394,"This is the kind of pizza where the toppings are added after the crust is cooked. Cheese included. It's a novelty, and for some folks it's their favorite pizza. The taste is good, if a little weird, but for me, it didn't satisfy my pizza craving.\n\nThis location was crowded and the wait was long, but the people were nice.",2
1395,"Blah blah blah, cold toppings, piled high cheese, yinzer childhoods, etc. Beto's gets three stars because it is inconsistent - and they themselves admit it. I've had pizza from here that is outright bad, I've also had pizza here which nudged against my all time top pizzas list. Usually there will be a cycle for me where I will have a really good slice, and convince myself I have to go back there - sometimes in the same week. Then I'll have a bad slice and forget about it for months, maybe even years. Then I'll be in the area again and the cycle will continue. \n\nThe cold cheese doesn't bug me because you get so much (portion size here is far beyond ample. $1.25 for each slice - 4 is well beyond my maximum - gets you about a 1/3 of a bag of mozzarella, an extra $.50 will get you as much of whatever topping you feel like having). If you get take-out, it'll pretty much melt by the time you get home if you leave the box shut. \n\nOne thing to note - this is my favorite place to get black olives on a pizza, since they don't go into the oven.",3
1396,"I tried the \""cold cheese and toppings\"" slice that Beto's is famous for.  If you have heard about there style of serving pizza, and are wondering what the punch line is, there isn't one.   They make a big square tomato-sauce pizza and throw cold shredded cheese and other cold toppings on it, and that's it. There's no secret ingredient or special something  that makes it tastes like anything other than what you would get it you grabbed pizza fixings from your kitchen and forgot to bake them.\n  \n I guess a lot of people like it, and more power too them. But I don't get it. Ramblin' Boy didn't get it. I see zero reason to agree with people that say that this is the \""best\"" pizza in the region. \n\n Maybe their hoagies will be better.",2
1397,"I guess for what it is, a thick crust with a canned tomatoes and uncooked mid/low grade cheese, it was fine. It's just not my style of pizza. They do have some of the hottest wings I have every eaten, the very aptly named \""after burners\"". The sauce is very tasty with an INTENSE slow burn.",3
1398,"You have to be goofy to not like this pizza. Their sauce is tangy and delicious, probably the best I ever had, and The crust is perfectly crunchy not doughy and chewy which I cant stand. Truly unique and worth a try. I will be back.",5
1399,Canned green peppers!?! Way too much cheese. The yinzers seem to like it. The average BMI in that place was probably close to 30 and no wonder; the food is incredibly unhealthy. The pizza crust tasted like Pizza Hut. Maybe this place gets good reviews because it's a unique twist on unhealthy; loads of uncooked mozzarella.,2
1400,"Wow, just wow. That was without a doubt the worst \""pizza\"" I've ever had in my life. Maybe you would like it. Do you like all of your toppings out of a can? I didn't even know you could get canned green bell peppers. Do you like your slices of pizza to be covered with a huge several inch thick mound of uncooked mozzarella cheese? If answer is yes, then maybe this place is for you. It is definitely not for me.",2
1401,"I'm a fan of Betos. I like the fact that the cheese isn't always melted. The slices are square and the prices are reasonable. Ranch dressing or bleu cheese and you're good to go! The pizza itself is simple: crust, sauce, and cheese. I'm pretty certain that you have to go pick it up, or that's just been my traditional order of things. It's been a while since I've had their pizza, but it's definitely worth the trip.",3
1402,"This \""pizza\"" was the worst food I have ever eaten.",1
1403,"So you walk in and proceed to the counter.  You order the pizza with whatever toppings you so desire.  You get handed your drink cups and a number to put on your table and try and find a seat.  Maybe a 15 to 20 minute wait for your pizza.  Your pizza comes out and...... \""what the hell is this?  Take this back!  My cheese ain't melted and the pepperoni ain't cooked!\""  Chill my man.....take a few deep breaths....it'll be ok.....just TASTE it......there ya go.....holy cheese right?!  What a blend....It's all over the place and people actually order extra!  That sauce, nice.....sweet and chunky....yummy.  And the crust....the crispy, chewy wonderful foundation that holds it all together.   It's a bit different.  But different in the best way.  There's some great pizza out there.  Different styles and different tastes.  Do yourself a favor.  If you're in the Banksville Rd./ Dormont area stop in this place....it's just delicious.",5
1404,I don't get it. Cold cheese and cold pepperoni on my pizza? Why does Pittsburgh have to be so weird? I just got accustomed to fries and coleslaw on my sandwiches but a guy has to draw the line somewhere. And what's with everyone bagging up their extra cheese and taking it home? \n\nMy gut tells me this would be an awesome pizza if only they'd cook it.,2
1405,"The pizza was fine. My issue is that, if you aren't like other pizza places with your pricing, you should maybe tell me that when I call to order a medium with two toppings. We ended up with a $36 pizza that will take us days to eat, when I THOUGHT I ordered a medium with pepperoni and sausage on half. All young kids working there. No professionalism. No explaination of anything. 50 cents per slice for every topping? Well yeah we got 14 slices, so do the math. NOT a medium. Boxed up horribly, so on our 3 minute ride home, the box was leaking grease out of the corner. I was so upset over spending nearly $40 on something that I thought would be cheap and easy, I couldn't even enjoy the pizza. Its just whatever pizza anyway. \n\nSave your money and go to Slice on Broadway. 1/3 of the price,  staff is wonderful,  and they have a liquor license and fair prices. Slice should get half the publicity this place gets. \n\nNever mind that I've lived in Pittsburgh all my life and have never heard of Betos until I moved 3 streets behind it. NOT a \""Pittsburgh institution.\""",2
1406,Worse than store freezer pizza. What with the cold cheese on top of hot pizza? Terrible. If you want quality; Fiori's is a few miles away.,1
1407,"First off, had my boyfriend not told me that every topping on the pizza was cold (including the cheese!), I would have never known. They should really have an illuminated sign that advises the customers.\n\n I'm sure you have gathered that this pizza is kind of presented exactly like frozen pizza from the store except the bread is cooked. I think the appeal to this place is that it is different - Some people go to restaurants where you can cook your own food because it's different but the fact of the matter is that when I go out to eat, I don't expect to cook it myself and I don't expect it to come half cooked. \n\nHad this pizza been cooked, I feel like it would be subpar. The crust was very crispy and the sauce was a standard tomato (no extra hints of basil or pepper). The peperoni reminded me of the peperoni that comes in Lunchables - actually the whole pizza reminded me of a Lunchable (except a pie made of 28 cuts is $35.28 with $.50 per topping a CUT!) To be fair, each cut is $1.30 and you only need 3-4 to really, really be full.  They really lay on the toppings - about an inch of cheese, 20 slices of peperoni and a handful of banana peppers for just two cuts with toppings\n. \nI feel that you really need to be in the mood for Betos before you go there. When I am in the mood for pizza, I am heading for the flowing, stringy cheese and the flavors melting together before it hits my mouth. I would eat here again if I get the craving - some people in the restaurant had ordered other menu items that looked to be pretty good. I wouldn't take somewhere here as a Pittsburgh Destination though. \nThere is about 10 tables in the restaurant (booths/tables) ... clean/reputable.",2
1408,The thing about Beto's is you either love it or you hate. I personally love it. The uniqueness of the cold toppings on the hot pizza is something that Beto's does perfectly. I've been a loyal customer for 10+ years and have continued to order 3 cuts with extra cheese every time. One of the biggest perks to Beto's is that it's family owned by a great group of people. This place is sure to not disappoint.,4
1409,Didn't live up to my expectations at all.  Waste of time and money.  Sloooooow service.,2
1410,"Thinking cold toppings is going to tast great sounds odd....... But, this is great pizza. \nWhen you commit to doing something as odd as cold toppings you are going to strike out or hit a homer. Betos hit a Grandslam. \nPlease stop in. It's a dive but it's outrageously good!!!",5
1411,The pizza is ok. The tomato chunks are delicious and the pepperoni too. But they don't bake it and the stuff all slides off the crust. Overloaded too much with cheese . Not horrible but certainly not the best.,3
1412,"Okay this place is freaking wild. If your from my generation than you can remember Ellio's rectangular frozen pizza. This place brings me back. Any place that goes there, then you know they're doing something right. \n\nIf you go here you will be in cheese heaven. I agree with the other people's review that you will either love this place or absolutely hate it. I'd have to give it a thumbs up but instead of calling it pizza, call it beto's raw cheese baked bread haha. They cook the bread sauce/tomatoes and then throw a heaping cheese pile after your meal is cooked. Then they throw on any toppings. I call it raw cheese pizza. It is good. Crust is crispy and the sauce is delicious. \n\nEatability I'd give a 2/10. The whole point of pizza is that you can bend it in half and then stuff it in your face. Here it's more of a fork and knife operation. The cheese falls right off because it's not melted so you end up slurping it up like spaghetti. \n\nI dig it though. Good job beto's. Way to stand out from the mediocre pizza that plagues pittsburgh.",5
1413,"My husband and I had this pizza for the first time last night.  He suggested it after hearing recommendations from friends.  This was the most disgusting excuse for a pizza I've ever had! We ordered pizza for pick up.  The girl told my husband 20 minutes and he picked our pizza up in a timely fashion.  The best thing about this pizza was the crust.  That was it! It was cold! It was not even warm like it had been warmed up before my husband picked up our order.  We got two extra toppings, which were just heaped in a pile on the middle of our slices.  These were cold too. And mushrooms from a can!!! Why am I paying extra for disgusting canned vegetables.  The sauce had absolutely no flavor and was completely cold. I would never go to this place ever again.  It was a lazy excuse for a pizza.  Who gives someone a COLD pizza for pick up?!?!?",1
1414,"Nowhere else quite like betos. If you love cheese and like trying something different this place is awesome.  I grew up in Pittsburgh and get back rarely,  but when I do I go out of my way to grab a couple slices!",5
1415,One of my favorite pizza spots in Pittsburgh.  Been coming here for years.  The only downside is if you go and they are just putting a pizza into the oven.  The wait to grab your cuts can be a long wait.  Well worth it because of how damn good it is.,5
1416,"Exactly what you'd imagine from an adorable neighborhood ice cream shop. When it's time to grab a cone, this is where my kid wants to go! Good s'cream too!",4
1417,"Sweet little shop - great place to take the kiddos, and nice to see a huge selection of hand dipped cones and it's a nice departure from the yogurt bars.",4
1418,"With the advent of the Super Bowl just a few days away, the beer distributors are licking their chops at the business coming their way. Of course, this means the end of football season, so sales will drop off. \n\nBanksville Beer has a great business, and awesome location. They carry a good selection of all types of beer. Pittsburgh is suddenly having a love affair with IPA's, something I've been in love with for about 9 years now. Great selection here, including 60 and 90 minute, Victory, Ithaca Flower Power, etc. \n\nGood selections of your swill brews (PBR, less filling, tastes great) and your college frat boy brews, you know what I mean! They also carry snacks.",3
1419,"I've never, EVER experienced such poor customer service before at any beer distributor.  Yes, I called them and asked for a price on ordering a case of import beer.  When they called me back with the price, I decilned purchase.  I was talking at the same time to another distributor who was doing a lot more leg work for me tracking down the supply chain.  When he informed me he could have a case shipped to wherever I bought my beer, I gave him Banksville Beer's name thinking I was giving them some extra business.  I don't normally get my beer from there.  When I stopped into Banksville to pick it up, a person who I assume was the owner got immediately defensive with me, raised his voice saying \""You told me you didn't want it.\""  I tried to explain what had happened, but he continuously interupted me with a constantly rising voice level barely allowing me to get a word in.  He claimed he did not speak to the guy I had spoken to, which was obviously a lie since he referred specifically to \""that person you (meaning me) talked to.\""  I finally had to cut him off and say, \""Listen, do you have the case here or not?\""  He said they did not, so I left.\n\nI can understand his frustration if what I did caused him any loss or inconveneince, but he did not need to take the majorly unprofessional approach that he did.  I honestly had no idea that I did anything wrong, and on the contrary thought I had actually done them a favor.  Had he explained the circumstance, it would have been no harm, no foul and lesson learned.  And I just would have asked them to order me a case straight out and would have returned for more cases to be orderd in the future.  But because of that reaction, I will NEVER step foot in there again under any circumstance.  No beer is worth dealing with a world class A-hole like that.",1
1420,"Banksville Beer is one of those places I very rarely have to shop at; I don't drink a ton of beer and given a choice between cider (which you can get here) and wine (not so much, obviously), wine will usually win. \n\nAs a result, one stop here can keep my cider/beer supply stocked for months. Now, while I've never left the shop empty handed and I LOVE browsing the fantastic and varied beer selection here, I have admittedly had trouble finding specific favorite beverages of mine, such as flavors of Magner or even varieties of Blue Moon. But I think this has more to do with my taste (remember, not the biggest beer person, more of a cider/wine person) than the shop itself - you can always at least find the basic ciders and beers here. And again, I've never left empty handed despite my snobby tastes: usually I leave with a whole case of Woodchuck, and most recently a whole case of Fall Woodchuck. Yum! Also, the men behind the desk are usually pretty good about asking if you need a hand taking things to your car. (Usually.)\n\nStill, the parking situation here keeps me from giving the place 4 stars. Getting into the lot here can be a little frightening as you hope the person behind you is paying attention and slowing down while you turn into the lot. The lot itself is pretty tiny so problems can arise if too many people stop in for beer at once. Finally, getting out is even more terrifying than pulling in, because no one slows down on Banksville, ever, to let you out. Be prepared to sit for a few minutes if traffic is heavy.\n\nHappy shopping, beer lovers!",3
1421,Mediocre and poorly made! You can get better quality food from Mcdonalds don't waste your time or money,1
1422,"Eh, been here a few times since moving to Dormont. It's just okay. I've been to many Eat n' Park restaurants around Pittsburgh and this one is nothing special.\n\nA royal pain to park at, and the food is just mediocre. People are nice though and have no complaints about the service. I would come here after hitting up the bars or for dessert one night, but that's about it. Banksville location is much better in my opinion.",3
1423,"I would give this eat n park location zero stars if I could. I arrived at 11:15am and was seated quickly but that was about it. My waitress did not come over until 11:41. I did not receive water or any service for 26 minutes.  That is outrageous to me, I've never had anything good to say about this location and will not be visiting again.",1
1424,"My experience here was not good my family and I were seated all the way in the back of the Resturant near an exit after passing at least six tables upfront. We were the ONLY African Americans in the restaurants not even one as a busboy we had some stares but no one was rude just very quiet . The waitress tried to make us feel welcome so we thank her for that but the feeling was uneasy and on top of all that, the food wasn't good it lacked lots of flavor \nI wouldn't recommend this spot to anyone keep driving",1

We were in the market for a nice crystal chandelier for our kitchen and had more than enough choices to pick from. We have had a hard time before yesterday finding a nice enough crystal chandelier in town (or getting good customer service from other stores). Also, had the problem of not being able to see merchandise at other places. NOT the case at Lighting by Erik! We worked with one of the owner's and she was a complete joy to work with, and full of passion for her job (a rare find these days)! She took her time, was thorough and made sure we loved what we were buying. Also, very impressed with their selection of fan options. They also have many catalogs with high quality and unique ceiling fans, which was a huge perk for us, wanting something more unique. I highly recommend this store to anyone who has great taste! They also have a fantastic selection of lamps, mirrors, tables and other home decor items. Will absolutely be purchasing from them again. Check it out, you will be impressed.",5
1427,"This store will not let you photograph their lighting fixtures. We browsed for a while and found a chandelier we liked, and my husband took a picture of it on his cell phone. The salesclerk told us that was not allowed. We were dumbfounded. We are renovating a house and need a number of light fixtures, plumbing fixtures, etc.-- the only way we can keep track of them all (and check if they actually might look good together) is to photograph everything we're seriously considering. We tried to explain this and the clerk said nope, not allowed. We asked why. She said, \""I don't know-- they just don't allow it.\"" Well I bet I know-- they don't want you going online in search of better pricing. But hey, NEWSFLASH-- that's how things work in 2012. I'm not going to drop $1,200 on a chandelier without looking it up online. (For the record, I understand that local businesses aren't usually going to have the lowest price available. I don't mind paying a bit of a premium to support a small business in Pittsburgh that gave me great in-person service. But like hell am I going to spend that kind of money without making sure I'm not getting completely ripped off.)\n\nWe tried to press further, though-- what about matching finishes or colors to other fixtures? The salesclerk said, \""Oh, people just tell us what colors they have in their room and how big the room is and we tell them what works.\"" I'm sorry, but unless you're omniscient, this is not acceptable. \n\nThe most insulting thing, though, is the clerk telling us \""I don't know\"" about a policy that's so clearly the exception to the local norm. If you're going to have a ridiculous, anachronistic rule, at least have the guts to explain why to customers when they ask.",1

1431,"Almost but not quite perfect. Cain's is a well-priced smoke free 1/2 bar 1/2 sports restaurant hybrid. The front has tall tables and chairs (like bar stool height) and the back has booths and 6 flatscreen TV's. The whole place was redone in 2009 when a new owner bought it, who bought Redbeards in Mt. Washington and totally redid it. The chef is from Grand View, a fantastic actual restaurant, not bar restaurant. So you're basically getting, at normal bar food prices, truly excellent bar food. Seems like the truly scuzzy clientele that someone 3 years ago mentioned have been evaporated to cheaper Dormont bars. The patrons here are more of the youngish (under 40) Mt. Lebanon variety.\n\nThe vegetable wrap is phenomenal, the burgers are great, and the \""Codfather\"" gigantic fish sandwich is simply amazing, the best outside of Wholey's. The \""Codfather\"" is prepared 3 ways - \""Part 1\"" is tartar, lettuce tomato, \""Part 2\"" is coleslaw, fries and hot sauce and I forget what \""Part 3\"" is. The onion rings are beer battered (not breaded) and fried to perfection. They taste moderately of beer, the true hallmark of excellent rings. The food you're getting here isn't pushing any envelopes but it absolutely is the best bar food in Pittsburgh. Apparently they have a $5 \""express lunch\"" that includes a 1/2 sandwich and soup or salad. Never had it but that's extremely cheap.\n\nBeer is fairly priced; Sam Adams and Blue Moon are $3.50 while Yuengling, Coors & Miller are about $2.50, $2 on special. Everything else is under $5.50.\n\nWing night Wednesdays the good: 25 cent wing night. Best wings I've had in the 'burgh. Wing night the bad: they charge 50 cents per ranch or blue cheese dressing, effectively making 10 wings (the minimum order, which they DON'T disclose) $3 rather than $2.50 which makes it more like 30 cent wing night. Nor do they include celery/carrots, as they do on the menu for regular wing orders. This is the first Wednesday (wing night) they've done this upcharge. I don't mind 30 cent wings, I just like honesty up front. They also don't let you take the wings home that you don't finish. Sorry, but I want two flavors and don't want to weigh 300 pounds so I'm only gonna eat 12-14 wings. We threw away at least a dozen between the 2 of us. People go hungry in this city every night and that's a crime.\n\nThe mild buffalo wings are more like medium buffalo wings and are excellent, as are the orange ginger wings. The bbq and honey bbq are what you'd expect. The jalapeno cheddar is fake nacho cheese and pickled jalapenos on top - NOT what we expected and not what we'd get again but still very good.\n\nService is good 4/5 times. It's slower with wing night; only 2 servers for the whole place.\n\nDefinitely go here for the Codfather and the veggie wrap. Get onion rings as your side. Oh! And get a salad too; they use spring mix and baby spinach and make almost all of their dressings.",4

1433,"I think this placed has been re-modeled or at least that is what my buddy thought. I had never been there before so I had nothing to compare it to.

They have at least 4 or 5 TV's to watch whatever local sports are on. I think my friend will be going back more now that it has been updated and I will only be back on my next trip to Pittsburgh. Parking is street, the service was good, and it seems like a nice local place to hang out for a few cocktails.",3
1434,"I've been to Cain's quite a few times, since I live right down the street.\n\n\nThe best times I have had at Cain's consist of myself going into the establishment with the predetermined mentality of spending way too much for drinks ( $7.00 for a Jameson and Ginger!!??) and already being three sheets to the wind. \n\nDon't get me wrong, if you like going to a place that mildly reminds me more of a mosh pit at times than an actual drinking establishment, you would love Cain's. Definitely, avoid going on the weekends.\n\nBut, I will admit that Cain's is an awesome place to post up at the bar, drink a few beers, and catch a Pen's game on one of their million TV's. \n\nBottom line : This place is not a place where you and your buds can go and get poopy drunk at. Cains is, at best, a bar where you stop during a bar crawl for a beer and a shot. \n\nNothing more, and nothing less.",2

While there was a bit too much BBQ sauce on the ribs, they were cooked perfectly, fall off the bone good.  \n\nI was in the mood for a good beer of which they have plenty.  While I normally would order an Abita Purple Haze, I was talked into some shandy that was on special.  Thursday specials are micro-brews - which means that we should really go every Thursday.  But I am getting off track.  When the waitress told me that there were two shandies on tap, she offered to give me a taste of the one in which I wasn't familiar.  The beer that came out was big enough that I didn't really need to order a full glass, but it was good enough that I wanted several. \n\nWe decided to split an order of the pepper jack cheese bites which were served with unnecessary ranch dressing.  The bites were awesome - cheesy, not greasy and excellent breading.  I ordered the California Turkey Hoagie with a side spinach salad.  The spinach salad has feta cheese, walnuts, dried cranberries and warm bacon dressing - all in all, a delicious spinach salad with fresh, crunchy spinach.  The hoagie has fresh turkey - that is featured in several sandwiches and meals and always delicious - avocado, pico de gallo, swiss cheese and lettuce.  I would probably trade out the swiss for maybe pepper jack, but other than that - the sandwich is perfect.  \n\nI know that this place is not everyone's cup of tea, but for my husband and I, it's good food, good beer and decent service. \n\nThe one thing that for me stopped me from giving it 5 stars is that it is so freaking loud in there.  Apparently, this is the hangout for people that want to get really drunk and be really loud - even if there is no need for it.  You generally have to kind of yell over to be heard, but if you can get past it, the food is worth it.",4
1437,"This place is another that is undeserving of your hard earned money!! The following is an email that I sent to the owner, it will shed a little light as to why I feel this way...I will also share his response, and what ultimately became of the situation. I know this one is long winded, but you should be forewarned about giving them your money!\n\nI have been to your bar many times, and I have had both good and less than average experiences, but this past Saturday was terrible! My girlfriend and I came to have some dinner around 9 pm. We knew it would be crowded due to the Penguin game, and that wasn't a problem. When we arrived, there were no seats at the bar or tables available anywhere. We decided to have a beer and wait. After the game was over, some tables opened up so we sat in an empty booth in the back and waited. After about 5 minutes, a waitress came over, cleaned our table, and made notice of the fact that we still had drinks. Sadly, this was the last time that she ever came to our table. We placed our closed menus at the end of the table...nothing, we put our empty glasses at the end of the table with the menus...nothing. We sat and waited for more than 15 minutes. All the while we were waiting, another group of four sat the table next to us, they were never given any attention. They got up and left after being completely ignored. I understand that the restaurant was busy, and that service and wait times may be impacted, but the way we were treated (or lack of being treated) was appalling. It was especially annoying to watch the server that initially cleaned our table giggling and carrying on with two other booths that appeared to be friends with her on the other side of the dining room and then when she was done she just casually walked over to another empty table picked up something off of it and went into the kitchen without even taking a look around the dining room. At this point we were disgusted and got up and left, I was annoyed and made mention of how awful the service in the back was to the doorman. The waitresses in the back were terrible and seemed to have no sense of urgency or seem to care about most of the customers, with the exception of the few tables that they were more interested in socializing with. This seems to be a problem, because on some of my past less than stellar experiences, the disappointment was again with the service from the back servers. On those occasions it was the same thing, they seemed to be more interested in being social butterflies than providing any sort of service. You don't need to improve your wait staff, you need to replace some of them, at least the people working the back dining room on this past Saturday, they were completely useless! Will I come back to your restaurant, I'm not sure. The food is good, but I work hard for my money, and I expect to receive more than good food in exchange for it. \n\nSincerely,\n Matt K.\n\nHere is the response that I got\n\nPlease give me a call (412)555-1212 to discuss the matter. I'm sorry & will make every attempt to make sure this doesn't happen again.\nThank you for making me aware of the situation.\nJoey DeMarco \n\nI promptly called him as soon as I got this email. It went to voice mail , so I left a message. That was it, the guy didn't even have the decency to return my phone call. It is amazing that this is how business owners expect to keep people coming through their doors and handing over their hard earned money. Support local businesses, but make sure they are deserving of your money!",1
1438,Draft selections are good...service is lousy...food is sub par. Not in a hurry to return.,3
1439,I wasn't expecting much but they surely over delivered.  I thought it was just another bar.  It had the bar vibe.  I didn't think the food would be this good.  I am impressed that most of the food is made in-house.  I actually don't remember what I got since it was several weeks ago that I went.  All I know was that the food was much better than any bar food I had.  I would come here again.,5
1440,"Good local bar with lots of TVs, good draft selection, and better than average bar food. Definitely a step up from the Saloon.",5
1441,"Cain's Saloon has popped up on my radar repeatedly since it opened - many people have stood by it as a fantastic dinner spot and bar. And while I certainly didn't dislike my experience here overall I can't say I quite get what all the fuss is about.\n\nI came here for dinner and drinks with a friend and upon first entering we were pleased; the staff got us seats and our waitress very patiently helped us navigate their beer and cider options - which took a while, there were just so many! I truly do praise our waitress and the bar staff for taking my companion's final request, which was a little off-menu. No one complained and they whipped up my friend's drink while I went for a Pear Magner cider. \n\nThe particular night that we went was wing night, and while wings did sound wonderful we ultimately went for a plate of loaded fries in addition to our separate meals. It took a while to get them, but we figured it was getting busier since it was the evening and we let that slide. Here was where the meal began to lose some of its shine - while at first the fries were absolutely delicious, the more of them that I ate the less appetizing they tasted. I suspect that while the top layer was composed of perfectly cooked fries, the last layer of fries at the bottom of the plate was just drenched in extra grease and oil that kind of ruined the fries themselves for me. Plus, when ordering my sandwich I had asked for one of three sauce options listed on the menu - but once it arrived I realized after biting into it that my sandwich contained the wrong sauce. I didn't bother complaining at that point because of how busy it was - I didn't want to wait for a replacement meal; the sauce I got wasn't too bad or spicy for me, so the sandwich itself still tasted good, but it was still a bit frustrating. After actually finishing our meal, it took an INCREDIBLY long time for us to spot our waitress and flag her down for our check. We're not sure why she disappeared for so long; it was definitely odd to have our service go from above average to below average.\n\nAnd when we ducked into the bathroom on our way out? Good Lord, was that a tiny room! I almost hit someone with the door because you literally only have a foot or two between the door when it opens and the wall, so if anyone is standing on the other side they're often in the door's way by default. And it was almost impossible to sit in the stalls, they were so tiny. Definitely be careful when entering the bathrooms, folks.\n\nNeedless to say, my experience was pretty mixed - it definitely started out strong but it kind of went downhill throughout the night, although it never hit actual flat-out bad levels. I'd still come back to Cain's if someone wanted to, as their food was certainly enjoyable enough. It's absolutely a decent place with some decent options for food. It just wasn't incredibly impressive to me after all the hype I'd heard.",3
1442,"Our night at Cain started out as 4/5 stars.  This was my first visit and I was blown away by the extensive menu and attentive service.  I ordered the Shrimp and Strawberry salad - not something I would usually order at a bar.  But I was not disappointed! The shrimp were of a decent size and seasoned well. The salad was huge and at $12 was just right.  My guests ordered a variety of items including Buffalo Chicken dip (amazing); Spinach Artichoke Dip (great); and for their entrees - the Grilled Romaine salad topped with Filet; Surf and Turf ($14 - WHAT?); and a Steak and Egg something sandwich. Everyone seemed delighted with their respective meals and the drinks flowed all night long thanks to our wonderful server whose name I cannot recall.  \n\nUnfortunately, as the evening progressed the bouncer began his shift. Sigh.  I'm sorry, but he just wasn't nice. Not that bouncers need to be cuddly, but dang.  We were seated at the table closest to the door, a table which he clearly despises.  He rudely asked us (the two people seated in the outer seats) to move closer into the table when there was really nowhere for us to go; citing that patrons walking in couldn't do so with us sitting there. Lies.  There was plenty of room for anyone to walk anywhere.  He repeatedly got an attitude with one of our guests both vocally and with his body language; going so far as to seat his stool so close to our table that shoulders were touching. Get over yourself, dude.  I'll visit Cains again, but either won't go when there's a bouncer on duty (which is a ridiculous thing to have to do); or request a table away from the door and annoy the hostess. Either way, he's not a great ambassador for what I'm sure is a great place.",3
1443,"Stopped in for breakfast today.\n\nPros: \n-we were seated almost immediately, and it was crowded!  \n-the meals we got were great!\n\nCons:\n-service was super slow. We waited over 10 minutes for a server to take drink orders after we were seated. I had told my wife that we were going to leave if someone didn't come over in 3 minutes more. It wasn't just our server, it seemed like many tables were waiting a long time.",3
1444,Great food and very reasonable prices.   Really enjoy the sandwich and big orders of tasty fries.,4
1445,"This place is just average. The service is subpar at best and the waitresses always seem rushed. However, their wings and wing flavors are good, and they have so many tv's there isn't a bad seat in the house if you're there for a game. Now that the parking lot across the street is gone, good luck looking for a spot. I would go back, but only for the wings and the spicy cheese bites.",2
1446,Great food and atmosphere. Sweet potato waffle fries are the best. Great for Pirate games.,5
1447,Great place to watch a game. Friendly staff went out of their way to get my game on even though the Steelers were on at the same time.,5
1448,"I had heard a lot of different things about Cain's before coming here for the first time around 2pm on a Sunday afternoon. What I heard was true after dining here- food is really good, service leaves a lot to be desired. Two of us were the first to arrive for a party of six. We waited a good 10 minutes at the \""please wait to be seated sign\"". No one even acknowledged us standing there until two other members of our party finally arrived. They were semi busy but cleared out quickly since it was a 4:25 steelers game and several tables there looked like they were heading to the game. Anyways, a server came over about 5 minutes after we were sat. To get our drink order. She was pretty slow getting our drinks out to us. The other two members of our party arrived by then and when she came back she said the kitchen was running 30 minutes behind and we should order appetizers now if we wanted any. Ok so we ordered 6 old bay wings, 12 thai chili wings, and 2 orders of the cheese sticks. The cheese sticks were the best cheese sticks I have ever eaten! They are huge-3 to an order but these are so thick and gooey....and the marinara served with them is a sweeter marinara, it's very good. I didn't try the old bay wings but they were quickly devoured by the rest of the table. The Thai chili wings had a very nice sweeter flavor. And they were large wings too. Very tasty. She came to take our food order prior to our appetizers coming out. They did take awhile but she did warn us they were slow. Entrees came out quickly however. I had ordered the BBQ pulled pork sandwich. It had a horseradish BBQ sauce that sounded really interesting. The server came over halfway through the appetizers and said they ran out of the pulled pork. I was disappointed but I ordered a turkey Rachael with sweet potato waffle fries instead. The sandwich came on marble rye with coleslaw Swiss and thousand island. The fries weren't great and we're kind of soggy. The sandwich though was excellent. Real rotisserie turkey and lots of cold slaw which is how I like it. A steak and egg hoagie was ordered with chips-she said it was really good and it was huge portion wise. Another ordered the pastrami sandwich and another ordered the pastrami salmon blt. Both were said to be tasty. The quesadilla burger and the bacon and blue cheese burger were also ordered and were quickly eaten and said to be delicious . 4 of us took home half of our sandwiches - portions are huge! Our server didn't check on us and it was us who had to flag he down for drinks. This is a great place to watch a game, lots of beers on tap, good food. Service needs to improve but I wll still come back again because the actual meal was tasty and priced right",3
1449,Ok.  This used to be our favorite spot in the area but the past two times we have been here were not the best.   Today's meal was cold burnt and  rubbery.  We had fish and chips.  Burnt mushy fish and cold over cooked chips.  Loaded potato soup was so thick you could use it for paste.  The app we had was the best part of the meal.   \n\nThe last time we wets here my fianc\u00e9 got food poisoning from a burger special.   \n\nI'm beginning to think we need to go elsewhere from now on.,3
1450,The wings here are fantastic and the cheese sticks are absurd in a very good way. Will definitely be back.,5
1451,"I love this place. Normally, it would have been 4.5 stars, but since they moved to a smoke free environment, it gets a 5 star rating. The staff is quick, friendly and very \""with it.\"" This is a true family business and the food is fantastic. I love the jumbot! It's amazing and hearty. The coffee isn't the best, but the food makes up for it. The french toast and pancakes are lovely too. This is not the place to go if you are dieting as they are GENEROUS with the butter. I like this place way better than Pamelas, which, apart from the strawberry crepes, doesn't really do it for me. It was recently on the Food Network too so I'm not the only one that feels that way!",5
1452,"I assume lots of folks have seen this place featured on Food Network's Diners, Drive-ins, Dives. This place is exactly as it is on the show, really tasty breakfast foods all made from scratch. Great family atmosphere with friendly staff.\n\nI had the apple cinnamon hotcakes and the cheese steak hoagie sandwich. \n\nThe hotcakes were just awesome. They came as a stack of three hotcakes with a lump of butter and a squeeze bottle of syrup.\n\nThe hoagie was just average, kind of small with lettuce tomato, green pepper seasoned with salad dressing and mayo. Kind of weird.\n\nCoffee wasn't very tasty either, or rather seemed to be on the mild side.\n\nNote their hours are 6a - 3p. Metered street parking and a metered public lot down the block.",4
1453,"Went this this morning and I am wondering why the hell it tool me so long to go here. Awesome food, fresh and the staff was even better. Won't eat anywhere else for breakfast in the burg! Gotta get here",5
1454,"This is what a diner should be.  Yummy, fresh(ish) food with staple american bites like burgers and meatloaf sandwiches.  Cramped, with experienced servers that leave the check on the table with the food.\n\nMy soup was the meal's highlight- obviously made from scratch in the kitchen.  Reuben burger- pretty good.  Side of fries- okay.  came from the freezer, but were served hot.\n\nI would dine again.  if i am ever awake during their hours of operation.",4
1455,"Oh man, this place is awesome! You get to choose what type of pancakes you want, so I chose banana chocolate chip and they were delicious and huge. You get three pancakes and I had to take two home to finish later. My friend got the stuffed French toast with bacon and again, delicious.\n\nThe food came fast but the waitress wasn't all that attentive. She was pleasant enough but we received no coffee or water refills. That's pretty much the only complaint. If you're in the area, definitely stop and check this out.",4
1456,Been here twice. Hate to say it but nothing special. The usual breakfast items but nothing stands out either in preparation or presentation.,2
1457,My breakfast was absolutely phenomenal. I specifically ordered the ham and eggs because it included their famous potato pancakes. They did not disappoint I tried every trick in the book to get what they put in them but no luck. I even promised some things I should be ashamed of LOL I would definitely recommend that if you are anywhere within 50 miles you need to make a trip here!,5
1458,"I had no idea that this restaurant was \""legendary\"" when I decided to eat there this morning with my family.  I was severely hungover and just needed some grease, and the concierge at my mother's hotel happened to recommend this place.\n\nThe restaurant is \""cozy\"" (read: small) and situated in a really quaint neighborhood at the top of a massive (and somewhat scary) hill. The restaurant itself was buzzing and had a great neighborhood vibe. Despite it being *packed,* we were seated right away.\n\nThe menu wasn't too fussy but there were a lot of options. I ordered the dor-stop burger (burger with sauteed onions and green peppers, american cheese and two slices of texas toast) and fries. My husband got the mushroom swiss burger with onion rings and we split our meals. The food was simple enough but amazingly delicious. I think they battered the onion rings in crack. I also ordered an orange juice, which I could tell was fresh squeezed.\n\nThe portion sizes were reasonable too! Not gigantic, which I appreciate. I finished my meal feeling like a brand new woman. \n\nI think I'll look for reasons to come to Pittsburgh now that I know this restaurant exists. Yum.",5
1459,"Met some friends for breakfast.  We had 5 and there were no tables available on our arrival.  The hostess said we can have the table for 4 with someone seating in the window box, just don't lean on the window... We said okey-dokey!  Waitress was quick and had coffee right away. She was fast with refills and any waitress that went by with the pot would check to see if we needed refills.  Had an omelet that is very large with veggies.  It was cooked perfectly and the veggies must have been put on the pan first to make sure they were warn and tender.  Potatoes were OK, but nothing special. \n\nThe table was crowded for five, and just when the food was placed on our table, one friend who said he could not make it showed up...Now a table for six.. Not really, but the waitress did not blink and took that order quickly and that food arrived fast... Must have worked with the kitchen to get the order fast.  Thank you!  \n\nWas able to get a taste of the french toast and it was very good.  Someone in our group had the eggs benedict and said they were really good!\n\nWhen your done, cross the street and go to Potomac Bakery and take some sweets home, you'll be glad you did.",3
1460,"This is the second review of The Dor- Stop, I gave it another star this time.\n\nCanadian Friend of Joe (CFoJ) was getting ready to catch the 4:45 flight to Philly, and wanted to share one more meal before leaving the Burgh. He was hungry for breakfast, after all it was only noon and he was still in bed. So he calls me and says meet in Dormont for some serious diner food.\n\nHe's already at a table when I walk in, sitting there eating a huge cinnamon roll, split in half, grilled and looking soooo delicious. So he points to the wall and says \""Guy from Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives was here\"". Spitting pieces of Cinnamon roll at me in his excitement, who knew Canada got the food network?\n\nI ordered the oatmeal pancakes, knowing full well there are eggs in the batter (somethings are just worth having as a vegan) but at least I was smart enough to have the butter on the side so I could discard it later.\n\nHe ordered the raspberry french toast, over hard eggs (Canadian for broken yokes) and bacon, a large OJ, coffee, and the cinnamon bun he was noshing when i entered. The man can eat, and he's so thin, I really hate him and his metabolism.\n\nMy oatmeal cakes were HUGE, and three to an order, I got the first one down without any problem, they were moist, chewy, flavorful with real oatmeal and cinnamon, and the syrup was almost not needed as they have a natural sweetness to them.\n\nHe devoured his french toast, eggs, bacon, saying it was one of the best breakfasts places he's ever been to.\n\nIt's a shame we take restaurants for granted, here's a guy from Vancouver, over 3000 miles away wishing the Dor-Stop was in his home town.",4
1461,"Like many others before me I came to the Dor-Stop with high expectations and let me tell you, my expectations were exceeded.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been looking for a new breakfast spot for a while and the Dor-Stop has always been high on my list to try.\n\nThe place is classic, still has a bar counter, kitschy items adorn the walls and the a feeling that you are dining in your grandmother's restaurant. The place is always packed but we were quickly seated and like many have stated before my coffee cup never fell below 3/4 full before it was refilled.\n\nNow lets get to the nitty gritty: the food.\n\nI got the pancake breakfast, usually a very simple and easy breakfast but when the breakfast came I was so impressed. The hotcakes are so different, some would even say magical. They are so fluffy and moist and complimented their super crispy bacon. I almost wanted to fold the entire breakfast up and eat a giant pancake eggarito. My mouth is watering thinking about it.\n\nMy girlfriend got the breakfast sandwich which was very well done. Their ham is so succulent and tender. They cut it off the bone at the Dor-Stop and is shows. The sandwich is a work of art and is the classiest breakfast sandwich I have ever seen. \n\nI recommend this place to anyone and will definitely come back to try some other types of pancakes. They are the best in the city.\n\nOh and try the potato pancakes, they will rock your world.",5
1462,"The Dor-Stop was crowded and we did have to wait for about 10 minutes.  Not to bad on a Sunday morning.  Waitress was quick to get coffee to us.  It did take a little longer than you would expect to get the meal...we all started to get really hungry.  \n\nOrdered the Eggs Benedict, which were pretty ordinary.  Comes with the ordinary home fries.",3
1463,"We've been here several times, and the food is always good. Nothing spectacular, or amazing, but always filling and tasty. Typical breakfast fare. I love anything benedict, but as a veggie, hate havint to pay for the ham, and order it w/o ham. So a waitress here taught me a little money saving trick, which I will always be grateful. Order texas toast, two eggs over easy and a side of hollandaise sauce. Then build your own eggs benedict. Saves a vegetarian about $2 on a main which is great!\n    I would give it four stars if it weren't for the insane busy-ness of this place. It would be really great if they could expand. They also could really use chairs and benches outside for people who are waiting. I'm sure it's better during the week, but as a 40 hour a week working couple, weekends are the only time we can make it there.",3
1464,"Yelpers, once again you all came through!  Being fairly new to the city, the only real breakfast place I have found is Pamela's.  After reading Yelp this morning my friend and I went to Dor-Stop.  You guys rocked!  We had to wait 20 minutes but walked around the neighborhood (really should do a huge workout before AND after eating here!) then it was time for us to be seated.  The waitress was excellent!  They were packed so it took about 30 minutes to get our food but she kept our glasses of iced tea filled the whole time (and brought out a new glass of ice for each of us to refill).  I ordered the pancakes while my friend ordered a vegetarian omelet.  We ordered one order of potato pancakes to share.  \n\nBoth us really enjoyed our meals a lot!  Thanks again Yelpers, now I have a new favorite breakfast place!",5
1465,"Ahhh Dor-Stop. A nice little brunch spot. I ordered the egg combo this time around. The eggs were average, and the bacon was pretty skimpy, but the pancakes. Ohhhhhhh the pancakes! If it wasn't for these scrumptious staples of breakfast I would never know why it was worth waiting 30 minutes for a table. I ordered the pumpkin pancakes. These this are filling! I could only eat 1 1/2 before being stuffed like the Thanksgiving turkey. Mmmm stuff a turkey with pumpkin pancake .............. anyway. I usually need syrup to add flavor to this sweet treat, but I didn't need any here! I also tried Darren's chocolate chip pancakes. The had so many semisweet chips in them I thought they were stuffed pancakes at first! Soooooo good but even one round cake would make me feel a bit sick from sugar overload. The staff seems able to keep up with the tidal wave of a crowd and get everyone in and out rather quickly. I like that! If you're looking for a place to relax and take your time, this ain't it. if you want some quality pancakes or French toast (poor man's egg sandwich as the Britts call it) and a show watching the cooks do their thang, come here and and be amazed!",4
1466,"Don't go for healthy, go for tasty comfort food. Great pancakes. Expect a long wait on weekends!",5
1467,"Another 5-star find in the Pittsburgh area. I kid you not. Guy Fieri hyped the right place.  It is hands down the best diner in the universe.  Actually, I don't know that for sure, but I dare you to find a better diner anywhere in the United States.\n\nThe food here is made with love and that's what makes it stand out out. You can taste the love in every single bite.  The staff of this family-owned restaurant run like a well-oiled machine, used to the crazy crowds that come here every day to blow their diets and binge.  This was all a girl could ask for on a cheat day.\n\nI had Vicki's Italian Jumbot but with Guy Fieri's twist on it, making it a little more spicy. It was more than enough for Jim and I to share.  We also shared the fantastic pumpkin pancakes. They do not need syrup at all. So fluffy, so delicious and gut-busting.  Why do I have to live in D.C?  I would be here every weekend for brunch.  There is nothing like this place over here..wahhh!   This place is great for sharing so order different dishes and eat them family style. The portions are gigantic and unforgiving! \n\nAnyway, do not come to Dor-Stop thinking they have become over-commercialized because  of their appearance on the Food Network. They have not. They are the same family-owned established where you can get no nonsense  service and absolutely amazing food.  If you are in Pittsburgh, run don't walk to Dormont and grab a seat at Dor-Stop.  This is a glutton's dream come true.",5
1468,"Guy's Jumbot Plate O'Crap - Made a special trip in with my son this morning to enjoy the food at the Dor-Stop.We both made the same order Guy's Jumbot. When the order arrived mine was over cooked , the egg portion resembled the dry pressed paper used in the egg carton. My serving was served without cheese. My son's was fine. When I went to pay and said something I got a vacant stare and I am so sorry. I ended up with a take out for my dog to eat. teh toast was perfect though. I started makeing this hour long trek with family members about a year ago. We would come out about every 4-6 weeks. The last two trips the quality has started to slip a little...but never to this extent that it really mattered.Save yourself the effort ....This is not a Diner, this is not a drive-in...this does not even rank high enough to be a Dive. Denny's would be a better choice.",1
1469,"My in-laws saw the Dor-Stop on DDD and wanted to try it out. When I found out they were famous for their pancakes, I hopped right on board. We went on a Sunday morning and was told the wait would be 20 minutes. After about 10, four seats opened up at the counter so we snagged them. We got to know the staff as we perused the menu. We were right next to the cash register and the (I'm assuming) owner was a gentle drill sergeant doling out orders. \n\nI had the banana chocolate chip pancakes with a side of sausage. The three generously-sized pancakes were sweet with a crispy edge and were loaded with fruit and chocolate. Ohmygod. Some of the best pancakes I've ever had. I stuffed myself silly knowing I wouldn't be able to come back next weekend and do it all again. The sausage patties were really tasty and not greasy at all. I had to fend off T who kept getting samples. :) I also tried T's apple cinnamon pancakes which had dollops of apple pie filling and just the right amount of cinnamon. My father-in-law had the strawberry-stuffed French toast and my mother-in-law had the walnut French toast. I didn't try either but they looked amazing. \n\nI would DEFINITELY come back here if I lived in the area. Pay no mind to the wait time. Bring a book, bring someone you love to chat with. It's worth it!",5
1470,"Another DDD spot to cross off my list. First one in the East Coast!\n\nI was intrigued with their pumpkin pancakes and raspberry stuffed french toast when I watched the segment on DDD. Finally had the opportunity when I visited by brother for his graduation at Carnegie Mellon. The wait time is killer, so be sure to bring something to entertain yourself for the time being. I think we waited for half an hour, but we weren't terribly hungry, so it was fine. Finally sat down and looked at the menu deciding what to order. Both the pumpkin pancakes and raspberry french toast looked so good, but I didn't want to be a pig and eat both of them (well, I could if I wanted to). My mother suggested that we can order both items and split it from there. Brilliant! Get to taste the both worlds. :)\n\nPumpkin pancakes were delish! A bit on the dense side, yet still fluffy. Spices were so fragrant, like it was Thanksgiving! Not terribly sweet, but at the perfect amount where you don't need the syrup. Huge servings; your serotonin levels will rise. :) The raspberry stuffed french toast would probably have to be my favorite. The crusty/crunchy exterior of the french toast slices stole the stage. The whole dish was sweet enough that syrup was also not necessary.\n\nTheir peach cobbler french toast special looked tempting, but sadly they ran out right when we were seated. Sad. :(",4
1471,"This place just plain had it all, simple as that.  I saw the joint on Triple D and knew I wanted to check it out when I was in Pittsburgh for work.  Especially since it is known for breakfast, which is my favorite meal!\n\nThe Dor Stop is especially known for its pancakes, and they have several to chose from.  After some contemplation I decided on the Pumpkin Pancakes.  And what a great decision it was!  They were amazing!  I put syrup on them, because I'm a sugar whore, but they honestly didn't need it!  They were big, moist, and perfectly sweetened all by themselves!  So tasty!  \n\nAnother nice thing about the place is that it's not in Pittsburgh but, rather in the Dormont area outside the 'Burg.  A rather quaint little area it was.  So get down there and check it out!  You won't be disappointed!",5
1472,"While the Dor-Stop is a cute place on a nice tree lined street, I'm not sure what the big fuss is all about. The food was only fair and they don't even have real cream for your coffee. It's that nasty fake nondairy crap. It also gave me the heebeegeebees due to the \""Christianesgue\"" motif.",2
1473,"My husband and I were looking for a new place to try for brunch on Labor Day. Instead of going to our standby, the Original Pancake house, I suggested we try the Dor-Stop. We arrived at 12:30 and were soon joined by the 3rd person in our party. The hostess informed us that we were next on the list for a table and would be seated soon. I was surprised at how busy it was on a holiday. This small little diner was packed with people. Every table was full as well as every seat at the counter. About ten minutes later, a waitress came over and called two parties that arrived after us. My husband had to go talk to her and explain how we were waiting longer. She apologized for skipping us and was able to seat us right away. Once seated, I had a difficult time deciding what to order from the extensive menu. Wow! They have a huge selection. \n\nI finally decided on the special, Apple Harvest French toast with bacon. When I asked the waitress about the special, she had a difficult time describing it but I still wanted to give it a try. Once we ordered, it took well over 15 minutes for our food. I understand that they were very busy but that amount of time did seem a bit excessive for diner food. When my french toast arrived, it was not exactly what I was expecting per the description but, it was very tasty. The french toast had a nice crisp on it and the cream cheese sauce had a lot of flavor. However, for being APPLE harvest french toast, it was certainly lacking apples or apple flavoring. This french toast would have been perfect with slices of cooked apples on top instead of the small apple pieces that were mixed in with the cream cheese. The bacon also lacked a nice crispiness. \n\nI also had the opportunity to try my husband's banana chocolate chip pancakes. Although they looked delicious with the bananas and chocolate chips baked into the pancakes, they tasted rather salty. My husband agreed with my assessment. It seemed like the cook was a little heavy handed when adding salt to the batter. Overall, I wasn't overly impressed though, I would give the Dor Stop a second chance based on their huge selection to choose from.",3
1474,"My dad and I do a yearly trip to a different city to see the NY Mets play.  Yeah I'm a Mets fan and live in California.  Anyway back in May of 2012, we made the trip to Pittsburgh.  \n\nBased on Yelp and local recommendations, we drove out to the Dor-Stop.  In the four days we were in Pittsburgh we ended up going two times for breakfast.  \n\nJust awesome pancakes.   First time, I got the banana pancakes and my dad got the oatmeal raisin.  I love banana pancakes and these were pretty good.  But the oatmeal raisin were fantastic.  Next time both of us got oatmeal pancakes.  I opted for no raisins.  \n\nOn a side note, we frequently hit restaurants covered on DDD but I no longer trust that show based on some of my experiences and the Yelp reviews I've read.   I now will look up the Yelp review and ask locals if the restaurant is featured on DDD before going.",4
1475,Excellent breakfast. Regular pancakes rocked. Staff was super and we were seated immediately on a Saturday. So lucky. My first 5 star rating on Yelp.,5
1476,WOW!  Great staff and great food.  Got in quick and got out quick and cheap.  Did the regular breakfast with 2 pumpkin hot cakes on the side and they were out of this world.\n\nI'm glad they were on YELP or I never would have none of my new favorite breakfast place.\n\nTC,5
1477,Went there with a friend. Had egg Benedict and did not like it. The turkey meat smells funny. And the waitress kept rushing us. Not sure why it's so crowded. Will not visit again.,3
1478,"I've been going to Dor-Stop for years (well before the DDD crowd arrived).  While I'm thrilled to see Bob and Vicky's crew thriving, I do have to say that I miss being able to actually walk-in on a Saturday or Sunday without a line around the block.\n\nIrregardless, when you're looking for unique spins on traditional diner fare, this is your joint.\n\nThe pancakes are all fantastic.  I've had every combination on the menu and then plenty more (they'll usually grant a request if they have the ingredients and they usually run a weekend special).  I highly suggest the apple walnut, banana chocolate chip, the oatmeal raisin, and most importantly...  PUMPKIN (the best in town).\n\nLori's Raspberry French Toast is the obligatory first dine, just stay away from the other iterations that aren't first coated in corn flakes prior to landing on the griddle.\n\nThe jumbots, eggs benedict, and potato pancakes all also represent fantastic choices.  If you have a choice of meat, hands down get the \""ham off the bone\"".\n\nOne other key note...  Bob, Vicky, and their daughter Lori go out of their way to make people happy.  They always bring samples out to those waiting for a seat and offer coffee to hold people over when it's cold out.\n\nIf you're running solo or with one in tow, I recommend you check to see if there are spots at the bar (first come first serve).",5
1479,"Tonya our waitress was perfect! Her recommendations we all excellent! From Chicago attending a funeral. Checked triple-D, and glad I did! Oatmeal Raisin pancakes were unbelievable! I don't where they get their eggs but they were huge and fresh over easy for me! Must stop if ever in Pittsburgh!",5
1480,"AMAZING!  I've been wanting to try this place for years and finally made it.  Ever since I saw it featured on the Food Network I've been wanting to go.\n\nWe went for breakfast and I ordered the stuffed raspberry french toast.  I ended up getting the cherry though...  I took a bite and while it was good I really wanted the raspberry.  I let them know and they quickly replaced my order with what I wanted and took it totally off the bill because they felt bad I had to wait longer for my food.  That was really unexpected and really nice!\n\nOnce I tried the raspberry stuffed french toast I loved it, really really good.  There are so many other things on the menu that I would love to try as well such as the banana chocolate chip pancakes, the breakfast burrito, ect.\n\nI would certainly go back to this place and hope that I do the next time I am in the Pittsburgh area.  So so good.",5
1481,"This place has NEVER disappointed when it comes to the food coming out of their kitchen. The lines occasionally go out the door but the wait is never very long. I have had many different items off the menu as it is a place my girlfriend and I frequent.\n\nIf you can ever get the Sausage Gravy and Biscuits, I would highly recommend, and this is coming from a very country boy who was raised on amazing pepper gravy and biscuits. I would be at Dor-Stop all the time if they had the sausage gravy on demand.\n\nNote: This is not the norm and the waitress seemed to be having a bad day. The only problem I have ever really had was when one of the waitresses didn't put forth much effort. She never stopped by to fill our drinks. Asked for our order and that was it. Even though we were friendly and polite, we never received the same in return. I understand that people have bad days. The waitresses here are very nice, but they are human and have their off days. Like I said, this was only one time, and on a subsequent visit, she was much more cheery and friendly. Everyone is human.\n\nI would recommend that anyone in the area give this place a try for breakfast and lunch.",5
1482,"I'm not ashamed to admit it - I was skeptical.  As a long-time lover of Pamela's, I just couldn't see this place making me happy when we discovered Pamela's in the Strip was closed on Memorial Day.  The wait was torturous at the Dor-Stop too...however, it was a holiday so I suppose i understand.  And when we did finally get seated, the AMAZING hot cakes, SUPERB hash browns, and perfectly cooked eggs really made my morning!\n\nI prefer my hot cakes to be thin and flat, and when I saw the ones here, I was unsure again.  But the taste will BLOW YOUR MIND.  I got the apple cinnamon ones - they are crispy yet fluffy with apples that taste very fresh and just the right amount of cinnamon.  I even enjoyed the butter as a sweet additive to a decadent treat!  The potatoes were also amazing - true lyonnaise style with crispy outsides, warm insides, and plenty of onions.  Eggs were standard fair, but overeasy is often executed poorly... so props for getting it exactly right.  Several of my friends also ordered different flavors of hot cakes and suggested the oatmeal ones are really not to be missed as well.\n\nDespite the long wait and weird waitress, we all LOVED our breakfast and I was full for hours after.  YUM!  Can't wait to go back!",5
1483,"BEST BREAKFAST I'VE EVER HAD!!! I had the Guy's Version of the Jumblot. My girlfriend had the chocolate chip banana pancakes. These were the best pancakes I've ever eaten. They have a texture and gooeyness that I've never had in a pancake. The Guy's Version was eggs, potatoes, jalape\u00f1os, tomato, cheddar, and hot sausage. The hot sausage had the most amazing flavor. \n\nEveryone should definitely make a trip here once! Pancakes are to die for!!",5
1484,Yes... Dorstop was on the Food Network but I believe that the show has brought too much business to the local breakfast/lunch restaurant. Most of the time the servers are cranky and rushing so they forget items or customer needs and the food isn't as good as it used to be. Either they need to expand their staff and restaurant or many others will see what I have.,3
1485,Folks this is very overrated.. they had Guy's Diners Drivein and Dives there only because Guy's parents knew owner. This is very avg food at best. Its nothing special.I wont go back.. Very small and uncomfortable. They have a large sign in window to play on Guy's visit a number of years ago. Dont fall for it.,2
1486,"I've been here twice, for brunch, with some friends. \nMy first time was confusing for my friend and I, because there was a line and we didn't know we had to sign in. After we were seated, we ordered food. The waitress was slow and unfriendly. She seemed irritated that we were there. The food was amazing, as our orders were small and uncomplicated, we just wanted to try the food. The second time was pretty much the same. The food was great and filling, but the servers were unfriendly and slow. Disheartening and not really worth dealing with for some pancakes. Try it out for the legend, like I did, but beyond the food, it's not much.",3
1487,"For what it's worth, dor-stop isn't good as people say it was. People are fanatical about this place and its food. Is their food really tasty or they're popular because the network show? From my perspective, I detest their service, the service is notoriously horrible and unacceptable. Also the food was unpalatable. I order pumpkin flavor pancakes and side order scramble eggs. I was too full and their portion is huge so I left two pieces of pancakes. The waitress don't even bother to ask me if I need a box to take it home or if everything is good. Although she did refilled my coffee once, I barely see her stop by and there wasn't too many people in the diner is isn't likely she is occupied by that amount of customers.I think the waitress was rude because she never say thank you during the entire breakfast even when I tipped her. I should have known, I just feel like they treated me differently that's all. This review is based on my dinning experience and the service. Seriously if they mean business they should improve. Especially waitress was lack of enthusiasm. Do I want to come back? Never ever.",1
1488,"I really, really wanted to try Dor - Stop, but it wasn't open when I went! My wife and I woke up early just to go there, and the diner was closed for the next few days, EVEN THOUGH IT DIDNT SAY THAT ON THE WEBSITE! Such a waste of time. If you're going to go, make sure you call ahead, just so you don't get screwed over like we did.",1
1489,"Ok, so I know this place is somewhat of an institution now because of their Food Network exposure, but I'm going to have to go against the grain here and say that I did not enjoy my Dor-Stop experience.\n\nWe came here many months ago after hearing all of the hype. I'd never been to Dormont before and we were eager to check out this place and the neighborhood in general (side bar: Dormont is adorable! If it were a bit more convenient to where we work and like to play, I would totally live there). \n\nAnyhow, so we get there on a Saturday morning, and the place is packed. No biggie, most good breakfast spots usually have a wait on a weekend morning. I think we waited about 30 mins, which wasn't bad. We're seated, we order, everything is just peachy. Then things started to go sour.\n\nIt had been about 40 minutes since we were seated and we still hadn't received our food. Other diners who were seated after us had received their food and were finishing up. Our waitress hadn't stopped by our table in a long time. I had started to wonder if maybe our ticket was lost (ordinarily I wouldn't think anything of it, but the fact that people seated after us had gotten their food made me think something might have been wrong). Anyway, so the next time we see our waitress walk by, we flag her down and ask her if she knew when our food would be out. We asked politely. We weren't snarky, we weren't mean, we didn't roll our eyes or snap our fingers. It was a simple question, one that I think many would probably ask. And the waitress replied, \""Are you really hungry or just really impatient?\"" No hint of a smile on her face. No twinkle in her eyes. It was clear that she wasn't joking (not that it would have been funny anyway). \n\nHmm. Are we really hungry or really impatient? Well, neither...we just wanted to make sure our ticket hadn't gotten lost. We sat in stunned silence, unsure of how we should respond to such a flat-out rude remark. The waitress left, and finally brought our food out about 10 minutes later (and then we never saw her again except for when she dropped off the check). By that point, our appetites were pretty much gone, and we just wanted to leave. So we scarfed down our food and got the heck out of dodge.\n\nI dunno. Maybe the waitress was having a bad day. Maybe she gets asked that question a lot (by actual impatient people) and is sick of hearing it. But we were very polite to her and didn't deserve to be treated like that. I don't care how good your food is (and for the record, the food was okay, but certainly not mind blowing for the all the hype), if you have lousy customer service, I can't support you. And it's a shame, because I really, really wanted to like this place (it looks like such a cute mom and pop place). With so many other great breakfast spots in the Burgh, I'd rather go somewhere that cares about giving their customers a good (or at least not a blatantly bad) experience.",2
1490,Food here is absolutely wonderful! Service is good and people are better. Take my family there and am extremely satisfied.,5
1491,"My sister and I both got the banana and chocolate chip hot cakes, and we loved them! Huge servings and you can also get the hot cakes with bacon, sausage, and ham for a slightly higher price. This was my second time going actually and if I could go every day I would! Highly recommend!",5
1492,Best pancakes in Pittsburgh besides DeLucas. Always delicious and the service is nice.,5
1493,"great breakfast place...period. worth the wait. had the stuffed french toast, and the bob's special. french toast was crisp and cooked perfectly, although not really stuffed, just an extra slather of raspberry jam. Bob's special was very tasty, German potato pancakes were a little under cooked but great tasting.  Service was quick and brisk, waited about 25 minutes on a Sunday morning, which was not bad but it was raining this day.",4
1494,"I had the Italian jombot here it was so good, and the service was awesome!!! I will definitely be back.",5
1495,"Shortly after moving to Dormont, while browsing the shops on Potomac, I came across the this gem of a diner. It was a Sunday after church and the line was wrapped around the block; as a diner enthusiast this was a fantastic sign. \n\nA few days later I brought a friend there for lunch the feta burger I had was amazing. The next time I went ,with my sister and nephew,  I got the burger again and an order of their famous pancakes. The flavor options were long, but I choose banana walnut. These where hands down the best pancakes I have ever consumed. \n\nThe atmosphere is wholesome. The waitstaff is not friendly but accommodating. Honestly they don't have time to be overly friendly they are too busy. However they do a fine job serving you. \n\nAll in all this place is an A-. The only downside for me was not having The cast from cheers welcome me by name. But the food is remarkable.",4
1496,"I have been to The Dor-Stop numerous times and never been disappointed. They are known for their pancakes as featured on The Food Network's \""Diners, Drive-ins and Dives.\"" \n\nI always get pancakes when I go and my favorites are banana walnut and pumpkin. These pancakes are thick and fluffy and so filling! I always end up taking at least one home. My husband has also tried their french toast which he highly recommends. \n\nThey get busy during the peak breakfast/brunch hours so a wait is sometimes necessary but they move fast with service without rushing you and you get out quick.  It has your basic diner feel. It is clean and service has always been warm and friendly. Prices are very reasonable in my opinion as my husband and I both eat for under $20. \n\nI love the Dor-stop and highly recommend it to others!",5
1497,"Ladies and Gentleman, welcome to pancake heaven. It was several years ago that I first came upon The Dor-Stop, and since then my breakfast lifestyle has been forever changed.\n\nI know this will sound like blasphemy coming from a Dor-Stop convert, but I hate pancakes. I just don't understand them, they are odd and moist, and nowhere near as delicious as waffles. I came into The Dor-Stop the first time with this mindset, and am now forever changed. \n\nThe Dor-Stop's hotcakes are delicious and almost cake-like. They aren't thin crepes, or undercooked globs of batter, but instead sweet, fluffy treats that come in a plethora of flavors. I personally endorse oatmeal walnut, but others love the banana or pumpkin (when in season). I recommend ordering the \""Egg Combo\"": 2 hot cakes, eggs, and bacon/sausage. Go all out, you deserve it. \n\nOn a recent visit, I also discovered the french toast menu, which has caused me to forsake my hot cake habit. The french toast is almost deep fried and covered in this raspberry yogurt. It is a can't miss item on the menu, rivaling that of the hot cake. When pumpkin french toast is a special on the menu, I suggest you run to The Dor-Stop and taste a little of heaven. \n\nI've also sampled various items from the lunch menu with no complaints. The Rachel and Ruben are especially tasty if you feel like bypassing the breakfast menu. \n\nThis place is truly heaven in Dor-Stop. Make sure you arrive early on a weekend morning to avoid the crowd! Or wake up at dawn on a weekday and partake (as I have been known to do from time to time!)",5

1499,I will never forget Campiti's. As a youngster growing up playing on Potomac Avenue and Dormont. My favorite pizza was and still is Campiti's. I have not found an equal in the 18 years I have been in CA. The hoagies were pretty damn good too.,5
1500,"We were in Pittsburgh from out of town and read the reviews so we decided on Don Campiti's Pizza. Urban Spoon rated 91% favorite. This pizza is not good. Honestly, it tastes like Geno's frozen pizza from the grocery store. The pepperoni was very good. The crust was super thin and tasted like a salteen cracker. I've had much better pizza and will be exploring other options next time I'm in the burg.",2
1501,"Camp's has a cult following.   As soon as you walk in you can smell the melting mozzarella.  Love that smell.  W grew up on Camp's and is almost in the cult, so we go to Camp's from time to time.  It has been a real long time since our last visit so it was fun to stop back in.  \n\nThe crust is a medium thickness, not to thin and not to thick, and somewhat crunchy.  One friend calls it almost like a biscuit, I really don't get that, but it is a little chewy and just a little brown around the edge.  One thing that I notice is they do not overload the pizza with sauce and toppings like some places.  Enjoyed our pizza and will be back.  Have had the hoagie in the past and if I remember correctly, it is very good.",3
1502,"Great pie...I could eat a whole large though...if you like a thin crust, you will love this",4
1503,"People really are nuts about their pizza in the 'burgh - this I'm learning. \n\nI ordered a pizza from here because it's in my hood (walking distance, even) and because someone told me it's been their favorite pizza since they were wee little. I think a lot of places in Pit have false-yum status because people are just emotionally attached to things they've eaten for so many years... I don't fault them for that, but this just isn't great pizza, in my opinion.",2
1504,"Consistent and quality.  Although it might be a love it or hate it thing.  I love it, so there ya go.",4
1505,"Disappointed after hearing so many good things. Pizza crust is like a cracker. Hoagie is pretty good, but does not remove the disappointment over the pizza. I think Molly's Pizza next door is a lot better....I won't order from here again.",2
1506,Compared to the original Don Campiti Pizza of the 60's and 70's this is not even close. The legacy of a superior pizza in Dormont has lost it. No longer up there with Beto's and area best. Sad to say this pizza was so bad. I have been a diehard customer of the 60's and 70's. Crust was like cardboard. Toppings were worse. What happened to the legacy Don Campitis Pizza ?,1
1507,"When my car died, I originally had it towed to Ruffing because it was close to where my car broke down.  After I saw the good reviews, I figured it'd be worth a shot, and was surprised at how awful the people were.\n\nRuffing originally suggested I take my car to a dealer, since it's an uncommon model and they didn't know what the problem was.  I asked if I could just pay for a vehicle diagnostic, since they're more likely to be honest than a dealership. They said it would take around a day-and-a-half to get to it.\n\nAlmost three days later, I hadn't heard back from them.  Since I need my car on a daily basis, it was frustrating that they were well past their quoted time with no updates as to what was going on.  The repairs are what should take time - not a diagnostic.\n\nMy biggest issue was the attitude I received when I called.  When I called to see why there was a delay, the mechanic became agitated.  His tone became condescending when he told me it's my fault for leaving the car with him -- that I just HAD to have him look at it and I was SO against going elsewhere.  He said he had cars sitting there for weeks that he hasn't even touched yet (?) so he can't bother with mine. Ultimately I had to get my car towed to a dealership anyway, since I couldn't afford to have my car sit at their shop for \""weeks\"".\n\nI wished they were more up front with how back logged they were, rather than trying to give me a schedule they couldn't abide by, and then take their stress out on me when I followed up with them.\n\nI wouldn't recommend this mechanic to anyone.  You're better off going somewhere that has realistic wait-times and up front communication.  And you definitely don't want to deal with a mechanic who is going to lose his cool with you at the drop of a hat.",1
1508,"You know it's bad when you get in your car practically in tears because of how bad the haircut is. Having curly hair, I've had my fair share of terrible haircuts. The one I had at this salon was among the worst. I explained to the owner of the salon how I wanted my layering, but apparently because I didn't tell him exactly how to cut my hair - since after all, I figured he's the one who should know how to cut hair, including curly hair - it's my fault that I received such a terrible haircut. Sorry, I guess I was too busy watching in horror as he blunt cut horizontal layers into my hair (exactly the opposite of what you're supposed to do with curly hair). The owner clearly has no idea how to cut curly hair. And he's overpriced to boot. The other stylists may give better cuts, but the owner's attitude (\""It's not my fault\"") suggests this salon deserves no one's business.",1
1509,"My husband and I have been coming here for the past six years and cannot say enough about the salon.  Prior to finding Geno Como, I could never get the correct looking highlights/lowlights until I found Lisa here (I'm 44!).  My hair has never looked so beautiful and I am so glad that we found such a great place.  Everyone is so friendly and I love coming here as the salon has a light and airy look to it which is very relaxing, yet the prices are very reasonable.  I have recommended more people to this salon and they are also very happy.  You cannot go wrong with Geno Como!!!",5
1510,"Short of getting on my hands and knees and begging the stylist to cut ONE HALF of an INCH, I don't know what else I could have done.. \n\nBefore every haircut I explain that I am very particular about the length of my hair -- I want to keep it long, it grows very slowly, that it is IMPERATIVE to only cut a TINY AMOUNT off, etc, etc. I made this extremely clear to the stylist. She promised that she \""wouldn't do anything crazy..\""\n\nLet's just say I am using this as a cathartic outlet for my experience because I went in for a trim but left with FOUR INCHES missing from my hair. I'm still recovering aesthetically and emotionally from this trauma! It just doesn't make sense to me why a stylist would do exactly the opposite of what was requested. I think maybe she is used to cutting children's hair and not listening to them. But either way, what should have been a really quick/easy trim, turned into one of the most extreme haircuts of my life. It all could have been so easily avoided. It doesn't feel fair. \n\nProceed with caution..",1
1511,"I am not impressed.  The food was so-so and my boyfriend and I had a coupon purchased that morning from restaurants.com and they wouldn't accept it. I bought it that morning, sorry if it should have been taken off the website but you should honor it. I would not pay their full price for it, but with a nice coupon then maybe it could be worth it. The quality of the food was not good enough to outweigh the service.",2
1512,Mediocre  Food  Service and Atmosphere.\nBetter to stay clear and save your money.  \nJudging from the empty tables the luster and joy of the Namaste we remembered is no longer.\n\nWe experienced the following sub par  dishes while dining after 8 pm on a Friday evening in an empty restaurant:\n\nBland reheated Samosas.\nFlavorless Malek Paneer. ( the cheese pcs were quite good despite)  inconsistent  and barely there flavors of certainly fresh frozen spinach mix. \nBarely reheated Naan. \n\nWe traveled to eat at Namaste specifically based on delightful past experience. Obviously that feeling is long gone.  The staff  were content to chat with friends and answer frequent texts and cell phone calls while we ate. \n\nThe loud thump of bass from modern indian music with the  electric din of the TV playing Bollywood extracts might have been a nice distraction in a busy restaurant.  Instead  when added to the ding of texts and cell phone calls the loud background noises detracted rather than added  anything to an already mediocre dining experience.,2
1513,"I really liked this food. I'm not Indian, but my boyfriend is. He liked it too! \n\nWe stopped in on a Saturday afternoon. We ordered from the menu instead of the buffet. We ordered the chili chicken, chicken 65, lamb biryani, Lamb vindaloo, and tadka dal. It was delicious. The chicken 65 wasn't spicy or flavorful enough, but everything else was incredible. We spiced everything at. 7/10. It had a bite, but wasn't too hot. \n\nErythema was freshly made. There were only two other families in the restaurant when we were there, both Indian/Pakistani? \n\nService was slow and grumpy. But it was totally worth it. It's hard to find good Indian food in Pittsburgh. Udipi is ok for pure veg... Corriander is greasy... India gardens dishes all taste the same... \n\nI would return. \n\nPortions were small, but I like that because then you can order more things to taste! Although, prices were relatively high. Every entree was about $12 and were ordered 4. It was worth it regardless.",4

1515,"I was very excited to try this place since the closure of Maharaja left us without a good Indian buffet on the side of Pittsburgh where I live, and I wasn't crazy about the restaurant that moved in afterward.  The place was relatively deserted on a Saturday afternoon and we were soon greeted by a woman who asked us what kind of naan we wanted (onion or plain).  The food tasted fairly good but what really turned us off was the woman who worked there and her constant coughing, hacking and wheezing without even covering her mouth!  Clearly she had a nasty cold and should've stayed home that day!  I cringed every time she went back into the kitchen (we could here her back there hacking up a lung) or came over to our table.  It was so unappetizing that we hardly ate anything and got out of there as soon as possible.  I don't think I can go back there given their low standard of hygiene.  Ick, I'm cringing right now thinking of it.  On the plus side though, it did keep me from overeating.  Maybe I should have my husband cough and hack at me whenever we go to buffets from now on!\n\nAnyway, I hate to trash a restaurant but I had to voice my concerns.  I am very conflicted about giving the second star, but the food itself wasn't bad.  Try at your own risk!",2

Odd atmosphere,  they need some background music or something.  The soap opera on tv just didn't cut it.  They do give you fresh naan bread which is nice, old buffet naan always sucks.  Good if you're in the area and need a cheap lunch but not worth going out of your way for.",3
1518,"I have dined at Namaste for the final time.  I am tired of being served by an individual that does not speak: who treats the customer with disdain and indifference.  The words \""thank you\"" and \""how are you\"" are not part of the lexicon here.  The buffet items reflect economizing.  Virtually no cauliflower is used, thus my favorite dish, aloo gobi, is never offered..  There sometimes is no rice pudding, and in place of the India staple buffet item, chicken tandoori, the cheaper and less appealing chicken wings are offered.  It is s shame that such a beautiufl, comfortable restaurant space is being wasted.  For a mere $1.01 more, I can receive a spectacular and delicious array of the finest Indian food in the lovely atmosphere of All India, North Craig Street, Oakland, where I receive gracious, personal attention from the owners.",1
1519,"Here is our experience on my friend's daughter's birthday party:-\n\nI and my wife attended my friend's daughter's birthday party here recently. My friend mentioned that they finalized the menu for the lunch buffet a week in advance. The restaurant chef at the last moment on the day of party, just one hour before lunch, told that they did not get the \""PANEER/cheese\"". They can substitute it for \""MALAI KOFTA\"". It was unbelievable that they changed the dish at the last moment requested by my friends as 50% guests were vegetarian and hence need a cheese / \""PANEER\"" entree. On the other hand the \""MALAI KOFTA\"" was just \""POTATO\"" in the gravy. The quality of food in this party was awfully bad. \n\nThis is a humble request to all INDIAN Americans and all NON-INDIAN Americans that please don't throw your money by going to this restaurant. We are not here to misguide you or someone from a competitor restaurant. You can confirm these details with me anytime, I am engineer by profession. I was thinking to host my son's birthday party over here next month but I am lucky to get an experience before hand. I will NEVER NEVER recommend this place EVER.",1
1520,"Shockingly bad.  I know it's Pittsburg so my expectations were low, but there is no call for rudeness.  The old lady should retire.  The young waiter was ok but clearly  scared of the woman.   I went to the dinner buffet at 530 pm, the food was obviously left over from lunch, the rice was so old it was crunchy, all other food was very low quality and mostly cold. I always like to say something nice so the sweet carrot dish was not horrible.  My search for quality Indian food in the 'burgh continues.",1
1521,"I think the quality and flavor of the food keeps me coming back even though the old woman is very unpleasant, I have never been there when there was more than three or four people in the whole restaurant. I don't know how long they could survive and that is unfortunate.  On one occasion I was waited on by a young man who was very friendly and pleasant , where did he go? This place has potential but the old lady must go.",3
1522,"It's kinda strange when you enter because you literally hit the hotel's registration counter, and then you wonder where the restaurant is because it looks like the hotel couldn't fit a restaurant.  It's to the left of the counter.  \n\nAnyhow, I have mixed feelings.  One, it's a huge buffet.  Two, it's cheap (8.99 for dinner, maybe 7.99? for lunch) and includes all you can drink soda, chai, etc.  Three, mango lassi is part of the buffet.  Four, the food on the buffet can be very strange.  \n\nSo, pricewise, when you include free drinks/mango lassi, it's damn worth it, as long as you can find two or three other items you like.  On the other hand, you may not like anything at all on the buffet.  \n\nTheir nan is average in texture but has garlic and herbs, so it's now foccacia nan and tastes delicious.  Papadum is done well.  Lamb kabobs are good, but I wish they had lamb curry.  Their selection of meat is small relative to the size of the buffet.\n\nOn the other hand, they have plenty of vegetarian items, but I prefer to avoid cream, butter and cheese that I didn't eat much of them.  I did try the spinach and they have the most wonderful version of spinach: it's cheesy spinach (but doesn't look like there's melted cheese in it).  Awesome.  \n\nBut then again, their chickpeas were in a sauce that tasted like a combination of spaghetti sauce and ketchup-- yuck!\n\nI suppose this place is geared to fat vegetarians who can have dairy.  Oh, and the atmosphere is pretty lonesome.  It was probably once the grand dining hall of the hotel and now kinda ghostly.  I think it's worth an initial visit and worth it for budget eaters.",3
1523,"This place is crazy! It's an Indian restaurant located within a Days Inn. I love it because it's so quirky. Go for the buffet. Don't bother with the menu. The buffet is just as unique as the location of the restaurant. They usually have several vegetarian options and some meat options also. \n\nWhat makes this buffet so different is the fact that it has malai kofta, pickled toppings, and self serve mango lassi. I have never seen any of the above mentioned items on a buffet.\n\nThe taste is not the best and sometimes the food comes off as warmed over, but it is good and so much fun to stop in and stuff your belly with as much or as little as you like, all while sitting in such an unusual location.",3
1524,"I cannot believe how anyone can like this place. May be the service was bad the day I went. I walked in .... then found that the place had a smell that was not pleasant. But, I got adjusted to that in a few moments. I found only 4 or 5 items in the buffet. None of them looked fresh. I tried this place only because of the other yelp reviews. I would never go there again.",1
1525,"Agree with chaitiyana. This place is pretty bad. The food isn't fresh. They have a Buffet even for dinner. I stayed at Days Inn for 2wks here and was forced to eat here a few times. The mango lassi was good, the naans (when fresh) were good, but mostly it all stunk.",2
1526,"Maharaja is located in the Days Inn on Banksville Rd, and we tried it one day for lunch. Not really understanding the positive reviews here, but to each his/her own. I found the food watery, overcooked (even by Indian food standards) and tasteless. There seemed to be no care in preparation of the dishes, so that the vegetables weren't cut into the same sizes, each dish tasted much like the other, and the food didn't even look attractive. I don't mind divey surroundings, but I abhor a smelly old carpet, and they have wall to wall carpeting that was around before most of us were. They offer mango lassi which they keep in the original gallon plastic jug that they bought it in...at least pretend that you made it. There are 2 better Indian restaurants a stones throw from this place...Namaste and Mintt, both across the street.",1
1527,"This is pretty close to where we live so we eat there quite a bit. Freshness of food really is hit or miss. I like all of the veggie options there. I think it's a great place to take someone who has never had Indian food. Buffet style lets someone new to this kind of food try a bit of everything. The mango lassi is always delicious! I like that it's NEVER busy, crowded or loud. Anytime we want to to relax for weekend lunch, we head there for the chilled out environment. They are currently undergoing a remodel, so I am looking forward to seeing what it looks like when they are finished.",3
1528,"I'm not about reviewing fast food places, but I found out this Arby's was the first in Pittsburgh. It even has the HUGE cowboy hat out front as a marker. \n\nIt has all the stuff you'd expect, Roast Beef sandwiches, and those amazing Jamocha Shakes Arby's is known for.",2
1529,"I actually don't mind the Arby's chain; I certainly don't go to one on a regular basis, but when I do I usually enjoy the treat that is a nice giant sandwich and a side of curly fries. Usually what I get from an Arby's is an a-ok fast food variety sandwich that, while greasy, is still very tasty and doesn't leave me feeling sick to my stomach.\n\nThat said, I never enjoy the food I pick up from this particular Arby's. Firstly, often when I've placed an order in their drive-thru I've found that I've had to sit and wait for my \""fast food\"" for 10 to 15 minutes. After waiting for my food - on the days that I didn't leave the line in frustration before placing an order at all because I couldn't even do so in a reasonable amount of time - I've found that what I've gotten has been mediocre compared to what I've experienced at other Arby's. Common issues I've come across include the lack of sauces when I've asked for them, overcooked food, and so much grease that the sandwich begins coming apart AND after eating I begin to feel sick to my stomach.\n \nSorry, guys. I may not expect a lot from a fast food joint, but this Arby's just doesn't impress me.",1
1530,"This is a very typical neighborhood Foodland.  It looks like it hasn't been renovated since the days of the Steelers \""Immaculate Reception\"", but it kind of has a certain well-worn charm.  The place is crowded and cramped too, but not unpleasant.  The parking lot is very small, but as I was taking the \""T\"", it wasn't an issue.   I stopped here last night because I was in the neighborhood attending a meeting at someone's house close by and I volunteered to pick up a treat. \n\nI'd say that this place is worth it for your run-of-the-mill staples and nothing else.",2
1531,It's an IGA now.,2
1532,"Eh, it's pretty much a big convenience store to me, but they have the necessities. I prefer the Greentree Giant Eagle, but it is good to have a market within walking distance to us. There's not much more I can say about it.",3
1533,"The white pizza truly is delicious, as are all of their fatty appetizers.  They also offer pasta and other options so there is something to please everyone in any size group you bring to Bado's.",3
1534,"Bado's is a definite neighborhood joint.  Located on Beverly in Mt. Lebo, it's super-busy during meal times.  \n\nFood can be hit and miss.  Best to stick with the pizza, which is pretty good, and the soup and salads, which are quite good.  Place also has a solid beer selection, which is reasonably priced.  That said, we've found that it's a total mistake to order anything else off the menu -- except at breakfast, which again is pretty good.  (Their omlets are huge!)  For example, we once ordered a spinach-artichoke app.  Sounded delicious.  Um... it was creamed spinach (probably of frozen origin) with some canned artichokes in it.  Disappointing to say the least.\n\nAlso be aware that they close the kitchen ... when they feel like it.  I didn't know that until we were drinking a few beers there a while back and they made a kitchen last call.  My sister asked the bartender when the kitchen closes -- he said, when we feel like it.\n\nOne thing is for sure, though, if you go with what they do best (Pizza and beer), you won't be disapointed.  Plus, the servers are true Pittsburgh and generally very sweet.",3
1535,I love this place. I live within walking distance and I find myself there a lot. Tons of beer choices (microbrews for you beer snobs) and great pizza & pub food.  It's a perfect pizza pub in every way. Try the hot lime flavored wings. They make your eyes well up when you put your face over them to smell the amazing wing aroma. Nice bartenders and wait staff as well.,5
1536,"Meh. At best. So I went to Bado's tonight w/ my dad and sister and it was a bit lackluster. I started out with chicken noodle soup (w/ no noodles) and a very spicy bloody ( I know. I know. I am an avid evening bloody mary drinker.) The bloody mary was pretty awesome for what I assume is a pre-made mix. I also got a grilled swordfish salad which was bland as hell! Iceberg lettuce, croutons, cucumbers, and dry swordfish. Lame. My dad got a meatball casserole which is something I would have never ordered...meatballs and casserole aren't a selling point for me, let alone as a package deal.  This meatball casserole dish was just pasta and meatballs...thankfully for my dads heart. \n\nMy sister got a salad (again just iceberg lettuce, croutons, cucumbers) with chicken fingers.  She also split a small mushroom pizza with my dad which was above average. \n\nI guess pizza is what Bados is known for so you should just stick with that if you go.  \n\nPro: Spicy bloody marys, decent pizza, cute waiter, wide beer selection\nCon: bland salads, noodleless noodle soups, not many healthy options, no dinner entrees besides pasta,",2
1537,"Friday evening, my folks called me up and said they were out toward Mt. Lebo and asked if my wife and I wanted to meet for dinner. We said sure, and they chose Bado's.\nThe place is nice with a warm, inviting atmosphere. \nOur server was friendly, but clearly dealing with to my tables. He actually made me feel anxious when he'd stop by!\nMy family decided to split a traditional pizza with pepperoni and mushroom. My wife and I added a dozen Guinness/ Honey Mustard wings and split a Reuben.\n\nThe wings came out in record time and were pretty good. Although, I still don't think the Guinness aspect did anything for the flavor. They sure tasted like any other honey mustard wing I've ever had.\n\nThe Reuben was average, but very large. It came with potato chips and a pickle spear. For the $9 price tag, you'd think they could do fries over chips.\n\nThe pizza was good; not great. Based on reviews, I thought the pizza would be even better. Maybe I'm being a bit picky, but there are enough great pizza joints in the city that you can afford to be.\n\nAll in all, Bado's is a nice place to have a casual dinner. I wouldn't go out of my way to try it, but if you're local give it a go. If you want an inviting atmosphere where you can enjoy a beer, have some pizza and enjoy the company of friends or family, this won't disappoint.",3
1538,"This is a popular place so usually skip it due to a short wait list...just don't want to wait  for pizza and so many pizza shops in the area.  No wait on this Friday night.  Bado's has  all that you need..a good beer selection, neat atmosphere, and more than pizza..pub grub, lots of options here.  The wait staff was good and on the ball.  \n\nBut the pizza is what most people talk about so we ordered \""Bado's  Famous Pizza\""   (the traditional, Our most popular crust)\"" and the hot wings.  It did not take long and the pizza and wings came out.  The wings were hotter than most places and pretty good.  The pizza crust was a little thicker and nice flavor and chewy, good though I tend to prefer thinner crust.  All in all, a nice place, good beer, good service and food.",3
1539,"Hostess was very awkward when seating us. Sat us in the corner in a small booth with a broken seat right up against another large party. The place was by no means busy. We sat and waited for someone to acknowledge us. We watched 4 members of the wait staff each attend to the 4 other tables and not one of them ever acknowledged us or came over. After 15 minutes of being ignored by staff, we got up and walked out. It's a shame too... we liked the looks of the menu and the bar list and specials. Don't think we'd ever come back after that. There are plenty of other places.",1
1540,"I went with my boyfriend and one of his coworkers to this joint for lunch last week. As the rating suggests - meh.\n\nIt wasn't terrible and the service was fine. I just feel like I've had much better pizza elsewhere around town. And for sure a better margherita. Theirs fell into the category that I find most end up in: a regular cheese pizza. Quite a few places seem to not understand the differences between the two, and this place was no different.\n\nNow, the cheese/margherita pizza they served me was pretty good, but it didn't stand out for me. The other two ordered sandwiches of some sort that they both really seemed to like. The beer selection was also a bit lacking for my taste, but that may just be because they didn't have anything I liked so I stuck with water (that's me when I go out to eat: alcohol or water ;).",2
1541,"I have been a patron of Bado's several times now, and this is a great spot to have few beers, watch a game, and meet up with friends.  Their beer selection is commendable and is frequently updated.  I have sat a the bar and had a table.  I've never had a problem with service.  Staff is knowledgeable and makes great suggestions.  \nNow for the food...their pizza is so yummy!  I love everything about it. The cheese, sauce, toppings...all great.  Their wings are also good.  \nIt can get quite packed during a game or on a weekend evening, so there can be a wait.  Grab a beer and wait b/c it's worth it.",4
1542,If I lived in the South Hills I would come here all the time. I am not even sure how the pizza place across the street stays in business. I suspect that after the locals are done getting hammered off of Bado's awesome beer selection they need to order some crap when homebase has closed. Or it is a front for the mob.,4
1543,"Bado's is a nice place to go to get decent food. Pretty average as far as I've seen so far. The reason for 3 stars is that the bar is small and the beer is over priced. I understand it's micro and craft beers on tap but there are other places near by with the micro and crafts for less with better atmosphere. Big plus to the bartenders though, very nice and helpful.",3
1544,"pricey, pricey pricey and it isnt that good!",1
1545,"I just want to like it due to its location and great beer selection, but the food is awful.",2
1546,one of the worst steak sandwiches i've ever eaten. there were 7 of us and the only people who liked their food were the kids and the one who had the pizza. \n\ni would never eat here again,1
1547,"We just ate there on a Friday night and the whole experience was a disaster. Rude, unfriendly, just a miserable male server. Drinks were lousy , service was lousy, food just o.k., nothing to write home about, and at 9:00 on a Friday night they were putting chairs on the tables and vacuuming, hinting it was time for us to leave. The whole experince was horrible... and the bill was outrageous.  Save your money and Go somewhere else!!!!",1
1548,"I am not being hyperbolic when I say that my last experience here was the worst food experience I have ever had.\n\n I have eaten at Bado's before and have had pizza that was pretty tasty. So when my roomate wanted to go there, I was pretty excited. There were 4 of us. Two of us had burgers while the other two ordered wedding soup and shared potato skins. My burger was delicious. It was juicy and smothered in bleu cheese. \n\nWhile my food was really good, there were some issues with the other items ordered. Two of my guests cited that the wedding soup had a metalic taste to it while my other friend with the burger found a hair. Being a hairdresser and understanding that it does happen sometimes, she disregarded it and continued to eat her burger. Unfortunately, the hair did not stop there. Another guest found several hairs in their meal as well. We decided that we should let our waitress know. I stopped the waitress and explained how there was hair in two people's food. The waitress got upset and was very rude (it's not like we accused her of planting the hair herself). On top of this, she mistakenly took my burger and walked away with it, leaving the sullied food on the table. When she came back I told her that my burger was not one of the items with food on it and she instantly became defensive. At this point we asked for a manager (who never came) and insisted our meal get comped. Considering she threw out the only good food that we ordered, we didn't feel like that was asking too much. Luckily the waitress did not put up too much of a fight. \n\nI will never eat at Bado's again. A good cheese burger and a decent pie isn't enough when the staff can't even accept their own (human) mistakes. I have been places where there have been food issues before and I have also worked in a restaurant. I completely understand that mistakes happen. However, the reaction that we received was unacceptable.",1
1549,best pizza on beverly rd,4
1550,Had the gnocchi delivered. Absolutely terrible. Gnocci's had to have been 2 years old. Delivery guy was shady too.,1
1551,"Got into Pittsburgh late this evening and this was the only place around that was still open and delivered after 11 pm. I give them a half star for this. \n\nThey have a few vegetarian choices on the menu. I give them another half star for this. I ordered what I thought would have the most vegetables, the \""vegetable calzone.\"" \n\nThey ended up delivering a \""Mediterranean calzone,\"" which was also vegetarian, but it wasn't what I ordered. The small portion of vegetables was tasty and most of them seemed fresh, so I give them another half star for this. I didn't bother to ask if anything was organic.\n\nThey told me it would be about a 45 minute wait, but it ended up being closer to 30 and the delivery guy was friendly. I give them another half star for under-promising and over-delivering. \n\nThis place might be great for people who love fresh made bread and lots of cheese, but it's not a vegan delight!",2
1552,I don't like this place at all. The staff here is always rude and has no sense of care at all for their business. A couple years ago I had heard they smoke over making their pizza. All of their employees tend to be shady. I don't recommend at all.,1
1553,"What a cool place! I have NO green thumb WHATSOEVER, but had passed by for about a year now since I moved to Dormont and had always thought the shop looked cute. Now was my chance as I needed a last minute Christmas present for my grandma. \n\nThe place is larger than you think from the outside. They actually have a whole outdoor area that's covered for the winter with many different plants I couldn't identify. I thought the owner was super duper sweet and just really energetic. Her and another staff member helped me pick out a plant that was in a vase, not in a pot, and looked really cool and modern. I loved it and had a fleeting thought to pick one up myself... if I wouldn't kill it (which I probably would!). \n\nI had commented about a table full of vases filled with what looked like works of art. They turned out to be flower displays for hotels, but man where they cool. If I was doing an event or having a wedding, that's exactly what I would have wanted. They just looked really modern but creative. \n\nThey also have some winged friends you can say hi to, including one screaming one in the back that you can't see. Kinda creepy, but I guess that comes with a unique shop! I will absolutely be back to pick up items for people and consider them for any events I have coming up.",5
1554,"I had a positive experience with this shop. I needed something framed at the last minute, and within extremely precise parameters (that weren't easy to abide by), and they not only got the work done correctly and on time, but at a reasonable price. \n\nThe staff is a little gruff, but not at all unfriendly, and I am happy to have found a local shop that I will return to.",4
1555,"I wish there were negative stars I could put for this place.  One of the most unprofessional experiences I have ever had with a business owner, not even a worker.  I was yelled at, mocked, and generally treated like crap for checking up on a remounting job that was supposed to be done within a week.  Emotional mess the rest of the day.  I have never been treated that way with any owner of a business.   I work with restaurant owners for god's sake!   Unbelievable.   If you want the full story, email me and I will tell you the whole thing.  As it is right now, DO NOT patronize this business.   There was absolutely no excuse for his attitude.",1
1556,"Well returned to Supercuts this afternoon and they agreed that my hair was a little...well...oddly cut behind the ears. Gina (manager) offered to blend it in, but unfortunately I had no time as I was on my way to the airport. I may get it touched up later this week. She was apologetic and offered my next cut to be free. So I am pretty stoked about a free cut and I'm not sure if I should just wait for my hair to grow back or get it touched up.",3
1557,"Meh. I hate how this store is laid out, and everything is tackily displayed. I also hate how they gouge you for printer ink. Huge store, not much going on inside. Too bad it's so close.",3

1559,"Absolutely wretched and incompetent billing department.  Overcharged four months in a row, called every month and was repeatedly told it would be fixed.

I am considering filing a complaint with the better business bureau and the attorney general.",1
1560,Come here instead of D's if you need to buy cases of beer. They're cheaper than D's and everything is easy to find. Thanks to the peeps at D's for the referral.,4

1562,"It would get 4 stars for the name alone.  The idea that they would just sell you hot dogs and six-packs is so just and pure it almost makes me want to weep.  \n\nI went here and had the bacon chili cheddar dog and one with relish, kraut, and brown mustard.  Both were excellent dogs, and their beer list is incredible.  \n\nAgain, how come we can't have this is Boston, where it comes off as real?  If they tried this in NYC or Boston, it would come off as a gimmick.  Whereas here, in Swissvale, it just seems like a neighborhood place with a twist.  A coronary twist.  So good.....",5
1563,"This place was great! I was a little bit let down by the Chicago hot dog as it had too much mustard. That said, however, I was really excited by the beer selection and the neon green relish. If you're looking for a chill meal, this is a great place to check out!",4
1564,"This place came highly recommended when I moved to Pittsburgh two years ago. They have an amazing beer selection, good dogs and they must have expanded the place in the last year because they have a pull up garage wall that I never noticed before. Fries are good too. \n\nSomething about it is gimmicky to me but I'll let it go. Might as well stop here first before going to see a movie across the street...",3
1565,"It's getting three stars for the beer selection.  The hot dogs are nothing special, nor is one enough if you're hungry. I can buy a package of hot dogs at Giant Eagle and get the same effect times 10.\nLast time I was there someone said the pizzas looked good. Next time.",3
1566,"This place is no longer the cool hole-in-the-wall place to get a hot dog and beer (from a good selection).  They've expanded and that is both good and bad in my mind.  I liked the small, personal feel to the old place, but it definitely limited how many people who could be in the shop at a time.  So, now they have a much more extended seating area with a bar area and a back room devoted to brews.  I brought my friends here who like beer, and they were ecstatic to find a fave beer that they haven't been able to find anywhere in the DC area.  (Go Pittsburgh!).  The selection is nice and its good to see that I can find those out of the way beers so that I don't have to get just the norm from a beer distributor.  \n\nThe hot dogs?  None of us were gushing about them afterward.  But they're ok.  4 stars for the beer selection.",4
1567,"Love the BEER CAVE - would make any beer-neanderthal happy! Sorta like grabbing a cold one out of your friend's fridge, except D's has a giant selection.\n\nThe servers were pretty friendly, even when it was last call. I can't say the food was so great, but the beer options and good prices help to make up for it. This seems like an easy-going neighborhood bar, and I bet it's even nicer when the garage door window is open during the warmer months.",3
1568,good beer selection- both on tap and in the beer cave. located in a nice neighborhood.  the chili cheese dog is fantastic and so are the fries!!,4
1569,"Their chicken BBQ pizza is among the greaseiest I've ever consumed, but their beer selection is good, atmosphere is pleasant, and service is friendly.",4
1570,"Made my first trip to D's today.  By far one of the best bars I have been to.  Great atmosphere, good food for a bar, and how can I not mention the BEER CAVE.  They have an impeccable selection of brew.  Great place to go for a night out or just to have a good time.  I would imagine a Stiller game would be pretty fun to watch.  The prices are just right including drinks, but if only we could do something about the county drink tax.  \n\nI will visit this place frequently.",5
1571,"The hot dogs are somewhat disappointing and the beer is slightly overpriced, but you come here for the sheer selection of those beers. An enormous beer cave makes one feel like a kid in a beer store. Unfortunately, only their cheaper domestic/import selection is refrigerated, which really sucks cause you can't drink those beers you find int he beer cave right away. Still, if you're looking for selection, this is the place.",3
1572,"Even though they were out of the first beers we asked for (the Dogfish Punkin) this place hit the spot for a junk food craving. Vegetarians: the veggie dog is awesome, not rubbery or pale but nearly mistakable for an actual hot dog. I ordered one with kraut and mustard, and my boyfriend braved the three-cheese dog, which was hard to pick up but looked tasty. Their fries were good, and were generously portioned (definitely shareable) for a $1.50 small. Next time, we'll delve more into their beer selection.",3
1573,"Best beer selection and bar food I've ever had- anywhere. The Vienna Beef hot dogs are delicious and the Buffalo wings the best in the 'burgh. The kielbasa and fish sandwiches are solid, as is their pizza (I was skeptical- I thought, why not stick w/ just the hot dogs since they're perfect? but they're also very good.). Skip the chips- they taste burned. The fries are sooo good- get them with chili and cheese or pub style (cheese and bacon with homemade ranch to dip in)...  Yes if you eat this every day it will kill you, but if you're looking for the best bar food- this is it. If you're looking for the best beer selection- you can't find anything better. Good selection on tap and amazing variety in the beer cave (they say it's ~1000 different beers). Some say Sharp Edge has better on tap...but their food is terrible.",5
1574,"The name itself is pretty self explanatory.  You can pretty much get a hot dawg any way you like it.  Although I've never tried a Chicago Dog in Chicago, D's Chicago Dogs are one of my faves on their menu.  D's also makes a mean chili which is good on your dawgs or pomme frites.  Not to mention the plethora of beer!! They have almost every beer imaginable (unfortunately not on tap). D's is a local favourite and is definitely worth a try when visiting Pittsburgh.",4
1575,"I come here for the veggies dogs. My husband comes here for the beer cave. The beer is a bit expensive (compared to buying it in stores in NY). But if you're craving your favorite difficult to find because of the crazy PA licquor laws, this is your place. \n\nThis place is family and group friendly, so sometimes you might have a wait.",4
1576,"This is probably my favorite bar in Pittsburgh.  The pizza is solid, the hot dogs are great, and the beer cave...mmmm.  My only complaint is that they haven't opened another one on the other side of town!",5
1577,"What a cool place.  The beercave was very unique.  If I hadn't just had my wisdom teeth out, I would have totally sampled some of the fine brews they had stocked away.  What I did enjoy was the friend zucchini.  It was hot from the fryer when it got to our table, and it absolutely hit the spot.  I'd never had it before, and zucchini is one of my favorite vegetables.  My friend said that the service can be slow, but we didn't have any problems.",4
1578,"Well, it has good hot dogs and a wide, wide variety of beer, stocking without pretense; Miller and Unibrau.  The hot dogs are good.  The beer is unfortunately not so cheap; six packs aren't much cheaper than just buying four or five beers.  Bad for groups more that four people; great for two or three.",3
1579,Place was awesome.\n\nDelirium on tap.\n\nHot dogs with mac n cheese on them.,5
1580,"In my final meal in Pittsburgh, I finally had the closest thing to a Pittsburgh sandwich and that was the Big Ben Hot Dog with cole slaw, fries, and a cheese sauce. It oddly worked and I enjoyed the meal before I had to hit the road. The fries our table shared was also a winner as they were crispy and uniformly cut and fluffy potato goodness in the middle. Definitely a great cheap eats spot.",4
1581,"Rupe Rankings of note:\n- #1: crave factor\n- #1: signature sandwich (hotdog)\n- #1: beer selection\n- #2: pizza\n- #2: fries\n\nMenu recommendations:\n- chili cheese dog\n- scorpassi (kielbasa with jalapenos)\n- garden pizza\n- plain fries\n- any brew you haven' t had or from blue point, ommegang or bell's\n\nWhy you would go:\n- 1000+ bottled beers on hand for on-premise consumption or customized 6-pack creation\n- 30-40 brews on tap for pints or take-away growlers\n- awesome pub food\n- miller lite for cheap (in the new fully-stocked upstairs bar)\n- roll-up doors on the restaurant side for quasi-outdoor seating\n\nWhy you wouldn't go:\n- with a larger group (more than 4 people)\n- seeking a quiet evening spot for kids (afternoons are fine for kids)\n- unwilling to pay the premium for micro / craft / import brews\n- unable to parallel park\n\nOverall impression:\nTerriffic neighborhood place for a small group to grab some terribly unhealthy food and try some new beers.",5
1582,"good selection of beers*, but the food is appalling. sysco-truk curly fries and run-of-the-mill hotdogs that don't even have natural casings. puh-leez. if you're gonna put \""dogz\"" in the name of your restaurant at least try to serve something better than what you can get on sale at giant eagle. \n\nno joke: I prefer the O. their fries are made out of potatoes and their dogs have real casings. \n\n* and by \""good\"" I mean \""good for PA\"" where liquor laws are an absurd kafkaesque mess and a lindeman's geuze is about as interesting as it gets (for like $15, natch)",2
1583,"This is our favorite neighborhood restaurant. They serve \""bar food\"", but there's a nice variety of vegetarian and non-vegetarian food. My favorite items on the menu are the veggie dogs, pizza, and soft pretzels. \n\nYou can't beat their beer selection. Make sure to visit the beer cave while you are there and their section of take-out beer for an even larger selection.",5
1584,"I'm over it. \n\nToo many instances of bad service. Though that one woman who I have seen working there for a long time is solid. But going back to what I started with; seems like the inmates are running the prison these days. \n\nThe beer to-go costs more here than it does in New York City or Brooklyn. Think about that people.\n\n(The Monroeville location is better, imo.)",2
1585,"I think their beer selection is much more impressive than their hot dog selection. although, mac and cheese on a hot dog is a pretty amazing option. but really, come for the beer cave and you won't be disappointed.",3
1586,"Everybody told me about this place when I said I was moving to Pittsburgh and, sure enough, it is awesome.  All the Belgian beer a girl could want.  And the wings.  And oh, the Mason Dixon dog.",5
1587,"I go to D's almost every Wednesday night for a beer and a veggie dog after an hour of bouldering at the Wall.\n\nTheir beer selection changes often, and I've never been disappointed.  If I don't know what the beer is, they'll often bring over a sample to try to make sure I like it.\n\nThe veggie dogs are great, the cheese fries are great, and I've never had a problem with the service.   It can get crowded when a game is on, but just grab a beer and wait for a table.\n\nPros: Fun menu, great draft beer selection, beer cave!\nCons: Sometimes crowded and loud",5
1588,"Awesome. That is D's.\n\nBurgers, dogs, and fries are so done, right? Wrong. Excellent toppings, excellent food, excellent beer selection. The fries and vegetarian selections are well done, so no one feels left out.\n\nI didn't know about this place until I started getting into trying odd micro-brews and I was looking for some different beers I had while living abroad. The beer cave is an experience and you will not be letdown. I have yet to meet someone who feels that D's is anything less than stellar.\n\nSidenote: I highly recommend D's Sixpax for someone's 21st birthday to pick out a six-pack from their epic selection of brews. (Also, buy them a hot dog, cheapskate!)",5
1589,"A day after the St. Patty's day libations the only thing I'm craving is some greasy junk food. Regent square hits the spot with some chili cheese fries straight from D's. Normally I enjoy fishing around the plentiful selection of booze. A hair of the dog was not gonna happen that hangover Sunday. I stuck to shoveling high calorie food into my gullet instead.\n\nThe last time I was here I selected from the hot dog menu, and they weren't that great. How can you mess up a frank you may be wondering?  I can only guess that it's the dogs themselves or the way they are prepared. They're kinda chewy. Dormont dogs rallies but the best Dog I've had was at Dirty Franks in Cbus OH. The chili cheese fries are good though. So today I made sure to get my fries fix in and try a burger. This weekend I had burgers on the brain! My BF and I got the Balboa, the BBQ Texas, and two dogs, mac n' cheese and Mason Dixon with with cheese.\n\nThe burgers had really delish toppings but the meat was so dry. It was overcooked and did not have one bit of juicyness dripping down my hand. Missing that major component they were truly lackluster. The macaroni dog wasn't that great either. Mac n' cheese should be creamy, salty, buttery. So sorry but this weenie came up flat too. I did like the Mason Dixon! The crunchy-ness of the coleslaw made a huge difference but the meat was still chewy and too salty. Could it be that I am too picky when it comes to my meat? If I am shopping for picnic eats I do go for Smith hot dogs WITH the casing or the large sized Hebrew Nationals. Now those are the mouthwatering crowd pleasers I'm talkin' about!",3
1590,"This place is one of the reasons we decided to move to Regent Square. I am not really a huge hot dog fan, but the BEER CAVE and FRIES keep me coming back (not to mention that it is walking distance from our house). We lived in San Francisco for several years, and this place also reminds us a bit of some of our old haunts in the Mission. :)\n\nIn the summer, they open up the garage style windows, so this is a perfect spot to sit, sip beer (skip the wine though-- its not great) and work on your laptop or newspaper. If you are not into sports and just wanna chill, D's has two sides, so you don't have to feel outnumbered by screaming Steelers fans.  D's always has a nice mix of people as well- from young couples with kids, students, hipsters, to elderly folks. The staff is really nice and friendly and the large mural of local Pittsburgh celebs is pretty neat as well!\n\nYeah, this place is one of the best, laid back spots here.  I am in love with the FRIES! I know I said this once, but they seriously do something very special to them that I cannot figure out.",4
1591,"Sometimes I get these intense cravings to stuff hot dogs and greasy french fries in my face. As someone who doesn't eat meat, the hot dog part of that is a rare occurrence. Thankful D's gives the option for veggie dogs. This makes me very happy. It also makes my hangovers happy too.\n\nNot to mention they have an absolutely spectacular selection of bottles and drafts. If I'm not here enjoying the little pleasures in life - such as fat, grease, and gluttony- I'm enjoying another sinful pleasure, booze. Every time I come here I'm overwhelmed with choices. \n\nThis place is magical.",5
1592,This place is pretty good! they serve a selection of creatively topped dogs and some of the best greasy fries I have had in awhile. enough said!  Time to go drink some beer and devour this dog!,4
1593,"D's has so many great things about it, it's hard to pick which one's the best. The whole atmosphere of the place is great, very laid back and everyone there is always enjoying themselves.\n\nObviously, the beer selection is great. I don't know how many different brews they typically have on hand, but it's a lot.  And you're encouraged to go pick out your own beer from the walk-in cooler, even if you're sitting at the bar.  The staff there is always friendly and you can sample some of the beers on tap if you're unsure of what you want.\n\nThe food is pretty good too.  The dogs can be simple or loaded with all kinds of toppings, and are a staple of D's.  They also have a good selection on the rest of their menu too.  Chili cheese fries - great.\n\nIf you haven't been there yet, stop by in the afternoon on a Saturday or Sunday for a great local vibe.",4
1594,Beer cave!!,5
1595,"I go here a lot.  I think most folks who live in Regent Square/Swissvale/Edgewood area do too.  And it's probably not because the food is so utterly delicious.  It's because it's a groovy little place with young hipster (and some not so hipster) bartenders and waitresses that serves up an endless array of beers in a funky loud space.  I love Regent Square and always saw the potential for the grand old days of Hippy Free Love lying dormant in her quaint shops and family eateries ... until D's sprang to life in a former dry cleaner/gun shop space.  Oh yes, how the times have changed and we are all so thankful for it.  Big KUDOS to the D's Empire in Regent Square -- the Beer Distributor, D's Six Packs and Dogs, and the newest entrant Cibo!  Well done!  Stop on in for a nice hot pizza (I loved the Frickin Parker with meat balls and hot peppers but alas, it has been banished to the basement beer dungeon for-evah!) or a mediocre hotdog and languish in the beer heaven known simply as D's. They also have a smoky dark strange but intriguing (if you've had enough beer downstairs) bar upstairs now that serves alcohol.",4
1596,"D's quite possibly has the best beer selection in Pittsburgh. There are always 20 micro brews on tap and they rotate seasonally. Last time I went they had a variety of pumpkin beers and I pretty much tried them all to figure out which I liked best. If you aren't feeling any of the beers on tap then take a stroll to the walk in cooler in the back and take your pick of hundreds of bottles. Bring the one you like back to the bar and the bartender will open it for you and bring you a glass. \n\nThe bartenders are really chill, and though the service isn't overly attentive, it is perfect for the vibe of D's. And speaking of the vibe, D's has this old pub style feel with the walls meeting at strange angles making cool little nooks and crannies where you can sit and sip your beer with friends or maybe just read a book.\n\nD's is also known for their hot dogs, and while good and inventive, in my opinion are a little overpriced. For some reason I have trouble spending $5 for a hot dog. I've tried their wings and fries too, both good standard bar food, but again a tad overpriced. My friend and I drank beers (a good amount) and ordered food and our tab was $100.\n\nD's still remains the gem of Regent Square and is worth the pilgrimage to Beer Mecca if you have never been.",4
1597,"Obviously the great rep of this place is their beer selection.  A lot of bottles.  Decent tap selection, though you are guaranteed to have a rather lopsided selection among the taps.\n\nFood is fair; I've yet to go there with others and have our whole meal come out at once.  Salad will come first, then a couple of dogs, then fries.  If you are polite and civil and believe in not eating until everyone is served, well, let's just say that no one ever taught the manager, cooks or servers here that lesson.\n\nNow, their service:  Really lackluster.  \""Entitled\"" is the word I would use.  It pains me to give them 15%, because honestly, they don't earn it, even when I was a regular and knew some of them by name. Meh.",2
1598,"I'm a vegetarian and everything, but man, sometimes all you want is a hot dog.  And you can get this at D's.  Every hot dog or hamburger on their menu can be ordered vegetarian, which is both awesome and rare.  I ordered the Chihuahua (with avocado, cheddar cheese, salsa, and jalapenos) and my table split an order of fries.  SO GOOD.  Almost too good.\n\nAnd you have to take a stroll around the beer cave.  It's not quite as impressive as I was hoping, but definitely worth the splurge to make your own 6-pack.  Last time I was in, I was able to purchase a 6-pack of porters - Anchor, Road Dog, Saranac caramel, Duck-Rabbit, Old Leghumper, and something else I can't remember - for a friend.  I'll definitely go back.",3
1599,"Sometimes the service here is hit or miss...they can get pretty busy. It can also get pretty crowded. But the food is good and the atmosphere is fun and laid back. And can you beat a room filled with beer? Can you beat mix and match six packs? Nope. 35 cent wing night, yum. Crazy deep fried, bacon covered hot dogs, yum.\n\nI will say though that I could not go here while I was pregnant...you can smell the delicious beer in the air and the Beer Cave taunted me mercilessly with that which I could not indulge...sigh. That was a tough nine months.\n\nThings I don't like so much...tables too close together and too small. The macaroni and cheese is bland, although you can't ask much for two bucks. There is nothing on their website right now other than the menu. Servers can be a bit brusque or forgetful and not refill your drinks without asking, but it kind of goes with the atmosphere I suppose.\n\nAll in all as a Regent Square resident this is our go-to place to hang out and bring friends and visitors.",4
1600,"I am not huge on hot dogs or beer. However, I am huge on add-ons. This is where D's comes in. I totally recommend the chihuahua hot dog. It has avocado!!! The wings are delish too. This place is a must go for beer lovers. I am still the light and sweet kinda beer person, so I tried something with raspberry notes in it, and LOVED it! Oh and the fries are awe-frickin-some!! My second fave in the city after Point Brugge.",4
1601,I have been to Pittsburgh several times in the last year and this place is one of my favorites.  Not just because the hot dogs are good and variety or them is pretty good too.  I come just for the beer cave!  Plenty of choice in there and the ability to pick your own is awesome!  It gets pretty packed in there on weekends.  Service is no nonsense.  Best is the beer selection in the cave.  This is the reason for the 4stars.,4
1602,"D's looks unassuming, but it's really over the top. Sure, they have fries, but why not order fries with bacon and cheese on them, plus ranch dressing on the side (You should, by the way - those are the pub fries and they are delicious). You could order a plain hot dog, but why do that when you have a choice of five different kinds of frank, and toppings like the Chihuahua: avocado, salsa, cheese and jalapeno? Plus, your dog (even if it's a turkey dog like mine) might arrive at the table with a little char on it; that to me is the peak of hot dog flavor.\n\nI feel like a restaurant that serves cheese sauce like a food group should have a warning label on the door, but with their sense of humor, the label would say \""Warning: the food inside is damn delicious and best consumed with a great beer.\""",5
1603,"Something different here.\n\nFood, schmood, go there and drink the beers from the beer cave.  I don't think you have to wait for the server to open your beer, they'll notice and charge your accordingly.  It's all walk in and self service beer, why don't more places do that?!\n\nMike",4
1604,"My husband and I live walking distance to D's and we do love D's... but the place is always so crowded and noisy, that I can't give it more than 3 stars.  \n\nI can't add much in the way of reviews here as to the food here, I think everyone has pretty much hit the nail on the head. The dogs are good, and I am happy they have veggie dogs. Beer selection is amazing.\n\nIt's very family friendly, so if that's what you are looking for this is the place for you. Personally, I work with children all day  & love them to death, don't get me wrong... but I find parents here tend to let their children act out a lot, and I find it really distracting and not relaxing. Since I am with children all day, I like my meals to not involve yelling and running children. So to solve that problem, we just order take out and eat our dogs at home!",3
1605,D's is just one of those places I love going to. I can't get enough of picking out my own 6 pack of wonderfulness. All amazing beer. The food has never let me down. The service has always been good. This place is just awesome.,5
1606,"The mac n cheese dog I had was just ok, but the Mason Dixon with its slaw and chili was killer. The fries and barbeque wings were just as good. I also liked the atmosphere, the mural, and the employees who were really nice and honest and helpful. It's in a cool neighborhood too. Go!",4
1607,Yum! Great little find just outside of the city....especially if you are Chicago dog fan,4
1608,"UPDATE: July 2013\n\nWent back for a visit to the alma mater and decided to stop in at D's before heading out. I have updates on the gluten-free beer situation and the nacho situation.\n\nGF Beer: MUCH improved from what I remember. They had at least three varieties of the \""deglutenized\"" beers - Estrella Damm Daura and both the Amber and Blonde Brunehaut (from Belgium!). They MAY have had Omission as well. \nThey also have at least three varieties of New Planet, and at least two of Greens. Dogfish Head T'weasonale. Possibly New Grist and Tread Lightly? I was in a haze of deliciously non-gluteny beer at this point. \n\nNachos: Maybe I'm recalling incorrectly, but I think when I've had these in the past they are made with real cheese - you know, shredded and melted. This time they were served with that nasty-ass liquid cheese goop, like you get at a ballpark. Blegh. \n\nStill four stars overall! Avoid the nachos though.\n\n---\n\nThe only food I've ever had here is nachos, so I can't speak to that. I WILL speak to the beer selection, though! I've managed to collect quite an assortment of beer snob friends, who love spending hours (literally) in the Cave o' Beer. I have to eat gluten free, so most ordinary beers are off-limits for me, BUT, they have an enormous selection of hard cider! Many many different kinds, including my favorite cider in the whole world, JK Scrumpy. Totally reasonable prices, too.\n\nNow the bad:\n1. They close at midnight! After the downstairs closes you can take your drink upstairs to a little bar, but it's super loud, has no seating, and you don't have access to the magical treasure trove of beer. Boooo.\n2. This is totally a niche thing, but I wish they had a better selection of gluten-free beers. There are lots of tasty ones out there, but they often only have Bards and Redbridge.",4
1609,"Generally, I like D's I. The restaurant itself has a cozy feel to it, and their large beer cave is one of the few places where I can get some of my favorite import beer.  Note, the Czechs make more than just Pilsner Urquell. Je to pravda! Most of the staff are very friendly, and the managers are always quick to help if you need assistance.  \n\nSome of you may get angry with me, but I simply cannot review D's I without comparatively rating it against its sister restaurant, D's II in Monroeville.  And no, I couldn't possibly care less that the latter is in an old Pizza Hut.  That's right, I prefer D's II to D's I. Hear me out.  \n\nFirst of all, D's I' drafts are all about a dollar more expensive than those in the suburbs.  Why the upcharge? \n\nAlso, after being spoiled by the very large menu selection at D's II, I'm always a little disappointed when dining at Regent Square.  No wraps, no steak salad, no variety of sandwiches.  I will say that the food they do serve is good.  I enjoy their pizza and their daily hummus offering.  \n\nD's I has a much smaller draft selection and lacks a full bar.  Fine.  It's a smaller location and it stays true to its original \""beer bar\"" theme.  Sometimes, however, I like to mix it up.  And I can do that more easily at the Monroeville location.  Obviously, I's beer cave trumps II's beer... um... outcove? \n\nSo all of that warrants a four-star rating.  Why the three? Like its suburban counterpart, I'm docking a star for closing so early.  Even when there is a crowd, the staff closes at 11:00 (Su-W) or 12:00 (Th-Sat) on the DOT.  That's just not responding to demand!\n\nOverall, I don't dislike D's I.  Quite the contrary.  After all, three stars means \""A-OK.\""  But to me, D's Regent Square doesn't go beyond that.",3
1610,I like it. Veggie friendly too.,4
1611,Chicago dog was awesome. Great selection of craft beers on draft too!,4
1612,"I don't come here to eat much, I usually come for the beer cave. Best build-your-own six pack joint in the city!",5
1613,New menu! Check it out!,4
1614,"Was in town for a recent sporting event and read good things about Ds. A bit off the beaten path, but an easy bus ride from my Oakland hotel (and bus originates from Downtown, so should be easy ride from there, too).\n\nDs did not disappoint: creative craft beer list of 25+ taps, plus hundreds of bottles in the Beer Cave that you can have onsite or take to-go, and some of the best dogs I've ever had. Was there on a Friday, so got the Scorpion (cheddar jalapeno kielbasi) & fries deal for $5.50--excellent. Also tried the very good Ds Brat (cheesy bratwurst) & fries (same price), and they do a terrific version of the Chicago Dog. There are also 20+ toppings options if you want to DIY. Nice, friendly service from the guys behind the bar/in the kitchen made this a fine time.\n\nNext time I'm in PGH, Ds will be at the top of my list to visit. Can't wait to try their other dogs and whatever they have on tap (or in the Cave).\n\nP.S. There is also sit-down service in a room between the bar and Cave that seemed more family-friendly. I noticed several tables had pizzas and burgers, so I assume those are decent, too.",5
1615,Employees are awesome. Everyone is super friendly and they always have kick ass old school jams playing!,5
1616,"I tried to go here for the second time today.  I say tried because I sat at the bar for about 7 mins with 3 people walking around behind it and no one even acknowledging I was there.  I ended up going next door to The Map Room for lunch.\n\nThe first time I had gone I had a server come and take my order, a kitchen guy ran it out, and then no one ever came back for 45 mins.  I went to the counter for my check and thought that I wouldn't give it another go.  Well, you can't say I didn't try.\n\n I had the barbeque chicken pizza the first time and it wasn't bad, but its not a place I'd make my go to pizza place.",1
1617,"I'm subleasing an apt across the street and have been in a few times now.  Hot dogs are good and cheap but the burger options, although still good, are close to $10 each.  Nice draft selection but also pricy.  Their happy hour is $1 off drafts 4p-6p everyday, so that's still $4-5 for a beer.  I'll be back though.",4
1618,"While I'm not much of a beer fan, I appreciate that this place would appeal to both the beer snob and the casual drinker. Enormous selection of beers in the Cave as well as on tap. They have Arsenal Cider, which makes me very happy (although I wish they carried the Bone-Dry). \n\nThe hot dogs and fries are amazing. I had an Angry Tiki. It sounded like an odd combination - pineapple, hoisin sauce, and bacon on a hot dog - but it was delicious. The only thing I might change next time is asking for a side of Sriracha (would have put this hot dog over the top). \n\nIt's cheap, it's a good set-up for going with a group, and I will definitely take any of my beer-loving friends here.",4
1619,"Came here for lunch after a long day on the road\n\nIt's a beer and bar place.\n\nThey have a variety of beer, they have a room all the way in the back with lots of different beer and a separate room displaying other kinds of beer.  They also have outdoor seating.  It's like 2 shops next to each other separated by a hall way.  I didn't even know there was a spot next door until I went to the restroom.\n\nThe fries are good.\nThey offer pizza and other goodies too.\nThey have many types of different types of dogs.  I had the veggie red alert which is spicy.  They have 3 kinds of hot dogs so it caters even to the vegetarian.  Regular dog, beef dog and veggie dog.  You have unlimited toppings - mushrooms, onions, creamy avocado etc.  The dog came in this little boat sized paper tray.  I find it very hard to eat because all of the toppings would fall off to the table, but they do have paper towels for you to put underneath if you want to do this so you can eat whatever falls off.  The veggie dog tasted like the real thing.  They also have dogs of the day.  \nQuite an interesting place but worth the visit in a little town.",4
1620,"D'z is hands down my favorite go to spot for good eats. I love their wings and their hot dogs. \nEverytime I go there i am greeted with fun young employees ready to serve or offer suggestions about their latest brews. Their draft list changes constantly so there's no sense in trying to remember which beer you had there the week before. Plus their beer cave is great with hundreds of different bottles to choose from all listed by the region from which they came. They also have a small cooler with about 150 different varieties of beer that are already chilled for your liking. Even if you get a warm beer, they have this ice cold dunk tank to put your bottle in that gets it nice and chilly for you in just a few minutes. That by far is my favorite aspect of D'z. If you choose to take beer home with you they also have a discount of $1.00 per bottle of every beer you take with you(excluding the pre-made six packs). So sometimes we get a six pack of variety beers at a lower cost than paying for them individually. On to the food:\n\nI love their wings and hot dogs and my masterful veggie burger creation. We always order the BBQ sauce because it taste so gooooood and their wings are nice and crispy and hot and smothered in plenty of sauce that you will be licking your fingers. We've tried almost all their dogs expect 2 and my favorite is the mac and cheese dog(w/ ketchup) and the chihuahua dog which is avocado, shredded cheddar cheese and jalapenos, my fiance enjoys a classic Chicago dog. The have delicious sauerkraut that i enjoy as well so i usually get a side for only 99 cents. Can't beat that price. Now when it comes to the veggie burger i love the way it taste. I do it up real nice by getting that black n blue topping which is blue cheese and cajun seasoning. I add bacon, onion, mushrooms, avocado, tomato, lettuce and their spicy mayo/double dip sauce. It is hands down the best burger i've ordered in a loooong time. \n\nIf your looking for a fun hangout spot for you and your buddies or even a tasty treat for the kids then D'z is where it's at!!! It gives you the feeling of just a fun place to be on the weekend or even the weekdays. \n\nDue to an unfortunate circumstance of eating at a different hotdog shop during restaurant week, my fiance would have proposed to me at D'z. We truly regret not waiting to go here but time was of the essence. D'z you truly are my favorite spot to be any day at any time and you will always be the place i wish i would have been proposed to at!!!!!!!!!!",5
1621,"Went here after a run in nearby Frick Park, which I felt gave me license to have a (delicious) hot dog washed down with a few great beers. I can't wait to return!",5
1622,"Last night was my first time at D's. The beer cave was amazing! I'm not a fan of beer but can appreciate a vast selection. I went straight for the cider. The lively energy of this place was incontestable. No frills, down-to-earth place where you can kick it back with a beer (or in my case a cider) and enjoy company with friends. It was a perfect ending to our movie night at the Regent Square Theater. With smiles planted on our faces after watching a dark comedy, going to D's only extended our happy mood. Before leaving I went back to the beer cave for more cider. Good stuff, good stuff!",4
1623,"The food is always sort of room temperature, but it's delicious! \nThere's a cave. Of beer. \nThere's always a longish wait to get a seat, but I can say, they do their best to accommodate. My first time here, we had a large group and failed to call ahead, yet they found somewhere to put us and took good care. \nThis area of town is adorable, and I'm looking forward to heading out in the spring time and enjoying some hot dogs in the warm air!",3
1624,"Was at D's this afternoon! I was so excited to find real vienna Hot Dogs in Pittsburgh since I am a born and raised Chicago guy. They were good dogs, had mine Chicago Style of course! Not sure it was Pollmans Mustard. It the buns had poppy seeds! A great place with plenty of atmosphere!",5
1625,"I am a fan of this place.  I love the dogs, of course.  I love the beers, of course.  I love the Beer Cave the most.  I'm not sure if it's the largest collection of bottles, but it's pretty impressive nonetheless.  I just wish that the beers I wanted had the prices labeled.  I swear, every one I grabbed for had price tags on the beers surrounding it but not on the one I wanted.\n\nAnyway, the dogs are tender and juicy.  Even the veggie dogs are pretty convincingly \""dog-like.\""  The fries are plentiful and pretty damn good.  Greasy and salty (but not too much of either) and a perfect accompaniment to beers and hot dogs.  The servers are friendly and helpful with the menu.\n\nPros: great beer selection, wonderful food, friendly staff\nCons: I was here after brunch to catch the hockey game and they had NCAA basketball on instead; not a big deal, but enough to be annoying",4
1626,"D's is one of our favorite places in Pittsburgh. It's nice to have an easy, fun, casual place to get some good eats and a nice beer. As a vegetarian who still likes to pretend to eat meat, I so appreciate their multiple veggie options. Nearly any item on the menu can be made in a vegetarian version. Their special dogs (dog of the month) are usually a lot of fun. My favorite was the Thanksgiving dog back in November, with corn, mashed potatoes, cranberry, and stuffing. It was amazing! I came twice to have one in November. \n\nTheir beer list has to be the best I've seen in the city. Lots of great stuff on tap and a huge bottle room. \n\nSince we like to bring our toddler to dine with us, I'm always so happy that they are so friendly and accommodating with kids. He loves their mac and cheese and grilled cheese sandwiches, though I think he likes their crayons more.\n\nFor a fun family dinner, a good beer, watching a game, getting together with friends, or just experimenting with a new Belgian brew, I strongly recommend D's.",5
1627,"D's has been hovering among my Pittsburgh bookmarks for a couple of years now, so I was happy to finally stop by for a visit and late lunch recently. After squeezing into a parallel parking spot out front, I had two things on my mind when walking in here: hotdogs and beer, both of which they have down pat.\n\nSince it was mid-afternoon, few tables were filled, but the front patio was open to allow in some fresh air during the nice day. I first looked around at their extensive beer selections; \""six pax\"" in the rear \""Beer Cave\"" and individual bottles in the middle cooler. I found something to my liking and grabbed a high table and menu.\n\nA \""Big Ben\"" dog sounded appetizing (and mildly appropriate), but I ended up going with the \""Mason Dixon\"" topped with chili and coleslaw. Knowing that one dog would not be enough, I also went with a small order of their \""Pub Fries\"" covered in cheese and bacon. (Forgive me Father, for I have no restraint.)\n\nHoly Moley! Both the dog and fries were excellent and down right tasty. Thank God because my satisfied stomach was smacking down the guilty part of my brain that was subconsciously calculating the summation of calories shared between the meal and two bottles of liquid refreshment.\n\nOh well. I definitely heart D's, even if my heart now hates me in return. 4.5 Stars.",4
1628,"\""Meh\"" is kind of how I felt about this place, which I realize is an opinion that seems to go against the grain. I had heard about D's time and time again. Everyone talked about it like it was the greatest place in existence. I had such high expectations! \n\nI suppose maybe I was expecting too much, which led to some disappointment. A few friends and I went here on a Friday night and it was (predictably) packed. We were fairly lucky to get a table almost right away. \n\nI obviously had to acknowledge that the beer selection is impressive. If you can't find it here, you probably can't find it anywhere in Pittsburgh. I had to check out the famous \""Beer Cave\"" which seemed to have just about everything. I think I'll make it a point to pick up some brews here next time I'm looking for something unusual or new.\n\nI wish I had more to say, but I just wasn't feeling it. My friends love it so I'm sure I'll be back, and next time I'll make it a point to try the food. Judging by some of the other reviews, that might change my perception of the place.",3
1629,"D's is a great place to drink to your heart's content with any darn beer you please! They have just about any beer your little mug could possibly conjure up. The service is quick, not overly friendly but they get the job done- what you expect from a pub type atmosphere.  A great after-work unwind.",4
1630,Mac n cheese dog is incredible.  This place is small and gets packed so be prepared for a long wait and no personal space.,5
1631,"I absolutely loved this place. First off, I love Regent Square. It's the cutest place, and this is the perfect place for a night out or even to get beer for a night in. My boyfriend is obsessed with the create your own six pack from the beer cave. We ate here on a friday and the place was packed but we got sat right away and our food came out fast. Amazing specialty hummus of the day ( i think it was chipotle ranch) and great sandwiches. The portions are huge and you won't leave hungry.",5
1632,"I love D's! My roommate and I are happy regulars at both the restaurant and the attached beer cave, and we like to drag our out-of-town friends here as well. This place is honestly one of the best things about living in Regent Square. The staff are friendly and efficient and the food is always hot and fresh. The beer is of course outstanding. What more could you want in a neighborhood bar?",5
1633,"While awaiting the arrival of your wedding dress, you should feel excitement and joy, not desparation and hopelessness.  The delivery date was \""pushed back\"" many times until it finally came in over 3 months after they said it would, and gave me the run-around throughout the entire process.  I didn't think my dress was coming at all to be perfectly honest.  I had un-returned phone calls and was lied to by Donetta, the owner.  Janie was the consultant I worked with the most and she was always pleasant and helpful; however, the store overall struggles and I would never go back.  If you are shopping for a wedding dress run far far away from this place.  Seriously, take my word for it.  I ordered my dress well in advance and no one should go through what I went through wondering when you were going to get a straight answer and if your dress was ever going to come.  I have read many negative reviews for this place and still gave them the benefit of the doubt. Shame on me.  Check out the Better Business Bureau (BBB).  Brides by Candalina is rated an F.  They have unresolved isssues with customers and unfortunately they really don't care. Shopping for a wedding dress should be one of the most exciting times of your life, not a nightmare.  There are many other bridal shops-avoid this one.",1
1634,"I went to pick up my wife's bridesmaid dress (she was the maid of honor) on a very boring Wednesday afternoon around 12:30. From the outside the place looks like a bomb shelter with dresses in the window.\n\nThe show room is upstairs, but you would never know it from the drab, basement-like entrance. As I walked up the stairs I notices ZERO customers in the store, however; two employees were working on the sales floor. I stood there like a jerk for a bit while both employees (one was the owner) kept to themselves. The owner did not respond to me for, at least, 10 minutes even though the store was empty and another employee was just walking around \""dusting\"" (the store smalls like the inside of a mascot costume).\n\nWhen the owner, finally, saw me she made a little annoying noise like \""What the hell are YOU doing here!!\"". She walked over slowly, like a zombie looking for fresh brains and giving a crap why I was there. She asked me to follow her as she took me downstairs to an absolutely empty storeroom (by that I mean: what was she doing that was was so important that she couldn't wait on a customer) and took her sweet-ass time to get the dress which, by the way, was a second alteration. You see, they screwed up the first time they altered the dress (even after my wife tried it on there and markings or whatever were made!). So everyone is entitled to a mistake even a business that claims perfection; it's important to give them a chance to redeem themselves. But, to my surprise, she handed me a bill for the second alteration!!!!!! Are you kidding me?!!!\n\nI argued a bit, but then gave in; what was I supposed to do? We were leaving to go 200 miles away the next day for the wedding. So I paid. Do not go here ladies!\n\nOh, if you think I'm exaggerating, feel free to Google this company and read the many reviews that make mine look like a compliment. If you have ever needed a dress for a wedding or YOUR wedding, these reviews will scare you!",1
1635,"I was pleased that Candalina Bide ordered my gown as a rush and it did arrive in time for the wedding.  The downside:  the alterations were very expensive and very poorly done.  The hem looked as if a high student just learning to sew had done it and I had to make some repairs and press the hem once I got it home.  The alterations to the bodicve were incomplete and i ended up with a poor fit and lots of excess materialright across the bust.  I would order from them again, but definitely take my dress to a professional seamstress.",2
1636,"Last Friday I dropped off my best interview suit at Regency Cleaners and verified that I needed it back by Monday because of an interview on Wednesday. They assured me I could pick it up on Monday morning. \n\nMonday afternoon I stopped by and was told the suit wouldn't be there until 5:00PM. When I insisted that I had been told morning, she went into the back and came out with what I first thought was the suit but turned out to be only the jacket. She told me to come back after 5:00PM. When I asked to speak with the manager, she informed me that she was the only person there. I asked her to have the manager call me - she said the manager wouldn't answer the phone and reiterated the 5:00PM time when the last delivery came and petulantly informed me that none of this was her fault.\n\nAt 5:30PM I called and was told that the last delivery hadn't come yet and I'd have to call later. I again asked them to have the manager call me and she told me she couldn't give me the manager's phone number - which I hadn't asked for. I was again told this wasn't her fault. As of 7:00PM, the delivery finally arrived but not my pants.\n\nI was told the manager would call me after she arrived in the morning. I finally called at 9:00AM and was criticized by the manager for demanding her home phone number and told that there was never any guarantee about when clothes would be returned even when a rush was placed on them. \n\nApparently a *lot* of clothes were missing from the Monday delivery so I wasn't the only person upset about this situation.\n\nWhen I told them they'd lost my business for good, I was told that was fine and hung up on, forcing me to call again to find out exactly *when* I might be able to expect my missing pants.\n\nAt this point I'm still waiting and will be for the next three hours. In the meantime, I have to go out and try to find a suit that I can afford as a replacement just in case. \n\nI absolutely cannot recommend Regency Cleaners. They leave high school kids with no customer service experience or training in charge of the store with no manager available for unexpected situations. And there is no guarantee about when or if your clothes will ever come back.\n\nThis was my first and last time dealing with them.",1
1637,"Worst dry cleaners EVER.  \n\nNot only do they do an incredibly poor job on the clothes, but the staff are particularly nasty and rude.  The kids who work there are fine, but the older ladies are just plain miserable.  I would rather spend more money someplace else than go back to this hell hole.",1
1638,"I only got a tear in my sweater sewn together, but my experience was far from pleasant, even expecting nothing special when I walked into the place.  \n\nI went to the dry cleaner out of convenience as I live right in Regent Square.  I took my sweater to the dry cleaner on 2/19/2013 for a tear in the seem, and they told me it would not be available for pickup on 2/25/2013 after 5:00PM.... almost a week later.  What? \n\nAlso, the staff was fairly rude and all had chips on their shoulders.  I'm not entirely sure how their cleaning/sewing process works, but it's slow as molasses and I don't have time for that.  Their lack of urgency coupled with their lack of customer service or even cracking a smile means I will never go back to this dry cleaner.",2
1639,I just moved to the neighborhood and needed to find a dry cleaner close by. Regency Cleaners is fine for dry cleaning but do not entrust any tailoring or hemming to this place! I had the sleeves of my coat hemmed and the tailor (or whoever) did a shitty job (THANKS).\n\nThe owner (larger woman) is rude and dismissive of my questions.\n\nI won't be coming here again.,2
1640,"Fun bar, but if you aren't a smoker be prepared for your eyes to burn and your clothes to stink like cigarettes when you leave!\n\nThe usual Miller, Coors, Bud beers are cheap. No food. Just drinks.",3
1641,"There's a reason why there are only two reviews currently for this place. Maybe it's that spending thirty minutes in the main bar area will make you spontaneously asphyxiate.  They seriously need to invest in an air purifier.  The bar itself is a huge space, though very few will ever make it into the back room.  It's essentially a dead zone.  There's a fancy back bar that remains closed so that two bartenders can roost on top of each other like Master/Blaster in Beyond Thunderdome and watch TV.  This kind of forces patrons to hover near the front.  So, uh, invest in a second TV, a nice coat of paint, maybe some dimmer light bulbs.  You know, gussy yourself up a bit Murphy's.  It will make you feel more confident.  Who doesn't want a new coat of paint? Huh? HUH? The reason that this place is a two, is that it has an unbelievable amount of potential that's just squandered.",2
1642,"For what it is, this place does the job. Cheap, powerful drinks without any distractions such as...dinner. There is a list of available wines posted outside the front door, but why on earth would you come here for wine? It's a beers-and-booze place all the way. \n\nAt 8pm on a Friday night, the front room was perhaps a quarter full. The bartender was friendly and the service was snappy, but I can't picture this being a regular destination. The air is thick with cigarette smoke, and the decor grim and dingy, with more light coming from the TV than from the overheads. I guess what I'm saying is, it's exactly what I picture an OTB from the early 80s to have been like.\n\nVerdict: if you want a quick drink (and I mean \""drink,\"" not \""cocktail\""), it's a bargain. Recommended for time travelers, day boozers, and folks who hate HVAC.",3
1643,"Yeah it's dirty and smoky, but so what? It's got cheap beer and is an ok spot for a quiet pint. The front bar feels a bit grotty but the back is big and it's fine to hang out in. Nothing special but not terrible either.",3
1644,"I have been in this bar many times with a friend of mine (who has been a patron for decades) and I thought the owners were really nice people but now I wonder.  My friend is now confined to a wheelchair and still likes to frequent this bar, however, there are a couple of steps that lead into the back rooms where there are pool tables, dart boards, etc.  She cannot get to this area and has a ramp that she would give to the owners so she can access this area.  They refuse to put in the ramp.  I thought all public businesses had to comply with the Americans With Disabilities Act as long as it does not create an undue hardship.  Tell me, how is putting down a ramp that is given to you for free a hardship!  SHAME ON YOU CATHY!",1
1645,"Let me start off by saying, I HATE the dentist.  It is my worst fear.  I came to Edgewood Dental after stellar reviews.. and let me tell you my first impression was amazing.  They were professional, so nice, easily scheduled me in and numbed me so much that I didn't feel a thing.  Although I had 7 cavities filled (my teeth are horrible) I felt good that they did a good job.  Flash forward 3 months later, I received a bill in the mail because my insurance downgraded and no longer covered white fillings.  First, I was very upset that I was never told of this downgrade.  I was given an estimate and paid on time in full - not sure when this changed or why I was never told by the office or insurance company.  Regardless, I called over 5 times to discuss a payment plan with the office.  When I first emailed them, I was told I could choose the amount with which I wanted to pay to cover the amount owed.  Then, I was told my amount was too low and would get a call back.  NEVER HEARD FROM THEM AGAIN.  I was very upset.  I emailed, and called so many times.  Meanwhile, I have always paid everything on time and as an upstanding person would never not pay a bill.  I have been sending them checks and they are cashing them and just not even saying a word.  Jerks.",1
1646,"Dunning's Grill is another one of those solid neighborhood joints.  Nothing on the menu here'll surprise you, but you'll get good chow for your buck here.  We're taling standard bar fare here--burgers, wraps, fish sandwiches, and variations of fried and grilled chicken.  \n\nIt's a good place to meet up with your friends before or after a movie at the nearby Regent's Square as I did.  I had the BLT which was as good as any other BLT I've had at least a dozen other places.  They have vegetarian options here but if you're a true vegetarian or vegan be forewarned!  They're really meatless variations of their regular menu items.",3
1647,"Yeah, not impressed. We ordered the fried zucchini to start. It's great that it's freshly hand battered, but they seem to have forgotten something -- the FLAVOR. This stuff had no seasoning on it at all, so we have to pour on a generous helping of salt to get it to taste like anything. And for $8 that's disappointing.\n\nWe each ordered burgers. At $10 a pop I was expecting a nice juicy burger. What I got was dry and totally tasteless. The whole burger just tasted like nothing. Perhaps their salt shaker fell on the floor and rolled under the fridge or something tonight. It was accompanied by some typical frozen steak fries. Again NO SALT OR SEASONING. For a $40 night out I really shouldn't have to dump salt all over everything I order. \n\nThe service...meh. Our server was so meek I could barely hear her. Serving takes a bit of personality, no? When we asked what the happy hour specials were, she said \""Ummmmmmmmmmmmmmmm....it depends on the drink.\"" What? What does that mean? Basically it means you get a random discount on whatever you order, maybe, perhaps. There is no list, no standard \""$5.00 well drinks\"" or anything normal like that. It's basically \""order something and hope it's on our happy hour specials.\""\n\nRather disappointed. They need to either lower their prices or kick it up a notch on the food and service.",2
1648,"Dark, spacious, and neighborhood friendly is how I'd describe Dunnings, a fixture on Braddock Ave for years. \n\nI met my friend Jean here, she is a once a week customer. Lucky her living on Biddle Street, she lunches daily at different eateries on Braddock ave. One day the Square Cafe (read my review), one day the Map Room, another day D's Packs n Dogs. \n\nLooking over the menu, my choices were limited to a veggie wrap or salads. I chose a veggie wrap, sans cheese with a side of apple sauce. The wrap was nothing special, mushrooms, spinach, lettuce, tomato, and a side of canned applesauce.\n\nJean had a buffalo chicken wrap and iced tea. She complained the tea was weak, I never noticed. She said he wrap was good, a chicken breast fried, then drenched in buffalo chicken sauce, then drenched in blue cheese dressing and wrapped in a flour tortilla. \n\nDunnings is nothing special, it's a long time establishment that gets by on regulars. This day, the most I saw in the place was 9 people in the bar and dinning room. \n\nService was ok, out waitress seemed to be preoccupied with something or someone in the kitchen and it took forever for her to bring the bill to the table.",2
1649,"Ok, to ALL the hipsters and east end snobs... everything can't be oh so trendy and veganese.  I say that with love, as I have my foothold in the trendy hipster scene as well.   Dunnings is GREAT.  Great Pittsburgh fare at reasonable prices, since when did $10 become too much for a burger?  I highly recommend anything fried or on a bun from Dunnings, you will not be disappointed.   When it comes to the dinner selections, I think it just depends on the cook in the kitchen.  The service is friendly, the decor is old school but well maintained.   I just get so frustrated with a lot of these comments because it seems like a lot of the yelpers excpect gold dust when they spend upwards of $5.",3
1650,"It's got it's ups and downs.  It's got a reasonably attractive interior, antique tin ceilings, a broad selection of dozens of beers and a tasty looking menu featuring daily specials.  So why my low score?  D's at the other end of the block puts their beer collection to shame offering 1000 beers,  Both times I've eaten here the wait to be served has been extremely slow (at least 30 minutes and up) the prices are a bit high ($10-$15 for a lunch entree) and most importantly the food is in general heavy and bland.  This is not a terrible place, but with so many delicious spots nearby in regent square like the green mango, map room, d's and the square cafe you should keep on walking.  That said, if you wanted a quiet spot to grab a beer with a friend, you could definitely do worse, but skip the boring food.",2
1651,"Average food, slightly above average prices for the quality/taste, average price for the location, lack-luster service.\n\nThis place (the location, the actual building itself, etc.) could be so much more.  I wish they would either step it up, or sell the business to someone that would let it achieve its true potential.\n\nUntil then, there are other dining options in Regent Square and they should be explored.",2
1652,"My first visit was tonight, on wing night. I got barbecue wings and a side salad. My son got parmesan and garlic wings. Large meaty wings with flavorful coatings. I asked for ranch and blue cheese for dipping and both were delicious. The salad wasn't real special but it had a nice combination of greens. Waitress was friendly and efficient. Nice neighborhood feel. So glad my son brought me here. It was his 5th wing night visit on a row.",4
1653,"I live in the neighborhood and love to patron local establishments. However, Dunning's doesn't impress me. Kind of reminds me of an old timer, stuffy bar/restaurant. The food is ok. Typical and kind of boring. I think the prices are on the higher end for what they serve.",3
1654,"I really wanted to like this place, because it sounds like it used to be really popular. We heard the burgers were very good once upon a time, so we tried them, but they were just ok. Nice people though, and plenty of seating. Good place to watch the game probably (bar).",2
1655,"I haven't actually been to the Regent Square location of Ambience, so this is more directed towards the Oakmont store.\n\nI love this place. I love it. It's gorgeous, high-quality [sometimes designer!] clothing that's so cheap it's ludicrous. And! All the profits go to a women's shelter! What more can you ask of a consignment shop?\n\nI daresay nothing. Go, shop, support.",5
1656,"I decided to visit the reagent square location after reading the great reviews on here and i wasn't disappointed. Parking was relatively easy to get (Tuesday afternoon). The store is well organized not too overwhelming like most thrift/vintage stores. They carried alot of Jcrew, Ralph Lauren, Ann Taylor stuff...cashmere cardis, blazers blouses etc.  But they also carried a range of  high end stuff, i spotted 2 Oscar de la Renta sweaters, some St Johns blazers, a Prada bag. They also carry some vintage jewelry, scarves and handbags. \nIf you take the time to go through the racks you will definitely score some unique HIGH QUALITY , no funky smells goodies.As far as their prices i noticed that average price was 23-35 and the major designer stuff was between 60-100.They also have a sales rack at the back (was 75% off when i was there).  I knocked off one star because i thought the prices were abit higher than i'm used to in Denver (esp on the jewelry) \n I walked out with a vintage (60's) Pucci dress($88) in perfect condition and an Adrienne Vittadini sweater ($17).  All profits go to a women's shelter which means minimal buyers remorse...hell yess!!!",4
1657,"I am updating my review of the Oakmont store after my last experience consigning there. The store employee happily accepted all of my items- until the next day when I received a call that the owner rejected half of the items. This was the third time I consigned with Ambiance in Oakmont, and I only offered items that I thought were in excellent condition from high end retailers; even though I have seen brands in the store from Charter Club for example (Ambiance says they do not accept them in the consigning agreement). The employee was very apologetic and she said that she stood by her assessment that the items were of good quality, but the owner (who she seemed upset with) disagreed. So, get your stuff together Ambiance owner and either train your employees better, or only accept items yourself so that you do not inconvenience potential customers like me. Surprisingly, I did not receive the same return on this set of consigned items; not sure if that is coincidence or not.",2
1658,"Right, so......\n\nFirst off, hire employees that actually appreciate having a job.  Not ones that are there because they are forced to.  That way, maybe you can actually earn a decent review.  If you start off with a bad experience with an employee, you're not going to get a great review.\n\nI went here midday on a Sunday.  Thought that was a great idea, especially when I got there and there were no cars in the drive thru.  Pull up to the sign to order and wait for five minutes before I am even acknowledge that I am there.  Finally order and pull around, I wait another five minutes.  I could understand the wait if there was someone in front of me, or if the sit down area inside was packed, but there was no one else there but ME.\n\nI'd gladly tell y'all the employee's name, that is if where the name is suppose to be wasn't ripped off.  All I can really say is that she was a real ball of sunshine.  I was made to feel like I was interrupting her day and that I should have just went somewhere else to spend my money.\n\nYou know what really puts me in a tizzy (yes, I just used that word)?  Leaving the drive thru, driving the distance to my house, walking into my house, sitting down to feed my face and find that part of my order wasn't given to me.  *enter angry expletives here*\n\nI doubt I'll be revisiting this location again, I'll drive the further distance from my place the next time I'm craving a taco or two.",2
1659,The drive through service here leaves something to be desired.  Not only was my order wrong but the lady was very grumpy.,2
1660,This place continues to be a joke.  The service is bad and the attitude of the workers is worse.  \n\nMy order is never right and yet I still go...never again.  \n\nI officially deem this place the worst restaurant in Pittsburgh.,1
1661,Worst service.  Dirty.  Slow.  Ignorant by the strictest definition.  Do not go here.  Bad!  Real bad.,1
1662,"While the shop is in a pretty great location, with cute decor, they only accept cash (which is annoying), and the friendliness of the staff varies significantly, from awesome to terrible. I could deal with either--and have, given my love of coffee shops--but I guess I need consistency. I want to know what to expect, you know?\n\nTheir coffee is pretty good--not awesome, but certainly drinkable. Their pastries vary a bit, as well; that they offer carrot cake cupcakes is pretty cool, but I think something's wrong with their fridge, making things stale half the time.\n\nKind of meh.\n\n(Note on \""outdoor seating:\"" It's really no good unless you smoke, because there's one employee who spends half the day out there, smoking.)",2
1663,"I really want to see small coffee shops succeed, I do. Regent Square is full of small businesses and the community is really supportive. I believe this and the lack of coffee chains is the only reason they are still open. They are cash only, but so is half of all the other businesses on that street, so I don't hold it against them. \n\nIt's dingy. They don't use their space well. Coffee is brewed in poured into an regular old coffee pump pot. The desserts looked good, but there was one lonely cookie and two cupcakes (granted it was Saturday night). It just looked really sparse.",2
1664,"This is a depressing coffee shop. I went in on a wednesday afternoon to find the place dim, muggy, eerily silent (as in no music or talk, just shuffling noises), and filled with a sense of sadness.  I tried to sit down and enjoy some coffee, which was drinkable, but I couldn't get over the odd atmosphere, that is until the music started, so quiet I couldn't even tell you what it was, just that it was on. I'm giving it two stars for the awesome alternative energy posters hanging on the far wall.",2
1665,"Regent Square is a nice little area, and it certainly deserves a better coffee shop than Katerbean.\n\nWe just moved to Pittsburgh in July, and before we got the interwebs in our home, we would frequent Katerbean fairly regularly, at least 2 to 3 times per week in order to use their free wi-fi and have a drink.  Every time... EVERY TIME we went there, we left reeking of smoke.  There's no smoking inside, of course, but it always happened.  Maybe it's due to poor ventilation, or the fact that the employees were regularly outside smoking, but we always left smelling like we were in a bar.\n\nThen, the tables were usually dirty.  When we would order our drink, we would usually have to get ourselves a napkin, wet it, and wipe our table ourselves. Not surprising, as most of the employees I've encountered there (with the exception of the very nice older woman) seemed pretty put out when I asked for anything.\n\nIn any case, we have internet access at home now, and haven't been back to Katerbean since. I guess that is really the only thing this place has going for it.",2
1666,"Yeah, I agree with the general consensus of Katerbean. One of these days, I'm going to write an anonymous note that will include a copy of this review. I don't think that the owners mean any harm by leaving the wall painted sherbet orange, sans artwork, but may just need some guidance.\nYes, the place smells. A good carpet scrubbing would work, but tearing it up would be much better. The coffee is a step up from foldgers. The soy milk tastes like whole milk. Tables are often dirty.\nA little bit of interior design education, or change of management could make this place totally rock, especially with Root 176 and the Regent Theater right up the street. Regent Square is crying out for a good coffee shop! Could she be the one??? Hopefully someday? I am keeping my fingers (and toes) crossed!",2
1667,"Inattentive staff.  Dirty tables, I agree with the other reviews here.  I think the \""Manager\"" only hires other smokers, and they spend 90% of their time sitting outside smoking, instead of being prepared to serve customers.  \n\nI go there because sometimes it's convenient, b/c of the location, but last week they left their A/C broken for over a week (in 80+ degree weather).  No additional fans, nothing.\n\nThen when it was fixed, I went in, ordered coffee and an order of hummus/carrot/celery (prepackaged).  Not only was the hummus watery from sitting in that container for several days, but the celery was rotting at the ends, yes brown and rotting.  I showed the kid working there, who was probably jonesing to have his next cigarette, and I asked for another one.  Without opening it I could see at least 2-3 of the other servings of hummus were also all watery and had celery that was starting to rot, just like the one I was given.  I asked for my money back.  You know what was the worst thing, though?  The kid (he knows nothing about customer service let alone food service) put the containers with the watery, rotting celery back in the case, to serve to other unsuspecting customers!  Hello, Allegheny County Health Department?....\n\nThen the ultimate insult: 2 kids came in selling candy bars.  I've seen this there before, but this time, I said to them: \""You know, this is a business, you shouldn't be here.\""  Well, the older of the 2 girls (probably 11-12 at most - where is her mother?) put her hands on her hips and said in a smart-ass tone: \""We asked da owner, we is allowed ta be here.\""\n\nWell, that coffee I spent $2 on?  That is the last money I will spend in that place.  Disgusting.",1
1668,"I really want this place to be awesome, because, yet again, I want Regent Square to be an up and coming area.  This place has been here for years, and as I sit drinking my bitter, bitter coffee, and smelling the overwhelming scent of (I believe) dog pee, I wonder how it's even possible.  \n\nThe three times I've been here, I'm greeted as if I'm a colonial space marine trying to fish a child out of a vent.  They always sit in the corner peeking over the top of the counter as if I am terrifying to them, then duck out of the way.  Then grudgingly come when I peek around the counter at them.  If I didn't, I'm convinced that they would just sit there, as if they're not certain of what position they hold in this place, or what the next step should even be.  This is what I like to call, \""The Dance of Shitty Customer Service.\""  \n\nToday (and I write this longingly looking over at Square Cafe) I decided to give it a chance because it never is crowded, and I figured the quiet would be a good thing.  The girl at the counter was on the phone, and that's the way it stayed for two minutes until I said 'excuse me?'.  The charming reply: \""Yeah?\"" She grudgingly got off the phone, and after accomplishing the Herculean task of handing me a cup, I pumped this swill that I'm currently drinking.\n\nShe's currently muttering under her breath back in her corner.  I'm not sure if maybe she's having a bad day, or she's just an asshole, but...if I had to bet, I'm going with asshole.\n\nThis place has pretty expensive coffee for how awful it is, and the food...Just don't eat the food.  \n\n(side note: this place isn't quiet at all when somebody orders something.  She stomps around like she's being sent to her room.  Then continues muttering)\n\nOkay, so this place is a travesty.  Bad coffee, bad odor, bad lighting, unbelievably bad, grudging service.  I would beg the owners to put any effort into this place.  As it is now, it's cornered the market in Regent Square, and sits like a middle finger boastfully pointing at the people of Braddock Avenue.",1
1669,"Yeah, I'm not coming here anymore.\n\n1) They charge extra for whipped cream.\n2) They use canned whipped cream. If you're gonna charge me for whipped cream you damn well better make your own fresh whipped cream. Jeez.\n3) My hot chocolate was just gross. Like they use Hershey's chocolate syrup or something. Yuck.\n4) I saw how they keep their filters prefilled with ground coffee just sitting out on the counter to get stale! WTF?\n\nSigh. I hope the people at Biddle's Revenge open that place up soon and know WTF they are doing...",2
1670,"Is it possible to give zero stars?  If so, Katerbean would rate a zero.\n\nBad atmosphere, unfriendly employees, slow and reluctant service, pump your own coffee, dingy interior, dirty tables.  If they only had telescreens which couldn't be switched off, then this place would be a perfect setting to film Orwell's \""1984\"".",1
1671,"Cigarette smoke and ashtray smells combined with mediocre coffee and subpar customer service are not my cup of tea, and I never even rank the tea here. Thank the Flying Spaghetti Monster that Biddle's Escape opened and now I have absolutely no reason to go to Katerbean.",2
1672,This place is now closed :-). Best thing that could've been done with it.  Going to opn in a couple of months under new management as the 61B caf\u00e9. I look forward to seeing what some new life does to this place!,1
1673,"I don't know why you would go anywhere else. The fellow who runs this shop is what I think of as a traditional businessman. He's got a trade, is well known in the neighborhood, and asks a fair price. He does darn good work, too!\n\nI've gotten various shoes repaired over the last decade or so here, from leather to suede with lots of random requests in between. I think he may have even done my tap shoes way back when. One pair in particular he re-soled them 3 times. Man, I loved those shoes ... Anywho, the last time I had him patch the toes of my UGG boots (Don't judge. They are so comfy.) he charged me so little that I left him a big 'ole tip. \n\nBottom line: nice guy, great service. Support local business!",5
1674,I brought a shoe here that needed re-glued and it was done the next day and was so cheap.  The store owner was very friendly.  Would definitely do business here again.,5
1675,"Amazing...\n\nThe owner of this establishment is honest, fair and skilled.  I have a pair of leather boots that I had reconditioned at this establishment.  My boots went from bad to great.  Total cost, $7!  \n\n$7 \n\nInsane value.  Great place.  I am so pleased places like this exist.",5

1679,"Think fresh bread, fresh vegetables, daily sliced meats of the highest caliber served in white butcher paper by very slow service.  Ahhhh, the joys of ordering a torpedo (around six inches of bread) or a Battleship (fasten the hatches!) from the Triangle.  They make the best cold hoagies -- turkey, italian, and ham are among my favorites!  They also have a bar and TV's for that minimalist game viewing adventure with regulars from nearby homestead and braddock propping up the stools.  It's a great take out place -- call ahead though.  A Pittsburgh classic you must try once for a Steeler or Penguin game party.  Terrific!",5
1680,"Just go here, and order a battleship. If Kris makes it, its even better!",5
1681,"I have been a customer of the Triangle Bar & Grill for over twenty five years.  They have the BEST subs ever. \n\nBUT on this trip I was buying several to share with people from out of town.  They are cash only and more than happy to show you an ATM that charges you $2.50 per transaction.  The employees don't set the rules but have to live with them.  That $2.50 came out of their tip, they can hit up their boss for the rest.  Its 2014 and they still don't take credit and or debit cards.  Shame on them.",2
1682,"After 17 years of only being able to choose between three pizza chains, I really appreciate little places like this with good pizza.  The pepperoni pizzas are thin and greasy like they're supposed to be, the crust is home made, the sauce is good, and the amount of cheese perfect.\n\nIt's kind of sad that the other 'V' pizza place around the corner isn't any better than the three national chains.",5
1683,Great pizza. Grandma's pie is an all time favorite!,5
1684,"Pizza was fine but nothing special. The salad I ordered was wrong, though. And beware of the prices: What's on the website is wrong. And the manager and owner will say there's nothing they can do about that (except charge you the higher price that isn't on the website).",2
1685,"This is the closest grocery store to me, and I go out of my way to avoid it.  Finding a parking spot is horrible with stop signs everywhere right in front of the main entrance to the store.\n\nEverything is all out of place and it's hard to make a connection as to where a product might be located in the store.  Mind you there are in the middle of a remodel, so I may come back and make and addendum to my review at a later date after the dust settles.  \n\nAs prices go, they are the norm for the Pittsburgh area.  Variety, yeah, they got that covered.  Tidiness, they are working on that.",2
1686,This store is so gross that I was almost sick! Onions peeled and half-rotten. Squishy garlic. Dirt everywhere. I will NEVER step foot in this place again.,1
1687,"This Giant Eagle just went through a recent face lift renovation. I can't speak to the employees or the cleanliness of the store, though I will say it's ghetto level is about a 5 or 6 out of 10. \n\nWhat I really want to say about this Giant Eagle is that they added a Cafe! Yes, a cafe and if you live in pittsburgh you know what that means! 6 Packs of Beer at a reasonable price. Even though they have a limit to how much beer you can buy per visit it's still the best way to buy 6packs in Pittsburgh. It will cost you a extra buck or two but it's still better than most bottle shops I have ever been to.",3
1688,"I really don't get Giant Eagle. They are nice enough, but pricing just makes no sense at all to me. It is close to my house so I'll drop in to buy a thing or two, but would rather go just about anywhere else for my weekly shopping trip.",2
1689,"Fairly typical chain grocery store. Although I have my reasons for liking them:\n\n1) Discounted Kennywood Tickets\n2) Good selection of Pittsburgh Specific food (i.e. Isaley's Chipped ham, etc.)\n3) Cheaper than a whole foods/wawa",3
1690,I love that most of their employees make it known that they would rather be anywhere else but here. \nThe prices are higher than most other competitors but it's the closest store to us so it's easy to get to.,2
1691,One of the worst Wendy's I've ever experienced.  Every morning there was a 30-minute wait - after ordering - for food.,1
1692,"Best Wendy's experience I've ever had! And I wouldn't normally take the time to review fast food. We went just after midnight following a long and tiring day of moving. The idea was to hit up the Eat'N'Park over by Giant Eagle, but alas, they were closed.\n\nWe pulled into the drive thru, and were immediately greeted. Needed a minute to figure out the order and they waited patiently. Also made sure we were okay with waiting 6 minutes for the 3 chicken sandwiches we ordered, which we were. We pulled up and there were 3 young men working the window. They were moving quickly, smiling, and paying attention to what they were doing. We got our drinks and paid, and then I asked if I should move up since we were waiting and there were other cars behind us.\n\nWe waited about 3 minutes when one of the guys comes out and literally FLOURISHES our 3 bags of food at us. I mean, presentation AND style? At a fast food drive-thru at midnight? So cool. He was funny, attentive, and totally made our night. I don't even LIKE Wendy's that much, but I will definitely be back, and soon.",5
1693,"I don't remember the last time I stepped into a fast food burger joint.  Every time I come here, whether it be midday, evening, or late night there is ALWAYS a wait in the drive thru.  \n\nGo at the right time and the person doing the drive thru intercom could be the best entertainment you get in a while.  \n\nOh, yeah, the food isn't all that bad either, props for the \""fresh cut fries.\""",3
1694,Please clean your floor properly.  It feels like Crisco under your feet.  Very dangerous.,2
1695,"Wow. I hope that the one experience I had here was unique and not the norm for frequent customers. All I wanted to do was to buy some thermal socks (which they didn't even have any for men!  ???). I just ended up grabbing the next best thing (Oddly, they did have thermal socks for women which I almost purchased). I go stand in the check out line, and I don't think I've ever dealt with slower people than those who work here (and that's saying something). Not one, but two of the registers I stood in line at froze, and the women had to wait for the manager to fix.  They didn't seem to mind at all, which leads me to believe this happens all of the time. I waited for my beau who bought something after I did: another 15 minute wait.  Needless to say, I will not go here again.",1
1696,"A couple times a month there is a swing dance at Edgewood on Sundays. Frequently featuring a live band, there is a small cover charge (cash only) and a friendly atmosphere. The level of the dancers attending can be hit or miss but its a relaxing sunday evening. There is an area with tables, chairs and a snack table with beverages for an additional donation fee. \n\nThe parking can be difficult (it is a residential area), so it would be smart to try to get there early. \n\nI believe they also have a dance lesson for beginners before the dance starts run by a group called Coal Country Traditions which is a Pittsburgh based group of older dancers that do swing dancing as well as folk dancing of different sorts, there always have pamphlets at the dance in regards to other dances and events going on within the city at a table in the back of the dance.",4
1697,My first visit to the chain in years. Not exactly fine dining but this was open until midnight on weekdays.\n\nI had roast beef sliders and a bowl of French onion soup. The sandwich buns were mushy otherwise everything was fairly good.\n\nService was very good. Meal clocked in around $15 with tip which I think is 3 or 4 too high. Much more extensive menu than Denny's along with a bar if you happen to need a late night fill up.,3
1698,"Consistent service @ the bar w Chuck pouring drafts and mixing up fruity delights. Decent food - don't expect great. Lots of under 500 calorie and Weight Watcher items. Several tv's to watch games. You'll find everyone from book-reading wives that didn't want to cook to laborers grabbing a cheap steak & a few cold ones to huge celebrations filling many tables. It's a great community asset for many.  The Ritz, it ain't.",3
1699,"First off, I like family restaurants and avoid chains when possible. Sometimes that's not possible - in the future I'll avoid this one no matter what.\n\nIts always a zoo, the servers are not interested in what they are doing, and do it poorly. Food comes out of order or not at all. The managers don't care. \n\nWe actually had a waitress spill the soup, catch most of it in her hand, and dump it back in right in front of us. Then she gave it to us before thinking to ask if we wanted another. \n\nJust go anywhere else, it can't be worse!",1
1700,Nothing special. Precooked meals that taste microwaved.,2
1701,"Normally one would think, one chain restaurant is just like the rest but I have had nothing but problems here. The staff appears to be constantly changing as does the managers which should tell you something. I've been there for lunch and dinner and continue to have issues. Here are just some of the problems that we have had: a co-worker had an entire glass of iced tea dropped on him and nothing was comped on his check; we have had to wait a very long time for our orders to be taken; I ordered the pick 2 and was told that the soup could not possibly come out first(even though I've done this before); they have argued with us over what the meal is supposed to come with to the point of us showing them a picture; and staff does not appear to be properly trained.",1
1702,"Worst Applebee's experience I've had.\n\nWe were seated and then waited 10 minutes to even be greeted.  And then it was only because we flagged someone down.  No apologies when we were finally taken care of.\n\nI needed to ask for water three times before I finally went up to the bar to ask for some.  It was then that our server came over with water.  We ordered soup and entrees.  He delivered one soup and an appetizer claiming that was what we ordered and there was no way he misheard.\n\nAbout five minutes later a manager came over and said something to the lines of \""I understand that you've had some issues\""  I then proceeded to very calmly explain what our issues had been.  You could tell he wasn't very interested in what we had to say and didn't seem to care that his server had issues.  His lack of caring was apparent in the fact that while we were waiting to be greeted and during one of the many asks for water, there were several servers and the manager standing behind the bar shooting the breeze.\n\nThe food (once the order was right) was good, but the wait and the mistakes make it highly unlikely we will never return to this location.",2
1703,"I told everyone that I wasn't feeling this. Should have listened to my gut on this one. We didn't make reservations for our party of 7, which I suppose we should have. They had to create space for us. Like really create it. Where we were all sitting in the walkway. Knew I was in the walkway when the waiter asked for us to move so that a little girl in a wheelchair could get around. But I didn't have a problem with that. What I have a problem with is all the nasty flies in the building. And while you're eating too...it's so disgusting. The place is so freakin crowded as well...maybe just because I hate being in crowded and tight spots. \nAs far as the menu, I wasn't impressed. It took me 20 mins to find something (partly because I'm picky). But I ended up with the chicken broccoli alfredo, nothing to rave about. I wanted more broccoli than what was provided, but oh well. The lime/kiwi lemonade was pretty good though.",2
1704,"Another overdone steak and utterly inattentive staff! Still sitting here waiting for someone to give a care.\n\nSo, we finally got the attention of a server who was not our server, Michael. She was kind enough to take my steak back to the kitchen. Michael, our server, finally shows up 10 minutes later with a half-hearted apology and to let me know that my steak was being prepared again. He does not offer to refill our drink glasses that have now been sitting empty for 20 minutes. The manager makes an appearance and brings me a strip steak that looks rare from the sight of it. He informs me that my steak is on him and apologizes. He goes away. I cut into my steak and it's, you guessed it, Pittsburgh Rare. I asked for medium rare. He returns and I tell him that the chef needs to go back to culinary school and learn how to prepare a steak. The manager apologizes again and asks me if I want to take this pathetic piece of beef home with me! Not only is it rare but it's a cheap cut of strip steak that is loaded with connective gristle. I said no thanks. He comped my husband's meal and we left. I never hope for people to lose their jobs but the cook and the server really need some serious retraining! I will never go back to this Applebee's again.",1
1705,"With this location being at a busy intersection off an exit from the Parkway makes it almost a nightmare to use this place.  Hardly any parking if you don't need to actually get gas.\n\nThe inside of the store is on the small side as well.  Doesn't help that the store part is changing from the BP branded store to a 7-eleven.  I swear that they decided it was amazing to put in an ATM that was four times the size than what was there before.  Be careful not to trip over the loose floor tiles as well.\n\nNot very many choices for gas off the Edgewood/Swissvale exit, so maybe wait to go to another location.",3
1706,Fair prices.  Consistent Octane rating.  I've never been inside.  Also I think this station is very busy so the premium my car burns always seems to go a little further on a tank from here.  Not sure why but I also always get 20 more miles out of a tank if I fill up here instead of getgo or costco.,4
1707,"They took their vegetarian meal off the menu.  They'll make one for you especially but I always feel demanding and would prefer if they had just kept it on the menu.\n\nPlus, this one is always really quiet.

1708,"I have been going to Benihana's back when it was Samuri... I visit the Cleveland and Pittsburgh one frequently. The cleveland one is better but they are both going down hill at a very fast past. I keep giving them another chance and i keep getting disappointed. They have changed so many things in the past year and its for the worse. The shrimp the order they give you the food, the way the cut the veggies. Im becoming a Huge fan of Itchiban both the one in robinson and cranberry, Its cheaper and you get more food for your money . I hope Beni's changes. I even e mailed them and they didnt respond .",2
1709,I like this place it provides a great atmosphere and can handle big groups. They also send you a coupon for a free dinner on your birthday and can use it anytime during your birthday month.  I would recommend making a reservation as they are normally busy and it takes awhile to eat. But this is a great place to go for a special occasion.,5
1710,It all depends on the chef who is performing for you . I have been here twice in last several months and felt everything was average . I have seen other chefs in different restaurants and they have put on a much better show .,3
1711,The atmosphere was fun. Our chef was very nice and entertaining. The filet was excellent.  Their salad dressing is a little harsh for my taste.  Over all it was a great time. I will definitely go back.,5
1712,"Benihana.  It's just rolls off the tongue, doesn't it?  No, unfortunately not.at.all...anymore.  From hence forth, all mentions of Benihana are likely to cause anxiety in my usually calm heart.  I hate complaining like this. I really do. But sometimes, you just have to, ya know?\n\nTuesday evening I met a group of friends for a birthday dinner.  The reservation for our party of nine was for 7:00pm.  All but one of our party arrived prior to 7:00, but the hostess was curt in explaining that all party members needed to be present before we were seated, as our chef would be ready to begin meal preparation as soon as we were seated.  Fortunately, the final member of our party arrived shortly and we were seated at 7:05pm.  It was not until 7:40pm that first contact with our server was made. Without any apology for the delay she took our drink orders.  She (name withheld because I don't want to be rude) returned more than 10 minutes later with our drinks, but waited another 10-15 minutes after that to take our dinner orders.  As I was waiting I looked over at the table next to us, who were also clearly celebrating a child's birthday.  At one point the mother (I'm assuming) smiled at me and said, \""I hope you get out before midnight. We've been here over two hours.  We're taking our cake and getting out of here.\""\n\nUpon taking our orders, one of our guests explained that due to a shrimp allergy it was necessary to cook any shrimp ordered by our group in another area (a neighboring grill, etc.).  Our server said that she would have to ask the manager, who came to our table shortly thereafter.  When the manager arrived at the table my guest explained her allergy and his response was that it might be in her best interest to leave.  I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt that he meant leaving the table, not the restaurant, but I'm not certain of this. Following this recommendation he mentioned that she could wait in the bar as the rest of us dined table-side.  I asked him why it was not an option to prepare the shrimp at a neighboring table, but he expressed concern that other customers may require the use of the other available tables.  I understand his point, but the restaurant was near-empty as the hour quickly approached 8:30pm.  Finally, he offered to prepare the shrimp portions of our meals in the kitchen.  I'm not sure why this wasn't initially mentioned as an option, but I'll leave it at that.  \n\nOur chef Tom eventually arrived at our table. He was very pleasant and efficient during the course of our meal preparation.  During his time at the table my Emperor's Salad was delivered, as were the majority of my table's sushi orders.  However, two of our guests that ordered sushi were not served at this time.  In fact, they were not served until a full 10 minutes after the rest of our party finished our meals.  At one point, they inquired about the delay to she-whose-name-shall-not-be-mentioned, who responded that they were \""waiting for the rice.\""  When she delivered their food there was not a single mention of the delay.  \n\nTwo hours and thirty+ minutes after we arrived at Benihana, we left.  From start to finish, the entire evening was a terrible experience.  It was ridiculous to the point that there was not even soap or toilet paper available in the restroom.  Were it not for the kindness and professionalism of Tom (and the awesome company of friends), the night would have been a complete waste.  \n\nMy final thought is this. The food was fine, but because I was feeling particularly piggish on this Tuesday evening, I enjoyed two California rolls from my stash of Costco sushi at home before departing for the restaurant. The difference between Costco's rolls and Benihana's...a toss up - just sayin.  The good news is, this will give my friends something to whine about for YEARS to come...",1
1713,"I have to admit, I kind of thought Benihana was fictitious until we moved to Pittsburgh... and then low and behold, there was one right near where we live. The food is okay. There are better hibachi options in the area. The service can be okay or awful. One time, we were there with our kids and had an absolutely EVIL waitress. One of my kids isn't a big eater, so instead of ordering her a full kids' meal, we just got a side order of rice and soup. The kids' meal her brother was having came with ice cream, so when we were done with dinner, we asked if she could get ice cream as well. I don't know if she thought we wanted the ice cream free (which we definitely didn't!) but she said no, we absolutely COULD NOT order ice cream separately. You either get it with the kids' meal or you don't get it. WTF?",2
1714,Only complaint was when we arrived we were basically told we had to wait for another party to arrive prior to being seated.  Was told we could go to bar---after saying no we wanted to be seated they agreed.  We made reservations for 3 and had no idea who other party was so why could we not be seated---we were not asking to be served.  Over all experience was nice.  Waitress very nice and attentive and so was Chef.,3

1716,"Ok. It started out as a rough night . 40 minutes late honoring our reservation, lack of communication from management. Slow service once we did get seated. Our 8:30 reservation was not met with any food until at least 9:30. Really crazy. However, it was made alllll better by our chef, Tito. When we go back and we *will* go back -- we will ask for Tito.  Is he Japanese? No, but he is awesome.   To apologize the manager did comp our entire meal... We were a party of 10 -- and we took good care of our servers...it really wasn't their fault. Happy Xmas eve Tito you know how to do it right. Thanks.",3
1717,Benihana is by far our favorite steak and seafood place in the area. The food is so fresh. The chefs are great. The wait staff is excellent.  If you're looking for shrimp flying and loud chefs singing obnoxious songs then this is not for you. If you want a friendly  atmosphere and delicious food then this is your place. \nThe sushi is fresh and tasty. The quality of food is obviously there.,5
1718,"Many great memories and great experience at Benihana BUT last night WAS NOT! Horrible service! Took 15 mins to even take a drink order...then when I had a question about a speciality wine the waiter says he didn't know so ok no big deal, could he go find.. NO! Told me to go the bar and ask the bartender. Really?!? Then the chef came out and was pretty good although cooked everything separate starting  with only onions and zucchini, where's the veggies?? From start to finish it was about half an hour! If we ate the dinner as a whole it would've been cold.. So we ate as we went. Also drink refills were a tough task too.. the chef had to keep asking other servers to assist. few and far between!! We had 3 birthdays at our table.. Not one song , which I didn't care, not one complimentary picture, no dessert was offered until another customer said something. Then the bill.. Oh the bill... That took another 15 mins!! At this point I told my family to go ahead home and I will wait considering this overall experience was almost a 2 hour ordeal. I was double charged on two items. At this point I was DONE dealing with this incompetent and appethetic waiter!!! Went to settle my bill with the manager who was nice and accommodating. Rectified the errors. And was generous with a $20 refund! I told him about the experience and all he said was \""I can take picture now for you\"" UM... I was by myself!!! No thanks! One last thing, the male greeter needs some drug intervention.. He was high as a kite and made my daughter & I feel very uncomfortable to the point of invading our personal space and staring with those glazed over eyes as he staggered to and from his post. WOW & BOO!!! And sad : (",1
1719,"This is by the far the worst hibachi restaurant I have eaten at. The food is very bland from the onion soup to the fried rice (which basically was white rice with chopped onions) to the chicken (which was so pale it looked like it was boiled). Hibachi food typically has tons of flavor and tastes good because it has some grill marks and char, which none of our food had. I question whether it was even cooked on the hibachi table (we ate at a regular table but ordered from the hibachi menu). Not only was the food bad but the service was terrible. Our waiter didn't even know that hibachi dinners should come with the two sauces, he acted confused when I asked for them. Additionally, we ordered a sushi roll for an appetizer and instead of getting it before dinner, we received it after our dinner even though we saw it sitting at the sushi bar for a good 15 minutes beforehand. This restaurant may have been around for a long time but it doesn't even compare to other hibachi restaurants and was more expensive than any other I've eaten at.",1
1720,This place is crappy the only veggies u get is onions and zucchinis took the server 30 min to serv us drinks then took them 20 min to take orders by the time the chef comes out already an hour just for the food and the show after we ate our waiter didnt even recommend anny desserts just gave us the chek and leave with out saying anny thing els o i for got we were still eating like wtf im still eating and so was mi family and u just give me the check the chef just left like five min ago . I recamen go sime where els n eat,1
1721,"This is the WORST Hibachi I have ever had.  We came here for a friends birthday, and I will never be going back. Service was mediocre, but the food was the real travesty.\nYou go to Hibachi for a show, but it's not fun when the cook makes the SAME Giant Eagle joke the entire time.  He also couldn't perform all the tricks that are pretty standard from Hibachi chefs.  The food. Not good.  My boyfriend ordered tofu and it was cold in the middle.  He didn't bother to have the guy heat it more, b/c it would have just been a hassle.  The chef forgot one friends meal completely and got rude with the server.  Then after everything was cooked, he looked at me and asked did you eat all your shrimp. I replied \""no, you never served me any.\"" (I had ordered the chicken and shrimp.)  He then sends the server back into the kitchen to get more. By the time they were cooked, everyone was finished eating.  Come on.  To make matters worse, when we left we saw that he was the head chef. That doesn't say too much for the rest of them. \nI don't know how people keep coming here.  There is WAY better hibachi in Pittsburgh, for a lot less money.  I mean honestly, I paid $9.50 for a glass of Kendall Jackson. No. \nThe best part of the meal were the cupcakes that my friend brought.  Do your wallet and your stomach a favor and go to a different Hibachi place.  Benihana is not worth your time or money.",1
1722,"Benihana has always been one of my favorite Hibachi places, but the last couple of times we went, service wasn't too good. Our cook appeared to be high and dropped things during his presentation. He had us worried while he controlled the fire of the stove top and flipped items in the air because he just did not seem to be experienced or professional. The food is always very good though and I have never been disappointed by it! The green tea ice cream is especially unique and delicious! I also love their lobster and would definitely order it again! I really hope that Benihana stays strict on who represents them on the floor and monitors their workers' quality of work more. Other than that, Benihana has the best Hibachi food there is!",3
1723,"We celebrated my daughter's 12th Birthday at Benihana on 10/16/14.  The food was delicious and the chef was very talented and entertaining!  He did things with the food on the Hibachi we hadn't seen before...a big heart made out of fried rice and made it \""beat\"" using the spatula.  \n     The only negative was when it came time for them to sing Happy Birthday our waitress was the only one around so our poor waitress was stuck doing the birthday songs by herself\nSo we joined in to help her.  No wonder our waitress seemed so unhappy with her job.\n    I was happy that we had the option of brown rice and not just white or fried rice.",4
1724,This place has the weirdest entrance ever. Just be prepared. \n\nCame for my sons 5th birthday last night. He's a little foodie. The restaurant itself is nice and we were seated pretty quickly.  Our waitress showed up 2 seconds later to take drink orders and appetizer/sushi orders. I just asked for water and some time to actually look at the menu. several min later out waitress came back with drinks and asked to take orders. I ordered chicken and steak along with a cranberry mojito. Quickly after taking orders our waitress brought out our soup. I liked it but it lacked salt. Before I even finished the salad course came out. I was able to enjoy both before the chef came out to prepare our meal. What did bother me was all the dishes in our area. I can't stand a dirty table and I wish our waitress would have removed them sooner. Our chef Penny wasn't the best hibachi chef I've seen but she was great with my son and he really enjoyed watching her. She was honestly a lot of fun. The hibachi itself was pretty good. I liked the fried rice which is an up charge. The steak was good and so was the chicken. I honestly don't think it was anything special. Dessert was ice cream also nothing special. \n\nSo to sum it up our waitress seemed overwhelmed and managed to make me feel rushed even though I feel she could have visited our table a few more times then she did. That along with being overpriced is why only the 3 stars.,3
1725,"The only reason I wouldn't rate this place any higher than a 3 is that it can be a hit or miss. This time was great! \n\nFOOD: I ordered the chopper steak salad, which is grilled steak on top of a bed of greens with half an avocado, cherry tomatoes, corn, onions and a tortilla. The steak was tender and tasty with the ripe avocado. I had it with Ranch dressing. This combination was a light but filling dinner.",3
1726,"If you're a hardcore fan of authentic Mexican food, this is probably not the place for you.  The enchiladas remind me more of chilaquiles - definitely more layered than rolled.  The burritos are huge but it really drives me crazy how segmented they are.  One bite will be all rice, the next will be all meat.  The tofu tacos are okay, but the bean sprouts seem like a weird addition.\n\nI know, you're probably thinking \""What DOES this girl like about Mad Mex?\""  If you can let go of any previous Mexican food experiences (or if you've never had Mexican food before, as I hadn't when I first went to Mad Mex), some things are ok.  The tofu tacos minus the bean sprouts.  The California grilled salad.  The chickpea chili and black bean soup, the potato taquitos.  Nachos, chips & salsa, and guacamole are all decent.  Their sides are ridiculously huge and the desserts are all ok (except the sopapillas).  Basically, stick to the least authentic stuff and you should be fine.\n\nAdditionally, some of their entrees are available with your choice of either chicken, steak, shrimp, portobello mushrooms or tofu.  They have tons of vegetarian options.  They have good happy hour deals and good late night margarita deals.  They have raspberry, strawberry, mango, and kiwi margaritas year round, with one or two seasonal flavors per month, plus a full bar, a bunch of tequilas and a huge, varied beer list that tends to focus on local beers.\n\nSo basically: the less you know about Mexican food, the less disappointed you will be.  If you're a fan of authentic Mexican food, either stick to something more basic like a salad, or pick a different restaurant.",3
1727,"I read a few of the reviews of Mad Mex and quite a few reviewers called their food Tex Mex and I don't see it that way. I see Mad Mex as more Cali Mex with the accent being on fresh ingredients, healthy cooking, and excellent service. The black bean soup is almost fat free and the best I've ever had. (try it Joe D style with a dollop of guac on it instead of sour cream) The lime cilantro salad dressing Is amazing, I've had it on the grilled portobello mushroom salad for a meat free meal. The grilled fish tacos are every bit as good as the famous fish tacos in San Diego. The fish is grilled perfectly, plenty of home made guac, pico, and sour cream accompany this dish. The beer list is a who's who of some of the finest micro brews across the states, including many IPAs which are rotated monthly. You can watch the bartenders squeezing fresh fruits and melons for their huge line ups of margaritas flavors. This little Pittsburgh gem of a restaurant is now opening locations in other cities like Columbus and Philly. There are many locations in the Burgh.",4
1728,"Perhaps our mistake was going on a Sat.night in the summer .Who knew it would be packed to the gills with thirsty college students. \nLoud is an understatement. We were crammed into a little table the four of us elbow to elbow with the diners seated on both sides. \nThis already has put me in a bad mood.I never did well in Europe sharing my table with stranger and in the U.S it irks me even more \nIt took forever to get our drinks of simply water and soda. \nWe at last caught our waitresses eye and was told should would take care of us she guessed.....? What the heck she was the same waitress who took the drink order and was delivering the food next to us. \nWhen Ms.Wiffty finally brought our long awaited food it is totally the wrong order.We even considered asking if we could just keep it because we had waited so long, but no off she went to leave us for another 20 minutes. \nWhat we got at long last was so disappointing. \nIt tasted no better than Taco Bell anywhere in America.Think nacho grande with a side of Guacamole. First and last visit.We did notice on the bill she gave us the wrong check .It was for half the amount of food we ordered and was probably some poor guys check.We waved her over .Her reply was just leave the money on the table I'll come by and get it later................ \nSo we did.",2
1729,Love their spicy black bean dip and their black bean and pineapple quesadilla... mmmm can't get enough of their black bean.,5
1730,"Do they still do the half-price late night menu here?  That used to be clutch.  Margaritas are solid and the food is good. They actually steam their burritos, so the tortilla is super-soft and warm.  Like the salsa here too.  \n\nAll the way down Atwood, this place caps off a string of good multicultural restaurants.  It's the most fun of them all.",3
1731,"Not a pleasant experience.  While looking at the menu, we ordered a margarita and a draft beer.  The beer came in a bottle instead of a draft and the margarita had a terrible funky taste - almost a \""plastic chemical\"" taste.  Next we chose to have chips and dips/salsa.  We were able to choose three dips/salsas and the server brought one that was incorrect.  To his credit, he promptly corrected the error and brought the right one.\n\nNeedless to say we elected not to have dinner and departed after drinks and chips.  There is much better Mexican food and drink in the 'burgh.",2
1732,"\""Meh.  I've experience better.\"" \n\nI find this fairly overpriced for the quality of food.  I think that the decor of the place and the witty menu drive up the \""like\"" of this place b/c it's modern and fun... but it all comes down to the food, and it's not something I'd think about again when I leave, but I wouldn't object too heavily if someone asked me to meet them there again.  They staff is nice, when it's busy they're a little slow.  The food is spicy, like the guacamole and house salsa - I like spicy, but it didn't really add flavor, just made my mouth burn enough to get a second margarita (which was strong - good, but strong w/ low-end tequila, yuck.. paid the extra $$ for better liquor).  The pico de gallo, my alternative to the spicy salsa, was as bland as they come so I settled on \""virgin\"" chips.  Everything is just mediocre and pricey... meh.",2
1733,You have no idea how badly I WANT to like this place. They are incredibly vegetarian/vegan-friendly. I just haven't been impressed by anything I've ordered there. Even the chips and salsa aren't terribly good. I do like the bar-- they have great sangria-- but that's about it.,2
1734,"The food here is pretty good but the service was some of the worst I've ever experienced. Our wait just to place drink orders was almost 15 minutes, had I not been exhausted from my drive in from Columbus I probably would have left then. However we stayed the waitress was slow, forgetful we had to yell for her or wave our arms if we needed anything. At one point the poor people next to us who had also received terrible Service were asked by the waitress a full 15 minutes after she placed their order if she had gotten their orders. I probably won't visit this location again on my next Pittsburgh trip.",2
1735,"When I was living in Wheeling WV, my friends and I would always go to this place for special occasions. They have an awesome beer selection and all kinds of great food! Plus most of their food has a vegan option!\n\nThat being said the food is really good but not great. The tofu is bland and the salsa is not very spicy. But who needs tofu when you have beans and guacamole? They make a good salsa verde as well.\n\nThe place has seating inside and out side, both with plenty of seats. There is all kinds of unique south western inspired art all over the place and it makes for a lovely atmosphere.",4
1736,"We went to the Mad Mex in Cranberry Twp and won't make the mistake of going back. \n\nThe food was horribly hot, like they just toss in heat for heat's sake, rather than for taste. I ordered the mole chicken enchiladas and that was NOT any kind of mole I've ever had. The sauce was more like a weak, thin ranchero sauce and both the sauce and the chicken was too hot. Even the guacamole was too hot. \n\nI recognize this restaurant chain is trying to be a trendy \""fusion\"" of Tex-Mex and CA, but they failed. Luckily, they are in the same parking lot as a pharmacy so I was able to walk straight over for some Tums.\n\nIf you want GOOD Tex-Mex, go to El Campo in Monaca or El Paso Mexican Grill in Chippewa. Both restaurants are excellent examples of good Tex-Mex, similar to the styles typically served in Central California.",1
1737,"Wonderful ambiance and great selection of brews and food. Absolutely love the the tofu tacos and pineapple habanero salsa.\n\nThe stars are for the food and ambiance only. We dined here twice on our trip to Pittsburgh. The first time, our server was very attentive and a total sweetheart. \n\nThe second time, we took my Dad and his girlfriend out to dinner. The table was WAY too small for 3 people having fajitas. The main problem was even though the waitress came over to check on us, she never seemed to look down at the mountain of dirty plates and refills needed.\nShe would ask if we needed anything? But  never gave us a chance to answer. We were always yelling after her, \""more coffee!\"" \""more water!\""  We also felt like we were inconveniencing her. She never smiled or showed any enthusiasm. Seemed like a completely different experience from a few days prior.\n\nWe will definitely return to Mad Mex, but maybe hitting up the Shadyside location instead.",3
1738,Always great service at the bar from Tanya and Nikki. Great food and wide selection of draft beers. One of my favorite spots.,5
1739,"I love this restaurant and I probably go about once a month; however, there's just something about the inconsistency that gets me to just feel like it's not quite there.\n\nMad Mex offers a funky decor and typically quick service.  If you plan to go on a Friday or Saturday night, I suggest reservations because there's nowhere really to relax indoors when you are waiting for a table.\n\nBeing regulars, we have settled into a few choice menu items.  If you bother to read the menu, you'll notice a few jokes hidden in the description of items, so even if you are a regular, it's worth a read.  We always start with some chips and pico or the Picka Dippa and some margaritas.  The black bean dip is to die for.  Slight bit of spice, creamy black beans and a little bit of melted cheese.  The beer cheese isn't my favorite, so that one is never ordered, but we regularly switch up the salsa choices.  For margaritas, we have settled on the Ultimate margarita or the Don Julio VIP.\n\nThe burritos are huge.  Seriously, as big as your face type of huge.  At this restaurant, you will definitely use your silverware.  Of course, they are filled with a lot of rice and beans, so I recommend to pay extra for double meat to make a more desirable meat to starch ratio.  The chimichanga is great, but pre-made so they can't accomodate any changes.  The tacos and fajitas are good and come with nice warm flour tortillas.  Enchiladas tend to be oversauced, but overall good.  \n\nThe food tends to be quite consistant and you get what you expect, but other parts of the meal tend to be hit or miss:\n1. I think it's the sour mix, but something about the margaritas tends to be really inconsistant.  Sometimes you get a strong one, sometimes not so strong.... Sometimes you get a sweet one, sometimes you get a sour one.  It's never terrible by any means, but you really never know what you are going to get.  The Greentree location has the most variation in the margaritas while McNight road's margaritas tend to be better more often.\n2. As off-season tomatoes tend to be finiky, sometimes the pico is fresh and flavorful, sometimes you get the gritty or cardboard-ish tomatoes.\n3. Some of there servers are great while other times you get one that leaves you wanting more from the service.\n\nIn contrast to another review, YES, they do appreciate you on your birthday.  None of that childish singing or a flamboyant dessert... if you are on there list, you get a birthday card for a free burrito.  That's better than any of that cheesy crap.  Although a casual dining chain restaurant typically isn't worthy birthday dinner fare, if someone's giving away a free burrito, I am there.",4
1740,"Burritos are huge! Margaritas are good,  and they have a good selection of tequila!",4
1741,"This place is hard to find in this crazy plaza, but the food makes it all worthwhile.\n\nThe Herb O'Vores Tacos are one of the most delicious things I have ever had. I've had them twice in State College and once here. I was tempted to try something new on the menu but our waitress said you can never go wrong with the tofu tacos and she is right. I didn't regret it one bit. I can always try making my own thai burrito or spicy buffalo wrap at home.\n\nYou get three tacos filled with fried cubes of tofu which have been tossed in a light sweet General Tso's type sauce topped with bean sprouts, a green salsa with avocado and served with lime wedges, rice, and black beans. So delicious and it all came out of the kitchen pretty quickly.\n\nI love reading their menu. The Mex-Asian dishes all sound awesome. If I lived in Pittsburgh, I would come often to try everything.\n\nThey also have Daiya cheese and vegan cheesecake always on their menu. How sweet is that?\n\nMy only complaint is that we went just after 5 and it was so dark in the restaurant I could hardly see the menu.",4
1742,"I took my niece here last week for lunch and we enjoyed our food.  The guac was really good.  They gave us a lot, and we both had enough for another dinner.  When I was eating my left overs, I came across a piece of wood in my burrito...probably a piece of toothpick, but it was a turnoff and I threw the rest of my food out.  I deducted a star for that.",3
1743,This place is okay. The waiter was horrible and barely checked on us. The food was also not too good. It was very bland and didn't have a lot of taste to it. I will not be coming back.,2
1744,This afternoon I took my 4 year old to this mad mex for lunch after a great morning swimming and doing a yoga class.  We had to send back our food because the chicken was stone cold (even though surrounded by sizzling veggies on a skillet).  It seemed like it was yeterday's chicken.  They brought out fresh food and I'm kicking myself for having eaten it.  The rest of our day has been spent cleaning up food poisoning accidents and in the bathroom.,1
1745,"The food isn't terrible, but not impressive.  I lived in LA for 4 years, so I'm super spoiled when it comes to having good Meixcan food.  We got a burrito, which was just stuffed with fillers such as rice and beans..no thanks.  There was nothing memorable about the taste of it whatsoever.  Who seriously wants a huge burrito like that?  I'd rather have a normal sized one that actually tastes good and isn't filled with crap.  We got the steak fajitas, which were actually pretty decent.  The steak was cooked perfectly as ordered, which I appreciate.  We also got the chips with salsa and guac, which were good, but, come on, it's really not hard to mess those up!  Overall, I'm just not impressed, but I guess you can't really find that great of Mexican food options in Pittsburgh.",2
1746,"I eat here a lot (like at least once a week, sometimes twice).  Margaritas are good, they have an EXCELLENT rotating draft beer selection.  Prices at happy hour are good for booze, and good for wings (though sometimes you get dinky wings at the happy hour price).  Overall food prices are high ($10 minimum for an entree, usually closer to $15).\n\nA lot of their food is good.  They do really try.  It just isn't mexican, at all, period.  It's gringo through and through.  But, like I said, if you want waffle fries and wings in a mexican-like place, go here!\n\nWait staff is very good at this location.  Parking sucks (bad).",3
1747,"I love me some Mad Mex but, I have to say that I have never had anything but the grilled fish tacos.  They are so good that I never felt the need to get anything  else when I order.  Why mess up a good thing.  This specific location is very nice and out of the way but I have to say that the fish tacos at the location in Monroeville, PA are much better than here.  Not sure if it was just an off day because I have eaten here before, but at Monroeville they are VERY consistent on delivering a darn good grilled fish (mahi-mahi) taco.  Today's dish was still very, very good but the fish was slightly dry.  I'm being picky here but that is only because I have eaten at least 50 or so grilled fish tacos from Mad Mex.  Now, in giving my review, know this .... I still got an order to bring home.  YES, I did.  For some reason (like lasagna) they are better the next day.  I will be eating them for breakfast.",4
1748,"While I LOVE Mad Mex, this one is to be avoided.  For whatever reason, they always seem to manage to mess up orders and on a couple of occassions, I've just not felt well after eating there.  Because it's a BB, I just keep thinking I had to be wrong about that.  But after waking up in the middle of the night with all sorts of unpleasant stomach issues, I've had to write this location off.  Go to Robinson instead... (Or BB, please, please get a new KM for this location!)",1
1749,"I think its time to sacrifice time and convenience. When we visit the area....this place always lacks the experience that we receive from ShadySide, Robinson, and Ross Park. Even though it closer to my Dad's House when visiting...its time for us to part ways. The food and service is never as good at this location. I love, love, love their tofu tacos...but this was just eh this time...it was as though the thick pieces fell apart and they were small and too crunchy and maybe just old...bleh. I couldn't even finish them, even though I cannot wait to eat them the 3 times a year I get to have them. Total Bummer.",2
1750,"I'm in from out of town, and I'm so surprised and disappointed about the level of we received here during a quiet Sunday lunch hour. Our waitress gave us indignant responses to every request, with visible eyerolls to things like sharing fajitas. \n\nWhen an order came out completely wrong, she said \""Sorry for the mixup, but I don't control the kitchen\"" and made no effort to correct the order. Had she showed any effort or contrition, the error really wouldn't have bothered me, but she actually seemed to act like it was our fault. \n\nIt really disappointed me to have my dad treated like this on our family meal together on my final day in town. Please train your staff better and treat customers with any level of appreciation or helpfulness.",2
1751,"I love kitchen stores, and Crate is one of the best in pittsburgh. Recently I read a few articles about the dangers of non stick cookware. None of them are really any good for any of us. I won't get into what the dangers of them are, but they are real and most non stick cookware will be off the market by 2015.\n\nI started looking into enamel coated cookware, Crate has a number of different varieties and bought myself a 3 piece starter set with an 8, 10, and 12 inch pans. Like non stick, no oils are needed and clean up is pretty quick.\n\nCrate in itself is a cooking gadget Mecca. If you love stainless steel cookware, they have anything you want from All Clad, made right in Canonsburg Pa. There's Fiesta ware from Wheeling, and If you want Emeral's professional cookware , Crate has it.\n\nYou can take cooking classes here as well, they have a full service kitchen in back. Classes are limited to certain amounts due to space, but everyone sits after and enjoys the food they've prepped. \n\nIt's top of the line cookware so it has top of the line prices. But well worth it!",4
1752,"I attended the sushi class on Monday night.  The instructors were great:  friendly, funny, helpful.  The class structure was good, but certainly geared toward those who have never attempted making their own sushi before.  Everyone had their own station and was able to make three different rolls.  \n\nHowever, I seriously question the value.  The course was to be two and one half hours in duration.  After approximately seventy-five minutes, we began cleaning up to go home.  It should be noted that the 75 minute class time included a 10-15 minute sales pitch of Crate's products. For $60 per person, I was beyond disappointed.  It seems unethical and deliberately misleading to advertise the length of the class and barely run 50% of the scheduled time.\n\nThe bottom line:  good instruction, but you'll feel extremely cheated at the end.",2
1753,"Crouse's beer distributor is a good, convenient place to pick up a case. The prices are affordable and the staff are friendly and helpful. The selection is also pretty decent.",4
1754,"A very oddly laid out supermarket. the Deli isle is not very wide, the the walls are closing in on you, and they put the DIY olive cart in front to make it more cluttered. Just a poorly laid out store which is showing it's age.",2
1755,Dirty and small.  Not laid out well.  Expired items on the shelves.  Rude cashiers.  Self check out usually broken.  Horrible experience more than once.  I don't shop here unless I have to.,1
1756,The worst pulled pork sandwich I have ever had.    Their watermelon mixed drink was very good though.  I won't be returning.,1
1757,"The sundae bar is a big hit with my kids, particularly the blue \""whipped cream\"" (I shudder to think what's actually in that). The food's pretty much the same stuff you can get at Friday's, Applebee's, etc. I like their salad with the almonds and blue cheese-- they sometimes really dowse it in dressing but it's good.",3
1758,"What's better than fresh, homemade free cookies?!\n\nWell, a gluten free cookie, but whatever, I can still enjoy myself in sharing free food with other people. \n\nMax & Erma's is like the place to get everything. If I'd ever been to an Eat N' Park I imagine it'd be like that except classier. Well, I don't know about classier, again I've never been to Eat N' Park. But back to Max & Erma's...\n\nThe location we went to always has a crowded parking lot. I don't know why it's so busy but there's hardly any parking there. Allot a few more minutes for parking. You'll need it.\n\nOnce you're in though it's super fun. Build your burger, eat greasy appetizers, and taste some delicious milkshakes. I've had the lunch special - soup or salad or half sandwich for pretty cheap. It's just enough food to not leave you in a food coma after lunch. The only thing I wish (and yes this took away a star) is that there were more sandwich options. So sometimes I get the soup & salad and I'm still hungry. That's a no bueno.\n\nThen there's dinner. Their burgers are kind of fantastic. I'm still not over the whole eating a rare cooked burger so everywhere in PA gets added bonus points for that. So overall it's a good burger, but it's certainly not the best burger I've ever eaten and there's nothing really creative about their burgers to make them stand apart from other place's burgers. \n\nThe atmosphere is something between a TGIFridays or Chili's but very Pittsburgh-centric. I found it somewhere between comforting and annoying. I don't really like chain restaurants but this one had some nice personal stuff to keep it from venturing into the Fridays realm.\n\nAlso, if you're a craft beer & burger sort a gal, you'll notice this place is not for you. There's more than Bud, but not a lot. \n\nP.S. Free cookie night is Wednesday.\n\nP.P.S. Get the white chocolate macadamia nut.",3
1759,"Obviously, you aren't coming here because it is in any way cool, or because of the 80's decor. You got kids with you or others whose palette doesn't extend past burgers and fries. These limitations can be overlooked. What can't be forgiven, however, is the shabbiness of this place. It looks like it gets vacuumed once a week, and the bathrooms are disgusting.",1
1760,good burgers and soup!!!,4
1761,"Had a beer and an appetizer, so-so.  Service was nice and quick, which is about all I need with the kids.  Kids seemed to like their kids meals, the usual Mac and cheese, grilled cheese, chicken fingers.  Huge line at Mad Mex on Friday night, none here.  I doubt we will go back, too many other choices.",2
1762,"Stopped for dinner there while traveling on business.  Greeted by a friendly hostess, seated and ignored.   After 25 minutes without a server, I left.  Will not recommend to anyone else passing through.  I don't know if all the wait staff didn't feel like serving one person because tips are smaller for one than a group or if they were just incompetent or just rude.  Extremely dissatisfied.",1
1763,Went there on my first day in Pittsburg. Wasn't the best experience. My waitress was to busy talking to her coworkers that she couldn't even give us any sauces. The food was ok but nothing to great. When I go back to Pittsburg I will not be going there again!!!!,1
1764,Not up to it's previous brunch standards. Buffet has scaled back in variety and quality.   Still good but no longer excellent.,2
1765,"We went to this location, on Cochran Road, a couple nights ago around 10pm.  We ordered the wedge salad, an appetizer trio, and the wings (which I ordered extra crispy).  The salad came first and was pretty good but seemed to not have any toppings except for the salad dressing.  The appetizer trio came out next and was a bit of a disappointment.  The potato skins weren't that good- mushy and no seasoning (salt/spice).  Also, the bacon was soft and mushy.  The nachos were edible but nothing to write home about- again a little mushy once you got below the ones on the top and the guacamole was pretty bland.  The buffalo chicken planks were a little under-cooked for my taste but were otherwise good.  The buffalo wings came out last and I was happy with them- they were done (crispy) the way I like them.  The wings were what I was craving when I walked into the place- the void was filled.  \n\nThe service was a little slow.  We sat at the bar and there were only 2 other people at the bar and only 1 table with 4 people elsewhere in the place.  They seemed to be starting to close up at that time.  It took about 10 minutes to get our drinks because the bartender dropped a wine bottle- so we had to wait for him to clean it up and hear his amazing account of the accident before being served.    \n\nI would go back again the next time I crave wings (because decent wings are really hard to find in the South Hills).  Maybe during the day the service will be faster.  I will definitely order the wedge salad again and the wings but will be more careful when ordering the appetizer.",3
1766,"There's really absolutely nothing special about Max & Erma's. In fact I would say it's probably about the most boring chain restaurant out there. No wait, Ruby Tuesdays still exists... but at least they have a salad bar... hmmm. Anyways, the only reason I keep coming back is because my husband's family LOVES to use their back room for every occasion. Ugh. Can't we just have get-togethers at someone's house like normal families do? \n\nSo since we are forced to show up for family functions I've had cause to try much of the menu, and most of it is average or below. The only thing that has been consistently good is their tortilla soup. If you're not getting that, don't bother. I've heard about free cookie Wednesday, but come on, is that really going to drum up that much business? At Eat N' Park, free cookies are a staple. Get it together Max & Erma...",2
1767,"Absolutely horrible service, when we entered the hostess gave an audible sigh like we were inconveniencing her with our presence.  We were seated for over 10 minutes and never had a server come to even take drink orders.  Needless to say we left, and we will not be going back.",1
1768,"I have been to this place many many times over the years. But the last visit was at least a year prior. \n\nI was shocked by the outside condition of the restaurant. This place definitely looks like it's falling apart on the outside. \n\nI didn't stay there to eat, but from what little that I  saw, the inside looked fine. My toasted bagel with cream cheese was okay, but there wasn't a napkin in the bag. Seems like a silly oversight.",3
1769,"Food is what you would expect from a BB, staff is friendly enough but the prices are outrageous.  My boyfriend and I had to endure the drive thru because we were running late for our camping trip. My \""toasted\"" bagel was white and soft... before the addition of cream cheese. \n\nPrices are crazy! \n\nDon't be so lazy... drive down the hill to the GE... buy a 6 pack of bagels, cheese and some bacon for under 10 bucks!  You'll have left over food and cash",3
1770,"Received bad service today.  Got the wrong chase for my sandwich,  Got decaf tea instead of regular tea even though he was told black tea.  Usually you have to ask for decaf. \nHowever, lots of seats since the place was empty.  We left Einstein's because it was  crowded.\nThey Missed an opportunity to impress a new customer.  Guess it's back to Einstein's.",2
1771,Frequently get take out from this place. Food usually fairly decent. Except we found some type of flying bug in the bottom of our rice container. Called to complain and they offered 20% off our next bill and did not sound surprised by our find. Considering the money we have spent there over the years I was highly upset. But they seemed to care less. Guess I have to drive to sesame next time.,1
1772,Consumer alert... rats!,1
1773,"This Starbucks is in a strip mall at the bottom of Greentree hill and unfortunately has the unlucky fortune of being a hangout for the most obnoxious group of men who come into the store early in the morning, nurse a cup of coffee all day, take up all the chairs, and gobble up all the free samples of pastry that the baristas offer. It's really a shame too because this Starbucks has a fireplace with a nice fire working during the cold months. In the evening when the old man unemployment club leaves is a great time to visit. If not for the \""I can top that\"" club that come in everyday and tell the same old stories over and over IN SUCH LOUD VOICES, this would be one of my favorite Starbucks in the Burgh.",2
1774,"This Starbucks is right down the street from my parents house. It's gotta be my favourite location in the Pittsburgh area. I read Joe D's review and laughed a bit. He's right...there are some guys who sit in there, but have you ever said hello? Have you ever asked them if you could sit down? They're totally nice guys! The baristas here are really efficient (most of the time) and super friendly. They're on top of their game and even remember regular's drink orders.",5
1775,"I've been coming here ever since I can remember. The Baristas seem genuinely interested in your well-being. They all have great personalities and are a joy to talk to when I come in. Dan, while appearing super intimidating (spiky black hair, wears leather jackets and stuff) is extremely nice. I went away for college and when I came back he asked me all about it. Becky always remembers my orders and Astrid makes my iced coffee just right. I could sit in there for hours and I often do.",5
1776,"Panera does a nice job on some items.  Stopped to have lunch with a friend who wanted to use the WiFi and get a bite to eat.  \n\nKind of a soup type day, rainy and cool...so had a bowl of low fat veggie...very nice and a greek salad that is pretty good.  The best part was the fresh baked bread.",3
1777,"I know a lot of people tend to either love or hate Panera; I happen to love it - the You-Pick-2 combo is one of my favorite lunch options. And as luck (good or bad depending on how my diet's going!) would have it, this location provides a daily opportunity to get one of those combos! This location is incredibly convenient for me - both for being relatively close to where I live and for being next to an old bookstore, clothes store, and a few other businesses - and has earned all 5 stars for being a bit better than the average Panera. \n\nOne, I've never walked in here and found a shortage in sweet treats, which is a common problem if I want an afternoon bagel in a lot of other Panera locations. Two, the sandwiches here just taste fresher than a lot of other places I've been to. Three, as others have mentioned, the staff are just nicer here - I have no idea why, but I'm not complaining! Bonus star for this Panera because it's actually made its entire interior comfortable and encourages people to relax and use its wi-fi, which is something I can't say a lot of other locations have nailed just yet.",5
1778,"Oh, I like Panera. I love their you pick two combos. Awesome grilled cheese and tomato soup and desserts. It's a nice place to hang out while you're waiting for your car to get inspected.",4
1779,"I used to love Panera but as the years have gone by their standards of both food and service has declined greatly. It's a gamble if you are going to get good food and service or if the D team is working that day and they serve cold soup and sandwiches that look like Stevie Wonder  made them. I have to be deserate now to go there, like travelling on the Ohio turnpike and my other rest stop options are burger king and popeyes. Coprorate needs to improve and manage  their quality control,training, and processes. It's like they came out with a bang and now are just coasting.",2

1781,"Ya Gotta Regatta! It's Pittsburgh's mid summer July 4th celebration. Once it was the largest inland regatta in the nation with an average 1 Million people visiting for the four day event. Scaled back these days for reasons I won't get into, the annual summer spectacular features boat racing, anything that floats contests, a lighted boat parade, concerts, and the huge July  4Th fireworks display. Best of all, it's free!",3
1782,"Once enjoying my crisp cool water. Our orders were taken promptly, I ordered the chicken club and customized it with a side of coleslaw. My better half had the fish sandwich with a coleslaw as well. The food came like the wind, the coleslaw was damn good! The best. Our sandwiches couldn't have been better if Jesus himself made them. All around it was the bee's knees.",4
1783,When trying to think of where to go for a steak dinner The Greentree Inn came to mind. I had never been here in all the years of living so very close. I was glad I chose this establishment. Food was excellent and I loved the feel of the place,4
1784,"After a long enduring 12 plus hour trip to Pittsburgh, my shuttle driver told me about the delivery service at Vincent's and suggested their food was worth checking out. Overwhelmed with work at that time of the night and unfamiliarity with the area prompted a quick call for their Ad's Rockin' Pasta ($17). I was initially told the delivery would arrive in 45 minutes to an hour, but the food came knocking on my hotel room sooner than expected. \n\nThe complimentary mini garlic buns were cooled by that time. It was over-buttered but yummy nonetheless. It was a delight to see the whopping serving of pasta after not having anything to eat all day. Thankfully it was kept warm by the plastic container and comforting with every bite. The generous servings of angel hair was filled to the brim with juicy chicken slices, very few shrimps, mushrooms, roasted and hot peppers drenched in a mild marinara sauce. The flood of sweet and semi-savory marinara was not the ideal and the peppers also did not make an impression. The quality of the pasta was overcooked and oversoaked, but the pieces of chunky chicken were tender and delicious. The side salad did not look very fresh and was not newsworthy.\n\nI didn't get a chance to visit the venue to get a better impression of the establishment, but as a delivery service I thought it was fast while portions were very generous. Value wise, kudos to them for having a $5 children's menu for those at the ages 2-10. For my dish however, I still consider it overpriced for what was supposed to be their fanciest pasta dish. 2.5 stars for the experience.",3
1785,"Nice, clean local place in Green Tree. Might be a little pricey but the food is good and homemade.",4
1786,"Service wasn't very good, and their (advertised) delivery was not available (because the delivery drivers car broke down). Maybe as a sit in it would be ok but I was not impressed",2
1787,I'm usually in Pittsburgh once a year and each time I come to town I typically have Vincents. Their NY Style thin crust pizza is just awesome and the service is typically pretty good. Regular crust is good as well if you want  something a little bit thicker.,4
1788,"Have mixed Vincent's.  My meal was good (spicy pasta) but service was spotty.  Another in the party had the homemade gnocchi and it was not good at all, \""tastes like dishwater\"", was the quote.  Naw, that couldn't happen to homemade gnocchi, after a taste, I agreed!  Just goes to show, it depends on what you order.\n\nOh yea, the parking lot, very big but some customers parked in the entrance on both sides to make it one lane and of course when we were leaving we noticed that one guy was taping his car where it had be hit.",2
1789,"Who knew french fries came on salads? Pittsburgh did.\n\nSalads are good. Pizza looked tasty. Service is helpful (when you can find it).\n\nThe pepper steak salad is pretty good - get it with ranch. Or instead, just get a plate of those garlic knots. They're the best thing there.\n\nAnd the comment about helpful service - when I went to pay the bill it was too windy for me to leave it out on the table. Instead I went inside and it was a no-man's land. No person working could be found for a good three minutes while I stood there with my bill in hand. I mean, what kind of place is dead empty of all wait staff, bartenders, or any person who worked there for that long during the lunch rush? Seems odd.",4
1790,"Not a bad place to grab a bite for lunch. Their service can be kind of slow so dont plan on having a quick in and out lunch.\n\nGreentree does not have many options for food, which is surprising since there is so many office complexes. \n\nOverall not bad.",3
1791,"The inside of Vincent's has the distinct smell of wall-to-wall carpets and fried food - not necessarily 'bad,' but certainly pungent.  I'm glad we came here on a nice afternoon when the deck was open.  \n\nWe split fried zucchini, which was delicious, sliced really thin with homemade marinara for dipping.  I got the buffalo chicken sandwich and my dining companion got the italian calzone.  Both were good - fresh ingredients and lots of them.  The portions were absolutely huge.  \n\nOverall, the service was fine - no major issues.  Good place for casual dining and good bar food.",3
1792,"Overpriced, very slow service, food was decent.",2
1793,"Expensive, slow, but good food if you don't mind the wait or check.",3
1794,Food is mediocre service is lousy. I'm sitting here right now and have been out of water and done eating for 20 min...,2
1795,Service was good but probably the worse pizza I've ever had.  We couldn't eat it.,2
1796,I went for dinner July 10.  Tight quarters inside but nice outside covered porch..Small inviting bar. Parking lot is full of potholes. It wont take much to fill with small stones but nothing has been done for years. It would be nice for customers to the fill potholes. \nFriendly staff . I ordered a Italian Hoagie and my wife had Spinach Ravoli. Waitress was nice but never asked to refill our drinks. My hoagie was dry with min meat. Bun was OK. My wife liked her salad. Both was very avg food in tight spaces and service could have been more attentive. Probably wont go back.,2
1797,Just moved to the area so I am looking for a go to spot. Vincents isn't going to be it. The food wasn't great it was just ok. I had the italian sausage. The prices are reasonable and I got my food in a timely manner but no personal customer service. I sat at the bar and literally no attempt to have any dialogue except get my order. No other options ill go back but that's it. Or I may try pizza and have it delivered.,3
1798,"We stumbled on this place on a Friday night. The place was moderately busy, but we were seated right away. The server was friendly, but service was pretty slow considering how many servers were working. We ordered the artichoke hearts to start - I recommend staying away from those! They were around $9 and had obviously just come from a can and had some Parmesan cheese sprinkled on top. The rest of the food, however, was delicious! We ordered the spinach pizza with white sauce and an Italian calzone. They were both HUGE and the pizza was one of the best I've had.",3
1799,Great old-school donut shop with delicious donuts.  The even still tie up the boxes.,5
1800,"HOLY MOTHER OF DONUTS! This place is amazing. My daughter and I stop every Friday morning, and honestly, it's the highlight of my whole week. Donut holes are to die for, but everything here is good. Like other reviewers said, get here early because they go fast!",5
1801,"The old fashioned sour cream... bavarian filled... glazed and cake... OMG so good. Seriously, all of them! This little shop is right in the middle of a neighborhood. I can only imagine the temptations of living so close to the intoxicating smells that waft out of there each morning. \n\nWe got there about 5 minutes before 7, thinking they would open at 7. There were already 3 people in line. The doors finally opened up about 10 minutes after 7, I guess you can't rush something so wonderful. A dozen tasty gems were carefully chosen... better give us a dozen doughnut holes too! Every last bite was terrific. \n\nPittsburg, I hope you realize how lucky you are!",5
1802,A while back my Mom bought some donuts from here and they were really stale by the next day.  She called and mentioned something about it to them and they didn't even seem to care.  I like to try and support local business but with an attitude like they showed I have no use for them.  Doesn't seem to be any real set hours so you never know when they will be open.,1
1803,"The Pennsylvania Turnpike caught me on a good day. That is, its typically unbearable narrow and worn-down roadways cluttered with \""wide loads\"" in various forms were temporarily mitigated by periodic signage noting \""PA TURNPIKE: ALL TOLLS WAIVED.\""\n\nThe suspected reason for the free ride? The other major highways in Pennsylvania are shut down due to persistent piles of snow. STILL. Hey, I'm not complaining.",3
1804,"So how can you write a review for the turnpike? Everyone hates it...and unfortunately I drive it frequently. Word of the wise...drive this road in the daytime, when it's not raining. You will thank me later for this advice...\n\nAs mentioned by others, this road is not in the best shape. It seems like every couple of miles there's construction. Not anyone working on site...but hey, you still have to slow down. Another issue...most of the roadway is 55 mph. This drives me insane...because in certain spots it's 55, and in others it's 65. Luckily I haven't had any speeding tickets here...but my warning, be aware of your speed.\n\nThe toll booth operators are ok, for the most part. You will get those with the evil attitudes. Like, I'm sorry I disturbed you...but lady you're the only one open. I'll make sure to sign up for EZ Pass so I can bypass you.\n\nAnd lastly...the price. So back when I was in college I frequented this road, from Pittsburgh to Philly and back. I believe the amount one way was between $12-15. Now...one way? Goodness I don't know the price...but let's put this in perspective. I now only drive the Pittsburgh/Breezewood route...and it's  $12.60 one way. And this isn't even the halfway point to Philly. \n\nIn theory you can bypass the turnpike by driving I-80 but this road is impassable if it's snowing. And there aren't as many rest stops. So PA knows you have no choice...and will charge you whatever on the turnpike. \n\nFYI - prices are scheduled to go up Jan 1 2015. The toll booth operators are clueless as to how much the increase will be. One toll booth operator was snippy with me when I asked her. Oh well.",2
1805,"Darren's recent review of Kmart got me thinking about this place. I was out this way recently and I stopped to look for a place to eat. Man, talk about a dead mall! Parkway Center Mall even has its own listing on www.deadmalls.com I'd only been here once or twice back in its heyday. Back then it had Chi-Chi's (where thankfully I never ate. A hepatitis scare did them in), David Weis, Pharmor, CompUsa, Syms, etc were all here. \n\nNow the mall is mainly deserted. Only one floor is still open, and even that's got a vacancy rate of about 50%! Surprisingly what remains seems to be doing good business. Kmart is doing okay as is the Giant Eagle. Phantom of the Attic is alive and well and so is Pittsburgh Sports Deli. That's not an eatery either. It's a sports memorabilia store. \n\nThere wasn't much reason for me for me to linger here though.  I soon left and went over to Olive Garden for lunch.",1
1806,"What a depressing shell of a mall... \n\nI remember when it was *the* mall to go to... CompUSA, Pharmor, Kmart, Playless, Joann Fabrics, ChiChis, Giant Eagle... \n\nHell, CompUSA, ChiChis and Pharmor don't even exist anymore... I'm not sure if Kmarts are still in business. \n\nDead malls are sad, for some reason. Walking through this mall just creepy though.",1
1807,"Truly the worst mall in America.  Going here is like being in a time machine though.  There is a store called \""90's Nails\"" for goodness sakes.\n\nHow is this place even still standing?  For one, I'm pretty sure it's built on an old mine or dig or something.  My mom has told me you can feel the ground move when you are here.  Yikes!\n\nThe Sports Deli is actually a gem of a store though.  Man, the rent has to be so cheap!\n\nI got to give a shout out to Petland (I think that's what it is/was called) the pet store in this mall where we got our Maltese pup Sno-Flake 17 years ago!  What a great dog!  :)",1
1808,"Honestly I don't consider this place a mall. I consider it to be the entryway I have to use to get into K-Mart. Sadly there are a few stores left still lingering around but hey, I'm sure the rent is reasonable considering the land is falling apart. Calling it a mall is like calling me an athlete it simply isn't true. When you can lists off the name of the stores on your fingers and still have a few left over then you need to go somewhere else.",1
1809,"Oy vey! Stay away, there's nothing here to see. Kmart, Phantom of the attic and a lottery place. This mall is dead! Deader than dead, dead dead!",1
1810,"I certainly have stayed in worse places, but they generally didn't cost $100 per night. \n\nTo be fair--the place is clean. The temperature was good. It's just small and old. The carpets are threadbare, in places. There is no restaurant, and no obvious nearby place to eat--I ended up driving around for a while before I found something. \n\nThe people who work here are very friendly, and as the previous reviewer wrote, it's got a manager's happy hour (which I arrived right before the end of), and a fitness center & pool. You have to reach the fitness center and pool by going outside, though, and in the middle of February, that's not so attractive. \n\nThe mall that is nearby is not really a mall. It's got a Giant Eagle and a KMart, but all the other businesses seem to have closed. Even the ATM was boarded up, which is really not a good sign.",2
1811,"Not a bad place, but here is the good an the bad.\n\nThe bad: The light in our room didn't work. It's not very close to pittsburgh. Hotel requires updating. \n\nThe good: Hotel was a great price. The gym was huge for hotel standards with large locker rooms. Decent free continental breakfast in the morning and a free two drink happy hour in the evening. Friendly staff. Free shuttle to events in the city. \n\nOverall I would stay here again.",3
1812,"My husband and I stayed at the Best Western Parkway Center Inn for a U2 Concert at Heinz Field. We realized that the room was going to be extremely small based on the reviews, but I think I was taken aback as to how small it really was. The hotel was clean on both the inside and outside. Although our room was down a very narrow corridor and a joining room to another room, it was clean and updated with a nice flat screen TV. We had Bath n Body Works products, which I use at home. The best part of the hotel was the free shuttle to and from the concert. I hate having to drive in traffic and parking would have cost us a pretty penny. The staff are wonderful! Very friendly and accommodating.  Apparently there is free breakfast from 6am-9am, which we were told about, but didn't get to take advantage of since we overslept. There is also a pool which we missed because we weren't at the hotel long enough. We did get to take advantage of the free wii fi which was very nice. The purpose of our stay was a place to sleep and for this purpose, this hotel served us well. However, if you intend on staying an extended amount of the time at the hotel, I would suggest elsewhere. The quaint room made me feel very claustrophobic. As well, there aren't any places to eat near. I would stay there again for a reason of a place to crash after a concert or something similar. I wouldn't recommend staying with a family at this facility because of it's size, unless you can get a bigger room or a couple rooms at once.",3
1813,"We stayed here in an effort to cut costs (being competitors, we are always trying to cut costs...), and we weren't disappointed.  Our room was clean, the fridge was an adequate size, and we had a microwave and coffeemaker, plus free internet.  Another bonus was that we were relatively close to the downtown area without being part of that congestion.  The decor was pretty neutral, which was a nice surprise.  The staff was also pleasant and friendly.",4
1814,"The rooms are laid out weird, and for the cost the rooms are not worth it.  There are also not many place to eat around the hotel.",2
1815,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know.  Why go to the Olive Garden when Pittsburgh has so many great local Italian places?  Hey, it's convenient and the food is decent.  For lunch, Olive Garden ain't bad in a pinch!   I had business to go to near the airport and I stopped here out of necessity.\n\nI had the basic spaghetti & meatballs in marinara sauce.  Not bad.  I wish they had cups of soup 'cos the Zuppa Toscana was mighty tempting.  \n\nOkay, so I admit I like the Olive Garden.  But my husband better not take me here on date night!",3
1816,"I hate Olive Garden. It makes me laugh when they ask \""how is everything?\""  I wonder what goes through their minds when I say \""The microwave did an awesome job\"". I'm in town for a few days, I'm hung over and don't know where else to eat. Olive Garden is just gourmet ChefBoyArDee. You won't find me at an Olive Garden back in New Jersey!",2
1817,The service was great while we were here. The food was average. And the parking was bad.,4
1818,"I normally don't like chain restaurants, but I do like eating at the Olive Garden in Greentree.  The food is pretty good here and the service is always excellent.  Although not my first choice, still quite okay.",3
1819,I ordered food that I believed was gluten free.  Within twenty minutes I started to have symptoms and was sick for two days.  I believe that my food may have been gluten free but that cross contamination caused my problem.  I had the same experience at another Pittsburgh Olive Garden restaurant and so am concluding that they may not be careful with cross contamination.,1
1820,"Avoid at all costs!  They diluted my wine with water, the food was mushy, they charged me $3.25 for marinara sauce from A CAN (without informing us beforehand this injustice would be taking place)!  Typical big corporation: cut costs down to last nickel and inflate the prices so the CEO can fly in his private jet (after landing, eat at a REAL Italian restaurant) and purchase a new Bentley each year.  \n\nVisit DeBlasio's Restaurant for twice the portions; it is MUCH CHEAPER, as well.\n\nWorst experience at a restaurant... EVER!",1
1821,"Being born and raised into an all Italian family, I'm pretty darn picky about my pastas and gravy (tomato sauce for the unknowing). My great grandmother's sauce was the first I remember, she never opened a can to make her sauces, always using tomatoes she canned herself in mason jars. She simmered her sauces until every seed melted away. My mother's sauce was a bit more thicker, using puree and paste as a base, later adding whole peeled tomatoes, garlic and fresh basil. Her sauce cooks down to a velvety pasta sauce that should be jarred and sold on super market shelves.\n\nSorry on to my review of Olive Garden. seriously? Really? No! I will admit it's good in a fit of really, REALLY needing a pasta fix, or if you want to eat breadstick and salad. But the sauces are overly rich, and I don't mean the tomato sauces. I mean the sauces they put over the pasta with chicken, beef or fish. And, let me be real Italian here, pasta is NEVER the main meal in an Italian supper, Pasta is normally the first course and NEVER served with meat, including MEATBALLS. Thats as American as fortune cookies. after pasta, comes the protein, that includes meatballs, then finally salad.\n\nOkay, I'm done being a snooty Italian who looks down upon Olive Garden, I got out all my frustrations on you, my readers. But seriously, if you want good Italian food, hit up a REALLY good neighborhood, family owned Italian restaurant. The service is better, it will be cheaper and it won't go to a big conglomerate who over charges on a plate of pasta, which is one of the cheapest food you can serve. Oh, two stars for a pretty good bowl of Pasta Fazoo (pasta and beans).",2
1822,Ten minute wait and easily most tables are open!!! Surprise it's lunch time!!!! I just passed six tables empty and clean. Beyond me...,1
1823,"Although I walked in with some hesitation (after a less than great stay at a Holiday in Columbus, OH) I am forever grateful for Chad who worked his magic and secured suites for my coworkers and I after a literal nightmare booking at the nearby Clarion (misrepresented on Hotwire).  This is the most fabulous H.I. Ive seen anywhere and the service is fantastic to boot.  This is a newly renovated space (used to be Best Western) but i love the lobby, the rooms, the free wifi, shuttle service, free breakfast and the fact that an elevator is always waiting for you in the lobby! If Im ever back in this neck of the woods Id be happy to stay here again. Keep up the good work guys and gals!",4
1824,"Beautiful hotel exterior and lobby. clean, spacious rooms, lots of closet space, 24/7 fitness hours, extended pool hours 6am-11pm.   Great complimentary breakfast.  Close to tons of chain restaurants and fast food and a couple of family-owned italian restaurant (Vincent's was delicious). I loved the location, access to parking, convenience,  friendliness of the staff.  It was almost perfect! \n\n The only downside (that's why 4 instead of 5 star) is that the rooms are DARK.  I had every light on and it was still pretty dark during a cloudy day.  It probably doesn't bother most people who will just come back to their hotel to sleep.  It is not too unlike other hotel rooms but it seems TOO dark. Not enough light to read from unless you are in the bathroom.",4
1825,"Hotel itself is adequate.  The 2 stars are for the hotel's internet connection.  I've stayed here twice in one week and both times were frustrating in terms of the Wi Fi. The connection drops numerous times in one session and connecting can be a chore. In terms of smartphones, don't even bother. My iPhone just refuses to fully connect and I've tried everything.  I stay at hotels continuously throughout the year  and this hotel has the worst internet configuration out of them all.\n\nThe staff is great and helpful but as someone who travels for business, the Wi Fi connection is crucial to my experience.",2
1826,"I was perfectly a-ok with this place*.  My friend's mother had suggested we not stay here, as it was \""shady\"".  I didn't give a crap.  I had a lovely view of some woods, I wish we had gotten back early enough to check out their lounge, and every guy going to see the Boss concert that night was staying here, so I got too see much more denim than I would on a normal day.\n\nDefinitely stay on the second floor though.  First floor looked way more nast.  \n\n*  Though ot had been a while since I'd left NYC, which when that happens, my judgement can be thrown askance.",3
1827,"This used to be the Holiday Inn and now it is the Clarion Hotel & Conference Center.  We needed to find a place not too far from Heinz Stadium for a reasonable price. We paid about $90 per night for this place, and the experience started poorly. We walked in and the two lobby TVs were tuned to Judge Judy (for the front desk employee's viewing pleasure). Employees watching reality TV during business hours really puts me off. It was hard to get the attention of the front desk staff because they were in the middle of a pizza order.  Two of the staff was working the front desk with a third suggesting toppings. It was pretty funny as one of clerks started to set up our room while another on the phone to the pizzeria kept interrupting the process with pizza questions. To the side the third clerk assisted with the pizza order. My wife pointed out her extreme cleavage, but I did not want to get lost there. We had a hard time understanding our clerk setting up the room. She tended to mumble, but did assert herself better when responding to pizza order questions. We finally got our room and headed up the very scary elevator to the 4th floor. In a way I felt as if we were at some sort of slum. I kept looking for gang tagging. The room was adequate (and I believe this was a renovated room), but a Motel 6 would be an upgrade. Whoever is doing the renovation has really poor taste and the quality of work is terrible. The swimming pool was a swamp (I am not kidding), but I am sure the frogs living in it were having a good time. The next morning we went down to the front desk again. This time the morning clerk was on a personal call and gave me an angry look because she felt that I was interrupting her call.  She did not even hang up; she just put the phone to her side, answered my question, and then continued her conversation. \n\nPersonally, I think this hotel would be great for a horror movie and Hollywood should contact this place. It needs to be knocked down, or management should tighten up the staff and improve construction quality. If construction is on track (and I suspect something is wrong), get staff that really is gracious to customers. There are people that need jobs out there and I assure you with proper management they will do a great job. Don't stay here for over $45 per night (the price is due to the breakfast offered). Personally I would not stay here until they fix the place, but for some reason I don't feel that it will ever happen. Something just feels wrong. Perhaps Clarion has stopped the remodel due to the economy.",1
1828,"oh. dear. lord. i feel so bad for the tour group from japan that was here .... this place is the dumps.  we had 2 rooms: they were supposed to be on the same floor.  nope. 2 different floors, took 6 rooms before we had 2 rooms that were NOT dirty.  One bed was unmade each day. Drunk frat rats.  AVOID.",2
1829,"Place is ok but a little uncomfortable. There's water damage in some corners of the the ceiling and it looks pretty creepy. There are stains on the walls and ironing board but, overall, it's ok. The bathroom was freshly stocked, toilet and shower was clean and functional, bed seemed to be bedbug-free and is comfortable enough to lay your head at night, TV worked just fine as well. The continental breakfast was ok but a little lackluster. The place is pretty much centrally located & it does have great potential..overall, it was an ok stay and I may stay again after they've completed the renovations.",2
1830,Umm lol so seriously I read some reviews about this place and was like NOOOO it can't be that bad. HA HA....DUDE! So this spot is like mad cheap but REALLY? \n\nFirst we check in and notice the are undergoing some much needed renovations. Checkin was seamless as it should be. We get to out room #122 and after reading the reviews I know to check the beds immediately. The first bed legit has hair under the sheets...strike 1. As I'm pulling the covers back on the second bed I find two quarters...that's right folks! Obviously left by the last guest intentionally to warn the next occupants that the SHEETS HAVEN'T BEEN CHANGED...let alone checked. I mean really? You couldn't at lease have made it look like you did your jobs?\n\nWe go to the desk and make them aware of the issue. They apologetically get us another room. This room is better its evident by the way these beds were made that the room has been cleaned. The elevator by the desk is stuck on the 3rd floor lol death trap so we take the stairs. Thank God for yelp....You've all been warned lol SERIOUSLY!,1
1831,"I was fine with staying here for the short time I was in Pittsburgh. The only thing that really bothered me, besides the really loud people at night the first night (really thin walls), was that there was no fan in the bathroom. It got really steamy really quickly and the only way to let out the steam was by opening the door. You can tell the bathroom was updated, although the sink was a little high for this 5 ft girl. The front staff was really friendly checking in and checking out. The pool was clean, for the most part. Bed was firm and pillows were soft. I brought my own pillow just because I sleep better when I do, but the hotels were perfectly fine to lay on. I think the location was great, easy to find and close to the city where we wanted to be. All in all a fine place to spend a few nights while sightseeing around Pittsburgh.",3
1832,"This was technically the Clarion hotel so I think the name is wrong on the page. \n\nI'd like to start by saying that I'm not much of a complainer, but if could have given 0 stars, I would have. \n\nSo we are on our way up to room when we passed a vending machine with water underneath it. I assumed it was leaking and brushed it off. I don't care that much about little things like that especially since we were just sleeping there. After a great hockey game and a bar crawl, we came back to the hotel and got ready for bed. There was absolutely no hot water for my shower. So cold I wouldn't even consider hopping in really quick. It was late so I let it go and decided to try again in the morning. When I woke up it was the same thing. At this point I was fuming. I NEED a shower man!\n\nSo I put on my angry pants and headed down the hall towards the elevator. Right in front of the elevator door there is a water fall pouring out of the ceiling from the third floor. \""What the hell....\"" is pretty much what I was thinking at this point. Well there was my shower considering I had to walk through it to continue on my quest. As soon as the elevator doors open to the first floor, I see the hallway is flooded. The carpet is squishing beneath my feet all the way to the front desk where other angry people had beaten me to. Apparently a pipe had burst the day before and they had neglected to tell us that when we had checked in. I was so mad. I managed to get 70% off our bill and I made her call to check us in at another hotel. I would have insisted the whole bill be paid for but I'm really bad at being mean to people. All in all, I will never stay here or any other branch of this hotel again.",1
1833,"We rented two rooms, one with a king bed and one with two doubles. The room with the King was fantastic, while the room with the doubles had a heater that wouldn't stop blowing cold air and was a stinkbug graveyard. \n\nWe asked and promptly received a different room. This one was cleaner but still had heater issues. \n\nThe front desk was very helpful providing  local restaurant recommendations and giving change for larger bills. The continental breakfast (free with room) was one of the most plentiful spreads I've had in a hotel. \n\nWe'd stay again, but we'll be sure to call ahead and make sure the front desk checks the rooms have been cleaned first.",3
1834,"we checked out 4 rooms just to see what it was like, moldy ceilings,  musty smells, unclean rooms, and such a huge renovation job it should be shut down or discounted by 99%! thank god hotwire gave us a refund.",1
1835,"Nightmare.  It's a ghost town. Needles in parking lot. \""Lobby\"" is a hotel room with undesirables hanging around. Asked to see our rooms before checking in, given the key, room was filthy.  Saw a sticky note re: bedbugs.  Bolted, as fast as possible.",1
1836,"I'm not sure I can even give this place one star. To be fair, the room we had was clean and comfortable. It did seem as if we had entered a time warp, though. Furnishings and bedding from the 70's...if not 60's! I've seen this place rated up to 3 stars on some websites. I'd like to know their qualifications!!\nWhen you first approach the hotel, it looks closed down. (And write obviously, it should be!!) You enter through a side entrance with hand written signs. The\""office\"" is a room right inside the doors. The hallway looks a wreck! (Oh yeah...they're under construction!!) Dirt, filth, and stains everywhere. Electrical wires exposed, smoke detectors hanging down. You look at all this and wonder how in the world are they passing codes?? (Or are they?!? Hmmmm)\nLike I said...the room was better..although not without faults. The lights over the bathroom sink did not work, and the shower did not work well. The tv was definitely a 1980's model. Wireless internet?? What a joke!! \nWhen we reported the bathroom issues, they said they would move us to another room. Since we were only staying 2 nights, we thought we would stay and just have maintenance look at it in the morning. We were informed maintenance would not be in tomorrow!! (Our ever??)\nWe told the lady working the \""front desk\"" that this hotel was pretty scary. Her reply was, \"" yeah, we get that a lot!\""",1
1837,"Ah, yes, what has yet to be said about this Clarion in Greentree, which is commonly known as the hotel of perpetual construction? Check the reviews folks (I sure wish I had) and you'll see that this place has been under construction for at least four years!\nMy family, and I'm sure countless others, initially had trouble even finding the place and had to humble ourselves to ask directions at the nearby Doubletree Hotel. But even with directions, we drove right past the Clarion because: 1). There are no hotel signs; 2). We were arriving at night and the building was completely dark; 3). There were no parked cars visible from the road; and 4). The entire front of the building was boarded up.\nWhen we located the correct driveway and approached the construction zone, which once represented the entrance to the hotel, we saw a tiny sign directing us to the \""Temporary Lobby\"" in the back of the hotel. The makeshift lobby consisted of a hotel room with a clerk sitting at a desk. The clerk initially could not locate our reservation on her computer, but found it as soon I had dug through my luggage to find a copy of the confirmation email.\nWe were given a room on the second floor, thus we walked past stairwells that were closed (because of endlessly drying 'wet paint') and an out-of-order (and leaking) ice machine, until we located the elevator. Well, let me tell you folks, Disney's Tower of Terror ride is less frightening than this elevator. It looked like one of those service elevators that the public never sees. The floor was covered in dead bugs and the ceiling had holes in it, leading to the conclusion that someone must have taken the globes off the ceiling lights and just dumped the dead bugs onto the floor.\nWhen we got to our room, the carpet was so covered with nasty grease stains that we wanted to keep our shoes on. We did the preliminary check of the beds and found some stained sheets, but thankfully no bugs. We also checked for the free Wi-Fi signal and found that it was completely useless (maybe that's why the desk clerk couldn't locate our reservation).\nFinding the complimentary breakfast in the morning was like a scavenger hunt, where you look for clues on small paper signs in the hallways. The adventure actually took me outside of the hotel and then back into another part of the building (thankfully it wasn't raining like it had been all night). I then realized that I had just entered the main construction zone and the outside route must be the only passable route to the dining area.\nThere was yet another sign outside the dining room which said something about Complementary Breakfast and the strange phrase \""Gratuity Included.\"" But inside the dining room there were at least two clearly-marked 'Tip Jars.' Now, I've been at some pretty trashy hotels in my travels, but I've never seen a tip jar in the dining room. I've also never been in a hotel dining room where it looked like a bomb had gone off, but there were drop cloths, power tools and all sorts of debris everywhere.\nWhen I got in line for the grub, I learned how the attendant earned her tips: she was there to help patrons identify the food. The person in front of me inquired about the gray-looking sausage-like links and was dutifully informed that they represented turkey sausage, adding, \""Because Clarion cares about your health.\"" I'm not kidding (who could make something like that up?). Anyway, I tried this so-called health food, because the only other hot alternative was French Toast and I did not want any syrupy food that morning. Guess what? The sausage had some kind of sugary additive to make the links taste like syrup! Real healthy, right? Thus, I ended up just getting a cup of coffee and returning to my room to pack up. The coffee was okay, by the way.\nIn conclusion, I would not have stayed at the Greentree Clarion had I not made prior reservations and had not been coming back after midnight following a music festival where it rained all day. Plus, we used our loyalty points for this room, so I couldn't even request a discount.\nBelieve me, HUD would shut this place down if it was an apartment building and the Dept. of Homeland Security would never even consider housing immigrants there. But, of course, you and I are welcome to pay upwards of a hundred bucks a night to stay there.",1
1838,"This was by far the worst hotel experience I've ever had. It wasn't just that there was MASSIVE construction going on, but they did nothing to accommodate for it. They put us in a dirty floor with exposed ceilings, spackle, and sheetrock everywhere. The lights were broken and the room was filthy. \n\nThe second room they out me in had an air conditioning unit that wouldn't reach the outlet, rendering it useless in the middle of the summer, had no toilet paper and water all over the bathroom floor. \n\nThe CHILDREN working the front desk, which was located in a hotel room, gave the worst customer service, greeted me with an attitude, and couldn't manage to pull themselves away from their own conversation long enough to even check me in in a timely manner. \n\nThe worst. Do not stay here.",1
1839,"Wish I could give this place negative stars. Where to begin? It begins with no signs saying where the hotel is at. And then it goes into their \""temporary lobby\"" which is a room turned into an office. The whole place is under construction which wouldn't be so bad, but my gosh they have crap EVERYWHERE!!! That leads us to the elevator. Norman bates would even say it's too creepy for him. It's marked with two different hotel names on top of that, holiday inn and ramada. Then the room. Not the worst of the worst, the decor is nice, the bed is as hard as a rock and the shower isn't even properly installed. Really wish I would have looked at yelp before booking here. Buyer beware. Oh yea! AND I knew they were under construction before we booked in June, and we were promised that the construction would be done before hand. Extremely disappointed.",1
1840,"What can I say about this place ? I have had several good experiences and several bad experiences here over the years .  All and all , you get what you see . The service is hit or miss depending on who is working . I do feel it is a bit expensive for the quality of food you get . The place is too small especially at the counter area .",3
1841,Really good bagels.  Stopped for a bagel and tea.  Place was crowded but the line moved quickly.  Had a Good Grains bagel with some cream cheese shmear.  Delicious.  Love the green iced tea!.\n\nThis place is tiny but most get it and go...no not get go! lol\n\nHave had soup and bagel sandwich in the past and it was very enjoyable.,3
1842,"I am always in Heaven when I go to Ithaca New York, after all, they have Ithaca Bakery there. Listen when I tell you, go to their website and request, demand, beg, do anything you can to get them to open one here in Pittsburgh! Seriously, the whole wheat Long Island bagels are pretty damn fine. Boiled, then baked a little darker than most bagels, then doused with garlic and onion, poppy and sesame seeds. Incredibly delicious! They're California Granola bagels are whole grain and hearty. The Italian bagels are like a mini loaf of Italian bread, covered in oregano, basil, rosemary, and garlic, they put olive oil in the raw dough, bellisimo! \n\nOkay, 359 miles southwest we have Pittsburgh with no visible sign of a decent bagel place, well that's not entirely true, Einstein Brothers has a good bagel, not a great bagel. Where Ithaca Bakery has 9 different vegetarian sandwiches, good luck trying to find anything like that here. \n\nWhen I did enjoy meats, my choice here was the Nova Lox with a shmear, tomato, onion on a whole wheat bagel. Not exactly a low cal meal, later I found out it had a whopping 700 calories and over 20 grams of fat. Even with the lite cream cheese this had 600 calories and 12 grams of fat. Now I have a whole grain bagel with hummus. \n\nI will say their pretzel bagels are rather good, nice crust and crunch from salt, a chewy center and makes an awesome pizza bagel.\n\nTheir bagels are pretty expensive, a baker's dozen and a container of cream cheese is over 14 bucks. In a town with a pizza joint on every corner, and an Italian restaurant in every community, you'd think someone would open an authentic bagel place with unique flavors and varieties.",3
1843,"What a crock!   The thin bagel (with asparagus/mushrooms, swiss)...you get mostly cheese...it doesn't look at all like the picture on your website depicting a load of asparagus smothered in mushrooms...so full of it; definitely not worth the price. \n(this was the one in Greentree)",1
1844,"I stopped here yesterday morning because I was attending an off-site training session.  Typical Starbucks.  On the way back, I bought some of that new Starbucks VIA instant coffee to try at the office.  VIA does not taste like brewed coffee, so Starbucks loses one star for that.",2
1845,"The barista was super sweet. I told her I wanted something new and she was a fountain of information. She made a lot of great suggestions and I told her to wing it. She went with a Caramel Brulee with two pumps of White Mocha. She also gave me a discount, which was awesome.\n\nI used an AirCard on the netbook and sat in Starbucks from 11am-2:30pm. I had headphones on and just zoned out. I was comfortable and wasn't disrupted at all.\n\nIt seemed to get busy from 1pm-2pm so if you want to stop at this location, make sure to get there earlier so you can grab a seat.",5
1846,"Worst effin Starbucks on the block and their baristas suck at making drinks. Horrible customer service and they ALWAYS screw up our orders. I just don't understand why they're so lazy. I understand their comprehension level is low because of the lack of education though. But, if you hate your job, don't take it out on the loyal customers! Your life sucks, we get it, but you have ONE job at Starbucks, so do it right. It's not hard.",1
1847,"Came here for a \""quick\"" breakfast on our way from the hotel to Fallingwater, and regretted the decision immensely.\n\nExtremely long lines, and poorly trained staff. As a former employee, I know about staff roles and approximately how long it should take to receive your drink. This staff was not trained at all, and it was clear that they were overwhelmed with the crowd. It took me 32 minutes for me to receive my order (there were 7 customers in front of me), and my order was incorrect. I ordered a small coffee, medium latte, a croissant and a sausage breakfast sandwich. I know that the sausage sandwiches heat up for about 40 seconds in oven, so I can't comprehend why it took so long to get my order. Would never come here again. I also received a WARM cheese danish instead of my croissant. First, the warm, creamy colored goo in the middle is extremely unappetizing, and second, they looked so dejected when I pointed out that I ordered a croissant I almost just left.\n\nDo not recommend.",1
1848,"Not exactly a fan of this location, however I tend to frequent it because of my work location, but I always leave unsatisfied.  The baristas are not friendly.  I'm always always always made to feel like I'm stupid (seriously?  i'm ordering coffee from you - who gave you a Masters Degree of all things brewed?)  and they're just rude.  Just.... rude.  I've never had an issue with my order being accurate, although again, just ordering coffee people.  I'm not asking you to recite the Gettysburg address.. in Latin.. backwards.  Just asking for a coffee.. congrats on getting it right!  I wwill also add that everytime I go in to this store, it smells.. bad.  real bad.  not like the delicious aroma of fresh brewed coffee.  No no.  You know those febreze commercials where they take the most disgusting atmosphere for smell and throw poor, unsuspecting victims in there to test the febreze-ee-ness of the area?  Yeah, it's like that.  Only with no febreze.  \n\nTo sum it up, I would suggest if you're in the area and need some starbucks in your life, take a few extra steps and go to the one on the corner of 6th and penn.  Those people are SUPER friendly (gave me a free coffee on new years day because I was on my way to work and realized I forgot my credit card after I ordered for me and my coworkers.. so nice!) and it smells like a coffee shop should smell - like coffee.  WHOA.. mind. blown.",2
1849,"MARKET SQUARE.....The slowest, most inaccurate Starbucks that I've ever seen....how can you write an order on a cup and still get it wrong....I saw 3 wrong orders (including mine) in the 25 minutes that I spent waiting...I was 4th in a line of 10",2
1850,"I wish someone had written a review for this place so that I would have not gone to it.  As a matter of background, I am originally from Los Angeles and have experienced some EXCELLENT nail salons there for much cheaper prices.  I don't know why manicures and pedicures are so expensive in Pittsburgh, but that's really a different path that I rather not venture into.  Anyway, this place is really small and they hardly have any nail polish choices.  It costs $15 for a manicure and $30 for a pedicure.  If you decide to go here, take my advice and take your own nail polish.  As for me, I picked out an OPI nail polish and they poured acetone in the nail polish to make it thinner!! I hate it when they do this, I guess its just their way of being cheap and not taking out a new nail polish.  The end result is that there are bubbles now on my nails and less than 24 hours later I just noticed that one of my nails has already chipped.  To make matters worse, their hot water was not working properly so they gave me my manicure and pedicure with pure COLD water.  The only positive thing I found about this place is that they accept credit cards.",2
1851,"regarding Shari's review: when i went they wouldnt even accept my debit card .  she was an older woman who i do not think knew how to use the machine so i ended up going across the street to pnc and using the atm.  it is not top quality work, they def over charge for the level of work they do...maybe that's bc their rent is high in downtown? it is about average price for nails though so doesnt hurt the pocket...but there are alot of places that do better for the same price.  its a convenient location so i would go back if i needed a last minute job, but def not my first, second, or third choice.",2

Obviously you left me with completely a mishapen eyebrows which I had to have someone else fix because you botched mine. I cried, I weeped, i found myself in the fetal position.

First the woman rushed through my \""manicure.\"" I'm not sure they have any type of sanitizer for their instruments as she kept pulling things out of her drawer. The manicure was very quick and not at all thorough. Once she started to paint my nails she kept having to fix them because she was in a such a rush. She took off polish that was on the nail and then pushed my hand into the UV dryer. When she went to put the top coat on my Shellac she put the Foundation coat on 2 of my nails before she realized and wouldn't fix them saying they will be fine. During the entire process she did about 6 eyebrow waxes and then would forget where she was in my process. She also kept forgetting to turn on the UV dryer to the point where she walked away and I had to turn it on.\n\nDo not go here. If I could give it 0 stars I would.",1
1854,"Adequate and could be best in the area, but definetely not in New York league. The space is the best thing about it- large, new and beautiful decor.  They have good products too like Bumble and Bumble but they also push the Kerastase on you, which I don't like. For the value, the prices are very high with mixed results.  Ask about how much experience people have because there are some people with little experience (less than one year). I think Nicolette is the best- has good experience and she did a great job.  Tried the owner Jim and hair came out brassy orange instead of blonde.  When came back to have it fixed, he handled it poorly with me. There is something to be desired for the customer service overall- have definetely had sub-par treatment at front desk and others.",3
1855,"The only reason I like this Salon is because I've finally found a stylist that cuts my hair okay, Kara. I used to go to one of those grandma salons that only old women go to and cuts your hair for cheap (I even got a discount for being a student).  However, since it closed down, I hadn't been able to get a decent haircut in Pittsburgh (I've had to wait to go back to California to cut my hair).  I've actually tried this salon prior to getting Kara and I left very unhappy (my hair looked like it hadn't been cut at all and I had to pay $50+ for it).  However, I decided to give MCN another try and get an appointment with Kara based on other Yelp reviews, and I was not disappointed.  She didn't require a lot of instructions regarding what I want and she cut my hair just the way I wanted it, even better.  I love her!",4
1856,"I got a good haircut here a few months ago, so this one-star review is not intended for the stylists.  It is a response to a strict no-returns policy on salon products, which makes me pretty mad: I couldn't have known they recommended the wrong product without trying it, and now that I tried it, they won't refund my purchase.  Catch-22.  I came in to buy a replacement for my normal bumble and bumble curl creme for thick hair, and was told by the receptionist that bumble and bumble's \""defining creme for fine curls\"" is the new packaging of that product (which seemed weird to begin with...thick hair..fine curls...) Nope, it's totally different and it doesn't work for me.  I used it twice, figured that out, and now I'm stuck with an expensive product I can't use. I called bumble and bumble and they told me that the product I use has been discontinued.  All my previous salons in other cities would have honored a return in this situation.  I won't be back to MCN.",1
1857,"I, too, decided on MCN based on Yelp reviews after moving to Pittsburgh. Unfortunately, I did not have the great experience others did. I ended up getting probably the worst haircut I'd had in 10 years. It ended up a good 4 inches shorter than I discussed with the stylist. In addition, she took the fact that I work in a professional office to mean that I wanted an ugly, boring, mom-ish haircut. It's taken almost a year to grow back to the length it was before. I admittedly should have complained then and there, but I'm a wuss. \n\nAdditionally, the experience at the salon left much to be desired. I went in the late morning on a weekday. There was a little girl there (around 3 or 4) with her nanny. Apparently her mom was a regular customer. The little girl was getting a haircut and she cried and screamed for 25 minutes. I know kids will be kids, and I don't blame the little girl for being scared or cranky. I do blame the salon for not finding a way for the girl not to disrupt the entire salon - taking her to a back room, taking her outside to calm down, not allowing children in an adult, supposedly high-end salon, etc. Something that was supposed to be a treat for me turned into a headache.\n\nI will not be back here, but it seems like others had great experiences.",2
1858,"This is the first place in Pittsburgh that has gotten my hair right. They were courteous, up front about their pricing structure, the location extremely convenient. The elevator up is a little sketchy, but the inside the salon is lovely. I am scheduling my second appointment right now!",5
1859,"Very, very pleased with the service I get at MCN. I've been a customer for several years. Sara K does my hair and she's so good. She puts up with my craziness (we did purple for awhile) but also is fine when I go back to just my brunette self. I love the stylists, they're very friendly, and I find the price to be comparable with other high-end salons. The atmosphere is trendy and hip and the salon is always clean. The owner is super-friendly and is usually working. \n\nHighly recommended!\n\nThank you!",5
1860,"1st time here. Got my hair did tonight! I'm an oxymoron I work in cosmetics, do professional makeup and skincare, have access to all the wonderful anti aging lasers, injectibles, botox, fat melting machines, but then I hate wearing makeup, getting procedures done, and let my hair grow out without a visit to the salon that is long overdo. I'm still that little tomboy climbing trees, I guess. Low maintenance by weekday, then I bust out the fabulous by night. \n\nThe point being that I had let my hair go for quite awhile and the groupon just came out yesterday after I had made my much needed appointment! Already scheduled, groupon the day before my appointment, and I got a great haircut! Triple score! Plus they have pets hanging out! Quadruple SCORE! Places where you can bring a pet to work are super cool, I like the laid back implication for the business. \n\nHeather was my stylist and we hit it off amazingly, I gave her advice about skin treatments that would be right for her and she explained what kind of cut would be best for me. I asked about extensions because I have been curious to try them but she said the clip on ones would be better for my hair type. I appreciate that she gave me the truth straight up. I don't want my hair getting damaged after the things I have done to it! She gave me a modern chick look that I love, I can have a soft wavy romantic look, or I can straighten it and pull out the chunkiness for an edgier look. Thanks Heather, it's so easy and manageable. Prices seem pretty standard for this type of place around $45-55 per haircut. Can't wait to see what we do next!",5
1861,"The salon is nice, and the people were great, but I was not impressed. The haircut was mediocre, but the highlights were much worse. They didn't even cover up all of my roots! I don't know much about hair, but the place I went before I moved always made great suggestions and chose highlights that were perfectly suited for my skin color and for the season. MCN failed to do this in a big way.",2
1862,"Being new to the city, I went into panic about finding a new hair stylist. SF and Boston have plenty of reviews to choose from but Pittsburgh didn't have many, let alone stellar reviews on salons. At the time I colored my hair so I didn't want to let just anyone put foils and scissors near my head. Finding a new hairstylist is like a game of russian roulette to me. I can either be safe or be really screwed for a few weeks.\n\nMCN was really the only salon ranked high in a search in my neighborhood so I gambled and scheduled an appointment with Sara. The salon is located near a Whole Foods, Starbucks, Walgreens and what use to be a Borders. It is clean, spacious and open with nice views overlooking the city.\n\nSara did a great job and continues to do so (I'm loyal like that). She consults me first and doesn't deviate from what we agree upon. Her demeanor is professional and friendly. While I was waiting for my color to process, MCN has some outlets for you to plug in your computer to pass the time.\n\nReasonably priced and another nice thing is that MCN occasionally will give free goodies as a thank you or for the holidays. While certainly the do is most important, the little things count as well. I will say though that they do seem a little pushy with product and the product may not even be the best one for your hair. I know salons can make a great profit off of product from the show Tabitha's Salon but this can ruin your experience at MCN after an awesome haircut/color treatment.",5
1863,"First haircut in pittsburgh, and absolutely one of my favorite cut!  I had heather, one of the senior stylist, and completely adored her. She was very personable and had constructive advice on my hairstyle.  She definitely was able to come up with the perfect style to frame my face just by listening to what I wanted.  A picture wasn't even necessary. Definitely would recommend her.  Also the salon is beautiful with a gorgeous view.  Staff was super friendly.",5
1864,"So...I was sold on MCN Salon about a year ago, and found it through Yelp reviews.  I really was sold at one point.  It's clean.  It's up-scale.  It's hip.  It's pretty.\nBut after my last haircut, I'm going to suck it up, and make the 45 minute drive back to my old stylist in Peters Township.\nBasically - I just feel like they're trying to up-sell you the entire time on products and more services.  For example, if I wanted my eyebrows colored, I probably would have added that to my appointment.\nTheir stylists are GREAT, don't get me wrong, but I just don't feel like I'm being pampered or focused on when I'm there.  The last time, my stylist was working on 3 different people while I was getting a cut and color.  Therefore, that left junior stylists to wash and dry my hair.  The time before that, the stylist was working on 2 different people.  I have no problem with that - I just don't know who to tip at the end because I feel like my main stylist, actually did very little in the long run.  \nPlus - I told my stylist on our very first visit - \""I don't want to think about my hair.  YOU are the STYLIST!  YOU are the DESIGNER!  Every time I come in here, I will want a different hair cut, but I want YOU to do it.  You will NEVER hear me say, 'just trim it up and do like we did last time'.  So please, I trust you to just make me look HOT.\""\nWell - the whole past year that I have gone there, I have sadly just been given the same haircut all 4 times.  I HATE THAT!  I'm not a hair stylist.  I know most people are stuck in their old ways and never like to change their hair; however, I am not.  I LOVE getting new hair cuts.  I love going from long to short...or from short to growing it out.  I like change - especially with the seasons!  Give me some edge!  Make me look sexy!   (I never feel this way leaving this salon).\nPlus, every time I have gone for a cut and color, I feel like it has gotten more expensive every single time.  I don't know what I'm being charged for...but my first session was a little under $120.  This past time it was up to $175 and like I said, I only go for a cut and color.  So I don't understand why my appointment is $55 more than it was 6 weeks before (and 6 weeks before I actually bought PRODUCT!).\nAfter 4 sessions, I can now say that I'll CANT WAIT to be going back to Stephan Szabo's in Peters!  That's worth the drive, the price, the experience, and the feeling of newness and pretty confidence!",2
1865,"Excellent Salon.  I went to Kara for curly hair as Nicolette was not available (this was my first visit:  I recently moved to PGH and used these Yelp reviews to help me pick).  She was perfect:  friendly, professional, and gave me the exact cut and color that I asked for.  It was just as I'd imagined it, only better because it was on my head!  And she KNOWS curly hair -- how to cut it, manage it, style it.  It is rare for me to feel so confident in a stylist. Absolutely worth it.  No complaints at all. Thank you Yelp!",4
1866,"I booked a hair apt here after reading some of the reviews on Yelp, hoping I'd find a place to get my hair cut after moving to Pittsburgh from NJ. Maybe it was just the hairdresser I booked an appointment with, but I did not have a great experience. I'm a nurse who works mostly day shifts, and I value sleep over styling my hair in the morning. I tried to articulate that I wanted a hair cut that required minimal styling on my part. The hairdresser immediately shot me down, asking me how I expected to have my hair look nice if I wasn't willing to put work into it. She then berated me for not using styling products-- again, I'd rather sleep. \n\nNow, maybe a few people feel differently about their hair, but all I wanted was a cut that allowed for minimal styling on my part. I wasn't asking for some trendy 'do that needed 3 different products, a round brush, and a flat iron in order to re-create it. I ended up getting almost the same exact cut I had going in there (just an inch shorter). Oh, and she also told me the cut I had coming in wasn't entirely flattering because of it's blunt ends--- funny, I ended up with the same thing. \n\nThis experience has definitely made me decide never to go back, for $50 I expect a little bit better service and a little bit nicer treatment. Oh, and somewhere that isn't constantly pushing products.",2
1867,"so i went here to be a hair model for a coloring class and was so impressed! my stylist, margeaux, was friendly, knowledgable, and talented. once i was seated in the chair, she offered me water and as i was getting my hair colored, another stylist offered me a brownie (who can turn that down?!). we talked about what color i wanted to go and the process began. margeaux was quick and efficient and the hair washing (always my favorite part) felt amazing! she blow dried my hair and i finally got to see the finished product which i was very happy with.\ni'll definately be back, and requesting margeaux, although i got to see the other models' finished hair as well, and i'm pretty sure every stylist there was super talented.",5
1868,"Newly relocated to Pittsburgh's east end from Miami, I wasn't sure where to turn for my hair.   I was nervous about finding talent, especially since my last few hair appointments in a new city had been less than stellar experiences. I was worried I would never find another stylist on par with the super star I had in Miami.  I couldn't let worry prolong the inevitable, however, with grey starting to peek out and ends beginning to split,  so  I did what anyone would do by asking around, reading reviews online and praying.   Upon leaving MCN Salon with my hair cut and colored to perfection, I can tell you my prayers were answered.  After reading other positive reviews about Sarah here on Yelp, I decided to book with her.   Although, I have a long, classic hair, I watched her work on a variety of other clients while my color was processing.   Her vision and talent seemed limitless as I watched her style a young child to a very punk rock female and an older more traditional man. It was very cool to watch her use her talent to shape each individual's cut to their preferred style and preference, which is what we all hope for in the chair but don't always get.   And, she does all of this for a phenomenal price.    I had full color, hair cut and blow out for $130 and was blown away.  I don't remember the last time I left a salon with the complete package for less than $200.\n\nFrom the check-in to consultation to payment and yes, rebooking I had an exceptional experience.  If you are looking for a salon and stylist in Pittsburgh, look no further than MCN Salon and Sarah!",4
1869,"I have been going to MCN salon for over 3 years now.  Since moving to the east end in 2008, I went to many salons and barbers trying to find a stylist that listened and responded with great technique.  Kara Hudson is that person.  She has been at MCN for quite some time.  Not only is she friendly, but she stays on task and always listens to new styles that I want to try.  I consider our monthly (or 6 week) visits a highlight.  Recently, as I am involved with philanthropic efforts in Pittsburgh, Kara donated services and product for an event I was promoting.  Now someone (a winner from the event I hosted) has the opportunity to experience Kara.  Win/Win all around.  Thanks Kara and the staff (front end, shampoo gals, owners) for always making me feel like family each time I come.  I will actually be there tonight!  #countingDOWN",5
1870,"I've been going to MCN salon for a few years now, and I have to say that it is truly the most fabulous salon in Pittsburgh!  The decor is gorgeous and gives off a spa like tranquility with a hip vibe.  The level of service is high from beginning to end.  My stylist is Margeaux, and if you're looking for gorgeous hair - go to her!!! She really takes her time to listen to what you're asking for and makes sure that your hair is styled to perfection before you leave.  I recently decided to cut off my long hair to donate to Locks of Love.  While I'm used to having long hair, she gave me a really cute cut and showed me how to style it at home (though I'm nowhere near as good at doing it as she is).  If you're looking for a great salon experience and amazing hair, go see Margeaux at MCN Salon.",5
1871,"I had an ok experience at MCN Studio.  I just moved to PIttsburgh from NYC and I relied on yelp to choose my hair salon.  I called MCN and asked to be seen by a senior stylist and the receptionist recommended Ashley.  I booked her for a cut and full highlight.  \nWhen I got there, I was pleased with the look of the salon.  It's trendy, clean, and has a good vibe.  I met Ashley and she was pleasant enough, although she seems a bit young to be a senior stylist.  But who am I to know what the credentials are to be considered \""senior\""?  She did a good job on the color and didn't do a terrible job on the cut, but I just wasn't wow'd.  She talked the entire time, which I don't typically mind and she's easy to talk to, but too much of the conversation was geared toward selling me product.  \nMy hair is straight and thin and I had previously gotten a stacked bob (which I hate and I'm trying to grow out).  She did her best to make it better, but it's still too stacked for my liking and is a bit uneven (found this out a week later when a different stylist was doing my hair for a wedding and fixed it).\nThe prices were a bit high for this area.  My haircut and highlight (she didn't do a full highlight, just partial which wasn't what I booked, but I didn't say anything so I'm somewhat to blame) came to $175.\nAlso, there was a lot of pressure to come back in 6 weeks.  I can't afford to get my hair cut and highlighted every 6 weeks and don't know anyone who goes that often.\n\nBottom line- my experience wasn't horrible and wasn't great. I will go back to give the salon a second chance, but will be trying out a different stylist.",3
1872,"I'm in search for the best stylist when it comes to curly hair. \n\nHere's is where I met the charming Kara last week, with whom I had a great consultation. I explained that I needed a haircut that was intended for curly hair, with layers and not so symmetrical. I wanted a cut while the hair was dry but I let her do what was best for her, knowing that most stylist don't work this way. So she cut my hair wet, dried it and finished while it was dry. I got a cut that's a bit too short (that's the problem with cutting curly hair while wet - it \""shrinks\"" once it dries) but I really like it!\n\nThe hair salon is very trendy. It was busy at the time I showed, one weekday afternoon. Two bulldogs came in after being walked and hang out at the back of the salon. I'm assuming they're the owner's dogs. \nHairdryers hung on of the mirrored walls. Very nice staff, specially at the reception area where they had beverages and pastries.",4
1873,"Me and my wife went to the salon for the first time for our haircuts, Ashley and Margo did our haircuts, they were pretty good. We are satisfied with our haircuts. But their honor is a very rude person, my two year old touched a plant placed in the waiting area, he came and yelled at him and said its very expensive, we felt really bad after that his dog was roaming in the salon and getting into people's stuff, which is not a good idea. I am allergic to dogs and there are people who don't like dogs. All the staff was nice and courteous. Though we like the services but we are not going back again because the owner has no manners and was very rude.",3
1874,"Ok so after coming here since March I finally feel ready to review. \n\nI started coming to MCN after I had my hair colored and cut by someone who absolutely destroyed my hair. I had asked for an ombr\u00e9 and ended up with a poop brown and bleach blonde wreck. The next morning I called MCN praying they could fit me on for a corrective color. They got me in with Leslee that afternoon.  \n\nI have linked some pictures but I don't know if they do her work justice. I went from having patches of bleached hair to the long ombr\u00e9 that I'd hoped for. Leslee spent hours on my hair color. It involved dying the roots the correct color, bleaching my end pieces blonde, and then toning the blonde from crazy yellow bleached to golden. \n\nShe took my hacked long layers and blended them while leaving as much length as possible. I was already overwhelmed with the change in color I was so glad she was able to salvage my length. \n\nI left that day with the hair cut and color I wanted in the first place and I was so so grateful! I've been going to Leslee since and I think she does an amazing job. Last time I saw her I ended up ditching the ombr\u00e9 and going to a \""fall\"" color. I wanted deeper brown with red. It's literally exactly what I asked for. \n\nI've also gotten an up-do for an event. I've never gotten so many compliments. And my long, heavy, thick hair stayed up all night. I've never had an up-do last as well. \n\nThe salon is beautiful. The staff is helpful. And Leslee is the best! I highly  recommend MCN and Leslee. 2 co-workers of mine now go to her and they are both very happy as well!",5
1875,"I go with three stars because the co-owner, Lisa, did a lovely updo for me for a wedding. People commented on my hair and I was pleased with the results. However, I had less than stellar experience with getting my makeup done with airbrush. Not only did the woman give my sister-in-law attitude on her wedding day because she didn't like how her make up was looking, she also spilled the liquid formula all over my white button down shirt.  She was apologetic but considering her work on my face did little to nothing to cover up my blemishes, I would not recommend getting make up done by her.",3
1876,"So I was walking around downtown wanting to find a place that does Shellac nails. I tried looking on Yelp to identify if any salons downtown offer it, but with no success. So off I went, and I stumbled upon Kenny's Nail Center/Salon. Apparently right now they are the only nail salon in downtown Pittsburgh that has shellac. \n\nAt first, I passed it b/c I didn't see any bright flashing lights saying shellac, but then I did a double take b/c on the window there is a small poster advertising that they do shellac. So I went in to confirm that they do shellac and to get the costs - as some of you know it can be pricey. \n\nThey did confirm they did shellac and that without a full manicure that the cost would be $25 (slight grooming and painting only). I'm not sure how much the manicure and shellac would cost, but I thought $25 was a good deal for getting a 3-week polish job. And from what I heard it usually costs $35-40 bucks a pop. \n\nThey were very busy and asked if I could come later in the afternoon around 2:15 PM (I went there initially at 12:30 PM) and I said that was fine - luckily I have some flexibility with work. So around 2:00 I departed work to go back to Kenny's. It seemed even more crowded so I was worried that I'd be overlooked, but they asked what I was there for and I said shellac and they said, \""oh yes, 2:15 sit down\"" and pointed towards a nail chair. \n\nSo I sat down and was greeted by Kammy - she was super nice and did an awesome job. I get a bit worried about some of these nail places cause they can do a pretty crappy job, but Kammy took her time (although it was clear she was very busy and people were waiting to see her). \n\nShe's the only one in the salon that does Shellac and she is there on Thurs., Fri, and Sat. So for my downtown working ladies (or men if you're in to that sort of thing) in the house - stop by and see Kammy to get a polish job that will be chip and smudge free for 3 weeks! \n\nMy nails look aaaaawesome! I got the bright pink color - I think it's called tutti fruity! \n\nOh and there was also a cute little girl that helped out after Kammy was essentially finished who put the oil on my cuticles and did the alcohol finishing step to make the nails all glossy. Be a star and make sure you tip her as well!",4
1877,"I mean...seriously? \nI should have known better given that it only had one positive review. My 600th yelp review, you think I'd've learned by now!\nI wandered in here looking for a pedicure. My first hint should have been the old crusty polishes on the walls - no Essie etc here. But whatever, I picked out my color and headed to the dilapidated pedicure chair. (I put my bag on the adjacent tray and it couldn't support the weight). They don't use razors here, which is fine, but I expected a thorough scrubbing of my callouses, and when she gave me a tiny little once over then unceremoniously threw my feet back into the water I thought to myself, OK there's no way on earth this is more than a $10 pedicure right? My heels still looked as bad as they did when I walked in. \nThen she painted my nails and sat me down at the \""dryer\"" which consisted of two tiny fans pointed at my feet. For real. I had to sit there for over ten minutes, she proclaimed my toes dry, then I paid - $25?!!!! For $25 in Boston where I'm from I could get a legit pedicure. I was dumbfounded. I paid, walked home, and lo and behold two of my toes already had smudged polish. ARGH!",2
1878,"I have been sitting here looking at the poor quality of my shellac manicure and I just had to write. I walked in to Kenny's nail salon this afternoon and was pleased that there wasn't a wait. They also provided very friendly customer service.\n\nHowever, my manicure looks terrible! It looks like I painted my nails myself, only even I could do better. The paint and clear gel is all over the underside of my nails and baked on, no less. I'm even finding paint on my fingers now. The nail technician, a female, didn't even touch my cuticles, but she did use an electric file to shave down the nail bed. I guess that's supposed to count for the cuticles? No frills, no hand massage, not even any moisturizer or cuticle oil or anything.\n\nI am horrified I was charged $25 and then I even tipped 20%. Now I'm wishing I would have asked them to start over, perhaps with a different nail technician. I won't be going back, however. At least I was in and out in 25 minutes. But what a terrible job.",1
1879,Very sloppy! No attention the polish is all over my fingers so disappointing and aggravating that now I'm going to have to pay more money else where to get them redone,1
1880,"They suck!! First of all not even 24 hours after I got acrylics one broke, then they painted on the french white tips which is fine, however they did such a poor job. When I came back to ask for a refund they were very rude about it and refused to help. I have gotten my nails done almost for a year and I have never seen such a poor job. DO NOT GO HERE.",1
1881,"The worst experience ever. I have never complained about my nails bc im pretty laid back but this was insane. The man that was doing my nails had an incredibly shaky hands, cut me more times than I can count, and have the nails literally one and a half times the size of my nail beds. I got pink and white and the white was not uniform among any of the nails and usually wasn't even uniform from one side of the nail to the other . . On 1 of my nails the white was 3 eights of an inch on 1 side and 1 eighth on the other. The equipment to scrub the nails was unsanitary and in a dirty cup. I have never had such a negative experience anywhere and I kept trying to explain what was wrong to the man and he just wouldn't listen. He did not smooth down any of the nails until the third time I complained about it. I spent $85 at the salon and have to go and get them redone by a different technician tomorrow because I don't even trust them to redo their mistakes",1
1882,"Lots of LCD HD Screens make this a good place to check out a game. The atmosphere is a little bland, but this bar is part of the hotel it's connected to, so you can't expect it to be too crazy. All in all decent bar.",3
1883,"I really like SoHo.  First off, it's located on the north shore and close to everything.  Nice bar, friendly staff, sleek and modern.  Great place to watch a game, LCD screens everywhere.  Skip the other appetizers and start with the angry shrimp.  They do a really good job with a filet mignon.  The salmon picata looked yummy, but since it wasn't mine, I didn't get to taste it.  If you don't want a big meal, they have all the usual sandwiches and burgers.  For dessert, have the banana bread pudding or some yummy chocolate fudge cake!  Or, if you're not feeling fancy, just throw back a few beers and bacon cheddar burger.  It's that kind of place, too.",5
1884,"Went here with a couple friends during a conference across the river. Service was typical for a this style restaurant, nothing spectacular.  Half off appetizers for happy hour so I got the sampler (again, nothing spectacular). Decent meal. My friend was disappointed by the his chili and the other did not really enjoy his buffalo pirogies. I might go back if I want some cheap appetizers and a beer during happy hour.  Seating outside was ok at best.",3
1885,Just above bar food but fine in a pinch.,3
1886,"Hotel restaurant/bars are usually not known for being the best in town.  So when I had the opportunity to eat and drink at SoHo recently, I can not say I was surprised that I found the cuisine to be on the uninspiring side.  Is it terrible?  No,  but you know that better is out there.  \n\nThe blackened chicken wrap was boring.  The flavor was missing and the entire meal was just bland.  Also, white tortillas just do not do it for me.  Why does it seem that Pittsburgh wants to thrive on fatty, flavorless food?\n\nUpon ordering the caesar salad on New Year's Eve, I was told that the restaurant has no non- or low-fat dressing option...at all.  However, I can order a salad with FRENCH FRIES on it.  Seriously?  The salad was fine, by the way, and is a large portion but knowing  that tons of calories had to be consumed just to get a vegetable in me was disappointing.\n\nOn the bright side, the smoked turkey wrap, which comes with havarti cheese and cranberry sauce was ridiculously good.  The turkey was juicy and melded perfectly with the cheese and cranberries.  That I could eat again and it would  fill me up all day.\n\nI also sampled the buffalo pierogies and really just found them to be the Mrs. T's ones with Frank's Hot Sauce on them.  They were good, but uncreative considering the price ($8.99).\n\nThe drinks here are decently priced and pretty good.  Friends I was with sampled a few of the drinks on the interesting cocktail menu and were happy with their choices...they were strong drinks.  When my co-worker and I arrived though one night to dine here, we were not offered cocktail menus so I just stuck with wine until I was no longer in the mood for a cocktail.  \n\nService on New Year's Eve was apathetic.  Granted, the place was packed, but we had  to wait for silverware and had our food and drinks pretty much thrown at us.  Even when it slowed down we were barely paid attention to and were hardly treated with any amount of friendliness even though numerous drinks and food orders were made.\n\nThere are a ton of TVs here, so it is a great spot to watch a game.  Even during busy times, there is a space for you but it will take a while to flag down a server to seat you if you want to sit.  \n\nI think I would stop back here if I find myself at the Springhill Suites again, but I definitely would not go out of my way to dine here.  Can't win 'em all, right?  \n\nPro-tip:  You can not access the restaurant from the hotel it is attached to (Springhill Suites) without a key and you can not leave the restaurant to get into the hotel without one.  Want some good people watching?  Sit and watch people try to get from one to the other without realizing you need a key.  Ridiculous.  Since you can access each of these places without a key from other doors, this does not make any sense.  But, it is what it is so do not forget your key!",2
1887,"SoHo is always a great place to start out at before heading to a Pirates game, or anything else going on in the North Shore. My networking group had a social here a couple of weeks ago - and it went awesome! We provided appetizers for the group - and they ended up bringing more than what we had ordered as a thank you. Also, we had almost 100 people They sectioned off part of the bar for our group, and were able to accommodate everyone with their drink orders in a quick fashion. They are SUPER easy to work with, and we are looking to hold more repeat events here because of that.",4
1888,"Another lunch spot for the northshore.  This probably has the best food.  The french dip and the wraps are very good.  It's a tad pricey but not horrible.  They're really good for pickup.  As is a constant problem on the northshore, service is INCREDIBLY slow.  You won't get out of here in under an hour if you dine in.  The waitresses are just MIA with refills and bringing checks, and the food takes a while to come out too.  But if you have time to spend, it's probably the best lunch spot on the north shore.  If you're running low on time - call ahead and grab it to go.",3
1889,"SoHo clearly relies on the Pirates crowd across the street, and Steelers and Pitt games. When there's a game, the place is packed. Other times, it doesn't seem so busy. The food has been OK. It's generally bar food, with an effort to be more. Execution is varied. \n\nTry the seasoned tuna sandwich with a side of parmesan risotto; just tell them how you want the tuna cooked because they don't seem to know and will overcook it.",2
1890,"Soho is very So-So.  \n\nRestaurants.com had a coupon for buy $25 for $10.  I snagged it but the conditions were annoying- spend $45 to get the $25 and no alcohol is included.  BOO!\n\nAnyways, I ordered the shrimp cocktail to start.  It was okay- 6 nice sized shrimp served in a martini glass with cocktail sauce and 2 lemon.  Not bad, the shrimp could have been a little colder.\n\nFor dinner Kev had the buffalo chicken wrap with onion rings and I had the cobb salad with a side of balsamic vin.  I like the cobb- avocado, chicken, pieces of bacon, toms, egg, lettuce.  It is good but nothing special.\n\nOur server was nice.....\n\nThe food here is just very blah.  The atmosphere is good to watch a game.  \n\nThat $25 coupon didn't get us very far.  We ended up paying $54 with tip and with the coupon!  I guess our bill didn't add up to what we needed it to be to get the full bang for our buck?  Still confused.......\n\nSo-so is nothing special.\n\nIt's not priced right to win me over.  Nor is the food good enough.",3
1891,"A number of the reviews here giving off the \""eh\"" vibe? That's because Soho is a kind of \""eh\"" place.\n\nI visited for the first time yesterday evening. My boyfriend and I decided to stroll over the bridge to catch some Jazz Live in Katz Plaza (Roger Humphries - really good show) and then headed to North Shore for some grub. Now, I don't find any of the restaurants near PNC to be that good (see my Bettis Grill review) so I knew we weren't going to find anything spectacular. We settled on Soho because I'd never been there before and Atria's doesn't appeal to me.\n\nI did like the open layout on the inside of the restaurant. Looks like a perfect place to catch a game. Finally - a halfway decent TV setup, Pittsburgh! The bar is ginormous and they seemed to have an extensive liquor and beer selection. The draft selection was lacking, but they did have quite a few choices in bottles, if that doesn't bother you. I did not check their wine list, but I know they do have one.\n\nMy boyfriend ordered a chicken stir fry and I got a cheddar burger. My first thought: \""These two things should never be on a menu together.\"" He said the stir fry was so-so. Ingredients were spot on, but it was lacking any real flavor. Someone mentioned this place as being a runner for best burger in town - huh?? There are a number of places I would put before Soho's: Winghart's, Burgatory, even Olive Or Twist! My cheeseburger tasted like a frozen Bubba Burger from the grocery store (you know the ones ... ). It wasn't terrible perse, but it wasn't particularly good, either. It was just so-so. The cheddar cheese on it was not very appealing - it tasted like one of those individually wrapped Kraft slices. Onion rings were tasty, but I've rarely, if ever, had bad onion rings.\n\nI would visit this place again if my focus were more so on watching a game and drinking than actually eating. Otherwise I say pass. In fact, skip into town over eating in the north shore at all.",2
1892,Stopped in for lunch before a Bucs game. Great service and food.  Hamburger was thick and juicy cooked perfectly.  Service is excellent.  I can highly recommend SoHo as your pre Bucco stop.,4
1893,SoHo Pittsburgh. Not SoHo NYC.  Was staying in adjoining Marriott property. Food was pleasant as was the service. Waiter was honest about the mediocre food. Crab cakes have too much filler. coworker had pork chop (seemed smaller than advertised. Dumplings were good. Wings looked okay. One at of our group had the french dip sandwich and liked it.  Deserts were pretty good.  Come with the proper expectations and you will be satisfied.,3
1894,Went here to watch the College National Champ game.  Was not as crowded as you would think but it was a Monday.  I didn't eat here.  Had a few drinks is all.  Cool place to hang out.  Would like to go here again,3
1895,"If 2-stars means \""meh, I've had better\"", then I'd have to give it 2 stars. I'd say if \""fine\"" in the slightly pained way the means \""how about we think of someplace else. \""\n\nNow, not that it's bad, because its not. A good beer selection, nice bar clean, nice staff.  Good place to watch the last round of the Masters. But if 3 stars means A-OK, I'd have to give 2.5.  The menu is uninspired, the food is ok but expensive, the decor is a little funny. \n\nBetter places on the north shore.",3
1896,We we're not impressed. The prices are high for what is bar food with no real uptake.\n\nService was neutral both visits (stayed in attached hotel).\n\nWould be willing to grab a cocktail but definitely better options around.,2
1897,"I wish i could give this place no stars! we sat for lunch after a lunch rush there were 2 other table in the restaurant besides ours, we ordered a blt with chili and a cesar salad....1 hour latler a stale BLT and chili that looked like it had been sitting there for 2 hours comes out. I was still waiting for my cesar salad. The chili was cold and the blt bread was so hard you couldnt bite into it. When we asked to speak to the manager the waitress got very defensive... the manager came over and explained that is their food and how its made so he wasnt sure of the problem. After an argument going back and forth ensued he agreed to comp the meals. Here is the kicker haha...we were going to leave the waitress a tip because clearly it was not her fault however, she came over and asked if our problem was resolved we said yes and then she rolled her eyes and walked away. No tip for you my friend. This is not how you do business especially when there are other options BESIDES SOHO to choose from for lunch.",1
1898,Nice looking place and the worst service i've had in the last 20 years.   After waiting 10 minutes to have a bartender at a less than half full bar acknowledge us we then ordered and the drinks arrived.  Hope you only need one round because after waiting 30 minutes to try to order a second round we paid with exact change to save us from wasting another hours of our life.   It is hard to explain how oblivious the bar tenders were.,1
1899,"Soho was disappointing. Lunch was very crowded, so we sat at the bar, even though there was an open table for 3 by the window. We were just 4, but they wouldn't let us put an extra seat at the open table. It was also very loud for a weekday, the noise from other tables carrying easily.\n\nI ordered the french dip sandwich, with risotto on the side. To their credit, the risotto was delicious, but such a tiny portion, I inhaled it in no time. Especially considering the french dip was so boring. The meat and cheese was bland and the sauce had far too many herbs in it. Not to mention, the food is definitely over-priced. I don't think I'd go back, but if I did, I'd order the risotto and nothing else.",2
1900,"Very good bar in Pittsburgh's North Shore. Nice draft and bottle beer selection. Had a Pittsburgh salad and burger. Both first rate! Great service and a lively atmosphere full of friendly customers enjoying themselves. \n\nFull menu including steaks, seafood and pastas. Calling SoHo a bar is a misnomber.\n\nThere are a few mistakes you can make selecting a bar for dinner in this neighborhood. SoHo isn't one of them!",4
1901,Bar next to stadium\nTypical\nbar next to stadium place\nWaitresses def looking for other jobs \nNot happy at all\nThis isn't even a game night,2
1902,We were looking for food late night on Thursday and nothing was open.  Since we were staying at spring hill suites we thought we'd give it a try. We were afraid it would be expensive. \n\nFlipped menu to sandwiches.  Had a burger or turkey burger or hot dog or chicken sandwich with side for $9-10.\n\nWe thought that was good and we had no other late night options.  Food came out hot and fresh. My chicken sandwich was grilled nicely with plenty of juice left in. Homemade chips as side.\n\nPlace was large and clean. Pirates out of town so we walked right in at 10am on a Thursday night. Full bar but we didn't order anything.,4
1903,"No redeeming qualities here. Schwill on tap. Food was terrible - had the pizza, mac & cheese bites, and spinach & artichoke dip.  It was hardly edible. Stay away.",1
1904,"I came here awhile back for lunch after kayaking for a couple of hours.  I ordered the Pittsburgh salad, and it was decent and filling, which is what I was looking for after getting some exercise.  I agree with other reviewers that prices are a bit on the high side, however.  Since I was there on a day when there wasn't a game, there were few other options open either along Federal St. or in the Del Monte bldg.  They have outdoor seating, which is a good way to enjoy the weather on a nice day.  Overall, the food is pretty typical for places along Federal St., but a bit higher-priced.",3
1905,"Good food but takes too long before game to get order, be sure to come early, 35 mins to get food.",3
1906,"Meh. \n\nI always hope for the best. I did not, however get the best. Although I would have to say the pretzel bite appetizer wasn't bad. But I really don't think there's much you can mess up. The buffalo pierogies however, was a total miss. \n\nI do not want to make any accusations, but they did not seem to be freshly made, maybe frozen pre-made ones. And they were covered in hot sauce. It didn't look appetizing, nor did it actually taste appetizing. \n\nThey have half off appetizer specials for food and $5 drinks. But all the special drinks were mixed, and I knew they would probably be way too sweet and frou frou for me. \n\nI went with a glass of Malbec, which was a good choice. Actually, it was the best choice there. Maybe stick to beer or wine and you'll be good to go here.",2
1907,"Had the chicken sandwich,  my sister had the guiltless chicken. 30 minutes after ordering, our waitress came over to ask again what we had ordered because she had forgot to put the order in. Food was flavorless, plain. Was there a few nights ago for drinks after the game, waiter wouldnt allow 3 of us to sit at a 4 top table (but had a party of 1 sitting at a 4 top right next to the table we were going to sit at). Do they even have tables for 3?? 15 minutes later... he asked his manager and allowed us to sit there. Overall, its a close spot to PNC but given both experiences, wouldnt return.",2
1908,"We stayed at the Spring Hill Suites next door to this place, so we decided to give it a try.  Love the design and interior of the place and they have lots of beers on tap.  Probably is a better bar than it is a restaurant.  The menu has a wide variety of good looking choices.  I simply got a Grilled Chicken sandwich with Swiss cheese and roasted red peppers and mashed potatoes.  It was ok.  The chicken didn't have much flavor to it and it was very thin breast that didn't fit all on the bun.  The mashed potatoes and gravy also didn't have much flavor to it.  My Dad had a burger and he said that was good.  It also took quite awhile to get our food after we ordered, despite it not being busy.  Our waitress wasn't overly friendly.  She was good, but all business, no pleasantries.  If I am staying at this hotel again (not likely), I'll probably eat here if I don't feel like venturing out.  However, I'd probably go somewhere else downtown otherwise.  I wouldn't mind going to the bar sometime though.  It really is a nice looking bar with plenty of seating.",3
1909,"Just walking around the area and ran into this place.  Nice big screen tv's and lots of people.....not over crowded,  no wait. Still took awhile for our food to come out. I had the buffalo chicken wrap and Mr. had the quesadilla and wings. He said the quesadilla was just ok. My wrap was spicy and pretty good. Place cleared out pretty early for a Saturday night.  Overall, service was slow, staff was friendly,  and food was okay.",3
1910,"Stayed @ the hotel. Ordered sirloin steaks. No steak knife, no mashed potatoes, no asparagus as ordered. So, Check your order. I mean for a 2 person $50 meal with tip I would hope the waitstaff would deliver on what was ordered & asked before we left. \n\nBut skip the 20%, $10 room service fee & http://www.sohopittsburgh.com. walk downstairs.",1
1911,"Good restaurant with a diverse menu, I've been here 4 times now and always had a good meal. The Tuna appetizer is awesome, if you like heat get a burger with the ghost pepper cheese its hot but great, tuna entree is good as well as the steaks. I'll be back again.",4
1912,"In the Wesin Hotel, attached to the David Lawrence Convention Center - this is probably the highest priced, over saturated fried fish establishment that exists in downtown Pittsburgh.\n\nNow, they call themselves the \""Orginal\"" fish market - but don't let that fool you. This place is an overpriced clone of legal seafood - with a good but overpriced service bar. Seriously.... $26 for two MGD beers and a double Bailey's on the rocks? Oy. Something tells me they want to loose business, rather than keep it. The wine selection is kinda dated, and I don't know the last time they cleaned the wine taps - but it looks to me like something I'd rather avoid- or have the bottle delivered to my table to avoid cross contamination.\n\nThe food, while basicially good (fried seafood) everything - is way overpriced to me. And there is no really good way to put this, but if you're looking for Fish and Chips - cross the street and go the the nearby Tonic restaurant. The portion size and the service are much better.\n\nStill, if you've got an expense account, and don't want to walk out of the convention hotel - yes, this will work for almost anyone. Including the guy who's had one too many and yelling at the bar with another patron.",3
1913,"LUNCH:  This was one of my favorite lunch spots when I lived and worked in Pittsburgh. I was a creature of habit though - - for lunch I very seldom strayed from their wonderful lobster bisque and a nice mixed green salad. It was the perfect lunch. Served quickly, which gave me plenty of time for the nice walk to and from work.\n\nDINNER: For dinner, when I had more time, it was always nice to venture into one of their other great seafood offerings. They have a couple of great salmon dishes that I really like and a striped bass. All seafood is fresh and prepared with care. Chicken and steak, but I never tried them - -  too many good seafood choices. Very nice presentations.\n\nSUSHI: They have an extensive sushi menu - for those of you who are big sushi fans. Me?  Not so. But I have friends who are and they rave about the sushi here. \n\nOne of the things I like best about this place is that the menu includes info on where your dinner was born, raised and caught.\n\nSUSTAINABLE FISHES\nThey exclusively serve Lummi Island Salmon\nhttp://www.lummiislandwild.com \n\nTilapia, NC\nLouisiana Catfish, LA\nAtlantic Salmon\nRainbow Trout, ID \n \nWILD LINE CAUGHT FISH\nDayboat Fluke, NJ\nLummi Island Salmon, BC \nTombo, HI\nWaluu, HI\nShutome Swordfish, HI\nStriped Bass, NJ\nPintado, Brasil \nChilean Sea bass\n#1 Ahi Tuna, HI\nMahi Mahi, C.R.\nWild Sea Scallops, MA\nDiver Scallops, Baja \n7 oz. Lobster Tail, SA\n \nFor an inland seafood restaurant this one rivals many costal ones I've eaten at. Definitely an upscale, pleasant place to eat lunch or dinner. Great service, quiet relaxed atmosphere. \n\nYes, it is a little pricey. If you want cheap fried seafood, head on over to Long John Silvers or Captain D's. But I bet you can't get them to tell you where their seafood came from . . . even if they know!  And, even if they do, you probably don't want to know!\n\nYou get what you pay for - in both food & service.",5
1914,"I have been going to this place for years.  It has excellent sushi and a pretty good selection, however often they don't have all the options listed on the menu.  I'm a big fan of white tuna and they never have it.  It's a little pricey, but the quality of ingredient is excellent.  I've had two issues with this place over the 30 or so times I've been here, so that's pretty good.  Try some of the specials.  If you order razor clams if they are on special be careful, because last time I had it there was a ton of sand in the clams.  This is also one of the few spots were you can get a good meal after midnight.",3
1915,"the salads are quite exceptional, especially for philly\n\nthe muscles are buttery goodness\n\nthe sushi is just not good, i don't care what the woman who eats there everyday cuz she lives across the street says\n\nand i think they put mayo in some of their sushi, which - however authentic - is disgusting",3
1916,"Surprisingly (or not), I had a great time here.  True, this restaurant offers little bang for the buck, but that doesn't mean that the quality of food has suffered.  The sushi was surprisingly good.\n\nMy dish was a bit oily.  The risotto was nice, but was a tad big on the salty side.  That's okay, though, because I still enjoyed it.  I imagine that it'd be a great place to take someone for a date at con.",4
1917,"Attached to the Westin Convention Center, this restaurant is a super convenient stop for convention goers.  They're open until 1am, which is especially helpful for those of us West Coast travelers that spend all day flying to get to Pittsburgh.\n\nI enjoyed a nice big bowl of their clam chowder - creamy, not tomato based.  Great flavors and large pieces of clam.  The cesaer dressing on their salad was delicious and their sushi list was impressive.\n\nService was a touch slow, but not too bad considering the number of occupied tables.  I'd say the food was good, but not outstanding.  Definitely a convenient and tasty option.\n\nAlso stopped in at the bar one night for a few drinks.  Drink prices weren't too bad, and they seemed to have a decent selection of choices.  The bar is not particularly big, so seating is a little limited.  But not a bad place to knock back a few after a long day of networking.",3
1918,I got the slow roasted jerk chicken (yes I know at the fish market!) and it was very very good.  For dessert I split the 'doughnut' with ice cream which was very tasty.,3
1919,"From March 2013 visit: the food was much better, good enough that I want to return. I had salmon, quinoa, spinach, pesto, bread (that's all I remember). I'm upgrading to 4 stars.\n\nFrom Aug. 2009: The most disappointing thing about this place is the temperature: uncomfortably cold.  Probably 60 degrees (on a warm day in August!).  The whole dining area was cold; it wasn't just our table.  When we brought it to the attention of the waiter he said there's nothing they can do about it; it's the hotel's cooling system.  That's insane!  Don't they care about the comfort of their customers?\n\nThe food was good, but the waiter did a poor job: he got one order correct, but they botched Jo's fish dish (she asked for the rice pilaf without tomato, and they brought her the standard rice pilaf with tomato), and they botched my order (I didn't order the prix fixe dinner, but they charged me for it (at a cost of $7 more), even though I communicated my order clearly.",4
1920,"located in the westin hotel downtown pittsburgh, i came here in the summer, early evening. party of 2. the valet was great and quick, i wasnt staying at the hotel, i pulled up and said i was eating at the OFM and he quickly took the keys and parked the car. the valet was quick when we were done also. overall i thought it the OFM was pretty good, its a nice busy atmosphere that you would expect for its location inside the hotel.  a pretty big bar kinda in the center of the restaurant, but is still set up nicely. although we sat at a booth, the sushi bar looked really nice with an awesome aquarium behind the itamae which i thought was cool. i got the swordish, which was just ok, she got the salmon, which was good, the spinach side that came with mine was very good. the salads were great, we each got two different ones and they were delicious salads, which honestly was the best part and highlight to the meal. i also ordered sushi, which was good and fresh. we had a very good waitress, very freindly, personable and catered to us perfectly. its expensive, probly a bit too much for the plate you get, im glad i ordered the sushi on the side, bc im not sure i would have been full otherwise. id like to go back and just order sushi. i wanna give it a 3.5.",3
1921,"Serviceable \""upscale\"" chain seafood spot, with both traditional dishes and sushi.  Yes, it's expensive, but it's one of the few spots open late downtown.   The sashimi was pleasant, and it's hard to screw up oysters and seafood pasta.   Our meal basically met our admittedly low expectations.\n\nThe service is on par with your local crap-on-the-wall chain restaurant, so don't expect too much.",2
1922,"One in our party summed it all up:  \""When you're paying these prices, you should expect better service.\""\n\nThe food was good.  I had a sashimi platter with some additional pieces, which was perfectly average.  You can get the same thing around the corner at Sushi Kim...and I think the quality is a bit better and the price lower.\n\nAnother in our party had the rib eye.  It was cooked well and he liked it.  For dessert the cheesecake was good, although the blueberries were clearly from frozen (unacceptable in July when they're in season).\n\nI had to sit and wait 5 minutes after my food was brought out before I could flag down a server to ask for some chopsticks and soy sauce.\n\nIt's not that the servers aren't working...it's that they're spread too thin.  Understaffed.  All working hard, but covering too many tables.\n\nLong story short, I won't go back.  Walk over one block and go to Eleven!  Same price, better food and service.",2
1923,Had dinner here and it was located in my hotel (Westin). Enjoyed a Lobster Bisque and a Green Curry Cod. The service was a little slow but friendly. My fish had several bones in it. The bread was sourdough with a shrimp butter. I think it was a bit pricey for a seafood restaurant. I didn't try the sushi that everyone was raving about. Where does a restaurant in Pittsburgh acquire fresh fish for sushi?,3
1924,"- The bread was good and so was the spicy shrimp butter that came with it.\n- The lobster bisque had a very slight gummy texture to it, as if too much flour had been used.  \n- I had the lobster pasta and I was a little disappointed with the lack of sauce that accompanied it.  It was really more of a broth than anything, which made the pasta seem too soggy and also drippy and messy to eat.  My wife had the fillet mignon, which she said was one of the best she's ever had.  She thought the potato side was just so-so.\n- Each of us had a drink with our meal, which put our total at $115, including the tip.  I expect to be a little bit more wowed with a meal for that price.",2
1925,"Terrible.\n\nI visited this restaurant for the first time yesterday to use up a Groupon.  Thank God I didn't pay full price for this slop.  \n\nFirst, lets talk about the decor.  Others have commented about the outdated 80s look of the place. I concur.  The chairs are ridiculously heavy and uncomfortable.  And don't even get me started on the hideous glass constructions hanging from the ceiling.  \n\nSecond, let talk about the staff.  Unprofessional to say the least.  When we were waiting for our table, I witnessed the hostess yell at a man from across the restaurant, instead of walking up to him and guiding him to his party.  \""Hey Anthony, your party's over here!\""  Ridiculous. \n\nThis restaurant has an open kitchen, which is usually a good thing - but not when everyone's yelling at each other.  We were seated near the kitchen and, I'm not exaggerating, heard someone yell \""order!\"" approximately every 30 seconds.  Staff yelled at each other from across the restaurant constantly.  I felt like I was on a playground.  \n\nOur waitress was a nice, sweet girl, and she did the best she could considering the environment she was in.  I have no complaints about her.  \n\nThe food, though... Jesus.  We started with the \""margarita shrimp cocktail\"".  Imagine tiny round pieces of popcorn shrimp floating in a glass of lime flavored water.  These were served with tortilla chips, which you'd think were meant to be used to scoop up the shrimp from the glass.  But, the shrimp are solid round balls, not a scoopable salsa.  We tried picking up the shrimp with the chips, but they'd just roll off and end up on the floor.  My date and I just laughed as we TRIED to eat this concoction.  When it finally made it into our mouths, it was gross anyway.  \n\nMy boyfriend ordered a sushi/sashimi combo platter.  I'm being generous by giving it a rating of mediocre.  Take out sushi from a grocery store is better.  \n\nNow, I admit, I made the mistake here - I ordered the fried fish platter.  I'm used to getting a variety at seafood restaurants.  At a place like Mitchell's Fish Market, you can get a dish with a piece of fish, a few scallops, a few shrimp, and a vegetable.  The Original Fish Market has no such dish.  The only dish I could get that had more than just one piece of fish with some plain steamed white rice and steamed spinach, was the fried fish platter.  So, I ordered that, with a side of green beans (vegetables were $5 - $7 extra).\n\nThe description said I would get a piece of tilapia, scallops, oysters, shrimp, and french fries.  I didn't realize this meant that the tilapia was fried, the scallops were fried, the oysters were fried, and the shrimp was fried, all on top of a giant bed of fried french fries.  It's just not what I pictured.  Like I said, it was my mistake for not reading carefully and not asking the waitress, but lets say for argument's sake that this is what I wanted.  \n\nIt was still disgusting.  The batter/flavor was exactly the same for everything.  The scallops tasted like the french fries.  The shrimp tasted like the french fries, the tilapia tasted like the french fries.  I didn't even try the oysters, but I'm pretty sure they would have tasted like french fries.  I ate barely a quarter of this dish, and I'm pretty sure I consumed an entire week's worth of saturated fat.  If you ate this entire plate, I think a heart attack would interrupt your dessert.\n\nThe green beans were good. \n\nOther people commented that you can't count on hotel restaurants being worthwhile.  I have to agree.  If everyone's just passing through, you don't have to worry about actually impressing anyone and getting them to come back.  And with business travelers, they're usually paying with their company's dime, so they don't bother to complain or expect much.\n\nI have learned my lesson.  I'm not coming back.  And I seriously question the sanity of people who gave this place more than two stars.",1
1926,I have eaten there several times.  This is an overpriced overhyped seafood restaurant.  The portions are not worth the price.  The Sushi is average at best.  The service has been poor almost every time I went.  We complained once to the manager and in the middle of talking to her she picked up the phone and totally forgot she was talking to us.  \n\nThe salads are small and nothing to write about.  The decor needs to be updated. If you ask me why I keep going back; it's not by my choice.  Usually we have several people staying at the Westin.,2
1927,"Came in for drinks after a conference and could not get service. Finally went searching for someone, who only came back with our order after we had nearly given up. And refills on water, coffee or soda? Forget about it.",2
1928,"Pittsburgh has good food.  Don't waste your time at the Fish Market.\n\nI stay in the Westin often and have had three meals at this spot in the past week.  The first was fine enough to get me to come back for a second trip.  The second time, our waitress clearly was in no hurry to serve our three-person group in the 50% occupied restaurant.  The third time, the chef's special \""coriander-crusted fluke\"" came out as a couple slabs of tasteless fish coated in bread crumbs and oil and tossed onto a pile of dry couscous, and they served me the wrong salad.\n\nService: most of the staff here don't seem to respond well to ordinary social cues.  For instance, standing at the podium for two minutes probably means I want to be seated, not looked at and ignored by two different waitresses.  Or, when I go to the bar to order takeout, after I submit my order and wait for the server to tell me the wait time, I don't expect him to leave me and start washing dishes.  \n\nI may stay at the Westin, but I will exert extra effort to NOT eat there.",2
1929,"I have never had such awful, inedible food at such an appallingly ridiculous price. It's not only a failure in execution, the plates are very poorly put together, and the flavors of the sides and sauces with the protein do not marry well at all. I was severely disappointed by plating, and then just got mad when I started eating.\nYou would think for 44$ your steak would at least be properly cooked. What was supposed to be medium, came raw. The steak was tough and tasteless. \nAhi tuna, asked rare, was overcooked; also bland, even with the sauce. The oshinko side was laughable. Seriously. I laughed. \n\n pasta was overcooked, and by the time it got to us, the sauce was laminated with coagulating fat. \nThe sushi was an amatuer attempt at best.  There was too much rice, and presentation was sad. \nAmbience is tacky. Ugly 80s-reminiscent wallpaper covers half the room and framed sketches of fish plaster the other half.\nService was the only redeeming quality. \nTo put it in perspective, my neighborhood Houlihans seems gourmet next to this place.",1
1930,"We were staying at the Westin and it was late and the Original Fish Market was right on site. Well the experience at both the hotel and the restaurant was dismal. We waited too long to be seated and the hosted seemed to have attitude when we asked one of the servers to find her. A simple \""Sorry for the wait\"" would have been nice. We were about to leave after waiting 15 mins for a waiter. Unfortunately we did not.  The food was all bland and tasteless. Oh! Except for the bold taste of Obay on the fries. I had blackened rainbow trout.  I expected a bold favors but yet nothing. It was not even blackened.  Looked like paprika for color, but that was it.  Mash potatoes were dry and tasted gritty like it came from a box. We skipped dessert for obvious reasons. I am not adverse to paying top dollar for a great meal. I hate paying top dollar for a lousy meal that I could have done better myself.\n\nDo yourself a favor and avoid the Original Fish Market.  I was generous to give one star.",1
1931,"My experience may different from others because I am an attractive female who went in with 3 young African American males.  Good friends of mine who spent a helluva a lot of money in Pittsburgh that weekend - who work hard and expect good service for good money like everyone else.  We were greeted with reserved distant service.  The waiter said something nervously like \""It's all good,\"" or something that people don't even say anymore.  A round of Patron Margaritas were horrible.  They tasted entirely like sour mix and we couldn't even take more than two sips.  Of course, when we ask that they be taken away and replaced with shots of Patron, we were got the \""oh, you're that type,\"" look and it took a while to convince the waiter that there was sincerely something wrong with the drinks.  Being used to that look, black folks often stomach bad food just to not appear to be complainers, but these drinks were horrible!  \n\nSo in the spirit of good faith, we ordered the some appetizers. Shrimp cocktail, crab bisque, and two oyster samplers.  The soup was bland, shrimp were large, but had a wierd texture that didn't seem fresh or like they'd been scrubbed to hide something, and oysters were not evenly sampled on both orders. One appeared to contain mostly one type instead of the 8-9 different types.  We plunked down the $200 for the appetizers and drinks with a nice tip and said ciao - went and had dinner at Sonoma - which was much better... Fish Market needs some lessons on hospitality and diversity OR new management.",2
1932,Sushi was great.  Everyone I was with enjoyed their meal.  I will probably not go back because the location is not great.,3
1933,"Terrible crab bisque. My husband liked the fish stew though.  It had lots of beans, was thick and chili-like. The rest of the lunch was so unnoteworthy, I can't remember what I ordered, though almost all of it was still on the plate at the end of lunch.  I do remember the bad taste in my mouth for the rest of the day.",1
1934,"Literally the worst restaurant experience that I've ever had, including McDonald's and 24-hour scarf-and-barf diners.\n\nPittsburgh is undergoing a bit of a food renaissance, yet the Original Fish Market continues to put out an inferior product in a horrendous atmosphere at an obscene price.  \n\nOur fish was tasteless and rubbery, my white wine came out at room temperature, the restaurant was extremely dirty, and our server was clearly apathetic.  \n\nThe Original Fish Market opened in 1998, and quickly found a place in the market in a city where Red Lobster was still considered \""good seafood\"".  As top-notch restaurants entered the market, the local palates grew up in a big way.  The Original Fish Market seems content to remain frozen in time competing as a mediocre option in an under served market space.  Unfortunately for them, their market space is now flooded with options offering a far superior product  at a fraction of the price.",1
1935,"One of the only places open downtown after 10 pm mid-week. Terrible service, average and overpriced food, in a hotel lobby, doesn't make a good combo.",2
1936,"Had the Walu (Hawaiian butterfish), and was excellent.  Sushi was good, my friends said best ever, I thought more average.  Rock shrimp appetizer also average.  Wait staff was excellent.",3
1937,This place really should be much higher quality for first the prices and second the only food option at the Westin.  I stopped by here two nights ago on a work trip to grab some food.  The wine that I ordered was out (which was fine) and substituted - but for a place with a giant wine cellar I wouldn't suspect that should be an issue for the glass wines.\n\nWhen I went to order I asked the server how the scallops were - and asked her to be honest.  She said that they are the most well done in Pittsburgh.  Well I think she meant that literally because the scallops were as tough as a tire and there presentation was poor with a pile of over salty spinach and some kinds of blobs smeared around the plate.  I was a little bummed about my experience when the 55 dollar bill came for one entree and a glass of wine.\n\nAlso a one off thing but the overhead light on the table was like a 10K watt surgical spotlight.  It actually hurt my eyes to look at the table it was so bright.  That should be an easy adjustment for the management.  Food quality on the other hand - you need a new chef.,1
1938,"Walking around downtown we stumbled into this place for a quick dinner.  It was fairly empty and quiet (nice), our waiter was friendly, and the food was ok.  We all got sushi, which was good.  We had a delicious shrimp and balsamic appetizer, that didn't taste like balsamic, but was great none the less.  The meal was not amazing, it was pricey as expected for a hotel lobby restaurant, and it met expectations.  I wouldn't run back to this place, but I wouldn't run away, either.",3
1939,"I've been meaning to go back to the Fish Market for so long. I remember the great crab legs I had years ago. I finally had the chance last week and was surprisingly disappointed.\n\nThe service was great. We sat at the bar and in no time both bartenders greeted us with smiles and menus. I guess my main concern was the food quality. I ordered the beet salad with warm goat cheese (was not warm at all) and shrimp and scallop linguine. Both were not unique in flavor or presentation. It was as if I made it in my own kitchen. My boyfriend enjoyed his lobster bisque and his seafood jambalya that was perfectly spicy.\n\nI do applaud the venue for offering a diverse and affordable wine list. And, with all due respect to owners, I think the atmosphere needs a serious update in character and aesthetics. Especially since other key hotels are more pleasing to the eye. This should be vital to one of the BEST hotels in the city! \n\nI'd like to return someday to give it another go. We shall see.\n\nP.S. Invest in better wine glasses. Ugly. Ugly. Ugly.",2
1940,"Was a little hesitant to eat here because of the average to below average reviews. But it was in our hotel and we were famished.\n\nBut we were pleasantly surprised by our meals that were extremely delicious. I got the Waluu/Butterfish (highly recommend this, although it was a special) and the wife got the corn-meal crusted wall-eye (the bacon whipped mash potatoes were awesome). The service was prompt and on point. For dessert, the creme brulee and cheesecake (with fruit compote) was fantastic as well. The sushi appetizer I got was good (as good as sushi can be) and the Blue Crab soup/bisque got rave reviews from my wife.\n\nTo boot, since we were going to go see a show at the Benedum, we got 15% off by showing our tickets! \n\nIf I had to nitpick a con about our experience was that the wine we got (Raimat Chard and some california Riesling) was underwhelming. \n\nWe look forward to coming back again.",5
1941,"I was pretty disappointed by this experience. And I usually avoid hotel restaurants for this very reason, but I was tired and I was staying at the Westin, so here I am at the Original Fish Market...\n\nI sat at the bar and ordered dinner. The bartender was very friendly and made sure she was taking care of me. So props to her! I got a menu and a sushi menu. OK, I'm pretty sure Pittsburg isn't the most awesome place for sushi, but let's give it a shot! I started with the gumbo, which came out warm and kind of bland. It wasn't good at all. And then I had a roll, which was decent. And a spicy scallop roll. Now, everyone has their own take on spicy scallop, but this was by far the furthest from what I could imagine a spicy scallop roll could be. \n\nIt was a small roll cut into 6 pieces (maki). It had a very small amount of raw scallops, which didn't taste super fresh. Then the roll was topped with the \""spicy\"". I can't identify exactly the spices that were on top, but I've had this type of spice combination on other Japanese dishes. So I know it's an off the shelf thing. Basically, this was the worst roll I could imagine.\n\nSo all-in-all, the food was sub-par at best. And the entire menu was overpriced. I would definitely eat somewhere else if I had any energy at all. I'm sure the room service would have been better.",2
1942,"I haven't had a full meal here but I had one of the best drink's of my life... The Sapphire Collins and it was amazing. That is coming from a non Gin drinker, so tasty and made just right not too boozy! \n\nThen I had the most mouth watering crispy light Calamari to go with it, completely enjoyable. My friend was unimpressed with her Sushi, but to be fair she is unimpressed with everything in life. \n\nWhat I liked about this place was the location on Penn ave was close to many cultural district venues. I would give this place a shot if you're gunshy about previous reviews and prices just try an appetizer and drinks like I did as a before evening out spot its great!",3
1943,"Was able to go in without a wait. Part of the Westin Hotel, there is a nice decor to the OFM, but the clientele seem to be going elsewhere.\n\nOur server was very helpful and gave us some suggestions on what to order. We asked about what sushi rolls we could start off with as appetizers for the group, and he suggested two that worked very well. They were both tuna-based, one mild and one spicier. It definitely lives up to the claim that OFM has some good sushi.\n\nWe then ordered our mains, and I got the cioppino. Now, I'm used to cioppino coming out as a stew with chunks of fish in a broth, but OFM's chef has decided to serve an entire slab of mahi on a thin layer of the broth with the accompanying shellfish. The dish was cooked well, but the presentation (lack of actual stew) left me wanting for more.\n\nThe caesar salad was pretty good, with actual anchovies on top.\n\nThe Hawaiian waluu dish got a thumbs up.\n\nThe crab cakes were also said to be very tasty.\n\nOverall, the experience was nice and relaxed, and the service is friendly. However, the food itself (besides the sushi) needs to be reinvigorated somehow to get it back into competition with all the new kids on the block.",3
1944,"Surprised by the poor reviews here. Yes, the restaurant's interior is... strange ( cavernous, dark, and smells a bit musty ), but overall we actually enjoyed this place. The sushi was much better than expected and Olivia was a great server. If I ever come back to Pitt, I'd come here with no problem.",3
1945,"I was one of three women who ate here on a Thursday night while here for business.  We got seated right away, but after that the service was slow and I had to keep asking for drink refills.  The 3 rolls that were brought out came with a really good flavored butter.  We were never asked if we wanted more or how things were.  We just ordered 3 salads and 3 appetizers and all were good portions and very good tasting too, and worth the prices.\n\n  We didn't know ahead that if you spend $50 you could get your Westin parking validated, we had paid $10 to park just across the street but that didn't count.",3
1946,"Have you ever eaten in a place where the whole seems far less than the sum of its parts?  Believe me, the Original Fish Market fits that description.  I met my mom and dad here for a pre-concert (Bonnie Raitt) dinner and honestly I wish we'd gone someplace else.  \n\nTo be fair there wasn't anything particularly wrong with the food or service.  I've enjoyed seafood restaurants before and while my dinner was okay, it was only just \""okay\"".  There wasn't anything particularly memorable about it.  Nothing that made me say, \""Wow\""!  My parents didn't hate their dinners either but they weren't impressed.\n\nAnd therein lies the problem.  The Original Fish Market wants to be a swanky hotel restaurant.  It certainly sets its prices high enough ($25.00-$45.00 per entree).  But the quality just doesn't match the price.",2
1947,"First time I've eaten here I went during lunch time. Not crowded but service was quite slow so I took off a star. My girlfriend ordered from their sushi lunch special and I ordered the bison burger. You're probably asking why order that when at a fish market. Well I originally planned on fish but I hadn't had bison in a while and it caught my eye. Well the menu is a bit pricey and I don't mind paying for good food so I had high expectations. He bison burger was mediocre (took a star away) The menu said bacon, but none showed up. No worries probably better for me. I felt at $15 for a bison burger this thing should freaking be awesome. Not the case. I would put it at $8.99-$9.99 price range I would pay since they gave me chips as a side. So they lost another star for over priced for the value I received. The girlfriends sushi meal was a bit over priced for a lunch menu. Two basic rolls and miso soup for $16. This would easy go for $14 at other places during lunch. So ultimately would I give it another shot? Yes, but only if it is convenient. I would not go out of my way or tell friends about this place.  \n\nHelpful advice for the OFM.  Actually have lunch specials. If you charge the prices you charge the food needs to be worth the price or you will lose return customers. Two rolls of sushi and a burger shouldn't cost me $33 unless you are going to blow minds!",2
1948,"Confusing! No one to greet me so I wasn't sure if I should go to the regular the bar or the sushi bar. I chose e sushi bar based on the number of available seat-all of them. I waited for eye contact with one of the sushi preparers. Obtained we contact after an extended period of time. He gave me a menu and instructions. But I Asked about process since I wanted a cocktail as well. Waiter will be there shortly. And he was! Cocktail order submitted, sushi items and cocktail arrived quickly, but I still needed more coaching on the method for closing out check. Prices-moderate, Staff -not the worst, but needs improvement. Sushi -decent. Bottom line-Communication for new guests needs improvement.",3
1949,"DIDN'T EAT HERE...this review not about the food.  We went on Friday night around 8pm, there seemed to be about 25% occupancy.  The hostess asked us if we had a reservation, we didn't , and she told us that they were somewhat behind and that we would have to wait 20-30 minutes.  WTF?  We IMMEDIATELY left and frankly its not worth going back again.  shame, the fish was good there. Crappy hostess for sure.",1
1950,"I've been to the Fish Market many, many times over the last 18 years or so. It doesn't change much. They get maximum money for average seafood (or anything else). \n\nThe sushi wasn't great this last trip (last week), and didn't taste terribly fresh. The Miso soup was barely average. I did like the Tataki roll, but it was the only saving grace of the meal. \n\nOverly expensive for what you get, and service can range between average and terrible. \n\nOh, and the bartender that's been there for as long as I've been going is seriously crappy, and I'm amazed he's lasted so long - is that a union gig?",2
1951,"McCormick & Schmick's knockoff is the best way to describe this completely non-memorable place. \n\nI agree with the other person who said \""it's trying to be a swanky hotel bar/restaurant\"". That may sound dumb but as someone who frequents hotels & their restaurants it can easily go either way. I've found you can get a great read on a place by the vibe of a hotel lounge. \n\nI hope for Pittsburgh this is not the case. Did I expect more from a Westin? Yes. Am I surprised? No.\n\nSub-par sushi. Tasted like takeout from Wegmans (holler, Rochester!). My Sauv Blanc was room temp & obviously an old bottle because it tasted nothing like it should (Kim Crawford is my standby so this was extra disappointing). Walk across the street & check out the Tonic Bar, I wish I had.",2
1952,Stopped in for lunch. No greeter so we weren't sure where to go. Super expensive for the portions. My salad had dressing only in the center. The rest was dry. My sweet potato fries that came with breaded shrimp tasted BBQ-ish  weird. But the worst was that my breaded shrimp actually had a curly hair cooked into the bread ing. It was disgusting. The waitress apologized and offered to replace but my appetitive was gone by then. She however did not offer to comp the meal. I would absolutely not return nor recommend it to anyone. Way too overpriced and the hair was a disgusting unwanted bonus :-(,1
1953,High end seafood attached to a high end hotel. I liked the large bar area where I had lunch. Tried the fish (Cod) sandwich that was fresh and high quality. Great service too. I would return again when in town for any reason.,5
1954,"I am sorry to have to give the Original Fish Market a 2 rating, I could of given it a 3-4 but the service was pretty sad! We sat down for lunch after checking into our hotel room. We waited too long for the waiter to initially great us, and there may have only been 5-10 diners in the entire restaurant, so this is the main reason for a 2, hopefully it's a rarity because the food was pretty good. I had the Cod sandwich , it was hot and tasty, probably one of the better fish sandwiches I've had. So it disappoints me to dole out a 2 but service is important!",2
1955,"Not good. I suspect the servers are over worked or spread too thin b/c the service sucked. The food was ok, but nothing special. It's a shame b/c better service would have made the experience decent.",1
1956,"We checked this out for lunch, since we were staying at the Weston.\n\nThe sushi, I thought, was pretty good.  Nothing outstanding, and I probably wouldn't seek it out again, but it wasn't bad.  My friends ordered other things off the menu; the verdict was largely that the food looked good, but was bland; this was especially apparently true of the fish sandwich.\n\nThe attached bar is *small* with a very limited selection of beers and liquors.  Perplexingly, they also have loads of bar seating, but don't open that area for happy hour time.  It seems you could not get appetizers and hang out until some point later in the evening.\n\nSuper expensive too.  Go somewhere else for lunch, there are many better options in the area.",2
1957,"We had our reception at The Pennsylvanian in Pittsburgh. Opening Night Caterers was our first choice and we were not disappointed!! From the first meeting, to the wonderful tasting, to the preparation and set up, to the big day, we could not have been more pleased with the service or the food. Everyone raved about it being the best wedding food ever! And the cake!! Delicious and beautiful. I would highly recommend to anyone!",5
1958,"This is a happening joint for happy hour and beyond. I've walked by the huge windows while downtown before and been amazed at how many people were drinking it up inside. Friday night, I finally made it inside. \n\nI was disappointed that they used \""mojito mix\"" for their seemingly very popular mojito - but at least they had freshly mashed mint. The martinis are generous, but you pay the price for them. Enjoy your measly $1 off at happy hour during the week, but I don't blame them. Why have a better happy hour when you're already making money hand over fist? \n\nThis is a fun place to hang out but expect to spend lots of money if you stick around. The atmosphere is probably the best for a downtown bar, but the crowd is surely on the older side. \n\nUnfortunately, they still allow smoking, but the place is big and airy enough that it's not so much an issue.\n\nOverall, I will definitely be heading back to Bossa Nova on another night - it has a very nice atmosphere. But I'll be sticking to one drink at a time.",3
1959,"Went here on a Monday at around 7:00.  The bar was filled with the usual suspects; guys in Brioni suits drinking away the stress, unfortunate weather and reality they have to head home to the wives who just dropped 3-5k at pottery barn.\n\nThe drinks were solid, and very fair priced (based on NY and Chicago pricing)  The open(ish) floor plan would accommodate a happy hour very well.  The food on the other hand - absolutely horrible.\n\nWe had lamb, chili prawns, ahi, chicken (something) and Chorizo.  The 'fusion' southern Spain meets some Japanese influenced small plates works, but the execution was deplorable.  \n\nVerdict: Drink but avoid the food at all costs...",2
1960,Good drinks with some run of the mill tapas. Nothing was innovative which I don't mind since it wasn't to expensive. My food taste a little burnt which is what cost it the fourth star. Overall it's worth trying and you may like it better than I did.,3
1961,"SO disappointed with this place! I've been wanting to try it for some time and finally did and boy...what a letdown. I had heard that it was one of downtown's happening Happy Hour places, but on the Tuesday night I went, it was 99% empty. The menu was pretty random and everything we tried was really average. The drinks weren't anything special either.  No innovation here in the food, drinks, or decor.",2
1962,"This place is A-OK!  I was contemplating giving it 4 stars but the scene is getting a bit dated.  They need to spruce it up or something.  It's just sorta there now.  But don't get me wrong, every time I go here I enjoy myself - but I make sure I have a good group to go with.  You do see some regulars but that's just the type of place that it is.  I like that you get a mixed crowd, no one too young and most of the people that seem to frequent this joint are in there late 20's, 30's, and 40's.\n\nIt can get a bit pricey if you have a tab open and aren't thinking about what your drinking and how much the drinks are.  The drinks are made reasonably well, by that I mean they have enough alcohol in them so that you don't have to wonder why you just paid $10 for ice, water, and a splash of alcohol.  \n\nBack in the day Bossa Nova was a novel idea for this town, but now with all these upscale bars/lounges and restaurants opening they may have to reinvent themselves somehow.  \n\nAll in all a fun place to hang out.  One thing I noticed is that there is a gap between when it's jumping.  Right after work is good b/c you get the happy hour peeps, but then it seems to clear out after 7:30 PM and then it picks back up around 10:30 PM...maybe it was just the night that I went, but I have a feeling that this is the norm.",3
1963,"Never been before and went on a Thursday night at 6PM before a show. Upon arriving, all the good seating near the windows was blocked off for private use (and remained unused). The \""host\"" told us to go find our own seating wherever we wanted. The setup is interesting with a large open bar area and a small number of tables around the perimeter. We took a seat at a table. The bar seating was fairly full with some milling around in the area and standing, and probably a total of 30 people there. We saw at least 5-6 staff, a couple sitting around playing on their phones.\n\nWe sat at our table for 20 minutes and never had a single person come by, not to say we will be there shortly, not to take a drink order, nothing. We could tell this wasn't going to be good so left and no one even noticed.\n\nIt was a little more bar than restaurant, so we weren't sad to leave.",1
1964,"Girls looking for a sugar daddy, guys looking for a cougar, or if you're just a pretentious douche: Bossa Nova is the place for you.\n\nThe atmosphere is downright tragic for how hard it tries.  The bar prices scream to the proletariat: \""Let them drink beer down the street! We only want the bourgeois in here.\""  Even the DJ they had during the Gallery Crawl a few weeks back was tragic.  I mean I know that the DJ has to appease the sugar daddies and cougars but is every place in Pittsburgh required to have 80s music?  I'm sure it is in the liquor license application.\n\nThat said, the barstaff is generally friendly and very quick - most likely so you don't realize you just paid eight dollars for a beer.",2
1965,"I like it here...\n\nI've only visited in the past for happy hour or drinks out with friends. Recently, both times I came late in the evening after work functions and arrived hungry. Coincidentally, both nights I was there was also salsa night. It's an interesting crowd, all ages, just gettin' their salsa on. I enjoy the music, but will sit back and let the \""pros\"" do the dancing. They have friendly service, a few outdoor tables and a huge bar. It's a pretty lounge-y vibe. \n\nThere is a decent wine/beer list, and also specialty cocktails. Both times, I tried the sushi, which was not bad at all - not comparing to a Japanese restaurant, but for a bar it was done well. The spicy one was really hot, topped with a jalepeno: nice touch. I also ordered the house salad, which was a meal in itself. Seriously it was huge! The ingredients were fresh, and with some balsamic and olive oil, it was very enjoyable. \n\nFor drinks or light fare, Bossa Nova is one happening spot in the downtown area, which seems to be on the up and up!",4
1966,"This is a trendy \""Brazilian Tapas\"" restaurant nestled in the Cultural District. Perfect for grabbing a drink or light meal before or after a show.\n\nBoy and I popped into Bossa Nova before the ballet. We saw suits de-stressing from the week, some 30-something females looking to get tanked, and some were just like us, waiting to go to a show. \n\nI had an (uncharacteristically) girly cocktail. I was dressed to the nines for the ballet. I figured... why not? It was sugary sweet and through no fault of the very lovely bartender, I will stick to wine and beer from now on.  Boy chose one of their many scotch selections. \n\nFor tapas, I had the fig and goat cheese toastas. Boy chose the stuffed peppers. Strangely, my food arrived about fifteen minutes before the peppers. The restaurant was not crowded in the slghtest, so I found this puzzling. Having tried both, I thought the tapas were bland and overpriced for things I could have easily made at home. Boy disagreed. He really liked his peppered. \n\nThe quality of the food and drinks (and their corresponding high prices) probably merit a two-star review. But we were greated by a very pleasant hostess and served well by the nice bartender. Their service alone probably earns Bossa Nova the three stars I am giving.",3
1967,"This rating is for the drinks only and atomosphere, and based on my personal taste a bit ok  a big bit. This is definately a \""I'm a young professional pittsburgh business person and I've arrived.\"" Status bar or \""I'm a young college girl and I've just had my first boob job care to help fund my nose job too?\"" Bar , I did not try the food becaused I moved from a place where we have awesome brazilian restaurant where fresh meats melt in your mouth accompanied by tart sweet grilled pineapple, and real slow cooked brazilian beans mmmm. Soooo after seeing how pittsburgh does Mexican food I'm not willing to drop my pennies to risk the disapointment of pittsbugh attmepts brasilian. \n\nThe bar is roomy with nice lounge seating which is nice for those who don't want to participate in the round the bar meat market. The guys make for fun people watching, either all suits or in their pirates jerseys. Or the occaisional jersey shore look a like meat heat in his v neck t shirt who is too good to attempt so much as a toe tap to the beat of the music. Then there's the balding old man with twenty something on his arm who already looks like she has botoxed up her face in an attempt to mirror her idol kim k. There are few older gay gentlemen I would have liked to chat with who mad things a little more interesting. There was an awesome looking woody Allen meets Andy Warhol look a like with cool glasses, and an awesome white frizzy mane.\n\nThe women range from down to earth girlfriends in for chat, drink and dance to wifes and girlfriends grinding it up on the dance floor with their man to the cougars. Warning Cougar dance zone, these women looked decent though and I'll give it to em they weren't afraid to shake it. \n\nMy biggest gripe about this place (I know I haven't gotten there yet), the drinks are sugary syrup crap. You can only put too many sugary alcohols together before you get a tummyache, you might as well be drinking the syrup flavors starbucks puts in your coffee. Stick to something on the rocks or a vodka soda most places cannot screw that up too badly (aside from Bar louie) but I will get to them later. Price is lame also 8 bucks and up for a mojito and they use coconut rum in it! Yuck. Sorry my college days of only being able to handle coconut rum are over, it is was frat guys give girls with a roofie.\n\nAnyway moving on my biggest gripe was that there is a cop standing by the door, who looks like he just walked away from beating a non white person to death. I know I know cops have the hardest job and I will be the first to say it, but this guy has a thick energy so nasty it hits you in the face from across the room. The way he was looking at the non white people who were a little to \""loud\"" for his tastes, no louder than the booming music mind you. Made my stomach churn. Also they used him to close at 1:15am on a saturday. Thats pretty lame for a downtown bar just because they were not packed. Bars in Salt Lake City Utah do that, come on BossaNova this is pittsburgh aka  drinkersville, not mormondryville. Just sayin....",2
1968,"Extremely disappointed.    My wife and I walked into the restaurant to have the hostess tell us that is was open seating.   Okay, that's fine..... as we walk to find our table I'm wondering 'why don't the just have a sign there because she wasn't  very friendly, nor timely with the direction.'    That said, we sat down at a table set up for dining that was nicely presented.   Unfortunately we sat at the table for approximately five minutes without recognition from any employee at the restaurant.   At this point, we decided to dine elsewhere.   As we walked out, there was still not one bit of attention given, again.   The hostess never lifted her head from whatever she was reading.   I think that a sign would have served a much better purpose.   On the back side it could have said \""thanks for your business\"" .....or lack, there of.",1
1969,"I stopped in to Bossa Nova for a holiday party on a busy Friday night in December. Although the restaurant side looked empty, the bar was packed. It seemed like people who were not a part of the party were still coming in. A little odd seeing the party guests had a live band, appetizers and were giving out prizes.  \nWith the appetizer stations, we were able to try many different appetizers from quesadillas to calamari to sushi and back to meatballs. It seemed like Bossa Nova was trying to satisfy varying appetites by offering everything from Italian to Japanese. Overall, the food was average. I was not overy excited about any of it. I enjoyed the drinks much more, especially the Spansh wines. The service was great. We had 3 different bartenders ask us what we wanted while another was making our drinks. Everytime I finished my last bite and was about to have an empty plate, a waiter appeared out of nowhere to wisk away my dirty dish. \nHowever, this is not a casual, laid back, every day type of bar. I can't put my finger on exactly what it is, but the atmosphere definitely gave off the \""I'm better than all of you\"" type of vibe. Maybe it was the fact that they charge for th coat check?",3
1970,Went to an event here. The meatballs were frozen meatballs. It was ok. I probably wouldn't go back to eat.,3
1971,"I've been going to this bar randomly over the last 5 years. It's definitely gone downhill.\nMy last experience here was when I was trying to plan a birthday party during happy hour on a Friday during the summer. When I called to reserve some space, they told me they only reserve seating areas for people who pre-purchase food. Which, the pre-purchase options were about $10-12/person. I wasn't about to pre-order food for a casual birthday get together. So, figuring they'd probly be very busy on a Friday night, we got there around 4:30. There were MAYBE 6 people around the bar. No one in the lounge seating area. I sort of felt undervalued as a customer for not being able to reserve space when no one was there. 5:30 came around, the bar got a little busier, but no where near the packed house crowd they painted as a picture for me when I tried making reservations.\nOur waiter was sub par. People sat without drinks for 20+ minutes, and some people just didn't get to order, because one person would order a drink and the waiter dashed off, leaving others to call out after him (to no avail.) He would basicalyl take 1-2 orders, and run off, not to return for 10 minutes. \n\nThis place is average in food price and quality. But the attitude of this place could be better. Go to Six Penn instead. They have outstanding service without the pompous attitude, and in the summer they have a roof top patio with a bar and lots of seating. Best in town!",2
1972,"The menu was small and underwhelming. The flatbread pizza most likely came out of the box. They didn't have the sauces, so the gave us ketchup to go with over cooked shrimp/bacon and extremely greasy fries.",1
1973,"So I was returning back to the office after doing a site visit and I heard the dreaded \""Pow!  Thump-thump-thump\""!  So I pulled over, got out of the car and sure enough, that right front tire was flatter than a Nebraska cornfield.  O-o-k-ay!   I was so glad that years ago my brother taught me how to change a tire.\n\nWell this Monro was the nearest place to get the tire repaired.  It turned out I'd picked up a nail!  I've heard good and bad about auto repair chains, but they did get the tire fixed quickly.  \n\nAnd girls, you shouldn't be afraid of learning how to change a tire.  Because I had the company car, it actually took me longer to do the memo and the expense report than it did to put the spare on",3
1974,"First impression:\nThe guys here were borderline rude to me when I dropped my car off. I thought I had talked to someone on the phone and made an arrangements. It turns out there are two Monro Muffler locations on Penn Ave and no employee at either shop thought to bring this up (then, or at any point), as I had called the wrong location (I found out days later).\n\nService:\nThey took my car in anyway and said \""they'd get to it tomorrow\"", well tomorrow became the next day and the day after... \n\nGot a call that the mufflers I bought for the car turned out to be the wrong ones so I called around, tracked down the right ones, and dropped the correct ones off there within two hours of the call.\n\nQuality of work:\nAll in all it took a week for them to get the work done and I was under the impression they would be welding the whole system together. It turns out they just use clamps and bolt stuff together. I asked them to make me some tail pipes for me with bends over the rear axle and they couldn't do it with 2.5\"" pipe, turns out they are incapable of bending anything over 2\"" pipes there. Instead we agreed it would be easiest for them and cheapest to install short turndown pipes. So really it wasn't a terribly difficult job to be done.\n\nOverall impression:\nI gave two stars instead of one because they didn't actually break anything or lose my car or burn it down or anything. Pricing came in just over what we had agreed on because of the addition of the turndown pipes. I could have saved a lot of money and time and done it myself.",2
1975,"I was driving on a road trip from Ohio to Virginia and my parking brake light turned on while I was on the highway, so I figured it would be safest to pull of the road and have it checked out before I kept driving; this one happened to be the first one off the exit. Lu was quite the character: friendly and knowledgeable and Mike and the other guys were very friendly as well.  Lu got us in and out. He saw that the brake fluid was low and added some fluid for free and then put my car up on the lift and inspected the brakes just to make sure.  I was back on the road in no time and I'm so grateful for their friendly and fast service.  Seriously, these guys were great. Lu also took the time to describe and show me exactly what was going on with my car and so I felt safe hitting the road.  The problem was fixed and I appreciated their help so much, I got to my destination and created a Yelp account just so I could let everyone know what a great group of guys work there.  Thanks!",5
1976,"I had lunch here yesterday before the Pirates game with a few friends.  I have also been here a few times upstairs.  I really liked the fact that we had no problem getting a seat at the bar or a table.  I usually go to the bars on the North Shore prior to Pirates game, but this was a lot less crowded and good for the group I was with.  In fact, truth be told the place was only about 1/2 full (on Bucs opening day!?).  The food was okay.  I tried these nachos which were good and interesting because it had a decent quality sausage as the meat and not just ground beef.  I also really liked the sweet potato fries.  They were delicious and you usually can't get these at too many places.  I ordered the lobster roll.  It was a ton of lobster, however some of the lobster was a little overcooked and it was ice cold.  I can understand serving cool even though Id prefer warm, but ice cold really wasn't that good when they put warm butter on it.  I also tried the tortilla soup, which was really rich and had a good spicy flavor.  The only thing missing in the tortilla soup was the tortilla chips.  A minor oversight I imagine.  Overall, a pretty decent place when you are looking to just have a few beers with friends.  I've also tried the upstairs bar which is the more upscale section.  The bar is huge which is good plenty of room, and their is plenty of seating including leather couches.  The happy hour is okay, but it's pretty much a ghosttown after 8 PM.  Overall a decent place for quiet drinks without the crowds and a little better than average food.",3
1977,Solid place to grab a martini and listen to some sub-par live music. Far from amazing but hey not everywhere is going to be right?,3
1978,"I was there in November 2009, what a great little place! It's laid out like a shotgun house, long and narrow, and it fills up pretty quickly at night, but if you appreciate industrial spaces, exposed brick, etc., you'll really dig the vibe at this place. Plus, they had the Great Lakes Christmas Ale on tap, just when other places were running dry of it, so it got extra points for that! Calamari is pretty good, service was excellent. If i had one criticism, it's that the place is bit *too* dark, even for a bar -- but very clean!",4
1979,"Don't bother. \n\nWe were kind of desperate to find a place that wasn't too pricy and close to our hotel on a Monday night. We saw this place, with the low lighting and witty name (although we weren't sure if they're cleaver enough to make the theater reference or if it was simply a mistake).\n\nThey boast a new menu and I got the pasta with goat cheese and almonds. I didn't have high expectations but this was like family meal before your serving shift. It was boring and flavor free. My boyfriend got a steak sandwich that looked punny. Oh, and the grocery store wine was way over priced.\n\nBoo!",2
1980,"Olive and Twist is a convenient and rather nice bar to visit if you're staying in the downtown area.  The huge beer list and so so martinis do their job well in attracting the suits and theater crowds in mass numbers.  Finding a seat can be a chore if you come at the wrong hour because no one ever leaves!  The food menu is your typical bar menu and is very well priced.  My party only got the nachos which were good.  Our bartender, Rosie, was a sweetie and really made us feel welcomed in this steely town.",3
1981,Sooo blacked out here that\nWe heckled the guitarist.\nNot sorry. He sucked.,4
1982,"I went here couple of month ago for late night drink. \nI was a little drunk when I went in here, just a little bit, so I don't recall things quite precisely but I liked the atmosphere.\nDim lighting which I liked.\nFriendly staff.\nNothing special for drinks.",3
1983,"I only went here to have a few drinks, and talk with a friend who wasn't sure if he wanted to eat or not. We were escorted to a table and were cool, the waitress was friendly and tentative since our conversation was rollin'. Long story short we were there for 5 hours, just drinking, and if our waitress could of re-worded her words, our experience wouldn't have been so sour. She came over and stated \""I'm leaving here is the check, if you would like to stay you're more then welcome to order from the bar.\"" So we continued to talk not thinking anything of it, or someone was going to pick up her tip. WELL not two minutes later she comes back to us and says \"" IM LEAVING, I need you to pay your check.\"" At this point me being me, gets a little annoyed, as my friend is looking at me like no she didn't! So he paid as a gentlemen do, and we continued the night, as they dimmed the lights and shut off the music we got the hint we've been talking way to long. If she could have been a tid more polite, it would have been a good experience. The atmosphere was great, the food looked good, but your sour mouth ruined it all.",2
1984,"I get it. It gets busy when you're a bartender/waitress sometimes. I've been there myself. But you can explain why things are late or why it takes nearly half an hour to pour a glass of wine without being incredibly rude and cold, and if you even say it with an apologetic smile, most customers will understand. Food was fine, won't go back for fear of the server.",2
1985,"Bossa Nova's step-sister bar, but not the evil jealous step sister more like the older a little more mature caring step-sister. At least in the way of making a carefully crafted unique martini or cocktail. \n\nAtmosphere is a little more cramped, but usually you can still find a table late on a week or weekend night if you do not mind sitting in the back. It is fine for me because I don't like being sandwiched at the bar with other people's conversations in my face. \n\nI didn't try the food but my friend ordered the Tuna appetizer and she said she loved it just wished the portions were a little better. But for the price it wasn't bad. \n\nI ordered the Perfect Pear cocktail with Pear Absolute Eldleweiss flower liqouer and a splash of pineapple juice it was delicious! Not too sweet and I despise sweet drinks. The perfect blend of soft tangy tartness. Much more creative then the drink menu at Bossa Nova.\n\nFor the drop in spot after a show or just happy hour with friends I found this to be a pretty down to earth and decent spot. The waitress was not that great but she was young, some things are forgiven if the product is just right.",4
1986,"The genius of the \""Olive or Twist\"" name got us in the door here, but we didn't have the best experience with their mixers.\n\nWhile here, we sampled the blueberry mojito and the cucumber basil martini.  The blueberry mojito had an overpowering taste of rum. As a strong drink, it was good. However, the rum killed any blueberry or mint flavor in the drink. For the cucumber basil martini, the basil is the primary flavor in the drink and kills any undertones of the cucumber. The sole basil flavor of this drink made it unappealing.\n\nIn addition to a cocktail menu, they also offer a reasonable selection of beers including microbrews.",2
1987,Went to this place for lunch. My wife order a wrap and I order a salad. Very nice food. The sweet potato fries are wonderful. My smoked duck break salad is wonderful too. Highly recommended.,4
1988,"Found you on Yelp and weren't disappointed. Very friendly waitstaff and good food (bar fare). Yummy desserts. The acoustics downstairs were terrible. Exposed brick everywhere and no noise dampening.  Not the best place for an intimate dinner or quiet conversation on the weekend. But a young, fun, party like atmosphere. Convenient to cultural district.",4
1989,"I ... don't know why I keep going back to Olive or Twist. Seriously, you could check my Foursquare stats and see that I've been to this bar more frequently than any place I've ever called my favorite spot in Pittsburgh. \n\nWhy? I moved up here from Orlando to be with my boyfriend who I had just started dating. I moved because Orlando on a whole sucks and I was ready to get out. My boyfriend used to play in a band as does one of his best friends now. This was their favorite spot to hang out out because all of the (female) bartenders know and love them. They used to get free or greatly reduced drinks, could be as loud and obnoxious as they wanted, etc. etc. - the ush. \n\nI tag along now because I didn't know many people in this city at first, obviously. The bar is way too small for the number of people who try to pack in at night. I've had several items off of the menu and they all left a lot to be desired. The drinks are poured strongly. At first I thought this was because the bartenders knew how the boys liked their drinks, but now I realize they're just heavy handed. \n\nNothing here really sticks out for me. I can get the drinks properly made elsewhere for the price. Same with the food. I guess the only reason I agree to go back time after time is because of two of the bartenders - Amy and Linda. Those two are the most kick ass bartenders in Pittsburgh. Considering I currently live in Heinz, it's also pretty damn close, which works in its favor (can't wait to move ... ). \n\nOlive or Twist has a great location and, if Amy and/or Linda are working, you're sure to enjoy yourself. Just keep those expectations low.",1
1990,"In town on business and I always try to find places like this.  Wow, a martini bar not named the Blue Martini?  OK, I'm in!\n\nSo I strolled over and walked in.  First impression was it was a cool, cozy, and trendy joint.  Liked the exposed brick walls, lighting, etc.  Only problem is, I don't go to a restaurant or a bar to eat and drink the atmosphere!\n\nSo I grab a table in the bar.  It was about 5pm and there might have been 15 people in the whole place.  Two bartenders made eye contact with me so I figured they would be waiting on me.  I figured wrong.  I sat there for a good ten minutes and was getting ready to get up and leave when the younger tender came over and said with a \""deer in the headlights look\"", do you want a drink or something????  Well hell, what was your first guess?  I refrained from quoting Foxworthy and saying \""here's your sign\""!\n\nSo OK we were off to a bumpy start.  I didn't have a martini, however there was a few options on the drink menu.  I was just here for a bite, so my review is based on that.\n\nA few minutes later the other bartender comes back with my water and gives me a menu.  I ordered some turkey wrap with a fruit salad for a side.  I say \""some\"" turkey wrap because it was really that unimpressive!  \n\nIt seemed to take forever for it to arrive.  Given the fact that it wasn't busy, it did take a long time to arrive.  When it did, it looked OK.  The fruit salad looked as if it was ready for the trash, so I bypassed that.  The wrap just had zero flavor and was loaded with lettuce........way to much.  The only flavor that presented itself was blandness!  It was very disappointing.\n\nAll in all, I think this is probably a way better bar to have a drink in then a restaurant.  I will return to try a martini, but I will pass on the food.",2
1991,"The Partner In Cuisine (PIC) and I had an early dinner there recently thanks to Groupon and we were not disappointed.  Since we weren't sure what to get and were just generically hungry, we decided to just let the menu decide for us and we ordered one of each of the highlighted items on the menu - the \""house specials\"" according to our server.\n\nThe calamari was excellent and it was apparent that it had been hand breaded.  The Asian fusion made for a delicious alternative to the typical calamari that was reminiscent of a General Tso's squid.  The main dishes were also good, but nothing in particular stuck out about them.  I also had a red-velved martini which I thought was probably the best part of the meal.\n\nOverall, I would definitely go back on a weeknight for happy hour or on a Tuesday to try the variety of mini martinis, but I think I'll leave paying $9 for an alcoholic beverage to \""special\"" nights and not just a typical weekend dinner.\n\nThey do lose a star because even though we were one of three occupied tables and a few taken seats at the bar, the service was incredibly slow.  It took so long for our appetizer to come out, I began to question whether the cook had to get in his car and go down to Wholey's to buy more squid.",4
1992,Try the sweet potato fries with a side of honey mustard instead of ketchup. Linda and the rest of the ladies at the bar are awesme.,4
1993,"We were in Pittsburgh for one night and Olive or Twist was near our hotel.  There were many other restaurants, but this place looked nice.  The atmosphere was nice, and if I was rating only for atmosphere I'd give it 4 stars.  However, I'm mainly rating their food and service.  We were greeted promptly, but after that the service was spotty and it took awhile to receive our drinks/food even though there weren't many people in the dining room.  \n\nI ordered the Traditional French Dip Sandwich and Fries.  I enjoy a good French Dip and have tried many of them at all types of restaurants and this one was the worst I've ever eaten. In fact, I couldn't finish it.  The meat tasted like old lunch meat and the bread was nothing more than a cheap, glorified hot dog roll that was soggy.  It wasn't soggy from the Au Jus, but it tasted like they steamed the roll for some reason.  \n\nOverall, if I was going back to Pittsburgh in this area, I would stay far away from Olive or Twist.",1
1994,"I had a really mixed experience here. Took the bf for dinner here before a show at Heinz Hall, which was really great for the convenience, they're so close to one another. We would definitely go back for lunch - GET THE TRUFFLE FRIES APPETIZER - and martinis someday, but never again for dinner. The entrees were expensive and nothing to rave about, and the service wasn't anything special. The dinners took forever to come out - I know it was a Saturday night, but we got there well over two hours early and were still worried about not getting to our show seats on time. It was a nice atmosphere, but one that we felt a little to young and poor for (we're still college students). I think I'd try somewhere else for a nice date night next time, but again, I will definitely go back to splurge some lunchtime on the cake batter martini, truffle fries, and other desserts and appetizers.",3
1995,"I love Olive or Twist. Absolutely love it. As I'm sure everyone who has been here has mentioned, it has a fantastic drink menu that offers a decent variety in terms of its alcoholic beverages - everything from various delicious martini-style drinks to the standard favorite beers. The place also features a really good menu; I'm very partial to its crab cake sandwich, which really hits the spot and has a perfect balance of crabcake with toppings and dressing. I especially love how any sauces or dips with appetizers are usually served in a martini glass. It's a cute and well-thought touch.\n\nThe only drawback here is that Olive or Twist is pretty darn popular; this place gets very noisy after 4:00 very quickly, especially as the happy hour prices kick in. This is even assuming you can get in - I've tried to go here on nights when it's completely booked. Completely. Every table, top and bottom floor, with only standing room near the bar.\n\nI will continue to be a major fan because the drinks and eats really are fantastic, but will probably avoid coming here during its busiest days and hours (i.e. the end of the week and beginning of the weekend).",4
1996,"I've actually had OK experiences at this place in the past but this trip was especially bad. \n\nI tried to stop here with my husband for an appetizer and a drink before heading into the theater district - bad move.  Upon being seated the server explained that they were no longer serving food because of a water leak or something unsanitary-sounding. Klassy. \n\nFor reasons I truly can't explain, we decided to stay for a beer before heading to our destination. We both threw down a brew nasty, paid and left. Unfortunately for Olive or Twist, the visit would probably be our last.\n\nOn a positive note, there was an interesting man setting up for what looked like a live acoustic set. His warm-up sounded good but we left before he really got started. \n\n\nWhen it's all said and done, we should have just went to the Sharp Edge down the street. Probably a much safer bet for future endeavors.",1
1997,"Girls night had to happen. We decided to go to Olive or Twist, because it was close and I did have a coupon. \n\nI was delighted with this bar/restaurant. I never knew that they had an upstairs! Upstairs they have couches and comfortable chairs with coffee tables in between them.  So much more comfortable than sitting on wooden or bar stools. And after a long day at work, being comfortable is really all that I am about. The music was slightly loud but still tolerable, and enjoyable because it was older rap music that we started to then sing and dance to (in our chairs!).\n\nWe all ordered food and drinks. I got the burger, which wasn't anything special, but I wasn't expecting the sun and the moon from it. My friends ordered the jerk chicken and the bean quesadilla. The jerk chicken was amazing. They had this jalapenos sauce on it, wooo hooo. It was so good. A perfect mix of sweet and spicy that was mouth watering. I kept on dipping my fries it in. Yummy!\n\nThe drinks were also perfect. I ordered the Wild Tea Mojito and the Pink Lemonade. Both of these drinks were refreshing and delicious. I just wanted to just go down the drink menu and check off all each and every one of those cocktails! I wanted to know if all of them could be as good as the two that I tried. \n\nIt was a great and comfortable experience for a bar. I will be going back soon!",4
1998,Owner or manager was very rude when we presented our yelp deal.,1
1999,"A beautiful little bar with an exciting \""martini\"" list - do step outside your comfort zone and try one of the crafted drinks.",5
2000,"This is the perfect place to go before a show downtown. I love the atmosphere of the restaurant in particular the upstairs space. It has a lofty, cozy feel.  Great place for drinks or and event (can rent the upstairs space).  My last visit was for a working business meeting.  Glad we made reservations for it was busy on a Friday evening. I ordered the roast beef sandwich which was very tasty and flavorful.  I love that you have a variety of options for a side and they do not charge you extra. I picked my favorite, mashed potatoes.  A colleague ordered the pesto pasta dish which looked delicious.  We didn't order drinks but in past visits they have a really nice variety of beer and I tried the Banana Bread beer (available in bottles) which is so tasty!! My only complaint was that it took a while for the waitress to take our orders and bring out the checks but it was very crowded with large parties. We stayed at our table after dinner to finish up some work and they did not mind which was great!",3
2001,"Great atmosphere, took us even though we were an hour early for our reservation, the steak salad was amazing. Service was awesome. Only thing that could have made it better was more tv's for football that was on!",4
2002,"This place is pretty good. The buffalo chicken spread and the jerked salmon are awesome. The service is always good especially at the bar. They have an upstairs lounge that is open for happy hour during the week. If you are looking to grab a few drinks after work with friends, the lounge upstairs is a good choice. Everything on the menu is reasonably priced with happy hour specials M-F. ($2 off all martinis and half price buffalo chicken spread)",4
2003,"We decided to stop by Olive or Twist on a recent Saturday night before a show. A friend was at a wedding upstairs and asked us to drop in to say hi. Apparently they host wedding receptions in the lounge area above the bar/restaurant.\n I was hoping to get a quick meal and a drink before the show. When we arrived the bar was packed and we were told that they had no availability to sit in the restaurant section. But, little can deter me. I scoped out the tables by the bar and noticed a couple getting ready to pay. After making casual chit chat, they agreed to save their table for us. They paid and left while we ordered a drink at the bar. As soon as they got up the waitress put a reserved sign on the table, I assumed it was for us and sat down. Nope. She was trying to reserve it for an 8pm reservation. I thought this was the bar area which is seat yourself? Oh well, I told her we had to be out by 8 for a show anyway so it would work out fine. A few minutes later she came back and told us no, that won't work and we will have to find a place at the bar. Seriously? We are already sitting in the seat yourself tables, it was fine 2 minutes ago, we have to leave by 8, what's the issue? Rather annoyed we looked for seats and ways to inch ourselves into the already overly crowded bar when the waitress returned and said she will reserve another table that was leaving. Now, we have wasted 10 minutes of our already limited time before the show so, I asked what was the fastest thing on the menu. We ordered soup, salad and the buffalo chicken spread. The soup arrived first. I had the homemade chicken noodle. Warm, comfort food that hit the spot. Next was the pear salad with candied walnuts, blue cheese and strawberry vinagerette.  Again, super tasty. I could snack on the candied walnuts all day. Then the buffalo chicken spread. Presentation was great-in a martini glass. The pita chips were delic! But where was the chicken? I searched through the entire martini glass, not one shred or chunk of chicken. Being a buffalo chicken dip lover, I was sorely disappointed. As for the drinks, stick with the martinis as the wine was also a big disappointment.",3
2004,"We went here for drinks and a bite before a concert at nearby Byham theater. We had wings and a piece of cookies and cream cake. Both were outstanding. We both had the Fat Gary's Ale, but in hindsight I would have preferred a Guinness. The ambiance was suitably cave-like as a good bar should be.",3
2005,"This bar is cramped, overpriced, and the service is unbelievably slow. Happy Hour runs 4-6, so you'll show up at 5, have no place to sit or stand, and will only be able to get *maybe* 2 drinks during happy hours You'll then be told that the upstairs (which is actually not bad) will be opening at 5, even though you're asking at 5:20 (this has seriously happened all three times I've been there).\n\nSeriously, avoid this place. When one of your co-workers suggests a work happy hour, direct them anywhere else.",1
2006,"Very disappointed.  I had been to Olive or Twist for drinks and really enjoyed it but had never been there for a meal.  I was going to a show at the Benedum with a friend and made reservations about a week and a half before the show.  We arrived about 15 minutes early for our 6:00 reservation expecting we may not be able to be seated yet.  The problem is that even though I called and made a reservation (including the person answering the phone taking my name and phone number and repeating the date and time) we were told there was no reservation for our name.  The hostess said something along the lines of \""are you sure you called here to make a reservation and not somewhere else\""  Yes, I'm pretty sure I called the right restaurant...  She kept looking at the room of empty tables, looking at the book and then looking at us.  After a few minutes of back and forth, she told us the lounge upstairs was open and we were welcome to grab a table up there.  So we trudged upstairs.  All that was available were small high top tables.  Being a Friday night, it was packed with the happy hour crowd and was pretty noisy.  Not really the environment we were looking for but we decided to make the most of it.\nWe started with the Buffalo Chicken Dip appetizer.  It is served in a martini glass with toasted/fried pita chips.  It was tasty and we were surprised at how much dip there actually was.  \nThe problems with food began with the pacing of the meal.  We had our appetizer for under five minutes when our entrees came out.  It may not have been a big deal if we were at a real table in the restaurant downstairs, but being at the high top bar tables, we had no room for our drinks, appetizer and meal.  We found ourselves stacking stuff and pulling things off the table in order to fit everything.  It was frustrating.  Not to mention that we would either have to let our entrees get cold as we finished the appetizer or let the appetizer get cold as we ate our entrees.  \nWith as much as we enjoyed the appetizer, we were looking forward to our meals. Unfortunately, they were very disappointing.  My friend ordered the french dip sandwich with a side of mashed potatoes.  Her potatoes were ice cold and sandwich luke warm.  When she mentioned it to the server, the server said \""so would you like me to take them back or are they ok\""  When would cold mashed potatoes ever be OK?  When her potatoes were brought back warmed, she was disappointed because they were called \""garlic mashed\"" but she said they were pretty bland with not much garlic at all.\nI ordered the Caribbean Jerk Chicken.  It was described as \""grilled chicken seasoned with jerk spices, pepper jack cheese, garlic mayo and pineapple chutney on a Kaiser roll\""  No mention of a tomato.  When I got the sandwich, there were three tomatoes on it.   Thankfully I just dislike tomatoes and it wasn't an allergy issue.  There was also no pineapple chutney.  When I asked about it, the server told me they use a sauce and it must have been soaked into the roll.\nOverall, very disappointed.  I wanted to love Olive or Twist because I really enjoyed the time I had visited for a drink, but the dining experience was sorely lacking, especially for a dinner that was supposed to be a nice laid back start to our girl's night out.",1
2007,"I was really excited when I saw the menu for this place because they had some vegetarian items that sounded delicious. I liked the decor, with exposed brick walls, soft lighting and we went there on a night with live music. But the positives stop there. I had the veggie burger. The burger was the typical veggie burger that a lot of restaurants are trying now - with all of the veggies in the patty - and people continually make it mushy. The mushy texture made me nauseous so I didn't finish that. I got the side of garlic mashed potatoes, and I'm pretty confident those came out of a box, though that ended up being my favorite thing. \n\nMy date got nachos, which are advertised with lots of goodies on top. Lies! They were covered in melted but cold cheese, a sprinkle of diced tomatoes and a scoop each of guacamole and sour cream. Neither one of us ate more than 3 chips. \n\nFinally, I ordered Patron with Rose's line juice. First sip... Completely bitter and disgusting! So I asked her. And she said, oh right, we don't have sweetened line juice, he probably just used lime juice. So I asked for her to add some simple syrup, which she did. And then it was drinkable. But come on. She should have thought of that upfront! \n\nDon't go here for anything but the walls and music.",2
2008,"So I decided to surprise my fianc\u00e9 one night by taking her here(because we've been talking about doing so for a while). We both got martinis and the nachos and buffalo spread apps. The martinis were just ok, and the food was very basic and nothing special. I will give the place another try and get some non appetizers next time and hope the bartender is a bit better at mixing the drinks.",2
2009,"At the request of a friend, we had a brief girls night out at Olive or Twist. My first impression was the outdated decor. The restaurant has carpet which I find off putting. The drink menu is extensive; but, with the exception of one person in my party, we each found our drinks far too sweet. I ordered the cucumber basil martini, which was so sweet I had to send it back. The food was mediocre. I ordered the burger medium and it was over cooked to nearly well done. And then there was the cheesy lounge singer who sang a mishmosh of singer songwriter tunes from the 80s. The music was so loud and so bad that my friends I left and headed down the street to Butcher and the Rye.",1
2010,"I stopped in last night for a drink with a group of friends... we were in town visiting and I had been wanting to try this place out since we walked past it on the last trip... what a disappointment.  The server was prompt to greet us and drop off drink menus, but then she failed to return to take our order for at least 20 minutes.  It would've been different if she had been slammed, but the entire time she was standing by the bar, just talking to her coworkers.  By the time she came to take our order we were ready to leave... and we should have... the martinis were not good and the server's disposition left much to be desired.  When we were ready to leave she made us feel like it was a bother to split our tabs between the five of us.  The one positive of the place was that I liked the ambiance, but it wasn't enough to make up for everything else being lackluster.  What I was hoping to be a great ending to the night turned into a dismal experience that put everyone in a bad mood.",1
2011,"Friday night out with one of my best friends and we were looking for a cool place to check out downtown. I always wanted to give this place a shot so we came here. The first floor was a little crowded , we arrived slightly before 6:00, so we headed up to their second floor and took some seats at the bar. \n\nOur bartender was very friendly. There weren't any signs or notes anywhere about happy hour specials, so I asked our bartender. I cannot remember everything that she stated, but I zoned in when she mentioned $2 off Martinis. I chose the cucumber basil martini and my friend did the same. Too strong for me- even with the basil infused vodka and fresh cucumber, my friend on the other hand found it light and refreshing. \n\nWe weren't that hungry so we decided to split an appetizer and order salads. We split the chicken quesadilla appetizer and both ordered house salads. I modified my house salad to have feta rather than blue cheese and chose the strawberry vinaigrette as my dressing. \n\nThe quesadillas were good, as far as chicken quesadillas go. The guacamole it was served with was awesome, although they didn't supply us with enough salsa, sour cream or guacamole for all four quesadillas. Or maybe I am just too obsessed with condiments, haha. \n\nThe salad was yummy , I loved the vinaigrette! It was a decent portion as well. \n\nAlthough I enjoyed the experience, I do not think I will be returning. Two drinks, two salads and one appetizer cost is $50. The Martinis alone, even with their happy hour deal, were still $8 each. I don't mind spending $50 on a meal, but for how average everything was, that was entirely too much. \n\nMaybe I will return for a drink or two one day.",3
2012,My family and I went to Olive or Twist before a Pirate Game. The food was delicious! I had the crab cake sandwich. The happy hour specials were also a plus. I had a cake batter martini which was tasty! The location is also convenient for anyone going to a game. We walked over Roberto Clemente bridge and were right there. We will definitely be going back! Great work Olive or Twist!,5
2013,"The bar staff is great, but the food quality has definitely taken a downward turn over the past year. I was recently at the bar and was overcome by a foul smell. For those of you that know what Urnex is, that's exactly what I thought (and hoped) it was. Alas, I was told by the bar staff that it was the scallops. Worse yet, they said they come from a can. I nearly puked. I love this place so much, but I am terribly saddened by the lack of the quality in the dishes coming out of the kitchen these days.",3
2014,"Go for the martinis, don't stick around for the food. \n\nI have been here several times for tiny tini Tuesdays - a weekly event that allows you to sample their colorful and delicious martini's in tiny glasses.  You order three at a time for a somewhat steep $12.  If you want variety though, this is not to be underestimated.  \n\nHowever, the food is always lacking.  I went on a lunch date here and decided to go for the grilled cheese and tomato basil soup as my stomach wasn't feeling up to anything more adventurous.  The grilled cheese was fine.  Nothing special.  The soup however had a thin drizzle of basil oil which when stirred in made the soup greasy and wholly unappetizing.  \n\nYour best bet is to head there after work for the martinis and then head around the corner to Six Penn for food.",3
2015,"Hands down one of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh! The atmosphere is great and the martini list is extensive. I've ordered the cake batter, caramel apple, and s'mores and haven't been disappointed in any so far. The buffalo chicken dip appetizer is what keeps us coming back! It is served cold in a martini glass with warm pita chips and is just amazing! I've ordered several dishes and haven't had a bad meal either!\n\nThe only thing that lacks sometimes is the service, especially on my last visit. We were standing at the hostess stand for a couple of minutes and no one came over. Finally a girl did but she just looked at us, got something, and walked away. Not even a \""someone will be right with you\"". Then another girl came over and said \""do you need a table?\"". I wanted to respond with \""why would I be standing at a podium that says let us seat you\"", but I refrained. We were seated, it took several more minutes for our drink order to be taken and it was subpar service the rest of the night. Waiting, waiting, and more waiting. \n\nOther than that, love the food, love the atmosphere and especially love the martinis!",4
2016,"Visited with a party of 8 last weekend for a friend's birthday. We walked in the door and could see no apparent host stand, so we tried the door next to the one we entered. This ended up leading to a private party. Can you say awkward?\n\nWe went back in the main door, clearly confused. The bartender looked at us but kept pouring drinks (rude!). Not even sure how we discovered it, but the host stand was in the BACK of the restaurant. How were we supposed to know this? We were seated, and had to wait awhile for service.\n\nFinally, the server came and took our drink orders and suggested a very strong drink for me. He was obviously trying to get me drunk (and succeeded). Caution: The Vesper is a strong *ss gin martini that is just okay. You pay 11 bucks to drink a shot of gin slowly from a fancy glass. \n\nHe then took our order...and did not think to write any of the 8 requests down. Yep, you guessed it. He screwed up our orders and bills, then proceeded to be rude about the situation. \n\nThe buffalo chicken dip is awesome, but be prepared, there is no chicken. We had one chunk in the two orders. The deep fried pita chips taste like donuts and are muy excellente. \n\nAlso, prepare yourself for bartenders squeezing caramel into glasses. The sound is reminiscent of flatulence. Over and over. So much flatulence. \n\nI was too drunk and full of pita donuts to eat my dinner. The two bites of my pork belly sandwich were pretty alright though.\n\nJesse from Bob Evans down the road is far superior to the condescending server here. We highly recommend Jesse.",2
2017,"After hearing about their cocktails, some colleagues and I came hear work for dinner and drinks. The drink menu is very extensive with lots of interesting options. S'mores, and cotton candy cocktails do not appeal to me but my friends who do enjoy them, loved their drinks. The waitresses were very accommodating and didn't hesitant when we asked them to split a check multiple ways. The crowd at Olive and Twist, is on the older side- it was entertaining being the only group of 20 something's there.",3
2018,This place was adorable. Very nice inside. Solid wood bar long L-shaped with chairs. They also had tables & chairs set up in the back half of the place for table seating. My co-worker and I sat at the bar close to the door and had a few drinks. They served food but we weren't offered a menu  (hence the 3 stars). The bartender wasn't very friendly-later I realize that was just her personality. Still not so cute! They have really good martinis. We had a s'mores which was awesome and came with a chocolate covered marshmallow. We also got a prickly pear. Mmmmmmmm is all I have to say. If I'm ever in Pitts again I would go back cause I know the drinks are very good!\nP. S. They also had an upstairs not sure what was going on up there. Thinking maybe it was a restaurant cause kids were going up with adults.,3
2019,Fantastic martinis!!,4
2020,"Always a good spot if you are craving a martini. As per the waitress recommendation, I ordered a pear martini and my husband had a Moscow mule. Both were delicious without being sweet. \n\nSome might find the dinner selection limited but I think it allows for the restaurant to highlight some great dishes. My husband had the Tuscan steak sandwich and he could not stop raving about it. He loved the pretzel roll that it was served on. I went a little more traditional and ordered a burger but it was a perfectly cooked burger. \n\nThis is not our first time stopping at Olive or twist and it will not be our last!",5
2021,"This was our second visit to Olive or Twist.  We came over this past summer for food and cocktails, but this last visit was just for the booze to have a celebratory drink with Laura M on her Birthday after seeing a great Ballet at the Benedum.  \nI don't mind O&T layout.  It's a bit chopped up but very Pittsburghese reminiscent of most establishments.  There is the upstairs where you can sit by the roaring fire on the 72\"" flat screen or lounge on many of the couches or loveseats they have available.  There is also the downstairs that seems to have similar offerings, however at least in our experiences was a lot busier than upstairs.  I pick less busy almost every time. This time around we found three bar seats available upstairs and settled down for a couple drinks.  \nI started with a Southern Tier XXX IPA, solid start to the evening.  I know they specialize in Martinis but I specialize in craft beer.  After that I decided to try a martini, I went with an Espresso Manhattan Martini.  This was defreakinlishious... I love coffee and I love manhattans so the two went together like peas and carrots.  Our service was mixed.  Some bartenders seemed more helpful and interested in waiting on us than others.  This was also my experience from last time.  This time we didn't order food though we were pretty hungry and went elsewhere to eat.  Our last meal here was not worth duplicating.  We both had an Olive or Twist Burger, and I chose sweet potato fries and requested a med rare cook.  We used the Yelp deal so it wasn't as expensive as it could have been, but the burger sells for $13.00.  I rarely complain about cost especially if it is good, however it really was not.  The meat was way overcooked and dry.  Surprisingly the fries were the best thing on the plate.  To spend that on a burger I do expect a better quality.  So lesson learned, we had some tasty drinks here last weekend, but ate at a neighboring facility afterwards.  I'm sure we will be back for drinks again.",3
2022,"Nice location, interesting cocktail menu, but nothing is done particularly well. I still go there, but I wish the cocktails were made using fresher ingredients.",3
2023,"This is my favorite Italian market in Pittsburgh.  I buy food from here almost every week.  It doesn't have the crazy selection (or crazy crowd) of Penn Mac, but what it does have is a serviceable meat and cheese counter, a good range of olive oils, a few different brands of canned tomatoes, nice pepperoni, and a tiny little produce section which is heavy on the peppers.  I usually get my pasta from here rather than Penn Mac.  They have a few different choices of brand, all of them decent, and you don't have to fight a hundred out-of-towners if you want something.  The people are friendly, and if you stop in frequently, they remember you (Penn Mac and a lot of the other stores are just too crowded for the level of fussing-over that you'll get here).  \n\nJimmy (the guy with the cigar permanently ensconced in his mouth) also makes fabulous pepperoni rolls and sandwiches.  We like to eat lunch here as a break during our grocery shopping.  During the warmer seasons, you should sit at the outside tables and people-watch, because you will see and hear some truly hilarious stuff (this is the place where I heard the guy from Hermanowski's corner store chatting with the nun selling raffle tickets about another nun, Sister Dominica or something similar, who had won $50 on the scratch-off lotto and blown it all on more scratch-off tickets).  There's also an upstairs dining room for when it gets colder out, though.",4
2024,"Completely agree with Deborah: decent sandwich on absolutely horrible bread - mealy tomato and brown lettuce, too.  I know it was only $4/$7 for a 6\""/12\"" sub, but it was pretty bad.  (I bought a 12\"", intending to take half home for later, but I wound up throwing the second half away, and I NEVER throw away food.)  \n\nAs a Italian grocery, it seems okay, but the attitudes are a little snippy, and it's a pretty grungy-looking place.",1
2025,"$3.00 fresh baked Italian loaf, need I say more.  The Italian bread is so yummy and makes great bruschetta.  They bake their bread fresh daily and do not include any preservative so eat it quick!",5
2026,"I need to indulge myself on the rest of this establishment but review is limited to the bread they sell on the street.  On a crowded street you will find a very funny bread-salesmen gunning for your attention to be focused on the racks of bread loafs behind him.  Well sir, you are in fact an excellent and carney-esque salesman but you need not do much.  The aroma emanating from the bread itself on a busy street is enough.  Goodness is the smell of freshly baked bread amazing.  And this place has a few standard options and some excellent \""different\"" options.  The cheesey jalapeno bread was incredibly delicious.  However, my favorite selection of the day was the freshly dressed (I want to say with some fresh tomato sauce and basil) toasted  bread.  WOW!",4
2027,"Don't go if you want a nice dining environment.  To say the furnishings in the dining area are spartan would be an understatement.\nBut, the food is fantastic.  Fresh made, fairly priced, and delicious.  Get a dessert cookie or cannoli to round out your lunch.  \nI hit this place every time I'm in Pittsburgh.  Everyone hears about Primanti's (which is good, dont get me wrong), but this place is every bit as good.",4
2028,"The italian coldcut sub was a travesty! Lots of STALE bread with skimpy meat portions, and no hots or flavor. Bread better suited for pigeons than people.

2029,"The Port Authority bus system in Pittsburgh gets a lot of attention. There are lots of articles in the newspapers, regular protests, petitions, etc over route reduction and fare hikes and so on. Some people think its slow, unreliable and overcrowded.\n\nThere's a general sense that its unfair that Pitt students ride for free while much of the Pitt staff do not. And, of course, the rest of the city has to pay too. \n\nBut I think all this is just a testament to the health of the system. People - students at all the college and universities, long-term residents, downtown commuters, school kids - actually value and use the bus system. \n\nIn other university towns (not to name names) the schools just give up entirely and shuttle their students around in private buses, which means, in the end, less ridership, fewer routes less frequently and less money for the public transportation. \n\nI also found the drivers to be considerate - especially of the elderly and disabled - and as helpful as they could be, given the demands on their time and attention. \n\nDepending on your living situation, the buses make it possible to live in Pittsburgh with one car, or none.  And I found that it's safer to take a bus in the snow, too, (if not quicker, which it *sometimes* also is).",4
2030,"Better than most transit systems in cities of this size. It gets you where you need to go, the bus fleet is reasonably new and clean, but there are some serious flaws.\n\nLack of a clear vision for the future (AKA a REAL rail system!?), and smart fare cards (which is supposedly coming). \n\nAlso, the unions need to stop strangling the cash out of the Port Authority. I mean seriously......bus drivers making 90k a year? Something is wrong with that.",3
2031,"Very nice cheap quick bus service to airport. (28X).  but i think i've found out what happens to all the old buses in Seattle, they are shipped to Pittsburgh, old polluting diesel buses seem to be the norm.\n\nthey also run the inclines, which are pretty cool if not old.",4
2032,"It worked, it was on time, and the 28x got me where i was going for all of $2.60. Besides that it was freezing cold, loud, and the older bus seats were fairly uncomfortable, I can't really complain. \n\nWe did arrive 5 minutes early for a bus that never came. The next one arrived on schedule, but it was raining so we spent 20 minutes in the rain. \n\nThat said, we took the bus many more times reliably than that one time when it didn't show.\n\nOverall, a pretty good system.",3

Why do I need to request a stop on the \""T\""?\n\nOf the public transportation systems I've used, this is definitely the most confusing so far.

2035,"I regularly take the bus to work and am grateful that Pittsburgh has a bus system.  Google Maps seems to have fairly up-to-date schedules to determine which buses to take to get from one location to another.  It's also free for me as a Pitt employee.  \n\nHowever, my main complaints are\n\n1. The buses are way too crowded during rush hour.  Not only are the buses almost always so full that the standing room is occupied, but bus drivers some times even have to drive by peeved people at bus stations because the bus is completely full.  \n2. Irregular intervals.  Buses have a tendency to bunch.  This some times results in having to wait at a bus station for a long time before seeing two buses together.  The lead bus is overcrowded and the second bus is usually pretty empty.  Note:  Bus bunching is a well-known phenomenon.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_bunching\n3. Waiting outside in the cold for the bus.  Because of irregular intervals, you some times have to wait outside in Pittsburgh weather for significant time.\n\nPittsburgh needs to install GPS on their buses!  This has been implemented in Washington DC and San Francisco already.\n1.  People could check online or on their smart phones when the next bus was about to arrive so they could wait in the comfort of their homes or offices, rather than cold Pittsburgh weather, and   \n2.  Bus drivers could adjust their driving speeds to avoid bunching.",3
2036,"I called Pittsburgh my temporary home three summers in a row. I went to the University of Pittsburgh for SLI: Summer Language Institute from '05-'07. The university, in an effort to accommodate out-of-state students as much as possible, provided \""free\"" bus passes (these were factored into your cost of attending). With my full scholarship and pass, I had every intention of keeping this trip on the cheap by walking everywhere I could and using public trans for everything else.\n\nMy first experience with the Port Authority was taking the 28X Airport Flyer from the International Airport to the Oakland campus, which is roughly 20 miles away. The bus runs from 5:20am to 1:01am every day of the week. The opposite direction is just as convenient and starts at 4:25am with last pickup at 11:51pm. The trip takes about an hour and there are buses every 30 minutes or so. The drive is very scenic and gives you a good feel for all that Pitt has to offer.\n\nThroughout the week students of Serbian, Russian and Bulgarian came together and went on little excursions to pass the free time. The major super market in the area is Giant Eagle (\""Jynt Igel\"", if you want to get local). There was one within walking distance of campus, but it was much more of an adventure to take the 61A, 61C or 61D to Squirrel Hill (\""Skvirel\"", if you want to get Slavic with it) and shop there. We also preferred this since the main street is lined with Greek, Russian and Jewish stores and restaurants. There is also a good number of family owned arts and crafts shops, handmade goods stores and other small businesses.\n\nIf we were feeling like we really wanted a change of scenery, we'd ride the 61C or 61D farther down SW and cross the Allegheny to Homestead, PA. There is a large shopping center with all the luxuries of corporate America from AMC Loews Waterfront 22 and Target to Chick-Fil-A and Dave & Busters. The distance is only 6 miles, but it always took forever and a day. You're looking at 45 minutes in perfect traffic conditions.\n\nAnother shopping option was the Southside Riverfront. It was a mere 3 mile ride and could be accessed by hopping on the 75 or 54. We rode it many times to visit H&M for cheap clothing and REI to get travel essentials (many students end up going abroad through their respective language programs). This area was also the place to be on weekends and has a number of eateries and dive bars.\n\nOne little known fact about SLI is that you are not saved by the bell. When class is over you are still a student of the linguistic arts and expected to practice as much as possible. This includes lunches with your professors and peers, dinner dates with other students, and cultural excursions. The American Serbian Club was considered the mecca of the language students, regardless of which language they were studying. It is also located in South Side, so the 75 or 54 will get you within blocks of its doorstep. Both run pretty frequently, all day and all night.\n\nBut my absolutely best memory of the Port Authority has to be my first day back in Pittsburgh in 2006. I had decided to skip staying in the dorms and opted to go even cheaper by renting an apartment nearby. I had just arrived and was getting to know my roommates. We went for a walk around campus and ended up somewhere just NW of the school. It started to downpour and as we were scurrying for cover, a little shuttle bus driver pulled over and offered us a ride. We asked him where he was headed and in perfect Pittsburghese he replied, \""Wherever yinz is a goin'.\""",4
2037,"I've only taken Port Authority transit in the summer.  That probably colors my opinion on it, because they've never made me wait out in the cold.  \n\nI think to me, the best thing about the Port Authority is that it exists.  We're in a city that's really starved for decent transit options, and crippled by awful infrastructure, but the PAT buses have done me pretty well.\n\nI would not want to take the bus to get somewhere where I had to be there on time.  That seems like it'd be a mistake.  You can't really get one of these without waiting for a while.  Still, once you're on, they're cheap, comfortable enough, and the drivers are really helpful.  If you have questions about where you get off for what, they can answer them.\n\nBut for weekend bumming-around, it sure is nice not to have to touch my car.  \n\nThank you, Port Authority, for saving me from driving.",3
2038,"Oh, PAT buses, why can't I quit you?\n\nHere's the deal: I 100% blame Pittsburgh's bus system problems on Port Authority.  Between the winding bus routes, the inability of buses to show up on time, and the outrageous money spent on retirement plans, it should be disbanded.  The city needs to take over and reconfigure the entire system.  The Post-Gazette has printed some great pieces that explain how the system could be overhauled.\n\nI've been a bus rider since birth (I still never drive), and it's only gotten worse over the years.  Some routes are great (outside of rush hours), others are ridiculous, and some good routes were recently cut.  Until transfers are free (which they should be within an hour window, in my opinion), it was insane to cut the 500, which added $10 a week to my bus tab just to get to work.\n\nIt is usable?  If you don't care about being on time.  I shouldn't have to show up 10 minutes early to catch a bus that should be coming by every 20 minutes according to the schedule.  I shouldn't have to stand in the middle of downtown traffic to flag down the 28x Airport Flyer when I'm standing at the stop and have an enormous purple suitcase.  When I'm going to work, I look up when I should be arriving...And then go back 1-2 time blocks to make sure I'm on time since I can't trust the bus.\n\nBus riders understand not all buses use the exclusive bus lanes, but maybe Port Authority should build the delays that happen every day into the schedule.  For example, there is not a chance that an inbound 71B takes a similar amount of time during the morning rush hour as it does mid-day.  I know this from experience.  Why doesn't the schedule know this?\n\nThe buses are so bad that now that I am two miles from work, I walk to and from every day.  In fact, I often BEAT the 71B home.  That means as I stroll two miles down Fifth Avenue, not a single bus passes me.  On the busiest section of the busiest non-highway street in Pittsburgh (data according to me).  How is this possible?\n\nFinally, we live in Pittsburgh.  It's cold or raining or miserable most of the year.  I would gladly take fewer stops in exchange for heated bus shelters.  It would also be nice if these imaginary shelters could have bus arrival information.  Pitt's on the right track with their bus shelters at the Cathedral--take note.",2
2039,"I would give it a \""1-star\"" review but the caption under \""2-star\"" is more like it, \""Meh.  I've experience better.\""\n\nI have a love-hate relationship with PAT.  The buses are unreliable timing wise and a majority of the drivers are jerks.  From having to be 10 minutes early (I shouldn't have to play it safe!) to being prepared to wait for a couple buses since rush hour means over crowded buses ... PAT is like a powder keg.  You just never know when its going to blow up on your commute.\n\nI do ride the bus daily.  And yes, it would take me the exact amount of time to drive in/out to work.  So honestly ... I treat PAT like I treat Airplane travel.  I get there when I get there ... as lone as I get there safely the on-time part is something I have learned to stop prioritizing as long as I'm riding a PAT bus.  ((Seriously tho, there's something wrong about having to make that concession!!))",2
2040,"Last night marked the second time in a week that I waited 30 minutes or more for a 71B in the freezing cold rain.   I was 5 minutes early for the bus I was trying to catch.  I can understand a delay during rush hour, but this was not.  The bus was running every 20 minutes both times, according to the PAT schedule. When I gave up last night and went into my apartment, it was an additional 10 minutes before the bus went by...So let's review: I waited a total of 45 minutes for a bus that was supposed to be coming past every 20 minutes.  For shame!\n\nFrom now on, I'll be hoofing it across the East End instead of buying a bus pass.  It will be cold, but at least I'll be moving.",1
2041,"I don't even really know where to begin with this review. I guess the most sensical thing to do with such a nonsensical transit system is a pros and cons list. (If nothing it will be the quickest and least painful for me and for you, my dear sweet reader.)\n\nPros -\nIt is rare to find I can't get a bus to a place I want to go. Truth be told I don't leave the city a whole lot, but anytime I want to get somewhere with some leg work I can find a bus to take me where I want.\n\nMy morning bus (especially the insanely early 5am 86 from Bloomfield to work and the gym downtown) is almost always on time. \n\nCons - \nIt's a known fact that the last 54 from the Southside to the East End/Oakland/Etc rarely to never comes and the \""last one\"" is NOT late enough to be considered an after the bars options to get home.\n\nIt's pretty common for the buses to either be a full 15 min early or 10 min late.\n\nI've seen more than one person pee themselves.\n\nI've had a bus driver just plain ignore my request for a stop and then ignore ME while I'm telling them as much.\n\nPACKED buses and constantly cutting routes and trips.\n\nDirty buses.

2042,"Don't ever get too comfortable with PAT--- they end up swiping everything out from under your feet, and then charging you a crapload for it.

You're not even offering a bus to the airport anymore here soon--- Do you know how many people ride that bus to WORK at/around the airport.  I tell you what.... Whoever runs your company is A DUMBASS to the 10th degree.\n\nGet your shit together.  Seriously.

2043,"Well, it does get one from point A to point B in Pittsburgh.\n\nBut it's expensive, at least compared to the Metro Transit in Minneapolis that I'm used to. On Port Authority, it's $2.25 for a ticket, and an extra $1 for a transfer (which only gets you on one more bus, not all the way to your destination if it requires a bunch of transfers.) Coming from a maximum of $3 for two and a half hours of bus rides (express bus during rush hour), Port Authority is steep. I had to grab cash a couple of different times just to make sure I could keep paying fares throughout the days.\n\nThere's no day pass. Boo. If you're traveling a lot throughout the day, it adds up fast without some sort of pass.\n\nAlso, the 28X doesn't pick up passengers coming from downtown into Oakland (or drop them off in the reverse direction.) Very frustrating, especially with a Megabus terminal only three blocks away from one of the stops. (There's also Greyhound and Amtrak downtown, if I remember correctly.)",2
2044,"A BIG FAT DISAPPOINTMENT\n\n\nI am concerned with the future of Port Authority, will Pittsburgh continue to have bus service as we know it?\nPort Authority constantly causes me a great deal of anxiety.

How could I have forgotten? \nI have been shut in bus doors by ignorant, rude, nasty bus drivers Twice!!! \n\nAnd when it happen the first time, the bus drive wouldn't even apologize to me, \nThe bus drivers are a miserable bunch, just down right rotten,",2
2045,"I don't understand why Pittsburghers routinely put up with the idiocy that is our public transportation system.  Port Authority of Allegheny County is public transportation with massive, severe, permanent brain damage.  Unreliable, buses routinely don't come at all during heavy commuting times (like when you're trying to get to work on time), many of the drivers are assholes, the fare doubled in a decade and the service was cut in half.  The county refuses to fund it.  Getting on and off is confusing.  When to pay is confusing.  The schedules are hard to read.  The service isn't frequent enough.  The subway system only goes to one neighborhood from downtown.  This is horrible and it's one of the main things keeping Pittsburgh from being as great a city as it can be.  Call center people are sometimes rude and mostly unresponsive.  What else?  The buses smell like urine.  Sucks, sucks, sucks.

2046,"I took the bus several times on a recent trip to Pittsburgh.\n\nThe 28X/\""airport flyer\"" is a good option to get from PIT to the city--and at $3.75, probably $35(?) cheaper than a cab. The bus was also reliable in getting from my Oakland hotel to Downtown, and from Oakland to Regent Square--especially considering the dearth of cabs in the city. The regular fare of $2.50 is a bit steep for the shorter trips, and when to pay can be confusing (sometimes when you board, sometimes when you exit), but those are minor annoyances.\n\nTIP: Download the Tiramisu app for real-time bus tracking. Worked great while I was there, and I loved that you could enter the time you got on the bus, so the app would adjust arrival times for future stops accordingly--terrific idea.",3

The bus number is 5525. \n\nI will call the Port Authority in a few minutes to lodge my complaint; however, I wanted to lodge it here too for two reasons. First, the complaint bears on the Port Authority's ability to keep its riders safe (because the driver almost caused an accident, which could have resulted in injuries to the riders of the bus). Second, if this driver causes an accident in the future, I hope this complaint will help injured parties make a case for negligent retention or negligent supervision against the Port Authority.",1
2048,"As a car-less denizen of PGH, I rely on PAT buses to get from Point A to Point B.

As a PITT employee, the price (free) is right.\n\nHaving said this, I have several gripes:\n\n1.) Buses almost never run on time, and there's no way to know when the next one is coming other than asking the other people at the bus stop how long they've been waiting. Come on, it's 2014--a GPS-enabled device should be in every bus so you can check to see where it is, or there should be a SMS alert system.  Singapore had this for their buses in 2010!\n\n2.) Some drivers can be surly or just downright ignorant. More than once, a bus has passed me when waiting at a stop for no apparent reason, or has failed to hold on for 5-10 s. as I huffed and puffed to catch it. For whatever reason, the outbound 28X seems to be especially problematic.  True story: Last time I rode it, the driver didn't know where she was going, and we ended up crossing the Liberty Bridge, despite pax telling her this wasn't the route. To make matters worse, this was the last 28X of the night, so due to this detour, I didn't get home until after 1am.\n\n3.) Regardless of which route you ride, the clientele can be a bit sketch. Some drivers will also let homeless people ride without paying/a voucher out of pity. On one occasion, a pax regaled the bus with nonsensical poetry (not sure if he was under the influence or just mentally incapacitated...), and the driver did nada about it (though it was amusing).\n\n4.) The system of when to pay is nonsensical.  Despite having a terminal degree and having lived in PGH for 3 years, I still haven't figured it out, and have to rely on cues from the bus driver. While I understand the reason behind it (the free zone downtown), there must be a less confusing solution.  Get on it!\n\n5.) For those who don't have a PITT or CMU pass, fares--including monthly passes--are expensive ($2.50 per trip). Pro Tip: For a round trip, when you pay for the first leg, ask for a transfer and use it on the second leg--this shaves $1.50 off your fare.\n\n6.) Even in Oakland, where route options are better than in most areas of the city, there are no direct buses to some areas I'd like to visit (e.g., the Strip). Also, other than the P1 from downtown, buses serving the East Busway only run during rush hour on weekdays, and even the P1 only runs hourly off rush hour.\n\nI've ridden public transit in other cities, and for its size, PGH should have a better system and lower fares.  For starters, the T (light rail) should be expanded to run east-west along the busways, given that it's currently a line to nowhere.",2
2049,"4.5 stars????   Really?????  Based on what?   The food is okay, but not great; standard breakfast diner fare.  The staff is friendly.  The prices are all right for what you get.  What I found most annoying was the uncomfortable seating.  The seats at the counter were torn and tilting off the base.  The booths were fast-food style: hard and tight.  It's as if they designed the seating to be uncomfortable so that you wouldn't linger.",2

Food is delicious, decor looks like a dirty truck stop.  \n\nThe omelets are INSANE, bigger than my head.. speaking of things bigger than my head.. the Sausage patties are in fact that large.  \n\nService is what you'd expect, pretty good for an overworked crew.",5
2052,"First off:  I'm a picky eater, so take this with a grain of salt.\n\nOkay, I'm not from pittsburgh.  I am not overweight, not a hipster, not on any of the plethora of drugs, I own my own home,  Probably most of all, I've never heard anything about this place before walking in, so I had no idea what to expect besides \""Lets get breakfast.\""\n\nIf you are the opposite of any of these points, this place is probably worth a try for you.\n\nWe had a horrendous wait, but I think that was a complete fluke:  we had a huge group and there was an event that weekend...I don't think anyone with less than 3-4 had that long of a wait at all.\n\nThe waitresses are ornery, but not rude...just clear.  They aren't going to make nice or kiss your rear, they're not there for that.  I found this respectable, and liked it.\n\nBut the food?  Oh God.\n\nPros:  Portions are massive, all the other reviews will tell you that.\n            1) Prices are reasonable, cheap even, but I suppose that has something to do with the fact that the first pound or two of your meal is pure potato.  Seriously...I think I had at *least* three idaho russets in chipped form on my plate alone.\n            2) ....uhm.  ....  Nothing was dry?\n\nCons:  There was no color anywhere.  Absolutely everything on every plate I saw in the place was some blend of beige.  Potatoes, egg white, pancake, sausage...after you tilted the whatever-grease-that-was out of your dish, everything was the same color.  \n             Half my dish was potato.  \n             The egg was not over-medium, it was still-runny, even the whites.  I presume this was because they were slammed, and didn't have time to cook what were almost certainly factory-chicken eggs.\n             The sausage was not identifiably sausage.\n             I had my entire day's required calories in butter alone on the toast.\n             There was seriously nothing remotely healthy on this menu.  Nothing raw, nothing green, nothing fresh, not even as an ingredient. Even McDonalds has a fruit cup, ffs!  TACO BELL has better quality food!\n             \n\nTake one look at the clientele when you walk in.  It attracts exactly the kind of people you would picture in a dingy greasy-spoon truck-stop.  If you are not one of those people, Do Not Bother, this place makes Denny's look classy.",1

First a group of guys, then their girlfriends.

2056,"This review is for both the particular location that I used back on September 23rd, 2012 and for Avis' customer service on their 800 number just now.\n\nI had arrived to Pittsburgh at 6am via bus from NYC and had several options for renting a car (see photo). Avis turned out to be the best deal on top of being located in an easy-to-find location (in addition to being easy to return the car).\n\nI was aware of a 29-minute grace period before being charged another day (or hour). The clock/timer on the parking garage entrance was 6 minutes fast, and me being me, this mattered. It said I returned at 8:47 even though my cell phone showed 8:41am. I immediately took a photo, intending to use this in case I were to be overcharged, even though the location doesn't open for business until 9am and wouldn't be able to rent the car out to anyone for another ~20 minutes anyway.\n\nI was back in Pittsburgh on October 9th and made it a special point to get back to the place so I could resolve the situation in person. It turned out that it's hard for the particular store location to make adjustments if it's been more than a few days. The guy there, Francis, said it's not a huge deal to make the adjustment but that it's out of his control and that if I call the 800 number, it should be fine.\n\nPause for ~6 months.\n\nSo yeah, today I finally made time to pick up the papers and phone and make a call. They first said I returned the car late and then after I explained the situation and offered to send the photo I took that demonstrates the clock discrepancy, they gave me a 'one-time courtesy' and I'm now ~75 dollars richer. Or less poor. Your call.",5

2063,"JR H and I seemed to miss each other this weekend in Pitt. Always going to the same place yet not really.  Our little group, which inlcuded the parents(yeah i still get free food) went to the Market Square location. The location is nice. Market Square is a nice area. Brick inlaid street. Clsoe to 3 river point park and my hotel.\nThis restaurant is something one must do when in town. It was also on Food Network, and man times reviewed here at Yelp. The food is pretty good. Where else can you get a \""value meal\"" between to slices of bread. The sandwiches for those just learning. Your choice of meat with some nice itailian deli selections, kolbassi(haven't seen that  on a menu i around SF), or fish, below a nice bed of fresh made and not too dripping wet coleslaw. Fries with that? Heck yes and they sit right on top.  All on a Itialian sliced bread. The have a daily beer special 24oz beer for about  $2.50. \nNow this place and the food is fun. The food gets better tasting as the hours get late on a night out. Think how great a bacon wrapped dog is after \""dancing\"" the night away. You know that fun 3 step dance. Raise beer, tip glass, put back down. The kind of food and place you want to head when you cheat on your diet, watch some footbal and chat up with the locals.\nThe staff was very good. The food came quick. Best of all. It had no kick back later or the next day.",4
2064,"God I miss this place. Best sandwiches in the Burgh. If you are down near the Strip, you have got to swing by here. Get the pastrami or roast beef and do not ask for the slaw or fries on the side. It's all on there for a purpose and it is a gloriously messy sandwich.",5
2065,"Whenever I happen to be in Pittsburgh, I would come by to this great place for lunch.\n\nThe sandwiches are HOT! Whether it is steak & cheese, or fish & cheese, or even hot sausages and cheese, man, it is ALL good. With literally a pile of tasty french fries and sauerkraut like cold slaw in the middle, the sandwich is huge, all for under $6. Add a local Yuengling beer (America's oldest and best brewery) if you like.\n\nIf the sandwich is too much for you to handle, take a stroll at the tri-state park.\n\nThe place is usually very busy at lunch time, with waitresses hustling around, wearing store T-shirt knotted around the waist, dashing in and out (since they do have outdoor tables). On the back of their T's, there is a vivid picture of the gigantic sandwich. When they turn around, you just cannot help notice their boobs too. I guess the sandwiches are as attractive as nice boobs :-)\n\nA drooling place. Period.",5
2066,"Here's how you can make your own Primanti Bros Sandwich at home:\n\nTake two slices of Italian Bread, between them, mash together bland cole slaw, fries, some assorted meat, tomatoes.

We weren't really drunk when we were eating here, and it was in the middle of the day. \n\nThe service was pretty slow, but when our order was taken, the sandwich came out very fast.\n\nIt was a good sandwich in terms of having really hot meat, and cold tomatoes and cole slaw, but I didn't think its as tasty as it could have been.\n\nI think the bread should be buttered and toasted/grilled texas toast, and they should use seasoned fries. Use some sweet North Carolina style Cole slaw. \nI came, I saw, and I conquered, but I'm giving it back. I probably won't be back ever again.",2
2067,"One night I was watching the Travel channel, they had a show called Top 10 Places to Pig Out.  Of course I paying attention and taking notes :)  When they mentioned Primanti's and Pittsburgh I was like Yes! I'm there!  I could not wait to get my hands on this giant sammich of all sammiches.  My only regret is that I couldn't get it with a Yeungling :( All the more reason to come back!  Ok, so I went here with my host and we decided to strategize.  I got the capicola ham with provolone and he got the steak and cheese.  We got two sammiches and two cokes for $16, what a deal! We were supposed to share but ended up downing our own sammiches. I forgot to ask if the coleslaw was sweet before I ordered so I was a little worried, not a fan of sweet coleslaw.  Luckily, it was great! \nHere's the nitty gritty.  The sandwich bread is two thick slices of soft, white italian bread.  They put at least half a pound of meat on it, plenty of cheese, tomatoes, and a fresh coleslaw (not the mayonaissey type that I was expecting).  It's more like a marinated shredded cabbage, the marinade is tangy and vinegary.  The piece de resistance is that the sandwich also contains a huge mound of fries right in the middle.  The fries taste fresh, reminiscent of boardwalk fries back in the day, only better.  At the table they had ketchup, mustard and apple cider vinegar!  Any one from MD would appreciate that ;-)  All I needed was Old Bay seasoning and it woulda been heaven.  Maybe next time I'll take that in my purse...ssshh! Needless to say I devoured this bad boy and desperately needed a nap afterwards.    I came. I saw. I ate.\n\np.s. You can get it topped with a fried egg! I didn't see that on the menu until I was leaving! doh! next time!",4

The meal started off pretty well with $2 Yuenglings and amazing chili, cheese, sour cream and bacon fries.  However, things took a turn for the worse when the famous sandwiches came out.  Two of us had the turkey and one had the colossal fish.  I thought the turkey was slimy and tasted weird.  The fries added almost no flavor to the sandwich, and the cole slaw was gross.  The bread was terrible, and overall, the sandwich made me nauseous.  Totally not worth it, unless you just go for the fries and drinks.",2
2069,"Dude. A meal on Mancini Bros. bread. Not much to say, except I'll have to book more trips to Pittsburgh to eat here again! Definitely a good way to gear up for or finish a night of drinking.

2070,"If ewe don like Primanti's, yer a jag-off.\n\nAs much a Pittsburgh institution as the Stillers, Irn City, and Sophie Masloff.  Much like referring to Kleenex, to native yinzers, you just go and get a Primanti's.  No need for any further descriptives.  \n\nThe secret to the sandwich is the bread: thickly sliced Mancini's bread.  Rumor has it that Primanti's opened a location in Florida.  It didn't do very well because they weren't able to get the Mancini's.  There you go.  My favorite version of the Primanti's is the steak and cheese.  It's a beef patty and cheese (not sliced beef as in a cheese steak).  This is the only thing I will eat tabasco on.  Fresh, thick cut fries and mild vinegar based cole slaw.  Piled up perfection.\n\nOnly visit the Strip District location for the full effect.  The other locations pale in comparison.",5

2072,Update.  Went to a different location.  Non-smoking location.  Got pastrami this time instead of the bland sausage.  Added a fried egg to the sandwich as well.  I forgot how huge this thing was.  I could only eat half.  I am now a fan of Primanti's.,4

Like gnats, we were attracted to Primati because their neon sign was... pretty.... soooooo pretty!\n\nAnyway, stopped in here and order the Pittsburgh cheesesteak which was quite tasty. We also got the Cajun chicken sandwich with cheese... because everything there comes with cheese. Everything. Need salt? Even that has cheese on it. It's kinda awesome.\n\nAnyway, both sandwiches were quite tasty and with the fries on top... yummy.  Would definitely come back here next time I'm coming through Pittsburgh, hopefully for longer than a few hours.",4
2074,"We ate at Primanti Bros based on the reviews on Yelp, hoping to get a real taste of Pittsburgh. What I ordered was a sandwich labeled Pittsburgher Cheese Steak. What I got was an inedible slab of overcooked mystery meat, cole slaw, and mediocre fries, on white bread. The sandwich was very small, but I only ate 1/2 of it anyway, and I have a pretty big appetite. I recently ate a 20 oz cheeseburger at a local burger joint.\n\nI was truly shocked. That was the worst meat that I have seen since Junior High School. We would have been much better off at Burger King. Luckily we had a nice lunch at Salim's to wash the taste of this junk of our mouths.",1

2076,"This is my second dance with Primanti's.  The first was at the Pitt location, which has a better atmosphere in my humble opinion.  I had the #2 most requested sandwich, Cheesesteak.  I asked the waitress what was the most requested item and she said, \""You're drinking it honey.\"" pointing to my Iron City pint.  Which was $2.95 by the way.  God bless the Burgh.  \n\nSo the sandwich is as I remember.  Huge, but if you squeeze you can get your mouth around it.  I realized my second time around that there's a reason they can keep prices low.  There's not a whole lot of meat in the sandwich.  It's dwarfed by the coleslaw and the fries.  I'd also pass on the cheesesteak next time.  It was a square beef patty which didn't seem right and there wasn't a lot of flavor.  Would get pastrami next time for sure.  \n\nSo the sandwich and decor of this location would rate 3 stars, but the concept of a restaurant that serves you an oversized sandwich with coleslaw and fries on it for  around 5 bucks rates 5, so it equals out to 4.  This sandwich and chain are one of the reasons I love the Burgh so much.",4
2077,"I'm gonna get slaughtered for giving this place a bad review, but whatever. \n\nI was told by several people that I absolutely HAD to check out Primanti Bros while I was in Pittsburgh. I was excited about visiting this institution during my stay... but it really didn't deliver for me. \n\nYes, this was a huge sandwich with fries and cole slaw in it, but the sheer quantity of food didn't make up for the fact that it was really bland. Maybe I just got the wrong thing (the Pittsburger Cheese Steak - which is somehow their #2 seller...?). My friend liked her sandwich, which was eggs and bacon, I believe. Maybe we just went to the wrong Primanti Bros location. \n\nI would give this place another shot if I'm ever in town again, but my first impression wasn't a great one.",2
2078,"GROSS!!! Many people told me to go here and I was totally disappointed! It was bland, the coleslaw was too tangy (and only contained cabbage) and the meat was scary! Good thing it's super cheap. Do NOT get the cheese-steak sandwich if you go even though it says #2 best seller, it's awful! \n\nOkay on to service... Everyone seemed like they hated their job. Someone at my table asked for no tomatoes and add onions and of course she got tomatoes and no onions.\n\nMaybe I ordered the wrong thing and maybe they were all just having a bad day... Who knows.",1
2079,"i was here for work and ordred the #2  The cheesesteak was nice and square and stuff.  Hmm not sure if that's a good thing?  The combination of coleslaw and fries plus that really nice thick spongy bread was pretty good.  I would actually say this would be more like a 4 star sandwich but I have a deep seeded hatred for the Steelers so yeah whatever.  I'd like to see a sandwich superbowl, Seattle vs Pittsburgh yeah!!!",3
2080,"Alright, I heard about this chain on Man v. Food and we just had to try it out. And honestly, we were quite disappointed. The sandwich is tasteless unless you douse it with condiments or get a particularly flavorful filling. I got the cheese one and my boyfriend got the colossal fish (both vegetarians--its not so friendly for us...fail). Neither sandwich was impressive--in size or taste. I'm a 5\""4' and 120lb girl and I finished mine no problem. Just incredibly bland. The bread tasted like cheap white bread, the fries were just incredibly greasy, the cole slaw was hardly cole slaw and more like wet cabbage. The cheese on mine was basically tasteless and my boyfriends fish was definitely from a box of something frozen. Very disappointing.",2
2081,"The description of a Primanti Bros sandwich is tastier than the sandwich itself.  One of two dozen different meats topped with french fries and coleslaw;  I tried hot sausage.  The problem is that all that potato and cabbage mutes the flavor of the meat.  Expecting an extremely tasty sandwich, I found myself adding salt and ketchup.  Regardless of the sandwich not living up to expectations, I would go back if I lived in the area because it is a really pleasant place with draft beer and some outdoor seating.",3
2082,"Everyone knows that that if you go to Pittsburgh, you go to Primanti Bros. (My friends and I were in town for a Pirates/Phillies game, and the PNC Park Primanti Bros was packed the entire game.) We visited the Market Square location, and if you eat on the patio, it's a fun place to hang out and drink some Iron City beers. \n\n I got the Black Angus Sandwich. It was quite large, cut in half, and brought on a piece of wax paper. As it turned out, I'm pretty sure the wax paper would have tasted better. It was really, really, not good. I did eat the first half, but the bread was so tasteless, I thought maybe it would be better if I ate the other half piece by piece. The coleslaw was OK, but the french fries were awful, and the little bit of actual meat had little taste. We had little to no contact with employees, but a cab driver told us about a young couple who dared to ask for a sandwich at another Primanti Bros without coleslaw, and were treated really rudely. Because you know, people being rude is hilarious. \n\nSo I guess if you want an authentic Pittsburgh experience then go here. But if you want actual decent food, avoid at all costs",1
2083,"Everyone that comes to Pittsburgh must try Primanti Bros at least once. I have been there multiple times but this is my first review of the place. The sandwich is something to see and eat especially after a night of drinking. The original location is definitely the best especially for the people watching aspect. \n\nI chose the sandwich with bacon and cheese and it was definitely consistent with the other times I have been there, but I will say this after you have gone once you will never need to go back unless its late and you need something to soak up the alcohol.",4
2084,"There were French fries on my sandwich!\nThis is my first time in PA, so I wasnt sure what to expect when we were sent to Market Square for \""the greatest sandwich in the world!\""\n\nThe prices were dead on - about 6$ for a sandwich and 1.5$ for a tea.  I split a ham and cheese with my friend and we both left full.  I had the cole slaw (which was more like sauerkraut) and it was yummy.\n\nI am docking them a star because the service was less than desirable, even after the lunch rush ended.",4

Just the right amount of meat (I hate it when the meat overpowers the entire sandwich), yummy vinegary cole slaw that made the sandwich refreshing, tomato, swiss, and of course french fries in the sandwich.  It was a good, ginormous sandwich just not as AMAZING as I thought it would be... If I come back to Pittsburgh I'd probably come back to try a different sandwich.",3

The bread was devoid of texture and flavor.\n\nSo, yeah, I didn't order it The Way It's Supposed To Be. Maybe if you're into cole slaw, this is the place to go, but if you don't, keep walking.

This place is really connected to Pittsburgh itself and Conan even mentioned it in one of his shows as a place to eat at.\n\nOrdered the \""2nd most popular\"" item which was the cheesesteak that was very, very plain. Nothing great about the patty. The thing was HUGE and stacked with fries and coleslaw which I found didn't work well (although there are others out there that do it with success!)\n\nYou can't deviate and ask for it without the coleslaw either and their menu stated it as \""All of our sandwiches come with...\""\n\nThe portions are huge, one order can feed 2 average appetites.  \n\nThe fries were the only upside of this place.\n\nThe service here is horrible.. there was 2 people running the place and our tables werent clean and it takes forever.. I don't blame it on the servers but whoever manages the place.\n\nI don't think I will ever go back again.",2
2093,"When I told people I was going to Pittsburgh, everyone recommended Primanti Bros. I went and was underwhelmed. It was a big sandwich, but the flavour was not amazing. I also ordered a bowl of chili which was too spicy for me. As a Chicago native, I feel it's the equivalent of people recommending Giordano's or Portillo's. They're not exactly the greatest places in town, but they're well-known and popular for one reason or another. Do it just to say you did.\n\nI don't like coleslaw.",2
2094,I am still trying to figure out how to transport a few sandwiches back on the plane.....There is just something about Pittsburgh and their traditional comfort food!  I have addicted my husband.,5
2095,eh.\n\nGo here once to say you did. You'll get a sandwich with soggy fries and coleslaw on it. It will be pretty huge. That is all.\n\nI might go back to check out the nightlife. I'll update my review then.,2
2096,"It wasn't bad, but it definitely wasn't good. \n\nAs soon as we walked in the door the place was jammed back with people who were not interested in seating anyone or telling anyone they would be seated. On one side of the restaurant there were literally two girls working, and one of them was pregnant. You can imagine the chaos. I wanted to have this \""Pittsburgh\"" experience that I've heard so much about but honestly I was more than underwhelmed. \n\nAfter being seated, it took the waitress 10 minutes to get around to actually saying hello to us and in between that time a large group of people decided to squeeze in a booth behind our table making my friend having to get up every time a waitress or another person needed to squeeze back there.\n\nThe sandwich at best was mediocre. The coleslaw was a bit too vinegary for my tastes and became sickening after the first half of the sandwich. I needed a lot of ketchup to even finish the sandwich. Not to mention I got a nice souvenier of vinegary smelling hands afterwards. \n\nIf you're a tourist, go do it to say you had a colossal sandwich and lived the \""Pittsburgh\"" experience. Apart from that, I don't know why you'd return.",2
2097,"I saw this place on Man vs Food and thought I would check it out. I ordered the pastrami with cheese. The sandwich was humongous!!!! It was filled with cheese, pastrami, coleslaw and french fires. It was very messy to eat but it was so good. I only drawback to this place was the service. My waitress was not very friendly and she got my order mixed up with the table next to me. She didn't even apologize for the mix up. Other than that it was a great experience and I recommend anyone who is going to the steel city to get some Primanti Bros.",3
2098,"Woulda been a 1 star review if not for our cute & courteous waitress.\n\nThat said: YUCK!   This was my second supremely dissapointing Primanti's experience in nearly a decade of living in this fine little city.  I guess the fascination with this place must be that it it 1. has a bar 2. you don't have to order a side of fries or coleslaw because it's all gonna be slathered on your sandwich.  Bleh!  On my first Primanti experience, I ordered a corned beef sandwich as it shoud be, no fries or coleslaw on it.  So I was served 2 slices of bread and about 1.5 slices of corned beef.  What a rip off.  2nd experience, today, equally as awful.  But as i said... waitstaff was great.  I ordered a \""Pitts-burger\"" with coleslaw and fries on the side.  Seriously, the quality of the burger I was served made 7-11 mini mart burgers seem gourmet.  I guess you really see what their overpriced, crappy sandwiches are truly made of when you strip off the fries & coleslaw.  Their fries are also soggy and gross.  Not a whole lot goin' on here except for cutie/attentive waitresses.  \n\nIf you want a decent, GIANT-sized sandwich and a real PGH experience, go to Peppi's.",2
2099,"The legendary Primanti Bros.  I believe I had been to Pittsburgh 10+ times before my first visit.  That being said I'm (a) glad I went (b) ok with it taking that long (c) really enjoyed the roast beef and cheese (d) easily would have paid more than the $7 ticket price (e) definitely need to hit the treadmill tomorrow and (f) thankful to not live next door.\n\nOverall, a good local experience.  No burning desire to hit em up the next time in Pittsburgh, but wouldn't hesitate to recommend.  Great tasting glutinous original sandwiches at decent prices, that's what they are.",3
2100,"Based on what I've read on yelp, I tried the Pastrami.  The cole slaw, fries, meat, and the italian bread all came together in a really HUGE sandwhich that was really good for a few reasons.  Flavor, texture, quantity, and presentation.  Ordered a couple of Yuenglings to wash it all down...not bad.",4
2101,When i told everyone I was going to Pittsburgh - Primanti Bros is one place everyone said I should try.\n\nPrimanti Bros.'s sandwich = meat + cole slaw + french fries\n\nI ordered the pastrami and it was really good! The pastrami was lean and warm. I'm not a big fan of cole slaw but their cole slaw was pretty good. It was more like pickled vegetable; the pieces were big instead of chopped up finely which i liked. The french fries were a bit of a challenge to keep inside though.\n\nI would recommend trying Primanti's if you're in the area!,3
2102,"I understand Primanti is a historic institution here in Pittsburgh but other than the name I don't think it has much going on unless you're in the mood for quantity versus quality. I got reeled into my experience because everyone said to try it when I moved here. Really simple menu as you just choose the meat you'd like in your sandwich. I went with pastrami which was good but the combination of the cole slaw, tomato, french fries and bread was just okay and made it soggy as I finished the second half. The sheer size of it all was just too much too. I wouldn't return again, though if you're visiting and into doing Pittsburgh touristy stuff I would say you would need to experience Primanti to judge for yourself.",2
2103,"I walked in, sat down, and ordered an IC light. Looked around, and realized that this restaurant looks awfully like one of the restaurants I saw on the food network where the guy goes around and eats these ridiculously large meals. After eating a Pittsburgher (the second most popular dish) and trying the colossal fish sandwich, and a capicola sandwich, I've decided that the best part of my meal was the IC light. \n\nMy friend's colossal fish was the best of the three and it's best eaten as two meals. My Pittsburgher was the pitts and I wouldn't order it again. Unlike your pitts on a 90+ degree day, it was really dry. The sandwich was only salvaged by my grotesque use of hot sauce. The concept isn't that ridiculous either. Just get fries and coleslaw and put it in your sandwich. The chili cheese fries were mediocre as well, but the portion again was hugemongous.\n\nI'd come back here if I were in Pittsburgh again because its just a nice place to chill at on Market Square. But the food is only serviceable. Substituting quantity with quality can only get you so far.\n\nThe ambiance, service, atmosphere, and tradition makes this place pretty unique, but it don't make the food taste better.",2
2104,"So after hearing about all the raves and reviews about Primanti Bros, I had to try it for myself. I'm not going to lie, I was a bit disappointed. I think it is more of a novelty thing than anything. I would say yes, you should try it if you happen to come to Pittsburgh, but try not to expect a lot because that might have killed the sandwich for me.\n\nThe sandwich is packed with great meat, but the fries were pretty soggy and coleslaw that day was a bit too much pepper for my liking. I thought the fries might have been soggy because of the coleslaw so I ordered another order of fries (since I'm generally a fries fiend), but even those were soft and not up to par. I was pretty disappointed at that. However, the meat was pretty delicious. I got corned beef and it was delicious slices and it was cooked well.\n\nI would say overall verdict: try the place but try with an open mind.",3
2105,"So had a short stop at pittsburgh before heading out to the airport and decided to go on a food adventure...  After getting lost and going to the closed location, I finally found this one at market square.  I paid for parking and boy was it worth it!\n\nThe classic pastrami is too good! Crisped edges and stacked with vinegary slaw and crisp homey fries!  Lived up to the hype! Trip was worth it.",5
2106,"yikes!! just make sure you don't go there during lunch. it's def a ton of food and sure cause for afternoon food coma. \n\nthe food itself was delish. never really thought of putting everything, including the sides, in a sandwich... but it works. def something to try if/when you're out there.",4
2107,"Maybe the expectations were too high, but I had a pastrami sandwich and I thought it was quite bland. The only flavors were vinegar and pepper. It was better with hot sauce, but I expected better.",2
2108,"Clearly should have read a few reviews before going here. Whenever I go to these types of iconic regional dining establishments, I order the house specialty to best judge the place on its supposed merits. Since it was 11 in the morning, I chose not to order Primanti's #1 best seller, which the waitress told me was beer, but perhaps that would have made my experience better. As it was, I ordered the #2 best seller, the cheese steak. It was heinous. \n\nThink a grimy, mechanically separated Salisbury-style steak with a meager slice of provolone on sliced Italian bread served signature Primanti-style: with coleslaw, tomatoes, and fries.\n\nFirst, the steak was disgusting: terrible flavor (smelled and tasted like hippie armpit, which I'm not necessarily opposed to as long as it's not involved in something I'm trying to eat) with a gross, processed meat texture. Secondly, the fries easily overwhelmed the sandwich, with their old fryer grease taste. Additionally, the sandwich was unwieldy and threatening to fall apart at every turn--a trait I don't hold against decent-tasting sandwiches, but this lack of structural integrity just added insult to injury. \n\nMy dining partners were equally disgusted by their choices: corned beef and ham & cheese sandwiches, respectively. Easily the best part of the meal was the Smallman Street Fries, and those were equally lack-luster. The \""bacon\"" was simply bacon bits (oh, the humanity!), the chili was uninspired, and the cheese sauce and sour cream did little but soggy the fries. (Did I mention they tasted like old fryer grease?)  \n\nI will never go back and I will immediately disregard the culinary opinions of anyone who thinks Primanti Bros. produces decent food.",1
2109,"When there's this much hype about a place, it's hard to live up to, but they did a pretty damn good job. Maybe not the best sandwich I've ever had in my life, but if it was any random sandwich shop I'd happened to stumble into, it would definitely be five stars without a second thought.\n\nThe chili cheese fries were among the best I've ever had. I don't know what they do to them - it's not the chili that's particularly great, it's not the cheese that's particularly great, and it's not the fries that are particularly great. But somehow, putting them all together just turns it into unbeatable awesome.\n\nThe sandwich itself (I got the corned beef) was very good despite the fact that I hate coleslaw. But they don't mean the typical mayo-and-carrot-and-purple-onion coleslaw; they make it with vinegar and oil, so it's basically just like seasoned lettuce. They put a bit much of it on, which overwhelmed the rest of the ingredients at first, but just pull about half of the slaw off and you have a kick-ass sandwich. The hot sauce goes really well on it too. And for a pretty reasonable price, I might add. Normally, I'd expect it to be about twice as much with that kind of reputation and downtown location.",5
2110,"I heard from everyone that the Primanti sandwiches are the quintessential Pittsburgh food. \n\nWe scored a nice seat outside and indulged in some Iron Hill beer that was on special for $2 for a  20 oz beer. The sandwiches were fine and were inexpensive.\n\nBe warned that everything here comes with french fries, even the salads.",2
2111,"Wildly overrated.  I compare it to Pat's and Geno's in Philly, good when your drunk, but only when your drunk.\n\nI went to Pitt for 4 years and I have to say I never understood the Primantis hype.  I dont know how you get famous for putting fries on a sandwich when the fries suck.  They are soggy and tasteless, maybe the worst I've ever had.  I will say the coleslaw is pretty good, and I'm not usually a coleslaw guy, but it doesnt make up for all the other shortcomings.  \n\nHalf the sandwich falls out while your eating.  The \""cheesesteak\"" might be the most tasteless sandwich ever.  You have to use a whole bottle of hot sauce just to get a little flavor.  \n\nPrimantis sucks...go to Fatheads on the Southside or Uncle Sam's in Oakland.",1
2112,"Why waste time? Want a sandwich, fries and slaw? Put it all in one, this is what Primati Bro's  does. \n\nEvery sandwich here is huge, not really due to the protein, but due to the handful(s) of fried and slaw and the thick bread each one is built with. I opted for the Colossal fish and cheese sandwich (6.99).  The fish had a nice crisp batter, the fires were a bit soggy , the bread was nice and soft and the slaw was decent.  Alone I loved the fish, All together the starch of the bread and fried over power the fish. There was hot sauce at the table to help add flavor (frank's red hot style). \n\nSeating is odd, seat your self and you will get service when you are noticed. Drink come in to go cups and the menu is on paper for you to keep as notice to you doctor of your  1000+ calorie meal. \n\nMy coworker also got the cheese fires for extra cholesterol and to max his per diem. Cheese wiz smothered soggish fries. It was decent but it did not blow me away by any means.\n\nBottom line, if you are a tourist, give it a try, if you are a local come for the nostalgic name.",3
2113,"I realize it's a sandwich shop and I dared to order a salad - but their menu is limited - so why put something on it if you're not going to do it right? Ordered a grilled chicken salad, take out. Got back to the hotel and found it had a pile of tasteless, cold french fries on it...so cold they never melted the shredded orange cheese-food underneath them. Also no salt or ketchup was included, so even if I DID want to eat stone cold, unseasoned fries, they would suck. The balsamic dressing I ordered was replaced by (fake) raspberry vinaigrette, so repulsive it required a trip all the way back  to the restaurant to get the correct dressing, which they were out of. Would have been nice to have been asked, since they did have Italian on hand - seems like a closer match. The iceberg lettuce, olive, and tomato salad, oh yeah, it did have a bit of chicken on it too, was okay once I scraped all that orange congealed \""cheese\"" off.  That and all the smokers hanging around the place (and Pittsburgh in general), I would say this place is a totally over-rated dump.",1
2114,Really bad service. Make sure to get in the face of the wait staff or count on being ignored,1
2115,"I guess you have to try this out if your not from Pittsburgh!\n\nI had the sweet sausage, Hubs had hot sausage, my oldest had ham and my youngest ordered chicken fingers.  The chilli was good, but the bread it came w/ was stale.  They put cole slaw and french fries on the sandwiches.  I thought that it just made the sandwiches bland and starchy.  But not bad...just blah.  The bread was nice and soft and they have several different kinds.  \nI am not a beer drinker, but they looked like pretty good prices.  The place was very crowded and you seat yourself.  We lucked up on an empty table, although it was by the door.  The place looks much bigger on the outside.",3
2116,"Primanti Bros sells sandwiches. Only, calling these sandwiches doesn't really do them justice. And I think there may have been salads and some other stuf fon the menu... but really, it's all about the almost famous sandwiches!!\n\nThe sandwiches come with fries and coleslaw (vinegar based not mayo based!!). No, not on the side, but on the sandwich. And as weird as it may sounds, it tastes really good that way! \n\nI didn't get anything to wild, just a turkey sandwich. The bread was fantastic, soft but still sturdy, and there was plenty of turkey. The fries could have been crispier, but they weren't limp and soggy so I can't complain too much there! My husband had a bowl of soup in addition to his sandwich and I stole a taste... Very flavorful! \n\nService is where a star is lost... We had to flag someone down to get my water refilled and my mother-in-law had to ask for tartar sauce for her fish sandwich twice. Our waiter was friendly and took decent care of us other then those 2 minor hiccups. \n\nI can definitely see why these sandwiches have the following that they do. I can see myself going back next time my travels take me to Pittsburgh.",4
2117,"Mmmmmm, so much deliciousness. Cole slaw and fries on top of food that will elicit a chorus \u00e0 la Handel's Messiah from any drunkard worth her salt. \n\nGlasses of beer that won't stop urging you to take a gander at their naked bottoms.  \n\nAll the goodness of tasty food that compels writers to make exclusive use of fragmented sentences.\n\nI wanted to have an orgy with all the Primanti Brothers as a token of my gratitude, but since I almost fainted due to claustrophobia in the narrow stairwell on my way to the pissah, I suppose a thank you will just need to suffice.",4
2118,"Primanti's is a Pittsburgh institution.  The original is in the strip district just outside of downtown proper.  They are famous for large sandwiches with the fries IN the sandwich, not on the side.  Idea was born out of truckers wanting a meal they could eat on the road.  Yes, if you are in PIT you should probably go once just to say you've been there.  That being said, I have been a number of times and tried a number of different sandwiches and to be honest they all were fairly bland.  Lack of flavor really hurts them in my opinion.",2
2119,"Never heard of this place. Only heard/went there because my dad wanted to.\n\nGreat atmosphere. Server was very good. Overall great service. Beer selection was OK. Low price for lots of food.\n\nHad the cheesesteak. It was ok. Nothing special. Like most \""fat sandwiches,\"" when you add French Fries to a sandwich, they leave it with little flavor.",3
2120,"Ok, ok, ok, y'all need to calm down.  Quit with the 'it's too small,' 'it's a Pittsburgh thing,' and 'it's so greasy' statements.  That's what Primanti's IS.  It's a compact, greasy Pittsburgh right.  \n\nYes, the place is small, it is in Market Square, and will remain there, wouldn't you be disappointed if one day you wanted Primanti's and no more Market Square location?  I know I would.  If I were in the downtown region and had that craving I wouldn't want to have to work my way up to the Strip just for a bite of that Pittsburgh goodness.  \n\nThe 'it's a Pittsburgh' thing comments baffle me.  If you have food shows featuring the sandwich, magazines writing about it, and it's considered the 'Manliest Restaurant in America,'  I think that means it's more than just a Pittsburgh thing.  Why else would Primanti's be featured on such media?  Why else would these people centered around shows and magazines venture to a Primanti's?  I mean that has to show you it's more than just a Pittsburgh thing.\n\nAnd 'it's so greasy?'  Did you not watch them makes your sandwich, which you picked from their extensive menu, on the griddle in front of you?  Expect it to be greasy, they are frying it for you and melting that cheese on it.  Maybe don't even pay attention to the greasy factor, especially with that crunchy coleslaw and heap of fries placed between those two thick slices of Italian bread.  \n\nBetter yet, move out of my way, I'm about to chow down on that Pittsburgh grease fest awaiting my attention.",5
2121,"I love the concept but I think it is overrated.  I have been hearing so much hype about Primanti Brothers that I was so excited to finally get to stop in at one.  I have no problem with the size or amount of grease, I just don't get the greatness of the sandwiches.\n\nWe ordered the Kolbassi & Cheese and the Pitts-burger cheesesteak (#2 best seller).  I had half of each one along with cheese fries.  I thought both sandwiches were a little dry especially the cheesesteak.  The coleslaw seemed to be too dry for my taste or maybe it was the abundance of fries that dried everything out for me.  I am not a big fry fan in the first place.  I would like to see some other options for bread like a wheat or whole grain option.  I would also recommend putting extra cheese on the sandwich as I couldn't even taste cheese.  I like cheese and they need more to help balance the dryness.\n\nService was a little lame as I barely could understand our \""too cool\"" server.  He seemed disinterested in us for the most part.  The pregnant waitress who helped us out once seemed more congenial and helpful.  I like the fact that it is small and fast.  I just don't get the vast appeal.  I need sauces, fresh ingredients, whole grains, and cheese.  I would recommend for everyone to try the place once but I bet there is better options in the Burg.",3
2122,"I thought it was solid.  I got the Pittsburgher with an Iron City.  I had to experience Primanti and I enjoyed it.  \nService was good on a Friday afternoon, Beer was cold on a hot day and my sandwich was satisfying.  What more could you really ask for from a sandwich joint?",3
2123,"Fries were kind of bland and the coleslaw was just ok but the meat was very good. Overall, it's a tasty place with good prices",4
2124,"Primanti Brothers is definitely a Pittsburgh institution. If you are traveling through, you definitely have stop here, at least for the novelty factor. Overall, food is good for a... well, for a sandwich shop... But in the end, I didn't leave with a sense that I really had to come back. \n\nThe real novelty at Primanti Brothers is that all of there sandwiches include french fries and cole slaw inside that sandwich. And to that I say... \""who cares\"".  I personally didn't care for the fries and slaw inside my sandwich, but I am also not a huge french fry or cole slaw fan. (I like the good ones, but I can easily pass on average,) I will say that their cole slaw, which was vinegar rather than mayonnaise based, was quite good. And there fries were above average, but not as good as somewhere like say, Five Guys. \n\nThe ingredients in the sandwich were all pretty good. I had the Pastrami and my friend had the Angus steak. The bread, meat, cheese, etc., were all good quality and were distinct when tasted individually. The sandwiches also seemed to work OK as a package, but for some reason for me--aside from the novelty factor--they didn't stand out. I think that maybe with the fries and slaw in there, there is just too much going on and those two tend to dominate the whole sandwich. It really takes over and you hardly taste the quality of the other ingredients. \n\nOn the plus side, the sandwiches average about $7 each, and for that price, your get a pretty decent sandwich. In the end, Primanti Brothers is a definite must try if you are passing through, but I don't see myself craving these babies any time soon.",2
2125,"This place isn't for a light lunch. Their famous sandwiches include a variety of grilled meats (the cheese steak its second-best seller) with french fries, cole slaw, and tomatoes all squeezed between two soft slices of freshly-cut Italian bread. Rather than cool, mayo-based slaw, an Italian oil-based slaw is used that adds a spicy zing to the sandwich. It's a great meal on the go for game day, or you can watch it on one of the TVs surrounding the bar. It's a greasy handful, but you don't go to Primanti's to be healthy. You go to be full.",3
2126,"Fries and cole slaw in the sandwich was interesting...pretty good. Don't come here if you don't like messy food. My sandwich kind of fell apart.

As a born and bred Pittsburgher, I am committing blasphemy by admitting I don't like Primantis.  I don't like their sandwiches, I don't like their nachos, I don't like their soups, salads, wings or fries.  I find the whole idea of a sandwich containing 3,000 calories worth of Italian bread, cole slaw, meat, and fries just too over the top.  The fries are a soggy mess, the slaw has too much vinegar, the meats are cheap, and the bread is...well the bread is actually ok.\n\nI know it's a Pittsburgh institution and it even served a very pragmatic purpose back in the day, but now it's just kitsch that gets the city featured on Food Network on occasion.  I've eaten there numerous times and have done my Pittsburgh duty of taking all out of towners to the (in)famous Primanti's, but always with the caveat that, \""It's not that good.\"" and usually an apology afterward.\n\nSo there you have it.  I do feel like a giant weight has been lifted off of my shoulders.  I no longer have to carry around my terrible, terrible secret.",2
2133,"I was very excited to go here because of all the buzz about this place.  To be honest this place was not that good at all.  The sandwiches, although unique, were not that good.

2134,"So this is a Pittsburgh instiitution??  Am so underwhelmed.  After waiting more than 20 minutes for our sandwiches (in the end these are still just sandwiches), they came out cold - and I'm not just talking about the meat, lettuce, tomatoes - everything was cold including the fries.  What a disappointment.  Head to DiBellas - much better service, subs and sandwiches.",1
2135,I hit the Primanti Brothers Market Square location to see if the sandwich lives up to the legend and it does. The shop offers a wide array of versions from beef to fish but the grilled steak has rich flavor that is nicely cut by the slightly vinegary Cole slaw. The addition of the fries and Cole slaw on top of the sandwich will make any of the offerings at Primanti a delicious and unique flavor of Pittsburgh.,3
2136,"Underwhelming is one word that comes to mind. The meat tasted cheap, the fries were soggy and the sandwich as a whole was pretty tasteless.\nMaybe my expectations were just too high, I don't know. I went bc I had to, but I definitely will skip next time I'm in town.",2

I attribute this to the mostly male staff here vs. female in the Strip District since they seem to make most of their sandwiches based on \""handfuls.\""\n\nI also enjoy the atmosphere at this location best. Yes, it's still a bit divey, but it's less diner and more bar than the Strip District Primanti. Overall, I recommend this restaurant as a great, inexpensive place to grab a sandwich and beer in Market Square.",4
2142,"I think I made the mistake of coming here sober. Primanti's is great if you've had a few. Oddly, this location closes at midnight so it's late night food without late night hours.\n\nThis location is much smaller than the others. There's no good way to get a group of 8+ people together here.\n\nIt's downtown near offices but doesn't seem to suit the after-work get together well. The food is still a decent value but that's about all it has going for it.",3
2143,Definitely a fan of all their sandwiches. Worth the drive from anywhere. And if you're a local and have never eaten here you don't know what you're missing. Definitely a lot of sandwich for the $.  A legendary Pittsburgh establishment through and through.,4
2144,"I loved my Pgh-style sandwich with cole slaw and fries in it. Wish I could have my sandwich like that everyday! The quality of the bread, and everything in general, was excellent. I would give this place 5 stars instead of 4, but the server was a little out-of-it and didn't get our order right in a couple ways.",4
2145,"I was visiting Pittsburgh recently a was told by more than one person that I have to visit Primanti Bros.  We originally planned on the Cherry Way location but were in Market Square and we were starving. \n\nWe walked in and it was pretty busy.  We waited a few minutes for an empty table and found one.  We cleaned if off ourselves and that was okay with me.  I was pretty excited about this place because of the reviews and other personal recommendations.  \n\nI ordered a ham and cheese sandwich and my partner ordered one with more than one type of lunch meat.  The sandwiches were simply sandwiches with coleslaw and French fries on top.  There was nothing special about it and it's something easily made at home.  The price was good.  For a beer, coke, and two sandwiches we got of there for under $20.  \n\nThe condition of the women's restroom was horrible.  It ruined my appetite.  You'd think with such a reputation that that condition of the restroom would be a bit nicer.  The restaurant itself was in crappy shape as well.  I expect dive bars to look like this.  \n\nNext time I'm in Pittsburgh, I won't be coming back to a Primanti Bros.  There's surely better food out there and a better dining environment.",3
2146,Good beer and food was really good but the service was mediocre at best. But I love that I can here the game and not random music by Rihanna,4
2147,"This place is basically \""the place\"" you hear about when you say you are going to Pittsburgh. And I am glad I tried it. I can see it being bringing back memories of college days to any alumni.\n\n+friendly service. It was day 2 of our cashier/ waitress and I thought she was pretty amazing. \n+fries are delicious in general, and this place is no exception. \n+cheap. 6 bucks for a sandwich or burger. You're not in San Francisco anymore. \n+coke products and not pepsi. Win. \n\n-I just don't eat this type of food if I can help it. White bread, well done cheap meat. \n-Fried everything. \n\nSo, if you would like a burger with fries, on white bread and are not looking to see a green thing in sight, this is the perfect place and you won't be disappointed. If you are a college student, you should eat here at least 1X per month, if not more.",3
2148,"Well, it finally happened: I had to give a place a single star. And it kills me that the place I gave it to had to be Primanti's. I'm an awful Pittsburgher.\n\nI don't give low ratings easily or often, so believe me: this place pushed all of my buttons to earn this awful review. In fact, the single star was only earned because the place is cleaner and more comfy than some of the other Primanti places I've been too. It kind of has an old diner feeling to it and I liked that. \n\nAlas, that's all I liked.\n\nSo, why such a low score? Well:\n\nThe service was terrible. After spending twenty minutes sitting without anyone coming to refill my water or ask for my actual order - note, the place was almost completely empty - I went to the register to ask for something to eat, which I'd started to think I had to do after watching a couple people do the same (in hindsight, I probably misinterpreted their actions, but my mistake does not excuse what happened next). My waiter looked at me and went, \""Don't you get the concept of a restaurant? Haven't you been to any restaurants, like, ever? Sit back down and I'll take your order.\"" \n\nAnd not even in a joking manner that made me feel like I could smile about my mistake - this guy was being a condescending, rude, arrogant person. It was unbelievable. Utterly, totally unbelievable. If I hadn't met company there that night, I would have walked out right then.\n\nTo make matters worse, this was not a good night to order anything at Primanti's. The coleslaw was way too sweet and there was far too much of it, the fries were bland and had no texture at all, and there was barely any meat on my sandwich at all. The result? A big pile of carbs that really didn't taste great after the first few bites, rather than a delicious sandwich.\n\nBefore you all kill me, please note: I LIKED my meal at Mt. Lebanon's Primanti location. They also have a more diverse menu, which is always a bonus for me - I like having more options. I think in the future, I will stick to that location in this local chain, where even on a busy night I managed to get food in a decent amount of time. I certainly will not be coming to the downtown location if I spot my previous, downright awful waiter working there again.",1
2149,I heard good things..after all Primanti Brothers have developed a nice chain in the area.\n\nGreat service very helpful...I had the guys pick the sandwich for me.  I got There best selling burger....it was a hamburger with fries in it.   Not a fan of the idea.  Overall kinda boring(Sorry) but it is what it is.  The meat tasted like meat which was a nice change but the toppings were just down right sad.  Fries where a  step up from the norm and for a price of under 7 bucks it sure beats any fast food chain.,3
2150,"How are there only 5 reviews?  As I understand it, it's a Pittsburgh institution, and who doesn't love french fries on top of a huge sandwich?\nThis particular location, right on Market Square, has great, picturesque dining (though the seat yourself policy is a little difficult, as it's hard to tell who's been waiting for a table and encourages you to hover over other diners to snag an elusive seat on a weekend night).  I loved my bologna sandwich, you can't beat the prices for a place that's loved by locals and demanded by tourists, and I'd be sure to stop back (at any location) when I'm back in the Steel City.",4
2151,"Good sandwiches as you expect, but a bit of a touristic atmosphere.  I'm a stickler for the original in the strip!",4
2152,"We did the obligatory Primanti Bros stop on our recent first visit to Pittsburgh. We can understand how it's a novelty to have fries on everything. But if they're not seasoned well and crisp...what's the point? When a place gets talked up so much, you can't help but have big expectations. We were disappointed...\n\nHere's the thing, when you sit down at a restaurant and the table is filthy, the menus have food all over them, and they bring your drinks in Solo cups...Without a doubt, if I were still in college and needed to nurse a hangover, this would probably be a go-to place. \n\nMy husband ordered the Italian Sausage, which was obscenely big, with good flavor, but again the fries were mush and flavorless. Luckily, we had ordered an additional side of slaw, because that's truly what made the sandwich, which was very tasty. We also ordered the \""vegetarian\"" soup which was good, but I ordered a chix salad because a MASSIVE sandwich with fries and slaw on it was just not calling me. Little did I know, the gimmick of fries on everything meant fries on everything....including my salad. It was really gross to have these tasteless grease piles on my salad which I couldn't even eat. Although we were dining there, the salad came in a plastic to-go box and pre-packaged dressing in a packet. The chicken was like tasteless rubber. \n\nWe checked of the \""Primanti Bros\"" box, but won't be back.",2
2153,I have eaten better sandwiches but stopping for lunch at Primanti Bros was an overall great experience. I sat inside at the bar where I was afforded a bird's eye view of the grill. You should expect to eat a sandwich with a handful of french fries and a handful of cole slaw smashed on top of whatever meat/cheese combination you may have ordered. I would definitely recommend sitting at the bar to take in the full experience.,3
2154,"Can't go to Pittsburgh and not try one of their sandwiches! A bit overrated in my option though... Sandwiches are huge, but the fries they stuff the sandwiches with are very dry and soggy, and not crispy at all! This is definitely one of those restaurants you go to, just to say you have!",3
2155,"I can't for the life of me figure out why all the hype. I was warned by others that this is mainly where tourists eat. But I'm a tourist here, and wanted to try it.\n\nIt was a sandwich mostly of slaw and fries.  \n\nThe thick white bread was dry and boring; too crusty. \n\nThe fries on the sandwich overpowered the taste! So I dismantled it. When the rude server asked how I liked it, I was honest. He gave me big time attitude and commented that I took it apart. I told him, I took it apart because it was a horrible sandwich (the pastrami, by the way). And that, sir, is why you got a $0.35 tip! (never give a zero tip, they'll think you forgot, always leave just a small amount of change)\n\nIf you have to put all that hot sauce on the sandwich to make it palatable, why bother?  (The server, as he walked away, told me it's really good with hot sauce, which was just Tabasco, which I don't like, any way!)\n\nThey left off the tomato that supposedly comes with each sandwich!\n\nOf the 4 staff members I came in contact with, all but 1 were rude, unfriendly and uncaring. One constantly walked by trash that had blown off outdoor tables without picking it up.\n\nThe fries were good. \n\nNope, won't be back.",1
2156,"Disappointed, big time.\n\nLocal info lauds this place as an institution.\n\nI say: pass.  The sandwich was soggy, bland, and just all-around not good.\n\nI didn't get sick from it, so that's a bonus.  \n\nChoose wisely.  Go to Meat & Potatoes instead, and order a sandwich there.",2
2157,"My sister-in-law, husband, and I visited this Primanti Bros from all the hype we'd been hearing about it. I have to say its overrated. I wasn't impressed with my sandwich at all. I ordered the chicken breast, my hubby got the fish, and my SIL got the steak. It had thick white bread, an overload of cole slaw, and fries. I don't think the \""meat\"" you order makes a difference in the bland taste, as it's overpowered by the slaw and fries. The bread was dry on the crust and yet soggy from the slaw/oil from fries. The wait staff wasn't friendly either. They seemed to have the \""I don't need try to so hard because we're busy no matter what\"" attitude. We had to go up to the bar to get refills on our drinks after waiting over 10 min. for the waitress to notice we were out. The place was constantly busy due to the full bar and nostalgic feel of the restaurant; it had it's own local charm. I'm glad to say I tried it, however I probably wouldn't go back on our next visit.",2
2158,Nice menu and good service \nI recommend,4
2159,"I was first excited that it's one of those places they review on the Food Network where they make specialty sandwiches, NYC style.\nIn reality, their food is not that great. Yes, the sandwiches are huge, come with fries inside, and a ton of meat, etc. But I've definitely had better.\nI was disappointed that the salads are premade; the ones you'd buy at a super market or gas station. I mean it is a casual place, but I was at least expecting a fresh salad.\nIn short, if you're on Market Square and are hungry for inexpensive (considering some of the other options there) and mediocare quick meal, you should give it a try.",3
2160,"I've heard all the hype and wanted to try it.  Tonight was my second attempt here.   First time, new girl on the grill apologized to me at 10 minutes, at 15 I walked.  Not even an acknowledgement from the wait staff.   Tonight, the waiter seemed mad that I didn't know what I wanted to order.  After I explained that I'd never been there, he brought me a menu and then proceeded to ignore me for 10 minutes.  I walked again.  No more tries here.  Maybe I'm doing something wrong?  Haha.",1
2161,"This joint makes excellent sandwiches. \n\nI ordered the fish sandwich and it was delicious! First off, its huge, and cheap. They stuff the sandwiches with cole slaw and fries (yummy). \n\nYou really can't go wrong here. \n\nThe place is usually packed to the brim, so you need to get in early before it gets full, which it will. Once it gets busy, the service gets worse. \n\nIf you're in the area, its definitely worth a try.",4
2162,"Had lunch here while visiting friends in the area .... After seeing all the hype about this place on various tv food shows I was very excited to eat hear . WOW ,,, what a dissapointment , This place is so over hyped it isnt funny . To compare this place to the famous sandwich places is NYC is a joke . The sandwiches may be big , but only because they are over stuffed with fries and cole slaw . To steal a line from a old TV commercial .... WERE'S THE BEEF .....  A major major dissapointment .",1
2163,"If you like sandwiches with french fries piled on them, go for it.   But no good sandwich needs nonsense like that.  These are not very good sandwiches to begin with and adding soggy fries doesn't help.  Not to mention the bread is not fresh and is just a thick, bland wonder-bready thing.  \n\nI appreciate that they're not aiming at  customers like me.  Big sloppy sandwiches are fun for a lot of people so I hate to be a party pooper, but I don't think the quality is there.",2
2164,"I was really looking forward to a huge tasty sandwich but was greatly disappointed! Everything was bland, nothing had seasoning, not even basic salt. Soggy fries, tasteless meat, average coleslaw on white bread trying to double for Italian bread. Save your time, money and calories and go to Wendy's instead.",1
2165,"Super slow service. They have inside and outside seating which is nice. However, they only have two waitresses outside for about 20 tables. They don't take your entire order they only take your drink order and then your good order. It took 10 minutes to get our drink order. After finally getting our drinks she waited another ten minutes to come get our food. When we ordered our food when I asked for light coleslaw she said they can't do that and for me to just take it off. She explained that they just put fistfuls on it. So why can't they just put less fistfuls on it? \n\n\nOur waitress was very rude and didn't make me feel welcomed at all. She never introduced herself and just treated us like animals. \n\nI would never tell anybody to go to the Primanti Brothers again downtown. The one in Oakland is so much nicer and better quality. \n\nIt's really bad management to have only two people serving outside when there are over 20 tables. It's not fair for the customers or for the servers. \n\nWhile the food was good as always it wasn't worth the wait because it just took to long. The service wasn't nice at all and I wouldn't tell anybody to come here when it's crowded.",1
2166,"This place holds a nostalgic appeal for people born and raised in Pittsburgh who grew up eating here. If that experience is what your looking for, please visit. If you're looking for a tasty meal, go somewhere else. 5 stars for history, 0 for food quality and flavor.",2
2167,I like sandwich and stuff as much as anyone else. this place was pretty good. The prices were good also. the staff was good. Everything worked out the way it should. There were no negative surprise. No poistive surprises either. It was a nice resturant.,3
2168,"Returned to Pittsburgh, Ate at Primanti a 2nd time:\n\nI stand by my decision: Pass.",2
2169,"Got a sandwich to go so I can't give a full review but when I ate it, the fries were soggy and SOO greasy.  I had the bag in my purse and the grease leaked through and eventually broke the bag.  Really want to eat in there next time since everyones sandwiches looked yummy.\n\nTheir vegetable soup was great!  The people who work there are the best.  Amazing service.",3
2170,"I heard this place stacks fries and cole slaw onto your sandwich so I gotta try it. I ordered the drunk duck drink and it was fantastic. I got to keep the little rubber ducky on top of my drink too :)  As for the sandwich, I got the deluxe double egg and cheese.  The portion was HUGE and very messy!  More messy than boogers coming out from a runny nose.  The sandwich I got was really good and filling.  I would recommend this place for visitors from afar and who happens to be in the neighborhood.",4
2171,"I had lived outside of Pittsburgh for a couple of years and have eaten at this Primanti Brothers location four or five times. Their sandwiches were always tasty, worth the wait and the trouble of finding parking etc. So, when my parents came to visit, and we made a trip out that-a-way, I knew that would be a lunch stop. We ended up coming into Pittsburgh on Sunday around 1pm. I knew it would be crowded and anticipated having a wait. We got a table after 15 to 20 minutes and quickly sat down before someone else did. It took the waitress about 10 minutes to come and clear the previous customers remnants, which was ok. \n\nWe ordered our beers and were told that she'd come back and take our order. She came back 20 minutes later, with the beers and took our order. After that, we sat around and waited for our sandwiches for 35 minutes. When we did finally get our food, it was ice cold. The fries in the sandwich were completely soggy and cold, and the meat was barely warm. Our table ran out of napkins, and we asked for some, but they never came, finally, the table next to ours handed us a few. Maybe it was because it was cold, but the sandwiches weren't that great. I had very little meat in mine, and more coleslaw that anything else. Also, the thickness of the bread seems to have increased since I last ate here because about 60% of my sandwich was bread. We were fairly disgruntled about the whole thing, but were still going to leave a tip for the waitress. \n\nThen, my dad went to the bar to pay. He stood there for 10 minutes, behind another customer. The server came up to them and said 'what the hell are you doing up here?', in those words!! My dad was so stunned be just stood there, the guy in line ahead of him told her that he was waiting to pay his bill, so she cashed him out and then turned around to do something else, when my dad said 'excuse me, i need to pay too', she replied to him ' Jeez, you guys are so demanding! Why the hell are you in such a hurry\"". That is when their tip went straight out the door with us. \n\nWe were ok waiting for a table, we were even ok waiting for our food; it took them one hour from the time we sat down, to the time we got our food, and then the server had the audacity to behave in that manner. Either Primanti Brothers has become too big for their boots and let things slide, or they need to train their staff to be more polite and efficient. We will definitely not be coming back the next time we are in town. Our money is better spent else where.",1
2172,"Had such high hopes for this place on our visit to Pittsburgh.  The presentation of the sandwiches were making my mouth water, there's a lot of good things going on in the ingredients...In theory, this should've resulted in a bold flavor taste explosion, but I found myself severely let down by all of the bland ingredients piled high in front of me.  The pastrami was terrible, the coleslaw weak, and the fries were bland, dry, and flavorless.  Still bummed, my guess is that this place I more of a tourist draw now than a legit sandwich shop.",2
2173,"Visiting Pittsburgh from out of town, so naturally I asked my hosts to take me to Primanti's (and they were happy to oblige).  We went to the one at \""PPG.\"" The place was busy but not crowded on a Friday night.  The menu was on the wall along with murals of Pittsburgh's finest sports starts.\n\nOur server was quick and efficient and we never were in need of refills or anything else.\n\nI got the Pitts-burgher cheese steak and we tried an order of the Smallman Street Fries.  The fries were truly loaded.  The chili had a nice kick to it and there was literally an ice cream scoop of sour cream on top.  However, the fries were actually seasoned that well and were under done in my opinion.  That didn't bode well for the fries on the sandwich, but I kept my hopes high.\n\nThe sandwich comes out and its a monster.  I love the italian bread, the beef patty and cheese, the slaw was good (shredded cabbage, not like southern cole slaw).  Everything was fresh but, again, the fries were the worst part.  Underdone, underseasoned.  Definitely my least favorite part.\n\nNonetheless, I would definitely return because I want to try some of the other menu items.  I've heard double-meat is the way to go.  I'm intrigued.",3
2174,"Primanti Bros is the dirty guilty pleasure that I give into once a year.\n\nMost times, when out of towners ask for a local spot to eat, I'm one of the few that actually pushes them AWAY from this defacto Burgh tradition.  Don't get me wrong, Primanti's isn't bad, but it isn't exactly great either.  Typically I end up smothering mine in hot sauce and salt/pepper to get some flavor onto otherwise bland sandwiches.\n\nWith that said, every once in awhile, I get this odd, insatiable craving for a cap and egg sandwich (w/ onion)... and when I do cave to that temptation, it's oddly satisfying.\n\nOn the experience front, Primanti's is definitely one of a kind.  I don't know of anywhere else you can get burly bartenders to slam down a mess of a sandwich in wax paper on your table (something the suburban restaurants fail to provide).  If you're going to go, I highly suggest going either to the original in the Strip, or, if you don't feel like waiting in line during the busy times, the Market Square location.",3
2175,Worst service ever.  The waitress and I use that term loosely rolled her eyes at any question when ordering and yelled at someone at the table for asking for coleslaw on the side.  Then she had to come back and re ask the orders again and got mad when we repeated about the coleslaw since she didn't repeat it back.  When she brought out the food she just slammed the food down and just shouted out the name of one of the sandwiches um are you asking who had which sandwich which is your job to remember anyways.  I'm glad I don't live in Pittsburgh to have to worry about avoiding this place.,1
2176,"My partner wanted to try a Pittsburgh cheesesteak sandwich and we read this was the best place to go. I don't like fries and I don't eat cheese, but I still loved my sandwich! I ordered the chicken sans cheese and fries, of course. The cole slaw was very good; I loved that it didn't have mayo in it and the flavor was great. Our waitress recommended that we try their hot sauce on the sandwiches and so glad we did because it really spiced it up and made the sandwich even better. My partner ordered the real deal and said it was delicious as well! We also ordered a \""small\"" beer, which is a full 12 oz glass, pretty sweet deal. \n\nHighly recommend this place",4
2177,"Can I give this place ZERO stars? They're supposively \""famous\"" for their sandwiches so some friends and I go when we are in town. The waitresses all rolled their eyes and glared at me for not wanting my fries on top of my sandwich. (Not to mention the waitress was in the skimpiest tank top with her bra hanging out while waiting on us and grilling food. Gross.) I get that your famous for having fries on the sandwich but regardless, a customer should be able to get what they want. This place was trashy, dirty and probably not even up to code.",1
2178,"This is the most overrated place bragged about in Pittsburgh. My first visit was to the one in South Hills. Waited 90 mins for 4 sandwiches. The coleslaw is gross and I'm a fan of coleslaw. Due to the 90 min wait I was given a gift card which I used at the one in Market Square. This time I got the grilled chicken salad. If you like chewing on rubber bands, I recommend it. It was the absolute worst salad I've ever had, how can you screw up a salad? The chicken was tasteless and rubbery. Got it to go and the girl who took the order over the phone was rude and rushed and was equally rude when I picked it up. She assumed she knew my name and my order and handed me a random bag of food. I told her I was missing a sandwich and she tossed another bag at me without saying a word. I will NEVER go back to any of these locations. I'd rather eat a ham sandwich from Sheetz. At least I can get that without an attitude. If you have friends coming to visit from out of town, take them anywhere but here. And for those who say you have to go to the original one in the Strip, no thanks, it's the same food. If you are looking for an awesome sandwich go to Schmitz Old World Deli in Greenfield.",1
2179,"I ordered a fave of diners, the Pittsburger. cheesesteak.  It's a burger with cheese coleslaw, French fries  all piled between 2 thick pieces of bread. Looked ok.  It, however, didn't work for me. \nThe coleslaw was great though!!\nIt's not much of a cheesesteak. It's a weird burger. That burger seemed like a fried frozen burger. Not much cheese either. \nMy crew had the kielbasa sandwich and the ham sandwich respectively. They looked great. \nI don't think fries on my sandwich works for me either. I can't hold it against them though. \nI chose poorly. I think they are probably good though. \nMy motto: eat food you recognize.",2
2180,"My brother mentioned that he'd heard about this place in Pittsburgh that puts coleslaw and fries on their sandwiches. Sounded good and I was in town so I thought I'd give it a shot! I went around 4 pm on a Saturday and it was pretty busy! Usually a good sign. There were only about 3 people in front of me in the takeout line, so it shouldn't have taken long for me to place an order, right? Wrong. It took maybe 15-20 minutes for those 3 orders to be taken because nobody would commit themselves to working the register. While waiting in line, I got to see all these mouthwatering sandwiches being made. Once I placed my order, it didn't take long to come out...\n\nSo I got a Pittsburgh cheese steak, their #2 most popular item (don't ask what their #1 is...the guy will roll his eyes and unenthusiastically say, \""beer.\"") Long story short, what I ended up with was a bland, lukewarm beef party with bland soggy fries on top. The cold lettuce and tomato cooled the sandwich even more. I enjoyed the coleslaw on top, which is pretty much all I ended up eating from the sandwich. And a few limp fries. Disappointing.",3
2181,"Had to try this while in Pittsburgh. Ate the first half of my sandwich with the slaw & the fries but by the time I got to the second half I took the fries off because they were cold. I had the pastrami & asked for extra cheese. Didn't get the extra cheese. Feel like the sandwiches are missing something. Might be good with a thousand island dressing or \""secret sauce\"". \n\nUnderwhelmed but still recommend trying it at least once for the experience.\n\nMarket square location was confusing because seat yourself but wasn't clear.",3
2182,"Primanti bros has the best corned beef sandwich in the east, and the coleslaw, fries and tomato right on the sandwich made it totally unique. Oh and they also have a great craft beer selection.",5
2183,"My Order: Pitts-Burger (ok) & Raspberry Lemon Tea (not bad; sweet) \n\nPros: \n- notably, PB was called \""the place\"" to go to in Pittsburg\n- they put fries & coleslaw into their burgers (novelty idea) due to the history of Pittsburgh (and the working class men) \n- customize-able: you can put eggs, extra meat, etc. in your sandwich\n- I sat on the second floor and was able to overlook the first floor & the open-designed kitchen (which was pretty neat) \n\nCons:\n- to be honest, I didn't think it was anything special. Just fries & coleslaw added into the burger as opposed to being a side\n- no parking... \n\nNonetheless, it's something worth trying if you're new to Pittsburgh. But would I go back? Probably not.",3
2184,"Alright so being from Texas I'm used to lots of seasoning, lots of flavor, and lots of heat if things are supposed to be spicy.  This sandwich shop lacks all of those things.  This was my first shot at local food (I think it's local, that's what I was told), and definitely nothing to write home about.  They did have some decent draft beer options but no one in my group of 10 said they would come back.  Try another \""local\"" joint if you have an option.",2
2185,Highly disappointing. While sandwich is unique it was totally over cooked and under seasoned. No flavor,2
2186,"So an honest review.  Bland.  Service good prices cheap but food very bland and pre made.  I ordered the new black bean burger sandwich.  Bread not toasted, burger tasted a lot like my morning star black bean burger that I get frozen.  Cole sale was a lot better with the hot sauce I smothered on it.  The best part was by far the fries which weren't all that great.  I am glad that those were home made.  I picked all the bread off ate mostly the fries and was not very impressed.  The beer makes everything tastes better so order at least two beers before eating.  I'm not a big foodie but I like my food taste better.  I still ate because I was hungry and it's not uneatable, just bland and kinda of boring.  It's still a must do in Pitts so go ahead and do it at least once, but skip the rest of your stay.",2
2187,"i guess if you are in Pittsburgh and you want to do Pittsburgh things you have to grab a Primanti Bros sandwich but it isn't that good of a sandwich. Pittsburgh is loaded with great places to eat.  you can certainly do better.  having said that, i  totally get grabbing a Primanti Bros if you are in Pitt.",2
2188,"First time going...and I LOVED IT! Great service, tasty food, and a \""hometown\"" ambiance. I'm not from Pittsburgh, but this place definitely made me feel at home. The portions are huge! My only regret is that I didn't try to split a meal w/ my girlfriend.",5
2189,"Service was bad. Server walked away before we were done ordering and then when someone got her attention she had to return 5 minutes later to re clarify which it was wrong. We didn't see her for a good 20 minutes and had to go up to the bar for refills. She did take one of our cups to refill it, sat it on the bar and left it there for 10 minutes, when we finally saw her again had to ask her to grab it off the bar. Highly disappointing Philly cheesesteak!! The meat in it is that of a frozen Salisbury steak TV dinner!! French fries were good.",1
2190,"First Yelp review ever. Not impressed at all! 45% bread, 25% cole slaw, 25% fries, and 5% meat. The bread is cold and not grilled or warmed on the grill. Avoid and eat else where. Don't even think about the wings (dry and no flavor).",1
2191,"There are some places that are better when you grow up or at least have memories while eating at a restaurant. This was highly recommended to us while visiting Pittsburgh. First, we were disappointed by how many places were closed on a Sunday. We wanted bar type food with a couple of drinks. We were told to go there by several people. I got the capacola, great concept putting the coleslaw and fries in the sandwich but it just tasted bland to me. I asked for them to toast the bread but they said they couldn't do it because it sticks to the grill... \""Can't put a piece of bread on the grill?\"" Again, when there a memories of this place I am sure the sandwich taste better than they really are. But as an outsider judging the food alone, it was sub par.",2
2192,I had the famous Pitts-Burger and it was disgusting! The only reason I'm giving it two stars is because of the bread. The bread is super soft and tasty but the meat was gross and the cole slaw was bitter. I don't see what the hype is all about!,2
2193,"If you've been to Pittsburgh you know what to expect from a Primanti Sandwich. When I'm in the mood for them, they are fantastic. So when my mother and aunt came to visit da Burgh for the first time they were intensely curious about local restaurants, and this one came up. They thought it sounded fun and different, but since one is pescatarian leaning to the veg side, and the other is gluten intolerant, I really didn't think Primanti would be the best place to take them.\n\nWalking around down town we passed this one, and they wanted to sit down and give it a try. It was a beautiful day so we sat outside, which was really amazing. We were also amazed by our server. By the end of the meal, we were amazed she remembered to show up at work at all. In fact, its a distinct possiblility that she didn't ever work there, and was just confused and thought she was at the greek place across the square. You don't go to a sandwich shop to be blown away by your server, but there is a minimum standard you should aspire to, and she was far off that mark.\n\nShe took forever to get there, but it was no hardship sitting outside on a beautiful day with two of my favorite gals. We talked about the menu, Auntie decided to order anything with no bread, with some loaded fries. Mom wanted a sardine sandwich, but only if its the sardine filets, she doesn't like the kind with bones. She is not one to make a fuss, so figured cheese and egg would be fine too. \n\nWhen she came around for drinks, they got a water and a pop. I asked if she had PBR, and she replied she didn't know. Then continued to stand there, pen in hand, ready to write my drink order down. OK then, how about I just have a diet pop. Before she ran off, we ordered our meals. I asked her if the sardines have bones in them or not. She looked up from her note pad and looked at me with a look that said {insert foul insult here} and shrugged. A big, slow, deliberate shrug. Not a word. And then just stood there waiting to write my order down. After a good, long, awkward pause, she said \""I don't know.\""  All three of us just looked back at her, waiting, until eventually she sighed, held her pad down by her side, and with a big roll of the eyes, asked if I wanted her to check. Yes. Please do.\n\nSo then she ran off, and started running food out to tables all around and refilling drinks. Running the sandwiches, she would grab two or three tables at a time, and then put all the sandwiches down, sort of paw through them to see what was what, and leave theirs and take the rest. It was just strange.\n\nShe came back, and without looking up announced \""Don't matter, we are out of sardines anyways.\""Facepalm! From the length of time she had been inside the restaurant, I doubt she even asked. Mom, very uncomfortable that her question had become such a horrible inconvenience, asked for egg and cheese. Auntie ordered loaded fries to start, then her corned beef with no bread. The waitress told her she already gets fries with her sandwich, but she wanted them anyways. I got balogna, just because neither of them would ever guess what jumbo means.\n\nOf course, the order came out quickly, and wrong. Mine was fine the way it came, but not what I asked for. Mom was the same. Auntie was fine, but no loaded fries every showed up. Until we got the check, that's where they were. Getting those taken off was another huge inconvenience to our poor server. \n\nMy Aunt picked up lunch, and left the tip. I don't know what she left, but I think that probably amazed the server as much as her server amazed us. All in all, I reckon she enjoyed our lunch together just as much as we did.",2
2194,I was pleasantly surprised!  I went in with low expectations after seeing the so-so reviews and hearing from people that it's not all it's cracked up to be.  Got the steak sandwich with everything on it.  I ate most of it and wasn't even that hungry to begin with.  Definitely needed salt/pepper and the hot sauce they had.  When you add potatoes to a sandwich it tends to make it taste bland unless you have a killer sauce.  The sandwich could feed most people for two meals and it's only $7..great value.  23 oz miller lite was only $4..also so cheap.  We enjoyed sitting at the bar and watching the head cook make quick work of 100+ sandwiches.  These people got the routine down pat.  I would definitely eat it again and appreciate the history of the place.,4
2195,"The restaurant did their level best to make it up to me, so here's another star for giving a damn. Thanks!",3
2196,Definitely didn't live up to the expectations.  Being from the east coast I've had my fair share of delicious sandwiches.  Stopped in for lunch and had the capicola sandwich.  Outside of the bread I can't say it was memorable in any way.\n\nThat said I could see this as a post night out stop and would probably enjoy it a lot more.,2
2197,"Well, now I know why people don't usually put french fries in their sandwiches. Sandwich comes out huge and kind of dry, and you can't taste the meat at all.",2
2198,"Had the second best seller which was really good.   A nice carb coma from the italian bread and fries.  A great mix of salty from the meat and those aforementioned fries with the sweet from the slaw!  \n\nThe service was good so why only three stars?  Well, when your choice was seeing the stories on their televisions about our enemy murdering defenseless journalists or some show about naked people living off the land...kind of stifles the appetite and not appropriate for even the most casual of dining!   I would have expected better from the hipsters running the joint.",3
2199,This was a fun sandwich as I was visiting Pittsburgh. It was neat to hear the origin that truck drivers just wanted their cole slaw & fries slapped in with the sandwich so they could eat it on the go. I appreciate the concept & it's worth a try but I don't need to come back. I liked fat heads more.,3
2200,"The beer selection is limited to what you might find in convince store (in states where this is possible. Sandwiches are Pittsburgh landmarks though and the food is good but nothing truly special. Great place to hang with friends, catch a game and chow down.",3
2201,"customer service is always nice but dont you all think that this place is little over-rated? Their 'Almost Famous Sandwitches' need some hard work to get famous. Basically, this place is like Dr. Pepper soda. People are crazy about it but that thing tastes extremely ridiculous.",2
2202,"We decided to stop by Primanti brothers after hearing all the hype from everyone. We were already primed with the fact that their sandwiches are stuffed with fries so we decided to just share one sandwich. And holy moley was it colossal (well we DID get the colossal fish and cheese). We ended up taking most of the fries out because it got too heavy and filling. The coleslaw in the sandwich was pretty good-- not a huge amount of mayo which is what I like. However, even finishing half the sandwich was a huge battle for me. Toward the end, it wasn't pleasant at all because it was just way too filling.",3
2203,"I go to Point Park so this Primanti's is a staple for me and my friends. We go here probably 4 or 5 times a semester - always in groups of at least 4 and often more. The food is so great it's hard to care about anything else. I usually get the capicola with an egg, or pastrami with an egg. I have realized recently that the service is getting worse and worse (last time I went there I wasn't able to get a refill on my drink because our server never even came by our table after he served our food). Also, I was super upset that you were completely out of malt vinegar for my sandwich. Other than that, it's always great.",4
2204,"I knew that once we hit Pittsburgh, we HAD to try Primanti Bros. Everybody AND their bro had been raving about it and I just had to give it a taste for myself. \n\nUnfortunately...my taste did me no great feat. I ordered the Capicola and Cheese from a waitress who would have rather thrown a sandwich in my face than take my order...no joke: service=terrible. HOWEVER, I was willing to give them a pass seeing as it was the day of a Steelers home game and that place was PACKKKKED. (I've done my fair share of service work and I know days like that can be a real bitch) Moving along...after I ordered for myself and my handsome ginger sidekick, I was oozing with excitement to get my butt in a seat and chow down on this sandwich I had heard about all weekend! \n\nFast Forward THIRTY. MINUTES. LATER. We get our food.\n\nOk, I get it, your busy. But let me reiterate here: FOUR tables were served before we were. And we only got two sandwiches. Insert pissed emoji here. \n\nSo, after all was said and done, my sandwich was just ok. Nothing to write home about. The service blew it for me. And I was so pumped too. Damn.",2
2205,"I've tried it twice now because if you ever mention you're going to Pittsburgh the first thing you hear is \""Oh Man, you HAVE to go to Primanti's\"".  Sorry, I guess it's just not my thing.  It's not horrible once I take off all the french fries they pile up, but it's definitely not my thing.",2
2206,"The sandwiches are interesting and the fries in them are interesting.\n\nI don't like fries or potatoey fries, mostly just the crispy ones.\n\nThe sandwich was good and quick but because I'm not a huge fan of fries it wouldn't make sense for me to go back.\n\nIt also was super crowded.",3
2207,"I don't care for Primanti brothers.  It is overrated.  There are much better sandwiches in the city.\n\nThe sandwiches aren't bad, they just aren't great.  I like the fries.  I like the vinegar based cole slaw.  Both are great.  The white bread is fine.  My issue is with the main ingredients.  The main ingredients just seem to be lacking in quality.\n\nMy other issue is their restaurants are all filthy.  I've been to 4 different Primanti locations and each one just seems greasy.\n\nBetter Pittsburgh Sandwich Alternatives:\nFathead's has a sandwich with kielbasa and pierogies.\nWingharts has a burger with fries and cole slaw.",2
2208,"Monte Cello's Downtown does not look like much from the outside.  It is wedged into a small triangular shaped building.  They are open for lunch and dinner.  Their pizza has been a staple of Downtown since 1980.\n\nTheir specialty pizzas include spinach and feta cheese pizza, a little too oily for my tastes (it's made with an oil and garlic sauce).  A much better choice is Buffalo Chicken Pizza, which is Buffalo sauce topped with cheese and spicy chicken.  The chicken has a nice fresh taste to it and while spicy, is never overdone.\n\nBut I love the hoagies the best here.  My favorite is the tuna hoagie, which is served with cheese, lettuce, tomato, & grilled onions.  I know, break out the Listerine strips after eating one of those.  If I like something a little zestier, I'll get the Capicola or the Genoa Salami hoagie.\n\nThey have a lunch buffet here too.  I've never tried it because I prefer my food made-to-order.",3
2209,"I've eaten here several times.  Their pizza is good.  The only annoying thing is the small fountain drinks that come with the lunch specials (and no refills).  But the best thing, that brings me back time after time, is their chicken salad.  Its topped with crisp fries - Pittsburgh style - plus melted mozzarella cheese.  Divine.  Just a warning - don't make a mistake thinking the steak salad is just as good.  The steak has a musty taste.",4
2210,"It's been awhile since I've reviewed Monte Cello's so I thought I'd hit it again yesterday.  Monte Cello's in a rather unassuming building.  It's a little cramped in there and definitely not the most inviting place in the world.  But yesterday was one of those picture perfect summer days--perfect for getting a good sandwich or slice and heading over to a plaza for some Al Fresco dining (unfortunately Al Fresco called in sick so I had to eat alone).\n\nSo let's see, which sandwich did I want?  Philly Chicken hoagie?  Capicola hoagie?  grilled Chicken?  Nah, the Genoa salami hoagie seemed just right.  \n\nThe food here is pretty good.  But you're always better off getting it to go.",3
2211,"My office often gets Pizza delivered from Monte Cello's. The crust is thin and the pizza is decent.  I have gone there a few times for lunch to grab a few slices of pizza (with others). I agree that the small fountain drinks with no refills is annoying.  If I am going to eat in, I prefer Villa Reale on Smithfield.  You can get slices during lunch if you sit at the counter.",3
2212,"Monte Cellos is located fairly close to my work, and so I've gone a few times.  Each time, I ask myself, \""Why am I going back?\""\n\nMediocre dish after Mediocre dish, somehow I think it will get better next time.\n\nLast time I had a Grilled Chicken Salad that they're known for --- at least that's what the cashier said.  It was grilled chicken, french fries, a little cheese on chopped lettuce. Can you say B-O-R-I-N-G?\n\nToday I had a steak hoagie.  Enough places in Pittsburgh do these that comparing them is easy.  While the bread is fresh, and the hoagie buns are huge --- it's all downhill from here.  Enter three slices of steak-ums and the contents of the hoagie are just flat. The bread is 90% of the meal. Unmemorable.\n\nI was happy with the pizza I had there, but for salads and hoagies? Not so much.",2
2213,"Very close to work for me and the others in my office.  Was excited about getting a steak salad, which I found is a staple here in the Burgh.  The first one I got in July 2012 was good.  I don't know if the method of cooking or person cooking the steak had changed or the meat supplier is different, but after that, I've had two steak salads where the meat was just too tough!  Haven't been back since.  Probably won't go back to get a salad until the meat is cooked tender and not left to become shoe leather.  Not getting a salad again unless someone can convince me that the meat was just cooked and juicy!  \n\nPizza's are yummy and pizza lovers will like their small but adequate pizza buffet which has about 8 different types of pizza.  \n\nThe restaurant is always crowded  at lunch time.  There is a large turnover of pizza so it's always hot.",3
2214,"I'm picky about the quality of meat, so I was disappointed when I specifically asked if the chicken parmesan sub had whole breast meat, the cashier said yes, then it turned out to be school cafeteria style chicken patty with bread crumb filler. Yuck, I should've trusted my gut and ordered the eggplant parm. K got the Italian sub. It was \""ok, not the greatest.\"" I recommend trying a different \""cheap eats\"" if you're downtown.",2
2215,"There are always atleast 2 group of annoying kids who just loiter and stare at everyone as they're walking in & out. The staff doesn't seem to care. Make sure to check your fries before you leave bc they are sometimes Luke warm. Even after you buy something it's a challenge for them to unlock the bathroom. You stand at the door 5min, walk to the counter and ask again then walk back and wait at the door forever again until finally you head back to the counter one last time and freak out.. all to pop a squat over the toilet.

2220,"I think this should be more like 1.5 stars. I got a 6-pack of tamales. They were more expensive than I would've guessed (I sort of had to, considering they weren't priced). First I open the package and low-and-behold this bag of six tamales, in fact, contains only five! The filling is fine, but the masa blows. It is dry and gritty. The preparation instructions seem questionable (microwave in a plastic bag? Really?). I'm saving the remaining ones for when I'm too drunk to care about anything. The tortillas are still worth it.",2
2221,"I've been to the taco stand now!  Yaaaaaaaaaaay!  On our way out of town for the holidays, we needed a quick snackie and made a stop at Reyna's for taco deliciousness.  We got four - two chicken, chorizo, carrnitas.  YUM.  They were so fun to eat - messy, sitting in our car, hot sauce dripping down our fingers - who doesn't love street food?  Seriously, this is the only place I've laid eyes on in Pittsburgh that appears to sell tacos of this kind.  I kind of want to go back....like, now.\n\nOH BUT WAIT.  Stop.  the churros.  On a whim, I ordered some churros real quick, and watched the guy pour the batter into hot oil right before my very eyes.  They floated around, browning and sizzling, then he took them out and put them directly into cinnamon sugar, into a paper plate thing, and then into my hands.  They were the best churros ever.  Love at first bite.  Love just watching them sizzle! \n\nI think I want to try empanadas next time if I can tear myself away from the tacos.",4

Ok, I lied. I like them so much I just do it up big and get a burrito. It's just a magic mixture of rice, cheese, salsa and lots and lots of lime. I'm into the shrimp burrito because i love me some shrimp. But really, any type of meat or a veggie choice is going to be awesome. Plus they are cheap cheap cheap! \n\nDo me a favor and stop by this stand while you're out shopping in the strip, you will not regret it. Rain, snow or sunshine!",5

Lots of different types of dried chillies, prepared salsas, chorizos, frozen tamales, different types of soda pop and drinks that you won't find in a regular grocers. \n\nI haven't tried the taco stand yet but the coup de grace of the grocers itself though is the fresh tortillas, both corn and flour. Delicious! (And beans).",4

2226,"Reyna's Food saved my life!!!\n\nOk, not really.  As a recent transplant from Colorado (having been born and raised in New Mexico) I was really homesick for some actual Mexican food, which you can not get at any restaurant out here.  \n\nI was so excited when I saw the sign outside that advertised actual Hatch Green Chile (it's chile - not chili, people!).  It was pricey - but that's to be expected.  It was also very tasty.\n\nI was impressed by the wide selection of Latino Foods, and while their tortillas aren't what I'm used to, they are quite good.  I'll be going back again and again!",4

2228,"Where to begin, where to begin...\n\nMore often than not, I find myself staring at my computer screen thinking about how I am going to blast an esablishment. I don't rave about \""good\"" food. I rave about amazing food. The type of food that I have dreams about. The type of food that makes me want to bring about a thousand dollars cash and gorge myself untill I need an ambulance.\n\nThe taco stand outside of Reyna Foods makes just that kind of food. Too often when we think of Mexican food, we think of a variety samey tasting, samey textured mixtures of ground beef, yellow cheese, beans, and tomatoes stuffed into a processed flour tortilla covered with a plastic sauce (I'm looking at you Emiliano's). Reyna's doesn't just break the mold, they hurl it at the wall, smash the pieces with a bat and then scatter the dust in a blast furnace. The tacos here are aboslutely amazing. Fresh ingredients cooked right there on an old plancha-style grill that has absorbed the flavors of countless meals and stuffed into fresh corn tortillas are a truly enlightening experience. I mean it. \n\nThe first time I went here was to just grab a quick snack while walking around in the Strip district. I saw they offered tongue as a protein choice and thought to myself \""What the hell, in for a dime in for a dollar right?\"" Best. Choice. Ever. The first bite was like reaching the Seventh Level of Enlightenment. The Buddha said I could ask one question. After careful consideration I asked, \""Can I have another taco?\"" After that I made a vow that I would forever be a loyal raving fan.\n\nThe tacos are assembled to your liking. I like mine with the works: the perfectly cooked meat on the warm tortilla then covered with queso fresco, tomatoes, lettuce, onion, cilantro, fresh lime juice, and sour cream. The flavors all play well together to strike a classical tune of a Mexican bolero on the pallate. As previously mentioned, I like the tongue. It has a wonderful richness and gameyness to it that I have come to love. My far less adventurous girlfriend stays with the chicken. They have other choices ranging from pork, to steak, to shrimp, to the ever popular ground beef (gotta please everyone I guess).\n\nAfter you order your tacos, try one of the fresh made flavored waters there. The fresh lime water is always my favorite, and is there every day, but they also have hibiscus, watermelon and other flavor selections. My girlfriend got the horchata, a milk based concoction with cinnamon, nutmeg and sugar. Or you could pop inside the Mexican grocery for a Coke hecho en Mexico. My favorite Coke because they use cane sugar, not HFCS.\n\nThe only downside is that they close right around 3:00 PM.\n\nCome to Reyna's. The tacos are amazing. Do I really need to say any more?",5
2229,"The stand outside (edgars), chicken taco with everything on it, best ever.",5
2230,Very good Mexican place! I got the enchiladas verdes which were a little too spicy for me but very good. My boyfriend got a steak quesadilla which was AMAZING! I wish I ordered it.

2231,"This review is for the taco stand in front of Reyna's, which is run by the same owner as Reyna's and Casa Reyna. Note that this is *not* the same stand as the one around the corner on 21st Street, across the alley from Pamela's.\n\nI got an order of three tacos from them on a cold day a couple weekends ago. The meat was cold before I could start eating it, and I assumed it had just cooled off quickly. \n\nWithin a few hours everything I had eaten was leaving me in a hurry. I felt sick and weak for the rest of the day, and was better (and completely empty) the next morning.\n\nNever going back, of course. This doesn't directly reflect on Casa Reyna's inside restaurant, but since the same people run it, it makes me worry about their food handling standards.\n\nI'll probably keep getting Reyna's big bag of chips when I need them for a party, but I'm never eating any other prepared food from them again.",1
2232,"This is a top-notch mexican grocery, albeit a small one. They sell corn and flour tortillas made on location that will change your life. They also make a variety of fresh salsas and dips. It also has a good selection of hot sauces and pre-packaged salsas. There is a small selection of produce to and other groceries you need but might not find at regular grocery stores. Overall a must-visit if you're making some Mexican.",5
2233,"I just moved to Pittsburgh from New Mexico and was excited to hear about this place. Unfortunately, it was not as good as I hoped. The cashier argued with my boyfriend over what kind of dried red chiles to buy, and harassed him when he was browsing the store (she yelled across the store: \""Are you done yet? I already started ringing you up.\""). The house-made corn tortillas were bland and only with the help of a guy running a nearby taco stand (who did not work at Reyna's) did we find the right chiles... The cashier had no idea what we were asking for.\n\nThen there was the Hatch green chile fiasco. Shortly after arriving here, I was searching for Hatch green chile in the area and found out Reyna's would be doing pre-orders. Hooray! I ordered and paid for some online. The website said they would be roasting at the store so I called to ask about it. I was told in a very rude manner that roasting would only happen at the pepper festival, which I would have to pay $7 per person to attend, just to get my chile and get it roasted. Okay, fine. The day before the festival I called the store to confirm that my actual pre-order would be available at the festival. I was mid-question when the clerk on the phone interrupted me: \""What? ... Can you call back later, I'm really busy.\"" WTF?\n\nSo I go to the festival to get my chile. The people at the roasting station seem confused when I present my pre-order receipt, but they eventually figure it out, telling me to come back later to get t because it isn't roasted yet. We walked around the festival for an hour then went back, and there is even more confusion over whether ours is ready. Finally they figure it out and give us the roasted chile. Hooray!\n\nOh wait though. We get home and open it up and... Apparently they don't know how to roast it correctly. We bought bulk roasted chiles in New Mexico every year and never had issues peeling it before freezing it. This chile they roasted? It's somehow completely mushy and falling apart, but has almost no visible char, and it's fucking impossible to remove the peel. It's horrible. \n\nSo tl;dr - rude employees, both in person and on the phone. Little product knowledge. And absolutely no knowledge of how to roast green chiles, despite having a whole event around the chiles. I won't be going back.",2
2234,I have shopped here periodically over the last 8 years I have lived in Pittsburgh but after this last visit NEVER AGAIN! The woman working there was so rude I could hardly believe it. A gentleman came in speaking Spanish and she gave him attitude and even after he started speaking English she was still rude to him.  I accidentally dropped a small bottle of hot syrup ( my bad) I apologized profusely and felt so bad I bought a bunch of other stuff- even after the woman was really nasty about the whole situation. After I walked out I realized she charged me for the broken bottle without even telling me! I guess I should have just walked out without buying stuff. Its a shame because they are close to where I live but next time I'll take the trip to one of the Mexican groceries in Brookline.,2
2235,"I went there on a Saturday afternoon by myself and wanted to sit out front.  The host made fun of me!  Said \""aw, that's too bad\"" when I said it was just me.  No, it is perfectly fine in my book!\n\nI got the lobster roll, plenty of lobster on a garlic bread roll.  It was just ok.  \n\nThe most annoying part was the host kept coming out to talk to me.  I really just wanted to chill out by myself, not get hit on by the creepy host!",3
2236,"I went here for the first time on Saturday night. I had to go & try the famous Giant Fish Sandwich! When it arrived, I was impressed. The fish was even bigger than I expected & the batter was perfect. Also, the beer menu is lengthy! They serve beers from almost every corner of the world! I thought about trying something new, but turns out I was homesick for a good old Pennsylvania beer... :) Roland's is definitely a cool place in my book. I'll be back! :P",4
2237,OMG what a nightmare. I was there last saturday at 9pm with a group of 10 people in the second floor bar area. The bartenders acted like it was a big inconvience that we were there. ordered drinks and didnt even get a thank you. the bar was dirty and littered with dirty glasses. The restrooms were filthy and didnt even have toliet paper . We left the bar and spent a HUGE anoun of money up the street.. I will never go back.,1
2238,"I've been here twice. The first time was at least two years ago and I can't remember anything in particular about it.\n\nThe second time, though, was tonight, Valentine's Day. A group  of friends and I chose this restaurant after the place we wanted to go was closed--for good. Roland's was it, then. It wasn't very crowded, so we were seated right away. The first thing that caught my attention was how the waitresses/waiters were dressed. They weren't dressed how I would have expected them to be. They were in jeans and baggy tshirts. But, our waitress was helpful, and our food came out pretty quickly. it wasn't a memorable meal or experience. I wanted a caesar salad with my dinner, but they were out of romaine lettuce (and it wasn't late in the evening--maybe 6:30pm at the latest). The bleu cheese dressing, though, tasted pretty good. I ordered a ravioli dish for my entree, but when I asked if I could get a different sauce, the waitress said it's already mixed together, meh. I'm not a fan of that. When my friends went to order their pasta dishes, they had a choice between penne and linguini, but the restaurant was out of penne, too.\n\nOh well, the prices aren't terrible, and the good came out pretty quickly, and hot. It's not the best restaurant, but it's not a stink hole, either.",2
2239,Another place that I visit once every few years thinking it couldn't be as bad as I remember it.  And the place NEVER lets me down; it's just as bad as I remember.  The seafood is breaded and fried to the point of inedible.  The staff is rude.  The prices are too high for the quality.  Just all around disappointing.,1
2240,"My scallops were luke-warm yet overcooked.  The carrots on my salad looked like they had been sitting in the bottom of a fridge for weeks. \n\nThe first time I dined here, I was unimpressed with their lobster roll (which is simply a hollowed-out white roll filled with lobster.  bread and seafood, that's IT).  Today, I was unimpressed with everything.\n\nExcept the woman two tables over who laughed like cigar-smoking circus clown and looked like Patrick Swayze in drag.  That was pretty awesome.",2
2241,"I hesitate to even write this review because technically we didn't eat here.  But after reading the other reviews, I thought \""Eh, what the hell.\""\n\nWe came in and were seated at 5:45pm for desserts/drinks.   By 6:05, we still hadn't seen our waitress.  We decided it wasn't worth it and just left.\n\nI did eat here a month ago, and yes -- the fried fish was fried to the point where it was beyond greasy.  And then to pay around $20 for that?  LOL.  Right.\n\nI won't be back.",1
2242,"Went to this place for lunch last Saturday, party of five. The service was extremely slow and every beer we tried to order, got the response \""We are out of that one\"". \n\nFinally when we got our sandwiches (after a long wait) but no coleslaw and fries were soggy and stale. When asked the waitress for coleslaw (which is supposed to be the side with every sandwich), the response was \""I think we are out, but let me check\"". And the waitress didn't return until after we were done eating. \nForget about getting a refill for your drink or water..",1
2243,Messy floors but quick waiter,3
2244,"I went here on a Friday afternoon for lunch with some coworkers. We were a party of 12. Even though the restaurant was busy, they were able to get us a table. Apparently there is a second floor room that can be rented out for parties, but they don't take reservations. \n\nThe interior of the building is nicer than I thought, judging from the outside and other Yelp reviews. They have a lot of large televisions, which would make this an ideal spot for watching a game. \n\nOur server was very pleasant and friendly, but some of the staff has that native Pittsburgher gruffness, which some people might translate as rude. There do seem to be some staffing problems, though. A latecomer to our group asked another waitress clearing a nearby table if she was our waitress. The woman said \""no\"" and walked away without offering to get our server. It was a little weird. Our waitress also had people at the other end of the table yell their lunch orders, even though it was very loud. She could have easily walked over, so that was odd, too. \n\nNot being in the mood for fish, I ordered the white pizza. It was very large, much bigger than I expected. I ended up taking the leftovers with me, and it fed me for two more meals. So, while the prices are a little more than you'd expect to pay at a similar restaurant, many of the portions are huge. Two people could easily split the fish sandwich.\n\n The pizza was pretty good, with a paper-thin crust and plenty of tomatoes and pungent garlic. I think the garlic was from a jar. The cheese was a tangy blend. \n\nAll of Roland's pizzas are oven-fired, and some of my pieces of crust were burned black. This may be a plus to some people, but I don't much care for it. \n\nIn all, it was a decent meal, and the rest of my party seemed to be happy with their food. I'd like to come back here and try some other menu items.",3
2245,"We spent a few hours here on the day of the St. Patrick's Day parade, and had a great time.  The space is pretty large, with indoor and outdoor seating.  They have something like 500 beers; a major plus! We sat upstairs, and because the kegs are kept in the basement, they can't get beer all the way up there.  That means you have to order bottled beer from the waitress but can go downstairs and order draft beers.  That's sort of weird.  Anywho-- I had a caesar salad and french onion soup.  Both were tasty, and the other people in my party liked their food too-- pizza and burgers.  The waitress was super friendly.  I'd like to go back and enjoy their upstairs patio & a lobster roll!",4
2246,"NEVER AGAIN!!!! Horrible service and horrible food! It took 20 minutes for our waitress to even come to our table! Looking back on it, I don't know why we didn't leave... maybe because we had to wait 20 minutes to even get a table (this was during the summer). We ordered the muscles to start off which were okay but definitely not something I would recommend. My husband ordered the fish and chips and I ordered the crab cakes.... EPIC FAIL!!! The crab cakes were so disgusting my husband and I had to switch meals. The crab cakes taste like fried mayo... I couldn't even taste the crab! The fish and chips looked great but it didn't taste like anything! No seasoning at all! The waitress was so bad that when it came time to give us our check, she was no where to be found. It took 15 minutes to actually get the check (keep in mind we already finished eating)... thank God we had cash! A complete waste of $40. Yes, I remember exactly how much I spent even though it was months ago because I kept thinking how I could have spent that money in a better place! I could have got a mani & pedi... had some great sushi... the list goes on. lol",1
2247,"I was immediately displeased by the snaggle toothed hostess and her surly demeanor. The air conditioning was non existent, which is a hangover nightmare. While waiting for a table the bartender ignored us for ten minutes and couldn't even transfer our drinks to the table. He also casually instructed me that one must pay per beer - duh! I'm not a beer drinking novice. The acne-ridden server was friendly enough, but seemed forlorn and was overtly sweating. Bringing drinks to a table isn't neuroscience and I don't drink tap water. After sitting at our table for a few minutes it was very apparent that the entire serving staff is haggard. Appetizer - crab artichoke dip. Bland. Where's the crab? Also, did a toddler arrange the plate? Apparently. Meal - fish tacos. Came quickly and surprisingly flavorful. However, our server never once checked on our status and we had to beckon him to fulfill our needs. I shouldn't have to ask for napkins at the point of need. No tip, never coming back.",2
2248,"It was raining and we were in the Strip district craving some seafood.  We decided to stop by Roland's Seafood Grill.\n\nWe were seated right away close to the bar in front of the big screen projector where the US open was playing.  Our orders were taken right away then we waited for 30 minutes before our meals came out.  We were glad for the US Open entertainment.\n\nMy dad order the clam chowder soup, which was chunky and bare of any clams.  My mom and I shared a couple of appetizers, the calamari was great but the crab cake was just ok and a bit salty.\n\nService gets 2 stars and Food gets 3 stars.\n\nOverall, this place gets a 2.5 stars.  If you are caught in the rain and do not have any other choices in the strip area, stop by.  I would recommend scoping out the other restaurants in the area.",2
2249,"We had a frustrating and disappointing experience at Roland's, a dining out experience on a recent 4-day visit to Pittsburgh.\n\nFirst, all of the food was extremely overpriced. The quality was what you would find if you were ordering from a bar...but it was twice as expensive. The $16 I paid for fried cod got me two soggy cod filets, steamed bland vegetables and boring roasted potatoes. I couldn't have tried to make food this poor. It was a Sysco food operation gone wrong: runoff from Houlihan's mixed with Joe's Crab Shack. \n\nThe service was so slow that we were cancelling orders due to the delay in bringing them to the table. My dish arrived without any sort of sauce, and we even had to get up and order beer from the bar because our waitress was so behind. It was her \""second day on the job,\"" but this is unacceptable. They could have at least comp'd our beers, or offered some other way to make it up (besides coming over to informing us that they had charged the beers to our bill).\n\nRoland's had space available on a Monday night, unlike the other restaurants in the neighborhood. This was really convenient initially, but I now have an idea of why this was the case.",1
2250,"Extremely Slow Service!   We have eaten here many times and, while the fish sandwich is great, the staff and management have yet to figure out how to manage the tables. This establishment can become quite busy and, if you don't aggressively pursue service, you are likely to wait 20 minute or more just to get a menu.  This is particularly true if you are sitting in one of the outside areas.",2
2251,"In the Strip District, there's not many options when you're hungry. Walking up and down, the Strip district is filled with booths of steelers and penguins gear. There was a breakfast place and Primanti brothers that was packed. So we were dying for some food and ran across Roland's. We got mussels and banana peppers stuffed with sausage for our appetizers. I also got a lobster roll. They gave us a lot of mussels slathered with garlic and butter. Surprisingly good. And the banana peppers were not bad too. I also enjoyed my lobster roll. Buttered toast and big chunks of lobster meat. I had no room left to finish off my fries. \n\nNow, I can't decide if the food was average or below average as we were pretty hungry. I'll give Roland's the benefit of the doubt. Don't expect anything spectacular, just food that fills your belly.",3
2252,"We headed to the strip district to soak in the atmosphere like any good tourist should do.\n\nUnfortunately we love to sleep and showed up a little late and by the time we were ready to eat (around 4pm) our list of recommended places to try were already closed for the day. \n\nRoland's was open though. As an added bonus they were showing the Steeler's game and there is nothing that Pittsburgh loves more than supporting the Steeler's and Penguin's. The atmosphere was great with everyone dressed in black and yellow and really into the game.\n\nWe ordered wedding soup (pretty delicious) and Portobello Mushroom Pizza. Maybe our mistake was not ordering seafood, anyway the caramelized onions on it were actually cooked in sugar (eww) and the sauce itself was just as sweet. It felt like we were eating candy.\n\nAs for the staff, Pittsburgh in general has some of the friendliest people I've come across in a long time. The staff here may not have been quite as friendly as we had come to expect from the rest of this lovely city but they were just fine.",2
2253,"As others have said, nice location and sitting on the patio is nice in the warm sunny months, but the food is not anything special.  Fried seafood, decent lobster roll, other non-impressive dishes.  good for a few drinks and a quick bite if in the area.",2
2254,"I would give this restaurant 0 stars if I could.  The food was lousy, the drinks were expensive, and the service was awful.\n\nI complained to the manager about my experience and he told that if I didn't like it, there were plenty of other bars in The Strip District.\n\nPlease, please, please go somewhere else.",1
2255,"I was only here for drinks, on a Saturday night.  It was decent - the drinks were fairly mixed and priced.\n\nThe atmosphere was a bit lacking.  There isn't much personality here, and for a Saturday, I would have expected a bit more of a crowd.  Overall, not bad if you're in the area for a drink; but not a destination.",3
2256,"Well I have had several meals over the years at Rolands, many of which were good.  Yesterday was not one of those days.\n\nAfter being seated, it took nearly 10 minutes for a server to greet us and take a drink order.  I was of course rewarded with the wrong beer.\n\nThen we order and when the food arrived, the fries were cold and the fish sandwich was rather greasy.\n\nI wake up today only to be 'sick' from the whole ordeal.  My mother, who had the same food as I did, is feeling the same as me.\n\nGet your act together Rolands, you are better than this.",2
2257,"Yuck!\n\nIt's almost embarrassing having this place exist in the Strip with so many tourists coming here.  That has to be how they're making their money because it's certainly not on their food or service.  Well, maybe it's the booze too...\n\nI don't even know where to begin.  Service was horrible.  The lunch took 2 hours.  On a leisurely Sunday that may be fine, but there was no leisure.  At least not with drinks not in hand until a 1/2 an hour after we sat down.  I'd say lunch was served another 1/2 to 45 minutes later.  \n\nIt didn't matter though, I knew it wasn't going to be anything spectacular.  I'd heard rumors about the food.  I won't go into any details but I wouldn't trust some items on the menu.  I just played it safe and ordered a veggie salad.  \n\nThe salad was in the entree section, so I assumed it would be a full size salad.  It was not.  It was a side salad with a handful of grilled veggies on top.  Nothing spectacular.  And a side salad at almost $11.  Not worth it.  \n\nIf you are forced to stop in because you're dying of hunger, stick to a liquid diet:)",1
2258,"The Lobster Roll Caesar Salad was very good, and the service at the bar was great!",3
2259,"I am only judging this place as a bar, never had the food.  I'd rather give it 2.5 stars.\n\nI came here with a colleague after a long, long travel experience to get to Pittsburgh.  \n\nThey had a nice collection of beers including some local ones.  The only negative side is that the bartender had almost no knowlege of what the beers were like so we had to just try our luck.  The bartender had never tried any of the beers nor did he care about them.  I would have liked to have more info in order to make smarter choices about which beers to get.  At least one of them I would have avoided if I'd know more about it.\n\nPerhaps he was just not used to encountering a beer geek.\n\nI did pass by the place the next day around lunch and it was full of customers.  For what ever that means.",3
2260,"Just awful. \n\nMy companions each ordered an Alfredo pasta and they both honestly thought (through the entire meal) that Roland's had served mashed potatoes on the pasta.\n\nWe thought \""maybe it's a 'burgh thing.\""\n\nNope, we were informed at the end of the meal by the waiter that it was indeed Alfredo sauce and that the chef \""just liked to use a lot of parmesan cheese in his Alfredo.\"" This stuff was about the consistently of cold oatmeal with oil poured over it (no exaggeration) and there was a bucket full of it on each plate.\n\nAnybody who would serve what was on those plates has no business whatsoever in any kitchen. \n\nBy the way, my lobster roll was a buttery, greasy fail as well.\n\nWhat a complete disaster.",1
2261,"this place reeks of fish when you walk in and there are fruit flies everywhere.  Good place to dine if you're on a diet since you will surely lose your appetite.\n\nIf you find yourself at Rolands, do yourself a favor and leave and dine anywhere else in the Strip District.  Seriously.",1
2262,"My fiance and I went to Roland's for a \""date night\"".  We were both craving seafood, and had never been here before.  When we arrived, we asked our waitress if there was a happy hour going on.  There was a happy hour and she gave us the menu for it and said she'd be back in a minute to take our order.  The happy hour ended 2 minutes after she gave us the menus, and she came back over 10 minutes later to take our drink order.  Needless to say, we were unable to take advantage of any specials.  We both ordered margaritas for our drinks.  They took a further 15 minutes to come out.  Not only were the drinks weak (and this is coming from a bartender), but one margarita was a substantially different color than the other (despite being the same type).  Additionally, we were charged over $7 apiece for those margaritas that were made with well liquor.  If I'm spending $7 on a margarita, it had either better be tasty or strong (or both).  Anyway, we sip our disappointing drinks and decide to order an appetizer.  We got the Raspberry-maple scallops.  There were cooked well, but served in a watery sauce that removed almost all of the raspberry-maple flavor..  Then we ordered dinner.  We both ordered their broiled seafood medley, which comes with a salad.  I had the caesar salad, although I used the word \""salad\"" in the loosest sense possible.  There was lettuce there, but only after I uncovered it from a cup of croutons and a cup of parmesan cheese (not the fresh kind).  I spent about 5 minutes just trying to reach the lettuce in my salad under all that other stuff, and even when I finished I still had more cheese than lettuce.  While we were eating our salads our entrees were brought out, and we had the luxury of watching them grow cold while we finished our salads.  I'm sorry, but when I'm spending $30 on a entree I would like it served hot and after my salad.  Additionally, we were not provided a change of silverware at any point during our meal and I kept having to \""clean\"" my fork and knife on a spare napkin.  During our meal I ordered a second drink (beer this time, since liquor is apparently too difficult for them) and had to wait another 10 or so minutes before it was brought out.  I had also run out of water and had to wait 15 minutes before it was even noticed, let alone waiting for a refill.  While there were aspects of this evening that were frustrating, I must say that all of my seafood was cooked perfectly (I just wish I had been able to enjoy my entree while it was hot).  When we had eaten our fill and asked for the to-go boxes, the waitress asked to bring our check.  We still wanted another round of drinks and possibly dessert, but she never asked for either.  Despite the feeling that we were being rushed and she wanted to hurry us along, I decided to order another drink.  In my opinion, it is good manners to make customers feel welcome, relaxed, and not rushed.  We did not feel any of these things.  This was supposed to be our date night and there were just so many little annoyances along the way.  Once again, the food was really well cooked, and if I could have left my tip for the kitchen staff instead of the waitress I would have.  They certainly earned it, and she didn't really seem to care.  Also, while our wait times could be expected during a lunch/dinner rush, there were maybe 7 people in the whole restaurant.  It's not like they were busy.  Our waitress was just too preoccupied with chatting with the other servers (in clear view of our table).\n\nIn short, I do not believe we will be dining here again.  We can get the same quality of food for cheaper and with much better service.",1
2263,"Aah, Roland's. I have only been here exactly 4 times, but have never tried the food. My boyfriend and I always just hit the bar for drinks and we've never stayed very long. A trip to Roland's was always because we were in the Strip for another reason and thought, \""Why not?\""\n\nThere is one bartender in particular there who has served us every time and is super awesome. Very friendly, chatty, cool guy. He knows how to pour a good beer and is up to date on what Roland's has or doesn't have and what he can substitute out for you. \n\nThe rooftop and outdoor seating seems really neat, but every time we've gone they've been packed, not surprisingly. Hanging out on their front patio would be a neat people watching spot.",3
2264,"If I had to chose between dining at Roland's again, or having to catch running chainsaws that were tossed at me I'd pick dining at Rolands but only by the slimmest of margins.\n\nWhy on earth did I go back to this restaurant?  Clearly, I must not love myself or something.\n\nWant to pay too much money for fish that smells like a sewer?  Dine at Roland's.  The only reason to be at Rolands is to drink there.  they have a pretty decent beer selection.",1
2265,Stopped in for a pint.  Had some pizza (was OK) and hit another place.,3
2266,"Hey. This place is deeeeeeeeCENT.\n\n(look, check it out for happy hour. 60 cent oysters? uhmfuckyea)\n\nI dislike strip dizzle bars but you could pick worse. Actually, ok. This review is based on going to happy hour. I am down with 60 cent oysters, clams, shrimp, and wings. Average beer selection, but you can find a few gems.",3
2267,Love the lobster roll.  I like to stop in here on Mondays for 0.60C raw oysters and a bloody hoe.  Makes a great after work/pre work-out snack.,3
2268,"we went three for st, patrick day. Two harps bottle beers and 12 oyster costs $40.",2
2269,"There were 3 of us on a beautiful Sunday afternoon. Surprisingly Roland's was 3/4 full. With 3 waitresses. They were RUNNING to fill orders. \nThe fish was hot and crispy. It was fried but it was good. The French fries with it tasted as if they were fried in the same grease or an oil that should've been changed several days ago. \nThe Mussels were OK. \nBut the Clams Casino were inedible. The clams were served raw with a burnt bread crumb topping. The crab cakes were also bad. Both went back.  The waitress never asked if we wanted something else or if the rest of the meals were fine. \nThe New England Clam Chowder was good but overpowered by the smoky bacon that was added to the soup. \nNo, we won't go back..the food was lackluster(better fix at Wholleys) and the service was terrible. It took 20 minutes to get someone to take the bill.",2
2270,"The only reason this gets three stars instead of two is because of the Lobster roll.  Since working in NYC for a few months, I've been on the prowl for a decent Lobster roll in Pittsburgh.  This particular roll is served hot, which isn't what I'm used to.  I was totally skeptical; however, it turned out to be pretty good.  I think the roll, which I believe is from Mancini's, was really good.  The only downfall is that the roll is served with a MOUNTAIN of icky fries.  No thanks.\n\nThe service was borderline terrible.  We sat at the bar, and were ignored for about 15 minutes when we were trying to order.  It wasn't even busy!  The bartender saw us with menus and knew we were getting dinner, but decided the Pens game was more important.  He wasn't helpful or pleasant either.  \n\nThe only reason I'd come back is for the roll.  Besides that, I'd pick anywhere else in the Strip.",3
2271,"Came here with a bunch of friends on a Friday night to watch the pens game. They have a nice atmosphere and relatively good service considering it was dinner time. A few more tvs and a few more tables would give it at least one more star. One strange thing I have to mention is that they did not have any beer specials during happy hour? Not sure if this is normal, but I thought it was weird for a sports bar type restaurant . Although $.60 oysters was nice during happy hour.",3
2272,Poor service. Monday evening. restaurant not busy. Took 15 minutes before someone came to take our drink order. Ordered a draft and a glass of wine and proceeded to order a lobster roll and steamed mussels. Took another 10 minutes to get the drinks. The lobster roll then showed up and we had finished and the plate was then cleared for the table. We had then been in the restaurant for an hour and we asked for the bill. The waitress then proceeded to say the mussels were ready. We canceled the order and the bill came with a quick huff and sign the top copy please request as she quickly turned away. Not worth wasting your time.,2
2273,"Went on a Wednesday night, not crowded at all. Had to get up and go find someone to wait on our table....overheard who was supposed to be our server telling the hostess she didn't wait on us because she didn't want another table. The food was good, lobster roll and fish sandwiches were great. Service was just awful.",2
2274,"Lobster roll was awesome.  There was a Moosehead beer cap in our fries and the waitress' response was, \""That must be from the beer batter.  I will give them hell.\""   I wasn't looking for a free meal but an apology from someone would have been appropriate.",2
2275,"Not as good as Wholeys but awesome patio and the best service. Go here for the atmosphere, the staff is the best.",4
2276,"Prime time location, and they know it.\n\nYet another older guard restaurant that realizes it has people roped in before they know it.  The place looks nice and is possibly the best location during the summer especially in the city.  I have always steered clear of Roland's because of an assumption.  But....the wife and her friend wanted a \""lobster roll\"" so I was roped into going.  I opted to just drink a draught.  They got one of their famous lobster rolls and immediately were underwhelmed.  The sandwich was dwarfed by a mountain of handcut fries (the best part).  It also came with a limp pickle speer and a small condiment cup of coleslaw?!  The roll itself was lobster, but was fishy tasting and had no sauce?!  There was maybe 3ozs of fishy lobster on the roll.....Pathetic.\nService was decent and my draught and few fries got this place the extra star it deserves.\n\nGo to Wholey!!!!",2
2277,"Roland's was recommended by hotel. Service was terrible. Food was cold. Brick oven pizza cold.... Asked to have it reheated , still came back cold. Steak was way over cooked. Never got appetizer we ordered, but was charged for it.  Was not busy but waitress was hard  to find. Would not go back and would not recommend this place to anyone.",1
2278,"Friends warned me not to eat here. Turns out they were GOOD friends. This was just awful, start to finish. Slow (pitiful) service, nasty food ( and we each sprung for the lobster roll -- if you can call it that!) and a generally miserable experience. And this was an early lunch with very few customers around. The only thing remotely redeemable was that we sat on the balcony overlooking Penn avenue and were entertained by the people below. People watching can be a blast. \n\nI wanted a draft beer and was told that \""we don't serve draft beer upstairs\"". What??? There's a bar there!! Are you kidding me?? So water it was and that took a long time to arrive. And without straws - another wait after I had the audacity to ask for them.  The \""lobster rolls\"" arrived and looked mighty meager. That's not a lobster roll!! But I pressed on. As I got it closer to my mouth there was a slight aroma. But press on. The \""lobster\"" was sparse, tough, and flavorless. How often could you say that about lobster??? Exactly!! It must have been harvested years ago and waited for me to show up so it could make its way out of the freezer. At $15 each this falls clearly into the ripoff category.  And trying to get our check? Ridiculous. \n\nI won't be back. Ever.",1
2279,"Decided to try it for dinner as we were walking around the strip.  Good selection of beers too.\n\nStarted with mussels and they were very good.  Sherry butter sauce w lots of garlic.\n\nWe each had the seafood stew for dinner...tried to get beyond the lobster roll which is their signature dish\n\nStew was full of seafood.  Lobster,  clams, mussels, scallops, shrimp.  Good size portion at reasonable price.\n\nSauce was excellent and had just enough of a spice to have a nice tasting after bite but did not drown out the cream, old bay and sherry.\n\nWe will definitely be back.",5
2280,"I love Roland's happy hour! It's for a raw bar rather than the actual bar. 60 cent oysters, clams, cocktail shrimp, and wings. It's good and you can't beat the price. The downfall? The clams i got steamed and they were a little over done, and the oysters were left attached to the shell. But for 60 cents, I can deal with taking them Off myself. As far as service? We sat at the bar, he wasn't very friendly or rude, just meh. But the food came out in a timely manner.",3
2281,I gave this place a 3 star because the service and drinks are great. It's a great place to have a beer with friends  but the food is gross....,3
2282,"Let's see.... Rolands can be fun to go to for happy hour after work on Friday.  Heck they used to have these two bartenders that if you were a good looking girl at least one would give you a beer or two but making up the difference by overcharging or flat out giving incorrect change back to some male patrons.  Anyhow, they have a somewhat unique upstairs and in the summer they have the balcony that you can sit out on.  One summer night it began to storm and one of their umbrellas flew off the base and cracked me in the head.  I though I was going to pass out, but the bartender just came out gathered the pieces and put them back together folding the umbrella down.  Yea no reason to apologize I just could have been decapitated.  \\\nNow onto the food.....uh  well....my best suggestion is, if you are on a timed lunch or have limited time for dinner, PICK SOMEWHERE ELSE!  you will only get frustrated with the SLOW AS HELL service.  Suggestions, hmm not entirely sure since nothing I ate here impressed me much.  The lobster roll, I am certain wasn't \""real\"" lobster and was very rubbery, and dry.  Way too much bun to lobster type meat, and overpriced for a sandwich, $15.00 I think.  Next we got the oysters.  6  were supposed to be in an order but they only delivered 5.  But good luck finding the waitress, she showed up 3x's in the hour and half that we were there for dinner.  Not because it took us an hour and half to eat but 15 minutes to get waited on.  15 more minutes for drinks, and to order.  45 minutes for food to come, and I think you get the picture... I wouldn't eat here again, there are many other places to choose from.  Lastly I ordered a draft beer it was warm, told the waiter who got me a bottle but still charged me for both... NICE...",2
2283,"The bar has a nice selection of beers. The Irish bartender who works Monday nights is extremely welcoming and friendly.  \n\nFor food I tried the raw bar happy hour. The oysters were alright but nothing special. The shrimp were quite small, probably U-20 count which for Shrimp Cocktail is tiny. The wings were very disappointing. Extremely small and flavorless. And finally the steamed clams were CHEWY. \n\nIn recap, come here for the beers and the nice bartenders. The food you can do without.",3
2284,"Service was great, however, the food was mediocre.  Hostess needs to be more educated about the menu, she was unable to give details on menu items.\nLets start the with fries that seem to be mandatory with each entree.  They had to be cooked prior to us ordering, or even getting there.  They were cold, limp (pause) and over salted.  The burger was just eh.  Grilled onions seemed to be just warmed on the grill, and the beef patty could have used a bit more flavor.  Fat has the flavor people!\n\nOh, the floor at our first table was filthy.  Then the table at the second table was filthy.  What's up with that?\n\nOverall, this joint was not that great.",1
2285,"Not bad but not great either.  I tried the lobster roll and the bloody mary which we were informed as we walked in the Roland's was \""famous\"" for.  Both were good but nothing spectacular.  I was also here quite some time ago and remember them having good pizza though.\n\nOne thing to note is that they have a really large selection of beer both on draft and in bottles.",3
2286,We wanted to eat there today. Waited for about 10 minutes at the entrance. No hostess coming up. Then she shows up saying that she will be back in another second. After additional 5 minutes we ask her what's going on. She did not apologize and says that it will take another 30 minutes. Really??!! Not the nice way to treat a party of 4 wanting to spend some money.,1
2287,"Last weekend my mother and I headed down to the strip to get some weekly goods - lunch meat and cheese from Penn Mac - veggies at Stans - needed some new spices from Penzeys for a chili I was going to make that day....we were both a little hungry and knew we wanted to have a snack before shopping.\n\nWe parked in front of Roland's and see the sign: Famous for Lobster Rolls and Bloody Mary's!\n\nPerfect. \n\nMy mother got the Lobster Roll, which she said was 'good'. The bread, from Mancini's, was of course tasty - toasted and buttery - delicious mostly because it was Mancini's bread. I had the Lobster Roll minus the carbs on a salad - and the lobster was tasty, no doubt , I mean, lobster is just - good. For the price though, not sure that I got enough bang for my buck. The salad was something I could have picked up at Get-Go in the pre-made section. I just didn't feel satisfied at the end of my meal. I couldn't even drink my Bloody Mary (this is a rare affair), way too much horseradish, and I often like horseradish in my Bloodies!\n\nAnd it was cold - didn't even take my winter coat off. So, needless to say, not the best experience.\n\nTalk about false advertisement...",1
2288,"Overall, my experience was okay. We sat at the bar and our bartender was very friendly and helpful. We got the scallop appetizer and it was TO DIE FOR! I will 100% go back for that! That being said, it was downhill from there. We got the lobster roll and lobster ravioli...and both were \""ehhh.\"" The lobster roll had a ton of lobster on it (yeah!) but there wasn't any other seasoning or any type of dressing to tie it all together. The lobster  ravioli was the biggest disappointment because it had absolutely NO flavor....I had to grab the salt shaker and even then it barely had a taste. I can't even comment on the lobster inside of the ravioli because the whole thing just tasted like nothing.\n\nI'll go back for the scallops, but wouldn't recommend anything else.",2
2289,"My boyfriend and I visited on a Saturday afternoon. We tried mussels, clam chowder, jumbo shrimp cocktail and a burger.  The mussels were an appetizer portion and were enough for three people. They were perfectly cooked and very sweet.  The shrimp are sold a la carte. I ordered 6 of them, and was a bit let down that 2 of them were a bit dry. The cocktail sauce served with the shrimp had wonderfully spicy horseradish and was perfect.  The New England clam chowder was not overly thick and had lots of clams in it. Lastly, the burger, topped with gorgonzola cheese came with fries and cole slaw and was excellent.  The only reason I give this review 3 stars is because our waiter got overwhelmed by a few large parties and disappeared on us.  We had to flag down the hostess to get our waiter to bring us our check. Other than some dry shrimp, and the service issue, we had an enjoyable dinner.",3
2290,This was my second time eating at Roland's  seafood Grill the first time I had a great experience the food was excellent the service was great even though they were busy we got really good service and everything was really fresh and good this time the food was needless to say very poorly prepared the service what service we got seemed more interested and everybody but the six people setting at our table. It took a couple of tries to get refills on drinks I asked for a cup of water I didn't even get the cup of water the pasta was more like wedding soup my medium stake was almost completely pink all the way through very undercooked my nieces pasta had more onions in it then it had sauce I will never visit this place again!!! It wasn't that busy tonight but we stood there for almost 15 minutes waiting for them to get us a table. I spoke with the manager and explained my concerns to him I just can't see me spending that kind of money for the experience that I had tonight again.,1
2291,"Meh. \n\nClam chowder was big and OK.  Veggie sandwich had great,  greasy, grilled Mancini bread but came with soggy fries and was mediocre overall. \n\nOur waitress told us she was new at least 20 times so she wasn't much help in recommending any dishes. \n\nI probably won't go back again.  For $25 a person,  I can do better elsewhere \n.",2
2292,Rough experience today - had one drink and left. Waited 15-20 minutes for service and it is not busy. When I said something - everyone wanted to blame someone else - waitress couldn't describe beer and didnt iffer to find out or sample it - brought 12 year old son a pop in a little kids cup. Waitress did apologize for cup but it was too late - chose to leave.,1
2293,"I travel quite a bit and always enjoy great food.  I was in town on a business trip and someone recommended Roland's Seafood Grill.  I was seated promptly and given a drink and food menu.  I noticed the beer sampler and thought I would give it a try. I asked the server if I could choose the beers and she said yes.  She went on to explain nearly most of the draft beers I selected were not available as they were having trouble with their taps. \n\nI ordered a flight of beers that arrived after 10 minutes and began tasting them.  They were cold but did not taste fresh.  Next I ordered the famous \""Lobster Roll\"" which comes with fries and slaw.  It took nearly 20 minutes for my food to arrive but looked good at first glance.  The fries were plentiful and hot but greasy.  The lobster roll was served in a large piece of bread that resembled two uncut pieces of Texas toast.  It was buttered and grilled to give it a nice appearance.  The lobster inside was a small amount, cold and tough. The slaw was reasonably good and cold. \n\nThe server came back and I ordered a pint of draft beer.  After nearly another 20 minutes she returned, apologized and explained they were having more problems with their tap system and offered me a bottle of Guinness instead of the draft I ordered.  At this point I politely explained I did not want the bottled version and asked for the check.  \n\nI would be hard pressed to ever return.  With other great restaurant choices in the area I don't understand why anyone would choose to eat at Roland's Seafood Grill.",1
2294,"Stopped in on the Fourth of July for evening cocktail and small meal. From horrible service to terrible seafood...would never return. We waited a very long time for cocktails and order to be taken, when there was little crowd around in the restaurant. Then, our oyster order came out on a plate of water, not ice. They were small and shriveled up and warm. Next, the mussels in white wine sauce....hahahah. Um, no...it was more like garbage sewer sauce. Mussels were freezing COLD. Had to search for a server to get the check, took a long time again. Normally, I would complain right then and there for such terrible food and service but it was one of those days that was going so nicely that complaining about food would just ruin mine and my husband's infrequent night out without kids. I did feel strongly enough to write this review. How can a seafood place serve terrible seafood? I have never given a 0 star review and have worked in the food service industry. This place is terrible. Spend your money somewhere else.",1
2295,"Hit Roland's on a Saturday around lunch. The place was packed but we got a seat in a back bar area which was nice, quiet, and air conditioned. Our server was friendly and working hard.\n\nI ordered the lobster roll. The lobster was drenched in garlic butter and served on a very fresh, thick slice of Mancini's bread. The only complaint was that the lobster itself was a bit dry. If it had been more melt-in-your-mouth, fresh-textured, I'd be singing its praises to anyone who'd listen. Too bad, the other elements were great. \n\nMy mother said she'd had the lobster roll at Roland's a few years ago and she had the exact same experience. \n\nSo c'mon Roland's...you're in the Strip...figure out a way to make that lobster roll PERFECTION.",3
2296,"We (3 in our party) stopped in to Roland's while in the lively and interesting Strip District. We placed our drink and food selections with the waitress. She brought our soups, which luckily had spoons in the huge bowls. All were absolutely delicious. The lobster bisque actually had lots of pieces of lobster and the onion soup rich, beefy taste with lots of onions. The clam chowder had tons of clams and the portion was large enough for a meal!!! Our shrimp appetizers ...fried shrimp and shrimp cooked in a beer broth were excellent. Unfortunately our server had no clue how to actually serve people in a restaurant...we had to ask 3 times for napkins and when they were finally brought to the table, she acted as if she was doing us a Big Favor. Then after our food was brought to the table and we asked multiple times for eating utensils. The first time we asked her we were polite, then asked another server, then when we asked at the hostess stand we were told \""oh we told your waitress to bring them\"". When she finally brought them to our table she said \""if you had asked nicely I would have brought them sooner\"". Can you believe that!!! The floor manager came over and while he apologized, also made excuses for her confrontational behavior. \n5 stars for food and food prep, 0 stars for rude service or lack of service.",2
2297,"I have been to Rolands a few times and have not experienced any of the problems others are saying they have, however, I'm only giving 2 stars because you're in the strip-you can do better than Rolands! I was most recently at Rolands during the steeler season last year. I ordered the crab chowder which I have had every time I have been there and each time it has been excellent. On this most recent visit I ordered the raspberry maple scallop appetizer as my meal. It was a large portion;I could not finish it and my fellow diners were too stuffed to help me. One member of my group ordered the seafood pizza and crushed it-said it was so tasty. My other fellow diner order the stuffed banana pepper app and also said it was good. They have a wide draft selection and if you get there early enough you can grab a seat near the tvs. The bar is usually too crowded to grab a seat at but our service at our table was attentive and quick. On a previous visit, I split a margarita pizza and it was good too so there is a variety of entrees/apps etc to choose from to please any palate.",2
2298,"Poor excuse for seafood!   The place is overrated.  Good place to have drinks on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon-but that's about it.  The employees are anything but friendly. Unless you sit at the bar, the service is poor. Isn't even that great at the bar.  If you want good seafood, go a couple blocks up the street to Luke Wholeys.  So much better quality!  This place is definitely not for those with sophisticated palates!",2
2299,"The wait staff looked like they were bussed in from a homeless shelter. The strange hostesses seated my party of 4, & it took 25 minutes to get our first beers. Ordered an app & left 25 minutes later, the lobster nachos never came, which sucked because I was quote excited about those. The place is gross! There was food & trash all over the floor & I watched several women exit the restroom with very disgusted looks on there face because the restroom was so nasty. This was confirmed by my wife. Skip this place & go anywhere else in the Strip District",1
2300,We figured we'd give it a try even though the reviews weren't great.  Brother in law enjoyed his wings and the beer wasn't bad.  Bartender was helpful.,3
2301,"I liked the bar.   The food not at all. First time here, wife and I sat at the bar and people watched over some WELL POURED drinks.   Strong point.  Then we screwed up and ordered food.   I got their infamous lobster roll.  Glad I had a drink.  Overcooked and dry, dry, dry. I thought lobster roll was generally made with a lobster salad-like mix.  This lobster was dry and chewy.  Lots of it, though  I guess that accounts for the high price.   I went down to Wholeys and got a much tastier one for 5 bucks.  And wife's nachos were just a big pile of chips with some toppings thrown on the top.  Then the other day,  we went back and I tried pizza.  Yuck.  The toppings were terrible (pepperoni, sausage.  how can youscrew that up, but they did.)  Two slices and boxed it up so as not to hurt the waitress' feelings.  But it went into the trashcan down the street.  Go for the hootch and not the food!!",2
2302,"Super disappointed in this place. Came here for a paint nite they were hosting and arrived over an hour beforehand to eat. All I ordered was soup and salad in order to be quick and my friends who ordered a lobster roll and shrimp got their food within 20 minutes. 40 minutes later, and ten minutes prior to painting I still had not received mine. On top of that, there was only one bartender working the whole top floor. When we told him I'd have to cancel my order to begin the event he began cursing about the staff at the restaurant- it was incredibly awkward. When the food arrived it was mediocre at best. Will not be coming back to this place unless I'm dragged.",1
2303,"Went there Saturday November29, 2014. Entered establishment at 5:30 pm. PROS.....Very good clam chowder...biggest bowl of it I've ever been served. Sandwiches... 2 lobster rolls and 1 fish sandwich.....Both very good, although the fish was slightly overcooked. Again...huge portions.   CONS...After being at table since 5:30, nothing but our empty pop glasses were in front if us. After being told said clam chowder was being freshly cooked, 15 minutes later it was served. As good as it was, it certainly wasn't hot enough to claim it just came out if the pot. Our sandwiches finally came out after other tables around who had ordered well after us received our orders. They may also want to schedule a couple more servers on a Saturday night. The best though was the incompetent hostess. The hostess with the leastest. Talk about someone who didn't have a clue. From screwing up where we were supposed to sit, to watching her continue to do the same thing with others, at least it gave us something to talk about while we waited. What a twit.",2
2304,"Stopped in last night because we wanted to 'step out' of our usual places on Carson St.  The place was rather busy and was pleasantly warm on a cold Saturday night.  We found seats at the bar and a friendly bartender greeted us and took our drink order.  The drafts arrived right away and we requested menu's...  \n\nWe ordered 2 shrimp cocktails and a calamari.  The shrimp arrived within 5 minutes and came with a small bowl of cocktail sauce with a dollop of horseradish on top.  I mixed mine as I love horseradish but my friend would have preferred it on the side or in another bowl as he isn't a fan.  The shrimp were big and fresh and delicious.  I mean- can you really mess up cold shrimp...?  The calamari took over a half hour to arrive.  It was pleasing to the eye and smelled delicious.  It had grilled onions & peppers on it with a slight spice dusted on top.  I thought it was delicious but my wife wasn't digging it.  She thought it was overcooked & rubbery.  Our friend isn't a fan of calamari so we didn't have a 3rd opinion to be the deciding factor...\n\nThen things went south...\nMy wife went into the ladies room and came out with a straight up disgusted look on her face.  I saw her stop a waitress and after the 'chat' the waitress turned away and rolled her eyes.  Well, my wife said the bathroom was disgusting- Toilet paper & paper towels all over the floor, 5 stalls with only a half roll of toilet paper to be shared between all 5, no paper towels to dry your hands off after you washed them.  Does the employees have a separate washroom to use or do they use this one also and just don't notice???  The health dept signs say \""Employees must wash & dry hands with soap & hot water\"".  Then I visited the Men's room and found almost the same thing- paper all over the floor in the stalls, I didn't notice if they had tp in there, and no paper towels to dry your hands with.  \n\nTo us- the bathrooms must be clean & well stocked or we wonder what the kitchen & other 'back of house' areas look like.  If the bathrooms are in this much need of attention- the kitchen must be worse...  \n\nWe paid our tab and left...",3
2305,I would give them ZERO stars if it were an option. No one came to wait on us. I had to ask the hostess to send us a waiter. We'll call him Mr. Personality because he never did tell us his name. I should have known we were in trouble when he didn't bother to write down our order. My Caesar salad came without the requested onions. My grilled salmon was overcooked. The vegetables were bland. The waiter took away my half-empty glass of ginger ale and filled it with water. He never offered us dessert. The rest rooms were filthy. I would never recommend this place to anyone.,1
2306,"Usually I really like this place.  Stopped in after not eating all day, and ordered the \""famous\"" lobster roll.  It took 40  minutes to receive a medium piece of lobster claw on thick Mancino toast.  THATS IT!  Oh and less than stellar fries, with a cup of cole slaw.  I waited with an empty pint glass several times as well...I guess you can't get it right every time.",2
2307,"Not bad.  Not great.  But not bad.   Excellent bang for your buck, especially if you're hungry.",3
2308,"Came here for lunch and unfortunately spent about 2 hours here because the kitchen was backed up.  Luckily for us we had the time to spare.  Came down to the strip to pick up some stuff for Christmas Eve party and ended here  for some lunch.  I got the lobster roll and it was delicious.  The roll was practically soaked in butter, so that could be an improvement but the lobster meal was great and warm.  They also have a great lobster bisque as well that I'm sure is made from pure cream.  My wife had the crab cake sandwich, and was only mediocre.  It wasn't crispy and bland.  I would come back here again but would so for the lobster roll.  The waiter was great and attentive but the food did take FOREVER to come out.  He did warn us of this and I don't blame him one bit.",3
2309,"Terrible tuxedo rentals! I went here 2 months before my good friend's wedding to get sized and order my tuxedo. The salesman who measured me did not know what he was doing, continued to ask someone else if he was 'doing it right' and made me extremely uncomfortable. At the moment I wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt that he would get it right. When I picked it up, it did not fit!! They go through a third party and did not have an easy way to remedy the situation. They had to ship a replacement to where I was going since it was an out of town wedding. I had to return it to another Jos. A Bank store because I did not want to go back to the RPM location to see the guy that fit me originally. When I returned I wanted to see what they could do for my extreme amount of inconvenience and they hassled me when I wanted a refund! I was going to use them for my bridal party tuxedos next year, but no way now. All the employees there just said they go through a third party so its no wonder their rentals are not easier! Ha! POOR EXCUSE FOR A GENTLEMAN'S STORE. Oh, and its very very expensive!\n\nHowever, Jack from the RPM store was very kind and helped to make a bad situation better.",1
2310,"If you're a coffee drinker, this is the spot for you. I believe in freedom of choice, and i'll defend with my life your right to choose. But if you're going to drink coffee, drink coffee, not the flavored foo-foo stuff.\n\nMy first visit here was before Yelp was just a glint in it's founder's father's eye. And i listened as an old man (The founder?) was telling me about the old days, and how many men died when coffee roasters would catch fire and explode. Not sure how true those stories were, but hey, he was an old man, and I was fresh out of college. Like most college students my common sense eventually came back, but that's another story.\n\nWell he took me back and showed me the raw beans, and how they roasted them. It was very interesting. Then he made me a cup of coffee with bean just out of the roaster, slightly cooled, he ground them in front of me, then put them in a french press and let it steep for 4 minutes. Damn, that was the best cup of Joe I ever had. So the very next day I bought a french press, went back to Nicholas Coffee, and bought a pound of espresso roast and I've been hooked every since.\n\nThere are many places to get coffee in this city, but this place is the tops on my list!",4
2311,"With the return of nice weather to the'Burgh, I've been able to get out on lunch and do some shopping.  I took a stroll down here 'cos it felt good to get out of the office and besides, I'm getting a little tired of the coffee from Giant Eagle.  Maxwell House and Folger's are okay, but soemtimes we need a little variety.\n\nSo I picked up some Olde Vienna which is a little darker than most American roasts, but not as dark as French Roast.  I also picked up a nice Kenya AA blend.  But I'm also become a tea lover and I picked up some Stash Decaffeinated Earl Grey--makes a great ice tea!  Great coffee and service here.  It's been a few years since I was here last and I'm gonna have to stop by more often.",5
2312,"I am not a coffee person, at all - still, I have to admit, this place has a nice feel to it and is so cheap that it's probably just a step or two below nirvana for coffee drinkers.\n\nTwo things make me remember a shop where I can't drink 99% of what's sold. One, the people who work here are really nice; I hadn't visited this shop in months and they still gave me a big hello when they saw my face again recently. Two, I can appreciate a nice set-up when I see one, too, and the entire shop is just filled to the brim with shelves and shelves of jars and more jars, each filled with another kind of coffee bean - needless to say, coffee lovers, give yourself time to browse!\n\nBut I already said I'm not a coffee person - so what in the world am I even doing in this place, you ask? Well, the shop also carries a couple candy and chocolate options, has a mini-fridge with cold beverages, and has a(n admittedly small, especially compared to the rest of the shop) selection of tea available behind the main register.\n\nI wouldn't say it's my favorite place in the world; my cup of tea seemed pretty weak compared to other places I've visited. \n\nStill, it was far, far cheaper than other places, so I guess I can honestly say I got what I paid for: nothing spectacular but nothing awful, either.",3
2313,"The first part in realizing that you have a problem is to admit it, well I have a coffee addiction. This place makes it very easy to feed my cravings by having a huge selection of regular and decaf coffees. I also think that the prices are reasonable and the staff is a lot of fun. I thank them for searching high and low when I request some coffees that may not be their biggest seller but I want to try. Stop in coffee lovers you will not be disappointed.",5
2314,"Great coffee and Tea selection.  Good prices for latte's, cappuccino, ect...",4
2315,"I gave it a second shot. Much better. See the taste review below. \n\nWhen it comes to coffee places, you know what you will get at a place like Starbucks or Crazy Mocha, but finding a local spot just adds to the overall experience that the previous two cannot provide. As far as local Pittsburgh coffee spots go, so far this is at the middle if the pack but worth visiting in downtown. Especially since it is in market square. I am a sucker for history and want to try Nicholas's again. There is a large selection of coffee, for boutique type prices for some. The daily coffee my second time was much better but still if you have been in existence since 1919 I would expect a great product, or one that is different from all the rest due to your almost 100 years. \n\nThe 5 senses review:\n\nSight: 8-the main saving grace. It is really cool, quaint, and charming. This is where the history helps. \n\nSmell: 6-just like other coffee places it is always nice to walk in and get nailed with the aroma of the brewed and ground beans. \n\nTaste: 6- UPDATED! Much better coffee of the day. So lesson learned. Get a \""coffee of the day\"" at your own risk. \n\nSound: 3-remember a low number is good. Nice and relaxed with the just the sounds of a working coffee shop. No over powering shitty music, thankfully!\n\nTouch: 2-only because you aren't really using your hands for anything. I did get a biscotti there which was very good. So since I used my hands I need to add some rating.",3
2316,"I knew it was going to be a fail as I watched the 'Barista' slopping together a latte for the customer in front of me.  I ordered a coffee of the day instead--meh, I've had better.  My wife got a soy latte:  he dumped the milk in, without technique, and over-heated the milk.  It was a watery, soppy mess.  \n\nWe want Nicholas to be great--or now, better.  Train the staff!",2
2317,"This hidden gem, tucked away in the corner of Market Square in downtown Pittsburgh, offers more than just coffee.  Sure, it's easy to be lazy and unadventurous and go to Dunkin Donuts or Starbucks, but why not take a chance and support a Pittsburgh staple since the 1800s?  They must be doing something right to stay around that long.  They also roast their beans in-house...in Market Square.  Amazing.\n\nNicholas Coffee Co. has a unique ambiance.  I'd say it's vintage bookstore chic, but your opinion and description may differ.  With a HUGE selection of coffee, fresh baked goods from local vendors,  friendly staff, and a humidor for the casual cigar aficionado, there's a little something for everyone.  \n\nThe coffee by the cup is very reasonably priced, and you can buy coffee in bulk, or buy a few sample packs to find your favorite brew before buying by the pound.",4
2318,"I'd heard good reviews, so I stopped in last time I was downtown, but I'm not impressed by their coffee. Dark roasted, bitter, etc. If I'm looking for coffee downtown, I'd go find that 21st St. Coffee branch instead. Still, they sell a bunch of other neat snacks and stuff, and it beats a chain.",2
2319,"The owner, Nicholas G Nicholas needs to attend a few driving classes before he kills someone. Maybe too much hp for him. If you see an 08 white porsche with FL plate 917 MNC stay clear. Guy drives like a nut. Almost ran me off the road in Boca Raton by 95.",1
2320,"This place is the ultimate two star. If you have a craving for a cheap gyro downtown at night in Pittsburgh, this is the place to go. Unfortunately, Mike & Tony's closes by 6pm. You won't get good service, you will get frozen french fries tossed in the deep fryer served in disappointingly small portions. You will have to scrounge around for a bottle of ketchup and hot sauce. However, the gyro meat is freshly cut off the spit, and the over-stuffed sandwich is a good deal at $4.30. \n\nOverall, there aren't that many cheap places open at night downtown, so go here if you're stranded and can't stand the thought of another Sammy's corned beef sandwich. Otherwise, hold out for one of downtown's great lunch spots.",2
2321,"I can't believe this place got a bad rating!!! Sure, it's not a 5-star restaurant, but you can't beat the price or the food!!!\nWhy would you order french fries at a Greek restaurant? I want everyone to disregard the previous bad rating about this place. \nI live about a block away from Salonika's, and I absolutely love it. The first time I went in, I noticed that it was rockin while every restaurant nearby was empty. Very good sign, trust me!!\nSure, there are no waiters. You order at the front counter and linger around until your food is ready, but I've never had to wait more than a few minutes. \nThe food is absolutely amazing!!! And cheap!!! My boyfriend loves the chicken with pasta, which is exactly what it says it is: pasta with chunks of chicken. It is lightly seasoned, but no heavy sauces. And it's amazingly filling. \nI always get the Greek salad or the pastitsio. The greek salad comes loaded with onions, feta, olives, and jalapeno peppers that are marinated in some kind of garlic marinade. And there is always enough dressing!!! Homemade dressing at that. \nThe pastitsio is definitely an acquired taste. It's like a greek lasagne, but without cheese. It consists of a large layer of very spiced beef, then layers of noodles and a cream sauce. \nI bring a lot of friends to Salonika's when they trek downtown to hang-out with me, and EVERY SINGLE PERSON I have introduced to this place absolutely LOVES IT!!! I usually make them get a gyro, and I can't tell you how many of my friends will go back up for another one because they are so good. The gyro meat is fresh, in fact they carve it right there. \nThere is also a bar in the back of the restaurant. I kind of wish it wasn't there because it attracts some \""unsavories\"" and takes away from the atmosphere in the restaurant. But you can't win them all.\nKeep in mind that this is a cash-only establishment, so hit the ATM on the way. \nYou will not be disappointed with this place. This place is really a gem!!!",5
2322,"Decent gyros, but it is kind of a dive in the middle of Pittsburgh.",3
2323,"You get what you pay for. Cheap gyro combo = cheap tasting meal. When stepping into the restaurant the first thing I noticed were glass cases storing food. It had the feel of a cafeteria or at best a deli at a gas station convenient store. Not feeling adventurous I got the gyro meal, which is a good deal. The fries were cooked to perfection, but lacked flavor. I had to dump salt on them, which is never a good thing unless you as for unsalted fries. The gyro itself was mediocre. The ingredients inside were fresh and made to order, but I did have to use a knife and fork to eat it as the pita was just a bit too small of the large mass of the contents. The slice of chocolate cake, while a descent size, was rather tasteless. The icing was pretty good, but the cake itself had almost no flavor, perhaps freezer burn. It did seem as if the cake had been frozen. I also felt like the harried girl taking orders behind the counter was overworked. She apparently had no time to take a wet cloth the the tables. I kind of felt bad for her. \n\nOverall, I'd go here if I worked a block away and only had a half hour lunch break. Quick and cheap as a fast food joint, but not delicious enough as a dinner.",2
2324,"I would never get another gyro from Salonika's the meat on my gyros are always cold...however I do enjoy thier bar, I go to salonika's 3 nights a week for an after work drink.  The staff is very friendly and they keep the place clean.",3
2325,"Fairly decent gyro for the price. The other reviewers are spot on with the pita being too small...I appreciate the amount of meat and filling, but it was impossible to eat by hand. Tzatiki sauce was tasty and the added onions and peppers were a nice touch. Nothing mind blowing but it hit the spot when I stopped for a quick snack.\n\nDid not investigate the bathroom here.",3
2326,"my falafel was ok, but my brother kabob was really good. great location. reasonable price",3
2327,"I have eaten at Salonikas on 6th St. over a dozen times over the past three years.  I would eat here more often if it was more convenient.  To me, the gyro here is the best in Pittsburgh.  Better than ANY other.  Until someone can point me at a Gyro place that makes them like they do in some of the larger cities in the U.S., or like in Greece or Turkey, where they hand make the meat on a spit, it is lamb sliced thin, and placed in layers on a skewer, then slow roasted, and sliced and served while you watch, then Salonikas will remain the best.  \n\nSeriously, every single Gyro place around here just buys that big round slab of processed meat, and puts it on a spinner. Folks that say \""Oh it is seasoned so perfectly at XXXX\"" are nuts.  No place around here makes their own lamb gyro meat. If you know of one, put it down, I want to go there.\n\nI like Salonikas because I like the pita, it is nice and thick and chewy, and they fry it on the flat top.  Places that don't heat the pita (like that place on the Strip that sells Gyros for $5 and he don't even heat the pita?!?!) They STINK!  \n\nI like the tszaziki (however you spell it).  It is nice and thick and well seasoned.  It does not go running down your arm when you take a big honking bite of your gyro.  \n\nI like the meat, it is seasoned so perfectly!  (!?!?!) Actually, they cook it long enough to make it a bit crusty, and they slice it nice and thin.  And they put on a LOT of it.  \n\nAnd all the veg is just right.  I wish they used hotter onions, but oh well.\n\nAnd best of all, they have a bar, that is VERY fairly priced.  Especially considering it is located so near the theatre district.  I also absolutely like all the other stuff they have, the spanakopata, and the moussaka, and the grape leaves.  Pretty much anything they sell.\n\nAnd keep this in mind, this place is inexpensive.  I mean seriously, the negative reviews this place gets all seem to say \""the prices are cheap, and tastes it\"".  Well, bull.  The food is inexpensive, and what you get for what they charge, is way above what you expect.  Like, instead of ground lamb in some dishes, you get ground beef.  Still tastes good to me.  Not as great as it would be with ground lamb, but it keeps the price down, and it still tastes good.\n\nMy favorite time to eat here?  New Years eve, or Pittsburgh Light Up Night.  I have been here every one of those the past three years, they are packed, you get to have a gyro and a beer.  It is just a nice fun time.  And considering how busy they are, the staff are all way happier that at some of those pinky-in-the-air joiunts in the theatre district.\n\nOh, and the customers are all friendly.  Nice mix of blue collar and cops and folks getting a bite before or after some event in the cultural district.  I REALLLY like this place.  \n\nNow, next reviewer who throws down some ignorant review about how some other gyro is better, first, is it a REAL gyro, made with REAL thin sliced lamb, slow cooked on a spit and sliced off fresh and juicy, then PLEASE put the name of the place in your review.  I have tried EVERY gyro spot in the city, and quite a few outside it.  And I am STILL looking for a REAL gyro made like that.  Until then, this place is the best for me.",4
2328,"The food can be somewhat disappointing but will sometimes do in a pinch.  The service is quick and the prices are reasonable for Downtown.  They are open late hours, so sometimes that can be handy.  There are better places for Greek food, but Salonika's is often close by.",2
2329,"I like Salonika's.  I've been here a few times over the last couple months, and the food is consistently good.\n\nSome of the winning dishes are the baked chicken, chicken gyros, and definitely the lemon potatoes.  The salmon in pastry shell is also very good.\n\nThe staff is rushed but efficient.  Given how busy they can be, they get you in and out.\n\nEven when other lunch places are empty, you'll still find a restaurant full at Salonika's.  Part of it is the prices, which are reasonable. Part of it is that the food is mostly ready to serve, so it's fast.\n\nBut overall, the quality of the food is what keeps bringing me back, anyways.",4
2330,"Went here before the regatta yesterday, was my third time here...consistently great, best gyros around!! Thanks.",4
2331,"Great food, fast service and the price is right. Perfect stop for a quick lunch in the downtown area.",4
2332,This place has one of the best Gyro's around..... They are cheap and Delicious......  The only thing I wish was that they took credit/debit cards.  If you want something that is fast and well worth the money I would recommend this place..... I have come downtown just to eat here. LOVE LOVE LOVE the GYROS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,5
2333,"I love this place. Gyros, spinach pie, fries and hummus. Way better than any other gyro place in Pittsburgh.",5
2334,"I was running out of time today at lunch and needed somewhere to grab lunch. On a positive note, i seen the Google street view car downtown :)\n\nAnyways, my gyro just wasnt that good. It seemed smaller than any other gyro in town, the fries were just frozen potatoes with no flavor and it just wasn't a very awesome experience.\n\nAlso, almost $9 for a small gyro, frozen fries & a small drink is not a \""deal\"". M&Ts is $7.50- same fries of course  but a large, delicious gyro.  I dunno, I've heard great things about this place but i'll stick with my regular oll Zorba's for downtown or M&Ts afterhours.",2
2335,"We were in the mood for gyros and decided to try a place we had never been to. The restaurant has been there for years but we normally go to Mike & Tony's for gyros. We both ordered the Gyro Special for $8.88. You get a gyro, fries, and a drink. \nThe portions were smaller than we normally get at other gyro places. The fries could have been cooked a minute or two longer. We had to add salt. The pita on the gyro was small and soft. I was worried it was going to tear or break but it didn't. The gyro meat was okay but not as flavorful as other places I've eaten. The sauce didn't hold much flavor either and was a little watery. \nThough I wasn't impressed, nor would I go back for the gyros, I would go back to try some of the other items on their menu. They had a baked Greek chicken with lemon potatoes that seemed to be selling more than the gyros were. I think I need to take a group there and have everyone order something different so we could try more of their menu.",3
2336,This place has amazing homemade crab bisque soup! My turkey sandwich was good too. Quick and loved the friendly staff.,3
2337,"Just got a small, pre-made chicken salad sandwich and a cup of chicken chili from the Fifth Avenue store, and paid over $9. You can get much better quality and value elsewhere in Pittsburgh.",2
2338,"Sorry, but I stopped in this morning to get my lunch because I knew I would be too busy to go out for lunch.  Got a Greek Salad.  First of all, there was no lid on the salad, it was wrapped in plastic wrap... What??? Anybody could put anything in there without too much trouble.  Second when I went to eat it, I threw most of it away because the lettuce was brown and/or wilted.  Not going back again.  I didn't spend all that money for garbage.",1
2339,"It's hard to be drawn to this place when its in the recently updated market square but don't let the looks fool you, this place is delicious.\n\nI tried Primanti the day before and I wish I went to La Gondola first. This place had good pizza and service was decent. This place has been family-owned for over 30 years and its apparent why.\n\nI wasn't please with the sausage because it was essentially like in small bits and amounts, but the thin crust was baked just right and the cheese was good as well.\n\nThere were no napkins and too much grease on the pizza. No bathroom in site either. I wanted to wash my hands. \n\nBest food I had in Pittsburgh besides the William Penn Omni Terrace Room.\n\nNext year when I am on a business trip to Pittsburgh I will most likely return.",3
2340,"One of my absolute favorite places to eat in Pittsburgh.  The meals are a little bit more expensive than you normally want to eat as a student (I probably spend $20-25 with appetizer and dessert), but the food makes this hole-in-the-wall truly worth a trip.\n\nChristo is the owner of the restaurant and was at one time employed upon the Onassis yacht.  Years ago when I first came to his restaurant, he was the head waiter on a staff of one.  More recently when I have gone, there have been other hired waiters.  The service isn't great, but it's not terrible either.\n\nThe food offerings include standard middle eastern fare: hummus, baba ghanouj, phyllo-dough wrapped pockets, and kabobs.  The desserts also include standard middle eastern desserts like baklava and strong coffees, but the signature dessert is the Onassis dessert, a syrup-soaked cake topped with custard and whipped cream, dusted with cinnamon.  The last time I was there, he had added a chocolate Onassis dessert, which was also excellent.\n\nMy normal meal there consists of baba ghanouj (which is about the best I've ever had....it's a real hit-or-miss dish, and Christo's knocks it out of the park), a combination (lamb & chicken) kabob, and the Onassis dessert.\n\nIt's out of the way, but well worth a trip!",5
2341,"Went for lunch, the hummus was good, i had the eggplant which was awfully bland even with a nice tomato sauce.  no beer with lunch though (bogus!)",3
2342,"This place was really busy when we arrived so it seemed promising. Some of the food was good and others were sub-par.\n\nTwo of us ate the gyro platter which comes with: \nhummus (watery) \npita (store bought) \ngyro meat (I've never had gyro meat like this before, it was ultra thin and had a rubbery texture - also the portion was so small) \nGreek salad (iceberg with sparse toppings and too much dressing) \ngrape leaves (vegetarian but quite good) \nand rice (actually this was the tastiest thing on the platter - it had a nice lemon and chicken broth flavor). \n\nOverall the food was hit or miss. The most disappointing were the pita and the gyro meat. My companion had the salmon and said it was unremarkable. I think diners come for the cake which was eaten by almost every person in the joint. \n\nI also have to agree with some of the other reviewers, this place is disgustingly dirty. All patrons walk through the kitchen to use the bathroom which was really gross. The kitchen was not clean and our waiter had food on his hands when he served us. \n\nEven homemade wine and honey soaked cake won't bring me back again.",2
2343,Light Up Night.  Food has good flavor but doesn't look so hot.  If I hear about the Jackie O desert one more time I'm gonna barf.,2
2344,"3.5 Stars\n\nChristos is a sort of charmingly run-down sort of place, particularly given that many of the other offerings in the Cultural District are pretty new joints.  The food is better than average.  Having just eaten at DC's supposedly cheapest and best Greek restaurant the week I was in Pittsburgh, I found the food to be more authentic, better seasoned, fresher and definitely cheaper.\n\nWe had a group of 10 on a Sunday night.  The restaurant owner/manager/old Greek guy came out onto the sidewalk as we were walking by and practically begged us to come in.\n\nI had a grilled fish dish that was nicely cooked along with a glass of the house red wine.  At the end of our meals we decided we had to try the famous \""Jackie O cake,\"" which was, sad to say, nothing particularly special.\n\nBest of all, we had no problems splitting the check multiple ways when it came time to leave.",4
2345,"We love eating at Christos and have many times in the past............however, I can't help feeling taken advantage of this summer on more than one occasion.  We love the simpleness of the place -- in fact it reminds me of Nana's kitchen growing up - NO frills - lots of love and yummy things to eat.\n\nThere is a particular st lye that I do not enjoy and that is the constant offers of this and that and they make it look like hummus and pita are complimentary as well as salads being included.  By the time one receives the bill -- EEKE! I could have eaten at a more upscale place.\n\nThat's all I have to say -- don't enjoy feeling hustled -- not sure if we will continue to dine there when there is a place right across the street with less charm but yummy food.",3
2346,"Dirty, unclean, my friend and I went to lunch here.  She went to go to the bathroom. Upon returning to the table had the following story to tell.  \n\nTo get to the bathroom she had to go through the kitchen and down a flight a stairs.\n\n When passing through the kitchen she saw raw chicken left out in the heat congealing in it's own blood. \n\n Christos you get no second chances after a stunt like that.  The food was tasty, but come on now chicken chillen on the counter is a no go in anyone's kitchen.",1
2347,"This can be summed up as follows: For Greek food, go to Salonika directly across the street. \nThis place is below par in just about every way. The prices are not high, but the servers seem more like salesmen in pressuring you to add dessert, etc. (At lunch?). I haven't been impressed by the food after numerous tries, and the atmosphere is dated and dingy. \nI would much rather go across the street at a place with no pretensions (counter service) and pay for honest food that I can see being prepared.",2
2348,"The food was clearly microwaved (ie the ring around the soup bowl and splatters along the sides). The fish was rubbery. The wait staff, although nice, was very salesy always trying to \""add on\"" something in a pushy way. \n\nI asked for my check and barely ate anything. I think the waiter got his ego bruised because he decided to display his \""Best In City\"" award right behind my head as I was still sitting at the table... a shame the award was from 2005! I guess a lot changed in 7 years?\n\nDon't bother with this place!",1
2349,"I crave the Jackie O cake, a must have!!!!",3
2350,"Descriptive phrase: classic Greek.\n\nChristos is unassuming, but good. Katie K., her sister, and I were wandering around downtown Pittsburgh on a Sunday night and many other things were closed. We stopped briefly to look at the menu that was laid on a table outside, and a nice old man came right out and invited us in. So we followed him.\n\nIt's a cramped little space, made even more so by the insane amount of Greek relics/touristy items everywhere. Even on a Sunday night, though, the place had a good and varied crowd ranging from teens to families to old men hanging around.\n\nOur waiter, who I found out later was the owner, was odd in a fantastic way. He just was bright and quick, and obviously loved his lot in life.\n\nWe started with the Hummus ($4) which came with fresh, hot pita bread. The bread was great, but I didn't enjoy the hummus (too bland). We each had a glass of the house wine (red and white) (~$3?) which were delicious. I ordered the Lamb Kebab ($12.95) which came with some grilled veggies and rice pilaf on the plate but also included a soup/salad. I loved the soup. LOVED it. It was a milky broth with rice. Sounds odd, but perfect for me as I was getting over a cold, and went well with the pita bread from before. The grilled veggies were good, and I really liked the rice pilaf. The lamb kebab was not bad, but Katie K's was so tough she didn't eat much of it. I did not have the same problem, though we'd order the chicken next time.\n\nWe finished the night with Baklava ($3) and the famous Onassis Dessert ($3). The owner regaled the entire place with the story of how he worked on the Jackie O yacht for years and this was her favorite dessert. Goodness, I can understand why. It looks like a simple slice of vanilla cake but it's so much more, with a honey syrup and whipped cream with cinnamon. I want it. I want it now.\n\nOverall, it was a 3-star kind of place. Good but not great. The dessert and wine were top notch, but it lost points on the main entree and the price (which I thought would be reasonable but topped out at $25 a person with tip!). Christos' saving grace is its ambience and staff. Check it out if you have the time.",3
2351,"Christos was one of the worst experiences I've ever had while dining in Pittsburgh. They call this a Greek restaurant but they don't even have a normal gyro on the menu. My boyfriend and I decided to split the platter, which was horrible. The gyro meat wasn't off the spick, the dolmades were the worst thing ever eaten in my life and they charged us 4.00 to split it which we didn't even ask for in the first place. The only pleasant thing about this place was the cook who ended up serving us our food after our waiter went out for what seemed like a drug deal. Over all, everything was bad and I would never return and would advice everyone else to do the same.",1
2352,"We were downtown looking for some place to eat before the show when I man standing outside showed us a menu. Boy, we were not the least disappointed. After hummus and pita chips, we all started off with an excellent very tasty fresh salad. The leg of lamb of excellent as was the sides of grilled vegetable and rice. I don't usually like hummus but it was tasty and excellent. The Jackie O cake is to die for.  We agree that the waiter were sort of odd, but in a very good way. Excellent prices. Homemade wine was also excellent.",5
2353,"This is a lovely Greek restaurant  that my husband and I just happened upon while walking downtown looking for a suitable venue to dine and drink, being tourists still and not yet quite moved to the area.  \n\nWe had already been in one restaurant in which the wine prices were through the roof and had looked over several other menus tacked on the outside of some other restaurants.  Then, lo, and behold, Monica, I'm assuming one of the restaurant owners, walked up to us on the sidewalk menu in hand convincing us to come try her restaurant just a few strides away. And convincing she was.  \""Why not?\"" we both thought.  She did such a good job giving us a sales pitch, we thought her restaurant deserved a chance tonight.  \n\nWe were ushered inside the small venue to a table very near another couple just finishing dessert and asked about their experience.  The fact that they were happy being there and the fact that there were other patrons was a positive start.  I was so afraid we were going to be ushered into an empty place begging for business but, not so.  There was a steady stream of clientele, most due to Monica's steady persuasion, I'm sure.  \n\nWe started with hummus and pita and a glass each of Greek white and red wine.  Then we ordered lamb and chicken kabob combo and some other greek dishes which came with a decent salad and a side.  Finally, we had to order dessert, knowing full well it would be home made.  The guests nearest us had ordered the Jackie O (as in Onasis) cake and another pastry, which is what Monica recommended to us so that's what we ordered.  It was all pretty good, not stellar, but pretty darned good.  I've definitely had more flavorful kabobs but I did appreciate the family home cooking aspect.   The wine was ok but would rather have ordered off a wine list.  The salad was a nice size and was good.  The Jackie O cake was light and moist -- a hit.  \n\nOne point to know that has been mentioned in other reviews:  the main meal looks to be inexpensive but it will add up quickly.  Everytime Monica looks at you with smiling eyes and asks if you'd like some wine, then ask if you want another glass, or do you want some hummus, and finally if you'd like dessert, you really want to say \""yes\"" as if you're at your favorite aunt's house.  But, of course, each of these items comes with a price which you're glad to pay at the end of the meal because of your gracious host's manners and offerings.\n\nI swear that Monica has the best work ethic I've seen in a long time.  From the moment she saw us on the sidewalk, she was in motion from ushering us in, to seating us, to taking our order, to presenting our order, to refilling our water, to cleaning tables next to us, to flagging down more clientele, to making sure we and other clients were satisfied with their meals, to taking our payment.  \n\nOne small humorous note as other reviewers have pointed out:  Ask for directions to the restroom and you'll be ushered through the kitchen, saying hello to the dishwasher and the cook, down the stairs.  I've never experienced that before (probably for good reasons).  But, it was humorous.",3
2354,"WARNING. DO NOT GO HERE.\n\nMy family was visiting my sister in Pittsburgh and we had our eyes set on a specific restaurant, not Christos. A gentleman, I presume the owner of Christos, saw my family and I as we walked down the street. He flashed us his menu, pitching to us why his restaurant was the best and why his food was the best. I could barely tell if he was selling food or used cars. I kindly told him we were not interested. My family, however, was indecisive when it came to getting a restaurant. We ending up wanting to go eat at the restaurant next door to Christos so we backtracked. Again the owner flashed us his menu, sensing our touristy indecision. I again declined and pointed to the restaurant I was heading to. He then ignored me and pan-handled to my two sisters, mother and wife. They gave in to my dismay. As they said \""sure...\"" I looked inside the restaurant of Christos at peak dinner hours.  No one was inside.  Absolutely no one. As my family walked in and I rolled my eyes, I thought, well let's give them a chance...my whole family seemed to feel bad for the guy and I like Greek food.\n\nAs we got in, it seemed nothing was going on. We had just came back from kayaking so we needed to wash our hands. They didn't seem to have a restroom but they took my sisters and mother through the kitchen and downstairs to find one. The silence was broken when they finally put music on and suddenly a couple of kitchen helpers came out and looked like they were warming some of the kitchen equipment up.  Were we their only customers tonight? I bet we were. Before I could settle in, he casually asked if I liked pita and hummus. Obviously I said yes. He was asking me so casually when I didn't even have a menu, I assumed it was complimentary when he said he would get me some, but as I waited I found his restaurant on Yelp with my phone and the first review gave them one star and mentioned how the owner didn't tell him the pita was extra.  Great. \n\nThe rest of my family later came back from the restroom (akin to going to a restroom at a grocery store where you're around stock items...except you need to go through their kitchen). They started with salad. The waiter asked if I wanted anchovies or something else on my salad. I was going to say \""sure\"" but my wife stopped me and said it could be extra. The waiter, looking like he got caught, verified he was offering all extras to me even though earlier the owner said salads came with dinner. I had to say,\""I just want the standard salad, nothing extra.\"" I couldn't let my guard down.\n\nWe ordered some food, priced about what you'd expect.  The pita and hummus I ordered earlier was just barely average so I don't know why they thought it was worth $4. My sister ordered \""leg of lamb\"" so I expected to see a leg of a lamb. Instead when her plate came out, it looked like sad slices of ham. Really. We all got vegetables but they were soggy and unappetizing. I saw them earlier in the kitchen sitting in a big pot when I had used the restroom. Nothing here is fresh. My lamb was on the chewy side. My sister's \""leg of lamb\"" was left uneaten and she asked if I wanted some. I \""tried\"" to eat it but it was too chewy. They then asked for dessert. I wanted to say no out of my discontent but again my family members all said yes, even when they were telling me the food was not great.  I don't have their sense of pity. The desert and salad were the best things of the night, which was kind of sad. \n\nWhen we got the receipt and my wife insisted we check it.  Surprise. They overcharged us $7 from two mysterious items. Their receipt doesn't even list what you ordered. I went up the the cashier to ask them what the two items were. He tried to explain one but he really couldn't. He scratched out the $3 item. I then questioned the $4 charge. Again he tried to explain it but he really couldn't. Again he agreed with me and scratched out the $4.  On top of all this we still gave them a normal tip out of pity. I could tell the waiters were just following orders. I could tell the owner had trained them what to say and how to make extra money.\n\nYou've been warned. There's a reason why this place is doing so poorly.  There's a reason why the whole hour between 7:30pm and 8:30pm we were the only ones in the restaurant. There's a reason why the owner is begging customer to come in. They're cutting corners on customer service and food quality in exchange for salesman tactics, overcharging and tricking you to buy things you don't even know is extra. DO NOT GO HERE.\n\nOwners like this will say,\""But I have to or else I won't make it.\"" You know what? Restaurants like yours shouldn't make it. Not to be harsh but it was a poor experience. Change your food, your sales tactics and your fake receipt items strategy. Maybe a long time ago when they started they were real but now they are doing every dirty trick in the book to nickel and dime you.  \n\nWARNING. DO NOT GO HERE.",1
2355,"This place is something STRAIGHT out of a David Lynch film. It felt like I was transported to some sort of alternate reality with the help of a smiling, and overbearing greek man outside a restaurant door preying on the weak and indecisive. Something in the air of this place comes off as so fundamentally strange, and almost, discomforting and nightmare-like. You are going to feel uneasy, is what I'm trying to say. \n\n- They overcharged us, probably intentionally. They don't have itemized receipts. \n- The waiter kept giving us options as if they were... free options that you're supposed to choose. We caught on when we specifically asked if they cost extra.\n- The elusive bathroom felt like we were descending down the staircase to hell. Better than nothing, I suppose.\n- The food.... oh my god. None of our food was good. In fact most of it was outright gross/uneatable. The hummus was decent, but... I can also get decent hummus at Trader Joe's. \n\nWe initially felt bad for these guys. A struggling business is always sad to see. But with all of the strange behavior, attempts to scam us, etc. that sympathy turned into a sense of understanding as to why this place isn't doing so well. \n\nIf the owners are reading this-- I'm sorry if my review came off harsh.. but really, please, rethink the way you are going about your business. I don't want you to fail, I want you to overcome this. Do it the right way, not the scummy way. I know you're trying, but try differently.",1
2356,"Ordered take out from Christos.  I ordered a diet coke and it was in a cup.  THANK GOODNESS I took the lid off first.  There were HUNDREDS of large white particles in the diet coke that looked like paint chips,  eggshells or paper and did not dissolve in the liquid but remained floating around.  This is a health hazard and needless to say, I will not be ordering from this establishment again.  As for the food, mediocre at best  The baklava was average, the mixed grille kabab (chicken and lamb) was okay, dry and chewy at times but overall edible.  The salad that came with the mixed grille was decent in flavor but did have some brown old lettuce in it.  As for the cold combination, the tzatziki, one grape leaf, and hummus were fine but the tarmasalata had some ingredient which was clearly spoiled.  The cr\u00e8me caramel (greek version of flan) was floating in water, really strange texture; my guess is it was frozen then defrosted, but a dessert should absolutely not be floating in a large pool of water.",1

He thought it was cool as well. The best part was inside. the decor is fantastic, and really the only reason to go. Loads of vintage signs and things and smack in the middle of the one dining room - a real vintage trolly car - completely renovated... of course I asked for us to be seated inside there... that was really neat. \n\nThen the food came... I had spaghetti and Meatballs and a Caesar salad. Now, the salad was really flavorful and fresh. Normally I hate salads in places like this. the lettuce tastes old and rubbery... not in this case. it was excellent. The spaghetti on the other hand - wow, watery, slightly overcooked noodles and sauce I bet was straight out of a Hunt's Spaghetti sauce can. the meatballs were frozen and reheated - i hate that off taste frozen meat takes on. so the salad got an A and spaghetti was a bit loser. \n\nMy stepson ordered the Italian wedding soup - he loved it - I did not try it... he also got the same watery noodles with the mushroom red sauce. Those mushrooms must have come straight from a can. they were button and the one I tasted had that tinned flavor.... so essentially this restaurant depends completely on frozen, processed, canned ingredients rather than fresh and flavorful. \n\nBottom line... have kids with you? they will love it... just the adults? find something... anything else... it is going to disappoint.",2
2359,Spag Warehouse is the best value for money in the tri-state area.... damn good food!!,5
2360,Service is lacking and food is mediocre. When I crave Italian this is not the first place I think of.,2
2361,"Visited this place for the first time for a rehersal dinner. The decor is cool and varied and the place itself is quite large. There is free parking which is nice, but parking was hard to find on a Friday night. We had a semi-large party (about 15-20 of us) and it took us well over 30 minutes to get seated. Clearly they knew we were coming, so it shouldn't have been a surprised to them.\n\nOnce we were finally seated, it took 30 minutes from ordering our drinks (both alcoholic and non-alcoholic) to actually getting them to the table. We still hadn't even looked at a menu when the drinks finally did arrive. From there the service picked up slightly and we were presented with warm bread, garlic butter (decent) and salad. I dislike iceburg lettuce so this was meh. Given that we were a large party, obviously we were given a limited menu selection. I ordered \""The Incredible 15 Layer Lasagna\"" and it certainly wasn't 15 layers, unless you count the loads of marinara on top as, say, 10 layers. My cousin ordered the same thing and ended up with a piece of chicken on his plate, don't ask me why. The lasagna was okay, but I've had better from a Stouffer's frozen meal.\n\nMoving onto dessert, I ordered the tiramisu. Might as well just call it white cake with \""espresso\"" drizzled on top. It was still slightly frozen too. No thanks.\n\nFrom start to finish it took us over 3 hours to get our entire meal. Understandably, we weren't a small table of four so it will take longer, but it shouldn't have taken that long. Since we were there for a significant amount of time, we were able to observe what other's were eating/doing while we were waiting. Nearly everyone had enough leftover portions to take home and feed themselves at least once if not twice more. Good value as a customer, bad for a business who is trying to make money.\n\nAll in all, if you're looking for some good authentic Italian, I would recommend going elsewhere.",2
2362,"Went tonight for $4.99 rollback Wednesdays. Not very many people at around 9p, so service was really excellent.\n\nI only ordered the $4.99 spaghetti with meat sauce which comes with salad and bread. Even ignoring the price, I really enjoyed the whole meal from start to finish. I suspect true Italian aficionados will be upset that the pasta is cooked through, but it really reminded me of home growing up in the Midwest.",4
2363,"Disappointed. That one word sums up our group of 15's experience at the Spaghetti Warehouse. This restaurant has been a Pittsburgh institution for so long; however, it left many in our group unsatisfied and hungry at the end. My mom ordered the roasted garlic shrimp and her dish was dry and the shrimp were over cooked to the point of too chewy. I ordered the chopped salad \""warehouse style\"" as my main entree and it was a big salad. Yet the veggies in the salad weren't fresh and the warm chicken was burnt and wilted the lettuce with its heat. I sent it back without eating it (at least the waitress was kind enough to take it off of our bill). My fiance got the lasagna and chicken parm off of the classic combo section of the menu and his chicken was ok but not great. The lasagna was good too. However, neither were great.  My aunt and father were unimpressed with their dishes as well but I'm not sure what they got so I can't speak to their food quality.\n\nAlso, it took us an hour after we ordered to receive our food and our food was cold. Granted, I understand we have a party of 15 BUT the restaurant was not packed by any stretch of the means. In fact the room we sat in had approximately 10 open tables. I can't speak to how filled the other rooms of the restaurant were though. But there should not have been a hour wait nor should we have gotten cold food as a result of it. \n\nWe have booked this restaurant for our rehearsal dinner for our wedding but, considering how poor the food was and how incredibly slow the service was (no fault of the waitress), we are looking to change our reservations to a different restaurant. We chose the Spaghetti Warehouse because it is close to the hotel where all of our guests for our wedding are staying. Given how slow the service was, we can't afford to be there til 10:30pm at night when we have to be up at 6am the next morning for a very long day. (Another reviewer said that their rehearsal dinner group took 3+ hours to get out of there).  \n\nJust my 2 cents.  I wish the food quality and service were better.  I'm glad we found it out now before the rehearsal dinner.",2
2364,".JB's parents wanted to meet here for dinner, I wasn't all that thrilled but I went for them. I guess I was a little hard on SW the first time around, the food isn't bad, I just think it's overrated. On this trip we got an appetizer sampler - fried mozz and zucchiniI were nothing special, the brushetta was superb and I didn't get to taste the fried ravoli but I didn't hear any complaints from the table. As an entree I had the 4 cheese manicotti which comes with both marinara and alfredo, the dish was good but im not really a fan of their marinara so if I ever find myself revisiting The SW I'll ask for just alfredo. Everyone else at the table had some form of lasagna (veggie, sausage and meat) and again, no complaints. Overall, its a decent family restaurant.",3
2365,"Why come to this place when you have a tasty world of Italian restaurants right at your hungry fingers in this town!\n\nThe place is essentially a tourist-trap that seeks to reel in folks who are looking for a \""fun\"" looking italian warehouse (now...how would this be fun? Apparently it is to some.)\n\nDon't get me wrong...the food is not atrocious. But it certainly is sub-par. My chicken parm was quite un-tasty and seemed as if the spaghetti had come out of a can. The service was mediocre.\n\nKeep driving to Bloomfield!",1
2366,"We have been coming here since it opened, but will not go back after our three last visits. It has gone downhill badly. Three visits ago we were seated in the trolley and then completely ignored for 30 minutes. There was a waitress, but apparently she was new and only had the front half. I finally went out front and demanded the manager who finally assigned a waitress for us and comp'ed our meals. The lasagna was very disappointing with hard noodles and definitely not oven baked and barely warm.\nTwo visits ago to use the gift cards we intended to use on the previous visit, service was poor and food was fair.\nThe last visit last night was the third strike and SW is OUT! Very poor service and food. The drinks were all ice and refills were not timely. The server past our table many times, but she flew by each time like we were not there. The zucchini appetizer was good. We only got one loaf of bread which was barely done and came with almost no butter. No ranch dressing...really! This is the Strip District after all with many stores for crying out loud. The food was very poor. The spaghetti and meatballs had about a tablespoon of sauce. The fetticini alfredo was almost devoid of sauce, as well. My Wild Mushroom and Chicken was not warm but tasted okay. We will NOT be going back. Olive Garden and Bravos in the North Hills will be getting our business from now on.",1
2367,"Didn't think this was possible, but it's worse than Olive Garden...food was horrible and extremely overpriced, service was decidedly lacking....  Neat location with fun and interesting decor but I wouldn't eat there again.",1
2368,"Yes-the food is good and the portions are big.  Our waiter was very speedy and attentive.  That being said, I cannot ever go back to this place again because of the amount of bugs I saw in such a short period of time.  All gnats and thankfully nothing worse but who knows what's going on in the kitchen?  Not just a stray gnat or two but dozens just swarmed our table.  I killed one with my bare hand on the table and another one bit me and drew a (spec) of blood. Disgusting. A \""manager\"" (looked like a bus boy if you ask me but what do I know) did come to talk to us about it after my waiter noticed me covering my food with my napkin but it didn't accomplish much, no free meal or anything.  I noticed other people moving to other parts of the restaurant to avoid these bugs too.",1
2369,"If you are in the mood for Italian, give it a try. They have a dinner for two that includes all the favorites...sausage, meatballs, lasagna, chicken Parmesan, spaghetti, and cheese ravioli. The prices are right. This is a great family restaurant.  The kids are given a wooden nickle to turn in at the front desk for a candy stick, and  Wednesday nights they have a balloonist and magician.",4
2370,"Why anyone would willing go here to eat is beyond me.  I had read prior yelp reviews and I knew what I was getting myself into.  To make a long story short, I went here because I was with several other people that wanted to go here and I really had no choice.  Anyway, I ordered the wild mushroom pasta with chicken. The sauce was really disgusting. I found myself eating only the pieces of chicken breast.  I brought this meal home because my husband isn't as picky as I am, but he took two bites and got mad at me for not warning him how aweful this meal was.  I will not be eating with this group of people again if they choose to go here again.",2
2371,"There has to be better Italian food in Pittsburgh -- I don't know why anyone would come here.\n\nI had an overnight field trip with my students to Pittsburgh & the tour company took us here for a murder mystery dinner show.  They had us sectioned off which was great for privacy & also since the students were loud.\n\nTheir service is a hot mess!!!!  They only had 2 waiters serving our 50 person group & it was not organized at all.  Just getting our drinks out was confusing.  The waiters just came out with any drink & then asked -- anyone order this??  This is why my table sat drinkless, breadless, & saladless for the longest time.\n\nFor our dinner, we were given a salad, entree, & tiramisu.  The salad was definitely straight out of the bag & doused with some cheap dressing.  It didn't taste fresh at all.  There was a list of 8 or so entrees we could choose from.  They came out quite haphazardly.  I unfortunately ordered the fettuccine alfredo -- worst ever.  I could make better alfredo using the sauce from a supermarket jar.  I tried to douse it with pepper & cheese but alas it did nothing to help it.  Some of the others said the chicken parm was alright but some said theirs was undercooked.  The tiramisu also was gross.  It definitely was made & cut awhile ago & just kept cold in their fridge.\n\nThe redeeming parts of this dinner was the decor & old fashioned coin operated games AND the mystery show.  I've never been to one & was really excited.  They started after we ate our entrees & intermissioned during dessert.  The actors were super funny & interactive -- my students loved them which of course makes me happy.  Seriously though, their food is so bad.",1
2372,"We went here recently right before a 2-day, 150-mile bike ride to carbo-load. The food was okay - probably what we should have expected for the low prices - but the service was horrible. It was not busy, but we could not get our waitresses attention despite multiple attempts. We needed a refill and asked for one when she took our dinner order, and reminded her when our dinner arrived. We were finally able to flag her down 10 minutes later to remind her again. It also took about 20 minutes to get the check after we had FINISHED our entrees. I am sure that not all of the servers are that bad, but I'm not sure I will be back to find out.",2
2373,"I will always adore this place for some reason. It has a historical, old-time feel to it, complete with the retro decor and trolley car. The food is not the greatest Italian food I've ever had, but they always have deals and specials which makes it a great place for a family outing or lunch with friends. I mostly love the atmosphere of the place. I will admit, the service wasn't so great the last time I was there, but you get what you pay for. They have a parking lot in the back.",3
2374,"I walked in expecting a great experience. It has a great atmosphere. There was nothing wrong with our service, but the food was overpriced and pretty meh. I had the tiramisu which is one of my favorites to get and it was horrible. It tasted like it came out of a Walmart freezer on clearance. Won't be coming back anytime soon.",2
2375,"Decent, not great",3
2376,"Whatever happened to this place?  Seriously.  I remember when you couldn't even get in the door.  Now I walk in and feel like walking right back out.\n\nOverall, I've got no complaints about the food.  I think it's average and priced well.  The lasagna is top notch.  And having a private lot in the Strip District is nice.  I usually dine in but on my last two trips I was placing an order to go.  After the first time I should have learned my lesson and called ahead.  Never again.\n\nThe first time, I walked in and went to the bar area (as directed by the sign at the hostess station, not an actual person) to place my to go order.  But there was no one there.  It's funny, because waiters walk through the bar area and even use the bar to get drinks.  But it seems they don't like to actually wait on customers or even make eye contact.  After waiting way too long to even be acknowledged, my order was taken.  The waiter who ended up helping me, Andrae, apologized at least and was very nice.  I asked for two salads and he was happy to accomodate.  But then I waited again.  I'm not sure why my food took so long, but Andrae knew I had been waiting and threw in some extra bread.  Despite the wait, at least I felt like I Andrae took an interest in making sure I was taken care of and his apology was sincere.  \n\nSkip to the second time.  While I had bad memories of my last visit, I was hoping it was an isolated incident and gave Spaghetti Warehouse the benefit of the doubt.  Except....things were worst.  I start to wonder if there is ever an actual bartender.  But as I'm sitting at the bar, waiting once again for achknowledgement from an employee, there was not one but two managers conducting interviews in the bar area.  While this is happening, several waitresses come to the bar to get drinks.  Not one even looks in my direction, let alone ask if I need something.  I didn't want to be rude and interrupt the interviews being conducted, but after a good ten minutes of waiting, I went to the hostess stand at the entrance.  I waited a minute or two before one of the waitresses who previously ignored me came out.  I was a little salty with her, I'll admit.  I explained that I had been waiting at the bar as the sign says but no one was there to take my order.  She said she could take my order and again, I was directed to wait at the bar.  Back at the bar, their interviews over, I spoke up to one of the managers about how I had been ignored.  She apologized and said she thought someone had waited on me.  She then offered to take my order which I told her was unnecessary because I had placed it with a waitress at the hostess stand.  A few minutes later, the manager came up to tell me that she had deducted $10 from my bill and apologized again.  I wasn't expecting that, but at least it was an admission of their poor customer service.  However when I received my to-go bag, I only found one salad and one loaf of bread.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is....beware when placing to-go orders.  It's probably best to call ahead.  The service here is hit or miss on a daily basis, but definitely beyond a miss when trying to get food to go.",2
2377,"This was the first time my husband and I have been here. We went with my sister-in-law, her boyfriend, and his sister as it is a tradition to go around Christmas for the boyfriend's family. Well, we were not impressed at all. Even the bf wasn't happy this time. We didnt have the best waitress as she would run off too quickly.for us to say much and we thought forgot about us the drinks took so long. She finally showed and said she had dropped them and had to make them again. We ordered and the wait wasn't too terribly bad for the food being a Saturday night in Pittsburgh though it was after 7 when we arrived. I didn't care much for.the garlicky butter that came with the sourdough, but the bread was hot and fresh.\n\nA balloon artist came around and made a flamingo that had to be 4 feet tall for the bf's sister and a little penguin for the SIL. He later came back, unasked, and gave her a 2 ft penguin with a hockey stick and puck in its \""hands'. \n\nWe finally got our soup, which did take a while to come out. Three of.us had the wedding soup and none of us liked it. The SIL's bf said it didn't even taste like wedding soup, but like chicken soup with meatballs. Granted I've been a little stuffy lately, but the broth barely tasted like wedding soup broth to me either.\n\nI had the fettucine alfredo, which was ok. I ate more of it than I might have were I not eating for two right now.  I added pepper because it was rather plain...not even a garnish. My husband said his spaghetti and meatballs was just ok. The bf had ordered an Italian Margarita I believe it was called and drank the first one though it wasn't mixed right as you could taste the tequila and there was no salt. He even added sugar trying to improve it. The second he gave back and the waitress didn't even apologize or take it off the bill. She went into the kitchen and started complaining loudly and our table was near the kitchen. Then she shows up with the check and we had to wait for her to come back to split it 3 ways since there was 2 couples and one other at the table. The bad drink was still there and my SIL was thoroughly pissed by then and went to talk to the manager and told him about overhearing her and all he did was take the one drink off. I noticed while reading our check that the entrees were correct, but that she had us as having a salad and minestrone when we both had wedding soup. I didn't say anything since the price was the same.\n\nThe balloons artist was great, but we won't be going back just to see him.",1
2378,"This place is dead, but they just don't know it yet.  \n\nArrived on a rainy Wednesday around 7PM.  20 minute wait for a table, so I guess they are doing well, right?  We should have known better when we sat in the bar area to wait (me, my spouse, and my eight-year-old son) after the rather apathetic front-desk person took our name.  A couple tables taken, but no sign of staff in the bar.  Every table was dirty, covered with plates, glasses, and the remains of others.  We took one that had just a couple of glasses and an impressive amount of Parmesan cheese scattered about.  Took 10 minutes for any sign of a bartender, who promptly spent five minutes getting caught up on drink orders before wandering over.  No smile, no welcome, just \""what do you want, and are you waiting for a table\"".  And certainly no \""let me clean this table for you\"".  We had a beer and a wine and a root beer for the little one.  The pinot grigio was vile, but, hey, thanks for charging us for the more expensive version: lord knows how disgusting the cheaper version would have been.   Finally, after 20 minutes we were seated.  Not a table in the bar area had been cleaned in that period.\n\nAnd the restaurant is empty!  Maybe 20% full!  They made us wait simply because they can't staff correctly.  Acres of empty tables.  So we sit, look at the menu, check out the surrounding (few) tables and made the only good decision we made this night:  we left and found another place in the area.  A place that actually worked to seat us and made us feel welcome.\n\nThe most amazing thing:  between the greeter, the bartender, and the seater, there was not a single smile.  Not a single sign that they actually are happy that we chose their establishment.  And not a sign that that they gave a damn whether we ever wanted to come back.  No wonder it is 80% empty but still makes people wait.\n\nThe other reviews compare this to Olive Garden and the like.  As my review makes clear, I can't compare the food.  And I am certainly not a fan of the Olive Garden.  But the few times I have gone into one, I was made to feel welcome.  Certainly not here.  \n\nThe place is living off memories:  I don't think it is creating any new (positive) ones.",1
2379,"I liked the food here. We got the $25 deal. Salad was good but a little dressing heavy, stuffed mushroom appetizer was simple but very good and the 15 layer lasagne was very rich and hearty. The hostess was a ditz. He seated a couple before us that we arrived before and then seated us at a table that was inconvenient with a post, cutting off part of our party. We asked to move and she just moved the table. The kicker was the place was empty!",4
2380,"I went to the Spaghetti Warehouse on a Sunday afternoon.   It was for a late lunch (about 2:00 p.m. when we arrived).  We were greeted by the hostess who took us to our table (which was in the trolley car).  It's a visually interesting place to dine.  However, our chairs were rickety and appeared ready to collapse. \n\nThe restaurant was mostly empty (which was not a surprise as we got there after the prime lunch hour but before dinner).  And yet although there wasn't a lot of other customers there all vying for the attention of the servers, it took an unusually long time for our waitress to arrive at our table.  (A pattern which continued throughout the duration of our stay).   \n\nOn the back of the menu, there is a section for lunch entrees.  I ordered the \""Amazing 15 Layer Lasagne\"".   The three other people in my party all ordered the spaghetti with meatballs.   The food was...okay.  Nothing to write home about.  I've been eating Italian food for almost five decades.  And this is average - at best.  I'd say on par or slightly below Olive Garden.  It wasn't the worst food, but certainly not the best.  And again, I cannot overemphasize how below par the service was.   \n\nBut the thing which really upset me was when we got our check.  They charged us dinner prices for each of our meals.   Again, there is ONE menu, and the pack of the menu has the lunch section.  It reads (until 3:00 p.m.).   What I failed to see (because it's in fine print) is the part where they only offer lunch prices Monday through Friday.   Really?  REALLY?   Are you kidding me?   That's B.S., no matter how you view it.  At no time did either the hostess or the waitress bother to explain to us up front that the lunch pricing wasn't in effect.   \n\nI HATE being ripped off.  And any restaurant which does that kind of crap is RIPPING PEOPLE OFF.   So congratulations, Spaghetti Warehouse.  You got the better of me.  And I will never, ever go there again.",1
2381,"You can't screw up pasta--it would be very hard.  Only Buca di Beppo has managed to do that, and they did it by drowning the pasta in salt and charging through the nose for it.\n\nThe food here is pretty darn good.  I love the bread they bring to your table and the atmosphere is very fun.\n\nMy problem is that the past four times I've been here, the service was awful.  Tonight our waiter brought our bread and salads before our drinks and this was only a huge problem bc I was dying of thirst.  \n\nOur waiter (Vincent) had 3 tables.  It was like he was trained not to bring our table anything unless hte other two tables needed something.  He would disappear for 20 minutes at a time (I'm not kidding).  I gave him my drink order and then he asked for our dinner order.  He came out with entrees for the one table, salads for the other, and bread for our table.  Why would you not just get our drinks?  You can come back to the table multiple times!!!\n\nThis has happened the past four times I dined here, and I'm just over the awful service.  Too bad I won't be back, bc I wanted to love this restaurant.\n\nGood food, AWFUL service.  2 stars bc I love carbs so damn much.",2
2382,"I wanted to like it here... in fact, I have in the past. We used to come here for college events and schedule ahead of time for a large group - then again, this was always on weeknights... when they were slow... thank goodness. I always loved the food here (then again, these dishes aren't anything scientific - they are basic - comfort food), and I thought the gigantic restaurant could handle large groups well... until I brought 10 people here for a birthday dinner on a Saturday. \n\nFirst of all, we had reservations but still stood awkwardly in the waiting area for a while to be seated. Not terrible. Then we were seated - the server was flustered and irritated before we had a chance to speak. Long story short, we waited 1.5 hours for our food (pasta... yes - the stuff you make at home for an entire family in 10 minutes), the waitress spent all her time coming to her table bashing the kitchen staff to us (not exactly professional), and the manager was no where to be seen. C'mon, manager! It's your job to sail this ship - get it together. From my line of vision, I could see about 7 servers running around like chickens with their heads cut off doing nothing but throwing the kitchen staff under the bus. Dear manager: if you have this many employees standing around doing nothing but complaining, put a few of them to work in the kitchen. \n\nThe place is cute and I really want to like it again, but I probably won't return until the management learns how to... manage. True, this isn't Capital Grill, nor was I expecting 5-star service. In all honesty, I'm from the middle-of-nowhere Ohio. I didn't even know what fine dining was until college. It's just that I've had better service at Arby's on a Friday at 12 noon when they have a line 20 people deep and cars wrapped around the building 3 times in the drive-thru. \n\nSaving grace: the sangria was good... thankfully, because that's the only thing we consumed for 90 minutes while waiting on our luke-warm dinners to arrive.",1
2383,"Arrived at 7:15 on a Saturday night, there was a 20 minute wait although although empty tables were visible.  Got seated at 7:30, put order in shortly thereafter.  We got bread and our soups fairly quickly then sat for an hour without any signs of food.  We looked around the restraint and it was obvious other tables had been waiting and we're getting frustrated.  The waitress apologized the kitchen was slow, so we gave it another 15 minutes before we finally walked out at 9:15 still hungry.  The food I saw looked good, but I would never recommend this place.  It doesn't take over an hour and a half to make a friggin salad and pasta.",1
2384,"It's probably been about 7 years since I actually ate in the Spaghetti Warehouse. I remembered the experience being pretty underwhelming, so I didn't have high expectations, but we had ordered food for delivery last winter (no, they don't deliver, but one of the online delivery services had them listed), and the food was good enough that we figured it would be a decent meal...and it didn't disappoint on a food level!\n\nNow, I'll never claim that Spaghetti Warehouse is the best Italian food spot in the city, but the prices were very reasonable for the portions you get, and the food is actually pretty good. We tried the classic bruschetta as an app. It was really good, and while you \""only\"" get four small pieces, it was a perfect amount for the two of us. The endless salad and bread is a great touch for those who are fans of the Spaghetti Warehouse's counterpart, The Olive Garden. \n\nMaybe it was the plaque for the 8,800 lb. World Largest Lasagna on the outside of the restaurant, or the photos in the menu, but I couldn't resist trying the 15-layer lasagna. I actually got the lasagna & chicken park combo, which was probably enough to feed two, despite my gluttonous ability to eat it all myself. The lasagna was good, with a very sausage-dominant flavor, which pleased me. I think my only complaint would've been the lack of sauce. There was barely enough. Same complaint goes for the chicken parm that was on the plate. It was good, but definitely could've used a little more sauce. I'd likely request extra next time to be safe. The bread is awesome, but disappears too quickly! Overall, there really wasn't anything to complain about regarding the meal itself. We went in with chain restaurant expectations and weren't disappointed. When we had ordered food for delivery, I tried the eggplant parm, which was really good. My wife said the wedding soup was also awesome. I'd say two positive food experiences out of two is a good trend!\n\nThe biggest issue that I have with Spaghetti Warehouse - and the reason I can't give it more than 3 stars - is this: while the expectations/food quality are in line with what you'd expect from an Olive Garden and the vibe is what you'd expect from an old school TGI Friday's, the reality is that the restaurant itself in in shambles when you compare it to those two (or any other chain, small or large, in the same category). For a restaurant that seems to always be packed, you'd think there would be money to maintain the inside of the restaurant a little. We sat in the bar, and the fans above the bar were in various levels of disrepair. The TV's at the bar were all so old that you'd never choose Spaghetti Warehouse for a place to grab a meal if you were hoping to also catch the game. A small tube TV/VCR combo? Even the dive bars that we hangout in are more up-to-date! The cleanliness left a lot to be desired, as well. In a dive bar, diner, or truck stop, I'd be okay with the griminess, but in a large restaurant? No thanks. I'm not saying it'll keep me away, and it clearly doesn't bother the masses that keep the lines flowing out the door, but it really needs to improve to make Spaghetti Warehouse a destination that I'd be quick to recommend.",3
2385,"This is a one time visit. The worst service ever. It was almost empty and twice we had to have someone find our waitress. The food was mediocre at best. The bruschetta appetizer for 4.99 had 4 tiny pieces of bread with some tomatoes on top. Not even shaved cheese, nothing. Total waste of money. The lasagna that they claim is so great in my opinion was diner quality, and that might insult some great diners.",1
2386,"It has been years sense we visited the spaghetti warehouse, my husband and I couldn't remember why we haven't been back. We had purchased a groupon for this place and decided to try it for an early dinner... Our first step in the restaurant and then it hit us on why we haven't returned.. The odd smell hits you at first step in the restaurant , you look around in the foyer and you see weird and dilapidated pictures, a candy stand that probably hasn't been used in years.. We get seated in a booth with one side ripped and the other side stained, our waitress was nice but that is far as she went. The food is mediocre at best, the bread and the endless salad was the saving grace of dinner... We wanted to enjoy this place and tried to have a good time, we would not recommend this place to anyone... There are plenty of other good restaurants in the strip and in lawrenceville..",2
2387,"Came here a year or so ago to meet some friends... overall not a good experience.  There were 4 of us and I don't think one plate was cleared or drinks refilled, it was a slow weeknight as well.  So yes that could have just been bad luck with the waitress, but food is sub-par and atmosphere is well.\nI suppose this is a good dining option in some situations, but there are so many other places in the area, and I guess this was just nothing to write home about for me.",2
2388,The atmosphere was pretty cool. It really is warehouse like. Could have been better with a bigger crowd. But the food was pretty bland.,3
2389,"Went here on a date, and unfortunately I felt like I walked into a suburban chain restaurant like Applebee's or Ruby Tuesday. The wait staff, however, were all very nice and quick with everything. The food portions were large, and getting the soup and appetizer with the meal almost made my stomach burst. The veggie lasagna was average, the minestrone soup could have been out of the can, but the highlight for me was the baked ravioli appetizer. It was unique and tasty. I had an overall pretty good experience, but I probably won't come back here.",3
2390,"DO NOT GO HERE! They are understaffed, incompetent,  and slow. It was like getting waited on by 1st job people. The place smells like bleach. It's tacky too hot. They play pop music and it's supposed to be an Italian place. Not one person there ever smiled and I was treated like a body in a chair not a person wanting to enjoy a meal. Very very slow service and no authenticity in the meals. I suggest eating out of a seafood dumpster if you plan on going here.",1
2391,"Im soo surprised with the food that we ate. Im from California and was excited to experience this restaurant. Especially, since it is a local fav. I ordered the house made spaghetti expecting a fresh tomato base sauce. Unfortunately what I got tasted like a canned sauce with minced onions. It had no...flavor!  Now maybe I ruined the meal by ordering gluten free noodles....but I didnt think that would make it this bad. Im soo sorry because our server was awesome and they even accommodated our big party. On a good note, the bread was delicious.\nAs much as I hate Olive Garden...I would preferred that.",2
2392,Took two and a half hours to get our food. All our food was the thrown together in the same pan. Not worth the $55.,1
2393,"Ordered delivery. The food showed up 2.5 hours later-which is acceptable, as it's (just) within the delivery window specified. However, the food had apparently been prepared within 15 minutes of receiving our order, because it was cold by the time we got it. I didn't listen to the other reviews and paid the price (literally)... if someone else is saved a crappy SW dinner by this review, my meal (or lack thereof) will not have been in vain.",1
2394,"I just can't help but love Spaghetti Warehouse! So many memories at this restaurant, not to mention the vintage decor is so nostalgic! There is a train (complete with vintage ads and posters!) in the left portion of the restaurant that patrons can have dinner in, which is an absolutely amazing experience! The food is always pretty good and there are deals for certain days of the week that your wallet will thank you for. And let's not forgot to mention the mouth watering sourdough bread and garlic butter! It is so amazing and addictive! The wedding soup is phenomenal! Though, I most recently ordered steak and vegetables, and the presentation was thrown together and unappetizing. There were two small pieces of random steak on my plate, as though they were leftovers. The waiter was odd and rude. He asked if the birthday dessert was on my boyfriend's dad in front of the whole dinner party. Usually, most restaurants will give you a little something for your birthday, or at least be a little less blunt about the cost of the dessert. I wouldn't recommend sitting by the door that the staff comes out of either. It's really loud and they will have full conversations right by your table. Other than those two experiences, I've had a great overall experience at Spaghetti Warehouse and would recommend it to others!",4
2395,Worst place ever.  I took my friend there for the first time and my son.  We waited a hour for food.  The waiter got us out water not our sangria  30 min later out salads and after  another 40 min of my kid begging for his pizza we decided to go.  The reason they messed up the order.  We talked to the manager I'm assuming which didn't really care.  Said hopefully we come back because service isn't usually this bad. Never again. Unprofessional and rude,1
2396,"Our terrible experience began with a 45 minute wait only to find half the tables empty and the table behind us being consoled by the manager after their own bad experience. We hopped this was a one off and not typical. Our waiter was prompt but very aloof, but we all have off days. The food was mostly bland and flavorless to the point we could not finish it.  This is where things took a turn for the worse, as our order was being boxed up it fell on the floor. Despite our insistence we did not want another the overcompensating manager brought it anyway. We passed it on to the party behind us, maybe they took it home and added some seasoning, it needs it. Avoid this place at all costs!",2
2397,We went on a Saturday night. We were told it would be a 30 minute wait...but it was likely closer to 45-50 minutes. \n\nThe food is just average. Nothing special. Didn't seem handmade or anything like that. I thought they were known for their lasagna...so I got that. Blah...average.\n\nService was incredibly slow. I don't think the waiter checked on us once.\n\nI probably wouldn't go back.\n\nVisited October 2014,2
2398,"We went here with sixteen people. The only good thing about our visit was having dinner with a bunch of our friends. The service was pretty good to considering the large party. My wife and I got the Sicilian Sampler Appetizer and The Ultimate Feast for two, as our dinner entree. The Calamari was uneatable and the Ravioli was just down right nasty. The wedding soup was the worst I have ever had. The meat balls had absolute no taste, kind of like cardboard. The Pork Sausage tasted burnt. The Spaghetti tasted no different than Boxed pasta. The Lasagna might have had 15 layers but 12 of them were noodles and sauce, you had to search for any meat or cheese. Our garlic bread came out literally black. I can't even believe somebody would serve that. We will not be back.",1
2399,"Wednesday night is their special night.. Unlimited soup or salad, bread and a plate of spaghetti (or other limited options) for $4.99.\n\nCheaper than a value meal at your favorite fast food joint and friendlier service.\n\nThey were busy tonight, but got served in a reasonable amount of time and he was friendly.\n\nThey aren't going to win any Italian food awards. But for the price it can't be beat.\n\nWith that said, no way I would pay \""normal\"" pricing here.",3
2400,"I stopped in here with my family the day before Thanksgiving. My sister, niece, and parents were at the Children's Museum and were struck by a fit of nostalgia--my mom used to take us here when we were kids. Either the whole operation has gone severely downhill, or I was too young to notice how bad it all is.\n\nBetween all of us, we ordered chicken Alfredo, lasagna, and cheese ravioli. Every dish had several things wrong with it. The chicken was likely cooked the week before in a dirty cafeteria then shipped to the Strip District. It was dry and looked reconstituted. The ravioli were lukewarm at best, and my sister said the lasagna tasted microwaved. Even the bread was stale.\n\nOur waitress was also forgetful and a bit cold. I didn't get a salad I ordered, dishes stayed on the table fifteen or twenty minutes after being empty, and water refills were inconsistent. As a former server myself, I'd like to think I know what is in one's control and what is out of one's control. This woman was simply not up to snuff.\n\nWith Lidia's right down Smallman Street, I have no idea how the Warehouse is staying in business. Spend a few extra dollars and go there. It'll be worth it.",1
2401,"The rates here are perfectly reasonable. I have no idea if it costs women more, but it costs me less than $20 for my haircut. I do see an equal number of males and females in this place. Katie, specifically, is fantastic. She is very smooth and efficient, but double checks to make sure everything is right before sending me on my way. Couldn't recommend this place more.",5
2402,"While not necessarily an art destination, this small gallery is a worthwhile diversion in the Strip District.  The small space features one or two distinct installations, and in addition to the exhibitions, the adjacent store stocks a variety of handmade crafts.  Worth checking out if you're in the area, not least because the admission's free.",3
2403,"Really marvelous art presented in a beautiful setting.  The gift shop is one of the best in the city.  They feature crafts from artists around the world and local.  Shows are well lit and well presented.  Downstairs are studios where they teach classes on metals, wood, fiber, mixed media and book/paper arts (beginning to advanced). They do a great job of hosting outside events and fundraisers.",5
2404,"There is nothing really to complain about here.  This Mortons is like most in other cities.  It's definitely for the expense account crowd.  It's fun to go to a place and to know exactly what you are in for.  I've been to Mortons all over the country and this one stacks up pretty well.  It's like most other high end chain steakhouses (Palm, Ruth's, Capital Grille, etc.).  The bar is pretty lame, but I'm guessing most go here for a sit down dinner.  Capital Grille or Hyde Park bar is much better for bar scene.  But, one thing I definitely appreciate about the bar is  the bar menu.  If you've never been to Mortons and you are watching your budget go to the bar have a cold beer and order the PRIME cheeseburger trio or the Filet sandwiches for only 6 DOLLARS.  Plus, the fries are awesome.  The dining room is really nice with dark wood and lots of leather.  The service is awesome because I'm guessing you have to be pretty good to land a server position that might end up paying you 6 figures.  The food is great.  However, my opinion is that most true high end steakhouses all have similiar quality steak.  I eat here a few times a year and my favorite first courses are the lobster bisque (Very good, but not as good as capital grille) and the tuna tartare.  Stay away from the filet.  I mean it's tender and delicious, but try a steak with a little flavor.  I'm guessing if you're like me you don't go to Mortons often, so try something that  is hard to get elsewhere.  Get the Cajun ribeye.  I can't remember if Pittsburgh location does a bone in ribeye, but if they do I would say a cajun bone in ribeye will be one of the best if not the best steaks you ever try.  I also suggest getting the \""lazy\"" lobster.  There are few things in life more indulgent or enjoyable than having a two pound lobster cooked perfectly already cracked for you.  It's pure indulgence.  The asparagus is great and as big as a baseball bat.  The spinach is great and the hash browns are a must have.  You should definitely save room for desert and there is no better desert here than the chocolate souffle'.  Remember to tell them that is what you want for desert when you order your entrees.  I wish the bar was better, because if it was I'd go here more often.  This place is exactly what you would expect.  And, that's a good thing.",4
2405,"We ate here on a Sunday night and it was surprisingly slow. The wait staff was okay, not the best I have had at a Morton's and the same goes for the food. Don't get me wrong, everything was good just not as good as say the Morton's in Portland.",3
2406,"The last time I ate at a Morton's was in Houston, TX, so I was very excited when BJ suggested that we dine here Saturday night. Had a 7:30 pm reservation, was greeted promptly and led to a comfy corner booth. The restaurant was very busy. Our server Georgeann was very friendly and hit it off right away with BJ. The two of them kept me entertained all night long! I don't know which one was the funniest. Well, BJ wins hands down. \n\nWe pondered the wine bible for a bit, but BJ is a beer dude (they have a somewhat limited selection) and I am more of a cocktail girl. Loved the cosmopolitans there. Very delicious. \n\nWe bypassed the appetizers, we both got Morton's salads, which were huge. I had a single cut filet and a crab cake, BJ also got a filet and bacon wrapped scallops. Both our steaks were very flavorful and cooked to perfection. For our sides, we shared asparagus and a loaded baked potato. \n\nWe could not pass on dessert. I had to have Morton's Legendary Hot Chocolate Cake and BJ had the Key Lime Pie. The chocolate cake was amazing, I love it. So did BJ.  He ate it instead of his pie.  We got the pie to go and it was also very, very good. \n\nGreat place for a special occasion. We had a wonderful evening.",5
2407,Great place  . My favorite steak reaturant in Pittsburgh . The bar area could be bigger . The valet's were professional and quick .,5
2408,I know I'm a steak snob but I found this Mortons perfectly adequate. The service was just okay. We asked our waiter for a recommendation on a side dish and he not only forgot to bring it but also what we ordered!  And you think they were bottling it themselves when we asked for a second bottle of wine. The only saving grace was the chocolate mousse which was a little cup of whipped heaven.,2
2409,I can't wait for the day I walk away from a $120/person steak dinner feeling like I got what I paid for.  This wasn't it.,3
2410,"I came here for my birthday dinner.  I was not impressed at all.  First off, we sat at the booth near where the host has his podium.  He seemed to be in a bad mood and made us feel uncomfortable.  \n\nI did like the nice touch of having my name printed on the menu and service by our waitress was good.  However, food wise, it was just OK and a bit disappointing.  I of course had filet, and I was just so underwhelmed with it.  The flavor was meh and the black truffle butter was surprisingly boring.  \n\nAfter this experience, I have no desire to ever come to this restaurant again.",2
2411,"Unbelievable! We were in town for weekend and looked up the reviews in yelp for a nearby steakhouse. Service was top notch, wine list extensive and above all an excellent meal. Would definitely recommend it for a special occasion and great meal out.",4
2412,"Morton's, was without a doubt one of the original esteemed statehouse restaurants in America, often emulated by others.  Great they were, with superb steaks, outstanding service and old club style ambiance. This was always a top place for business and special occasion dining. Now it is not as much as it was for my money and taste based on a recent visit.\nThey are taken over by a very large mega restaurant chain corporation. Landry's, who are owners of over 35 restaurants and chains many you would be familiar with now own Morton's too. Morton's no longer has a focus on their original identity, meaning and purpose but are being changed in a modernized way. On my last visit changes were visible. Some changes and cost cutting and commercializing has begun. The menu is changed to include items which will appeal to a broader clientele. Now profits and growth are a bigger part of the strategy. \nGone is the famous GM Bill. Bill was as much an institution as the restaurant he ran. Changed too seem to be the quality of the steaks. Our ribeyes were not a recognizable ribeye cut and the taste was not there as we remembered. One of three steaks came out drastically overcooked although the error was quickly remedied with a properly cooked replacement.\nI just hate to see the continuing commercialization of our esteemed restaurants in America.",2
2413,I ordered the center-cut ribeye for entree. It was delicious. \nThe environment is nice and servers are polite. Recommended.,5
2414,"We've eaten a number of superb meals at the Morton's in Cincinnati, and were eagerly looking forward to a sumptious dinner at Morton's in Pittsburgh. Oh boy. The ambiance is more like a Wendy's that tries to be upscale: cramped, busy, somewhat noisy. Of the two filet mignons we had (different sizes, medium rare) one was horribly overcooked, the other one a little on the rare side. The meat wasn't special. The deserts were OK but the Creme Brulee was bland in the extreme. Service was OK but occasionally inattentive. For two adults, one child, a check of $150 would have been reasonable for the quality provided. It ended up being $350 or so. Oh well - I rounded up the check to $400 and left with the intention of never coming back again. Imagine my shock when I found that my credit card had been charged with $600! I'm sure this will turn out to be an innocent mistake, but if this restaurant thinks it provides an experience worth $200 per head, they need to call Chef Ramsey.",1
2415,I love this Morton's. .the staff is great and the food is amazing..the ribeye was great and scallops wrapped bacon amazing,5
2416,"This is definitely an old school hang out with a classic menu.   Although my steak was cooked perfectly,  I can't speak to the quality of the ingredients as they lacked natural flavour of meat and fish that I love.   My biggest gripe, though, would be the overcooked scallops.  If you are an adventure Eater or like common things cooked in uncommon ways, I would skip this one.",2
2417,"We made a reservation and were told that seating was on time, we waited 15 minutes past our reservation time to be seated. The food was awful, my pregnant fianc\u00e9 ordered a filet medium rare that came out medium well!  Who cooks a filet medium well?  My father-in-laws strip was so over seasoned he could barely eat it.  But since we waited over an hour for our food, he had to eat it.  Our reservation was for 8:15 and we did not eat until after 10:00.  We all ordered medium rare steaks and one lobster tail.  It should not take over an hour to prepare.  The filet was taken off the bill, however, that does not help the fact that a pregnant women had to wait so long to eat and when it came out she didn't even eat.  I shared mine with her as did her dad share his, but as mentioned above, his steak was awful too.  My Cajun ribeye was good and so was my mother-in-laws lobster.  We ordered chocolate souffl\u00e9 for dessert and it didn't even have chocolate on it.  It tasted like scrambled eggs with whipped cream.  I have to tell you that was by far one of the worst dining experiences we have had.  The four of us eat out together once a week and tend to go to more \""pricey\"" restaurants.  This was terrible and I am sure we do not plan on returning.",1
2418,"Refined, classic style steak restaurant, Mortons will not disappoint those who are looking for a traditional upper end place. \n\nYards of linen, tons of silverware, and hordes of waiters make this place a must go in Pittsburgh.\n\nOur table of six enjoyed perfectly done steaks and fillets, beautiful accompaniments of vegetables and potatoes, great salads,  excellent desserts, along with an impressive wine offering.  \n\nExpect to pay heavily for this experience, it is well worth it.",5
2419,"Wow, not so much.  I haven't been to a Morton's in years, but was happy to be going back for a business dinner.  I thought the service was exceptional, but the food was mediocre at best.  The filet that I ordered was cooked to perfection, a nice portion, and tender as can be -- but absolutely no taste.  Nothing.  Nothing discernible at all.  I can tell you that with all of the above and no taste, it was all for naught.  Unrelated and not the blame of the server, of course -- again, service was great -- one of my colleagues found a piece of hard plastic in his veal chop.  He thought the veal chop was great, but wasn't real excited about the plastic in his dish, which the server promptly removed from the bill.  I brought another colleague's salmon home with me and heated it up the next day.  Oddly enough, a beautiful piece of salmon -- absolutely NO flavor.  Very strange experience.  I doubt I'll ever return.  Coincidentally, the place was empty on a Thursday evening.",2
2420,"How this place got 4 stars when there are so many better options in Pittsburgh is beyond me.  The only thing that was noteworthy about the experience here was the price. The food was bland. Nothing to write home about. The place looks uppity, but really the food is just ok. Go to Ruth's Chris instead.",2
2421,Came here with my family for my fathers birthday. This place had it right from the start. Amazing menu. I had a porterhouse with lobster tail (same thing my father got) and we were both pleased! The staff was very very good and helpful. Everything we got to eat that night was 5 stars and exceeded all expectations. Cannot wait to go back!,5
2422,"If you're not looking careful enough, you could miss New Sambok Oriental Foods on Penn. It's a very small Korean market, very hole-in-the-wall Strip storefront, on the corner of Penn and 18th St. \n\nThere is a decent selection of your typical Korean products, snacks, drinks, red pepper, ready made sides, and ramen. They sell kimchi which I bought once, to save time, and it didn't go to waste. If you're not used to old style Asian markets, you might have second thoughts about shopping here, it's a little on the dark side lighting wise, and small. \n\nOn the weekends, the owner cooks Korean snacks on the sidewalk in front of the store, my fave is the Korean pancake with kimchi sprouts. The owners are a friendly, older couple. Not the worst store I've ever been too, I've been to better. Can't complain too much since there isn't a large Korean population in Pittsburgh. Just be sure to look for best by dates, since turnover is probably pretty slow.",2
2423,"This review is for the Sam Bok food stand.  I found a review (kind of) for it but I feel as though it's good enough to have its own review.  PLUS, my gal from China Express (now closed, was downtown) cooks there, so I had to make it happen.\n\nThis place is simple.  It has chicken on a stick, mung bean pancakes, & I think some sort of spring roll.  The only thing I've ever tried is the chicken on a stick, and really, it's all I need.  these little thingers are delicious, and they're only $3.  \n\nThey have two different sauces to dump on it, and I get it with both; one is some sort of Korean BBQ sauce & the other is just Sriracha.  Then it's wrapped in foil, and handed off.  Make sure you get extra napkins, as they're messy.  Any time I run to the strip to get a few staples, I inevitably swing through and get a chicken on a stick.  You should too...you won't regret it.",4
2424,They carry a good selection of soy sauces and have decent prices for bulk rice. Do note that there is a $10 minimum on debit/credit card usage.,3
2425,"I was first introduced to Korean food my freshman year in college. It was a match made in kimchi heaven. This love affair has now extended to the Korean culture and language. Sam Bok is the perfect venue to get anything Korean cuisine related and has some wonderful Ahjummas (ladies) who will let you try out you newly mastered though limited skills at speaking Korean. \n\nI love making my own kimchi chigae - not proficient enough to make my own kimchi though. Sam Bok sells really good cabbage and radish kimchi that you can pick up anytime. It's available in several sizes. I also like their black bean sauce, yam noodle packets, spices and spicy ramyun packets (Asian ramen that will blow your socks off). I recently picked up a couple of bread rolls with cream filling which is a Korean delicacy that satisfies your sweet and savory cravings. Sam Bok's bread was wonderful, I will definitely go back for more of those. \n\nI suggest giving Sam Bok a shot, it's unique, local and always inviting.",4
2426,"$3 chicken on a stick. The best value I know of in Pittsburgh and one of the tastiest things I can think of eating. Love that stuff and get it every time I'm in Pitt early enough to make it to the Strip District. They have a little table outside you can sit and eat at as well. The grocery store is alright, but I have no clue what most the stuff in there is, I always just go for the chicken.",5
2427,"I come here for chicken on a stick & mung bean pancakes every time I am in the Strip District. I don't know what else to say about it besides that it's awesome--everything is prepared quickly and the little Korean woman who I always see working the stand is very pleasant. I always recommend the food here to everyone I know whenever they say they're going to the Strip. It's cheap and delicious. This would be a five star rating if I wasn't considering the grocery store, but this place IS indeed a grocery store and not just a street vendor (unfortunately). \nThe grocery store is very poorly organized, things are dusty, and many of the things don't have expiration dates. That's actually pretty typical of imported Asian food, but I was really skeptical about buying anything from the grocery store because no one really shops here (there are better competitors down the street, like Lotus Food Co) and that means that the food remained on the shelf for who knows how long. The first time my friend and I came here, she purchased a pack of mango mochi ice cream and found that it had freezer burn and smelled a bit off as well. The store manager/owner kindly refunded the purchase, which was nice, but I would still never buy anything. Also, compared to Lotus Food Co, some of the items in this store are more expensive. The mochi ice cream was definitely more expensive--I can't remember exactly how much, but after we realized that we bought a bad item, we went to Lotus Food Co and bought a box of mochi ice cream that was perfectly fine, delicious, and less expensive.",4
2428,"I am the dork-ie kid from your kindergarten  class. Who has been wearing glasses since I was 5 years old so please take this review seriously.  I know my way around a pair of eyeglasses.  Wow am  I getting old , that would mean I have been wearing eye glasses for 20 years.  \n\nDo me , you and everyone you care about a favor and avoid this location.  The service is here so incredibly inconsistent.  I have nothing,  I mean nothing good do say about the service that I have received here .The eye glass assistants are rude.  The way you are treated is sub par.  America's Best (I even hesitate to use that name because it's obviously not the best in America) just sucks.  \n\n Due to my terrible eye site I have to spend EXTRA money for thin lens.  So normally what I do is,  once a year I shell out $200.00  no insurance to buy two pair of glasses, paying cash.  The frames are alright but nothing that great. \n\nBesides my lens not being great another thing I  have a problem with is the poor customer service. On more then one occasion through out the years I have been talked down to. \n\n I have been wearing my current prescription from AB for about 10 months. This prescription is not good for me, before I had a magnified prescription that made everything BIGGER. My poor little blind self I have an astingamstism in both eyes.

2429,From the previous reviews that I read I know exactly who people are talking about.  I rarely give a one or two stars. The customer service here is horrible.  I feel like everything I say is wrong.  I felt rushed when selecting my frames.  They changed me $10 more than what the price was marked on the frame.  When I pointed that out I got an attitude.,2
2430,"Edit:  A customer service representative from the central office called me and was able to arrange a refund with the manager of the Pittsburgh location. Still, I think this location only deserves one star, considering one of their employees actually lied to me about the return policy, saying all sales were final, while another one said \""I don't know what you're talking about\"" when I tried to explain my problem. Very poor customer service at this location. \n\nDespite what it says on their website (30-day return policy), this location refuses to take returns, even for a defective product. I got a set of eyeglasses here which have reflections all across the field of vision. They're barely usable due to this. If I sit near a bright window, I have three reflections which show up in each lens.  These reflections go directly across the center of my field of vision.  $200 down the drain. Buyer beware.",1
2431,"Ugh - so I went here this morning and while there was nothing wrong with the food (just got apple cinnamon oatmeal - review on that later) the cashier was bothering me.  I mean it's freaking 7:45 AM in the morning - just let me pay for my damn oatmeal and get to work!  \n\nThere was NO ONE else in line, therefore no one in front of me and I'm standing in front of the cashier waiting to pay...now get this...I'm standing there, debit card in hand, while she's completing a text message.  And it's not like she just needs to press \""send\"" oh no - there's is content getting written before my eyes as I wait there, and I'm thinking to myself is this really happening, who the hell could she be texting this early, and why the hell is she making me wait while she completes the content of a text message.  \n\nNow, I realize that ABP (Au Bon Pain) isn't some uber-professional establishment, but I'm thinking this should be in customer service 101 - stop texting while a customer is waiting to pay for item, you may resume texting after customer(s) are gone.  \n\nThe oatmeal was tasty - and I like that they have a self-serve topping area (containers filled with nuts, cranberries, raisins, brown sugar, granola).  They had a choice between plain and apple cinnamon oatmeal - I went for the apps cinn mush - good stuff.  If only they could train their employees better.",2
2432,Decent food but a little overpriced. They will make you a salad (you can choose 3 items) and a meat for $7.49.  You get a bread stick too. You can also get overpriced soup or a sandwich.  Lots of choices.  The cookies and scones and pastries are on the high end; similar to Panera.  Average tasting at best.  I wouldn't call this bakery fresh.  They are all over Pittsburgh.,3
2433,Ordered soup today for $5.19 and they charged me $1.19 baguette which you usually get for free with a salad. Surprised it didn't come with the soup.  Soup was decent (Chicken Noodle).  They have about 8 choices each day.  This place is a gold mine with limited nearby options outside of Qdoba and Mcdonalds and a few pizza places.  Add an iced tea and the bill is almost $10.

2434,"You mean I can have a nice pecan roll--all 740 calories, 85 grams of carbs, & 48 grams of sugar of it?  Whoo-hoo!  Pump that insulin, Susan!  Pump!\n\nActually I didn't get that calorie bomb.  I came here for lunch today with a co-worker and had a somewhat more sane chicken salad sandwich.  My sandwich was good, but was about the same as any at ABP, Panera Bread, etc.",3
2435,"Ahh... ABP. How I wish there were less of you downtown and more of pretty much any other restaurant.\n\nI met a friend here recently for lunch. Even though I arrived a few minutes before noon, the dining room did not look particularly clean as all the tables were covered in crumbs. The food was pretty good.... My tomato soup was tasty, and my baguette was nice and soft. They also carry my favorite chip brand, Food Should Taste Good. Stay away from the peach tea as it's dangerously good.",3
2436,"This location is much better than some of the other downtown Pittsburgh locations, but only because the guy who makes my create your own salads is really really friendly. I love that you can create your own salad; however, for $7.99, I wish the lettuce was always at the peak of freshness. It sometimes is, it sometimes isn't.\n\nI like the variety of soups; however, if you want mac and cheese, come early because they always run out of it. The tuscan bean is good, as is the tomato bisque.\n\nThe roast beef with herbed cheese on a baguette is my favorite sandwich, and this one has never every let me down.\n\nPerhaps if the prices were a little lower, I would be more satisfied with the quality of the food.",3
2437,"I stayed at the Pennsylvanian for about a month in one of the Corporate Apartments.  This place is old.  I believe it used to be a hub for trains and buses.\n\nThe outside looks nice but the hallways to the rooms look a little dingy.  There was mildew on the floors of my bathroom and bathtub.  The washer and dryer was old.  There was rust on some of the door hinges.  The dresser, fixtures, coffee table, dining table, and dining chairs looked new and modern.  The carpet for the most part was clean.  The sofa looked old and was not comfortable.  The bedsheets had yellow stains on them.  I did not use the comforter and one of the layers.  The Pennsylvanian has a maid service option with 1 week or 2 week intervals.  I am not sure if they even changed or washed my bedsheets because they all had the same yellow stains?  wtf?\n\nThe views from the apartment is nice, but the windows are hard to see through since the window screens are dirty.\n\nThe kitchen is ok.  The corporate apartment comes with a fullsized fridge, dishwasher, coffee maker, silverware, platewear, pots and pans.  There is also an iron and ironing board.  There is also a 22 inch? CRT-TV with about 100 cable channels.  I had a router for internet but it was taken away from me 2 weeks into my stay.  The Pennsylvanian claimed Comcast took it away without even telling me.  They did not offer me a chance to pay for it.\n\nThe fitness room was nice.  There are treadmills, elliptical machines, pullup bars, and other various machines.  There are even a few sets of dumbells.  I never used the sauna, so I cannot comment on that.\n\nThere is a 24 hour concierge that is always helpful and friendly.  There is also an option to sign up for a dry-cleaning service, which is outsourced to another company.  You drop your dirty clothes into a room and pick it up a few days later after it has been cleaned.  This is rather expensive as well.  Everyone who has a dry-cleaning Key has access to this room.  Thieves could come in and steal your clothes.\n\nIf I had an option, I would not stay at the Pennsylvanian again.",2
2438,"I really like this Saks. It's close to my job so I am in there all the time! \n\nAntoine takes care of me with my clothing purchases every time I am there. Tom is my guy for Bond no.9. He sends out postcards telling me about new Bond fragrances and in store Bond events all the time. He always is hooking me up with a free sample when I come in! Reshonda is my girl for all other fragrances. If I want to try something and they don't have a sample she will make me one right on the spot! Now that's service! \n\nI would give the store a 5 put the interior SUCKS! It is too small and needs a major updating. It looks like Kaufmann's, Gimbel's or Horne's from back in the 80's. The fragrance counter is too small. The men's section is down in the basement and only half of the floor is men's. The rest is house ware. The majority of the men's section is suits. Can we get some Gucci or Prada clothing not just shoes? They really need to expand or move across the street to the old Lord & Taylor building!",4
2439,"Much like the rest of Pittsburgh, lots of friendly folks staffing the place.  And unlike California, no tax on clothes!!  There was a smallish selection, but all major Saks-quality brands were there -- theory, DVF, Marc Jacobs, Prada, etc.. Good amt of sale items in each department.\n\nSadly, after 60 years the store is moving out late next year.. Sad loss for DT Pittsburgh.",3
2440,"Fair well old friend. You will be greatly missed. After being in downtown Pittsburgh for 60 years, Saks Fifth Avenue is now closed. :(",4
2441,"I never really shopped here because of the downtown location, but I am sad to see it go. Now Nordstrom is the only upscale department chain we have, but it just isn't as magical as window shopping at Saks and wishing you could afford more than the cosmetics and the clearance rack. RIP :'(\n\n(I did score an Alexander Wang bag for only $350 during the liquidation sale, so some good came out of it.)",3
2442,"Don't waste your time.1- they dont sell regular paper and hardly have poster paper.2- its really hard to find any thing of use. Most things are archaic and not in a cool vintage way.3- the owner is a bitch. During park(ing) day 2010 she waited 3 hours before coming out and telling the artist \"" i find what you are doing is discussing. I dont support your tree hugger shit....\"" extraordinarily rude.",1
2443,"I went here around noon one day in search of an ink pad, which I thought would be a pretty standard item for a stationery store.  (Turns out I was wrong.)  The store was such a cramped, crowded mess that I had to ask for help to find what I was looking for, but was hesitant to do so because I felt so awkward interrupting the four employees sitting at a table in a corner, eating leftover pasta and engrossed in conversation, ignoring me and the several other customers who were browsing.  When I finally got the courage to ask about the ink pad, the workers all looked at each other as if to say \""Who's going to handle this?\"" before one of them grudingly got up to search for an ink pad that, as it turned out, \""didn't come in with the shipment\"".  As if Pittsburgh was a hot market for ink pads and they go through their entire supply every week.",1
2444,"I stopped in because they have knitting supplies. I immediately saw a beautiful cat (they have several in this shop). Being a owner of several cats and extreme lover of all animals, I went over to see the cat. The cat let me pet it and followed me around yowling for attention. I picked up the cat to hold and the man that works there was very rude and ripped the cat away from me. I will NEVER NEVER go back to a store that treats animals or animal lovers that way. The shop isn't that great anyway.",1
2445,Charming store with high quality items.  I've purchased business cards and placesetting cards. The staff was very attentive and detail oriented. Great customer service.,5
2446,"Such a shame because this place has so much potential for being a cool little local business. But the owners/managers are the rudest, most disdainful people who seemed almost gleeful for me to leave without purchasing something. I went in to purchase either some classy paper or a unique card to write a note to a homeowner to whom I was considering placing a purchase offer for their house. It's a stationary store, so I didn't think my request was unusual. The products there were outdated, in many cases even dusty, overpriced (which honestly, I would have paid a local business if the product had been unique and quality), and disorganized. I was asked if I needed help, to which I replied yes and explained my situation, and a very curt man stood in a back corner and pointed to various corners of the store and said, \""Look there and there and there and there,\"" AND THEN HE WALKED OUT OF THE STORE.\n\nI'll seriously never step foot in Weldin's again, and felt it necessary to post publicly about the experience. Such a shame.\n\nBTW, I found a delightful card next door at CVS. It was made of wood. Very unique. Go figure. ;)",1
2447,"A heavy hand touches everything at Mama Lucia's, unfortunately their generosity with toppings and serving sizes end up hurting the final product. I stopped in for lunch and ordered 2 slices (one with pepperoni and olives the other with mushrooms and sausage) and a side salad. Both slices were a nice size, however, the way they were served created an awkward eating situation. Rather than topping two individual slices they topped half of a 4 cut pizza to match my order. The slices were also an odd shape, essentially they were the chode of the pizza world (wider than they were long). This made it nearly impossible to pick them up and eat them by hand without getting sauce from ear to ear. They also violated my number 1 pizza sin and overloaded the slices with cheese. This made for a doughy center were the crust was slightly undercooked. \n\nTheir over loading of the cheese didn't stop at the pizza. My side salad came topped with an honest cup and a half of mozerella cheese. Underneath the white blanket there was a huge handful of red onion, a tomatoe slice, and some bland iceburg. On a positive note, they do make a great homemade vinegarette.\n\nEach day of the week they have a $3 lunch special. One of my co-workers always goes on Wednesday for their lasagna (a portion that may not fit in a shoe box). I'd try Mama Lucia's again for a sandwich or pasta, but I'm staying away from the pizza and salad.",3
2448,"Great pricing on food! A hoagie, fries, & drink is $6 & some change. They have different daily specials for each day of the week. Monday= 6in meatball... wed =I love the buffalo chicken horead agie and chicken parm hoagie. Their calzones look good. I often order a cash fry (chicken, fries and melted mozzarella cheese. You can add veggies for a small price) Also, if they seem full downstairs, the entire 2nd floor is seating. No worries!",4
2449,"Not worth your money.  Poor service, worn interior, A/C was non-functional, THE CD PLAYER DIDN'T WORK, AND THERE WAS NO AUXILIARY JACK.\n\nThey get two start because they managed to get us from Point A to Point B without making us fear for our lives.",2
2450,"Peppi's did not leave me peppy.  The wait for a cheesteak sandwich was just too long.  I came here after the lunch rush and still waited around 20-25 minutes.\n\nThe sandwich was o.k.  I got the steak special which includes, beef, cheese, onions, peppers, lettuce, and mayo.  The meat comes frozen in a rectangled thin patty.  It is fried, then chopped up, and ingredients added.  Half of my fries were burnt and the other half was soggy.\n\nThe restaurant is a typical dive and has many Pittsburgh Steelers paraphernalia.",3
2451,"You just gotta have a Peppi's hoagie...especially on your way to a Steelers game.  The guy stands under the bridge near Reedsdale shouting, \""Peppi's.....hoagies....\""  They are damn good.  Talk it into the stadium and enjoy :)",4
2452,"I have eaten at the one on the Strip, and the one on the North Shore across from Nicky's Thai.  Both are great.  All I ever get is the steak with American cheese with onions and mushrooms.  They ask if you want tomatoes mayo and lettuce.  Have no idea why, that stuff should never be on a cheese steak sandwhich.\n\nAnyways, much better than Primanti's for a cheese steak.  primanti's you go to if you want say a steak hoagie (which is not steak but actually one of those rectangular seasoned beef patties on a hoagies roll.  Get that at Primantis with a fried egg, and fries and slaw, and you got a good sammy).\n\nFor a cheese steak, this is the only place in Pittsburgh to go.  Peppi's.",4
2453,"These sandwiches are amazing. They fill you up, they're delicious, and it's chill place to go and eat. A must try.",5
2454,"A staple of downtown work lunch. Excellent cheesesteaks, fresh fries, and a great crew of workers.\n\nA Pittsburgh classic in it's own, Peppi's is a must-eat cheesesteak destination in the downtown area.  I've been to Peppi's in the Strip and the North Shore and unfortunately they don't quite stack up (still good though).",5
2455,"I recently started working in \""Dahn Tahn\"" Pittsburgh and have started venturing out at lunch.  This week some guys took me to Peppi's and I was certainly not disappointed.  The place is totally a dive and has tasty dive food.  I had the cheesesteak and really enjoyed it.  I'll certainly be back again.  Unfortunately when I compare this place to the Oakland Uncle Sam's cheesesteak.... well there really is no comparison.  So Peppi's you will certainly do when I am down town... take your three stars and wear it proudly.",3
2456,"Overall, a friendly and fast environment. Great music always playing on the speakers during the lunch rush hours, marked by good service/communication by the employees to customers. Fantastic food at all four locations; is a great place to walk down to on your lunch break/late afternoon hunger. Reasonably priced food, with a 'chill' atmosphere.",4
2457,"Peppi's rocks! Why do I say that you ask? Let me explain.. \n\nI was walking down Smithfield during my Friday lunch, which is later than my lunch during the rest of the week & I'm realllllly hungry!  I head down to Peppi's after hearing so many people rave about it.\n\n While walking into Peppi's I think I took a step back in time because every worker is literally jamming to \""Funky Town\"" & I'm at a dive sandwich shop. All of the workers were extremely friendly & happy (what's your secret?! I need to know!) \n\nThe cheese steak was delish & I'm pretty excited that I can get grilled onions without an awkward up charge. A cheese steak, fresh cut fries & a drink comes to $8.. extremely reasonable. I ended up only eating half of the hoagie & enjoyed the rest later in the day. \n\nThe staff were chatting & joking with me again as I was leaving. I must say for a lunch by myself I laughed a great deal during that hour. I'll be back!",4
2458,A good spot for a cappuccino on a Sunday morning. Expect a good crowd and enjoy sitting outside at their wrought iron chairs and tables watching the Strip activity.,4
2459,"Wonderful selection of _Real_ espresso drinks; espressos, machiatos, cappucinos etc. Awesome La Cimbali machine, friendly staff. No frills standing tables to drink your espresso the way it's done in Italy. Highly recommended!!!",4
2460,"The coffee isn't bad, but it's not a destination spot, especially with 21st Street Coffee two blocks away.  If it's raining and you're caught at the public market down aways from 21st street, it's worth the cup.",3
2461,Best latte and cappucino's! ... Although the one from last Tuesday was a bit eh. I grab a couple bags of Paulie's Blend every time I'm back in town for my friends in Houston and they always love it.,4
2462,"I went down to the strip last week and thought a mocha sounded great. Well I can't write a review on that drink because the employee dropped a dime in my drink. I was expecting her to offer to make me a new one since she was the one the dropped it in there, but instead all I got a was blank stare. \n\nThe coffee shop down the street had great coffe and they don't drop anything in there as well.",1
2463,"The best place for coffee!!! I love everything about this place.. The atmosphere, the neighborhood feel, the baristas, and the patrons (especially the little Italian men sitting outside playing cards drink espressos). A huge favorite place in my book!!!",5
2464,Surprisingly authentic and inexpensive Italian coffee shop in a downtown area. I heard actual Italian spoken here with a news channel from the motherland on the TV. The place was packed on a Saturday afternoon and appeared to satisfy everyone who stood inside. My espresso was just as good as those I had in Europe. Hats off to La Prima!,4
2465,"As close as you will get to an authentic Italian cafe in Pittsburgh (or most anywhere in the U.S.).  This is one of my favorite spots in the city.  The coffee is superb, the baristas are friendly and skilled.  Sam, the owner, is almost always around to greet regulars and newcomers alike.  A dopio (double) cappuccino with a slice of pizza from Colangelo's next door is a perfect way to spend a Saturday morning.  What completes this place is the atmosphere.  On any given Saturday morning the space is packed, spilling over to the outdoor seating.  On a shelf above the coffee machines in the upper left corner has a television permanently tuned to REI, the Italian television station.  There's usually a futbol game or some Italian news broadcast playing.  Without fail there will be these elderly Italian gentlemen playing a traditional card game in the corner.  For a great cup of coffee made however you like and the atmosphere of an authentic Italian cafe, go to La Prima Espresso.",5
2466,"Easily the best espresso I have had in town. \n\nPrevious reviewers are correct - if you are used to the idea of a coffee shop that the local and national chains have given us, there really isn't room for that there. However, the coffee is second to none and for those of you that like to make your coffee at home, they do sell a wide selection of their beans at a reasonable price compared to other coffee shops.",5
2467,"I used to buy La Prima espresso for my Pavoni all the time so I was pretty excited to actually get a cup of coffee here.  I ordered a cappuccino.  It tasted like milk and no coffee.  I was exceptionally disappointed.  So while the place has a great reputation,  even they can screw it up if they don't pay attention to detail, and  at this level they should never screw it up. I had a better cup at Martys Market for crying out loud!",2
2468,Pastries and coffee you can't go wrong. You'll need to get here early if craving an almond croissant.. they tend to sell out by noon. Their other pastries are delicious as well. Try the mele as well. You can wash it all down with an expresso or what I like is an expresso macchiato!,5
2469,I have fond memories of this place.  I was truly introduced to Italian Expresso and dry Italian snack pastries etc. Coming from small town Ohio and moved to the big city of Pittsburgh in the mid 90's I did not understand but got to know their product line.  My best friend at the time worked for LPE for about 7-8 years and traveled around to all of their Pittsburgh branches.  I have been to them all.  Hard working family owned  I have a fondness in my heart for this coffee.  Ground right when you order. I remember the friends and the family sitting out front until close on a Saturday afternoon parlare italiano in front of the store.  K sitting out front with her table of illustrated greeting cards. It was always packed on Saturday. I will probably add an addendum as I remember more.,5
2470,"Out of 200 reviews, I've written only 14 1 star reviews.  that's .07%.  That means I never really write 1 star reviews.  La Prima Espresso in the Strip District gets one.  :(\n\nThey've got a good coffee but I will never be back, bc the older woman who is the barista in the morning was unforgivably rude, without reason.\n\nThe coffee is good, I would have liked to become a regular, but I dont want to start every morning dealing with her nasty attitude.  Yesterday she rolled her eyes at me when I asked for lots of room for cream.\n\nI am a former barista.  I *know* asking for room for cream is not one of the more difficult special requests she gets!  If you hate the public, you shouldn't work with them.\n\nThis morning takes the cake, and I just won't be back.  Here's what happened:  \n\nI walked in, and she was talking to a gentleman who was obviously a regular.  Because she was busy and bc I've barista'd myself, I waited patiently.\n\nAnd waited and waited.  It was a few minutes, but an eternity when you really need coffee!\n\nShe never even looked at me.  Then all of a sudden she goes, \""Okay lady are you going to stand there or do you want coffee?\""  \n\nWTF.  I liked her sense of urgency, but seriously?  Rude.\n\nI asked for a medium coffee in a large cup, or if that's not possible, a medium coffee with lots of room. \n\nNot hearing me, she goes, \""What was that?\"" and the older gentleman said, \""She wants a medium sized coffee in a large cup.\""  And the woman turns to me and snaps, \""And you couldn't repeat that yourself?\""\n\nEven the guy she was talking to, her regular, was like, \""Whoa.\""  He tried to make some excuse for her, like, \""She's just fired up today!\""  Then the woman slams my coffee down on the counter.  \n\nWas she having a bad day?  Am I the doppleganger of someone she hates?  I dont know, I don't care.  I believe she may be the owner because surely she should have been fired by now, as there are other posts with complaints about her. \n\n\""Do not go here during the week if you expect them to open on time. I was there today and it was 615am and there was no employees at all. Managed very poorly. The older lady with a short hair cut is the one who doesn't open on time when she is scheduled. Please move this lady to a different time. 6am is too early for her.\""\n\n I won't ever be back.  If that's just her spunky personality, well, her personality sucks.  \n\nSeriously lady, you're not a morning person.  You should ask for later shifts.",1

It's the 18+ club, so you'll get lots of attitude and pretentiousness, but in exchange you get lots of eye candy. \n\nDrinks are expensive, and it's only busy here on Fridays. But it's the only real gay dance club Pittsburgh has and as such it fills a niche nicely. \n\nOccasionally electro or goth type bands perform here as well.",3

But if you're looking for a wild drag show and cheap drinks head to Blue Moon in L-Ville on Butler Street",2
2475,"I came here on a Saturday night as a birthday bash. There really weren't very many people at this club and most of the people who were here were very young guys. Hell, I even ran into a guy in the ladies room. lol He got confused because the doors didn't have signs that said \""men\"" or \""women\"". Instead just the Greek symbol for male/female adorn the restroom enterance. The atmosphere was fun, yhe crowd rather easy going. Drinks were expensive and as I handle my alcohol well, my \""date\"" paid a premium price to get me my birthday buzz. The dj played techno, and every 4th song was a Lady Gaga song. NO KIDDING! There was a male stripper who performed 2 times that night, stripping down to his pervocative undies. Not the best place to pick up a date, but good for some dancing and fun. \n\nI am a PROUD supporter of the GLBT community and you can't change my mind so no hate mail. Thanks.",3
2476,"I am so absolutely disappointed that Pegasus closed! The name has been around for so long and many people know of it, even if they've never stepped foot in it. Pegasus was an amazing bar/club to go to to dance, socialize and roam their 3-4 floors. The dance floor was spacious and there were so many places to go if you grew tired of dancing! I never had one bad night at Pegasus! Every night there was an amazing adventure! The staff was great and the people there were so much fun! I met some great people there and the crowd was almost always friendly and fun. I really hope that Pegasus comes back because Pittsburgh needs it!",5
2477,"I'd had a nail appointment set for several weeks - a first time customer.  Less than an hour before the appointment I got a call canceling it.  Not from the owner apologizing for the cancellation or trying to correct the situation somehow, but from the nail tech.  She told me the owner insisted that SHE call her clients herself to tell them she had \""personal problems\"" that day and couldn't make it.  Wow.  The lack of professionalism astounded me.  \n\nOn the positive side, I'm glad I had the experience BEFORE what may have been the worst nail experience of my life.  Imagine how the \""personal problems\"" may have affected the work.  I called the salon to let them know of my disappointment in being left high and dry.  They simply didn't care.  They lost a customer....not just for nails, but for all the other services they offer.  Not the best way to run a \""service\"" business!",1
2478,I have had several negative experiences trying to find a good salon in the last year. Today I finally found a wonderful salon with an excellent stylist. Emily was very professional and friendly while highlighting and coloring my hair. She listened to exactly what I wanted and really did a fantastic job. I am very appreciative to her hard work and would definitely recommend this salon to everyone!,5
2479,"Worst Brazilian wax I have ever gotten. Extremely Painful and inefficient, still had a red welt 3 days later. She also used the same stick the entire time which is not sanitary. Eyebrow waxing is significantly overpriced at $18. Do not go here for waxing!",1
2480,"We came here to see the play \""You say Tomato I Say Shut Up!\"" and what fun we had! The stage is visible from any seat, the waitress was never too far and the food was satisfying. We really had a great time and enjoyed watching a play while eating and drinking. Great time and we can't wait to come back for another show.",5
2481,"I happened upon this place for an elite event.  Would I go back...yes!   Would I be glad that I now know these little tidbits...yes!\n\n-  They serve food before the event...all of it looked good and the prices were pretty average.  \n-  They serve drinks at the bar out front and also provide table service; BUT when the show starts, the table service stops.   So if you want to drink later in the show, you need to plan ahead or get up and go to the bar.    \n-  Some of the seats are tables and some are rows.   The tables are pretty nice.   I liked the raised platform area, but those chairs lacked arms that the ones on the floor had.   I think I'd go with the raised bar tables on each side next time.   \n-  They bring around the checks after the show.  If you don't want to wait forever, ask for the check early (before the show) or bring cash.  \n\nFour stars instead of five because the will call staff was really rude.   I won free tickets (plural) or so I thought.   When I went to will call, there was only one ticket.   I asked about it, but she was super unhelpful.   I ended up having to buy another ticket, which was at a different table, because she wouldn't move my comped ticket.   Lesson of the day...skip the will call window.",4
2482,"Excellent casual business lunches - salads, sandwiches - always freshly prepared and consistent quality.  Family owned.",4
2483,"Buon Giorno is located very close to my workplace, so I often go here for lunch. \n\nThey offer three daily specials (usually a salad, a sandwich, and a pasta) in addition to their full menu. Generally, their food is \""good\"", not great.  \n\nI find most of their sandwiches and pastas to be a bit bland, especially those made with ricotta.  Instead of mixing ricotta with a sharper, saltier cheese (as one typically does in lasagna and/or filled pastas), Buon Giorno just sort of dumps it on top of penne and marinara sauce.  How boring. \n\nI enjoy their italian tuna salad (not the kind with mayo!) and wedding soup. All salads and soups come a few slices of Manini's bread, which never disappoints.  If you order a sandwich, you will receive a side of the risotto (usually either spinach, portabello mushroom, or spinach and feta). The spinach and feta rice is so good, my co-workers call it \""crack rice.\"" You always want more. \n\nAnother positive thing about Buon Giorno is their breakfast.  They make delicious breakfast sandwiches and frittatas. \n\nIt is safe to say that all the small plates and sides are excellent at Buon Giorno, while the main entrees are only so-so.  For a cafe that is only open for breakfast and lunch downtown, that's really all you need. But don't go to Buon Giorno expecting a high quality Italian meal.",3
2484,"I've never had a bad meal here. I usually come for lunch, whether it be a quick  bite or a more relaxing meal. They also have breakfast if you want a tastier egg, meat and cheese sandwich than your typical Dunkin or McDonalds excuse of a breakfast.  \n\nThe food comes out very quick out of respect for your time. It is most popular during the workday lunch rush. I would say that they are most famous for their salads and sandwiches. They are unique Italian/Greek creations with either feta or or red peppers on everything. I particularly love their pasta de la Sandra, which is a penne pasta with mushrooms, sausage & peppers in a balsamic blend. Yumm! The Italian soup and the turkey feta, hummus, pepper sandwich with risotto, are also among my favorites! \n\nSo go to Buon Giorno Cafe on your next lunch break to enjoy great service, a fresh meal, and at a very good price!",4
2485,"Probably the best, most thorough Chinese supermarket you'll find in Pittsburgh. They have most of your Chinese grocery needs at pretty decent prices.

Some of the fruit & other veggies def. not as fresh and would pass. \n\nWhat's Not There - Sadly couldn't find the usual variety of tofu products found at Ranch 99, standard produce (i.e., tomatoes, carrots, bell peppers), no fresh meat \n\nGrocery List - dried fish, miso, lilly bulb, bok choy, baby napa cabbage, cilantro, green onion, garlic, shitake mushrooms, rice, couple bags of frozen dumplings, shao bing, frozen lotus bun, frozen shanghai veggie bun, rice, soba noodles, mochi, redbean pancake, hosin sauce, soy sauce, soybeans, jasmine tea, couple caned goods ~$70",3
2488,"PROS: nice variety including freshly made tofu, good amount of side street parking nearby (as long as you don't go on a weekend), baked goods (haven't tried any yet), on the strip so you can do some additional shopping if needed\n\nCONS: bit pricey, person working there wasn't that helpful or friendly",3
2489,"This store is a foodie find!  They stock lovely Asian veggies, sauces, meats, and desserts.  I mainly come here for garlic, ginger, and bok choy.  I heard they have some very good frozen dumplings though.  And they sell steaming hot fresh tofu for $0.30 a block, YES $0.30!!  Everything here is priced very reasonably.  \n\nThis is a great place to shop, but don't expect too much help from the staff.  Most things are not labeled in English, and the majority of the staff doesn't speak English, but hey that's half the fun!  You'll never know what gem you'll find.",4
2490,Fresh tofu towards the back is a must if you see them! Good selection of veggies and snacks. The workers could be more friendly and the environment could improve but this is the best place for Asian goods if you live in Pittsburgh. Come during the weekday or later in the day during weekends otherwise parking is almost impossible.,3
2491,Best Asian grocery in Pittsburgh. Went shopping for ingredients for a Korean dish I was making and they had everything. Food is fresh also!,5
2492,"The spruced man that stands by the main register is not well mannered. I was answered about a product I was looking for with a \""AH? I DON'T KNOW! MAYBE THERE!\"" brushed me off and pointed to the isle the product I wanted was at. Don't worry, I found it after looking for it for 10 minutes.\n\nAside from this impertinent man, the store seems to have a variety of products. They're always busy and their shelfs are stocked frequently. \n\nI was also told their tofu is fresh, so much so that a coworker of mine eats it raw. \n\nUnfortunately it's hard to find some products. Most packaging are in Asian writing and I don't understand it.",3
2493,"What irks me about this place is the rudeness.  I know this place is located in the Strip and it's suppose to be fast paced and all, but be polite to me if you intend for me to return.\n\nI will admit I did find some decent buys for the items I needed while in here, but had no idea where to find anything.  I roamed the aisles until I stumbled upon what I needed.  However, when I did find exactly what I needed, I had to wait for a congregation of people having their Sunday chat on a Thursday to move.  When I am in this type of situation I become very irritated very easily.\n\nAlso be sure to spend at least $5 or else be prepared to be told off at checkout.  That's the cherry on top of the rudeness cake.  Not quite sure the reasoning behind this action.  You're getting my money either way.",3
2494,"Lotus Food is still my go to for cheap vegetables, tofu and Asian ingredients however the workers aren't the friendliest - don't take it personal. I went to a register, said hi to the woman and she gave me a glazed over look, not scanning anything which confused me. Behind me comes another customer who apologies and tells me he forgot some items. I told him that I was sorry too as I was not aware that he was still being checked out and he replies \""You wouldn't have known\"" with a smile. And even through my transaction I continued to receive a glazed over look.",4
2495,I go to Lotus foods for the fresh chow mein noodles and the selection of Japanese pop.,4
2496,I found decent prices here and I did feel a little out of my element I couldn't understand the names on their packaging. I bought some bamboo spoons for 35 cents each. I love wooden spoons for my tea.,3
2497,"Put some time into learning how to shop this store and you will be greatly rewarded.  Excellent values all over the place, and things you can't find anywhere else.  I especially like the produce department.  \n\nLotus is one of only 4 stores I always have to shop when I visit the strip.",4
2498,This is a great Asian food store and they have a lot of fresh vegatables.,4
2499,"This is hands-down the best Asian grocery I have visited in Pittsburgh. It is a huge store and is really well-organized so you can find what you are looking for pretty quickly. The absolute best thing about this place is the fresh tofu. Besides tasting better than the stuff from the regular store, it is outrageously cheap--$1 for 3 pieces (3 pieces = about 1 & 1/2 blocks of packaged tofu) They have a great section of Asian-style noodles, snacks, and sauces, with the brand variety you will never get at a typical grocery store. They also have a really good selection of fresh produce that is hard to find in other stores.\n\nBe warned, the products do not always have English translations. This doesn't mean newbies aren't welcome, it just means you might make a few mistakes on the way. The store clerks are usually not very helpful because 1) this place runs on a very small staff and everyone is always busy, and 2) many of the employees don't speak English very well. The small staff is part of the reason this place is so cheap, so cut them a break. As for the language barrier--it's a traditional Asian grocery store, so yes, English is not their first language; don't be surprised. I don't consider these detriments because this store perfectly suits my needs. It is definitely not an introductory course in Asian cuisine, so don't expect anyone to hold your hand. But if you know what you are looking for, or if you are just feeling adventurous and willing to make a few mistakes, this place is worth a look.",5
2500,If I can give haft a star I would. Never shop at this Asian grocery since Many more open. Owner and employee alike no manners and nasty. Sorry guys it's the truth.,1
2501,"This is our stop right after Stan's Market for all the other \""uncommon\"" fresh produce. They offer a wide variety of fresh produce including some that are unfamiliar to most Pittsburghers. Besides produce,  they sell all sorts of asian packaged foods and goods.\n\nOur bi-monthly visit here is mostly for the super cheap fresh produce and tofu. Our list of Vegetables usually include the Mustard Green, few different types of bok-choy and spinach along with some herbs like cilantro, mint , basil etc. Like Stan's the vegetables here are super cheap and fresh but unlike Stan's you don't really need to double check them :) since they're usually very fresh and of good quality.\n\nIf you're not an avid cook - you might want to try some of the wide varieties of Ramen and packaged food this place has to offer.",4
2502,"I realized today that everyone should have a good tailor!  That realization came about from a trip to the lovely LuLu....\n\nI had an adorable vintage dress I had bought in Chicago last summer that was too large in all the wrong places and I kept putting off getting fixed.  I had a seamstress friend look at it and she was even stumped by the darts on the chest and how to exactly go about fixing it.  \n\nLuLu had be try the dress on and did a few simple markings and I was on my way.  She even encouraged me to make it a bit shorter, which I was on the fence about, but ultimately decided to do once she pinned it up.  I think a day or two later (after she had told me a week) she called to tell me it was done.  \n\nLet me tell you, the woman knows her way around a seam!  She worked her magic on that dress so that if fit be like a glove... it as beautiful!  I looked closer and could tell that she completely took apart the bodice to remake it so it fit me in the chest.  But she still kept the look of the dress so that the change was slight and still fit the style.  \n\nNow I'm mentally going through my closet thinking of all the things I'm excited to have her custom fit for me!  And of course, visit LuLu again, because she's so so sweet!\n\nNOTE: CASH ONLY!",5
2503,"Honestly, Lulu is amazing.  I'm never taking anything anywhere else to get altered!\n\nI have to admit I was a tad nervous when I put my bridesmaid dress on and she just pinched the bust, waist and hips and took measurements sans ruler and said, \""okay I'll text you when it's ready.\""  One, how can someone measure with their index finger and thumb and two, did she say text?  Did she mean email?!\n\nThe dress was completed in 3 business days, although I'm sure she works on Sunday (because she did text me to tell me so) and it fits like a glove!  It was cheap too!  Only $35 to take the bust, waist and hips in a few inches each.  She said \""don't worry about trying it on here.  I think it will be perfect.\""  Gotta love someone that takes that much pride in their work!",5
2504,"I needed a sweater rewoven and Lulu did an awesome job.  She was apologetic about being backed up wtih work, but I wasn't in a hurry. Pricing is very reasonable and she is very competent with her work.  I would highly recommend this business.",5
2505,we were here last Nov.2011 for my bestfriend's wedding in Omni Hotel. we needed some alteration for one of the bridemaid's gown and Ms. Lou was so accommodating to our needs. it was a rush request/work and she did a great job!! thank you so much!!,5
2506,"The ladies here are very sweet and talented. We had 2 bridal gowns that needed a bustle and minor alterations. The prices are very reasonable, the dresses came back perfect,  and the length in time getting them back was very fast. Is recommend this shop for any and all alterations.",5
2507,"As Lindsay's best friend and maid of honor, I went with her to Jim Ludwig's a few weeks before her wedding to go over the final order for the flowers.  We sat down and Jim pulled out a list of what they had discussed.  I very clearly remember her confirming dahlias and peonies for the centerpieces.  Not only do I know that she wanted these flowers from the moment of her engagement, but I was also at the consultation to witness the discussion.  The centerpieces were definitely not what she had requested - no peonies OR dahilias and they looked like flowers picked from the side of the road on the way to the wedding.  In no way did the flowers manage to ruin her beautiful day, but they were absolutely not what she requested or confirmed.  I don't understand how there was a \""miscommunication\"" as I saw the paperwork.  I just know that I won't be using Jim Ludwig's for any of my own special occassions.",1
2508,"I can't say enough good things about Jim Ludwig's Blumengarten.  We hired them to do the flowers for our wedding in April, 2012 and the flowers were gorgeous!  My bridal bouquet was so beautiful and fragrant that it made me cry!  What I especially loved was that Jim and Linda Ludwig personally delivered the flowers to the venue.  Jim pinned the boutonniere on my husband and personally handed me my bouquet.  Such excellent customer service is rare these days and I highly recommend this business.",5
2509,"I'm a foreigner and wanted to send flowers to my girlfriend living in a suburb of Pittsburgh. I contacted Jim Ludwig's Blumengartens florist after finding them here. Unfortunately they didn't deliver to the city I wanted my flowers to be sent to, but the Ludwigs have been very helpful and transferred my order to another florist that covered that area. \nThe contact has been fast and very friendly. I'll recommend and would consider them again.",5
2510,"What a great store! Dean the owner/manager was extremely knowledgeable and helpful about which backpack was best for me.  Very generous 30-day return policy and a wide selection of travel accessories as well as luggage. A must visit if you need luggage and want to support local businesses, especially the few who are left Downtown.",5
2511,"Specialty Luggage misrepresents customer service, does not make good on product warrantees, makes promises they do not keep and charges a premium for luggage that they falsely sell with lifetime warranties. I purchased a piece of luggage worth around $100 for almost $300 because the salesman convinced me that the luggage had a lifetime warranty. \n\nHe looked me in the eye and told me my luggage would be supported or replaced by them at any time.  He's a really good salesman - he smiles, makes you laugh and makes you feel like he's really honest. He'll go on for 10 to 15 minutes on the craftsmanship and quality behind the bags that they sell. \n\nHe'll make promises and guarantees to sell you a piece of luggage but in reality falls apart like any other luggage you purchase elsewhere without their excessive price \""service\"" premiums. \n\nWhen I went in with \""lifetime\"" warrantee luggage that he sold me that had defective wheels and a defective zipper that began disconnecting from the seams - he looked me in the eye and told me that I had a \""convenient\"" memory. He laughed at the idea that he told me there was a lifetime warranty on this luggage. I told him I was insulted that he misrepresented the craftsmanship behind this bag and overcharged me for a product that was not worth the premium he collected - he offered me 10% off another piece of luggage and said he was insulted. \n\nSpecialty luggage is staffed by slimy salesman who lie and misrepresent facts to sell you over priced products that do not justify the premiums they gauge customers for.",1
2512,"My wife and I have been shopping at Specialty Luggage downtown for years.  The staff there, particularly Matthew, are always willing to take the time to try and find the best product to fit your need.  If they don't have what you need, they say so, and will try to get it for you, although more often than not, if they don't have it, it doesn't exist.  We've purchased several pieces of luggage there and many accessories and everything has always been high quality.  They've also helped us get repairs for luggage efficiently and cheerfully and if there was any ambiguity about whether something was covered by a warranty, they gave us the benefit of the doubt.  The prices are reasonable and you get a lot better service than you can get from any online retailer.  It's worth it just to visit because you'll learn a lot about what's available; we've bought things there we didn't know existed and have been delighted with the result.  It's also been a great place for gifts during the holidays because of the diversity of products they offer.",5
2513,"This is a tiny place tucked into some snazzy downtown complex. Its cheap for downtown, and the portions are generous, so I suggest getting only the smaller sizes.\n\nI had a rice and beans burrito, and they let you take one of their hot sauces to the table. I asked for something really hot, and I actually got it. This is surprising for Pittsburgh, because I've noticed overall the town is weak on spice (even the Thai restaurants). \n\nAnyway, the beans in the burrito were fresh and cooked perfectly, and the rice was also plump and lightly spiced. The place is tiny and clean, and I got in and out for under five dollars for lunch.   \n\nThis place is really a gem--its cash only though, so bring that with you.  Good find. A lot better than some of the other places higher up on the list.",4
2514,"My favorite mexican restaurant. The ingredients are so fresh everything is made to order, their home made salsa is the best.  Can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Foods not grease like you get at a lot of Mexican places\n\nPortions are very generous, you will not leave hungry. Only open for lunch and only takes cash. And it can get busy for lunch but where downtown doesn't.\n\nAll in all great food, excellent staff and a great Price. My go to Mexican pick",5
2515,"The new Madonna's is disappointing.  A co-worker who always gives Madonna's rave reviews picked the new location for a lunch date.  He had talked about the spices, the flavor, the service.  Well, it was one for three.  The service was friendly, even during the lunch rush.\n\nI had the chico chicken quesadilla.  For $4.81 (with tax), it was a pretty big quesadilla.  However, it was just Monterrey jack, chicken, and a soft shell.  No spices, no onions, no peppers.  It was still decent for the price.  But I'm 99.9996% sure that the chicken was from a can.  How would I know?  Because I've cheated and used that same canned chicken in quiches when I was in a rush.  It's good canned chicken, but c'mon!  My lunchmates also complained that their burritos were bland.  I'm giving three stars because I believe Madonna's can (and will) do better.\n\nP.S. CASH ONLY!",3
2516,"I can't believe no one has written a review here yet on the good ol' Smithfield Cafe!  Maybe it's because it's been around so long and has been such a good ol' reliable that everyone just takes it for granted.  I guess I'm guilty of that too.  It's been a long while since I've eaten here.\n\nBut this place has been here many years.  It looks like it's still caught in some kind of time-warp.  They have maroon bar stools, yellow walls, wood paneling, red drop-down ceiling, green floor tiles.  Its menu is strictly the beef sandwich-n-beer type and they still serve their traditional Cobb Salad or Devonshire Sandwich.\n\nI was here last night with some co-workers.  We were celebrating someone's birthday.  As I said, I haven't eaten here in awhile and I don't drink.  So I don't know how the alky-holic beverages are.  But everyone else seemed to be enjoying the booze.  And the atmosphere here is still old-school great.  Well next week I'll have to hit it up for lunch.",3
2517,"Our experiences at the Smithfield were mixed. On the one hand the food was quite good (both Friday and Saturday), but the service was very, very bad.\n\nOn friday, we walked in and ordered coffee. The waitress then asked us what we wanted. I said that a menu would be nice. That pretty much set the tone for our time there. \n\nSaturday, we got menus (different waitress) but the woman was pretty surly and somehow managed to get our order wrong.",3
2518,Food was only just ok and service was even worse.\n\nThere's plenty of other places you can go to for breakfast  - even Eat'N'Park would be better but hit up a place like Ritter's instead.,2
2519,"The waitresses are surly.  It's kind of annoying.  But the food is decent.  I especially like the spaghetti with oil and garlic.  I always forget not to order salads, though.  They need to invest in a salad-spinner, if they're not watering down their dressings.",3
2520,"It has been a while since this place has been reviewed.  I'm happy to report the service isn't as ornery as some of the people experience in the past, so YAY for improvement.  I eat here a couple times each month since they have their Gas Crisis lunch menu entries.\n\nTheir sandwhiches always have fresh ingredients, and healthy portions of meat & cheeses in them.  The fries always come hot and not soggy, although sometimes I'm not a fan of their thicker cut selection for the fries.  I'm a shoestring width fry all the way kind of guy.\n\nTen bucks (tip included) got me a grilled cheese with bacon, double order of fries, and a drink.  I was in and out in 35 minutes (which was nice since I wanted to go for a walk) and the service was decent.  They aren't rude or dismissive but they're also not going out of their way to sprinkle petals as you walk about the premises.\n\nFor a quick decent meal at a good price, this place is certainly an option.",4
2521,"It's been a crazy week in my office, what with it being the end of our fiscal year and all.  So I just had to get me out and have me some good old comfort food for lunch today.  Alone!\n\nSo I had me a good ol' fashioned cheeseburger and fries with some coleslaw.  It really hit the spot so I'm upping my rating to four stars.",4
2522,"Oh this place.  \nThis is the greasy spoon that is sooo convenient it is worthwhile.  Would I travel more than 3 blocks for this place, probably not.\n\nWould I ride an elevator down and run over across the street in the middle of winter - without a coat - for it.  Of course.  \n\nI've done every combination of their salads - all solid choices.  And they are pretty flexible regarding adding/avoiding - so go  ahead ask.  (BUT - if they really wanted my opinion, I could write a dissertation on what they could do to improve their salad choices)\n\nWhen I'm having a horrible day at work and I can't stand the idea of a salad.  Their hamburgers are top notch.  They will frequently remind you that they won an award (ps none of the waitresses know which award).  But no joke - solid, straight up excellent burger and fries.  None of the glitz of every new burger place that has rolled into town - but really...This is a GOOD burger.\n\nThe decor...well it borders on the bad, but in the right light (dim) it's fine. It's a diner.\n\nWait staff is a surly bunch of no nonsense ladies, with an accuracy rating of about 85%, but I like them.  They mean well and they keep my glass of diet coke filled to the brim.",3

Of course they are.\nIs the waitstaff well versed in the latest culinary trends? Hell no.\nDo I love this little diner? OF COURSE!\n\nThey've basically got some great lunchtime staples (the Pittsburgh Salad, a really great burger, and some mediocre chili).  I have a soft spot in my heart for the tuna salad (open-faced on an English muffin topped with half a slice of a Kraft American cheese single).\n\nAbove all else, they have EXCELLENT bleu cheese dressing.  This is how you can weed good establishments from bad, in may cases.  This stuff is CHUNKY and CREAMY and downright deelish.\n\nAlso good for a cheap Friday happy hour (complete with Karaoke!).\n\nGive it a try.  It'll grow on you.... like fungus.",3

2525,"This has to be the best diner setting Downtown, a complete archetypal flashback of the greasy spoon meal alternative.  I'm pretty much a regular (2x a week) now so I wanted to update my review to point out that they've made a couple changes (maybe a different food purveyor) and the food is even better now.  The bread is fresher than ever, the turkey is nice and tender, and the bacon is scrumptious.  Service is still that  \""make yourself at home\"" but \""don't take yourself too seriously\"" that I truly enjoy.",5

Not to mention I was given a third 1 at no additional cost)\n\nThe presentation itself leaves something to be desired, not the most skilled with a knife, but the guy has to pump them out fast enough to keep the line moving. - and lets be honest, you're not going to a stand in wholeys for presentation.\nHis special sauce is tasty, some sort of sirracha-esq conccoction, but make sure you make note of it if you don't want this on your fish.\nUses a bit too much rice for my liking on the nigiri pieces, I think he could use about half as much. Though I understand he is located next to a primantis, and this is pittsburgh.\n\nFantastic value, great guy. Will return.\n\noh, and I really mean he's a great guy beyond the generosity with the fish. Today he temporarily stopped service to help a little girl find her mother.",4

I swear he remembers everyone, but even if he doesn't it doesn't matter because he makes you feel like you've been sushi besties forever!\n\nI love going to his stand in Wholey's where he'll just randomly hand me a sample roll.  And the rolls he makes are MAMMOTH!  I don't know about everyone else, but I can wolf down my fair share of sushi and it's really hard to finish a full 2 rolls from him.  \n\nThe menu is pretty standard but I'm sure he could whip up any kind of specialty roll you'd like.  Plus, it's all reasonably priced.  It's just great to have this stand in the middle of the fish market to grab some quick sushi from a very friendly face!",4
2533,"AAahhh.  Why do I have such a discordance with Pittsburgh Yelpers' opinions of sushi places?  This place is not 4 stars.  The long line -- one person, Andy, making the sushi, makes you think it's a gem in the Strip District.  Eh.\n\nWith Andy's Special, there was a variety of rolls, and made with a continuous strip of seawood (ie inside on one roll, outside on the next), which I actually found annoying, as the rolls fell apart when trying to separate them.  There just wasn't any flavor -- so I laid on the soy sauce and wasabi, but to no avail.\n\nI'm too annoyed right now to make any funny comments.",2
2534,"Andy the Sushi Guy.  \nFast, entertaining, friendly and did I say fast?  No worries about standing in line and taking a few minutes of your busy day to watch Andy work his magic.  After all, it's not often one can find a fresh fish market with the freshest sushi ingredients. And you can bet Andy the Sushi Guy won't skimp on ingredients.  \nWe stopped by on Saturday about lunchtime when Wholey's is packed with its Saturday shoppers, which is it's usual crowded busy-ness.  Andy's Special for the day:  Tuna & Kiwi  or  Salmon & Avocado FAT Rolls.  Yes, the special of the day is usually a FUTO maki extraordinaire.  \nWe ordered the Tuna & Kiwi and Andy's Sushi Combo.  \nTuna & Kiwi began with crispy dried nori (seaweed) topped with an ample amount of fluffy sushi rice.  Smeared on is Tobiko (flying fish eggs) with its bright orange color. Just as you're admiring his steadfastness, POP goes the rice ladened seaweed as  Andy flips the seaweed to create a reverse sushi roll.  Folks, I'd have to disagree with another Yelper when they say that nori goes on the outside. What's not to like about creativity? And personally, what's not to like about more ingredients that you can stick on the outside of a sushi roll?  Like Tobiko or sesame seeds? hhmm...???? \nContinuing with the innerds of the Tuna & Kiwi roll, more Tobiko, asparagus, seared tuna with a light breading, red leafed lettuce, fresh tuna and kiwi...a la Andy's Special of the day.  Roll up all of these and keeping it in tact so when the slicing begins, all of the innerds remain in tact. Whoosh!  Did you see how he picked up the whole futomaki (fat roll) and placed it in the clear togo container, fan it out, add an ample handful of shyoga (thinly sliced pickled ginger) and a hunk of wasabi (no explanation needed) with soy sauce in a mini condiment cup. Sushi a la Andy the Sushi Guy at Wholey's~~It's what's for dinner!\nIf Andy didn't cut the roll, it would take two hands to pick it up and eat it like a ginormous fat burrito, kinda like you'd get in one of them hole in the wall Tex-Mex joints down close to the border (the US Border, that is).  But it is cut into yummy 8 slices and is done quickly without smushing down the circular form. Instead, admire the sliced sushi serving as you lay it flat and be amazed at the color and textures of the ingredients. Not only does it have fresh fish, but some veggies to add to your daily vitamin intake.  \nThe only 'drawback' and I think that is what some of the sushi connoisseurs are quick to point out, is that the sushi rice is not seasoned.  Yes, folks, traditional sushi rice is seasoned with a slight glaze and a very subtle sweetness.  Now, if Andy seasoned the sushi rice as sushi rice should be seasoned, then I'd have to give the guy at least a 4.5 star rating (fresh ingredients, ample servings, creativity, appearance or presentation and seasoned sushi rice on top of all of that). \nI think I'm going to have to defend Sushi a la Andy against the folks looking for 'traditional sushi' in a sit down sushi bar.  You ain't gonna find it here.  And if that's the limit on your sushi palate, then you're certainly coming to the wrong place!  For if you're looking for fast, fresh and ample, this is it.  The bonus:  Andy treats you with friendly hospitality and part of the Wholey's family.",4

2536,"Oh Andy, how I miss your little swagger and sass! I know this is a difficult one to rate, since he runs a stand within another establishment (Wholeys) but I am giving 5 glowing stars nontheless for the amazing sushi he makes (right in front of you) and his stellar personality. I have never met a person with blood flowing in their veins that didn't get a total kick out of Andy.\n\nWhen I worked in the Strip, I ate here almost daily. After only two visits, he remembered exactly what I ordered and would start making it as soon as he saw me: spicy yellowtail with avocado. Or just yellowtail with avocado. Maybe some cucumber. Have I mentioned that I am obsessed with yellowtail? Ahhhh, the buttery-ness, the texture, the slight taste of the sea....oh wait, this isn't a review on a singular fish, i got a little carried away (even though Andy serves up some damn fine YT)! \n\nSometimes he gets creative and mashes different flavor concepts together for you to sample as you wait. He once came up with a maki roll made of salmon, basil, cucumber and mango....brilliant!!\n\nWholeys is such a fantastic people watching spot anyway and it's always amusing to see random people of all ages/genders/sizes walk in and yell \""ANDY\""!",5
2537,"It really pains me to do this, because Andy himself is such a cool and friendly dude, but after eating at Penn Ave Fish Company for so long...I just can't bring myself to get his sushi anymore. It's... just... not that good.  \n\nIt all snapped into place for me one day recently.  The sushi rolls he makes are massive, but the taste just isn't there.  He's rushing to make them so fast that as soon as you put your chopsticks around them they completely fall apart.  And the most important part, the fish, doesn't seem all that fresh.  Definitely not as fresh as Penn Ave., which is weird considering he \""lives\"" in a fresh fish mecca.  But the thing I think I've really grown to hate that weird brown sauce he puts on everything.  Yuck!  I just can't stand it!  I know I can ask to have it off, but as soon as I seem to remember, it's on there in a flash.\n\nI know it may be cheap and it may be fast, but to me it's just not worth it.  Penn Ave IS right down the street...and I PROMISE you'll love their fresh and delicious sushi!",2
2538,Andy has the best Sushi. His special sauce is what makes his sushi the best.,5
2539,"I'm sorry, but as cool as Andy is, I just don't like the sushi.  The tuna tasted metallic and mealy, definitely not fresh.  I actually spit it out in my napkin upon first bite.  The portions are large, yes, and the prices are good, but I'd rather pay a little more for sushi that is less suspect.",1
2540,"My fiance and I always have a fun time when we stop by Andy's to get ourselves some sushi. I usually head down to the Strip when the weather's bad to try to avoid crowds, so we've never had to deal with too much of a line. Last time we visited we even got to sample a spring roll Andy whipped up while waiting for customers.\n\nThe rolls are definitely larger than anything else you'll find when looking for take out sushi. I've had one from him where a given piece of a roll was 2-3 bites. \n\nI also usually stick to his specials, which for me always combine flavors atypical to your average sushi place. I'd never had basil in sushi before, but it really made the flavor of the roll.\n\nAndy's is a great place to stop if you're out and about and want some cheap sushi to-go. Everything I've had there has been great, but he definitely has a few oddballs thrown in the mix, so if you're a stickler for traditional sushi, this might not be the place for you.",3
2541,We tried it once. The price is good.,3
2542,"Eating at Andy's Sushi Bar was always an experience.  Probably the worst part is the long line, but in a way that is good because I always felt that sushi was very fresh with lots of turnover.  The prices are excellent and Andy is hysterical.  I wish I could eat here more.",4
2543,"First, do not call me sexy and then give me the two most sinewy pieces of toro possible. That pissed me right off. \nSecond, the rolls here are sloppy. Not only did it fall apart very quickly (and was about 4 times too large to eat: a piece of sushi should be able to be comfortably eaten in one bite), but it seems there isn't much thought given to flavors as far as the special rolls go. After my experience with the toro, I don't think I will be giving any sashimi or  *sushi* sushi rolls a try. While the rolls are large, the prices were quite steep, not what i was expecting for someone based in a market that sells seafood.",1
2544,"Seriously,best sushi in Pittsburgh. Freshest ingredients, huge portions and very reasonable pricing. And yeah, Andy gives free samples if you smile at him!",5
2545,"As of July 25, 2014, a sign on the front said that it was closed permanently.",1
2546,"Sushi Kim is one of those Korean restaurants you'll find in most N. American cities that don't have a really big Korean population. They tend to diversify into sushi as well as Korean food, which is probably a good move considering the American palate and their general unawareness of Korean cuisine outside of the major Korean enclaves. It's pretty obvious by their name, they aren't trying to hide the fact they are Korean.\n\nI've been there for both Korean BBQ on the second floor and Korean food on the main floor.  I wouldn't trek all the way from CMU to have sushi there since sushi can be more easily had, but definitely for the Korean food. Some would disagree, but I have friends from Seoul who even think Sushi Kim has the best Korean food in Pittsburgh.(Granted we are speaking for Pittsburgh) It is pricier than Korea Garden, but the atmosphere is slightly more \""upscale.\""\n\nThey also have at least 3 brands of soju(Charm, Cheoeum cheo reom, and  Jinro Chamisul), which for Pittsburgh is quite exceptional even though I would only drink the Chamisul. They also have Korean noraebang, which you have to reserve in advance. However they only have Korean songs, so if you can't read Korean you're out of luck. They charge $30/hour. I'm not sure there is any other Korean noraebang in the city. I didn't try it, so I can't say what kind of selection they have for songs.\n\nThe BBQ is a great deal and though not the best I've ever had. It may be the only Korean BBQ grill place in the city. The staff is quite attentive and is pretty good about replacing the grills. I would prefer a different sahm-jang and more variety in the non-BBQ items in the buffet. The BBQ is great for groups and seats 4 people for each grill.",4
2547,"Went upstairs for the BBQ, which was okie. But the guys running it gave us no real clues of how to run the BBQ grills, so we kept burning the grills until they were black with carbon buildup. The food was good, but I think next time I will \""do\"" the sushi.",3
2548,"The food was... OK.  The spider crab roll was okay, we've had better but it wasn't something I'd complain about either.  The beef bul-go-gi was also okay.  The problem I had there the first (and last) time I was there was that my rice was spoiled.  The rice I was given had a doughy and spoiled taste to it. \n\nI know what rice(s) tastes like (ate rice since birth), and they messed up the batch.  My problem was that when I asked them to smell the rice so they would know what I was talking about, they would not smell it and insisted that their rice was always good and that they cook 5 batches a day.  I would've had a good time there except for the spoiled rice.  My friend got a bowl of good rice, why couldn't I? :(",3
2549,Being a Korean-BBQ lover and snob..I needed to get my Bulgogi/gal-bi fix when I was in Pittsburgh.  My search led me to Sushi-Kim.\n\nOh how I wish it led me astray.  This was probably one of the worst tasting Korean Barbecue places I have ever been to.  The beef was not the right color and was basically bland.  The beef short-ribs were tasty but was way too tough.  I felt like I had to chew each piece 100x or I was going to choke and die.  \n\nI was not a fan of the food at all and would not recommend it to anyone.,2
2550,"I wouldn't call this place authentic Korean BBQ. I was disappointed that the \""grill\"" at the table was essentially a frying pan. How can you even come close to delicious Korean BBQ if there is no open flame? Every other BBQ restaurant I've been to has had either charcoal or gas grill.\n\nThe quality of the meats were terrible, though one shouldn't really expect much from a buffet.\n\nI will say, however, that the service was friendly and accommodating. It's spacious, and thus great for large groups of people. Just don't expect fantastic Korean BBQ.",2
2551,"My friends from North and South Carolina were craving for sushi so the seven of us decided to stop by Sushi Kim on our way to a business reception. This restaurant is Korean operated with a wide range of Korean and Japanese dishes to choose from. Although the location seemed desolate by the time we got there, the interior was spacious and festive with mini barbecue grills and bento boxes highly visible at every table. I was skeptical about the quality of either cuisine but in support of my friends I eventually chimed in with a 10-piece mixed nigiri with miso soup and mango sorbet for dessert ($41 w/tax and tip). \n\nAmong the nigiri sets, I thought the sake, ikura, and uni were decent but not fantastic or super fresh. The miso was too salty and the double scoops mango sorbet was generous but did not create a spark. With a versatile menu and spacious seating arrangements, this could be a decent place for large group gatherings. However, as someone who is spoiled rotten with fantastic Asian food from California, I thought the quality of sushi was rather bland for the price they were charging.\n\nIn short, this is how they measured up on a scale of 1-5 stars:\n\n1.) Quality and freshness: 3 stars, everything was decent but the wow factor was missing.\n2.) Creativity and presentation: 3 stars, the cuts of the fish were generous and nicely presented.\n3.) Quantity and substance: 2.5 stars, the flavors were weak, unimpressive but passable.\n4.) Accessibility and affordability: 2 stars, the price was very steep for the little amount of sushi I got.\n5.) Service and ambiance: 4 stars, our server was unresponsive at times but the ambiance was clean and festive.\n\nWith some reluctance, 3 stars for the overall experience. I won't be coming back.",3
2552,"This place was okay.  It wasn't great, but it wasn't awful.  It's someplace that I'd go to again.\n\nEvery July, I find myself in Pittsburgh, and this is one of my favorites there.  The grill is a little weird and their idea of AYCE sushi and Korean BBQ is different from most that I've experienced.\n\nThe sushi itself was not really all that good in my opinion.  I mostly stuck to the Korean BBQ and that was fairly good.  The sauces were fairly flavorful.  The meat selection, while not huge, was adequate.  The two story setup was pretty neat and it was easy enough to find on the street based on the directions that the convention (AC) gave us.\n\nI'd definitely go here again, but I wouldn't go out of my way to do so.",3
2553,"Eh, went here a second time because we were looking for a place to get a sushi boat that wouldn't cost us an arm and a leg.\n\nWe got the Love Boat, which is the mid-sized boat, and it was pretty disappointing. Lots of sashimi, a couple pieces of nigiri, and no maki. Also, the only fishes represented were salmon, tuna, yellowtail, and whitefish, save one piece each of octopus, squid, and shrimp. I felt kind of ripped off, since they basically just took all of their cheapest fish, chopped it up, and threw it on a boat. I wish we would have just payed the extra $15 and went to Chaya instead.\n\nThe Korean is not the best but it's decent for Pittsburgh. I'd come back for Korean, but probably not for the sushi.",3
2554,"First off, this restaurant is absolutely HUGE. there are a ton of tables, so i'm going to say that this place is good for groups..  When we went on a friday night, there were only about 7 tables occupied, with my friend and I sitting alone at the sushi bar.\n\nWe came here because we wanted sushi and rolls.  None of the pittsburgh restaurants seem to specialize very much in rolls, and of the sushi restaurants near shadyside/oakland, this one seemed to offer the most number of rolls (please let me know if you know of other ones nearby that offer more!)  We got a 12 piece combination sushi platter, a kim's favorite roll (which actually seemed like two separate rolls totaling 16 pieces), and a spider roll.  While the sushi and rolls were of acceptable size, the fish was definitely not very fresh.  the spider roll was probably one of the most repulsive rolls i've tasted in a while.  the soft shell crab was fried beyond recognition, and it took too much effort to chew as the crunching resounded loudly within my head.\n\nMy friend and I also split a soon doo boo, which came with a bowl of rice and a few miniplates of banchan.  while the soon doo boo was acceptable, with a lot of tofu inside, the banchan was pretty underwhelming. broccoli, pretty weak kimchi, bean sprouts...\n\nand sadly our bill came out to be way too much for a regular sushi dinner. after tax and tip, my friend and i each paid ~35.  while the service was friendly, i will probably not be coming back here again.",2
2555,"A few friends from out of town wanted to meet at Sushi Kim for dinner, so I agreed. The sushi selections seemed to satisfy their tastes, while their kids liked the miso soup, and edamame beans (which were replenished when asked). \n\nI'm not a fan of Japanese food, so I stuck with the Korean selections, after all I was in a Korean restaurant! I had Mandu Guk, which was a good size bowl of meat filled dumplings, and broth. My daughter had the pork bulgogi which she liked, but we've had better. The pork was really greasy, and not cooked on a fire grill, no char marks, equals less than tasty meat. \n\nSushi Kim alternates between a hit, or a miss. Sometimes you get a few different panchan, (side dishes of pickled or marinated vegetables), and sometimes you only get kimchi, wth? If you judge a place by it's patrons, I've seen few Koreans eat here, so that sums up the authenticity factor. Nice big restaurant, just lacking in overall experience.",2
2556,"Ew! Ew! Gross! I know that's not the most mature thing to say, but that's what comes to mind when I think about this place! Sad thing is, I've been here a couple times. Every time I kept thinking it would somehow get better, but no, it doesn't! The Miso soup they serve has this weird after taste, and to be honest, doesn't taste like any Miso soup I've EVER had! So on to the sushi, oh yeah, it's gross too! I think I kept going back because the size of the rolls are humongous. The thing is the fish does NOT taste fresh at all! It's always luke warm and....just.not.good. Oh well, I tried. But I'd suggest you not!",1
2557,"You can not pay me money to eat here again. They cannot even cook edamame, it was undercooked and cold. I had to stop eating their sushi in fear I would be sick for work in the morning. Texture and temperature of the fish scared me. Save yourself pain and throw your money out the window. Only plus side was their friendliness in service.",2
2558,"Update to my previous review: I've gone here a few times since then hoping to reclaim the initial wonderful dining experiences I've had and all three times the fish was meh to bad. It makes me sad because when it was good, it was truly something special..\n\n\nJust want to voice some dissent to all the negative reviews. I think this is some of the best sushi in Pittsburgh for the price. You can always get a table and the fish is really good. The best thing to get is a combo platter and then ask for no squid or octopus. They will really hook it up. I've never really gotten any of the rolls. I did have some of the korean food and was very underwhelmed. The short ribs are pretty sub-par and if you get the spicy fish salad I think they use almost spoiled raw fish and try to mask the flavor with the spicy sauce. However, if you stick to the combo platter I think its generally pretty great (relative to the other options)",3
2559,Absolutely the worst sushi my husband and I have ever had.  It was Gross!!! I don't know why they use so much rice or why the fish wasn't cold.  You couldn't pay me to go back to this place!,1
2560,"My family and I had the intention of visiting another restaurant in the area but they were not open of lunch so Sushi Kim was our lunch alternative. \n\nWe were pleasantly greeted when we entered the restaurant and seated in a corner table. The service was attentive, we were brought water and green tea before our meal started. Their menu is a cross of Japanese and Korean. \n\nWe ordered a mix - my brother, the Korean beef, my dad and sister shared a sushi platter and my mom and I both got beef bulogi. Portions were reasonable, I was surprised they were not American sizes. My brother enjoyed the beef, but it did not come with rice thought. My dad and sister said the sushi was average. The beef bulogi was ok, filling but have had better across the border. \n\nEach entree was under $12 and the sushi platter was about $15. Not bad for lunch prices. \n\nAn ok place to visit if you are on Penn Ave. I would like to compare to other japanese/korean places in the area.",3
2561,"I'm new to Pittsburgh with a job on the North Shore. I had a craving for some Korean food and went to the place nearest my office - Sushi Kim in the Strip District that boasts both Korean food and sushi.\n\nLet me say up front - the food I received was delicious. But, I was a bit disappointed with the portion size for my lunch entree. For $12.95, I received just a few portions of ribs (I ordered the kalbi), just 3 ban-chan (side dishes of kimchi, sprouts and broccoli), a small serving of white rice and a miso soup.\n\nDelicious food, small portions and a bit overpriced.  I was thinking of coming back to try to sushi, but I think the price structure needs to be reworked before I return.",2
2562,Meh. I would say Korea Garden in Oakland is way better...\n\nI got the spicy tofu pot and although it was spicy- that was all that I could taste! \n\nThe spices were very overwhelming and I couldn't really enjoy the flavors of any of the ingredients inside! \n\nI would rather take the trip to Korea Garden down near Atwood street.,3
2563,"Overall, this was pretty good Korean style cuisine, and the sushi was fresh, well prepared and reasonably priced.  If we had been in town longer, the Good Doctor and I would have checked out the weekend Korean BBQ bar upstairs. We perused, and it looked pretty good - sort of a Mongolian Beef BBC concept, except Korean style. \n\nThe first night of our conference at the nearby convention center, we were surprised it wasn't more crowded, considering the close proximity. However, by the second day of our conference, our colleagues had caught on and filled up the restaurant.\n\nWe heartily recommend - there's not much else in that neighborhood, and Sushi Kim is filling the gap nicely.",3
2564,"A group of friends and I went to try out the Korean BBQ. Apparently that is only available on the weekends, so be warned. We started off a bit on the wrong foot, because we had made reservations in advance, only to be told when we got there that another, larger party had booked out the upstairs BBQ area, so they wouldn't be able to accommodate us. After staging a bit of a hissy fit, they were able to find a place for us, and the adventure commenced.\n\nSo, having had Korean BBQ in both New York and San Francisco, I can't say that I thought this was the best experience. The kim chi selection is pretty limited when you're used to being plied with multiple little plates of different kinds of tasty kim chi. Here, they only give you the pickled cabbage. If you're looking for vegetables, this is not your place. You can take marinated bulgolgi, kalbi, pork, and chicken, plus there's calamari and shrimp for seafood eaters. The chicken was really tasty, but the rest of the selection was a bit bleh. As one of my friends put it, the bulgolgi from Trader Joe's is better than what we had here.\n\nIf you go, be nice to your tablemates and try to rotate the cooking duties. It's really lots of fun to go with friends and to have a communal experience, so even though I'm not sounding like I had a great time, the reality is that we all had a lot of fun and enjoyed ourselves. But don't go thinking that you are going to have the culinary experience of your life.",3
2565,"Sushi Kim has long held a reputation as one of the best sushi restaurants in town. However, after repeated visits, I wonder if this stems from the day when Sushi Kim was practically the only sushi restaurant in town. \n\nPlease note that this review pertains to the sushi dining only, for dinner. I've not been there for lunch or had the Korean food.\n\nMy most recent visit typifies each time I've had there. Upon arrival, the place is nearly empty. The service is attentive but indifferent, as if they realize you're a dirty dish that needs to be cleaned - you're taken care of like any other chore.\n\nThe miso soup arrived, and was very tasty. However, it was also past lukewarm to the point of being cool. This is pretty normal, as well. \n\nThe most disappointing part is the sushi itself. It is not inexpensive (really, sushi is rarely inexpensive), but upon arrival, it is a bit too warm, and just doesn't taste fresh. Being that much of this dish consists of raw fish, freshness concerns me a bit more than, say, french fries at a bar. Each and every variety is equally disappointing, with the end result being \""Meh\"" to \""Yech.\"" \n\nWith such a large population of sushi places in Pittsburgh these days, and even Giant Eagle in a pinch, there is not really a reason to frequent this place anymore. After a handful of visits based on reputation and the hope that this time might be better, I've made my last trip to Sushi Kim.",2
2566,"I've been to Sushi Kim few times over the years and every time I've gone there the food and service hasn't lived to it's reputation of being one of the best Korean restaurant atleat in Pittsburgh.\n\nThe food is okay.. service is mediocre and staff ... not the friendliest :)\n\nSo, if anyone asks me to recommend a good korean or a sushi place... you can say this will definitely not make the list.",2
2567,"I'm visiting Pittsburgh and I found this place online with several good reviews. It's a small family owned restaurant and had a very friendly staff. I found that there was a small number of specialty rolls that have a variety of ingredients and sauces, which commonly are much larger rolls. These tend to be my favorite, so I was disappointed. The rolls that were more simple had large pieces of fish and were quite delicious. Overall a great place for sushi.",4
2568,"good Korean food, killer miso and seaweed salad - we'll be back.",4
2569,"Hard to rate this one. The Korean BBQ is tasty (though it is the only Korean BBQ I've ever had, so take that for what it is worth), but the sushi is just awful.\n\nThe salmon sashimi that I had on my last visit was terrible. It was warm, and didn't taste fresh at all. Their rolls are very limited and are mostly pretty boring. Even if simple maki is your thing, these seemed very expensive for poor quality.\n\nOn the other hand, the Korean BBQ was fun and tasty. It's a shame it is only available a few days a week.\n\nMy advice? Skip the sushi. Eat the BBQ.",3
2570,"If you're in the mood for fresh, tasty sushi, this is not the place for you. The food that was delivered to us was simply inedible. Point blank. \n\nMy husband and I ordered a bunch of sushi for dinner with the plan of having tasty leftovers for lunch the next day, so we splurged a little, spent like $60 on various rolls. The presentation was pretty pathetic - wilting nori, leading us to believe these rolls were pre-made; hot pink ginger, meaning it's the MSG-soaked kind; glue-like rice, where you can't see the individual grains - but what really horrible was the smell. When we took the lid off the tray, the stench of rotten fish knocked both if us back. I honestly gagged.\n\nIt was so awful, we just stared at each other, amazed that we just spent our money on a pile of stinking rot. Determined to not waste everything, I picked up a piece of spider roll to sniff/inspect/try. IT HAD A HUGE HAIR IN IT, all wound around the crab. Totally disgusting. My husband attempted to try the inari - just tofu and rice, right? It tasted like rotten fish, as it had absorbed all the smells from the other fish rolls. \n\nWe had also ordered a vegetable and tofu soup, and a green salad with ginger dressing. Can't even believe this, but the salad leaves were brown and slimy on the ends! They actually screwed up a green salad. The soup tasted like the inside of an aluminum pot, all metallic and burnt-flavored. Horrible, horrible, horrible. We literally dumped everything down the garbage disposal. Total waste.\n\nWe tried to call and complain, but by the time our order was delivered, the place was closed. We will be calling again today to get our money back. Maybe they will earn themselves another star if they do the right thing and refund our money.",1
2571,Staff are friendly. Sushi is not overpriced although the rolls could be made better. Otherwise this is a decent sushi place for a lunch once in a while.,2
2572,Ate here last night and it was absolutely the best meal I have had at Sushi Kim. Wife got the usual pork bulgogi and I got standar dol sut bi-bim-bap. \n\nIt was unbelievably good. It wasn't because I was really hungry. It was perfect. Every single bit of both meals was perfectly proportioned and seasoned. And the side dishes were GREAT except I really missed not having sweet potato and little omelet ban chan. I will cut out Dosani and Korean Kitchen as long as Sushi Kim keeps this up!,5
2573,I had a lunch there once. The food is ok but it's on the pricy side. I don't think I will be back.,2
2574,"There are much better sushi choices available.  This place is just okay, but I like sushi to be spectacular.  The employees were lots of fun, they had the best sense of humor, and the service was excellent. The prices were very good.\n\nI was there on a Monday, so I just tried the sushi.  I might go back for the Korean BBQ.",2
2575,"Don't bother with the sushi, can't speak to the Korean BBQ.\n\nLong story short: I ordered delivery. Never had sushi delivered before, so maybe this is just the way it goes, but it took almost two hours to get to me. There was condensation inside the sushi container from the rolls sitting on top of the other entree I'd ordered (which was hot) and being held against it in a small bag. Assuming that the rolls were made long before I got them, I just threw out the tuna roll, which was warmer than room temp anyway. Vegetable roll was good, but not exceptional. Fried rice was...just not what I expected, not exceptional either. In short, I paid almost $40 for a cucumber roll and two bites of rice. \n\nMaybe this is better when you dine in. Still, would not recommend. Pricey and doesn't live up to it at all.",1
2576,Being Korean and my kids and I visit all the Korean restaurants when we are out of town.  Since my daughter goes to PITT we wanted to treat our daughter to Korean food.  My family including my wife who is non- Korean always order    and if this is how they want to represent Korean food to others they are doing disservice to our heritage.   was the worst I have ever had.  Their  had lettuce as one of mixing choices and their meat was hamburger meat?  Will not go back.,1
2577,"Pittsburgh is not known for its Asian cuisine, but Sushi Kim's might just be the most popular Korean restaurant in the city.  I've been here just a couple times.  The venue is by no means impressive.  The decor is very dated and dark.  Whatever you do, do not drink the water.  My friend claims that it made him sick to his stomach.  Pittsburgh is not well known for its tap water.  I'm going to take a water bottle with me the next time I go.\n\nThe first time, I went a friend and I had the kalbi and the mandu.  It was palpable, but nothing special.  I've heard that the kalbi is one of the better things on the meal, but I personally don't like eating with my hands.\n\nThe second time, another friend of mine introduced me to soondubu.  I got the vegetable only soondubu, while my friend got the regular soondubu.  Soondubu is a spicy tofu based soup.  Traditionally, it is served with vegetables and shellfish.  My friend was kinda disappointed with the regular, because it only had shrimp. For me, the vegetable soondubu hit the spot!  On a cold winter's day, this spicy soup was absolutely perfect!  Craving to go back again!\n\nI've heard the BBQ dinner is very good!",3
2578,One of my favorites in the Burgh for almost 20 years.,4
2579,"I am sorry to say that this place still STINKS.  I work in the strip and often get temped by Sushi Kim.  I stopped in for lunch today and I was the only person in the whole place.  That should have tipped me off.  The last time i was there i had a bad meal, but i wanted to give them another shot.  \n\nI ordered the spicy chicken off of the lunch menu.  I believe is was L1......Numbered menu items.....Another tip.   My food was terrible.  The miso soup was horrid and old, the sides were awful and everything seemed to be microwaved.  AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS!!!",1
2580,"I don't give 2 stars that often but sorry Kim - you were a bitter disappointment. \n\nI was excited to have found a Sushi place in Pittsburgh in walking distance to my apartment. That excitement didn't last for too long when I entered the place on a Monday evening at 7pm, realizing that I was the only one in a rather spacious restaurant.\n\nFine, I had a Sushi craving and couldn't care less. Until the Sushi arrived. I ordered my Spicy Tuna and Salmon rolls, both came within 2 minutes. Strange? Maybe, or just a super fast chef. Sadly, the rolls were falling apart as soon as I looked at them, and the Salmon even tasted... bad. I had to leave it on the plate, which has never happened to me before.\n\nOn the plus side, the miso soup was okay and the service was very attentive, which is not surprising if you're the only one in that place. As there are not too many Korean options in Pittsburgh I encourage you to try the Korean BBQ, especially as the reviews for the Korean food at Kim's on Yelp are not that bad. But for the Sushi - forget it.",2
2581,"I didn't have the awful experience some had here based on prior reviews, but it was definitely mediocre.  I went on a Wednesday evening and the place was totally dead except maybe one couple sitting by the sushi bar part of the time I was there.  Which is sad because they have such a huge space with 2 levels, lots of seating, and great proximity to both the Strip and downtown.  A lot more could be done with this place.  \n\nThe menu was printed in very poor quality with what could have been nice pictures of food options but they were super fuzzy and hard to see.  It seemed like their Korean menu was pretty varied but I had come for the sushi.  I ordered the Kim's Favorite Roll which was described as \""Tuna, Yellowtail, Broiled Eel, and Salmon\""  but what I wasn't expecting was the salmon to be cooked all the way through.  Maybe I  should have read it as \""broiled eel and salmon\"" but that wasn't clear or typical of this sort of roll.  Normally eel is cooked but the other fish are raw unless specified otherwise.  Maybe you'd have a fried roll or something baked or seared on the top, but to cook one type of fish that is normally raw and mix it inside with 2 raw types just seems strange to me.  So it ended up being a really odd combination with the raw tuna and yellowtail next to the cooked sushi which wasn't so great all squished together inside the roll.  The sushi roll was quite large at 16 pieces, but I still felt that 18.95 was really pricey considering the quality of the fish was only mediocre with small portions, and they used a TON of rice. The quality of the fish was again just ok.  Not super fresh but not bad either.  The rolls (and those of my friends) kept falling apart as we tried to eat them.  It seemed they weren't properly wrapped or maybe it was just that they tried to use way too much rice.  One fun thing was that all the rolls came out on little boats, so that was a nice touch.  The roll also came with a miso soup, which was fine but nothing special.  The miso soup didn't have the awful taste some others here reported but it tasted like what I'd make from a powered package rather than made fresh.  I also got the shrimp shumai which were again just ok, and tasted like what I could get from the freezer section of an asian store and microwave myself rather than made fresh.  \n\nOne person at our table got a Korean dish which came with 4 side dishes that were all vegetable except for the fish cakes.  She said her food tasted decent but the beef bul go gi dish she got just didn't look right or have the proper color it should have had.  Just liked kind of dry and plain.  When I went to the restroom I was disturbed to see trays of the Korean side dishes in the hallway just sitting out in the open not covered or anything!  It would be different if the restaurant were bustling but it was totally dead and pretty clear those wouldn't be eaten that evening (so I shudder to think that after hours sitting out uncovered unrefrigerated that they put them out again the next day and hoped someone would eat them...).  If you aren't that busy there is no reason things can't be prepared to order!  That is simply lazy.  Also I overheard part of a conversation between a waiter and a guy at the sushi bar about something being \""expired\"" and what to do about that.  Unfortunately I couldn't hear all the details but it was disturbing since this was after we all had gotten our food already.  I mean it's good they are being mindful of expiration dates but it sounded like someone had to be schooled on it based on what I heard.  But granted that I only heard bits and pieces so I can't say for sure.  I don't think I'll go back here again.",2
2582,"I cringed when I saw that their BBQ buffet price went up to $24/person, considering that I can go to a seafood buffet 10 minutes away for much less. Sushi Kim is a clean and bright place with seats on all two floors. The Korean BBQ buffet is on the second floor and only available on Friday and Saturday evenings starting at 5pm. \n\nThe service was wonderful and the servers really helpful. The Korean BBQ is buffet style, so you help yourself to the raw proteins and vegetables at the buffet bars and then cook them on your hot plate at your table. It's a really fun and interactive eating experience. There weren't that many choices for proteins, but the choices that were available were all delicious. Protein choices ranged from mussels and shrimps to pork, chicken and beef. My favorite was the bulgogi beef. \n\nThere were a few things I disliked about the Korean BBQ at Sushi Kim though. First off, they offered no butter or oil for the BBQ. I understand that they are trying to keep things healthy and all, but without any grease, the food was easily burnt. Butter or oil should always be an available option. Secondly, I did not like the design of their hot plates--the interior cooking area was way too tiny so it took forever to cook the food. And finally, they need to add a DESSERT BAR. After eating all that grilled food, I craved something sweet and refreshing. But, Sushi Kim left me hanging. Sushi Kim is already charging a whopping $24 per person--it would be nice if they throw in a dessert bar to sweeten up the deal (pun intended). \n\nOverall, I'm very thankful there is a Korean BBQ place in Pittsburgh. For being the only Korean BBQ buffet place in the area, it deserves a standing ovation. I had a great time at Sushi Kim and would gladly recommend the Korean BBQ buffet special. Buffet price was a bit high though, so crack open that piggy bank!",4
2583,"Last time I was here was about 3 years ago. I have been avoiding this place since the recent reviews have been very mixed.  Today I was in the mood for BulGogi and my friend wanted sushi.  So at Sushi Kim we arrived.  I have never been here for dinner, only lunch and there is always enough tables and space.  (Perhaps this is the best time to go) We both ordered from their lunch special menu; Sushi sampler & spicy pork BulGoGi & also an app of shrimp dumplings.  Was not a fan of the dumplings but our pork was delicious, tender and spicy and the sushi was a nice mix and fresh.  My friend ordered the green tea ice cream and my sample of it was quite tasty.  We each had a glass of wine and with tip got out of there at around $50.00.  Not bad.  \nTheir menu is extensive and it may be hit or miss here depending on what you order.  I have always had a hit with their BulGoGi, Korean Pancake, Hot Pots and   sushi.  Their service was attentive, but again, we were there for a late lunch and the place was not packed.  All in all, the food was very tasty, service was good and price was respectable.",3
2584,"Went here for the ayce Korean bbq. I'm from LA where KBBQ is kind of a religion, so I was looking for a place to fill my craving. Flavor wise, it was pretty good and there was a descent selection. It was kinda of pricey though. 25 after tax. For the lower selection and high price that I'm used to, it's not somewhere I'm going to be coming to regularly.",3
2585,"SeasonTicketHolder:  Like too many other undiscovered, underrated cultural treasures, the Public Theater makes for a wonderful night downtown.  (I guess I am writing a review to encourage others to \""Come On!  Give it a try!  You might like it!\"").  The theater itself is the perfect size and the stage can allow for an up close and personal experience when you almost touch the actors to a balcony seat which offers some distance (but not too much!).  I started coming to the theater after seeing \""The Secret Letters of Jackie & Marilyn\"" and then bought in 2008 starting buying season tickets.  The selected productions range from slightly high-brow to fun, light-hearted one woman/man shows.  Also there are \""TGIF\"" Live Music nights, Wine Wednesdays, Saturday Brunches, and Sunday Post-Performance Discussions.    Ted Pappas does an excellent job!!",4
2586,"We are so lucky to have such an amazing theater community in Pittsburgh.  This unique theater adds so much to the mix!  It's a fantastic theater because they focus on plays, usually with one musical in the mix. There's new works here, like the original show The Chief, about what else, but Pittsburgh Steelers founding owner Art Rooney.  They bring in the classics like A Midsummer Night's Dream and The Important of Being Earnest.  They also have newer works right off Broadway, like The Rabbit Hole and Superior Donuts.  Plus, they bring in Second City every year, which is big in my book because they've spawned a couple SNL cast members!! \n\nI absolutely LOVE the theater!  I'm a big fan of a theater in the round.  That means there's seating on 3 sides of the stage.  They've also been able to do some really cool things with the stage/set, like making an actual pool for the show Metamorphoses.  My favorite all time show was The Secret Letters of Jackie and Marilyn, which was a world premiere.  The show was about a made up relationship between the two women where they wrote letters to each other.  It was a VERY cool concept! \n\nThey also do a lot of great events like the Mix at 6 for young professionals before a show.  Plus, they understand that most of us under 26 (and of course sometimes above) are broke ho's, they offer $15 tickets!  The great thing is, there's really not a bad seat in the house! \n\nAgain, we have a fantastic theater district, so TAKE ADVANTAGE and go here!  Don't make me tell you twice!!",5
2587,"Just saw \""God of Carnage\"" it was well acted and funny. A good night out. Don't expect a resolution but do expect a good time.",3
2588,"I can't remember the last time I was here before I saw a show last week as part of the Mix at Six series that the PPT hosts.  It's a young professionals event that serves light appetizers and drinks prior to the show.  Networking starts at 6 pm and the show starts at 8 pm. \n\nAs for the venue, it was a great space and stadium seating ensures that all seats can see the stage below - which is a huge plus for me since I'm short!\n\nI almost forgot how much I enjoy plays and I hope to see shows here more often!  Don't delay as I did and check out a show here sooner rather than later.",4
2589,"For many years, my best friend and her mother were season ticket holders and when her mother reached a point in age where she could no longer fully appreciate theater (sight and hearing), I became the theater companion. We've been going now for three years, and although the overall 'experience' of the Public is pleasant, the base reason of why I attend 'theater' has been a mixed bag of mostly disappointment.\n\nThe theater itself is a grand and beautiful piece of architecture. Acoustically sound, very comfortable, clean and organized.  The staff, from box office to ushers, is always pleasant and helpful. As with all theaters, the concessions are overpriced, but in this era, that's to be expected. \n\nThe theater offers a LOT of 'fun' incentives to draw in groups and keep folks as regular attendees, like the brunch series for season ticket holders, or the wine Wednesdays, and other 'groupings' that give 'value added' to the experience.\n\nMy friend and I have our tickets on what we call 'donut day', or the brunch series. It kind of an all-you-can-eat continental breakfast with mass donuts, bagels and pastries from Giant Eagle, with coffee and tea.  It's a nice incentive, but we've begun to look forward to the donuts more so than the actual 'theatre' experience.\n\nThe reason I go to the 'theater' is to enjoy the play that's on the stage, and in the past three years, I've been mostly disappointed with the productions. I've seen a LOT of live theater in my life, from small low budget black box, to college, to Broadway tours, with varying levels of production value, but with a much broader range than I've yet to see at the Public.\n\nI've even seen a few productions in other 'less substantial' theaters that the Public presented in the past three years, and had to wonder 'what were they THINKING?' One production, 'ART' comes specifically to mind, having seen it in Florida presented by a mid-level budget theater company with high production value that nailed the script, characterizations and flow 100%. I was excited to see the show again, as it is a spectacular piece of writing - when done right. The moment I walked into the Public's production and sat down and looked at the set, I had to say 'HUH????'  The play that followed kept me saying 'Huh?' They totally missed the boat on direction, character development, as well as a just wrong set.\n\nTheir choices in season also seem to pander heavily to the 'donors' and not to 'theatre' lovers. With all of the scripts available in the world, and I've seen a LOT of them, I have to ask why most of the more challenging pieces (intellectually as well as artistically) are never touched. After three years, we're now asking ourselves if buying season tickets is really worth it, when so many of the shows in the season we've already seen - but we seem to go back out of habit, not out of enjoyment.  This past season, 'Private Lives' was part of the season. I saw Private Lives at the public in the 80's. Pittsburgh Irish and Classical did it three or four years ago. Theatre Factory in Trafford did it two years ago. Again this past year at the Public?  Seriously?  \n\nThe sets for most productions have been great (except for ART), and the performances have been 'ok', with some capable performers who were doing 'just ok'. Exceptions were Superior Donuts, God Of Carnage, and Circle Mirror Transformation. Three plays in three years that were exceptional and worthy of exceptional applause.\n\nYet, da burgh audiences give out standing ovations for EVERYTHING, whether or not it deserves a standing ovation. Do they really believe that all of what they're seeing it exceptional? If so, they need to get out of the box a little more to really experience the difference between 'Yeah, that was ok' and 'WOW!'. \n\nI really miss well-done challenging live theater, and rarely do I find it in Pittsburgh. Instead, I end up settling for an day out with lunch or dinner, good company, and two hours of 'diversion' on the stage that make going to the movies more appealing.  And for me, this is what the Public is...\n\nMaybe it's just Pittsburgh, and a matter of 'giving them what they want'. But every time I receive a 'now playing' e-mail from the many theater sites I belong to, and read the synopsis of the MANY production listings, I drool, and wonder 'Why can't anyone do this stuff HERE??'\n\nThe Public SHOULD be that venue. And their productions SHOULD be on that exceptional level.  Sadly, they just aren't.",2
2590,"Totally underrated by the Yelpers!\n\nI freakin' LOVE Redfin Blues.  I'm kind of glad it had a low rating previously to keep y'all away while I was living in Pittsburgh!  The only reason I'm even reviewing it now is because I have moved away and I'm not at risk for losing my table to a Yelp reader.  Also, I feel guilty at not letting people in on this gem.\n\nTo be clear, I LOVE Redfin Blues for a very SPECIFIC purpose: sitting outside on the patio by the water on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon drinking the bar out of Red Stripe and white wine and eating peel and eat shrimp by the 2 pound bowl with B, Ems, Boyfriend, and whoever else is so lucky.  It is a hidden gorgeous Pittsburgh oasis under the 31st bridge near Washington's Landing (note: the Yelp map is wrong) where you don't feel at all like you're in Pittsburgh, but instead on vacation.\n\nDisclaimer: I have heard that at night it is full of strange frat boys (from no actual fraternity), Cougars, tramps, creatures of the night  -- or undesirables.  I don't go at night so my credibility wanes here a little.\n\nI basically only ever eat the peel and eat shrimp.  It's just cooked shrimp - sometimes it's big, sometimes it's little.  But it's $17 for TWO pounds which isn't too overpriced especially since it can feed a tableful of friends.  Ask for extra old bay if you like it spicy and salty - yum! I've also had the fried cod sandwich - the fish is crisp and flaky and darn good!  I always take it off the bread to keep it as crispy as possible but those who know me know I have an obsession with fried crispy-ness.  The breading isn't too too heavy so that is a plus too.  I've also had the crab cakes which are meh  but fine for Pittsburgh standards and I would definitely steer clear of the crab legs.  \n\nOk, so really you should go to this place - if you like peel and eat shrimp, cold drinks by the river, and occasionally a keyboardist who plays and sings in the background pretty quietly.  Some of my favorite Pittsburgh moments happened here and that's saying a LOT.  Redfin Blues makes me miss you Pittsburgh!",5
2591,"Pittsburgh has a shortage of riverfront dining, so this place wins points for ambience on a nice warm day. Have a drink and enjoy the deck, but save your dining budget for somewhere else.  The menu is blah and the food is also.\n\nI recently had lunch here, and the waitress first forgot my meal entirely, bringing food to everyone else at the table.  When I reminded her, she returned with my clam chowder, spilled it, didn't apologize, and didn't clean it up.  All that would have been forgiven if the soup had been any good.",1
2592,"Great location! Love biking through here and stopped for drinks a few times. I have to say the service and some of the guests give off snobby vibes. Good wine list, have not tried the food. Live entertainment a plus. Feels like your on a beach vacation when you're here!",3
2593,"Better than some reviews.  Guess it depends on the night.  Went late evening after kayaking on the river.  Sat outside and waited....Waitresses both thought it was the other's table.  After that, service was good.  Was crowded.  Had the crab cake sandwich, which was pretty good...better than I expected from this type of establishment and not to much breading.  Pizza was good, the pasta dish was OK.  Beer not draft//why??? Wines were below par//Why???  Was pleasantly surprised!",3
2594,"Awful service, overpriced food. Don't waste your money! On arrival, waitress seemed lost.  Ordered food for 3 adults, one kid, food came for adults, after a couple of minutes my mom asked when my sons food would be coming, waitress said she would check, came back and said his pizza hadnt been cooked yet. Cancelled the pizza, paid $4 for a little bowl of white lettuce with some cheese thrown on it, fried shrimp was expense, but looked like cookie cutter frozen shrimp. Spoke to manager, who had a horrible attitude and found out that the waitress never put the pizza order in for my son and then lied and told the manager he wasnt at the table when we ordered our food. If you give these people your money, it would be foolish!",1

2596,"It has all been said before--it's a great place to settle in for a beer.  The night I was there a couple of guys were performing music.  We had the wings--I would not call them memorable.  Again, a great view of the river and the city.",3
2597,"The only reason I really go here is when I'm on my boat and get hungry, and this is one of the few boat-up bar/restaurants in the city.  The complete lack of boat+drink+food spots in this city should be the subject of another post.  \n\nAlthough this place has a lot of potential, the beer list is lacking and comparatively expensive.  The food is mediocre generally, though I did get a pretty decent fish sandwich last time I was here.  I've had several of their apps, and none of them were worth writing home about.  \n\nCome here if you're looking for a \""chill\"" environment, good patio dining, and a nice view of the river.  If you're only looking for a good meal, I definitely don't recommend it.",3
2598,"In the warmer months it's always nice to be by the water so a couple of friends and I checked this place out recently.  \n\nThe food was so-so.  I got the seafood pizza and while there was a decent amount of crab and shrimp, flavor was missing.  It needed something besides the pizza crust and some crab and shrimp...some sorta sauce to complement the seafood would have been welcomed.  \n\nWe had the buffalo shrimp as an appetizer and those were really good.  But everything else that I had was mediocre at best.  The service was great, or I should say our waitress was very patient with us considering we were a bit rowdy from drinking earlier in the evening.  \n\nIf you're in the area or are looking for an outdoor venue, I'd recommend this place.",3
2599,"The only reason anyone goes to this restaurant is to sit on the deck and drink.  I want to like this place so badly I keep coming back and hoping that it'll be awesome and it just never is.  Like dating someone who is very very hot but also very very stupid, it's amazing how much patience one can have if there's a really good atmosphere.\n\nOne year I took my father here for his birthday.  I don't usually call people names but our waitress was just a complete idiot to the point we felt bad for her and that was the ONLY reason we didn't freak out on her completely.  She forgot my dad's food order.  She brought out mine, but then neglected to notice that my dad was sitting there with nothing.  The manager came out and took our drinks off hte tab, btu that didn't help very much bc we'd only been able to order one round in an hour of waiting bc the waitress had only come to our table twice.  Then when they brought my dad's steak out, the waitress dropped it (I felt bad for her), and apparently that was their last steak.  I just paid the bill and we left and went to Eat n Park.\n\nThe second time I came back the service was equally as terrible, but also it was late summer and our table was literally attacked by wasps.  Seriously, attacked by wasps.  My friend got stung.\n\nAnother time I'd made a reservation for my friends 30th bday and they said htey didn't do reservations but could put tables together.  When we showed up, it was like I'd never called.\n\nThe last time I was there it was ok, but after being attacked by wasps my friend and I opted for the patio and only ordered burgers.\n\nThe service here SUCKS.  Getting attacked by bees and then having to wait for your server to bring you ice sucks (holding a cold beer bottle against the sting helps).  It just sucks here.\n\nBut the atmosphere is fantastic!

2600,"Dear Redfin Blues,\n\nI can't begin to express my disappointment in your establishment. Such high expectations were set when we were greeted at the host stand and sent of for cocktails on a 20 min wait list (which apparently never existed). After 30 mins and seeing literally 4 parties that noticeably came in after us be seated, I reminded the host who directed us to the bar that we were still waiting. After 20 more minutes and 2 more parties getting sat (one who sat themselves) I approached a blonde woman seating and cleaning tables to let her know that we could be removed from the \""list\"". To which she replied \""what list?\"" And didn't even bother to apologize... nothing was offered to assist us in our search for sustenance nor was there anything offered for our inconvenience. Fortunately, for us, the disaster at your restaurant lead us to discover a new place, that we have decided to frequent. So, thank you for f**king up.",1

Coming from a sunny country, with lots of coastline and having lived for many years in California as well, this place gives to me \""some\"" of the same feel.  \n\nHowever, having said that, the restaurant itself it is extremely purely run.  The service seems to be in a hurry (even when there are not many people really in the place).  The menu has different details from what the chef is preparing (e.g., one item we order was supposed to come with potato salad based on the menu but it came with fries).  We also heard people at the nearby tables complaining about their orders being mixed up.  \n\nWith respect to the food it is nothing spectacular, but it is not bad as well.  I would definitely like to try more things on their menu.

We only had to wait about 15 minutes for a table, relaxing and sipping on Corona's with lime. Upon being seated, we decided to split some appetizers (chicken quesedillas and peel-n-eat shrimp). The cocktail sauce for the shrimp was amazing and shrimp was plentiful. The quesadillas were hot and filled with hearty ingredients of cheese, meet, sour cream and salsa.

I walked in with long hair and normal-looking bangs that all needed significant trimming.  The stylist said he would need to take a couple of inches off of the length due to damage.  I said that was fine.  I did not ask for any other style changes.  I somehow walked out with bangs that take up most of the front part of my head, much like a small child's haircut (to serve the purpose of keeping hair out of the child's face).  He also took almost five inches off the length, instead of the \""couple\"" promised.  I feel like my haircut looks like a cross between a bowl cut, a female mullet, and the futuristic look of Mia Wallace from Pulp Fiction.  I'm pretty open minded to different haircuts, but this one is truly awful, and it's too short now for me to even pull it back easily to try to make it look better.  \n\nI'm going to a place in Shadyside today to see if they can maybe do extensions to remedy the mullet look, or implement some kind of other cut to make it look a little better.  It's a shame, because this place is downtown and so convenient to my workplace, but I certainly will not risk it again.\n\n:(",1

I have never had a wait staff say \""thank you\"" and \""you're welcome\"" more than this. They even joked with me as I ended up waiting 30 minutes for my delayed guest. (I used this time to read other Yelp reviews for my meal selection.) I can only hope that service is like this at all times. For my money it doesn't get any better here.\n\nFood: C\nUnfortunately the food wasn't as good as the service. I got the chicken parmesan after reading that the salads were less than overwhelming. I guess it would be OK if you like your chicken parm buried in veggies and cheese. Me? I like my chicken parmesan to be mostly, you know, chicken. It wasn't bad, mind you, but I can make a better dish at home and I am certainly not an Italian restaurant. Can't say I recommend the meal I had here this day. (on the other hand, I did once have the lasagna here and I remember it being tasty).\n\nQuite frankly, for me the Olive Garden is a better Italian experience, even with all of its chain restaurant failings.

I was invited to go with friends, who were old enough to remember when it was probably good.\nThe prices are *outrageously* high for the quality of the food and portions.  I had the Chicken Marsala, which was alright, but something I normally eat served out of a chafing dish at a funeral buffet. This was comparable to a catered version and the restaurant itself deserves a funeral... It's outdated and just a factory for getting people in and out and on time to the cultural events they're going to.\nThe waitress was nice enough, seemed a bit embarrassed to respond 'no' when I asked if certain menu items were fresh.  On the other hand, she disappeared quite a bit and didn't ask if we wanted any desserts -- which we probably would've if we'd been asked.\nEven though Downtown after business hours isn't the most exciting place to eat, there are other places I'll insist on going instead of back to Tambellini's.",1
2617,"AVOID EXCEPT FOR SHEER LAUGHS\n\nThis place is just textbook in terms of epitomizing what NOT to do in a \""fancy\"" Italian restaurant.  Meals are $30 a plate, but ask your waiter for a bottle of Prosecco and he says, \""What is that?\""  We ordered a gin and tonic, watched him make it, and were served our mixed drink literally with no ice.  Who serves a drink without ice?  We had no silverware, had to request it repeatedly.  Our entrees, dessert and coffee all came out at different times.  We received the check before being asked if we even wanted dessert or coffee, for that matter.\n\nSo - service aside, the food is just mediocre and of no relevance to the Italian inspiration it proclaims.  Our stuffed banana pepper appetizer was too hard to cut with a fork but we had no knives.  The prime rib was fatty and cold.  The crab cakes were far more cake than crab, you had to eat around it leaving a pile of filler mush.  Pasta was just pasta.  \n\nThe atmosphere is also drab and just depressing.  \n\nAnd the split plate fee is exorbitant, so we lied and shared food anyway.  Note that our check was still nearly $300 - for only five of us!\n\nReally, truly, avoid this place at all costs unless you're looking for a good story to laugh about.  The only redeeming quality here after an overpriced meal was that it left our party of 5 with a good story to tell.\n\nThis is the second time I've been here, the first time we just had sandwiches in the basement and it was also far from memorable.\n\nAVOID!",1
2618,"This place is just a flat out joke.  Totally overpriced.  Went before a show and they gave a limited menu and tacked on the token 20% \""service\"" fee which gave them the right to provide lousy service.  First I asked for the beer they had on the chalkboard outside.  Had NO clue what I was talking about.  Finally gave up and got a Coors Lite.  Food was overpriced and less than average.  I had the Baked Scrod.  Exact same dish at Eat N Park is $8.99 and better than this $27 dish.  I would stay clear of this at all costs.  If you are going for a night of theater - opt for eating outside the city or at Sonoma Grill down the street.  I'm shocked this place is still in business.",1
2619,Since closed.  Surprise surprise.,1
2620,Just saw this unfinished review from a few years ago o and I see they are now closed but posting anyway. Had a weeknight dinner on a recent business trip. I really enjoy this local institution and try and stop by every time I'm in the city. The breaded zucchini is great and what they are known for. The menu is mostly traditional dishes and I've had great to good meals here but never a truly bad one. Service is always very good.,3
2621,"Located in 5th Avenue Place downtown, Cafe Amante definitely serves its purpose for a sit down eatery as it's the only true sit down restaurant in the building. It's nothing special, it's just there. The good is good the service is okay as well. It's just kind of there. Nothing is every special or changing there. I hate calling it regular but that's truly what it is.\n\nIf you're going for lunch look to spend about 10 bucks per meal and that's not including your beverage. It could be considered pricey depending on your lunchtime budget. I'm a fan of their chicken parmigiana. They also have a nice chopped salad. Plus free Breadworks rolls make everything better, right?\n\nI don't see it changing its ways anytime soon as the business travel through the place keeps it pretty steady. Why change what's no broken is probably what they're thinking, however, I really thinking the outdated decorations could really go. But if the boss man is paying, why am I complaining?",3
2622,"I'm not sure why this place isn't getting better reviews! I've been here twice over the last couple months (including yesterday)  and have been very happy each time I've gone.\n\nCaffe Amante is located on the second floor (food court) level of Fifth Avenue Place, the home of HighMark Blue Cross Blue Shield.\n\nAmongst most of the mediocre chain food that's served on the same floor, it stands out as basically the only(or one of a few) sit down places available.  \n\nBoth times the service was right on point.  Quick, efficient, despite being busy, friendly, wait-until-I-finish-my-sentence-sensitive, good recommendations on food.  Corrected themselves when they were wrong in what they told me previously and so on.\n\nThe two dishes I've had are:\n\nSpecial Salmon and jumbo lump crab meat.  It was expertly cooked, great flavors, good portion size, and overall just a winning dish.\n\nDi Mare Amante which is a dish with shrimp, scallops, in a white clam sauce with capellini noodles.  Their menu spells it with two p's: cappellini.\n\nBoth were great and I'd have them again.\n\nYou know, part of my review and rating is based on exactly what this place is: a more upscale place for the mostly business clientele bringing their customers out for a conveniently located lunch. In a restaurant that is more or less in a food court. Being surrounded chinese joints, mexican burrito places, and the philly cheese steak place.\n\nWhile I think it would be a solid bet for dinner as well --- that's not how I see this place positioned. I wouldn't take a date here Friday or Saturday night. There are more exciting places offering more adventures fare.\n\nThis is not your $8 lunch.... most things are priced $12-$16 which includes bread. Their prices well justified by the quality of the food.\n\nFor lunch, I'd go back to this place in a heartbeat.",5
2623,"I have eaten in and had take out from Caffe Amante.  Both were pleasant experiences with decent food and service, but neither were anything that left me wanting to run back and eat there again.  \n\nThe atmosphere is nice.  There are great window views downtown.  I imagine it would be a great place to people watch on Light Up Night or other downtown event evenings.  The decor overall is simple and not overly \""Italian\"" like you see at many local Italian establishments.  \n\nThere menu is not that extensive but does have a decent variety.  The sauces we tried were tasty as was the sausage.  \n\nOverall, if you are in the area and looking for something other than fast food, it is worth a visit, but it isn't someplace I will actively seek out again.",3
2624,"Located downtown, call Dr. Greg and he can get you in that day, sometimes within the hour.  He's a cool guy, very friendly, and not a new-age, hippy, sales-y doctor like some of the other chiropractors that I've been to.  Accepts insurance & FSA...if you work downtown, I recommend him.",5
2625,Decent pizza and calzones.  Get rid of the canned mushrooms! Crowded at lunch.  Calzones are huge!,3
2626,"Well folks, it looks like the end of this bee-yoo-tee-full October weather we've been having is nigh!  Tomorrow brings the cooler, more rainy weather we'd been so accustomed to before this autumnal respite.  I had one last chance to dine al fresco today.\n\nSo which type of fare would be best for outdoor dining?  Hotdogs?  Nah, I'd already done that.  Hoagies?   Hey, now we're talkin'!  MMMM!  To quote Adam Sandler, \""Hoagies-n-grinders, hoagies-n-grinders\"" (but no navy beans, navy beans!).  Villa Reale may be a typical downtown pizza shop, but they've got good hoagies here.  I went for the 6\"" pepperoni topped lettuce, tomato, onions & cheese and a brewed ice tea.  It was the perfect way to end a season of outdoor lunches.",3
2627,"ZERO Stars.  Today, my friend in a wheelchair came in and his friends wanted to sit at the bar for a slice.  They asked if there was an exception to the rule about being at the bar.  The manager told my friend that he could not be accommodated.  That's illegal and immoral and absolutely disgusting.",1
2628,"Done with this place...  It seems every time we go there they get slower and slower.  Today we waited 50 minutes for a cheese pizza that we never got before walking out.  I complain to the guy making pizzas and he says \""you're not the only one's here\"".... Well, he secured the fact that I will never be back again.",1
2629,"On the recommendation of the previous reviewer, I booked an appointment with Autumn to fix a bad haircut I received the week before. I work about a block away from the salon, so the convenience (and the amazing price) was a big draw. \n\nThe salon is an odd mix of color, cozy, and sterile, but no matter: I wasn't there for the interior design. Happily, Autumn listened closely to why I wasn't happy with my previous cut, took careful note of the photos I brought in, and proceeded to fix the bad and design the good. She was extremely friendly, easy to chat with, and knew her stuff. I left the salon with a great new cut (exactly what I wanted, though a little short in order to fix the previous blunder), and a new hairdresser to boot. There's nothing quite like the relief of finding a stylist you know you can count on.",4
2630,"Nice people & nice location. Very experienced, which means they can make good recommendations. I felt I was in good hands. Location is very pleasant. The shop is clean, well-kept and feels upscale.\n\nDefinitely going back, and encourage you to try it out!",4
2631,"Everyone at Salon Nuvo is a professional.  Everyone is friendly and it's a really great salon.  Chrissy has done my hair for almost 15 years (she moved to Salon Nuvo about 2 years ago) and I trust no one else to perm or color my hair.  Chrissy understands chemicals and how to maintain healthy hair.  She's a dedicated professional and has always been flexible - she let's me come in late to accommodate my work/school schedule.  And everyone I've ever referred to her has been a happy customer :-)  I'm pretty brutal on my hair (lots of heat and don't deep condition as often as I should, in addition to a fair amount of every day stresses)....If Chrissy didn't maintain and take care of my hair, I'd probably be bald by now!  She keeps it trimmed, healthy, and growing!!!  And she's super sweet....it's a delight to sit in her chair :-)",5
2632,"I have been going to Salon Nuvo for about two years now. Autumn does my hair and she is amazing. I have very fine, thinning hair and the cut is always flattering. And Autumn seems quite supportive of my desire to not color my very grey hair, which is something I have not had in other salons ... there has always been a push to do some sort of coloring treatment.",5
2633,"Definitely recommend this salon! I booked an appointment after having many failed attempts with other stylist that are not able to work with biracial hair. I was frustrated and tired of having the same look because of my unruly mop. I have thick, frizzy, and  curly hair that cannot be tamed easily. The stylist that ended up doing my hair was Chris and she was fantastic! She listened to what I wanted, was fun to talk to, and gave me many helpful tips. I walked out of the salon feeling very satisfied with my new look. Anyone that has biracial hair or children with it should make an appointment with her, you will not be let down!",4
2634,The salon is so dirty we left before I let them cut me hair. The sanitizers were old and half full. The scissors and combs were a mess.  http://www.wellbuzz.com/dr-oz-beauty/dr-oz-pedicure-bacterial-infections-dry-pedicure-haircut-ringworm/,1
2635,"Wonderful service all around. Had a few drinks at the bar before dinner, bartender was great.\n\nFood was your standard chops and fish. Very well prepared and tasty. Also a great wine list - I recommend the 2003 Lascombes if you like Bordeaux.\n\nThe location isnt the best (downtown) if you are looking for fun afterward.",4
2636,"Horrible service and the food is not comparable to any other Ruth Chris I have been to and I've been to them in 10-15 different cities. My rib-eye was all fat and the waitress was so snotty we wanted to throw our drinks at her. Save your money, this place doesn't deserve to be named Ruth Chris. I've had better steaks at the Outback Steakhouse!!",1
2637,Really good steaks! The porter house is to die for! Something about cooking a steak in butter! Paula Deen would be proud! The location could be better. With all the new construction of new condos and office buildings going up now would be a great time to move! Was my favorite until Hyde Park came to town. Really good service and drinks!,4
2638,"I came here for lunch recently and all was excellent. I come here about 4 times a year. When I do go I prepare myself by not eating red meat several days prior to going. On the day of I make sure to eat a normal but smaller breakfast. No bagels as they occupy too much space. I arrive a bit later, I am a bit hungrier and the staff that remains are long time regulars who know me but are also there to earn a living and make my visit worthwhile. I always order a filet, medium with mushrooms. I don't drink when go, the beef is too good to have my senses misdirected. The plate and filet arrive in minutes, the plate is sizzling at 500 degrees, if by chance there is too much red in the meat I cut a piece and sizzle it right there on the plate. I recently tried the salmon on a recommendation from the owner and was wowed how good it was. Panko crumbs and lemon, great stuff. \nI always feel they go the extra mile for me but the food and service are always top notch i can assume this is the standard.",5
2639,"Always amazing! My Husband and I frequent Ruth's Chris for almost every special-occasion: birthdays, anniversaries, when we need a great meal; and without fail we leave euphoric. \n\nAfter almost each bite, we close our eyes to shut-out the sense of sight to focus on the taste and aroma of the garlicky, creaminess of the Remoulade on our salads; the richness of the Pesto on our Sea Scallops; the buttery-goodness of our dry-aged steak; and the salty crunch of our French Fries, which Kathy suggested we dip into Honey-mustard for a fantastic salty-sweet combination.\n\nFriday is a good reason to go... Reservations are calling!",5
2640,"I loved my everything about my experience at Ruth Chris.  It was a bit expensive, but the service was outstanding and the food was delicious.  \nI would definitely go again.",5
2641,"No matter which location I go to, I am never disappointed with Ruth's Chris.  I would live here if I could...  Feeling hungry?  Try the Porterhouse...AWESOME!",5
2642,Best Steaks in Pittsburgh!!! I come here a lot for special occasions.  It is a pricy place but it is worth every penny. I had a New York Strip and it was really tender and juicy.  Definitely one of my favorite restaurants.  The service is excellent also.,5
2643,"Always top notch service and food at Ruth's Chris Pittsburgh. They have some summery specials during these cold winter months to bring you out of the post-holiday funk, which is very refreshing to see. Stop in for lunch for great deals on amazing food. Their lunch cuts of beef, chicken and fish include 2 sides and a salad for an extremely reasonable price. I got the lunch petite filet, veggies, mashed potatoes and appetizer salad for 28 bucks! Not bad for a steakhouse. Our server was incredible, as usual, and was extremely attentive of my gluten-free needs. The servers are extremely knowledgeable of the menu and will accommodate you no matter what. The decor is a bit dated and is due for a remodeling, but perhaps that will be on the list of things to do for the chain since they are celebrating their 25th anniversary this year!",5
2644,"Apparently I wasn't important enough with my lunch burger order (even though it was $16.95...) because my server did not come back to see if it was cooked medium, which it certainly was NOT. When I FINALLY got a chance to ask about it, she acted indignant that I would question her then checked her pad, yes, I ordered medium. Then she stared at me. Stared. \n\nI have to say, I have never felt smaller in any restaurant experience in my life. Extremely disappointing and appalling. Will give our business to Capital Grille from now on. I urge you to do the same.",1
2645,"This is the third Ruth Chris I've been to. The steak was delicious as usual, but the service and overall atmosphere was a little off. \n\nThe other locations I've visited have been located in casinos and I have to say they are more laid back and comfortable. You didn't feel like you had to whisper to your dinner mates. \n\nThe only food complaint I have is that the asparagus was very large and barely warm. But luckily the bread and potatoes were more than enough to go with my steak. \n\nParking here is free if you can find the lot. There was no mention of the parking online or when I made the reservation. So we paid for parking and had to walk a few blocks.",4
2646,"I read an article recently in the Post-Gazette that says to wring the most wear out of what they own, people are visiting auto mechanics, cobblers, tailors and computer repair experts as they haven't in years.  I believe it.  Business at Ullrich's has been good recently, especially since they moved into their present location.  Ullrich's has been around in one form or another for over 80 years and a couple of years ago they moved to their present location.\n\nUllrich's offers a full line of services including shoe and purse repair, desalt and waterproofing, and jacket and zipper repair.  Can't make it into their store?  You can even send your shoes to be repaired via mail!  No, really!  Check it out!    http://www.ullrichshoerepair.com/mailorder.htm\n\nAnyway, my husband Rick asked me to drop off his shoes to get them resoled here.  I just picked them up on lunch a few minutes ago and they look practically new.  He had me drop off his leather jacket to have a tear repaired last year and they did a fantastic job.  I've had one of my purses repaired here too.  We've always been satisfied with their work.  \n\nIt's so good to see people renovate and repair rather than throw out.  Rick and I have been doing that for years.",5
2647,"Hey, they linked to my review on their website!   Just click on News & Links and then on Customer Review http://www.ullrichshoerepair.com/newslinks.htm  Like Steve Martin in \""The Jerk\"" when he finds his name in the phone book, I guess I'm somebody now!  \n\nAll kidding aside, Ullrich's came in handy last week.  I broke a heel and they did a great job repairing it.  They've resoled Rick's shoes, repaired a tear in his leather jacket, and repaired one of my purses.  We've always been happy with their work.",5
2648,"Miracle worker. Genius.  The guy here is amazing. This may be the best place on earth. I only recently discovered the fabulousness of having your shoes repaired instead of throwing them out. I walked in there with heels on that were so beat I was walking on metal rods (don't judge). He fixed them in about 10 minutes and they looked brand new.  \n\nYesterday I took my most favorite pair of boots, a unique pair of Steve Madden cognac leathers with rawhide ties up the backs, in with the hopes they could be salvaged.  The boot heals were slowly breaking down. Not only did he completely replace the heels to look like the day I bought them, but he shined them all up all pretty and suggested a cream to put on them to make them last forever.  He said they'd last 40 years. I said 'you, me and these boots are gonna be lifelong friends'. \n\nBest cobbler ever!!!",5
2649,"So I don't ever go Downtown because well Downtown is kind of icky. Eh, whatever I guess that's really besides the point. Anywho, After getting my eyebrows done at Princess Nails from Michelle (EYEBROW FAIRY!) I needed to cut a new set of keys because apparently holding onto keys is lost on me. I doubt my landlord wants to be woken up at 2:00am to let me in again either. After calling 7349651474 locksmiths that wouldn't duplicate keys because they're stooopid someone from the Office Depot sent me to Ulrichs Shoe Repair. Yes, Shoe Repair. Fix your shoe, make a key. Upon entering Ulrichs (I think it was the owner) was super friendly and I'll give him credit for being somewhat funny. Gave him my keys and in literally 30 seconds flat both keys were made AND they both worked. Usually going to somewhere like Home Depot you have to go back like 3 times for the key to work properly. Not in this case. Overall customer service amazing. Quality of service amazing. Plus super cheap too! $2 bucks a key. Um that's a deal if I ever saw one.",5
2650,"Short story: the guy smeared the sole rubber all over the shaft of my boots, said he didn't do it, tried to clean it up and took out some of the leather's dye instead, and didn't give me a refund (I'd already paid).  Moral the story: if you risk this dude, only pay him at the end after you check for damages.  Long story below.\n\nOh, Groupon, you've steered me wrong yet again.  I have awful luck with service at places were I've used Groupons overall...hey, you put out a Groupon to bring in customers, not to be pissed when said customers show up for their discounts! basically, I think the cobbler screwed me because he was only making $5 for $40 worth of services.\n\nI dropped off two pairs of leather riding boots to get new heels.  I had called and been given a quote of $20 a pair and was told that they still do same day service.  I'd had a bad feeling about the place after I called for the quote and the guy I talked to the didn't know what riding boots looked like...He thought they had a spiked heel...but I had that magical Groupon to use, so I went anyway.\n\nSo, I went.  After some haggling (and after seeing I had a Groupon), the cobbler told me that my soles were \""bald tires\"" and he had to replace those as well.  So now we're up to $40 a pair.  I said fine because I love these boots and they were quite expensive.  I was told to come back after 2pm.\n\nThree hours later, I return.  The cobbler finishes one boot immediately and hands it to me to look at.  I'm pleased and say so.  I pay.  I'd brought my own canvas tote so I start packing up the boots as they are done one by one.  And then I see it appearing on the remaining three boots...the brownish-black rubber from the soles is fingerprinted all over boot's shaft.  Oh, hell no.  Here's the play-by-play:\n\nMe: Uhhhh, I don't think this was on the boots before.  [points to blobs]\nFront Counter Lady: I don't know, but you don't understand the process.  It's not possible for that to happen.\nCobbler: [Not even looking]  Nope, I didn't do that.  That must have been there.  Looks like hair stuff.\nMe: [WHAT] Um, I'm pretty positive it wasn't there.  [Get out my phone for the photo I took of the boots before dropping them off.]\nC: Nope, wasn't me, but let me see if I can get it off.\nFCL: [begins rant about how people are never pleased, etc.]\nMe: If you look at the shaft where it hits the sole, you can see that there are smears and splatters right there.  So, it was not like this.\nC: What do you expect for same day service?\nMe: [now fuming]  For you not to damage my boots that I'm paying you to repair.\nFLC and C: [Talking over each other. Alternatively making excuses about no one else offers same day and blaming me somehow for the shoddy work.]\n[C grabs another boot to clean off and I see that whatever he's using is making it worse by taking off the dye.]\nMe: Just please give me that back.  I already paid and I don't want you to clean them anymore.\nC: You really should buy a de-salting and waterproofing treatment if you're going to wear them in the snow.\nMe: I don't wear them in the snow.  Please just give me the boot so I can leave.\nC: Okay, baby.  Have a nice day, baby.\n\nDon't advertise \""While-U-Wait\"" if you're going to gripe and do a terrible job.\n\nWhat would have made me happy, you ask?  If the cobbler had admitted maybe he had made a mistake, voided the $40 dollar charge (the other $40 was the Groupon), and offered to clean them properly for free.  I would have even agreed to run the $40 charge again AFTER he'd restored the boot shafts.  But, instead, he was a total jerk.\n\nAdditionally, the woman \""working\"" the counter had no clue about prices and had random friends using up all of the chairs for customers both times I was there.  And both times, she ignored me for a good two minutes before screeching, \""You need something?\""  Rude.\n\nFYI, previously both my mom and I had repairs at Ullrich's back when the older Calabrese gent was working and they were at the old location.  The repairs were about 75% cheaper and the service was excellent.  Honestly, I think my family started going here because of the Italian owner (I'm a quarter Calabrese myself), but I won't ever go back.\n\nResults: After applying a leather cleaning solution and using a leather shoe brush/eraser, some of the marks are up but the rest appear to be permanent.  This is after 4 hours of scrubbing.  Ugh.  Pictures are posted of the damage for your viewing pleasure.",1
2651,"I've been to Ullrich's twice and both times received excellent service.\n\n My first time at Ullrich's was to have the end caps of my heels replaced (for a second time). Initially I went to another repair store in Sq Hill and had them replaced -- but the replacement heels were totally wore out again within a couple months.  Went to Ullrich's to have them redone and after 6 months of hard walking, the heels are still wearing great.  \n\nI won't go any where else.",5
2652,"I am really careful with how my shoes are handled. Every time I buy a new pair of shoes, I immediately have sole protection covered. This was actually my first time doing anything like this in the states, and I really wanted to go to a place that does a perfect job. \n\nAt the shop I met Rex, whom he was very kind and friendly. Still, I was still skeptical about this shop so before I departed after giving my new pair of shoes I asked a one last final request to be EXTRA careful with my shoes. And guess what? He did an amazing job and I am really happy how he got it to be perfectly thin as I wanted.",5
2653,"I'd like to echo the advice of another commenter: do not pre-pay.\n\nI dropped off a pair of boots for salt removal, new heels, and a polish. I was very specific about the polish, because I wanted them to look nice. When I picked up my boots, I noticed that they looked very dull and there was still clumps of wax on them. When I pointed this out to the clerk, she took them back to the gentleman in the back (the owner, I think). He said that the wax hadn't been buffed off. He gave them a quick polish and took $5.00 off the price. If he had then returned the boots to me freshly polished and shiny, that would have been the end of it. The problem was he gave them a  half-assed shine. After sitting for 3+ days with dried wax on them, a quick polish didn't remove much the dullness.  When I pointed this out to the gentleman, he said he had done the best he could. Quite frankly,  If that's the best he can do, he shouldn't be in shoe repair.\n\n I finally just gave up trying to make him understand why I was unhappy, because it was clear he wasn't going to help me, and he was becoming rude and unprofessional. I had made the mistake of prepaying. He had my money and had no more use for me. I think if I had owed him money, he would have taken my concerns more seriously, instead of becoming increasingly snarky and mean. \n\nI wish that I had paid closer attention to the other negative review about Ullirch's on Yelp (which also includes pictures) because it closely mirrors my own experience, both in terms of workmanship and customer service. The gentleman who owns the shop is sugar and spice when he's taking your money if you foolishly prepay, but quite unpleasant if you dare to complain about shoddy work. Personally, I don't mind if people make a mistake as long as they own up to it and correct it. It's when you're abusive about your own error that I take offense.\n\nIf you do chose Ullirch's, do NOT prepay.",1
2654,"This place is horrible. The cobblers do not know what they're doing. You can get better service elsewhere for cheaper.\n\nI came to this place to get my dress shoes tapped and have rubber protection pads applied on the front half. There are logos on the bottom of the shoes and I told the cobbler to not cover the logos. The cobbler kept saying that he knew exactly what he was doing. In the end, I found out that he ground down half of the logo on one of the shoes and covered it with the rubber protection. Also, he smeared the black glue (used to apply the rubber protection pads) all over the bottom of my shoes.",1
2655,"This was a really pleasant surprise.  The normal Friday night ritual erupted last night and that is finding a restaurant interesting enough for me and flexible enough for the lady's particular tastes.  She was going to be nice enough to go to \""Dish\"" although I know it's not one of her favs'.  Mantini's also came across the radar screen.  However, I wanted to try somewhere new and we both wanted to try something budget friendly.  Annie's Mom gave us an \""entertainment\"" book for Christmas and Papa J's was listed as an option.  I checked out the website and was less than enthusiastic.  Unlike its sister restaurant in Carnegie this spot has a stripped down menu.  I'm guessing because it does most of its business during lunch hours and maybe happy hour.  I called the restaurant and they did have many options not on the internet menu including a couple feature dishes (note to restaurant please update your website, you don't even list any pasta dishes as an option for the downtown location).  We decided to check it out after calling her brother Lee who goes often.  We get there around 730 PM last night (Friday).  Upon entering the extremely old (classic) building I'm struck by the interior which is truly \""old school\"".  It's dark wood, exposed brick, ornate lighting and the like...  There are a group of regulars I'd guess sitting at the bar imbibing loudly.  The bartender notices us and asks if we need a table for two.  We are then greeted by a friendly gal (JJ) who takes us to the back dining room which is a bit crowded and she senses our hesitation and takes us to the other side of the bar which only has a few patrons.  Annie confirms with JJ that we can use the entertainment card, she confirms and we save 12 bucks.  She brings us over some decent bread, unfortunately not served warm.  The bread is served along with the obligatory oil and vinegar mix.  She left a big bowl of parmesan cheese for us to add as much as we wanted which was a nice touch.  Annie started with the wedding soup which was okay, but not memorable.  I tried the potato soup, which was pretty tasty although a little bland.  Annie then ordered the chicken Romano which was really good.  The chicken wasn't too \""eggy\"" and the coating was almost light which is hard to accomplish with this dish.  In addition the portion size was pretty large and the chicken was cooked perfectly and not dry at all.  They also accommodated her request to have thin spaghetti for the pasta and serve with Alfredo Sauce, which they did for a dollar more.  The whole dish I think was $15.  I ordered the salmon with green beans.  It was a reasonable portion of fish cooked well.  The green beans were crisp and fresh.  The salmon was served on a chipotle pesto.  I found the pesto a bit overpowering and could have skipped it altogether, but if it did need to be served on pesto I would have preferred a traditional style pesto.  Service was spot on from start to finish.  I think JJ's family owns the restaurant.  We inquired about the rumors of the place being haunted and the former incarnations of this place being a brothel.  JJ took us down to the basement and showed us the underground tunnels that used to be used for the local politicians to make their way to the brothel unnoticed.  She also took us upstairs and showed us the Madame's bedroom (incidentally the headboard of the Madame's bed is now the bar downstairs (I took a picture and posted).  The whole meal with a couple of martinis was only $45 after the entertainment card discount not including tip.  And, we both had leftovers.  We stopped at the bar for a nightcap after dinner and the bartender said they are redesigning the menu and trying hard to make this more of a dinner spot than just happy hour.  There was also a band setting up as we left.  It seems like they are trying hard and I intend to be back.  However, be warned if you're looking for a hip happening spot a la \""tamari\"" this probably isn't it.  But, if you're looking for decent (3 star) food, great value and service you could do a lot worse.  I'll be back.",4
2656,"Food was okay, but was very surprised that they have absolutely no handicapped accessibility. Steps to get in from the street, restrooms up the stairs to 2nd floor. No accessible stalls in restrooms. Surprising in this day.  NOT HANDICAPPED ACCESSIBLE.",1
2657,"Have you met Frank? No? Well you'd better get on that, so you can brag to all your hipster friends that you know the best bartender in Pittsburgh.\n\nSeriously though. Best.\n\nWe found Papa J's at random on July 4th last year because, in typical Pittsburgh fashion, it was raining. We were en route from the Point to Station Square when the skies opened up, and the nearest bar to duck into was Papa J's.\n\nWhat you need to know first is that Papa J's is a historic landmark - it's the oldest standing former brothel in the 'Burgh. The wall behind the bar is actually fitted with a headboard (rumored to be that of the brothel madam), and there's a red light at the stairs.\n\nThe decor is all deep wood, low lighting, and mysterious feel. Better yet? Papa J's is rumored to be haunted.\n\n(Because if cocktails at a haunted former brothel doesn't get you excited about drinking in Pittsburgh, nothing will.)\n\nOh, and that's where Frank comes in. Frank is the friendly older gentleman behind the bar who will go out of his way to serve you the finest cocktails and martinis in downtown Pittsburgh. They've got a great house drink list (including a Bloody-Mary-esque beverage called the 'Angry Malkin'), but Frank also has a 'secret' list that only us 'real serious' Papa J's guests know about. \n\nFrank's policy is this: if you can give him the list of ingredients and he has them, he will make you any drink under the sun. If he makes it and you think it's great, he writes the recipe down in his notebook and recommends it to others. One of his specialties is the Black Eyed Susan. It's the signature drink of the Preakness, and he'll tell you the story of how he learned to make them (spoiler alert: it involves an A+ bartender going out of his way to help a sweet little old lady who loves the horses). \n\nAfter attending a Mixology class with Linda (that's Linda W. of Yelp fame!) where we made Prohibtion-era cocktails, I was in love with this gin drink called a Bee's Knees. It involves the use of honey syrup, which is not a common bar ingredient. Bless Frank's heart, he figured out some concoction of simple syrup and honey, and made me a Bee's Knees!\n\nYou can also choose to eat while at Papa J's, if you can tear your eyes away from all the drink menus. I recommend the bruschetta (almost always get an order of this - it's sooooo oniony, and sprinkled with cheese and a hefty serving of diced tomatoes - so good!), and any of the pizzas. Last time we stopped in, we had the chicken pesto pizza which had PINE NUTS on it!  PINE NUTS! (Those things are edging out beets as my favorite 'why-hello-there-how-did-you-get-on-the-menu' food in Pittsburgh restaurants lately.) The crust is perfect. I don't think I'll ever even try anything else on the menu, since I can't get past these awesome pizzas.\n\nSo, Papa J's is the perfect place to go if you want great booze and good food at decent prices in a neat atmosphere. They're in a great location downtown, and I've never had trouble getting a seat at the bar. I still haven't found any ghost activity, but as long as Frank is serving drinks, I'll certainly keep looking!",4
2658,"I wish more people went to Papa J's. It has great food, a truly unique atmosphere, and Frank. Frank the bartender is one cool guy. I'll get to him later.\n\nFirst, the ambiance. Very old building, low lighting, dark wood... a bit \""dodgy,\"" really.\n\nIt could be that the headboard of Madame Dolly Cavanaugh hangs above the bar. Yes, Papa J's used to be brothel in Pittsburgh's industrial heyday. But that's not all the whimsy the restaurant has to offer. Clutch the pearls and phone Rick Sebak, because it's also rumored to be haunted! Frankly, this doesn't surprise me. If you poke around a bit you half expect the members of Mystery Inc. to be disappearing behind false walls. Jinkies.\n\nThe food is good, comforting, and plentiful. The wedding soup is tasty and perfect for taking the chill off you in the winter.  All entrees come with fresh italian bread with dippings and range from $10-$20. You can choose from several pastas with a variety of sauces and meats. Try the veal bolognese pasta, served with tomato cream sauce. Delicious! They regularly have several daily specials, one of which is usually seafood. \n\nNow to Frank. He's a friendly older gentleman with lots of stories to tell. Usually, I drink beer or wine.  But when I'm at Papa J's, I simply let Frank pick my drink. Just tell him what you're in the mood for; something dry, fruity, bitter, or strong... and he will whip up something tasty.  \n\nI highly recommend Papa J's. Go there on one of those nights when you want to go out to eat, but can't quite figure out where to go. You're tired of chains, not in the mood for bar food, and don't want to spend a lot of money. Head to Papa J's Centro. Frank will fix you up!",4
2659,"GREAT POTENTIAL POOR EXECUTION\n\nI gave this place a try on Wednesday night.  Thought it would be a fun place for some tapas and drinks with friends.  Took a ground of 7 friends with me.  The drinks were very good, nice selection of Champagnes and beers.  My big issues stem from a very bad waiter and a menu that wasn't updated.\n\nI ordered the Charcuterie, which included torchon foie gras and duck rillettes.  When it came out it had neither of the items I was excited about.  It had some spicy sausage and some prosciutto and fresh tuna salad (not a joke).  When I asked the waiter about it he had no apologies and just asked if I wanted him to take it away. (several stars off for that).  One of my friends ordered the Croque Monsieur (a fav of mine) which was ok, but not quite good.  It seemed as if it was made by a staff member instead of a chef who knew what he was doing.  Another friend ordered the Pulled Pork Quesadilla which wasn't exactly as described in the menu either, but not bad.\n\nThe waiter came by several times to check on our drinks, etc but twice he came over to the table with his arms crossed (a huge no-no with me.)  Plus, the waiter asked for a card to run a tab for our table?  (even bigger turn off.)\n\nOverall I thought this place had great potential but its execution was way under par.  It could have been an off night, but just not sure where there are huge issues like this.",1
2660,"It's an odd place -- a former brothel that's reputed to be haunted, with a lot of dark polished wood decor. In all the times I've been there, it's never once been crowded. It's very noirish, even in the daytime; the sort of place you'd go to watch horse races -- desperately, of course, on which you'd just bet it all. And the guy at the other end of the bar hasn't been home in years, and the ominous bartender has a Dark Secret, and you'd better keep your damn beak out of it!\n\nExcept the bartenders here are actually quite warm, and not ominous at all. In fact, they're more than willing to learn your preferred arcane beverage recipes. One guy there, Frank, actually keeps a little book of new recipes he learns from customers, which I appreciated quite a bit. I also really enjoy the appetizers here, especially the flatbreads and the bruschetta, which are probably the least noirish foods imaginable.\n\nSo, ignore your instincts about this spooky-seeming place and check it out. The entrees are not terribly impressive, but it's a great stop for an evening with other plans in it.",4
2661,"Based on the AWFUL service I received the last three times I dined here I will never, ever come back to this restaurant--and it is a real shame bc I really wanted to like this place.\n\nStrike 1 (and the biggest offense) Light Up Night - I called for reservations but was hung up on and told we didn't need them.  My party of 4 arrived at 5ish expecting a packed restaurant but the place was EMPTY.  We asked for a table and were told due to the amount of reservations it was going to be an hour.  I get that--but the place was EMPTY.  The host was NOT gracious about this, instead he seemed frazzled and bothered by our being there.\n\nWe sat at the super cool looking bar and ordered drinks and asked if we could order appetizers to the bar.  The bartender, who was a complete dick, said, \""I have a full house tonight, I'm not going to take food orders at the bar.\""  \n\nI'd like to mention this guy is apparently the bar tender at the Papa J's in Carnegie--not the regular bartender who is awesome.\n\nThe place is EMPTY.  We order drinks.  And we wait, and we wait, and we wait.  All the while we can see empty tables and I kept thinking...you know...if you had just sat us we would have been out of here by now!  So I asked the bartender who was helping the host...  \""Why can't you just seat us since the place is empty, its been an HOUR and we just want to know when you think we might get seated.\""  We would have left but honestly we were invested with our time at this point.  The bartender said, \""Well, for all the people who could take the time to make a reservation, we hold a table for them.\""  Well...yikes.  If this is how you act no wonder your restaurant has been dead every single other time we have been there.\n\nWhen we finally were sat, we were seated in a tiny table wedged in a room with a huge party that was three sets of parents and like, their 36 screaming children.  It was such a nightmare.\n\nTurns out they had the regular bartender waiting tables that night and he felt so bad about our wait and where we got seated he took one of the entrees off the bill.  So that was cool, but not enough to make up for his moron coworker.\n\nStrike 2 - If you go there for lunch and you order a hamburger, expect the waitress to give you attitude if you ask for cheese.  \""Yeah, if you didn't know this was an italian restaurant and we only have mozzerella.\""  Really?  I didn't know hamburgers were traditional Italian fare.  I wouldn't have been that upset but my hamburger--which was burnt, flavorless, and tasted like freezer burn along with my diet coke came to $14.00.  For a burger.  and a coke.  The prices here can be ridiculous.\n\nStrike 3-  Empty restaurant.  I mean, EMPTY.  My friend and i are there and we had bread wiith our meals.  Our thing of olive oil was empty, and there was a full thing of olive oil on the table next to ours.  NO ONE ELSE in the same dining room.  I took the olive oil off the table next to ours.  Our waitress came over and was like, \""Ma'am, this is not a free for all, you can't just take things from the tables if you need something you have to ask.\""  WTF!  There was no one there and it was just olive oil... and also had she been attentive, I wouldn't have needed to take the olive oil.  She would have brought us a full one.\n\nSo, I've tried this place 5 times and that was enough.  I dont know how it remains open but I suspect it will close soon.  Not worth the attitude of the staff.  They dont seem to appreciate the few customers they do have which is a shame, bc when I like a restaurant I recommend it and I bring my friends there.",1
2662,"My girlfriend and I were staying downtown for a couple nights and wanted to have a drink close to the hotel. This was the third of three gay bars we went into that night. (we didn't even have a drink at the second one) And it was by far our favorite. Not a lot of female patroons so if you're a lady on the prowl, I would probably go somewhere else. But if you just want to relax in a comfortable, friendly atmosphere with some decent music, this is the place!\n\nThere were two bartenders and we happened to sit on Jeff's side. I'm sure they were both quite capable but Jeff was amazing at making us feel comfortable and chatted with us quite a bit until it got later and business picked up. Even then, he made sure we were taken care of. He's pretty much amazing and has great eyebrows.\n\nI guess there was some craziness and fighting by the door and outside as the night got later but we never saw it and it didn't clear out the whole bar. I would expect a downtown bar to have a few problems and it seemed like they were taken care of efficiently. No strikes there.\n\nWe stuck to beers and the prices were very reasonable considering the downtown location. Apparently happy hour runs until midnight! We were able to both have some drinks on the cheap and listen some good music. Definitely returning whenever we're there again!",4
2663,I can't find a complaint about this place.  Drinks are reasonable.  Only ever seems to be a $1 cover.  Couches for lounging.  Pool table.  Room for dancing if you want to (no one hardly seems to).\n\nStaff is super friendly.  During Pride it is a place you can stop into to get a drink cheaper than the beer tents outside.,5
2664,"Awesome things about Mon Aimee:\n\na. Kind, knowledgeable, attentive staff.\n\nb. Excellent variety of chocolates from throughout the US as well as tons of international options. (two favorites: Poco Dolce from San Francisco and Eclipse from San Diego)\n\nc. New products appear frequently (exciting for a regular visitor)\n\nd. As other reviewers have enthusiastically mentioned, CAPOGIRO GELATO, dark chocolate flavor. Seriously, the best I've found in the US (...and by that I mean darkest chocolate. It's always too light elsewhere!). We're really lucky they distribute it in Pittsburgh. \n\nMy only caveat would be that for items you can find in the grocery store, such as Chocolove bars, you're better off grabbing them at Whole Foods, Giant Eagle, or Right by Nature - you may save about a buck per bar.",4
2665,"The owner and her parents are delightful, helpful and kind. I often stop in here for a little treat or blast from the past. I grew up in England and love that I can buy chocolates that I loved as a child. If you need a recommendation or a gift, they are always willing to help you choose something or put together a little gift basket within your price range.",5
2666,"I don't think I've ever seen this great a variety of chocolate assembled in one place in my life! I think Augustus Gloop might have a heart attack and die in here, clutching a chocolate bar in his hand. \n\nThey have chocolate from all over the world in weird and exotic flavors to normal ones too. My two nephews were allowed to pick anything they wanted, and so were my husband and I. We didn't buy much, but what we did buy, between us all, cost my sister about $100! On chocolate!!\n\nI think it's a great place to stop in if you have a choco hankering, or are in the market to try something new.",5
2667,"This is one of the hardest places to walk by when you're in the Strip and not be tempted to walk in to. If you're a chocolate lover who's looking for some variety, you'll be overwhelmed and satisfied. Looking for gelato in the warmer months? Head to the back fo the store for something delicious! There's really not much else to the store other than a great selection of chocolates from nearly every corner of the globe.\n\nThe negatives are the service and the prices. Some of the chocolates that you'll find at Mon Aimee can be found significantly cheaper at places like Wegman's (if you're lucky enough to live near one), and we've spent a premium on certain candies in the past that we knew we could get cheaper elsewhere. Sometimes the convenience is worth it, though.\n\nAs for the service, it's a mixed bag. Generally, I've had trouble getting service when looking at the chocolates in the cases, and the staff never seems to be in a friendly mood. While I GUESS they're doing their customers a favor by procuring such a vast variety of chocolate, I'm not sure they should ACT like they're doing us a favor by existing. This strange air of arrogance has always been a turnoff, but what can I say...they have delicious treats;)",4
2668,"The gelato counter was disappointing.  The woman who served us told us that it was \""rated in the top 5\"" gelatos in the country and added that it was \""from Philadelphia.\""  Isn't that the same as \""not made fresh in Pittsburgh?\""  \nWhen we asked if we could mix flavors, she said that we couldn't do that because \""it's too messy.\""  What she should have said was that the portion would be too small to able to mix.  She oh so carefully dipped less than a full scoop and dropped it in the cup.  The gelato wasn't good enough to be short scooped, even in a fancy chocolate shop in the Strip district.  Maybe they figure that the tourists who stop there won't be coming back anyway.  \nIf you find yourself at Mon Aimee Chocolat and want gelato, leave immediately and go to Mercurio's on Walnut St. in Shadyside.   There you'll find better gelato, more flavors, which you can mix, and you'll be served with a smile.",1
2669,Chocolate heaven! There are chocolate bars from all over the world. And the unique wrapping makes you wanna buy all the chocolate if it didn't make such a huge dent in your wallet. \n\nDon't forget to try out their little gelato stand while you're there.,4
2670,"Soft, made to order bagels. Great low-fat smoothies. Staff is always nice and patient with my gazillion order changes. There's so many great choices! They also have texting sign-ups and I get free coffee and bagels with my orders all the time.",5
2671,"There's nothing about this specific location that is bad.  It's the Einstein Bagels food itself.  I got a Santa Fe Egg wrap, and I don't understand how they can use the term \""egg\"" in the name.  There's no way in hell that slimy yellow gelatin came from a chicken!   Absolutely horrible.",1
2672,"This produce stand is a wonderful resource if you're looking to eat healthy on a tight budget.  A quantity of produce that would cost $40-$50 at Giant Eagle or another supermarket will probably only set you back less than $20 here.  Recently I bought: 5 pounds of apples for $2, bags of baby spinach for $1, an entire flat of mangoes for $8, red bell peppers for under $2/pound... it's like prehistoric prices on some of this stuff.  The selection is decent: you can pretty much always find the type of vegetable you're looking for.\n\nThere are only 2 things that hold Stan's away from a five-star rating.  One is that the market is not really very well-heated in winter, so you will freeze in here if you aren't warmly dressed.  The other is that you have to be very careful in your assessment of what you are about to buy.  That $1 head of cauliflower, or the $1 quart of strawberries, is priced very low for a reason, which is typically because about half of the cauliflowers or baskets of strawberries have gone bad.  At Stan's, if you don't like to do the old-ladyish careful and minute inspection of the produce you're about to buy, you will probably come to regret it.",4
2673,"As the saying goes...\""you get what you pay for\"". 100% true. \n\nYes, the fruits and vegetables here are dirt cheap, and yes sometimes you end up with a moldy potato. But, moral of the story here is you have to double check before you buy anything. If you end up with a moldy potato then that's your own fault for being so oblivious. Stan's Market taught me to be a smarter and more aware shopper. \n\nI'm poor. Stan's Market is cheap. I love Stan's Market.",4
2674,"This ice cream parlor isn't just \""vintage\"" -- it's the real deal.\n\nKlavon's originally opened in the 1920's, closed in the 1970's for 20 years, and then re-opened in 1999 by a family member.  Many original details remain, including the marble soda fountain counter and the amazing stained glass windows in the front of the building.\n\nThe ice cream flavors are pretty standard.  \n\nIt's a little bit off the beaten path, but definitely worth making a trip for a fun treat and a peek back in time.",4
2675,"Why do people head to Klavon's?  Walking through the door is like walking through a time portal to a simpler time when people were less rushed and people were more chill.\n\nKlavon's used to be a drugstore and the original owner used to be a pharmacist first with the soda fountain as an aside.  The store was closed for 20 years until the current owners, grandkids of the original Klavon decided to reopen it in honor of their dad and grandpa.\n\nAs for their menu, they have all the standards you would expect of an old school ice cream parlor with milk shakes, sundaes, soda floats, as well as just basic ice cream.\n\nBe sure to bring cash, because even though they take debit, there's a service fee to use it.",4
2676,"We just happened to wander in after an afternoon of exploring Pittsburgh.  What a gem!  What a lucky place to stumble in!\n\nKlavon's was a drugstore/soda fountain in the early 1900s.  All the original counters, glass cases filled with old bottles, stools, and mixers are still there.  We had the turtle sundae with amaretto whipped cream, which was amazing.  I can't wait to come back and try their phosphates and egg creams!  It was like stepping into a time machine. You can tell this place is beloved by locals; several elderly couples, families with children, and single people with dogs on leash came by for cones, sundaes, and floats on the beautiful sunny day.  The grandson of the original owners was chatting with customers, and the place had a really special vibe.\n\nYou almost never see places like this anymore - if you're in Pittsburgh, don't miss it!",5
2677,"The ice cream here--the cones, the sundaes, splits, milkshakes, ice cream soda floats--is good but not extraordinary.  You won't find exotic or trendy flavors here, but the good ol' standbys.  What makes Klavon's a place to visit is its atmosphere.\n\nI feel like I should walk into this place wearing bobby socks and a poodle skirt (my sense of history is flawed, as this is a 1920s ice cream parlor), with some dude in a letterman jacket.  But I felt just as welcome in my Summer 2010 duds.  My friend and I sat on stools right by the counter and enjoyed looking all around as we ate (Chocolate Delight sundae--with chocolate whipped cream!--for me, and an orange soda ice cream float for her).  \n\nSometimes I feel awkward taking photos inside eateries, but felt comfortable here as I snapped pictures of the old school phone booths (just decorative) and the glass cases filled with relics.  This also seems like a good place to check out if you want some old-timey candy that's otherwise hard to find.",4
2678,"When I die I hope I come back as an ice cream bowl at Klavon's so I can forever spend my days covered in mint chocolate chip and watching people smile. I don't know...maybe not, but I do love mint chocolate chip and old skool ice cream parlors and Klavon's does both really well. \n\nThis is a list of things at Klavon's that make me feel like vintage stuff isn't only for grandparents and ice cream isn't just for kids: Amaretto flavored whipped cream, swivel stools with red tops, high backed wooden booths, a man behind the counter with a pure white handlebar mustache, a hammered tin ceiling, and large pecan balls.\n\nYou can go with chocolate or vanilla, but when I get the chance to have a pecan ball, I'm no idiot, I take it. A pecan ball, my friend, is ice cream rolled in pecans, covered in hot fudge or caramel and then topped with whipped cream. That's all tasty, nutty, fudgy goodness, but if you wake up feeling like painting the town gold and you want something that tastes like it was made for Cleopatra by Mark Antony's own hands, get a scoop of coffee, a scoop of pecan and top it with Amaretto whipped cream: I'm hoping to get this added to the menu under the name \""Magic Magic Explosion.\"" \n\nThey have a picture of Joe Biden posing with the owners; it's taped to the mirror behind the bar and quite adorable. \""He was very nice and left $20 for the next little girl in line to buy her ice cream with,\"" the owner told me.  Also, $20 worth of ice cream?! Two scoops only runs five bucks. Joe Biden--excuse me, Mr. Biden--you are a true American hero and I, for one, am happy someone finally realized the importance of children having tons and tons and tons of ice cream. \n\nGood show, sir, good show.",5
2679,"Worth a visit from across the country. Klavon's recalls about 100 years ago with its true ice cream soda fountain days. It's been in the same family since around the strike of 1900 when it was a drug store and turned into this sometime in the last century. The styling seems to be a better and more true throwback than even Pittsburgh itself. Who would not like this has no soul.\n\nI only sampled the hot chocolate and two types of whipped cream, but I give it 5-stars anyways. I feel like this is an intelligent guess. The whipped cream was my favorite of all time, the amaretto whip didn't even strike me as amaretto, it swooned me lightly.",5
2680,"There are five reasons why you might want to go to Klavon's.\n1. You're in the Strip District anyway.\n2. You're interested in Pittsburgh history.\n3. You've never experienced an old-time soda fountain before.\n4. You're looking for some hard-to-find penny candy.\n5. You want some damn good ice cream.\n\nI went for all five reasons, and I wasn't disappointed. Wait. That doesn't express the depths of my enthusiasm for Klavon's. KLAVON'S RULES!!!!!!!!! There, that's better.\n\nLet's take it in order. You have lots of dining options in the Strip. Now, Klavon's is a few blocks away from most of the popular places (we were at Salem's, which is also great, but that's another review), but it's easy to walk to and easy to find with all the neon signs.\n\nWhen you walk in to Klavon's, you're taken back in time. Choose a little booth or table, and gaze at the decor. Maybe you'll see an old liniment bottle from back when Klavon's was a drugstore. Maybe you'll notice the high-water mark from the 1936 flood (close to the ceiling!). Maybe you'll see the old penny scale or the phone booths. This is a place where history is celebrated.\n\nThe menu isn't extensive, but you still have lots of choices. Why not try an old-time phosphate, malted, or egg cream? It was good enough for your great-grandpa; it's good enough for you. I treated myself to a root beer float. It was the best I ever had. The reason? Both the root beer and the ice cream were made locally. On the way out, why not browse the penny candy racks? For a quarter, you can try a bunch of hard-to-find treats.\n\nI'd be remiss if I didn't mention that Mr. Klavon, the grandson (I think) of the original owner, still runs the place. A glipse of his epic mustache alone is worth the visit, but he's always willing to give you a tour. Friendly people in friendly Pittsburgh. I can't wait to go back!",5
2681,"\""Could have bought it in a store\"" Hershey ice cream that had the crystal-y signs of freezer burn.  Totally disinterested staff included a girl that was texting when we walked in and shouting into her cell phone when we walked out.  No one gave us a bill and I had to interrupt the person at the cash register to get her to take my money.  Didn't even get a \""thanks\"" with my change.\n\nSo not worth the walk that we took to get here.",1
2682,"Mannnnn, I'd LOVE to get invited out on a date here!\n\nI mean, it's perfectly adorable and ever-so-vintage. You've got antique decor (though oddly, they don't feel antique here - it just feels like you've stepped back in time and the whole world is like that), yummy ice cream cones and shakes, candies from yesteryear (with prices to match!), and a friendly staff.\n\nI found this place via a LivingSocial coupon, which truly worked since I never would've known about it otherwise. Klavon's is tucked away in a somewhat deserted part of the Strip District, surrounded by abandoned industrial storefronts. I had the chocolate chip cookie dough cone, which in itself was pretty good, though not amazing. The milkshake and old-school candy? Totally awesome! Highly recommend due to the super sweet (no pun intended) step-back-in-time ambiance and homey feel.\n\nNow all you need is a hot date and a poodle skirt, right?!",4
2683,Easy 5. Authentic old school ice cream parlor with PSU ice cream ( peachy paterno etc). The ice cream soda was an outstanding ride in the wayback machine.,5
2684,Just found this gem.  This is a great place for every ice cream lover.  Great place to hang out with friends or to go on a date.\n\nI recommend the sundaes at this place.  This is pure 50's and 60's style that isn't forced.  Staff are very friendly and patient.,5
2685,"I had heard about Klavon's for some time, but never found myself in that area of the Strip.  The day I did, I did not hesitate to enter and taste the ice cream that had such excellent reviews. Firstly I discovered that there was new management. They definitely did not appear happy to see me enter. I was met with hostile stares. I approached and told them I had heard many good things about this store and its wares. No breaking of the ice. I ordered and was given a scoop of ice cream the size of a golf ball for four dollars.  Save your money and time.",1
2686,"Retta is knowledgeable, intuitive and strong.  She gives a great massage.",5
2687,"I made an appointment 3 weeks in advance when I was texted after I left\nA voicemail. It took a couple days to schedule as the woman, Retta, forgot her appointment book one of the days. \n\nWhen I showed up to my surprise it is looks like it would be a closet...right beside the elevator, no window, an office right next door that looks to take up most of the right side of the building. I gave it the benefit of the doubt and tried to open the door to go in...locked. Okay I think it's just one lady named, Retta. So I waited since my appointment was at 5 and it was 4:45. Around 4:55 I lightly knocked, nothing. I gave her a call and she didn't pick up. At this point I really had to use the restroom. I waited until 5 and knocked normally so that it would be heard. I sent her a text touching base and asking for the bathroom code. Around 5:05 I knocked again. 5:12 I called again and left her a voicemail letting her know I'd been waiting and would wait another 3 minutes before leaving and contacting Amazon local for a refund. I asked a few people if they'd ever been there and go the responses were all no. A few people I'd run into on my way knew where it was as they pointed it out to me. Around 5:15 the same men came back around and one knocked very loudly for me and they found me the bathroom code, thank god! So I come back at 5:20 and knock one last time. I left and have not heard from Retta and it is now 5:40. I'll be reaching out to Amazon Local for sure.",1
2688,"This hotel is in a great location right next to the convention center and  is walkable to PNC Park, Heinz Field, downtown bars, etc. \n\nRooms are clean with high ceilings and comfortable beds and pillows. The TVs are vintage mid 90s but who watches that much TV in a hotel room? \n\nThe only negatives are the lack of free breakfast (though they offer coffee in the lobby) and the $22 rate per day for valet parking. Save your money and park at the city garage right down the street which is about $5 or so per day. \n\nThey have a business center you can use to check your email, use the internet, price boarding passes, etc. free right by the front desk. All the staff was friendly too. \n\nI would stay here again in Pittsburgh if I can get a good rate.",4
2689,"I'd give it ZERO stars if i could. Worst customer service! My husband made an innocent mistake and confused the weekends for our trip back to his home town. We asked that we get the credit and offered to add a night to our stay. The hotel would be out NO money. But these corporate suits refused. So - they've lost a customer - a PLATINUM customer. We've given Marriott so much bloody money over the years, but these greedy suits could care less. A little goodwill would have cost them nothing. Where has good customer service gone????? Truly pathetic. And believe me - theres nothing special abt this hotel. The William Penn, the Doubletree, and several other hotels are FAR FAR FAR superior. Get good rates on Priceline. Heck - i'll even give a shout out to the Renaissance downtown -- it's not owned by the Courtyard jerks. Good luck! Go Steelers!",1
2690,"When I checked in, the front desk staff was missing.  When I checked out, the front desk staff was missing.  The valets had to be chased down every single time I needed to park or retrieve the car.  When I called a week later regarding the charges on my account, the first call was disconnected.  On the second call, I was put on hold for ten minutes before I gave up.  On the THIRD call, I asked the clerk to email me a copy of a form, and she informed me that the scanner was down and she would be unable to for several days.\n\nThe pillows were appalling and there was no complimentary breakfast and no refrigerator.\n\nDoes ANYBODY run the show here??  What a disgrace to the Marriott name.",1
2691,"Literally worst service i've ever received at a hotel. Was using a conference room for multiple days and had to beg snooty staff to come refill waters and clean the room. Also, policies like how much parking costs seem to change from visit to visit. \n\nTo sum up, i cringe thinking i'll ever have to speak to the people at the front desk again. The location is amazing, they have that going for them. \n\nDo not stay here. You will be disappointed.",1
2692,"This hotel is well located. However the staff, especially Zac don't care a bit if you have elite status or not. The staff is young. The manager nowhere to be seen. No upgrades. Room has high ceiling. So what. Not personal at all strictly business. Restaurant no great shakes. One of three. The better restaurant is the little cafe across the street owned by same owner. Bellhop seen limited times. To get a cab walk to the Westin across the street. Or take a bus. No hello on entering. Not friendly. So why stay here? Not a 4 star. Really a 3 star. Point redemption way too high. Nothing to recommend. Stay at the Westin across the street and kiss the staff there goodbye. Run. Don't walk away.  Not even the shuttle goes anywhere useful. \nLinda b august 2013 will never stay again!",1
2693,Do no stay here if you plan to sleep before 2:30 AM. They could not care less that there is a very loud bar directly across the street. If loudness doesn't bother you than this place is fine.,1

2695,"A very good Jewish deli tucked in and amongst the small factories and warehouses on Smallman Street in Pittsburgh's Strip District. I cannot believe this place has not been reviewed yet. I guess it is a best kept secret. \n\nThere were four in our party and we ordered a variety of sandwiches that ranged from a traditional Reuben, turkey and Swiss on a bagel to a pastrami and Swiss on marble rye and a turkey and cheese on a bread type that escapes me. Regardless, all the sandwiches were very good to excellent. The meat was lean and adequately piled on. The vegatables on the sandwiches were very fresh. All sandwiches came with a Kosher pickle spear and we opted for bags of Snyder of Hanover chips. I haven't had Snyder chips since I left Pittsburgh eons ago. \n\nThe amount of sandwiches offered were many. The staff were efficient and three-rivers friendly. \n\nI failed to realize that they offered Matzo ball soup. I will have to save that for a return trip to PGH. Since the in-laws live here, that's definitely going to happen.",4
2696,"I used to go to Sammys all the time for a corned beef sandwich whenever i came in town....until my mom took me to Smallman Street Deli! Best corned beef on rye...be sure to get it grilled!!! My sandwich...lean corned beef on marble rye, swiss cheese, grilled with lettuce, tomato, onion and spicy brown mustard!! Love this place!",5
2697,Great deli.  Had a very good Ruben today.  Great food and friendly service.   I'll definitely be eating here again.,4
2698,"Yuck I have avoided this Subway like the plague. It's too bad that this location is the most conveniently on the way to my job.  \n\nI literally walk past this Subway 5 times a week.  Even at 1:15pm it's never packed there for lunch and the reason why is  because their sandwiches stink. \n\nWhen I say gross I mean that the standards for food are as low as the standards for cleaning. \n\nThe attitude of the workers here is just pitiful. The don't care about making a good sandwich nor do they care about keeping the place clean. What a wreck. \n\nAs some one who eats at Subway 3 times a week I feel entitled to my opinion, avoid this subway.",1
2699,"This theater is a beautiful example of the elegance that theaters of the past have.  The restoration was done with fantastic attention to detail and it is so beautiful, you don't know where to look next.  In fact, you may get a stiff neck from looking at the stunning ceiling, sparkling chandilers and incredible detail.\n\nIf you have long legs, or prefer to have space when you sit, your best bet is to sit on the floor level.  Balcony seats provide a great view, but there is a considerably smaller amount of leg room.  This can make a difference in your level of enjoyment of a show.\n\nI've seen two broadway touring shows there and the quality of both was great.  Sound quality and lighting were great and I was impressed with the sets and staging that could be done on touring productions.\n\nMany times in older theaters, bathroom lines are an issue, but the layout and amount of bathrooms on the lower level of the theater make it less of an issue than it is at similiar locations.  And there is even a bar on that level.\n\nThe few downsides to the theater are the high prices for drinks (but that is expected at any location like this) and the lobby gets really cold on winter days from all the patrons coming in and out.  Theater doors usually open around a half hour before curtain time, so take that into consideration for your arrival time.",4
2700,Great theater !!! Absolutely beautiful .. Live the seating ... Seen Book of Mormon here !!! Loved it,5
2701,I like coming here. Saw the Lion King. Bathrooms get crowded so you better hurry.  I'll be back.,5
2702,"Giving my local businesses some loving. I frequent here & will never gives money elsewhere. There is a touch less car wash right down the street for the same prices who cleans half what this place does. I personally prefer an actual hand wash anyday. If you do come here, those these guys a buck or 2 in the tip. I've never had a guy here that didn't make sure every little mark or wet spot was off the car before I drove off the lot.",5
2703,The 3 course combo is a great deal!!! Cheap filling and downtown. You even get chocolate chip cookies. Sundae bar is still in a BATHTUB- \nbring a party- there's room for it and no one here.. people forget about it.,4
2704,"Incredibly slow, worst club I've ever had...hilite was the tortilla soup. That was actually edible. Waiting 40 minutes for a cold club and cup of soup is totally unacceptable. Especially when we were the 2nd table seated of the day.",1
2705,"I loved this place!\n\nGreat selection! I ordered 6 buffalo wings I wasn't really hungry) but they were super yummy! And I loved that they gave me more than enough bleu cheese!

Burger (average.)  and a chocolate chip cookie (super yummy)!\n\nThe waiter was very nice and even brought us an extra cookie! We tipped him 40%\nI am very impressed with the service, prompt and extra friendly!!\n\n\nHighly recommend this place! Great for kids too! So many options!\n=)",4
2706,"Yes, Max & Erma's is a chain, but not all are created equal.  The Max & Erma's at 630 Stanwix Street in downtown Pittsburgh is a great place for a casual meal.  They have very good food and service.  If you hit there during rush hour skip the waiting list and go to the bar for faster service. They have great burgers, but I like the choice of a half sandwich and soup or salad.  I also like the frequent diner program, which gives you a 5% discount after eating there about 5 times and a larger discount the more often you eat there.  They also send you specials via e-mail from time to time.  On Wednesdays they give you two free chocolate chip cookies with your meal. On your birthday month they give you six free chocolate chip cookies.  The cookies are usually served hot, right from the kitchen and are delicious. Max & Erma's also has a great bar.  This location is just across the river from PNC Park and Heinz Field.  You can grab the T about 1/2 block from Max & Erma's and get off at the North Shore stop, which is between the two stadiums.  There is also parking on the North Shore that is less expensive than parking in downtown Pittsburgh.",4
2707,"I treated my younger sister and kid brother out to dinner , to recognize their high PSSA scores and over all academic success so far this school year.  What can I say the kids just love this place.\n\nFor me the food was terrible.  I wouldn't even have cooked this way for an enemy. I got the cabo shrimp salad. This was four tiny dried up shrimp served in a bowl with ice berg lettuce an rotten tomatoes.  \n\nThe kiddies had Beatlejuices which is grape juice and Sprit with a gummy worms. They also had Oreo milk shakes which they demolished and said were super yummy. \nEach of them for dinner also had a cheese burger. The burger was juicy and delicious. \n\nI have to comment on th bathrooms. They are in terrible shape. The toilet paper rolls are broken so instead of fixing the toilet paper rolls Max and Erma's just sit the roll of toilet paper on top of the broken toilet roll. I couldn't believe it!",1
2708,"I had previously reviewed the Golden Palace buffet, stating that it was some of the worst Chinese food I've had.  Well, this place manages to be worse than it.\n\nThe place is rather run down.  The buffet was really terrible.  Food left to sit out in just its oil and a barely lit heat source.  It just wasn't a great environment.  Try something else, definitely!",1
2709,"I can't tell you how bad this place is, regretted not looking up on yelp for reviews before ordering for delivery.\n\nSeriously this place has the worst Chinese food I've had in my whole life!!!!!!!!!!",1
2710,Bad!!! Worst Chinese food in Pittsburgh!,1
2711,Dined in. Food had obviously been sitting out all day at the buffet. Lo Mien was soggy and had unidentified black grit in it.  Broccoli was clearly unwashed whenever it was cooked. Finally I ordered beef with broccoli and the meat looked pale like chicken but tasted to gamey to be chicken or beef. First time I ever wondered if I was being served cat.,1
2712,"I was recently in some training in Pittsburgh, and we came here towards the end of our class.\n\nThey had a sign on the curb outside that said they had \""the best prime rib\"".  Now, I don't think I can say that they had \""the best\"", but it was very good, and a pretty big serving too.\n\nOur waiter (John) was exceptional, excellent service, fun personality, very knowledgable.",5
2713,Stopped in for a quick drink on new years eve about 3 pm . The place was empty . The bartender Chris was rude and very vulger . He made a crude sexual comment as soon as we sat down . We decided to stay for a drink anyway . After going a couple of choices we were told the bar was out of most stock . On New Years Eve ??? The Bartender kept complaining about his job and bosses for the next 10 minutes . We paid for our drinks and got up and left . Might be the strangest employee experience I had in awhile .,1
2714,This is always one of my favorite stops when visiting the Strip. A wide variety of party favors and Pittsburgh paraphernalia.,5
2715,"I freakin' love this place. Anything you could possibly want, they've got it. And probably a lot of stuff that you don't want. \n\nI loved that everyone listed the crazy things they've seen there - they have all of that and so much more. 2 gems a friend got while we were there: a giant bottle of sriracha sauce & a fake tattoo sleeve. Ha!!\n\nAll I got was a postcard, this was the only place I found in the Strip District that sold them. \n\nWill definitely be back, and will remember to leave plenty of room in my suitcase next time!",5
2716,"Have you ever had a party, and needed like, a lot of random things for it? This is your spot. They have EVERYTHING: Mardi Gras beads, tableware, Pittsburgh sports goodies, weird plastic babydolls, I mean EVERYTHING. If Stefon from SNL ever featured a party store, this would be the place!\n\nPrices are good: on my most-recent visit, I managed to get supplies for party giftbags for 70 people for only $70 bucks. Pretty awesome!\n\nDo you want to throw a Halloween party? How about a cowboy party? How about a Hawaiian NASCAR bachelorette party on St. Patrick's Day? You can totally pull that off with the help of Feinberg's!\n\nAnd in the event that you can't find just what you're looking for, the staff is super helpful and will go out of their way to get you what you need.\n\nSomething to note: you can only use a credit card if you spend more than $10, so if you're just buying a few things, bring cash. They're open on Saturdays, so it can become part of your normal Strip District stroll!",4
2717,"What's this, a fifth review of a hotdog stand?  Read on o' Downtown diners!\n\nIt figures.  The other day I was telling my Yelp friend Mike O. about my sudden lunchtime craving for encased meats.  I figured hey, it being a nice day why not get a dog with all the goodies on it and dine al fresco?  It's mid-October--how many more outdoor dining days are we gonna have?  So I got me a regular dog loaded up with all the goodies, fries, and a drink.  Mmmm-mmm good, right?",4
2718,"Solid dogs, ESP if you are a dog fanatic. Gravy Fries are awesome. I have lunch here everyday I am in Pittsburgh. Much better than Franktuary.",4
2719,"Every time I come here, hoping, just hoping that I'm going to have a couple delicious hotdogs. Raw. Unfiltered. Old school. Like a ballpark from the 1920's or something.\n\nBut each time I come away disappointed, even more than last time.\n\nMy father worked here three or four decades ago. I'd love to love this place and recommend it to my friends.\n\nThe service is anywhere from good to great, and they are fast and friendly!\n\nAnd maybe, just maybe, I come when the hotdogs have been sitting on the grill too long. At odd hours. or an hour after the rush.\n\nEvery time, the hotdogs (and brats) are harder than a rock.  Not a snappy casing, no, this is like barely edible hard exterior.\n\nSo what's a man to do? Try again?  Sadly, I'll probably forget about my recent experiences, and try them again.\n\nI just hope they are fresher next time, because I can't imagine them worse than today.",1

2721,I walked into Sammy's expecting a ny style corned beef sandwich and that is not what you get. I don't think Sammy has ever even had a good corned beef sandwich. Meat was dry under seasoned and Luke warm. The bread was just sliced supermarket bread. I hate to say it but giant eagle makes a better sandwich than this place. Don't waste your time,1
2722,"If you plan on getting married here please ask them what their rules are regarding wedding photography and videography before you book.  They have very strict rules here and your hired professionals will have severe limitations on where they can be and what they can do.\n\nUnfortunately I see this kind of thing all too often and the church's reason being that they want to \""preserve the sanctity of the ceremony and the religion.\""  Meanwhile guests are taking video and photos with their smart devices.  If churches, like this one, wanted to preserve the sanctity of the ceremony than their rules should apply to all, not just the people hired by the couple to be there.",1

2726,"After a work happy hour a few doors away, several of us were looking for a place to eat, and were having a hard time deciding. I was the pain in the tukkhas, since I'd driven my antique car, and kind of needed to be able to park it where I could see it, plus, I'd really planned the evening to be a birthday dinner for one of the co-workers. We decided to split up, and me and the birthday girl go somewhere, and the rest would hit something within walking distance. Then as Birthday girl and I got to my car, we realized we were parked in front of a restaurant, and Mahoney's won out by default.\n\nWe should have gotten in the car and driven somewhere else.\n\nThe atmosphere was pleasant enough, but the food...yeesh.\n\nEveryone placed their orders, mostly sandwiches of one variety of another, sided with fries, plain or sweet potato, or slaw. I ordered the Reuben hoping for the best, but definitely not receiving it.\n\nMichael's chicken breast with plain fries arrived with sweet potato fries, and instead of just bringing him a side of regular fries, they took the whole plate back to make the switch. Kim's turkey Rachel arrived, and as it was handed in her direction, half of the stuffing fell off the plate and onto the floor. The server took the plate back to the kitchen so that Rachel could be re-stuffed, and for the rest of the evening her initial guts laid right there on the floor. Kim #2 had a fried fish sandwich, which looked a little withered, and then there was my Reuben. More like an Ewwwwww-ben.\n\nThe bread was dry as chalk, and the corned beef had been so overdone, it looked like bacon sticking out of the bread. Dry, dry, dry...and I took maybe two bites of the slaw, and that was quite enough.\n\nThe prices aren't steep, but seriously people, take some pride in what you're handing off to a customer. Would YOU eat that?? Seriously, put that order down on the counter in front of you...and take one minute to LOOK at it...then make one exactly like it for yourself. Are you gonna eat that? If not, um, why would we want to pay for it?\n\nThe service was pleasant enough, and the atmosphere was comfortable enough for nice conversation. But would I go back? Nope. The food, my reason for going to a restaurant, was dreck.\n\nMy apologies to my co-workers for forcing them to try it along with me.",1
2727,"Excellent food, nice beverages, more than fair prices, & great service. Waitress remembered us & was a doll. Owner Elias is a delightful gent & such a really welcoming character. We'll be back. Very pleased.",5
2728,Terrible. The food they brought us didn't match what was on the menu. They brought out a different wine then we ordered and didn't tell us until we ask. They messed up out bill. They didn't accommodate for a member of our group that had an allergy. The beer was skanked. The soda was flat. Possible the worst restaurant I was ever in.,1
2729,"Worst experience at a restaurant ever.  I don't need anything fancy but this was pathetic.  My coke was colored water, when I sent it back she said they just changed it.  Came back and said we don't have coke, would you like a sprite.  The sprite was flat but I was afraid to order a water after that.  Why didn't we just leave then.  The menu had quite a few spelling errors we joked about but no joke - don't go here.  If I could rate this a zero, I would.",1

I LOVE the Fortunes Coffee's.  We don't live there but stumbled into this place while walking down the Strip District.  I bought their Pumpkin Spice coffee & brought it to my son's house there to brew.  It was AWESOME!  So I had to go back & buy plenty more of both reg & decaf.  Now everytime we go back to Pittsburgh we have to go there & stock up.  If you want good tasting coffee, get it there!  The people there are very nice & helpful also!  I am drinking a cup of their coffee right now here in Florida & about to order some on their website!  YUMMY!!",5
2731,"I visited this gallery during a PA trip in August and forgot to add my inaugural visit's review. Why add it now? More people need to know about this gallery.\n\nArt spaces that stimulate on intellectual and emotional levels are far and few, especially in the Midwest. This gallery's curated installations corrects this. After finding the entrance on the corner of Wood and Sixth, we took the elevator up to the gallery above the T-Station to immediately find a hospitable gentleman sitting quietly at a dimly lit table in a small hallway area. He explained a little about the installation and directed us around the corner to Ryoji Ikeda's audiovisual installation piece data.tron. Simply amazing. It was a total immersion within site and sound with ample room to stand or sit to fully experience the projections.\n\nIf you love installation and the arts leaving this place will be bittersweet. Wood Street feeds the famine but leaves you hungry for more.",5
2732,"The gallery is right above the Wood Street T/Bus Station and can easily be missed, well at least that was the case for me. Having gone through that station at least few times a day during my college days - I never once realize there was a gallery above the station.\n\nSince last year's gallery crawl - I've gone there few times including during this year's gallery crawl. Depending on your view towards art - this place can be pretty interesting with their showcase of some unconventional art piece. Most of the time - the entire floor consists of one major art piece.\n\nThis is definitely a stop for any art lovers.",4
2733,"My husband and I have used Amtrak to get from Pittsburgh to Chicago and we have also used it to get to Altoona, Lancaster, and Harrisburg, PA.  We like using it to get to Chicago because the schedule isn't that bad--it leaves late at night an arrives early the next morning.  We always get the sleeper car.  When Amtrak is on time, or if it's less than say an hour late, it can be wonderful.  The problem is that Amtrak is at the mercy of the freight railroads that own the tracks. \n\nLast year, according to my husband the train enthusiast, the train was constantly arriving into Chicago 4 to 5 hours late because of extreme frieght train congestion.  We avoided it then, but since then the company that owns the tracks has gotten its act together and its been much better.  It's also nice that your food travels with you and you can get up and stretch your legs when you want to.\n\nAmtrak used to run two trains a day to Chicago and two across Pennsylvania.  Unfortunately, budget cuts a few years ago caused one of these to be cancelled, so it is much less convenient.  Also, the train to Washington, DC leaves Pittsburgh in the wee hours of the morning.\n\nOne thing I like is that Amtrak, upon 24 hours notice, will provide refridgeration or ice for my insulin.  If you are a \""special needs\"" traveller, they can usually accomodate you with advanced notice.  One other tip.  If you are using Amtrak, you can actually check your trains' on-time record using the website.  You can see which trains have good on-time records and which don't (and believe my husband when he says it varies from route to route).  You should also ALWAYS call Amtrak's number 1-800-USA-RAIL before you head out to the train station to check whether or not it will be on time.",4
2734,"Wow.  What a difference a few years makes.  Back in the late 90s, I used to ride the Pennsylvanian to H'burg a few times a year.  Took the train this past weekend for a meeting -- out Sunday morning and back yesterday afternoon -- and I was amazed by the experience.\n\nI see the other reviews about the station.  Forget the station.  Any train station.  They're all sad and they offer very little in the way of amenities.  You're not there for the station; you're there for the ride.  \n\nFirst and foremost, the trains were on time for both trips.  In fact, we arrived in H'burg and Pgh EARLY!  \n\nNot only has the on-time performance improved, but the service on the train is MUCH better than I remember.  The conductors and cafe staff are warm, friendly and helpful.   More like hosts than employees.   \n\nNow I did spend the extra $19 to get \""business class\"" seats.  It's a Metroliner car with more room between seats and a power outlet in each row.  AND FREE WIRELESS INTERNET for nearly the entire journey!  You also receive unlimited non-alcoholic beverages and a newspaper.   I think I drank more than $19 worth of beverages on each leg of the trip.   \n\nYea, I could have driven the route in about three hours and the train took five hours, but I arrived in H'burg without being burned out from navigating the gawdawful turnpike.   Plus, I was able to get some work done.  Not as much as I had planned, mind you, because I spent most of the time looking out the window at the scenery.  It's a series of wonderful views between Greensburg and Harrisburg.",4

Norfolk Southern owns these tracks. Unbeknownst to the lay traveler there has been delays BOTH ways on this route for the past 2 to 3 months.  Freight cars get preference. 7 mile stretch in Indiana with only one track.  Delay was 6 hours going to Chicago and over 7 hours coming back.

I did find a vending machine to get coffee but even that was watered down. \n\nThis place needs to be torn down and rebuilt from the bottom up. I waited with my family down the street at a different station before we had to be back to board our train. \n\nI will be sure to not have this place in any of my future stops.

2738,Did not enjoy my meal what so ever.The staff was cold and the seating area was dirty. The place was more of a hole in the wall then I can appreciate. Cheap but your getting what you pay for in quality.,1
2739,"If a place downtown isn't busy at lunch time then either you're much more wise than the hundreds of thousands of professionals OR the place stinks.  Fu Lai is the later.  \nThe food was gross and I usually wouldn't say that about a place.  My General Tso's seemed to have been previously frozen and I think I got 100% gristle.  I don't shriek at the sight of MSG, but this place uses a bit much.  I got a whopping 2 pieces of wilted broccoli and 1 sliver of onion in my dish and the sauce ewww the sauce.  Not sure why I stepped into Fu Lai, probably because I wanted some cheap Chinese.  Never going back.",1
2740,Worst Chinese I've had in Pittsburgh. I ordered pork fried rice.,1
2741,"The preparation was fast and the price was very reasonable but it doesn't make up for the fact that everything had a bad, weird taste and the food inevitably made us very sick afterwards. We ordered for pick up and they forgot our drinks and plastic ware. I will definitely never order from here again. Absolutely disgusting.",1
2742,"I live downtown & I LOVE Chinese food. Living down here it's been wonderful having the ability to have things delivered other than pizza. \nSO... my fianc\u00e9 & I order from here often enough that I believe they know us by name practically.\nEverything we've ordered has been really good. Not epic good... but good.. EXCEPT their peppered chicken IS amazing good. BIG AWESOME GOOD... a must if you order from here.... it's basically the best thing they have on their entire menu.. I'm pretty sure that's totally accurate. \nI order online mostly but when I do call in an order - the person who answers is always nice - easy to understand. The delivery person is always smiley & super nice too.\nOne time they forgot our steamed dumplings - I called & told them the problem... the person came back & delivered them within a few minutes of the mishap & was super apologic & really sweet.\nI know this place has gotten some rotten reviews over some time but it's very easy to do that as people don't always give the happy reviews when they're pleased typically.\nSO, I say - give it a try people - order the peppered chicken - it's excellent - you're welcome in advance & if you're happy - write a happy review. :)",5
2743,"Stopped by Mark's for a quick bite to eat last night.  Both outside and in the place looks like an ordinary, run-of-the-mill bar, so I wasn't expecting anything special.  Then I saw that they had Dogfish Head and East End beers on tap - nice, I figured they'd just have macros.  I ordered a 60 minute IPA and a double-decker corned beef/pastrami Reuben.  The sandwich was amazing - fresh bread, lots of good meat, house-made dressing and slaw, and a heap of thick, flavorful, house-made chips.  It was easily the best sandwich I've had in Pittsburgh; admittedly this isn't saying much, but this sandwich would hold its own anywhere.  And at only $7 for a huge meal it's a great value, too.  I'll definitely be visiting Mark's again soon.",4
2744,"Great place. I prefer the cheese here over Penn Mac any day! Plus, the french feta is to die for!",5
2745,"I went to the Strip to buy cheese for a few recipes I was going to try.  Since this was my first time buying cheese in the strip, I was planning on making my purchase at the more popular place next door.  However, I ended up buying everything from Stamoolis instead.  I like quality, but I also like a good price and I got both at Stamoolis.  It was nice to be able to get what I needed for a cheaper price than some other places.  I also love the bulk items here inlcuding the organic whole wheat coucous.\n\nMy only problem, even though it was minor for me was the the staff did not seem overly friendly or helpful.",4
2746,"I stop here every time I am in the Strip.  Authentic Greek grocery.  Do not pass up their stuffed grape leaves or the freshly made Babaganous & hummus.  They have great cheeses and a variety of dried lentils and spices.  You will find something delicious here, I promise you that.",4
2747,"A great Mediterranean food store. I was impressed by the quality and low price of the bulk spices. If you're having trouble finding a spice in Pittsburgh, then give this place a shot.\n\nThere were also several trays of Greek desserts. Bot only Were there a couple of expected sweets such as baklava and honey cookies but also chocolate baklava and mixed assortments.\n\nThe store's biggest selection of goods is in deli meats and cheeses. I picked up some hot sausage and found the price per pound to be the lowest in Pittsburgh.\n\nI also liked that the store carries some harder to find goods such as tahini.\n\nStamoolis Bros is certainly worth a stop when shopping int the strip considering their prices and selection.",4
2748,"I wish I lived close to this store. Unfortunately we don't have anything like this in the Phoenix area.\nI could write a ton of stuff about their selection. Wonderful choices, amazing prices, helpful staff and Chocolate Baklava.\nI wish I had more room in my suitcase when I left town. \nI will be back next year looking for more goodies to take home.\nTake your time looking around, you'll find lots to love and try for the first time.",5
2749,"Do not use this dry cleaner. The staff/owner smokes in the store. There are ash trays and packs of cigarettes lying around. I had to \""air out\"" my clothes after I picked them up from Galardi's to try to get rid of the cigarette smell. YUK!",1
2750,They lost my clothes and charged me for stuff I never sent.\n\nClearly they do not know what they are doing and need to get their act together!!,1
2751,"DO NOT GO HERE! They staple your name to your clothes because they can't handle organizing your things. Even with that, they've lost my clothes before. And now I just got a $110 sweater back from being dry cleaned and the loop to hold the tassel on is ripping off. They are clearly incompetent. Not only that, the place smells like an ashtray when you walk in. How are your clothes even clean when they come from that? Awful.",1
2752,"Not only did they damage a sweater, they told me they would take care of it with my tailor and never did.  On top of that, they write in PERMANENT MARKER on your clothes! Unbelievable! Stay away from this place.  Take the time and take your clothes somewhere else.",1
2753,"I used Galardi's for ~ 4 months when I first moved to Pittsburgh. I've since changed cleaners. I think Galardi offers great service for pick up and deliver dry cleaning in the downtown area. The owner is actually a nice lady; but, after nearly having 3 shirts ruined I decided enough was enough. \n\nI think their delivery guy is a huge part of the problem, I actually like the owner, but I can't keep having my clothes messed up and not have anyone take responsibility for it. I wish I could tell people to go here but I can't do it in good conscience.",1
2754,"This is a great little store.  I walked right in off the street and asked if I could have scraps of silk, wool, cotton, leather and polyester.  I was met with a ready smile and whisked through the store where one of the workers was gracious enough to assist me and cut small swatches of fabric from the rolls.  This store looks well stocked and I really appreciated getting the small swatches for free.  This location made it very easy for me to find what I was looking for. \n\nThank you so very much Gene Sanes Upholstery.",5
2755,"My mom called me so giddy on the phone today, I thought she was going to tell me she won the lottery.  No.  Her sofa from Gene Sane arrived.  It made her just as happy.  \n\nShe and I went to Gene Sane a few months ago and found fabric for a sofa and chair.  The fabric was not inexpensive.  Some of that they have is really beautiful designer fabric, some of it is not so special and I am convinced could be found elsewhere for less.  However, they did have excellent customer service throughout the entire upholstering process.  And my parents ended up getting two sofas and three chairs done there.\n\nMy parents live in Oakland in a condo building with a ridiculously small elevator.  Gene Sanes went above and beyond to make sure this extremely long sofa from my grandma would fit in the elevator at my parents' building.  They brought the sofa mid-upholstery to the building just to make sure it would fit into the elevator.  That is such great customer service it is ridiculous.  It did fit, which is great, but their backup plan was to upholster it as two pieces which would then seamlessly be fit together as one inside the apartment.  This is the kind of stuff that high end places in NYC know how to do and even though they ended up not having to do it in this case, it was good to know they have the skills to do so.  They were also great with attention to detail of lining up all the stripes on all the cushions both front and back.  These are the kinds of things that make a big difference.",5
2756,"\""Hey, darling, you talkin' to your boyfriend?\""  the deli counter man recently teased me as I waited in line talking on my cell phone.  Oh the deli men - they're hilarious.  I'd even say, their worth the trip out to the store, but you might want to know more about the food, glorious food. \n\nI shop at the Macaroni Company weekly.  They're great.  From the deli men who hand you samples of meats and cheeses while you wait, to the great selection of bulk foods, to fine selection of meats to the Italian cheeses, to the fill-a-bottle- olive oil station to the fresh pasta to the bulk spices section to the moon and the sun and the earth and Jupiter, this place is lovely.  (Or loverly if your Eliza Dolittle).  The place tends to be packed like a tin of touch-a-philic sardines on the weekends, and I think many people are tourists, but that doesn't stop it from being great. And, that was a long sentence, but not as long as those of some really antiquated authors I've read.\n\nIn any case, the Macaroni Company is a little slice of Italy mixed with Pittsburgherness and fun.",5
2757,"I love your wonderful cheese, Penn Mac!  You have an amazing variety, all my favorites.",4
2758,"I will never buy any type of Italian sausage at Giant Eagle again because now i know what real sausage tastes like.  And, the deli counter guy at Giant Eagle doesn't inappropriately and amusingly call me \""babe\"" every five seconds like the ones at Penn Mac do.   Ordering \""hot italian sausage\"" from a deli guy that calls you \""babe\"" is as amusing as Sunday morning can get.   :-)    \nI'll keep coming here for fresh meats and cheeses as long as I live in Pittsburgh.",5
2759,"This place was noted as a \""must visit\"" location during my last trip to Pittsburgh. I must say, it was definitely worth the visit. \n\nTo all reading this, be aware that essentially, this is just a grocery store we're talking about here. However, the rustic building, and kitchy offerings (like pour your own olive oil...or taste our 100cheeses) makes it kind of special. \n\nWhen I was given this recommendation, I was told \""head to the back to where the cheese is\"". So, I did. WHOA - so much more cheese than I ever expected. But no macaroni and cheese....boo. \n\nThey should really consider serving mac and cheese. \n\nThat's all.",4
2760,"Simply amazing! \n\nThey have everything! I especially love the cheese selection and bulk olives. The Penn Mac sauces are delectable and a quick fix on those lazy days when you don't feel like making your own, I just wish they made alfredo. I would much rather spend my money here than all of the Giant Eagle's that monopolize my city.",5
2761,"First impression upon entering the store (2/5) : \""What the heck is that smell?!\"" After walking into the store a little further, I found my answer. CHEESE! The store was a little on the \""sloppy/pack rat/ sweaty/ definitely wouldn't hurt to mop every once in a while\"" side. My first instinct wasn't to leave so that is always a good thing. \n\nCustomer service (5/5): I went there because my husband randomly missed Spain so he wanted to make a bunch of mini bocadillos with different types of meat and cheeses. We already got the meat from another place down the street so what better place to get a variety of cheeses than the Macaroni co? The lady that helped us was wonderful!! She was so patient with us even though there were a million people waiting in line.  She automatically knew which cheese to recommend based on what would compliment the meat that we had. She was extremely knowledgeable about the various kinds of cheese. I could seriously listen to her talk all day about the history of the cheese... she made it so interesting.  My husband is VERY indecisive so he couldn't figure out which one he liked more. \n\nFood (4/5): We tried at least 7 different kinds of cheese and I didn't like any of them... definitely not a cheese person. My husband on the other hand, LOVED every single one of them! We also went there for some Rustic Italian or any hard shelled bread. I know this is not the store's fault be there needs to be a sign that says, \""Do NOT touch the actual bread unless you are buying it!!!\"" I saw at least 3 people who were squeezing the bread with their dirty hands to see if it was soft. Totally grossed me out. Why would anyone think that is okay?!?! I can understand if you are squeezing the bread through the bag but don't TOUCH it! That is only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. Oh and the fact that it wasn't that clean.",4
2762,"I hit the Strip District about one weekend a month, and Penn Mac is always a \""must stop\"". They have a fantastic cheese, olive, and cured meat selection, its basically a  one stop anitpasto plate. Penn Mac also has those hard to find Italian ingredients, fresh pastas, and great fresh bread. Their produce selection leaves a little to be desired, but the great thing about the strip is great produce is only a few doors away. This place does get PACKED on the weekends so I hope you can tolerate crowds.",4
2763,"Penn Mac is a fun shopping experience. I used to do a lot of my weekly shopping here, but now that I live in the North Hills I've got that can't-cross-the-river syndrome and I only get there every other week or so. It's miles above a Market District, though, in terms of entertainment value and pricing.\n\nThe cheese counter is pretty good. It's not the most amazing selection ever, but it's great for Pittsburgh. For example, they don't carry a variety of aged cheddars or Stiltons, opting instead to offer one or two basic and many flavored versions (with apples, with onions, etc.) They do let you sample, which I recommend; like another reviewer, I've gotten over-old blue cheese here once or twice. They've always enforced the half-pound minimum for me. The fresh mozzarella is great, and I can't resist it when tomatoes are in season. I hate to even mention it, but one time I got home and found... well, a hair in my mozzarella. It put me off for a few weeks but seems to have been a one-time incident (and no, I never brought it up to them).\n\nThe deli has fantastic prices and does proper thin slices, nicely laid out on paper sheets so it doesn't stick together. Daniele prosciutto is amazing, and the domestic is pretty good at a great price. Iberico and Serrano jamon? Yes please.\n\nService at both the cheese and deli counters can take a pretty long time if you go on a weekend. However, I've been able to walk right up on weekday afternoons, and the weekend logjam is kind of fun once in a while.\n\nIn the same room they have the amazing olive bar. I pretty much only buy olives in the Strip. I know the Iggle has an olive bar, but everything I've ever bought from one tastes off in a way I can't put my finger on. Castleventrano olives (a bright, clear light green) are amazing: buttery and briny and fruity with a firm texture. Cerignola are good, and the various stuffed olives on offer are nice if you don't feel like dealing with pits.\n\nI haven't really bought many of their bulk goods aside from Jordan almonds, to which I am shamelessly addicted. They have a variety of pretty colors, as well as the \""seconds\"" which aren't as shiny but taste great anyway.\n\nI love the selection of anchovies, tuna and tomato products in the dry goods area. They also have a good variety of hot sauces, though I can't say I've ever seen Pickapeppa there. Full range (I think) of Dave's Insanity, and lots of other brands as well. Important: They do sell Blennd concentrate, which you can also pick up at the Iggle. I have fond childhood memories of drinking Blennd at the KMart cafeteria growing up. I introduced my Michigan-born husband to it and he never visits Pittsburgh without getting Blennd at least once. (You can also get it premixed and cold at Wholey's, FYI.)\n\nIn the next room you'll find baccala (yum), pour-your-own olive oils at a reasonable price (not a huge selection, but the Spanish is fruity and a good everyday sort of thing at $4.99/12oz). I pretty much never buy bread here, opting to hit up the double rustic baguettes at Mancini's instead. The anise love knot cookies are great.\n\nThe last room has produce, normally at a good price but not the best selection. They do have fresh figs in season, thank God. I have to admit I've never tried the fresh pasta, since that's one of those things I just make at home. I should probably remedy that so I can offer an opinion on it. They sometimes have refrigerated and ready-to-go San Pelligrino Chinotto, a bitter soda that comes in a pretty bottle you can use as a small vase afterwards.\n\nCheckout is straightforward and efficient, but you will be in line for a while if you go on a weekend. It's nuts, just like everywhere else in the Strip. If you can, visit all the shops both on a weekday and on a weekend to enjoy two totally different experiences.\n\nThey do have a small parking area behind the store on Liberty, with which I wish you good luck on a Saturday. Otherwise it's street parking, but there's a ton of that, and walking past and through the other shops in the Strip is so much fun it shouldn't matter anyway.",4
2764,"The restrooms looked like after an bombardment, an improvised shack amid buckets of olives and spices. Highly questionable hygiene for a food store!Disgusting. I will not go back until they clean up the place. It's just filthy!!!",1
2765,"My family and I have strong ties to Pittsburgh despite living in the Akron, Ohio area. Several times a year, however, we always make a point of visiting Pittsburgh, especially right before Christmas. Nothing spells Christmas quite like the Strip, and in particular, PennMac. The thought of the cheese/olive room is enough to bring a tear to my eye. I stocked up on jarred sauces, which are reasonably priced, generously portioned, and most importantly--fresh and delicious. We stacked loaves of bread in the car as well. Seeing all the salted fish (for the upcoming feast of 7 fishes) was beautiful. The most memorable part of the visit, however, was in a small, rather grimy room that boasted huge canisters of home-made wine and small glasses. Initially under the impression that I was intruding upon the staff holiday party, a smiling worker told me that customers were welcome to sample the wine. I was a little wary of trying the un-labeled wine, but it was wonderful and warming. While not available for sale, the wine tasting was a delightful way to warm up from the particularly vicious cold and mingle with other customers. Armed with an arsenal of goods to take back to Ohio, we returned home, satisfied and entirely in the Christmas spirit.",5
2766,"One star off for the veggie section.  Stopped here during a recent trip to Pittsburgh: wound up buying a reusable tote to bring goodies home to Boston.  \n\nThe cheese shop? To. Die. For.  We need one of these in Boston. So much yumminess in such a little space!!!\n\nGreat range of olive oil, nuts (bulk), did i mention the plethora of cheese available?\n\nThey ship...I'm thrilled.  This place saved me a trip to italy.",4
2767,"How can you not love Penn Mac? There are so many good things about this lovely little gem of a place. If you're a foodie, you simply must check it out. The variety of delectable spices, cheeses, deli meats, bread, grains and pasta boggle my mind. I tried a habanero soft cheese this weekend that I couldn't help but buy. My eyes were tearing up from the potency of the habanero while my taste buds were throwing a mini dance party. It was creamy pungent cheesy perfection. This is also a great place to pick up 'from scratch' Italian meal essentials. I could really go on about this place. Take a chance and visit one weekend, you won't regret it!",4
2768,"A required stop on every visit to the Strip. Best selection of Pasta, cheeses and meats. Try the Antipasto salad at the Olive bar. It's the best!",5
2769,"LOVE this place!!  They have everything authentic Italian you could want without being in Italy!  Got some Gouda, sopressata and olives. Always love visiting here when in town!",5
2770,"This is about as real and authentic as Italian food shopping gets.  In a very rare instance (rare for me at least), I can truthfully say that this is indeed your Grandfather's Italian market!  Thus, it isn't pretty like you would see at one of those \""yuppified\"" gourmet markets (won't name and names) but I have been coming here since early childhood and it has scarcely changed.  In fact the same boxes of aromatic salt cod remain at the entrance welcoming customers for well over 30 years!  I am always fearful that places like these are in danger of going away mainly due to corporations coming in and driving them out.  However, Pennsylvania Macaroni Co is a true institution and its name (backed up by the absolutely outstanding quality) is what keeps it going strong!  Pittsburgh is an amazing town and seriously for many people, this is a true Pittsburgh landmark!",5
2771,"Just one of the best for cheese and olive oil!  Spices, too. Love the cheese counter.  Can get busy but usually a cheese to sample while you wait.  \n\nCheck it out and check out the other reviews for more info!",4
2772,I just love to visit this store. As you enter the store you can feel the Italian vibe. We purchased the best olive I have ever had. I discovered fresh mozzarella yum! I just made the homemade pasta for dinner. The black pepper linguine was so good. I need to go back for more real soon. It is a great place to find wonderful gifts for all occasions.,5
2773,"A must-see in Pittsburgh. As a West Coast dude, I don't get to see many places like this. Just fantastic.\n\nTheir shipping operation is also exceptional.",5
2774,"This is Italian heaven.  It has everything the Italian Pittsburgher could want.  I've since moved away from Pittsburgh but recently was sent some Penn Mac merchandise and it was a dream!  They package everything so well and ship it quickly!  I couldn't have asked for a better and tastier gift.  The store is perfection, but you already know that from other reviewers :)",5
2775,"Have been going to the Pennsylvania Macaroni Company for years. Love their fresh pasta and great selection of cheeses. Always great service, however today was the exception. Rudest woman at the cheese counter. Then went to get the fresh pasta and the woman behind the counter was downright nasty. She was covering the pasta at 4:00, they close at 4:30 and I asked her if it was to late to get pasta. She rolled her eyes at me and said uh yeah-we are putting it away right now. A simple yes or no would have been nice. I said ok thanks anyway. Then she must have reconsidered and said well did you want something??? In a very rude voice. Needless to say I walked away. Wow! Pennsylvania Macaroni Company needs to work on customer service. Obviously she hates her job, then get another one! If I didn't drive so far to get there I wouldn't have written this review. Every January I buy 3 months worth of cheese for my family members. I won't be doing that anymore.",1
2776,"Unlike many historic theaters across the country, the Harris Theater has been lovingly restored, and is actually a great place to watch a movie.  In a past life, it showed porno movies.  Now it screens eclectic art-house films and other smart selections programmed by PGH Filmmakers.\n\nLocated on Liberty Street downtown, the theater is easily accessible via public transportation.  The concessions are cheap, and the seats are comfy.  What more could you ask for?",5
2777,"I like little indie theaters like this.  (WARNING: If you want big comfy seats, digital projection, surround sound, and a bucket o' soda, head elsewhere!)  It's small, shows art/foreign/indie films, and you can get a ginger ale for $1.50.  My ticket was only $4 since I'm a grad student...you can't beat that, and there are some amazing movies that show here!  My husband complained the whole time that the seats were uncomfortable, but I was fine.\n\nI am glad that we have the Harris downtown, and I will most likely return.",4
2778,"Our in-laws suggested Dr. Battle and company when our dog, Levi, suddenly got ill.  The staff was very kind and caring even when the diagnosis was not positive.  They gave us as much time as we needed to stay with Levi and were sympathetic.",5
2779,"Ok yes I almost never give a business 5 stars. But this one deserves it. My pup has been going to this hospital ever since I got him, at 3 months old. He's now 9 yrs old. I refuse, even though I travel so much, for any other vet to give him his vaccinations or wellness checkups. I will make a special trip back to Pittsburgh for my pup.\nSo anyway,  yesterday we had a slight emergency. I saw my pup limping and his paw looked like it was in pain. I immediately went to Penn Animal Hospital.  We maybe waited 10 minutes and were seen. The dr...look I know this might not mean much to most folks...but he wasn't afraid. My dog is huge...but he's a teddy bear. He loves people wayyy more than other animals. So instead of acting like 9, he acts like he's 2. Super happy all the time. The dr. was patient and listened to all my concerns. Overall a very good experience. \nI have to disagree with one of the yelpers. While they do not have electronic records (still paper and pen) they do annotate everything.  I do keep my own records as well...but there was a time that I needed to board my dog and I couldn't find my paperwork. I called Penn Animal and they faxed the documentation to me at work. So yes they do have a fax machine. I do worry about if there is a fire or flood...the records would be lost. But will this stop me from going here? Absolutely not.",5
2780,"I absolutely love this place! They have some of the greatest gyros I have ever had. However, that is not the only thing they have that is good. All of their salads and sandwiches are outstanding! I would recommend this place to anyone. Also, the employees are extremely nice and work hard to make sure everyone is served as quickly as possible.",5
2781,"I always enjoy coming here for lunch.\n\nI love that Zorba's has specials everyday- I usually come on Thursdays for the Gyro Special. The gyro is good and they are very, very generous on the yummy fresh cut fries. \n\nI've also had the buffalo chicken salad and it's piled high. The handbreaded fish is huuuuge.(way larger than the roll that it's on) and handbreaded.. so winner winner, fish dinner (or lunch!)\n\nIf I were rating Zorba's homemade ranch, it'd be an easy 5 stars. sometimes I pack my lunch (a quick sandwhich and some crackers) then head over to Zorba's just for some fries and ranch, hahaha!",4
2782,"So we were walking down Penn, showing some family from out of town all the cool shops and eateries on the strip, and we're parched. We step inside Prestogeorge's and are immediately assaulted with wonderful aromas. What could that be? We come to find out that this awesome place not only carries an entire wall of freshly dried leaf teas (more selections than I knew existed) but roasts their own coffee beans. I wanted a hot coffee, but considering the temperature, I went with a frozen caramel creme coffee. The barista was awesome, she answered all of our questions about which ones she liked the best and why. She seemed excited to be of help, which in this town I've found to be a rarity. The rest of my party got smoothies, which were all very good, but the best were the orange creme and the butter rum smoothie. I will definitely be returning there to try more flavors and maybe be adventurous and buy some tea!",5
2783,"Kicks. Butt.\n\nPrestogeorge is a family run roastery on the Strip District that pumps out some interesting and fun flavors.  They have an incredibly wide selection of flavors to please anyone.  Their tea selection is QUITE impressive! \n\nWhile they dont have as many fair trade options as I hoped for, the food and service is exceptional.  Yet another great place to chill and hang out on the Strip.",4
2784,"I've had coffee and tea in the north and south, and on the east and west coasts, and Prestogeorge is among the best in the country.\n\n(Side note: The make some pretty damn good sammiches too!)\n\nNot only is the selection of coffee and loose leaf teas to be marveled at, but the staff is friendly and knowledgeable. Coffee is available in just about any grind. Prices of both coffees and teas are extremely reasonable. Although the line can be long, it is not because of a lack of service - only a large volume of faithful clients. 10 times out of 10, I would go out of my way for Prestogeorge coffees and teas. For nearly 10 years, and in three different states, I continued to order from Prestogeorge online.\n\nStop going to Starbucks. Quit buying crappy coffee at the grocery store.\n\nGo to Prestogeorge!",5
2785,"Rows and rows and rows of coffee. It's pretty overwhelming for a non-coffee drinker. But if there's a wonderful staff, they will lead you in the right direction. In comes a coffee dude that was very knowledgeable and lead me to what sounded like a pretty tasty blend!\n\nI was in shopping for a friend who loves pumpkin coffee, so I made a beeline for the coffee dude and said \""must. have. pumpkin.\"" Thankfully he knew what I was saying and said he had this special \""harvest blend\"" he mixes himself of cinnamon, hazelnut and pumpkin. Sounded and smelled delicious, so I trusted him. \n\nI sauntered over to the tea wall and saw the many blends of loose leaf tea they have as well. That's my biznas right there! I noticed a Christmas blend that sounded amazing, but sadly they were sold out. Of course, a couple weeks before xmas that would happen! So I stocked up on some Vanilla Creme Stash tea and vowed to come back and take some time to dive into their tea selection. \n\nFor those Strip District wanderers, they have a full coffee bar as well that I'd trust is as awesome as their collection of beans and leaves. Tons of supplies for all your sipping needs are packed into this store as well. If you're a coffee or tea lover, this will be your jam. As the terminator would say, I'll be back!",4
2786,"We rotate our coffee purchases between here and La Prima.  It's a tad overwhelming if you don't know what you're looking for, but the staff is ready and willing to help direct you to a coffee bean that is perfect for your taste.  We've tried many different varieties of the dark blends, and all are delicious.  I highly recommend giving this place a try!",4
2787,"This is, by far, one of my favorite places in the Strip District! My favorite tea is the China Rose tea, which not only has a beautiful look to it, but has a wonderful taste! The Apple Caramel Almond is also very good, complete with halved almonds! The milk oolong tea is a little more pricey, but tastes almost like buttery popcorn! It is so unique and exquisite. There are so many coffees and teas to choose from that you could get lost all day just smelling the coffees and choosing which ones you want to take home! You can buy tea pots and infusers here to accompany your new loose leaf teas if you need something new or want to try different ways to drink tea. The prices are absolutely phenomenal. Depending on the tea, for about 2 oz of loose leaf teas or coffee, you are looking at a minimum of $1 and some change! The space is small, so it can be overwhelming when it's busy, but once the crowd dies down, you can really take your time and enjoy the coffees and teas without feeling rushed. Definitely check out this place, you won't be disappointed!",5
2788,"Their coffee and tea are the best in the burgh! I love watching the coffee roasting in the back. Also, I usually do not enjoy flavored coffee, but I have loved many varieties that I have bought here. Definitely worth a visit while in the Strip District!",5
2789,"I liked the decor of the place.  When I lived in Pittsburgh 3 years ago, I was just out of college with no money and didn't care what I ate.  So I spent a lot of time eating bar food, pizza, and $1 pierogies.  I never knew there were \""fancy\"" restaurants until I returned this week for work!\n\nI got the salad with pears & gouda which was delicious with a ton of cheese.  I also had the octopus appetizer as a meal - I was surprised, it's much chewier than I expected.  But the vinaigrette on it was tasty and the red potatoes and kalamata olives gave it a lot of flavor.  The fruity sorbet was good as well.  \n\nI though the service was great and the waiters didn't laugh at me for not knowing half the words on the menu.  They were more than willing to explain!",4
2790,"I go to Lidia's once a year when I am in town for Thanksgiving. I like the ambiance and the decor, although this year our corner table had chairs that sunk WAY down - we wanted to ask for telephone books. I usually choose one of the special salads and have the gnocchi with duck ragu; it is superb! So much flavor and the gnocchi are perfect. This year, though, there was a special fall prix fixe menu with Winter Squash. The ravioli with balsamic drizzle were delicious. I choose quail with apples and squash for my main course and was very satisfied. Terrific glaze! The dessert, however, was over the top! Creme fraiche and pumpkin ice creams, caramel sauce, AND pumpkin fritters. We enjoyed a couple of the $28 bottles. No, they aren't stellar, but for the price they are all good food wines. Everyone in our party enjoyed the meals and we will definitely return.",4
2791,I've been here twice and both times did the prix fixe pasta tasting. The selections change frequently but it was always delicious and extremely satisfying.,4
2792,My husband and I had the pleasure of dining at Lidia's on Thanksgiving day.  The food was good.  No Butterball turkey here!  Staff is friendly and we were seated right away.  The waiter timed it perfectly on each course.  We weren't rushed or did we have to sit awhile between each course.  Great wine flight!  The ambiance is lovely and the tables weren't close together.,4
2793,"came here for the weekend brunch. really good, but i wasn't too impressed w/ my entree (the pasta trio - the broccoli one was kind of watery, tasted like it was seasoned only w/ salt, and then i didnt like the ravioli at all, the cheese was too smelly for me and then the linguini was alrite but also kind of watery)\n\ni REALLY liked the butter that came w/ the bread - 3 kinds, crunchy sugar or something, apricot and strawberry; the appetizer table was really good too - caesar salad yummy, cured meats, soup was bleh, but it was a good variety and all you can eat\n\nthe desserts also were really good. had cookies, tangerine panna cotta, tiramisu (which everyone kept snatching up so if you see it, just grab it even if youre not ready for dessert), this brownie thing was REALLY good also. the almond cake wasn't as moist as i would have hoped... \n\nmy bf got the gnocchi w/ duck and that was really good. a LOT in terms of portion size\n\n$24 1 entree and all you can eat appetizer and dessert. pretty good deal! but not your every-weekend brunch place",5
2794,"Arriving at the midpoint of the lunch hour we were surprised to find the restaurant less than 1/4 full.  With the bar empty and only one section being seated be claimed our reservation and were led quickly to a table near the large glass windows - an excellent view of the river would be our companion throughout the meal.  Meeting our waiter, a friendly man named Chendo we were given menus and a brief explanation of the daily special pastas for the Pasta Trio.  With the restaurant quite slow that day I will note we were very well taken care of throughout out meal - the service staff was excellent.\n\nBrowsing the high ceilinged room, randomly placed bottles and objects, and abundant brightly colored glass panels plus Chihuily influenced chandeliers I have to say Lidia's is a very handsome restaurant - it has that \""wow\"" factor of many New York City dining rooms.  While the white paper over white tablecloth aspect of the table setting struck me as odd, everything else felt \""fine dining\"" without seeming forced.\n\nSitting and waiting for our meals to arrive we were first delivered one of the better bread baskets I've had in recent memory - Sea Salt Foccacia, Rustic Italian, and Cracked Wheat Sourdough served with two spreads, a Chick Pea Pesto and pureed White Beans with Black Olive, both resting in a pool of slightly sweet extra virgin olive oil.  Served warm the breads were tantalizing and given the size of the portions soon to be arriving it was definitely a chore not to overindulge (a chore I failed, miserably.)\n\nFor our main courses my mother opted for a salad and a contorti while Erika and I chose pastas.  For myselfthe choice was quite simple - my favorite pasta and my favorite protein on the same plate, Gnocchi with Duck Guazetto.  An Italian Stew not unlike Chicken Cacciatore, but featuring duck in white wine instead of Chicken in Red the thick reduction was hearty, meaty, smoky, and laden with vegetables.  Paired with a toothsome yet non-doughy potato gnocchi the dish was not only enormous, but incredibly filling.  While I will admit I ate a lot of bread and helped my mother and sister  with their plates I can say that this was one dish I couldn't finish, it was just too large.\n\nFor Mother's selection she opted for the Roasted Beet and Apple Salad with Frisee and Fresh Goat Cheese plus the Pan Seared Golden Polenta Fritters.  A competent salad with sweet apples balancing earthy beets and pungent goat cheese the dish was brought together by a splash of balsamic and olive oil, ample in size and flavor, very nicely done.  Not fairing quite as well as the Salad were the Fritters - nicely prepared and crispy on the outside with creamy polenta within, they simply lacked flavor.\n\nErika's selection would be the signature Pasta Trio - three pastas plated tableside with unlimited refills.  Admittedly the concept sounds somewhat \""Olive Garden\"" but that is before you realize two of the pastas are made in house and one is imported direct from Italy...and all the sauces are made daily in the kitchen, as well.  Served up onto a single large platter the daily selections  would be hand torn Tagliatelle and Pork Ragu, Imported Orchiette with Fennel Sausage and Thyme, and house folded Sweet Pea and Corn Ravioli with Cream Sauce.  Enormous in portion I cannot really fathom anyone requiring seconds of the trio and at a mere $14 the selections were excellent.  Smoky and Sweet the Pork Ragu complimented the al dente Tagliatelle nicely while the aromatic sausage was an equally balanced flavor for the Orchiette.  The most impressive of the group, the sweet pea and corn ravioli, was sweetened only by the vegetal components while the cream itself had notes of cinnamon and nutmeg.\n\nArriving simultaneously and thankfully smaller than the entrees was Torta di Mandorle e Mirtilli - Blueberry and almond cake, blueberry-lavender ice cream, almond crunch, blueberries. .  If a little is good a lot is better seemed to be the theme of this dessert and it worked nicely - the fresh blueberries lacing the buttery pound cake, the flowery accent to the blueberry ice cream, and the crunchy sugared almonds paired with even more blueberries - excellent.\n\nThe second dessert, larger in size but lighter in texture, would be Panna Cotta alla Fragola - Strawberry and ricotta panna cottas, lemon-strawberry sandwich cookies, fresh strawberries.  Served in a 12oz glass better suited for a milkshake the panna cotta was surprisingly springy and well blended with a more gelatin strawberry base topped by an ample creamy layer of whipped cream and ricotta.  Unnecessary but welcomed the lemony cookies were much akin to a shortbread in texture and Madeline in flavor.\n\nHaving heard \""upscale Olive Garden\"" comparisons I personally find that assessment far from accurate and would actually go so far as to say that aside from the lack of seasoning the the experience was on par with many fine dining Italian establishments in other cities.",4
2795,"Just about my fave restaurant in the burgh.\n\nYou can't go wrong at Lidia's, whether you go for Sunday brunch or a nice evening out. It's Italian food worth going out for, friendly staff, and a beautiful space in the strip.",5
2796,"Get the pasta trio, you won't regret it.  Big heaping portions of fresh pasta delivered to your plate as soon as you have space available. Mmm.  And we went on a Saturday night with no reservations and we're seated in 5 minutes.",4
2797,"Fine Italian dining at a reasonable price and by reasonable, I mean, it's less expensive than a Michelin  starred French restaurant. The atmosphere is pretty fancy...high ceilings, white table clothes, snooty looking hosts and waiters, however, looks are deceiving. This is a family-style restaurant, disguised as a fine dining. \n\nWe went here with 6 adults and 2 young children...arriving a little too early for dinner, they let us wait inside. I was hoping they'd give us some free appetizers, but no such luck =(. They seated us right at 5p and seats started filling up fast, so it was probably a good idea we got there early. We ordered 5 of the pasta trios and I ordered the Zuppe di Pesce (seafood stew). The pasta was good...I wouldn't say it was amazing, but definitely worth the price...$20 for just the pasta, but yo u can add a ceasar salad and desert for I think $7. For people that don't know, everyday, there are 3 different pasta dishes the chef makes for this pasta trio. They have servers for each of the individual pastas (pretty neat IMO). They give you a sampling of the 3 at first, which, quite honestly was plenty. Then you can pick one, two or even all three for the subsequent rounds. I don't know if it's all you can eat, but even the big eaters were done after their 3rd plate. There is a child's menu, but our kids eat like birds, so we asked if they could have a little of the pasta. The servers were very accomodating...bringing everyone plates to share. My wife ordered the pasta trio with a salad and desert. The ceasar was perfect (she shared it with me) and she had tiramisu that was probably the best we've ever had. The Zuppe di pesce (my entree) was AMAZING...I'm a seafood lover though. Overall, I'd say this is an upgraded version of Olive Garden...which is NOT a bad thing.",4
2798,"I want the pasta trio in ma' belly now! It's hands down the best dish you can get there. Three deeeeliscious pasta's served to you in a never ending skillet! What other wimpy pasta's can compete with that? The OG (short for Olive Garden) doesn't hold a spaghetti noodle to this place! \n\nI swear you to you I haven't seen the same noodle twice here. They always seem to serve up a dish with some crazy looking pasta that they say the name of and I can never remember. But obviously the best thing about it is the sauce! Oh, the sauce! Meat sauce, sweet sauce, lemon, butter, the list goes on and on. I'll never forget the first time I fell in the love there. I fell in love with this out of this world pumpkin ravioli. I'll never forgot you pumpkin ravioli, NEVER! (This was all said looking wistfully out the window like in a movie montage). \n\nBut don't fear if you need something other than pasta (I don't know why, but let's roll with it). I attended a party there once and we had a a three course meal. First we had a delish caesar salad, which was on the lemony side, just the way I like it! Then we had a choice between meats and a fish and I tried the fillet. It was...to. Die. For! I was very pleasantly surprised that my non-pasta meal was so utterly satisfying. Then came the light and fluffy tiramisu. Now I was officially in heaven! We were also sent home with a goodie bag that included Lidia's Eggplant Pasta Sauce. I tried it a couple days later and it was great! It's a red sweet sauce with a tiny kick to it. I loved that it had eggplant in it because it was something different than your normal meatie balls and sauce combination. \n\nAnd lastly, the ambiance is very unique. There's huge windows in the front to gaze out at well, a parking lot. But they're tinted so you have a nice intimate vibe going on. There's also a huge glass Chihuly chandelier hanging in the middle of the restaurant that's gorge! So please, convert over from the OG, you will not be disappointed. And don't worry, they DO give free bread sticks!",5
2799,"Being a huge Bastianich fan, I was stoked to finally dine at Lidia's Pittsburgh.  Entering the restaurant, you automatically feel impressed.  It's spacious yet feels warm, inviting, and comfortable.  There are beautiful touches and accents everywhere and the designer was not afraid to use color, tastefully.  I was ready to feast!\n\nI ordered the polipo (grilled octopus) which was tender and flavorful thanks to the zesty vinaigrette.  My osso bucco (braised pork shank) on a bed of barley risotto was easily the tastiest thing I ate that night being succulent, flavorful and utterly tender.  That's not to demean my companion's hearty and tasty mushroom soup or his grilled salmon which was prepared quite nicely.   I ordered the budino di nutella (nutella pudding) for dessert.  It looked better on the menu unfortunately.  It was bit too heavy and rich.  Did I really say that?  Lesson learned...perhaps.  Probably not.\n\nService is top notch.  We never waited and our food came out promptly.  Prices are extremely reasonable given the quality and copious portions they serve.  In fact, I think I went up a full pant size upon leaving.  Lidia's is a definite keeper.",4
2800,Get the daily pasta special.. Can't beat it. Skip salad and dessert-won't have room,4
2801,"Very good.  Great atmosphere for a date or special occasion.  The Pasta trio is always great.  On Sunday they offer family style for $25(Salad, Entree, Dessert).  \n\nGrilled Octopus, Lasagna, salads are very good.  Will be going back soon.",4
2802,"Ok, I'm giving this 4 stars because for what you got, I think it was a pretty good price.  Selection of breads and dips to go with it, salad was (too) huge.  Husband got the seafood soup/stew and he liked it a lot, I got the pasta sampler (all you can eat of a variety of daily pastas).  All were good, nothing that knocked my socks off though.  Appetizers were pretty big too.\n\nOverall, nice place for something a little different than your average italian at a fair price.  Place was nice, good location, walked here from our hotel.  Good, though for us, overwhelming wine selection.",4
2803,"We were at Lidia's for an early dinner before seeing a show.  They have a great wine list and our server made some excellent suggestions.  The food was wonderful.  Several of us had the Pasta Trio.  This is a sampler dish with three different pastas prepared and served at your table.  Afterwards, you can get additional servings of your favorite from the Trio.  Of course, none of us even had room for an additional serving.  If you get the Trio, I'd recommend getting the option that includes the salad and dessert.  It's a great deal and you know you'll want it anyway!",4
2804,Yummy! The braised duck gnocchi were out of this world! Our waitress was as nice as they get. Great experience!,4
2805,"More like 3.5 after being at Salt of the Earth.  But Still - Lidia's is one of the few restaurants on mine and Jordan's list, where one of us has been employed, but we will still willingly eat at.  Lidia's is our choice when we want great Italian foods that taste as close to our family making it as possible.\nThe other night we went for drinks and apps at the bar.  This is always fun for us because the Fritto Misto is fried veggies and calamari in a light batter, with their sauce for dipping.  And Lidia is the queen of sauce recipes!  We also had the appetizer version of the pasta-tasting platter because there is no way to walk into that building and NOT get the pasta-tasting trio in some form or another.  It's just AMAZING!\nOur favorite time to go is for Saturday or Sunday Brunch.  I don't know why - but I think Lidia's Brunch is Pittsburgh's best kept brunch secret.  For $24.99 per person, you get a complimentary Bloody Mary or Mimosa to start, then you are brought your basket of scones, donuts, and breads accompanied by sweet butters.  Then you go up to the Anti-Pasta tables for veggies, egg frittatas, meats, salads, soups - its the ANTI-PASTA table!  Use your imagination (they use theirs!).  Then you order your Brunch Entree - whether that's the Pasta-Tasting trio or Filet & Eggs or Salmon.  After your Entree - you get to go up to their dessert table that always has tiramisu, Italian cookies, mousse, etc.  People give me their brunch suggestions all the time and NO ONE has beaten Lidia's.  Saturdays AND Sundays from 11a-2p.  Just prepare yourself for the food coma after!",4
2806,"I've been to Lidia's a few times before and figured I'd leave a review after today's trip.  We arrived a bit early for our reservation and they were able to seat us right away.  Even with a fairly packed dining room, the place wasn't too loud.  If you have any old people in your group, they can seat you downstairs as I don't think they have an elevator (I prefer being upstairs overlooking looking the dining room, it's a nice touch).  The Lobster Arancini were cooked perfectly with no crunchy, undercooked risotto inside.  The only downside was that there were just 3 (we had 4 people) and they were tiny so it was almost impossible to split them.  As for entrees, the gnocchi topped with a duck ragu are a fantastic dish, not too rich and the gnocchi simply melt in your mouth.  The Zuppa di Pesce has a wonderfully balanced broth which wasn't oversalted (a surprise given the amount of shellfish) and tasted like it might have had Sherry wine in it.  I think I counted 7 or 8 different items in this seafood hodgepodge.  As for service, it was quite good and we were done with 3 courses in a bit over an hour.  Lidia's certainly ranks up there as one of my favorite Italian restaurants in the city.",4
2807,"as a big fan of Lidia's, i was anxious to eat at her restaurant, and it was totally awesome. would highly recommend.  Food was excellent. wait staff was attentive. we arrived early for our reservation and they were able to seat us.  it was a lot of fun and the decor was awesome too.",5
2808,"I went to Lidia's this past week for dinner with a group of 6 friends. The service was one of the worst I have ever had. The waitress was rude to us from the minute we didn't order alcohol to the second we signed our bills. We politely asked at the time of placing our orders if it would be possible to have separate checks. It's a group of people having dinner together, who carries cash anymore?  Waitstaff should expect to be asked for separate checks. I understand it makes for a bit more work to run a few more cards at the end of the meal, but when the waitress disdainfully states \""I can do that, but you will just have to be patient with me at the end of your meal as separate checks cannot disrupt the service of my other tables.\"" it is a big indication of how the rest of the evening would go. If she gave as much inattention to her other tables as she did to ours, no one would have even noticed she was taking a few extra minutes running separate checks. We rarely saw our waitress except when she needed to sell us food. Thank goodness for the other staff that were available to refill our drinks, our bread and our pasta. Otherwise I think we would still be sitting there 4 days later with empty glasses and stomachs!\n\nSpeaking of empty stomachs-I wish I hadn't filled my stomach and emptied my wallet with the food we were served. I ordered the pasta trio. The salad was good and unfortunately the best part of my meal.  I was excited to try the 3 pastas when they came out. But that excitement quickly disappeared as I took a few bites. Seriously?!  A revered Italian restaurant serving overdone pasta?!  It was the most bland arrabiatta sauce I have ever had. The jarred stuff I have in my cabinet at home has a 100 times more flavor than this and I don't even serve that over such limp noodles as what this place did. The pesto sauce on the gnocchi was good, but again the pasta was well past it's doneness. The best pasta was the gemmeli with the sausage/broccoli rabe sauce, but it was extremely oversalted and left my mouth feeling like it does after I've eaten too much ham on Easter. \n\nI had high hopes that dessert would salvage this meal!  Unfortunately, those hopes were dashed when we ordered the nutella custard that was to come with caramel bananas. The waitress said that they didn't have bananas for it because their shipment they had received that day were too green. The restaurant is in The Strip District!! Go down a few blocks to Stan's Market and buy ripe bananas to serve with your dessert!  She was going to serve a custard with nothing else until my friend suggested that they use strawberries that were listed on another dessert as a substitute.  The dessert was good, but I would have definitely preferred bananas over the strawberries we ended up with. \n\nLidia's had been on my list of restaurants to try ever since it opened years ago. I can now mark it off my list and never return. Between the waitress's attitude towards us all night to the quality of our meals, it was one of the worst restaurant experiences I have ever had. So disappointed!",1
2809,My guests and I had a pleasant meal with good service.,4
2810,"Overall this was good Italian food if you're ready to venture into something more asventerous than Olive Garden.  I had the pasta trio and thought the ravioli was amazing.  Everything else was pretty good, but a butternut squash ravioli made the meal.  Be prepared to spend about $30 a person for the full experience and I'll remember this meal for a while.",4
2811,"Not a place I'd return to for regular fare, overpriced for quality.  But the brunch is a divine value.",4
2812,"We absolutely LOVED this restaurant!  The service was impeccable!  I had the all you can eat pasta trio which was lovely and delicious!  My husband had the cacciatore, which he makes himself at home, and he said it was the best he'd ever had!  We will definitely be back!",5
2813,"As a lover of pasta--I love to eat it, I love to make it, I love to cook with it--this restaurant is heaven. Just outside of downtown Pittsburgh (by Wholey's and The Heinz History Museum), this restaurant has soaring ceilings, a beautiful Chihuly-style glass chandelier, and friendly waitstaff. It's great for a date night, business lunch/dinner, or celebratory dinner (we've celebrated new jobs, birthdays, and anniversaries here over the years). It was started by famous chef Lidia Bastianich and features a wonderful selection of pastas, wines, and desserts. The meal always starts with a bread basket filled with crunchy cheese bread sticks (they taste like gourmet Cheez-Its), herbed foccacia, and Italian bread and the breads are served alongside two different \""butters\"" (olive and pesto, I believe). There are some amazing dishes on the menu (my mom loves their gnocchi with duck ragu and the arugula salad and rarely gets anything else, while my dad and brother are more willing to try different things from the menu, like wild boar ravioli or caprese salad), but the best choice on the menu by far is Lidia's Pasta Tasting Trio. Offered either on its own or paired with a Caesar salad and choice of dessert, this meal consists of endless servings of three different, freshly made pastas. The pastas and their sauces change each day, but you can usually count on at least one butter-based sauce (usually butter and sage or butter and thyme) and one tomato-based sauce. The pastas are always different--last night, they had bucatini, papardelle, and ravioli--and they are always freshly made. The servers bring out steaming saute pans filled with the fresh pasta and you can eat as much pasta as you want (the servers will stop by every so often to offer another serving). This meal is a great way to try new types of pastas and new sauces and, with three types served each time, you're bound to like one. I've had spinach and ricotta ravioli, tagliatelle in a thyme-butter sauce, linguine in a creamy tomato sauce, bucatini in a spicy tomato sauce with caramelized onions and bacon...I've had too many pastas and sauces to count and I've always enjoyed this meal. I highly recommend getting it with the salad and dessert--the Caesar salad is lovely and they usually have some tasty desserts. They always offer delicious ice creams and sorbets (we've had lemon sorbet, olive oil ice cream, chocolate espresso ice cream, and strawberry sorbet, to name a few) and they usually have some sort of decadent chocolate dessert available. \nThe restaurant is definitely dressy, but there's always the one table with the idiots who came dressed in jeans and a tee shirt--please don't be one of those idiots (wear a cute dress or khakis and a polo). They offer valet parking, but there's a large, relatively inexpensive parking lot right across the street. Reservations help, but usually you can get in without one (unless it's a weekend evening). I recommend coming in with an empty stomach, because with all of that pasta, you'll need some room in there.",4
2814,"Had brunch there yesterday.  Phenomenal!  Staff that we encountered were friendly and knowledgeable, super efficient but didn't hover over us.  Kudos for that--a well-trained staff!\n\nEverything we had was delicious, every little salad and nibble bit on the antipasti table.  I had the gnocchi with duck ragu as my main course, and it was perfection; if I can quibble, the portion was actually too large!  But--perfection!  My partner had the chicken livers with polenta, which was also super.\n\nWe sampled a few of the offerings on the dessert table, all of which were lovely.  The roasted half peaches with crumble topping were the best, although I also loved the olive oil/lemon cake topped with sugar coated blueberries.\n\nWe had such a nice experience here, and ordered why we don't go that often.  We will have to get here more often, based on yesterday's peerless experience.",4
2815,"We can here for brunch on Sunday, 5 adults and four month old. I used to be the girl who wouldn't go inside a restaurant if I saw a kid within two blocks of the place but now things have changed. Before I get to my review of the brunch itself I'd like to say how impressed I was with their accommodations for babies! The changing station in the bathroom had wipes, a small sitting area and it was almost private. Fabulous. But the best part was they gave us a cradle-type thing in which our baby slept like the angel he is most certainly not. If he wasn't sleeping in it, he was just laying there playing and we could have brunch with our adult friends without having to entertain or keep an eye on our little love. Thanks Lidia's - you won me over with those two things alone.\n\nThe brunch itself was fantastic. The bread with three sweet, butter spreads was my favorite. My mimosa was actually a mimosa and not just orange juice with a splash of champagne. The buffet was 90%vegetarian and never looked empty because the staff was always bringing out new dishes. For my entree I had the manicotti but also tasted the pasta trio from my friend. Yumm! And the dessert spread? Yeah I was in heaven. \n\nOverall, we had an amazing time and will def be back.",4
2816,Nice place would give atmosphere a 6 1/2 out of 10 and food a seven out of 10.  Often has good specials!,4
2817,"I've been a huge fan of Lidia Bastianich for years, watching her show on PBS and cooking her recipes. My Dad is a huge fan as well. I recently moved back to Pittsburgh (after 30 years) to help out my folks as my Dad's cancer has worsened. I had no idea Lidia had a restaurant here. About a month ago I met a college friend (and foodie) at the strip for drinks and we ended up at Lidia's. Bar is awesome - I highly recommend the white Manhattans. While I was there I found out Lidia would be in town for a special dinner, Nov. 7. Woot! Gonna go and bring my Mom and Dad.\n\nSo happy I could make my reservation online! The restaurant was very professional and called to confirm (beating me to call them) and then accommodated us with a table closer to the door so my Dad, who has a walker, would not have to walk so far.\n\nSaid table was very cozy against the wall, the arrangement was perfect. The greeting and seating staff were excellent and friendly. My Mom and Dad bought her latest cook in anticipation. Upon seating, Lidia was bee bopping around and we said hello and she promised to come back to visit.\n\nThe meal, the MEAL! Yum, holy moly! To start, I had a white Manhattan, of course, and enjoyed the yummy bread-sticks. I also ate some of the homemade bread (one was rosemary I think) with pesto butter and a bean butter. Had to save room! We did not order wine, my Dad can't drink wine due to his medication. The meal was paired with Lidia's own wine, another time I would love to try some. Since I was driving I only had one cocktail. ; p\n\nThe antipasti - squash and ricotta tart was to die for, the mozzarella and celery salad was wonderful. For Primi, my Mom had Lidia's signature Ceasar salad, my Dad had the tomato and ricotta crostini. I had the ricotta and vegetable crostata with arugula salad. I loved mine, the crostata again so excellent, the arugula salad was warm served on a warm plate. Had a bite of my parent's Primi. It's always good to go with others, so you can share and try out more dishes!\n\nThe pasta was Ravioli verde with sage butter - delectable! The ravioli looked more like beautiful speckled green meatballs and melted in your mouth.\n\nFor Secondi, I had Lidia's Pasta trio, my favorite of which was the homemade pappardelle with cabbage and meat sauce. My Dad had the pork shanks braised in apple cider vinegar and barley risotto (my other choice) and my Mom had the lamb chops with red wine sauce and spinach spaetzle. The pork was luscious and the lamb chops were delicious too.\n\nDolci was outstanding as well, my parents had the Grandma Rose's apple cake with candied walnuts (those were awesome - they were coated with a marzipan type coating). I had the Caprese Torte which was chocolate and divine. All served with a dollop of mascarpone ice cream, so good!\n\nLidia came back over and chatted for awhile with my Dad (and my Mom and me) and signed their cookbook. They talked about cooking and where in Italy they are from and the slovak influence of their youth. Her's in far north Italy, his in a coal town in PA with Italian and Slovak neighbors. Magical.\n\nThe service was superb. The only sour notes were the din of the restaurant (everyone was excited!) and the \""bull in the china shop\"" busboy (man). He actually splashed matter into my Dad's eye piling dishes and utensils on his arm busing the table next to us. It was fine, no harm, no foul and he was very nice, as was everyone on staff.\n\nI can't wait to go back!",5
2818,"Lidia's is a good restaurant for Italy food.  Though there is little bit loud, food here are really awesome. \n$6 is needed for valet.",4
2819,"We visited for brunch last Sunday. It was amazing. It is $28 a person and includes a prefix menu. You get a morning cocktail, antipasto buffet, choice of entree (endless fresh made pasta trio is an option) and a dessert buffet. \n\nThe serve was impeccable. The sangria and Bloody Mary were delicious. The pasta trio was incredible. The salads at the buffet were so thoughtful and tasty. Would go again! I want to make this place a tradition. \n\nGreat management! Excellent food!",5
2820,"Stop here on a visit to Pittsburg . Was surprised by how great the food was . Coming at brunch was perfect as the anti pasta bar was filled with olives , salads , salmon , mussels , veggies and meats. I chose the pasta trio . Perfect choice as it was a great way to sample three pastas . My mushroom filled ravioli was the highlight of the plate . Every bite had a perfect mix of mushroom and cheese . Service started out great  however at time to receive bill we lost our waitress for about 10 mins. Not the best ending for such a wonderful tasting brunch .",4
2821,"Went here for an early Valentine's Dinner last night. The service was great. We both ordered the pasta trio and the waiters' were very attentive at filling up our plates as soon as they neared empty. We also got the Polito appetizer to start and it was delicious- mix of octopus, potatoes, capers, onions and olives. Also, their wine bottles for $29 are a great deal. Just took off one star for the decor- a little outdated. Still a great night though- definitely recommend.",4
2822,"Great food and service, very pleased with my Valentine's day dinner here.  Planning to come back to try more of their fare, since their Valentine's day menu was limited.",5
2823,"What an embarrassment. Rotten/black  salad greens. A server with a black eye. Pedestrian \""signature\"" pasta. Plates and glasses left uncleared. Greasy, scratchy plates at buffet. All yours for $28 per person!",1
2824,"Went yesterday after my daughter's college graduation.  When the grad ceremony ran longer than expected, I called the hostess to let her know we had been delayed but were departing and hoped to be there soon.  As we were sitting in traffic, I received a call from a man who identified himself as the general manager and rudely asked if I still intended to be dining there.  After I explained our delay and that I had just spoke with the hostess, he (again very rudely) wanted to know how much longer I thought it would take for me to get to the restaurant.  \n\nWe arrived at Lydia's about 30 minutes late for a mid-afternoon reservation.   There were several large parties but quite a number of open tables.  Upon presenting at the hostess table, neither the hostess or the general manager acknowledged us for several minutes while they continued some discussion between the two of them.  We were seated at a small round table tucked in a corner - very small for a party of five.\n\nOur server arrived and explained the menu, which was the buffet brunch at the time. He spoke so quickly and mumbled so much that we had trouble understanding him.  We ordered our drinks and he indicated he would take our order when he returned with the drinks.  He later returned without our drinks and told us that they needed to break down the buffet to prep for upcoming dinner service so we could not have the antipasto or dessert portions of the brunch. Instead they would charge us ala carte but we would be limited to the entrees on the brunch menu and they could provide a Caesar salad or cup of soup.  He the left and returned later to take our order - still no drinks. \n\nWe eventually received Caesar salad (not fresh, limp and overdressed) and drinks.  We were seated within view of the antipasto buffet and were able to observe that we were on to the service of our entrees well before the antipasto buffet was broken down. Clearly there was no reason that our menu needed to be so restricted.  \n\nFood was ok.  Chicken was salty and overpowered by capers.  Individuals who ordered pasta trio indicated two of three were good.  Unfortunately, the table set up required the server to hold the pasta skillet over my lap in order to serve those seated on the other side of the table.  No mishaps but a few close calls.  Amounts provided in first serving were small and it was nearly impossible to get an additional serving.  Two individuals never did receive the second serving of one of the pastas that they requested.  We were able to order from dessert menu.  Desserts were unremarkable and very small.  \n\nService was horrible.  Our server did not return.  Took great effort to flag him down for additional drinks.  House wine and mimosa were overpriced at $12 and $13 respectively given size and quality.\n\nGentleman bussing our table was the only positive of our experience. He was friendly and accommodating.\n\nI will not return again and would discourage others as well.",1
2825,"Not impressed by this restaurant.  Ordered the pasta trio, which was recommended by the waitress and was labeled on the menu as \""all you can eat\"".  The staff service gave small portions of each and hardly returned for further portions.  If I wanted \""all you can eat\"" I would have been at the restaurant all night waiting to be served.  The pasta was cold when served.  The frozen pasta from my son's school fundraiser was better.  I would not recommend nor would I ever return.",1
2826,"Having basic cable for a few years now, I guess I missed who Lidia is. But her restaurant is sure nice. Wonderful and attentive service, nice atmosphere, and large portions of tasty food. I had the gnocchi, which comes with duck ragu - fantastic! I'm a huge fan of duck, and this was a new approach for me. The duck played really well with the thick ragu sauce. Not the best potato dumplings in a gnocchi, but still quite good. My friends dishes were also great, especially the lasagna which was massive.\n\nA nice comfort Italian joint with some unique twists and lovely service. Strikes me as a good spot that can please many different tastes.",4
2827,Great Restaurant with great food nice wine. The inside ambience is good but there's no nice view of the city.,4
2828,"Oh yum!!!\n\nAfter a VERY stressful week this week Lidia's was a wonderful oasis on a Thursday night. Our server (Robert) was a breath of fresh air in his knowledge and love of food.\n\nHAVE THE BURRATA!  No, I am not kidding. It was so good that it just about brought my coworker to tears. :) All of food was wonderful and it was refreshing that a restaurant would let us sit and enjoy our food. After a wonderful three hours at Lidia's we eventually made our way back to the hotel (with a tiramisu to go).",5
2829,"What a disappointment. When the water glass cracked in my hand as the server poured and soaked us, we should have known it would be that kind of evening. Worst part of the meal was the pasta trio--the limpest, pastiest, most tasteless mass of lukewarm pasta I have ever been served. One waiter saved the day by insisting I reorder, while everyone else in the joint was content to let us stew. Every aspect of the experience was substandard although when I reordered, the beet salad was very good. Overall, Lidia should be ashamed to have her name on a place like that.",1
2830,"Lidia, you should be ashamed! This spot wouldn't have lasted a year in NYC. Citizens of Pittsburgh, don't be fooled. Lidia's is average at best. I ate here when it opened,a and again 4 years later. Nothing has changed. We did have some great bar nibbles, quality cocktails, and a good bottle of wine off of a pretty good list, but the food and service lacked. For starters we were served ice cold meatballs and limp soggy salads. The took away everything and only brought back fresh salads (mind you, we were one of about 10 tables being served that evening!). The entrees were dull and lacked seasoning. The servers were confused (how many times does it take to ask fro fresh pepper?) and our waiter seemed to hand off our table to another server. It's tough to find anything good here. Just another 'poser'.",1
2831,I had really high expectations for this place but the food was overpriced & bland my lasagna tasted like it was made by Stouffers. The service was excellent the food nothing great.,1
2832,"This place is pretty poor and really needs to get it's act together because it's a disgraceful place to watch football, especially given the accessibility of technology these days.  First off, it is desperately in need of some updates.  There are old crappy projector screens and a few big rear projection TVs, but not an HDTV in sight.  There are TVs aplenty, but they just feel dinghy and outdated and the reception on every TV is snowy.\n\nThe biggest issue, however, is that apparently they're only able to show 6 games at any 1 time throughout the huge bar area.  There are several main bar islands, booths, and pub tables all over with individual TV screens at each booth.  Sounds good, but what good are all these seats if you can only show 6 games?  That is absurd when you consider how huge Sports Rock is, especially during college football.  I went to watch a game that was on regular old ESPN, and they weren't showing the game.  You mean I could go to my hotel to watch the game but am unable to watch it at a \""sports bar\""??  Give me a break.\n\nFood is also generally terrible.  Nachos are no better than what you can get at 7-11 and sandwiches have no flavor.  And service is piss poor and understaffed.  I'm not sure if they recently changed ownership or what, but something was very very off here and they were obviously unprepared for the start of the football season.\n\nI feel bad because the people were very nice and apologetic, but that does not take away from the fact that even if they were showing my game, I think I'd still rather watch it in my hotel room.",1
2833,"I think that typically sports bars are really not expected to have good food.  They just need to have four things\n1. ESPN\n2. Nachos pilled high with all kinds of stuff\n3. beer specials\n4. big screen TVs.\n\nWell Sports Rock failed on all accounts.  I was encouraged when we walked in and saw individual TVs on each table.  Of course we picked the one that didn't work!  Then we realized while there were many out of market games, the Virginia Tech one was nowhere to be seen. So we politely ask for ESPN.  Not ESPN U or 360 or anything fancy.  Plain old regular ESPN.  Then we get some story about how they only have six recievers.  Thats fine.  But why am i watching the Maine/Iowa game.  SERIOUSLY.  I was also annoyed that when the cute girl walked up to the bar, he had the Georgia game on within minutes. \n\nThe nachos were absolutely disgusting and my wrap just leaked oil and disgustingness.   The fries were even terrible, but i found if you dipped them in the gross nacho cheese, they weren' that bad.   \n\nPlus, beer was 4.75!  Multiply that by a 3 hour game and you're paying a lot.  Service was awful and i think i would get better reception on a tv with rabbit ears.  Overall this place sucked, although i will give them credit as we were finally getting up to leave and go to an Irish Bar that was able to show ESPN, i noticed the hokie game all the way back in the corner.  Took them long enough.\n\nIf you're ever in Pittsburgh in need of watching ESPN heres my idea.  Grab a permanti brothers sandwich and a six pack of beer and watch it in your hotel room rather than waste your money to sit and watch Maine vs Iowa on a crappy little tv with no reception.",1
2834,I order food for delivery at my hotel. I got the chicken carbonara.  It came with salad and toast it was the BOMB. It was delivered piping hot and it was a lot of food I ordered he individual size and its enough for two people.  I also got slice of strawberry cheesecake.,5
2835,"The other reviews are spot on about the ambiance.  It's very frat house chic, with lots of crappy fourth hand furniture, flickering fluorescent lights and turkish news playing on the the big screen TV (WTF?) \n\nIt is a bitch to find, especially at night, so pack your gps.  Once you find the building, you have to punch in the code ( It was 0002 when I went) for the door to get into the lobby at least at night.  Once you're in the lobby, you have to go to the elevator and hit \""M\""  for mezzanine level.  There was no sign telling us to do that and the elevator wouldn't let us select any other floor without a security badge, so it took us a little while to figure out.  Once we stepped off the elevator, my friend was having serious second thoughts about the place because of the sketchy vibe, but I'm glad we stayed because the food was REALLY REALLY good.  \n\nI got a meat lovers pizza that was absolutely piled with pepperoni, sausage, ham,  and bacon.  It was really tasty.  My friend got the Lamb Shish Kabob which had some sort of magical spices on it.  It was like a circus in your mouth.  It also came with some kind of flat bread with sesame seeds which was really good.  \n\nThe location (second floor, over the river and through the woods)  and the atmosphere absolutely suck, but the food definitely didn't disappoint. I knocked off 1 star for sketchiness, but the place redeemed itself when our order came out.  If this place found a  little nicer location on street level, it would own.",4
2836,"Crazy good sesame bread, they make it fresh everyday. Lamb kebabs were very good,  came with bread, salad, French fries. We also got hummus, very fresh, and a pide. The place is such a complete dive that my husband wanted to turn around and leave,  but it is worth it. If I lived in Pitts, I'd eat that bread all the time.\nThey deliver, too, and are super friendly.",4
2837,Traditional pizza is awesome. Delivery is very fast as well. They always tell me 40 minutes and then arrive in 15-20.,5
2838,"My husband and I just moved here from the NYC area and we've been looking for a good pizza place. After trying a few different sub-par Pittsburgh pizzerias, we decided to try Ephesus last Friday night. We ordered one large spinach and feta pizza and one Italian calzone, via delivery. Even though it was prime-time on a Friday night, our pizza was delivered in 40 minutes and both things we ordered were DELICIOUS. The crust on the pizza was perfectly chewy and crusty, and the toppings were perfect. I think we've found our new pizza place!",5
2839,"Too oily , i felt like im eating pure fat , even the bread is covered with oil ! I suggest they make it healthier with more whole wheat option, grape leaves are very dry and tasteless. Oh and their fries are terrible",1
2840,"First the bad...the amount of oil and butter used in the making of this order would make Paula Deen proud...yet.....\n\nThe food was delicious!! I ordered a small cheese pizza with pepperoni, sausage, and extra cheese...it was enough to feed 3.. Just have wet naps available...and I ordered 6 breaded wings with garlic sauce...there were at least 2 sticks of butter remaining in the container after the wings were gone..and yes, they were devoured!! So good!!! \n\nDelivery was pretty quick as well...",4
2841,"Came here on a Sunday, it was slow and we got our food in good time.\n\nOrdered two personal size pizzas, spicy fries, fried zucchini & onion rings. \n\nThe pizzas were actually really good but the other sides weren't worth it. Tastes plain & over cooked. \n\nOk so the reason why I'm giving this place 1 star is because I saw soooo many health code violations! \n\n* A RedBull can on the pizza dressing table.\n\n* The woman who charged me was working on a pizza and didn't even wash her hands after she charged me! She just went right back to working on making the pizza! \n\n* The same woman who charged me -NOT kidding ...her nails were long & yellow, mind you she wasn't wearing any gloves while putting that pizza together. YUCK!! \n\n* Same chick went out for a cigarette break (in the front of the place) and when she was coming back in she brought AND blew the smoke inside the restaurant. \n\nPrice range in Yelp language is $$\n\nI definitely won't go back because if that's what I was able to witness in the front of the place, I don't want to imagine what's going on in the back!!! I don't think I'm being harsh. That was one too many violations in my opinion.",1
2842,"Incredible pizza. Dirty, rude, disgusting employees. I think that's actually their slogan.",4
2843,"Literally some of the best pizza that I've had in the 4.5 years that I have been in Pittsburgh. I've eaten here a couple of times and I have not had a bad experience yet. The pizzas are delicious, the gyros are wonderful, the falafel is yummy, and their simple cheese burgers and fries are touched by magic! The food is a bit pricier than the average college pizza shop, but I think it's worth it. I've never been inside the actual establishment, but I have had some issues with delivery....sometimes it seems like they pick and choose whether or not they want to deliver to certain locations around 15203. I understand that they have other locations in Bellevue and Aspinwall, but I haven't been to either.",4
2844,"Mushroom cheesesteak with a Stewart's root beer for lunch today. Freshly made, toasted bun, all good! Friendly service.",4
2845,"Okay, so I've heard a lot of good things about this place. And I wanted to like it!\n\nBut it was seriously bad. I very rarely eat somewhere and don't finish my food simply because I don't like it. But I couldn't eat it. I got the Shadyside and it was super greasy, and the flavor just wasn't there. My roommate got the Portabella and she wasn't feelin' it either.\n\nThe guy who served us was cool beans though.",1
2846,"This is probably some of the best drunk food in the strip, neck and neck with Primantis.  I used to eat here a good bit working locally, but it kind of became too heavy to eat for lunch.  Their portions are fabulous and they have or at last had a great lunch special, Italian sub, fries and a drink for like 8 bucks.  Not bad, but you could seriously split it, because you will be sleeping when you get back to your desk.  Great stop on occasion, but too much for a regular stop.",4
2847,"I feel like I need a shower after I eat a Peppi's sandwich, but in a good way.\n\nPeppi's subs are so good I need profanity to fully express how good they are.\n\nGo get a Peppi's sandwich bc you need one.  Not hungry?  Excuse not valid, you need one.\n\nDid you know I can unhinge my jaw and swallow things whole?   I didnt either, until I had Peppi's.\n\nAre you hung over?  Peppi's has HEALING POWERS and will cure your hangover!\n\nAlso, since I'm among friends here I will make a confession.  I do not care for Primanti's.  Somehow thats like telling people you didn't like the Godfather.  I do not like Primanti's, and Peppi's is my favorite \""Pittsburgh\"" sandwich.\n\nI've Peppi'd on the North Side, Dahntahn, and in the Strip District.  They're all good.  I get the Italian, and I love the dressing they put on the sandwich.\n\nNow I want Peppi's and its only 9:30 in the morning.  Damn.\n\nJust go eat at Peppi's.  You'll realize this review is just pure truth.  It's delicious, and greasy, and good.",5
2848,"Wow. Stayed back in November and what a hotel! The architecture of this building is amazing on the outside and the inside. When you walk towards the elevators, it feels like you're in some swanky European Boutique. This place feels first class all the way, but had a pretty fair nightly rate to go along. You could easily walk to a Pirates or Steelers game. Spend the extra dough and get a room with a river view. Amazing!",5
2849,"Great place for a party!  I had a party here last night and the banquet facilities are top notch.  We had several hors d'oevres the lamb lollipops were awesome and a must have when you have an event here.  The lobster rolls were not memorable and I'd suggest you skip these when choosing your items.  The crabmeat stuffed mushrooms were delicious.  I was very impressed with our entrees we had a filet and crabcake dinner.  I'm always a little scared with mass produced filets, but they were all cooked perfectly.  The crabcakes had almost no filler and were jumbo lump crabmeat.  Dante is the banquet manager and very accomodating.  I definitely suggest you select the symphony a and b room for your event.  That's on the second floor with a great view of the north shore and pnc park.  They are not flexible on the food and beverage minimums, but if your party is big enough (I had about 50) they will throw in a complimentary room and may even waive the fee for the coat check girl.   Drinks are reasonable priced and if you request certain types of liquor they will provide them for you.  The hotel itself is beautiful.  The rooms have very comfortable beds and are spacious.  Make sure you request a room with a river view.  I also suggest not valeting.  It's $25 which is way too much for Pittsburgh.",4
2850,"Very nice hotel in a great, convenient location.",4
2851,Lovely hotel experience. Great location in Pittsburgh. The staff were super friendly and helpful and were WAY nice when I left my phone charger in the room after checkout. Our flight was leaving hours after we checked out and they locked up our bags. Went to a wedding here and the food was great and all the facilities were well maintained. I was delightfully surprised.,5
2852,Easter Brunch. One word sums it up Outstanding. The food was great. Not as many choices as The Grand Concours but as good if not better. The service was top notch. Their reservation schedule was well spaced. \nLines almost non existent . A little pricey at 39.99 but worth the extra just not to have to stand in line at the various serving stations. Would go back again.,5
2853,Just spent two nights here and we thought it was very nice. Lobby is beautiful. We stayed on one of the floors hat they are renovating and it was done very sharply and with good taste. Ask for higher floors to minimize noise from outside.,5
2854,"Staying in this hotel changed my entire view on the city of Pittsburgh!  The hotel is in an extremely vibrant area and I am not embarrassed to admit that Pittsburgh is pretty damn cool.  The rooms in this hotel are clean and the staff is fantastic.  If you're driving, parking is conveniently located across the street, though the parking garage should come with a set of directions on exactly where to pay when you leave the building (or maybe I'm just more obtuse than the average parker).  \n\nThe hotel restaurant has pretty good food and the bar is a great place to hang out and have some snacks (the house-made chips are addictive) and enjoy a nice drink.  And if you have the great pleasure of having Sam as your bartender, you're definitely guaranteed good conversation and a few laughs.  Just make sure you bring up Justin Bieber--she really loves that little fella....",4
2855,"I stayed here for a business trip and it was absolutely wonderful. The staff was beyond helpful even for the tiniest requests (like bringing me a mini bar key when I didn't want to move!). The beds are insanely comfortable and the view in both min and a coworkers rooms were gorgeous. If I wasn't going home, I wouldn't want to leave! \n\nAlso there's complimentary and premium wifi but I had no problem with the complimentary!",5
2856,"The Renaissance, by Marriott, is a fantastic hotel in the downtown Pittsburgh area! The staff is extremely courteous and are more than willing to help to make your stay just that much better! Asked for a room with a view, and boy, did they deliver! Amazingly comfortable beds, quick and delicious room service, marbled bathrooms (something that a lot of hotels seem to be going away from for some reason) - what's not to like!",4
2857,Great location - make sure you ask for a view of the river.  Worth the money.,4
2858,I love this place.  I am getting married here in July.  I've been a hotel guest a few times and the service is just fantastic.  The staff knows exactly what to do to make it an enjoyable stay.  The breakfast on the top floor was awesome.  Can't wait until July!  Maybe I should write an update in a few months?,5
2859,"This was a nice hotel.\n\nThe lobby kinda gave me the heebie jeebies as it was pretty dingy and darkly imposing with everything a deep red in color scheme...The room itself was good as it was fairly large, and I hear the beds were quite comfy. I wouldn't know as I slept on the floor....seeing as we had five people in the room and two beds. \n\nThe view was amazing. We arrived at around midnight and were still able to experience the city just by opening up the shades of our fourth floor window that overlooked the Allegheny River and offered a perfect view of both PNC Park and Heinz Field. We took loads of pictures of that postcard view that night and the next morning. Those were keepers!\n\nI'd stay here again if I find myself back in Pittsburgh.",4
2860,"The Renaissance Pittsburgh is an excellent place to stay. The rooms are spacious. The beds are very comfortable. The staff were all very helpful and pleasant. I was here for a conference with breakfast and lunch provided. The food was good and the dining room was beautiful with an amazing view of Heinz Field, Allegheny River and bridges. Braddock's American Brasserie is situated inside the hotel. The food was amazing! Would definitely stay here again. There's a parking deck across the street that's $5/day. Some kind of increase during special events but I wasn't here during any games. Valet at the hotel is $30/day and they park your car in that same deck.",5
2861,"This is a pretty awesome hotel. Rooms are super clean, service is super good. The beds are really comfy. Internet speed is fast enough to stream Netflix. Downtown and close to some good restaurants. I wish all hotels could have this level as the baseline.",5
2862,"I was in town for the night on a business mission.  My co-worker, who is a Marriott awards member, wanted to stay here.  What a great hotel.  It is an older building with lots of charm, elegance, and appeal.  I loved their staircase in the foyer.  The hotel was so beautifully decorated from the moment you walked in.  The location of the hotel is fantastic.  Close to restaurants, shopping, and the stadiums across the river.  \n\nWe had no idea we would be walking into a magnificent evening sponsored by the hotel for its rewards members.   A carving station of prime rib, homemade short rib perogi's, open bar, a sushi bar, and a huge table of fresh desserts consisting of cookies, brownies, and pastries.  It was all complimentary and the food was outstanding.  \n\nThe room was spacious, clean, and updated to an extent.   The shower needed some upkeep.   My room had a great view of the city and river.  Customer service was fantastic.   Our check in person was friendly, professional, and caring about my stay.  Every employee we made contact with was a pleasure to deal with and happy to be there.  Most importantly, I forgot my eye glasses in my room and didn't realize it until I got home.  I called housekeeping and they had found  them.  They sent them out promptly and I received them a couple days later.  \n\nI don't know if I would think about staying anywhere else in Pittsburgh.  My rate was very reasonable for its location and quality of stay.",5
2863,"This is a good hotel, but some flaws keep it from being a great hotel. For $200+ per night, I'd hoped for a little more.\n\nMy wife and I had a king \""city view\"" room. It would be generous to say we had any kind of view of the city (see attached pictures). The high ceilings were the best part of the room. It made a room with not a lot of square footage seem a lot bigger. Unfortunately our room also had peeling wallpaper and chipped paint near the door. It' stuff like this that makes it hard to say this was an exceptional hotel.\n\nLocation was fantastic. We were in town for a game at PNC Park so you couldn't have a better hotel for that purpose. Service was solid both check-in and check-out.\n\nOverall I wouldn't say that this hotel is any better or worse than the Omni William Penn. It does have a better location, but the quality of the rooms and the service is about the same. In the future I'd stay at whichever could give me the better deal.",4
2864,"My husband and I decided to spend an overnight in Downtown Pittsburgh last minute. We already had dinner reservations and show tickets, we just had to find a hotel room. The Renaissance Hotel is literally next door to the Byham Theatre where we had show tickets. I walked in and there was a wedding on the iconic stairs in the foyer! It was so beautiful with guests not only seated on the lobby space but also in the balconies on the second floor. I came in just as the ceremony was finishing. and when they were pronounced husband and wife, those in the balcony threw flower petals upon the couple. The hotel handled those like myself who were not part of the wedding very professionally so the ceremony would not be disturbed, but still service incoming guests. \n\nCheck in was very swift as my husband went to the restaurant to meet our dinner reservation while I checked into the hotel. I was able to take the luggage to the room and return to the restaurant a couple blocks away without even being late. I really liked the makeup mirror since I have to take off my glasses to apply my makeup.\n\nWe had dinner and enjoyed our show. We got out of the show and went to the bar for a late night bite and a drink. We got there at 10:45pm and waited and waited. At 11:04, a blonde waitress finally came to our table after delivering food to another table. We asked to see a menu, but was informed that the kitchen had closed at 11pm. We finished the drinks we had ordered, but had to pay the bartender because the waitress had left for the night. The bartender was a gentleman as I had two bills stuck together when I paid him and he found us outside to return the other one. We had to go across the street to another establishment to get something to eat.\n\nOther than the snafu in the bar, all the staff from check in to check out were very nice and professional. The room was very clean and comfortable. As the need comes up, I will probably choose this hotel when I need to stay Downtown again. It is so close to PNC Park across the Clemente Bridge and it is in the heart of the Cultural District, so all the theaters are very close by. It is also close to public transit so you can get anywhere in Pittsburgh from that spot without having to go too far.",4
2865,"Good food worth waiting, and waiting, and waiting for...  Now wait & wait for the check.",1
2866,Good hotel. Stay here frequently for business trips. Easy walk to PNC park if you want to catch a game. Nice rooms and good service. I would recommend to anyone looking to stay downtown.,4
2867,"The absolute loudest hotel I've stayed at in a long LONG time. Paper thin wall,  poor booking practices ended us up in the middle of the most obnoxious wedding party ever. Drunk bride, hotel room parties until 3am, and an apparent lack of security to monitor anything going on in this hotel have lead to this rave early Saturday morning (and I do mean RAVE quite literally) review. And yes this was after the front desk was called several times with noise complaints. My best tip would be to not stay here unless the purpose of your stay is to not sleep.",1
2868,"The potential for 5 stars was definitely there. The Renaissance is a beautiful hotel in an ideal location of Pittsburg. I was in hotel heaven when I walked into the lobby. It looked expensive and well taken care of. The customer service at check in was spot on. Laura (Lori?) was incredibly friendly and seemed genuinely happy we had chosen the Renaissance for our stay. She saw we booked our hotel through Priceline, and that didn't even affect her demeanor. She asked us a few questions about why we were in town and made me feel like I picked the right place to stay at. She then informed my husband and me that she happened to have a complimentary upgrade to a corner junior suite available. I didn't even ask, which is what made this even more wonderful. She confidently told us that we would love the room. \n\nWow! That room was insanely amazing. Laura was right! Panoramic views of the city, river, bridges and two stadiums. I felt so special having this upgrade and couldn't have asked for a better room. It was great watching the sunset with the option of looking out of any of the 7 windows in the room. The room d\u00e9cor was classy, modern and the bed was super comfy. I made sure to let Laura know that this really exceeded our expectations. \n\nThe reason my experience wasn't five stars was because of the room service. Ever since I was little, I have loved to order room service. It's just something I have to do. My first call in to room service was for a bottle of wine. I was quoted a 30 minute wait, which was reasonable to me. It took about 20 minutes, which I was pleased about. I signed my bill and added my tip. When the gentleman left, I was looking over my bill and thought it seemed really high. I completely didn't realize that a 20% gratuity was already included on top of the room service fee. I had tipped him $5 already, so he made out with $10 in tips. I felt really silly after that and tried to justify in my head why spending $43 on a $27 order was okay. My husband made me feel better by saying it is vacation, don't stress about it. \n\nThe next morning I really was craving a croissant and a beverage. I asked if they had croissants a la carte, which they did. The gal said she could have my order in 15 minutes, but probably less. Wow, that's great, I thought. However, don't overpromise and under deliver. If you are going to claim it will be 15 minutes or less, then I am expecting that. After 30 minutes of waiting, I finally called only to hear the lady tell me my food was on the way. When it arrived, it was the saddest looking croissants I've ever seen. They gave me two mini, stale croissants. I took a picture and couldn't stop laughing about how tiny they were. They obviously were not fresh either.",4
2869,"I got to admit this convention center has a great view of the river! Most centers don't have a view at all, so I was very impressed with this one!\nAs far as convention centers go, this one was roomy, easy to navigate, and very clean! They even had accessible outdoor locations for those wanting to smoke (which I don't condone) or those just needing some fresh air (which I do condone.)\n\nThe only down side I had to this convention center was the waterfall in the middle of the road, under the overpass, beneath the convention center. The echo of the falling water made it very hard to hear yourself let alone the people you're walking with. \n\nOverall great location, easy to walk to from many parts of downtown Pittsburgh, and one of the better convention centers I've been to.",4
2870,"I'm going to keep this short and sweet. Err not too sweet. I live in Bloomfield near the Childrens Hospital. Took my moo moo pie on a walk down (about 25 minutes in the RAIN) to Bow Wow or whatever just to see what they were about and to kind of get a feel for what type of doggie day care this was and some general information.\n\nNot only when I came in dripping wet from the rain there wasn't anyone up front to greet me. She brushed me and my dog off when I asked her about more information. She had an attitude with me didn't really care to go in depth with me about anything. It was kind of \""We do this we do that\"" I ultimately ended up walking out on her mid-sentence. Complete waste of time. I don't usually write negative reviews but geeze if you treat animals better than you treat people fine but I at least deserve some respect.\n\nHer overall attitude was \""I don't even know you I don't even care to know you unless you want to pay for our services.\"" If that's the attitude you want to have I'll pass.",1
2871,"No one is better at anthropomorphizing their pet than I am.  No one.  I religiously check the ingredients of the food that Gus eats, I wake up at absurd hours in the morning during the summer so his walk isn't too hot, and he has this crazy dog seat/throne in the back seat of my car so he can look out the window.  You've all heard of helicopter parenting, yeah?  It's a mess and screwing up today's children, but I'm totally guilty of helicopter doggie parenting.\n\nAll of which is to say that I'm not going to drop Gus off at some random place while I go to work.  \n\nStep 1 (which I think the other reviewer skipped/missed): call them and make an appointment.  Taking a strange dog into a place full of dogs is a little dicey.  Typically, new dogs are brought over on Saturday (when there are no other dogs around) so Barbara can get a sense of its temperament.  Barbara is great with dogs and has a ton of experience, but I totally had the, \""well, if my kid isn't good enough for them, screw them!\"" thoughts running through my head.  Obviously, Barbara instantly saw the inherent awesomeness of Gus.\n\nStep 2: learn to let go.  I don't have kids, but I imagine this is pretty much the same as dropping them off at daycare.  The first few times, they scream and cry when you leave and you're left feeling like a terrible person for the rest of the day.  Then one day, magically, they're excited to go to daycare (or Bow WoW) and they don't even look back while they're led away to the playroom.  It's a bittersweet moment, but one can't help but feel a little proud.  See what I mean about the anthropomorphizing thing?\n\nBow Wow separates the dogs by size and organizes the day into blocks of play, rest, and exercise so the dogs don't get overstimulated, which can cause stress.  The staff is excellent about communicating with owners about even minor changes in your dog's behavior and simply giving you updates about how your dog's socialization and adjustment.  I think I spent the first 2-3 weeks asking, \""Is he playing?  Is he making friends?\"" on a daily basis.  The entire staff was very good about humoring me.\n\nGus loves it there (his radar triggers around 21st street and he starts to flip out in the car) and I feel safe about leaving him there.  And honestly, when it comes to a doggie day care, that's all that matters.",5
2872,"Best doggie daycare in the city. We've been taking our dog here for over a year and we couldn't be happier. The staff is so knowledgeable and really cares about each and every dog. It's a good feeling to know that our dog is being watched by trained dog handlers, not teenagers who are too busy texting. If we ever have a question, the staff at Bow Wow are the first ones we ask as they are so knowledgeable about training, dog health, dog tips, etc. They go the extra mile to make sure they reinforce the training that we have spend a lot of time developing with our dog. I definitely recommend Bow Wow!",5
2873,There is no place I would trust more with my best buddy. They take amazing care of her and love her like their own!,5
2874,"Although I was only there one night I was pretty impressed with this Westin. From the dual head shower to the comfortable bed and pillows, everything was up to expectations. The real positive is that, although I got a room right across from the elevator (If I had been staying more than 1 night I would have requested a different room) it never became a noise issue. The two criticisms I do have are the breakfast menu in the restaurant, (NO BUFFET!!)  and the lack of concise instruction how the \""Green Room\"" operates. For those of you who haven't experienced this as I hadn't, you put your key in a slot by the  door so you can operate the thermostat and bathroom lights. Good idea, maybe more education at check in. One more small annoyance/observation, it seemed as though the AC turned off at about 3:00 AM and the room became pretty uncomfortable. It was all 6 people in our party in six different rooms, not just me.",4
2875,"Yes the beds are comfy and all that... but creature comforts aren't what merit the 5 stars.  A human does.\nHer name is Nasiba.  She's a housekeeper, and she made the room sparkle.  There's no geiger counter that can measure the TLC put into a tautly-tucked bed sheet, but if there were... it'd be spiking in Nasiba's rooms.\nI tracked her down and met her in the hallway, and we had a nice chat.  She's a delight.  She's Turkish, and was a refugee in Russia, but apparently they didn't exactly roll out the red carpet.  She smiles (and melts your heart) when she tells you in her still-being-honed English \""but I came to America seven years ago, and America took me in.  I became a citizen three years ago.  I am American now.\""  Big smile.  Man oh man, in people like her (hard-working and affectionate toward her new home) you see, and revel in the fact, that we are indeed a nation of immigrants.  She took the time to do it right.  And it's moving.  I told her we're very glad she's here.\nPlus, she has a little American flag in her huge cart.  And that made me smile.\nShe gets the Unsung Award of the day.",5
2876,completely worthless wifi.,1
2877,"We are packing now, were here for an academic conference on new guidelines being implemented throughout the states.\nThe beds at the Westin are very comfy, as are the pillows.\nI thought it was a nice stay.\n\n***Wifi is $15.95 a day**** This is highly annoying.  This is not per room it is per computer. My husband paid the fee and the network only connected his computer. When he is away at the conference, I have no access to wifi.\nThe television seems to also go black several times during programs.",4
2878,"After looking at the hotel online I was excited, the pictures looked new and very nice. I was in town attending a conference at the convention center so along with how great everything looked, you couldn't beat the location. \n\nHowever, I had the absolute worst hotel experience at the Pittsburgh Westin. I am a Starwood Preferred Guest member and up until now have had great experiences, but this one was so bad it really makes me question the integrity of the brand and I am hesitant to stay at another Starwood establishment. \n\nEven tonight as I try to log into my SPG to see if my points for being \""conservative\"" with the room were updated, I can't logon to the site as \""The system is temporarily unavailable.\"" I should also note I have photographs of everything, because I couldn't believe how bad the stay was. \n\n1. The terrible experience happened before I even arrived. When I googled the hotel, accusations of bed bugs appeared on both Yelp.com and Bedbegregistry.com - and the hotel had yet to take the time to respond. A simple detail that if someone was paying attention they would be able to resolve. \n\n2. I arrived at the hotel after a 7+ hour drive only to find out that the bathroom in my hotel room was broken. After two calls to Guest Services, about 30 minutes later a maintenance man came by, and it took him about 15 minutes to fix it. So a total of 45 minutes before I could use the rest room after arriving. I had suggested to Guest Services on the second call that they move me to a new room and it was awkwardly laughed off. \n\n3. After using the restroom (finally!) I noticed the tub was dirty and there was mold on the top of the shower by the rod and on top and inside the mini-fridge. The mold was \""new\"" so it could have easily been wiped off and taken care of if the room was being properly clean and attention to detail was paid. The fact that the hotel lacked the ability for such simple house keeping was surprising. \n\n4. The paint in various places of the room was chipping and some of the furniture, most notably the side table were knicked and scratched badly. \n\n5. Because of the bed bug reviews, I stripped the sheets to look for evidence. I did not find any, but did become aware of many brown and black tar stains on the sheets that were tucked in to the mattress. \n\n6. I begrudgingly ordered room service because of how late it was by the time I got settled. I ordered the Turkey BLT with lemon aioli and arugula salad. Instead I got cold, what-seemed-like-day-old deli meat, burnt bacon with a thin, thin layer of mayo, not aioli. The arugula salad did not have 1 piece of arugula - it was mixed greens with shredded carrots instead. When you read the description and look at what I actually received, it is very, very disappointing. \n\n7. The coffee pot in my room leaked all off, wetting the sugar, napkins, etc. \n\n8. They charged the wrong credit card after both myself and my office manager telling several different people which card to charge. I had booked the room on a corporate card, and my office manager had believed she straightened everything out at the front desk that they were to charge the card on file because I would not have the corporate card with me. The first thing I was asked by the front desk was for a credit card. After I explained the situation to the front desk, they insisted that the card on file would be charged and they just needed my card for \""incidentals\"" - after back and fourth I gave in and gave them my card, assured it would not be charged. Then when I checked out two days later, I once again confirmed that they would charge the card on file and they still charged the wrong one.  Fast forward to the following week when I notice the charges, I called the billing department and someone has still yet to return my call. I am being charged interest on this card for their mistake. \n\nThis was an absolute terrible experience and I am very disappointed at the Westin and Starwood Hotels for their obvious lack of pride and detail with this hotel.",1
2879,Really poor service and way overpriced. You could make much better choices.They do not keep to a high standard of service.\nThe rooms are not worth the money.,1
2880,"I've always loved this hotel. Lovely location right by the river, near enough to the sports venues for a pretty easy walk over the bridges.\n\nCheck in was pleasant as I've always experienced here, staff were all very friendly and helpful.\n\nRooms were clean but could use a bit of updating; finding a convenient outlet to charge my phone was a bit of a challenge. \n\nOne odd note, you must use your room key in order to turn the lights on in the room. There is a slot for that purpose just as you enter so, take my advice and get at least 2 room keys.\n\nThe restaurant attached to the hotel, a lovely, fine dining establishment called the Old Fishmarket, is slated to close at the end of October, 2014...in it's place is going to be a restaurant called \""Bill's Burgers & Grill\"" I hear it is good, but we shall see next time I stay here.\n\nThere is the option of self-parking or valet parking on site at the hotel.",4
2881,"Everything was perfect about my stay here. The moment you step out of your vehicle you are greeted by friendly and helpful staff. The room was super clean and nicely decorated, spectacular river view over looking the Pittsburgh skyline, Heinz Field and PNC Park. Best part..The room was very quiet, ultra deluxe beds that was heavenly and the complimentary hot chocolate and marshmallows that was waiting in our room after a chilly evening stroll where all nice touches. Can't beat the location, we where within walking distance of many great restaurants, bars, shopping and public transportation. Amazing hotel! Super sweet staff. Will definitely stay here again the next time we are in Pittsburgh.",5
2882,Valet lost my car keys and have been incredibly unprofessional! Completely unacceptable and I would warn everyone about using valet services here. Disgusted.,1
2883,"Horrible, go to Long John Silver's. I hear oyster bar and think delicious raw oysters not deep fried crap .",1
2884,"Great fast fried seafood, cash only and a few other options.\n\nDon't be confused this place consists of two establishments and one kitchen. One is a bar with waiters and liquor, the other is a fast food style place. I chose the latter. Walk in and you will find a menu board with a few specials printed out hanging off of it, no frills, no credit cards, all local flavor.\n\nI went with the Titanic special $10.75 Which included a \""monster\"" fish sandwich, and two sides, I chose fries and onion rings.\n\nEverything is made to order, which means crispy fries, rings and a crust on hot flakey fish. The fish here is the real thing not some unnatural square, a large fillet of mild white fish with a great breading on a simple bun. The condiments are on the table and up to you, tartar sauce, hot sauce, a spicy \""famous\"" vinegar and ketchup. It was a big sandwich but not titanic maybe just queen marry.\n\nBottom line if you want some fried food and have cash give this a try.",4
2885,"My parents and I came here after my dad had boasted about how good there food was and that he would bring his HP customers here for lunch. Upon arrival we immediately were ignored so we ended up seating ourselves. \n\nThe place was unacceptably dirty, our table was dirty the floor was dirty, heck even the walls seemed to have a layer of grime. Both the waitress and the bartender were extremely  rude. \n\nMy mom and I got a beer and my dad tried to order a martini, immediately we received dirty looks from both the bartender and the waitress, they said they didn't have them so my dad asked for straight vodka in a glass to which she brought a shot  of vodka instead. I understand it's not a full bar or a classy place but to serve alcohol and react the way the servers did was ridiculous!\n\n I ordered a grilled fish sandwich that lacked flavor and was horrible greasy, the fried scallops were disgusting.\n\nI understand that the restaurant has seen better days but wow, will i be going back, methinks not!",1
2886,"Rhode-Islander approved!!\n\nHow have I not been to this place before?  Authentic clam chowder, delicious fried fish, tartar sauce by the bucket... heaven!\n\nI guess I can see where Pittsburghers may not share my sentiment, but believe me, this is the closest to New England-style seafood I have EVER encountered in the 'burgh.  OK, so they only have clam strips and not whole bellies and clam cakes (fritters) are nowhere to be seen, but the chowder and lightly breaded fish (Famous Fish sandwich) make up for it.\n\nI loved the dynamic in this place.  It was CROWDED (Friday during Lent, what should I have expected?), but the kitchen staff was turning out fish sandwiches by the dozen.\n\nThis will definitely become a regular lunch spot for me (if, that is, I can find enough people in the 'burgh who actually like seafood).",4
2887,"The good: I'll eat anything they want to batter and fry up, all the fried food was steaming, crispy, flavorful, tender, and delicious. Portions are large, I got the \""fish nuggets\"", I expected tiny nibbles but was pleasantly surprised by prepared mountains of battered fish the size of my fists.\n\nPrices are extremely reasonable, my wife and I happily stuffed ourselves and got drinks for under $30.   The prices are good anywhere, but especially for  the prime downtown hot spot of market square.  The Oyster House is Pittsburgh's oldest bar and restaurant, and has been featured in several movies over the years.  They have lots of vintage photos hanging on the wall.  The staff is gruff, but friendly, true Pittsburghers.\n\nThe bad: As I mentioned, it was founded in 1870, and it doesn't appear to have been updated since, it felt run down. The atmosphere is lacking, they serve you with paper plates and plastic utensils.  Anything not fried was mediocre.  The crab cakes and deviled crab were oversalted.  They don't serve Heinz Ketchup which seems wrong given both their historical heritage and that they are located about 100 feet away from the Heinz Global HQ in PPG.\n\nWould I go back to the Original Oyster?  Sure!  Great portions, low prices, tasty food.  I want to try the \""Monster Fish Sandwich\"" which is supposedly Moby Dick sized (eat it before it eats you!)  But if you're looking for a high end experience with classy atmosphere, this isn't the place.  It's a good bar with good bar food, go in with the right expectations and you'll be well satisfied.",4
2888,This restaurant is horrible.  The waitress was rude and tried to rush us.  The only oyster on the menu is a terrible patty of some kind.  How can you call yourself an Oyster House and not serve either fried oysters or raw???  The food overall was ok.  I would never go or eat there again!,1
2889,The worst most over breaded oysters ever...It's a dive to boot.,1
2890,"Only has 1 person working and serving the restaurant. Took 15 minutes to be asked if I wanted a drink, another 15 minutes to get a menu after asking for one. Annoying wait, they need to hire more people",1
2891,"I stopped in for lunch and it was busy-- about 15-20min wait from the time I walked in till I got my order, but let me tell you, it was worth the wait. I had the oyster sandwich, clam chowder, and calamari. The oysters were very tender and I only wished the sandwich had a few more on it, cuz it wasn't very filling. Good thing I had the soup & calamari.. The clam chowder was sinfully delicious, with a heavy cream base and tons of flavor. The calamari was okay, nothing to brag about, but the sandwich and chowder couldn't have been better. \nThe oyster House is split up into two different restaurants next-door to each other.. To the right side is a sitdown restaurant with a bar and the left side is a casual quick stop shop with a counter to order at (which is where I chose to go). The interior is a bit dark & outdated and it doesn't have much of a welcoming atmosphere, but the outdoor tables in Market Square are a great option, weather permitting.",4
2892,Oyster shooters in a plastic cup. Looked a little dirty. Shooters just tasted like ketchup.,1
2893,"This place is awful.  The pizza is not good, but what is worse is the people who run the place.  They screwed up my order and refused to fix it.  I told them I was going to throw it away and order from somewhere else.  And I did.  Its really too bad, they are super close to my apartment. If they would've just been nice and switched it, I'd probably order from them again just based on that alone.",1

2897,"I'm glad I listened to my friend's recommendation and not some of these bad reviews. We're just in town for the night and wanted something delivered to our hotel. They said it would take an hour, which I expected on Super Bowl Sunday right at game time, but it was here in less than half an hour. \n\nThe pizza was delicious! Just the right balance of cheese and a tasty sauce, generous with the toppings, and a nicely crispy crust but not too thin.",5
2898,"Looking for a quick bite to eat and a local told me this was \""the best pizza in the city.\""  I got a plain slice and a pepperoni slice. Possibly the worst pizza I have ever eaten.

2900,"A great neighborhood bar in the strip with authentic tasting Irish pub food. I'm a fan of going early (though it's so empty and lonely looking early in the day) for a brunch of bangers, rashers, and mash. Inventive cocktails, and events (on their calendar) are some high points. The bathrooms stick out in your mind though, because they're down some narrow stairs and seemingly so far away they might as well be in a different building. And they may be.",5
2901,"All the way at the far end of the Strip we finally found the best bar in the neighborhood (admittedly out of only a handful that exist).\n\nThis place was charmingly well worn around the edges, but it's mostly a standard American-Irish pub, with all the familiar bric-a-brac and beer taps.  I have to object strenuously to a few of the drinks on the menu.  First, there is a \""Dark Bomb\""--Guinness and Jagermeister.  Then there is an \""Irish Pancake\""--Guinness and butterscotch schnapps.  And finally there is the \""Irish Hoe\""--half Guinness, half Hoegaarden.  These are crimes against nature.  I can't vouch for the last one, but the first two were terrible (of course I had to try them).  Jagermeister has no business within ten feet of Guinness, and the Pancake would have been okay if they halved the amount of butterscotch.  \n\nThis month's featured beer is Red Stripe--get five bottles for $15.  The pints have some odd prices:  $5.61 for Guinness and Newcastle and $4.68 for Sam Adams.\n\nThey had some live music (a guy with a wee guitar singing eclectic covers) which was decent and ended at 1am.  We were the last patrons before closing at 2, and despite them sweeping and putting up chairs, nobody ever chased us out or even looked at us askance.",4
2902,"Harp & Fiddle is the gem in Pittsburgh's strip district.  They have several beers on tap, great food, and a nice, relaxed atmosphere.  The staff is especially pleasant and very friendly.  H&F is an excellent place for the end of the work week.  They have nightly specials during happy hour Which lasts from 5pm to 7pm. H&F also has live bands playing nightly.  The acts range from up tempo rock music to laid back acoustic guitar acts.  Overall, H&F has something for everyone and is an awesome place to go for good beer and good times with the people you love to be around.",5
2903,Horrible staff! Terrible attitude and we could tell didn't want to be there.  Screwed up our bill and was visible aggravated and angry when we questioned charges.  This awful service makes us never want to return.,1

2907,Came here for a few beers after a bit Pittsburgh yelp event. Which was awesome by the way. \n\nIt's a nice cosy neighborhood bar to have a few i think. \n\nThe prices for 2 beers were nearly 20 bucks. But they were craft beers. But i was a bit surprised and taken back by the price. But I'm sure a miller is 2 dollars. he he. \n\nI didn't stay very long. We had the journey back to Beaver County.

I'll often go with their delicious green curry or satisfying Pad Thai (not the best Pad Thai Pittsburgh has, but the best downtown lunchtime offering I've found).  All lunch specials come with soup (small but fulfilling) and spring roll (tiny but delicious), which makes the price (around $7) a pretty good deal.",4
2912,"This was the single worst Thai meal I have ever had in my life.\n\nI went here for dinner with some friends after going to the PSO, since they were open relatively late at night.  This proved to have been a massive error in judgement on all our parts.\n\nThe first thing I ordered was a bowl of lemongrass soup.  The listing of ingredients made it seem like it should be tom yum soup, which is one of my favorite soups.  What I received was a bowl of dishwater-colored broth containing tomatoes, so that it tasted like watered-down minestrone, with some chicken submerged in shame at the bottom of the bowl.  A single lonely wilted leaf of cilantro wallowed on top.  No lemongrass was in evidence, but there were plenty of mushrooms.  I stopped eating this when I unearthed an unsightly artifact which turned out to be the bottom of a mushroom stem, with dirt still clinging to it.\n\nMy companions both got chicken and stir-fried vegetables in what turned out to be Singapore curry sauce.  This was passable, but not exciting -- again, although it claimed to be lemongrassy, there was no lemongrass flavor to be had, and the chicken was a bit rubbery and overdone.\n\nI got one of the fish entrees.  On the menu, the description made out like it was covered in a spicy sauce.  It turned out to be more like a not-at-all-spicy soup with bits of orange roughy floating in it.  Again, the broth was lacking in overall flavor, as if they were trying to save on costs by not adding enough spices.  The fish itself was at least not overcooked or dirty, but it was a poor aesthetic decision to bread and fry the piece of fish, then put the breaded coating into soup.  Gross.\n\nTo top it off, the service wasn't that great, and we were actually charged for the dirt-filled soup.  We will not be back.",1
2913,"terrible service is right.  the minute my coworker and i walked in, the host (i think the teenage son of the owner?) was just rude.  he was going to give us the table closest to the register where people are always walking in and out.  my coworker asked to be seated at one of the other 8 tables that were open.  he mumbled something, but then let us grab another table.  and when he served the dishes he pretty much was throwing them onto the table.\n\nthe wonton soup was horrible.  the wonton itself was pretty much all dough (not even cooked all the way thru) and i don't even want to speculate what the tiny meat in it was made of.  i've also tried the house soup which is just water with tomotoes in it.  for my entree i had the green curry w/chicken, which actually wasn't as bad as the service but that's not saying much at all.\n\nsad that this is one of the few places for asian food in the pitts...",1
2914,"You pay for what you get. I thought the food was good in taste and quantity for the price. Service wasn't great, but I don't think I have ever had great service at any Thai restaurant.",4
2915,Waiter was awful and food (pad thai) was not much better. Apparently letting the waiter know that your soda is flat (twice) is a huge inconvenience to him.,1
2916,"This is by far the worst Thai restaurant I've ever been to. The servers are rude and slow, and the food is awful. Everything pretty much looks and tastes the same. The waiter seemed annoyed that my eating partner complained that his soda was flat, and brought him another flat soda. When he complained again, the waiter told him to see the host on the way out.  If you are in the area, there are many better choices for a good meal, other than this place.",1
2917,Stay away!!!!!! The waiters/waitresses hate you and your hapiness.,1
2918,"Poor service, awful attitudes and sub-par food.  I could make the same food in my own kitchen ... Hope to see another Thai spot open downtown.",1
2919,"This restaurant has never been great, but if you wanted an Asian restaurant in the Cultural District it was an OK place to go. However, last night's dinner was just plain bad. I had beef salad, and it was some coolish beef on iceberg lettuce with sliced onions and a totally forgetful sauce. Nothing like the mix of sweet, sour, and spice that it should have. I also had tofu panang. It was also virtually tasteless. Some coconut milk flavoring in otherwise nondescript brown sauce with no spiciness.",1
2920,"A very lovely name for a very terrible resturant. \n\nThe food is bland, bland bland. How this place can serve such flavorless food and stay open for years is beyond me. \n\nThe inside of the resturant is cramped and poorly maintained. \n\nI decided  to play it safe and ordered the broccoli in garlic sauce. The sauce was slimy and the broccoli was water logged and over cooked.  As if it has set in a pot of luck warm water for hours before being served to me. \n\nI'm noticing a theme of horrible resturants on 6th Street and I don't like it.",1
2921,"Don't waste your time or money. Rude service, and pizza was subpar.  So many better options right around. Please dont cut corners on quality of your product.   The bar looked small and quaint. ..maybe the beer is really cold or I just hit a bad day.  For pizza? Na ...won't be back! NEXT!!!",1
2922,"i go here because it's close and because i like sweetened iced coffee black.  also because i hate crazy mocha and there lack of making a simple sugar to sweeten iced drinks.  truthfully, i wouldn't go here if jeet was open at normal coffee hours.  why?  bad staff...well, one staff member in particular .the woman in front of me in line totally polite to her. me totally opposite. rude .big attitude and not even a thanks. i really don't care one way or the other about your sexuality but don't take it out on me because im a guy.",1
2923,"I agree with the comments posted by others.  I give it four stars because it really is a great benefit to the local community and the get some amazing bands.  I also really like how simple they have kept it.  Also agree that you need to check the website regularly.  But honestly, I can't think of many PGH clubs that get an A for promoting their shows.",4
2924,"This store is small, so the merch is limited, but the volunteer staff does a pretty good job of keeping it stocked. There is always new stuff there. The real draw of this place is that it is cheap. I mean, it beats the pants off the prices at any other thrift store in town. There's furniture too. Additionally, it supports the fine and commendable work of the Thomas Merton Center, so you can get worthwhile junk for superlow prices and support an organization you should be supporting already. Wow!",4
2925,"I visited PA in 2012, where I stayed for a month. During that time, I stumbled upon this little gem when the hotel offered me some menus from around the area. I took a shot on China House and was so unbelievably surprised by the food. It was easily the best Chinese food I've ever eaten, and that's saying a lot, as Chinese is, without a doubt, my favorite cuisine, so I've eaten it a lot in my life. the boneless ribs were the juiciest, most tender boneless ribs I've ever had; the rice was superb, and the egg rolls were amazing. It was so good, I wound up eating there numerous times in that month I was there, and still today, I find myself comparing it to the Chinese food here in Miami where I live. Still have not found any that comes close to PA's China House. My father felt the same way, and when he learned he might have to go back to PA in Sept, he taunted me with how he was going to the China House, it was that amazing! On a final note, it was so good, I made sure to bring back a menu from there so I wouldn't forget where it was, in case I go back.",5
2926,try the sesame chicken or mixed vegetables w fried tofu- ask for it spicy. the owners are very nice too.,4
2927,i just ate half of a cockroach.  Gross.  Never going here again.,1
2928,China House is my new go to Chinese take out restaurant in Pittsburgh ever since yen's closed up and then changed hands. \n\nKeep in mind it's a take out place. You're not expecting to get gourmet food on gold lined plates - you're getting tasty food in plastic containers and not eating there. (There's only two tables)\n\nWith that in mind it's great. Big portions and I've never been let down. Sometimes you get free stuff too. Coupons for 10% off and free soda.,5
2929,"Appearances can be deceiving!  From the outside, it looks like an old house, but on the inside, such a cute romantic date restaurant.  The service was superb!  The server was very attentive, but not overbearing.  The food was reasonably priced with large portions.  The menu was quite overwhelming with lots of choices!  I will definitely return again to try something else!",4
2930,"Every time I have been to Cafe Sam I have been very disappointed.  On my most recent visit, the waiter was overbearing, the menu confusing, and the food unremarkable.  Avoid this place.",1
2931,"Cafe Sam has a cool Pittsburgh vibe. It's a bit funky but the food is good and interesting and their menu offers a lot of choices. I went with a group and we all had the Prix Fixe menu. It was a little bit pricey, but I think it was well worth it.",4
2932,"Extreemly dated on the inside- the menu was pretty broad, everything from lots of pasta selections lamb, to duck, to burgers and hotdogs..  We had great drinks, appetizers, salads, and entrees.",4
2933,"This is the strangest place, but I love it!  From the outside, I would guess this place used to be a funeral home.  It's very strangely decorated on the inside.  The main dining room is a weird pink and green, extremely dated and in the middle of the room, there is this huge odd fake flower display.\n\nThat said, the food is super yummy!  They give bunches of samples while you are waiting.  The wait staff is really nice.  I had the filet mignon and it was amazing.  Others at the table got different items, and I tried a little bit of everything.  All very good.  The menu is really strange, and like another said, there is no theme.  But, everything sounds good.\n\nI have never been a huge fan of the Pittsburgh dining scene, but I really like this place despite its odd decor.  Skip the faux fancy pants places and try this.  (Oh and it's also very reasonably priced).",5
2934,"Great experience. Staff was quite attentive and seemed to genuinely care about our experience. Allowed us to sample a couple appetizers. Most of the items we had for dinner (appetizers, entrees and dessert)",5
2935,We have not been to this restaurant in quite sometime. What a great lunch menu. Highly recommend checking out.,5
2936,"One of two places to check out whenever I'm in Pittsburgh. For such a small space, Paul's is incredibly dense. They have this unique carding procedure where they keep all the new CDs behind the counter and you bring the card up to the counter to get it. They usually have an amazing used CD selection as well. Plus, they have MOJO and UNCUT magzines flown in from the UK and you can usually get them about a month before Borders does! On most days Paul himself will be there. They are also very plugged into the local scene, as far as what they carry. I rarely leave here without a few amazing finds!",5
2937,"Paul's is my favorite record shop in town! \n\nAs others have noted--it's not a big place, but it is chock full of (well-organized!) stuff! They have a wide variety of music and the staff is very knowledgeable and friendly.  They know about *music,* not just one variety and they've never been condescending or rude. If they don't have something you're looking for in stock, they'll gladly order it for you, and they were very helpful when I was trying to find out whether an old jazz record had been reissued on CD. \n\nIf I can't buy my CDs straight from the band, Paul's is where I go.",5
2938,"This was my first visit to Paddy Cake.  I had to pick up a little something for this diabetes support group I belong two.  Yes, I am aware of the irony folks.  Just remember this, diabetics can have cakes and sweets in moderation!  And my little group has evolved into an excuse to get together and play cards or board games!  Anyway, I picked up a small coffee cake for the occasion.\n\nThis place is a treat just to walk into.  It's got everything a traditional bakery should have and is very inviting.  I read a few bad reviews on Google about their customer service.  I don't see why--their service seemed fine to me.  I haven't actually tasted the cake yet, so I can't comment on it.",4

2940,"I would have to put Angelo's in the upper 10% of pizza joints here in Pittsburgh. They make you're standard medium thick crust, heavy cheese, heavy cooked sauce, heavy toppings pizza. That being said, they do each of those components better than most pizza shops. The crust is crispy and chewy and actually tastes like something, the cheese doesn't taste like cheap pre-shredded junk, and the sauce is flavorful enough to stand up to the heavy handed cheese and toppings. \n\nOh, and the pizza tastes great cold the next day so go ahead and order a little more than you need!",4
2941,"I was skeptical about going to a typical pizza shop during a food tour in Bloomfield, but boy was I wrong. This pizza is really good and you can tell that they do not pick the cheap ingredients off of the shelf. The dough was perfect (cooked well, but kinda doughy) and the cheese was excellent.",4
2942,"One of the best hoagies I have ever had. Warm and toasted. Great mayo. Large serving. Soft drinks are refillable. The 1980's atmosphere is not too impressive, but this is just a pizza shop. Great place to bring out of town guests. I will be back again and can't wait to try the Sicilian pizza.\n\nI got mayo on the hoagie and was excellent, now I know why... It has a garlic flavor and I love garlic.",5
2943,"Sometimes I like to stop into a pizza place for one slice of pizza.  I have found that the places with the best pizza have \""horrible horrible\"" individual slices.  The slices have often been sitting for a long time.  Then if the individual slices are reheated, it still is not quite right.  Then often these individual slices have a very limit amount of cheese and toppings.  Angelo's does not do this.  There individual slices are the BEST!!!!  Everytime I get one slice of pizza at Angelo's it is always pippin' HOT.  It has that just made t.  They are very generous with their toppings on the individual slices. Plus, their individual slices are huge.  I always get them to cut that one slice into two.  I tried to eat half of my slice at the shop and then take the other half home for later.  Their pizza is so delicious the other half often does not make it home.",5
2944,I haven't been here yet but after reading about the Bikes Before Christmas project here http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/08311/925595-94.stm I just want to go here and buy some bike stuff.\nMore about Bikes Before Christmas here - http://iheartpgh.com/2008/11/06/donate-bikes-for-kids/,5
2945,"Easily the best bike shop in Pittsburgh.\n\nLet me qualify that by saying if you are looking for a $12,000 Carbon Triathlon bike this probably isn't the shop...\n\nIt is, however, THE SHOP if you are looking to work on your bike for free.  Gerry has 6 fully equipped stations in the back where he will let you work on your bike for free.\n\nAny part is available, at less than full list prices.  It really doesn't get any better than this.",5
2946,"Kraynick's is a real gem for Pittsburgh.  This isn't the place to take your high-end carbon frame bike, but Jerry will help you get your commuter, beater, or frame you found trashed in a ditch in the woods back on the road.  (Seriously, there was a guy in there salvaging an old MTB frame he found in a ditch in the woods.)  Be forewarned: he's pretty typical of a lot of old school Pittsburghers: very gruff at first, but actually a nice guy when he warms up to you.\n\nI haven't had a bike in ten years and decided out of nowhere to build one around an old frame and a new internal gear hub.  I bought a few high-end components online and the rest from Jerry.  Despite bringing in outside parts, Jerry was still gushing with help, and, after several weeks and 3-4 visits, I'm riding a bike that I built from scratch after going in with no mechanical knowledge of bikes at all.  \n\nHe doesn't carry new super-high-end components, but the stuff he does carry is solid, and he has every weird bracket or screw or cable guide you can imagine from decades of scrounging parts.  He can help you with any weird setup you want.  (Mine's definitely out-of-the-ordinary.)\n\nOne warning: this is your standard old Pittsburgh small business, so he doesn't take credit cards.  It's a little annoying considering that you might be spending over $100 on parts and service, but there's an ATM down the block.",5
2947,"Seriously my favorite pizza in the 'burgh! The cheese mix is amazing, and the crust is nice and thin. Awesome people work there and good beer prices/selection.",4
2948,"The best pizza in Pittsburgh, hands down.  6 stars for the pizza, n/a for the other food, 4-star decent beer selection for the size of the place, 2 star for the prices, 5 stars for the owner, 2 stars for the employees/service, 5 stars for timeliness. When it comes down to it I rate take-out and delivery places mostly based on food taste because I am not going elsewhere for superior service and inferior food, so Graziano's gets 5 stars by my standards. I have friends who visit from out of town who order it to take home. It's that good. Don't be fooled by the single slices though, as it seems they use a different recipe for them (they kinda suck). Go for the large plain or extra cheese. Perfecta!",5
2949,"The pizza is good overall--not too much sauce, fantastic crust, okay cheese--and it is great for the price.  A little greasy, but once that's wiped away and a little parm is sprinkled on top, the pizza veers towards excellence.  $12 and change for the large pie.  They also sell 40's and 6-packs of beer, ranging from PBR to Victory and Bell's for somewhat decent prices, around $9 per 6-pack.  You can also pick up some Boone's Farm, which I only mention for the sheer hilarity.\n\nWhile I'm happy to take-out from here, I'd probably end up dropping a star if I ever stayed inside for longer than 5 minutes--it's fairly filthy.  However, the staff is nice and it never takes longer than 20 minutes for a take-out order to be ready.",4
2950,"I was in Pittsburgh since yesterday from out of town on business. Tonight was the conclusion a long day and all I wanted was to go back to my hosteI and maybe grab a bite to eat. In my haste to get dinner before I passed out, I almost made the mistake of entering Fazio's, the other hole-in-the-wall pizza joint on Penn Avenue in Lawrenceville. Well-I am glad I did not do that!  Remembering that the restaurant I quickly Yelped before walking out from the hostel had a longer name, I continued to walk down Penn Avenue until I found Graziano's. Upon entering, I was greeted by a slightly unwelcoming smell. It wasn't pizza I was smelling, or at least fresh pizza. But I remembered how positive all the reviews on Yelp were. I was a little disappointed when I saw how small their menu was, and yet it still took me a while to order. I first contemplated getting the fried fish with french fries. I do love a crispy fish sandwich. There was even a girl at another table who had just gotten hers for eating there. I tried to inconspicuously spy her fried fish. It looked good but it's a who lot a fish. I decided to order the steak and cheese sub instead. Now that I am home eating, I am glad I went to Graziano's and I am very impressed with their steak sub. Meaty, greasy, tangy, and large. What more can I say? That's a good steak sub. The bread is slightly toasted but still soft. Just perfect. I don't know many places that put Italian dressing and mayo on steak and cheeses, but I like the combo. It's more than enough food for 2 and only costed 9 bucks. I think I will finish it all off because I did not eat lunch today. MMM. stiill got lots more to enjoy. I recommend Graziano's for take out, not eating in. There are tables and chairs, but as I mentioned...the smell is a little off-putting. like the inside of an old dish cloth.  If they could fix that, they would be golden.",4
2951,"Read some reviews and decided to try them out. Im very pleased with the haircut and even more pleased with the price. Walked right in, no wait, asked for what i wanted and they delivered. Will be returning!",4
2952,Great place. Got my haircut there for the first time today. Great price too. Only negative - I wish they did a neck shave with a straight razor.,4
2953,"I've figured Dan out - no matter what you ask for, you get the same haircut. It's not bad, its just, you know, the Pittsburgh special. Super friggin' short. I'm getting my tattoo sleeves finished this week to better fit in this city.",4
2954,I love these kind of barbershops.  Straight out of a Twilight Zone time warp. especially  the prices.  Very friendly (Pittsburgh is a friendly town to begin with.)  Quick cut.  Very nice if what you want is basic.,5
2955,"Mmmmm delicious pizza at a great price.\n\nI got a pie last time I was in town will defiantly be back! Service was straight forward, just order what you want and come back in 10-15 minutes for the goodness.\n\nI ordered a medium (14\"") pie 1\\2 pepperoni 1\\2 mushroom for $9.10 ($7.50 + $1.60). Took a quick 10 minute walk and our pie was ready for us to grab a seat outside and enjoy.\n\nPerfect location to grab a bite to eat and watch the world go around.\n\nIngredients were very fresh, the cheese was delicious and the crust was nice and crisp. \n\nThey offer pies, hoagies and calzones... sticking to what they are good at.\n\nI will definitely be back to enjoy another slice.",4
2956,They have really good pizza for really cheap. Bloomfield rocks!,4
2957,"If i was rating the sandwiches and whole pizzas, it would definitely be five stars all the way.   However their single slices are horrible.  I thought they would heat them up after the slices sit in the heater area.  I asked for extra sauce, thinking that the slices will be heated.  I was given a slice of pizza with cold sauce.",4
2958,"People's Indian is a solid traditional Indian place. Offerings are standard, but well done. I like their bindi masala and vegetable korma. In meat offerings, their lamb is really quite good.\n\nTheir lunch buffet has a solid selection of both meat and vegetable dishes and includes samosas, which not all buffets do. Also included is chai, which is good (if overly sweet).\n\nIn general, it's one of the better local Indian places. The service is also pretty consistent and pleasant (unlike, say, India Garden where the service is consistently horrific).",4
2959,Best palak paneer. Hands down.did a palak paneer test a few years agos.. included graphs and etc... still have my heart. the spicey could be spicier.. ill just throw that out there....,5
2960,"Cheap, yummy, and down the street from my house.  Down side?  Anyone?\n\nI won't go in to the particulars--I agree with some of the comments below--I will remind people that it's BYOB (I really think Indian food tastes so much better with a beer) so come prepared.  \n\nI would not call it life-alteringly-good Indian, but I've found much of the food to be flavorful and the service has always been friendly, if a bit slow at times.  \n\nDecor is typical--seems like a kid-friendly place and good for large groups as well.  \n\nOh, and they're closed on Sundays, for which I'm happy for them, but I have to admit I would probably go more often if I could grab take-out on a cold sunday afternoon. . . (that's a hint if the owners are reading)",4
2961,"I just wrote a bad review so I want to counter it with a good one. People's Restaurant easily wins the top slot on Kelly G's list of the best Indian food in Pittsburgh. The restaurant itself is small and no-frills (Indian shabby chic, you might call it), but they have a big table in the middle suitable for large parties. Their lunch buffet is smaller than India Garden's but slightly more delicious. Greg B. and I get take out, add a bottle of wine, and have romantic dinner parties-for-two on our front porch. Perfection.",4
2962,"At first glance I wasn't too impressed with the buffet, I thought it'd be another botched attempt of authentic Indian food. While the selection is not that impressive, I would say that the quality is pretty damn good. \nI debated for a long time with my friend about the food going back and forth between a 3 and a 4. I ended up going with the 4 due to the Indian tea that they had - hard to find at any buffet!. \nThey aren't trying to wow you with exotic ingredients or fun twists, it's almost as if you're sitting down at someone's house and eating what they'd eat on a regular basis. Plus you're paying around 9 dollars for a buffet, I mean- let's get real. You get what you pay for.",4
2963,"I ordered chicken vindaloo at spice level 10 and garlic nan as take out.\n\nThe chicken vindaloo was quality.  I enjoyed it.  It wasn't super spicy, but I'm used to that.  I've never found Indian food with the same level of heat as I've had in England.\n\nThe garlic nan was amazing.  Nice garlic smell, visible chunks of garlic, nicely toasted bread, everything about it was very good.",4
2964,local treasure. i'm in love with this place. 7 dollar lunch buffet (always a mistake unless you plan on sleeping the rest of your day) and byob. recommended!,5
2965,"Prices are excellent, food is EVEN BETTER. I am a vegetarian, and found the selection and quality to be just as good as Indian restaurants charging double the price. I attend a convention annually in Pittsburgh, and \""People's\"" will definitely be on the \""must visit\"" list for future years.",5
2966,"It's a travesty that I haven't written People's a review yet. I may have dined in or taken out from People's over 100 times. That is not a joke. At one point, years ago, I'm pretty sure they knew our take out order by heart. At which point, all we had to do was call and begin to order the first item and they completed the rest. \n\nSo, People's is great. The staff there are super friendly and the lunch buffet is a great deal.\n\nI tend to stick to several favorites on the vegetarian menu like the Vegetable Korma, Palak Paneer, and Matar Mushrooms. Their naan is super tasty as well.",4
2967,"First of all, a disclaimer. The only thing I have ever ordered here is the Pho Tai. I spent a semester in Vietnam eating Pho on an almost-daily basis, and now it is my comfort food, what I want when I am sick, tired, or sad.\nThat said, I can recommend the Pho Tai without hesitation. Out of the 3 Vietnamese restaurants I have been to in Pittsburgh (this, Vietnam's Pho, and My Ngoc), this has the best pho. The broth is quite good; fragrant and savory. \nI both eaten in here and gotten take-out. Eating in is a pleasant experience. The dining room is tiny but spotless and bright, and the free pots of tea are a nice touch. The take-out pho is packaged very thoroughly and intelligently. In a plastic tub goes the broth, beef and onions. The noodles are packaged separately in a little plastic bag so they don't get soggy before you have a chance to eat. All the fixings, including copious amounts of basil and bean sprouts, are there, including little tubs of hoisin and chili sauce.\nDelicious, authentic pho prepared by a friendly family. The only downside is the cash-only, which is a huge PITA.",4
2968,"This is my favorite type of restaurant, regardless of cuisine; namely, a family run institution with great food, friendly service and an almost complete disinterest in spiffing up the surroundings. Yes, Pho Minh is a bit divey, and I relish this quality. The pho is great, as are all of the dishes I've tried here. I also have a deep appreciation for restaurants that do one cuisine and do it well...none of this Thai/Vietnamese/Japanese combo that only serves to confuse the diner as well as, often, the kitchen. Between this place and Tram's down the street, Pho Minh is my favorite. Pittsburgh has a woeful dearth of good restaurants...I'll try not to go on too much about that in my reviews, as I don't want your eyes to glaze over...so this is a destination restaurant for us. There are very few things more satisfying than a deep bowl of pho on a cold winter day.",4
2969,"Tram's has better *ahem* \""atmosphere\"".  Pho Minh has better Pho.",4
2970,"I, straight up, love Pho Minh. This is one of those places that I would go to every day if I could. I love Vietnamese food, and have tried it in a fair number of cities. This was by far better than the best Vietnamese in Boston (Xinh Xinh) and a close second to the best Vietnamese in Seattle (Pho Bac). \n\nI found Pho Minh, sort of on accident, my first trip to Pittsburgh. The owners were very kind and attentive. The food was delicious, fresh, everything was clean. The pho broth was the best I've ever had, delicately spiced and flavorful. They don't pre-cook the beef, which is excellent, so it doesn't become too chewy (it cooks in the broth). The second time we went to Pho Minh was the first night we got to Pittsburgh when we moved (this should tell you how excited we were). Coming from Boston, it didn't occur to us that it might be closing at 9pm. We got there at 9:15pm and they kindly asked if we wanted them to make us up some food to go. Even that was good.\n\nWe kept hearing, over and over again, that Tram's was freaking fantastic and we should go there instead. So we did. It was a mistake. I have no idea what everyone is talking about. The ambiance? What ambiance? It smelled like urine. Seriously. \n\nNeedless to say, Pho Minh for life.",5
2971,"In sum, I very much enjoy this place. Hence the 4 stars. I probably order out from here 3-4 times a month. It is my 2nd most favorite Pho in Pittsburgh. I don't stray from my favorites dishes below, so I can't speak beyond what I will post. \n\nFor an appetizer, I order the Crispy Shrimp Rolls. Oh my! What little pieces of crispy, shrimp heaven. They are smaller shrimps, but the price is affordable so I don't mind. In my opinion what really drives this dish to excellence is the Vietnamese dipping sauce (nuoc cham). From what I learned about nuoc cham, every Vietnamese family has their own twist on it. The ingredients in nuoc cham are generally the same, but the proportions vary based on personal tastes and regions in Vietnam. According to Vietnamese cookbook author, Andrea Nguyen, \""as you move south the sauce gets sweeter, hotter, and more garlicky.\"" YUMMY!\n\nI thoroughly enjoy the Pho Meatball entree. I LOVE fresh herbs and spices. Pho rice noddles served along side crunchy and light bean sprouts. Fresh cilantro and basil. I consider myself a Pho Meatball amateur connoisseur of sorts. I only order this dish, no matter where I eat Pho at. I like the way they slice the meatballs at this establishment unlike other places. It makes it easier to grab with the chopsticks =) Also they have less grisley pieces in this meatball Pho. I've never dissected them, but assume it is part tripe. The flavor is moderate with the slightest hint of kick. Also the lemongrass in the soup broth is so amazing. It is the epitome of Vietnamese comfort foods in my opinion. Coupled with the addition of Sriracha chile sauce and Hoisin sauce they include on the side is amazing. \n\nThe staff are polite and quick. One never waits long for your food. It is a little disappointing that they open for dinner so late. It would be nice to grab something right when I get off work versus waiting for 5pm to roll around. However, I cannot deny that it is most definitely worth the wait! Oh and like others have said, they are NOT OPEN on TUESDAYS. Odd, I know.\n\nThere are two things to be mindful of 1. If you are dining in- your portion size of Pho will be larger. This is not just at this Vietnamese place it is pretty much the norm for the other Vietnamese places around the PGH area. 2. Cash only. This last one is a major pain to me. I am not the cash and carry type of person.",4
2972,"I am a big fan of Pho Minh, and I have eaten here more than a dozen times.  I love how the Pho is served with fresh Thai Basil and lime on the side.  The Pho is delicious, and perhaps the best in Pittsburgh.",4
2973,"The last review I read said Tram's has better atmosphere. Funny that I ended up at Pho Minh for the second time because Trams had kitchen violations and was shut down. Both times , the food was perfect. We started with the spring rolls, served cold with a nutty fish sauce - deelish. We then ordered the rice pancakes, which were loaded with shrimp and tofu. Lettuce cilantro and basil on the side, all fresh and graciously served. I tried spicy beef over lemongrass. The spice and citrus were a perfect combination. The portions are plentiful and all the entrees were priced under 9$. Highly recommended. One tip-they only take cash. Love this place and hope to add it to the regular rotation of Pgh dining!",4
2974,"Best place for pho in the city. I have tried them all and this is the one I always come back to for more. The woman who takes your order is quick and abrupt, but she is very friendly once you get to know her. I love the little old man who seats you when you come in the door, and serves you tea. You have to ask for water if you want it. I love the tofu in lemongrass curry as an appetizer. The sauce is so good I wish I could put it on everything. I usually get pho with chicken or the special\nSpicy soup. The ingredients are always so fresh and just taste so healthy. The food is very flavorful and perfect after a weekend of riding my snowboard. If you are looking for authentic pho then this is the place to go!",5
2975,"Occasionally, when we couldn't get to the Cat Clinic on Saw Mill Run, I've taken TaiChi Kitty to this location on Liberty.\n\nSame great vet service, same great staff that loves and cares for kitty cats.\n\nAlthough this location was a little out of our way, the parking (all street parking) was definitely better than the Saw Mill Run parking options.\n\nSix of one or a half dozen of the other.\n\nTaiChi Kitty was always satisfied, either way.  \n\n\""Just get me home momma!\""",5
2976,"This is a vet for cats, not a vet for people. This staff is going to do what is best for your cat, make recommendations for the benefit of your cat, and that may not always be the most convenient thing for you, as a human person. However, if you love your cat(s), this is the place to be. \n\nOne of my cats is extremely nervous in public situations, but always calms around the Dr. here. The doctor seems to talk to the cat in some secret mystical cat language. There is a real sense of cat community, from the portraits of the clinic's cats, to the bulletin board with cat-related notices, to the high-quality toys and treats for sale. \n\nAnother of our cats went to the great litterbox in the sky at this office. This is a horrible, difficult, awful thing to live through. I miss him terribly every day, even though it has been years. I am very grateful that the Cat Clinic & their wonderful staff was there for us. I am not sure that any other vet would have held me and said comforting things while I sobbed, taken phone calls from my friend, and provided such solid E for Effort. \n\nI have always felt like we have received the best possible service here. Even though they are a bit more expensive than \""budget\"" vets around town, the experience here has always been worth every penny. The peace of mind that comes from knowing you are doing the best by your pet is priceless to me. Cats don't have voices and cats can't make their own decisions about their health.",5
2977,"The food is great. The employees are friendly, helpful and curteous. The place is spotless- always. You can get a great hot lunch. The menu selection varies from day to day. But it's always very good. And they make frozen dinners you can take home and cook. Everything about this place is much better than Donatellis. What's not to love?",5
2978,"I consider myself a lucky girl to live in Pittsburgh's own Little Italy (although it has taken it's toll on my waist line, truth be told). Two separate and delicious family owned Italian grocery stores and countless amazing restaurants.\n\nGroceria Italiana is one of those quintessential corner stores that make you think of the way things may have been when your parents were young.\n\nIf you're one of those on the go-doing a million things at once types who rarely find the time to cook a meal, look no further than the hot food options they offer. It's that perfect delicious comfort food that these up coming autumn days.\n\nSkip out of work early and make a pit stop here on your way home, you'll thank me later.",5
2979,"Best Tiramisu ever! But a sub-standard attitude? I was flying to Florida to visit my sister and wanted to gift her the tiramisu. Reached the shop 15 minutes before closing time and was treated to rude customer service. I was told that the store generally closes earlier than the closing time as there is a lot of cleaning. Well I do sympathize with that, but I dont see that as a reason to deprive a fan of some divine Tiramisu!",4
2980,"What can I say about Groceria Italiana that hasn't already been said? \nPLEASE OPEN ANOTHER LOCATION! The south hills needs a place like this. If I didn't live so gosh darn far away, I'd be here multiple times a week. \nI stopped back to Groceria Italiana after a food tour in Bloomfield a few weeks ago to pick up a few things for dinner. I decided to purchase the special- sausage ravioli because the owner had informed us that everything is made in house. Even the suasage is ground and tested in house before putting into the ravioli. I also left with marinara sauce and pepperoni bread. \nThe pepperoni bread was light, fluffy and delicious. \nThe ravioli is easily the best ravioli I have ever had. Each little pocket of heaven was hand made and was slightly different in shape and size from each other. The tall tale sign that they were pressed by hand. We followed the directions on the box and BAKED (not boiled) them in sauce. I've literally thought about those ravioli every time I have had italian food since. If you are anywhere near this place, stop in immediately!",5
2981,My review will be short and sweet.  I AGREE with everything everybody had to say about this wonderful little Italian store in Bloomfield.  I hate grocery shopping (especially big store grocery shopping like Giant Eagle) but love to shop in this lovely little store.  Prepared foods are fantastic and the lunchmeats are always fresh and delicious.  I always manage to find everything I need here.  I am Italian and grew up with grocery stores just like this.  I feel like I am home every time I enter.,5
2982,"I love this place! So far I've been there twice for pepperoni rolls, once for pizza crust and pizza sauce, and another time to grab some frozen ravioli. Everything has been super tasty, especially the pepperoni rolls that everyone have been raving about. We got the prosciutto ravioli to cook at home and it was tasty! I would also recommend buying pizza crust here because it's super cheap and much better than any store bought crust. Some of the prices are high (I think it was $8 for ravioli), but you do get a good amount and everything is legit so I think it's worth it! They also have a meat/cheese counter and a small menu of hot prepared foods ready to go!",5
2983,"Years ago I discovered this quaint grocer and their awesome lunch counter. The meatball hoagie and weeding soup are seriously are amazing and authentic. I have not had better wedding soup in the city. I'm also in love with the homemade raviolis, (read the directions, these are baked not boiled.) My favorite is the artichoke gorgonzola, they are often sold out. If you're lucky enough, you'll get a chance to see the raviolis being made in action by one of the lovely pasta making ladies. Make certain to use the homemade sauce as well, we're talking heavenly good. Also, if you get there early enough, grab a warm, fresh Tuscan bread, (but maybe I shouldn't be telling you this.) it's crispy on the outside, and warm and soft on the inside. I dream of this bread. The deli counter is as well fantastic, get some meats and cheeses and have a banging sandwich. Anything you try from here is sure to keep you coming back for more!",5
2984,"This is a great PNC branch! Everyone is friendly, courteous, and knowledgeable about the services that they can offer.\n\nAsk for Maryanne. She's been with PNC for 35 years and is a real delight to work with.\n\nEvery time I walk in this branch, I feel proud to be a PNC client!",5
2985,"Love the fish sandwiches, they are all they are cracked up to be.  If you want lunch - try a sandwich here - but order ahead for pick up, or be prepared to wait 30 minutes or more in a shady looking bar.  The bar is very smoky, although it is also stocked with a soda machine if you get thirsty waiting for your sandwich to be made.   Although for a fish sandwich and fries you'll probably drop about $10, I think its definitely worth it.",4
2986,"There are two Indian restaurants pretty close to each other: Taste of India and People's. People's has better appetizers, and of course they have 1/2 off during certain hours, but Taste of India is better by far at entrees, and their masala tea is delicious. The nan is always hot, like hot hot, steaming hot, burn your hands hot, and perfectly done. \n\nChicken Tikka Masala leftovers are sitting in the fridge right now, calling my name. Everything is good and the portions are beyond generous. What is particularly striking is the pricing. Indian food in Orlando and DC tends to be expensive, and those are my frames of reference, but Taste of India is completely reasonable. Even bizarrely inexpensive considering the quality of the food you get.\n\nThe store front is odd, and the place never looks open, but don't be discouraged from going. Once you walk in you'll be seated quickly and served an onion and a mint chutney. Generally there is a young kid in the far back table playing on a computer or GameBoy.\n\nAt the end of the meal, your tip tray comes covered in an anise and sugar mixture with little pink, yellow, and white pellet things. I'm an addict, but always end up eating one pinch more than I ought, where the flavor becomes unappealing. And as much as I know this, I cannot help myself.",5
2987,"Love this place. And they have coupons too. The bonus is definitely the amount of food, you get enough for delicious lunch leftovers!",4
2988,"We ordered take-out from here through Meals Delivered and couldn't be more pleased.  The portions were large and flavorful, and it was a great value ($31 with delivery and tip for an aloo gobi, a chicken tikka masala, plenty of rice and 2 samosas).  I ordered the aloo gobi with a spice level of 5 and thought it was a touch too spicy, but other than that it was very good.  My boyfriend said that the chicken tikka masala was one of the best he's had.  The samosas are just the right size and delicious.\n\nWe will definitely be ordering from here again!",4
2989,"It's nice to know that there's decent Indian food that isn't far out in the boonies like Udipi (which, btw, is worth the trip).  I can't say I thought the restaurant aesthetics were that fantastic.  The acoustics in there are horrible, and it seems kind of dark.  But the service was nice, and the food is great.  Beware the stairs of death when you go to the bathroom.\n\nI haven't seen Chicken Muglai in years (they call it Muglai Korma on the menu) and the version they have is excellent.  We also had the sag paneer and a number of other dishes I can't even remember.  All I can recall is that I got my chicken muglai and it was GOOD.  The rest was good too.  I should also note that the portions are pretty large by Indian restaurant standards.  One dish goes a LONG way.\n\nThe nan is a little eh.  A little overcooked, in my estimation.  The garlic nan had lots of garlic on it but little garlic taste.  So, you get all the downside without any of the upside.  Too bad.\n\nIn any case, I will most definitely be coming back.  I",4
2990,"Great sauces, wonderful meats!!  The meat is always tender.  The prices are a little below average, which is nice.  I never get the buffet so nothing to say on that.  The nan was perfectly cooked.  The only problem is that they don't deliver.  Great!!  One of my favorite Indian places in Pittsburgh!",4
2991,"That woman that you see in the corner, a table full of food? Yeah - that's me. Don't judge....  I lose all ability to think rationally when I cross through the door. 4 entrees, biryani and a samosa? Yes. Why not? How can I possibly be expected to choose between such flavorful and reasonably priced food? It's the culinary equivalent of Sophie's Choice.\n\nThe staff is wonderful, the food is terrific - get the Samosas, saag paneer and dal makhni. Oh, and the tikka masala. And the muglai korma.\nOr you could do the lunch buffet and save your dignity. But then you wouldn't have leftovers for lunch. And - trust me - you'll want leftovers for lunch.",5
2992,"This place knocked me out.\n\nI had garlic naan and the lamb Shahajahani.  The sauce was so good, I used all the naan to sop it up.  (The waiter told me it was OK to do that.  Not sure if it really was, but I don't care.  I wasn't gonna leave any.)\n\nI travel a lot, and enjoy finding little places like this that are inconspicuous, where you can get great food, great service at a really decent price.  I had what I described above, plus a half-carafe of their house wine (not spectacular, but who cares) for $29, tip included.  And it was a good tip.\n\nThe server was very friendly and helpful and took time to help select the best choice for what I was in the mood for. And, he thanked me about six times for coming in, which was really refreshing.\n\nThis beats Indian I've had in Boston, New York and Berlin.  Will definitely be back on next trip to Pittsburgh.",5
2993,"Jordan & I have been eating Taste of India at CMU for a while, without knowing it was Taste of India.  At CMU they offer super inexpensive lunches that are more filling than anywhere else to eat at lunch. During this winter break, we have been going through some serious withdraw while the cafe is closed.\n\nThank you YELPERS once again, in our search to satiate our curry addiction, we have found our distributor!  We were excited to read that this restaurant supplied our weekly lunches and we ordered!!\n\nI ordered the Alu Matar Mushroom at a spicy rating of 3 (yes, I'm a sissy), but it was EXACTLY what I wanted!!  Jordan ordered Alu Gobhi which was cauliflower & potato at a spicy rating of 5.  We truly weren't sure how to scale our tolerance; but we decided that next time we could both go hotter.\n\nWe also can't wait to try the Lunch Buffet! We really wish we would have known that this existed during the week in between Christmas & New Years when we were fiending for Indian food.  Now that we know, I have no doubt we will soon become regulars.\n\nWe have also tried Tamarind in Oakland, but that place just made my mouth go numb after it was all said and done (and left me with an unpleasant digestion experience).  All of the bad cliche things you hear about Indian food, is nothing like Taste of India.  You can taste the love cooked in.",5
2994,"Darren brought me here, and as a Indian food n00b, I was impressed with everything included in the economical Dinner for Two which gets a diner nan, a meat dish, a veggie dish, dal, a dessert, and tea. The tea and kheer was a nice way to cap off the meal. The mango beef and alu palak were superb. I could live on the bread alone. They look to have renovated the place, and Darren said the bathrooms were much nicer this time around.",5
2995,"I might have just found my favorite Indian place. I went with two friends for a feast and we were not disappointed! We were greeted warmly and told we could sit anywhere.  The space is a little small, but that actually adds to the atmosphere of warm, delicious Indian food, friendly owners and staff, and good friends!\n\nI ordered the Malia Kofta for my entree.  These are vegetable balls with raisins and and almonds in a creamy sauce.  It was out of this world!!!  The veggie balls were slightly crispy on the edges but soft in the middle and packed full of flavor.  The sauce was not too creamy and the raisins added a sweet taste throughout.  Both of my friends have since gone back and ordered this!\n\nI wish I could remember what they ate, but this actually happened a few months ago.  I remember the Malia Kofta like it was yesterday, though!",5
2996,"This was my first time at taste of India. The service was very pleasant and I found the food and alcoholic beverages to be quite inexpensive. Most importantly, the food was fantastic. The flavors were well balanced and succulent. I will definitely be coming around more often.",5
2997,"Went for the lunch buffet which was about $8. It was SO good! I ate wayy too much but still wanted to eat more! Everything tasted so fresh and delicious! The decor was very tasteful, fresh and Indian inspired. The staff was wonderful too, very nice!",5
2998,"Writing this review for the all the Laaadies! Mr. B Had come to town for a visit and needed a trim in October. i had passed the Golden Razor on several occasions as it is in my neighborhood. I had a really good feeling about this place even before seeing the results it yielded.\n\nWe were out to run errands and walked inside. Two gentlemen were seated and a lovely man with a thick Italian accent told us he could fit Mr. B in after his next cut. The place reminded me of a small shop that would be located on a tiny street in Naples. One chair running constantly. Tom the barber is very busy and you can see that his clientele is very loyal. The appointment was quick and the atmosphere jolly. The topics of conversation revolving around Italy and current events. I felt like an interloper because I was probably one of the only chicks that ever goes in there. I could tell by the looks I got from the guys coming in. I just smiled and kept up the conversation with Tom and Mr. B. This cut was very simple but he shaped the hair just perfect and when we walked outside I gave Mr. B a kiss and told him he looked marvelous!\n\nOur second visit was mid February. Mr. B was trying to go a little longer with the his hair but it was just looking unkempt. I decided that I liked his hair a little bit on the longer side so after calling and securing an appointment this visit, Mr. B asked my opinion after sitting in the chair. I told Tom I preferred the hair a little more full and not such a close cut. He smiled and kept up a nice chatter with the both of us. A steady stream of calls and locals walking in to make appointments again made the atmosphere so pleasant.  \n\nThis Hair cut was especially fantastic. Mr. B had such a dapper look, I loved the cut and gave him a big hug and kiss then told him how handsome he was. The pricing is also extremely fair. I want to jump up in that chair myself instead of going to yet another salon. Tom also remembered us from our first visit and that is just good people skills! Love, love, love the Golden razor. \n\n* Cash only and give this man a proper tip",5
2999,"If there were an option to give an extra star for a \""special\"" experience, I would surely do so for Golden Razor. I must confess that I have a really thick beard and my stubble would surely light a match. Well but it did meet its match out here. The shave out here gives me a sense of hope against the injustice of my beard. Also I have been lucky to taste some home made lemoncello from the house of the master himself!",5
