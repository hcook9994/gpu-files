Don't waste your time.  We had two different people come to our house to give us estimates for a deck (one of them the OWNER).  Both times, we never heard from them.  Not a call, not the estimate, nothing.
Wast there last Friday. Seats right in front if the stage. The show was good. The headliner, while a bit long, was good. Fantastic service from our waitresses. Will definitely go back.
Great Barnes and Noble location, and they have plenty of books that'll help you pass the time.
Good. One of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh. Went yesterday with family and enjoyed oysters(very fresh). I always like appetizers more than their entrees
This place is amazing!!! Jim is a great artist!!! Traveled all the way from Tampa just to get my tattoo!!! I would recommend this place to everyone!!!
This cafe's espresso drinks are on par with the best artisinal coffee houses anywhere.  I always go out of my way to get coffee from here when I'm in Pittsburgh.
Wings are overpriced. And the quality of them are bad. They were tough and greasy. The staff are pleasant but then over all experience was too expensive for a sports bar.
The decor is nothing fancy but the food is surprisingly good (and fresh). I've gotten takeout and eaten at the buffet. Both good for the price - it's inexpensive.
right by my house, spicy peanut and cheesy snake are amazing.
Love this place! The decor inside is really cool.\n\nI'm not from the area but I try to stop in every time I'm traveling through. So many great veg options and great drinks.
Our favorite place to go for chocolate peanut butter soy milkshakes. We've been for breakfast, lunch, and dinner and everything we've gotten has been incredibly delicious. Love this place!
Refused to take my cat, which had passed away, for cremation cause I had not been to the clinic previously. IMHO that's ridiculous. I will not recommended anyone to ever come here.
The products and service are great, but the prices are outrageous!\n\nI am on a vegan diet and have found this co-op really helpful. If you can get past the prices, the selection is great!
For 30 bucks a month, this is a pretty rad spot. I've climbed all over the US and Canada, but I'm happy to call this my home gym.
Service was okay, at best. I wouldn't go there again.  They quoted me at thousands of dollars of repairs for my car to pass inspection.  I took it somewhere else and had it done for a fraction of the quote.
Maybe I went on a bad night, but the service was stunningly bad.  Water glasses stayed empty for almost 15 minutes!  Ordered 5 dishes, all pretty average.  The tab:  $300+.  I won't be back.
I am a big fan of Max;;s for their local flair, real German food, and authentic Pittsburgh feeling. They did not sell out, are not overly commercialized, and should be supported for the long standing quality service to the city. Thanks, Max's.
still the best (and for me, the only) professional football team in the world...
This conservative POS rag makes faux news look like NPR. You got Scaife, himself pumping ten million a year from his own pocket to keep the paper up and running. No one reads it, the Post Gazette is the REAL newspaper in this city.
Nick's used to be good with the previous owner, that all changed. Which is pretty sad.
Nick's has legit New York Style pizza.  It's dirt cheap too!
People and company make mistakes. \nThe owner personally took responsibility for the mistake and fixed the problem. \n\nThis shows they care about their customers and value the business!!
Tasty
Another ugly haircut like everywhere in Pittsburgh. For $60 with the owner. Trusted the reviews, but now look like a Pittsburgh redneck. No hair on the sides and long on the back!
Had lunch with my wife. The quality of the sushi was quite good. My wife had some tempura that was fabulous. Service was friendly and quick. We really enjoyed our lunch. We will be back.
Excellent and made from scratch !!!!
This was just bad pizza.  For the money I expect that the toppings will be cooked on the pizza.  The cheese and pepparoni were added after the crust came out.  Also the mushrooms were out of a can.  Do not waste money here.
Terrible place to eat and not very clean at all. Way over priced foe fast food. 5$ for a plain roast beef forget that!
Sadly really went downhill. They switched to a new vendor, the prices went up and they are no longer having sales.
The pizza is great. Other food items might disappoint. They do deliver! Service is hit and miss. There is one rude,  smile-less bartender... I have actually seen him through the window and decided to go somewhere else because I was in the mood for good service.
What a place. What a selection.  I love it.  \n\nThis place allows you to view hundreds of beers from around the world.  You can buy mixed six packs as well. \n\nThe food is great and service is just fine.
Grabbed a couple of dozen bagels and took to work.  Man they don't last long.  Bagels are good and the service is friendly.  They were real busy but make time to chat will working.
Awful!!!\nNever EVER follows schedule! Lets you wait for literally over an hour on a bus that is supposed to be running every 15 min.
There was basically no cheese on my \"cheese combo sandwich\", the fries were gross, and the waitress was nasty to us.
Bread, slaw, tomato, fries, and a small piece of overcooked fish all piled together. Warm yiengling and mediocre service.   Aweful
I love this place. I eat here anytime I go downtown for anything. Always get the Gyro with extra meat and sauce. So amazing. YUM!
Not the best ever, but pretty decent stuff.  A slice for $2.50 in downtown? I'll be back.
Ewww, the food here is terrible.  Nothing I had tasted good.  It tasted like it had been sitting under the food warmers for hours.  The service is luke warm at best.  Just skip it.  There's so many other places out there for good italian food.
Wonderful experience!
i have been getting my hair cut here for 15 years.  Marjorie is amazing and priceless.  I am as picky about my hairstylist as i am my dentist or doctor.  I travel extensively for work and get compliments no matter where i travel.  Wouldn't go anywhere else!
I have seen a lot of shows here.  It's really nice and brings some amazing productions to the city.  \n\n(and I also saw the Great Gatsby ballet that another commenter mentioned!)
This is the worst Chinese food I've had. Ever. And Pittsburgh has some pretty bad Chinese places.  The Golden Palace buffet is bad, but at least edible.  I am utterly baffled at how this place stays in business.
Pre-fab fried food. Decor has character. The beer is cheap.
Awesome chowder but that's it...
Update - went back another time and the pizza was mediocre at best.  So disappointing, we loved it the first time!  My guess is that if you get pizza right out of the oven you're good to go - otherwise, you're SOL.
I am in town for work and I decided to order food from here. The food was awesome! I ordered the People's Special Biryani and they brought the food right to my hotel room. I will definitely order from here again the next time I'm in town.
5:30pm, worst Baingan Bartha I've ever had. Un-fresh and damn near flavorless all but for some powdery heat. Please invest in fresh chillies; they keep well and will make that \"8\" really pop with flavor.
Pho is good but its not best pho or egg rolls (they don't even serve it with the lettuce and herbs) you can get in Pittsburgh. On the flip side though, their owner is super friendly
I am from Houston, since I came here I've been searching for the perfect bowl of pho. I have to say this is the closest thing yet from home!!! Good pho with fair pricing, doesn't get ebtter than this.
Flies in this place.
Yes the pizza is the best in the burgh.  But don't don't forget the wings.  They also have the best wings in the burgh.  They don't deliver.  They don't have to.  I'd drive for miles.
Other than being open late to convenience myself and my inebriated friends I didn't like nor dislike this place. It was quite small and looked dirty. The pizza was large enough to share between me and 5 people and to absorb some alcohol. \nIt wasn't horrible.
The sales team worked with me to trade a car that needed work and put me into the car I always wanted for a price I could afford.  Talk to Jeff and Dom they are Awesome!
Not quite as good as the Squirrel Hill location, but quick service. Would recommend the Sicilian Pizza over the usual style.
Not a huge fan of their coffee, the cookies and pastries are really good, however! The lemonade is amazing. The lady who works their, is super rude and never smiles. The customer almost feels like they are bothering the workers.
Cute place with a delicious cap! Perfectly proportionate.
Excellent food. They did a great job with the renovation- the place is swank!
Not my cup of tea. I did not like my tuna entree, despite it being somewhere around $35. \n\nI do enjoy their cocktails, and like to come to the bar for happy hour.
Consistently outstanding and creative food served professionally in a great and even varied ambiance. What more could you ask for? Oh yes, excellent wine list and drinks.
Best sushi in Pittsburgh. Small restaurant so definitely make reservations and try the omakase. Like the tatami mat seating as well.
Two Words: Frozen Cosmos\n\nYou need no other motivation to go to Harris' (although, the food and service is good too)
Very good short rib tacos. Long wait for food though.
I do admit the clothes here are not exactly at the quality that I want, but if you do stop by frequently you can spot some really nice items. And the guy who works there is super nice so make sure you get to know him! He can help you a lot.
Their appetizers are very very good... I also like their daily menu, fresh stuff and high quality ingredients. The salad that comes with any entree is awesome! Overall, excellent. I go there regularly. It usually gets very crowded though, so plan ahead.
Great hotcakes. No so great wait.  The hotcakes are worth trying, but there are other places in Pittsburgh that have much shorter waits that I prefer.
Nice cozy underground restaurant that serves crepes and a great Cafe au lait.  They have plenty of sweet crepes and a few savory ones.  They could add a couple more savory ones, but otherwise I would definitely eat there again.
Cash only. We love their Crepes. I don't like latta that much. It is good experience.
Cash only. Cute place, good crepes, good coffee.
I love their vegan / vegetarian menu! The food is so good! Just remember to ask them to hold the MSG! \n\nFriendly service. Clean. Nice atmosphere.
The owner stole a bracelet brought in for repairs and has lied over and over about returning it.
Always had great food, Try the clam chowder!!!
I love New China. The service is always fast and fresh! The sweet tea is amazing. Yes, Chinese takeout is everywhere but no one can Beat NEW China in Belmont!
They do take out and delivery! The pizza is tastier than most delivery places. The 10\" is a good size for an individual pizza. The staff was a lot of fun to chat with and answered any questions we had. We will definitely be getting food from them again.
Very good classic New York pizza. I would highly recommend it. If you want to get the best pizza possible make sure you order light sauce. They tend to over do the sauce sometimes but overall great pizza place.
I am a fan of the beer selection, and beer selection only- they have a great mix of really good German beer and seem to rotate it seasonally. As for the food, it's not fair for me to comment- I just don't care for German cuisine.
Closed, and has been for a long time now.  Last visit garnered a first bucket of stale peanuts which the waitress knew we were going to say yet served them anyway before providing more.  An average steakhouse.
I used to be in the industry and I know what my car does and does not need.  They couldn't seem to get that, and kept trying to sell me crap.  Over-priced, slow, very dirty, and an overall sketchy vibe.
First class everything,  service incredible. Great hidden gem in the heart of Charlotte.  I recommend staying.
Authentic Irish feel with a friendly staff and warm atmosphere. Expected selection of draft beers for an Irish Pub. Good selection of bottled beers.
Lights too low, music too loud, not many people inside, drinks too expensive. Plus it costs 5$ just to get in. Def not worth it. Try some where else!
not thrilling, not disappointing.  RB is average across the board.  Try the Hazelnut Crusted Chicken.
one extra star because they are consistent, well priced and chicken tempura and chicken teriyaki are tastey. this is my go to spot when i want something cheap and \"asian\"
Ok but not fabulous-decor in room was bland.  Quiet with all the things a business traveler could want including business center where you can print out your boarding pass for free.  Great view of uptown and very comfortable beds.
A few of us went here for lunch on a Friday and while the food was very good the service was very slow and inattentive.   \n\nI had the Blue Petit Mignon and the portion size was just right for lunch.
I've eaten at Merts a few times and even received a free birthday meal which included a drink. Very impressed. My favorite dishes are the salmon cakes and the rice and beans with turkey sausage but that dish tends to be too salty at times. Overall, nice place to eat.
I liked the atmosphere but the food was WAY too salty.  Just didn't care for it.
Had dinner last night here. The food left a lot to be desired. Reputation aside the salmon cakes had no seasoning and the ribeye was tough. Really disappointing. I've been here before when I come to Charlotte and had better food. Hopefully, this was a one-off.
Only went there during happy hour. There was a great drink selection, but it was so crowded the service was not great.
I had a great meal with friends had drinks they had all we wanted! The staff was great not rude like the kings kitchen the food was great! thank you so very much! I shall keep coming back! Come here leave the kings kitchen food is great looks great staff out of this world!
The steak was cooked to perfection  .  Staff  is very friendly. Nice place to hang out.
Great Turkey Grinder!
Drink prices are high but the dancing is fun!
this place is fun because it is on the light rail line.   things here do tend to be expensive, but i will say the sushi is yummy and normally priced.  the tizerts cakes are so delish i would eat them until i died.
Don't eat anything but the chicken. Everything else is nasty. Charlotte should be a BBQ mecca, it isn't because of the chains. Go back to Florida, they like it there.
Ride the Intimidator. Some say to visit the great wall of China before you die...I say tide the Intimidator.
Small park, over priced food, we paid $55 for 3 slices of pizza , 2 orders of chicken wings that were the smallest flavorless wings we have ever had, and 2 beers.....never again....pack food
This ymca is very large.  It has 4 floors to exercise.  Like 10 racket ball rooms.  Towel and rags are ease of access to shower and etc.  The downside is that most hours of the day it is crowded because it is located downtown.
Solid sake menu and the staff was helpful in deciding which one to go with. Sushi rolls had an interesting spin but nothing out of the ordinary.
Food was terrible service was ok. We were told it would be a 30-45 minute wait and it turned into an hour and a half wait. Totally not worth it.
One of my favorites.  The food and service are always excellent.   Whatever you have, ending with the bread pudding (not listed on the menu) and the tiramisu are a must!!!!
Horrible customer service. Unless you are into horror movies or The Simpsons the people working the counter can't give you a honest review. However they will make fun of your movie selections and treat you like crap. Can't wait to go back!!
I've been going to the Visulite since it opened.  It's my favorite live music venue in Charlotte.  So many great bands have hit this stage.  Most of the staff have worked here since the beginning.  Great atmosphere.  Many wonderful memories!
Best sushi I have had in Charlotte!
Delicious, good service, one of our favorites places to eat.\n\nHighly recommend the sesame tofu - it is some of the best tofu I've ever had at a restaurant.
They serve THE BEST roti canai!! MUST EAT!! Highly recommendeddddddddddddddddddddddddd!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I have ordered hot subs and for some reason they don't understand that not everyone wants white american. I gave them two chances and they haven't gotten it right yet! I will go to Sub Station across the street from now on!
My man does it again.  Have taken 5 jackets to him now to tailor.  He has advised me on brands to buy that fit my build, told me to pass on tailoring pieces that will never fit me correctly, and repeatedly deliver quality work.  Highly recommend.
One oft favorite joints in Charlotte. Between the jazz band, etoufee, and shrimp& grits this place takes the cake.
What a pleasant surprise!! The fried oysters are the best ever and so is the Diane! I had it with the crawfish and shrimp. Even the garden salad was good to be pretty simple! Definitely a great value! My family and I will be returning:)
The have some of the best ribs and rib tips in Charlotte. Tea and lemonade made fresh.
All I have to say is Hayley is very talented. I had a great experience here, you may need to be patient. I took me about 3 months to get in to see her, but was well worth the wait.
Wonderful food and shopping available, but why does the restroom have a valet in it taking tips?  This isn't a European nightclub.
I was at this airport for a few mins as I connected. Would have liked to enjoy my supposedly one hour layover but my previous flight at LAX was delayed for no reason.
@ Charlotte and ready for boarding!!
Basically the totally opposite of Newark Liberty Airport.\n\nClean and well-lit. Friendly and courteous TSA members, and fast and efficient layout and service.
Huge airport.  Clean and lots of shopping.
One of the best US Airways hub airports.
They are in the middle of revamping the parking near the terminals.  Easy peasy airport.  The food options are lacking, but I imagine they will fix that eventually.  How about some of that well known NC BBQ in the terminals??
Decent airport, but it is always a mass of humanity.  Be sure to stay in your seat if you get one, because you will lose it.
It's an airport, small but had what it needed. Planes.
Standard place that grew fast and has lots of spider webs.
I have never been to an airport before where I would want to come back and just hang out. Get my nails done? Check! Superb southern food? Check! Legit shopping? Check and check!
Went there 6 in the morning. It's just like any McDonald's, you should know what they serve. The staff is very friendly and helpful.
I can't anymore. It's too busy here and service is not as fast as other Mickey D's with this kind of volume. Customers are rude too.
Not too good and not that much flavor for what chicken can have.  The sauce is nothing special and as one reviewer said, the neighborhood is suspect.  Service was good and I liked the potato salad.  Baked beans were from the can.  Drive up was good and service was super fast.
This place is as bland as they get. The food was mediocre and the atmosphere was too.
I gave up on Monterrey several yrs ago but was in the neighborhood today. I felt like Mexican for lunch. Clean, great service and the food was very good. One of the best quesadillas I've had. And the Dos Equis draft wasn't bad either!
I visit often.  Love the white salsa, great food, good prices.
It seems a rarity to find a Japanese restaurant owned and operated by Japanese. Well Musashi is one such place. The menu is not the Americanized and that is worth three stars alone. Good authentic menu, service and food!
After having a bad experience and informing the management, Dean and Deluca went above and beyond in improving my perception of the market.  Way to go!
This has always been awesome place on my list of places to shop or have a sandwich went recently and had a fantastic lunch.
Delicious Chinese food!  I had the Trio of shrimp, scallops & chicken and all food was very fresh and wasn't salty like other Chinese restaurants.  The servers were very  polite and this was a wonderful experience and will definitely go back!
Wish it had been better when I made my one and only trip.  The menu was smallish and nothing quite appealed to me.  But I know others have enjoyed it very much, maybe I am an exception.  I like the wine suggestion it was top notch.  Staff was efficient and friendly.
A very ratchet place with a very ratchet staff.
I always come here after playing a round of Par 3 golf next door.  How can you go wrong with hundreds of beers, pretty girls and descent bar food?  You can't!  Cool spot - check it out!
Good food and drinks before going to a concert at the verizon wireless amphitheatre up the street. ~Cheers
Friendliest employees ever, and those hamburgers are fantastic!  Food quality is what I'd expect at a good sit-down restaurant.
Visiting friends in NC and we stopped here for breakfast. At first our order was take out but then we decided to eat in. They got out order wrong but was friendly in fixing the error. The food was okay for the items that we got.
Great specials averaging around $7.  The portions are extra large.  Large seating area.  This is your typical quick Japanese style stir fry.  Teriyaki and Hibachi stuff!   One thing that sucks - No egg rolls!  WTF?
Awful awful awful!!!!  I have never experienced such RUDE nurses or doctor in my life. I will never go back here again. I'm not sure how they have received positive reviews.
session key
this place never disappoints me. Tough to get in, reservations are a must but always delicious.
Casual dinner with members tonight and food was great! Service was inexperienced.  Always love the location and people!
The atmosphere here is comfortable and attractive.  The service is above average.  The lunch specials are quite appealing, and the food itself is pretty tasty.
I haven't been back here in years. The food is mediocre at best. Head to Monterrey's.
Restaurant is closed.
I liked it bc of the coupons but it is now closed they informed me by email.
Good subs and cheesesteaks. Slammed at lunch. Clean. Plentiful parking.
Just went for sushi. Superman roll was good. Overall I would prefer Pisces or Ru Sans, but this place was nearby and it did the job. Service was also good although it wasn't busy at the time.
Terrible. Ugly d\u00e9cor, bad food, poor service.
The worst Macaroni Grill I've ever been to!  Do not waste your time!!!
Probably the driest and most tasteless chicken salad I've had in a long time. Our other sandwiches were just as disappointing. Just another chain food restaurant. I long for a real deli in Charlotte!
I don't even have the words!  Don't even have an app to order if you send an update that the food is out for delivery but I have to call every 20 min wondering where it is
This has been a great experience for my kids. Sean and his staff are amazing. Can't say enough about his teaching and ability to relate to younger kids.
I made it to the top- that's all that matters!\n\nLove this place.
I was down in Charlotte on business for five days and I ate here four of those days for lunch.  NEED I SAY MORE?
Great lunch spot. To repeat other reviews, the service is fast; probably the quickest I have ever experienced. As with most other locations I have visited, the staff is genuine and friendly.
Two words.  Dirty and nasty. Better off driving 3 miles to the Steele creek McDonalds!
Location is perfect view to the lake but services pretty slow, food average a place to get a beer and see the lake ......
Great little place just across the border.  Food is always great as well as service.
Food was very good. I had the Reuben sandwich. My only suggestion is that the waitress should check back more often to see if we need anything. Otherwise, I recommend it.
Ate here once with a buy one, get one coupon. I won't be heading back. Go to Los Gemelos off of State St instead.
As always excellent, locally sourced food.
We tried to order for delivery because we are 4 miles away. On their menu it says $15 minimum. We called to place the order and we were told today it's a $75 minimum. We found that insane so never ordered.
if you're looking for a nice night out, keep looking...
First we waited 20 minutes which was ok with us but then we waited 45 minutes for our two items to show up that too incomplete. As one of the reviewers mentioned the breakfast was very oily. Taste was just ok. Won't be going back.
Go soft and juicy burgers!  I dream and crave these burgers.  Basic cheese burger with pickles and they special mustard.
Delicious pork sandwich with coleslaw and very attentive service at modest prices in a rustic atmosphere
Great food, portions could be smaller. A little pricey for Middleton. Would try somewhere else next time but would also not hesitate to return.
The wait staff were non-existent, the food was atrocious, the mixed drinks weren't drinkable, and the atmosphere was filthy. What more can I say? Ick.
Wow.  What a bunch of stoners.
I love the root beer ! Service and atmosphere was cafeteria-like, food was average. Chicken strips and cheese curds were good.
Love everything about this place! My family has been ordering carry out from here for at least 10 years. It's the best Chinese on this side of town. The lo mein rocks!
Corp store on Lien rd was not a good choice.  The manager of the store was very unhelpful and gave me the run around about trying to fix my phone. If you want good service with people who actually care, go to the store on University Ave
terrible selection of shoes and jeans, and the changing rooms smell like a red line el stop. if you absolutely must visit a department store, drive a few miles and hit up macy's instead.
Worst security at any venue I have ever experienced and way overpriced drinks. $9 for a double? Fuck that noise. Security goes through literally all of your stuff at the door, I've been through airports with hassle.
Grade: C\n\nChain food. Okay service. I can't explain why I don't hate this place.
It's a national chain so you pretty much get what you'd expect. I have never had problems with the service and the food is always good.
Too institutional.  Out of a can, bag, box, or freezer.  Parking is very limited.  Not a fan.
Neighborhood delivery and takeout great....certainly a step higher than the other chains in this level.\nThey don't biast 30
Friendly staff and quick service but, unfortunately they couldn't make up for the unappetizing dining room and BLAND food.  I'll  be shopping around for another Chinese place.
Yucky greasy food.
Sweet potato hash is fantastic!  The tofu scramble has a bit of a spicy kick and is a great option for vegans.  In fact, their veg dishes are just plain good. Service is very friendly and their cheesecake is very creamy and delicious.
Slightly lower than average Hampton Inn.  Heat/AC wasn't updated, pretty typical besides that.
I love the Ohio.  It's the kind of hellhole where you can watch a prostitute sing \"like a virgin\" on karaoke night, and see old dudes in satin jackets with bar logos on them get in fights.\n\nClassy.
N E W   S E A T S !!!!  The old bench were terrible and kept us away.  We spent two games this year and we are hooked.
Really beautiful place. Must go see - herb garden - TOUCH N FEEL was really good. Otherwise really big place and definitely can cater to an event. Thai Garden was also good.
Pretty impressive landscaping, floral and fauna display. Free admission, but I suggest spending the extra $2 and visit the conservatory whi check has butterflies and a few birds.
DO NOT EAT HERE.  They changed my tip and charged me $28 for lunch.  Absolutely ridiculous.
I read the new ass't governor gave a speech there invoking God.  Please, spare me, now I will pass.\n\nPlease save that shit for church.  The rest of us will pass on this crap.
Poor service by the wait staff is my biggest complaint. We were there at 5:00 (and it wasn't busy yet), and it took probably 15 minutes to place our order. \n\nFinally, $16.95 for a fish fry. Yowzers!
Grade: D\n\nYeah, I order my martinis served on the rocks and in goblets... Duh.
The Korean tacos are not half bad, and the kid really likes the burgers.
Best BBQ in Madison.  Hands down.  Only loses a star for consistently messing up take-out orders and not being up to par compared to places in the south.
The ribs, you must try them! My major mistake was getting a 1/3 slab.
Worst service ever.  No one cares, was lied to, wasted my time, twice and ended up demanding a refund and taking business elsewhere.  NEVER AGAIN.
You will never go away hungry...and your wallet will not be much lighter.  Good food, good prices and wonderful staff.
This location used to be an absolute hole.  They recently renovated both the interior and the exterior, and now it's a very pleasant, good-looking store.\n\nHowever, it's still Wendy's food.  And that's only okay.
Sloooooowwwwwwwww. Couldn't believe how long it took to be served below mediocre food.
Typical burger and beer place.  Food is pretty good.  Service was great!
The best fast food I know of. Maybe Chipotle, as well. Staff is always friendly. I'm not from here but this place is very Wisconsin-y to me, in a food way.\n\nGood chili.
Mediocre sushi, that is priced above what it should be at.
Great bread!  But I wish the sandwiches were a little bigger.  I got the wheat sub roll with meal deal and it disappeared too quickly...left me hungry!  I guess I'll try the french bread next time.  Maybe it's a little bigger.
MTD is a great way to get to class when the weather is nasty.  However, the buses are often late, so be sure to choose a bus that arrives to your destination a few minutes early.  At least the MTD buses are free to students.
Can't go wrong with Brothers. Large airy bar that seems to be a great place to catch a game. Not as good as the Iowa location, but worth checking out.
generally okay place, a little overpriced for the settings:(  noisy and place is too small, not looking very neat... food portion is below average. maybe not again.
Boo notes and quotes for raising prices tenfold just b/c they were making illegal copies. No one should pay $150 for 100 pages of paper.
Called from marketplace mall area... When i told the girl on the phone, she said that I was serviced by a different location and that they were closed.  Then she hung up on me without as much as a goodbye.  Wow... No effort to satisfy a customer at all.
I really love chinese food but this place was absolutely horrible. I tried two dishes but both of them tasted real bad and smelled weird as well. Never go here. They have the worst food in entire Urbana-Champaign area.
Went with a friend and got a Bento box (Salmon teriyaki).  Food was good, but the place is a bit far from campus.  I'm not a fan of Miso soup, but the rest of my meal was good.
I got Sam's French Toast with a side of eggs and the eggs were fine but the french toast mostly tasted of everything else that was on the grill. I think if there were separate grills for meat vs other items it would've been better. Friendly service though.
Very good soup and fish dishes.
Daily special number 1 is the way to go! It comes with half a mackerel, and a decent bowl of tofu soup. The mackerel can be dry at times though. The kimchi jjigae has a large portion and tastes good too.
We try and go there for the best fish sandwich in town ! Be sure and order the beer batter onion rings also. A quaint Illini sports bar with a nice atmosphere and  easy access. A pay parking lot is right next door.
Ok beer selection, ok bar food (though I am a bit of a beer/food snob).  I don't mind going when a group wants to go, but not my first choice if I'm out on my own.
This guy really knows what he is doing.  I always feel better when I leave!
Nice mall great stores and food court but they need more seating for people.
Great atmosphere, delicious coffee, awesome food. This is my default stop for coffee or a place to spend the afternoon. It can get a little crowded at times though.\n\nThe Thai Tempeh sandwhich is amazing, also try the cold brew coffee sometime.
Wanted Thai while on Champaign for work. Tried this place and it was good but very small portions. So much so that I had to get taco bell fourth meal 3 hours later.
I've had good luck selling stuff here, but none when it comes to buying things. I just feel like everything here is either tacky, terribly made, or just an old trend. I definitely have better luck at TJ Maxx for sure.
This place is only good for picking up dumb underage girls.  Not worth it.
Excellent pizza (full disclosure: I was a cook here) and decent beer selection. The pool tables make it difficult to socialize at time,  the bar space is too long and not wide enough. However, if you like pool, these are very good tables.
worth the half off tues. guys... real cheese in those shakers. nuff said.
I am from Dallas and in Champaign for business.  I looked at Yelp for suggestions on good places to eat and Bacaro seemed to be the place to go.  I thought it was great.  Unique tasty dishes!
By far our favorite spot we've eaten at so far in Champaign. Our server was a little strange - definitely new to the job - but the food was excellent and the service was completely reasonable. Very large beer selection as well. Highly recommend - we'll be back!!
Amazing frozen custard. I like to stick to the basics -- vanilla or chocolate on a waffle cone. The stuff is just great.
simply fantastic, been here 4 days straight since they opened, the lemon custard is amazing in their banana splits. i would go EVERY DAY.
Seasonal place that is always a favorite. A bit off campus but worth the drive.\n\nTake your friends here when it's hot and you'll be guaranteed thanks all night.
Who doesn't love lemon custard?  So refreshing!  And really great in a lemon chiffon snowstorm.  The only negative is the long lines - but still worth it!
Pizza is great if you enjoy thin crust. Other menu items are good as well.  The service consistently sucks!  It's horrible!  Every time, service is absolutely horrendous. Proceed with caution.
The pizza wasn't horrible,  but the deal was awful.  The prices are extremely high at Dominos in general,  and their medium 2 topping is a rip off.  Low rating is for price vs.  Quality,  and value.
The food here is absolutely delicious! I would highly recommend their thai green curry (has a nice spicy kick to it), and the pad thai is worth a try as well. Unfortunately, the service is incredibly, incredibly slow.
Accommodating to gluten free needs. Fish tacos, chips, & salsa were great. Service excellent.  Also liked the complimentary chocolate tamale dessert.
If you come here to dine in close to closing time DO NOT sit in the back section or you will get scolded by the Latina hussie behind the counter.
Good for only one visit.  Very overpriced
The food is overpriced and so are the drinks. The atmosphere is not casual and the place is not very inviting. The hostess was not friendly and neither was the staff inside. I did not enjoy coming to this place and I don't think I'll be returning.
This is never a bad spot no matter the time of day. Seriously.
This place does not even deserve one star. The place was dirty and the service stunk.
It's so, so mexican food. My husband loves it- I think it's a bit greasy. La Canasta on 7th St is way, way better. The salsa they put on the table is a little too hot for my taste as well.
AWESOME. \n\nAnd sometimes when it's really busy, they take you to magical rooms of the building that you don't even know exist for extra seating. \n\nBut really everything is good here.
We saw Mary Poppins and three generations of us loved it- the show stealing was accomplished by the ensemble cast with this one. The star roles were also awesome but the ensemble scenes blew me away.
It was OK. A Mexican restaurant without con queso is crazy! Food was average at best. Service was good and the strawberry margarita was good but the food was not impressive.
Stay away from this hooters. Bad food, bad service. Bleh!
They seem to be declining over recent years but the Mizithra is so good we went back anyway.  Appetizer flatbread was fair.  Chicken parm was fair.  Mizithra was great.
Decent burger, good salads but really high prices for the quality...probably because of the location.  Nice outdoor seating area.
They also messed with my side mirror and gave me a huge blind spot which I didn't notice until driving!
Good food, quick service. Kinda pricey for the brown bag crowd. Great tea!
Awesome staff, great food and cool decor
I really dint care for this place. the music was blah and the out door seating was lame.The only cool thing i saw was the big unit. A home wrecking size weenie some old man was trying to deep throat.
Check out my blog review and photos:\n\nhttp://food-tales-and-other-fun.tumblr.com/post/24344649924/
The food was really unimpressive, especially for the prices. The Michael Bible cocktail was pretty good.
Cheap and fast -express !! - delicious hummus and taromasalata , the burgers weren't bad ,  a convenient location for where I was working - myself and colleagues had around fifteen meals here in the space of a week , - nothing wrong with any of them.
My husband and I attended the yelp sponsored date night at the Arizona Science Center. We had a blast checking out all the hands-on exhibits as well as the planetarium. The Van Gogh Alive! was an excellent immersive multimedia mix of art, music, and quotes.
This place has gone down hill. What used to be in the normal exhibits are now in a paid exhibit hall. It's sad that they have resorted to that to make money. I won't be renewing my membership.
I write this as I sit awaiting for my food.  I've been waiting for an hour now.  At a table with 10 other people, and the food is brought out 1 or 2 at a time.  This will be my last visit.
Came here for the menudo. Chips were hot and fresh tasting. Red menudo has a good taste. I still think Caramba's in downtown Glendale has the best menudo although this one is right up there. B-
Really good menudo and salsa and fresh chips are a must .. The prices are great and the food is real mexican home cooked meals ...
2 stars. Only cause the drink prices are good.
Every time I go to Whataburger, I get chicken strips. It is the only place I can think of that gives you a piece of toast with your meal.
I don't know what everyone else on here is talking about; this Whataburger is super fast!  The entire drive thru process took a grand total of four minutes.  Great place to stop for a quick lunch when you work downtown.
Disney Land for Foodies. Fresh Baked Goods, Salsas, Mexican dishes (the torta cubana is to die for) and an awesome atmosphere, plus more produce than the human eye should ever behold. My favorite place in Phoenix.
Lite lunch with the ladies.  Two of us shared Crab Cakes and Caprese salad.  I could have eaten an entire platter full of the crab cakes.
Expensive and just ok.
great place and atmosphere, great ice cream and malts.
The Best Bean Burro Enchilada Style EVER!!
Absolutely fabulous!  Why do so many people fixate on the location?  The food was super delicious, Mexican + seafood, where could things go wrong.
Should have known better than to eat in a place so dark that you can't see the food on your plate. Underwhelming and overpriced.
Love the Chihuly Art throughout the gardens, I was bummed that the cafe was closed. It's definitely a great walk this great scenery! Lovely for photos!
What a wonderful place to visit. Especially at night during the holidays. This past holiday season the Chihuly exhibit was magical. Treat yourself and go.
Loved this place.  The service was great, the restaurant was spotless, the food was really great and it was very affordable.  The Pupusa's were amazing!  I also loved their mango iced tea and the desserts were really tasty as well.
Shortly after posting this review someone from Pep Boys requested I email them about the situation at hand. Would you guess I received NO response?! What a crock. Save yourself and do not bring your car to a Pep Boys Service Center!
Avoid the lunch buffet.  Excellent Chicken Tikka Masala.
Decent. The dishes are somewhat bland and seem to be not quite as authentic as I have had in the past. The curry was ok and the tikka masala, well Ive had better. The buffet is above average and as always the Naan was wonderful!
Really great staff - friendly and professional. But the facility is beat. Rugs stained, wanted to wear flip flops in my room. Towels scratchy. They need to raze it and start over.
Above average BBQ at a resonable price.  Large portions.
Must have been an off day but still pretty good. Better luck next time!
I've been going to this particular one since 1987.  It was a ritual to go there right after the Copper World race, Indy car race and  the races at Manzanita.  Great food, great portions and great atmosphere.
The food wasn't very tasty. The bathrooms will make you leave and not even ask for your money back.
This zoo is amazing. I love that they have two splash zones. Please make sure to have your kids bring water appropriate clothes to play in. The barn and petting area is my daughters favorite place to check out!
ok food...def not thing worth driving more than 5 minutes to... i paid $6 for a burrito and a soda..not expensive but a 3 bite burrito shouldnt be 5 bucks..
Unfortunately, this place is on a downward trajectory it appears. Many businesses have closed and there are many vacancies. The ones that are there, apart from the Asian Market have changed hands. Not bad, but not worth a special trip.
Kungpao chicken is the best iv ever had!\n\nFood is great, they are fast, and friendly. \n\nI love this place!
The staff is nice .... Tables never seem to be clean and treys the beef brisket was great except for the bread
Good food\nFriendly service (only if they are not busy)\nI mainly go here for the appetizers and beer during happy hour
Good place.  Friendly staff.  It has a nice little bar with a few TV's to watch the game, which is a lot to ask in Midtown Phoenix. :)
Always a great meal, tomato moz sandwich amazing, focia pizza amazing
Super cute spot with the freshest of the fresh ingredients. Tasty sandwiches and salads. Fast and friendly service. Adorable country farm feel. What's not to love?
The best place in town to watch European football (soccer for locals). I would rate it with 5 stars but the food is just tasteless, so think about watching football and having drinks there only.
Enjoyed the fish and chips. The fish flaky, thick cut, with a thin crispy batter. The chips... a little to soft. Overall pretty good. Looks like a great place to catch a soccer game. English style food.
Horrible service, horrible attitudes. I created a yelp account to write this review. Absolutely rude and incredibly expensive.
i love this applebee's !!!! everyone is super friendly!  for dessert i recommend getting the blondie! so yummy
The Salt and Pepper flounder is amazing.  The egg drop soup is amazing as well.
The orange chicken and house rice were perfect together.  We added in a pork dish and it was a great combo.  They seated us quickly and had our drinks out right away.  The server checked on us consistently but wasn't annoying!
I just paid $20 for two drinks.  This place is delicious and healthy but the price is absolutely ridiculous.  The kale isn't fresh it's frozen. The drinks are good but not worth the price. Just juice at home or go to a neighborhood market.
Rip . off.  Thief People Up In There.
Used to be a serviceable record store but has become a shell of its former self.  OVERPRICED lps and the selection is almost the same as it was 10 years ago.  I am an avid collector and really find no reason to go here anymore.
Very upset this place has closed. Please come back! One of the few places in town where you can get healthy take-out.
I like this location.  They have a lot of turnover, but for the most part everyone has been pretty good.  Wish the outside tables were cleaned more often.  They are too dirty 90% of the time to use.
Good stuff.  Haven't had too much of the food.  Onion rings are delicious.  All beers delicious.  Good joint to grab a growler for the drive home...I mean for when you get home.
Delicious, finely crafted beer! Good food and friendly staff.
Average beer... Great food.
If you're into great craft beer, don't waste your time here. The cask conditioned IPA tastes like dish water. Food was average. Meh.
Been here before to skate and its very nice, friendly, and not crowded by any means :)
I won't lie, I've been here once or twice.  Not on par with Canadian clubs but much better than the other clubs in the valley.
This is the only place I go when I need greeting cards. The store has a wonderful assortment of gifts and seasonal items. The women who work there treat you like family.
This place is awesome!!  been going here for years the # 1 is the way to go red chili is amazing
Second try:\n\nSo I am updating my review! Received the giftcard and went ahead and tried it again ( dinned in this time around ) it was PERFECTION.  We'll go back for sure!
I Love Oregano's, but this specific location is terrible.  The food is not prepared as well as the other locations.  Very Very dissapointed
Excellent waiters, nice and clean tables and floor. Good food portions.decent prices. Food is delicious and fresh. Beer was excellent .
Amazing that a cafe like this can do great sushi, Italian pasta, and ramen!  Try the low carb soy noodles in your Italian dish.  Good stuff.
LOOOOVE this place!! PAD Thai is delicious :)
Not the best country club I have ever golfed at, but pretty nice all the same.  The course itself is well maintained, though it was aerated recently.  Customer service is obviously touted here and it shows throughout the entire facility.  I had a nice experience and will definitely be back soon.
The music was good.  The beer was warm.  Wheat beer served warm can contain bacteria.  The person I was with and myself were both sick for three days.
LOVE going to the eye doctor now!  They can get me in and out in no time.  Extremely friendly staff!
I pass by this walgreens on the way home so I stop in frequently. Always able to find what I need. Clean and organized, will come again.
Be prepared to be upset it is gone has been for several years now.
Went back to Volvo Am I for a maintenance check, and the second visit was as positive as the first.  Volvo Am I Fane
Great place, not a lot of parking.  We ordered a pizza and chicken parm.  It was really good food and the service was great.  We will be visiting this place again!
Excellent pizza and great service.  The Mediterranean Pizza and Moscato wine both get 5 stars.
This place is as bad to be expected! \n\nEssentially a warehouse stuffed with random fabric scraps, ribbon and assorted accessories. \n\nTo be honest, you better come here on a scavenger hunt, or else you will be disappointed!
Genny's is a hoot! I'm def Straight but NOT narrow.
Dennys has changed their delicious chicken fried steak to a formed meat product brick \nEPIC FAIL!!!!!!
I can almost always find something fan-fuckin-tastic for less than half the price it'd be in it's original store.
Unique food, great atmosphere, pricey but worth a trip for special occasions.
Shrimp Tacos Morongos.  There may be no better shrimp taco on this side of the border.
when you walk in its old school which is cool and the outside is cool but the food was medioca just a bit i would not give the a second shot now a different location maybe...
Decent for the money, but not spectacular. Wings were overcooked and dry. \n\nThe western bacon burger was decent. Bread was good.
It's not the easiest place to find your way around but Robert was EXtremely helpful!! my experience a little more pleasant.
THey have the best chicken fried steak that I have ever had!!! There daily specials are amazing as well!!
We got take out from here during a spring break trip. Noodles, sushi, edamame, popcorn shrimp. All delicious. I ate the leftover noodles, cold, for breakfast, the next morning.
love love moto fresh fish cool atmosphere must try this hip mod place.  The noodles are out of this world and the sushi is the best in this part of town. Be prepared for a long wait this place is popular.
Meat has decreased in quality over last couple of years. Lukes, step up your game.
Great service and prices. This is where I buy my water because its the cheapest in phoenix (even the Catalina). Fish are also healthy
I've gotten several very nice pedicures at DV.  The place isn't fancy but it's clean, the staff is friendly, and they offer good prices.
The New York Sirloin was cooked well, but it was pretty tough. The online menu said they had prime rib, which is why we came, but they don't even sell it. Our server Bryan was very good
Went here several weeks ago. My one complaint is that it is TOO dark. The food was okay, nothing special. The staff was wonderful and very attentive.
Loved.This.Place. Awesome candlelit ambience, spacious seating options, and friendly service.  Well-sorted menu with vegetarian and seafood options (yay me). Deschutes Brewery Porter. Affordable price point.
greeter which is basically security was the coolest dude there, they have hardly any wireless routers and when you ask somebody a question they are always in a hurry to get away from you to go on break i would not return to this location at all
Brought my Yorkie in and they did an amazing job! Making my next appointment now. They clipped his nails bathed and cut and even cleaned his ears. This was one of the best experiences I have had at a groomers and I highly recommend them!
This Starbucks closes late so that's the upside it has a cool patio and the inside is nice just the one thing I have to complain about is the Internet it sucks but I you come here for anything else it's all good.
Food was ok. Service was poor. Saw a roach near our table. Not my choice for a lunch companion!
Love the family atmosphere, very welcoming & friendly, excellent service & beautiful quality jewelry!
My wife and I had a great experience at Burland. Trish helped us and made it a great experience.
I'm so over this place.  Without fail, it is an unpleasant experience.  The upselling is obnoxious and they a half-assed job.
If I could give them a lower score I would. Horrible decline in quality of service. Very low morale of employees leading to poor service. Used to be great and I would go there before any other car wash or other service.
People are very rude! I was told for an extra $100 when can buff out all the scratches and it would look like a new paint job...no wonder this place has a bad rep!!! I had to give it a rating
I love the food and it is usually excellent service. I always visit the downstairs cellar bar. It has a hip rustic feel and pretty good tunes on the ipod. One of my faves
Wow!  This place is good.  My first time in Phoenix and if I ever get back I'll be sure to dine here.  So should you.  Prego.  (You're welcome.)
M'fn delicious !!! Amazing bartenders and servers... Great environment and the food is beyond delicious!!!
Been to other locations and had wonderful experience there. So I figured I would go here but it was a bad experience way to demanding for me to order as soon as we sat down so we got up and left.
Service and food was excellent!! Red sauce is to die  for! Pregnant girl's dream!! Steve was an awesome Server. Order the risotto balls!
Pleasantly surprised...thought this was just another delicatessen, but this place had a really extensive menu offering something for everyone.  I just stopped in for a snack, but would like to go back and eat a full meal.
not impressed. My salad was $17 for lunch!! and also NOT WORTH IT. Very pricey for what you get.
FYI. Chili's still sucks.
Disappointed. Suzie was very rushed. About 10 minutes into my appointment another girl walked in for her appointment. Suzie sent her to go get her feet done in the meanwhile. This is the worst my nails have looked
Amazing food and excellent service. LOVED the porcini rubbed delmonico.
I have always had a great meal here.
The room was comfortable, the wait staff was friendly and attentive. However for the price the food was just ok. It was our anniversary so we expected some little treat with a candle at the end but what they brought was a plate of pink cotton candy. Holly tooth decay Batman!
I loved the free wi-fi...but the coffee was just ok.  Wish that they would switch to a different brand of soy milk since the Silk soy has a pretty strong flavor profile.
Nothing like an Iced Almond milk Extra Dirty Chai to get this day started!!!!  A must try here.....
The Doc fixed my eye & the staff rocks... you all get out of Jail for free... Maricopa County Jail only.
I have nothing compelling to say because this restaurant is unremarkable.  The food is good.  I have eaten here a few times when I was with a group.  I wouldn't ever choose it on my own accord.
You usually can't go wrong staying at an Embassy Suites hotel.  The rooms are huge and the breakfast is yummy.  You can sometimes get free happy hour drinks too!
Great place to sit and drink wine on a Saturday afternoon where you have nothing better to do. Food's average. Lots of people watching which I  love. No indoor seating though so avoid when hot.
The store is small and uncomfortable, but the products are decent.
Another fine dinner at China Village.  I ordered Ma-Po bean curd for dinner.  I had enough to share with my dinner mate.  The service was excellent as usual.  The hostess was very concerned that my group enjoyed their dinner.
Lara was the best.  Incredible customer service.  Thank you for picking up slack for some other PB locations.
Is is awful customer service, and the people do not wear gloves.\n\ndo not go there.
this is the best car wash that I have used in Phoenix.  yelp coupon doesn't hurt either.
The problem is that the atmosphere is subpar, and the drinks are literally half full. Don't believe me order a 50/50 vesper, it's 50% full. I will not return.
Vincent's market bistro is my usual weekday go to. Always pleased with there salads, soups, apps, mains and desserts! Scotty and the staff are the best. You know a place is good when there clientele have been going there for years and years.
The new owners of Ice House Tavern are no longer hosting live bands. This is such a disappointment to the local music scene!
I am not a vegan but love vegetables and would prefer to not eat meat most of the time. This place has the best spring rolls I have ever tasted. My sister-in-law is vegan and I went with her and she liked it too!
The \"street tacos\" here are outstanding.  Consistent quality w/ a hot sauce bar that apologizes to no one.  Friendly staff.  Hear me now, believe me later.  Strong.
This place is always busy, and mistakes are made with otherwise simple menu items.
I have only gone here for kids/baby gifts and it's a great place to find that perfect, unique gift. It's really pricey, so be prepared to spend a lot. However, they have complimentary gift wrap and it looks really nice when they're done.
I would never go there again. I walked it there and the guy looked at me like I was bothering him. I guess my money will bother him too.
I just came in for an OJ and one of their fruit cups, I was in a deep craving of fruits and this was the closest spot to me that Thursday that offered such small craving to-go. The service was okay/good. Could have been better.
I waited 20 minutes for my asiago bagel and I was the only one in the dining area  but they forgot about it and burned my bagel. Service is terrible.
This place is dirty.  The plate my food was served on was dirty, our waitress's apron was dirty, and the booth we sat in was dirty; it left a huge grease stain on my daughter's pants.   This place is disgusting.
Unimpressed and disappointed. There is nothing to these sandwiches. There are so many other places to get better sandwiches. Will not be returning.
One of my favorite places to grab a quick bit, a delicious dessert, or something fun from the the store!
Went there the next day and had the chicken salad sandwich which was superb.  The people are friendly and attentive.
I stop for their great coffee every morning -- and only drive by when I can't manage to get a parking spot.  LGO also has really great unique gifts that have come in handy for Mother's Day, Christmas and \"just because\" cards and notes.
Yum!\nCute, cute place!!  Go for specialty groceries, pastries, or a quick lunch or breakfast.
Wow. Completely disappointed. I had the commuter. When did English muffins lose their crispness, holes and flavor. Not impressed at all.
Overly priced :/ they do not clean under nails. Very nice workers though. Great customer service. ;)
I LOVE this place!  My sister jokes that the only reason she comes to visit me in Arizona is for Postino's!
This place always has a fun vibe and a great patio. Love meeting girlfriends here for wine and bruschetta.  Good service and nice atmosphere, a true staple.
Not good ,, too small... n its overrated! who waits 1hr for a glass of wine., i would rather get a bottle n drink at home.
1/3 cheddar burger with all toppings.  You wish more places and owner/operators existed like this.
They quoted me 15 minutes, and just 10 minutes later called my name to say it was done. Quickest oil change I've ever had.\n\nPaid $38 and some change with the $5 off Ladies' Wednesday discount.
Best Thai in town. I've been eating here since 1994 or so.
Absolutely the best red curry in history.  Wife loved the brocoly chicken.  I live in Idaho and there are only 2 restaurants in Phoenix I go out of my way for.  Thai lahna is one of them..
The owner was so rude I walked out! And they only accept cash and the only reason I gave them a star is because the review made me! I mean this guy was ridiculous! I never had anyone greet me at the door like that!!
I do not recommend.
Down-home live music dive that's family owned and offers a great value for the money. Cheap drinks, good food, no cover (usually). Opens at 6 am most days. Get over here.
Pruitts was just ok. The place is a little trashed. The prices were ok but not as aggressive as they used to be. The service wasn't very good either granted it is a furniture store though.
Pruitts asked me to email them to allow them an opportunity to make it right. So i did. Haven't heard anything else back.
Chef cooking in the open facility. Mostly noodles. Pad Thai noodles, beef. A most desirable appetite for the hungry man. Couldn't take this to heart.
Went there for an oil change recently.  Didn't know if there's going to be a wait time so I called ahead and make an appointment.  In and out of the store in under 30 minutes.  Great service and friendly staffs.
Food is good but I was told I could not have a refill on my soda... Completely turned off by this. You charge me $2 for a soda and will not give 1 refill? Shame!
The experience at Marcellino Ristorante is perfect and I love their new location in Scottsdale!
I have been to Mary for facials seeking clear skin for 9 years.  Yes my skin looks great.  She always has the latest and best products and treatments.  Mary 's salon is always a place of welcome and relaxation.  She takes time to evaluate my skin each session.
My husband took me to dinner here once. For such a big venue it was extremely empty. \nOnce the food arrived I knew why. The food was so bland. I could have made dinner that night for way cheaper.
You get what you pay for. I may as well have let my kids paint my toenails. Not to mention the tech was rough and cut/pinched several of my toes during my pedicure.   Not impressed. I definitely won't be back.
Chile Relleno is really good. It comes with the standard side of rice and beans which is nothing special. I have been there 4 times and have the same thing each time. Don't blink or you'll drive right past this place.
Get the \"Green Beef\" from the Side Orders, with  Corn tortillas or Rice.
I  had a call this morning from Kitty, and they have agreed to refund a good portion of our repair bill.  Thank you so much for the call and concern.  I will now recommend W J Maloney Plumbing as an A-1 company.
Very happy with ease of Christmas tree shopping. Beautiful backdrop. Cookies, lights, hot cocoa, cider. A nice fire with seats and blankets. Ecstatic that we decided to turn in and buy our first tree here!!!
This place is a great dive bar. We love the drink prices and the people here are laid back and cool. (no need to worry about any fights that I could tell) Highly recommend if you like dive bars. Also they have pool tables and darts.
Delivery is super fast. If you think you can jump in the shower after you call in your order, you'll end up answering your door in a towel.
The worse service ever She went to charge me and said the last time I was in the machine didn't work and charged me for the last time i was in. Ripped off!!!Will never go there again!!!
Great job here as always, but they often mischarge me...rather, overcharge me
The food tasted really good, the time to make it, however, took a while.
It's a chain restaurant what do you expect? ..... Chips and salsa to go... Watching the cowboys hot chips seems like good start
Nothing fancy here but the price is right: $17 for a pedicure and plenty of polish colors to choose from.
Love the bagels.  But . . . Need to have the boxes ready for grab and go. Never seem to have them ready when I get here, thus waiting in line contrary to the program. Bummer.
basic food, nothing special, but all tasted good.  Limited menu, funny wine selection, no multipuciano, or other usual italian wines.  Just the popular basics.  Right next to Goodwill, but better than you'd expect
Terrible service & charged me for ceramic brakes, but only gave me lower-quality semi-metallic brakes. After I went to another mechanic to discover the problem, Fletchers still wouldn't fix the problem.
No one bothered helping us : (
Amazing food! Some of the best curry we have had! So craveable & authentic !!
Love this little, genuine place! It has great lunches and has ruined me for pad Thai anywhere else in the valley! Their soups are a must!
pinky's is closed
Full trash bins, over charged for free drink with sandwich purchase, unfriendly man working today.  \n\nThis is not what I am used to for a QT.
Decent selection, fair prices, but could use more folks at the checkout lanes, or at least a process whereby they call up more employees to help out quicker.
Love Em' new ownership, better atmosphere!\n\nFood is always tasty!
The massage therapist, Susan, is one of those rare finds in a chiropractic clinic. She is an experienced and talented massage therapist whom I highly recommend.
I stopped here occasionally when I'm in the mood for Mexican.   The food is good.   However the reason I go there is because The staff is always friendly.   It's like they're happy to see you.  Other than that it\"s just an okay place with good food
Average location. My order was incorrect as was about 5 out of the next 8 I witnessed.
i use to go to this place few years ago and then i forgot about it after moving to another city.i just saw it on YELP and i remember their amazing selection.I think it is time for some russian caviar.
I have gone here a few times in the past because its the only place around. I have since began just ordering online. The customer service here is terrible and they make you feel really stupid. Avoid it if you can.
Glad to see so many people feel the same about Dr. Larson. My husband and I have been going to him for years, for regular \"maintenance\".
Price reflects quality and service.  5/2010 purchased wedding gown, brides maids and mothers (bride and groom mothers and grandmothers) dresses.  Girls were rude and our brides maids dresses seems and straps fell apart just before the wedding.
Helpful staff! This is what I like to see!!! Love the selection and the staff was very great in helping me and my Auntie find what we needed :D
very poor customer service, i am only going to arrowhead Buckle from now on!! completely ignored at pv and there selection was poor.
Stopped for a quick gyro to go, not bad but the cucumber sauce had overpowering garlic added, very bitter and bad taste left in my mouth for hours!\n\nGirl at the register was stunningly beautiful, will return for another try!
Everytime I go to this places I am surprised.  I just expect it to be bad but the food is actually really good. I have had a salad, a sandwich, and a melt. All were good good. : ) The service is always friendly to boot.
Very good quality / price ratio. Warm and friendly welcome, good effort to understand my broken English. Well located, very good comfort room and spacious. The restaurant on the 27 th floor very well. At recomander.
The most outstanding customer service and extremely efficient wash, details, and oil changes! Anything and everything I need exceeds more than my expectations. I go to this wash at least two times a week and I leave happy every time!
Never eat here. They got my order wrong and put some spicy sauce on my taco that made me throw up.
Friday night, pretty busy, bar somewhat busy and the bartender (attractive, female, brunet) answers the house phone and has been talking for 15 minutes as I write this..  ????  WTF..  never coming back..
This company is good at cleaning your pockets and that's it. Terrible experience even after they were sent back to re-clean. This company does business under numerous names so check out the phone  number - buyer definitely BEWARE - awful cleaning service.
Wasted my time going there at 658pm Friday night when their website said they closed at 8pm.
Our family has frequented Shogun for years and we are done. The service is awful and the food has gone  downhill. While I hope that their manager Shelly has success turning it around, it is obvious that the owners don't care. Our friends are saying the same thing.
Sushi was very good and fresh. The restaurant was very busy, probably due to the $0.25 draft beers on Monday night's. The sushi counter was kinda awkard with high panels.
I will not be ordering from here again. The only good thing I ordered was the cream cheese wontons. All of the vegetables had a really funky taste, and the garlic chicken had no garlic flavor.
They have really good cheap sandwiches for lunch
Disgusting. Typical cheap, dirty, greasy Americanized Chinese food. Clean your damn restrooms! Chicken thigh meat in the chicken and broccoli. Hot and sour was pure barf. Dark.
One step above a hole in the wall buffet place.  Food was edible.  Very bland, service was very un-attentive and my egg roll was soggy to boot.  I'll take my money elsewhere.
Menu looks like every single chinese takeout place on the east coast and they aren't pretentious.  Clearly I'm not in California anymore.  Fantastic.  This place made me pretty dang happy.\n\nIt's rot gut chinese.  Boom.
Average food, VERY limited delivery area, and abrupt customer service.  Very meh.
Super veggie pizza. Steve, is always totally friendly. Solid Craft Beer Selection with 10 or so taps.  Why don't they make their apps?..Music is good as well  but they usually have the same groups.  One of my favs in the (51) Corridor.
Friendly, accommodating, and the pizza and wings are always good.  It is one of my go to places for a casual dinner out.
This was some of the worst sushi I've ever had, especially for the money. I could barely get it down. The place is dumpy and depressing inside. All around terrible.
I ordered a mozzarella and tomato sandwich, a small order of pasta salad, and a drink and it came out to $13. For $13 I could of gone to a restaurant. Paradise Bakery has some of the best cookies around but the food is a rip off.
Quick, helpful, and clean  what else do you want?
Wonderful daycare/preschool. My kids have been there for 2 years and we have had great experiences with all of the teachers. They have a Christian environment which at this age is perfect for any religion- a good foundation of bible stories, God and kindness which we can build upon at home.
Service is almost always slow and food is just okay. Even my beer was warm tonight. Kinda of pricey but what do you expect out of a hotel restaurant?
Stick with sandwiches.  Everything else is so-so.
Good service.  Free sufficient size samples and not just a spoonful.  The regular size is more than enough! When I was there, they were out of a lot of flavors though =(
If you aren't afraid of the atmosphere you'll probably like this. Not for anyone that has any diet restrictions. But man was it packed and cheap. I felt like we had found the Dallas Buyers Club of z Mexican Food.
Chorizo and bean burro and the butter tortillas are a must have! The tortillas here are sooo good :)
Love their fried fish with fries and the endless supply of ranch. Oh sooo good! The price is right, the service is ok. There's room for improvement. Call in your orders during rush hours.
They have good kettle corn
There was a wendys. Thats it in my terminal worth mentioning.  Bathroom doors don't lock.
Lots of construction going on here. But the traffic is never heavy so its ok. they have decent places to grab food and have cool trinquet shops for souvenirs . I come here cause I don't think there is a choice.
The TSA was extremely friendly and understanding
typical airport, moody security and the boarding areas are pretty small
Free WiFi! Spread far out, but I guess if you have one thing in Arizona, it's space
Great airport to fly in or out of.
Most confusing airport ever! I've been to quite a few airports and I've never seen an airport so difficult to navigate, that includes walking around inside and driving on the roads outside.  Just very poor signage.  Airport is nicely updated though...
Sky harbor in general is good but terminal 2- not much of anything. Limited restaurants and only few flights that fly out there. If you coming to terminal 2, then plan on not waiting out here too long.
Late night great food as always.  Very clean, and staff was awesome.
Called today to order a pizza was told they won't deliver to me. No reason why. Nothing. I wont order from them again. Their loss. Funny they used to deliver here. Scoffs .. Guess my money isn't green enough for them.
Great diversity of plants and they have Christmas trees this time of year. I'll definitely be back to check out the rest of the grounds. Very friendly staff that helped us with putting the tree on the roof of the car
I frequent Jays.  Best gyro deal in the area.  The place is not fancy at all.  Don't expect that great of service.  Be sure to listen for your order to be up.  It is barebones, but my stop in Tempe for gyros..
nice place to get grocery and gas, its a convenient neighborhood grocery store in south phx
T-Bone steak ride was wonderful!  Horses are beautiful and well cared for!
Unique experience but don't get suckered into the ride at night and then T Bone dinner at a cabin in the desert. The cabin is a restaurant behind a neighborhood that is ok but not worth the $50 you will spend for two people.
Took our guests from Ohio to see this unique place, and we wanted to see it too. We waited over 45 minutes and no one showed to open the gates. Very under managed and disorganized. We left to see other sites, could not wait all day!!
Decent food, when in the mood for Chinese I go here. Sometimes I even have it delivered. Food is good and service is great.
Ok ,,,, I haven't been to this restaurant in about three years I went back thinking it was going to be the same O same O(which I loved) it turned out to be a very big disappointment;( won't be back plus they were rude
I love this location.  The staff is always awesome and super friendly, especially at night :)  Out of the Taco Bell's I've been to in Phoenix, this is definitely my favorite for that very reason.
What a truly amazing view and ride through that mountainside! I will recommend this place to anyone that ends up in the area. It is something to see for sure
Great Service! Reliable and friendly. I just needed a new headlight installed and they were quick and accurate! The price is right ;) I will go back!
Could be the most inefficient operation.  They had one guy moving cars and four other guys standing around. Took over an hour to get a wash, and that included no vacuum as well.
This is my favorite sushi spot.  The price is right, the staff is friendly, the sushi is pretty darn good and the ambiance is nice and cozy.  Great for a date, or even just lunch.  I can walk out full and sakied up for 20 bucks!
Best Lo Mein anywhere in this town! Their dishes always taste fresh and are superbly balanced. We paid them many visits and were never disappointed. They deliver as well.
Staff is excellent and knowledgable.  Flatbread was fantastic.  Very cute and great atmosphere.
Overpriced and overhyped food. Last time turned around at the door due to the smell and waiting line.....
Great happy hour specials! They also do a special during the summer when the temp hits a certain point they give free chocolate or cheese fondue to they're facebook fans.
Our visit was the climax to a wonderful eveing out and the staff were so awesome in describing their menu and how it all worked.
Everything here is delicious!  Burgers on pretzel buns is where it's at.  And the fish tacos were amazing and I don't even like fish!  If you're thinking about trying is place, do yourself a favor and go!
Decent food. We ordered cod fish tacos and salmon with quinoa which was listed as lifestyle menu. My entree side was kale salad which was not my favorite. Drinks were good and service was nice but slow.
Read in the paper this location has closed! It was a decent place to eat at the handful of times I went there. Hope something good goes in its place fast.
Just makes your day better when you have friendly service and a yummy bagel!
Such great service!  Everyone in there is so nice.  My husband bought my engagement ring at Ganem and they are always so helpful whenever I bring it in to get cleaned or buffed.  Great staff & never any pressure to purchase.  The only jewelers we will use from now on.
I have been here once and tried the red velvet cake and it was great! If only they were open on Sundays too! :)\n\nWill definitely go again.
This is an alright place if you haven't experienced some of the much better places in Arizona.  I think it is somewhat overpriced compared to similar restaurants and the food isn't anything to rave about.
Was visiting friends and found this place thanks to Yelp. The food was good but not good enough to warrant 4 stars.
Had the super nachos and hard shell taco. Nachos were loaded- had extra toppings when we ran out of chips and the tacos were nice with a little heat.
Great food, good prices, and a good menu. Only downside is the wait is a little long and the place is cramped. Overall a great place for your die hard Mexican food lover.
I freaking love this place! Their Arizona Burrito with chicken is amazing! My favorite little hole in the wall Mexican restaurant!
Hair cut and price for 2 yorkies poor and it stunk smelled bad
Great service!!\n(written on 4/24/2012)
This Best Buy is not as new looking as the one by the mall but I feel like the employees here are more knowledgeable and helpful than at the other location.
I will never be back to this Best Buy and would advise everyone else to find a more customer friendly store.
I thought the whole point of taco bell is its open late. Not 11pm, or a few minutes before. Boo
Eye Priority is a fantastic business - quality and professional eye exams by caring optometrists - fashionable and large selection of frames to choose from coupled with a extremely helpful staff. No better place for prescription eyewear in Ahwatukee!
Food is barely average and going down hill fast. Service is not great but they try. But they might think of asking the waitress to shower once in a while. Gross.
After getting diarrhea from eating the mediocre Mongolian Beef here, I think I would avoid any future contact with this establishment.
This place has the best gourmet shrimp, bacon & avocado tacos!!! YUM
How the Mighty have fallen , service is pure crap
This place is beautiful. Hospitality is great. Food is good. Gym is good. Plenty to do here and plenty of swimming pools. Worth checking out.
Awesome resort and fabulous water park!  Great for the family!
Fun atmosphere, great drinks and tasty food. My wife and I had a great dinner here we will be back when were back in Phoenix :)
View was incredible. Service was quick and nice. Fried bread was delicious.  Steaks were mediocre.  Vegetables and sides were awful.
Simply put...I've had better.  I ordered two meals with fried rice.  The rice contained hard pieces that were uneatable, yuck!  Crab ragoons had an imitation crab flavor and sadly to say, I think Panda Express does it better.
First time to Waffle House and we were not disappointed. Selection is basic but service was friendly and the hot and delicious was served in under 5 minutes. We were headed out of town and this place was perfect for a hot meal on the go.
Heard good things, but, did not even measure up. Very bland...really man? It's Thai how can it be flavorless? Don't waste your time!
This practice sends out junk mail and there is no way  to get off.  From now on I am going to write a negative review about everyone who sends me junk mail
Excellent food as always
This location is clean and efficient.  Our waitress was awesome and had our order in and food out VERY quickly.  The food is all fantastic and of good quality.
I LOVE this Petsmart! I shop here, adopted my cat and my dog here, use the grooming salon (well, not personally) and just really like everything about it and its employees! They really go above and beyond to help you figure out and find what you need.
This place is pretty good. I was surprised. The service was just ok though.
Had great service here but the food was nothing special & the atmosphere wasn't either. Unless you are drinking beer & watching sports there really is no reason to be here.
Ick. Surprised this location has not been closed. There is seldom anyone there, the food is terrible and smells like dirty wet towels when you first walk in. Attention health dept, time for a spot check.
I have been going to rebeckha lafferty for years..best at cutting very thick hair and colors knowledge is great. .only go to her. .If she is off wait till she is available. ..
Such a fun place for kids and parents both.  Great place to make gifts or just to have fun.  So fun.
Meh. I've experienced better.
Lobster pot stickers, divine Butterfish, seared Ahi , chocolate lava cake all to die for!!
So slow! Waited 30 min between courses. Entree dish was barely warm- the manager removed the charge for the dish. Food was good, not the service I expect at its price point. Disappointing.
ordered the steak sandwich (medium rare).  Came out cooked medium.  Still very delicious.  French fries were not good, way too salty.  Server seemed as though he did not want to be there, with a grouchy attitude.
Good theatre, got tickets and good seats... Air conditioning worked well, bathrooms were very clean... And so were the floors in the theatre.
Absolutely love the service at Audi Scottsdale! I own my 2nd Audi and highly recommend. Wouldn't own any other brand. My service consultant, Jason, is the best!
When is Land Rover fast? When they're processing my payment. When do they take their sweet time? The remainder of the time. BTW, that free coffee is gonna cost you.
The urgent care here is ridiculous!! Waited for over a hour and  a half just to see the nurse practitioner who was only in here for 5 minutes tops. I wouldn't have come here but this was the only urgent care open on Sunday.
I like the pan fried dumplings and the hot and sour soup. The entree plates are huge and made to share. Staff is friendly and the drinks are good.
place is very clean:) Banana Republic is the only store I really go to here.
Very friendly people who work here. They were so great with my kids! Definitely will be back.
shitty pizza.. shittier customer service.. do your self a favor and order from Big Boy's. Bitch.. I am a customer. Don't get all snotty with me on the phone for asking questions about your specials.
Always great wings. I went to watch UFC with some friends. Staff is friendly drinks a plenty. good staff @ this loc.  no complaints.  my compliments
Went there last night for their monthly free planetarium show. It was a really cool show that was unfortunately set to Pink Floyd music. After the show the science dept professors had a huge telescope set up and we were able to look at the moon. First friday of every month!
Terrible customer service, they close 10 mins early as customers are getting out and turn them away, spend your money anywhere else.
Went by the other day and it is closed.  Unfortunate, now I don't know where to get the delicious sour cherries in syrup I love with greek yogurt.
My chicken was so plain. I was upset with it. It was just teriyaki chicken. Hard to mess up. I doubt ill be back. It is a relaxing place tho. Just dont go for the food.
THE BEST crab puffs, hands down.
Best Subs around period.
I love Cheba hut. My personal favorite is the White Widow. Its the best chicken bacon ranch sandwich out there. Their meat and dressings are prepared fresh daily.  Great spot for lunch breaks but be prepared to wait, the line will be long.
Service was fast, friendly and everything was so much fun . And the sandwich I ordered was phenomenally good. I should have gotten the 4 inch because that was all I could finish. When I saw the picture of Ice Cube on the ice machine I thought I would lose it. Hilarious!
Good bulgogi, and a spicy octopus platter I forgot the name of.  I'd visit again, but my eyes tear whenever I walk into the place- not their fault I'm allergic to *.
This place has AWESOME kimchi Chigae, kalbi is ok but kinda overpriced. The service is hit or miss here. \n\nBut probably one of the best korean places on the east side.
Local shop with a great selection and very helpful. \n\nGot to support the locals!
It's okay. it's nothing like San Francisco food .
I've been here 5 minutes, only one hair stylist here doing a trim on a guy's hair, while chatting and watching YouTube videos and consistently stopping. Should maybe take in to consideration that she has a customer waiting.
They certainly have everything, from tiaras to bottles of that stuff you use to create real-looking wounds. A little on the pricey side, but excellent stuff overall.
I've never really had a bad experience per se, but I've not exactly been helped a whole bunch either. It's Home Depot. What more can you expect?
More expensive than most of the sushi places in Mesa. They make the rolls look normal sized by adding extra rice using very little fish. I would not go back, very poor value.
I would give it more stars, but I don't want the bar to get too crowded.
Wow this is a really nice place. I've never visited this cinema before, but I was surprised. The restrooms are clean and modern, the theatre is a great size and they have a great selection at the snack bar. I will go back to this theatre for sure.
Can you say- alot of food. First time patron and wasn't that impressed. It's alright nothing spectacular. Just feels like and taste like your at olive garden on steroids.
4 words.  rib eye medium rare.\nand cinammon butter rolls.\nhands down, the BEST steakhouse.  better than outback, ruth chris's, all the fancy places.
Yoko is pretty good, prices are just right and service is friendly and prompt. I would recommend this to someone.
I have been coming here for over 10 yrs.  I try other places and always come back to Nancy's place.  They are friendly, I like my nails and pedi's.
i love tjs there selection of vegies,cheeses,flowers,ect ,ect, ect all at such great prices, and just there over all selection of intresting products, i  am like a kid in a candy store,
Party of 10.   Made a reservation.    Had to wait 30 minutes anyway.   Desmond, our waiter could have cared less.   Food was decent, but the service was brutal.\n\nIm guessing they either have high staff turnover or are under staffed.
Had the BBQ Burger for lunch. Too much lettuce tomato and 'fixings' to steal the taste of the burger away. \n\nLet the meat be the star of the burgers, not lettuce.
This will be quick . Was there the night of May 13. Staff were less than helpful, in fact they weren't helpful at all.
Good food, arrives hot, service is spectacular!
Carne Asada tacos are to die for. Had four at $1.10/each and was pleasantly full to the gills. Will return next time in the area.
Pretty little dive for some amazing mexican food. The street tacos are amazing and everything along with it was superb. Probably one of the top 5 spots for Mexican food in the east valley.
The valley isn't known for its \"mom and pop restaurants\" or \"Dives\" as I affectionately call them but this place was spot on a great place to eat. I'm looking forward to trying their breakfast items.
Still the best dinner theater .Great for all ages .Very clean ,and nice .
I was in the area so I tried out royal cleaners. A bit pricey I think.....the 2 out of 3 pairs of shorts I had them repair (buttons) have came off again. Being that they weren't cheap I expected a much better job
I sued these people and won. Please make sure you take pictures when you move in and when you move out! Office is full of kids that have no idea what they are doing. Check out their reputation with the BBB.
Ugg hortible service. Not helpful or smiley. Food was subpar. Flimsy lettuce and bland. Patio has no speakers or misters...but hey they have heaters..what the heck?
Have never heard a word from corporate, even an apology email would have been nice.  I'd be willing to bet they get SO MANY complaint letters they just can't keep up.  Or they just don't give a shit.  My money is on the second.
Nice 50's atmosphere albeit noisy. Had breakfast of eggs, ham and \"home fries.\" Potatoes were frozen from a bag, not fresh. Biscuits were frozen from a bag. Service was OK. Seems to be popular with the 70+ crowd.
Waiting room is not very comfortable. Too busy on a Friday be prepared for lots of upgrades. Good luck with just an oil change.  They are good and fast just keep at an oil change only.
This location could use an update,  it's pretty run down.  I do appreciate their selection of toys are better than Wal-Mart and target but I do know that they're bigger stores elsewhere.  In the EV this is the best we have.
This hospital is the best i have ever seen.  They are taking such good care of my mother. As well as all patients.  The oncology dept is the best, the friendliest ever.  Thank you
Service was excellent, food was excellent, atmosphere was comfortable.  I enjoyed eating at Serrano's.  The bean dip an salsa with their chips was excellent!  I had a 2 item combo with a tamale and enchilada.  Very tasty.
Went here because of the beautiful building and positive reviews... We were disappointed to say the least. Soggy chimichanga, mushy rice, bland machaca and chicken, chips that tasted like supermarket chips, and mediocre salsa.
It's K Mart, not bad just nothing special. Nothing really sets K Mart apart from any of the other conglomerates. Gotta shop here from time to time for MH exclusives so you'll see me busting out my Maverick patch & showing it off with pride
Its Home Depot. Decent prices & decent materials. convenient locations
So much Wrangler in here. This is redneck heaven! I will definitely be back!
I love Taco Bell! Just not this one. I now drive out of my way not to go to this one. The order is wrong Every time and I really mean every time. Bad service Bad food!
40 minutes for an oil change and then a hard up sell at the end.  At least they vacuumed my carpets.
This location blows!  From the smug attitude of many of the associates to the downright ineffectiveness of the work they pretend to be doing.  It really is awful.  Unfortunately, this location is the closest to my house.
Best buy staff are knowledgable and engaging not to happy with the venders if u will that are within the store but happy none the less
Food and service at Nellos is pretty good. Portions are a good size and the bread they give you to start the meal is delish!
Me and my husband LOVE LOVE Nello's! We have been going for years and it is by far our favorite place to go for a night out!
Lots of different options and good pizza too! Our server was a little off, but mayeb she was just having a weird day.
Awesome pizza and great service. Super friendly and a pleasure to dine out here! Don't forget to try the grilled wings!
I liked it, but my boyfriend hated it.  I might be able to talk him into going back for a happy hr or something.  They have good specials and a nice setup for drinks with friends, but no way will he want to go back at lunch time.
Waffle and banana chocolate chip pancakes are good. Service not so good. Had to wait for about two minutes for the hostess to show up. Waitress didn't smile at all :(
Pretty good breakfast, but nothing unique.
I sat in the drive thru waiting for my food for 10 minutes and was not even busy.  slow service. And they gave me the wrong order.
Horrible customer service had a receipt and wanted to exchange something like I was told I could they told me they needed the complete original packaging which was a piece of cardboard way overpriced also
We only go here for the beer selection. The food is ok,just don't stray from ordering pizza and you'll be fine.
We love ordering from these guys. Unfortunately, they're no longer in business. :(
wonderful wonderful friendly service and breakfast. sat outside but the whole place has a comfy family atmosphere. down home cooking!
Excellent, friendly service for a great price. I brought my shoes in and 2 days later they looked BRAND NEW. I would highly recommend this place. They're just 1/2 block south of Main St. by the Nile.
This location seems to go through an abnormally large number of new staff constantly. I have not had a problem with getting the correct order, but customer service is very hit and miss.
Stop by for dinner last night and place has good food and service was attentive here. Prices are good and the atmosphere is good. I be back later to see if the place stay consistent with service and food.
Slow as fudgesicles.
The food was great but the service was not nearly as good as the food. I'm pretty sure the staff did not want to be there. Next time I'll just order take out.
Did not want to give one star. Horrible service, grouchy servers..... Worst service ive ever had. Do your family a favor.... Don't eat at golden china..... Especially if your Hispanic
Take your elementary-aged children for a short day-trip.
Friendly staff\nCrunchy munchy wrap was yummy\nSweet potato wedges with sriracha mayo was pretty good.\n\nWill be back.
*Quick \n\n*Pleasant Service\n\n*Inexpensive for a generous amount of food \n\n*The best overall tasting Chinese I have found thus far in the Casa Grande Area!
Gross! I decided to try the hotel restaurant this time. It took like 40 minutes to get my food and the pasta sauce tasted like it was canned. I could have microwaved better food in my room.
Friendly, casual atmosphere with very tasty pizza.  Huge variety of toppings and an excellent olive oil base.  I find the pizzas with tomato sauce to be a little bland, but all of the rest have been fantastic.  Salads are huge and fresh.
Best pizza in ahwatukee hands down. It's also the kind of place that reminds me of home which is a great compliment.
I really  like NYPD food and service. Don't sit on the patio though, they forget about you out there. I was disgusted and left from the lack of service out there. I did eventually come back because I like their food.
Crispy thin crust, and fresh flavorful ingredients.  Very highly recommended if you want a good quality pizza.
I gave this place 5 stars in the past but I have changed my mind since new owners have taken over.  They have raised their prices and you can only get one flavor for the kid size, which you used to be able to get two.  Thumbs down!
I wish I could give them 10 stars. The service is always top notch and I love the Chimi's
Best Pho in Phoenix and the best price.  No place better and no place cheaper.  Me an My wife go back again and again. Very Very Very good.  12 - 14 dollars two people with water as drink. you can't beat that.
Really Good Vietnamese food! Good Service. I always order the same. Pho Soup, egg noddle, seafood style.
I really like that the free weights are separated from the treadmill area. pool is nice trainers are great too. I usually go after work and its never too crowded. they also have some great spin classes.
As a partner in the property management industry, I have to say that this property has already seen so many positive changes in the past few weeks.  The staff is very welcoming and it has become one of my favorite places to visit.
Good simple American Italian food. Prices are great. Service is pretty fast. \nAvoid Wednesday night as it's Lowery organ test night. Loud old-time music. Not sure why.
A most unexpected gem! If you are a wine drinker, fabulous flights! Great selection! I can't say much more other than... AWESOME!
Good Pizza,Calzones nothing exceptional.Shopping center wine bar.
Everytime I order here or stop in and eat it's been great food. The only thing is the service there is really hit and miss so ill give a 4 overall. 5 on food and 3 on service
Food was okay, my rice was good but my flautas were super greasy and not very flavorful... The best thing about the experience was probably the bean dip and chips. But I've still had better
Extremely poor customer service - the owner lied to me when I came to pick up my clothing and it wasn't ready. That was after calling the night before and getting attitude for inquiring before he originally said it would be ready. There's nothing special about this place.
The tacos here are street style, which means that they are muy tiny.  I have been here around 4 or 5 times and they are always overloaded with cilantro.  Customer service is very good however.
I really like the convenience of drive thru Starbucks, but this one has a traditional vibe that makes me want to get out of my car. They are friendly and always get my drink right.
Great coffee and snack selection.  They are friendly and efficient.  I usually end up here more than I expect because Einstein Bagels next door tends to let me down, so I walk right over here and they consistently great.
Hands down... I love this place. They  have everything! Lots and lots of variety from imported goodness to the freshest produce. A chef's dream? yes, I believe so. \nI can always find what I need here.
yes it smells but when I've been here I just imagine traveling to all the countries, ,depths and dark places to get all the things they have here.
international az
Sushi is first rate, the fish is so fresh! Loved the albacore,  tried beef toungue, DELICIOUS! Must come back and try the hot dishes.... Hard to find real Japanese food, so glad we found this!
Al does some seriously good fish - get ya sum!!!
Great slides for the three year old; haven't had a service issue, beyond typical fast food worker apathy.\nOil needs to be chaned in the fryer. :-P
You get what you pay for.  Well, I got what they paid for.
I do not believe how this place got the rating that it has. I got burnt, over cook shumai, precooked and dried out chicken.  Food is bad to go along with the unhelpful order taker.  I will not be back.
They would not even bother calling me back about getting a quote. Had to call three times to see what the deal was. Receptionist was very nice but apparently Dennis is a bum. Can't attest to any work since I was apparently not worth calling back.
It is Startbucks. Just like in your neighborhood.
Ice cream was soft and not creamy like it used to be. Way over priced
Nice icecreams with a huge amount of alternatives. Nice place to grab an icecream when in the mall. Had the donought - one. Overall good place
A fun stop on a long road.
Horrible and liars.  I asked them to not run my credit and wouldn't sign a info sheet. A few days later I checked my credit and their was a hard inquiry from them. We will spread the word about their dishonest practices and of course never buy from them.
Horrible wait time. Waited almost an hr to get help. Just to make a payment! workers are super slow. Sprint service sucks and obviously the stores/workers also, exactly why we went to tmobile instead!
I love this place! The staff is amazing and always makes you feel at home. I'm obsessed with their breakfast burritos. And the biscuits and gravy? Amazing!
Great selection, as one would exxpect from a Bath and Body Works.\n\nBut even better than that, great people.  They are always so helpful.  I will always come to this location.
I like the Cheesecake Factory menu, but the portions, calories, and sodium and fat counts are really too much. I like their happy hour, however.
I've been 2 times here and both had a good ending. I enjoy what I order, which is mainly sushi and some of their pasta dishes. Good service and nice environment.
Great service.. Friendly staff!!!!
It's nice to have kids build a bear. Unique and kids seem to love it . Expensive! We are going to do it one more time for our kid , that's it!
While they have delicious food, seating is very limited and they are MUCH too slow in cleaning the tables. Too many customers standing around looking for a place to sit and eat.
Great place for mexican food if your white and never had homemade. Just like Seranos or any other chain, plus its more expensive.
Love their chips and salsa's, sangria swirl margaritas are delicious too! Great happy hour and service!
Food is delicious, but agree with other reviewers. You don't get much for what you pay. Way too pricey!
I usually come out here after the lunch hour rush. You would think its slow enough that you can be seated immediately. Not. 3 stars is all i can give.
Drove by, they are closed :(
Scale of 1-10 (multiple visits):\n8 Food\n8 Service\n8 Atmosphere\n7 Value
Wonderful service.  Wonderful food.  Pf Chang never disappoints.   One of the best Hot n Sour soups ever.  Lettuce wraps are great.  All entres were excellent.  A great experience.  Thanks Stefanie for the nice service.
I really think this has the best ramen I have ever had. Service is surprisingly great, considering how packed it is every time I am here. Whenever someone come in town, I always suggest this place
I have been going to The Keg Steak House now ever since they first opened. I have enjoyed everything from the ambiance  to the wonderful food and the servers are great. I highly recommend this restaurant. Alot of quality for the price.
Pork egg rolls have about as much pork as the vegetable spring rolls...not much.  Nothing like the advertisement.
Food was ok the burritos come with just meat nothing else. So if you order the chicken burrito you are going to get a tortilla filled with shredded chicken. Their floutas were good I would go back for them especially with their salsa.
The green tamales are delicious! LOVE THEM.
Great pizza and wings !! get delivery from here at least 3 times a month definitely recommend it
Sat for 20 minutes and never got served. Crabby Don's should be Crappy Don's. Left for Mexican restaurant across the street.
Awesome food
Dr. Driggers is amazing. I have two Uromastyx who he has examined and I wouldn't trust their care to anyone else. No complaints.
I tried the white pizza and picnic sandwich.  The pizza was the best white pizza I've had anywhere, and the sandwich was very fresh.  I look forward to trying breakfast here.
The place gets pretty crowded. The people working there were friendly. I tried one of their favorites - Picnic with sweet potato salad. The sandwich was very good. The salad on the other hand was simply too salty to go with the sandwich.
Great food, always fresh and innovative items on the menu. The staff is very friendly and attentive to what's going on. I also like that much of their produce comes from local sources.
Kristen and the rest of the Liberty Market staff were so friendly! All the food looks unreal, atmosphere is fantastic, even down to the bathrooms. Definitely stop by if you're in the area.
Hands down can not get enough! Atmosphere, food, employees, and location! one word BOMB!!!
Get fuel here! Yay!
A good place for kids. There is a play area. The pizza was not very bland/generic. If you want good pizza this is not the place.
Zero knowledge about insurance billing and general office procedures. Office manager argues and has a bad attitude. I would not recommend this place, nor will I ever schedule another appointment. Go to Lenscrafters if you have Tricare/United Healthcare.
Love this little Mexican burrito shack! The carnesada is good! I love the beans and rice too!
Best burritos I've ever tasted from NV to AZ! Seriously can't find anywhere comparable
Everyone should eat here if they want to get really bad Food Poisoning and almost die!!!!
Great Family owned place to get all of your BBQ supplies!
The food is excellent and the delivery service is outstanding.  They handle everything with a smile. We've eaten our way through the menu and haven't found anything that wasn't good.
I have been going to Connie for about 10 years and she has always been corteous and her prices are very resonable.  I go to her for watch repairs, band replacement, batteries and I got my ring resized.  I would definitely recommend Connie to my family and friends.
play it.
Very spacious and clean. They have two train that ride around the park. I think I like riding on it even more than my daughter! They also have a carousel, two playgrounds and two snack shops. I rate this the number 1 park in Phoenix!
Took my nieces here a few weeks ago. Great place for kids of all ages. Very inexpensive too so that was a bonus.
Amazing happy hour! Spendy but not at happy hour.
I stumbled across this place while looking for lunch. Great hole in the wall, everything looked delicious. I had the gyro, not too shabby.
I don't think I saw an employee for the first 10 minutes I was in there. Once I basically ran into one he was helpful.
Very similar to Filibertos in price and quality. Good with mass quantity. The place is small, and pretty simple.
eaten here for 10 years, best sushi ever, fair prices and very nice people
Place has great food! Service was slow due to how busy it was but well worth the wait.\n\nHighly recommended place for breakfast!
Coming from Michigan which has one or two outstanding Deli's, Chompie's was a huge disappointment.  Their corned beef was lousy compared to Vienna brand.  Their prices are beyond ridiculous.  I will continue my search for a good Jewish Deli in Arizona.
I really like the food here - it's well prepared with quality ingredients. Not much on atmosphere (unless you like dining on picnic benches under the glow of florescent lighting), so it's best to call ahead and take it home with you.
Houstons is my favorite spot for lunch. Great wine list when it's not a business lunch. Sounds silly but get the chicken tenders, they will not disappoint. A child's dish done in an adult manner. The service is always great.
I prefer \"All About Tennis\" but SA gets a thumbs up for having a decent selection of Tennis-related gear, having wide-size tennis shoes in stock, XL size socks (these are shockingly hard to find), plus it's really close to home and the club.
Waiting in line to pick up ROC Race packet for 50 minutes so far and still not there yet. You would think that Sports Authority, a sponsor, would help organize packet pick up so the participants had more time to shop!
I talked to the owner to request a 1 hour donation to deliver a cake for a 4 year old little girl in hospice. The owner was extremely rude and claimed that he gave to charity often and doubted the validity of my story. I would not recommend this place to anyone.
I just had to drop a note to say just how nice it was to have fast, clear and strong Wi-Fi in my room.\nWhomever handles that for your place is doing great work.
I love this place! Great croissants, soup, and dessert! They are known for their delicious chocolate chip cookies!
We bought two cameras from Lauren. She knew we didn't live there, we were on vacation. She was patient and really went long on the set up and tips. Very engaging, this is our camera place when we are in Arizona!
Great neighborhood Deli, Bring cash, great food
Every time I've been to this Denny's the service is horrible. I tried it a few times because the first time I went was later in the night so I thought if give it another shot but every time I've gone nothing has changed.
One of our favorite restaurants in Scottsdale.  The food is very good but the service is outstanding (especially the lady who often serves as the hostess - high energy, always smiling)
Decent breakfast and service. Cute little restaurant. The fresh squeezed orange juice was amazing!
Best eyecare office in Arizona! Customer Service is best in breed and products are A rated. Highly recommended
They do a good job and they will come back out to retreat if you see any bugs.  From time to time I have needed them to come back because of scorpions which they gladly do.  I have used them since I moved into my house in 2001 and their prices seems fair.
This place is pretty damn good. The egg rolls and crab puff was amazing. I wasn't sure if this place was any good but we decided to try it out anyway and I'm glad that we did! We will definitely be ordering from here again!
Had an appointment to get liquid gel nails done.  The lady who did my nails was very rude and I didn't like how they turned out. I tired to communicate with her but was ignored.  Will not return,  would not recommend.
Highly recommend this place! Clean, friendly and pretty quick in getting you seated. Ask for Tommy, he always does a fantastic job.
Be sure to call before driving there...the website claims they are open until 5pm but there wasn't a sign of life when I showed up at 4:30 :( I'm sure the cookies are delicious, but I did not get the opportunity to make a purchase.
I have been going to Top Nails for years and can't imagine going anywhere else! I love, love, love them, Highly recommend them!
I love this place, great food and atmosphere, but on my last visit wasn't impress with new addition to menu
Bartender service is supposed to be fast and attentive.  At the bar and he decided to read the paper instead of pay attention to anyone. Blah.
Great menu and good food!
It was ok...Nothing special.  I ordered an italian sub, and it was served on a bun/roll...not the Italian bread that I'm used to.  I should have just gone to Jimmy Johns.
This place is absolutely disgusting. Dirty, dirty, dirty. I'd rather pay to sleep in my car. Also, the staff is very rude.
After leaving Jos. A Banks across the parking lot where there were no coats in my size (54), I met with Stewart who happily showed me a nice selection in my size and with buy 1 get 1 free, they are tailoring both now.  Good job and great service.
The rooms are very so so and the hospitality was non existent, I will not be going back!,
Nice hotel and friendly staff.  A nice place to get away for a few days.
wow!  such a beautiful place!  from the golf course to the bars and outside patio, it's great.  We went there for Infusioncon and it was awesome!
best ever massage I have ever had! xoxoxo
best place to buy shoes
Just the worst. Owner was ranting in the back and humiliating his staff. So nasty and so rude.
Fresh and good but the actual hot dog on the Chicago dog tastes like one from the grocery store. Meets the craving for Chicago but not completely.
I loved this place before I even got in the front door. Very good prices, and well organized.  The owner is so friendly.  It seemed like every item of fabulous clothing I picked up was on sale for half price.  I am definitely a regular now!!!
Great selection, clean, and good prices.  Nice jewelry selection too.
Tried to have a romantic dinner at this place with m y wife. Food was great, but the service not so good. Rude wait staff. Maybe a Jersey thing?? but I'm from Jersey and wasn't feeling the love...
I feel like Ra is too focused on social and not sushi. Good for groups, and decent happy hour prices. Lots of cute waitresses too.
The sushi at RA is beyond amazing!  I eat sushi about 3 times a week and if I could eat at RA evertime, I WOULD!  Happy Hour rocks and there's some really awesome stuff on the HH menu!  Absolutely love it!
Warm, friendly ....  nice and reliable and conveniently located inside PV Mall.
If you want a perfectly baked bagel, NY Bagels 'n Bialys has the best. They have a large menu to satisfy any breakfast craving and offer fast service. A great breakfast restaurant.
Food was authentic and yummy. It was very inexpensive and you can bring your own wine!! What a concept. No cork fees either.
This store always looks like a bomb went off. Every time I visit this location it is unorganized, messy, and it smells weird. The messiness makes it very difficult to find things, which can be really frustrating.
Beautiful campus!! First time attending and have the pleasure of having two exemplary  professors.  This school has a great culinary arts programs as well as an awesome hospitality program!!\n\nLove it!
A bit of an older b&n but it has all the essentials.  Good, clean store and friendly employees make the experience even better.
Went here once for labwork.  My wife had something down the street to tend to.  No one was there, and it was only me that Friday morning.  I was in and out in 7 minutes.  Too bad this place is now closed :-(!!!
They finally closed. I believe this was the first A.J.'s in Arizona......and the past few years it slowly went downhill.
had a pedi and gel mani done today! absolutely will be coming back :) everyone was so nice and the prices are perfect. \nvery very clean as well!
They did a great job. They got us right in, they have massage chairs, they were very good.  They gave us bottled water. My daughter got a flower on each of her big toes and there was no extra charge even with a jewel on it.
I have a food allergy and they had no idea how to prepare my food safely. The worst chipotle I've been to in any state.
Terrible Service... It took a few minutes just to be greeted by the Host.\nFood was ok...
Horrible service and gave our food to another table
Great sandwiches.  My kids love the pizza and soda fountain with the numerous options.
These guys are great! Kelly and mark are always professional and I always refer my customers to them.  Especially for classic cars. But, they do all makes body shop repairs! Thanks guys for helping me out! See you next time my truck needs fixed.
Great service here....the crew does a great job!
Food was great!  We went back a few more times since November.  I'm very glad Al's fixed the issues that they were having and went back to very good food again.
I do enjoy the italian bread here, but there isn't enough meat, cheese or topping to enjoy it! I definitely hate to say it but subway is just on the NW corner off the 101 and Shea. Its pretty expensive and not very loaded with toppings.
Sub par. The service, the ambiance, the menu. The best part about Zipps is the - albeit limited - selection of draft beer! If you just need a casual hang-out spot for a happy hour, this place will do just fine.
I only come her for Kiwanis Club of Scottsdale McCormick's weekly meeting.  Never played on-site or use any of their other facility other than the small banquet room facing the fountain area.  Overall service was good, but they do indeed need to improve their facilities.
Pool is in major need of renovation! Bugs everywhere in pool too. Very filthy.
I am always pleased at Galileo's. The food is phenomenal and you can't find better service anywhere else. The owners are amazing because they really make you feel welcomed and right at home.
This place is comparable to Buca di Beppo.\n\nDefinitely for the masses.
Good, solid pizza place with lots of charm and great service. Really good salads too.\n\nGreat place to go for a birthday -- the warm chocolate chip cookie w/ ice cream is sinful. Loved it!
WARNING !!!  this location is worse than any used car lot I ever visited.  Had to cancel three times before they finally stopped billing me.  Good therapists and good massage but HoRRiBLE business ethics,  DO NOT give them your credit card or checking info
They wanted 30 dollars to hem a apron..when I told them that's too expensive they told me I can go somewhere else and gave me my apron. Don't like to give bad reviews to little shops but it was upsetting
The pizza was very good.  The service was very friendly.\n\n The outdoor deck upstairs is a nice touch that makes it a more pleasant place to eat and the decor was a hit with our children.\n\nGood place to grab a pizza.
Terrible pizza. As a relatively new arizona transplant, I had been looking for a great local pizza joint. These guys charge restaurant prices for horrible rubbery SAMs club quality pizza. $30 for shit pizza. Don't waste your money.
WOW! I normally wouldn't review a gas station but this place is so bad I felt it warranted it. The angle of the lanes is absurd and it seems everyone there is pissed about something.
The idiot oil change kid tried to charge me $79.95 for an oil change that I got at Honda for $29.95. Told me my
The price was way too high for an average car wash at $13 for the basic wash.
Terrible customer service. High prices. Careless employees inside and out. I won't be back!
Evan's awesome. Great at figure skates, fitting, mounting, etc. My daughter LOVES him AND her new skates!
Seems a little small and cramped.  Location is ok, prices cheap.  Salesmen have a weird vibe- you can tell they have so many ulterior motives than to actually provide real customer service.
Decent and cheap haircut with friendly stylists. They cut me a little shorter than I would have liked but pretty good for $14.
I am not as big a fan of this place as some of the other rook your burrito chains but this particular location has the fattiest chicken and on 2 occasions the food here has made me sick.
Slowest chipotle I have ever been to. Watching people leave after standing in line so long. It's like this every time I come. Today thought if would not be bad ad there were only about 5 people ahead of me but it'd still forever.
Arriba's was not as good as they used to be, apparently the original owner passed away and its under new ownership. Won't be coming back here again.
I'm not a fan.  Pretty average burrito.
If you get the 1/2 size Nacos it is the perfect amount. Not the best place drinks wise if you are not a beer person... then again it is a brewery. I am just unable to drink beer due to allergies. So some more drink specials would be appreciated.
Decent spot, about what you would expect from a brew-pub.  This was my first time trying Four Peaks beers and I thought they were ok.  The food was your typical pub far, but much better quality.  The hummus stood out.  Would definitely return if in the area.
They microwave the eggs and meat and didn't have any bagels at left at 9am.  Won't be returning, though the service was ok.
We went in again and this time on what I have to consider one of their busiest times, Sunday mid morning for brunch. The service was fast and flawless!\n\nWildflower and Louis you convinced me! 5 stars!
If you believe bread makes a great sandwich, you will want to check out this place. I had the sausage and egg sandwich on 9 grain toasted. You could taste the fresh ingredients that all worked together beautifully. I will be back.
I love Wildflower and frequently visit. My favorite thing on the menu is the seasonal Tuscan Kale salad! \n\nThis location gets very busy for lunch so I call ahead and my food is always ready for me when I arrive.
Everyone here is wonderful.  Make no mistake this is no nationwide vision or Lenscrafters.  The doctors hear are very knowledgeable and down to earth.  I drive 45 minutes to go here.
Exellant food! Inexpensive lunch buffet ( like 8.95). Friendly staff. Best beans and rice anywhere! Not much more to ask for. Food portions are inconsistant, I think it depends on who's cooking.
So the waiter brought a me cheese enchilada and chicken taco even though I ordered a beef enchilada and chicken taco I informed him of this and he looked at me in the face and asked me if I wanted a side of beef.  I will not be back
Love scottsdale quarter and this store by far has the best semi annual sale selection. Organized, clean and I got wall flowers for $2 refills what a huge reflection will be back! A great asset to the shopping center!
Very friendly staff. Store smells awesome. Wife loves it. Do I need to say more?
We have used Target Optical on and off over the years depending upon our insurance coverage. In the beginning, I was very skeptical about using a eye doctor in a clothing/food retailer but in the end they won me over with their service and prices. Nice job!
Hadn't been here in years!  The views are fabulous and the band was great.  Beer was cold, food was really over priced!  Lower your prices and improve the service, please.
I don't write reviews, but I had to so that people would know this place is NOT a 4 star worthy Chinese restaurant.
Good on the usual suspects but other than that don't get too crazy on the others.    Service not good
Will never go to this place again.  Gross is an understatement.  Had to send my dish back as it made McDonalds look good.  Strange atmosphere.  Don't reallyfeel like going on about this place as it sucked.  Just don't go.
Agree with earlier review from Greg except service was worse than poor and entree was hot, but sides were cold; obviously sat on plate waiting for entree. Restrooms are located in the hotel lobby, nowhere near restaurant; needed a tour guide to get there! Terrible experience!
Juice bar does not wash the produce. I asked why and they said since its organic we don't wash it.. Be careful or insist that they wash the produce.. This is a health hazard and extremely dangerous for the elderly and children.
Amazing choices. Friendly staff.
This place isn't classy and has a Ross in it for crying out loud!! But...I am en love with Fredrick's of Hollywood!!! You won't find a Nordstrom in this mall.
It's ok. Prices or not cheaper than regular prices.
Not the greatest mall in the valley, but also not the worst! Decent selection of outlet stores and an ok food court. They recently added an aquarium which I think will add to the appeal. It's a shame that they closed Gameworks.
Riva's has great food, large quantities for low, low prices.  They're open 24 hours a day w/a drive through...I eat here at least once a week!
Had the mini eclair and cannoli and unfortunately it was nothing noteworthy.  They aren't located in a fun area and the business seems to focus on decorative wedding cakes.  However the person who helped us was super friendly!
Love the meals they Are the best sea food in the Arizona area
Downhill is the key word - I don't know what happened to this particular location but I am shocked they stay open. The crab cakes are abysmal and just about everything else is at best mediocre. Spare yourself and go elsewhere.
Same Kyoto bowl, in fact it was a time warp going in.  I had not been to one in years, looks the same, but well worn.  Food is still good, but a bit pricey for what you get.
Val and Bill are the bomb! Great friendly service and fresh delicious food! Chorizo made on site!
I took my cousin here to get her phone serviced. The greeter had no idea what he was doing. 20 minutes later we got some service but that was questionable as well.  Instead of replacing the phone they supposively fixed it but guess what......nope!
The Streamliner (veggie) burger and Grilled Chicken Breast Sandwich were good, but the shakes are out of this world!!  They stole the show.  I got the Strawberry Banana and my friend got the Orange Dreamsicle! YUM!
So Indie its going to make me drive to Tempe lol Love the vibe here. Reminds me of The Jamaican Blue that use to be in Scottsdale. Good mix of a crowd, indie, punk, 70s sounds. Its great
My fav all time coffee destination in Tempe. It's a fabulous place to do homework and socialize.
I found Dr. Waring not particularly attentive to my needs as a patient.
My favorite Mongolian BBQ joint in the Phoenix area. HUGE HUGE portions, the only place where they let you smash the meat with wax paper, so much sauce and even the side bar is delicious. DO IT and I dare you to finish everything in your bowl.
This place is missing one key ingredient:  Flavor.
This place is great and the service is outstanding. I had never been here before and the manager personally helped me. I will definitely return
Good food. OK prices. Just hope you never have a problem you want resolved because the management is no help whatsoever. You can't expect much from someone who manages a grocery store though.
Great layout.  It almost seemed like their bar had different venues.  Great food & selection of beers too.\n\nI was amazed how awesome the service was.  We went on a really busy night.
Back to the sweet tomatoes we know and love, but the updated dishware and decor remain for a classier feel. Recommended!
Havent had any problems (lost or damaged clothes...) with them.  My stuff is always ready when they say it will be and it always comes out looking sharp.  Good place with reasonable pricing.
I love this little coffee shop. Amidst all of the commercial coffee places around, this seems down to earth and unassuming.  The barista is always friendly.  I like to support local businesses and would, by far, support Gold Bar than Starbucks located across the parking lot.
oh my god worst pizza I've ever had. Tasted worse than school cafeteria pizza. Ordered a small at 2 bites and immediately stopped eating. DISGUSTING
Love Wendy's new salads and burgers. This was my first visit to this particular location and I found it to be very clean. I felt bad for the guy running the cash register because no one was helping him but he was very polite.
The wife and I stopped here for a bite and beer and was surprised. The steaks we ordered were huge and very tasty. Overall good beer selection and great service from Robin made foe a great evening.
Great pizza at a good price.  It isn't exactly like the Chicago style that I had in Chicago (an upside down pizza), but it is the closest I have found in the valley.
I hate myself every time I wind up shopping here. Having to lock up my purse, indifferent staff, high prices....  plus they carry very little sterling and charge through the nose for what they do have.
Generous portions and good sweet and sour shrimp but nothing extraordinary about their fried rice or lo mein
Went in on a Groupon, food was good but also greasy, but not enuff for me to go out of my way to eat there. \nWent there at lunch, it was dead, but yet took forever to get our food.
Best Mexican Food in the valley!!!  Yummmmmmy!!!!!!  Super nice family!!!!
Amazing service! I just moved to Arizona and my A/C went out, took my car in and they had it fixed the same day! The price was very affordable and Victor and the staff were very professional, definitely sticking with this shop for all my car repairs!
I don't know where everyone was but this is a rad little place. Pretty good food, cheap beers and quite delicious. Very personable staff as well. I enjoyed my visit.
1 star from the vegan perspective, as they use whey (an animal protein) in most of their breads, including their white and wheat sub breads. Please drop the whey (and all other animal products) from your breads!
Ted's is hands down my favorite place to eat hotdogs! Go during lunch hour and you may be standing in line for a little while but it's well worth the wait. Great service along with great food and decent portions, you can't go wrong.
Disappointed as I was told this was one of the BEST hot dogs ever.  We got an all beef and white hot.  Not the worse hot dogs we've had but not the best.  They do however have REALLY GOOD onion rings!
Really, the appeal is the view, which is fantastic.  The food was ok.  The atmosphere was ok.
The fried chicken wings are good.  The rest?  Below par Chinese MSG.  I might get some wings sometime, but the rest of the food is below mediocre.
Excellent prices and the people working there are friendly. CLEAN inside unlike other Mexican rest's in the area. The taste of the food is at top game and love eating at this place!
Was in there picking up my items as the older guy sat there talking trash about their customers. Also overheard in his conversation was a threat to take them outside and beat them up for complaining - as I looked at my messed up stitching... Will never go there again.
Also went here and there phos free is 60 and everywhere else is 29.99. Wayyyy overpriced
Nice, clean, friendly, and close to home.  And they don't charge a fortune.  Can't complain!  I'll be back :)
I would not go back to this place, even though it is close. It looks run down and dirty inside, both in the waiting areas and exam rooms. I did not feel very confident in the skills or assessment done by the doctor or the staff. It seemed quick and not very thorough.
This place is ok
Best gym ever. They have so much here its crazy. If you want a gym that more than just a \"gym\" come here. I have been with my personal trainer Max for a year and love it. \n\nI would highly recommend to anyone.
The GM at the Tempe location is absolutely horrible and has no clue what he's doing.. He's a baffoon and was supposed to be fired a long time ago
I've been going to Lani for a while and she is always laughing and smiling. She makes you feel comfortable right away. She has great prices and you can tell she cares a lot. I wouldn't go anywhere else!
I went to Just For You to get a wax and I was SO nervous! I saw Tamye and she made me feel so comfortable.  I was pleasantly surprised at how painless it was.  She was so amazing and I'll definitely be back.  Thank you so much Tamye!!
Great place for big meals @ a great price!
Great service, fast lunch on a work day.
down grading to a one star due to the fact that I have had a few people email me on here letting me know they too have gotten sick from this place! Eat at your own risk! Don't say I didn't warn you
Make your bowl. The place was big and clean. Very polite staff.
This used to be the best pizza in the valley.  The last two times we went we were disappointed.  The first time the pepperoni had no flaver.  This last time the italian sausage had no flavor.  The basic pizza is still good.
I got food poisoning after eating at this location, I almost went to the hospital after about 12hrs of vomiting and diarrhea. I will NEVER eat Arby's again
what a messy place! If you want to look a good bargain you have to look carefully because everything is chaos! Even Big Lots has more order. Not worth my time.
DO NOT GO HERE!  Watch out - they will ruin your clothes and then give you the biggest, most expert run around you can ever imagine if you try to get them to replace them.  The owner is a blatant lier and she will rip you off.
It's a chain, so I know the food is decent. I'm mostly turned off by the fact that I couldn't come here to watch a baseball game. No sports package at a popular burger place? I'll be going elsewhere for dinner.
Disgusted by server who goes by the name of \"Mike\" and how he served my children!!!!!!!!
Service was excellent by Jessica & Emily in the bar! Very disappointed that they don't offer anything for our Veteran's, being that it is Memorial Day weekend.. Take care of our Veteran's and I'll give  but only one star for now!!!
This place is nasty. A have friends who recently contracted food poison from their bone in wings. Someone in that kitchen isn't cooking food right. I'll never go back. Drive to a different location.
Loved the stadium recliner seats - this is a super KID-friendly area and the theatre was packed with the wee ones. Good if you're in the parent zone, but if you're not....
I had a great pedicure and it was only $20! My tech took a really long time making my nails look great, so I felt like I got my money's worth.  Only complaint is that they could use some new chairs.
They got great service but they have slow wifi download rate......down is 1.10 mps and up is 0.60 mps .... That sucks... Lol
At nails of the world they actually care about u as a person. They do great work & my polish never peals. They are Always friendly. I've been going there for a couple years now & I would recommend nails of the world to anyone of my friends & family.
It's a Target. You know the drill. Clean, well stocked, good prices. I'm a regular.
Always a great place to bring our little one (4 years old) Games are Fun, pizza is always great. Prices haven't changed much over the years. Highly recommend for anytime of day and any occasion.
This place has really good halal kohbedays.  However they close pretty early and are not even open on Sunday's . There hours are M-S 11-9.
What can I say.... This is hands down one of the best places to eat!  Visit probably once a week and always request the same waiter.  Service is great, food is excellent, prices are perfect!
Their green chile burritos are great! Enough for my husband and I to share too. Really love the chips and salsa! Better than many other places!
I do not give 1 star reviews lightly, but this business is beyond unprofessional.  Their business practices seem to change with the mood of the owner, and it is the customers who suffer.
Having car problems is already bad enough. Labor was expensive but expected for a franchise. Customer service on the other hand was awful.
Not bad, a little oily. Not sure that I like it. Might have to try it again.
It's pretty standard chain. Service leaves A LOT to be desired and you'll definitely find better.\n\nTurnaround is quick though and I don't spend a ton of time in the area so it's a quick go to that's right there.
Trashy dive bar,.gross skanky waitresses who think they are hot,mediocre food, terrible service, only good thing is cheap drinks during happy hour.Also rude doorman.Not worth it.
The pool looks nicer than it used to. Music still sucks.
Please update your hours on Yelp. We stopped by to get something framed at 5:32pm and you were closed even though it said 6pm on Yelp.
an absolute atrocity to all that is good and edible. you will see bundt cake straight from KFC. and what is up with the sushi roll with strawberries in it?!
$13.83 for a Tosted mac & cheese No meat.... but they charge like if it had shrimp!   I won't order this again. .. over priced, small portion,  and it's not even the best I ever had.
The sushi was not at all good. The service was on the poor side. Our one and only visit was not enjoyable.
Nothing special, really.  The prices were great, especially the $5 Sake Bomber special.  But overall, the food was just not sexy at all.
Eh - not bad...but not anything to write home about.
Wife and daughter ate here and got food poisoning. They had the shrimp lo mein. Beware!
I love this place - I was so happy to finally find a decent restaurant in the West Valley.  Love that its a local business.  Pizza is great and I've heard so many great reviews about the rest of the menu.  Great casual local neighborhood restaurant!  Great customer service and prices too!
The cheapest, most tasteless mexican food I've ever had. Very greasy,\nhorrible cheese.
Any type of fresh bagel and bagel sandwich you can think of. They are always fresh and use only boars head meats and cheeses. New York style deli that is simply delicious.
Superb bagel just wish they would cut back on the salt. Then I could patronize them more often.
If you're craving for bagels or breakfast, you need to go here and eat every / any bagel you can think of.
We went here for lunch while on vacation.  The food was great and the portions were quite large.  3 of us at for $30 plus tip.
Had some calamari tempura and a couple sushi rolls. Nothing was bad, but nothing was particularly memorable either. All of the staff was extremely pleasant.
Best creamy chicken pesto pasta I have had in a while.  Steak and pesto is also an option.  Great atmosphere and lighting.  Fast service and bread is to die for.  A nice Italian eatery in a Safeway shopping center.
It's hard to get pasta wrong. Its also hard to stick out. Babbo does neither. A distinctly average yet affordable dining option located north of the 101 loop. They have lunch specials and decent pizza and wine.
Went early tonight, Wed., to beat the crowd but we beat the main cook. Salad was wilted, main course lacked flavor other than the taste of the scorched vegetables. Our previous visit was just ok but this was our last visit.
Incredibly rude service from Andrea on Sept. 13. Clearly annoyed I was\n\"interrupting her\" to make my purchase. I will not use this location ever again.
Worst store I've ever been to. They never have anything in stock, they refuse to honor discounts, and they have the rudest staff I've ever encountered. Hope this place goes out of business.
Don't bother if you care about customer service. One stylist for the entire place resulted in two walkouts in 20 minutes. Amateur hour.
So now that I've been here multiple times, I must say that the rude worker was probably having an off day. Every time I've been in here everyone has been super helpful, it's always clean & everyone is friendly. LOVE TJ's!!
The sushi rolls are kinda thin. I heard a lot of good things about this place. I only found it to be ok. I was not that impressed. I'd go again but it wouldn't be my first choice.
No stars! Walk to the restroom and see the salsa and so called bean dip sitting on the counter with the dirty dishes and other cleaning equipment. I should have left then. Seriously on the cusp of calling the health dept on them.
We love going to this restaurant for lunch or dinner.  The chips, margaritas and food are Deliciouso'
Was a big fan until yesterday. Hot sauce used to be the best, now just tasted like tomato sauce. Food was awful, they're only excuse was that they are training new chefs. Sadly, we will not go back.
Huge selection of beers.. Ambiance is also great.. food is awesome....try the chicken nachos...just awesome !
I really like shopping here.  The clearance racks have some great finds at decent prices.  It is the only section I would buy from (well other than the skin care counters) though, cuz prices are steep in my opinion everywhere else in the store.
service is ok.\nfood is ok...actually really bland and plain. I had the blackened salmon and my parents had the roasted turkey breast.\nchamomile tea is the best.\n\ngood luck.
Good, small portions. Pricey for simple foods. Nice environment.
Rude & uninformed staff.   Sales girl did not know what an insurance appraisal was.
The food isn't all that great and the Mac n cheese taste like that cheap powder cheese and the staff act like they where scared to come serve us maybe because of our skin color. The place wasn't very impressive I won't be back. I tried it once that's it.
Place is a joke. Screwed up drive-thru order, food is disgusting, hard, dry. Wont answer phone. Calling MasterCard to do a chargeback.
Stopped on the way to Payson.\n\nI was hoping for a good traditional down-home breakfast. What I got was denny's quality
Breakfast is all pre-cooked.  Ham boiled.  Ordered bacon well but it comes however it is cooked prior.  No special orders here.  Not that cheap either.  Just fast, that's all!
Only reason they get two stars is because their pies are great. Terrible service and don't have enough people working so it takes half an hour to get anyone to even acknowledge that you are waiting.
Today this cafe suck for customer service.. The wait staff is clueless on the customer experience. The food is okay but there better choices up the road.
The worst fries I've ever had! The best pulled pork Reuben. The banana cream pie needs bananas in it or else it is just a cream pie. The crust was non existent! Overall disappointed dining experience!
Every time I go here there is always something wrong with my order always check your food before you leave I guarantee you will always be missing something or something ain't right.
I've been here twice now and I'm not very impressed.  The service is slow and even when there is clearly no one else in the restaurant.  The food wasn't much better, it was ok, but a bit expensive for what you get.
We loved this place a few years ago, but great food is on the menu but exiting the kitchen. Both of us here and I eat alone.
Decent food that you'd expect from a local restaurant that specializes in Mexican food. In short nothing to write home about...
I love eating there breakfast here. Country boy is my fav. Love the steak and hash brown casserole. My order was almost perfect except i got wheat bread not white, i don't like wheat but no big deal. Mike my server was great, friendl, and nice
The staff was friendly and accommodating. I had an arrangement made for my grandma. After I left I looked at the flowers and some of the roses edges were dried/dead. I think the flower arrangement was over priced for what you what you got. :-(
I dare you to find a better burger, chili or steak for the price. I love this place. It has a Grain Belt bar light. Need I say more?
Our waitress was a grouchy bitch, and there was no fresh OJ, but other than that it was OK.  Loved the sign at the register that read \"No Open Carry\" of weapons.  Hahaha!  I was concealing, anyway...
Jerry with Time Saver is a true professional. Honest, relaiable and has the experience most people only dream about. \n\nYou will not be sorry you called Time Saver for your plumbing needs.
Awesome place all around!
*  Very dirty dinning area!!\n*  Employees obviously do not care about customer service \n*  McDonalds should pull their affiliation - very bad representation of the brand
I went here yesterday and ate at Dillion's BBQ, I had a tiny issue with my food and they fixed it instantly and it was perfect. The manager was great with me, and I will defiantly be back
Rode over on our Harley with some friends. We enjoyed a great tasting lunch and a couple brews. Seems be out in the middle of no where... but we like these kind of places. Bet the place is jumping on the weekends, have to make it back some Saturday evening.
We stopped here on tour one time.  And then one time again on the way back.  Had a nice meal, some beers, some shots, hung out for a bit.  Everyone working there was really friendly.  If I'm ever headed through again I'd definitely stop in.
I have been going to the El Dorado Hot Springs for years and always have a relaxing time. Open your minds and give it a try...you won't be sorry\nMakes for a great \"day trip\"....lets relax
Staff here is usually very nice and helpful and not overbearing. Everything is kept nice and tidy. I just feel that this location does lack in variety and sizes...
terrible conditions in prime time of year. mickey mouse layout. skip it.
I have been coming here for years. Best bakery on the west side. Huge variety. I just can't decide what I want when I'm there since everything looks so delectable and fresh.
Absolutely the best customer service ever!!  They always have the best rates and great vehicles.  I would recommend them over and over again!
Ehh its ok!! The location at bell & reems is 10x better!! Better service there & better drinks. This one is okey..
Slowest and most disorganized Starbucks ever! 25 minutes for 2 regular coffees and a pre-made spinach wrap.
In the store today 2 times.....first AND last! I have never experienced such an unfriendly staff & the store is a mess.
Pretty decent location for a nice target store.\nWhen I lived in the area I would frequent this target location and was happy with the service and product selection.\nLocated in the surprise town center shopping district alongside many great shops.
Very good food!! A nice, clean and very friendly place. Prices are reasonable for authentic Mexican food. We have eaten there many times and always look forward to going back.
First arrived and the family a little bored. The staff was nice but the displays need to improve. Great building. Luckily the simulation our family signed up for saved the day. We had a great time with the simulation crew. End if day it all worked out great and family happy.
Call ahead. Eat lots of rolls. Get the double pork chop, and you will be in heaven. \n\nKey is to call ahead.\n\nIve never had a problem here and always loved my food.
food is still good, but the set up is ridiculous, yeah put the soda and ice cream right next to where the soups and pasta are to cause a huge log jam of people. Also had a hair in my salad, not cool.
This Jack's has been closed!  Thank goodness since we got food poisoning from this place!  YUCK!
love the food
Average to poor food. I've had orange chicken, a salad, and chicken enchiladas. They all sucked. They all cost more then they should have.
Super cool bar, friendly staff and very comfortable environment. Drinks and food are both very affordable and delish. Great happy hour specials too. It's s small establishment so it can get busy. But it's always fun no matter what.
It's a good thing that this place is not closer to where I live or I would weigh 400 pounds.
We bought a couple of party trays for my birthday and I have to say, it can feed a whole battalion. Not only was there a lot of food, it was also delicious, as usual. Thank you, Greek Wraps!
The food is amazing here. I've been here a few times and love it every time. I ordered the gryro platter and it comes with a Greek salad and rice. I have to say everything was delicious.
So yummy! I get 1 gyro and order an extra pita. They put enough meat in 1 that you can split into 2!
The prices are a little high and the food is ok. I have had better pizza. The wings where also ok. The people where nice both times we have eaten there.
Have been here to dine a few times. and went for happy hour on a friday night.  Very decent prices and the food is great. The place was busy but we are able to belly up to the bar. Will be back for sure.
Great service, lots of tasty options spinach enchiladas were delicious also chips and salsa they give you are great, the green salsa is my favorite! Will be back to try more.
Two stars just because the chips and salsa are good. But everything else was horrific. It tasted like frozen crap, covered with velveeta cheese. Rice has no flavor and the refried beans were oddly crusty. We will never go back.
Whataburger has a decent burger, but is definitely not one of my favorite places even for fast food. This location hasn't been too busy on the few occasions that I have dined here though, so it has been quick and convenient for me.
You can rarely go wrong here.\n\nLove the chips & salsa!\n\nHave become a big fan of Boneless Buffalo Chicken Salad!
Love the outdoor patio!  The perfect venue for relaxing with music and a cold beer.
Great food.  Very clean.  If you have special dietary needs they are able to accommodate just ask nicely.  Try them you won't be diss appointed.
This subway has terrible service. The food is just ok and the space is not well kept.
Food was bland.  Service was slow.  Screwed up my bill - chased me down in the parking lot to get me to come back to pay more.
It's a Taco Bell and Pizza Hut Express combo, what more could you really ask for?!
I didn't think it was very good. We got the chicken fried rice, paper wrapped chicken, shrimp pad thai & sesame chicken - none of which was really good. The fried rice was horrible. I don't know why this place is so busy.
It's just ok.  At first, the food tasted pretty good, but as we settled into the meal we found it to be quite greasy.  In fact, my wife got sick from the meal while I only had an upset stomach.  I think we'll have to find another place.
After reading the reviews for this place me and my roommate decided to stop by for lunch. The lunch specials are priced very nicely (6 bucks) and the portions are filling. The service was choppy but the woman had her hands full with her baby girl. I would come back.
Great environment and great price. Ask for Zulma or Rachel. Zulma can do a killer fade.
Pretty good pizza.  This place isn't far from my house, so I'll probably go back.  Not as good as my beloved Grimaldi's, but it's plenty good for the price.
My parent's love this place and now, so do I.  It is New York Style pizza (thinner crust and longer slices) very much like we got back home in NY.  Dont let their prices deceive you as it is pretty good!
This is a great hotel. They have an awesome pool. It is in a good location. The maids are always nice and clean the rooms well. The rooms are nice and comfortable. I have come here with my family 3 times and it has always been great.
CLOSED!  AND THE BIG SLIDES REMOVED??\n\nNot sure what is going on here, looks to be some renovations I'll be totally bummed if they lose the big slides.
I got a good haircut and style at a decent price. The girl did what i asked when i showed her a picture. Theres a special right now - 7 foil highlights,cut, dry, waxed brows all for $60!
This Borders closes very early compared to other stores and is always low on stock.  You can never find anybody to help you find something, but the line is short and the clearance section is nice.  The bathrooms are so-so.  The music selection is great and so are the DVDs.
No longer a hand car wash place. I had to drive my own car through. (Guess I have to try the 7 Hills hand car wash place.) This place still has great greeting cards, though!
I just stopped by and the premises were sealed by an eviction order dated 15 June---but then next to it was an order to stay the eviction dated 21 June.  The door was still chained.
Guacamole is made at the table half assed server is rushed and unpleasant. If  I wanted shitty guacamole I could of made it at home for alot cheaper very disappointed I will never go back and it was super expensive for shitty guacamole
We were at the Wildhorse for a fundraiser a few weeks back. The course was in phenomenal shape and the team running the Wildhorse was up to par! We had massive requests in which all were fulfilled with a group of 400. A great place to attend a round or organize an event
Didn't know smogs took an hour
Extremely courteous and expedient. Fixed my tire for no charge. A+
These people have had my business for quite awhile now and they will continue to receive all my business.  From greeting you at the door with a bottle of water to the quickness of service, they excel above all others.  I recommend this place to all.
Never disappointed eating here. Friendly service, hot and fantastic tasting food.  I especially like the spicy chicken bowl.  You can have it with a fountain drink for under $6, what a bargain.\nI want to try their breakfast one day.
Ordered the roast pork menehune. Looked like TV dinner.  Not coming back. The Siamin was horrible.
Very friendly staff. Little to no wait time. Helped me quickly get a replacement bank card when mine came up missing. Very easy to work with.
Bugs in my salad and vomit in the bathroom urinal. After showing the manager the chef came out and half ass apologized and said he's seen worse. Clearly they have high standards...
The only thing that I can say is YUM! I love the pancakes, the waffles and the service.
Clean place, friendly staff. The only negative thing I can say about the place is they typically have 1-2 printers down.
Best place to get a reasonably-priced meal with the freshest ingredients. The place is always clean and the staff very friendly and helpful.
Best gyros I have ever had.  \"thumbs up\"
Fat salad is a fat ripoff.   So is 2.50 for a drink
Sport Chalet only gets two stars from me because they do not carry ammunition which I was looking for on Saturday. I must say though, the staff was very friendly. The gentleman I spoke to did not hesitate to refer me to Dicks Sporting Goods. I appreciate the honesty and lack of excuses.
Register service was not pleasant. I'm not sure if the girl who rang me up just didn't like me, but she was nice to everyone else until I got up to her.
Stevie at the print/copy shop is awesome! She bend over backwards to help me and got me out of there quickly with exactly what I wanted at a price I fully expected.
Hair in my salad. No refills. Didn't ask how my food was or how my steak was cooked. Unpleasant waitress. Need I say more?
Really poor service, I fixed an appointment for test driving 2 cars. After being made to wait for over 90 minutes, they informed me that one of the cars has been sold and the other one cannot be found. Worst experience ever
My food was just ok. Not exactly what I ordered. Asked for ham but got bacon. The service was very bad. I had to flag them down to fill up coffee and they acted as they were doing me a favor. But the coffee was good. I may give them another chance.
Hadn't been here for a while and decided to get some food to go.  Fish and chips was good.  Wings tasted like they had been cooked in old oil and the French Dip was horrible - the meat was as tough as shoe leather!  Will NOT eat here again!!
Horrible job on my nails!! Never go there! I had a smudge and the fixed it by putting three extra coats on and then the polish still smudged!
I ordered for delivery, they did not include cheese on my sandwich, the pizza was stone cold, but the worst part was how rude the worker was when I called.  I will never do business with them again even if they gave me everything for free, HORRIBLE
I would not go to or order a pizza from this place. Raw pizza when asked for well done. Employees have a bad attitude the worst pizza restaurant in Southern Nevada. I will never go back to this place.
One of the best pizza places in town great food! good value! Im from the East Coast it's really hard to find a good pizza place tastes as good as theirs!
make sure you check the price on the shelf AND when they ring you up. very misleading and disappointing.
Went for lunch recently. The appetizers were good, but the main course was terrible. The beef broccoli was extremely bland and thee pad Thai was simply disgusting. There are several other Chinese and Thai places in Henderson that are far better.
I thoroughly enjoyed this place. Really nice people run the place and it's relatively inexpensive. I had the pad see ew, the mint chicken and the tom yum soup. Their soup is probably the best tom yum I have had in town.
Draft shouldn't be blank.
Terrible wings and service was not great. Waste of money the waitress was nowhere to be found anytime we needed anything.  Also she was too busy rubbing her stomach to pay attention to her customers!  NEVER AGAIN HOOTERS!!!
Horrible service, 30 minutes to get dry steaks and it was not even crowded in the restaurant! What a waste of money to dine here! Trust me people do not waste your time or money at Sonoma unless you want your night ruined
liars, thieves, dont keep their word and are worse in customer service. i will never return again and neither will my friends or family. i love toyota vehicles, but i will have to invest in a honda.
Worst bank/cu I've ever used. Fees for everything!! They're just crooks trying to rip off hard-working people.
Among my favorite places to eat. Fair price, great food, outstanding service, \"hot\" means hot. The staff is always friendly, my glass NEVER hits half empty and I drink ALOT of water. They also almost always give my kids free desert. They are awesome.
Boy how things have changed.  The staff and menu are the same, but the way the food is prepared is completely different (not in a good way) and the service has become very slow.\n\nI'm not sure what happened, by I hope they get their act together.
Absolutely disgusting.  Ive been here before and it was good. I just tried it again and got pad thai. The chicken was old and smelled and the shrimp was overcooked and not cleaned. I will never return and wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
Awful customer service.  They swear they are a high end store.  All I did was ask for a military discount and they swore I was robbing them or taking it out of their paychecks...come on!\nGEEZ...
The locations in phoenix have chicken we can add to our meal. This location does not. We drove an extra 10 minutes to get here  to find out they don't have chicken was not a pleasant surprise.
Never again , crab cake salad tasted like vomit , crawfish was way to plain and flavorless . Not worth my money sorry .
Have been to Joe's a number of times and enjoyed their food.  We have had terrible service every time, though.  It's worth going because the food is good and the atmosphere is fun.  Just be patient, and your night will be fine.
Great atmosphere.  I like to visit once in a while.
Service is good not to be confused with great, the happy hour specials are awesome draft beer for 3 bucks you cant go wrong , clam chowder is dismal , overall it is ok , waitress could have upsold the beers and explained all the specials a little more ..
KIDS ZONE! Enough said, they will babysit your children as you gamble. IM SOLD! Hotel is clean and the rooms are amazing!
I think for the price of the rooms it is a great place it is very clean and the costumer service is great. Wish the buffet lines weren't so long though!
Highly recommend anyone to go here!:) the staff is really nice and Dr.Goldman is a very good doctor and he's honest,prices are also reasonable. He saved my dog did surgery on her and I'm so thankful for his work!
Very polite service when I called Rakeman plumbing yesterday.  Charlie was at my house within the hour without having to pay a diagnostic fee as with two other plumbers I called.  Fantastic service, polite, efficient and knowledgeable.  Will definitely use again.  Thank you Charlie!
Always excellent service and food at this location.
Super disappointed w/civiche de camarones.  Seriously lacked flavor other than lime.  Nice server, loved the tableside guac & all the chips and salsa.  Entrees took forever.  Exc margarita!  I would eat there again, everyone else liked their food.
Slow service. I thought the food was kind of tasteless. I had to smother it in salsa to taste anything good.
Fantastic atmosphere, great service and the food was delicious. I've finally found a good Mexican restaurant in Vegas!  3 years later...
We are LOCALS. Station Casinos SUPPOSELY love locals. We are not pleased. We were ripped off by a bartender. I will NEVER walk into that dump again. GAME OVER.
No bad room. Ideal size for two people with king size bed.  Looking forward to show tonight. Clean with plenty of amenities.
I have came here a few times to play craps.   Some of the dealers are extremely rude.. I dont know how they make it through there shift with out getting knocked out.   \nBuffet is okay..  oyster bar is great. Movie theater are decent
Staff is nice and friendly but the car wash did a terrible job. They had employees dry my car but when I got home I discovered spots all over. I'll stick to Fabulous Freddy's from now on.
As usual they slop a whole bunch of secret sauce so you can't taste the beef or the rest of the sandwich.  I had the new advertised Rueben and sure wasn't impressed.
Probably in my top 10 things I have eaten in Vegas. I love the Bobbie and probably get one every other week. I did branch out and get a Slaw B Joe and that was unreal too.
Had the carne asada burrito. Excellent service from Ernesto and Gabe. I like the fresh made chips and salsa.
Sadly in this part of own there are not too many steakhouses and over time even restaurants have been going under.  This Outback's food has been consistently good and the service is always on point.
Yes, you can find a cheaper tire. I like this place because they offer a warranty and a bunch of other services with your tire purchase.\n\nAnother great thing - I was literally out of there in less than 15 minutes! Extra star for their awesome service!
DO NOT SHOP HERE!  My wife bought hair for my daughter, and the size was not what was indicated on the package.  They refuse to allow a return or even an exchange because they have a no return policy.  We are out over $100.
Ordered a pizza to go very light on toppings and sauce asked to reorder said no not very good customer service
Crappy service.
This is the worst chipotle that I have been too! The service wasn't all that good, and the portions were the smallest I've experienced. \nThe chipotle Location on Sahara is much better!
SHUT DOWN as of 3/31/2014 by Southern Nevada Health District for having 46 outstanding demerits. I will most likely never eat there again.
I live next to a different Smith's so when I walked into this one and saw how neat and clean they keep it, I was jealous! Freshly baked bread, deli counter, friendly employees and even hot soup that you can eat in the store! Wish I lived closer to it :(
Best green tea! Garlic tuna nigiri. Yellowtail w ponzu n jalape\u00f1o nigiri. Wild salmon. Best spicy tuna rolls. Asakusa roll is redic! Dessert great too!!!
Great sushi, first place i goto when i get into town, all you can eat is awesome. The staff make you feel wecome and also give some great suggestions if you cannot make up your mind from the vast selections of roll's
Average food. Lack presentation, ingenuity, and tasty. Taste like something I've picked up from a grocery store.
I know I gave Roberto's 5 stars but Fausto's is way better. They are just a lot farther away from my house. I love their carne asada and chips and cheese. Great place for a quick bite of tasty and blessedly unhealthy Mexican food.
The apartments are very nice but the management rips you off!! It's not worth the money to be there.
Came here because dog became sick while driving from LA. Gave great, friendly service. Walked in but did not wait long to be seen. Got examined, medicated, and bloodwork all done within an hour. Reasonably priced too.
Nice location with tough parking and a great patio. Staff is friendly but this location is pretty packed.
Trying to figure out why they charged me $14 for two pairs of dress pants. They did offer me a 10% off coupon bringing the total down to $12.60. Still not good enough.
My sister and I took my mom out for her birthday.   They changed their menu  not happy about the new menu.   We had asked our server to do something special for her birthday and never did.  The service was not great either.
Super crowded but worth the wait.
The Best place in town hands down. I  bring everyone I know when they come to visit and they always want I love sushi when they come back.
I don't usually review chains, but $8 hot n ready deep dish pizza is seriously good. And only $8!\nDemand was so high on a Thursday night that they kept running out - the stuff coming out of the oven was literally hot and ready!
Very low key kool area. A salon right across and beanch to sit on in front of the wondow. Overall it is like being in San Diego Ca.
I'm totally disappointed. The sandwich was pretty boring. Although they get kudos for slicing the meat right in front of me. Otherwise, there's just nothing appetizing about their sandwiches.
I love the cherry dipped cones!\n\nStill sad they got rid of the cotton candy blizzard- was my absolute favorite!
I had an emergency and these good folks were wonderful. They stayed after-hours to treat me. The staff couldn't have been more wonderful and Dr. Scott Manthai gave me great care and follow-up. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
Quiet, good friendly service, huge food portions. 2 people can share 1 meal.
Good service....room was unique...neighbors next door partied til 6am...security n front desk did everything they could! Lounge is always a fun time...want to try Rumors next!!!
I hear this place is hopping at around 2am.  I were here around midnight, on a Saturday night and it was dead!  The floors were sticky and the service was lacking.  I may try it again sometime but I'm not racing to go back immediatley.
Love this place. Just took down the shrimp rolls and some pho, always good no matter what time.
I prefer the pho at Pho Kim Long over any other pho restaurant in Las Vegas. Very inexpensive and delish! I don't feel overly full and stuffed. I feel healthy leaving. I've never ordered anything but pho #10. Soooo good!!
Pho Kim long took a pho Kim long time to bring us our food.  Food was very ok.  Nothing to write home to mom about...\nWould come here again because of the name....
Great hangover Pho if you ask me!
Pho wasnt all that great, but a great way to cure a hangover...\nbroth wasnt good and the waiters and waitresses forgot alotta things that we ordered.
Boyfriend and I wasn't impressed \nPho was decent \nBut the bun bo hue was very bland. I also had ask for a hot tea Togo and the guy said they don't do Togo hot teas? How interesting
Smelled like they wiped all their tables with dirty smelly rags... I can't eat in these conditions.
Pho isn't alwasy Pho.  You can end up with some terrible broths.  This place is always consistant and super busy.  I like that sometimes I have to wait in line.  It reminds me that I'm not the only one who likes this place for lunch
If you want to wait 30 mins just to place your order, come to this place. Food is great but the service is lacking.
Worst customer service in existence!   It's kinda funny to see this in this day and age.   But,  if of don't mind the attitude the food is good.
i was the first time came to Las Vegas,I was so hugely when I arrived this resturant,I feel bad when I arrived,bad service,late food and bad food,I don't want to came again.
The 24/7 pho spot. I've been here a few times. One time at 7 in the morning they were bumping EDM. Not cool when you're hungover. Other than that, the food is decent.
Food is getting worse and worse every time I came. I get very disappointed even though this is nice place. :((
Jeep wrangler Rubicon 7 Windows and strip on the front. Limo tint on the back 5, MN 35 on the driver and passenger. Total was $160 super nice accommodating folks and the tint looks amazing!
Went there on Friday for menudo but it tasted horrible.  It usually tastes good on the weekend, so not sure if I got an old batch or what.   I am going to try again on the weekend and hopefully it will taste better.
Service guy came right out that same morning I called in. He was friendly and knowledgable. Had my TV repaired that same day. The other TV repair company had installed an incorrect lamp. Now my TV looks great.
One of the best Mani-Pedi's I've ever had. Very clean and professional.
I enjoyed the foot massage and they did great job on my nails
This Starbucks is pretty disorganized.  Every time I've been in this place I wait much much longer in line than I would've if I would've gone through the drive thru.  So frustrating.  This Starbucks needs some management and better cleaners.
Bun Bo Hue.... that is all I have to say. You don't always find bun bo hue with that much flavor but this place has it all. I'll be back for sure
Dont eat here its nasty and they recycle their food.. The only good thing about this restaurant is its damn cheap hhahaha if you are cheap and want cheap quality of food then you eat here you cheap ass hahahah
Got introduce here by my ex boss. Really nice place to have lunch or dinner. Food are great. I'd say A+ to their service. Will come here more often.
Pho broth is no good. Service is no good. There are plenty of other pho places in the area. This one was not worth my time and money.
Video poker, topless dancers, 7 am to 7pm happy hour, the DJ is amazing, best party location in Vegas...enough said
Best Korean BBQ in Vegas. Love their marinated pork belly and squid. Their salad is addicting. Staff is friendly. Can be a long\nwait on weekend nights, but that's to be expected. My go to Korean BBQ spot!
Nothing new at this place, they continue to remove the expiration dates\noff their food products. Someone needs to alert the clark county health department!!!
Unbelievable. How the heck do you run out of crushed peppers and parmesan cheese?\n\nI should've run back in and grabbed a whole roll of those Bounty-like paper towels. Would've served them right.
So unprofessional. Lady that I've never seen there before was talking about her personal business like she was at home. She was venting about something to the others. Her face was ticked off. Keep your personal issues at home and serve your customers!
This was decent comfort food from back home.  Not worth a special trip but, if you're in the area, it is pretty good.
No Complaints with this place! Support the little guy, (last mom and pop shop)  and if you ever need anything repaired this is the place Vegas!
Epoys offer a variety of food and snacks. food are always warm and tasty.\nHowever, this restaurant is no longer in business. a thai restaurant replaced it.
small limited very reasonably priced friendly employees unique speciality items but not intended for your complete shopping needs this location is steady busy with lots of parking
Much better than ANY casino. Great food and service. The menu is fantastic. Breakfast and lunch.   Look for it just west across from Palace Station.
nice place not the best but def not the worst
Staying in the section of the hotel that's considered the courtyard completely nasty and awful.  The smell, look, everything else made Vegas a bad experience to start but we quickly check out and paid 50 dollars a night more and stayed at the Hard Rock Casino & Hotel.
the hotel isn't a looker but having the Oyster Bar and bingo here make it A-ok with me.
Bomb ramen. All the other food is delicious. Always worth the wait. They can always do most specials any day. Love the atmosphere and service. Never have been let down by this place.
The employees and owner here are very skilled at what they do. Santiago is the best man to do tint, and the sales reps will do anything that can to help you with you custom auto needs. I do recommend!
The raisin bread and taro pastry were both very very tasty.
Overpriced food here. The duck was OK, but i wish the skin should be crispy instead soft skin.
Very expensive tourist trap. The food is pure crap.
Be careful when you eat in this restaurant I was order ong choy it has grass in side the food they gave me an other plate the second plate it has more grass then the first plate .and the price so expensive , never again and i recommend don't go to this place .
If you want hepatitis this is a place where you can get it! Totally disgusting from the food to the restaurant and the waiters. This whole place should be bombed with RAID!
Food: Mediocre\nService: non-existence \nPrice: over-priced\nCleanness: I wonder why this place is still open.\nOverall rating: 0.5 star
Out of Business. Building has been vacant for a couple years. Will be torn down as part of the freeway expansion.
I have been here two times. It's not a bad place. Atmosphere is very nice. Waitress was friendly. Food was not bad, pretty average. If I am in the mood for simple Korean food,  would come to this place.
Will always remain one of my 'to go' places when passing through vegas.
Don't know how this chain stays in business. The food they put out is under par and when you bring it to their attention its hilarious to see the look on their face. It just comes from poor or no management.  2 people here and half the table are dirty.
The whole place smells like dirty grease.
Big portions, tasty and some of the best service we have received! This will be my Vegas go-to breakfast place.
Food OK service needs improvement my server took my order wrong and did not check until the end
The waitress was quite nice. The potato chips are awesome. The rest of our food was just ok, nothing spectacular. Place is very old school. It was an ok breakfast in general here ...
Amazing warm banana nut bread and delicious potatoes! The omelettes are huge...consider sharing. Coffee is not the best but everything else makes up for it. Friendly service and cozy place....the restaurant is inside a shopping center not to be confused by the sign.
Banana bread is the greatest on earth! It's worth driving here just for that alone. The breakfast is huge and the price is tiny! My new favorite place!
This place don't need a makeover, it needs a bulldozer.\nIt puts the whole community to shame.
Typical Cap's right next to my place so it's convenient.  The staff are actually nice...shocking I know!
I go here to get my dog food and dog utilities. Staff is nice, if you run into them they will help. The store is always clean!
I went to this location yesterday and I was very disappointed. The lady at the drive thru was very rude.
This is a good solid hobby store. Their stuff is not as complete as HobbyTown USA right across the street but is nonetheless worth a visit if you are in town.
Love supporting small businesses. You wouldn't even know the donuts were Vegan,  they were that good!
I've been coming here my whole life. The zaru soba is good. The sushi used to be better. But I'll keep coming here because I have a place in heart for it.
Really fresh sake. Great rolls. Nice option to get a half or a full roll. Delicious lychee sake. Fast service. Amazing!
Hands down, the absolute BEST Japanese restaurant in Las Vegas! The best sushi I ever had! You can't beat this place. This is what all Japanese restaurants should be measured against. I love this place and can't wait for my next trip to Vegas to go here!
I  went   there  last  Sunday   and  men  !!!   really  god  sushi   I  think  come  back   asap
This laundromat is a good price and has flat screen TVs, video games and a theater in the back. Regular prices. nice washing machines and dryers dried all my clothes for $0.75. Good atmosphere. will be going back. would recommend to friends and family
I really like this jack in the box, the people are always nice and the food is always hot! When I had to wait for my burger, I didn't order a drink i was standing near the register off to the side they handed me a free drink and thanked me for waiting.
Kevin and Tammy seem super nice. Christine has a nasty attitude she does a horrible job. She does not know how to speak to costumers. She really is a b.tch. Tammy had to redo them. Never going back! .
milk tea, fruit tea.. all good. we ordered snacks like peppered chicken and toast that were really good as well. Wanted to get their shaved ice with tapioca strips, but they were out unfortunately. This is my hang out spot almost every night while I was in Vegas!
Service has always been horrible for the past couple years, even when it used to be tea planet. The good boba never makes up for it and their slow staff.
service could be better, or maybe i am used to service back in 626?\n\ntea was alright, too much ice.
I don't like that you can't just hang out here, you have to actually make a purchase of a minimum of $5 or they kick you out. Overall, cute little tea place that's open until 2am.
I visited this location for boba. Compared to other asian boba places, this location is very clean, professional, and organized. I really like the interior of the establishment and the professional business feel. Other boba shops even nearby are very poorly designed and not very professional.
Love this place since it was tea planet.
Today was my first visit to Globe Salon, and I really enjoyed the experience. Sam provided a great consultation, great cut, and several styling tips! I am so excited to have found my new favorite salon in LV!
They called us to come At 2.we waited more than an hour for the assistance .wtf.we made a reservation before.bad service
Mediocre food. Unlimited eating for $30 per day. Go to Belagio buffet for lunch at 3pm instead. $20. Much better. \\
This buffet was way better than than the circus circus no doubt!  Thanks server bobby for making it enjoyable and for getting everybody to sing for my ten year old!!  The food was ok but...my favorite is the eggs benedict and the crab legs!
Philly Cheese Steak gave me heart burn bad!\n\nRather not go here again!
Been coming here for 10yrs. Dale and his team are best. They always go the extra mile for me and are very honest about their price. Thank you for the great service
A great Vegas tradition... it helps that I love frozen custard.  Definitely worth a trip for tourists.
Good stuff, been coming for years. Glad its getting so much hype they deserve to make some money. Do yourselves a favor and dont expect a religious experience or you will be disappointed. Its simple food made fresh on site and very good.
Meh... I thought it was very ok... And the girls working there were rude and seemed very bothered by us. I wouldn't go back
The worst customer service, and the longest delivery time I've ever experienced! After 2 hours the food showed up cold, the fingers were burnt, and the pizza crust was burnt as well. I posted pic's so please view them. Never again to return!
Just went here let me say it was lots of fun , very pact seating wasn't too great, drinks were good make sure you get JOAN he is beyond dreamy, sexy and just BEAUTIFUL you definitely won't regret it!!!!!
lord have mercy on my bowels...the burritos will cause you pain. eat one if you need a colon cleanse. only eat here during the zombie appocolypse
the tacos are off the hook yummmmmmmmy
Disappointing overall.  Spring rolls were unpleasant.  Poor flavor and texture.  Vegetarian massaman curry was okay.  Good spice, overly sweet.
This is a disgusting place which serves a what looks like an hour by hour hotel room.  Don't do it!!!!!!   The staff creepy....like something out of psycho.  Beware!!!!
Amazing company! The best one in Vegas!
Love it here. Classic Filipino cuisine. ok service average decor. Good star rating for its quality of food.
Yep, gonna visit this place if you want a job in service here in Vegas. Pretty clean, nice building, helpful staff. Pretty quick in and out as well.
This is the best Mexican food I've ever had! I literally have to drive across town to eat there! Great food and service!
Staff at this facility are outstanding. The online registration was convenient and easy to complete. Eliminated the stress of sitting in the facility trying to remember the information. Registration was simple..the nursing staff was very helpful and considerate. From check in to check out-  everyone was pleasant and professional.
Back after a few months and they still can't get these Americanos right .   How hard is it?
4 years later, this place is still terrible. Why my mom likes to go here, ill never understand.
Geek squad sucks, no customer service, no order or organization, horrible communication
Crappy service. Good food..... Ordered, then got food 50mins Later then didn't see the Waitress for another 30 mins..... When she dropped off the check...
this ross is beyond rude! will not be shopping here again!
Kind of expensive and you have to work to get your crab out. The don't have the shell crackers, only a zip tool.
I really like this beauty supply store, it's just so far from where I live.  So when I do get to that side of town, I  usually stop in because I know they have something I need or haven't seen, or need to get.
Just your average Wal-Mart what else can I say? Service prices all the same. Nothing different here than any other Wal-Mart.
We went to live to eat taco and I got the cashier service bues these ali does not want to take water from natural and has a bad attitude bad
Yeah, one star for stealing my honey's credit card.  Thank goodness American Express is more loyal to its customers than you people are.  Using his credit card up & down Nellis blvd is retarded. \nEat a dick & gain some integrity.
We came here after a stress-filled morning and were pleasantly surprised. This Denny's is nothing like the one we'd been to previously. The cook actually did a great job, the service was spot-on and the waitress was awesome.
Ok food. Ok service. Left smelling horrible of cigarette smoke.
The staff was nice but didn't listen when our order was taken and some of the order was messed up. Some of the customers were very loud and ghetto. The tables could be cleaned better! I didn't want to go into the bathroom.
Great breakfast joint that reminds me of waffle-house. Do not order anything that could be stored in the fridge as it tastes like it have ( huevos ranchos ). Massive omlettes that are worth the price.
Service is great.  Price is nice and food is good.  The real gem here are the appetizers.  The crispest fried chicken wings, \nshrimp and vegetables you will find anywhere at any cost.  Have not ate buffet...not buffet guy.
One of the worse carne asada burritos I ever had.    I will never go back.   And the salsa?   You've got to be kidding me.    Did you get it from a can?
Awesome place, they have everything, i couldn't believe my eyes. The staff there is amazing!!!
The worst of the worst, did not keep their booking prepaid for a stretch limo.\n\nTerrible customer service by management as they never call you back when a problem arises.\n\nRuined our wedding.
Negative star! This place is the last place you want to go. I went there to get my lab results, they had me wait for 2 hrs just to tell me my labs aren't ready and i had to come back!
Near Chef Rubber they have the large-scale equipment and smaller wares you would need in order to open a food business. They have a lot of dishes, tools, pans for a cheaper price if its what you need.
My favorite place to eat in Las Vegas. Solid BBQ.\n\nTry the Hot Links.
Absolutely the worst meal ever. Catfish was old fishy and the wait staff\" we've had a lot of complaints. It must really be bad\" wth . .burnt ends were crap too. Not fresh at all.
Well the food was OK at best.  Middle of the road BBQ is giving it to much credit.  I'm not a famous Dave fan but its better. Man I miss Missouri.
My brother and I were supposed to go to a movie but ended up stopping by here for lunch. Never made it to the movie but they had good pizza and my brother swears by their ranch.
German pancakes, Swedish pancakes, one side of sausages, two coffees for. $34.  Way too high for OK food.  Long wait to get table when only few customers eating and had to ask someone to send waitress to take order.  Would not return.
The food was excellent. Vegetarian omelets and banana and pumpkin pancakes. Our server, Mary was amazing, attentive and very accommodating and caring.. We will certainly be back again. Thanks Mary and thanks Original Pancake House,
5 dollar foot long
First time here ... it was alright. i ordered the chicken kabob nothing special and nothing bad. The service seemed kinda slow. Chicken was tender the rice tasted buttery. Give it a try you might like it. For me i think i will pass next time.
The foods not for fast food Chinese. It's not as greasy as some that I've had before, so it passes.
This place is very good and has good quality and service and great cocktails.
I stopped to get a quick bite to eat and wasn't disappointed. Beef chow mein is delcious,  it's not the bland stuff you'll find at similar joints.  Orange chicken is also A grade.  Service was quick to us and quick to deliver.
I ordered the garlic chicken dinner special, so good, they packed the take out container, it was so much food! Saved half for later :)
Really not good. I would never come back here. The wait staff was attentive but the food was gross. I don't know why they have an overall 4 stars.
Very nice staff. I really enjoyed my experience here and will definitely bring my dog back for her routine care.
this place is so delicious and cheap.  Very friendly and fast.\n\nAsk for no MSG and free delivery.\n\nThey give you a lot of food.  great for a local neighborhood thai place.
The creamy shrimp soup is an absolute must have.  Everything else I've had is good but a little expensive for your average Chinese restaurant.  Staff is always friendly.
Service was good fast and just like I like it and those who've read me know I like my cheese stakes
The Place is nice the bartenders are good at there job descent food and separate smoking area
Better than taco bell
Staff is rude food is not good. I have been there a few times and have had to take fries back because they were so old or had to go get the rest of my order. Go to another one much better service and better food
Yuk! Couldn't even chew the steak. I love del taco but never have I experience such a disgusting meal. Didn't get past the first bite.
No, no, no, no no!!!\n\nNo water except on jug on each nine. Saw cart girl once in four hours. Greens are terrible. Bumpy, no grass, poorly maintained. I'd never play this course again
I don't golf.  But I live here.
The food was very good and tasty. Portions were big and priced reasonably.
I like what this place does for my nails; especially my toenails. They are thick and hard to deal with at times. Whenever I ask for a design, they always accommodate and have not been rough on me at all.
they have a pretty extensive menu, you would find something to eat pretty easy. The appetizers come in pretty big portions and  their food is very Delicious. They also have an extend wine menu.
I enjoyed a nice manicotti dinner here tonight. We had a group of 12 and I believe everyone enjoyed dinner. Some nice specials were offered. Prices were reasonable.
We've been here a couple of times.  Food is always good and so is the service. We'll definitely be back.
I have been seeing Dr. Weisner for various ailments since May of 2000.  He has helped me recover from a serious car injury, and allowed me lead an active an healthy lifestyle.  \n\nAlways very professional and willing to spend time with you.  Great staff as well!
Small, but had the basics with good quality
Best grocery store in Vegas!
Both dr Martin and swainston are amazing but they are way overcrowded. I'm a little concerned about getting seen and what will happen when I go into labor. When you do see them thy give you their full attention.
What can I say...this used to be my regular as it was cheaper for dinner for two here than cooking on your own.  It's still OK.  Full of Dell Web residents if you get there for an early dinner.  Love Mirna, the waitress that has been there for years!
Worst doctor office. Do not go here. Very rude costumer service and do not care about patient health. By far one of the worst experiences I have ever had.
Best pizza I've found in Summerlin. Lots of fresh toppings and great flavor. Not the cheapest pizza, but worth it.
Very happy with their pizza.  It's my favorite in the city.  The staff is nice and they know what they're doing.  The owner is also very nice.
Banana bread was delicious and the Mediterranean omelet with shrimp and lobster inside was amazing.
The restaurant was closed to the efforts of the anti-smoking Nazi's. The beer is still great but I miss the food.
$6 exterior car wash, and you can find a $2 off coupon online.  Makes for a cheap car wash, except I have to get out of my car to dry off my car after it's been \"dried.\"  You get what you pay for!
Just okay.  My husbsnd hated it but I thought it would do in a pinch, but haven't been back in months.  Soups need improvement.  Staff was nice.
I have been going here since I was a little kid. The food had always been consistent and delicious. Even if I haven't been there in a while, the waitress always recognizes me and knows my order. BEST WONTON SOUP EVER!
This is place is clean the server is very attentive. Food was brought to us within 10/15 after we placed the order. Came for the lunch special they're priced very well. Will definitely come back. Delicious!!
This is a good sushi bar.  Other reviews say the fish is fresh and they weren't joking.  Its a small place with not much ambience, but if you're going there for good sushi, you won't be disappointed.
Best sushi in town. Sad it's such a small location because I'm impatient when it comes to waiting! The Green Valley is my personal favorite!
What can I say but awesome! A bit pricey but the best sushi in town. They have some of the freshest seafood of any sushi restaurant I've ever been to.
We just had a wonderful experience at this lakeside french restaurant! Chris our server is outstanding and the food was amazing too! Highly recommend this great place for brunch!
I love their bagels. Don't like their coffees because Starbucks is better but they have really good bagels and smoothies.
It's a quick meal for lunch, but fairly unappetizing. I am quite unsure why there was such a long line leading to the entrance. It's place I am definitely not look forward to visiting again.
A bit small inside. Bathrooms are clean and food is always great. The boy at the register is nice. There are Roberto's all over town but I prefer this one because of the cleanliness and food consistency.
A city runs through it.\n\nLas Vegas grew around this place, originally a game dressing shop.  Chuck Frommer has expanded it into the best butcher shop I know of.
Don't get scared of the line! It's so worth it! The hot links are fantastic, and the green beans are done so well even a veggie hater will eat them.
Off the charts.  Delicious.  How can a boiled rib taste so good!   Huge portions.  Really nice staff.  Thoroughly impressed.   A must eat local.
Had tri-tip and ribs with macaroni salad and yams. Meat was super tender and flavorful, best barbeque I've ever had. Sides were great, too.
I love this place.. They're sides are the bomb I always get the brisket dinner w/mac n cheese & baked beans..
The food was very good, old school the garlic toast and homemade thousand island dressing were very nostalgic.  The 2x baked potato was huge and the steak was excellent, but the bathrooms!  Please do something about them, it hurt the experience of an otherwise nice Friday night!
Used to be a favorite place to eat for my wife and I until we found a metal screw in my wifes Huevos Rancheros. Dissapointing. I had eaten there for over 20 years. Still a great place to have a beer but I'll never eat there again.
Worst food I've tasted since 1995. Service was terrible and the filet mignon was cardboard. Very disappointed. Will never return
Totally love this place..have been going here for YEARS...they have wood next door you can buy in the cord and a vet who comes in 2 times a month for low cost vet clinic!! SUPER saver!!!
Family friendly activities!\n\nIt was a flashback to my childhood skate parties.  The kids had a blast and the staff was pretty good at keeping track of the floor so the little ones didn't get run over.
Pros:  Self serve and wide variety of concessions.  Beautiful lobby.  \n\nCons:  No drink refills and the theaters themselves are not as nice as Aliante.
Fast service.  Ordered extra crispy chicken.  The food was good as usual.  Will come back again.
this is a fun place to go for a cosume if you are an entertainer or just for fun! They have some new and almost new quality clothing and you can get 30% off if you bring a donation the staff was cool sometime you can find some cool stuff antiques other random stuff.
This review was posted in error and I don't know how to delete it so I am just changing the star rating to five but I have no experience with the shop
Stayed here a couple nights.   Only payed about $40 per night.. room was okay.   Smelled weed walking dow. The hallways..  but what do you expect only $40 a night lol.  Not the worst hotel I been in.
This particular Domino's Pizza is the location I use for delivery when I would like a pizza at home.  They are always prompt and very polite when they deliver, and the pizza is hot fresh and baked perfectly.
If you want your feet to even be somewhat smooth, do not go here. Their $25 pedicure is merely a polish change and hot water soak.
This place is going down the drain. Sad. Great food but service has went down the drain. Won't be back!!
Amazing jewelry store. We've bought and had fixed/serviced our watches, rings etc They are wonderful. Unfortunately Danielle, the lady who usually answers the phone, has poor phone manners. I won't give T Bird less stars though. She just needs to check her tone of voice!
One of the more cleaner 24. But this review is based on the people that go this 24. Gym filled with racist people who will stereotype you based on your race. If you are Asian, you are not welcomed at the basketball court.
Very friendly staff. Great personal service. I needed a minivan. They offered a journey but the inside height was not tall enough for items I was transporting  They drove to another location to bring a minivan back. The went the extra mile to help me get what I needed.
The service was good but the course not so good.  Wouldnt play here again.
first time eating at sonic!  they need to open some of these in the bay area!  had the spicy southwest burger, which has crispy jalapeno strips, with some fries and a cherry limeaid drink.  pretty yummy!
Could not find out what was wrong with me. Bad bedside etiquette. Never found out what was wrong with me after 20 visits, always felt rushed and that he had better things to do.
Low expectations which are usually exceeded.
Stopped in this place and could not get past the lack of cleanliness and the terrible odor upon entry. This location definitely needs some attention to detail and cleanliness. We decided not to eat here based on the lack of cleanliness.
I ordered the Pan fried noodles (Hong Kong Style) - it was alright. I've had better. Place lacks service.
All I gotta say is.....YUMMY IN MY TUMMY!!!!!!  =)
Discount after 10pm which is great for me =) I eat late.
So disappoint... We ordered a live lobster but It turned out to be a dead one. Ruining my taste.
The food was really good!  Great spice!  \n\nReally enjoyed the meal!
We came here for Thai food with one $. It was a little pricier than expected and servings weren't generous. Decor is cute. Space is tiny. A-ok if this is your neighborhood Thai spot. No need to go out of your way.
That sundae is ridiculous. DO IT!
Love, Love, Love this place.  Always consistent.  Happy hour is a Steal!!! This place has always been in my top five!!
Loved this place. The duck tacos were fantastic. Also I would highly recommend the messy sundae.
Its ok compared to the restaurants in Socal. the service is average. but i don't know if its just me but it seems like the wings taste different.
This hotel doesn't have the glamour of other hotels on the strip if that's what you're looking for, but the dealers were very courteous and made great conversation as well
Pretty bad atmosphere. I have been waiting for 30 minutes with 8 other people to sit at a 3 dollar 6-5 blackjack table and they won't open another table or even a $5 table.
When you want wings, you want to head to Hooters...try to get seated in Ashley S's section (preferably when Mike Lee is working) and you'll get INCREDIBLE service matched only by Ashley's adorable smile!
Love this place! Their pho has that traditional home made Viet taste and very fast and good service. Highly recommended.
Perfect Pho! Stock was seasoned just right; the meat and noodle was just the right portion. Nothing you could ask for more.
Food very good ,place very clean
I could not have been more pleased with my experience here. They are fast, prompt, and extremely thorough. Make sure you ask for Taylor as your hygienist. She was absolutely amazing and you can tell she has a passion for her career.
The food was mediocre. the selection was very limited. my husband thought it was good,is why I gave it 2 stars. The squid was rubbery. the egg drop soup was barely warm and had corn it. Yuck!!
This service is great! I don't trust anyone with my son but I felt comfortable using this company. Olivia was our nanny for the evening and I think she did a fantastic job and was very attentive. Sarah, the owner is one of the nicest people out there :)
Dr Arnold is a no-nonsense professional. His staff are always friendly and courteous. I would highly recommend him.
No air conditioner! We all sweated as we ate, it's an oven in here!! Worst mc Donald and dinning experience of the summer. How can you have the dinning room open when you have no air and it's over 100 degrees
Walk in on sat. Nobody was up front and nobody helped me. So I walked out. Do not go there.
Good sushi place, prices are reasonable.  Nothing outstanding, but it a good place to go and I will be going back again.  The service was outstanding, although I did go at lunch and there were not many people there.
Not bad... the Restaurant.com coupon helped make this 2 star restaurant into a 3-star.
I have been going here like 3 years.  Lani is the best her pedicures always last forever and everyone always compliments my nails and pedicures.
Fixed my locks, was on time and reasonably priced. I was pleased with the service and the tech did not try to sell me on unnecessary extras.
Very sad to say that the bar was sold to a slot parlor & will be closing before New Years. The staff was good & so was the food. To many stupid slot parlors in this town now!
They microwaved our dim sum in front of us. Depressing. Nothing more to stay.
What the hell... Drove there today and they were closed?!?! The sign over the restaurant was taken down... So confused and sad, this was my spot!!!! I hope it's just temporary for construction. Anyone have any insight?
Sandwiches are great and I've had really nice customer service each time I've visited.
Good for a fast health food alternative than burger king. Busy with people and got my food out fast.
I love coming to Panera! Ashley Love and Luke always brighten my day. The staff here is so amazing and friendly! We have been coming for years. Great food and wonderful service!
We moved here about a month ago, and so far everything has been good! All the staff members have been very kind and helpful. The complex is great, for us and our pets, and we are excited to start enjoying all the amenities that includes. Hope to keep having a wonderful stay here!
It has a very nice, comfy and relaxing athmosphere.  It's like having ur own private dinner.  Excellent customer service.
Slow unfriendly service surprisingly from a McDonald's. Food was not fresh either. Bathrooms were a dirty wreck as if in a roadside gas station. Take your business to a different McDonald's.
It's cool that they brew their own beers. I wasn't a huge fan of the food and beer, but it is a neat restaurant in Pittsburgh!
Big fan of the Church.  Their non traditional pierogies are almost always a great choice, paired with the pizza and their beer brewed on site, this is a must stop when in the Bloomfield area of Pittsburgh.
This place is great. It is cool how they turned a church into a brew pub. The pom frites are awesome and the pizza is good.
Loved the atmosphere and the beer. Great place to meet up with friends and have some good beer and food!
Horrible bar. Horrible crowd. If you're over the age of 22 avoid at all costs.
Good place.  Almost always very busy... Might want to make a reservation.  The chefs don't seem to have a whole of personality.... And they are often times not Japanese at all... But the food is good nonetheless.
Pretty average sushi bar good food, great location. I'm a fan of this place.
Love some Tiki Lounge.\nDrink specials? A waterfall?\nJungle black out time.
I love this pizza
Get me early cuz they go quick! If you get them while they are hot you'll be hooked for sure! Best soft pretzel anywhere!
Ok place for a lunchtime burger or breakfast.\n\nThe food is consistently okay but not great.\n\nThe staff are also ok. \n\nOverall the place is remarkably average in an area with places that are much much better.
Best service I've ever had anywhere!!! I'm from MI and travel the entire east coast all the time. I love Yuengling and they had the best price and were truly kind. I would definitely recomend this place.
OMG\nTerrible even my wife likes vegetarian and hated this \nQuick give me a real egg and meat!! Even sub par for veggie lovers \nThe first experience with a yelp recommendation I was totally turned off by
Are you kidding me?  A vegetarian dream in an odd Antique store?  Yep and fantastic prices and wonderful food to boot.  More than reasonable prices, portions and panache. Seriously, though, this hole in the wall is worth finding.
Holy hell, don't eat at this BK.  It's dirty, crackheads swarm it, there are roaches.  Multiple people I know have gotten very sick from eating at this BK.  If you're craving Burger King, go else where.
Awesome in the single word! Affordable in the second word! Easy to find out whatever you need  gifting shop also can be said. Actually I love books and also this store like due to the service I have taken from them. Taken different types of books mentioned good.
Good strong fresh coffee. Cool but still friendly staff. Unhurried vibe. Super cute decor. Love it here
I wish I could live on Jean-Marc's macarons.  Seriously incredible.  \n\nWe have had Jean-Marc cakes for multiple special occasions, and they are always fantastic.  His buttercream is to die for...actually, everything here is to die for.
The incline is attractive, but the staff were universally rude and treated the customers much like cattle.
One helluva view and fantastic jalape\u00f1o crab dip.  Pair it with some ice cold beer and this place is sure to be a hit during the summer time!
Excellent service and very attentive. Had the loaded fries and grilled chicken sandwich, which were both good. Solid bar food.
Great find!  Visiting from DC and loved the unique take on menu!  Witty and original.  The food was excellent! Can't say enough about the pierogi sliders and the eggplant lasagna!!
Samosas are crispy, slightly spicy and potato-filled. Delicious for a whopping price of $1. Also a great place to buy spices. Wasn't sure where to find turmeric powder but I found it here.
College bar staple with great half-price food, a large menu, and excellent beer specials.
Spinach wrap for lunch was disgusting. Weird, pasty sauce. Whole place seems kind of dirty. Booths need to be wiped down. Don't go here unless you're an undergraduate with low standards.
Typical college restaurant. Food was mediocre for me but a good choice for college kids.  Had the pizza and the artichoke dip.  It was recommended at not that good.
Racist racist racist. I came on a Wednesday for pizza for the first time and the cook decided that it was okay to to start spewing racial slurs and making references thinking I wouldn't hear him. Gross.
I love the lunch specials, esp. the Thursday one that comes with an eggroll, ...good prices, and the soup/hot tea is great comfort food for when you're trying to keep warm and fight off a cold.
The growing number of noodle restaurants is a positive trend but is jeopardized by those who do not put honest effort into it.  I don't know what bouillon can they open to make their broth, but they need to get a stock pot and some bones.
Everything is over-sweet. No resemblance of real Asian food.
A convenient local deli which quickly serves up both hot and cold sandwiches. It's open late.
Fantastic place.  Amazing food, reasonably priced wine list, great service.  One of my favorite places in the area.
I had pants hemmed here and, while the guy did a decent job (though they still ended up too long even though he pinned them while I had them on?) it was absurdly expensive and took A WEEK.  \n\nCome on now.
Great items, great philosophy.
The food is tasty, but so much MSG!  I'm usually not very sensitive to MSG, but man you can really feel it after you eat here!
One of the few nice Chinese restaurants!
I really like this place. I like their pitza, but I usually go with the falafel salad.
Worst Chinese food ever. I totally got sick after eating their take-out.
Great spicy food. If you like spicy authentic Chinese food this place is as good as those in sf.  Try their Szechwan beef with Mala sauce...if you can take the spice
One of the better sushi places I've been to in Pittsburgh!
Best sushi I have had so far in the area.  I am still learning the ropes, but this is authentic stuff.  An authentic decor, authentic staff, and authentic sushi.  It was very very good and the rolls are creative.
The sushi was delicious. The other food didn't compare. If I go back here I would just stick with the sushi. The waitress and other employees were very attentive. Nice atmosphere.
Pretty good food. Interesting location.
Pizza is nothing special. Canned mushrooms, spinach, and shrimp. Sauce and cheese ordinary. We will not go back
Better pizza than any chain.  Better pizza that you would get anyplace other than NYC or Jersey.  BUT, why go here when just up the street is Napoli?  Mineo's has the rep, Napoli has the better pie.
Great place for drinks or to socialize.  Lots of seating around the bar plus tables and booths.  Always a busy joint and they have tons of tvs playing sports to make things better the bar food is cheap and tasty.  If i could id give this place 4.5 stars
Great service. The first reliable and honest mechanic I have encountered to date. Remember a mechanic u can trust is worth his weight in gold. Calfo's is one
Great and honest service. The guys were kind and straightforward, letting me know all that i needed in order to make decisions about my car.  Reasonably priced and quick service (considering my car was towed during a winter morning).  Thankful they were so close!!
Irene is, quite simply, the world's most talented and responsible alterations seamstress.
The food is so so but, the desserts are outstanding especially the turtle cheesecake. I would rather eat at The Cheesecake Factory . Personally I don't see what the be deal about this place is.
I had dinner here with a large business group and it was quite good.
Great food,great atmosphere and view. Very good service.
Very friendly staff. Sucks you have to pay for wifi. Room decor is outdated. The water pressure in the showers was really bad.
Stopped here this morning for some coffee.  The bagels still aren't the greatest--they're okay but not the greatest.  But the coffee is pretty good.  Susan regain human female form after 2nd cup of coffee!
Convenience is the only plus.  Quality and consistency are lacking.
Needed a late night snack after driving all day and this place was across from our hotel.  Pizza was great, crust was cooked just the way I like it, crispy on the edges and lots of cheese and toppings.   Staff was friendly.
I had the special at the servers suggestion.  It was a chicken with stuffing, mashed potatoes, and fresh vegetables.  The veggies were not fresh, the patatoes were undercooked and the chicken dry.
Great pace to relax on lunch break and snatch up some wifi on a couch!
Stayed at the Wm Penn down the street for a wedding and needed a last minute haircut. Friendly, helpful, all around good cut!
The air conditioning in room 1602 didn't work, and the hotel refused to take responsibility. They simply laughed and said that we should have let them know the night before- we didn't get in until 2am- i would not stay here again. Ridiculous customer service.
a cozy breakfast spot similar to dennys or kings minus the shit your pants feeling you get from dennys or kings.  ive only eaten breakfast here cant speak on the other foods but if you can make a bomb breakfast lunch and dinner should be similar.
Just watch where you pick up your produce.
Overpriced and small portions, but oh so delicious. Nice location. Not so friendly staff though.
Took a cab from downtown to catch dinner about 30 mins before their publicized kitchen close time. They closed the kitchen early and said they can't help me. Great. Glad I called ahead of time. Now I'm in the middle of nowhere and starving.
I am not a fondue fan so I wasn't expecting much out of a group meal but our service was extremely slow. I am under the impression they get a lot of groups and we had made a reservation way in advance. Wouldn't choose to come here again.
Poker machine gambling hole. These bums dont pay state local or federal wage taxes.
Friendly atmosphere and very good service. But the Reuben sandwich didn't have very much meat, a disappointment since the other ingredients were plentiful.
The taxi never showed up. I had this experience twice. They didn't show up after I called at 5 am when no one else would need a taxi. They suck. Don't use them.
Egg on the burger wasn't completely cooked. They kept changing TV channels, so you couldn't watch a game all the way through. So we left.
Staff is always polite and movie selection is great! Prices aren't too bad and the viewing area is always clean. Only down side is that they don't have student discounts, but that's livable
Chicken cooked at wrong temperature... Was completely red. Threw up for 3-4 straight days. Lost business over it too. Fix the kitchen, fix the restaurant... STAY AWAY!
decent at best.  if you know real cajun this place won't impress you but for the lack of any other option it's passable.  the Rat Toes appetizer is pretty good.
Nasty! Disgusting. I can't believe I even stepped in the doors.
Very nice and helpful.  If you are balling on a budget then this is the best store to visit.
Good Service! I had the usual soup, salad and breadsticks.
Fast, polite and the food was good.  The Thai Tacos and fried Mac&Cheese was yummy.  Great burgers as well. This is no culinary stop but good fast food.
Cannot believe how unhelpful and extremely rude the ladies were to me and other women here. They treat you like you're scum until you go to buy an expensive dress. Would never recommend this place to anyone looking for a nice dress shopping experience.
Tried it and they were out of everything we tried to order. Gave them another try and same thing. We gave up and wont be going back
We order our food from their carside service.  We found the food to be great, but patience trying to get your food from the carside pickup!!  (over 15 minutes past the time promised and ignored until the manager brought it out!!)
Excellent food with an intimate feel. I prefer the back patio area. The menu changes almost daily and veggies come from local growers.
Every time we have been here we have been disappointed. We are done. No more chances. There are much better pizza places around here.
Expensive (more than dealership), not fast, and they REALLY do some up-selling.
I have been to this location many times, and let me say that Einstein's is vastly superior as far as bagels are concerned. That stated, Bruegger's does serve good softwiches...however, I could get better bread and bagels elsewhere.
Came here frequently in college. Fell in love with the green curry. I had the chance to go to Thailand for myself and eat some of the dishes I learned to love at Thai Taste - and Thai Taste's versions of the dishes are amazing.
This restaurant closed on 12/16/2012.
This is one of the better places in Charlotte for good food and nice atmosphere.  The food is above average to great depending on what you get.  I like the Salmon.  There is also a nice outdoor space during the warmer months.
This place never disappoints.  I have never had a bad meal here.  There are always plenty of vegetarian selections to choose from.  I recommend making a reservation as they are always busy!
I love the atmosphere at 300 East. It is very cozy and intimate, great for a date night. The food is always really good, as is the service. I especially love the baked goat cheese appetizer and the filet. So good!
Fish tacos,  how could you go wrong with these!
I've been going here since they were in the old location up on East Blvd.  The staff is friendly and knowledgeable, and their hours are convenient for me.
Lots of really neat, unique stuff - but I kind of expected more.  Interesting location and good space and layout.  I've definitely bought a few cards there!
Paper Skyscraper is a fantastic and fun store. They have a little bit of everything. Everyone that works there are always so helpful and nice. This is a store that when my friends come from out of town, we always take them to shop here. Everyone loves it!
Simply put, the best fried chicken I have ever had! Mind you, I'm no connoisseur, but this was 110% legit; crunchy, juicy & ripe with flavor.
as far as fried chicken goes, this place is great!!!! Beware of the hours and they only take cash. Deffinetly worth a visit.
The place was less crowded this time and the restrooms were a bit cleaner. The restrooms do look and smell like they could use a good bleachy scrubdown, walls and all. The drinks were tasty and service quite friendly.
Funky, spunky....just give me the soup!!!  Believe it or not, but this place has THE best soup in Charlotte!  Don't be afraid to browse around the eclectic shop with many many organic & natural (genuinely) wares....
A great Starbucks in a great community. The staff is friendly, the music is amazing, and the energy there is just great. My only complaint? Finding parking is kind of a pain.
Good vibe, good food. Too loud on weekend nights. Make a choice, nightclub or dinner.
Excellent selection of well prepared Sushi.  Nice atmosphere that is definitely a bit \"Clubby\" as somebody previously mentioned.
The best!
This gallery has an explicit policy on their website that they will not entertain the art of any local artist.  I hope that the public will avoid them and instead go to galleries that allow Charlotte artists an opportunity to exhibit their work.
The worst collection of art suited for those who know very little about art. This gallery is neither progressive, provocative, or intellectually stimulating. It is perfect for Charlotte.
I tried this place after seeing it in the loafer so many times with rave reviews. I enjoyed my burger and fries although my guest didn't so much. I will note that they DO NOT have air conditioning. I was melting...
Its been a while since I've been here but the last time I was there the beer was not cold at all and the staff just didn't seem that interested in making sure you had a great experience. I love the location but not sure when I'd go back.
I was in the mood for breakfast and stopped in.\nI was not disappointed.\nI was seated immediately and was able to promptly place my order.\nEverything came out hot and tasty.
The best lunch spot in Charlotte. Friendly, family atmosphere. Great food, exceptional service!
Attended a gun show here. Nice facility.  Lots of parking and easy to get in and out of.
Their fish tacos are the best in Charlotte! SO DELICIOUS! And they always have a great draught selection. I LOVE CABO!
I really want to love this place but I really think it's overrated. I've been a number of times over the years and the food is rarely better than ok. The service has always been awesome though.
I ate at CFT for the first time this week with some coworkers. Delish!! I had the chicken quesadilla, and asked for light cheese...it was perfect. Looking forward to going back soon!!
Great location, good service. Just an okay food experience. Chips were cold and salsa had more corn in it then a sauce dip for chips and salsa. I ordered the shrimp tacos they were pretty good.
YES YES!  Do wish they brought back the jalapeno mashed potatoes! But every time they rock my world with the goto FISH TACO!!!!!
Great service great atmosphere and good food!!!! The mahi tacos and jalape\u00f1o mashed potatoes are good. Will come back and try the tempura tuna tacos
Nova's is great  if you get their fresh bread.  I particularly like their Focaccia\nand their savory scones.\n\nAs far as sweet treats, I love their gingerbread cookies around the holidays.
Awesome beer selection, ok latkes, and surprisingly great coffee. When I wake up a little early, this is my first stop on the way to work.
100% southern comfort food at a great price.  You can't beat it!
Really good food! Service is not great, though. The kitchen is typically slow and it takes a while to get your food. I won't make a special trip to eat here, but if I'm in the neighborhood, it's a good place to eat.
This is the coolest little coffee shop I've found, they always have cool art and they have a great menu and coffees, love it here.
This place is not the same anymore.... Waited about an hour to get mediocre food... even the atmosphere is pretty lame now.
Walked in and ignored by both the bar tender and the server. When we got the server's attention and asked to be seated it seemed like we were interrupting her. \n\nWe walked....
The only bad thing about this place is the que! Other than that the service is efficient the results are delicious and you can see them making it, pretty cool!! What a way to cool down after a day of walking around the city!
We just took our maltipoo here for the first time today and they did a wonderful job. He not only looks great, but he was very happy and loved the employees (rare since they had just groomed him). We are definitely going back!
Hadn't been in years. Now there is a bar. Food is frozen in time - same exact stuff as ten years ago. Mediocre.
Was excited to come here. Brought kids. Awful service. Nasty. Got sick. Do not recommend.
Our dinner was delicious and our waiter, Christopher, was the BEST! He made us feel special and took GREAT care of us! We definitely want to go back.
Intimate ambiance with loads of old school, steak house charm.  This restaurant is a diamond in the rough on a busy stretch of South Blvd.  Go and enjoy your favorite cut of steak and rest assured that the service will be impeccable.
If you like the early 1960s you will love this place if not stay away!  Food was average minus, walls were very dirty, service decent.  Would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.  I was told this restaurant was like Ruth Chris, don't believe it! Stay away.
Over rated.Drinks and Food are over price.
Celebrated my mother-in-law 70th birthday dinner, the food was ok...some of the vegetables were cold, lobster tail was a bit salty; however the servers were nice.
If this is a golf club, I'm the abominable snowman.  Looks like a pleasant place, but there sure as heck aren't any *golf* holes getting balled here.
I love this chick fil a. The customer service is awesome. There are always employees asking if I need anything and making sure I am satisfied. Obviously a great place for kids. The outdoor space and playground is nice and well kept.
Don't mess with entering off of Fairview or Sharon. Park in the back. Much easier in and out.
not sure whats going on,, the place seems very tattered now,  and the food quality has seem to gone way down,, Michael is doing his best I know but sometimes you need to step back and figure out whats wrong :(
I feel like the quality of this place has gone downhill slightly over the years. More globbed on sauces and general blandness. Meh.
Must be a good place at night. The espresso was collecting a social security check.
We stopped based on other reviews on Yelp.  While it is not fine dining, the food was hot and tasty.  I can't wait to try breakfast.  The staff makes the place.  They are polite, caring people taking great care of their customers.
I would have given this Marshall's 5 stars however I felt like the clothes department was fairly small...\n\nBut the home section is great!
All I can say is that it's the Disneyland of beauty supplies....Or maybe Mall of America....
OK sushi. Tried it several times. When I'm shopping at Home Depot, Target or Pet Smart. I get a thing for sushi and cold Japanese beer. Conveniently located in the same parking lot of Home Depot. Every time, disappointed.
Wow did this place suck. I came here for lunch with a work collesfur. I am from out of town but this was the closest place and it did nothing for me. Dirty interior, poor service. I just got a chicken salad and it was not memorable.
Course is in terrible condition - would not go back nor recommend anyone play this course - not worth playing for free
My boss and I go here every week. This place is clean fast and consistent they know us by name... \n\nBeyond that, they have the best club sandwich in Charlotte.
My husband is a professional Bass player and he gets everything he needs from Sam Ash. Today, we traveled 2 hours (from Asheville NC) to come here. We like this place! Decent customer service and they are willing to match prices!
This is a good local bar.  The wings were average and they had a good beer special with 3 dollar Coronas on Wednesday.
The hotel was ok with pleasant staff.  Just stayed one night as we had an early flight.  Our room was average overall and was clean.  I would recommend the North location as it is closer to the airport if you are taking a flight.
Hotel and room were fine but I was very disappointed that they wouldn't let the shuttle take us to or pick us at the light rail station. The other hotels in the area had their shuttles running without trouble. Probably won't stay here again.
Not the hotel of my choice, but definitely fit the bill for sleeping accommodations. The desk staff was pleasant and very helpful in helping us find food at 9:30pm on a Monday night.
The arroz pon collo was a great dish! The plates full of chicken and veggies to fill you up! Make sure to ask for the soft shells to go with it!
This is below average carolina barbeque. I made a special trip for a quick lunch and was very disappointed. The pork lacked flavor, the slaw was yellow from mustard, and the fries were food supply sourced. I had hoped for much better.
One of the worst BBQ I've ever had! Old and very dry! Service was okay. Wouldnt go back if you payed me $100!
Excellent prices. Decent food. Nice staff. Clean and friendly.
Pho was very good!! I had Rare Beef. Prices were the same as other places in Charlotte. I would come here again.
Good amount of food and price is decent
Awesome! Tons of new and used here. CDs, DVDs, bluerays and albums - that have it all. Staff is very friendly.
All the used records here are basically beat up dollar bin records priced at $5 and up. Bad customer service too. Not coming back.
It sucks!!! My room didnt have a trash can! The couch bed was full of springs and cover! But it was roomy and had alot of channels no elevator or handicapped equivalent.
Some friends and I tried Woodlands tonight and were not disappointed. The food is amazing. The Masala Dosa was delicious and the vada did not disappoint. I would highly recommend this place to anyone who loves indian food and pure vegetarian cuisine!
This place is awful and does not meet McDonald's standards by a long shot. Do not stop here. Servic3 is terrible dood is xold and usually comes out wrong.
Great course. Play was a little slow but overall great place to play. The best course in the university/concord area.
Cheap haircuts, done quickly, especially if you check in using their app. My only complaint is that I never seem to see the same person twice, so there is no way to have someone used to the way you want your hair done.
Ordered pizza and cheese bread tonight arrived 1:20 later with some type of cinnamon sticks. Long wait wrong order. Next time order Joe Mommas or Luigis and pick up my fault for being lazy.
To go was nice and hot when I came in.\nWings were VERY GOOD. The maui wowi and the hot ranch. I don't think I would dine in though. I got a pretty cool extra room setup for parties and everything though
I loved this place food is good. chicken. Wing delicious whit variety of the flavor we try all  .also good price en beer
This will be short and sweet!\n\nThis Walmart is always very busy. Its clean and fully stocked. Cheap prices but every time I go its an experience....I mean it's Walmart so I got exactly what I expected.
Chinese food good.I think they should just stick to Chinese food leave asian food alone. Do not Order Hibachi from this place didn't taste like it to me.
Ok food, but this Ohioan wasn't impressed. Clean inside, and nice bathrooms though.
This rental community does not offer its residences a recycling drop facility!
Used to be a great little joint for a quick salad and bowl of soup. But the past few months the service has become a real problem. Too many teenagers, not enough adults.
This CVS has a nice layout and has friendly employees.
$9 for a sandwich only. It was not worth it.
Hands down one of the best restaurants in Charlotte.  Delicious food, yummy drinks, friendly staff.
Great atmosphere, friendly welcoming service and most important the food it is delicious!!! I highly recommend it, specially if you are like me, from out of town. Great experience!!!
Always great food and great experience. We tell our family about it all the time. Our favorite restaurant for sure!
Great food, good value, huge sides and it was really nice to be casual in a steak house.  We will be there a lot.
Just OK. Better options out there. Seems a little tired....Firebirds has better food and prices.
Initial problems with a bathroom vanity but they fixed it.
Livery strong greasy odor all thru dinner
Love the fish and grits! Best in Charlotte!
Both the Gator bites, and the gumbo are amazing; I have never been disappointed by the food.
This place needs some cleaning!!!!!! We tried it because of the great reviews , the buffet was gross, the hibachi chicken was not bad, but just eating it in that dirty place wasn't pleasant.
Being the best pizza in Oregon is about the same prestige as being the best hockey player in Uganda, you don't get alot of bragging rights. The pizza and other menu items are decent , service good and the delivery is fast.
This was my first time trying Culvers. It's nothing special and is comparable to Wendy's or any other fast food burger place.
Went for Sunday brunch. Edible items include bacon and funnel cake strips. Everything else appeared to have been purchased frozen from Sam's club.
Grade: C-\n\nUmmm. Hmmm. Okay. Uhhhh. Huh. Right. What should I say? Yeah.
Best place ever! The staff are trained and educated and create a very comfortable environment. They also help with all kinds of concerns and issues.
Fresh, fresh, FRESH. There is no other fast food chain imaginable that has the local, wholesome, fresh, and ethical outlook that Chipotle does.
Good food. Great location. Good atmosphere (especially in the atrium) and great sangria. We will go back!
If you like sausages, EDM and the smell of bleach, this place is for you! Trying way too hard to be swank in a town much better suited to chill lounge. The only good thing is that I discovered Ami's next door.
Amazing food.\nService was excellent as well.\n\nI suppose when you pay these sort of prices you would better expect great good followed by great service.
Its open late and always hits the spot.  Fries in a paper bag and gyron to go with lots of white sauce on the side.  I've eaten here when not totally drunk and the food is good.  The greek salad and gyros are always a safe bet.
Quick food.  Not surprisingly it tastes like a chain
Haters gone hate
Terrible service, the food was okay. Restaurant was empty but we had to wait 20 minutes for the waiter to come and give us food. We were literally the only customers.
Went there on a saturday night.  Super loud, crazy music, and people all hovering in front of the flavors.  Too chaotic.  Yogurt not particularly good (and it does NOT take a particularly good version to please me.  Dissapointing - just ok.
Great Brats!
short menu, which is cool if ya want a burger or brat and a brew. Thought the brat was good and the beer cold. YOUNG crowd, thought the female bartender was a bit rude that being said had a good time watching the Bama / LSU game.
I always have the beef and egg or ja jang meinn!!one of my favorite take out places for Chinese food in madison!!
The place was awesome. Food was EXCEPTIONAL. And definitely reasonably priced. Check it out. I know that I will be going back.
The flavors are awesome. This is coming from a person who makes Indian food, so i know flavors and spices a lot.\nI am coming here next time too. I had catfish (Kari Lele) and it was tooo good.
Rude, racist, dark. Unconscious drunk people at the bar or at the entrance smelling like urine. Homeless old men grabbing at my date. Pretty much an assault. Place attracts the detritus.
Passable middle eastern and mediterranean food in a nice State Street setting close to campus.
The crowd is not my scene,  but they make a strong yet decent tasting long Island. the main draw for me was competitive foosball almost any night of the week. its been a few years though.
I quite like the place....their entrance is through a quaint-looking garden which sets a romantic mood. The ambiance inside is pretty nice. The food is good. Try the stuffed mushrooms. They can be pretty busy at times so I would call ahead.
OK place but had better.\nSteak was OK although for the price i was expecting better.\nwe were seated on a table and the seats were small.\nNo parking, had to drive around till i found a ramp (with pay meters) not too far.
the outdoor seating was nice.  margaritas were pretty good.  food was not good at all.  So if you want to hang out on state street and have a drink, it's nice.  If you want good food, go somewhere else.
Not sure how good the food is going to be but 45 minutes to get it is unacceptable. No apologies at all from the staff either. Finally got our food. Not worth the wait.  Skip it!
It's true that Kabul isn't really memorable. But its kabobs are good. It feels like a restaurant on a college campus should ... like it's just managing to get by. It's good food.
The food here is soooooooo good.  I ordered a vegetarian dish and words can not explain how good it was.  Enjoy!!!  Cheers!!!
Bait and switch.  They'll let your children participate in creating a craft and then charge you to keep it.
Love the Mac and Cheese.
Won't be coming back.   The food was only mediocre and the service was bad.
Can't beat $2 for a any size latte on Wednesdays.  Small latte?  $2 please.  Medium latte?  $2 please!  Large latte?  $2 please!  You get the idea.  Hint:  I'd go with the large...
Oh and get the weird maple candy waffles!
Fast and tasty sandwiches, good baked goods and soups, and a wide array of micro-brew-y beverages.\n\nThat said, their occasional live entertainment can be irritatingly faux-Joanna Newsom-y.
I like the new location. I have only tried the coffee & pastries so far but both are still excellent. Monkey Bread, mmm. The new space has a nice cafe feel that looks suitable for just relaxing, lunch or a meeting (they still have meeting space).
The place is mainly eh. The sashimi tastes like its B quality from the supermarket. Go to Red or Unami instead.
Good sushi with a reasonable price. Takara is extremely generous with their food and their staff are always very friendly.
I love the margaritas here.  I also like the chips and dip.  This place is best utilized at happy hour, for that reason.
Love this place! Get corn quesadillas!
I've lived in 7 different apartments in Madison with 6 different landlords and everyone pales in comparison to McBride. Need a repair? They've fixed it by the time you get home from work. Easy to communicate with and they keep the pressure off their customers.
The pizza here is like the kind you buy in the freezer section of a grocery store and seriously, I'd rather eat frozen pizza than have pizza here again.
This place is OK.  Shoes must be taken off before you come inside.  Staff was really, really friendly and that was nice.\n\n\nRooms are RIGHT by the kitchen which can be annoying/noisy.  Also gets FREEZING in here at night.
If you want the perfect breakfast, well this is it.  It's so busy because it's delicious.
The food and service are both very good, I do however wish they where open later on weekdays with me being a 3rd shifter the options can be somewhat limited.  I do appreciate that they have no problem calling when the driver arrives.
Speaking as someone who does not eat meat ever/very often, I am not impressed with the food as my options are extremely limited.  I am impressed with the atmosphere and beer selection. If  I lived closer, I'd hang out here.
Great meat selection. best in madison hands down
Best Chinese food in Madison  by far. Friendly staff and quick service!  They carry a wide selection of both traditional Chinese food and American Chinese food.
HANDS DOWN most authentic Asian cuisine my hubby Andi have found in Madison!  Congee love! The chicken was moist and tasty, so good!
The only reason why I go to this place is because it's the nearest Korean restaurant to Madison college campus.  I always go for their Bibimbap on Rock which is the best meal there, in my opinion.  The potato side is really good too!!
Nice to see that Panera is the same here in Madison WI. Good quality food, very nice employees. This is a fairly busy location but they move people through rather quickly.
Great vibe with too many great choices. I had the Frarattoo and would highly recommend it. Very rich and savory grain dish with poached egg. Great baked goods as well.
Hearts topping and not even worth it. Food was surprisingly bad. I had pork and Mac grill cheese which didn't work on many levels. My son's chicken fingers were better than my dish.
Went for dinner with mother and uncle. All three meals where all right but not amazing. The quality to price ratio was off (too expensive). My meal was ordinary with meatballs that where dry and over cooked. Wine was good.
I love the selection of baked goods and breakfast treats for work :)  I've never had lunch or eaten here...someday soon, will have to try it.
This Copps is near my work.  What can you say, it's part of a huge grocery chain.  They have a decent selection of beer and wine at good prices...the reasons I stop here on my way home.  It can get really busy after work, especially on Fridays.
This place used to be better and more knowledgeable and helpful.  I guess I hit bad staff day or something.\ngood prices and a great selection.   \nNeed chairs to sit and read.
Worst cheesy breadsticks! I've ordered this item from other locations and it was great but this location's version was terrible! They were over cooked, cut in half  and with 50% less bread sticks than other locations. Barely any cheese as well.
It was average. Not quite the same as italian delis in Chicago, but ok, I guess.
Good, cheap, fast, friendly. Best fresh chips and salsa.
Mmmm mmmm good!  The catfish was our favorite, but everything was soooo good.  Get the cornbread!
I have been going to Parkway for years. I really like the Parkway omelette. The service is always fast and friendly. What are you waiting for ?
This is a nice little grocer.  I wish their cash register would work better so that you don't have to wait 10 minutes to ring up.  But otherwise its nice.
They announced today they are closing. As you can see due to my previous review I am not surprised. Sad but not suprised.
Whenever we go there, we are hit with a bill of nearly $200 or more. They charge excessivley for small things like looking at some sample under a microscope for 5 mins or $20 for shampoo. We are seriously considering switching.
They charge too much, care is so-so.  I would go to Veterinary Emergency Service.  I wish I could do it all over again.  They will also suggest you take the route that is \"most expensive,\" and prey on your feelings towards our pet.  Stay away.
3 dart machines, a Foosball, a shuffleboard. Wouldn't call this a place for games. Upstairs opens at 11? What's up there that's not open at 9? But as a bonus, drinks are cheap, staff is friendly. Great job.
I love this place.  I've been going to Paisan's since i was about 10 years old.  The best is a Porta Salad and then going on to the Bella Pizza with onion's!  BEST PIZZA I've ever had!
Was here for a work dinner event.  Service was not good.  Very slow too.  Worst service I've gotten here.  Usually gotten better service.
Service was extremely slow and not very useful...never once asked if we wanted something to drink, just brought water out. Took a hour for a 9\" pizza that didn't even have all the correct toppings on it. Food was \"meh\".
A nice list of loose leaf teas, which are served in a light-bulb looking glass ware. This Jiffy Lube converted place is an unexpectedly pleasant coffee shop on the S Park street. Very friendly staff, a fantastic view of Copps, and overall a charming neighborhood cafe.
I was a regular at Nam's till they started decreasing their portion size for the same price.  K23 which was the beef pepper steak with rice is my favorite!!!  But this place does not appreciate customer loyalty, so please don't bother going there.
Always a consitent, great meal.  The service is excellent - we've always had really friendly staff.  I LOVE the beat salad and the mushroom pasta special (served only at lunch).
This is our favorite take out place.  The food is always fresh, flavorful and plentiful.  The owners are very nice also.  We drive out of the way for take out from them.
The only thing irish about this \"irish pub\" is they sever Guiness and have Jameson Whiskey. Otherwise there isn't anything irish on the menu and no irish ambiance at all. Boooring.
Good docs - young but nice and responsive to questions.  The office staff isn't the most pleasant.  \nThe prices are reasonable and the facility is new - very nice.
Monkeyshines is the way to end a night of bad decisions.
Easily my favorite restaurant in Madison. Very attentive waitstaff. I've never had a dish here that I didn't like.
Crappy vegetarian selection. The few things I had were meh. Definitely needs better labeling for the buffet for noobies like myself.
Grade: C-\n\nThe most over-rated restaurant in Madison. Decent food. Outrageous prices. Good service. How this place is still in business amazes me.
one of our favs in Madison, very consistent and good, sister-in-law and mother-in-law were impressed last night
Grade: C-\n\nLess than average service. Almost okay food. Spendy.
The wash was quick and fairly inexpensive-- $10. Yes they missed a few spots on the dash but the rest of the car was vacuumed nicely and the outside looks great. Perhaps my expectations were low given the other reviews, but I'd go again.
Worst car wash I ever got. The inside of my car is still dirty and dusty doesn't even look like I got a car wash. Should of gone to octopus what a waste of 20 dollars
By far the best place for breakfast in CU, and their coffee is always top notch. I've never had any qualms with the service, and never waited for over 5 minutes for a seat. Everyone's super friendly and I always leave in a great mood.
Love the look and feel of the place but I've eaten better food. Came here for breakfast and it was alright, nothing great. The service here was fantastic.
I went here on a number of occasions and was always super impressed with the speed and quality of care I recieved.\n\nFree cold-packs and condoms. What more could you ask for?!?
- Overrated\n- Expensive\n- Hipsters\n\nThree strikes and you're out, Caffe Paradiso.
One of the worse chocolate fraps. It was bitter, to syrupy, and over-priced. I do not recommend this place
I just have to update this to say that they no longer have a minimum for credit card purchases.  Love their spinach and feta croissants!
I took my CCW class here and the instructor was very knowledgeable.  No complaints here and he made me a more accurate shooter.  What more could you ask for?
Dont ever Fly US Airways to Hawaii. The Flight Attendants were rude and very unpleasant. Spend the Extra and Fly Hawaiian Airline.
I like US Airways because they simply fly where I go.
The Worse Airline Ever....God Forbid if they buy AA they will also screw that airline up forever also.
Here is a recipe for success:  take the two worst airlines in the industry and merge them together.  What do you think you get?  One colossal airline that completely sucks
So I'm here every other week seems like, and I haven't had any problem with US airways..
I didn't like this place at all. I came with 3 friends and non of us like there omelets. There were very dry tasting...
Buzzzzzzz in my room all night long coming from the vents. Creepy clicking speaker in the ceiling. Construction noises like a drill sting during the day. I can hear my neighbors talk. Avoid at all cost.
This place used to have really good food. Now you get more than half of your plate covered in bean sprouts. I think its over priced for what you get.\n\nI've always had good service here.
When I want a fast food burger, the Jack Sirloin burger is my go-to. Chez Jack hits the spot en route to or from a night of revelry. This Jack was fast and friendly, can't ask for more.
The jazz pianist is fantastic.\n\nOtherwise the food sucks & the place just creeps me out.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: Great piano music does not make a great restaurant
Very impressed, first time there and they had some extraordinary Art especially the Dancing Swarm of Fireflies by Yayoi Kusama ... that was worth the price of entry alone.\nNice to have Arcadia Farms there too.
I have been to 2 Cultural festivals here. It is a great venue for showcasing food and cultural performances. \nParking can be steep at the garages nearby if you cannot find it for free on the street.
Went today to drop off camaro I rented returned quick and easy and picked up new car for 2nd stage of my vacation picked up r/t challanger fast and easy once again Hertz A+++
Horrible service. 1 attendant checking in cars, at least 20 cars waiting at any point in time. We had to wait over 15 mins to get checked out. Customer service representative was rude when I asked nicely if they could get more attendants out.
I like Miracle Mile Better... We had 2 sandwiches and 2 drinks 28.00 ... Who charges 2.18 for a drink... They were cheap on the BBO...
Yummmmm! Everything was tasty, the koolaid took me back! Wish we had saved room for red velvet cake!
Next time I'm in Phoenix this is my first stop! I ordered the Lo Los with a side of green beans and corn bread. WOW, I love that southern cooking! The sweet tea was amazing and at how many places can you order Kool-Aid on tap!
My wife ate at LoLo's, brought home a dinner for me, chicken dinner. The chicken was dry and over cooked, no taste.  This dinner is not cheap, for the money, not worth it.
Horrible service. Burger cooked wrong and it took 20 minutes to get it replaced. Definately not a place to visit if you have less than 2 hours for lunch.  Entree prices good but $3 for regular ice tea :(
Pretty nice theatre. Great vibes here.
Wanted to try this place out. Went last night and it has been closed down ! Nothing inside and a couple of letters hanging on window from the state.
Highly recommend Caroline for eyebrow waxing. Nice touch, great attitude, & funny!\n\n(Highly recommend not being Indian if you want to avoid eyebrow waxing.)
Moved from Phoenix ten years ago but still crave a cheese pizza and buffalo wings from this place.
Bad feeling about foods and services. We came with 2 women, 3 men and 2 kids, the waiter fogot to bring the drink for us, the beef burn when they fried and used to make the salad.
Great Salon, Excellent prices and you love the work they do.  Ask for Sherry I use her I wont go anywhere else.
This is a place that exists.
Completely disappointed that this course failed to provide notice they were closed. If you are going to be working on the course and the entire facility is going to be unavailable you should consider posting it on your website.
Sometimes you get the uncomfortable feeling in not being welcome there in some parts of the staff is a little bit rude, i I guess you could make the best of it if it was the only place to go, but its not.
Just missed them. They are closed   , I wanted to try the shakes I'll go elsewhere.\nI Stopped by a second time still was not that inpressed but that's just my taste buds maybe you may enjoy it.
stopped in for a few pizzas with the fam. Pretty good pizza, nice local little spot. we had this pizza with meatballs and pepperoni and a margherita. Both were pretty good. Maybe next time I'll try a sandwich. solid 3 stars
Everyone raves about this place, so I tied it. It was just ok. I've had better and worse. I had an Italian sub with chips and a drink. Nothing about the place or sandwich compels me for a return visit.
The service is ok but the food is not worth it.  Found a 10 inch strand of hair in my food!! Gross
The wife and I went to Ritas a couple of months ago and let me tell you its gooood. Will come back for sure. O and thanks to Erin that made our time there awesome.
Been here a few times when I'm in town. Last time was during Phoenix Pride (I wasn't aware that pride was going on) The place was packed and lots of friendly people. If you like bears, then pay this place a visit on a Saturday..
Quite crowded with visitors and very nice music. Awesome!
As a follow up to my previous review - the practice manager called me to apologize for the bad experience and remedy the issue.  I appreciate that they took the effort to reach to me after the fact and let me know that they would address the bad experience I had.
I get all my business cards printed here.  Great, fast, reliable service!!  Dwight behind the print  counter is the man!
Heaven for vegan . \nStay away from the meat. \nGreat desserts. \nTake the Turkish coffee.
Sunday afternoon before heading back to the airport was great. Jack & I met some really nice guys. Good mix of people and the tacos were good and cheap. Fun place!
Ew, never again.
love! always a favorite!
Nice sized parking lot. Friendly staff.
Another fabulous home style Chinese food at The Prime Chinese...... If you like combo fried rice, it is the best ever....
Best chips anywhere, great decor, prime corner location, and no one else has their specialties. XLNT!
Really fun place! Great atmosphere and great food awesome parrots and cool crap everywhere decorated
Very knowledgeable and helpful. I went in for a surety bond and he made it very easy and even provided useful tips to help me out. Definitely going to be getting insurance here when my policy is close to an end.
Saw owner wipe the tops of the red ketchup bottles with the same rag he used to clean the table. Won't go back.
After numerous attempts to resolve and promises to refund prepayment,  and no apology, my money was refunded.......two months later. Thanks Hertz for ensuring my entire experience was poor. Back in Phoenix this month, going straight to enterprise!
Great place to go on a Monday afternoon. There were probably less than 20 cars in the parking lot. I was kind of leery at first because the mall here is sketchy at best, but this was a nice clean theater with friendly staff.
Great food...friendly service...and very reasonable!  Try some of their fresh lemonade instead of BYOB.
This place is fantastic!  Every time I go I try something different.  The family who owns, cooks and serves at Da Vang are very attentive, give great advice on what to try and really work hard to make your experience a good one!  Love, Love Love!
Great staff, awesome eat-in or take home experience.  Fish sauce to die for.  The best Vietnamese food in the Valley.
= = = = = = CLOSED = = = = = =\n\nThis JB's location, with it's poor building layout, poor service & mediocre food finally folded.  Good riddance!     :-)
Same 3 star food as any other location, but here they seem much happier when you are headed out the door than when you come in. Evidenced by their never asking but assuming your order is to go.
THIRTEEN places that sell SHOES??? Run down, small, hard to get in and out of and clientele is very low on the socioeconomic ladder. Do yourself a favor and skip this mess!
Very typical strip mall-ish take out joint. Nothing special at all. Service is minimal and its obvious they just want to get your money and you to get out ASAP. Food was overcooked quite a bit and just not good.
Great Pizza and Pitas, these guys are right down the street from work and we bring back lunch to the office about twice a month. Fresh ingredients, lots of cheese, cant go wrong. If you are showing up around lunch 11:30-12:30, it will be busy.
The food is ok. Average so a 3 however the attitude is a 1. We ordered the Chicken quesadilla and was charged 1$ more than posted. She said she couldn't do anything and didn't credit the difference. Based on that they get a 2.
Good food, good price, good service.
I've been coming to La Pi\u00f1ata for years and it is consistently delish!! Rice and beans are a deciding factor for me and theirs are YUM. I've never had anything not good! Do yourself a favor and ask for the hot salsa!
went to drive thru, Smh. Horrible customer service. The girl made a rude comment after I changed the size of my blizzard. So rude!!! If you don't like your job. LEAVEEEE!
Best to stick to the apple pie.  The breakfast  especially the sausage is reflective of the prices. Cheap.
Historic Institution filled with the coolest cars you've ever seen. Great service, good prices, cool guys. 5 *'s.
I think the dim sum was pretty good but their service was alright.  for some reason they seemed pissed off when they were pushing the dim sum cart.....
The worse service.
Another disappointing experience.  Why can they make good al pastor tacos. Don't even use real corn tortillas. The only good thing was the horchata.
Pricing was very competitive compared to 5 other companies.  Great work and clean- up.  It took them two days instead of 1 day as estimated to remove two 40' high pine trees.  I would use them again if the need arises.
I really love this place they make the best greek salad ever, the customer service is wonderful, they are prompt with my order and the food tastes better each and every time!
This hotel was busy during the weekend I visited, and at times the front desk was short staffed. Noise in the rooms from nearby I-17 was a problem. There are so many hotels in this area, I'll stay somewhere else in the future.
Outback Steakhouse is alright.  They have good salads.  That's about all I can say.\n\nTheir prices are decent if you just want the basic steak meal.\n\nOverall, Meh.  I've experienced better.
I usually get the sirloin,  but the fish dishes aren't bad either.  Steak is always nicely cooked,  along with the delicious side dishes.  Desserts are delicious, save some room for them. The tally nice thing is that they are consistent!
It was what i expected. They packed the box on my two item meal.
Excellent good fresh and delicious with many choices at a great price.  You get it made your way with many different choices of meats cheeses and toppings. Thru also have pastas but I recommend subs they are better.
I had the best customer service from Eric in the fan department today! Thank you for all your help Eric, you helped me more than you can imagine. I appreciate your customer service. Hopefully I'll see you again for more goodies! Your co workers were exceptionally helpful as well!!!
I grew up eating here so i really like it and the atmosphere is cozy I really like it.
Recently renovated. Very effective and well-flowing floor plan. The section for well behaved children and brats is located on the complete other side of the building from the rest of the library. Genius!
Well rude staff. Kitchen was dirty.  Waitress forgot my drink...twice and  the bun looked wrinkles and smashed, won't be back for sure.
Just barely sat in,  at least 10 servers and was not helped out for a long time. Finally got my order in and  staff is not happy at all. Will most likely be the last time I come here.
I love Sardella's!! they have great pizza and the winds are great!! they also have a killer monday special (half price pizza!)  this wings are so good they will make you wanna smack your momma!!
Ordered a pizza for the first time. The tomato taste was so overbearing that you could not taste anything else. Better off going to Little Ceasars.
Holy cow, worst customer service ever. We ordered two premium wraps through the drive through. Took about 20 mins and we were the only people there. We could here the employees screaming at each other whole making our order. Won't come here again!
Portions are huge! There is no way anyone should eat a full meal here. I'd say as far as quality they are average. Great happy hour prices.
Food prepared wrong. Charged for things that we supposed to be complimentary as per our waitress, including entrees and deserts. Not going back to this place!! Manager said she would fix things but didn't.
Excellent job!  Originally went to take a friend and was so impressed with that work that I had them do mine.  Will go back and refer friends.  Chris is friendly, professional and thorough. Car looks great!!!!
Q
Rudest people I have ever encountered.  Husband and wife owned business and when I called for service the wife was unbelievably and unnecessarily rude and demanding.  Don't waste your time calling.
Great service, fast, and friendly hops. Love the happy hour prices before 11am, and 2-4pm. Also their coupons are always a good way to save. I just reloaded a sonic card for $25 and got a free burger coupon!
Gotta have some love for the dive bars!  This really fits the mould.  Great burgers and all the beer you want as long as its a domestic :)
Great place for breakfast and to watch the airplanes land and take off - service has been mixed depending on day of week.  Obviously Sat & Sun am are very busy.
Not exactly what I would call a great place to eat. If you want to take your teenager out for a shake or ice cream you may enjoy it :)
I have been going here for many years, and every time I go it's a great personable experience. When you go to most salons there is always one person (nail tech) you prefer, but at this salon they're all amazing.
Not the best by far. I am going to stick to my location over at Camelback .
Food was good. Waitress \"Maggie\" has no common sense. Spoke with owner and got things cleared up. Still won't go back again.
Arron Kyle and the team at this Guitar Center location went above and beyond to help a local band out who barely made it to the store before the store was closed.  Thanks for the capo and saving the day Arron!
Drive thru chick named Kylie wouldn't take my order because I wanted two separate orders at 1 am. Both very small and simple, with one car in the drive thru other than myself. What a joke.
Never ever going back. The place stinks like cigarettes and the service is terrible. The food is mediocre, ihop may be better. Definitely wouldn't suggest to a friend.
Love their shakes! :)
Kung Paola's good... Trying General Tsao today
Worst staff ever. The ladies at the front desk are horrible. i liked the doctor I had but the staff is the worst
Westrige mall was better than this mall even when most of the stores were about to shut down. When I visited this mall recently most the stores looked cluttered and unkept.
Bad service altogether
Please hire more help in the evenings and keep black walnut in stock! That's all. Thank you.
Love Nurse Purtee. Hate that im always waiting over an hour past my appointment time even when im 20 minutes early. Also hate that I have to schedule immunizations over 6 weeks in advance.
hate the service. please fix
Took my grand kids for first time at this location. Where I come from they skate, not here. Order took a long time, beef way undercooked, fries blah, chick strips not good. No one liked anything...server looked stoned.
I grew up in Arizona and we went to Wongs every Sunday after church.  Three years ago we got stationed in Hawaii.  Everytime I come home, our first stop is Wongs.  I love everything about it.  Wongs is my comfort food.
Great alternative to buffet Chinese. Huge portions and cooked to order. Lunch specials come with more food than one should eat! Pleasant staff and decent atmosphere. I will eat there again.
Great simple Chinese food. We've been going here off and on for years and I'm addicted to their garlic chicken. Staff is helpful, prices are reasonable, and the portions are generous. A good, safe bet for Chinese food.
No nonsense, affordable prices.  Had my Audi in for service with Dan (someone whom I have total confidence in and have known since he worked at Chapman), no complaints as usual.
Tried this place out and the food was ok, what concerned me was the cleanliness of the kitchen. The floor was really dirty, under the burners or stove seemed to have months of grease buildup etc. 50c extra to use debit or credit card btw.
Nice place to stay, good price for. CDL and AAA 49.99  A NIGHT
This is the best drunk food drunk money can buy. Very self explanatory, if not just order a greasy burger and enjoy. Never has any issues with this place at all, always friendly and correct. :)
Save your money guys. This pace is well kept and clean but... food not so much, way over priced for the poor food quality/quantity. Your better off finding a taco truck near by or heck just goto Denny's, you won't be as disappointed there.
Friendly service. They were spot on with the special requests I asked with my order. They made sure to offer sauces and did no ice in my drink per my request. The food came out quick. What more could I ask from Taco Bell
Just went back this weekend. Not as good as 1st few times. A little bit inconsistent...uh oh..inconsistency kills
Don't waste your time or money, incredibly slow service. I get that its family owned however they need to get with the times and truly make a effort to connect with their guests, especially first time guests. Very disappointed.
An old style family restaurant.  A very good value for the money.  My entire group liked the food.  A little bit of everything for everyone.  We ate Greek food, they also have Italian.  Can not vouch for the Italian as we all ate Greek Food.
Down the street from my office, I love this place! The turkey bacon sandwich with lots of their spicy sauce is delicious! And the lady at the cashier always has a joke or pun to tell, makes a crappy day into a better one.
Salad bar was really good including peel and eat shrimp but the fish and chips were AWFUL.  Three tiny pieces that looked like they came out of a fish sticks box from the grocery freezer section.  So disappointing.  Either do it right or take it off the menu.
This is a horrible car wash.  The manager / owner is extremely rude and the quality of the work is terrible.   I would never waste the money to return here.  They only are concerned with up selling detail packages and not with the quality of car washes done.
This location closing.  Going out of business sale going on now (9/2013).  if the parking lot was this packed all the time they would not be closing.  I don't hate Wmart, I just hate being left with nothing but Wmart.
WHOA!  So many things to look at and buy!!!  You can find almost anything electronics there and at many price points.  \n\nI need limit my visits here to save my wallet's life.  LOL!
Kim took care of me. I had powder acrylic on and the last tech messed them up. She put liquid gels on for me. My hands feel clean and pretty. Thank you.
Delicious! Small hole in the wall, slow service but owned and operated by the cutest little couple! Your in for a treat here!
Brayden and shaun Will def take care if you
Great Food....\n\nGood Service\n\nExcellent Management\n\nGood Drinks\n\n115 tv's (guesstimate)
Closed kitchen early because they were slow.  Manager \"Johnny\" is a loser. We had a groupon and he would not honor it.  Hate to say this but we would never try this place again even though we lost 17.50.
The wings are to die for, atmosphere is nice, crowded but spacious enough to eat and be comfortable. I couldn't see the menu cause it's a little dark. Lol prices are great.
We have eaten here twice. Both times hamburgers. They were very good. Service was very good. Atmosphere was very noisy.
Service was great.  Food was good not great.  I can't say I was a big fan of the atmosphere.  Kind of dark and dingy.  I'd go again but this restaurant probably wouldn't be my first pick.
Nice place, clean, spacious room.
Extremely fast service food was out quick and fresh! Would most likely come back soon! Recommend this to anyone.
Great bagels! Not the best atmosphere but good coffee and bagels. Fair prices, friendly staff... I will definitely go there more often.
I never write reviews for fast food, but this place was clean and the staff was pleasant.  The food, well it was Taco Bell would you expect anything different, it was good
Absolutely AVERAGE donuts; not terrible but nothing special. To be honest I'd give the QT a higher mark for donuts than Bosa.
Best doughnuts in Chandler. Fresh doughnuts made throughout the day. Every drink under the sun besides coffee.
We have been taking all of our dogs to Dr. Weikhorst for more than 10 years. He is a very compassionate doctor and a pleasure to work with. We recommend his services to everyone.
Drive-up ordering box broken for months, today at lunch ordered a Double Del Cheeseburger but they had no meat to make burgers.  Need I say more! Off too Whataburger.
Not much to look at inside, the building is deceiving from the out side I thought there would be a lot more to look at. Walked and read the whole place in 30-45min
Pretty good and they deliver! The nachos are excellent and they put the cheese sauce in its own container and is more than enough for an extra side of chips. Most locations are cash only which can be a bummer
There is a reason Milanos has been in business as long as they have! The selection is great and it is one of those few places that you can establish a relationship with the guys working there.
Very professional and friendly to this visitor from cold Chicago here for Cubs spring training. Fit me in last minute. Great wax and pedicure - personalized service. Highly recommend.
Cranky old man who has been in the business too long. If his work product was great perhaps it would be worth it but his results are hit and miss. I would not recommend going to this man.
Great Chili Cheese fries and plenty of sports channels to pick from. Impressive shot menu as well. We'll definitely be back!!!
It's old and smells off!  Always have to wait in long lines to check out AND NO SELF CHECK OUT!  Never been impressed with Basha but this is one of their low end stores.
The staff seemed friendly, until I got my car back after denying their $300 brake replacement job. They broke an item in my car and they refused to admit it, plus the AC was on full blast.
I'm not as enthusiastic as the other two reviews, but this is above average in terms of food.  However, the atmosphere is lacking in comparision.  It really is a hole-in-the-wall.  If you want something different than a chain, you may want to consider it.
one word:  awesome!
One of my preferred pizza places.
Barro's is always awesome. When I call in an order its usually ready faster than they say it will be, and their meatball pizza is delicious.
Very disappointed with the 1 hour delivery on a Wednesday evening when we live across the street and we only ordered 2 things.  The food for tge price is not worth it.. I will never order from this place again!
Third time here. Not as good as before. Salmon not tasty, salad over loaded with dressing. Wait staff good. Restaurant clean.
One of the best gyro places in Arizona!  Large, flavorful, hot, fresh portions with fabulous tzatziki sauce!!
Prices are great, but the quality isn't the best. you have to pick threw on a few items to find something fresh
Soupy pasta sauce, very unremarkable house salad. Not great atmosphere in a little strip mall  Would not return.
Great German beer and food. I will be back!!
German cafeteria food. period.  I had the special: stuffed roast pork, red cabbage and spaetzle. (sp)
Small and quaint, the servers are friendly. Food is good, coffee is hot. Even in summer, they have decent patronage. I  sure the winter will be busy. We always like small, locally owned business - and we love our breakfast places.
They need to lay off the ice. More than 3/4 of my drink was full to the top of ice. Two sips and you're done. Is it worth 7 bucks for a crappy meal? Nope!
Pizza is great but this place is overpriced for what it is.
I just felt that the calamari was bland.  The roast beef sandwich was too fatty and the au jus was too salty.  Tirimisu was deliscious though.
Great donuts and friendly service I highly recommend & good coffee. I have no idea what the guy was complaining about the owners English was fine
Not my favorite of the local baristas but it's Starbucks...terribly consistent.
One of my favorite \"cheap eats\" places. T-bone steak & eggs dinner is the hidden gem on the menu! See photo
They have great food if you can get service.   Last time I went wewaited 30 min and didn't have any service at all so we left and done 20 min to another restaurant. We just phone order wings and pick them up now
Don't waste your time.  It used to be good.  It's not anymore.
This place was bought out by another person a year ago. He named it Taka Sushi but hasn't changed the name on the outside.\n\nThere are a few servers left from the old owner but they hate it. Ending in service going down hill.
Stay away.  Avoid at all costs.  Don't move here even if it's free.
Ambience is great. Love the band and dj on Friday and Saturday nights. Food is ok. The service, however, is horrible. Been going there for a few years and the service keeps getting worse (with the exception of Mike).
Don't go here if you need anything. They tried making it into a super Walmart but failed miserably.  There is no one around and if you need anything, go to the other two walmarts that are 3 miles apart, in the opposite direction. Super fail.
Pricey for what you get. Pretty good flavor. Service was ok. I'd say go to Elmer's right down the street instead.
I'll be honest I was not impressed with the food. Very in seasoned and greasy. Service was slow. I also received a dirty water glass and silverware. This was my first and last visit. I give it 2 stars because the cost is low.
Swanky Wendy's --- Good stuff.
It was an ok restaurant, but the service wasn't that great, they didn't pay attention to the customers and one of their machines is broken... which was supposedly also broken in another review.
This is a great restaurant. We ate here several times. Great food, ambience and location. Very polite staff.
Had a couple beers at this out of the way dive bar.  Rough crowd.
I never had any major complaints about Enterprise. Make sure you bring the car back how you left it(as far as gas is concerned) or they will charge you $10, a gallon.
You just lost our business.. no longer open on Sundays is a very bad decision. Religion and business does not belong together.. seperate
Good pizza not the best! But good
Pizza is good...we've ordered lasagna for take out too before and its good. Friendly service.
The food is good, but no better than any other Mexican restaurant. The prices are ridiculous! $3.50 for one taco. Probably won't be going here again, unless I win the lottery.
Total bait and switch sales department! Will tell you one price over the phone, then quote you another when you arrive! Happened to me personally 3 times. I bought from Scottsdale BMW. One quote, one price, done deal. Buyer beware...
I totally agree with Melissa H about the cake (having been in attendance at her wedding).  The cake was delicious !
Great customer service.
I was given a $200 gift certificate here from my sister with no expiration date! According to the Arizona State Statutes, an expiriation date must cleary be disclosed on the certificate, however, Total Bliss said that their policy is 1 year and will not honor my certificate.
I went in to look at some tile. They have a great show room with many decorating ideas!! I'm so glad I went there. I got a great price and my floor looks great!! And the price was right!
Love Tony for my nails and Lisa for my toes and eye brows! Great please... clean,  affordable...
I had heard about how good this place was and when there was a deal on HOmerun..i bought it..I have had many facials and was surprised to learn something new about my skin..awesome and informative facial!!!!!
Although, I really liked my lash extensions and Patrice, I purchased a pre-pay to get my fills, and now they've closed SHOP!!!
The Challah Bread French Toast was unique.   A good menu with items that are not associated with the normal \"breakfast place.\"  \n\nBusy place but efficient and friendly.  I would love to go back again if I make it back in the area from Chicago.
I finally made it to the breakfast club! The food was delicious and the place was gorgeous.
The breakfast menu is excellent.  Our group of nine was seated quickly and the service was great.  It's definitely a place I would return to for a brunch date or a special occasion.
Great spot to start your day. Fresh orange juice. I highly recommend just make sure you have time for waiting cause they always busy.
great time
This bar definitely feels like it should be on the beach in Mexico, and if it was it would be awesome! I thought it was just okay, not the best crowd, and a little run down. Probably won't be going back because there are so many other good places in the area.
Didn't come here to eat just drink but can't really go wrong with 2.50 coronas this is definitely is a college bar and a bit noisy what's wierd is there Oregon duck fans and not ASU fans? Great place for day drinking though
pretty laid back, good drinks and food. a couple times i went and the misters were broken and leaking. otherwise, like it
Food is good. The burger is great. The service a bit slow and dreamy. They think they are Bohemians and they aren't. Finally avoid the owner she is a complete ditz and space case...just smile and avoid this cat lady.  Cheers.
I'm sleepy so this will be short and concise. Had the garlic mushroom omelet. It was delicious! Nice patio to sit and eat breakfast. Will definitely be back!.
Totally average experience. Service was s.l.o.w.... The hummus plate was bland and boring with the pita bread stale and all curly in the edges. Save your money on that dish.
Old Town Scottsdale revolves around this place.  If you visit, have a drink, late night bar hop and enjoy.
Nice bartender. Calamari was awful. All you taste is the frying batter. Sushi rolls were fine. Beer was cold! Happy Hour is better spent elsewhere.
The food was pretty good; although the meatballs were a little too drenched in soy sauce. I wish the bar was a little bigger. They only carried a couple of beers and I like variety...all in all, it was pretty good.
very nice staff, great wine selection, and incredible food.\n\nhave been going there for 5 years, have had one bad experience out of 40.
Not only is the food delicious but the service was amazing! We ordered the meat and cheese platter with a caprese salad. It was the perfect combination for a hot night. We took our time, enjoyed the food and we never felt rushed. Now it's your turn!
You've got great food, no cover, stripper pole, beer pong tables, midget bar, strong drinks, fun atmosphere, no dress code, patio, food... What isn't to love about this place?
I think they did a really nice job with the remodel and expansion, not long ago. It is a Walmart that doesn't feel a  like a slum.
Three words: bland, expensive, bland. I went with a friend and she ordered a ham sandwich and I ordered crab cakes. We were both disappointed and found this place way OVERRATED. I think you pay for the atmosphere because the food is just your average lunch.
Man, this store is bad ass! If I lived in the area, this is where I would be shopping!
The Phoenician is a dated property and in need of a facelift.  Spend your money elsewhere!
A wonderful experience as usual.  The only hiccup was when a bartender was rude to us, but the a manager (Matthew) swooped in and made sure we were completely happy!  We love the Phoenician!
I will never take my vehicles anywhere else! This is the best, most honest and great Company. Thanks!!!!!
Just wanted to agree fully with Bill (the other reviewer) for his review regarding the event 'Beat the Heat Winterfest'.  I don't understand why this event wasn't canceled when it was so hot with no AC at the facility.  An incredibly disappointment.
Wow this place is awesome!!! Cool people and there's a hot lady that works in there. Yup. Go do some business at Hilands Cigars if you like good deals, and chilling!
Disappointing and not very good.
AWESOME chips and salsa! I ordered the Carne Asada steak and it was cooked perfectly! Their double Cadillac margaritas are AMAZING!
Food was tasty. Service was SLOW.\n\nI have been back twice since this dinner, and my two-star review stands.  The food is no doubt good.  However the wait time is extremely lacking and will make me consider other establishment in the future.
I have eaten here a few times and have had amazing food and good service. This has been my wife and I place for dinner over the past couple of years. The food, is fantastic and the service is great.
We had the Mezcal drink! Great. On to the Duck confit stuffed Rellano. OMG. The best we've ever had!
Service was spotty and the kitchen was not clean. \n\nIt used to be my favorite restaurant in Arizona now I'm debating if I'll give it another chance.
Great service and good food. It's a standard classic breakfast place that has all the expected menu items. I had the pancakes one morning and eggs another and both came out really good.
Everything is awesome.  Guac.  Their unique version of carne guisada tacos.  Carne con Queso was unique.  Redfish was tasty as well as the filet and Grouper.
Food was decent but not amazing while the service was pretty slow.  Atmosphere was rather stale and uninteresting so I'd recommend take-out.
A good place to meet with some friends for some drinks, but I agree with the space issue.  Just moving from one side of the bar to another can get downright acrobatic.
Now offering free towel dry with #3 or #4 which are $8 and $10. Your simple and mediocre drive thru car wash. At least they aren't trying to sell you on much!
All I can say is wow. Easily some of the best Italian food I've had. You certainly get what you pay for, the portions are no joke. If you are in the mood for a classy, delicious Italian dinner... this is the place to go!
Great night was had with 20+ guests. Have had Indian food in parts of AZ, as well as New York and Australia, this was one of the better places that's for sure. Staff were friendly and attentive and the meals were served quickly. Well worth a return visit.
I'm all about the tiki thing and the patio but this place is just trashy. It's obvious that this is first on the list for every guy who just turned 21. Everything had a thin layer of barf on it.
I could go into a long story about what happened but basically the girls taking cover and the bouncers can't count and are douches.  Will never go back to the place again.
Great ambience, okay service, boring food. Food was typical \"fusion,\" heavy on the pseudo-Chinese influence, kind of like a Thai-inspired PF Chang's. Definitely not terrible but I won't go back.
Service was as good as could be expected.  Atmosphere was very nice with elegant lighting and smooth jazz playing or Spanish guitar, thus the Fusion.  Food portions were generous and presented nicely.  Will definitly frequent this place.  Thank you!  Steven
Heard about this place from friends. Was excited to try it. Not really impressed. Food was just flavorful enough to not be bad. Meh....egg rolls were mushy inside. Sugarcane chicken was ok.
Horrible Customer Service!  No smiles, no personality, they called me \"You\" the entire time I was there.  Very Bad
i really want to give it 5 stars but my carne adovada sometimes is kinda fatty. i love this dish but hate sometimes picking through fat. they do have the best chipotle ranch ever!!!
One of my favorite restaurants!  Love the Enchantment Platter. The Habenero burger is the hotest hamburger I have ever eaten.  Its awesome but beware!!!!
Fun building to be in and great, fresh mexican food.  This place is off the main strip of old town but worth the detour.
I have been going to Don & Charlies for years and am amazed how consistant the food and service is. Love the creamy cole slaw, liver, Seattle Salmon and especially the ribs. The memoriabelia is a Major League plus.
Went to Uncle Sals last night for dinner with a bunch of friends.  We had a great time.  Friendly, gracious and efficient service.  The food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable.  We had everything from seafood to chicken.  Everyone raved about their entree.
Love this place. Truly one of the best Italian restaurants in the valley.. Great ambiance. Authentic Italian food. Very reasonable priced as well. Great service
I have never had a bad meal at Uncle Sal's. This is the type of italian place that has you unbuttoning your pants at the end of your meal AND taking left overs home! Great wine selection too!
What a waste of money.  I got home and cleaned off all the missed spots and glass that wasn't cleaned.  Not to mention when I was there I was hassled to upgrade to everything, even fixing my windshield. WTF
Do not go here! Horrible service! Horrible attitudes!! Stay away!!!!!
Oldest tavern in Scottsdale, and still the least Scottsdale of any bar in Scottsdale.   Go early, go late, its always good.
Definite dive bar in Scottsdale, but fun all the same.  The regulars and the bartenders were great entertainment!  Cheap beer and good people watching...fun place for a Saturday afternoon!
Came here for the first time. A roach crawled on my arm the first five minutes. Not a good thing.
I heard the music from the sidewalk and wouldn't even walk in. What a basic and lame name. I did not see any reason to go in there. I would rather walk around and listen to Andre Nickatina.
Place was good. Very friendly owners. Menu was good if you're looking to stay with a familiar territory. I could defintely tell this was a place many regulars go. We found John to be a very nice guy.
The guy working there was nice.\nTheir food is not great at all.\nThere is a full bar, which is nice.\nThere is nothing on draft (all bottles).\nBut they accept credit cards, so that is good.
Terrible in every way, worse place I have eaten in recent memory and it is expensive.  This must be a front to launder money because I don't know how else they stay in business.
Average sushi.  Young crowd.  Good happy hour.  Much better sushi can be had elsewhere, but it can be quite the swinging scene if you are into that sort of thing.  I used to come here when I was in college if that tells you anything...
we are huge fans of their reverse happy hour on sundays. we get great service and are out of there before the uppity crowd arrives for some fool-snobbery. ra is a great sushi staple in the valley.
Overpriced and not even very good. They were ok when I didn't know of better sushi options in Phoenix.
Awesome lunch specials for crazy cheap.  Greta sushi as well. Never had a bad experience.
I ordered the spicy shrimp whichis noted as very spicy.  It was so NOT spicy and NOT flavorful.  However I had a nice time inspite of the food.....
Love this place for Mexican food and margaritas.  My fave is their fish tacos, but all their food is good.  Prefer their outdoor patio area to the inside restaurant.
The food at this place was quite greasy and lacking flavor. I wouldn't call this place authentic as it's just a lot of fried food with greasy yellow cheese. I do NOT recommend this for visitors looking for authentic Mexican food.
Yummy!!!!    Very good.   Wow, calzone personal can feed two.   :)
You want Italian? You're no where near New York? Go to grimaldis. NY pizza at its  finest. Great service, great food, great venue. Thank you!!
Great reception upon entering and great food!  No one will be disappointed (unless you are looking for a real fancy place with fancy menus), but I bet the food at the Italian Grotto is better!
Owner is an arrogant prick!!! Don't care if the food is good or not, but there are too many good restaurants in old town to give this guy your hard earned $$$$
Nice ambiance and good seafood for AZ. Would definitely recommend this place. Waiter also gave us free dessert!
Did not like any of the art/photos on display.  Is it really art?  Photos were a bit disturbing, but not in a good way.
Me and a friend came here after dinner at the Pink Pony to have a drink and people watch. Great service and a pretty center bar to relax. I'd like to come back for dinner here.*
The Office Max in South Scottsdale get's the job done. They have a good selection of office products.
This place is downright awful.  The only reason I'm giving it one star is due to location to Old Town and the staff were nice.  Otherwise it would get a negative score.  Pony up the extra dough and stay at the Marriott or Hilton... you'll thank me.
High end coffee shoppe with a local \"feel\".
The service is ok, but the staff always seem put off or distant.
The people that work here are amazing. All of them. They're not only friendly but they take care things. Great experience every time.
This place has the coldest beer in town period and the hottest bar dancing women after 9:00pm in the planet! at midnight the real fun starts, but that's a different story best experienced and not told. this is a biker super hot spot during Arizona Bike Week.
I love the pizza here. I come here all the time with friends. The pizza is always delicious and the lunch specials are incredible when it comes to price. I have only had a couple encounters with snotty teenage workers but otherwise it has always been great.
This is a fantastic spot for views & a healthy lunch!  Love the Bento boxes...all under 400 calories & delicious!  Keep it up Sanctuary!
I love Roy's - almost everything is delicious and the service is top notch.  \n\nThey no longer serve bread and butter?  What's up with that?
One word: NIRVANA!
At Rita's kitchen restaurant staff is somewhat condescending; I got the entre size salad on a dish so small that is difficult to eat out of. Food is OK, expected. Big hang out place, bar area seems to be more popular.
Lovely...swimming in the pool with that amazing view alone is worth the trip.   Maybe you'll be as lucky as I was and a hummingbird will fly next to you to have a drink from the pool... Heaven, no: Paradise Valley!
A favorite place for more than a decade. Very consistent and an attentive staff that has been there for years and years.
Great atmosphere great ice cream and burgers friendly staff best DQ around looking forward to come back again
Food and drink are great.  Service is always really slow for happy hour.
Lon's is heaven. Sit outside at sunset and smell the pinon fires, watch the sun go down and enjoy the great food.
A wonderfully leisurely Sunday Brunch
A friend recommended Lon's, and I am thankful that she did. I went there for brunch, and thought the food and atmosphere were terrific. The price was also very fair for a meal of that quality. The service was also quite good.
This restaurant is always a treat. Great food and great service. The outside area is a wonderful experience.
The food is excellent, the wait staff is efficient, the place is dull.  Don't go for the vibe.  It's really, really dull.
We went in for late snacks at about 12:00 on a Saturday night. The waitress was new and ordered us the wrong food and it took for ever to get to our table. The food was just okay.
I was pretty disappointed to find out that they do not carry any type of yard art or Talavera pottery... \nI'm always looking to add a little something.
The Chicken and Gyro meet are great
I enjoy good Persian food. This place is good.  Cherry Rice misses the mark, but everything else is tasty. Very affordable too.
Great tasting Persian food. The quality of food is just great.
Not sure if this has changed hands, but the gyro I got had minimal meet at best. Big dissatisfaction. Won't be back
Best place to eat in AZ
Good gym overall. Filled with a few meatheads and people posing for competitions but they don't bother anyone and provide some entertainment. I appreciate that the trainers are independent and you aren't haggled to sign up for a session with them- they are just there if you need them!
I like it for the selection of beers, however, I hate the bar itself. I would rather go to Total Wine and bring my beers back. \n\n4 stars for the selection\n2 for the shitty bar atmosphere\n\n3 average.
The orange blossom beer is great and the staff is friendly enough. However, waiting 2 hours for your food is unacceptable and I would only recommend this place to people who want to hang out for a while and drink beer.
I've been to Papago and handful of times and love the low-key tavern like environment. I have only tried their Orange Blossom Beer- It is tasty. I want to go back and try their food.
Without a doubt one of the best and most friendly places in town. The Filet is the best and most tender. Friendly staff and seller service. Don't miss it
Should be 3 $. 10oz filet $48. Presentation looked good, sauce on the ribs and chicken was a little thick, salads were very good and so was the bread.
I don't understand why they act so unfriendly and provide such loose deadlines. Two weeks was what I was informed that it would take to fix my unit. I followed up after 9 days and was told now it will be three weeks and they haven't even started working on it.
Seriously, Woohoo! As good as it gets. The world would be a better place if all the stores treated their customers the way they do at Bob's Bike shop. Dale is absolutely awesome.
One of my favorites! Ive been there twice and got the soft shell crab which was exceptional.  The oysters are very good too for apppetizers and so is the manhattan clam chowder. It looks very small from the outside but the restaurant is underground.
This place has awful customer service and a bad attitude. It was like being in eastern Europe where attendants think they are doing me a favor by selling me something. No thanks. I won't be back. Meditate on that.
This place is THE best place for Italian Deli sandwiches in all of Phoenix (but located in Scottsdale) the bread is incredible! It's definitely an institution! Just GO!
Always will get my tires at Discount. Service and prices pretty much are hard to beat. The staff is always helpful, friendly and knows tires. HIGHLY recommend them!
For a membership only place, this place was very sub par. The food was something I would expect from a local dive bar, not a country club.\n\nThe only redeeming factor is the view of the course/camelback and the strong drinks from a limited bar.
These guys did a radiator flush for me a few days ago - The manger was the one that helped me - he was fantastic!
Been going to this car wash for a few years now. It gets slower and slower every time. Sat in waiting area for an hour last time. Not going back. 15 workers and its terrible
Ace is always more expensive than other places, but the folks there sure are helpful and know what they are talking about.
This place it is not a buffet and will not honor the 15% stays the contract has expired,therefore will not do it. Overprice and unfriendly customer service.
I went for their lunch buffet and was expecting a buffet. It was a few dishes and the honey chicken turned my mouth into a glue trap. Haven't been back since.
Okay, I love Oregenos and wrote glowingly about Ray's and NYPD a few days ago, but this is not them. It is something I crave every so often, so I really need to learn to fight these urges.  Ugh!
Super expensive. Half this stuff you can get online for 3/4 cheaper. The people who work here are also pretty rude and almost none of them are knowledgeable about their products. It's like they get their stock from adamandeve.com and then hike up the price 60%.
They have a decent selection but make sure to look at the expiration dates of the condoms you buy here. They frequently sell expired condoms. Or at least, condoms with incorrect expiration dates. I have better luck buying condoms at gas stations. Watch out.
Went here yesterday and was extremely disappointed. Both of the bagels that were ordered were burnt to a crisp (see posted photo). We got the bagels to go, so we didn't notice until we got home.. Really disappointed
Terrible customer service- did not answer their phone when I called for the status of my truck. I was quoted one price and charged more. Never called when my vehicle was done- would not recommend this place to anyone!!!
Ra is the worst place to go for sushi.
It was nothing special. Slow service by tiny ladies. The potatoes we had with brunch were not so good, and the menu selections were skim and did not show much originality. However, my girlfriend LOVED the smoked bacon!
I liked the food here, and the service has always been good.  I've been here for lunch with coworkers or to watch a game with friends.  No difference in quality at any time.
I've always had a great experience with this place.
Whisky selection is limited. But food is good. Crusted calamari is a delicious appetizer
Beer was great, atmosphere was great, food was great.
Awesome Atmosphere and Awesome Beer.  Great building with plenty of outdoor seating.  Got the Fish n Chips and they did not dissapoint.
Food was exceptional for a brew pub.  Beer was some of the best I've tried.  Service was prompt and courteous.
Best beers you can get in the valley.\n\nKiltlifter, SunBru, 8th Street, Peach Ale you can't go wrong with any of these.
Needs to turn on their fans for lunch dining area because its super hot in Tempe area. Overall, i like the music atmosphere is amazing. Customer service was okay but lunch rush hour was busy. Love the burgers! :)
Amazing patio at night! Perfect for relaxing! I love that it is in the heart of Tempe, but doesn't feel like it! The veggie burger & Kiltlifter are heavenly! The Oatmeal Stout is perfect for winter!
Goog food , great brew , a bit hot inside this place . Tv's are small to watch the game , bathrooms are dirty
Can't go wrong with their IPA!
I use to enjoy this place. But, I just had a bad experience for lunch. I even heard my server talking to his colleagues about how bad the tip was from the previous table. Also, they were out of the first two beverages that I asked for.  Will not be going back anytime soon.
The cornbread ROCKS it every time.  It sort of reminds me of Thanksgiving corn casserole.  And it's free!\n\nI recently had the chili relleno and it was tasty but could have been heated up a bit more.
Scale of 1-10 (single visit):\n7 Food\n9 Service\n7 Atmosphere\n7 Value
Makes me hungry for In-n-Out.
A solid place to get a freshly prepared burger. I like their onion rings also.
Great shop.  I can't 89 agile why anybody would complain about speed of service.  Slow is better when doing mods.  This ain't jiffy lube.
great salads and their fries and chips are to die for.My friend's love their grilled cheese (not on the menu) and i've always had awesome. service. Great place for lunch and a good beer!
We had to put our own tables together to accommodate our party of 8.  The service was very slow.  The server was forgetful.  AND... The Chicken California flatbread pizza gave my wife food poisoning!
The food is excellent but the service is horrible.  If the service was even just ok I'd give them 5 stars
Holy cow!!!! Best chorizo is right! Glad I checked the yelp reviews. I made fabulous breakfast burritos & killer burgers from the chorizo. This is my new jam 4 chorizo & tortillas
Pretty solid Ethiopian food. My only comparisons are Chicago-based, but this was a nice find. (This is really late...so I hope they're around and still serving the same I had - it was awesome!)
Hidden charges, flavorless sauce, crust wasn't cooked long enough, and they delivered the wrong toppings.
I've had this a few times since.  Delivery takes forever, customer service is god AWFUL.  Seriously, these people are such assholes.  You get what you pay for, and this place is still a ripoff.  Should never be more than a star.
One of our old standbys... friendly service, great food and not too pricey.  We always seem to get the spring rolls (Gai co cuan?) and beef with noodle bowls (Bun Bo Nuong) and I love the home-made lemonade
Oh god. Yes.\n\nThe Pho Tai here is pho king incredible.\n\nBest in the pho king Valley.
Great Pho and fast service.
Breakfast all day. Healthy portions.  Tiny diner but food was very fast.   No substitutions and no Amex.
Other than a couple waitresses with big jugs this place doesn't have much to offer. The food is bland and over priced. Only positive thing I can say is that that they warm up their muffins.
Great for breakfast/brunch! Delicious and hardy meals. We were served extremely fast and the atmosphere was fun.
The corned beef hash comes from a can, and includes an extra side of hashbrowns.  Yes, that means hashbrowns served with hashbrowns.  Are these people dumb?
Chipped beef on toast, corned beef hash, biscuits and gravy and eggs maximillion all excellent!
Common eat spot for my work peeps. People literally fly in for the Big Rigg! I somehow always order and pay for a cookie, but never see it, though. Suppose it's just some sort of karmic \"fat tax\"
Took forever to get tab. Felt ignored
This place is closed...\nNot sure why yelp hasn't updated the information yet...
This place is pretty trashy, I'd rather smoke my hookah at home.
Fun little concert venue with indoor and outdoor stages.  They have Hop Knot on tap which makes me happy.  Would not ever have a mixed drink there again however...there is something really off in the flavor of their fountain soda.
The tandoori chicken was overcooked and dry. The chicken tikka masala was a bit too salty. They serve garlic naan and give you free chai tea so that was nice.
Love to rock climb... But the staff at this gym were extremely rude and impatient! Won't be going back here because of them
very authentic but thats about it badly poured guinness and awful bangers and mash bartender was friendly but dont think ill be returning
Good vegan junk food.  Honestly, stay away from the healthier-sounding items - most of it that I've had tastes nowhere near as good as the sauce-drenched fried seitan sandwiches.
The food is good.  They put a little thought into their offerings.  If you like meat, I recommend you avoid the 'mock\"; no matter the form, mock does not taste like chicken.  If you're a mock eater, you already know Green.\n\nMike
I love the food at Green. I've tried many other vegan restaurants in the valley and Green is by far my favorite. Please consider opening a Chandler location, I would be able to go way more often.
Stopped by with my son after the zoo.  Clean, friendly and the food was good.  Portions are quite large, so definitely a great value for the price.  We will return.
Good neighborhood sports bar. Friendly staff and good management. Enjoy the pingpong n bags games for outside patio
This place has zero customer service. They lost my clothes after I confirmed they had them. The owner looked at me and told me there was nothing to do. She is miserable... DO NOT GO HERE!!!!!!!!
Great food!! The Tadiq is my fav. Love the Cornish Hen also. The kabob and steak kabob are awesome!! Yummy !!!
We went there with high hopes & but got disappointment.\nMany of the items had just rice with charred vegetables without any spice. Even meat items had no taste. We felt it too costly for the quality we got.\nDesserts were okay.
they always take great care of our little girls, even though one of them is not very friendly to other dogs. they give meds, frozen treats, and for extra, will offer play time and more treats. i especially like the report card they give you at pick up.
Use to stop by for the cheaper gas, fell in love with soda fountain!
Everything I've ordered from here has been pretty good. I will often stop here when I don't feel like cooking and the food comes out fast. The atmosphere isn't the greatest, but I'd you're doing take out that shouldn't be an issue.
Three words:  food borne illness.  Frankly, their food isn't tasty enough to warrant the risk.
Friendly wait staff.  Authentic ingredients.  However the shawarma are nothing like I had in Kuwait.  The shish kabob is worth getting.   Basmati rice needs some work.   The market next door is great.
Great meeting place for a family dinner, friend get together or to use the big room upstairs for a party. Really good skinny margarita! Their salsa is a little watery. The street chicken tacos are really good!
They've just never been a bike store that is really pro cycling, I mean not really there for cyclists. Everything is an argument, the work they do sucks, they have cheap bikes that are better than department store shit, but only just better...
This is mostly for the Imaging Center. \nGreat service; love the staff.\nGreat rates on processing.\nGo shoot some film and get it done here.
the food was good. beans are delicious. however portions are too small (compared to black bear where I usually do breakfast)the service was ok.
The desserts are a little bland and are pricey given the small size.  I've had better Japanese bakery items elsewhere.
Banana Shake and Seasoned Fries. \n\nStick with that and you are good to go!
Hard to complain, fast service, good prices
Nice small caf\u00e9 shop with machine sales on the side.\nBut as for coffee....not many choices & tasted bad.
It's cheap soup with cheap veggies, but when you're a college student and you're hungry and poor...this is a place to go.
low prices for an eclectic selection.
Attended a seminar here. The rooms were spacious, and catering for breakfast/snacks and lunch was good. The parking lot here is fairly large, so finding a space isn't too much of a problem.
Fantastic food for fantastic prices (from Chicagoan point of view!) and the service could not have been better. The pear & Brie Fremch toast was unique & delicious!
This place probably has a delicious full menu. But I wouldn't know. The prime rib and the Filet Mignon is so succulent and yummy that I have not bothered to try anything else.
Very good food! I tried it after the article about 21 best sandwiches in Phoenix. The Reuben was good, but looked nothing like the picture. Great place to enjoy a great AZ day
Went for Mother's Day.  Food was awesome and the waiter recommended the perfect wine.  Very impressed.
Food was good but the service was the worst ive ever had. To top it all off, my server charged my card a different amount than was on the receipt. $17 more to be exact! Will never go back.
Meh.  Had the filet and it was a little bland.  My salmon was very fishy.
One of our favorites... Great service, delicious food \n, and nice ambience.. Perfect for date night
Cozy atmosphere in the inside and lovely patio. Food and service was great both at lunch and dinner. I highly recommend saving room for dessert. I would have given it 5 stars but I just wasn't a fan of their cocktails.
It's a dive but I swear this is the best grilled chicken sandwich I have ever had.  We used to come here a couple times of week when I was in college.  The BBQ sauce is to die for.  And it is so cheap.
Loved the food, but I've had a hard time going back, as they only take cash.
This store is expensive, dirty, and basically a place to walk to when you're too drunk to drive to a real grocery store for more beer.
The food was disappointing to say the least. The panang was extremely watery, the sweet and sour chicken, which was supposed to be pork but she got it wrong, was mostly vegetables light on the chicken, and the chicken pad see you (spelling is way off) was extremely dry.
Very disappointed. Ordered chicken Pad Thai to go and I didn't notice until I got home that they put tofu instead of chicken. The flavor was very plain, there wasn't even peanuts in it. Don't recommend.
Great place on Sunday afternoon and sitting outside. I'll be a regular.
My all time favorite bar of all time. I frequent here at least 3-4 times a week. I have been doing that for about 4 years now. I will never stop coming here. Amazing drinks, food, beer selection, and most off all the staff! Keep it up Casey's.
I stopped here for gas and lunch one day. The employees are very friendly, fast, and great with small talk and I had no issues with my sandwich, but I can understand the frustrations of the girl who found a hair in her sandwich.
Fish dish was decent but really salty.  Didn't like the taste of the broccoli. The green beans were very good.
Our waiter Jason was great however I was not a big fan of the hokey pokey dance the staff had to do.  It was a bit loud but it helped drown out the sound of the man behind me hacking up a lung. It was high energy and a nice change.
A bit dissappointing.  I have no idea how anybody would rate this place higher than a 3/5.  For those with a 5/5, what are you thinking?  All I can imagine is the place is paying you to post on yelp.
Rent affordable! Accepts dogs of all sizes and breeds. Staff is friendly. Quiet neighborhood.
We survived inspite of the stale food! Several items on the buffet were just plain stale. Not sure how these guys are in business.
$100 for an oil change. 45m wait. Is this for real. Not impressed. Super crappy waiting area.
Positive: fast and accurate service. Close to my office. \n\nNegative: Nothing ever tastes right. The fries are limp and the frosties have an odd taste and texture. The chili is served the wrong side of warm.
Super friendly staff! They made my out of town drop in feel like home. Huge studio that can fit up to 100 students
This is the worst Einstein ever. I go to my normal local Einstein and in comparison this place is like going to a 7 eleven. Never have coffee brewed and the employees ignore you when you come in.
I ordered a couple of items from this place and nothing was really that good.  The speed of the order and customer service was excellent, but the food was average at best.
fyi they moved to a new building about 300 feet down the road..Dont be fooled by the new building same old clowns working.
I like!  They have a good selection for us vegitarians, however the consistancy in the sauces is not head on.  They deliver on time and are very courteous.
Tall soy chai tasted like any other one that I have had at Starbucks. The BFs drip coffee did not taste like it had been there for a decade.... and they had a mug his mom wanted (she collects Starbucks mugs).
Perfect place for take-out.  The dining area isn't the fanciest, but the food is great.
Great prices and helpful staff. Free pool water tests and free advice to keep your pool crystal clear.
After getting ripped off by Leslies Pool for Pool supplies and repairs, I now go miles out of my way to shop at B & B for all my Pool needs.  They are HONEST and reasonably priced. All of their technicians are knowledgeable in Pool maintenance and  repair.
On the Go - Eat at Rubio's\n\nWant fresh food in a clean environment and excellent service with smiles? People on the go eat at Rubio's.
I have been to Tott's many times and I have tried almost all the dishes on the menu. KungPao and Angel Hair soup on the menu are amazing. Great for college students.
One of my favorite places for lunch. Similar in style to places like Pei Wei, but much better quality.\n\nMy favorite is the Chicken Pad Thai.
Honestly the food is not bad at all and very short wait time and portions are large but I always get it to go since it always stinks in there which is very unpleasant they need to remodel seats are torn walls are dingy
What a store! I've never actually been in a Fry's until the other day and they have EVERYTHING! Books, music, video games, washing machines, tvs, everything. It's like the Walmart version of Best Buy.
Bad attitude  never thought I would not go to a McDonald's  this one never go back. Always trying to up sell  please its fast food
Best donuts in South Phoenix. It is the one thing that makes working over there totally worth it. The maple bar is fantastic.
great pizza, pretty fast and good quality and freshness.\n\nThis place is affordable, you have your usual big screens, the breadsticks were fantastic.
I'm not a big yelper  but this place has gone so downhill is worth warning the masses.  I use to have faith in this place but no longer.   Horrible job,  long waits.  Go elsewhere
Wasn't impressed at all. For price I expect better quality. Chicago style Pizza was burnt and wings where not even crispy.
The windows and doors are boarded up. Apparently, it is closed!\n\nThere is no way to get any food. So, I would skip this one.
= = = = = =  CLOSED  = = = = = =\n\nSorry to see Him's JL close.  I liked the place.     :-(
Greg is so professional and knowledgable. I have older windows and tried to get estimates from other companies but no other company knew how to properly install blinds with my complicated windows Not only did Greg know what to do, he did it for a better price!
Love it here!!! Must try their hot & chunky salsa! But you have to ask for it ;) taco's rock!!!
This place and other local spots like the Teepee remind us of a far gone time when our Mexican food was predictable and when our standards were low.  But sometimes that hits the spot.  This place definitely has some history, just ask Marty Robbins.
This arena is fun! Outside area reminds me of downtown Disney with all the music, people and food. Inside is clean but they need to lower the AC a little bit during the hockey game. It was too cold even for my male family members.
Not a big fan but Tax free yeah!  Off base has more selection and you can find deals. Unless your buying a high price item i would shop elsewhere. The lines get bad so don't be in a rush.
Ordered the Sicilian special.  Worst I ever ate.  Majority of pizza was tomato soaked dough.  Something tasted stale on the toppings.  Disgusting!!!  This place was actually recommended. Lol what a joke!
Grease Paradise. You can smell the grease from two blocks away...
Horrible customer service. I have to wait 40 min. To return a charger that doesn't work.
Friendly service, great food  and always very clean....this is especially impressive since this DQ sits right across the street from a High School and a block from an Elementary School!
What's to be said?....   it's Walmart's version of \"big box retail\"...  I it's huge, clean and has friendly staff.
Fantastic course.  Don't play slow or they will get on you... but a beautiful course, good pro shop...
Great food, superb service, wonderful menu.  My go to place for an elegant date night ... as Yelp says \"Yay! I'm a fan.\"
Why do I do this to myself- we had visitors so we had to do Harolds, crappy food, spotty service\nBut FUN!
Been here many times and it's always the same. Slow, confused service. I only go back because other Cave Creek bars aren't much better. Now with Oregano's opening I don't see myself coming back to Harold's anytime soon.
Food was good, atmosphere is fun.  If you like country music you'll love this place.
Live bull riding night, bbq galore, indoor and outdoor bar. View of rodeo action can be crowded. At the front door an open barrel of salted peanuts in the shell. You can even toss the peanut shells on the floor.
Really enjoyed the atmosphere and the food was good but don't order a side of beans...not very good and weren't worth the money.  Wait staff was great and food came out quickly. Would definitely go back.
Terrible  we sat at the bar and never received service ,,,, bartender was rude and spoke only to the locals.\nNot worth free beer
This school has been an amazing part of my daughters development!!!! We thank Roy, Kathy and the rest of the staff of CCM for all that you have done for us and Alessandra! I would hands down recommend this school to anyone!
The flowers were beautiful - just as displayed on their website - and they were able to fulfill a same day request.
Awesome place to stop for a beer and a burger when out on the bike... I great conversation and service. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed.
The buffalo blue cheeseburger is delicious.\n\nSmells good had to stop\nCan't get enough of that blue cheese buffalo burger smells and\nTastes so good you got to try it.
Clean, great service, great smiles, and the cooks know when it's time to take it off the grill... Eating breakfast starting my Saturday with a great Denny's start thank you.
They were great and helpful.  We had our youth soccer shirts done here. They got the shirts to me on time and exactly how I wanted them to be. Very affordable and would definitely recommend them.
.....ya know, I should have known better! never settle for less cuz your in a hurry.
its a good place for  awesome fish fry all you can eay on friday nights.yummy, so if you are in the mood for fish drop by.
Nice place for homemade food. Large portions so you will not be hungry , and affordable for senior citizens too! My mom likes this place. Cod & ribs & prime rib & breakfast are pretty taste !
out of business.
Jim and his staff are top notch, honest, and reliable. If you don't take your car to them, you are just stupid.
Love this place. Its like a neighborhood bar, but all grown up. You can enjoy a nice delicious meal. The entertainment is always great. Make reservations, gets crowded during the summer months. Service is outstanding.
Great food and great prices...been a regular here for a few months.  Really nice it's 24hrs since I work nights.  And I always hit them up for the $5 for 5 mini tacos!
Friendly? Yes. Fast? Never. Billing is always messed up. Drugs are never ready when promised.  So frustrating to deal with. I would much rather deal with the other compounding pharmacy that doesn't make me waste so much of my time.
I found nothing wrong. Nice staff. Food was fine. No complients here :) mananger was super cool.!
We went for breakfast on a busy Saturday morning, about 9 am. Food was delivered fast and hot. Omelette was big as the plate. Homemade jam for toast and the cinnamon role was divine!!!! Service was excellent!
Absolutely horrendous service, pizza that is basically worse than frozen pizza. The waitress was 100 and we waited an hour and a half for them to forget our order. Ridiculous prices for the service and the terrible food!
Website pricing is cheaper than what you will get charged at this location. Attendant and cashier both agreed, but just shrugged it off. As for the actual wash, they do good job.
Excellent family owned atmosphere.
MONEY MONEY MONEY GIVE US MONEY\n\nThere's not even a single cross at this place. It's more like a casino for adults, the house always wins.
We spent our anniversary here.  It was a good place to do so.  Very quiet and nice, but not a lot happening.
Small, quiet casino - check. Clean, spaced out machines - check. Drink options followed by food - check. Low traffic = little smoke - checkity check!
Update. Im sick of coming here and having them tell me after a long wait in line that theyre out of whatever im looking for. Please. After a few times i get the picture.
Buffet is good. Theater has shows all day for $6
angry dealers, nasty tables, not worth the gas even when you live around the corner
Been eating here for years. Service and prices cannot be beat. I will continue eating here every chance I get until I leave Vegas.
$12 for a tiny Beef on Weck sandwich and fries... $11 for a pound of wings (that's about 7 wings)...$18.25 for a large cheese and pepperoni pizza... Overpriced bar food to say the least.
Perfect for the locals to avoid the hectic crowd and pricing of other theaters at the casinos.  No need to park at  a casino and pass through it to find the theater.
Just good food very cheap. The staff loves my son and we have been coming here since I moved to Henderson in 1996. Good local place to eat. We love Frank the drink guy!!
One of the best dive restaurants ever. The portions are generous and the quality is consistent.\nThe corned beef hash is amazing and the service is efficient & friendly. Great value and worth the visit.
Food was average but waitress was terrible! Asked what was on cajun salad...she didn't know and didn't offer to ask! She tantrumed when we asked for separate checks. She rolled her eyes when my friend asked to add a salad.
They have the best music band!!!
Came in super late for some munchies and to cure our sweet tooth. I got the bread pudding and my friend got the french toast. The food was solid, but the service was less than desirable. The bartender was more concerned with her phone and gossip than being personable to us.
Sit at the bar, Jordan is awesome, friendly and always positive.   What an awesome bartender!
You're greeted by the hot air and the sound of slot machines as soon as you step out of the airplane. You know that you're in Lost Wages!!! The shuttle system is quite good, and the shops are nice too. Checked baggage also arrives promptly.
I'd give it 3 starts if it weren't for the fact that you can walk around with booze and you can play slots.  Other than that this place is not very special.  I think I'm bitter because I took US Airways.  Never will I ride them again.
Plenty to do at McCarran. Tons of shops and places to eat.  There is even a 24 hour fitness. Slots everywhere, Wolfgang Puck has a place to eat here as well.
Great airport. Easy to navigate, good shops and decent food
It's a nice airport and has many places to eat. Security seems to get you in & out quickly.
It's Vegas baby how bad can it be?
Eh...could they make an airport any longer? This place is packed and hard to maneuver through, but its convenient location and only real option into Vegas makes it \"good enough\"
This place reminds me of Fear and Loathing...
Try the pretzel dogs. They are good.
Nascar weekend, 1 shuttle running from TSA to gates, no very smart.  Almost missed my flight.  Also on a time change day.  Your killing me.
The people that work here are rude! SFO definitely way better.
Won $14 playing the penny slots, oh yeeaaah...
Easy airport to get in & out of, & convenient stores & restrooms all along. It would be nice if WiFi was free.
Renovated and gorgeous. Plus arriving here is just the best feeling in the whole world. Just writing this review makes me ready to party
I imagine at least a solid 60% of people who are trying to catch morning or afternoon flights out of here are hung over. \n\nWho thought it was a good idea to make this the loudest, brightest airport in the country?
old airport, no wifi, no charging stations.
This airport should be better..
This place is all right. Check in was a breeze (maybe because I came at 4am!). Yes it's old and outdated, but there's free wi-fi, so that's a plus for me. :)
It was my first time in Vegas. The airport itself isn't as large as what I had expected it to be. Easy to walk and navigate through. Watching people still playing on the slot machines before boarding their flight was a hoot.
In line to get my CES badge for the show, the line went pretty fast !
Excellent service...clean..organized..nkt too many shops..but usually one is done shopping as theythey've vegas
it was pretty cheap to fly to las vegas. depending on how many days you book ahead, you can save considerable monies. southwest has easy checkins. a long list of departure times and they leave from oaktown!
Flying on this airline is so much worse than driving. Anywhere that the flight is under 2 hours I think I'd rather rent a car and drive.
It's a dirty location with a foul smell of piss inside. From my short visit it's apparent their main clientele are transient.
Good hearty Asian style breakfast, brunch, lunch. Chicken, good.. crispy and moist. Platters are huge. Saimin was excellent. Long lines, but worth the wait. Mahi Mahi was pretty fresh.
This place is a gem for a local food lover... The plate lunches are awesome and the won ton min is huge!  The hotel it's located in is a dive but this is worth visiting.
Pretty good place for local food at a reasonable price. Like the korean chicken plate.
Get like 20 spam masubis.
This place is soooo Ghetto! The only reason I came here was because this Cigar lounge was inside this casino which ended up being a bust as well. This casino looks so dilapidated, dirty and dingy.
I came for the signature tamales and left wishing I would have gone to el sombrero.  the food was shlockely prepared and lacked flavor.  it was also lukewarm.  service was equally thoughtless.
i love this place. i have been going here since before the moved it into the old church. the owners are nothing but sweethearts and the food is delicious and totally inexpensive. plus i just love the atmosphere.
Friendly and helpful staff. Clean and well kept spaces for the pets. Ive been a pet owner/ foster parent my entire life and this is one of the overall best shelters i have been too. Highly recommend finding the new addition to your family here :)
It's a bit on the cheesy side and could use some major remodeling but my 2 year old enjoyed it enough.
Perfect for a local band, and the cajun fries aren't bad either. If there is a neon reverb band playing there, or another local band..you can always count on a good dive bar experience!
Awesome place, especially when Tori is working. She rocks.
Nice selection, local hangout spot, poorly located. At least currently it requires a walk slightly out of the comfort zone for some. Worth it if you aren't too cautious though.
I will never use the greyhound again, it was awful. I was going from las Vegas to CA. The seats were uncomfortable, the tvs didn't work, the driver was rude and the employees werent helpful.
I was unsatisfied with all aspects of their customer service process. they did not explain things clearly. their policies are not meant to help you and i had a very unpleasant experience. save yourself the trouble and fly with rates so low. i would give zero stars if the option existed.
Maybe the Best Pizza in Vegas
By far the most greasiest pizza I've had in Vegas. Total disappointment.
Good place to grab a quick lunch, weather you're looking for a slice of pizza, sandwich, or pasta.  Be sure to check out their daily specials!
Oml this food tastes like crap!!!The waitress is so damn slow!!They should get someone faster!It is also in a really bad area!!The food is disgusting.Dont recommend it
I went back a second time and they have changed the way they make the Wellington.  It now only comes one way you cannot order it medium well or any other way.  Just thought it was funny after my initial review.  Still very good though!

Ok - I have a new favorite downtown!  REALLY great place.  Makes all the others pale in comparison.  Cool slide into a shark tank in the middle of the place.  And the breakfast was incredible.  Didn't really win any money gambling, but had a great time.
poor in room Quality, but Close in Atmosphere.  The Hotel seemed more personal, not too extreme.  staff is friendly.  The gift Shop sales Liquor and I won $500 one night and $1600 the next on the same machine.
I didn't stay at the hotel, only went to the buffet.\n\nAll I can say is, It's bad when the best part of the buffet is the beverage.
For downtown this was a great experience.  Free parking, nice friendly staff were everywhere for whatever question you had.   NIce pool and water slide too.
Great hangout nice Pool area!
Went back here for a few days, was in G10 penthouse, could not sleep tell 2 am , to loud outside, music blasting, bad room for sleeping,
2 weeks after being promised a credit for 1 night, still nothing!!!  Was on the phone over 45 minutes with no results....
Close to downtown if that is where you need to be.  Cheap room.  Terrible food from room service, raw steak full of grizzle.
We are frequent visitors to Las Vegas and stay exclusively at the GN; rooms are clean, staff friendly, great restaurants on property and location is perfect.
Smaller than expected and none of the cast members were there.
Just a regular old pawn shop. I think I expected to see one of the cast members there, which probably would've made it a 4 star experience. Still, it's something to do if you're in the area.
Don't know why they call this buffet world famous or award winning!!! It's just a regular buffet nothing special!!!
For the money, best buffet that I've been to in Las Vegas. There are better buffets, but you'll pay a lot more. The food here was good, and the area was also clean. I'd recommend this place over the much pricier places.
Very good informative tour! It's all outside in the Boneyard, so bring a hat, sunscreen, and sunglasses! Also probably better to do a morning tour during the summer.
Very fun! I would try to go at 6:30-7ish because not all the signs work so its best to have dusk type lighting. Buy your tickets online ahead of time it's only 20 people per tour.
They don't carry bagel chips anymore and everything in there is easy found in Hawaii.  If you're from the mainland and looking for treats from Hawaii, I'd recommend asking a friend to send it to you.
The buffet was ok for $11, but it was not worth the drive from the strip.  Definitely a spot for locals and not snobby tourists like me.
Good, clean, white-trash fun. I fit in quite well.
HORRIBLE BUFFET! TGIFridays is good as usual with a great staff.  The layout is great and there is no shortage on gambling options. Can't wait for the construction to be done.
This is my favorite boa location. Staff is helpful and friendly. It can get busy tho especially with all the retailers banking here. \nI don't mind it because after your done there is so many food places around that area!
Don't get the chi foot massage. They advertise pressure points and reflex. I spent $125 for someone to rub my feet. It was terrible. No skills. They need to change their description and their customer service. Very unsatisfactory.
This restaurant is terrible the taste of The foods are awful and they serve with lack of utensils and the worst is the drinks comes in a styro foam cup . I will never recommend this restaurant at all.
Tandy leather has all sorts of supplies and unique leather pieces for you to make your own bags, belts, anything leather. They also have iron stencils for burning into leather! Such a find!
It's ok. its a good price for what you get it's about the same price is Panda. it's definitely a hole in the wall
Expensive and not that good ..the food is kind of bland. Being Jamaican myself they could do so much better. Will not be going back unless it's for something they don't cook. I was not impressed at all.
You know you're in for a bad meal when you hear\n\" DING\" come from the kitchen. This is the most flavorless Jamaican food I have ever eaten. I will NOT return. Booooo!
Good tables.\n\nWeird brutish customers.\n\nIf you go in a group, you'll have a blast.  But if you're looking to come here to practice pool by yourself, I don't recommend it.
The ladies room has a vending machine with sexual practical jokes in it for $0.75 which are not worth the price.
Definitly enjoy the pad-thai, very delicious food.
Me and my friends call this our last stop before leaving Vegas. The orange chicken and Mongolian beef is my absolute favorites. Best hangover food other than stake and eggs.
The garlic chicken is awesome. And the pad Thai is about the best ever.  We checked out the reviews and was do happy we did.
Always good and great lunch specials.
dissapoint on pricing, food didnt satisfy the spot,.2.star.for friendly staff
I have been coming here for 6 years and have always had an amazing experience.  The bartenders are always friendly - and in the dinning room, Jen is an absolute amazing person to have serve you.   Also, way cheaper for quality drinks right next to the strip.
For a chain this (flamingo ave) Ruths chris is in my top ten of all times!\nOpen till 3am awesome wine great steak and service. I have been to four RC's and I think this is the best.
Sucks! Wanted to do baby registry. They tell me to do at kiosk. After create password. It said password not match. Asking for help. Nothing we can do at the store. You have to call the hotline!! Why I'm here for!?!
Been going here for over 20 years... The owner is always very friendly and classy   My clothes always come out smelling fresh and the price aint shabby either. Definitely worth checking out.
Dim sum food came out cold.. Service is poor.. No detail on check out bill..I will not come here at all ...
Love this place, good prices, good service and the food is awesome! Now let us dance......with swords!
I've always done take out here & the pizza has always been consistently good!!!
Decent 80s style pizza, but I prefer more of a kick to pizza sauce.
Loved the pizza, garlic nots and salad. The atmosphere could use a updo, but service was good. Price fair. Great marinara, and awesome thin crust pizza. Highly recommend.
Their 50% off for locals is a big rip off. They add on 18% gratuity on the full price of the meal and to top it off their food is not very good, it's mediocre Italian at best for their prices.
This was a fantastic experience.!    Eric Schultz was a great host.  The beef carpachio was excellent.   The service was as good as the food.   Family owned and operated.   We had a 6 course meal for two on our anniversary and the cost before tip was 140.
Went last night for a late dinner around 10pm. The service and ambiance were great. I loved the entertainment. The food was pretty good except for my lamb. I ordered it medium rare and it came out well done. It was the worst lamb I ever had.
They need so much help with their security system in the Bowling Alley.  We had some things stolen.  ....they also need to get that Friday's out of there.  Baaaad service.  Baaad
Buffet here is terrible on Friday night seafood buffet! Crab was so dry it wouldn't come out of the shell! And for $20 bucks per person, the Alliante Friday night seafood buffet is much more worth it!
Fun, safe day at the range. Customer service is outstanding, we came in to shot on the range. One of the staff members looked at our equipment and asked to check it out the next thing I know he's tuning us up. thanks guys
Great service every time. Just good old fashion dinner food. Large portions at good prices nothing more nothing less.
Was not impressed.  Server was rushed. Food was low budget.  Tasted like instant potatoes.  Waitress admitted the Green beans were canned.  Peas in chicken pot pie were canned as well.  Have had much better experience at their ST George location.
This is one of my favorite places for breakfast. The service is always friendly and attentive. Food comes out amazingly quick. I highly recommend their Bacon Benedict, and a stack of some of the best pancakes you'll ever have.
Lots of IMAX theaters here, Great popcorn, all the most current movies are always playing and it's removed from the strip (but only slightly) so there's not an issue with crowds.
Seats are very comfortable.
I've been charged twice with my account and they refused to give my money back, I had to make a claim against them. The place is not very bad, but the staff are rude, and as well as residence.
This hotel is off the strip and I think all the fun of Vegas is in the heart of the strips so if you are not there then it sucks. It's hard to get around like you have to pay for taxi and everything so I would recommend staying at another hotel in the strip!
First time at Rio - check in at 5 took 20 minutes - now at taxi everyone trying leave Rio - this place suck & will never stay again - I stay cuz of friends - not worth my time or money!!! Stay away if u under 35
The Rio is aging, somewhat gracefully. While it's not the best, it's not the worst. One thing I found odd, there is nowhere at the Rio that has a selection of craft draught beers.
Great, Authentic Mexican food.  Found this place on Yelp and it was great!  Home cooked food with home/family feeling.  Would have never stopped at this place just by looking at the outside.  Well worth it
This doctor was extremely rude and did not listen to my problems. He spent more time explaining that he doesn't prescribe narcotics than he did explaining what might be wrong with me. (Note: I never even mentioned medicine to him other than what I already take)
Love this gym. Everyone's so nice n helpful. No weird-o's stareing at you making you feel uncomfortable. Great equipment. Always go early in a.m. for best workouts
So I just cancelled my membership after 6 years or so, no hassle there which was good. Got a refund for the remaining time. \nIt is a nice place, but I started taking yoga, privately, so no need for the gym for now.
This place is open 24 hours and have an excellent fast food/pizza menu. Try out their philli cheese steak pizza. Chicken burger and chicken wings were decent too. Reasonably priced. If i had to choose i will stick to pizza though
Bad customer service. Cheaply made marble tabletops are dangerous and the manager will blame you for them breaking.  I won't be back here again.
Such a waste of money! I was very disappointed when I came here for my friend's birthday dinner. It is $27.00 per person for food that is not that good. I usually enjoy Asian buffets, but I was not thrilled with this one. I will not be back.
I typically use the drive-thru and can expect to wait about 5-10 minutes before I get my burger combo and go. The food has always been good and worth the wait.
great view, great service, food could of been way better and price was way to steep.. i felt like i was paying for the view
The view at the top the Palm hotel is amazing, the service was impeccable, but the food was average french fare artistically decorated.  No one is my party of 4 was wowed by this restaurant.
Excellent value, exceptional quality. Absolutely the best AYCE sushi in Las Vegas. We've tried the others, but nothing compares to S21!
$4 Value Slam gets 2 pancakes, 2 bacon, 2 eggs. Perfect balance. Good food A+ service. Keeps me away from cooking at home. Winning.
Terrible!!!!!! greens were burnt bad, had 3 or 4 fairway greens. never again will I go there.
I only go here to buy carne asada.  It's not as salty as Cardenas meat.  Fast in and out.  Buy some green onions for the grill too...
Best selection, cuts and QUALITY of meats in the city. The NY Strip and delmonaco are outrageous... Now THAT'S what a steak is supposed to taste like...!

Got ripped off on an in store pick up that I ordered online, received one action figure instead of a three pack, beware when ordering from toysrus.com and picking up at this location.
Ghetto! No wi-fi and room service stops at 2pm!! Seriously disappointed. Jacuzzi didn't work right. Furniture was falling apart. Very sad hotel.
I dont know why everyone bashes the excalibur. I recently stayed here and it was great. Everything was clean, nice flat screen tv, walk in shower. Got upgraded for free too. :)\n\nThe pool was off the hook!
A GREAT value for your money IF you get the rennovated rooms in tower 2.\nHowever, the casino and the buffet are pretty disappointing. My advice is to get your room here and expect to party elsewhere.
Don't get fooled by the low rates. Excessive charge on the internet, uncomfortable and torn beds.
small casino area but i did have better luck with the $5 min roulette table beats the hell out of aria $15 min bet. the buffet was good for its price wish they had more food options. free luggage storage great for an early check out an late flight out.
This is the cheapest place to stay on the strip, i dont consider circus circus or stratusphere the strip. It is alot of fun staying here.
Fun casino with lots to do for the whole family. The arcade is one of the largest I've seen on the strip with tons of affordable games and tournament of kings is an awesome show
Gets the job done, large rooms, good location.  On the other hand it is run down, a bit dirty and smells funny.
Nice facility. Dealing with the behind the scenes of exhibiting can be challenging, but what do you expect?
Large facility was part of the tradeshow for info comm. fits a lot of people and easy transportation
Dans cet amas de junk food, vous cherchez de la cuisine saine ? Vaguement europ\u00e9enne ?\n\nGo there !!!
Terrible service...  way overrated osso bucco.. gave 10 bucks off from my complaint and argued with me that it was one of the house favorites. . Taste like crap on my opinion
There's a good selection of frozen drink options here.  The 190 Octane was average, but the Bellini was disgusting.  It was super sweet and tasted waaaay too artificial.  The prices are very affordable and it's worth trying.  Next time, I'll get something else.
i have only tried the bagels and bagel sandwiches here and i go back weekly.  enough said :)
Way overpriced. Ironically, in a bad neighborhood. The price range is incorrect, it's NOT \"Under $10\". Under $10 you can get some tiny side but that's it.
The best calamari I have ever tasted in my life. The sangria is also amazing. It is a very nice environment but if you don't get there early then be prepared to wait up to an hour and a half for a seat.
Skyler the bartender was outstanding. Should be nominated bartender of the year!!!! Great drinks and service.
Great fun, & great food. Usually crowded so get there early. Our group tried 4 different entries, and they were all good.
Service was great. We had to wait for our table but they quickly took an order from us at the bar for appetizers and drinks. The menu had plenty of choices and the food was excellent! Great atmosphere!
First time staying at Harrahs and the rooms were decent. Only problem we had was the noise factor!! We were on the 15th floor and could hear the live band out front all night long in our room! It was very hard to sleep!! Casino and dealers were great!
Casino review.  Place is run down.  Slow to get drinks.  I like their Lake Tahoe hotel/casino location better.  Luckily place was too expensive to stay.
In line for check in at Harrahs with people lined up going out the door and only one person working at check in. Amazing. Seriously one elderly lady all by herself.
The hotel itself if fine.\n\nThe internet is horrible. Most pages won't load, if they do it takes 3-4 minutes.
I booked here with a very good deal from expedia and it was on the LV strip. That's why I chose there. It wasn't that bad but if it wasn't on the strip I would look for somewhere else.
Food was OK, but service was awesome! Our original group of 10 ballooned to a group of 20, and they didn't blink an eye and accommodated our group's last minute changes.
See my other Yelp under Forum Shops!\n\nBut DAMN - I love this store and the Forum Shops.  Wonderful experiences.
This is a decent Mexican restaurant with great staff and a relaxed environment. We had some wonderful beef enchiladas and a nice dining exerience.
This is a great way to avoid the 100+ degree temps. The shops are high end but bargains can be had if you look around. The restaurants are of good quality with none any better or worse than the other.
The food is made to order and tastes great.  It's a small place and based on the food alone, is probably busy all the time.
Everything is good. Tacos, Enchiladas, and Mole =)
3 stars for the revolving carousel bar.  \n\n\"Bazooko's Circus is what the whole hep world would be doing Saturday nights if the Nazis had won the war. This was the Sixth Reich. \"
worst hotel in vegas\n\nsuck ass!!!
Circus Circus has not changed much since 1995, except that the buffet is $15.95 now instead of $4.95 back then!  The decor is stuck in the 1980's and the rooms are, unfortunately worse, with wildly circus-themed decors.  Much better choices!
It's certainly a start and is convenient for getting around to some places, but it really ought to go all the way to the airport.  Also, considering the short distance of travel, $5 is quite a lot.
There was a salesgirl named Jen here and she was great! She was this little bubbly thing and helped me get into my size four birthday dress........thanks!!!!!!
This place is terrible. So bad we lied to get out of staying a second night. Light and air don't work. It's liken a renovated motel 6, so shitty
went beyond my expectations!!! food,ambiance and service was awesome. I highly recommend the firecracker shrimp and the grilled chicken with cilantro cremation. we will definitely be back.
This is good old school Italian. For $32 We got soup (delicious minestrone) or salad, garlic bread, very good veal parmigiana, a full liter of house wine and a delicious cappuccino for dessert. It was worth the cost.
If you don't have a reservation don't show up. They tell ya 45 mins and it turns into 2 hours. Not worth the wait when hunger.
Food was terrible. Completely flavorless. Sauce was watery. The free wine is not drinkable.
yummy...good portions lovely atmosphere!
A standard Godiva store, but who doesn't love delicious chocolate? These tantalizing treats will give you the pick me up that you undoubtedly need after day drinking and $hopping!
A great place to pick up your snack and beverage essentials for your room.  Don't forget to pick up bottles of waters so you can stay hydrated after a day of drinking!

Very helpful every time I visit.
we each got a salad and it was fine.  nothing too exciting but left quite satisfied.  the rolls were delicious and there were a few varieties so that was fun. i might eat here again if i'm in the shops area but won't be rushing back.
I  like this place. Good price, good value, taste is good and service is good.\nPretty romantic too....
Had a catered dinner here with 40 colleagues. Food was very good, service very good. Great location - even enjoyed a live string quartet playing in the \"courtyard\" outside the restaurant's entry.\n\nDefinitely would go again.
Place is nice. Food is good. Ordered the roasted half chicken. It was superb.  It had a crunchy skin and was well spiced. Bartender was a good wine selector. Service was well oriented. 4 stars due to a higher price.
Last night we came to Canaletto for my 30th birthday! All I have to say is delicious! Food was amazing, service was great, and the view of St. Marks square was nice too. All around great experience. We will definitely be back.
The employees spend too\nMuch time with there backs to the customers talking amongst themselves instead of focusing on providing better service!
Awesome property, bur the first night our room smelled like onions & ketchup.. Tonight it smells like fish sticks. We want to move but nothing is happening. Lame!
This place sucks. Be careful when making reservations you have to tell them you want the grill.  40 bucks for dragon roll...come on. 25 bucks for four pieces of sushi. Should have went to Mandalay Bay or Luxor for some fine seafood.
The food was good but I would like more for the price I paid. Service was not that great
These people are Scam artists. They quoted me 3 times the amount as everyone else and gave me a 4 week turn around. I took my car next store to metropolitan auto body and paint and they did it in two weeks and helped me with other damage with no extra charge.
Big crooks liars people Jim is the  biggest  thief .he charge for parts that not need to be fix or replacement .watch out people from this place .
This hotel is amazing.  Love it.  The only downside, its expensive if you're price conscious.  Besides the room, plan on spending $15 per drink at the pool bar, etc.  If pleasure ranks above money when booking your next Vegas trip, stay here.
Such a beautiful hotel & the fact that they're connected to Encore makes it super easy for you to get your clubbin' on! The view of their golf course is absolutely amazing. A huge patch of green in the middle of the dessert.
RIPP OFF !!! they charged for a soup and egg white $45.00 at the casino !!! That is insane. Their staff is rude and impulite!!\nI will never, but never ever, go there again.
Reasonable place located about a mile away from the strip!  Rooms are not bad either!  Wish the waiter service was better!
Was here for breakfast the other day. Food was good and the service was excellent and quick!\n\nFood: 4\nService: 5\n\nOverall: 4.5 rounds down
Pretty average. Would equate it to a Chili's or Red Robin. Service was 5 stars. And the local music they had going was 5 stars too. Drinks were a little steep... food was good, just not very unique.
I couldn't even detect the hops in what they assured me was the IPA. The rare sirloin was the rarest rose. The breakfast burrito was good. Service was quite friendly. Smoky atmosphere, of course.
Contacted by a marketing person from Ellis Island for more info about the incident. I responded...then never heard another word. Really think they do not care about customer service. Clearly enough people show up for the cheap food. Whatever...just sad.
No idea how this place gets such high ratings. Service is terrible, slow, uninformative, no follow up, not good.  Food was average.
This place is ... too great to be describe when you want good food and cheap price!!! I had all my breakfasts there when I was visiting LA because that was the first thing that came into my mind when I woke up!!!
Meh.\nPork chop with eggs was dry. Bread had a very salty butter. Buddies steak was good. Don't care to go back.
Gets the job done .had a Weiss and a light beer ... Got me buzzed and I think I've had enough ;)unpasteurized beer is good for you in moderation .
We use to come with all our friends for their steak special but we were really disappointed the last few times we came.  Never mind the service is slow, the food was not worth the wait.
Not a good service experience after the third time. They give preference to people who arrive after you and i would not reccomend going there. Terrible experience from the OWNER.
Gandhi is awesome. Please don't take my word for it, go try their fish tikka and fish pakora and I bet you you'll fall in love with it. This comes from a foodie who loves authentic fish!
Sure you get what you pay for.  It is probably the best value in Vegas -- if fanciness is not high on your priorities.  It feels like a family place.  Casino is fine.  Buffet is a little lame but we always go to the Peppermill anyway.
Never going back. Got to our room broken pieces of hard candy on the carpet and on the shower nob, hot cheeto on the side of the night stand.
You get what you pay for and the Riviera is no exception.  The Casino is definitely dated but doesn't feel as dingy as it could.  The rooms are comfortable and the pool is decent.  Worth leaving the property to find good food.  The walk to the strip is fairly quick too.
Being generous considering we found two bugs. The beds are comfy,  staff is a little pushy on hotel promotions, not the cleanest but not the dirtiest.
The girl Sarah at the Makeup Forever counter is fantastic!!! She knew what she was talking about and made my night!!! I looked fabulous! I am so coming back for every event. Love it
Naw, I went to this club at 10:31pm on a Saturday night and there were no strippers on the dance floor! I asked the bartender when they would come out and she was like, \"I think they could be getting dressed.\" All of them??
Best Pizza I've had so far in my 29 years of existence! lol.. it has moved over to MGM grand for those that don't know
I really enjoyed the burger joint. The sandwich was great and to be honest leaves you wanting more. I enjoyed my experience.
Worst experience!\nWe sat and ate here. The service was ok but their chicken sandwich was absolutely terrible. I'm not a fan of McDonalds but their dollar menu sandwich is probably better than this $7 something piece of tasteless food.\nNever going back.
3 words: Bigass Souvenir Shop
Its a cool place to visit.  Somethings are cool but i found a lot of things to be overpriced.
Nice to look at, but it's much more crowded and everything's more expensive than the NYC location.
Another store in the sea of souvenir and tourist trap stores on the strip. This place does have cute souvenirs though they seem overpriced. T-shirts and towels for $20 each is a little steep given the free advertising I would be doing for you.
Dollar corn dogs on tuesdays...Score!\n\nLocated conveniently in the Fashion Show mall. \n\nFunnel cake sticks are amazing and only  $2.75.
Partying all night in Vegas would not be complete without a night at Drais! Hot hot crowd. Coool people. Easy to get in. Not easy to leave.
Staff was very courteous, we were there for a private Super Bowl party. It was all catered and very nice although the game sucked ;)
Spazzing bartender started a shouting match with some friends of mine. If you like the smell of sewage over cigarette smoke, then this place is for you.
Not bad - great location - $1 margaritas (small but yummy); outback steakhouse & denny's is connected to the hotel.  It's a decent place to stay if you just need a place to crash for the night.
Yummmmmmmm  eeeeeeeee!  Taste eeeeeeee!
Place was not good. Food taste bland and it is way over priced for what you get. Orange chicken was nasty and so was the fried rice. Won't be coming back here.
After making this place my first stop in Vegas every year for 10 years this will be my last. Service and good was way off tonight. I could get better at a Panda Express
Had the most amazing dinner with my wife on her birthday!\nThe sirloin was the best I've ever had, and I recommend the cheesecake for a after dinner desert.
Best steak in Vegas!
Amazing prime rib was so tender. The green beans are a must. The only downside was the price. $125 for the surf n turf!
My ny strip was very tough! Thought my knife was dull, but it was not. Would not come back!
Terrible service and terrible drinks!! Will NEVER go back!! Total waste of $200!! Ugh!!
Surprise! i loved this place. Great chips, good drinks, music, dancing, the works. The food was great. the staff superb. Wish I found it earlier.
Loved the Happy Hour!  Their bartender Frank is super friendly and made us feel very comfortable.  Taquito appetizers were fresh and very delicious.  We came back every day of our stay.
Terrible service. The guy was very mean. I'm glad I am just a tourist. But don't go here. There are other great kosher places around town. Jerusalem grill has a friendlier staff.
This place USED to be the place but the owner has tripled his prices. I will be finding another repair place.
Quick and easy money exchange at great rates. Funny thing is, the ladies behind the counter have not traveled much. But they are making their kids travel (study abroad, live abroad, and so on).
Great transaction. Ladies are wonderful and gives you awesome advices.  Validated my parking stub too. Tip: we found place easily by reading other comments on here. Rates are awesome and worth the trip.
We walked in for happy hour... took a look around... smelled like a funeral home...\n\nWalked out....\n\nMaybe this place is good if you are retired....
My chicken parm was okay. But my mom ordered the salmon and that was amazing. My Aunts was also ok and why it only got 2 stars. I would expect for consistency especially with how prices all the food is. Having to track down your waiter is another reason for its low score
Conveniently located at the entrance of the Mirage, its a great location for grabbing a quick beer.   My only issue is the two fat tire beers cost 15 bucks...yikes!
Good lord, the Chinese food here is totally dumbed down American style because it tastes nothing like Chinese! I swear their Kon Pao Chicken pass off as dog. The only thing I dug was the atmosphere for it's supposed to be tip top classy.
From the apps to the desserts, I have not had a bad meal. Yes, you can find one in most major areas, but its good food. Why not hit the places you know are dishing out consistent meals?
Good food restaurant was way too hot!!
Chris, the shuttle driver is awesome. He made my day and is a reason I'd stay with Super 8!
Food was very good.  Had an oyster sampler plate with various types.  Salmon was cooked to perfection.  Overall a fine choice.
Avoid at all costs. Horrible service and horrible food.
Total loss, the bread was like wonder bread, the pasta was good but the sauce lacked any flavor and the price for the portion was minuscule. You shouldn't go away hungry from a 23 dollar Italian entree.
One of the best meals we ever had.  Can't rave about it enough. The VIP martini was awesome. Rochelle was our waitress and she was great. Must try this restaurant if you are in Vegas. Not cheap though so bring a full wallet.
We love this place when we come to Las Vegas.  Highly recommended for the steaks!
A must every time I go to Las Vegas!  Get the lemon cake.
If you like mediocre food, slow service (like really, really slow), and indifferent food servers, then this is the place for you.  Oh, did I mention they are also way over-priced?
Great stop waiting for a concert to start. Friendly staff, good drinks!
I ordered the crispy salmon dish on a blended pea sauce.  The blended pea sauce was actually refreshing.  The salmon on the other hand was nothing to rave about.
Horrible experience!! Service is slow and food is not properly cooked. I order fetuccini pasta with steak and they overcooked the meat and brought it cold. This restaurant does not provide fine dining, I do not recommend this restsurant to anyone.
I stayed there for 4 nights and was very comfy! there is a cute little kitchen and they leave you a basket with cheese,crackers,and fruit. beds were very comfy! will come back!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Awesome indian food and service.
Very good Hotel.. Food tasted really nice.. They have a $50 gift card for $40 that you may possibly use immediately if you bought this before seating. Also, they may give you 15% of if you are group of 5 or more..
Had a bad experience, you couldn't get a place to sit unless you spent $700 plus on bottle service. Had half the club roped of and empty. FYI it was $45 a person to get in we stayed 15 minutes, it was that much of a downer
Slight mishap with being given salmon when swordfish was ordered but quickly fixed, very pleasant server, everything was fresh, food delivered timely and at a non rushed pace. Overall another very good experience.
Great atmosphere, food was comparable to Chilli's or Applebees, very entertaining.
Come here if you want to spend $50+ per head on burnt, bitter steaks, soggy vegetables and weak sour drinks.
nightmare! the reservation line and hosts are not on the same page, we waited for an hour in line anyway for overpriced, average at best food and elephants that were heard but not scene and \"under construction\".
Not very good the atmosphere was ok. The food was ok. We had a lot of kids with us and they were not that impressed also. There are better choices in Vegas.
The food is really nothing special. The great thing about this restaurant is the ambience. This fish tanks are gorgeous and awesome .\n\nFOOD = nothing to brag about. Still a nice time though.
Definitely not coming back ever. Though the sushi was good but you can find much better places around town for cheaper. Their servers are pretty bad and not attentive enough.
All I have to say - hot waiter!\nOh, and the pizza was awesome too.\n:)
CPK in Vegas is the same in LA. The servers were very attentive and we never had an empty water glass. :D ENJOY!
Loved the Prime rib. Great potatoes and Salad and wine. Waiter was friendly. Atmosphere was really good. Will go back hungrier next time.
We went here to have dinner first night in Vegas and after waiting and watching them sit four different party's that came after us without we left. Just RUDE!!!
Rooms are nothing special \nGym is small\nFree Drinks and Breakfast is only reason to stay here
Much better gambling return than on the strip.
This is the place to stay. If you don't mind being just off the strip and are looking for a great place. It has it all
Very impressed with this hotel. First time here and I must say this place is incredible.
why go any where else? Food is the best on the strip, best executed,wine list rocks with interesting choices, and the view is well, the best in Vegas
Great view. The best creamy French onion soup I have ever had. Love the staff. Love the menu. Try the lamb burger it is to die for.
Great view but the food is average and the service is ok.  If you can just go for a drink and eat somewhere else.
Great food, incredible view, excellent service. What more could you ask for. We've done the prix fix many times and just ordering off the regular menu is great too. Can't go wrong for a special occasion dinner here.
Great view, food, and service. My GF and I went here to celebrate my return home from deployment. Wonderful experience!
Had 9:00 PM reservation...finally was seated at 10:30 PM. Food was mediocre at best. Dinner for 2... $500.00. Not worth the money. The view of the fountains was the only thing favorably memorable about this resturant.
MUST to avoid. Confusing system, indifferent service, sloooooow, bland food.
Great Starbucks coffee.  Enjoyed the worship team.    Pastor kept my attentions with his style.  Enjoyed the message.   Reminds me of other Mega church styles, including Elevation in Charlotte. Central, in Vegas and Saddleback Church, in Southern CA,
Food was good, waiter wasn't personable or friendly. Asked if I wanted a refill when I still had food on my plate, one glass minimum I guess on dr peppers?
My children love coming  for dinner here. Always great food and tasty desserts! I love their coconut shrimp - ymmy :-)
Great selection of flicks, but management refuses to hire enough staff to man ticket window. Got here 15 minutes before start and couldn't buy tix in time. Line for tix machine ultra long too. No respect for customers.
there's only one reason i come to Chili's and it's their to die for  Southwestern eggrolls.  delish!
I get the Chinese donuts. I don't know why they are so mind blowing but they are just amazing!!!!! I recommend trying them if you have a sweet tooth :)
Maybe the employees shouldn't use the main entrance as their smoking area. Was disgusting having to walk through the 2nd hand smoke of 5 employees right outside the main entrance. \nKosher deli is nice.
Reopening this friday
NOT NYC style pizza. More like the pizza I had to suffer with in Buffalo, NY. Thick crust. Garlic knots with hardly any garlic. Cannoli not good either. Don't go there looking for NY style pizza!
This cafe was so good. The raw pizzas and burgers were excellent.  They also have a large selection of fresh juices and shakes. The Cookies and Cream' shake was my favorite.  I strongly recommend this place for any raw food enthusiast in the Vegas area.
Not impressed. The clothing was geared toward women in their 50's or 60's- like the matching outfits and printed pants. The prices, even after the discount, was not much lower than department stores like Dillard's. I tried going back but I didn't find anything.
Probably the most terrible customer support I have ever encountered. after being berated by the office manager over the substance of my call I was then told in other words to go to hell. I will NEVER receive services here.
Never had a bad meal here. Love their Singapore noodles plus service is great
This iHop was ok. The food was alright, has small quantities and very expensive on breakfast items even though its dinner time. The staff was alright but slow.
I just called from Calif.to buy an anniversary gift for family in Summerlin and was put on hold by the manager listening to lame elevator music for way too long.  This is not good customer service.  Hope they're better in person.  I'm taking business elsewhere
If you are looking for a Young Israel, keep looking. This Kiruv centric,  Aish Shul is great for a weekend or two but don't move to this side of the city if you are Modern O or more observant, you'll get frustrated fast.
Great food. Great service. Monday's all you can eat crab legs for $25! and they have really great bbq.
This is one of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas. It has amazing food for the price. \n\nI am also weary writing this review because I don't want that many people to know about it.
The laziest service employees you will ever encounter.. They will thwart you right from the start, give you all the kinds of excuses not related to your car's complaint and problem just to reject the job..
Every Vegas local's favorite sandwich shop. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu, but the most popular sandwich is The Bobbie. It's Thanksgiving on a sub roll, and they do it perfectly at Capriotti's.
I have not met Dr. Miller.  I go there now because Dr. Canfiled retired from his practice and sold it to Dr. Miller.  The dental hygienist was the same and she does a fine job.
Adam is a great teacher, he keeps the kids engaged in the class and laughing. My daughter's skill level goes up every class. She lives to go and looks forward to it all week.
I was charged $130 for a $60 tire, $20 for $10 tire tape, and $20 to put the tire on the rim. Outrageous
Mediocre.  Too much quantity over quality. And whats with the HUGE beverage glasses. Waitress didn't know much about the food. Have to say tho', had a better experience at their location near Las Vegas airport.
This is the best Mediterranean restaurant I've been to. The koobideh was fantastic.
The curry is bland and so was the hummus.
Great service, love the Gyro and Athens Fries
Great food and fun classy atmosphere. I love the menu because there is something for everyone. Everything I've tried has been good but my favorite is rice pudding with Turkish coffee. And the hookah lounge is a great place to hang out with friends after dinner.
They don't do AYCE :( but prices are reasonable otherwise..since we pretty much ONLY do all you can eat, we won't be back. Picked up a few rolls to go and quality was okay, not the best.
The tilapia filet as well as the babaganoush and the loubieh are amazing! Fantastic service with great fresh food make this worth the drive off the strip!
Came to watch Hockey and have a couple drinks....no sound and was told they don't turn it up. It disturbs the gamers. Why bother having the TV's. won't be back
I just went in here looking for a leash for my dog and was so disgusted by how sad and sick the dogs they had looked I had to walk out...  Something needs to be done about this place!  All of those dogs should be rescued and they need to lose their license!
I always have great service here but they messed up my order and did not have it available at expectation date.
I e-mailed them my review to give them a chance to reprive themselves, annnnnndddd nothing.
Very lame portions at this location. It's almost as if they have a game going on how little they can put into bowl... Very disappointed! Totally killed my experience at this entire chain...
The smoothies are great, I ask for no sugar because they put a quarter cup in. sandwiches are taste but they microwave the chicken. sometimes they are under staffed and you have to wait a while so give yourself time.
This is the worst location I have tried. Nothing tastes the same as the other locations the staff are like drones not enthusiastic or happy at all.  I love tropical smoothies but will drive farther just to not go to this location
This course is as advertised. Great Fairways, Great Greens, and views are awesome.  My only gripe is there is no grass range. For the price they charge, there should at least be a full sized range. not a small one.
We had a party of 8 for a bachelor party Friday night. What a great time we all had. The service was extremely attentive and fun. The food was very good and everyone loved their margaritas. \n\nWould totally recommend this place.
Awesome!!!! Not your typical Mexican restaurant. Their brunch is out of this world. Gourmet steak and eggs gourmet oysters Rockefeller gourmet green fried tomatillos. Gourmet bananas Foster crapes! At eat myself sick.
Came here while hanging at the pool for a change from the greasy pool food they serve. It was pretty good, not too pricey, and chips and salsa were pretty decent.
Yuck!  Worst all you can eat sushi experience ever!  I recommend that you take your money and go elsewhere.
The best sushi in vegas hands down my girlfriend and i love this place
All you ca eat sushi,Good price in Las Vegas, Missing one star cause Service should be more improved. I ordered a cup of water, it never came until I called the waiter 3 times.
Terrible service. There was a reason why I didn't tip the server and before I left, she stopped me and asked me why I didnt pay tip. Seriously?\n\nOkay food. \n\nTry Blue Fin instead
Been going here for years all you can eat at the top of line sushi and are the chefs here fast the service is great
So dirty, super greasy menu. Dirty plates. Food was bad. Bad interior. Very bad overall experience. I'm just being honest.
Typical diner food. Not bad not good. Egg and I is a much better breakfast place. I had classic eggs Benedict and hash browns. Nothing really blew our socks off. Husband had turkey and dressing. Little on the dry side. Gravy was bland.
Great Ambiance, went strictly for the Hooka and the booze. Comfortable lounge and eclectic music. Waiters and waitresses were very friendly and knowledgeable. Great for small groups.
No stars would be more like it. Management is BAD BAD BAD !!\nWe will NEVER return. \nI don't care how good the food is, BAD PEOPLE !!
I love Paymon's. During the summer they have the best cold cucumber soup! So delicious. The chicken curry, hummus, dolmas, lentil soup are all satisfying... I think I am going to go there tomorrow for happy hour! Yay!
Great food! The food is really good but the hookahs suck!! We had to call the waiter over 15 times to fix our hookah and it was very unenjoyable. Maybe I would eat here in the future but I will never smoke here again.
What a crappy place, surrounded by crappy people to have to get a health card. CLOSED for lunch as we arrived... Are you kidding me? What a racket for unnecessary government fees....
The phone department is very knowledgeable. The geek squad department  is slow and doesnt have great  customer service. They give  you unrealistic time frames and have you  wait an extra 30 minutes while they chit chat between each other in the back
Horrible service. Horrible food. Don't waste your time or money!
Lame reservation policy- needs to be 4 hours ahead or you have to just show up. I think if you have the availability you should make the res. had a small party- now they lost the business- dumb
Excellent food but service was slow.  Sushi is good, no craft beer.  Martini made well.  Very pricey, but location it's the reason.
As always a good meal!
The store is always stinky. It smells like death and cinnamon. They are coupon friendly, so if you're used to being around dead people who loved to chew Big Red gum, please do shop here.
My first jack in the box. Great experience. Ordered at the keiosk amd got some freebirs
I use to have my boots repaired at Jova's but they increased their prices so much I stopped.  Does pretty good work but have out priced himself!\n\nThere are other Boot Repair places in Las Vegas that do just as good work at much lower prices.
Great service and food.  We had the 2-for-$25 special and loved it.
A clean, well-lit place to stay up all night and smoke meth with the townies. I'm dead serious.
This place is a great place to help your kids get started on just about instrument. I would recommend this studio for any budding music learners!
I understand some people aren't happy with FirstService Residential however,  there is a rental department that is separate. FirstService Residential itself does not handle rentals.
One of the most unprofessional companies to deal with. The HOA due was cashed, yet they mailed my mother in law a missed payment letter. Now she has to provide proof that they cashed the check.
Great service and great prices if you have one of the fuel programs they accept and they will waive handling fees with purchase.
this place looks cool, but its now closed. Sadness i never got to experience it
You would have to be white or be with a white person to get good service around here.  I felt a racial tension when I was here last.
Excellent green curry and everything else was tasty. Portions are small... Location is so central and easy to find. Don't be scared by the strip mall appearance.
Food was good but nothing out of the ordinary.  A little greasy.  Would not make a point of coming back
Wolfgang Struck out on this one.  7 member squad and nobody liked it.  Very bland, very boring.  We're all from NJ & NY so maybe that's why??  Wouldn't spend another dollar there again.
Nice people inside, basically just a normal gas station/mart. Only thing thats lame is thats its on a corner so its more difficult to get out of with traffic! Loves it though!!
Food is great as is the service.  The restaurant is large so there is usually no wait.  This is a great family spot.  Give it a try.
Great Place to Eat.. Native New Yorker and I thought I was home with Mom.. Puerto Rican and Cuban food very similar.. Highly Recommend. .
Food was okay, but expected better.  We were the last customers in on a weekday and we finished before closing time, but we felt rushed.  Overall experience wasn't very pleasant.
Filthy store, terrible selection, only two checkout lines open.  Absolutely the worst grocery I've ever walked into.  The store needs to be demolished and rebuilt -- with new employees.  Better selection and prices at a drugstore or a convenience store.
The work they do is great, their prices are affordable. But this place is never open when they say they are.
I have been with sprint for 10 plus years..I have never had a 4G phone with fast service.. I use to pay for it each month.. They have been saying the same shit for 5 years the towers are not up yet.. Don't buy it.
Worst service ever!!!!\nThis office doesn't answer phone calls. They were supposed to pick us up from the hotel and never showed up. This office should be closed!
Quick & Delicious Lunch with a great salad bar!
Great food, decent service at not a bad price. I will go there again and again. In fact we ate ther everyday except one day while we stayed at vegas for 4 days. Will go back again.
I only like this place because I am Indian and they serve good authentic Indian food.  Haha.
Great place to sit down and enjoy great quality food. New Menu and great selections are now available. Was not too impressed with the service this time. Usually pretty good yet today was rather disappointed.
First time there, went to the lunch buffet with a couple of friends and it was amazing.\nTons of vegetarian options. Love it!
Compare to others in this area it has good buffet...I would say next to saffron this is good..
Portuguese omelette is good. Go for it!
I hardly ever go to this location and today I went there with friends. It was empty, overpriced and the beef on the rice was cold. Very disappointing. The one on Decatur is on their game though! :)
I'm Very pleased to see they've closed.  I dealt with them once.  The owner was a rude jerk.
I am a big fan of this place.  Always have been.  \n\nToday they had a demo day, and the guy doing it helped a buddy of mine with some impromptu golf lessons.
fun little course. great practice spot. cheap too. if you dont mind the noise from the planes, you will enjoy it here
Celebrated our wedding anniversary here last night and had a delicious meal. Steaks were tender and juicy.  Service was outstanding.  Thank you for making our meal one to remember!
Wow; what a great Italian place off the strip!  Fantastic food, great entertainment; very fun! The bread and cannoli's are to die for. You must check this place out!
This place is fantastic! Old Vegas lives on. Food is incredible!
Went there on superbowl weekend..loved it definitely a regular place to visit when I go to vegas again. And the free limo ride was a huge brownie point winner.
This place is totally Vegas. Food is wonderful. The atmosphere is old Vegas. The complimentary limo is a bonus. We frequent this joint every time we get a chance when visiting Vegas which is often. There's always a lounge singer which feels oh so Vegas.
Short wait.  Television available in news or sport channel. Bring reading material or tablet to pass the time. Mammography technicians were good. Office personnel really nice but a little disorganized. They really try to accommodate patients in.
great food, great ambiance but a little pricey
Descent hole in the wall local's bar.
Although when I did go it was busy making me wait a long time , I think this place has wonderful employees. Customer service is great. Although some people have very lil patience , the guys don't let any of that get to them .
Its 7-11 what to say? The Staff is funny and they joke around and make your wait not as bad when there is a lone.
Great food and great service. The chicken enchiladas suiza was delicious!
Appears to be out of business, no web site, phone disconnected and nobody there!
You have got to be kidding me?! Old stylists, even older clients nothing new or innovative. I guess this is where old stylists go to die!
Great atmosphere,prices are good,great service and food quality awesome ! Don't  forget to order the Margaritas with fresh squeeze lemon!  \"Outstanding\"The server Carlos was great!!
The restaurant was full of Mexican customers! Need I say more
The place smells wonderful.  The selection runs to mostly white flour breads and a few sweet items.  The bagels are decent--not water bagels, but there doesn't seem to be anywhere in Vegas that makes REAL bagels.
It's a pool supply store.   I usually don't go to these places, but I was trying to get a solar blanket for my pool....I had all the blue prints, but still not enough info!  Really!   Dammmm it, I have to go back again!
First timer here and I can't believe I actually paid $20 for a one day pass. Not even a free trial. Gym was super packed and machines were a good wait. Other than that, they've got every machine. This gym is OKAY.
Dirty all over the food area \nI don't know if even have health  card \nNeed in Nevada to work with food \nTaco stands are cleaner than that place .
The lady was so nice! The food is a bit Americanized but still very delicious. The spicy noodle on Korean menu was especially good.
I've been here twice in the past month, around 7ish. The drive thru takes at least 10 minutes! Horrible drive thru!!!!
Good location but please do something about all the day laborers standing outside. They line up the street!
Went twice in the last two days. We ate at the bar the first time around 4p. Chicken wings were amazing! Fries good too. Came again for breakfast on Sunday around 1030a service was horrible but food was good.
Love the wings at this place they are cooked in the pizza oven . Super crispy .love their breakfast specials For lunch get the get the taco basket !! Service is always good . Food portions are great . Friendly wait staff and bartenders
Love my gym!!! Working out!!!
Was here today the food the service was great left feeling full and complete a lot of bang for your buck
Everything you need for crafts, but be prepared for a 30 minute wait to check out...
Waited for five minutes for someone to acknowledge me. Go to Target on Blue Diamond, much more helpful!
I have been taking my two babies here for years, best docs, best staff, wouldn't trust anyone else!
Got a groupon for the ultimate wash for $5. I liked that they scrubbed the car before it went in & thoroughly dried it after. I will go back again...
Best all you can eat around!
The best AYCE sushi in town. Service, food, ambience, everything. You won't find another AYCE sushi as good as this.
Great drink prices and nice staff in the bar, but sooooo smoky that I could only stay for one drink.
Awsome
We believe the Italian food is the best here. Southern Italian is simple with just the right spices. The problem with other Southern Italian restaurants is they try to make it fancy and it don't work. This place is an authentic traditional Southern Italian Restaurant with great pastas, meatballs, and sauce.
Awful does not begin to describe this clip joint.  Awful service and the food was about on par with a Dennys.  Somehow this place has managed to stay in business. I'll never be back again.  If you want good Italian in Vegas skip this place.
I had anticipated this visit for months so there was a lot to live up to and I have to say bootleggers went above and beyond my greatest expectations. The complimentary bread is so sinfully delicious and the bolognese is comparable even to my immigrant Italian family's recipe!!
I told myself a few years ago I wouldn't go back. I gave you one more shot. Never again! \nMeatball sandwich had two, two meatballs cut in half to make a sandwich. Cheap Fu*cks! All for $8.0.
This is the pizza place we have been looking for! Great service! Great food! They have a full menu of options. Small dining area makes me feel like im back in my hometown:)
Not bad for if you're looking for some quick take out. Nothing good or bad to say. Just your standard strip mall take out place.
A-Ok in my book. Nike SB's are getting harder to find (at least in Nike Outlet stores) but this Factory Store had one so I just had to get it. My current SB is dilapidated so I needed a new one.
Brought my truck in for squeaking brakes. Tech Craig came an got me. Pads are still 95%. He said these will last long time.  No service needed.  Mary at the desk is super friendly.  Fast an honest service.  Just made a new customer. Thumbs up
These people have no idea what to sell you. They just point to the startup boxes when I could have saved money buying better items separately. No knowledge on reptile health. Also sold me a turtle with one eye. Really?
This place is terrible. The waiters are on their cell phones most of the time. Management allows other patrons to scream, yell and cuss at the television as well as other patrons, all while banging on tables and the bar.
The staff here makes the place great! Every time I come here the employees are prompt, polite and really friendly. \n\nAnd the KFC bowl is heaven in a dish.
It seems like every time visit this location they never seems to have what I need. Also some plants don't look so healthy. I go to the other location which is far. sigh
Nice people but WAY too loud for a neighborhood bar.
The Midori Margaritas are amazing! We had the carne asada tacos. They were cooked to perfection!
Every time I shop here for pool repair parts, I get the wrong part. The chemicals (chlorine, muriatic acid, etc.) are not good quality and the place is operated by amatuers/kids.
Just had some of their tres leches cake last night...very good!
I guess I'm not eating here today! Apparently it's a cash only day =(  feel like they could post a sign on the door or tell you as part of the greeting.
This Target is a great Target. It is always stock and clean. The employees are always nice and it is fun to walk around for a little while when it starts to get hot. Totally am in love with Target.
Possibly the best selection of products when it comes to a Best Buy.  Unfortunately, nothing can make up for employees who say one thing and do another.
Great staff and they never mess my hair up, perfect everytime, they so send out great coupons for an awesome cheap cut
Dishonest thieves!!! Stay away
SCAM!  They put synthetic oil in my car when it doesn't need it (confirmed with the dealer) and charged me over $70 for the oil change.\n\nAVOID THIS PLACE for their unethical business practices.
Since UPS took over Mailboxes etc that leaves Postnet for Fedex.  I had a manufacturer return package with tag ready to go and just dashed in, dropped it off, greeted by friendly staff and dashed out.  Simple and easy.
People are helpfully but poised off that the financing lady just her deck and left me there for more there 20 minutes.
I ask to see \"deep couches, ornate wood, dark fabrics\" I'm shown blue couches and I literally just walked away from the sales associate. Huge selection of lame styles.
Used to be better. Beef chow fun had hardly any beef in it. Walnut shrimp over cooked. Chicken Tsao over cooked too much fatty chicken. Yuck!
The worst company EVER!  Didn't even show up.  Booked on Tuesday for a Saturday cleaning and waited around for hours but NOTHING!  When I tried to call the office the number was disconnected.  So disappointing.  So unprofessional.
You all have to be kidding me! I am in town for business, went by all of your reviews and when I walked in, it was nothing but disappointment.  A very very small collection of books in the entire store. Geesh.  They need some stock. So many empty shelves.
Very slow service.  Been here 30+ minutes and my car still hasn't come thru the wash part yet.  No one seems to know why things are taking so long.
Worht seeking out for sure.\nEggs benedicts if really good.\nService is fast and friendy.\nMake the drive from the stip you wont be sorry.
Great food and service! Place is small but comfortable. As soon as we sat down we had someone come to us for drinks. I will definitely go back to try some of the other menu choices.
Coffee and pot of bread great....service is bad!!! Breakfast took 2 hours!!  Food was just ok. Had to ask for to go box twice and then it was thrown on table! Our bus person Jose was the nicest person there! Probably won't go back.
we are here and loving it.  great food and friendly service.  the top breakfsst restaurant on my list.
Easy to make appointments on line or calling in, no long waits for an appointment.  Appointments begin on time.  Dr Steed and staff - knowledgeable with great customer service.  Contacts and glasses come in within days of order.
Great customer service.  Always get you in and out as quickly as possible.   Employees are on top of issues and polite.
Never had a problem with this DQ. Great blizzards. Food took a little while but that's common when you order the chicken strips. Service is always prompt and pleasant.
Dawn is the best.
THIS PLACE IS A COCKROACH HAVEN!!  If you love having cockroaches in your bathroom, garage, front yard, kitchen and even at the pool live here!! This place should be condemned!!!!!
It was ok. The pineapple chicken fried rice was so gross.. The food wasn't hot and not the most flavorful. I wouldn't suggest this place.
I won't speak for the whole company, but I will tell this branch is undertrained very unfriendly and makes no apologies for it.
one word. racist.
Service sucks. They are always messing up orders and are rude to customers. One of their workers was just yelling at a kid for bringing in his skateboard and told him to have consideration. So rude and unprofessional.
Will never go back I have see 2 roaches near the sushi bar and one crawling near my plate!! Great staff. Needs to fix the bug problem!!!
Only place in Vegas that has AYCE sashimi! The restaurant itself looks outdated and old but I honestly just care for the sashimi, oysters and soft shell crab! Service can be improved upon but overall good.
Patience is required as they take their sweet time and it isn't even busy. It's been 30 minutes and I don't know that they'll be done soon. I would come back because it's cheap but definitely not during 'rush' hour.
Worst service I've ever had in my life! Horrible and unprofessional. Don't bother here!!
Very Poor Customer Service :(
Super slow service, mediocre to poor food..I'd check out other IHOP's in the area....not worth your time.
Pretty darn good chicken sandwich, french fries were above average. Chicken wrap for take out was so-so, but I'll definitely be back since its so darn convenient
Mediocre pizza.
Always friendly :) easy access on and off the highway which is great for the work commute!
Regarding their Custom Framing.  I can't believe it took them 2 full weeks to finish framing my picture.  Either they have alot of work or they work slowly.
I hate the pharmacy it's always slow at this one.
Competition for nv energy is coming in 2015 for information contact me  I can't wait to switch #deregulation of energy
Way too expensive for the type of food they serve. Even the domestic micros are at least a dollar more expensive per pint than just about anywhere else in Pittsburgh. Do yourself a favor and take your dollars elsewhere where they will go much farther.
silver clouds...amazing. \n\nsmall, intimate museum....but amazing.\n\nshows held in lobby....amazing.\n\na sure stop if youre in pittsburgh.
GREAT museum.  Loved it.  I usually spend a short time in museums, but the Warhol museum had my attention for houes.  Beautifully done, and I love that visitors can touch and interact with many of the exhibits.
Terrible service.  Rude staff.  Horrible waitress.  Don't waste your time or money.  Plenty of better restaurants to select. Will never go back
Really really great service.  Diverse menu.  Apps are excellent especially the calamari  which features some interesting use of lime.  Nice atmosphere.
Nice selection of items, good pricing and friendly atmosphere. We'll be back.
I find the decor very odd and the menu limited. The infamous burger I was supposed to order (I forget the variety) disappointed me as it was very dry and overcooked. The oft-mentioned fries were also underwhelming.
This is a fun staple in Pittsburgh where the locals and university students alike come to dine. $10 bottles of wine is an attraction as is the fried fish sandwiches. They have delicious fish sandwiches!
Good food and big portions! I usually get their burger, which is very filling. It has a nice, casual atmosphere.
Pork chops, curry soup, are tasty \n\nLo Mai Gai is good but has no lap cheung\n\nDofu pi juan is vegetarian
Price is reasonable, service is good, food average. I eat at alot of Thai restaurants but this Pud Thai is drenched in a soup like very sweet sauce that doesn't resemble the flavor or texture of authentic Pud Thai. Otherwise everything else is average.
I like this place, they have good food. I go there a lot since its so close to my job. Their service could be better, but overall is a good experience.
Not great but good.
my favorite place in madison to see a band. Good sound, not too big, and friendly staff...
Good but not the real deal.  The big 3 pizza deep dish places in Chicago I feel are better.
it's the best pizza I've ever eaten. Yes, it's a bit pricey, long waits, blah blah blah. Don't care. I love you.
Place makes legit deep dish pizza. No one does it better in champaign. Only place to go for piazza like this down south. Lunch special legs you get their piazza slice for like three bucks. Great deal for a hungry college kid
Great martinis and cocktails in general.\nThe bartenders are also sup[er sweet, so be nice to them.
I liked the pizza\nbut not enough for the wait times.\n\nI mean, really.\n\nI'd rather just go to Peter Piper, order a pizza and play some skeeball instead.
Best pizza I've had anywhere.  Perfect, perfect and I mean perfect crust.  Thin, chewy, smoky and sweet.  Lots of interesting toppings that center around fresh, local produce.  I deeply envy the regulars here.
So looks like someone at that craphole called Bianco's can't handle criticism and is send private messages. Further proof place is bogus
Pizzeria Butana\n\nWhere they treat their customers like dogs!
Il Forno ... much MUCH better!
great guy...  and great pizza..  good experience all around.
Overrated.  While the food here is good; it's not worth the long wait.
This is a good pizza place, but not up to all the hype. If you want a great pie, then take a trip to LA and visit Monzza.  Monzza makes the best pizza in all the land.
Service: 5/5 Friendly and accommodating\n\nFood: 5/5 outstanding, outstanding, outstanding pizza
I guess I don't understand the hype. The service was very good, but the pizza was completely flavorless. The sauce was the strongest point, but the cheese and sausage were completely bland. The service earned them a third star, but I won't be going back
I feel that this place is very overrated.  The wait is ridiculous if you try going for dinner and I think the food is so-so.  I would prefer to go to Cibo over Pizzeria Bianco.
Best pizza in America?  It was good but definitely not the best.  Worth trying if there is no wait.
A Wonderful Experience!  Truly great food served by Outstanding Wait-staff.  Really worth saving up for.
great service and food.  awsome place to bring out-of-town friends.  martinis and bar staff are professional and knowledgeable!  best martinis in town.
Food is 4/5 no complaints, great menu.\n\nService can be a little slow, little rowdy environment at times (crowded, etc, dark, small bathroom). \n\nDeserts are best I've seen or had at a steak house.
Great food, great service, great atmostphere. What more can you ask? Equally good for a romantic dinner or a business meal.
Great food. Who cares what it looks like outside. Fish tacos were amazing. Check this place out if you want authentic Mexican.
Basically my favorite \"creative\" Mexican food spot. Hands down, best guacamole in town. Get it with everything in it - including the pomegranate seeds. The low rider margarita is awesome. Also, their signature pork dish is pretty tasty.
Not even worth it.. $130 for a family of 4. This is the PF Chiang's or worse of Mexican Food.. $5 horchata and $10 Churros? Comedor dela Guadalajara is still the bomb...
Awesome!!  Great food! Great vibe! Great service!\nI highly recommend happy hour for $1.50 mini tacos.  They were all great, especially the shrimp and halibut.
The best guacamole! Everything fresh. We were a party of 4 and all my French guest enjoyed their meal. Perfect service and reasonable pricing for the quality of food served. Thank you !
Great Guacamole; pricey but very fresh with a different texture and unique mix of ingredients.  Fish tacos fresh and not heavily battered. Pork tacos were also very good. Side salad also very good.  Friendly service.
from the music to the coffee to the furniture this place gets it, or at least gets it for me. i havent had a bad coffee there yet. the brownies are super rediculous good. the music is loud and not on the radio.
This place is one of the best Coffeebars in Phoenix. But if you can't get your flip'n internet to work any better, I'll continue to look.
My wife goes here ever chance she get, but I refuse to go with her. Coffee deserves 5 stars but the chick behind the counter is so rude. I refuse to spend money at a place that lets it indie hipster staff treat regular Joe's like my self rudely.
Everything here is tasty.  They can be crowded, so expect that!  Wish they were open later when my friends want to go boozing and I want an espresso!
Aaaaahhhhhhhh! I walked into this place happy, and instantly turned into hipster emo girl. what is going on? The music is really sad and there are a lot of flies around. Get me outta here. The coffee and treats are always good though.
this has got to be the best, most amazing little  coffee place i've ever experienced  besides cafe trieste in san francisco!! wish we had this in boston...
Lux feels trendier than I'd prefer BUT their Mac-n-Cheese is to die for.  Go get some!  You won't regret it.
Don't shop here.  sych!
To sum it up: I sat down where President Bush sat. The food was as awful as his tenure as president. Loved the ambiance though.
Excellent Mexican food, clean and decent prices for the amount of food.  Will definitely be returning.
Yummy Mexican food, but the atmosphere feels like a chain. Still worth it for the chips and salsa. This one is really close to Scottsdale Fashion Square mall.
Great food always. Service slow tonight, but will always come back as we love this place!
Food was decent but the waitstaff absolutely sucks.  Super rude and condescending.  Not worth the time or money.  Stay away.
We went here based on a random recommendation. The chips and salsa were very good. The food is quite hot.
The customer service is horrible which is too bad because the food is great. But button-line is I just can't ever go back, customer service is key to enjoying a meal.
The salsa is excellent and hot. Last time was better. The chimichanga was over done. I'll go back to the taco next time
Great spicy NM food!
Amazing customer service.  I got the teriyaki chicken w/rice lunch special.  They had it ready for me to pickup in 15 minutes.  It was great and high quality.  I'll definitely be returning.
So..this place is cute!  Huge dance floor!  The whole place is huge! Geesh~  Fun decor and nice bartenders.  The guys there seem pretty lame though.  Cool place to get dressed up and dance.
Don't bother with this location. They don't carry hardly any inventory. Online it will say this location has something in stock-it doesn't!
We spent New Years Eve here! Great atmosphere, excellent food and friendly staff!
The macadamia but encrusted goat cheese is to die for!! Salads as well \n\nLeap of faith drink is amazing!! As was our server Brandon!
Just called for reservations was told to call back they were busy. Wow really that's how you treat customers? Thank goodness there are soo many other great options -restaurants who understand what good customer service is
We had NYE dinner with friends and the food was great! The atmosphere reminded us of Hawaii. The coconut shrimp was the best I've ever had and the filet was perfection. Just be sure to save room for dessert!
It was good, but a bit expensive when there's so many places around town offering the same thing.
It's not fancy Asian food. But it taste great. I compare other Thai / Asian food to this place. Never had a bad experience or incorrect order.
Cheap. Totally get what you pay for. Buffet was your standard cheap buffet. And it's definitely in the ghetto.
The crispy rice salad with chinese sausage, mint and lime is by far the best thing I have ever tasted.  I always order 2 portions.  If you HAVE to go to Vegas, (God forbid) you should check it out.
I came here with a large party and the service was on point!  They were very attentive, the food took a while but the restaurant was busy.   The food was very savorful and authentic.  Try it out!
Excellent fresh Thai food.  Do not let the looks of the outside of this place fool you.
This white boy likes the duck soup.
Take the time to enjoy this little treasure. The food was amazing. We began conversing with both tables next to us and sharing each other's dishes. The experience was one of my favorite times while in Vegas.
I double checked to make sure we went to the right restaurant. I would rate the food as edible but not good. Very disappointing after reading all of the reviews. Wasted money on the cab ride in addition to the bill.
Yummy!!! They offer many authentic Thai dishes not offered elsewhere. They offer a big selection of alcohol as well. The portion is a bit small for the price but the taste makes up for it! Do make a reservation! I really liked the Hor Mok with Seabass.
Have had better hibachi for less of a price. It's ok... Prob wouldn't go again maybe only if I wanted a quick snack of a couple sushi rolls.
This used to be a much cooler club. However, for some reason they changed the name and the decor... not bad now but I miss the old one.
Vodka flights.  Caviar flights.  Both awesome.  Try the German caviar!  If you want to go extra fancy, they have an ice room!  Did I mention the Vodka from all over?
I really liked this bar. It had a cool atmosphere and good drinks.\n\nI don't exactly remember what I had but I remember it being some kind of pineapple mojito with absinthe in it. It was sooooo yummy!
It was awesome, service is what you expected from this type of restaurant.\n\nThe atmosphere was very differant and fun.\n\nI hope they are around for a long time to come.
We were very excited to go to Jasmine after reading the reviews.  Big disappointment.  Overly salty, nearing inedible. Rude waiter.  Short and impatient with my wife, our order, overall experience. Will not be back.  Better service and treatment at restaurants half the price.
Mediocre in every way.  Service and food.  Overreliance on salt in the remoulade was a disappointment from this name.  The whole place looked tired and past prime.
Terrificly delicious food.  Good service.  Very enjoyable atmosphere for a dinner with friends.  A terrific meal.  I read some negative reviews before going, but I found everything to be very good and am glad we chose to go there.
I had the Hubert Keller burger and it was gooooooooood. And the hazelnut milkshake. Yuuuuuuuuuum. That is all.
The beers are good.  Avoid the Veggie Burger, it is mushy and bland.
Food was great but the service was awful. We never even got refills on our drinks when we asked numerous times. Burger was the best part of the experience.
Not bad, not great. Hamburgers are good, same level of quality at a lot of bars across America.
Horrible burger. Pale color, no flavor, pretty bun but very greasy. Fries were delicious, fresh and hot. Service was ok. For a place called burger anything you'd expect good burgers. This isn't it.
Excellent food!! I had the salmon and it was perfect.  I can tell why Bobby Flay is famous. I will be back for more on my next trip to Vegas.
Hands down favorite restaurant on the strip.  Been here multiple times and it keeps exceeding my taste buds and expectations each and every time.  Try the filet, a bit of a kick!
Maybe my expectations were too high - but food was very disappointing.  It was ok - nothing spectacular or noteworthy.  Therefore it was definitely overpriced.  Wait staff was great though.
The food was pretty descent for the most part. My biggest issue was that they used really bony scrappy cuts of meat for the lamb tenderloin and thought it was ok.
The Coffee Rubbed Filet Mignon, served with a mushroom-ancho chile sauce, was heaven. Need I say more?
The service was exceptional...like nothing I've ever experienced.  Unfortunately, I can't say the same for the food which was borderline inedible.  I honestly don't think that I would ever go back (even if I were offered a free meal).
Make sure you're ready to eat if you come here. The proportions are ginormous and will definitely leave you with a food coma. The fries that come with the sandwiches are also great.
I stop by about ounce a month with my wife it's out the way for me but well worth it the bay of pigs rocks a must go.
Beers are good as were the wings, but the burgers were a BIG disappointment. Flavorless and uninteresting.  Portions were way too big--bordering on ridiculous.  Service was good.  Would go back for a beer and appetizer but that is it
Great little find on Atwood Street. The shrimp & corn fritters were super fish. The Pad Thai was very tasty and the Malaysian meat quartet covered all the bases.
The food here is very fresh and very thai.  I really enjoyed the red curry with chicken -you need to try!  Ive eaten Thai at other places in Pittsburgh (and there are really no good asian restaurants in pittsburgh anyway), and this is THE place for Thai.
I was visiting Carnegie Mellon the day after and I stopped to have dinner here. The restaurant had fabulous good and I really really enjoyed the staff. Thanks for some great food!!!!
Very good food but a little pricey so I dropped them back a star. The service was excellent.
Overpriced. Bread was hard. The scallops had a lot of grit and very buttery. Not worth the $30 price. A lot of gnats flying around. Very dis-appointing.
Not sure what the fuss is.  Lame sandwiches.  Much better options on the strip.
The space is kind of tight and the presentation could be better but the sandwiches are delicious and fulling. Definately worth the wait for a table.
Bleh.  This place isn't even good when you are drunk.
Visited friend John Mo in Pittsburgh for one night and he brought me here...great move. Big fatty sandwich but really really delicious.
Had the fried shallot salmon roll, awesome! Very fair prices and a nice atmosphere. Can't go wrong.
Fantastic good, great service, and the only place in the Charlotte area I know of to get some real ramen! I definitely suggest the sushi as well, not overpriced to hell like other places are.
Great sushi I haven't try the sushi bar but the sushi rolls are delicious. Some many kinds of sushi with a touch of originality.  No complaints at all in so many years that I been going there.
So I've ordered pizza a couple of times from Fuel. Both times have asked for extra cheese. Must say pretty lame, very thin layer. Not worth it, will look for pizza delivery from someone else.
It's the Plaza Midwood pizza joint. It also has a Ms Pacman/Galaga arcade which I find myself playing most times I visit.
I'm jumping on the bandwagon here: the squash curry is fabulous. \n\nBrave the Willy Street construction to get there.
I've been there only once, and that was enough. Yes, it is too crowded and infested with undergrads. If you are in for a randomly meeting unattractive people, this may be the place for you.
Well, its nice.  But it could be so much more.  The former Majestic movie theater, turned into a dance club.  Apparently doing quite well as the premier Hip Hop dance spot.  Enjoyed working there, don't enjoy drinking there.
Great gym. I loved Becky's Zumba classes and the Functional Fitness 6am classes. What really made it worth it was Cheri's helpfulness in regards to membership issues.
Good food, with the usual good variety of beer choices available in Madison.  Get there early if you're with a large group, the large tables go quickly.  As usual for Madison bars, I love the no smoking law :-)
One menu item...  Bob's (Organic) Bad Breath Burger...  You just HAVE to order this!!  Living up to its name, you will have bad breath for the rest of the night.  :)  But, it's definitely well worth it!!
Best place to eat, drink and hang with friends on the isthmus.  Period.
Cornbread Update:\n\nI think they must have tweaked their recipe, because I tried a piece of the vegan cornbread again and it was perfect. Thanks, Weary Bakers!
Fun neighborhood place with good basic bar grub.
Great food & atmosphere
Come for the coffee, stay (or come back) for the excellent fresh soup, sandwiches and smoothies!  Would be 5 stars if the service was more consistent.
Not to be missed on a nice day in summer.
A definite contender for our \"Winchester\" -our go-to neighborhood pub like The Winchester in the movie Shawn of the Dead.
A small and amazing zoo. It's free, has lots of animals that people (children) like, and  is an easy way to spend a couple hours. This easily beats Chicago's Lincoln Park Zoo. A must-see!
Good food, friendly staff.
This place is a Madison game day staple. The only problem is that this is the case for hundreds of people (and that may be modest). If you are into ass to elbow people, but an incredibly good time, this is the spot for you!
The Penang is out of the world. Jungle curry was really good. Pad Thai was just ok.
One of the best Thai places in town. They have great curry, as well as noodle-based dishes. In addition, they have decent alcoholic beverages. They also deliver!!
The Kona coffee is a personal favorite for my coffee for my hubby.  We love the banana crepes and Monte Cristo.  I also love the Chicken strip salad!
I like this place.  I don't get a chance to go very often but every time I go it's always good.  I always have the Seared Tuna.  Great place to sit outside and eat when it is cooler.
Sweet place!  That's all I have to say...!
This is simply a Holiday Inn in disguise- don't expect anything more (except the flat screen haha) and you will not be disappointed.
I really enjoy coming here! They have great lunch time specials, but try their vino bambino salad (ITS AMAZING). Their pizzas are really good too! For Dessert make sure to have their pizookie!
This place has gone down hill in the past couple of years. Corporate has changed the quality of their pasta in order to save money. The only thing that really tasted good was the cheese bread. I haven't been back since.
Staff was very friendly, and atmosphere was fun, but the Margherita pizza (thin crust) was the worst I have ever had. Mozzarella was so thin you couldn't even taste it. Tasted like cardboard.
The Skinny: Encountered rude staff. \n\nThe Fat: Pit stop, the mall seemed decent but because it's also Arizona, they get a one star anyway. I absolutely hate dealing with rude staff.
food was good and the portions were large good place overall but probably would have been better with kids. good place thanks
They seriously have THE coolest set up & ambiance- but it ends there.\n\nFood is overpriced.\n\nHardly any healthy options.\n\nServers were overloaded so it took forever to get anything.
nice hotel and best bang for the buck
Very old, dated and unbelievably smokey.  Our company had a conference there. The conference area was good but getting from the front door to the upstairs conference area was gross.
Not very clean and rooms smell funny. Not geared for thwarting younger crowd.
I maintain my disdain for the Palms.  I was here last week and the service was just awful!  I was overall unhappy with my stay.
Lots to do in the hotel/casino, but it's just so isolated from the Strip!
Very low quality room off the strip. If your looking to stay at a party hotel with people passed out in the hall  ways and benches out front this is your place. We stayed at the place and it was terrible and the room was half way cleaned checking in.
Wifi doesn't work in many of the public areas!  You'd expect them to get it right.
Stayed here many times but truly nothing special, wife has never been so took her for her b day. Nice rooms and grounds but there is better for less money. Pool and hot tub close at 4:00????? WTH? Staff is very friendly and attentive.
Restaurants don't provide many gluten free or veggie options. Elevator nazis are rude. Wifi in rooms is incredibly slow. This place is stuck in 1998
Terrible, we've stayed at other MGM resorts and they were all better (regardless of price) than this one.
This hotel was horrible. The staff was too nice the food was too good and the room was clean and spacious. If i had a fridge or microwave I would have said 5 star. If you like that sort of thing stay here as for me I'm not staying here again til the next time
The fun atmosphere and nice staff, plus a great room with an awesome view, can't make up for food poisoning from the America restaurant.  I didn't want to spend my vacation in the bathroom.  We will try a different hotel next time we go to Las Vegas.
This place is pretty fun and there is lots of food at a decent price.  There's lots of neat stores including Hershey's! The music is pretty good. This place is good for a gambler on a budget (foodwise).
stayed here on my first visit to vegas.  my friend worked for hilton at the time and got the rooms for free, so why not.  found it to be pretty decent.  the thing is, this place is off the strip, and that made it a major PITA.
Feels dated with a hint of Ghetto. Low ceilings in rooms, reminds me of a better Circus Circus, with less ghettoness.
Let us check in at 9am, friendly staff.  Decor a bit old, but very clean.  Looking forward to our stay
Cheap pricing, decent rooms.\nParadise Cafe has decent food.\nBeds are comfortable, recommend Player Card for Gambling\n\n\n\nA little far from strip.
Nice little casino, went here for raiding the rock vault
This place is a run-down, neglected DUMP. Staff was not friendly at all, and my room smells like raw sewage, but I don't want to wait another HOUR in the check-in line.
Lackluster hotel that should have been torn down years ago. Stained carpets, long check in lines, tattered decor...\n\nThere are too many other places to stay in Vegas to justify staying at the LVH.
Waaaaaaay too much smoke in the Casino, yuck!\nAnd very, very low ceilings - very claustrophobic :(
Meh place, but it was the cheapest and best located decent hotel to stay.\nIf you can afford it, try the newer hotels.
Good location, the room was fairly nice. Overall, A OK. Nice cafes inside as well, decent food.
I wouldn't go to this hotel. I went to Las Vegas many many times. Check out my pictures! I go to the best and worst hotels! This hotel is 2 thumbs down!
This place does offer good sushi and prefixed menu, but it is definitly way over rated. For the price they are asking, I would expect the fish to taste as good as the fishes in Tsukiji Fish Market, in Tokyo.
Obviously, the sushi is good, but the atmosphere is blah.  You can get great sushi at many other places that are less expensive and with better vibes.  Here, you're paying for the name.
Super expensive but holy cow that's some delicious fish.
Overrated! Really. I have to say it.
Best misoyaki butterfish I ever had!  The sake, which I cant remember the name was also great.  I don't know why I have less of an issue dropping some $$$ on high end Japanese food than high end Chinese food.  Hmmmm....
Great atmosphere and food, but a little pretentious, over priced (even for Vegas), and waiters have been trained to up-sell you.
This place is decent. Good price for the strip and it's a non-nightmare. All in all a good experience. Not stellar but definitely good at least. The casinos and bars inside were good. I am a big fan of the pub and the Zowie Bowie show.
Old hotel but always filled with guest and tourists. The Jaba was a great addition to this hotel!
Really liked this place.  It had a nice layout of the casino floor, it was not smokey, and it had a very open feel to it.  Well kept up.  Stop by and say hi.
We got the spa suite, no complaints. I love the medium sized refrigerator, no microwave though.
Rooms were very old they need to update it the casino and hotel itself was not bad.
soo good!!!!!!!!!! this is the 2nd cirque show i have seen and it did not disappoint! Not for the uptight or prude! :)
Great acting....especially the MC...typical Cirque quality.  Did this instead if Believe after reading the reviews.  Glad I did.  Definitely enjoyable as a couple.
This was fun. Got a little board at times.
how can you not love this show if your in Vegas and an open mind this show will not disapoint and you might get lucky with your date afterward
I liked this show alot. It was great. There is something for guys and girls. Even big girls got love which is a surprise. BBWs walking around giving out strawberries was cool. My wife and I had a good time watching this show.
This was different than the other Cirque de Soleil  shows in a sense that it's a combination of acrobatics meets stand up comedy,  all while being sexual at the same time.  I enjoyed it and was very much entertained.
It's not what I expected. If you want real luxury in Vegas stay at Bellagio or Palazzo
Best hotel in Vegas?  Yes.  Have I been to all the hotels in Vegas?  No.\n\nI've been to some and this is AS GOOD AS IT GETS.\n\nI want to live here.
This place is great to walk around. Anyone into art needs to check this place out.
After they cancelled my reservation for no reason, embarrassing me in front of my group, I will never stay here again.  \nSad,cause it was my favorite hotel and recommended it highly to all who were coming to Vegas.
Didn't stay there but best casino ladies room on the strip.  We tried em all at some point :-)
I love it here! Stayed here for 3 nights in mid June.\n\nSuite was huge! Couldn't have asked for more. It was just perfect.\n\nWe will definitely stay here again.
This was my favorite Place on the strip. A nice chance. Plus a calming feeling in a city of constant noise and chaos. Even in the crowd, I felt I had my own experience here. Great place to shop, eat, visit, or play! Check it out.
Still nice after all these years - though the indoor/outdoor thing is still a little creepy.
checkin/checkout is really slow and crowded with the huddled masses, public areas are very smokey, restaurants are over priced, wish we had stayed at the venetian.
I'll keep it short, nice hotel for the price and great pool area. Close to all the good stuff.
box office service sucks!
Used to be a cheesy place but now it's classy and centrally located. It's rather affordable too!
BED BUGS...BEWARE. Infested and never reported.
You don't get much for your player card status at Mirage . Wi-Fi Internet access in the hotel room is terrible; which you are paying for with a resort fee.
Was having a great time until I realized they house six captive dolphins. Was shocked...they are literally in a swimming pool. Really sad. No thanks i'll stay elsewhere next time.
The bone in ribeye was freakin delicious!  I am glad had a good experience at my first Emeril restaurant.  Hopefully my next one will be Commanders Palace in 2 years.  woot woot.
I didn't get a chance to eat here but the mojitos were absolutely divine. they make their own rum in house and could easily be the elixir of the gods. worth the time, every time. highly recommend.
Great service! Excellent menu! Their chateaubriand steak was mouth-watering!
Very good, excellent sides, tasty food.
Good for the management to reach out and connect with me.  I hope they are sincere in making an effort to make this establishment a better experience for everyone.
Was a great hotel and love the fact that I got 40% off my KA tickets. But when it comes to the small things it sucks. Like no free wireless Internet, no fridge, and no microwave. But I still had a great time.
1 Star.
Stayed here for 2 weeks had a group of 20 staying here. I didn't like the place . Rooms where outdated . Casino was always busy and couldn't enjoy myself so spent the whole trip at other casinos
Love this place. It's great for all ages, and don't get me started on how comfortable the beds are. The service is fast and very responsive.
Stay away, this place is just a huge time share and they promise you the moon and after hours of what should be considered torture you feel emotionally drained. I wish I would have spit on the guy that stopped me in the street instead of give him the time of day
Ridiculously great bartenders. \nFrom Noon til 5, Monday through Friday, you can have any drink in the bar for $2.\nThey have Slim Jim's and Twinkies.\nFree shows all the damn time.
This place is super fun music is hella loud and the drinks are so heavy you can't ask anything better
booked the place. they put us on the last room before they remodeled entire hotel. find out the last day. wasn't pleasant experience
This was a very oridnary hotel, nothing especial. It did not match our expectation of a four star hotel in Vegas. We stayed there for one night, then for the same price we got another hotel that was much better.
Brings me lots luck here, specially the 777 slot machines...  :-)
Stayed here for 1 night and the room was really nice. The bed was super comfortable and the bathroom was a nice size. My only complaint was that there was no outlet by the nightstand to charge my phone.
I write this with a heavy heart. Everything was fine. But Bed Bugs attacked me :-(. And I am no Diva but this made me sad!!!!! Anyway to sanitize beds???? Otherwise A ok.
Since ditching the pirate theme, TI is hotel with identity crisis.  Not impressed with the room which had broken fixtures & loud A/C.  spa is a joke which have to pay $17 extra.  Only plus is good location.  Stay at Rio for $50 Less and much better room
This is a pretty crappy and old hotel. The room was dusty and had several missing items such as cups and laundry bags.  The bed sheet was dirty and had a huge bloodstain right in the middle of the bed. I had to ask housekeeping to come and replace the bed sheets.
The shower drain was clogged....The rooms aren't that great, but if you're a poor college student or poor postgrad...then it's not that bad.  Great location.
the most disgusting, repulsive, filthy, dishonest, poorly run hotel on the face of the earth. I would not stay here again if I were paid $10000.
Great rates and a great restaurant for breakfast. Been here twice \n(might have been more, kinda hazy) but from what I remember it was a good place to lay  my head.
I don't get it. Its about time they tore down this casino and put up a real one.
This is pretty poor French food.  I had the onion soup which was honestly the worst I've ever had in my life.  I also tried to get them to make me a crepe complet (egg, ham, cheese) and they pretty much failed.  Sad.
Great little resturaunt right outside the Paris Hotel with a nice view. We had breakfast and the service and food was great.
The steak here was very good and cooked perfectly. I love the fried potatoes that come with the meal. I think my favorite part was the bread and the foie gras! Would def come here again when i get the chance
The snails and bread were good otherwise don't eat dinner here.  Slimy undercooked farmed salmon and greasy cheesy pasta.  No one at our table liked the various other entrees. Great view of the strip though!
I am not familiar with the French restaurants, but I guess this place is ok. escargot could have been cooked better though.
The service and atmosphere was first rate and the food was very tasty.  We have enjoyed  Mon Ami Gabi in other cities but this location definately stands out.
Great spot to eat outside and watch the fountains. Great food, although since it's French it can be a bit heavy. Love the steaks and the onion soup.
Nice view of Bellagio and the watershow, romantic environment, friendly staff, and great food!\n\nI just wish it wasn't so darn expensive =/ A plate of small Caesar salad is already $9!
First of all, it's in front of the Bellagio where you can watch the water show while dining. (Well if u're seated outside) I love the food. The waiter recommended a drink and it was delicious. Will def go back here next time I'm in Vegas.
Food is good but a little pricey for the quality.  The best part of the restaurant is enjoying your meal on the patio watching the fountains and people go by.
Nice street side seating. Enjoyed the brunch (Eggs Benedict) and bloody mary bar. Overall a good experience and would return.
Lobster Roll was great. Try their French Onion Soup. I need to go back and experience more of the food. The seating was pretty good. Service was great.
Still my favorite meal since I moved to Las Vegas 7 years ago - and I've had many wonderful meals here. The French Onion soup is out of this world and comes in a huge crock. The filet mignon was melt in your mouth delicious. Highly recommend.
Great atmosphere. Prime location across from the Bellagio water fountain show. Prices are as expected for being on the strip. I've had better though...that's the reason for three stars.
Not very impressed.  For the price and location, I was expecting A LOT more.
Steak frites have a pesto like butter sauce on them.\nVery accomodating staff for our 3 children.\nQuiche is divine, I'm still thinking of it.
So freaking good. Sangria amazing! Escargots delicious, onion soup amazing, scallops I could eat all day! Fresh bread at the table still warm!!! I love this place!
Was lazy in planning and didn't make reservations in time for anyplace better.  First time visit here for me, last Saturday night.  \n\nFood was just okay, especially considering the prices.  I guess you're paying for the view of the Bellagio fountain across the street.
Effeciency of ordering and care... Hiccough only with reservation when I arrived which was quickly amended... Great food and view
The best place in Vegas with the most beautiful view of the Bellagio. Food was great, service was excellent. The bread is too die for...all in all one of the best places on The Strip.
Get the streak frites.  That is all you need to know.
Service was slow. Had to send entree back to the kitchen because it was overcooked. Food was very bland.
Love the atmosphere.  Its best to get their late in the afternoon when the Bellagio fountains go off and stay to watch the sun go down as the lights of The Strip come on.
Had a beautiful dinner on the patio overlooking the fountain show for my birthday with loved ones.  Each and every part of our experience was fantastic.  This will be one of the best French meals you'll ever have.
Wherever you are, eat where locals eat... this is not one of them...service is terrible,  and food is a long way from being 100% French... just another tourist trap....
Love their french onion soup\nLove their sea food platter\nLove their oysters\nLove their wine selection\nLove sitting on the balcony on a warm evening night people watching\n\nCheers.
best steak I've ever had. best customer service. affordable lux food.
Vintage Vegas at it's best! The retaurant is cool, but the lounge is awesome!! Perfect late-night spot for couples.
Meh. A little on the greasy side. Went for breakfast and the portions were ginormous. The food was decent, on par with Denny's or Coco's, aside of the huge portions. I'm a fan of the large coffee mugs though.
Disgusting portions of cheap and unhealthy grub. And long lines.
This is the best place to go after the club. The food is pretty good. Not the the best but it works when your intoxicated. Lol
The peppermill is one of the oldest and most established late night eateries in town. The service is always great and expedient. The peppermill is a great place to grab a bite at any time of the day.
Food is alright, not bad for a dennys variant. But service....I get better service at McDonald's.
this review will be quick and to the point!!  open 24hrs. \n\ngo hungry -- leave extremely full!!
Walked throughout here to check out their gambling scene and they seriously need an update!! Everything looked very old and worn out. The atmosphere was very dead and dull. Was not excited to try and gamble here at all!
Really chill hotel. No complaints from me.
Oh man! What a disappoint. The lunch buffet really needs a visit from Chris Angel because it's in need of a magic show, make this food disappear!
Casino: \nA little on the older side but overall great slot machines and table games.  \n\nLove the upgraded modern rooms and the prices are reasonable for being on the strip and centralized to a lot of restaurants and shopping.\n\nThe staff is always nice.
Dilapidated, overpriced, loud, dowdy, cheap, spring break crowd, wait in line for EVERYTHING, $4 for a little bottle of Dasani, service is indignant...I mean, why go here?
Casino is decent, pool is fun, rooms due for revamp.. The suite I was in had water damage from hottub in room with furniture peeling apart.  When I called the front desk they said all the rooms were like that. ;o(
Crappy hotel with crappy scary elevators, everything are outdated and worn out, CRT tv and no wifi!?
Nice rooms but I'd only return I'd there was a coffee maker in the room. If the want you to get up and gamble they shouldn't make guests wait in the 40 + people long line at either Starbucks for overpriced drip !
I was a little disappointed. My room kind of sucked and the hotel service was a little off. We had fun gambling here and there is a really fun bar to get the night started but all in all I don't plan in stating here again.
Do not come here. A million hidden fees. I had to pay to RECIEVE a package that was sent to me. Ridiculous.
Older but comfy.  Great for the you get crowd.be sure to eat at the Taco & Tequila bar!
The hotel is good but the buffet is horrible. My husband and I got sick after we left after dinner. Overall, I liked the room and casino. AVOID BUFFET!
Just checked in and found out that there's no wifi in the room, no HDTV and you'd think they'd offer a discount or credit to us disabled veterans on Veteran's Day Weekend. .... never stay here again.
Be sure to take photos of your room before you leave, the added on a BS charge for two damaged room phones and a broken door lock.  $400 for two phones I didn't even touch. Ridiculous.  Never going back to any of the MGM Mirage Properties ever again.
Had a very difficult time getting into the hotel between the Valet being full, registration very crowded with only a couple staff working the desk, slow service in the restaurant and lots of early morning noise from the housekeeping group in the hallways.
Very nice place, great restaurant and bars!! I love how they infuse the air with a coconutty smell like suntan lotion!!! Better then cigarette smoke! The staff is nice and helpful!
I loved Mandayay Bay Resort & Casino. It was clean, beautiful, fun, our room was georgous!  So much to do there, good entertainment, good food. Had a great time and we will go back soon!
Pools!! Room!! Nice place! Lots of Fun!! The pools are allot of fun!!  FUN FUN FUN
Ventilation is horrible. I feel like I smoked 3 packs of cigarettes just walking across the casino. Need major upgrade.
I guess each hotel has to have something of its own to separate them from others. And what makes Mandalay Bay one of the ultimate places for having a great time outdoors is their big artificial looking beach. Kick back relax enjoy the water and the live DJ music.
Stayed here in 2009\nBesides a roach being in our room and the staff providing us with spray so that we could handle the problem ourselves; it was a nice stay. The staff overall was kind and helpful and the resort was very close to the strip.
Do you have any idea how frustrating it is to cut a $50 ribeye with a dull steak knife?  My only memory of this place is having to saw my steak.
Side dishes were good but the New York strip was the worst I ever had! Very disappointing this type of restaurant should be top notch- skip it.
Great meal, highly recommend this place. The chef's menu is the way to go. You will not go away hungry!
The best steak house on the strip.  The roasted steaks are great.  Fries should not be missed!  Quite expensive.  Awesome service.  Incredible wine list (study it before you dine).
I've eaten here twice now. The service has been outstanding. The steaks good, the braised short ribs are to die for.
Me and my Business partner had dinner there last night. Ordered the Chief special with Kobe Ribeye and My partner ordered the Filet. Both were good. Nothing to rave over thou. I would expect better quality for the price and would probably choose a different steak house next time.
Divine!  That really sums it up.  Have the hanger steak.  It is simple perfection and honestly enough for two.  Tender, with the juices perfectly sealed in.  I dream of my next visit to Vegas and another amazing meal here.
I must have ordered the wrong thing for breakfast.  I had a typical breakfast dish with eggs and bread and there was nothing to rave about.  There was a large selection to choose from, but nothing to say wow!
Excellent meal and high quality service.  Had an excellent chicken and fries meal and a fantastic salad.  Though this was way better than Joel Robuchon.  Also, much chiller with nice bar dining area if you are not interested in a table or doing Vegas solo.
Service is soooo slow!! Food is good but nothing spectacular. Go to grand lux for beignets instead.
Do not go here. King of like maggianos. I hate it. Huge factory. We had bad experience with almost everything we ordered. If u love french fries then this is your place.\nWe both got sick after.
I was a little out of my element at this high class restaurant but it was worth the trip.  We went for breakfast and tried the Chicken and Waffles.  The baked chicken and gravy was fantastic.  The service was top notch.
Fine place to go if you want a casual dinner but don't expect much more.  Well priced, many options, everything good but nothing amazing.  Loud atmosphere, service fine. If you're looking for a more celebrity chef type restaurant you can easily find better options.
Breakfast. Decent filled omelet, nice crisp bacon, coffee stronger than American but weaker than real French, disappointingly ordinary brioche toast, fawning service. Prices not too heinous considering the location, but it's really about as French as Olive Garden is Italian.
If you're staying at Venetian, it's hard to eat anywhere else for brunch. I mean... this place was literally on our way out of the room. They have a nice patio surrounded by fountains, and the omelets are different every day ;)
Place has gone down hill.  Total tourist trap for deep wallets and/or suckers.  The ones in NY and Boston are fantastic.  To be fair, service was excellent.  That's about it.  Food was bland at best.
Good Day\nA week before Christmas we arrived in Las Vegas.  Visiting our daughter who lives in the area.\nTruly memorable,  great food , excellent service and the fountain show was so sweet. Christmas songs, great food,  wonderful ambience. \nWill definitely be back .
Best food in Vegas. All natural, fresh, healthy, and tasty!
Not that great, very busy and it seemed every store I entered was out of what I was looking for.  Parking is horrible as well.  I don't plan on ever going back to this place.  I gave it two stars instead of one since the misters are nice in the summer.
Far too many people and long lines both for counters and and fitting rooms. Try find other Premium Outlets for example near Los Angeles.
lots of shopping came to buy things\n\ndodged asian tourist to get to stores\n\nspent money - would do again
this place had terrible service the morning that i went and it's not worth it for the price we paid.  it was just ok....i wouldn't go back
All I remember is a HUGE and delicious chicken nacho. There was so much cheese that the waitress actually brought us extra chips to scoop it up. And it was ridiculously cheap. I'll go back sometime and see if other dishes are as good.
777.... that's it, you don't wanna try anything else, best steak ever. Never disappoints you..my favorite late night dinning place
Its the Hard Rock Hotel cafe.  You eat here because its convenient.  They charge in accordance of that.
This place has gone to shits !! The food sucks and the service is horrible ! It used to be good but now it's the worse.. Don't go coz the food is not good n dry n disgusting.. Sorry to say
What a downer...ended the evening here...food...just regular ole bar food...nothing special...drinks just average...water tasted good and fairly priced...
The best sushi I had in Vegas definitely a five star experience for Vegas
Really should deal with their rotten trash dead animal smell. Haven't been there for a while and hope they improve it.
Just don't eat at the one in the airport. Cold food.
After reading so many positive reviews, I expected much more from this place.  While the dish presentations were attractive and the flatbread was pretty good, the rest of our experience was unimpressive.  There are many other restaurants I would visit before considering a return to Eno Vino.
Worth the money. You'll probably see celebrities here. You have to get there early to ensure entry.
hella stuffy.\nhella no space to dance.\nloooonnnggeessst wait ever in my life (even my party was on the guestlist).
This is a really beautiful club with beautiful people. Unfortunately it was packed to the gills for the Memorial Day weekend, so it made it a little uncomfortable at times. However, it was still a fun time.
got in free before 12am one wkend - the club is smaller than i expected like the dancefloor which is weird & crowded at times and hot lol theres other VIP rooms but the decor is nice
This was the best stop that Nite Tours provided!  Dug the music and the crowd.  There are separate rooms with different music.  The \"white room\" had a great vibe to it with folks getting down to the beats.
Door staff girl was the rudest person! Even the group in front of us was complaining about her as well. We considered leaving at this point , but decided to try out the place. Very pretentious vibe! Will definitely not be going back!!!
Went here with some friends and was not familiar with the menu.  The order counter seemed confusing to me too. Got a turkey sandwich,  but think they used miracle whip not mayo.  Not a fan though.
Great food selection and excellent service.  If you're VIP you don't have to wait.  High quality and Pierre Jout Champagne.
What a disappointment! Food overcooked! Certainly not worth the $85! Much better places.
Nice place to visit to remind you how good the real thing was.  Best to go on the weekends as thats when the schweinshaxe is served.
This place is dece.
I'm not quite sure how to rate this.  In Germany this food would be 2 star food at best.  Add on another star for the live music.  IF you've never been to the real one, this is 4 or 5 stars.
Good atmosphere, good food!
this place is a blast!   like being in Munich all year...we celebrate alot of occasions here and always fun..good food..
This place is rowdy and awesome!
Great German food in an exact replica of the original Hofbrauhaus in Munich, Germany.
Fun and a good time, but not much food for your money and it's expensive. I would go back there though. Maybe a once a year trip here, not a regular location. Staff were great, polite, and fast.
Food was boring and the quality of Hometown Buffet. The price was ridiculously expensive. I will never come to this restaurant again.
The service was ridiculous, took about 20 min before our server attended us after being seated in what felt to us like a high school cafeteria.  After the food was finally brought out it was cold and didn't taste like eatable.  I would never go back.
Better than a buffet but not great. Portions were appropriate (small) and too salty. Wish I would have skipped the wine.
08/01/2013\nWe were there for Happy Hour, the Carpaccio was awesome, the Pizza Fresh, great cocktails exceptional service Nice Job!
Server very disconnected from doing his job, serving! I ordered the Seafood mixed grill... Great flavor, yet tiny portion for $30! All other Flavors rocked...
This place serves the best burger I have ever had. It's a hip joint with a great menu and amazing quality food. No weaknesses.\n\nGo for the Delux Burger with sweet taters (and extra helpings of aioli).
The food is ok.  I like the ambiance....it's a little expensive
this place is amazing. Every item we have gotten here has been awesome, including the veggie panini
The service was a bit slow but the food made up for it. The sushi was delicious and the burger was unique and flavorful. We also got the mixed delux fries basket which was phenomenal. I would definitely come back.
This such a unique place and so is the food. Oh and by the way it is fantastic!!
AMAZING!!!!! No need to bore you with the details. Look at the youtube vid for the food network that will tell you all you need to know.
The jerk chicken fried rice was incredible and the red jade chicken was delicious and the perfect heat.  However, if you are trying to eat healthy, this isn't the place for you.
Modern styles intertwined into a combo of cuisine between two cultures. Do not miss out on the Bandido.
The food here is very unique yummy fusion between Mexican & Chinese. Have to try it to believe it! very laid back & I got to have a glass of wine with my dinner. Im def a fan
This place is an Arizona treasure.  I have been going there for 15 years now and it's always consistently good.  I recommend the 7Q & 9Q with black beans and jerk fried rice.  The included Snicker Doodle cookie makes it a complete meal.
I liked that you can sample various items before ordering.  Loved the dish I ordered, but now have to go back again to order the rest!
This was a huge let down!! It's in terrible need of a MAJOR cleaning which made me wonder how dirty the kitchen and prep areas were!! We will not be going here again
Tasted worst than a college dorm cafeteria. UC Davis has a better eating experience than this buffet. Limited selection and undercooked meat.
This was the most disgusting buffet I've ever experienced. I'm actually sick in my room from this place and I hardly are anything. Nothing was fresh. Everything probably came out of a microwave. \nTerrible brunch.
Super place to eat. Don't waste your money on Denny's or Ihop. Great food, staff and service. Open 24/7
Bellagio and the Wynn Hotel buffets are two of the best in Vegas.  The quality, and culinary touch is far better than the other Vegas buffets.  Bellagio's interior decor is surprisingly a bit cafeteria styled for one of the better hotels.
I wouldn't come back here again especially for the price. I've heard great reviews about this place. But the only thing great about this buffet is the crabs! The rest of the food was BLAH! - J
Over-rated in a town where you can get better buffet food at a much lower cost. Long lines are not worth the wait. Look elsewhere
Great buffet. I think I gained 5 lbs before the check came. I just changed my mind and took away a star cuz I remember the steak or whatever meat they were serving was not that good.
Worth every penny!  Tons of selection.
Food good but not as good as Wicked Spoon of Wynn's buffet.\nService was not good.\nRestrooms were terrible!!!
Disappointed. Nothing stood out. The deserts were okay. I honestly expected more !
not too bad, but to be frank, the buffet not meet my expectation. or the buffet in some hotel in china is much better? a little disappointed.
Quality of food has gone down.  We went for dinner and were disappointed.  We have been here before so we looked forward to returning.  We will be going to Wynn instead.
Quality of the food was poor.  Lots of choices but just didn't think the food was worth the price.\n\nThink a stand-alone place is a better choice.  You'll get better quallity food & eat less.
I really liked the use of space and decorations.\n\nI also like the coupon that they give. \n\nI did not like the mediocre food. However, it IS a buffet and I did not expect too much from it.
breakfast was very good, still overpriced, but good\nalot of variety
I would definitely check this off the list and not go back. Food was not enjoyable. There were 7 of us and it was our last stop from our 24 hour Vegas buffet pass. None of us finished our food and hardly went back for seconds.
I really liked it. Loved the cupcake variety. Food was fresh, kept hot, pleasant experience. There will be lines no matter what time you go. Staff is polite and attentive. Went here on a groupon- good wine and beer choices.
Typically buffet. Dried out food and over priced. Don't go without a discount of some kind. Go the Denny's for breakfast instead.
I love this show.  It was the most amazing show I have ever seen.\n\nThe only slight problem is that now I compare every show I see to this show and always end up thinking 'it wasn't as good as Mystere'.  Like nothing can come close.
I've seen two other Cirque du Soleil shows (Love and Ka), which I like better than Mystere.  The acrobatics are amazing, but I wasn't the biggest fan of the comedic moments or the baby.
This is the second Cirque show I have seen, and I love all of them! They all seem to challenge your imagination, and the performers are amazing!
Waste of money, I went with 4 friends and all of us were falling asleep.
Great acrobatics, but weird story.  It is worth seeing once, not sure I would go back unless I score a locals deal.
brunch only until 1PM on sunday and noon on Saturday?  is it just my spoiled Chicago self, or does that seem a little early to stop serving brunch?
Good Club, but 1 Major unexcuseable problem for me...\n\nI have to wait in a line to go into the MENS restrooms????
Tao SUCKS! .....NEXT!!
the bistro is pricey but good food.  you have to want to go to enjoy the environment.\n\nthe nightclub was subpar.  they played pop music and songs that are not fun to dance to unless you're drunk off your mind.
They make you line up a mile long and wait till 1130 to let people in. \nDoormen are assholes
Hello pretty girls bathing in bathtubs.\n\nHello dude that came out from nowhere who talked to me weird.\n\nHello insanely packed crowds.\n\nHello Expensive drinks.\n\nHello Las Vegas.
The music sucks! Dj was really bad. Bunch of guys and not enough females. Dance floor too crowded
Not bad. But if ur a dude. It doesn't matter what u spend. Bathroom line is ridiculous. Not worth the cover. If ur a dude. Don't come. .
Great resort.  Everything is laid out great with the exception of the 2 mile walk to the events center and conference halls.  Room service is great and there is a great selection of amazing restaurants.
Nice hotel, excellent pool and relaxing spa
Great rooms, We had a living room and a bedroom with one and a half baths and even a TV in the master bath, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay for my boyfriends birthday.  A bit far to walk down the strip but the Mandalay Bay and the adjoining hotels have plenty to do.
Best ravioli on the planet. Great fresh fish as well
We hosted a customer dinner event here last week.  We had a group of 30 and our dinner was excellent.  Service and food was outstanding.
HOLY SH*T the bacon cheese rolls! amazballs!! good food and i liked the upscale atmosphere.  Nice place for a really expensive date night
Mediocre, pretentious and overpriced, even by Las Vegas standards. Pedestrian presentation of decent steaks. Outrageous prices on the wine list. Go somewhere else.
The sheer power and aura around this place for ten minutes helped finalize my decision to go to UW-Madison. I wanted to be there. The setting is that good.\nEnough said.
Worst restaurant during our entire stay in Vegas. Service and food was horrible. Our waiter gave us bad service. You're better off going to McDonalds. Very expensive.
Awesome crepes\nI would recommend the peanut
There's nothing quite like dancing on the deck 52 stories above the strip with the summer wind blowing your hair around. It makes anyone feel like a hip hop video vixen. Yes boys, even you.
Wasn't impressed by this show and even slept through part of it. I saw another cirque du Soleil show at Suffolk Downs a few years back that was much more entertaining. I have to give the performers credit though, the acrobatics and diving were pretty cool.
Amazing visual feast.  Well worth the price.  Just see it.
Definitely worth watching. The girlfriend took me to see this and I was very pleased. The transitioning from land to water was amazing. Don't waste your time on NY cirque du soleil shows...stick with vegas... WOW
This is my third cirque show(mystere and zarkana), this was by far the best!! Seriously, air acrobats plus diving.... Absolutely amazing. Very expensive, but definitely worth the price.  Great vegas show!
I have to say this is the worst $150 we spent in our entire life. The show may be good in early 2000s, but can't make me excited in 2013. Any circus show on Asian TV programs may be better than this. Sorry I just don't get it.
Fascinating!! Jaw dropping!
Im going to be honest, i had NO FLIPPING idea what was going on!\n\nbut it looked cool as hell, i say its an assault on your senses. prob wouldn't pay to watch it again though.
I feel asleep.... it wasnt that good... some of t he stunts were cool.. but other than that... it was okay
You can never go wrong with watching KA.  The stage is a true masterpiece since it moves.  The best seats are in the back section or else your neck might hurt from looking up if your in the front section.  Spectacular show.  A must see!
Well, this is truly a yawner.  The show does have some great acrobats, but the story is hard to follow.  The moving stage gets old quickly.  Totally not worth the high ticket price.  I was disappointed.
Not amused. It's an okay show, but actually, I was quite bored. I've seen other Cirque shows and this has to be at the bottom of my list along with Zumanity.
I Hated it!  I felt the baton throwing and staged fighting was very boring.
Came here for the Catfish Sloppy Joe recommended by Oprah. It was good but not mind blowing as Oprah has exaggerated. The clam chowder was good enough for seconds.
Great  food, but watch out for the specials with outrageous prices. Staff is apparently schooled to push the specials and avoid mentioning the super high prices. Deceptive practices like this ruin the experience.
Napkins shed little white flakes all over your clothes, the lobster and and soups are great, but the crab was bitter.
It's worth a look just to see the view from the terrace and the over-the-top decor.  I'd like to come here wearing a Members Only jacket just to bask in the irony.
Great club/Lounge. Excellent service and bottle service is a must. The view in the patio is also wonderful. Special thanks to Dimitri and Kristina S for their excellenct customer service and friendliness.
Good night view !! Service was good ! Best place for romantics date ,birthday ! When u visit vegas from other state you should try here !
We got in for free from Social House upstairs, but left pretty quickly.  The club is rather small, and when we were there, it was pretty empty.  I certainly wouldn't pay to come in here.
Just. Called no longer open to locals unless you buy a cabana. They don't like locals it's just a lame slogan.
This place always sends out shady advertising deals. I am not sure what they mean by we love locals because we are locals and avoid this place like the plague.
Denny's quality food with Las Vegas quantity prices.  Pass.
great brunch...not too pricey
Don't bother. Any breakfast dish will disappoint, but the OJ is great.
Food is Okay. Breakfast wasn't very good (which is very disappointing when you are hung over) but their salads and sandwiches were decent. Can't really complain too much since it is open 24 hours but its not super special.
I'm a fan of Cheesecake Factory but I don't think this place is that good... If you are a fan of Cheesecake Factory, go there instead.
Everything about this restaurant is excellent! Price,quality, service!We always take our guest here! Never ate at the one in The Palazzo.Weve never had a bad dish!
I like this place for the food and reasonable prices.  It is nice to take a couple steps away from the casino and have a good meal.  The staff is always helpful and breakfast is really good.  I recommend the Protein Breakfast.
The Cheesecake Factory owns this cafe.  The food is always good and the prices are what you would expect.  They are open 24/7.  The wait staff is nice.
I love grand lux. I never had a item on the menu I didn't like. Came here late late night and they were out of bread. The waitress brought us a order of fries to substitute. Try the cream of chicken soup. You'll thank me for it
Been coming here for the past few years always a must! Everything is always delicious, the staff is great. We always come for the buffalo rolls/balls and the Cesar salad is our favorite. Great quality food and quick service.
Great food! Our service was excellent from Pierre. It's quite reasonable for Vegas, but still high for the real world.
Went here for lunch and it was baaad. The cornbread was edible and that was about it.
What can I say it's The House of Blues, if you've seen one you've seen them all. mostly standing room unless you pay for bottle service or the balcony is open. Good sound I have no complaints.
Have eaten at the Jade Palace several times this past winter. Always excellent service and food. It gets busy on the weekends so plan ahead.
The food here is amazing. I have tried more then half of it and it's all great. The staff is fun and the customers new and old mike you feel at home. This is a great place to relax and have a blast.
It is sad to see taiwan Express go. I enjoyed their food enormusly
This place was not good.  Definitely not the place to be scene.  Not a good looking crowd.
Memories memories memories\n\nI have so much fond memories here.  The club is swanky and is really good with treating the girls =).  My favorite thing... playing on the pole.  Mental pictures, no cameras please =)
came for a fraternity reunion a few years ago and for a friend's bday... not impressed. this club is probably on its way to being played out...like tao, pure, etx...
Disliked the rooms. Not impressed
it's already been said in every other review, but the Mattress Factory is pretty amazing.  They have installations that are extremely unique and orginal.  You won't find art like this anywhere else in the city.
Very nice atmosphere for a date or with friends.  If you are into wine, this is a great spot.
Very Nice Atmosphere, As Far As The Food The Only I Had So Far Was The Shrimp Bisque It Was Good Not Great But Good. But I Will Go Back To Try A Few Other Things
Love this place!  I've only been here twice, both for lunch and both times were excellent.  Great place to get a sandwich - hot or cold. Fresh products make this a nice lunch spot. I'll definitely be back.
The building is cool, the food value is pretty good, but food flavor has diminished a lot.  The salsas were sweet (why sweet?), and the meats were bland.  Bummer.  Better Mexican food is pretty commonly available.
If you choose just one Mexican restaurant in Mesa, choose this one.  It ranks as one of the best in flavor, authentic food, and decor.
I've been there twice, mostly due to the ambiance. After my last experience having to order from the \"to go\" area due to a fire in the main kitchen, I have decided to never go back. Taco Bell would have been better.
Great sushi and service.  The 5th star just being held back because of the high prices.  Incredible ambiance and easy to make reservations online.
Good cold beer. Good chips & salsa. The steak pyramid was excellent! Our waiter was a bit on the slow side but we did have a large table seated so he gets a bit of a slide. Definitely recommended!
Delicious enchiladas divorciadas, and pineapple mojitos!!
Just ate there last night with my girlfriend, and it was AWESOME!!!  The braised short rib flakes off as you push down with your fork, the cocktails are great, and even their take on a fish taco has its own novel nuances.
Phenomenal service. Fresh salad and tasty soups made from scratch! I will definitely be back. They make it so easy to eat healthy.
You can never go wrong with Maggiano's. Rigitoni D is the best! I was surprised however this one wasn't crowded on a Sunday evening. The food was wonderful. The waiter did make us feel a bit rushed when ordering but accommodated our children very well.
Great food , great service, nice atmosphere.
Famous Dave's is a typical corporate barbecue place - heavy on the barbecue sauce to cover up the otherwise tasteless selection of meats. On the plus side, the bar is nice and well stocked, but I wouldn't suggest going for the food.
just get the coconut margarita! \n\ntaco bell is better in respect to the food and service quality
Not worth a penny of your money.  The food is just awful.  It's equivalent to Chevy's.  So you think Chevy's is great food, you'll love this place.  If you are looking for decent Mexican food, however, steer clear.
Quite possibly the worst Tex-Mex meal ever served.  I had dinner with my client and staff at this hotel in February 2010.  What a disaster.  It was so bad that everyone at the table commented on how bad the food was.  Save for the chips and salsa, complete disaster.
I and my 4 friends were not impressed with this place.  The pizza isn't what we feel is great pizza.  Go to La Grande Orange, Pizzaria Bianco, or Cafepino.
I love their Burrata cheese, it is to die for, and of course their pizza's are amazing! Nice patio seating is a plus, and it's not too hard to find good parking in the area.
Yummy for me tummy!
This place used to be better but unfortunately- it's going down hill. The food is bland. The chicken in their salads especially. I used to like it, but now I have no reason to go back.
Enjoyed my veggie burger with fries. Service sucked the last 2 times. We had to flag down a waitress to get our refills. Next time we'll do take out to avoid tipping poor service
I've visited Fez and few times and plan to put it on regular rotation now that I've moved back to Phx.  Tasty and inventive food, good service, really nice atmosphere.
Great lunch specials and service was great. Will be back.
Great Sunday brunch. Excellent breakfast, excellent dinner. Trendy, yet quality food. I like this place.
After the manager read my review he contact me and apologized. I have yet to return to the place, but the manager assured me my experience will be different. Since then the server that served me was terminated. Looking forward to going again.
Happy is great... good food, drink specials and the staff are nice!
Awesome! Great food, amazing sangria and the staff is very kind. Would highly recommend this place.
One of our downtown Phoenix staples. I love the strawberry blueberry cashew salad and the margaritas. Annnd the spicy harissa fries. ...Aaaand the hummus. You really can't go wrong no matter what you order.
If you like smoke-filled shitholes without working electrical outlets and staff who wait on you at THEIR convenience, then the Plaza is the hotel for you!\n\nNEVER AGAIN!  I wouldn't return if they paid me.
Quick review:\n\nWe ate at the sushi place inside and it was delicious! My boyfriend loves it here just because they offer crapless craps... I can safely say that we will probably stop by on our next trip.
Service is excellent. Food was so-so. Music is also good. Drinks were tasty. Sit upstairs where the band is.
I'm going to give this place 5 stars only because I feel bad I kinda threw up on their floor... \n\nI'm really sorry, Jimmy. I was really trashed!!
Over priced! Over rated!
it's a party on the inside, very cool decor and volcano show\n\nbetter burgers than \"The Burger Joint\" in the same location\n\naverage food but worth the price
The food is below average for the strip. The only reason to goto this place is to drink a cold one and watch all the hot chicks parade up and down the strip. Having said that, I love this place.
place is always happening and the food is great.  it can get real crowded and the wait can be long to get a seat. so i f there is room in the bar then go ahead if not. wait. its worth it
Awesome time with the family. I mean the tequilla didn't hurt, but it was good food, good music and live entertainment.  Mt three boys loved the dancing betty in a swimsuit.  Kinda pricey though.
The nachos were HUGE they were pretty good. The margaritas are really good and have a nice kick.
Great steak fajitas!!! I was super hungry after a night of cocktails & craps..I like the liveband and the decor, we'll def be back next time.
Came here one night with my hubby. We drank margaritas. The night started out with people singing karaoke, but once people stopped going up the karaoke host rocked it. It was a lot of fun!
I HATE clubbing and HATE people who refer to themselves as clubbers. This place is about as much fun as church on Sunday and has just as many fake people as Church as well. Stay away unless you want to be surrounded by douche bags.
I visited this place today for the first time in 15 years.  I have to say:  they still have all of those amazing recipes and flavors.  Now that I'm back in town it will certainly be a restaurant that I visit frequently.  Seriously tasty food!
Sticky tables, loud, mediocre food for the price, decent saki selection bumped it to 2 stars.  Look for better.
Hair in our sushi. All servers with their long hair down? Not fresh. Not good. Won't be back.
Came here late night for cocktails and a bite. Loved the dumplings.  Beef skewers were good but kinda marbled. Watermelon flavored martini was bomb but could use a little more alcohol. Overall a great experience!
no other place like it.\n\n\nleave your girlfriends/wives at home.
Great variety of machines from many eras and lots of fun.
best pinball arcade in the usa!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
What a fun trip down memory lane! I loved seeing some of the old pinball machines (and a TRON video game! Holy crap!), and letting my kids experience such a large chunk of my childhood. Everyone should go here and visit at least once.
There was a chunk of chocolate the size of a thumb in my ice cream... and I don't think it was a mistake.\n\nWay to go, you magnificent ice creamiers!
This is the BEST sanctuary on the strip. They have incredible shakes and desserts and the patio is perfect for relaxing and watching the waterfall
best best best! been there a few times and it's always the best i've ever had :)
The food and pastries here were fantastic. The service was very friendly. Their pricing is extremely high and not locals friendly.
Croissant wasn't that good. I like bouchon bakery croissant better. The red velvet taste like chocolate, but the presentation decor of each cupcake is amazing. \nMy fave is the fruit tart.
I came for Sunday brunch.  Nothing stood out.  Food was for the most part over-cooked and not memorable.  Dessert section is ok.  Definitely not worth the price and there are so many better  buffets in Vegas.  Will not be coming back.
Although we typically do not like buffets we tried this, thinking that since it is at the Wynn, it would be good.  The only thing that was half way decent was the pastries.  Everything else was typical dry, cold, and crappy buffet food.
The best Buffet on the strip, pricey but you pay for what you get and the food is top shelf, chefs are top shelf, waite staff outstanding.  You expect the best from this place this was a very enjoyable experience.
To be honest, I was disappointed. Maybe because I have high expectation since the lines are so long and waiting time is miserable. \n\nThe environment is nice but the choices are too limited. Some food are really salty.\n\nWill not eat again next time.
i may know how magnets work but...\ntex tubb's queso?\n\nSHIT IS MAGICAL.
I like the reasonably priced, reliable and tasty black bean burrito (the \"Wilmar\") with its fresh avocado inside.  Too much noise and hubbub though to eat it there during the rush- better as take out.
Oh now they've done it; added live music on select weekends! I didn't think it could get any better but it did (-:
I had a very good experience at Fix. I had the Ribeye steak and fries which was excellent. The atmosphere was upbeat and the staff was attentive and friendly.
Didn't get a chance to eat just had a couple drinks l.. really cool laid back feel. I think the whole design and the lighting. Service was really good. Will come back soon to check out the food.
Great atmosphere! I love to sit at the bar and order nachos or enchiladas and hang out with my husband. The service and food are good.
went for dim sum last summer after graduation MEDICORE! it was not that good at all
Bad service. OK food. Overpriced prices (but hey, its Vegas). I like the decor but a 20 minute meal took an hour because the waitstaff was so inattentive.
Excellent food and service.  Only mistake chef made was there was a piece of plastic paper slipped into the coffe from the kitchen.  Manager apologized and gave us free dessert. However, it was pretty dangerous that we almost drank in that plastic paper..
What a shame the groupon was the only reason I give it a star to begin with.  The meal cost us nothing but the food was worth nothing to begin with. \n\nThere was no flavor to the sushi and the service was poor.
good food. Great service but i'm still hungry after$ 60..\nI would go back. But not when i'm really hungry.
Super fun!  Great people watching!  Very nice and attentive staff.  Drinks were good, looked like the food was too!    Like I mentioned AMAZING people watching here.  \n\nIt's definitely an adult pool, no kids at all.
Fabulous Sunday Brunch! The staff was friendly and attentive (although our server disappeared for long periods of time).  Great experience and I would definitely go back. Request to sit inside on particularly hot days.
Wow what a quiet hidden gem in the middle of a loud casino. Food, service, outdoor patio all A++ amazing place for lunch on the patio overlooking golf course and waterfall.
When I got to this place I was super stoked, the ambiance was amazing, service for sure is excellent. Food ? Outback is better not worth 100 buckaroos  per plate :) hey but I heard brunch is really good here I'll try it sometime:)
Overpriced sushi that's average. Drinks are decent but also pricey.
Stoles it! I got the coconut shrimp which was amazing. The shrimp is huge! And I had the lobster, shrimp and crab sandwich which was awesome. However, the fries that went with it were average.
Always have had good experiences at Prime.  They have high quality meats and good service.
standard typical hotel cafe fare. nothing to write home about really. caution: the juice is $5.50/glass. you've been warned.
Like an Ihop or Denny's inside Monte Carlo, but not as good. Not expensive, but we should of went to the food court that was around the corner, better price and probably more appetizing.
The Bartender was rude and if I wasn't with my family I would have thrown my drink in his face.\nActually I wanted to do a lot more, but i figured a true review would hurt them most.  DONT GO!
First time visit. Great view of strip at table. Wonderful atmosphere. Great food. Good prices. Great service.
Nice place for a lunch if you're in Fashion Show and don't want standard food-court food.
I would give this place 3.5 star rating if I could. Above average quality for buffet. Lots of choices, and even they had a lot of choices of asian food and dessert. Not worth the 1.5 hours waiting though, imo.
One star for the gelato. The rest of the food was not good and the RIo hotel is in bad shape. It was recommended by Worldmark, and I am unsure why. We went on 7/6 for breakfast and there was no line at all. No wonder...
They have a good selection. Servers are friendly. Food is great except the limited selection for desserts. The last time I went there, the servers at the dessert section were chit-chatting. They know people were waiting but acted like they didn't noticed.
Everytime I go here it seems the food gets worse and the price gets higher. I'm pretty certain this will have been my last trip to the Ihop chain.
Delish! I really liked this Chelsea's we ate on the patio and it was beautiful. The food was really good I had the fillet tacos and they were perfect! The key lime pie was the best I've ever had and the service was great!
Rude staff... Way over prized. Spent $60 on two drinks and two servings....
Use to come here all the time! What happened? Very rude staff. Sat inside dust all over every where lamps etc. food does not carry the same quality! Sad to experience this... NEVER COMING BACK!!!!!
Went herewith my friends and had the lunch buffet. Very limited choices. Only chicken and vegetarian. Naan was crispy...not much more to say.
Wait, you're shitting me, right?  35mins+ wait in the hot sun to eat bacon and eggs?  No way.
way overrated! bathroom in the kitchen, gross!  know what you're eating!  how much was the oj again?
Love their cheeseburger, can tell it's real meat no 90% fillers! Hotcakes, real maple syrup and best bacon ever! Do expect about 1 to 1hr1/2 wait but totally worth it!
Long wait (40 minutes) on a Friday morning. Guess it's due to limited seating capacity. But the Five Spot and home fries were delicious!
Finally got something I've never had at this place: Good service....obviously a Phoenix landmark that should be visited by all at least once, but new location loses some of the old charm.  Limited menu, but pretty good...expect a long line...
We have friends who rave about mu shu. We like it, but not enough to make it regular, and we live just a few blocks away. Price/value is measured in pounds. Friendly service, still it's cafeteria quality
Came in at lunchtime, first thing very noisy! Margarita was good if you want tacos go to filobertos . Enjoyed the carne asada lunch bit was lacking that certain something overall good service food was good but not fantastic
I love SB.  I eat there at least once a week and find that the menu has a good variety.  I like the daily menu with different seafood items.  Jessica is the best!!
Rosie's is mine and my sister's go to beer place. It is conveniently close and just very cozy. I always get the Magner's Cider which is so damn delicious, and Wenesday's live performer is always so delightful to listen to.
Great authentic Irish Pub not a chain just a real Irish Pub, Great food, music and people.  This is a sure thing to bring out of town guests, family and to celebrate your life. Great memories here for sure.
I had the pastrami reuben, it was super delicious. The Nachos are definitely a must have as well!  It has a great atmosphere and the service was perfect! Can't wait to go again!
Overpriced.\n\nI spent about $300 on bra, underwear, garter, and stockings.\n\nIf you have boobs bigger than a C, don't expect to find your size.
Worst ted baker shopping experience ever, there's a sales guy with weird hair, he is super rude!
Seems to want to be O. But it did have good effects, music and talented artists. However, the actual story is lacking coherency and things aren't as stemless as a Cirque show.
Sat in the front row, Got wet and watched a pretty cool show. Its all mostly in water which felt kinda repetitive but still kept me interested throughout. Worth the watch but definately not for the money. Seen better for less.
This performance was on par I think to  Michael Jackson's Cirque show and much more artsy. I like the small venue and the Greek Theatre layout as well.
I agree with generally everyone:\n\nHummus, good.\n\nDrink prices and ingredients, confusing.\n\nWaitresses, awful.\n\nPotential, there.\n\nMusic, awesome.
Great place to grab a few beers with the friends. Awesome energy. Love going there!
Excellent food! Excellent service and great ambience. Will definitely come back on my next trip to Arizona
We enjoyed this buffet. It was a little too pricey considering the Bellagio (which is awesome) is only a few dollars more. But there was quite a variety of items, and staff were pleasant. Not sure if I would return with all the other options on the strip.
Yes, please!\n\nLove In & Out. \n\n#2 Animal Style is like sex.
I love Lisa's Bowl of Balls.  It is a very yummy and satisfying dish.  I go to Lisa G's just for her meatballs when I'm craving meat.  I highly recommend this dish.
It's a lounge. They serve alcohol. They play music. Simple.\n\nNothing to compliment it on. And nothing to complain about. Average.\n\nGreat for older people, I guess.
Fresh shrimp, crab legs to enjoy. Prime Ribs & Leg of lamb on carving table. Many different other dishes. A lot of desserts, including crepes made to order. Weekday price is more worth it.
I had higher expectations for this buffet.  I will say that it was just OK.  The crepes for breakfast were pretty good, and they did OK for dinner.  But it's not the best in Vegas.  Some dishes were hit or miss.
Not a lot of selection. The food sucks.
Crepes station is top notch. Seafood was okay.  Kind of worn down in the last 5 years. A deep cleaning would be great for this whole seating area. Probibly backstage too.
We came to Vegas on a very small budget. We got the buffet of buffets deal and ate at le village, it was lovely. The decor was beautiful and the food was outstanding. We even decided to return for dinner. Very pleased with the entire experience.
Get ready to wait for an hour just to sit down and eat, the service is horrible the buffet looks is half empty but for some reason it takes forever to be seated
We got there late at 9 am.  Such A LONG line, but there were tons of tables so I don't understand.  Waited thirty minutes and left.  It was 11/11/13 .  I'll use open table next time.
W & K is my go-to place for Chinese.  Great chow at a cheap price.  The sushi is very good, and inexpensive.  I love this place!
Complete assholes. Nuff said
The food was good but the waiter over sold the dish.  It was good but the way the waiter talked about the food was over rated.
Love the stuffed chicken wings and the rice combo plate as well as the pho!
Great food. Great beer. Great service. Great atmosphere.
Good food, great service, fun atmosphere. Fabulous beer selection. Need I say more?
Great flavor in the Kansas City beef ribs, but unfortunately the inside was cold... Makes me wonder if they just reheat everything... Brisket was good and with the 3-4 different BBQ sauces you'll find a flavor that suits your tastes.
Pretty good BBQ,  pulled turkey was a little dry but the green been casserole and the mac and cheese redeemed it for 3 stars. The ambiance is cool so i would still definitely come back. Live music outside is a huge plus.
Best collard greens I've ever had with BBQ to match. $3 pints of ANY BEER on Mondays. Super friendly wait staff. I'm definitely coming back here next time I'm in the area.
Great food - especially the grilled meats.  Try the Chicken BBQ, Pork BBQ or Galbi.  Remember to grab some of the free soup, it's always yummy.  The owners are very nice people and the food is consistently good.
It was nice. The cashier was chipper. The food was just like the L&L in Oahu. Wish they would crank the A/C a little more though.\n\nRestroom was a little dirty.
Decent business hotel and well off the strip--quiet. Staff were helpful and the place was clean.
It's OK food - nothing extraordinary.  The pricing, I thought, was a bit off given the quality of food/service.\n\nThe menu is pretty concise and to-the-point.  Very American palette-friendly.
Im a fan of good chinese. i must say the wonton soup was loaded with big fat wontons 8 of them and the pan fried noode dish with chicken was awesome.. i went twice.. Worth every penny!
the food was alright but definitely cost more than it should.  we went for a quick lunch and the service was alright too but the food was not up to par with your typical vegas food.  btw don't get the kim chee, not good.
Really good Chinese food.  The duck and pork noodle soup is awesome.  Portions are not that generous so be advised but worth it for Chinese hotel strip food.
Chive dumplings were ok. Fried rice was bland and too greasy, beef stew was alright, and the chicken ginger noodle soup was very bland and chicken was too dry.
It's cracker barrel... it will be just like any other cracker barrel you've been too. Big country breakfasts, down home cooking, you know the drill. It's not fancy but its dependable.
Its ok. I just expected better. food was microwaved and flavorless.
Food was so-so. Service was so-so. Location was noisy, but then again it's the Paris Hotel in Vegas.\n\nWould I recommend it? If you can't get into another place, yes. Otherwise, it's nothing special, really.
We had the lunch menu and it was great .I am sure I will be back next time in Vegas .
Service was great.  This price for dim sum at this place is the cheapest.  My favorites were  the tripe and the chicken feet.  Would definitely come here again.
Great food, great service, nice ambience, and reasonable prices (for the Strip). So far, this is the best Chinese restaurant I've found on the strip in a resort.
I like this place!! I thought the food was fresh and service was great!!  I don't think the price was really that bad if you compare it to other hotels restaurants.  The place looked cool too
Turns out eating here, appropriately, is a crap game. Food always OK To good. Service, you need to bring your luck.
Slimy noodles and lots of dim sum. Crowded, noisy, mediocre service. Very forgettable. It was so bad we went to the chocolate place at Bellagio afterward to recover.
Not for anyone looking for authentic Chinese food. I would go for the location if staying in Bellagio. Otherwise, it's overpriced and the poor quality does not deserve it.
Deelicious, reasonably priced, and excellent service.  I would go back in a heartbeat, and gladly recommend this restaurant.
Excellent service. Noodles were perfect however the flavor was nonexistent. Very nice staff and decent prices considering the location.  I don't think I would come back again but I am glad that I tried it.
Convenient location. Pork barbecue: Tasty. St. Louis ribs. Sauce: Tangy.
Excellent quality food all around and a friendly eager to please staff make for one of the better breakfast experiences in Mesa. The decor here is a little old fashioned - kinda feels like having breakfast in Kansas :)
We have lived here for almost 5 years and we just found this place!  We are always on the hunt for a great bfast place.   I
Crab omelet? More like imitation crab meat which is really just a mix of various extra fish parts, processed and flavored like crab. When will restaurants be honest about what they serve? Its just sad.
The service of our waitress was very rude and not professional.  Sat for 20min never came back to take our order. Food didn't taste good. It was too salty.
Bad food. Bad service. Bad drinks. I guess we caught our server on an off night, but the next day we ate here again after leaving the pool and the food was even worse than the night before.
Way to expensive for what you get. Glad I bought a groupon for this place. The food is way to much for what you get. The atmosphere was alright but nothing to write home to mom about.
Had the King crab legs--hard to give it anything but 5 stars, but it was pricey.  It's a great restaurant, but in a town of great restaurants, it's 4 stars.
Outstanding Chinese in the wasteland of central Illinois. Get the salt and pepper chicken. This place appears to be hardcore, no whities while I dined. The menu has a special section only in Chinese. Strange sign on the wall says: Please clean your table for the next customer.
Delicious after dinner cocktails. White Chocolate martinis, caramel and coffee deliciousness. Kinda pricey, but yummy.
Food: excellent\nService: good\nDecor: tasteful\n\nMy only complaint was the music was so loud we had to yell in order to hear each other. It really ruined the experience.
Horrible!!!   Don't bother
I love sitting at the bar, it's a wonderful experience.  The food was delicious and the execution was right on.  I wasn't crazy about every dish, but I was able to appreciate the skill that was involved with everything.  It's a pricey restaurant, but worth a visit.
Slow service and 15-20 for mediocre philly cheese steaks.  Sandwiches and fries do not have a lot of flavor.  Also the televisions are blaring loud, if you have sensitive hearing beware.  Seating is limited.
Had their Kalbi Tang.  Good quality, not very greasy like I've had at other restaurants.  Good Banchan.\n\nLooked to be a bit pricey on their BBQ menu, but good quality and close to TI.
From being greeted at the door by the owner to the kind and gentle attention one seated the experience and ambiance matched the excellent quality ingredients of the food.  Great value for the money.  Recommend come early evening or very late night.  The place is packed with locals and tourist.
Great little coffeeshop and Italian bakery. Good place to sit and peoplewatch. Pizza place in the back looks delicious and inexpensive.
I had a strawberry cream puff and it was stale. It tasted like it had been sitting in the case for about 12 hours, which I'm guessing it had. I was very disappointed.
The best part of our meal was the fruit fly I accidentally consumed while drinking my wine. Second best was the \"cheddar smashed potatoes\" from a box. Third was the steak. Pictures and further comments available upon request.
I love my wet and sloppy ribs!
Love this place! Great biscuits to start, drinks in mason jars, staff is friendly, and the food is good!
Deelish BBQ. If you are craving tasty cooked meat, and sides of comfort, go here. Lucille's has a lively atmosphere and an extensive menu. Their location is convenient.
The pork was dry to me but my husband loved it when i brought it home as a left over...
This outlet SUCKS.  The only store worth visiting is the Nike Outlet.  That's it.  Don't waste your time here.
Let's go SHOPPING! ^_^  Compared to the Charleston outlets these are more up my alley (read: typical Joe Shmoe) with some haute shops sprinkled in.  Plus it has the Lane Bryant outlet for my fellow big girls!
I have to admit, I thought it was going to be better. At its price it's good,but paying a few dollars more gets you better Indian in PGH. Sweet woman owns and operates the store. But please try it and give her some support
Over Rated FOOD!!! This place needs a good chef.. I don't plan on dining here again.  Pasta is so cheap but why charge ridiculous amount of money?
Wife and I were there about a month a go for our anniversary and let me tell you the food was great amazing service our waitress that day was Courtney and she was incredible nice really enjoy our time thanks for the great service we were there on 04 24 2014 thanks again for the great food and service
A new experience, in the end it was nasty, sauces were bland, and had massive diarrhea after wards. \n\nRATING: GARBAGE!
high quality food (no msg) , healthy, quick, tons of food, inexpensive and always left with leftovers
I've got at least thirty people hooked on ycs! They need to come to phoenix the foods worth my hour drive but, I hate the expensive gas
A little pricy but you build your own meal.  It tastes as good as you make it.
This place is disgusting. It tastes like they soak everything in margarine. Avoid at all costs.
While I definitely agree with the reviews that say the matzo ball sucks, I still enjoy the large portions and generally good sandwiches here.  I usually go here after work (11pm or so) when there's no line or anything so its fine.
wow has this place went down hill. the service and wait staff is an absolute joke. the food has went down hill. just horrible... horrible
So be warned, this place only has pizza to eat, nothing else. But the pizza is great! New York style, thin crust which is my preference. And if you don't want it too greasy avoid adding meats to it. Just stick with cheese.
Its pretty good Pho in a nice quiet location, Charming.
So while I was at this club, one of the security guards who must have been in a bad mood on this night said \"stop dancing before I step on your face\"... Customer service in VIP at its best.
Worse club ever. They advetisted  free drinks for ladies but was not true then once got inside there was nobody in there. Dance floor was empty.  Go somewhere else
By far the slowest Jiffy Lube I have ever stopped at. Thought I would be in and out in a few minutes because no one was in front if me but it took over an hour.
This place is prettty large and awesome. A wide variety of organized items. Video games, current magazines, books, and board games are a plenty. Staff is friendly.
Do not purchase video games here! Used games are ridiculously overpriced selling for more than double the price of new.
Plan ahead keep an eye on there web site family fun projects always happening helpful staff they can always direct you right were you need to be good half day with the kids on weekend project days
We went there for happy hour. The service was super slow and it was not even busy. The food was ok.
ABSOLUTE FAVORITE STEAK HOUSE OF ALL TIME!\nAmazing steaks! Extremly intresting and delicious appetizers and desserts!\nVERY EXPENSIVE!
Excellent food. Warmly lit low light ambiance and good background music. Unfriendly hostess, but waitstaff was on point. Felt decadent to be there and we'll try it again.
Oysters good. Chicken was smelly. Adult tater tots good. Took our servicer for.ever. to split our checks. Mediocre across the board.
Super quick for takeout, with a variety of Asian fusion options. The food is so-so, but satisfies if you need a quick fix in a hurry!
This place is cool and jukebox is great but the bartenders are all facing premature mid-life crisis. The only friendly bartender is the girl whom I wish would be there more often.
this place isnt bad but its not really good either. (food wise)\n\nThey have dim sum all day, and the prices are cheap so that is good.\n\nBut i won't come here again. Straight up.
Went for dim sum.  It was moderately busy, but the carts came around often.  The food was decent and the staff friendly.
Dim sum is just not good in Vegas. I would not come here again, but then again I probably won't ever get dim sum when I'm in vegas. \n\nThis place is dirty and not authentic.
Friendly. I luv their coconut bun
Meh. Okay food. Three stars because I was hugely disgusted by my water. Check then picture I added.
Nice Prices, Good Food, Okay Service...It was a nice place to have brunch at with my girls. It was new to me. Dim Sum was awesome and all the other foods were good. I would go back again.
Went here with family. \nVery busy restaurant, the food was decent, nothing special.\nCustomer service was ok, some were rude.\nPineapple buns are bomb!\nThe parking sucked.
This is just an OK dim sum place who's saving grace is that they serve dim sum all day/night with a limited selection during off peak hours. Go to Ping Pang Pong instead unless you're craving shu mai at 10 pm.
Eh, it was ok. I think Circus Circus needs to remodel this place. Haven't been here in years and it looks the same.  My son had a blast so that's all the matters.
Had to meet a client here for a quick cocktail before dinner. Being in the Four Seasons, it's a very quiet location; perfect for uninterrupted discussions. The service was excellent; our waiter was constantly available without being a nuisance.
Above average breakfast/brunch buffet, but then it would be for $36 per person.
Yogurt and Granola Yuck and Coffee sucks.  Along with their cappuccinos.  Otherwise , it is great.  Bagel and Lox are great and so is the Omelet.
great concert venue!
I felt that this little aquarium was overpriced. If you've ever been to a good aquarium, you'll be disappointed. They do a nice job with what they have, but it's not all that much and it's not that impressive.
Very disappointed with my visit here was definitely not worth the time and money... I did however purchase the 3 for $57 so we chose this the Secret Garden at mirage and Bodies the exhibition at Luxor which in my opinion was the best of the 3!
Nice place for the family to discover the wonders of the sea. An hour is about the time you need to get around the place.
Really awesome place! They have a variety of fishes and animals. Also, there is a spot where you can pet sting rays which is pretty cool. I reccomend this for little kids and children, they'll love it!
Visited the aquarium sinve it was on the 10 must do things while in vegas. Nice aquarium but not everything advertised was available. An interesting place to visit but I'm not sure it's a must see if you are in vegas
My friend and I could NOT get to this coaster! Haha and we were sober! Staff was pointing us in all different directions. It looked so fun.
It's something you should do upon your first visit to Las Vegas and not to be done again. For $14, I expect to get a free picture at least!
One of my favorite omlettes of all time. Solid cup of coffee, good ambiance, and we sat in what would otherwise have been the window dressing area had it been a retail store. Great breakfast place, be sure to stop in!
Ehh. Nothing to write home about. Good service. Food just average. Unless you are a veggie loving hipster, this place is not worth the 2+ hr wait. Save yourself the trouble and disappointment and cross Butler St to Franktuary.
The only record store in Vegas left that I will shop at now that Big B's Cds & Records - CLOSED!
Originally the food was awesome but it has steadily gone down hill.  The breakfast gig they were doing was great but it's inconsistent on when they actually open.  Showed up at 930am and still were not open.
Food tasty and generous and also a bit on the pricey side.
OK\nYou must go there, if only for the CHICKEN FRIED STEAK.\nI can't imagine it being any better
Horrible experience. Bacon...cold and old.  Pancakes dense and hard.  Potatoes deep fried and extremely salty. Please go somewhere else. Their food is NOT good.
I love this place!!! Best vegetarian eggs Benedict, and I've always had good service.
Good breakfast spot! Our waitress was Stacie and she was awesome!! Definitely try the banana nut french toast and the egg-cellent omelet... sooooooooo worth it and it'll feed 2 people no problem!
Just finished breakfast Amanda are service was fantastic!   We sat outside enjoyed the nice weather and savored out banana nut muffin!!
We loved our breakfast.  Bacon avocado omelet and carnitas pork skillet.   Great service by all the staff.   We will be back next time we are in town.
Went for lunch and the service was great. We got the lunch specials and the food was delicious! Food came out fast. I will definitely go back.
Good and dependable family pizza spot! Come here often carry out and eat in with family of kids. Great service and food. Try the buffalo bites if you are skipping your diet!
Great food, great staff that will make anything you want.  All chicken dishes can be ordered as white meat only.
We used to frequent the restaurant. Recently, the food quality and flavors changed. Not sure if there is a new cook, management or something else. So sad about that!! Used to be such a great place to get delicious take out or dine in Chinese food.
Good show since tickets were free however had I paid a lot of money I would have been disappointed. Needs way more animal skits and on more than one occasion there was screw ups. Piers Morgan would have hit the X button.
Disappointing show after waiting over an hour to get in.  Ushers don't care if you came early for better seating as the sales agent suggested.  There is NO choice in seating.  You have to sit where they place you.  Save your money for a better show with assigned seating.
Solid.  In and out in 45 minutes with a full stomach and not too much damage to the wallet.  \n\nNice staff and good service.
Worst food, and worst service.  Will never go back to Red Robin.  Do not waste your time and money.  It is horrible.
Bojangles used to be some of the best chicken in Charlotte, well I see a lot have changed- JJ's Fish is much better
Lobster Pot-Pie was not great. The lobster was over cooked and chewy. It really had no flavor. I've had much better lobster at Red Lobster. It really was disappointing especially for $85.
Food was very good, waiter (Chris) provided excellent service.  They did sit us on temporary chairs (by the kitchen too) though.\n\nNot much use even posting this because they are closing soon.
Sad to hear its closing. Was very nice.
Still a bit in the middle on this place.  Fairly pricey for good food.... UNLESS you catch the \"Happy Hour\" in which there are some deals to be had.
Awful. Nothing positive to say. Stay far, far away!
Slow service, weak margaritas and stale chips. Not coming back.
I'll leave one star just bc the waitress was nice. But seriously it has to be hard to make food taste that bland and unflavorful. It was horrible
Basic breakfast.. nothing really spectacular or bad.. just so so.. the walnut pastry was kind of dry and the service was rushed and disinterested.
My friends and I all ordered breakfast. The food was mediocre but edible. However, I was not satisfied. If I am going to pay $17 for eggs benedict, I expect it to be above average. In this case, it was just meh.
It wasn't what I expected going in but I had fun.  An hour is more than enough...especially for someone that NEVER works out!  WHEW!
I tried this place twice because it was very different.  It is different but that's it.  The place doesn't have much else going for it.
It was ok. It is like someone who is drunk and this is what the craved for munchies. They combined a Panda Express with a Taco Bell into one dish. Also the fried rice was terrible
Average food.  Great concept and enjoyed my first visit.  However, the only really good item is the Red Jade Chicken.
A great place to go if someone else is paying. Great sea food, excellent decor and if you reserve, a view of lake Monona.
The Wor Wonton Soup comes in a big container and has a flavorful broth, crisp veggies, lots of wontons and meat.  It is great with chili sauce in it.  I've heard the Peking Duck is great, but have yet to try it.
I spent 5 weeks out of the country and the first place I spent money upon my return is this home away from home. It's a great location, yummy products, priced right, and a fabulous staff!
The atmosphere was really nice. Love the outdoor patio with the metal art and concrete/bottle table. Nice change from the chain coffee shop. Customers very friendly and talkative. My drink tasted yummy but it wasn't frozen enough otherwise I'd give them 5 stars.
The cheeseburgers were nasty.  When our food was delivered the hamburgers were gray in color and they tasted soggy and flavorless.  Do not waste your money here.
Great burgers and sandwiches. Had the pastrami burger with sweet potato fries this time. Service was good and it didn't take long for our food to come out.
eh.... ok food.  Under staffed, slow, but friendly service.
Typical Vegas cafe.  Nothing out of the ordinary except for our server Bobbie Jean.  She was super courteous, attentive, and sweet.  All servers should follow her example.
Place was filled with employees but not many tables, the. Employees just standing around, not really attending the customers.
This location has moved and changed names. It is now called Sid's Cafe and is in the casino.
Have to try the brisket and the donuts.
This place is great! Meat falls off the bone and the mac n cheese and mashed potatoes are so yummy!
Great service, great drinks always at a good price music is cool.... but the main attraction.... THE TACOS!
Happy Hour is fun!  Great food and drink specials!
That place it's bad and overpriced \nDon't waste you money and time!
I love this restaurant. It has great ambience and the food is wonderful. I particularly love the guacummus (guacamole hummus) sliders. It's a great place to meet friends and colleagues.
Bluecorn enchiladas were fantastic.\nYou pay for chips and salsa that are supposed to be made when ordered but mine weren't. Pricey but good.
I love this place! The pork green chili Mac n cheese is so good I dream about it! Mojitos are awesome made by the guy bartender who is super friendly and sweet! We always sit at the bar! Just a really cool place to have some really good food!
It's a Starbucks....\n\nEach gate section has one on the secure side.  At some gates it is centered (like A) it is located at the split.  With the C gates it is only located in one section of the C gates.
I am a fan because they do not price gouge.\nThe price of a cup of coffee is the same at the airport\nas it is outside at any other Starbucks.\n\nKudos to Starbucks.
Tried Petrossian Bar twice during my recent trip. It's an excellent place to sit, relax, have a drink, and people watch. You can play spot the prostitute. :) Their Red Ruby drink was delicious.
I don't know why this place has low ratings, its good for a franchise restaurant, and way better than Olive Garden on sunset. Decent service and the food is always on point.
The service was great and the server was informative and amusingly enthusastic about the food, especially the appetizers.  For a fancy place the prices were unexpected, meaning lower than I expected due to the fanciness.  ie - dry aged steak for $25
Excellent food and excellent service.  The manager Kristen was awesome and so was our server Jeff. I highly recommend this restaurant for dinner.
The barbecue was good but not great. They do have a nice selection of barbecue sauces. The complimentary kettle chips were a nice touch. On the plus side, the food came lightning fast.
We were exploring the city and decided to stop in...we opted for the roof top seating and loved it.  Food, service and drinks were all GREAT!!!  The roof top seating was fun!!!  It was a great time!
I haven't tried many items or the lunch buffet yet, but from whatever I've had here, I would say its a decent option for Indian food. Being a vegetarian, its a nice thing to know that there is no chance of meat ending up in my food.
Breakfast buffet was decent. Food quality was average and so was service.
Decent breakfast buffet. I liked the omelet station. Some stuff was fresh and others tasted like they had been out a while. But decent selection for $15. Ours was free with our hotel stay.
Since the owner offered to make it right I have improved my rating based on his interest in customer happiness, I always try to be fair.
Always good. And they reopened. Much better. Diver's Scallops and chick peas. Who would have thought. But they were great. My girls Loved the cheese pizza. Truth be told I thought it was quite good as well.
I love this location! Wow, you cant go wrong with anything you order here. love it!
Now this airport Is much nicer. Not perfect, but much better than one in Texas Huston. \n\nPeople are welcoming. All is good. A lot stores and restaurants. I love to shop while I'm waiting for my flight. So it's all good.
Breakfast was surprisingly good! Salsa had fresh cilantro and lime. Wait staff were friendly and responsive. All good.
three-and-a-half star food at five star prices. it's not a *terrible* place, but you can find better food at better prices elsewhere on the strip. keep looking.
the house made ginger drink is as good as we heard
Do they really need another review. They are awesome, you should eat  here.
Awesome stadium. Bars everywhere, it's impossible not to get a beer. I had a full scale bar right outside my section. As far as the seats go, pretty nice view. You get almost a good view anywhere you sit. Cup holders FTW.
A decade later, it's just not the same....maybe I'm just older now. Maybe it's the crowd? Eh, whatever it was or IS, it's just not the place for me.
The food was pretty good. The service was pretty good. The problem was that it didn't really fit the Bellagio feel, it was like a straight up diner (not a cafe) in a fancy hotel.\n\nExpect a diner, not a cafe.
Waited an hour for a cold $15 burger when I got back the second time it was warm but not worth waiting for!
Not impressed. Decor is nice but that's about it. Waited to be seated, waited to have order taken, waited for food the came out undercooked and wrong. Expensive. I do not recommend.
I ordered 3 eggs and bacon * includes three pieces of bacon that didn't look very appetizing and cold toast I expected better from Bellagio I have has better bacon at Mom and Pop places..\n.
Took 30 minutes for a beer however the burger was excellent!  Staff was very friendly and apologized for the delayed beer and was very good about recovering from the mishap.  We came back the following morning for breakfast.  Again slow service and a slightly less friendly staff.  Oh well.
Save your money and eat a hot dog while watching the game.
Went to an event there last evening, their walu is to die for, fresh and delicious, not to mention their selections of different maitais, i will definitely suggest this place for an evening night out for happy hour.
The end is near. Went for one last hurrah before closing.  Love westroc and their products but the thrill is gone from tv.
White guilt told me this was some kind of racial slur against chinese people. Yelp told me it was actually a killer chinese restaurant. Yelp was right! So so so so good!
Horribly overpriced, but on Mondays the specials are a good buy and a delight of variety.  I won't come any other day of the week, but on Monday this place is a go-to-spot for sushi.  Good service but occasionally a little slow.
This macy's has the best selection of Kitchen Accessories. If I need anything Kitchen related this is the place I go.
Ah best food! Pizza is amazing, salads are to die for and dessert is heavenly! Love the friendly and chill enviorment! Have never ordered anything I did not like!
Takeout was a miserable experience here. We were told 20-25 minutes for our pizza and it took an hour and a half. We were charged a service and delivery fee online and it was not refunded when we picked our pizza up.
This is my first visit to this location, I have been to other locations and enjoyed the evening. The food was good , however the service was extremely rushed! The appetizer had barely been served when the entree followed. Not a very relaxing evening.
Good spot 1rst time here service was friendly and swift breakfast was affordable turkey link sausage 2 eggs poached hash browns not my fave but I would certainly return for some of the other options
Been here several times for breakfast and lunch.  Great home made food.  Soup is extra good.  Try the chicken salad sand. and potato salad.
Would not recommend. Food was mediocre and service was not great. McDonald is down the road save yourself time and money.
It's diner food for the most part.But I'll take it after a Long night of drinking.
Over priced food. Food was OK. \n\nNothing really speical about it. Maybe just the decorations.
Even for free it stunk.
It's ok inside.  Fried chicken was average and overpriced.\nNot sure why anyone would go here when there are other options near by...it's VEGAS!  Don't do a chain.  Do that in the Midwest.
Yeeeeehawww, well the wait was not worth the food.  Sorry Gilley's
We had lunch here last weekend and the service was slow but we loved the food! We tried the pretzel as an appetizer which came out with two sauces. We also ordered the fried chicken and brisket and they were both very good!
Will never go back again. Absolute worse service I've ever experienced!
Really, better sauce comes in a jar!  No basil on caprese salad, and swimming in dressing.  But what do I know.  Never had caprese salad with dressing.
Great place to get books for a broke college student!  Friendly staff and a great selection.
These Guys just get it right,great burgers straight forward toppings hand cut fries.I've eaten here on more than a few occasions with the family and everyone loves it.Counter service is always polite and expeditious .Enjoy.
This place kicks Candinas' ass by a long shot. Granted, you have to like dark chocolate, complex flavors, and high quality. If you don't value these qualities, go up to the capitol and get some super-sugary nonsense.
finally found a dish i like a bws.  i get the honey mustard salad which is tasty.  since my husband is a fan of bws i'll be back.
I ordered delivery, waited three hours.NO pizza and they wouldn't answer the phone. So I drove there, they told me they didn't open till ten p.m. It's the next day still nothing I had to call delivery.com and cancel my order.
Excellent lunch today for the six of us. The food was delicious and our server was just great. Brisket and pulled pork were both cooked to perfection.
This place was decent when it opened. Now it's not worth eating even if its a comp meal.   Eat at the cafe it's way better
You have to be kidding me.  Possibly the worst food in Vegas.  The only thing fresh was the salad and the horseradish.  Brisket=Leather tough.  Chicken= bla.  Dessert was sad.
Lots of options.  Decent food for the price.  Not remarkable.
Great steak experience! We had an awesome experience with the server last year; this year he's average but the food is a. Ma. Zing as always!
Great food, great server, great restaurant. One of the best experiences while travelling in the US (I am European).
Lily Barajas is an awesome manager!! Just remember it takes time for the great food!!
Definitely worth the watch. We found that they had the understudy performing parts and she often sounded better. Though mostly just a personal preference for voices.
This is the best show Ive ever seen.
This was a great venue for my first concert at the Joint. We saw Prince on Friday night and would see him from the floor and from the suite. What a show!
This is wonderful. We waited about 2 hours to sit, but played the slots and watch the fun music bead throwing going on at the bar! Great place and yummy food. worth the wait!
Very poor value for price paid and when they write fresh fish everyday. They might mean fresh frozen products as most of the dishes are tasteless.\nPlease improve the dessert section too!!\nYou have much better option in Vegas for $50 per person...
Overpriced for breakfast.  \n\nWeird seating arrangement\n.
It's simple people....  If you're in Phoenix, this is the place you must visit.  You won't regret it. Fantastic!
Best beer selection in Champaign. Cool atmosphere too.
Great beer. Great people.
friendly folks and unusual items. I've always found the quality good and the produce fress. I like the dried fruit and nut selection too.
Wow, band start and our server left twenty minutes later.  If you want quality food and any service, AVOID.  You want a bar that is under staffed and has holes in the restroom walls, this is your spot.  Band was great
Solid 4 stars. Good atmosphere, great walking distance to everything, decent parking , fries are amazing, menu has something for everyone. A bit pricey. Sometimes understaffed which causes slow service. But all and all a great place and had nothing but good times.
Nice market for healthy food and meats.  Their meat counter is great and be sure to try one of their many fresh sausages.  Very little fat in them.  Produce is good and prices lower than most super market chains.  They carry a vast selections of health food brands.
Every time we go it gets worse... Barely any steak in my California Burrito along with a tiny amount of pico and soggy fries.
My Filet was good, but when I asked for onions cooked without butter (b/c of a dairy allergy) they said they couldn't do it.
Prime rib special is a steal with soup or salad bar and great desert cherries jubilee is to die for
mediocre food and terrible service
If u come here on grave until 7am ask for Joy...great server....having saimin and Portuguese Sausage and scramble eggs....of course with rice... ono after a night out.
Oxtail soup, oxtail soup, oxtail soup.
Best selection of international specialty foods Las Vegas has to offer. There is not anything you cannot find here! Been coming here for 15 years ... It gets better each and every year.
this place is good for family,  The price is right and they serve good beer.  The food is pretty good four stars are for the service.  I don't like looking over at the kitchen and seeing the cooks eat food while they are cooking so that is why they get one star deduction
I know people love this place.  I can see why some people would really like it. However, it felt like I was in an assembly line. It is a little pricey. There are better places in Charlotte. I think people are just impressed by the free drink.
The mimosa bar on Sundays is tasty and inexpensive. I haven't had the food, but this appears to be a classic sports bar.
Food and service are excellent. Only thing keeping it from 5 stars is price...expect to spend a couple more dollars per dish than other sports bar menus.
Very nice place especially at Caesar's Palace. This was my first time trying dining at a Cheesecake Factory. The menu selection was huge.
Same everywhere. Still classy though. Same price, no happy hour though.
Excellent service, bread was hot and fresh, pizza cooked to perfection and price was very reasonable
Finally authentic Sicilian food in Phoenix. Combine it with great service and it is a classic go to restaurant.  If you haven't been to Tomaso's what are you waiting for!
Delicious Chilean Sebass, excellent Mac n cheese, and a great wine selection but the service.... A little slow
Service a little slow but when I think about the quality it all came together. Great food! Ambience was great for two people, romantic dinner in a both. Menu it's mostly steamed, broiled and fried very little chargrilled items.
Tried the \"All Lump\" crab cake after being assured it was as stated on the menu, no surprise....no lump to be found !!
I HATE IT!!!!!!!\nThey charge you twice the amount, than you would normally pay at the neighborhood corner SB's.\nIt's the same coffee dammit!
CHICKEN AND WAFFLES! you will need to split this unless you are a gluttonous horde (which I can relate :-) ) FANTASTIC!
Would have a had a 5-star if the wait and service was better.\n\nFood is amazing. They deliver on the twisted farm food promise.  \n\nThe fried sage fried chicken and the chicken and waffles were very impressive.
Most vile, disgusting breakfast I've ever had. Shit House a Go-Go is a great big no no. I was so mad when I left at being ripped off by this nasty place. Cold, huge portions of very bad food.
i got the famous andys sage benedict.  it was a little on the bland side, but because the portions are so big and the presentation really makes the atmosphere fun and exciting ill be going back for more..
Hash house a no go!!!      Found 3 out of 3 dishes lacking in flavor.    Huge portions.  Chicken hash was dry, pork Benedict was more country fried slab of over cooked meat.  Bbblt was full of bacon but not flavor.
Great food lots of portion!
Disappointed!! They  forgot I ordered coffee then didn't refill then food was cold.  The two stars is they took my meal off the bill.  Will not return.
Came to Vegas and wanted to try something different other than buffetts. I tried this place and I have to say it was pretty good. The portions are huge, you might want to share. They have a variety of food, and also specialty drinks. Overall everything was good.
OMG huge portions! You definitely should share I ate chicken and waffles which was extremely good my boyfriend ate the famous chicken thing the guy on man vs food ate and the leftovers fed us for 2 days LOL
Love this place!  Huge effing burger for a great price!  Delicious options!
OMG, I am so FULL!  Crab Cake and the ribs are my two favorite apps there! Be sure to try them. \n\nps...don't fill up on the biscuit!
Chicken Benedict is amazing!
WHY do some people recommend this place?  It took a long time to get to order, the4 food was not particularly special nor reasonable, and it was so noisy that we could hardly talk.  NOPE..will not go back there.
Great place, massive portions. Could split one order to 3 every time! Great place to go after marathons :) Yum yum!
I love this place.  When I am hungry and want to grub out I love coming here and getting different dishes.
Average taste, huge portions
Not a huge fan of this place. And Huge is what you get for portions. But each time that I gave this place a shot, no one in our party has been happy with the food. It really is flavorless. I have no plans to ever go back.
After hearing so much about this place, we went to have breakfast there.It is way overrated!!! IHOP's pancakes are way better.
My favorite place to eat in Vegas.  My wife's favorite too!!  We are so happy another one opened around the corner from us, i guess that means I'll have to go to the gym more though.
About as boring a meal as you can get without dozing off into your plate. Bland, plain and tasteless. The only part of the meal with any flavor was the large piece of salty bread. Avoid.
Mmm. Dinner here and it's so good. The chicken sandwich with cane sauce. Get here early cuz they are busy.
Visited the restaurant with a party of six and did make reservations prior. The seafood was okay, my only complaint would be the over cooked lobster. It was over cooked and had that rubbery feel to it. \n\nNot perfect and plainly okay.
I had fun when i went to this club last year!  Didn't have to wait in line at all.... fun times!
The company was much better than the food.  China Panda could give them a run for thier money.
Great food! This is a buffet style restaurant with awesome sushi, king crab legs, and tempura shrimp. The only downside is that they close at strange hours in the middle of the day.
I only went to the target here. Shopping center appeared to be huge.
I have been there a few times. The owner is a gilbert native and a very nice person. The food is of good quality, the atmosphere is great. It is best to visit here during the spring and early summer.
Love the atmosphere, food was okay for a smoked bbq joint.  Brisket decent, ribs and pulled pork were a bit dry and chicken was good... The mac and cheese was delicious!
OK BBQ. Pretty expensive for the serving size.
Good BBQ, good beans, good Mac and cheese! I wish they would have done more with the bread my pulled pork came on. Great atmosphere for a BBQ joint!
Order the ribs only next time
This place is printing money and rightfully so. They simply do a bang up job. Best BBQ in AZ.
Very good vietmanese sandwiches! Good price for a good sized sandwich, I had the grilled pork one. The only downside is the location and all the potholes in the parking lot. Worth the effort though.
Great sandwich. The location is out of the way but I'll go back.
Don't let the appearance fool you, this had good quality sandwiches. Get the grilled pork it's my favorite. really good prices too.
Not a bad joint.  Every time we go into the one at WestGate, it appears empty.\n\nFood is great.  Beer is great.  Menu is diverse.
Overpriced, slow, and undercooked vegetables. The pasta was the only highlight. Good atmosphere.
Food is just good, not great. Vanilla custard French toast is good. Omelets are a little bland. Corn beef hash was sweet and spicy...it is made in house.
Yep, this is one of the best buffet place among a thousand other Vegas casino buffet.   It was cheap as well.  I would come back again :) good food, cheap price, I can't expect more from Vegas buffets :)
Had a scoop of strawberry ice cream here. So good! They had so many other delicious flavors. The lady behind the counter was really nice. I have been here before & the quality of the ice cream is good!
You get what you pay for here. It's cheap so you that's pretty much it. They do have a happy hour but if you eat as much as an adult you might as well do AYCE.
Dolphins do not belong here.
Great experience getting a straight razor shave for the face and head..  Extremely friendly staff knowledgeable..  I will visit this location anytime I'm in town.
Curry is very dry. ordinary taste
This is the place to go for some great atmosphere and drinks the size of your head. They cost a little extra, but just get the double, its worth the jar. Live band and dancers. Great time.
Fun bar! Had live cover band and DJ Friday night. Drinks are light on alcohol.  But band was entertaining.
Group of 8 and had no desire to seat us!! Did not want to let us split up I to 4 and 4. Wanted to put us all on one check!! Not toe room receptionist was pushing 50 in buttless chaps!
I had a awesome time at this club. The wait to get in wasn't too long, the place wasn't overly packed like other Las Vegas Clubs. There is a nice outside area to relax in especially for the Summer Nights!
Poor man's version of Moon. Get ready for crazy pyrotechnics and smoke/fog machines...
The owner at N9ne Steakhouse walked the whole gang into Rain. Thanks for hooking it up. Rain was as spacious as I remembered it. I am not really into the trance scene, so we bounced after 20 mins.
Expensive drinks at $15 each, not great atmosphere since nothing is really exciting about it. Interesting performances hang from the center ring every 30 min of dancers from ropes, etc which added some fun.
I have been here a bunch of times.\nEach time, I don't pay at all.\nI will only come back if I get dragged here again.\nRain is okay, but it is not one of my favorite clubs in Vegas.
The valet service is good but flawed, Sunday wait for your car after checkout was around 30min(as I was told), I waited over an hour because they lost my car and brought it to a different tower
This condo/hotel is okay. Pros: each room has it's own balcony. Con: it's a far ass walk to MGM
Very disappointing! He did a few magics but I really expected him to do more. If you get the ticket more than $40, it is not worth watching. Also, the seats were terrible.
They are closed. New restaurant is Terrace Cafe and it's amazing. Welcome to the hood.
Great place. Friendly/efficient service and delicious food. Got a three combo platter, was plenty of food and was able to take a taco home. Generous amount of chips. Frozen margarita was strong. Definitely going back.
I came here for breakfast and it was delicious. The service is pretty good and the breakfast deal was only $3.49. Bigger portions would be nice though :)
Four Stars for Vegas Breakfast.  Had the Breakfast special.  It was a fantastic bargain for $3.95.  Only a few paces away at the MGM where I was staying and would have paid 3 or 4 times that much.  It was busy, but the staff did well despite being overwhelmed.
Very friendly n the food is pretty good! I use to work near by so my coworker n I hit this place up ordered a gyro n some fries n it was pretty filling. Very tasty plus for the owner being so sweet!!
This place rocks. They saw us on short notice and took care of business. Elvis was amazing. Was worth the trip!
I love their coffee!! Any form of mocha, cappucino, etc. Gimme gimme! Happy happy girl here. They have lovely sandwiches and you know I never got to anything else but do try the high test!
stopped here because we were starvingggg. overpriced. horrible customer service and not so great food. I ordered the cured meat sandwich, it was mediocre and basic nothing special. \ndefinitely wouldnt recommend this place.
Great food. Outside heaters not working!!! Cold!!!
Very nice place, Ate on outdoor patio. Shared a bottle of really good Riesling wine. All the food we had was very good.
Awesome place. Great service, superb food, and fun drinks. What more could you ask for?
The manchego bruschetta was amazing! Would definitely go back to try more if their dishes.
Nice place and very friendly staff. The girl taking my order was really helpful and sweet
Confirm the other posts. Don't waste your time at this rude place. Show up at their ppen time and doors wide open but tell you they are closed and not even an invite to come back. Good to not need the business I guess.
The seafood is excellent!
Great atmosphere & great service by Elizabeth.   \n\nThe food was a little above average.  Nice presentation, just not amazing.
Love this place..
This place was alright, just not what I was hoping for. The curry was a little too soupy for my liking. The customer service was great, we had a really nice waitress but unfortunately I don't think that would be enough for me to want to go back.
Once I loved this restaurant ,\nThis is third time we order vegetarian and they had chicken in it..
The wait staff kept on telling us that the bread was on its way as it was in the oven after a 1/2 hour the bread comes out wrapped in a napking and it was ice cold stale rolls  (we laughed)
Seafood combo pan roast is a must!!  Spicier the better too!
This is my favorite place to eat in Vegas. The long wait in line is oh so worth it. I can not to wait to eat there next week.
In the past I've looked forward to even craved Pho Kim's fare.  Unfortunately, my recent visits have not delivered the consistent quality I've come to expect from this establishment.  I'm beginning to think this place is not what it once was.
Ok food... I wouldnt go back. Not much else to say...
The food was great. The service was terrible.  Waited 30 minutes for our reservation. Finally had to ask then waited 10 minutes to pay the bill finally went up to the front and paid the bill. It is really noisy   If you are looking for quiet and nice look elsewhere
Service was good, and the place was big and clean.  They have so much competition in town, and the food was greatly lacking. Prices were not cheap for the lousy food my group had. I will not be back.
Good American food. Beer is pricey though.
Enjoyed our one night stay while in Scottsdale the night before we attended Eagles game at Cardinal stadium. Great location, spacious rooms, good breakfast and friendly helpful staff. My only complaint was the coffee was weak, almost like dirty water.
Good food, nice prices and friendly people. The place is well staffed although they could do a bit of spring cleaning, my side of the booth was littered with napkins and what not. Surprisingly they have delicious roast beef sliders.
TypicalMexican fare - it was pretty good but nothing special. The pollo fundido was pretty good and the bean burrito seemed pretty well executed but again there a million places like this in Phoenix.
ordered 2 carnita tacos with rice/beans. The food was cold and everything was flavorless. The food was gross and super expensive. Maybe the actual restaurant is better.
Great Mexican restaurant inside Planet Hollywood. Affordable,  a lot of food to share, good guacamole and salsa chips, friendly and fast service.  Nice seating area inside and outside, expectantly view. Over all - super satisfied!!!
Nice club, fun, friendly girls.  If you go, try to find Jade.  She does yoga, so is very flexible. She's a fun time; Let's just say I would be incredibly embarrassed if I were related to her.
Had about as much atmosphere as a walk-in fridge, so we turned around and went to Centurion.\n\nSure the house looks nice from the outside, but inside comfort and vibe did nothing to make us want to stay.
Parisian Macaroon (Red) is very bitter. I don't know if it is because of the dye or the almond flour. I can't finish it ;(\nThe filling is great tho.
Great for either a snack or a full meal. I don't think I'll ever order Nachos anywhere else. The Sopapillas were also standard-setting.
Yep, still darn good.  We ordered take out this week and it was just as good as always.  i wish that I had a Chen & Wok in my hood in Chicago.  Why is their lo mein so much better than everywhere else?
First time I have ever had anything from here. A friend ordered the red velvet bundt cake with cream cheese frosting. The cake itself was delicious, but the frosting was a tad too rich for me. I can't wait to try the other cakes they make.
The buffet is NOT what it used to be :(
I loved the tossed salad. The reason I ate here was because they had sushi...big mistake, it wasn't good at all...but I found other things that I loved. $19.99 lunch buffet and it includes your soda.
pretty good... lots of beautiful women
Overpriced rip off. Its bad enough that they charge $25 for an average weekend lunch buffet, but to throw you out at 3 pm is totally ludicrous.
Went on Valentines day and was major disappointment. Extra long wait for food that was very tasteless. We were shocked. Desert was also a disappointment.
Pretty good food. Large selection. Beer and wine were included which was a nice bonus!
Horrific.  One of the worst buffets I have ever had.  It's like going to a hometown buffet.  Some of the worst food in Vegas.
Typical Vegas bar: Beautiful girls serving expensive drinks.  Happily, however, they don't torture you too much with Beatles music.  It is VERY small and located behind the casino - so don't waste your time if you aren't staying here.
Great place loved all the B-boy events there.\nAll you can drink is lame with all the watered down cheap booze :-/
Love the music here on a Thursday!\n\nAll about the Hip Hop!!\n\nCant wait to dance here again.
Sent back a bloody steak and didnt see it for 30 minutes. desert took another 45 min to get there. Ruined our anniversery dinner, Longest meal I have ever had to sit thru...
One of the places with the best steak and service. My boyfriend took me out for a birthday dinner and I couldn't ask for better service or steak. The lava cake was nothing but a mouthful of delicious chocolate melting in your mouth. Looking forward to come back again sometome.
This was a really great \"old Vegas\" style show. I would recommend and will probably repeat.
Went to an afternoon show with my Dad (he's 76, I'm 52), and we both loved it. Only issue is that there are no servers, just a self-serve bar. Kid-friendly, too.
Very good italian restaurant within Caesar's Palace. We've had dinner here twice and both times were great. Their meatballs are fantastic. The service staff are knowledgable, helpful, and friendly. You can't ask for better.
This place is amazing all the time, everytime! Its one of our favorite stops in vegas and its worth every penny! Service and food always impeccable!
No complaints...ok well maybe one, it has nothing to do with the Spa it was me. I needed more time.
This place back in 2005 was the spot that started it all downtown. Now the last couple years it's been a joke. Drinks suck the crowd is pretty bad too.
The best there is. Simple as that. Period. Full Stop.
Sky high prices, low quality tastes. I guess you can do that when you're located right off the casino floor by the sports book.
Great place fun a fun, social dinner.
Great place! Had a party of 9 a very good place, enthusiastic waiter, food was great. The way the dessert menu is brought out so you see exactly what it's gonna look like before you get it.
Never disappoints!
Food was great and reasonably priced with restaurant.com coupon. I would've gave five stars if the waiter wasn't so cocky and direct.
Small shop in a strip mall.  Bingsoo is so tasty with frozen yogurt!  Owner is very friendly.
I filled my ample belly with OJ, fresh cantaloupe, ambrosia, easy over eggs, corned beef hash and a tiny spoonful of bread pudding.  Overall, I felt this buffet has slipped a notch since our last visit.
Cool Environment.  Expensive Food. Rude Staff.
Horrible service.  Every time we go to the Vig our servers never come by to check up on us. Last time we went, we sat for an entire hour before the server came back again. It's a shame because we really enjoy the atmosphere and the food is pretty good.
I really like the feel of this bar. I'm getting older and don't want the clubby scene of OldTown anymore. The wine selection was wonderful and I find its a nice place to hang out with your significant other or friends. Loved it.
$3 parking fee, and the valet has cones on every space. This is tantamount to a cover charge, and the food isn't THAT good.
Went to Vegas a bit TOO much but I wanted to take my brother there (family trip this time) and it was CLOSED! M&M world is 24 hours (or pretty much 24 hours) but this place was closed by like 4PM...boo!
Nothing special.  CMU's main convenience store.  Better for packaged goods than anything resembling a meal. Nice outdoor seating though.
Food and Service very good.  Ran into a few dishes we were not crazy about, but overall recommended.
This place is horrible!!! Can't believe how they are still open!! We went for RW, and what a waste of money and time!!! The only up side was the service, our waiter was very attentive ... But the food was terrible!!
great place to stay but the valet needs work......an associate by the name \"Craig mertz\" was rude and impolite, someone should teach that kid how to work in the hospitality industry
Food is great but service for food and even drinks takes FOREVER make sure you have No plans the rest if the night when coming here as you will spend most time waiting for service.
This place has great plates, ahhh gotta love the comps ;)\nlol
Ate here because we were at THE Hotel.  The restaurant is right in the lobby nicely done in dark wood and with a view of the passing Vegas crowd.   We had lunch and it was very well done.   The service was a little slow but if I was there I would go back.
I'm not a big fan of cabela's because their prices tend to be pretty high and many of the products they carry are their own brand...so much for variety.  The only things they seem to have a large variety of are fishing poles and guns.
Incredible food, ribs are great! Service is fantastic, I definitely would recommend this place !!!
A go to for a good dinner.  We have been there twice and both times were awesome.  The service was always prompt and courteous.  I have made recommendations to people I know, and have always been thanked after the fact by those who have eaten there.
doesn't matter i what i order, i'm always happy!!!!!!!\nsooo good!!!\ni live on the other side and i dont care the drive!!!!
Very good, but highly overrated.
Fantastic Pizza, wow!\n\nSo good.  Go get some authentic Italian Pizza!
The sandwiches here are very overrated.  All bread, very little meat.  The service is poor.  Take your business elsewhere.
Shrimp is really good, I always get a steak and that's good too. The butter cake is delish but the service isn't friendly and I have came back here multiple times.
Great food and very attentive service. Martinis are always awesome. Next time I may try to save room for one of their desserts.
This is an easy 5 stars. Amazing decor and atmosphere. Great selection and perfectly done steaks. My favorite is the rib eye bone in.
Missing lots of stores, is old looking, disheveled, and dirty. Very crowded despite being horribly cramped and messy. Everything about this mall screams \"don't go here.\" I'd give no stars if I could.
1 star for the fries that keep me coming back like a bad itch. Plus one more for the 24 hour bit - for the pure entertainment watching people passed out over their booth. Awesome.
My favorite place to go to de stress ! The owner \"King\" is a nice guy and really take care of his customers needs. Very reasonable prices and instructors are amazing!
Food taste good.  Portion is very small.  There is almost no service but charge 18% tip - this is not right!!!
JULY 27 2012 people go around in carts or u can order from the menu. The decor is ok. Overall this place is alright the food is not really that great. I would plan not to go to this restaraunt
Horrible place. Not happy about this selection a couple of weeks ago.  The service was horrific.  Rude and impatient staff.  Price is weird and they charge you for everything.  Not recommended at all.
The dim sum here was pretty good,  and the service was relatively friendly.  The location is right in the center of Chinatown.
Ordered dim sum for take out. When I arrived, two of three items were unavailable. I asked for two other substitute items. Also unavailable. Why did you even take my order when you are out of what I asked for?!? Next time, save me a trip.
As a frequent visitor to Las Vegas. I went there last night for the first time saturday 2/5/11. I had an awesome time. Great atmosphere and the drinks were very reasonable for such a hot nightclub. Can't wait to visit again.
Host knows just what customer service is. Friendly and handed us complimentary VIP wristbands.  More mature crowd than other nearby places (which is a good thing). Music is good.
amazing food, i loved the kobe burger, and the lobster mash potatoes. . . everything was well cooked
Had incredible ribeye steak & a Mac n cheese dish.  Perfect!
The duck fat fried French fries come out to start and you know you're in a good place. We tried a few things off the main menu but the Rib cap is seriously the best thing I've ever had.
I used to eat here, the service wasnt so great, seemed like the staff was snooty. I only liked 2 items on the menu. If you want good food with good scenery and nice friendly staff go up the road to twin peaks.
Good wine selection but the dude named Paul asked me if I need wine glasses or am I going to drink it out of the bottle.  Hu!  I have wine glasses thank you.  Rudeness tells me why he hates working here unless it's a bad joke, probably but still inappropriate.
Terrible service. Everyone in our party was forced to order their own entre, even though some of them were not hungry. The entre come with nan. The waiter refused to substitute them with similar priced roti because \"the chef was unwilling\".
Pretty expensive compared to Ghandi's just down the street.  Food was fine, but not wonderful.  A bit nicer ambience than most Indian places
The service is not that good and the food is also not that great
Had the lunch buffet for 14.95. All the basics included. As good as any Indian buffet I've had, and I like to think I've sampled some good ones. Certainly won't find a better deal on the strip for this quality.
Where can you get 20 dolla porridge and wish you were eating all you can eat king crab at Caesars??  \n\nhere.  :(  \n\nwhat was I thinking?
After trying this place for a second time during lunch, I found the food to be considerably better. I didn't order the sushi rolls and instead ordered Kung Pao Chicken and was pleasantly pleased.
I got food poisoning here last week ... and the MGM has been less than helpful in recovering the costs of having to change my travel plans, etc.  I have never been so sick.
Food and service were okay. Among the dishes I ate were sweet & sour soup and tofu with baby bok choy.\n\nThe decor seemed fancy. I liked the jellyfish lights near the entrance and the wood-covered menus.
This place has amazing shabu. The service is amazing and their meat is true quality.\nCan't wait to come back here!
I thought that this store was going to be better than the stores I have been to in California.
Very sad when this place burned down.  Loved their Hawaiian chicken. Looks like they were taken over by some new outfit.
This is an interesting place worth the trip to Tempe. OK food, OK tap, OK service. OK atmosphere. Been back three times so far and will go back again.
Pasties are good, yes? The service at this location blows. Who wants to drive all the way to Mesa, though?
Service was awesome had a waitress that was very attentive and gave great recommendations! Leak soup by far one of the best soups I have ever tried. Very unique food but good
Amazing place.
Gross!
Great Food...best Greek Salad!!  A little small gets crowded fast. Prices  Good !  love the New one in old town Scottsdale
I ordered their cafe latte, it was so plain and no coffee taste at all! Wouldn't visit their store a second time
Wonderful employees
Price was right. Cool concept but I like 5 guys better. What A Burger is my favorite burger, guess you could say I'm old school. In and out was busy and had good service but as for the burger's. A lot of hype.
always good - the perfect junk food fix that really tastes good...my guilty pleasure\n\nthe team here is consistently efficient & friendly
Visited it yesterday. The design inside is pretty simple - feels like aquarium. Sushi are overpriced and not good as expected. Not worth to visit at all.
Great food but not worth the rude and terrible service at the sushi bar.
I enjoy their burger every once in a blue moon.  I love the shakes, and the animal fries are super good!  I'd much rather order animals fries with a hamburger patty on the side.
I ordered the honey hot wings. The wings were nasty. They looked old and did not taste good at all. Sauce was horrible too!
I think the quality of food has declined recently and even got a little sick after eating there last time.  It's too bad because it used to be a great place!
I had a really nice waiter and the food were great! The waiter helped me choose an entree by describing what was in it. He made it sound really good and I ended up getting it. Taste magnificent!
My family and I came here last night to celebrate a birthday. there were 12 of us and we got the  best customer service, the food was hot when it came out. It was a wonderful experience last night.
I keep giving the Grand Cafe a second chance and then I keep regretting it. The service is incredibly slow and the food is only mediocre.
Extremely slow service.... go elsewhere!\n\nQuality of the food wasn't bad but ladies and gentlemen you will have a few birthdays by the time the food comes out.
5/29 - waaaaccckkk!!!! the only thing nice was the view! other than that, crowd was wack! there was no where to sit! small danceflr! thank goodness it was free! Rain is better than this spot.
I've always had good service here, unlike the Tempe location. I've never had to wait and the food is always fresh and yummy. Also... totally saw Dan Majerle waiting for a table there once.
Food was very good with nice size portions.  Wait staff did a great job and owner walked the floor checking and keeping things in order.
The portions are tiny, and the prices are very high. I ordered an orange juice, and received a shot glass of it. After receiving the bill, the OJ was $7 and my bagel was $5. This is the definition of a TOURIST TRAP.
Great food except for the chips.  Kind of disappointed as that is one of those cravings you want satisfied when you eat Mexican.  Service ok, not great.
The casino is old school,and so is thier restarunt,But if your looking to have breakfast you sure cant complain about the food ,or thier prices.
The quality of the food on the happy hour menu has gone down. Ordered the calamari and it came out stale and mostly all batter.
bloody mary, Amir, 70 degrees, Kona and v-land!!!! Perfect!! Great happy hour selection, beautiful outdoor venue, great drinks, delish Pad Tai !!!
Potato latke Rachel is unique and genius. Flavor is excellent and the sandwich melts in your mouth. Reasonable prices and large portions. Great experience!
Good, fresh, tasty, abundant, good value.  Say, \"Hi\", to Micky.
Having a small dogs it's comforting to know they can be off the leash with other small dogs in an open cage area. :)
white chocolate raspberry - ftw!!!!!!!!
These bundt cakes are amazing! Definite must try.
Always hits the spot when your sweet tooth is going Crazy! My favorite the Chocolate Chocolate Chip!!
Nice ambience and delicious food! Its never too crowded and the salmon green curry is amazing... This is my favorite thai place in the area. I wish they delivered during the day though :(
omg what the heck did I do? I came here again by mistake. Ordered the Satay. That is noooo chicken. Again inedible. Well, they haven't gotten any better in 2 years. Jeez I knew this place looked familiar.
Took me 1 hour to get a fish sandwich(they told me it would only take 20 minutes) ridiculous!!!!!!!
So so food...but I liked the patio.  Better food, and cheaper, can be had at Elmers or Filibertos.
Good family dining outside.
Free bean dip and salsa! The chips are hot and fresh. The portions are large so splitting helps to save money. I loved the mango margarita and the ambiance is fun. Great location!
I loved this restaurant. From the ambiance to the menu to the food and especially the check -- huevos ranchero and coffee under $9 -- it was all great. I'll be back.
What a rip off!  Ordered Margarita and they scammed me for premium tequila and when approached...they said too bad you drank it you pay for it!    Too bad restaurants have to price gouge to make their numbers.   I won't be back.
Laid back atmosphere, fresh food, very open seating. Delicious food. Plenty of parking.
basicaly, you get what you pay for.\ni had this the night before we left and i made four bathroom trips on the way home.
its 6 month's later  and i still hate this resturant ... i want my money back plus the day i wasted at the excalibur..... this place is a EPIC FAIL
Very basic and nit very good. plastic scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage...Fruit, cereals, and ughurt...Kind of like a high school cafeteria. Really bad when you compare it to M.
Fine place for any-time beakfast (certainly a step up from Dennys or IHOP). Good omlettes and if you can take the heart-clogging properties, biscuits & gravy. Also serves sandwiches, salads and smoothies.
Have not been there in a while.sorry I came back, Place smell like Pine Sol real bad! Bearly no meat on the Gyro pita no dressing on the Greek salad.
This building itself is just beautiful even if you don't step inside. The reading rooms upstairs look like something from inside a palace or cathedral. The call system for requesting books from the stacks below was way ahead of it's time. Take the time to check this place out.
Went here for happy hour and sat in the cantina, chips and salsa were delivered immediately and were delicious. Our server was kind and on top of it. The meal I got seemed a little over cooked but besides that everything was delicious and their happy hour prices were great.
Great food! Great service! Great atmosphere...99% of the time. The bar can get loud and obnoxious. If the bar is full, avoid it. The dining area is very nice. Order a cheese crisp and a beer. This place does Mexican comfort food right!
I came out from California and was looking  for good Mexican food. What I found was a diamond in the rough. The tacos were great. The staff was on point and did a great job. Will be coming back.
Terrible service terrible food. Huge disappointment. The food is plentiful but nothing special. We'll go back to Arriba.
The interior is phenomenal and the music was great! Get there earlier if you want your conversation to be heard better but still a great place to kickback with friends.
Enjoy this bar very much, always a must hit for at least 2 to 3 drinks, when ever i go downtown this bar is always a bar that i hit. Great spot highly recommended
Cool bar.  Kinda reminds me of this bar in the burbs of Cleveland called Johns Cafe I used to patron everyday!   And I love the indoor fire pits!
Just nothing good to say. Grilled salmon and grilled veggies swimming in oil and the salmon was burnt. Server never ask if ever how it was. I guess I shouldn't leave out that the rice tasted like it had been sitting around in a warmer for days.
Food was great. Service lacking. Sat at sushi bar. Sushi chefs attentive but rest of staff a little amateurish. I would go back but i was dissappointed in overall service
Always fresh and perfectly prepared. This is the only place my husband will take Japanese visitors from out of town. Enough said.
God there's a lot of hookers in Vegas.  This place in particular really seems to ring their bell.\n\nThe standard 15$ cocktail rule applies here, served by either Bartender A: douche bag or Bartender B: ho-bitch.
Such a great experience. I'm always hesitant on someone cutting my hair. Summer was great she did everything I wanted, was very professional. Will definitely be going back to them again.
Sorry ... not impressed with the pizza ... greasy ... could not finish the 1 slice I ordered ... Salad was blah ... free popcorn had no taste, no salt no butter ... blah ... not returning
Amazing food quality- had the Tuna sashimi appetizer- amazingly fresh and wonderful flavors.\nDinner was tilapia- excellent choice and perfect portion size.\nSave room for the cheesecake- it was seriously amazing with the strawberry sauce.
YUM! Nuff Said!
Excellent pulled pork sandwich! 100% pork -no fat! Also very nice French fries. My husband had an Amana blue cheese burger and he loved it also.
The lunch meals are great. I did have a bad experience with the egg foo young... I could not eat it at all.
This restaurant gave me a lovely case of food poisoning.  Need I say more?
Outstanding. Food was great and the service was outstanding too. I had chicken and my wife the spaghetti and meatballs. Both meals were outstanding. Would for sure eat here again. Little pricey but worth it.
felt like it was below quality meat covered with a straight from can type sweet sauce on top
Amazing food! Have been here twice. Very intimate setting, good service & great food. \nGarlic & spinach Nan was so yummy! So is the chicken tiki masala.
The moules frites is the best  hands down. Great ambiance.
Always a great meal. The food is out of this world. One of my fave places in the East End.
We had a second gift certificate to use, so we went back, for lunch this time and stuck to the mainstream of the menu with a pork chimichanga and a pork burrito, both of which were enormous and pretty good.
This is our \"go-to\" place for Mexican. Best taste and by far most authentic around. If you don't like real Mexican food feel free to stop at the taco bell next door.
Dont let the crowd or lack of crowd throw you off they Always serve delicious food as if as you are one of the family, classic food done right.
Phenomenally clean and the staff is beyond helpful.  They pierced my tongue a few months ago, it wasn't cheap but I really would not go elsewhere to have big needles driven through my tongue!
The piercer Kat was awesome and Effie aka stef at the front rocked and recommended some good tattoo places! Great people really quick service and great everything and affordable!
i had alot of fun last time i went there thier lounge room with the dance floor was cool and the security at the casino were frendly i enjoyed myself.
Love this casino resort off the strip! Facilities are topnotch! Even have a tv on the bathtub.
The rooms are great. The pool area is nice. My only complaint is a very high resort fee. Almost $28. I wanted to splurge a little and stay at a nice place but the fee made it not worth it.
Horrible customer service, didn't see anyone winning at all. Total waste of money and we didn't even have fun :-(
If you are Las Vegas bound and want too see the Grand Canyon the best way to go is by Helicopter with my peeps Maverick Helicopters!!! Stamp by \"MrVegasVip\"
I have been to Kincaid's for business and pleasure and all the times I have gone there, its been fantastic, classy, and delicious. Thumbs up!
Great French onion soup and French dip sand
No more than average serve and food quality with above average pricing. This is my second and last visit. They just can't pull off the fine dining restaurant concept.
Great hot chocolate, too & no complaint if you hang out for 2 hours like we did one late nite as did some other group....  The iced huge 32oz drinks are fab when it's hot.
Fresh seafood, attentive staff, and a nice physical layout. \n\nFirst time visit for AYCE lunch. Will be back!
The reviewer who described the pizza as \"tough\" was spot-on. This is literally the worst pizza I have ever had in my entire life. I would rather go hungry than eat Hungry Howie's.
nooooooooooo
Had hungry howies twice and this is really really good pizza for the price.  Out of all the places that deliver in Tempe I think this Is the best. Love their crust- we get the butter cheese and its delicious!  The price is really good and they deliver quickly.
Took my son to Oregano's last night for his birthday. Loved the Guaca-Tony!!!!!!! they gave my son a free pizza cookie for his birthday!! Thanks
Nice little pizza joint. Good pizza but only so so wine. Full bar so beer and mixed drinks available.  Don't go in with high expectations but enjoy the pizza and your company.
Nice little place with great service. Pizza was good. Will go down the menu and give it a go.
The service is great and the food is even better. Doesn't need much more explaining than that!
Chips come w/ salsa and beans. Dont be deceived - the beans are spicier than the salsa. Mix them on your plate = delish. Good, local start Mexican joint.
Totally edible chain restaurant food. Nothing exciting.
Lots of choices on there menu. \nThe grilled veggie appetizer is very good. \nNice place with a different atmosphere than an ordinary restaurant. \nVery friendly staff. \nThey also make there own soda  , which is  tasty.
Fantastic lunch buffett, pizza,  but also great if you just want a great bowl of home made soup and salad!
Should have never changed the recipes. I have been back twice since new ownership. I have to say I will give them one more shot. The place has lost the touch of service that was given. I feel while talking with workers that they can do better since everyone was really nice.
YUMMY!!!! Can't go wrong with Panera. The thing that urks me most is the single door entrance/exit...this place needs double doors with all the people going through it!
Probably the worst chinese I've had in years. Sweet and sour had almost no sauce, and the kung pao chicken tasted like beef stew, not spicy at all. Not worth half what I paid.
Two stars just for the fun of it...  but might be the dirtiest place I've seen...
I've come here a few times, the service is ok but the place itself makes me sick.  They blare the music so loud I became dizzy and got a huge headache.  I wouldn't be coming back here again
Great place to enjoys some pints and catch a game. A lot of floor space and a menu worth checking out. I little on the high side of cost for pub food, but such is expected in Scottsdale.
I go into this sprouts on a regular basis and I have never had a bad experience.
Had chicken tacos for lunch.  It's fast and inexpensive.
nothing good happens at club rehab lol\nHampton Beach NH is the same, just add cocaine and E-junkies make the world go round-keep rollin crackheads
I really enjoy what the Hale Center Theater brings.  I have seen some great performances and have been surprised at how well the scenary is done and the actors perform.  It is definitely worth it.  So happy Gilbert offers this.
Went to see Sound of Music November 29!!.  Absolutely outstanding performances from the whole cast!    Enjoyed this play more than any other I have seen there.  Fantastic! Cudos to all the crew that changes the sets also. I love this theater.
Interesting architecture, but that's all that was interesting about this place. Very college-pub atmosphere with not a whole lot interesting beer..
If you are looking for beer....stop by the pub!  The Pub has a ENORMOUS beer menu.  We didn't stop in for food, so I can't give any reviews about the grub.
This place sucks! Slow service, no beer knowledge, food taste like its leftover from a recent wedding
Great family owned business.  Friendly staff.  Great sushi and reasonable prices.  Check them out!
Get the Butterfish!
price and taste is perfect for my wallet and stomach!! love it!
Great location close to the light-rail, lots of shade, and ample restrooms. However, the beer selection is terrible, and the food choices only slightly better. But let's face it, you're going anyway. Just grab a drink and brat before you get here.
This pizza is like all of the other chains dominos, papa johns. If your looking for good or desent food go somewere else
Cheap prices and a great place to get fresh veggies. Place does get busy on the 1st and 2nd of the month given how cheap the place is so try to avoid those two days.
The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable. The service is fast and the food was great!!
The girly drink I had was sooooo good! \n\nI would pick Sierra Gold over Blue Martini any day! Half off pizzas and drinks for $3? Im game!
Typical local bar, but I'd say it's nicer than most. The drinks are cold and food is descent. The pizzas are pretty good, and even better during happy hour. The wings are good as well. Nice spot to hangout after work.
Beautiful place! Beds are great. But worst customer service. Only stayed here two times.  My wedding night and my sister in laws engagement party.  Slow service and rude workers. Too expensive for the horrible service.
Rubio's is on the corner. It is inexpensive. The food is ok. Nothing to get excited about.
I was under-impressed.  Stay far away from the calamari which came as a lump of fried mass of chewy something.
Overpriced, mediocre, lack of attention to detail and quality. Would not recommend. Don't waste your money.
A bit pricey but very good food.
The brisket and drunken shrimp are great.  live muic was fun on patio.  New owners have done a great job with refresh and menu.  New servers are nice.  Price was right
Good hike for kids!
Capo's on Sahara is delish! The pastas are yummy and service was great. The meat is cooked to perfection and seasoned very well. The ambiance is perfect for friends or a date.
Great Italian food. Great Sinatra music playing all night. Everything was excellent from service to desert. Try out the cigar room in the back.
This place was soo much fun. The food was delicious. Bobby the singer was wonderful and made my girlfriends night. Definitely will come back
Good food, fries are awesome but everything is so pricey.
I came into this place with high expectations. Boy was I disappointed, over-priced chicken fingers. Felt like chicken tenderloins that were put in oil. For the price, not worth it.
Dirty dirty dirty and their merchandising is with out a doubt the worst.
Slightly above average mexican food. One thing that keeps me coming back is they have excellent hot sauce. Service is always good. Very friendly staff. They do make great nachos maybe I should add a star!?!?
Where would I be without my TJ's???  I go for everything!  wine, coffee, cheesecake, cookies, and food!  not to mention wonderful flowers!
We came here for Valentine's Day and it was outstanding. Everything was delicious and the service was impeccable. Joon and his staff made this a very memorable evening for us. Highly recommended!
Great food and service.  Currently the best steak I've ever had, twice!  They are  consistent for sure!
Quick lunch so I had the Spinach power salad.  Pretty quick and easy.  Salad tasted pretty good.  Lots of people in there so it was pretty noisy.
Food is great when they get your order right or haven't ran out of something.  The staff needs to learn how to treat customers better...thus the 2 stars.
Love it! Very intertaining. Way better than I thought about a hynosis show.
I was super excited to see the show. I wish I didn't see the Youtube videos thouygh because I feel like I ruined the show, BUT seeing people do the silliest things is just plain hilarious.
Oh Ya!!!! The most incredible bodies on the planet. Performance is impeccable and who knew the best pop-locking I've seen in a long time!! What a great surprise! True Cabaret!
Went here for breakfast and it was just okay. The vegan options were minimal and our meal was just ehh.
I had a nice little breakfast crossiant/sandwich here and it was delicious. Place was clean and busy. Go small business!
Underwhelming service, and sub-par facilities.
Love squaw peak, 4 star rooms with a 5 star experience! good for a staycation, they'll bring you drinks while you float the lazy river. Plenty to keep the kids entertained as well.
Took forever to be seen by waitress. Not busy. Didn't ask me for anything to drink. Food was not bad but not good either. Got my order wrong. Nothing to write home about. I will not be coming back here.
By far one of the best buffets in las Vegas!
I added another star for their breakfasts. If you up for this, it's worth the $5.00 per person.
Great price and decent food selection. Discount available if you have Player's Card. \n$6.99 Breakfast\n$8.99 Lunch
Generous portions and good food.  I appreciatef the choice of black beans in addition to refried beans.
Gross, the shrimp aren't clean. The food is random and really poor quality. Small selection of food all around. My free wine was in a dirty glass.
This was the best theater I have been to in the Valley that serves food & drinks in the movie. Great lobby, statium seating, clean and friendly service. I'll be back!
When it comes to pizza, I'm all about the sauce.  \n\nBoston's has GREAT sauce.\n\nThe decor, it's kinda generic.
Best breakfast burrito in the valley. I have been here dozens of times since I have lived down the street forever and it is an old favorite. You will not be disappointed.
I use to frequent this establishment a couple of times a week for a Breakfast Burrito, however, on one of my visits the gal behind the counter seemed to have pink eye.  It's rare that I will go there now...
I have been coming here for a few years now and it is a great place to grab some quality Mexican food, and for the price, you can't beat it! I recommend the rolled tacos w/ guacamole or any of the breakfast burritos.
Best chorizo and carne asada around. Forget filibertos or any of his cousins. Los Favoritos is the bomb.
Up-scale environment and wonderful services. The food is good but not spectacular.
The place is nice, but you do expect more especially when it has Mario Batali's name involved. The portions are also small for the price you pay. The dishes are good but you want more.
Every trip to Vegas is incomplete until I end up sitting at the bar with a glass of wine, savoring the superb grilled octopus
Not good!\nService was wanna-be professional and food was average at most and WAY overpriced (had lamb for $100!).
I tried straberry waffle, it was fluffy and delicious... Coffe was ok. This is comparable with a Denis (if you ask me)\nI Did not expect to much from this restaurant; andIi liked what was served at my table.
We've eaten here 3 times and each time had great service and food. The deep fried platter for 2 is a great deal! I love the inka dish with fish and cheese and rice, it's my favorite! The selection and unique cuisine is top notch!
Awesome ceviche!
I've had better experiences at other churrascarias. the pork tenderloin and ham-and-pineapple selections were the only highlights.
Not entirely sure why this is 3 stars. I think it's delicious. The meat rodizio is amazing. Staff was kind and funny too. Definitely coming back here when I go to Vegas again.
Save your money. I got a deal 2 people for $30 and I still felt like it was a waste of money.
The food was awesome. The meats were overwhelming. The ambiance was fun. Definitely will return!
Been there today. My dog got all exiting , thought he will meet some new friends. Just kids and 1 dog on a leash . I'm still searching for a nice , crazy , open dog park. Where is it just for dogs, and they can run around no leash .
It's ok, good for a quick bite. I don't understand the almost cult like following.\nMade a mistake and had the shake instead of pop and was sick for hours.\nStaff was very friendly, but they needed someone dedicated to keeping the place clean.
I've been here a couple of times with my dad for dinner. This place serves pretty good dish. I didn't quite like the fried pork dish. I can never tell if I'm eating fat or meat. Other dishes aren't bad.
We went at noon and the three lions were all sleeping!
Blood stains on wall.   Check.\nLumpy college dorm room mattress.  Check.\nAsian guys giving me hard looks.  Check.\n$25 tables all weekend long.  Check.\n\nTwo star review.  Check.
This review is for the food court. It sucks. The price for what you get is ridiculous. Ive had better burgers at McD's and for a third of the price!
Saw Mike Tyson! Hahaha Sweeet
Very nice atmosphere if you like walking around looking at casino and shops.\n\nHowever, this place is way overpriced, with $10 cocktails.
This place is breath taking you have to go here if you go to Vegas.\nThere is everything, shopping scenery, but don't forget your camera!!
All of these casinos start to run together after awhile. But Caesar's does have one of the biggest gaming floors I remember seeing in Vegas.\n\nA good a place as any on the strip to throw away your money!
Great hotel.. Nice view of the strip from the rooms
Everything you could need is here.  Yes you can venture out... But why would you?!
Request a room in their newer towers that were recently renovated. much nicer and up to date.
I attended a meeting at Caesars in May.  I had been to Caesars many, many times, but have never stayed at the hotel.  They put us up in the Octavius Tower...very nice!  Big rooms, comfy beds, nice bathrooms and great views!
The room or pretty decent, but their WiFi policy is INSANE.  $25/day PER device.  I sucked it up and paid for my work laptop, and then determined it was $25 more for my iPad and $25 more for iPhone.  Absolutely ridiculous.
Norton my beloved retriever loves this place and the ladies here are always happy to see him walk in the door.  They have great products here carefully selected toys and treats for your dog's health.  I love that it's locally owned and I hope they do well!
The sushi here is always fresh and delicious.  Not crazy about there entries. There spicy tuna roll is jam packed with tasty tuna. Very good sushi bar.
This is my choice for Indian food. I go in for the buffet so i don't have to choose which one i want. Favorite would be the curie chicken.
I only ordered pho there and wasn't impressed at all but I saw some other dishes other people were eating looked pretty good.  It gave me the feeling that it's a more Americanized joint comparing to the ones on spring mtn. I'm willing to try again.
Just heard about yelp and looked up restaurants while in the Phoenix area. This place was amazing was there last Thursday, you gotta try their hummas combo. been to many middle eastern places, this was a treat. Great discovery!
This dog park is heavily used. The water feature for water dogs is really cool but it does not seem like people pick up after their dogs much. Boo, lots of poo!
A total waste of time. No poop bags, lots of poop everywhere, no grass, very small. My dogs thought it was boring. We are out of here.
Went back again and the food and price are still good!
I quite enjoyed the dinner I had here and would definitely return. Friendly service, excellent food... Seems on a par quality wise with Bankok Balcony in Squirrel Hill. Fairly small inside.
Asian Pear Martini, it doesn't get better!  We love the hummus sampler, too!
Good drinks one day. Great drinks another. Watered down drinks the 3rd day. That's why it got 3 stars. Wish I could have given it more. If go back though.
Un-Real best BBQ, very good!
This is an awesome venue!  I came here in April to see Garbage and the show was outstanding!  Every seat is a good one, the venue is small and intimate but not too small.  The drinks are a bit pricey but its Vegas.  The bathrooms were very clean and organized.
This is definitely the worse beach club I have been to. Yeah its fun on certain days when Party Rock makes an appearance... otherwise its just an overcrowded area with a small, dinky, and grimy pool!
I was not impressed.  My catfish tasted like some aquariums smell.
I try to avoid this market unless its absolutely necessary. Not because the selection isn't great or because the staff isn't friendly. Its because its almost always overly busy!
Great Asian Store in bad location. Too many homeless' in the parking lot  and by front of store begging for money or cigarettes.
Great burgers, waffle fries, and quick service. Much better then I expected and they have a good dinner menu and late nite burger menu also. \n\nPlus you can play keno at your table!!!
Dr Rusick is awesome! I was having chronic neck and upper back pain when one of my friends referred me to him. After just a few appointments I was feeling much better.  Dr Rusick will listen to what is bothering you and will come up with a plan to help your problem.
Dr. Rumman is NOT a helpful doctor, and she doesn't answer all my questions. Her whole attitude at the hospital seemed arrogant and least understanding.
Fun store if you are looking for Korean. To the poster that identified this store as Japanese, was wrong. Korean and Japanese foods are similar but not the same.
Definitely one of the best, if not best, sushi spots in the valley! Its a far drive for me, but well worth it to get authentic, good quality, tasty japanese food! I will definitely be back!
Can't wait until Cincinnati gets one... clean, quiet, and on-time. What more is there to say?
awesome people working there that really know their stuff. Great selection of guns. WE LOVE ARIZONA TACTICAL FIREARMS
My husband and I love, love, love the pizza. It all comes down to the crust and sauce which are both hand made each day. We always get the same waiter to serve and knows what we want. Great for a weeknight meal.
We love RPC!! We have been here for nine years and just love Pastor Bill's sermons and the worship here! Our son loves the Children's ministry and we are so happy to be a part of the RPC community!
There is always good stuff to find at the Maxx.  This store is a great way to kill an hour looking for something and end up spending 10 bucks.
Horrible customer service.  I guess you shouldn't expect the cream of the crop, but halfway friendly wouldn't be bad.
Wish it had a drive thru, but otherwise a nice location. Inside there is a lot of room and plenty of tables to sit and hang out. There are power outlets if you look, so you can also charge the computer, etc., while having coffee.
I would have given 4 stars but I got there at 10 when they opened and no one was home. 5 minutes later an employee showed up, went in and left all 4 of waiting outside for another 5 minutes. The haircut was good enough. I'd go back.
Came here while a robbery was in progress.\n\nThe cops asked me why on earth I would have come here alone (at 9pm, no less)\n\nAvoid at all costs, unless you need more excitement in your life.
Good breakfast burritos, all other food looks good too
The California Club and Breakfast Buzz are both amazing
Literally d'lish. I think I've had and loved everything on the menu. Nuts&berries salad, california club, turkey club, southwest burrito bowl, protein burger, ...everything. healthy and amazing.
What a great find! Coffee is strong and tasty. Oatmeal is very good as are the breakfast sandwiches with very fresh and high quality ingredients. Efficient, prompt and very friendly service. We'll be back!
Unbelievably great.
had them through my home warranty and they charged me 500 for a fan motor on my AC...way over priced but I was desperate and wanted it fixed. the new fan still didnt fix problem so it was a pretty big rip off. Would not recommend.
Good, consistent food in a nice setting with good service.  This is not stand out Italian food, but still worth checking out!
Great little Italian place.  Very small dining area, so a long wait.  The food was good.  The arrabiatta was actually spicy which is rare here since most places dumb it down for the general population.  Service was good.  A solid 4 star place.
Does not matter if the food is good if place is not clean.  Very dirty.
The carne asada tacos are definately worth while!!! Large size corn tortilla, good amount of meat a d great flavor! They seen to have a good selection of other authentic Mexican food! Will go again
Such amazing home services! I have had the pleasure to visit each home chatting with the employees, residents and the owner Lida. Beautiful landscaping and everyone is treated like family! I wish there was 10 stars to rate them! :)
Good chocolate croissants, even though they're shipped frozen and then baked at the premises.  \nDo they serve teas there?  I'll have to check that out next time I'm there for a croissant!
Tasty espresso, very friendly & welcoming staff, good atmosphere. Prices are competitive. Will definitely go back!!
Great place to stay!! Rooms are big and clean. The linens on the bed were great too!! Stayed here while the Ironman competition was in town and it was still nice and quite. Will definitely stay here again!!
You get what you pay for. Police where called to the room next to me. The rooms had a nice modern touch to them overall was a nice look however I did get bit by a bug while I was there.... Not cute.
Very friendly service, love that this place is locally owned! They will text you when your prescription is ready. Overall I've had great experiences here.
Loving Ulta! I wish they offered more loyalty rewards.
These guys were great.  They were prompt, even though it's quite a trip to get to my house, polite, and reasonably priced.  Everything I'm looking for in a plumber.
Great place for fast lunch!!! The buffet is always stocked here! Keep it up! Easy to get in and out of.
Your typical Buffalo Wild Wings franchise.  TV's are placed well, and no bad seat in the place.  Drink specials most of the time, and they show most UFC and boxing PPV's.
This place is shit .
This place is great! Always friendly service and they have good facebook deals too!
Yay for local babies! We got a smoking deal on a set of Dwell studio baby bedding here and stocked up on clothes and a few books. Awesome prices and the owner was friendly and helpful. We'll be back once the little one comes!
Longest wait times ever. Nobody is in the office and have been sitting here for 2 hours. Never again. Go somewhere else.
Laid back coffee shop with friendly staff, reasonable prices, and great coffee! What more can you ask for?
Solid Mexican in a seedy part of town.  It's a shame that Carolina's is so close otherwise I might drop by here more often.
too many bad experiences at this rest. to count. they always get my order wrong. if its not that they will have someone rude at the counter. they have kids running the rest. skrewing things up. burnt food, terrible customer service. stupid to eat here.
I used to love this store but it has really gone down hill the last 3 years. My last three visits to the archery counter keep getting worse and after Saturdays poor service I have had enough and won't be back.
Good as Home Depot can be. Depending on your taste, Lowe's may or may not be better for you. They're the same but different. :) Selection/brands that is.
I can't find anything here! I can't even find a nearby employee to help me. FRUSTRATING!!!!!!
Some of the worst Chinese food on the planet and it is served with some attitude. If you live in QC try China Chef by the other Fry's, blows this dump away!\nSoggy dead food! That sums this joint up.
Have to say I love this place. Usually order take out vs eating there but they are always very friendly when we go in.   Food is yummy, the price is right and service is quick.  Would have given 5 stars if they would deliver lol!
Very clean and nice staff.  Probably one of the best locations they have.
The guy working Oct 18th turned then open sign off more that 20 minutes before the 8pm close time posted.  Went in and asked if the store was still open and the response wad \"I guess I could make something.\"  Lucky we only wanted drinks.  Owner should be pissed!
This is not a place I will return.  They are not very friendly and when you make a request for a design, they look at you like you're crazy.  My designs came out absolutely horrid and I ended up just going somewhere else for a new polish.
This place was very average. I've had much better Mexican food and this reminded me a lot of a Chipotle, but maybe a step below. I'm not a fan and wont be back, there is much better Mexican food in Arizona.
I used to really love this place. The vermonter is the best sandwich I've ever had. My only issue is that they have shrunk the size of the sandwiches and kept the price the same. But the flavor is still incredible.
Ulta sells a wide range of brands of beauty products from drug store brands to high-end designer brands.  The cool thing is that they actually accept manufacturer coupons. They also have their own coupons and frequent sales, so you can get good deals here.
Yeah, its BBB....what else to say?
Place was open today! So it gets an extra star!!!
Always busy, always a full parking lot. Be prepared to hoof it.\n\nGreat selection, friendly staff.
A great experience, great driver. On time - text alert for ETA very reasonably priced
Cox was great until I spoke with their customer service person Juan (Employee #1347). All I wanted to do was take some packages off that I currently have.\n\nI'm paying the 150.00 cancellation charge and Cox can shove it!
Just horrible it taken them a month to transfer my internet over. One guy I talked to was crying about him not wanting to lose his job and that he needs his job. They also don't return their phone calls. I'm glad I payed them $60 for no internet.
WORST COMPANY EVER.  Horrible customer service, not friendly.  I had to walk the representative through the website over the phone.  They don't care about loyalty at all, or keeping customers.
One word.... Horrible.
Go in, Talk to AJ or Jeff. They do good things for people. See my upcoming review of the metrocenter store for more.
Best mocha EVER! Wayne makes the best drinks and is always a delight to see in the morning.  I moved out of town, but when I visit, I stop here every morning!!
No bueno!! I dont recommend this place. Its no where near authenic mexican food.
The food was good, but looked like they needed a maintenance person, there was food all over the trash can, the tables weren't cleaned either.
Good food and very friendly service.
Not bad at all. The refried beans and rice were standouts.
The hot dogs are pre-made and available for a \"hot dog buffet\"\n\nThey also sell cheesesteaks which are actually very good.\n\nNot fancy but good food.
I have been here several times and they have the best cheesesteaks. I was not impressed with the mexican food I ordered, but the classic cheesesteak with onion is the best, and don't forget onion rings.
Not bad.  You get bar food but I think you expect that going in.  Nice enough ambiance for lunch.  Great service.  The veggie burger was edible.  The sweet poatoes were edible.  The green tea was good.  I will go again since I live so close by.
Great place in neighborhood. Food is excellent most meats are smoked with awesome flavor.Great Happy hour for drinks and they offer their boneless wings on special.Service has been extremely slow as of late not sure why but hope it improves?
Great hang out spot in Phoenix!    Staff is amazing and I will definitly come back next time in Phoenix!
I would give zero stars based on service and courtesy if I could. The woman in the drive thru this morning was extremely rude. Glad nobody was behind me because I backed out of the drive thru and am so glad I did since now I'm eating real food.
Good food but we lately they can not get the to go orders right! \n\nNothing worse getting home with your order and it's not right! TWO TIMES AND A ROW!
Nice little place!  We had huevos rancheros with hand-made tortillas. Very nice family, their younger daughter serves.
I ordered the bite sized chicken pieces. There was a bone in the very first one I but into. It cut my gums up. I am very dissatisfied. Avoid this place,
My previous visits to this place left me quite unimpressed but recently there seems to have been a marked improvement in the food quality. The ingredients are fresher and the food is tastier. Service is friendly and the place itself remains clean, spacious, and bright as before.
This sonic is pretty bad when it comes to customer service. The window helper sounded like this was the last place she wanted to be and looked it as soon as I got to the window. I'm not expecting perky and perfect but friendly and alive would have done just find.
Very friendly service and a great dining experience.   Wr sat outside which was very nice.   The pizza was probably a 3 or 4 star but the service and atmosphere makes up the difference.  And a plus,  they serve Coke products.  And there are not too mancy choices in Verado.
Visited again today.  LOVED the new musical instrument section and the expanded sheet music area.  AWESOME.
Bookmans is all great.
Dated, but nice.  Good Chicago hot dogs and they sell Old Style beer!  Can't beat that!
Slowest rental car check in ever. Took over an hour and I wasn't even sure what the hold up was as there was not a big line at all.
I always prefer to support the local businesses but Subway is better.
Much cleaner and nicer location than 15th Ave & Bethany Home Rd. Employees are friendlier and more willing to help here it seems. Bigger store with slightly larger selection also.
They don't have the usual great subway service that you would expect from a subway. Ive been in multiple tines and employees have not had a uniform. No great and they are mean when attend to you. I recommend the service at jersey mikes better.
Pretty decent compared to other places in the area. A lot better than the one by Grand & Reems. I will come here again.
Oh my god. that's worst service. The staff is not very polite. I feel very bad, food is OK, one star, I won't go back to eat.
I was able to call these guys just after 7 on a Saturday and drop it off at 8 and pick up by 10 for a wedding.  Pretty happy so far although I haven't gone to the wedding yet..
This place was so disgusting. It was so dirty and dingy. I needed one nail repaired and a blind person could have done a better job.
Worst manicure I've ever had. I created a Yelp account just to provide this feedback.
The guy overcharged my sister for sure! Pizza was mediocre, I'm from NY and I know what good pizza tastes like.
Horchata is delish! Familiar faces is nice. Pretty good veggie burrito, bomb breakfast burrito, seriously good. Decent prices, but their guacamole could use some work.
Been going for 6 years  and great pizza just like my  previous home on Long Island. Service and atmosphere stink.
We've ordered from Slide and Bounce Around a couple of times... We love what they offer and had a Blast every time!!
Always someone or something wanting a hand out. This place smells in the early mornings
I really dislike it when i go to a resturant and do not get acknowledged. 10 min. Is just too long.  Then to serve tepid beer and not offer a glass.  Not good...not good.
They are remodeling the place. It's gigantic but a little messy
Spent 16+ on my food; got half and a flat soda. Terrible.
Healthy, Tasty, Fast, Cheap, what's not to love.  Awesome for mall food for sure!
Not bad. Fairly small location. Staff was friendly, selection is kind of lacking.
if you are looking for a pizza better then Pizza hut or Little caesers then this is your place...not much of a compliment but the pizza here is pretty ho-hum...
Is it just me, or does anyone else feel the need to sanitize themselves after leaving this dark, grimy store?
So Sad, I went here the other day craving the ZBQ pizza only to see that they are now CLOSED!!!
Golden medium wings are amazing
Im sorry that I brought 30 people into your bar. Your staff was unprofessional and rude. You are a shit bar. Go fuck yourself.
My chicken was undercooked and was onion filled in my chicken fajita pita made me not to ever get one again thanks a lot
After waiting for two hours I kept noticing that they would take \"regulars \" or friends over people waiting . They have a number system that's not worth a sh*t. Why have numbers when you're gonna pick who you want. I will never go back there again!
Came because they claim to cut high tech auto keys. Not only did I not get a key cut but I was told they could not cut the key for my Honda. If you are going to advertise that you cut high tech keys then you should be able to.
Employees are really loud and very rude while in break. Is there a reason why 3 of them are yelling and laughing hysterically and manage to be louder then all 20 ppl sitting and eating in the dining room?
I love this place! They have great gas prices and friendly staff. The lines are long but they go quick. The baggers are extremely helpful and always go above and beyond.
as far as a walgreens go this one could be a lot better. the employees are not very helpful, the pharmacy is a joke. try to avoid this one, nothing to see here folks.....
Very friendly. I went in looking for minis and Dungeons & Dragons books. I didn't find what I was looking for, but the staff was nice. If I lived closer I might check back again.
Hands on customer service. Always will return for my engraving needs.
This is by far the worse KFC I have ever been to. No matter what I have ordered it takes for ever. The food taste old! We need corporate to come revamp the staff and retrain on the cooking or they won't stay be in business much longer.
So, I decided to try the Flatizza, BIG MISTAKE. Had enough pizza sauce on it to make a large real pizza. The flatbread was so hard I couldn't eat it and the cheese was cheddar not mozzarella.
I have always found the tavern to be a good place to grab a cold one and share some conversation with your friends.  Recently they put together a bicycle bar crawl which I took part in, and had a great time.  They have all the sporting events, including UFC fights and all the NFL games.
After one of the people from this store walked around our furniture showroom and passed out her business cards to my clients, I DEFINITELY will not be shopping here. That was low. Not sure why this posted 18 days ago, this happened about a year ago.
If you don't care about quality Chinese food panda is the place...\nI don't mess with meat there
Only thing good is the garlic parm  wings. There's not a lot of meat on them and all the other flavors are disgusting
I was in North Phoenix for a friend's birthday.  This place was choose by one of our mutual friends.  This place is very authentic!!!  The help speaks Cantonese! (and English) and were very helpful in their recommendations.  I would go back if I lived up there.
LOVE the diamond ice!!!
Love their boba and especially their diamond ice that fills with fruit such as strawberries, melons, and my very favorite red beans. Always order the medium ones cause you will crave for more if you order small. Guaranteed! :)
It's always a better day in Arizona with some Boba. The spot is cool and urban, but has a touch of authenticity. Stock up on Asian supplies from the market next door while you're there.
This Place is DIRTY DIRTY DIRTY all the time!!!! Lazy employees. Please hire someone other than a nineteen year old for the fast times.
I've been a customer for several years. David came out on time and quickly found my leaking tub valve.\n\nYou can't go wrong with Citywide.
I really discount tire for their prices and warranties, but one thing I can't stand is how they scraped my lip on my new wheels when they installed the new tire. Of course they denied it...what to do, ugh.
With Walmart being so big, they lack customer service. Pressed for assistant more than 3x at the fabric section and no one showed up. They just keep losing sales over and over. Will it ever get better??!!!! Such a disappointment.
Staff here is extremely friendly. Starbucks inside is great to get before shopping. Better than most Targets I have been to.
Really good food. Get the deal for two, it's a really delicious meal for a decent price.
1. Quick place to grab a bite during lunch.\n2. decent service.\n3. decently clean place. \n\nJust OK
What a place for buying a disc golf and gathering info for disc golf! awesome selection of discs.
Small sparse store with a limited selection of books and products. Well intentioned, but sparse. Maybe their classes are good..I do not know!!
If you want to deal with uneducated and unprofessional loan officers, wait three months for your loan to close, miss your closing date, loose the house of your dreams and pay $2000 in originations charges, stop looking,this is definitely your mortgage broker!
It was just ok as far as food goes the service I give A+, I went during rest week and got a great price and good value, But as for going and paying full price.I would say I would not go back . You can find much better steakhouses in the valley for similar price
Generally, Walgreens is a great organization, but they definitely have a bad apple with this store.  Rude, inconsistent employees.  I complained to the Walgreens corporate office about them, but no response.  I guess corporate does not care about customer service complaints.
larger stores in phoenix, large selection of fresh meat and seafood and a great selection of microbrews
When I asked a employee for help with shoes he tried to run off and not help me. If you are busy just say so I will not get offended by that. Just tell me so.
This is the RUDEST Trader Joes I've been to. It was like walking into Walmart, only worse if that's possible. Only one person/employee in the whole store had anything resembling MANNERS! !\nYIKES!!!
Save your $300 initial consultation and go to a Macy's personal shopper--they are free.
Big.  Scary.  Walmart.
You will not find more honest business people than the owners of Select Glass. They stand behind what they say and do. I will do business with them again and again.
Drive thru and fast turnaround are nice but not for the rip-off price of almost $8 per garment. Especially since they don't replace buttons they cracked!
OK in a pinch but really very average when it comes to Thai food. Decent lunches but not a great Thai place like Lattitude 8.
Whenever I have extra time at lunch, I cruise over to this place. I love the spicy coconut soup with added veggies or the peanut butter chicken. Service was great as well. I have no complaints about this places so i gave it a 4 star.
This place is great. The food is really good and spicy if you want. The drive up is really helpful as well. I do wish they gave more rice than one bowl but that's not too big of a deal.
The food is definitely something that needs improvement! The pizza dough is tasteless and overall in need of improvement. Burgers and wings are just average bar food  - nothing special at all. If you like to bet on horse and dog races then this maybe your place to go.
Happy hour now sucks. Only 1 beer per month on special. Next time I'll go next door to O2. New untrained waitress had to go ask someone every question I asked her.
Food was good, but, the service was horrid. Staff was more interested in spending time socializing with their friends who were also there.
Several steps above Pei Wei - I come here for lunch frequently.  The Singapore Noodles are great, as are many of their stir frys.  Locally owned and operated!  This place has many regulars, I know of one couple that eats there every day!
This place still stinks.  Maybe they can become a vets office or something useful.
This location has been under new ownership and very well run now. The place is very clean, customer service has been top notch, and they have been more than generous with their toppings. I'll visit again and again.
I have tried 3 or 4 dishes there and none impressed me. Their pad Thai is okay... One of those restaurants that I would eat at if I craved Thai and there was nothing else nearby.
It is a small place and on busy nights do takeout. Great food for sure.  I have not tried a dish that wasn't good. Their food is prepared with care. We eat here often and always take extra home.
Review wrong restaurant.  This one is located in Walmart.
Have only been for lunch on 2 occasions.\n\nSalad and soup was great but it took awhile to get it. Not sure that would be good if I worked!
Barron's is our favorite pizza place in Anthem. The toppings are good, the service and selection are good, and the pizza isn't as salty as many pizza places.
Eh...  Ok, but not really inspiring.  Thin crust was THIN, and the toppings kind of slid off.
Worse Home Depot lazy waited 30 minutes to get help in electrical department. The CUSTOMER SERVICE person told me\" I paged the person what else can he do! \"\n\nGo to Val Vista store
Not sure what's going on, slow service many of their own beers out of stock on a slow Sunday evening.\nFood was so slow I cancelled my entr\u00e9e and left.
An absolutely stunning resort in the middle of the dessert.  Lots of great activities: horseback riding, ATV tour (a MUST), etc, and golf.
I tried the green chili omelette and a caramel roll.  There are a number of pretty unique things on the menu, and everything that we tried was prepared well.  The setting is quite nice, an older house with a nice patio for outside seating.  I would definitely come back.
The food here is awful. Go elsewhere.
This nail salon used to have much better service. Stopped going here, then decided to give them another chance.  Boy was I disappointed. Water was cold, then the girl stabbed me twice while cleaning and trimming my cuticles.
Picked me up, not a selection of cars at all, and very slow
Do not wash your car at this place. The owner Matt never answers his phone or returns calls.  He also will over charge your credit card and not make it right. This place is no good be warned.
Queso fundido, enchiladas , and guacamole all awesome. By far one of the best margaritas I have ever had. Prickly Pear was awesome!!
Not really a fan of anything they offered food and service was not even worth writing a full review!!
Dinner took 45 min to arrive despite few customers in the restaurant.  How long are you willing to wait? Staff kept saying it would be ready soon. Will think twice before going there again.
This is not the best pho in the Valley. I hate to write a poor review of a business but don't get your hopes up if you're a pho enthusiast.
Very bad customer service. Too many kids work there and goof off! No management what so ever.  Never got my lunch meat on time once. Go to the store off Combs.
I've been shopping here for a few years and this shop is the best. Fantastic prices, friendly staff, shelves full with great selection, open late. I'm always glad to support my local businesses!! Highly recommended!!
One hour till closing and the teenagers they have running this place are shutting down the line and leaving the nastiest looking food on display --- and 8 customers walked in expecting something professional.\nI'm heading over to Signal Butte next time.
Pizza tastes good. But delivery is horrible. Pick it up yourself unless you want to wait 1.5 hours to eat.
No place settings - had to steal from empty table.  Dough wasn't cooked all the way, cold and doughy in spots with hot toppings? Frozen pizza kinda quality. Salads were drenched in dressing to the point of soggy lettuce.
I'm disappointed that I left SJ, CA without any problems. But leaving Phoenix AZ I was charged 50 dollars for my luggage be 4 pounds over weight.  I left AZ with exactly what I left home with if not less.  Thanks for nothing Southwest. This is totally BS
Always packed to the walls on the weekends so plan accordingly. As usual, no gourmet pizza here of course but I still love coming here because they make a super tasty pizza! It reminds me of my childhood.
Subway is typically a good respectable place for a quick sandwich.  This location is as well.  Fast, cheap, and tasty.  Good location right off  of Higley and Pecos.
Nancy Erdmann was very rude and insensitive. I felt rushed.  Sadly, I'm someone that's going through a tough time health wise and I'm just looking for a good doctor to listen and help me.  The search continues...
Love it and love the GF menu.  It's amazing how many dishes they have
Well, let me just say I really love this food, but now when I have to wait 45 minutes for it. Their \"pasta machine\" broke. GREAT.
I absolutely love this place and desire to eat every meal I can hear because it is so healthy and the juice bar is phenomenal.!.
I always get in and out pretty fast.  The servers have always been very friendly.
Overrated. Don't go out of your way. The tortillas are better than most places but the entire dishes are not special. If you are in the neighborhood its worth a stop but don't make a special trip.
The best! if your in the area, you got to stop by carolina's. you won't be disappointed in any of the food! definitely a fast reliable, and reasonable place to regularly go to
Friendly & great service.  It is a 30 minute ride for me but well worth it!
Typical Red Robin, so not much to say. The rib tips are crappy, but the beer was nice and cold.
This is always a good place to go with family,  love the Royal hamburger and endless fries my daughter loves the mac and cheese
The employees here were extremely helpful and very nice. They helped me find exactly what I was looking for and very quickly at that. I definitely recommend this Ace for anything and everything you may need.
This is a really good restaurant!  A must try for people who like Korean food!\n\nFavorites: Bulgogi with lettuce wraps and chap chae\n\nI really want to go back to try the karaoke here.
It's very smokey but I love the true non smoking section for bingo. Bingo is great here.
Our go-to place for Chinese food in the Mesa/Tempe area! We love their Mongolian dishes, vegetable fried rice, kung pao, brown rice, Etc etc! Always great service & amazing prices!
Dollar Rent-A-Car requires you to fill up within 10 miles of the airport and show your receipt.  I used the GasBuddy app to find the cheapest gas in the area, and this Circle K fit the bill!
I've been here coupla times in the past week or so.  It's a nice clean store, nothing special, pretty helpful clerks, good selection, average prices.  There is a nice big parking lot so you can always park close.
It took 34 minutes from the time we ordered to the time we received 5 small shakes.  And when the girl arrived at the car, she didn't know which shake was which.
Really good Ethiopian food. Atmosphere lacks but don't come here for atmosphere!!\n\nThis review is for their new location.
Slow and understaffed.  Looked past me and took known guy behind
Had a scheduled appt for these guys to come out and fix patio door-no show-no call-didn't return my call. Tells me they are independently wealthy and don't need new business.  Advice to everyone, Pass on this one when looking
I hat the pepper and pork stew, it was fantastic, and very filling. Along with the stew I also had the creamy corm Polenta it was absolutely great. It had a nice atmosphere and some unusual architectural design. \nGive it a try.
Had the pork chile stew, very good.  Large portion size, make sure to ask for the bread, it is very good as well.  Great atmosphere and wait staff.
Slowwwww service. From waiting 30 minutes to be seated (with open tables) to waiting 20 minutes before being able to order and 40 minutes for our food.
Great food using local sources.  Really cool casual vibe.  Love it!
Message test dinner at MNs suggestion. Cool urban setting.  Forgot I was in Phoenix.  Felt more like Denver or San Diego.  Pizzas and salad were stand outs.
Good food, friendly wait staff, causal atmosphere and great place to meet friends for lunch or dinner for a relaxing meal. If you are looking for an adventure into the best of wine from Arizona, you can get it there.
Service Fry's & Fry's Marketplace FAIR enough.Price............HONEST so. Best for weekly  shopping like me...little but every Friday it got festive look.
Meat delil lady today talked crap to her manager about me not knowing my wife was stand right there. So she went and found me to try and help after she relized. All I was asking for was her to cut my meat. I emailed corporate about her.
Amazing food! Great prices! Love this place!
Jennifer Lynn has been my hair dresser and my kids hair dresser for years now.  She is very talented with cutting and coloring and always gives my whole family a great new do.. The salon is in a great location at Kierland also...
This Costco is our local.  Sometimes the weekends can be really busy but if you go on Thursday or Friday night it can be a quick trip.\nGas station on site is cheap (of course) but always busy.
Pretty tasty coffee and local owned and operated if I am not mistaken
Fun staff, amazing coffee. Try the caramel mocha frost. \n\nI hate the smokers outside... gross! And they ruin the view.\n\nI love this location because it's close to Whole Foods. :-)
Very good food!! Great take out. I recommend the Mongolian Beef. Small dining room if you choose to eat at the restaurant.
Average location. Clean, drive thru is a little slow, but employees are friendly and helpful.
I highly recommend this company for your auto glass.    They showed up on time and the technician did a great job.
A step above The Street in Mesa but not as good as Bomb Boba and other places in West Phoenix. Still pretty good though and they have a lot of flavors and varieties of Boba.\n\nAlways get the Honeydew Slush~
I'm still coming here for my hair. Always happy and Melinda is a great to visit with while getting my hair done.
We always get the pizza and wings when visiting this establishment.  Great wings and crispy pizza.  When your here try the pizza fries, they are awesome
Great Company & Product! Hands down
Good pizza but can be a little oily/greasy.  \n\nNot really sure what else to say here.
Service was weak for the upscale image they try to pull off. The toppings weren't balanced on the pizza pie, although I'm a fan of the brick oven and fresh ingredients. I received dirty silverware. Room for overall improvement.
I cant understand how this place is still in business, the food is over priced, the quantity is little unless you like lots of bread but not enough meat for the $8 sandwich. went  there 2 times and will not go back again.
Bad service- rude and unhelpful.  \ndirty - I saw a guy pick up the floor mats and clean them and never washed his hands. \n The food was horrible. Never again.
7 min before a server came to our table ...ill update once I actually get my food ...if I ever do
Can't go wrong with Zipps, love their wings!
Went two days in a row to be sure it was really as bad as it is.  Shrimp scampi is a good example, chopped spaghetti with  a dozen popcorn shrimp stirred in, small portion served cool, high priced for warmed over \"stuff\"
Love the lunch specials here.  Such a great spot for lunch and the food is delicious.  The service has always been great too.
Horrible customer service skills. Linda that helped us need a attitude adjustment. \nWon't go back to this location.
This place is shit the workers lie about transfer fees and when they find out you dont have an AR or Glock they are dicks.
This is the worst Whole Foods I have ever been to. This location is decorated more like a warehouse than an upscale market, and the selection seems to be lacking verses other stores I've visited in the past. If you live in this part of town just go to AJ's.
For a quick lunch, my friends and I would go here. Quick, friendly.
This is my neighborhood grocery store. It's at the two locations I shop at most. It's always clean and well stocked and I never have to wait in line for very long.
I love it!!!\nClean and great service.\nFood delicious and very fast service\nI ordered cal do de res it was delicious!!
Today I went to eat lunch and I liked the food but what I liked most was the service I received. The chimichanga was delicious.
I was in there this morning and the girls were very friendly! I spilt my smoothie all over and unfortunately didnt have time to wait for another one. But the other girl had already made me another one! \nI left a happy customer! :D
I sought out Jamba Juice their highlighted drink with the giant picture- that's what I wanted. But they were missing two of the four ingredients! I'll never go back there again
I'm on the phone with Linda right now, I called them just in case to let them know the situation after I got the news from the other plumber. and she says that she's doing everything she can make the situation right. I will keep this updated.
I waited 15 min to be helped.when I was assisted the rep seemed nice.My upset sits with the store they needed a older connection to transfer contacts from one phone to another.But the one and only transfer connection was broken.this was my experience your might be a bit better.
This store is always too busy. Be sure to bring your favorite pillow because it will be a  hour before someone can help you.
They probably only get my order right half of the time but they are so friendly and makes up for it and that is why I keep coming back.
Breakfast with Rob,  The food is good.  I had eggs, bacon and pancakes.  Not my favorite pancakes, but ok.  Love their sausage gravy however.
A group of my coworkers and I go here every other week for lunch. FYI the blackberry lemonade is to diiiiie for- I order it every time we go. They have delicious healthy options to eat as well! Something for everyone
Beat body shop in town joe is the best!!\nHe does a great job on matching exotic paint
We were so very happy with the service here I would have no problem recommending Classic Gold to anyone needing auto body work done.  It's like it never even happened.   Thanks again!!
Average customer service,  average sandwich making skills, average speed. Hence average rating.
Love this dentist's office! They are all super friendly and Dr. Carson is very professional. Would definitely recommend!
Thorough workouts, every session is different, plenty of encouragement and positive attitude!
Pizza is ok for a quick bite but the service is very slow.
Everyone is very friendly & welcoming and they don't try to \"upsell\" you as much as some other places.  They always give me a bottle of water too, which is a nice touch.  Will continue coming here for sure.
Been going here for years. A great place!
No rating (just putting that in theater 12 there is a speaker in the front right that may be damaged. I heard a crack sound ((a sound a speaker makes when damaged))\n\nOtherwise a fun movie experience. \n\nCheers
Stay away from this cleaning company.........After confirming appointment, they suddenly cancel your appointment a day before and never give you a other cleaning date for the next two months.I will never buy their coupon from groupon anymore.
Great place. BUT horrible service. Although it was a game day Sunday and it was full they only came by 2times to check if we were ok and needed something and every time we asked for something we got a different server!!!
We received a full confirmation for a vehicle at their Glendale location and am now finding out they don't have a car available but found one 20 miles away at double the cost we were quoted!
Food is still good. However, the service sucks. We went there about one hour before closing. The waitress was trying to rush us out so that she could go clubbing.\n\nNot thinking about going back there unless it got a new waitress.
My mom was visiting and wanted a haircut.  She went to Eva and got the best cut I have ever seen on her. She has been getting tons of compliments on her new style. I guess now she'll have to come down and visit more often.
Time to sweat! This place is hit or miss but I can't judge yet bcuz we still have the New Years Resolution Crowd in attendance! :)
Staff nice, but forgetful. The food was cold and bland. Wish I had checked them out here first. No wonder no one was in there.
I like this a lot better than any of the other take out pizza in the area. This is a quick and tasty Sunday night dinner.
lousy!  rude but most importantly she butchered my pants!  DO NOT USE
I eat here all the time you get alot of food for a good price. The teriyaki chicken is very good. There macaroni salad is the best I've tasted out of the few island places I've had in the area. The crab puffs are also very good.
Way too over priced. I mean its great food. With an average sized portion. But for how much I'm paying?... Not totally worth it!
The tamales here are the best! I love the green chile chicken ones and usually have to get at least one every week. They are so good my boyfriend in Washington is having me send some up.
Great little restaurant. Family owned - I think? Probably the best tamales I've had. I always try to support small and local. You won't be disappointed.
One of the best Dairy Queens I've been to.  Very clean,   friendly staff. ... We had Pumpkin pie blizzards.  Yum!
I got a hair cut and loved it, however, I was not crazy about the salon. A little too modern for me.\nSeems like a good place if you like trendy hair cuts and color.
I'm a fan of the glaze!
Yuck. How can any Mexican joint have absolutely no flavor in their meat? I really wanted to like this since it's close by and I'm all about 24 hour fast food! Bummer.
Great pizza.  Nice owners!
Fyi, the drive thru closes at 10p, apparently.  Not sure if they serve walk-ins, but the sticker on the window said they close at 10p on Friday.  Bummer.  Tempe needs more 24 hr drive thrus!
We went drive through and the cashier was extremely lazy. We asked for a medicine and she said \" we sell that upfront \"
Good wait staff. They have a nice white egg om-let. French toast and pancakes tasty.  This place is very close to the University, and within a mile of several hotels.
Very expensive. Unfriendly staff. Why can't you just sell me what I need. I should have known better when no other customers where there. Avoid this place there are many other affordable places to take your vehicle to.
Waited forever in drive thru to finally get my order that was wrong. I could here the employees inside complaining about the lines and really didn't want to be at work. Once home the sides were cold and coleslaw tasted spoiled. Will NOT return
The General Tso's chicken lacked crispiness and flavor with a heat index of pre school. I had the Garlic chicken on a previous visit, and it was pretty tasty.
Terrific food!  Great drinks.  Usually very busy but will worth the wait!  Nice place white table cloths even!
This walmart never seems to have anything. When I go to other walmarts I am surprised by all the things they offer. It is very clean and friendly staff.
Not in the best part of town, especially right now with lightrail construction but it works. This store has just about everything you can ask for or need.
This frys holds the biggest award for trash. Trashy ghetto customer, trashy customer service and lazy ass people. This store should be burned to the ground with everyone in it.
I wish there was less than 1 star because now that they don't have flour chips there is no point..... It is just another Mexican restaurant :-( Super bummer.
Food is ok. Service is ok. Crab legs are just the same with crazy buffet. Dinner at 16/head adult. Quite pricey.
Very sad food quality here.  The yoshi in central Phoenix is phenomenal, but this airport location is nor worth anyone's time.
Most people seem to like it but not me.  It was not bad, just did not seem that special to me.
The food is just okay. I have had better. Service is slow.
Very, very, happy with Integrity Auto Glass. I called them and they got my insurance on the line and my windshield was replaced  within 48 hours. Very professional service from the installer Steve. Highly recommend
This is a great clothing store. Trendy, and affordable. This is the kind of place you stop by on a friday afterwork to get your outfits for whatever you got going on that weekend. Lots of cute accessories too. I've never come here & left empty handed.
Bland breakfast burrito. Needs some salt. Yes the hot sauce is spicy but taste shouldn't be just about \"how hot\" the salsa is. I'll try it another day and update my review.
I have now attempted to remove myself from your emailing list at LEAST 4 times and you keep spamming my inbox. \nDO NOT SIGN UP FOR THEIR EMAIL!  Ugh.
Love the food.  Always clean and for the most part has friendly service. The music is strangely weird at times and much too loud.
Great car wash. Perfect location along with there other locations valleywide. Great prices for excellent washes. Only place i go customer servie is outstanding and courteous. 2 thumbs up all around
Just ok. I got the food to go and I thought it was very over priced for what we got. Don't think I'll go back. :(
Excellent place to grab a bagel and cup of coffee. I have been going there for years. It is a pleasure to be greeted by name. Keep up the Great job.
We caught quite a few fish, but the guide was pretty rude and full of himself.   Acted like it was a privilege for us to be fishing with him.\nWon't be going back.   Don't need an attitude on what should be a relaxing fish trip.
It's quite simple. The food is great! The service is slow! And 98.9% of the time they will get your order wrong!
Great take out and I finally went to the restaurant to pick up my order and the place is really nice.  We'll have to try dining in some time too
Picked up early morning to go to the airport from a hotel. Paid $15. Ordinary taxi service.
I will only get my haircut here from now on. Great customer service. It may take some extra time because they are students. I like supporting the education process.
Forever boycotting this location. Franchise-owned, doesn't accept the CBTL app rewards, doesn't brew flavored coffee after 11am, and doesn't carry quiche anymore. After several bad experiences at this location, I'll never return.
I tried a slice of lemon cake; it tasted very artificial...kind of pinesol-ish. Definitely not homemade. I also tried a few cookies that were OK, nothing to get too excited about.
Absolutely the worst customer service you can imagine.  The only thing keeping Verizon in business is the good coverage and over-priced calling plans.
Terrible prices and service.  Their yorkies start at 3k.  They are out of their mind.
Roomy, modern rooms and fun pool and hot tub. Great alternative to smoky old strip hotels. Moderately price.
Don't count on a roll-away for your family. They have a self imposed policy of 2 beds to a room and will not change no matter the circumstances, expectations, or that they advertise roll-aways available.
Don't go here for food unless you want to wait in lines forever.  Every restaurant or deli has the longest and slowest functioning lines.
I just checked in a a couple of hours and i want to check out. Im used to customer service and from the bell stand, front desk and housekeeping its the worse...smh...
I came back and Doreen helped us at the bar. She was great! She made conversation and encouraged me to try the siracha wings which were AMAZING!
High prices, bad neighbourhood. Food tastes good. But with the money i spent, could of want to the buffet instead....
Beautiful decor! They gave us some free champagne since were there for our honeymoon. The tasting menu is very decadent, with caviar and truffles. If you like sushi, this is the place to go.
Roku is to sushi as \"The Golden Child\" is to Eddie Murphy movies -- far closer to the bottom than the top.\nRoll selection was weak, and construction was worse. Having said that, their crab dynamite was delicious.
Thought the place was decent. Liked the Shima roll. Everything else was good. But did not have the WOW factor working for them
Fun sushi spot I try to hit everytime I'm in Vegas.  If you like sushi give this place a try.
Excellent. Staff, food, service, quality, freshness delish. Excellent prices.
great sushi. Fresh fish. Their toro was particularly good. Did not like their hanabi. Everything else tasted amazing.
This place sucks...... no seafood..... service is not great and people are not too friendly.after asking the waiter if they offered any seafood at all he just replied with\" you have the menu,read it,I will be back\"
Couldn't get help to try on shoes (that I would have bought) but they have more than one person greeting at the door.  Great!  No service here, although the selection isn't so bad.
I regret coming to this place!!!  The first thing they asked is do you have insurance?  No hi hello or how can we help or how are you doing??  This is the worst place for urgent care!!!! I give this place a negative 5 rating!
Was waiting their with my boyfriend for almost 10 minutes until we got seated. The place was empty the hostess didn't even bring me a menu. We just walked out worst ihop ever.
Friendly staff, clean bathroom, ATM worked, cheap drinks in comparison to other places in the area.  I'll be back often...
Awesome place. Large selection in golf clubs and tennis gear. Pretty good deals that I liked. Bill stauffer helped me and he was very knowledgable. You can get custom fitted for your clubs and they will order them for you. Very friendly and professional place.
When scheduling for your cleaning, ask for Miss Julia.... She's great!
SAGE IS  NOW UNDER NEW MANAGEMENT!! Food portions are small and prices have gone up!
Filthy line. You would think they would be more concerned with the appearance of the kitchen(line) sense it is visible. Its makes you question the sanitation. I won't be coming back.
The service was extremely unprofessional and our order was missing several items. The food quality was still good, but no one seemed to know what they were doing.
They were great. Synthetic oil change the cheapest I've seen in town. Their alignment machine was occupied so instead of holding my car hostage and trapping me, they did the paperwork and payment for the oil change and said they'd call when it was open.
I get my car washed here and really like the service and especially the professionalism of assistant manager Michael Jorgensen.  He is polite, articulate and has the energy and drive to move forward in his life.  I always enjoy our brief chats!
Loved the warm garlic bread with Gorgonzola fondue, yummy! \nTheir porterhouse with baked/mashed potatoes was the bomb!\n\nAlthough it is pricey the food is excellent.
Great meal!!!! Started with the seafood plateau and finished with the filet. They nailed it!
rubio's is amazing.  their fish tacos were so delicious.  i almost couldn't believe they were from a chain.
Their food is fine. Their prices are too high for what you get. I won't go out of my way to eat there but if I'll be in the neighborhood and  have the craving for this kind of food, I'll eat there again.
Tina Marie is amazing! She was so helpful and I really enjoyed my shopping experience with her. She was very thorough and explained everything to me along each step of the process. I can't wait to get my new glasses.
Excellent service. No problems. Free upgrade and one of the sales associates took me home when she got off work.  If I need to rent another car, I will definitely come here again.
don't go there, the most horrible experience ever. they altered my jeans to the point that i cannot wear it or return them. they were very rude and when i asked for my money back i didn't got the full price i paid. and the money was thrown to me.
You may think otherwise, but I actually have a limit for enjoying things ironically. And this is pretty much it.
You never know what you will see on Fremont st. The place for a cheep show from the man in the box to the guy painting with spray paint to the guy doing clay sculpture while you wait also you may see jesus. The light show if pretty cool to.
This place is ghetto nothing good to see my bf n I even took off our watches n rings we felt we could of been robbed ., Las Vegas blvd way better
A walk on the LV feral side! Come here for Excellent people watching,  quality look alike street performers, amazing overhead TV/Projection/Light effects, live stage performances, and even zip-lining!
They have gone severely down hill. Have gone here for a couple years for close by chinese. I wouldn't go back.
I love this place too, I also want to support them.  Best service and delicious food
Beef and broccoli was tough and chewy, broccoli was hard and undercooked. Fried rice was bland and boiled. Not great, won't be back.
Their drive through is hit or miss....sometimes it's super long and other times it's crazy fast.  You just never know. \nBut the coffee is consistent and the staff is friendly.
Inexpensive. Some good deals. Lots of regulars. Friendly family owned.
Fabulous store layout and design. Beautiful merchandise.  Enjoy stopping by after lunch in the Forum Shoppes to drool! Great sales every now and then for all you locals who can stop by whenever.  Make friends with an employee and you'll be good to go!
Best donuts ever!
I'm ordering from Linos on Graig all the time. Jammy always really nice to me! Delivery is really fast and food is fresh out of oven! I'm waiting for my ultimate seafood right now!
There are better car insurance companies.  I had Geico for a long time, but when you need them, they don't care about you at all.  Too big a company, and uncaring.
Messed up my order not once but twice. Food was decent but I probably won't be coming back
Wanted to start off day with a good meal, dropped by del taco never at breakfast here before. The food was fresh the service amazing. Thanks del taco for making me full and happy and ready to start day.
Love the food and staff, only thing is the food can be a bit pricey at times for a pub.
Was there on Sunday afternoon with my wife. Maybe 5 customers in the place, but the service from the bartender was absolutely nonexistent. Will never go back!
Very dark on the inside spinach dip was to damn parmesan...my sandwich u did had to much cheese it was nasty .. Curly fries were good
I was there last week having them check my car battery. Corry was there helping me to check the battery. He was very helpful and  honest. He helped me changed the battery and declined to accept a tip saying that he was glad that he could help me, and that was part of  his job.
It's Subway...tastes the same everywhere you go...at least this place is next to my gym and they get you in and out really quick! nuff said!
Sold me an Air Filter for $38.54. I said it's too expensive. Answer: It is a great price, filters are so expensive. I'm look today in the Internet. $10.36. It's a scam!!!
I stopped in the Albertson's on my way home because of a sale on Coke.  The store was clean and bright, and the clerk who checked me out couldn't have been friendlier.  Parking is OK here and it's easy off and back on Flamingo.
The best place in town for a girls day! Love the hot stone, n the citrus scrub, we usually go with at least 3 gals. N we all get in and out together. Lotsa choices in colors n styles.
Sign says open 24/7, not true!! Went there at 2:30 am and it was closed!! We were pretty annoyed at this.
As of 11/03/13 they appear to be closed by order of the courts and there is a for lease sign in the window.
These mother fuckers hit an ran my car! Eye witness took down their cab number and license plate. Your busted!
Taxi driver stole iphone 5. Stay away from this company!!!
Seemed like a good place to eat a first but as a first timer it's so confusing which side to order from. Just wanted a Caesar wrap and had to wait longer to order it from the \"hot\" side. I'll just go to subway thanks.
I've used Dr. C for several years. He is calm, and fast.  A great dentist. Cleanings are great. Staff is very pleasant. Can't go wrong if you are looking for a competent, relaxed dentist who knows your mouth :)
Their $9 exterior car wash was fantastic.  The exterior of my car was really clean, cleaner than the brush car washes, and since it's a hand wash, better for the paint on my car.  A+
Don't do it. Go to the place around the corner. This place sucks
Item are cleaned and ready as scheduled, they offer inexpensive but quality work, and decent hours of operations.\n\nNote, there is a drive through for those of you with children!
I love Sterling [PERIOD]. I do think, however, the bagels, at $0.95, are a bit pricey, but they are great...not NY, but as close as you can get
Solid kabob place. Absolutely zero decor in the place, but it's huge an cheap, which is great for big parties.
I've been here twice and the food is great! But what makes this place even better is the service. They go above and beyond and just make the overall environment and experience delightful! Very clean restaurant, friendly staff and great food. This one is great to revisit.
Great portions, good prices and excellent service. The ambience is friendly and the music is relaxing. Great place to go on a date or with family. We come every time we are in Vegas!
The service sucks. The entrances are weird and confusing. Employees look angry and unapproachable. They do make good hummus, pitas are dry thoughbut my husband and I would rather go elsewhere.
Very nice ambiance and service is really nice. The food pretty normal although I think their babaganoush is perfect here. Not overly tangy and the meats are cooked perfectly.
Best gyro we ever had! Worth the drive!
Decent course for the $45 off season price. Greens were in terrible shape but I'm told they are better during the summer. Be sure to practice good \"etiqueccy\" here and watch out for the Dbag wearing all black.
Well I didn't get sick and die, that counts for something these days!
the service is either hit or miss
With over 200 different major stores they have great dining a huge outdoor mega screen and lots of events including daily fashion shows.
Its one of the larger more traditional big city type malls in Vegas. Lots of department stores and tons of stores. Nothing too fantastic but it is worth checking out if you are looking for the normal shopping in Vegas.
Great mall. Need more elevators, more restrooms and what the hell, says you open at 10:00 am but the stores aren't even open yet. \n\nThis mall needs to get it together.
Great service!  Food tasted great too.
Val was very helpful and knowledgeable about the products. She helped me with a sim card issue and didn't even charge me, so I bought a stock charger for a great price. Will buy from again and refer my friends and family.
Mojitos.  Enough said.
Nice selection of cigars and a sophisticated, wide ranging bar and cocktail menu. Mojitos are very authentic.\nOdd comment for a cigar bar but we found it a little too smoky late at night.
Dr.spellman is great. I felt no pain during a filing and felt very comfortable. I'm not a fan of dentists, but he made me feel comfortable.
Food here is satisfactory. It's not going to blow your mind. I generally order the California burrito and it's good. But if your looking for something authentic look elsewhere. However, it does the job if your looking for something cheap and filling.
After trying the sundance special for the very first time, I try so hard to try other items on the menu but I seem to always revert back to my Sundance Special! Love the potatoes and banana nut muffin with my breakfast!
This place is amazing!  The bacon mashed potato omelet is a must.  The wait staff is friendly and attentive.
Good food. \nFast service. \nWell priced. \nTenikia, our server, was super friendly and nice.
It's 106 degrees outside and 90 plus inside the restaurant !!! Asked if the AC was on. Oh yes she would check??  It's 90 plus. AC is not working!!! Daaahh
Customer service here is terrible!  The teenage Asian girl there never has a clue to anything. Please hire someone with more common sense and a better personality and maybe you'll have more happy customers
Over priced. Grumpy driver. I could get 2 subs at Jimmy Johns for the price they charged me. The dessert (Cheese cake) sub parr...thick bread, hardly any meat. I do not recommend it.
Love it!  I like that they do half sushi rolls!  The best rolls are the ocean roll, sexy roll and first kiss!  And their ice cream in your mouth is a very neat dessert roll!  Their AYCE price cannot be beat it includes Everything on their menu!
The worst BBQ ever seen. Servers are fine but the best rice is really really extremely expensive. Specialty the Beef Stew. Don't ever come here.
Over-burned rockhard rice in their dolsot bibimbap almost broke my teeth. Terrible dining experience here.
Me and my friends chill here twice a week. Nader is the best bartender around. Great music, lots of tv's, and great food. I LOVE this place
The place is hit or miss depending on which bartender you get.  They have some really good ones, but they also have at least 1 really bad one.  I won't name names but I wouldn't recommend the place on certain nights of the week.
Good variety, really good prizes, service could be better. Sales people are really not interested in helping you find the right jeans model but are at least smiling..
If you like waiting then this is the company for you.  The people are fine but forget about punctuality, it's not here.  Take a cab and save some time.
Spend a little more and take a taxi. Just rude. Tried to tell us that even though we paid for hotel pick up that we had to walk 3 hotels away. We knew more about the events going on than they did. No accountability.
Never again! If you're trying to reschedule a hotel pick up, you're wasting your time and your money. Customer service sucks. You would do better to take the public bus system. Not only is it easier and more direct, it's a lot more inexpensive.
Holy Moses!!!! Best chicken cheesesteak I've ever had!!! I highly recommend this place.
Cobra Kai Is the best gym I ever went to!! sim is the best jiujitsu coach in the world I recommend this gym
The food is cook fresh and it taste delicious. The prices are really reasonable.
Worst service of my life. Slow service. Wasn't busy at all. Got cold bread around the same time my pizza came out. Save your money and go elsewhere.
Always love going to CPK. There three of us. The salad and spaghetti was excellent. Took awhile to get served, bread and a waitress. She was looking right through me as I recited my order, was slow and just not interested. I'd still go back though.
Nice prices... Horrible customer service... I'll only be back because they have really cute stuff...
This place is off the strip so the prices are better here.  Has everything you need to take to the hotel.  Local types here and friendly service.  Not a lot of transients hanging around like other places in the area.
The ultimately slowest sbux EVER!!!!!!!they seem to have plenty of employees but the speed just isn't there! Isn't Starbucks supposed to be convenient ?
Was not thrilled by the massage or the way that they try to railroad you into a contract. I did not like either one ... They pretend to be the premier place to go but truthfully they are subpar.....   I viewed them as used car salesmen....
Great place!! I love my nails and toes!! Will come back again!! Prices are reasonable and everyone is friendly and courteous!!
I love Outback, the steaks are great and a lot less pricey then the hotel steakhouses.  The wait staff, hostesses and management are awesome.
I went in for and met the Dr. very, very briefly. We decided not to do anything. I still got a bill. I don't recommend going here.
Had a mole removed over a month ago and have yet to hear from them with the results.
Every time I have used desert taxi, they have been so nice on the phone when I order a taxi, and the driver has always showed up early. In fact, If I wasn't ready, they always said, take your time.
Terrible service. They were rude over the intercom, didn't listen and hung up on us before we were finished. Never had such a hard time at a drive through. The food was ok, but just average. Most likely not returning.
Great apps! Elham is a fantastic server, ask for her if you go, but you shouldn't everything else was horrible! Just go next store to DW bistro instead!
Was close by for a doctor's appointment and yelp introduced me to this place & I fell in love with the place. Exceptional food and service, one of the best meals I have ever had in my life.
This place has some if the best Italian food I've ever had. Our waitress was terrific, the drinks were delicious, the food was phenomenal, and the view isn't so bad either!
The bread is the only thing delicious here. Service was poor,, Cesar Salad taste rotten!! Fettuccine chicken was bland!
It was a little disorganized, the staff was super friendly though. The lady that checked me out was efficiently quick and cheerful. The sales were great today as well.
Owner is a profit driven douchebag hey nothing wrong with hustling but he hustles in a rude thoughtless way..asked him to start carrying \" sage\" incents every time I go in and he refuses to even acknowledge the request..
Fast & Good!
Needed to have my phone repaired today...checked in at 3:30...wasn't helped until 5:03.  This is the same case scenario everytime I have to go in...which is a lot because my phone blows!!!  :/
Went because friends that were in town wanted to see him and he was great!  Loved the finale.  Worth the $$$$.  Just DON'T stay at Luxor.
A show you can count on for some great laughs.  Carrot Top has tons of funny props and sound effects.  I would recommend it.
I didn't think I liked Carrot Top, but after seeing great reviews decided to see his show.  I am so glad I did!  It was hilarious.  A must see in Vegas!
Great show. Half the cost of other shows and as most reviews have already said. \nDo it!!!!! Not a bad seat in the house is also true. Perfect view as rows are low enough\nthat your not looking at the back of someone's head.
We had the best Thanksgiving dinner at Arizona Charlie's buffet!  Fabulous stuffing, real mashed potatoe, great desserts!  No mess to clean up at home!  Thank you for working on this holiday and for making such good food!
They need to hire a receptionist who is willing to give business to their salon and stylist. I just got off the phone with THE WORST receptionist of all time who had no clue on how to run a salon. talking my business elsewhere.
Walked in at 1:15am August 10, 2014 & walked out 1:30.. A waitress touched pancakes with her dirty ass hands after she rang up seven people at the cash register . & serve the pancakes cold as well.
Agree with all previous reviews. This company is one of the worst I have ever dealt with...period. It was literally so bad I felt like I was on some blooper punked show. Avoid them or suffer.
APM is a complete joke!  Don't waste your time listing your investment property with them-I will let the countless horrible reviews speak for themselves and not waste my time writing all the garbage I want to write about them.
I wish I  could give it less.  They used to be good.  The owner was a jerk on the phone.
Ridiculous prices.  Not all that tasty.  Not for down-to-earth types.
A LOVELY BUNCH OF BONES comes with each choco box during hawlowene. if chocolate could talk it would saw buauahahaha spooooky.
Sooo good! Great price, good portions! This may be my favorite place for hearty meals! Such good hearty food choices, I actually thought this was a mexican restaurant, i'm not disappointed it wasn't. Yummy!
Way way way too expensive for the products being offered!  There are other locations around town with much much better deals.\nHowever, it does have shelf after shelf of items to look at as you walk through. It borders on sensory overload.
The employees are SOOO rude here. I asked for a chocolate milkshake and the response I got was \"no chocolate shake.\" That's not even a complete sentence....and they want to make $15/hr. Ridiculous!
It's a fun bar with great food and a good atmosphere.   Awesome TV's.  Great place for a pit stop or a party. :)
Try the Pan fried dumplings!
Worst service ever!! dispatchers are rude and cabs have a tendency to \"no show\"
Not sure why this place gets such great reviews. The service was good but the food just ok and the location/atmosphere ok.\nI found the price very expensive as well.\nNot worth it.
In heaven every time I step foot in this restaurant. I can't say enough about Joe's Seafood and I can't think of one entree that I haven't loved! Great lunch menu as well and the seafood salad is to die for!
Very fair.  Went with waiter's recs & shouldn't have. Joe's in Florida so much better.
Some good rolls, a lot of choice!!!  i'll go again for sure... ;)
Pricey but hey..it's Vegas.\nGreat drinks - they're strong and yummy!\nGood selection of songs and nice variety. \nLove the view!!!\n\nPS Check out the bathroom ;)
Bar is amazing.  The Restaurant was sub par for the prices.  I ordered the peppercorn filet and it was encrusted with WHOLE peppercorns which made it inedible.  It should have been stellar for that price point.
The food was great. The view is phenomenal
I just came here for the view but it made enough of an impression that I'd love to come back fro drinks and food. The view is amazing. On par with Ghostbar. Good music, sexy vibe.
We have been here 3 times, and the service has been bad every time. The view is AMAZING, but because of the poor service we will not return.
This is by far and away the finest Greek food I have ever had!  Thank God I found this place as I will be eating there often.  Fantastic flavors, portions were plentiful and the service was wonderful.
I have been coming here for several years and have always had a good experience. This is a family owned business and they all work very hard to make it a great place.
This place is great!  Great food and a great value!  The gyro and chicken plate are out of this world!
Update: the remodel makes this fast food place a much hipper experience. The play area is the same but theres a different seating setup. They also have tvs now. 4 stars.
Customer service is very bad. I wanted to return dog toy which is I never opened  they were so lazy to do it .... I gauss they were mad to me. I don't know...
Rude, that's all i have to stay about the staff and service at this branch.
This location closes early, and on the night I visited they were closed before their posted time.
Here at fantastic sams kids are getting there haircuts for the first time here no waiting just walked right in friendly staff I will come again.
Generally quiet \nComfortable bed\nRenovations needed\nLackluster breakfast\nGreat service very friendly
Restaurant was open but there was no server to be found. So we just walk out and went somewhere else.
Bad Service at the desk.
Picked up a car was fine but I reserved a car to return at different station. All information I received was wrong, I called call center and they gave me wrong info. The number they gave me was useless because takes forever to get LIVE person.
This location is one of the worst! All the way from managment down, they nickel and dime me all the way!  I recommend avoiding this hertz location
It's McDonalds, not a class establishment to begin with. This one was a little dirty and not efficient with it's service. Waited a very long time for food during a not so busy time.
I ate here on dec 12 2013 and got FOOD POISONING . I was sick for 2 days . Friendly service and good sandwiches do not make up for serving bad product to guests.
I reserved a non smoking room and they messed up with that , I ended up getting a smoking room and that was so gross!!!!
I love starbucks and i love coffee but here my caramel macchiato shot was burnt and bitter the two times I have been here. So far the only Starbucks that screwed up my drink. I rather just go down the road and find another one a few blocks away.
We're here because pictures on yelp looked amazing but going in person was a whole other experience. Service was bad and fish was not fresh. would never go again
If you are desperate and have no where else to turn. This come close to Chinese food. I suggest going 2 China One in the Smith shipping center. Way better food for similar prices. Actually I am holding back a bit. Call me a snob but Panda is horrible.
Worst nail salon in Summerlin. Do not go here. They will tell you they can do what you want and then they don't do it and try to charge your more than quoted. This place is a joke.
Justin is awesome! Very attentive and professional. He has the right staff and his happy hour is phenomenal. This is my first time here and I will definitely come back. Try the soju cocktails, they are to die for.
Wow talk about a good way to go....heart attack in a box for sure but it's soooo good.  If you blink you'll drive right by it.  Patty melt was great, can't wait to try the burgers!
Not bad prices are ok as well:)
Good, quick classic Mexican food!\nNothing fancy, but very tasty.
A fun stop on a Vegas excursion.  Staff was friendly and patient with a group of newbs.  I chose the glock, tommy gun, and desert eagle 50 cal.  Desert eagle is a monster.  A worthwhile stop when you're in vegas.
Drive thru is super slow. No one in front of us had an order more than 2 drinks. They need to get it together. Go to the Starbucks down the street inside the smiths on windmill and rainbow.
Go to other Radio Shack! This Radio Shack its ok but other ones are better.
Poor customer service they completely suck they ruin your drinks and ruin your experience of going to Starbucks.
Paid for a venti green tea lemonade and got a tall green tea lemonade . Reason why I didn't go back was because I had to go to school was in a rush I wish the girls that always take my orders were there
Um scary...I live really close and only venture in for emergency sports bets..Super smokey and crap food. Skip it and drive to Aliante if in the area.
Wasn't impressed sorry delivery was timely delivery guy was very nice but food wasn't good
This place isn't all that. Maybe its cause I went in there to early in the day.  Didn't really look like a great place to party or waste a lot of time in. Although it did have a nice Irish look. But I still won't go back.
I'm not a big club person, so I heard there was an Irish pub in Vegas, I was there on my first night. Good selection of Irish beer. We had HUGE chicken pot pies served in a pail. Soooo good.
Nice Irish bar but crazy expensive. Worth a visit for a beer and then punch out. They usually have decent live music.
The names of the dishes and looks may fool you but there is no meat here which is great if your a true vegan or vegetarian. I also love the Taro slush I get one every time with no Boba. Vegan style uses Soy milk.
I love this place. When I first moved to Las Vegas it was one of the only places I knew of to get vegan food. Took my son back today and he went crazy for his chicken sandwich and banana slush. Still as great as I remember.
I don't typically eat here but my wife likes the slushies they offer.
My husband recieved an mildewed potato. We told the staff. The manager was no where to be found! be CAREFUL!!!!! EEEKKKKK!!!! :-(
I had a super rude cashier made a huge fuss over a exchange of a broken item. I would have bought but because of her rudeness I did my exchange and left I didn't get her name but on my receipt it says cashier 1271421
Food is too expensive. The quality is too cheap and poorly prepared to justify the outrageous prices. The staff will likely ignore you until they feel like doing their jobs. The worst Panda Express I've ever been to.
Food is great but terrible service.
Worst Chinese Chicken Salad I ever had! It had 3 small pieces of chicken and was more like a garden salad! Will never go back!
Great sandwiches and great service.  But what's with the no restroom policy?  Isn't it a requirement that a restaurant have a public restroom?  The hand sanitizer thing hanging by the register isn't cutting it folks.
A bit pricey but the subs are so delicious it is hard to resist. I wouldn't say we are regulars but we return every once in awhile.
I love Capriotti's... Just not this location. Dirty restaurant and employees that looked like they were hired right out of a homeless shelter.
I only get the carmel flan...they hit the spot but I've had better...for the $2 price, you can't go wrong with that.
Dr. Camp is unprofessional, money-hungry and does not care about patients or their conditions.
Seems from the reviews that more than my mother-in-law have been screwed over by this location and false reports of damage. I would steer clear or take pictures of every inch of the car, before and after renting.
My husband and I had a bad experience renting a car in La Vegas. They tried to charge us for gas even though we filled up before we returned the car.  We had a receipt so we were able to get it removed. Why should we have to go through the hassle.
Scam. For profit, non accredited scam school. You are better off spending $90.000.00 on mega bucks.
It's for profit University that only graduates 25% UNLV is at 40% Nothing about this place says it anything more scam to line some else pockets.
The service department is a joke do not take your Land Rovers here.
Negative. Food was totally bland until i ate a retadro pepper that burned my tongue so i couldn't tell it was tasteless. Decent delivery time but yea, no.
Yuck! Everything I ordered tasted gross :( I've been here often years before and this was my first time back in over 2 years. I didn't complain. I sucked it up, paid the bill and will never be back. Only good thing about the place- cheap beer.
Mikkie Finnz's sister bar next door. The food is almost as horrible.  The fish and chips suck and so does the whole menu. DO not eat here.
Loved the shepherd's pie.  Waitress was good and attentive.  I love Irish bars.  I think it's best place I have gone to for a place on Fremont Street.
Average burger , salad, beer/bar joint.
We love this place. It is like PF Chang's but less expensive. It is casual dining. Great service and I love that you can see into the kitchen. Get the Pei Wei Card if you go often. You can earn a free entree. Easy take-out too.
I waited forever for our food and it was just two of us. The entrees were incredibly bland. I will probably not return\n\nNice atmosphere though.
Couldn't tell the difference between the orange and the Kung Pau Chicken. The fried rice was mushy.\n\nWon't be going back.
Their service has improved tremendously and the staff is very upbeat and proactive.
Dr. Nathan Blanton was the reason I used to go to this location of Mountain West Chiropractic. Since Dr. Blanton is no longer practicing at this office, I stopped receiving treatment here.  I have now have no idea of the quality of treatment this office now provides.
Had one great experience, one terrible and a lot of so so in between. It would help if they didn't  change the entire staff every week.
I will not stay there again.  The train is a deal breaker for me.  The rooms are really nice and the staff is friendly and professional.
Ordered for delivery here because I was at the TownePlace Suites nearby.  Lots of food and the sushi was awesome.  Delivered in less than 30 min on a sat night.
So we arrived there for dinner yesterday after spotting it last week leaving walgreens . Dining room was empty and not one clean table available . Place was dirty so we can only imagine what the kitchen looks like . With that in mind we left and don't plan on ever going back .
The service was excellent.  It was very busy so we opted to sit outside. It's byob so that was disappointing. The food was ok. It was certainly edible and the presentation was nice. It just wasn't awesome.
Decent grub, although the grape leaves sucked and the service, while quick, was RUDE. No atmosphere. Much better Med food in the 'burgh.
1 week after being charged the $25 no refund.  We called back today and a \"manager\" will need to call us back.  If that manager doesn't call back today and handle it then we'll have to file a fraudulent charge with our bank against the bar.
Cool spot sitting right above the water outside people watching. Seafood tasted frozed and not fresh never a good look for a seafood spot. Bikers were in the way of the service staff slowed service down a lot. Might return for lunch
Billy's ultimate steam pot and oysters are great. It sits right by the water too.
Nice Location.  Utterly forgettable food.  Insanely slow service.  The place was slow and the waiters just could not have cared less about our group.  Sort of unreal.
Cute place. The service was very good, really nice friendly waitress. The food was good. I had fish tacos, they were tasty. My husband's ribs were very good. My daughter tried the buffalo chicken salad and she really liked it. I would absolutely go here again.
They need to find a better way of washing dishes. Our coffee cups had stains all over, cutlery had pieces of food and had egg smell all over.
This is a great place to grab lunch! They have great soups and sandwich combos and its got a great vibe inside! Love it and will go back soon.
The location is nice and the food is delicious! I got the market fish, which was very good. The meat was so tender. Other yummy dishes were duck and pork.
Good food, service , in a cozy atmosphere.
You can't beat an $8 Indian lunch buffet. However only one of the dishes on the buffet has any meat and it was some overcooked chicken. Besides that the mushrooms were excellent and the staff was friendly. I'll definitely be stopping in again someday.
I went to the new location awhile back and it is okay.  If you like bbq then this place has to be on your list to try in Las Vegas.
Like Denny's, but more overpriced. I enjoyed my carrot apple bundt-shaped muffin and had a nice waitress. No ambiance to speak of, unless Denny's is your game.
Good stuff! Much needed on a hot day!
OK for a Starbucks. It's very busy, which makes it noisy and the staff hurried. The furniture, especially the armchairs, are comfortable and a decent place ti sit and read.
DELICIOIUS!\n\nAnd they even have chopped fresh wasabi.   \n\nI got a roll and a bunch of nigiri, and everything was awesome.\n\nLoves it.
Nice hotel for young people bad experience, dealers were rude made sexual comments about my wife, the operator when i called wouldnt look up my reservation, the food at koi was a joke, Worst Hotel I have stayed in and I go to vegas a lot, dont waste your money
Very poor service it took 6 hours for them to clean up my room. 3 calls and a conversation with the manager ended with him telling me just had to wait and then he insulted me. Will not stay here again
The hotel rooms and hallways are dark and depressing.  Even the elevators are dark and depressing.  The casino is great though. The buffet is awesome.  I think I will stay at the Paris and walk over to gamble and eat at the buffet.
The rooms are so gross and dirty.  I got a skin infection from it.  Really needs updating a  good cleaning.  Very outdated.  Difficult to find anything in the hotel (mainly the gym).  Stay elsewhere.
First time in Vegas and I stayed here. Decent room loved the set up of the gambling floor. Awesome restaurants and friendly staff. I would come here again.
If you are on a salt restricted diet, don't eat here! Everything is over salted and some is actually so salty it is inedible!!!
Must support this shop and stop by whenever i get in town.  Very dope selection with a lot of hype kicks and gear.  I appreciate the staff for being chill and not bothering  when trying to browse.  Get some kicks and   rock'em right,
King crab legs were great but the place leaves you smelling so bad that its not worth it.
The food is wonderful,  the inside is nice, and the service was just okay. Asked for a to go cup for my daughter's thai tea and ended up having to ask another server.
Rachel's Kitchen is a great place to go for lunch. Really small, but nice and quaint.  Great sandwiches, salads, and breakfasts. Pretty healthy too.
Went to a game. It is always great to see baseball since we don't have a Pro team out here. Good prices on food and beer. Would recommend it for a cheap night out.
I love this place!! Every time I go to Vegas I have to get stop here for lunch. They have the best hot pastrami sandwich! Highly recommended!!
The banh mi here is good, not great like places in OC. The bread and vegetables are fresh. They load too much meat in the sandwiches, which maybe some people will like, but it really should be a balance to be a great sandwich.
Lobster. Grilled. Cheese.  That is all.
Loved it!!!! My boyfriend and I are so happy and could not stop talking about our experience. The food was not the best but it was good and we had nothing negative to say. So romantic and intimate. And great service..
I only ate here once but it was expensive and unremarkable. Generic American food. I would rather grab a burger at In-and-Out.
JULY 29, 2011 == noticed  the restaurant's  sign is gone -- definitely should call before trying to arrange a gathering here!
Great Peking Duck & Chinese Sausage Fried Rice!  Nice restaurant inside and great service.
Love how close this place is to my house, love the Californian dreamin chicken sandwich! This place has a friendly staff and is kept clean. I have been here a bunch of times and have never been disappointed!!
Wow, cougar city!  This must be where all divorcees end up going to find their next husbands.
awesome lanes, always busy, always clean... I think the cashier could be happier but hey, its a bowling alley.
I moved here from Chicago in July of 2011. and  i have to say this was one the best movie theaters i have been to  in a very long time,  love the decor there, price are no higher than any other theater. i would recommend this place to anyone.
Great sports bar! Really friendly service and clientele. The quesadillas are slammin!
Worst place ever! Their nasty karaoke singer who is a regular, physically assaulted my brother-in-law and the bartenders did not care! There was no manager or owner on staff! This place is managed horribly and I do not recommend it to anyone!
Honeydew boba is so yummy. I've had better pho.  Servers are nice
Drove around 30 trying to get some doughnuts found this place and my wife asked if they had sugar free doughnuts , the lady told us we had the wrong place in a hella rude attitude...
Loved this place.  Burgers are awesome.  Especially with the baked potato fries.  Loved sitting outside.  Great family place.
Was an Ok experience, love the picnic tables however not the dirt.  Not sure there is much you can do about the flies being outside.  Would really like to see an area to refill coffee instead of standing in line at the food window behind several people
Ew. There's always a blonde girl working in the kitchen with her hair down and I found a piece of hair in my food. I'm sorry but that's just gross. Also there was flies everywhere. The place has potential but needs to work on a few things
Food was bad, service was non existent (we had to go find our server to ask for our check), restaurant was ambienceless. No wonder it was 90% empty when we walked in.
Great little neighborhood spot.  Great breakfast and good sandwiches for lunch.  We have been there 20+ times with no issues and good food each time.
I heard the food is good. I will visit very soon
Cheerful service for an early Monday morning at the airport. Too bad the food is awful - beans, cheese, tortilla - how hard is that? (and expensive for what you get, too!) Better choice: a $5 banana & water fountain sip. Pass.
Very busy. Pricey... $14 for a margarita ...that wasnt the greatest. Food is ok... I wouldnt call it authentic.... place was packed grab a seat when you can...even if it is dirty.
Not great, but it is an airport.
I'm afraid the genius of Wing Lei's tastes and textures was too subtle for my over-stimulated palette. Had the duck tasting menu and enjoyed a few of the dishes but didn't find any remarkable.
Extremely loud. The smoked turkey sandwich bread was dry. Pear salad was good usual.
Average show worth the price of free if you can get them. Juggler comedian was the highlight.
I tried a simple cupcake. The vanilla cupcake was moist however the buttercream icing was hard, possibly old and enough to turn me off. I may try this place again if I'm in the area but I won't make a special trip.
Love this place! Friendly staff. Good prices. Lots of \"locals\" constantly in here. Great desserts and cakes that are never frozen. Red Velvet Cake was incredible! And now they have DONUTS?!
I usually get the Pad Thai and spring rolls. The soups are fantastic and quite authentic but are huge portions. Not the prettiest setting but definitely some of the more authentic Thai food in the Phoenix area.
I don't quite get this place or why Asians love it, but it is very good :)
We had the seafood pancake and tofu pot.  Tofu was good, seafood pancake was lousy.  Lots of koreans so that does not say much\n\nservice was so so.
Great service and friendly staff! We ordered the short ribs and spicy pork. They were both flavorful and tender. We also go 6 side dishes to go with our lunch!
8 times out of 10, I love this place! Occasionally they'll mess up an order but are good about getting it fixed. Also the service is slow sometimes, but other than that.. everything is tasty! It's also a really cool place to sit outside & enjoy the view!
This has to be the best place on the strip to get your gourmet burger fix.  I have been coming to Stripburger for years & i have never been disappointed with their food and service. I highly recommend the cheesy fries.
Pretty good subs.
Just wanted something quick and gave this place a try.\nIt was ok because I was hungry and service was good.\nStill cant beat the sushi at takamatsu which is only yards away down the street.
Expensive compared to other thai restaurants. Service is bad. Run away if your server is \"Yok\". She scares me.
Great Gelato with plenty of flavors, try the hazel nut.
Went yesterday with a girlfriend... got 4 different cupcakes.  Yummy!  I highly recommend the chocolate marshmallow :)
Cupcakes and frosting shots, oh my!  This place is always busy and I think its the cupcakes.  My absolute favs are the Cinnamon and Red Velvet cupcakes!  I can't wait for the Pumpkin cupcakes that come out in the fall.
ok they ae jopen but rareley on time  the woman on duty even as waitress  is the worst waittres  i have ever expere in my life dont shop her awful sevice
great food reviews on www.bigtsreviews.com
Nice Happy Hour spot in downtown Phoenix. Their Sunday brunch is good as well. Kind of a small establishment,. Nice friendly staff.
The food is terrible. We went for happy hour and get the caprese and the calamari. The caprese was like eating diced tomatoes that had been stewing in something. The calamari was small and predominately breading.
The barbacoa could use some actual spice and it's a little expensive.
It was ok.  Had better
this place has teenagers running the place! Customer service is horrible! You are often greeted with attitude and a 15 min way on drive through with no car in front of you
Galleria mall is the last decent locals mall.
Good, large burger (got Paris one)\nAvg. fries\nAwesome milkshake!\n\nGot $30 groupon and really enjoyed it!
Good selection of machines, comfortable environment and down to earth, friendly people.
Its okay place, but I recommend go eat at the Palms for late night food, the Palms is cheaper and taste better.\n\nLate.
Really good Ahi Tuna steak, especially if you're drunk and need something to even out the alcohol. Servers are nice and quick.
Always need more check outs in the morning.
The food was good, but was way over-priced (reminded me of Dardanelles on Monroe Street). \n\nDecor is cool though.
I usually go here instead of the Surprise Walmart because it seems less crowded and is closer to me. I don't like that they don't have self-checkouts here though. Sometimes I've had to wait in line for awhile when I only had a few items.
Take and bake sign was small and hard to see, out of towers , talked to staff about visiting nothing mentioned about cooking it, the establishment seemed to have some cooking facilities, but staff was no help, very poor questioner service.
Got very, very, sick off the french dip.  Service was without a smile. Long wait.  Would not recommend.
This place is drowning my food with canola oil! Yikes! Heart attack awaits me, if I continue to eat here!
Went there for lunch today and had a very good turkey and brie sandwich.
Delicious Chicago Vienna Beef juicy hot dog with the works, and made from scratch french fries for $4. Best deal in town. Thanks for reading. The Bike Chaplain
Overpriced and nothing special. Tried it twice in a year. Money better spent elsewhere.
Great food,  great service and a place to watch World Cup games at lunch time during work hours. I had the three taco platter with shrimp,  pork,  and beef.  All were very good.  The salsa at the salsa bar was a nice addition.
This is a big place.. but rooms are just okay.. a bit outdated.. i had ants in my bathroom..
Place sucks...long lines poor customer service. First u stand in a amazingly long line to get the fabric cut and then a equally long line for checkout... darn my kids art project.....
The dresses are wonderful and they range from xs to 3x. \n\nHowever, it is a painful experience every-time I shop there. The sales clerks are just too cool to help me.
We made a special trip to the store, so after fighting strip traffic, 30 min. trying to find parking and another 20 min. walking we made it there. \nThe staff was very nice and helpful. But the clothes were pretty ill fitting so with sadness I left empty handed.
I have never been to a store ran by a bigger bunch of assholes in my whole life. I'd feel better having abandoned hygiene for a week and going to a Ferrari dealer.
Of all the Lodges, this one has the best bartenders and servers. All others have left a bad taste in my mouth. This location is awesome and will recommended to anyone.
I'm so sad that they closed this place down and turned it into a Mexican cantina. They had the best tapas and sangria happy hour in Las Vegas!
The check in process took way too long which caused us to miss the show. The show itself was fine, but not worth more than 10 dollars.
Short and to the point: The food is good. Littleneck clams as steamers for about $11 a dozen. Moose Drool on tap.
All-you-can-eat Fish Fry is the way to go.  Friday nights.  Hot, fresh and quick.  Late-night is the best.
I was pretty bummed when the Phoenix location closed.  You can always get a hearty breakfast here.  I like the spicy in-house sausage - biscuits and gravy on the side and you are talking my language.
Maybe this even deserved just one star. The bread's are just a bit better than mediocre and the sandwiches are, well, sandwiches
I never knew this was the name of the place until Saturday morning at 3:30am. o.o Oops! \n\nNot the nicest looking place inside, but it's kept very old school.\n\nGot that Drai's inside!
Pretty pricey and the food is just o.k. I have eaten there a few times and every time I came away thinking it wasn't worth the money. There are way better options in Pittsburgh
Low key atmosphere, on Mondays they have $5 burgers when you buy a $3 beer, great deal and great food.
The food alone it's worth the trip !
Nicer decor and feeling than you might expect in a \"local casino\" I tried their most popular roll sampler and a sweet/spicy beef stir fry dish. I'd go here again, and glad to have something like this out in this part of Summerlin.
Came with friends and had a great time.  Food was amazing.  Service was good. Will be back.
They don't put the price on their drinks and the margarita was 15 dollars. Service was slow, food was okay.
Darts and beer. Can't say much else.
I'm impressed with this Pizza - Mozzeralla, Provolone blend, just enough provolone to make it enhanced - The Service was Excellent!  In the past I have been unimpressed with this place... Yesterday they were ON!!!
have to ask for refills and waitress just stands around after taking your order everyone walks around with an attitude and its depressing and horrible service.  this will be the last time I come here
Went with a family group of 12 and no one had anything good to say about their meal.
They definitely need to work on customer service. I probably won't eat sushi for a year after dining here.
I had not been to Bev Mo for a long time and when walking around I remembered why this place is so overpriced.  Save yourself some money and head over to Total wine plus a lot better craft beer selection.
They have a nice assortment of music on the weekend.  The drink menu is comprehensive, we were happy with what was offered. Spacious and we were comfortably seated - much nicer than so many other bars around town.  \nIt reminded us of a cruise ship.
Extremely disappointed. Enough said.
Very pricy for the quality of food you get...definitely don't come here for the service.
Hit this place at Bally's a couple of times for their breakfast buffet. Good price. Not a huge selection, but the scrambled eggs and biscuits & gravy are both very good.
Run don't walk away from the express breakfast buffet. Way overpriced for inedible food. I've had better free hotel continental breakfasts. This place is horrid.
Wanted to try this place since it had the shortest wait time... well now I know why.. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing, but the black pepper chicken didn't have much flavor at all.. I was very disappointed and will not be coming back.
The menu is minimal and the burgers are solid.  Quick and easy.
Looking for simple then it's all about In-N-Out. Service is always good and quick. Got a double-double with some animal style fries and it was pretty satisfying.
Target is OK, nothing stood out to me on the shopping trip. Had a nice selection and well lit aisles.
I had a burger here, yes a burger at a sushi place kinda weird huh? It was amazing spicy and amazing.  Trust me please trust me.
Phoenix airport and the whoppers here are delicious!  Service without a smile sucks though.
Took 10 minutes to get a sandwich. Corned beef sandwich was supposed to be hot. It was cold. Asked for a bagel to not be toasted. They toasted it. Corned beef was dry, might have been frozen. Never going back.
The bagels are so-so, which is not a great thing if you're called \"The Bagel Factory.\" The atmosphere is nice and so are the people.
Food was good but nothing special. Portions are small. For what you pay you are better off going somewhere else. Will never go here again.
I loved this experience! They offer an iPad with a self guided video tour filled with facts about Paris, France. The view is amazing. We stayed to watch the fountain show below (Bellagio) and the staff was great.
Enjoying an amazing birthday dinner with family and friends... With a sushi feast to make the gods green with jealousy!
Great beer selection but as far as the food and service goes maybe we were there on a bad day. After ordering we waited forever for the food to arrive and once it did it was cold.
Word to the wise, order your burger well done here. You and your toilet will be thankful. \n\nP.S. Employees handling food should always wash their hands.\n\nThat's all I am going to say.
We headed here on Saturday night.  I like the concept and the food sounded tasty.  I was also excited based on the reviews.  Unfortunately, the food for our large group trickled out  slowly, and it was only mediocre.  The server was kind, but overall not a good experience.
Sad to hear this beats the other Italian joints in the city. However, the place is good and worth a visit. Strange layout - we sat upstairs and I had a wonderful view of a balcony wall that could have been much shorter or a railing.
Food was marginal. I had a chicken taco plate and burrito that was flavorful and could have been worth the very long wait if their wasn't better available nearby. Nothing special here folks. Glad we didnt move to Ahwatukee for the food.
Thought it was pretty ridiculous when I asked for no meat- just beans, and the cashier said that would be an extra charge because it's considered making a 'substitution.' Pretty poor customer service in my opinion. I hope the GM reads this and corrects the problem.
Good food, horrible customer service. I continue to give them business because it's close to work but otherwise I wouldn't bother. Nothing like being treated crappy while spending your hard earned money. Several of my co-workers have had the same experience.
I wish the delivery guys would stop using my neighborhood like a race track.
Prices reasonable and quick service.  I had samin, which was really tasty and received a good portion. I would have preferred it served in a bowl to enjoy at the location than a deep styrofoam cup.  And Hawaiian music would have been nice to hear in the background.
Just went here the other night. Solid food. Awesome Belgian beer.
This is my goto restaurant for moules and frites.  The beer selection is quite large and kind of $$.  Wine list is really good!  Stop by, you'll love it.
I've been here many times because its close to where I Live.\nThe menu is stale and the same old thing.\nThe food is pretty good (nothing special)\nBut is definitely overpriced.\nGood luck
Ordered a New York hot pastrami sandwhich on rye bread. not even close . it was alright, but not great. there bagels are delicious tho. I guess coming from nyc makes it hard to like the pastrami here :(
Great breakfast spot! Casual atmosphere and good food. Veggie Benny is YUM!
Definitely a good place to grab a quick breakfast. Also a decent meeting spot for business breakfasts and lunches. Personally, I think you can do better with the food but all around it is a bad joint.
ugh. mediocre at best.
Came here with a couple of friends on a Saturday, the layout of the club is nice but the place is too packed, lots of older folks and couples as well. as far as the music goes it was okay but I left after 30 minutes.  Waste of 30 dollars in my opinion.
I was not impressed. The cover was $30 for ladies and $40 for guys. Seriously? I don't have a problem paying cover, but $30 is excessive. I ended up just heading over to a lounge that was also located in the Luxor instead.
Pretentious, over crowded, rude, bad... terrible.  No.  So many better options.
Food is delicious. I had the Vegenini, it is like a vegetarian pizza. I loved it. The potato fries are also delicious. Customer service is always friendly.
Hard to believe this place is right down the  strip from treasure island. Great Thai food and really cheap prices.Be prepared to wait around lunch or dinner times as the place is small. Must try..
The service here is so slow. I order ed my food at 430 Pm and its still now done. Hurry up.
Had a great time here. Drinks are about $14 each so be ready. But the atmosphere was great. They get some really good talent spinning here too. Not a dance floor per se, but we did plenty of dancing (as did everyone else).
Our two steaks were raw in the middle. Not rare but raw. Around us other diners were calling the wait staff over for the same reason. Over cooked I can see - but serial raw? Horrible.
Very average.  The big eye app was not fresh.  The Kobe beef carpaccio was flavorless and seemed like it might have been seared.\n\nI left it at that before diving into a very overpriced steak
Update: As of 9 June, Memphis Best is only open Thursday-Saturday, 1100-2000. Gunny says they're shifting their emphasis to catering over the summer. Whether he'll go back to Mon-Sat in the fall remains to be seen.
Really enjoyed myself at the Auto Collections! The cars are beautiful, and there are so many of them! \n\nPrice is reasonable (12.50 I believe).\n\nWould recommend to anyone who loves old cars!
The caramel ones were heaven on earth, but I agree with the other Yelpers that the standard brownie is on the dry side.\n\nI still have quite a few flavors to sample, but from what I have seen so far, they are not worth the price point.
Mac n Cheese was damn good. Homemade bleu cheese was even better. Service was a little weak, but overall the dive bar/ lounge atmosphere and great beer selections are solid.\n\nWish they would expand the menu
I ordered Pho dac biet and it phokin sucked!! Only thing that was decent was the eggrolls. Decor was nice but food thumbs down!
Don't come here. They are out of everything by 6pm. Staff seemed angry the place was full. Pork chop was cooked enough for a whole pig.
This place sucks.  The brother of the current owner owns LOLOs Chicken and Waffles.  Go to LoLos.  If you want to experience reverse racism as a white person go to the Golden Rule.  Complete ahole is running his mother's landmark into the ground.
Don't understand the hype about this place. Went in today only to be disappointed.  Nothing spectacular.
They keep deleting my negative review that the SharpStone grinders they have are knockoffs and they only acknowledge this if you inquire directly if they are knockoffs.  They sell them as if they are true SharpStone grinders.
Good place to go to is your looking for a casual, fun night out while stumbling back to you hotel.
This place is terrible. The whole idea of the place is dumb; I'm not paying overpriced prices for bad service, bad jokes, and to be seated on a bench with other couples. I left before I ordered.
Terrible food! Terrible!!! Over priced diner food. Dry, chewy, garbage. Super suburban restaurant that tries to be silly and fun but it's just generic and terrible. If I had 20 thumbs they'd all be down.
casual. loud. ghetto. creeps and cheap half naked Butter-faces (everything is good but her face!!). \n\new never again.
Food and drinks were decent for what you pay and not horrifically overpriced. Service wasn't bad. Compared to other places I've tried in Vegas, I'd go back. Nice atmosphere.
Bad food below average service. Need to be lit to eat at this place. It will help
gosh, Charlotte must have low standards in sushi. This place was fairly terrible. Threw away 80% of my order. Salmon should have a taste and rice should be white, not 50 shades of gray.
Although the customer service was super pleasant, the sub sandwiches were not.  They are great for a drunk person that just has the munchies but not the place if you are looking for quality.
Birthday party for my son and a bunch of his buddies. The boys really enjoyed the arcade games and all of them said that the food was great. Our waitress Jessie was awesome!!
A really good sushi bar in this tro of asian restaurants in the Benihana Village.  I had lunch here during CES week and despite the large crowds, service was still very good and the food outstanding.
First time visitor.  Food was very good.  Service was very slow.
Delicious hot sandwiches,  opened 24 hours, what more do I need to say?\n\nOh, get the meatball sandwich! SO GOOD!
You've got to eat here if you are down on your luck and need a cheap meal to pick you back up.  We walked all the way down the strip just to eat here.
I went there with some friends and we all liked it. My wife and i had a vegetarian sandwich called a Caprese, my daughter had an italian and my friend had the Montagu. They were very inexpensive for the strip but i was hungry after my sandwich.
The prices are typical Strip inflated. $3 for a bottle of water. The sandwich cost more than twice the cost at Subway, an the flavor was almost 10% of the flavor/quality of the typical Subway sandwich. I won't consider returning
I've had waaaay better sandwiches. It's perfect for the late night \"smokers\" that don't care about what the food taste like as it is shoveled into their face eyes closed.
This place has really gone downhill in the last year. Customer service is bad & the sandwiches are just ok. They do make a pretty good salad but I just can't get past the attitude of some newer employees. I don't want these knuckleheads anywhere near my food.
I do not know how this place is one of the highest rated places in LV. The sandwich is small and can no way be fresh like they claim it is. Do not waste your time in their 20-30 minute line. Marginal at best.
Awesome sandwiches, very affordable. We came here for a quick lunch and it was pretty damn good. It's kind of a food court atmosphere which i didn't care for but, if your just looking for an affordable meal or lunch on the vegas strip this place is great.
Disappointed in this sandwich bar.  I had a salad which was ok - nothing to brag about.  I was disappointed that the menu only had hot subs - no cold sandwiches.
I thought it was a little expensive for a salad in a box that I ordered from a counter and ate outside because it was so packed inside.  It was a good salad though.  I think I will try some other places on my find out where to eat lunch tour before I go back here.
Chicken parm was just average. Field greens salad was great. Wait staff was great. The seating is right under the blue sky and in front of a large fountain in the Forum Shops.
Service is not so great. Took long to make my order no waitress in sight for 15 mjn. Eggplant crisps are good. Margarita pizza came without basil tho :( Once fixed was good. My Italian soda never received.
It works, don't expect more or less than food court food from your local shopping mall.
The display was great. That's why I wanted to try. But the taste is totally awful. The pepperoni pretzel doesn't even taste like pretzel. Oily and tasteless.  It tasted like uncooked dough. Totally a waste of money.
Traveling through town and found this brewery.  They had a good selection of beer and I really enjoyed the fish tacos.
Finally popped by here for the Gail Ambrosius anniversary party. The place is gigantic. It was also really packed and parking was a pain. The beer is always good, I would have tried the food but the wait was too long. Will definitely be back.
Quick and tasty Chicken Sandwches. Nothing special
I would give it a zero if I could brings a very unsightly crowd to a good area.
The steak here was not worth the price at all....i really don't have much to say about this place besides stay away.  Its not worth your money or time...however the decorations inside were very nice.
Good Pho, open all the time.
This place wasn't for me. Had the mexiwrap, zucchini pasta and Acai bowl. The Mexican wrap was my favorite amongst the other dishes, however when I got home I started feeling sick and ended up throwing up. Not coming back.
Our favorite local steakhouse. Went on Friday night to celebrate my husbands birthday. Adam the manager took great care of us and the food was great.
Food not that good, fair price though. I ordered a chocolate and is way too sweet! You can't even take 2 or three bites because you will get sugar rush.
Meh... \n\nSuper slow going southbound in the morning. I've discovered I can get to work quicker on surface streets, which are no picnic.\n\nDecent ride when it's not rush hour.  Nice view through the mountains.
Had decent food, but shitty service. Never returning.
The layout of the parking lot is not that great especially the first intersection you come to entering from McClintock.  The stores are good though and there is good variety to satisfy most of your needs.  Clean shopping center with good stores.
Awesome place if you want to almost get hit by a car. An 8 year old can put together a more functional parking area.
I avoid this mall.  I hate parking here, and trying to get in and out is always a hassle.
I have been here many times but the place seamed different this time.  The veggi portions were tiny.  The meat seemed tough and the waitres was less than accomedating.  I think I will have to find a new place in town......what a shame.
Worst service I have ever encountered.  Passive waiters and terrible manager.  With 2 kids in tote, you would think we could have had faster service!    Would NEVER go back.
Excellent costumes amd great music however the show lacked the wow factor generally associated with cirque du soleil performances. Additionally there was minimal acrobatics and a weak storyline.
Just an ok show. Not worth the time and money!\nA live band would have been better otherwise we could just stayed home and listened to our CDs. \nLots of dancers and I guess they tried to describe the songs, but they look so disorganized on stage!
I loved the molcajete! The margarita was really good as well, and it sneaks up on you.. i could barely make it to the car!
The pizza is good, but the pasta is outstanding. Nice quaint family outing place, or a great place to take a date for a private dinner. They, also, offer some good salads.
A GREAT show...THANK YOU ASU Marching Band !!
Ok tacos and margaritas.  Nothing to write home about
Tequila tasting can we taste some tequila next time.. was a fun experience but the tequila wasn't even a half a shot
Eat here every couple of weeks, food is good, not great , but good.  It is consistent and the portions are adequate
I don't understand all the good reviews here. The hibachi here is like avg mall food court quality. I guess if you want quantity over taste, this place does ok then.
I guess I agree with the 3 star rating the place currently has. I like the concept, love local joints, enjoyed their assortment of teas and wines, but that is about it. The service, timing, and environment needs work.
Usually a good selection of brew .. Mostly California and other West Coast breweries. Food above average.  \nService tonight was very good but I have been there when it's slow.\nWe'll be back.
Decided to try this place for after dinner drinks with wifey. They have a good selection of brews and an overall cool place to hang out.  Didn't have a chance to check out the food menu. Place is worth a visit for drinks or just hanging out.
Pepper jack lobster and shrimp tacos blue corn tortilia black beans and rice, very cold beer! Good service.
Swanky place, good atmosphere & food, right in the heart of Madison's cultural center. A great place to meet friends for food & drinks, even catch the game @ the bar.
We rolled up on Tuesday before 8 pm and it was closed!  WTH!  I was starving and now I can't try you BBQ!
Heart Bar holds a special place in MY heart.  Why?  Because I met a 14-large bachelorette party at this bar.  Needless to say, it was a perfect weekend.  \n\nNote: Unless you're looking for hookers, avoid this place after 1am.
Another disappointment in a meat market here in Las Vegas. They don't even butcher their own meat. They are no better than a supermarket and not as good as Whole Foods. I would love to find a true butcher here in Las Vegas.
Room was ok...nothing special. Staff was nice. Parking garage was very spooky! Pools were not impressive to me. There is an adult store right across the street....weird & creepy. Very convenient location but I won't stay here again.
Love love the food, the services super nice and the favors right on.  I suggest you guys try it out.
No longer open for lunch.
Funny, the same stuff gets executed much better here than in Atlanta's NW location, which I reviewed a few weeks ago.  Service was fine here too.
Was really looking forward to eating here but was so disappointed. I ordered chicken Marsala and I got chicken swimming in basically soup. It was just terrible. Guess I should have stuck with the pizza.
Pizza was good, a little pricy for pizza. Hubby was disappointed they don't serve beer, or coffee. Decent service just wasn`t expecting to spend $100+ on wings and 2 pizzas.
If you have a spare $100 and are not real hungry go here. Long wait,poor service very average food at best but hard to tell when it comes out cold
i love how late this place opens, as most places are in Vegas. Lots of taiwanese food, but unfortunately, the food tastes so-so. the only reason i went back multiple times is because they serve stinky tofu, a dish very hard to find in the Southeast.
Nice employees, Salad Bar is good Deserts are ok but damn for almost $12.00 I could have had a better meal at Denny's which is where I will go next time I think I want to eat here.
Don't go here, the bartenders are rude!!!
Excellent tri-tip quesadilla and brisket.  Too-die-for sweet biscuits and honey butter.  Good chicken.  Steer clear of the sweet potato side dish and (what a waste of a) roasted artichoke.
Went for lunch to celebrate a grinding training finally ending. Burgers and drinks were good. I wish I had time to sit there and savor it. \n\nI will go again with kids which is the true test as we all know.
Beer wasn't great and the menu was pretty lame... I expected a much better menu. Very disapointing. Gordon beirsch looks like fine dinning in comparison... I won't be back.
The only reason I came here was because the TI provided us with a 2 for 1 coupon. The food was over cooked and greasy, and some just tasted funny. The desserts were the only things that we ok, not horrible but not great either. Very disappointing!
New ownership doesn't get it .
People were telling us they were laughing so hard that they cried.  We didn't experience much laughter or tears.  Not sure if it was because we could not relate to it.  This show is for 45+.
What a disappointment.  Everything was overly salted including the miso soup.  And it certainly was not worth the $50 per plate.  We won't be back,
Fish was decent a little warm for my taste. Service is good. I feel with the business they do that they can upgrade some of their products such as buying better soy sauce then higher quality of fish.
Honestly, it's a really nice place with nice decor.  I guess that's why people think that the food is good.  Actually, the food I was not impressed at all.  The rolls, the appetizers.  But hey, again, nice restaurant.
This is the 2nd time we've come early enough but the hostess didn't want to seat us so we are going elsewhere ... $300 tab .... Your loads mutha fuckas !!!!
I expected more \"wolf howling at the moon\" shirts. Sorely disappointed
The ambiance was nice. But the bartenders were rude. We were handed our drinks and never heard from our bartender, Herbie, again. What's the point of looking at something nice if the service is poor. Pretty on the outside, ugly on the inside.
Overpriced. Only went because we had a coupon.  Service was OK but not overly friendly either.  Definitely don't need to go back...
Is it a steakhouse or a singles bar?  With the music blasting out of the bar area, it is difficult to tell.  There are steak options every few blocks here in the Valley of the Sun, so skip this one and go to any of the other fine options.
The cashier here is very mean especially a lady named Letticia!
The pickle that comes with food here is about the only thing worth writing about. Otherwise, everything is just kind of boring and not worth the trip. There are so many other good places to get a sandwich or salad that are far superior. Skip this place and try somewhere else.
This place is very loud and the staff are not friendly.  The food is ok and the drinks are pretty plain.
I wish I could give 0 stars. \n\nI went back today to give them another try. The service was so disgusting I walked out. (Before getting my food). \n\nSo disgusted by them. BEWARE. You will get treated like absolute shit.
$10 for a 4:20pm show. The absolute WORST movie theater popcorn I have ever eaten. I wish I'd have gone a few miles out of the way to AMC for $5 tickets and good popcorn. Very, very disappointing visit!
Nothing exceptional, yet no terrible disappointments. An Abuelos clone for sure. Don't go outta your way.
When this first opened the food was good. Now it tastes like everything came from the freezer. The food is just okay now but not for the price.
Have to bring this down.  Place was cool, but the staff became really sh*tty.  I so like the food, but geez, it's smile or something.
This used to be the original location of NYPD Pizza, but the owners sold it to Pauly and the food has gone downhill since.\nI'll stick with NYPD Pizza, thank you very much.
This food was pretty terrible and overpriced.  I would not go back.
Worse buffet experience in Vegas.. Usually you can never go wrong with buffets in Vegas.. this was a bad choice. \n\nFood section.. quality was bad.. overpriced.. \n\nNever come here again.
Short review: Dorm Food.
Wish this site had a minus star.  This buffet was terrible.  The food was mediocre, food stations were dirty and not well stocked. The salad bar was the biggest disappointment.   Certainly NOT worth the $20 dinner price.  I would not recommed this to anyone.
I had fun here while I was in search of an inexpensive brunch before the long drive home. Great variety of dishes. One step up from the hometown buffet/golden corral type buffets.
HORRIBLE!! The chicken tastes like its from a banquet TV dinner!! Do not waste your money like we wasted ours!
This is absolutely abysmal. I'm sitting at the table trying to figure out how to get my money back...
Formerly Pharoah's Pheast.  Definately spacious dining area.  But the food was just OK.
Chad at the bar hates his job. He made that obvious through his poor service and bad attitude. Our crime? Eating dinner and buying drinks.
Service at the Las Vegas blvd location is always horrible except for the bar area. For some apparent reason I continue coming. Great bar food! Awesome beer!
Worst customer service ever!!! The hostess was more then rude & spoke to us like we were stupid & the manager was clueless
Wow. Horrible counter staff. Rude, unhelpful, just awful. Why can't Rick Bayless have more outlets. This is bad.
Great spot; food ok; staff does try but not the best...love the views and the room.....
closed for ever
the owner likes butcher your haircut and color, then likes to argue with you on whether or not you lied to her about how you wanted your hair. Not worth the price or the time.  BEWARE!!
Disappointing. Color was not done well. Thus expensive for the results.   \nGray was not covered. Friendly. Clean
Came in at 700 pm Saturday night  place is clean  .  Waitresses were slow. Handling to many tables each\n30 minute ticket times   food was average    I'll skip next time ......
I miss this restaurant so much. Their tortilla soup and jerk chicken salad speaks to my soul. I recommend trying these two items because they are delicious. While I enjoy the Scottsdale location, the Tempe one is nice too.
Solid.\nI'm not in love with the food, but it serves a purpose.  My hubby loves the cornbread, so we usually end up here versus Kona based on the bread alone!
Came here today. Got seated by the host and never got service! After about 20 mins of servers walking by and others being served that came in after we did we decided to leave.. Maybe we smelled bad???  but still gonna give it 1 star for being seated
Fish not fresh. Tuna frozen!  Ebi from same frozen shrimp I buy from 99 ranch market!  Sushi is bad. Service was really bad. Never going back!
Quite disappointed, my green beans had worms in them. Customer service was bad, still charge me full price for everything. Nobody even apologized. It was just a plain horrible experience.
Absolutely terrible food. Paying a dinner price for lunch leftovers is anathema to my wife and me. The wait staff are superb, and very nice. The Orleans has other places to eat on site, so avoid this one at all cost.
Pretty awful. Bad service.  Dirty. Crowded. Hot. And the food is junk.  I should have gone to another terminal.
Beer was not very cold.  They don't have the beer price on the menu - it is more than you'd (or I'd) expect.\n\nI went there expecting some custom beer - not here!  Standard beers on tap.
Apathetic service, not a brewing company, just a bar.  Pass this one by.
I wish I could give this place more stars but- like everyone says its over price, slow service and the food is only ok. You are better off going to the Starbucks in the hotel and getting a muffin.
This place sucks. Was told to avoid hour and a half wait to go in the lounge. Sat at a dirty table (only one available) and was totally ignored for 15 minutes so we left. Never again.
The ambiance makes it seem like a fancy restaurant but sadly it is not. The food reminds me of Mexican fast food joints like Chilis or Chevy's. Same kind of appetizers and everything. The service is good though.
I will never eat or drink at this location. The waitress took 30 minutes to take my order and the cook handled all kinds of raw food without ever changing his gloves.
I enjoyed the novelty of getting my mercury on for $3 in a big cup. The shrimp were of poor quality - of that I am sure - but love the concept and they tasted decent.
Creative food, poor service. \nSpent close to an hour between appetizers and the main entries.
Cheap beer and interesting crowd that go there. It's in Freemont - Downtown.
Did not honor website prices, overcharged on a la carte lunch specials, and charged extras without warnings. And every table was available at noon. Coincidence? I think NOT!!  What happened to the restaurant that was here under the same name a year ago!?!
Went once. Las Fuentas is sooooo much better! No need to go back here
my girlfriend and i have been there twice, and twice we have gotten upset stomachs, there were green bugs in the menus, friendly people, but get passed off to a different person both times, stay away from this place
The crowd was all old creepy drunk men , one was drooling and bragging about how much money he had, and then got kicked out bc he stole my friends iPhone!!!! music was so loud I couldn't think.. bartender was awesome though.
The bread is not warm. The half oyster plate had one empty shell so we got 5 oysters total. We ordered the bone in New York steak. I've definitely had better at lesser restaurants. The service is excellent but the food did not hit the spot.
i had a chocolate cupcake from this today and currently am suffering from food poisoning. i suspect that it's salmonela.  i threw up everything that was inside me and still can't move, and have a crazy headache.  watch out when eating their cupcakes.
Mediocre food... salsa tasted too \"tomato-y\", guacamole was very bland, taquitos were just \"ok\". Much better food from the small hole-in-the-wall Mexican joints.
Yaaawwwwwnnn!!!!! Next!\nThere are better pizza joints in town!
The only good thing about this place is getting to ride the mechanical bull.  It was empty both nights we stopped by.  At least I get to mark something off my bucket list!
I like this place.  It is in the top 5 places to get a great burger in Charlotte.  They have lots of cool signature choices, and of course you can create one any way you like.  They have great fries, both reguar potato and sweet potato.
Had our credit card swiped twice for one bill on one visit and then it happened again a few months later...definitely not going back here.
This place was horrible. Do not go here.
Golden Corral has better Quality food.
Waited here twenty minutes for service! Waiter came and got our drink order and they were never brought to us. My boyfriend and I just ended up leaving. Terrible service
The service is fine, better to go in during happy hour.... N don't miss their seafood undo pasta, yum
Found a bug in my salad. See picture.
The food is decent but it gets spendy quickly!  Their OJ is the best...fresh squeezed, most breakfast items are very good, service is good.  The Tri Tip Dip is a must try!
The salad was average but the salmon was awful! It was over priced for what you get and how you get it (cafeteria style)
Like the convenience and prices on some items. Disappointing that they don't take manufacturer coupons.  Some items are missing (low cal, low carb, etc)
Not much meat selection,  really slow,  even though,I wasn't crowded.  The meat was really some poor cuts. Ie sirloin.   The salad bar was boring. I have to say I came Here about a year ago and was really impressed.
Enjoyed the coffee did not care for atmosphere.
The coffee is fine.  I am very thrown by the fact the don't have any center or sugar for taking.   Their poor costumer service skills is the single reason I do nor plan on caffinate here again.  They yell at their customers which is just poor business altogether.
I LOVE the food here, you can make your own stuff, combination, veggies and stuff.  delicious! the FOOD is great,\n\nThe service however, could be better, faster and more attentive.\n\nRonney
its was ok. not really worth all the hype\n\nPrice: a lot\nPresentation: good\nTaste: okay\nservice: okay
The beet ravioli was gross, my hubby's steak needed salt, and service was slow. At least the waiter comped the ravioli since he was the one who suggested it. Won't be back.
You didn't offer a Zero. This place has good food but is overpriced and the music they pipe in that prohibits conversation should get someone an opportunity in another industry.
Food,staff & service all very very poor.interiors very depressing.u are better of cooking Indian food at home it will turn out better than anything served at this place
The food is good but if your eating in the bar bring a fan - it is way to hot - there is no AC - pathetic
The burger was good, the fries were ok, but once you mentally process that they were deep fried in lard, then what was tasting really good turned into a really guilt-loaded dinner. But it is what it says it is. A truly American restaurant, proud of its decadence.
was a regular for a while. Over time found the friendliness from the staff to be a bit of an act. Zombie hipsters. Long wait.
There isn't a coffee shop at the address given in yelp. I called the number but couldn't reach them.
I walked out (12-30-14, 2:30 PM) in disgust after female server tried to seat me in a tiny booth even though there were many bigger booths and tables available. Asked to talk to manager but told he wasn't available.
Rude service.  Very unpleasant order takers.  Plus bagels are Just as bad as eating doughnuts.
This place is pretty good, not the best, but it's still satisfying.
After posting this, I went in and asked for a cash refund, as I was not interested in returning and would not use a credit.  As mentioned by the owner, I was given the cash refund I requested.  I stand by all my other statements.
When the owner comes by to apologize, I'ts not a good night. Service is slow, pizza is nothing special in a town with some good pie. It's also weirdly loud in there.
Slow service, very small pour for overpriced wine.love the rustica pizza. i like to carry out garlic knots and a rustica from their tatum location. for some reason no garlic knots at the location on indian bend.
I'm a little bit disappointed.  I tried to order a smaller custom cake for a very special occasion.  Even though I inquired over 3 weeks in advance, they declined because they're too busy.
I like their food but there are some annoying flies bothering us.
Tried various locations of Lindo around town, just not impressed. Just standard fare, with inflated prices.
Decent C+
Pretty place, but snotty management and the cocktails are not very good. After being told that a booth was reserved we were invited to sit with a large corporate group which was so kind of them. That \"reserved\" table never became filled
If I could eat the pepper jack mac and cheese all day long, I would. I get it every time I go. The sandwiches are pretty good too. It's got a great, laid back atmosphere where you can get pretty decent bar food and a have a beer or two.
Cool place, Great healthy food, spotty service
Great food, great atmosphere, but POOR customer service.  No smiles on the cashiers at all.  They just never seem happy to be there.
Pulled pork was tough, dry, and vinegary.  Fries were old and soggy.
Used to be a lot of fun, but prices went up and service went down.\nFinding new place to hang out with friends!
We went to Pole Position as part of a team building event with work.  It was pretty fun! Definitely a great place to bring out the competitive attitude in everyone!
Stopped by this place on vacation in Scottsdale last week.  We were just looking for something quick.  The pizza was good, nothing fantastic, but pretty good.  I had a slice of pepperoni and olive.  The ingredients were all fresh and I enjoyed it.  It was very expensive given the location.
we have been to multiple thai restaurants in the SE Valley and this restaurant was by far the worst thai food we have eaten around here!! Service was alright but food quality was sub par... not returning
The sushi was so so, service was mediocre and the drink \"hello kitty martini\" is the furthest thing from a martini. Ultimately dissatisfied.
Very good food.  They just moved locations across the street to the old seesaw location. Good food can't really choose a bad item however the atmosphere is very ho hum.
Used to go there all the time and the last time I went the tech accidentally cut off a chunk of skin which was horribly painful and two days later I found out I had a massive staph infection
It's a HUGE slice and a fair price but, other than that, I don't share the enthusiasm for Mamma Mia's. It's just \"OK.\"
I'm tough on pizza places. This place is good. I truly enjoy the ingredients, and preparation. Atmosphere and service are lacking.
I come here a lot. Like that they have cheap matinees and offer a variety at snack bar. Like that they have the automated ticket machines.
This place had terrible service and piss poor food to boot. It was a combination of our waitress being new and not interacting well with the chief that cause the bad experience. However, there are plenty of better Italian resturants in Vegas than this.
SERVICE SUCKS!! Got our drinks after we got our food. The restaurant was not even busy. After we got our separate bills, our waiter alberto had messed up our orders and proceeded to tell us they did not split checks. failed to mention that before end ordered.
Undercooked egg, overall very poor
glad I only had coffee.  meh..
Wasn't impressed at all.
Cafe Rio has THE BEST food, but this location has not gotten an order correct once. When ordering online, don't expect your food to be made until you get there. Make sure to check it or you will get home and find out your order is wrong!
Good Persian food with a courteous staff. Nice to have in the neighborhood.
the service was lousy. i have had better service before at the one at arrowhead mall. my daughter spilled her drink and they gave her an apron to clean herself? they left the soda on the floor so we had to step on it the whole time. what?
food was fresh and authentic but way overpriced. owner was nice and so was girl behind counter will I be back maybe but only ordering food once you add in $2 drinks and $3 desserts the bill begins to rack up
Anything free is alright with me, especially in Vegas! This show is alright, although the volcano flames get so hot you can feel it.
It was an ok show. Don't be too dissapointed if you miss it.
For airport Mexican food I will give it a little credit.  My suggestion is keep it simple, order something like a quesadilla where odds of failure are really low and you'll probably come out alright.
The bacon and eggs were great and the coffee was also.. The sandwiches not my favorite. But breakfast is a YES
RE was delicious Tapas, sadly they are now closed :(
Driver's are crooks! They write in their own tips! Managers aren't very helpful either! All crooks! order somewhere else, not here!
To this day I will never understand the hype. It's fast food junk.
Steaks were extremely expensive and did not taste much better then what I had at an all you can eat Buffett the night before!
Horrible; don't waist your money. I left before they could even finish my order. Go to a different Chipotle.
Fatty steak in the steak tacos. Toppings tossed on sloppily to bury the shells under a mound. $12 bucks for some mediocre lunch tacos... Me thinks not.
Slow service and small portions.  Food is good but not worth the wait.
Most locations are usually the same but this branch's lettuce tends to always be soggy and the bread either over cooked or old.
Just came in for a smog check. It's $19.95 regular price but with the coupon mailer it's $14.95. Can't really complain much about it. Simple service in and out and cheaper than jiffy smog definitely.
The service was outstanding.  The waiter and general manager nailed the whole experience.  The food was good, but I have had equally as good cuts of steak elsewhere for 1/2 the price.
Overpriced, food wasn't very good, the service was only decent. If you go to Cadillac Ranch go for the eye candy and the bar on a Friday or Saturday night otherwise you will walk out feeling like you just kissed your sister... yeah I said it!
Not a fan. I visited here 4 times over a year ago. Thought the food was mediocre at best. The atmosphere was cool and the service OK. Not interested in returning. Have lots of other options. The atmosphere is unique and cool, but not enough to return.
Food took forever to cone out and was cold when it did. Nobody ever checked on us and we saw our waitress a whole three times between our food arriving and paying our bill.  Despite the restaurant being empty, the manager never checked on us.  This place obviously is not in business because of the service.
Great food, but awful service.
Good place to go and eat gyros if your up in North Scottsdale. The staff is friendly and the food gets to you real fast. The price is somewhere between 7-10 per meal but that's usual for N. Scottsdale.
The pizza is pretty good, and the prices are decent. I've ordered from them several times. However, the pizza never seems to be cooked fully through, it's always thin and doughy in the middle.
I've ordered their pizza based on yelpers' review... Meh... I didn't want it after a bite.
This location is awful. They changed names and nothing actually changed besides that. Food isn't very good. Dinners come with nothing but mounds of onions. So many better places to choose from. Won't be going back.
This place is crazy dirty.  The ribs are tough, the pulled pork okay.  Ate here because we had a social media coupon.  Will not go back. I wrote another review of this place at one star but it has gone missing?
This is something I will definitely pass on next time around.  I do not know whether it was the 109 degree temperature or the throngs of people but it made it is something that not worth wasting your time on.
Great for a lunch salad with girlfriends...  if you're not into rabbit food, the pasta lunch specials are tasty too, but be prepared to nap the rest of your workday... :)
Solid food. Neither spectacular nor bad. Good service. Sit outside.
Food was ok, Great place for hang  out or for watching sports great selection beers
Over rated. Better food else where. Waitress did not bother to refill my iced tea when she brought over refills for my husband and son. My turkey club sandwich - dry. Although I did enjoy the small side of Cesar salad, hence the 2 stars.
I used to like Sundance when it just opened, but it has really gone downhill. \n\nThe service is awful and the food is just as bad..
Horrible Service. Extremely slow to seat us... and feed us... and water us... and bill us... slooooow.\nWe won't be going back.
Closed. Out of business, at least when trying to check the place out on July 14, 2010.
Busy airport eatery.  Nuff said.
We went for the unlimited sushi but ended up waiting around for way too long for our food. Just a truly ridiculous amount of time. I felt like the sushi was below average as well. Wouldn't come back.
The theatres are too small, they overcharge on refreshments/snacks. customer service really isnt all that great...
Average food at best. Wings undercooked and greasy. Onion rings underwhelming. Service poor. Waited 30 minutes when place wasn't busy...  Won't be back...
Not impressed. The staff was standing around, the pizza by the slice was limited to two choices that looks to have been sitting for a while and wasn't very good.  And no one seemed to really care.
Shortline for a quick bite, nothing special!
Food was standard Chinese fare. The wonton soup is very good and worth the upgrade.\n\nWhen I went, they seemed short staffed and overwhelmed. Had a long wait between wait staff visits. Place needed cleaning from an apparent lunch rush.
It's fast, it's friendly and about as inexpensive as you can get in Desert Ridge.  Wasn't blown away by thier food, but I would go back.
Don't waste stomach space on Maria2 in an area this full of tasty restaurants... sugary margaritas, sloppily presented meals, stale chips...\n\nYou can do better...
I wasn't expecting authentic Mexican food but I was expecting good quality food for the price. The flavors where decent bit the meat was fatty and not cooked properly and expensive.
'We went here on a Monday night for drinks.  The drinks on the menu were creative.  I'll try the sushi next time.
thought all the nicer vegas strip restaurants should have more quality....\nguess i will stick to having sashimi / sushi in LA!!!
Food is great.  High end sushi.  Josh the mgr hooked us up with a few apps on the house.  Bad part:  Our server was terrible. Christy or something like that.  She needs to go work at Denny's with an attitude like that.  Won't be going back.
Cost $500 every time came here to have yummy sashimi, but the last time really sucks! One oyster stink n wholly smell. Was of my favorite but won't go there again
Service A+.  Staff was very accommodating and great.  Food was overpriced and terrible. 1 star for great service but would have rather had crappy service and great food
We paid 13.99 per person and there was two aisles of the same exact food! Small amount of choices, not the best quality, not worth my money. Save your time and money, find another buffet but this one!
This is an average food spot with really good service. I'm not really big on all the wok stuff, so I had to find some alternatives...and, there really aren't many. We had a good time and our service was funny. I'd go back.
$60 for 4 rolls that we weren't that impressed with... I find that pricey.
It was okay. Overpriced for average quality food. Don't think I \nwould ever go again.\n\nThe wasabi was blue.
I purchased unlimited and I should've brought the one use pass the rides were ok. Great view however, the rides wasn't scary I'm and adrenaline junky and I love roller coasters but these rides didn't do it for me
This place runs out of certain donuts at a certain time. I was told it takes 3 hours to make chocolate munchkins.
The lady at the window was short & rude. 3/6 donuts were incorrect, she had already walked away & would not come back after handing me my 'latte' which was mostly foam. What a way to start your morning..
Horrible don't give a cr*p service. The worst I have experienced in any restaurant here in the valley! The manager Gary is an apathetic weasel with no customer service skills. Anyone want to buy a $25 gift card from this dump?
Overcrowded, overrated, overpriced tourist place in the Bellagio. Horrible, I mean HORRIBLE service.
I feel like everytime I have come in service and quality have gone way down. Im going to Sauce from now on for sure.
Fried okra was fresh hot and delicious, pulled pork, beef, and chicken were all served cold, so was sauce & beans. won't return.
I asked for a grilled Tuna rare and it came to me well done along with soggy asparagus.  The rest of the table did not have any issues with their meals.
Ordered nachos...took about 20 mins for it to come out. Sour cream looked like cottage cheese and they use the shredded microwaveable cheese. \n\nThe beer is good, can't really go wrong with that!
Customer service is always and I mean always bad here and the food is just ehhh also but I continue to go here for a bowl of white rice which that they can screw up.
Dry n small tamales. I had high hopes because it seemed legit. Keep looking if you wsnt really good tamales.
Went for the \"garlic festival\".  Love this place but where was the garlic festival?  They were selling some garlic but that was it.  Very disappointing. I will continue to buy their oils and spreads but won't bother to attend anymore \"festivals\".
Worst Customer Service I have EVER recieved in my entire life. I know that sounds dramatic and harsh but it really was terrible. We got stuck in there over 3 hours. Our server was rude. Food was mediocre.
Where is 2470 W Happy Valley Rd.  It's not near the large 2480 number on the building in the middle of the block on the north side of the street.
Intimate restaurant seats about 70. Neat but a bit over priced, steaks were not great, and $70/ person for 2 sodas 1 bottle of average wine with the meal and no desserts. We wouldn't go back.
Just an average bagel place.
If you want a great, gourmet cupcake go to the Cake Artists Studio on Bloomington Road. They are cheaper and she's an accomplished pastry chef. The cupcakes at Cakes are overpriced and not special at all.
I hate to say this, but out of all of the cupcakeries I've tried, Cream & Flutter is my least favorite.  From frosting to cake...very disappointing.  Maybe I should go for a cookie next time?
Very slow service and they weren't very busy. Decent food. Very loud inside.  Nice patio when it isn't hot.
I went once and wasn't impressed.  I tried it again and it didn't fare any better.
Waited for an hour during lunch. They took my order, waited forever, and ended up having to leave without eating because I needed to get back to work.
Ok more of a 3.5 star sushi joint. Nothing I had was mindblowing.
Not the best, not horrible. Waitress not being able to make a recommendation or knowing what anything is, pretty lame. This place is very overrated.
The boneless wings though tasty were all batter. I picked most of it off. The burger looks amazing and was huge. Could be a little more well lit during the day but the staff was wonderful and the food was pretty good.
Worst enchiladas EVER and decor from a 1980's attempt at a mexican restaurant.  Taco Bell is a step up!  But if you like soupy enchiladas drowning in cheez wiz this is the place for you.
Seated and forgotten on a Saturday night. Servers looking bored. How about, check you table? Jeez...
Sat for 15minutes no one came to serve us, they checked on the booth in front of us, but ignored us completely. Going to Cracker Barrel down the road.
this place used to be fun, now all you get us over priced drinks that are watered down and poor service. I definitely won't be back.
They close at 10pm.   We got there at 9:15 and the host refuses to seat and serve us.  Will never go back there and give them anymore business.
This place blows.  Food had no taste and shake was below average for a higher than deserved price.  Johnny Rockets blows this place away and I even prefer a Denny's burger and shake for half the price
Corn bread--good.  Street tacos--very good.  The baked seafood enchilada--not so good (tasted very fishy).  Tortilla soup--not so good, but maybe be average for a tex-mex style.
Wow.....as bad as it gets.... And I've been traveling for 39 years. Terrible terrible terrible
The tables are always filthy and sometimes the staff seem like they can't be bothered to deal with you, but the bagels are pretty tasty and they definitely soothe my bagel jones when I'm having cravings.
Horrible horrible horrible service. We sat for 10 minutes and were not greeted so we got up to leave and all they did was wave us goodbye
The food is decent, but with the handful of times I've been there...worst customer service, EVER.
I come here about once a year and then I remember why I don't come here more often. My car was next in line to get washed and 3 corp vans were moved in front of me. And now I wait. Will prob take 40 mins to get out of here .
Dinner was poor service, bad food and too expensive.  Good location for happy hour only.
the Front desk staff was very pleasant, Hotel is old, the kitchen appliances is very old, we booked four rooms four nights. each one w/ old appliances. Housekeeping didn't refurnish daily supply, wouldn't stay here ever again
Horrible service plus very expensive food. Restaurant was empty and it took a half an hour for a waiter to come and take our order for drinks. Would not recommend.
Two words:  shitty service
Had my gf office party here. It was meh. Probably won't go here again but I can see the appeal to some folks
Friendly hostess who also brought our food. I think the food was okay for the price we paid but the coffee was excellent nice and strong unlike American coffee! Probably will give it another try soon.
Food is better than service......cashier acts as if she's doing me a favor,even though she was nicely rude....this is sad because Goodyear could use more GOOD mom & pop businesses.
Just watched the chef drop his tongs on the ground, pick them up and use them again. Refund? Yes please.  Not returning to this place. When I asked him about it he wouldn't respond to me.
The toasted panini that I had cold meat in the center. The music inside was obnoxiously loud. The only reason that I'm giving it more than one star is because the waiter was very nice. Everything else was less than savory
Good spot for brunch, but over priced
Im not a real big shopper at DSW but I did find some super awesome boots I saw on pinterest for $100. They also give out military discounts. They have a great selection to choose from!
The food is nothing spectacular. The only reason to go is because kids eat free on tuesday.
Great staff but dry cigars wasted 20$ on two cigars that are as hard as a rock...very frustrating when you want to end the night with a good stogie
$45 before tip for a men's haircut Supercuts coulda done. I won't go back.

Good food!!! But the service was slow...
I go to Starbucks all over and this one is super slow and super rude. This is def the worst starbucks in town!!! Avoid it like the plague!!!
This is the only Starbucks in my neighborhood so I go here by default. Friendly enough staff but they are consistently sooooo slow :(
Steak was good. A little on the salty side but did the job. I would go back but would look at other options first.
We didn't have reservations so we didn't get to try the food, but the guy in front was so rude so I don't think we'll be back.
Omikase was not worth the price. Service wasn't great. The server told us no sharing, which was a big turn-off. Would not recommend.
$5 for a drink and original pollo bowl (rice, beans, chicken). Not a bad deal for a fast food place. It reminds me of a cheaper Chipotle. Definitely get the avocado salsa!
The Mrs and I shared a turkey and pesto and we liked it. Better than the other stuff around. We got lucky as a group of people came in after us and still weren't served as we were leaving.
Just hope you're there on a good day! Buffets are not what they used to be in Vegas.
this business is closed :(
Parking is a nightmare and the vendor's produce looks half dead every time I've been. There isn't anything here you can't get in better shape at the grocery store.
PUT A MENU ONLINE!\n\nFB page doesn't work - hurting takeout business!
Muddy sound, unimpressive seats...meh.  It seemed pretty worn down for being such a new theater.  I'll stick to one of the two big chains.
Update. Holy crap - went back and ordered two scoops of ice cream. Instead was given world's biggest blob of ice cream in a huge cup. Which is good or bad, depending.
Great hotel, but be cautious of the hidden fees. They will charge your credit card without your approval and dislike children staying there.
Great coffee but don't go here if you're in a hurry. They employ only college students who are over the top friendly but who also think keeping people waiting in line for 15 minutes while they talk to their friends is totally cool.
So apparently the food was horrible according to 4 people so i know i wont be back for food even though the gravy cheese curd fries looked yummy enough
The tacos were cold and the dude was sketchy.  I probably could have told this just by looking but I had gotten lost on my way to ginger's and was hungry.\n\nAt least it was cheap.
Besides the racist joke about all single mothers are black, my nipple piercing went fairly quickly. They hurt like hell but I like it.
Horrible customer service! I will not return! If I could give this place zero stars, I would!
Yuk.  No casino.  No view.  Small open shared pool. \n\nWhy would you want to go to Las Vegas and stay at a hotel like this?  \n\nLuckily the staff was nice enough to not charge us for bailing.
Saggy beds piss me off
Slow and lazy people. Took 3 hours with appointment to change the tires. Wheels were not torqued to correct specs, thanks god and I didn't get into accident.
This place SUCKS my whole family threw up 2014  Santa fe SUCKS 2009 Santa fe was awesome don't eat here just go to in and out
This place is over rated. Having Tyson's chicken nuggets on the menu is not healthy. The turkey club and salad tasted like shit. I'm never going back there ever again.
The service was good but I can't say the same about the food.  My food was super greasy and it just did not taste good.  The prices are kind of high too.
The food is always awesome. The time it takes to come out is a little to long some times. Regardless it's a great place to eat and healthy.\n\nEdit: wow the article about their cookie was interesting. To good to be true. :/
We waited for 20 minutes before we left.  Nobody so much as said hello. Have never gone back!
WTF YO? 5 people on line, and service is madd slow for a busy crowd.  Never come at lunchtime 12 noon and expect quick service from THIS Cane's EVER!!
The wait staff was nice, The service was good, The food was as good as it always is at CPK. If you like CPK.. You will like it here
Good food, but the service is so disappointing its not worth the trip.
I don't why you would go there. DId see a few flamingos, ducks and koi. But I just don't see the point. It may take 10-15 minutes. There are too many things to do on the strip. I would avoid it.
I usually really like pita jungle but this location seems to be poorly run. Plenty of empty tables but the food took forever and they claimed the kitchen was backed up. Stems on grapes in the salad. Graffiti in the bathroom. Disappointed.
Extremely poor seating layouts, be prepared to pay 50% extra on top of your $10.00 ticket for \"premium seats\" that are really the only seats that allow you to watch the movie without breaking your neck or sitting next to a wall.
We were starving and it was the only reasonably priced place open at 9:30pm in Northern Scottsdale.  The brisket was edible and the sides were mediocre.
My wife and I looked forward to eating here for weeks. We decided to get one of our favorites tonight, bbq pork ribs. Let me say... extremely disapointed! Neither one of us would recommend this place.
Disgusting behavior, meat market. I was sickened by the experience.
Sooo Sad that this location has been closed. Now we have to drive to the one located in central phoenix.
A very nice dinning experience.
Honestly, the worst service I've ever had. Tried it more than once, and I will never return.
Not very good. My spring roll was bland and the peanut sauce was yucky. Vermicelli bowl was full of bean sprouts not noodles.
Place was dirty and did not serve vegetarians. They guy said over the phone they did. Otherwise nice people.
Surprisingly, it was one of very few things open when I went out looking for food. The service was good. Food was OK.
Great little rest stop along the strip. Numerous selections in burger styles. I highly recommend the chili burger.
Eat lunch here today, ordered a beer any tacos, the tacos were good but the glass on my beer was broken and cut my lip, the waitress brought me a new glass and no discount on my bill... Thanks for the cut lip.
So so burger,good service. I was not impressed w food.
There's nothing fancy about, rather plain actually.\nClean. Inexpensive. Quick. Good. \nFairly healthy depending on your choices.\nI always just get a simple chicken Teriyaki bowl.\nGreat value.
Close and good lunch specials!
Arrived @ 6:15pm on Sat without a reservation, restaurant was fairly full.  We were seated immediately though.  No one even acknowledged our presence for 15 minutes.  We got up and left, once again, without being acknowledged.  Disappointed.
***This restaurant has closed.***
Being from the Midwest, I'd never had Del Taco. Can't really say I've missed anything: the bag probably had more flavor than the cold, limp fries and unmelted cheese on the all-lettuce \"chicken\" tacos.
Food is just ok. I'm not asking for culinary genius but something that isn't dry and hard to eat. However iron city was half off so all was not lost. Waiters would take food around to every table asking who it belonged to. This happened all night long.
This place is always out of somthing. the Dunkin Donuts on the east coast are 100% better
Just passed by this DD the other week, and sad to see it is now CLOSED.  Blame the economy I suppose.
Pretty good deli sandwich but a hassle for parking. Love the selection of things to buy sorta like a little market in NY!
Ok for a quick lunch. The server was nice, but the food was average at best.
Toooooooo freaking bright ,  i am gettin lightbulb burn.   Servers sitting at the bar with their uniform.  The bartender took 8!minites to acknowled me.   Toooooooo bright! Not likelly to return :-(.
Nothing to rave about, it was good. My first time here.
Food is always good.
Service is good overall. The have happy hour all day. The food is not healthy, but treats great! The Blue Ribbon burger is delicious. My bf liked his colossus burger. The fries are decent,  but love that they have a range of dipping choices for them.
I wasn't a fan of the place. Not trying to be rude, the bread was stale. When we walked in there was only one other person during the lunch hour. Our order had several mistakes too. I would be hesitant to come back after this.
3 measly chicken fingers on a pile of soggy fries. How do you mess up chicken fingers?! 9 bucks...no thank you.
I have to agree with Taric W.'s review.
It's cheap....not the best food, not the best quality. But it's fine to eat when you've been walking around shopping for 5 hours. I finally tried the meatballs and they were alright, but I wouldn't call them good.
Good ambience. Looks like the cheesecake factory. This place is super busy on the weekends so call ahead. Got the feel of an upscale olive garden. Not impressive but not disappointing either.
Tried them twice now, and as far as Italian goes, pretty bland.  Service was kind if stuffy too
Netflix is awesome. I am not sure how renting videos could be any easier. I just wish they would rent some games to me as well... oh well.\n\nUpdate: They never have any new content regarding feature films.
Decent food here but come on, is it really the food you come here for? I like coming here when I have my irish cravings and need a good ol glass of guiness.
Pasta was good. wine was good. but I cant trust an ITALIAN restaurant that puts Herseys syrup on their tiramisu. Sorry.
We were down in the area for the arts festival and the park toward the point was all torn up and under construction. Not sure what's going on there but hopefully it will be an improvement.
Good, fast food.\n\nI stop here every so often when I'm walking on Craig for an inexpensive, but filling meal. Go for the sub combos, easily the best deal on the menu and make sure you ask them to toast it!
I dunno, I was drunk when I got there.  It's amateur night there every night! They have a mechanical bull.  You might find yourself looking up at the sky wondering if it was 8 seconds.  Trust me it wasnt.
Terrible service. Very unprofessional would never go back. Chose a different location in the epicentre if you want a good time and to be treated well.
I had the special (a chicken sandwich) and it was okay.  I've only been once and it seemed a little pricey...but I could be wrong.  I will probably head back sometime though.  Good place to play Trivia on Tuesday.
Film selection here is not quite as good as at Concord Mills, but the theaters offer a smaller crowd, clean theaters, and most of the big hits.  It's a chain theater, so not really anything else of note.  Average size screens, average size seats, typically horrendous prices.
Yelp reviews made this place sound neat. The place has no ventilation . I walked in for 30 seconds and walked right out.  I am pretty sure I got cancer !
Decent. Nothing to write home about good place for an appetizer and beer. However the main menu has an identity crisis (bar and grill is not fried rice or egg rolls maybe dumplings not so much). Sometimes small bar drama does not need to be shared with all.
I heard this is called the Sh*take factory. Thats accurate
Food was good but service was terrible. Went with large group of 12 to celebrate a  birthday. Plan was to eat have a few drinks then take in a movie. Ending up tsking 2 hours and thats not counting the time to eat
A topless diner near the Olympic Stadium. Decent diner food, lots of security lounging about, and what looked to be a few regulars hanging out. \n\nFYI - I was the only female patron!
Good hotel. Nothing special or fancy but very clean and very friendly staff.\nRestaurant is completely overpriced. Food is so so. \nMenu has not changed since at least 7 month (could be longer).
I suppose that's what you can expect for the very reasonable prices. Food heavy on fat, light on taste, and cavernous decor.\n\nGood for a group looking to eat quality food on the cheap, but not for much else.
Classic drink food. Just Noodles, no frills, open late, cheap as dirt, served super quick in massive heart-stopping portions. I don't know for sure that it's MSG laden, but the hallucinations suggest that yes.
Cool restaurant in the heart of \"The Village\". I had a great experience, and would recommend it to adults. You can have great fun especially during the summer.
I had the burget and it was OK. Found it a bit dry, but still overall tasty. The calamari was good and a large portion.\n\nI do not recommend the poutine. The gravy ruined it.
Doughy. Is it really a bagel? Great atmosphere and fun to watch them flip the bagel. Got it to go and walked down the street munching away.
Sorry... not as good at Fairmount! The all-dressed bagel was as good as naked, with no salt to be found.
Been here a couple times.  This place has great deserts, but the service is LAME. Slow, non attentive, and rude.  This place can easily be 4 stars if not for the service.
Didn't have a chance to try it unfortunately. We waited around twenty minutes at our table and no one came to take our order but there were five servers standing around chatting at the front so we left!  Keep in mind I've worked as a server for over five years
Have you ever asked a cab driver to take you to a good place to party? This was my first time and most likely the last.
One of the larger Second Cup around.  Always tons of fresh goods.\n\nCan get busy on Sundays where students come to study.
not worth the cost of the plate! paid 38$ for a chicken on a plate. no sauce and the vegtables were put on a side plate to share amongst 5 people! i was shocked!. high prices for no reason and waited forever to get served.
Family-Friendly. Affordable prices. Lots of patrons. But food was pretty average.
Second time here.  Great selection of brews, but the service is aloof.  Not sure if it is because we're Americans, but we weren't loud/obnoxious.  Just out to get a few brews before the night.
Fun restaurant, great for the cause you are going for, simple setup and service will of course vary depending on the night as many do it out of pure generosity.
yummy, great salad bar, but wish they had more veggie meat options though!
Il mange, elle boit, c'est comme ci, comme \u00e7a.
Looks and feel like 99c store, or $1 store with prices higher than at Macy's. You have to crawl between shelves. Do not go, do not waste your time.
In a city like Montreal, you have to have great food to survive.  Unfortunately, this place focuses all energy on appearance and being trendy, with the food taking second stage.  Unless you're the type of person who just wants to be seen, it's not worth the long line.
Came by for dinner today and noticed that it's closed. Unclear if it is permanent or not.
Pretty good supermarket in terms of selection. Otherwise I thought it was a bit overpriced and was disappointed in the apparent freshness and selection of the items in the bakery section. Small wine selection, but the wines in stock included a few decent picks.
My friend brought me here to try the dim sum.  Coming from the area I grew up in the states, I've never had really good Chinese food.  I was pleasantly surprised at how delicious and delicate the dumplings were.  The prices were good too.
Waited 1 hour for food!  Someone ordered Benedict no cheese and a bowl with 2 poached eggs arrived! My sunny side up were runny.  $40 for 2 breakfasts and coffee! Waitress didn't even speak English! Ill never go back here again. Worst breakfast ever.
Nice place for a brunch. A bit expensive though and no pancakes!
Got the burger of the month.  Was good but not exceptional.  The menu is a little pricy for the quality and service.
In summer it's a great place if you're looking for a terrasse.  They also have live jazz music which adds a nice touch.  The pizzas aren't that great but the crepes and salads are usually a decent bet.
Uninspired food, cold inattentive service. I will not come back.
I worked there. Believe me, you do not want to eat there. \nHygiene? methinks not.
We choose this hotel based on price and location  \nThe continental breakfast was good\nNothing fancy  just a place to sleep\nThere was free wi fi
I've heard good things: http://en.maplaza.ca/adresse_des_comerces-rep-addr
Food and service were just ok. We left our camera on the table after the meal. One waitress told us she saw it and kept it inside, then the ones inside denied and took it. Have left stuff at many places before, hard to find such dishonesty in North America.
Nice music, great location.
not sure why people love this place. It is unique but not chic, more bohemian or punk i think...if u r into Italian designers, this is not ur place
Good food in a very relaxed atmosphere.  This is the place to have dinner if you are thinking asian and then heading over to hang at the Waverly or Cafe Olympico or maybe grabbing some good Scotch at Whisky Cafe.
Schwartz's is good but not great. \n\nThey are famous for being condescending but I feel this is mostly an act to keep up Schwartz's reputation.
This is easily the worst supermarket in Montr\u00e9al. They actually follow you around the store to make sure you don't steal anything. And when you finally do make it to the checkout counter with your rotten vegetables... The cashiers never say hello. Never!
First poutine I've had in a long time. It was quick and I enjoyed it. If you want poutine and its 5:00AM this is the place for you. Late night, and delicious.
I had heard abt there so called BLIZZARD but was very disappointed with the taste or   Flavor or I would say was that an nice cream
Excellent smell but nothing outstanding. Good portion size.
This was one of the worst Chinese food meals I've ever had. Diabetics should steer clear of the General Tao chicken -- it would be less sugary if they just doused it in maple syrup. I've had better food out of a catering truck at half the price.
Must visit if your in downtown Montreal! Atmosphere is welcoming. Music is good and upstairs has outdoor lounging. The only problem is the bar gets very crowded as well as the dance floor which makes it difficult to maneuver because the people don't move for shit
Average. OK winelist, food basic Italian without much thought, ambience OK. Would I recommend it? Not if I could walk somewhere closer....
Had a late lunch with the wife and decided to try Les 3 Brasseurs on St-Denis. Place was nice and clean warm even on a gloomy day. Beer was good. Service as well. But a 15$ nothing special burger served with frozen fries. Big disappointment.
Bah! Je n'ai pas appr\u00e9ci\u00e9 mon repas. Je n'y retourne pas
Oh my lord no! The dancers here sure are skinny! In truth, the clientele do seem to be having a good time.
Not review for this location.\n\nThe bathroom was so gross and small. GROSSSSSS! I thought I would give local coffee a support. Too disappointed!
Shawarma, pita and garlic sauce can not go wrong with some vegeatables.  Their hummus is alright, and service depends on who you get, some the friendliest in the world others seem to hate their job.  Stick with the Shawarma and it is a no fail.
Montreal is a great and vibrant city but PET Airport is cramped, dated, dark, and congested.  Its too bad that everyone gave up on Mirabel Airport.
Nice to be back home...has some problem with Nexus check-in machines...Staff was most helpful and understanding
They have  naturopath that works there-great advice-and free!Just everyone can hear your problem so be aware of that when consulting. They don't stalk all the products I want to see. The owner is close minded.Isn't very giving.
Service merdique!  La serveuse m'a demand\u00e9 pourquoi je lui a avais donn\u00e9 10% de tip!  Quelle insulte!
Good ambient and waiters are friendly.\nBeen a soon of a Portuguese family I was a little disappointed with the Black Cod I ordered, missing a little taste and definitely not enough sides available.\nWould give another 1/2* if was available.
Came here on a Saturday night during labour day weekend, the service wasn't good, but the place was busy. We were seated and it took about 20 minutes until a server waited on us. I had the braised lamb shank and it was okay.
Terrible gym, bad hours, close entire gym for maintenance without warning, lots of staff that do nothing because weights always everywhere, so many people there you have to wait for everything...good reviews here only for price which is pretty good.
Interesting place to say the least. Crowd was good and lively and the beer was priced fairly. They have a foozball table and a good selection of music.
I went there once, nothing special. I think Soup and Noodles across the street really kills their business.
Had Buffalo Chicken sandwich, it was not that bad.   My friend ordered chicken tenders, it was horrible.   Good place for people who had drinking.   Nice environment.
Nice drink menu and a great balcony with a view of the city. Much better than the club/pub options down the street. Very trendy vibe but worth it to avoid loud club beats on a weekend!
the chicken shwarma sandwich was pretty good, but not the best i've had.  the sandwich was dripping with grease, which might freak other people out, but i'm ok with it.  the potatoes with the garlic cream sauce is off the chain though!
Gross.\n\nBut thats what you do when nothing else is open at 2 am...\n\nI am happy I didn't get sick the next day
Ate there tonight. Took quite awhile to be waited on. Manicotti was good, fish was overcooked but okay. Only complaint was the service. Asked four times for water and never got it.
Expensive and the service is hit or miss yet the food is good.
I personally thought this place was terrible. I ordered 2 cheese slices and I could barely eat it. I felt that the cheese and sauce tasted cheap....I certainly didn't think it was tasty or anything like that.
Meatballs were fantastic, service was great, the rest of the menu was good but in general too salty.
Spinning classic 80's and 90's music all night.
Overpriced and nothing to write home about. The place was amazing when it opened (in the 80s or 90s) but like many places that have become staples they no longer try. And there's nothing worse than cynical, overpriced food.
Our destination for brunch when we stop on Nuns Island, Montreal. Nothing special about the food but reliable. The patio is quite nice on a summer's evening.
nice beer selection but food was pretty subpar.
Pretty shitty place. Bad atmosphere, bad food.
Had a pitcher outside and people-watched for an hour. \n\nLots of outdoor seating which is good but I didn't check out the inside or try any of the food.
Slow servers.\n\nSoda was only refilled when I yelled out to the server.\n\nNothing too special.
Pretty fun spot. Food is not amazing, but it's outdoor seating makes up for that. Cheese and fruit appetizer is quite good, I think appetizers and drinks are swc's specialty.
Although the food here has always been impressive on many visits, i have to say im a bit dissapointed to see my favorite dish go from $17.95 to $27 in the space of a couple years....
Service is a hit or miss, as is their seafood. Fortunately its a BYOW and their pizza is delicious (real pizza oven).
Nothing special about this place. The food is ok and the service is slow. Not enough space between tables so its almost like your having dinner with the tables next to you.
Do not order sushi from here. The rolls are 3km in diameter and the soy sauce is so salty you may dehydrate on the spot. They use chicken fried rice in their sushi  Chow mein is also questionable. Save your money and your taste buds.
Poor food quality. Not worth the price.
A Montreal classic that is worth a visit at least once. Orange Julep is definitely the star, but hotdog with poutine wasn't bad.
Crap. Food is meh, pricy and bla service. No ambiance, waiters look always stressed out. Don't eat here.
Prix \u00e9lev\u00e9 pour le type de nourriture. Par contre, la qualit\u00e9 des produits ainsi que le go\u00fbt sont au rendez-vous!
Belle ambiance, beau menu.  Je vous conseille vivement de r\u00e9server...car c'est souvent plein.
Veggies taste sour, their rice is disgusting, and they can't even properly cook a steak.\n\nThe service was alright, but the food is just...disappointing.
let me just say off the bat the food was good.but my booth I sat in there was sticky stuff on it and the fork had crust on it.i asked for water and I got diet coke.th3 staff was friendly.
I could not find any staff to help me find a hard drive enclosure that I was looking for. No one was available or even in the store on a Saturday afternoon, I waited for 30 minutes in store.\n\nFuture Shop it is.
The food here is actually pretty good, but the service is absolutely terrible when the owner Rajiv is not around. And forget about the delivery, the food is always cold and then they blame you if they can't find the place.  They really need to work on the service.
The new owners are wrecking this place. Just returned to Montreal for a short vacation and the staff are way overworked. Won't be going back - it's better in my memories. The food has gone down hill.
wasn't the ownership change at the time in 2004... It was the cook, and recipe change that killed it. Went there for lunch, new owners... Horrible... Zero stars
Mediocre food, but great service. Lots of comfy seating with great views of different TVs and games.
The food is pretty expensive for what it is: generic steam table Chinese food. I would recommend other Chinese food in the plaza less you're in a hurry.
Service is slow the food is ok. I ordered a small fruit bowl and it turned out to be canned fruit. Don't order that. It is just gross!
The food is pretty good, but I don't understand why their lunch specials are so expensive. I once ordered a pad thai to take home to my husband, after I dined with a friend at lunch, and ended up like $40 in the hole. Brutal!
Slooooow service. Food was cold when I got it. Staff is friendly enough, they just need more staff on for the Friday rush.
We always enjoy Wildflower Bread Companys food. Always fresh and delicious.  Today there is a long wait. Bit we were informed before we ordered leaving us the choice of staying or going elsewhere.  We chose to stay.
Good pizza, I also like that they use the \"level up\" app. I saved $10 on my order.
Average American restaurant, good food, but nothing special. Safe choice restaurant.   Bar area is loud, a bit difficult to talk and hear.
went here with a friend to look around and see what is it all about maybe another time when it is not so hot  right now i think this park is not so hot as the weather is
Excellent Margaritas, Food pretty good too! Lack Mexican Ambiance, like having a mexican meal at a CPK. Nice Patio, Id go back for the Margaritas for sure. Excellent Service and very nice.
The food is pretty good. I got the greek salad with grilled chicken, which is $10.50. Its just too expensive for fast food.
This place is in my neighborhood and I decided to support a local business instead of going to a chain like Little Caesar's or something. The pizza was mediocre and the price was high. Perfect. The veggies on my pizza were basically raw and the sauce did not taste good.
This place really needs to work on their service. Hiring cashiers is one thing, training them to give good service makes a business so much better. I'm pretty sure this place's management doesn't really care about customers, more focused on loss prevention and keeping the store running.
Pretty decent car wash for the price.  They were happy to go back over a couple of places that they missed on my car.
Wow this place has crazy prices for a sandwich come on get real I don't understand what justifies paying so much for a soup or a sandwich and the portions are extremely small do yourself a favor and pass unless you have money to blow
Do not, I repeat, do NOT go to the nail salon next to Dillard's. Very horrible service, they do not listen to you, they do a horrible polish job and of course the typical Vietnamese gossip the whole time which is very annoying.
I have two free meals here and can't seem to bring myself to going. \n\nAnyone want to try it risk free? Pm me and I will arrange the details.
The outside and the inside is clean and looks like a Caribbean cafe but the food doesn't taste like it.
Good rooms but be sure to get a room that does not face the school - heavy truck traffic and garbage trucks loading/unloading Bailee's all night
The club sucks... tiny dance floor and expensive drinks... get your party on for free downstairs. The music is better and there is a lot of room to sit and chill with friends  =)
If I was back home in Seattle, I would consider it a good club, but for Vegas one deserves better.  Cramped and dark.  When I stopped by on a Sunday night, the music was mainly techno.
Not bad pizza for an airport quick bite. Line was quick. Seating was not plenty, but was able to grab spot right away.
The only good thing I can say about this place is the waitress was very friendly.  The chips and salsa were bland. The burrito was very boring. The carnitas tacos were dry. Nothing interesting or fresh.   Definitely not going back again.
Much better than last year!  They must have a decent saucier now. The Alfredo was right on.  [Oh my!  I just realized that their sauces must now just come out of a can.  I wish they'd tell us if they are freshly made.)
Great service!  Very comfortable atmosphere.  Food was fine.  Nothing over the top outstanding but good and it was priced appropriately.
Good food but sometimes slow service at times..been there 6-8 times
Nice atmosphere, good service, mediocre food at best. My advice save your money.
Food and service is good , however, beware of the owner, Gianfranco. he has a potential to go postal on unsuspecting patrons for no apparent reason. Screaming, cursing, etc. Dine at your own risk
ONLY good for drinks, food is very bland & unappeasing how can anyone go wrong with a Philly cheese steak??? will not be returning!
I thought the brunch was just okay. The french toast was overcooked and the sausage patties were dry. I was starving so I ate it all anyway. I'd give it less stars if it weren't for the great outside dining area.
Well, it's large.  \n\nI'll sum it up quickly:  I've been to a lot of Asian grocery stores, and this one gets the honor of being the only place where I've seen large cockroaches scurrying about in broad daylight.
Meat and two place. Pretty decent food. Great service. Divey.
Eh...   Good variety of wing sauces/rubs.  But it was average.  Plenty of tvs to watch football but they are very awkwardly mounted so you have to crane your neck to see more than 1 game.
Stale bread, water glass unrefilled.  Stuffed mushrooms undistinguished.  Bolognese spagetti sauce with no depth.  Portions large.  No reason to go back.
Burritos got smaller, flood still flavorful, but the attitudes of the servers aren't positive and enthusiastic as they use to be. I dont think I'll be eating here again for a while.
Mediocre fish. Super small portions.  Bland.  No atmosphere.  Good service though.
Food is blah, but atmosphere is stellar. Just stick with coffee and you'll be happy!
Ok coffee. But very nice looking place. Not bad for a good relax combo with a friend or colleague
Food was good but, not great. Location is very cool, in the town center. (think Big White columned building with southern looking square)\n\nNo lunch specials-you paid dinner prices.
I was really disappointed in the service I received for the price I paid. Paid like $40 for a car wash. (My car needed it) They gave me decent wash, but that wasn't what I paid for. Not going back.
Had lunch here today. At best, it's alright. I wouldn't want to rush back here anytime soon though. Typical American food (check), loud atmosphere (check), average waiters (check).
Unpredictable each visit.  Checked the county health code web site and decided to stop going.
Very colorful, especially if you want to smoke weed surrounded by a bunch of weirdos playing African drums...other than that it is rather boring
Restaurant is nice, and service ok.\nAs a meat lover I never tasted anything that horrible as their prime rib cowboy entree serving.\nChoose another restaurant !!\nPaul
Their products are good however the customer service is not. I've been in a handful of times over the years and each time the employees act like they have a stick up their asses.  I'll go spend my money somewhere else.
Positively the snobbiest Starbucks I've ever been to. Get over yourselves and crack a smile, for goodness sake!
Food was decent, drink was yummy....service could've been a little better, but for a sports bar, it is overall okay.
For french food, it was a regular food.. not bad and nothing out of the ordinary.
This is NOT the best galatto in the valley. Although the view of the fountain is nice, it was way over priced for the lack of flavor. It wasn't bad, but is there such a thing as bad galatto?
Enjoyed the lychee tea. Love that each teapot is unique and their cookies were delicious.
Went here before a movie, some food was warm some was cool.  but we made the movie in time!!
Good beer and decent food...
Love this place, but so sad with their limited and confusing hours of operation?  The website and voice message give conflicting hours/days of operation?  Ultimately, the kitchen closes by 6 pm--super tough to make dinner plans!
was here with the hubby.  Great service!
Overpriced, even on things you can get the same of at walmart or food4less. They try to upsell you at the ice, people think its free when they ask if you would like ice, but its not. Ill start shopping here again when I am rich.
O.k BBQ ...we had sausage and BBQ sandwich as well as a burger they were all pretty good my favorite part of the meal was the bbq nacho for a appetizer ...
This is an above average sports bar chain with fantastic chicken wings. I like stopping here for lunch occasionally, I don't know if I'd ever bother late night.
My only complaint is they are pricey compared to other quality sushi restaurants ie sakana on Hayden and Indian school but the food was good service was good and the ambience is comfortable
Some of the poorest customer service I have ever experienced, but the crepes and drinks were very good :)
Very clean and not crowded on weekends. They do price match only with Fry's, Safeway, Albertson and Basha.
we decide to have our christmas party here for the enterteiment. i was so desagree the food the plates were expensive and not very good.  also they did let us play on the table pools because the have some kind of activity with few people over.
My rating is solely based on the service. I ordered food to eat-in but it took close to an hour to be prepared, so I changed it to take-out. Haven't tried the food yet.
Food is great! Service sucks!
It's now \"$3.49 Cleaners\".  They do a decent job but I finally realized they're the ones stapling the return ticket to the garment itself.  And I don't like little holes appearing on the fronts of my dress shirts.
The food is really, really good but the service is horrifically slow.  If you are golfing or live in the community it is well worth the wait if you have a few days to spare.
Overrated brunch. I shared 2 dishes: the scotch eggs and the full monty, which is a combination of all the options for breakfast. It wasn't really tasty or that memorable.
I'd heard a few recommendations to try the pizza here. I was thoroughly disappointed. The only reason I give it 2 stars instead of 1 is that they offer some options you don't find at every pizza place. With that said, I didn't really like the pizza.
A nice variety of asian plates are offered in this place. Not the best ones I have tried in all categories but if you want variety this is a good place.
Good Thai dishes. Make sure you understand the Spicy levels.
Solid 3 star red curry tofu.\n\nNot 5 star, not 4 star...but hey!  They did great with the one classic dish I ordered...
Good food decent service but not amazing like Texas roadhouse.  The ribs are probably the best thing I have ever had here and they do give you amazing rolls before the meal.  I would recommend giving this place a try.
Alright at best staff wasn't very helpful and food took along time for no one to be there...
Small Indian takeout spot in Latta Arcade with pretty good food, although my veggie entree was a bit watery.  The naan was fresh which is always important.  I'll probably go back and try something different just to make sure they're legit.
I would give this place an eek methinks not except for the fact that they have such great stuff, but a no return policy...none at all, prevents me from ever going again.
My previous  review highlighted a lack of offers, this has now been challenged with this bold printout slapped on their notice board (see picture). \n\nStill there's a lack of offers regarding drinks...
This is a decent-size neighborhood pub with a good, comfortable atmosphere.  The staff when friends and I visited was friendly in general, but extremely inattentive when it came to service.
Just popped in here as some of our friends who joined us after work hadn't eaten so for them pizza, for us a glass of wine and beer.
Rooms small (apart from one or two fantastic suites). All a bit tired now.\nFull of american coach parties.\nOh.. and they play \"highland music\" over breakfast.  I think that says everything that needs to be said.
Tasty diner, with plenty of comfort food. The taps were dry when we visited but they have a small selection of bottled drinks to choose from. The bangers and mash and shepherds pie were decent. A great hangover meal restaurant.
I've been here for a couple of nights out and the cocktails are good and the music is cool! A bit crowded and full of a lot of posers taking selfies but if you can handle that then its a good place to start your night!
Very friendly bar staff who were even willing to show the US Open golf in between World Cup games. Would return for sure!
middling italian fare on the grassmarket. you could do much worse in the UK  (think bella italia) but you could also do better. it's a fine place to enjoy a slightly better than average italian meal on a sunny day.
Good price and great location only a few minutes walk from the shops and the theatre. However, the room was terribly cold because the windows aren't double glazed. Saved money by staying there but ended up very cold at night.
Had a not-so-great experience at US Egg. My veggie frittata was really soggy, like a veggie frittata soup. The frozen vegetables must have thawed in the dish.
The burgers are good, but was really makes this place worth it are the shakes! You can get your standard shake with a variety of delicious flavors, or you can spice it up with alcoholic versions. Simply awesome.
Just stopped in for a quick drink at the front bar. Don't know why I'm even writing a review. It was cool, no complaints.
Insanity!\n\nIt is a beautiful place to be, but drinks are nothing but suga and wata.\n\nI did not get drunk, insanity.
What the truck, chuck? \n\nel servicio - no bueno\nla comida - no me gusta\nla decoracion - una estrella\nla margarita - una estrella
The kale salad with chicken was disappointing. It's a pile of shaved kale without much else. The chicken is tasty, but there isn't much on there. All things considered, I think the food is overpriced. I wouldn't recommend it to a friend.
Like this place - friendly staff, huge selection of veg for all you foody needs and really well laid out, so even when its busy you can still get around. The only down side is it can be a little more expensive than some of the other shops around argyle place etc.
Service could not have been worse. Totally rude waitress, ridiculously long wait for food and our bill. \n\nThe food was not bad though, and the location inside the hotel and atmosphere were cool, so a few stars for that!
Good to stop in for a snack...don't go out of your way.  $5 bar snacks are good, guacamole is good and nachos.  Stay away from frozen margaritas pre-made from machine.
Food presentation was great and the chips and salsa was really yummy. Actual meal was okay. I had the El Pastor tacos and husband had enchiladas. Not bad not great. Our waiter was just okay too. Won't go back
There are so many good reviews here that I almost feel I was in a different eatery. Perhaps I need to give it another chance, yet, I found it average in every respect so I doubt I will return.
the good here is decent, a-ok in my book. however, the ambience is a hell of a lot nicer in the bathroom than in the actual restaurant. minus one star for that one.
Ok mod con shops, the place could do with some pazaaz, a better food court and an injection of love.
Bar - expensive\n\nStaff - judging\n\nLocation - alright\n\nDecor - good\n\nwine -warm\n\nToilets - BAD BAD BAD
Not that great of food. Limited wine selection. Not a kid friendly place yet I have kids around me. Would not visit again.
While visiting Edinburgh, a friend took us to the Mosque Kitchen on our last day in town. As a vegetarian, I thought they had a solid selection for a decent price. The food was tasty and the service was on point.
It's an ok place.
Happy hour from 11pm - 3am for $11.99 is LEGIT!!! The selection they put out during this time is limited, but is still satisfying if you want a good, cheap Korean BBQ fix
Good food.  Bad service.
Great price with generous portions.
Not very impressive ... tables and floor dirty .. I spilled accidentally and staff watched as I cleaned up with no offer of help.   Left sticky residue and nobody would wipe down properly
The location of this place is pretty unfortunate (in the ghost town that is City North).  And I might be spoiled by other yogurt shops, but the variety seemed to be lacking.  The saving grace would have to be the 1/2 price Tuesday Twitter word of the day!
Good place for lunchtime burritos. good service and nice atmosphere.
Barista can't/won't reheat cold coffee. I was told to pay for a refill if I wanted to finish my drink. No, thanks.
Found out this place is closing and I am not very surprised.  It seemed to lack a good atmosphere and the coffee was not that impressive.  Best of luck to the owners, check out Crossroads Books and Coffee to support a local shop in the burbs instead.
This isn't great food, it's simply a place you hit up when you are trashed and need to fill your belly with grub so you can sober up.
Bartender was a heinous miserable female but the drinks were bomb!  I would go back just for the gnarly drinks but the service was totally Yucca yucca!
Atmosphere pretty good.  Had the fish and chips, good portion and fresh cod. Had an early lunch so I can't comment about the atmosphere during busy time. Give this place a try, great location in downtown Chandler.
The mojito was good but it took a long time to get service.
Our service here was so slow, we thought we'd never eat. There was also confusion on the waiter's part about our orders. At least we sat somewhere away from the crowds.
This location is not a nice as the Saint Denis location, but the food is pretty much the same. Chocolate Chocolate and more Chocolate, if you go you must try the chocolate port, port and chocolate go so well together.
Got my phone repaired here and was stoked with the price. About a month later (after the warranty expired) I dropped my phone on my bed and the screen shattered. Tape sticking out all over. Just didn't look as professional as I thought.
The place was charming, and we enjoyed the food, particularly the brats and sweet potato fries, but to call it a serious restaurant is a bit much, since the fare is mostly pub food.  Our main objection is that the music is too loud and the sound system is terrible.
Overpriced and out of almost everything I ordered. Why didn't I just leave? Oh that is right, I was too lazy to leave Fremont. Face. Palm.
Premium price for a standard sandwich.\n\nWould have been an enjoyable visit had the deli guy been at least welcoming.
I walked into this walmart and busted up laughing 2 minutes after I entered.  Ghetto fabulous all around.  \n\nYea for covered parking, boo for not having the best food selection.
I'm glad I had a BOGO coupon! I will give this place another try if I have another coupon.  08/24/2013 Update - I have yet to return.
Hmm I was disappointed. It smelt of feet and the music wasn't great at all but maybe I went on a bad night. Blonde barmaid is super quick and efficient though, never waited more than a minute for a drink!
came here with my mom for my yearly smoked meat sandwich (visiting the parents, from san francisco, for the holidays). altogether, it did the job and satisfied my craving, but i've had better smoked meat.
Not impressed. Food was waaaaay too salty and bland. Save your calories and dough for the other great resturants in Vegas.
Totally disappointing, especially after dinner at SW the night before. \n\nEverything was pretty average. The short rib was one of the worst I have had. \n\nService was decent, but would have liked to have enjoyed the food. ;(
One of the slower Starbucks I have ever been to lately.  Are they union employees?  They managed to screw up my order too.
As with any other RadioShack, I can never find what I'm looking for. This place's employees don't even know anything about electronics. Surprises they're still open.
It was fun, but every plate was very very bland.  I was visiting for a week and decided to try this place based on the reviews.  Absolutely not worth the price.  The Foie Gras was the only thing worth anything in the place.
Terrible. Bad employee attitudes and lack of team work. The poppyseed muffin was so hard it crumbled into crunchy pieces. Wasted money. Went to Starbucks for lemon pound cake. ..yummm
Maybe it's just me, but it seems like the staff at this location isn't all that friendly.
This place is so gross but has a good comedy show.
Disappointed. Was recommended, was expecting so much. Was a bit dirty, waited ages to get served, so long we nearly walked out. Looked like loads of managers, no staff. Staff looked bored and poorly trained. What a let down.
I can't believe I paid over $13 for two milkshakes. Why would I do that? It's not that they were bad milkshakes, they were fine, but no milkshake is that good. Not in Gilbert.
This Sonic had good food (for a Sonic) but service was very slow.\n\nBe advised that they use fake whipped cream as a topping on their shakes and (presumably) ice cream.
Had the Orange chicken and garlic chicken and it's ok, I've had better.  Wouldn't go back.
Not worth the time let alone the money... Given I live close by I was really routing for the place and even went twice. Second chance was just as disappointing as the first.
Our breakfast buffet was disappointing on a number of levels including the absence of ripe fruit and no Chinese or Italian food. My huevos rancheros suffered from stale tortillas and overcooked eggs.
The staff is nice, but the clothing is super overpriced. $40 for a plain t-shirt? No thanks.
It's much too much in my opinion.  Long lines, big crowds, so much merchandise you can't digest it all.
The food was ok.. When they have it. I counted 8 empty pans. The ice cream was the consistency of milk. All this for $12.49?!!!!!! I got ripped off
The food was decent at best,  service was awful.  Lazy host, slow service,  mediocre food.  I would not go back to this location.  Management needs to work on the customer service for this restaurant!!!
It's okay.  The food isn't even remotely Irish.  They can do better.
Very disappointed in Aria.\n\n- $28 for any non-refundable charge\n- Overly engineered room. There are about 30 buttons to control the room. But, I cannot find the only one that matters : the lamp\n- The bed is too soft.
For the money spent (and lost) it simply didn't live up to my expectations.
Had a good experience. I had the hot and sour soup an the mapo tofu. They were great for the price just a bit to oily. Other than that It was ok. Good for the price.
OVERATED! Not impressive in the least bit. Nothing special, not fresh and the service was sub par. Wildflower is far superior.
I'm a sushi eater and the sushi here is terrible. Everything has crab meat - even a basic salmon roll. No asparagus or wasabi aioli, etc. Teppan was decent. No fancy show but not bad
Service by casey not so good food was excellent
Amazing Mac and Cheese Burger.\n\nDreadful Pizza.\n\n..There were ants on the table.
Went here for a last minute Mother's day trip.  \n\nThey were offering a special Mother's Day menu - not impressed.
It was okay. Nothing crazy. I mean all you can eat crab legs and oysters was my highlight.
I've eaten at PF Chang's a few times and it is always a C-.  I really didn't like any of the dishes I had this time and I think I have to remind myself that even when desperate and starving, I should find somewhere else to go.
Service - terrible; food - so-so; blonde waitress with a massive black eye - classy.
The waiting is too long!! They should expand their patio , offer a complementary drink if you wait is more then an hour ! Who waits an hour to go out to eat! This is the reason i dont come here. She wanted to come here!
The food is OK, but what do you expect for a chain restaurant.  The enchilada sauce tasted like it came out of a can.
I expected so much more. The food here was eatable, there wasn't much variety. The \"sushi\" was rice and veggie rolls. I'm not coming back.
This place is simply okay.  It's usually busy, especially for breakfast on the weekends, but I believe that is because there is a lack of options in town.  Nothing here is awful, but it's just not that good either.  Meh.
High on price and low on friendly customer service. Food is good but over priced. If paying for overpriced food, at least be friendly to your customers.
Gave this place one more try. My car waited 10 min after wash before any attendants started rewetting it and drying it. Skeletal crew. More expensive than other places so won't be coming back.
Not very good. My friends and I were hungry, and we mistakenly chose the first place we could find. All five of us felt like our burgers were dry, when we ordered medium, and that the buns tasted borderline stale. We all left unsatisfied.
The food here is mediocre. I can probably make the same thing I've had here at home. It's also way over priced. Don't waste your money on an easy Mac Alfredo pasta or a Las Vegas steak strip hard rock bread sandwich!
Awesome pizza but the service was horrible. It took over 20 minutes to get a glass of water. The couple next to us sat after we did but they got their water immediately. We will not return
The fish was fresh enough but the spicy crab roll was all heat.  Gyoza seemed overdone and the edamame was bland.  Service was good if you don't count the servers standing around the teppanyaki table chatting away.
get rid of the fries on the sandwiches and put the toppings on that i ordered
the food there was ok...\nBUT the place was dirty!! \nthe service was ok but it was sooo dirty also with the waiter's top and pants, YUCK!
Food is cold, over rated, not fresh and service isn't friendly. Waiters are always rushing you to order. This BJ's on this side of town is awful! Please get better management.
Server could've been more attentive.  Sat in dining area instead of bar.  My steak too done.
Typical food. Nothing fancy. No frills. But nothing bland or horrible either. If you're just looking for a place to eat, this will do.
Loving Hut is ok.   Great that they care.  Their heart is in the right place.  Food is average - frequently processed and over-salted.  Nice atmosphere.
Food just ok for me. I had a savory crepe with ham & cheese. Wasn't great. I'd like to go back & try a dessert crepe next time. Dim lighting, cool, calm & classy interior. great place for a date.
Rookie place. If you don't care about decor go to US Egg around the corner. Better service, food and coffee. Bacon took 25 mins to cook bad pancakes and serve cold coffee by a very annoying waitress.
I very rarely give a bad review but I HATE being ignored... I tip a lot \n\nBig mistake, huge.\n\nAh, well I'm off to find another place to spend my $$ :)
The concept is great and the raw foods are very good.  But it all falls down with the service.  I've experienced long waits here.
It's just your typical Starbucks, nothing special to report here.
No, No, No.\nI was expecting far better. While the service was better than the meal, I must say all I was, was disappointed. Tinoco's has become similar to a diner, with better than the average diner's pasta.
One would think when there are only two other groups in the place they would get the order right but once again another place who seems to be lost in the service department and the food was just OK.
I have been here before and always enjoyed the coffee.  Today went with some friends and we all made a comment about the bad attitude of the staff.  The girl at the register was rude.  I do not think I will be going back anytime soon.
Paid top dollar to play in the morning, the greens are garbage, punched , slow , poor shape. Why pay to dollar for poor conditions
Tater tots and cheese with pretzel are great. But since the management change and name changes wow has the quality gone downhill. Live in the neighborhood and all this is good for now is a beer and watching football. The food and service just is so disappointing.
Very hard to get help or information. Most of the thirty workers are busy talking to each other than helping you. Does not know where or if they have a product or not. Asked five different people and non of them know what kind of specials they had for Veterans Day.
Nice place to talk and hang but service is poor, food is overpriced, wine is mediocre and we generally felt unwelcome. Hipsters would like it probably.
Crap, bad food, overpriced, and the worst service. Didn't know such a mediocre restaurant could even exist at a 5 star property on the strip?! Ugh!!!
So disappointing. The space feels like a cafeteria, the food is underwhelming. The food looks good, but not the best quality. Very good service however, and I sure hope for everyone's sake employed there the place is reworked.
Not my favorite buffet in Vegas. The price was pretty similar to The Wicked Spoon but half the selection and quality. The service was also disappointing. The plates were still left on the tables after coming back and drinks were not refilled. Felt like a cafeteria.
Waited for ever for the host to appear. Never did. I had to walk into the restaurant and find myself a table. They need an complete overhaul of their staff. \n\nFood was standard thai. It was ok, nothing great though.
The food was actually pretty tasty but the service I received spoiled the whole thing.  In this economy I'm not spending $8 on a 6 in. sub to be treated rudely.  I can go to Port of Subs or Capriotti's to the the same quality for less.
I really hate cold buffet food. Nd today all items were cold. Maybe we arrived too soon after opening but we had to leave and I asked for a refund. I was given a gift card for a return visit which was nice.
There for lunch and am not impressed.  The burger was fine, but not exceptional.  The service was slow and sloppy.  There were two people in the restaurant when we arrived, they left and two more came in, so it certainly wasn't a busy lunch hour.
As others had mentioned, it was just ok. Needed some food during a long layover, so it did the job. Nothing spectacular. Nice slide show of Sammy though, and nice memorabilia.
This place seems like a tourist trap. The food was not great. Wish we had gone somewhere else.
Went for the first time last week.  Great patio.  As far as food, only had nachos.  Wow I cant believe restaurants use cheese wiz.  Come on lets use some real cheese please !
CLOSED - Sadly Cafe Krishna's service went down hill in the last few months and they have now closed.  Hopefully the replacement will be as good as Krishna was before the change in staff.
I have only had the pizza here.  Did not impress me, just fair to average pizza.  I have no plans to try it again.
Diner food done at a typical diner level.
I'm sitting in here right now trying to work and they are blasting Glenn Beck super loud. Ay yi yi. Time to leave.
Service is slow, drinks are nothing to write home about.  I wanted this place to be so much more but it fell short.  \n\nI always want to try to try out coffee and drinks from other locations besides Starbucks, but it seems this place is just missing the mark.
Hole in the wall with mediocre food would not go back!
Soup watery. Food mediocre. Salad was pure vinegar.
Very average. Food was overdone and waitress stopped chomping her gum only long enough to take our order.
Nothing special here. Food was average at best. The wings were okay, how can you screw up wings???
If you have a choice, go to the one downtown. I always get the buffalo shrimp, but at this Majerle's the coating was too thick. Not to mention, our ice tea tasted like dirt and service was horrible.
Honk!  What a difference of opinion from the reviews read before patronizing this salon.   No one wants to go into a salon and come out looking ten years older sporting a style that is tired and not becoming.  Not a fan of the product or the attitude; won't be returning.
Nothing special. I've had better chicken, fried okra was not crispy, corn bread ok I guess, Waffle House waffles are better. But the fried chicken gizzards were excellent.
Food is okay but a Lil overpriced.  How do you go from 6.99 sandwich to adding $5 more for fries and a drink?  I could've got a crispy chicken sandwich from jack in the box and still be satisfied.
Was very disappointed. We have frequented this restaurant before and decided to go for date night. Food came out way to fast and tasted like it was from old supply. Chicken was rubbery,meatballs not done,bacon dates tasted mushy. So sad we will not be coming back.
There pizza is average. The customer service us sub-par and if you enjoy ranch or any extras bring your piggy bank.
Mediocre pizza.\n\nOrdered pizza for the Super Bowl and they only had half our order ready 40 minutes later. Pretty much ruined our party. We'll get our pizza from some place more reliable next time.
Staff was great...food was average at best.  Not much more to say...
If you are thinking about going here because someone told you it's like Chipotle but better... they lied!! We went at about 8pm the meat looked old, they charge extra for peppers... The freshness you would get from Chipotle was lacking.
Just got out of work, decided I'd go to Carl's. I order my food and its descent. But what really made me give the place two stars would be the service. It was horrible. Never coming back to this location.
No reason to waste a meal here if you're visiting Montreal for a few days. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't all that good. The place was filled with tourists (myself included) and the service was understandably indifferent. Felt like a wasted 2 hours.
Trying too hard to be upscale, with none of the effort you would expect to accompany such high prices and professional demeanor. I don't mind paying more for quality, but the only thing that was 5 star was the view and the price.
Over priced! Terrible service! Not worth the trip- go somewhere else...
Todd was a terrible bartender and ignored us the entire time we were at the bar.  He seemed to be very friendly to everyone else but walked by us each time.
Not worth the money. Food isn't great. Service is alright. Can get more bang for you buck else where.
The atmosphere is excellent if you're into sports.  But the food and service need much improvement.
I hate how they just stand around and let you bag your own stuff, even when they're not actually DOING anything!
Sub Par for a Westin restaurant, breakfast buffet was free which was the correct price.
This 24 Hour location is really busy and the equipment is worn out. I did not like this particular 24 Hour.
Not bad. A little pricey but what do you expect, rent there is probably a bazillion dollars. The Chai was OK but the Granita looked like shaved ice after a few sips.
Stopped in here for a few drinks on a Friday night at about 11:30, it was pretty dead considering it was a weekend. Cover charge was outrageous. I don't think we'll be going back.
Great food Horrible service.
Ugh the rudest cashier never spoke a word not even a hello she thru my stuff into the bags and just stuffed it with anything and everything. Ruth your a rude person
if you want a cheap hotel, go to excalibur, tropicana is declining big time, I stayed here a couple of years ago and it was adequate, I went last week and now it's supergross.com.
Half of my kalbi was cold and the solution to the problem was to order more and get I would get a little extra? No thank you. Portions are even smaller when ordered to go as well. What happened to this place?
broth is too salty.  beef in pho not always fresh.  spring rolls are not very fresh. i've eaten here 10xs. go to tea light if u live in north phoenix.  i've given up on this place.
Service was slow and the bagel sandwhiches were lacking.  Plus they did not have any of the special that they were advertising.
Overpriced and under-fun. This was more trouble than it was worth and the \"crime scenes\" were G-rated and boring. Probably OK for kids, but if you're over 12, skip it.
The service was outstanding. The food not so. My \"firecracker\" (wontons fried with fillings) were so overcooked they were hard and like rubber, the burn taste ruined the meal. Good service and great coffee but I will stick with Macaroni Grill.
Last two visits, very poor, rude service.  Very disappointing.  I will not be back for a long time, need to get the bad taste out of my mouth.
Caramel frap and hot chocolate were good but very disappointed in vanilla cappuccino half of the cup is foam and not a lot of vanilla.
Chicken kabobs were tasty, however the spinach wraps clearly tasted of freezer funk, so I ordered the orzo soup and hummus instead. The hummus was great but my soup had about three grains of orzo in it!! Won't be coming back.
searched this place before we go.went to this place with a friend.the food was ok service was ok,the place is ekkkkkkkkk... I would not go back again !!!
good customer service but overpriced low quality sushi.
Not impressed with my last visit. Pizza was not good and service wasn't either.
Decent coffee for what's located in a hotel that was off the strip. Without driving off to get Starbucks, this place is definitely liveable when you walk your butt down the elevators after a drunk night or a night of betting.
Food was fair, heavy on the sauce on our dishes and even the kids didn't like their noodles. Service was good, for the quality it was expensive.
Yuck.....why are their food cold?  Not 1, not 2 but 6 of us......\n\nI hope the one their are opening at LAX will be better than this one.
had a groupon and now kind of wish i didn't was hoping for a good dog but ended up with an upset belly
It ok not worth all the hype. No space look kind of dirty in the kitchen will never want to eat there again .
i oredered take out the other night, and they forgot to include the ranch and celery. Thanksfully i had some at home, but it's not the point. Over the years, BWW has gone downhill, and this location is no exception.
Just average nothing great you can get the same food in any bar around town except bagels you can get those fresh at smiths if your hungry and have no other choice here's your place
Whatever Mexican food and crappy service.  Go find a million better restaurants on the strip.  They also charge for the chips and salsa.  This place will be gone within the year.
Seriously underwhelmed.  Great location on the strip but goes downhill fast.  Bad margaritas.  Very bland food.  Overpriced because of the location.  With all the Vegas food options, avoid this place.
Not worth the waiting,\nand they let our girls in first.\nPretentious bastards!
Very slow service(50 minute wait).  Did not get us kids menus.   Salad had brown lettuce.  \n\nThis is not a good place to take kids.
Jambalaya was very good.  Crab cakes so- so.  Not bad.  Not great.
First time here, the food was good. Second time here, it was okay. Now, not so much. Doesn't seem fresh. Everything a bit flavorless.\n\nWon't be back.
Took over 10 min in the drive thru. ..1st time at this location.   The woman who took my order would not let me finish speaking long enough to get understand my order... get it together DD...
Guy who did my nails did a horrible job. They looked awful. He seemed to be in a hurry and it showed. Definitely the worst full set I've ever had. This place is always too crowded and loud.
Thought we would try it as it just opened. Food was good if pricey for Mexican (3 tacos $12.95). Extremely noisy. You cannot have a conversation ..just eat and out the door. Don't think I would make a point of going back.
Terrible Prime Rib. But the drinks were good and the French Onion soup was pretty tasty.
Their dumplings are great. But everything else tastes like something you could find in the freezer section at the grocery store. Not to mention we waited over 30 minutes for our to-go order. I would understand if it was really busy or something but we were the only ones there.
WORST PULLED PORK, EVER!!  Didn't touch it...complained to manager...still for charged.\n\nDecent collards, however.
Overall just not that great.  I got the fajitas and was not impressed.  Service was slow even though they only had about 3 tables to wait on.  I won't be going back - wish there was better Mexican food in Gilbert!
This place is overrated.  It was fine but not at all special, not a single one of the dishes we ordered stuck out to me as being especially good.  Sorry.\n\nConsidering how many great restaurants there are in Vegas, there is no reason to come here.
The food was excellent but it was very expensive for the portion sizes. For three of us at lunch, the bill before tip was $105 & we didn't even have drinks. Service was good too but again I can't justify the price.
Not very fresh. Rice was hard. Beans crusted over. Taste was ok. Maybe it was a bad nite but the service was also uninspired. With many other burrito options no reason to come here.
Gold's is a nice lounge, but there is something missing from this place that makes it kinda blah over all, but was a nice place to grab a quick drink with friends.
Nice facilities. Line guys are awesome, desk staff not so much. Fuel is uber-expensive, but ramp fees aren't too bad if you don't meet minimum fuel requirements to waive the fee.  This is what you get when there's no competitors on the field.
The service in this place sucks! The waiters are freaking rude! They really need to learn how to behave with customers. Apart from the wings, this place is a hell NO!
Service was good but definitely don't order a bagel especially if you are used to having one at City Deli or Bruegger's.  Ice Cream was yummy.
Stopped in on my way to work to grab a coffee & they have 2 cashiers and only 1 guy making the drinks...WTH??!?? Super slow!  This location is not recommended if you are in a hurry!
I had an inspection and oil change. There was only one guy working alone and he communicated like a cave man. I will not be back.
As a grocery store....it's ok. What really surprised me is when I went to their meat department looking for knockwurst. The guy in the meat department didn't even know what that was and referred me to Harris Teeter. WTF?????
