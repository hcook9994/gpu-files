12,"Perfect atmosphere. Best BLT, fried pickles and pasta salad(with Stevie's dressing.) One of my favorites in Charlotte.",5
13,Order the Black Cod Miso! Hands down the best fish that I've ever tasted.,5
14,Always a favorite,3
15,Grade: C-\n\nI really hope that was chicken in my Chicken Lo-Mein. What happened to this place? What a dump. Good service but I kept wondering how old the huge mold stain on the ceiling was.,3
16,Just have the cake.,3
17,Great food.,5
18,Too pricey and not kid friendly,3

21,Food was good when it finally came.  Portions were small.  They had no staff working.  Waited 20 minutes to place drink order.  Probably will not go back.,1

25,"It's subway, it's consistent, its cheap...",3
26,"Food was unreal.  Was in town on a business trip and this was a home run for a quick lunch.  I usually dip my fry's in ranch, and this was the best ranch I have ever had. Beef was pure and cooked perfectly.",5
27,Don't get the godfather you will be on the toilet. Been on the toilet for an hour already. Tony your restaurant is going downhill.,1
28,"Not the best or least expensive option in town, but the avocado enchiladas are a light modern twist on a classic dish. Mi Gusta",3
29,Good music and dancers on Thursday Salsa & Club Night.,3
30,"Love, love, love this LV store ! The people were very friendly and helpful, not snotty like you might find in other LV stores. The sales associate went out of her way to help me find the perfect wallet . Sssooo pleased with my purchase !",5
31,"Really, really cute but way overpriced. Love the clothes though.",4
32,Nothing at this location.  I would rather go elsewhere in Queen Creek.  It is not worth coming here.,2
33,"My favorite grocery in the area. Staff is friendly; and they always have great deals. You can get sandwiches made to order too, which a lot of people don't realize!",5
34,"The food is good and teppan is always fun.  I like the pink rice they make on the flat top, too.  Even though their tricks are the usuals, they're still very entertaining.",3
35,I rated it lower because its in the middle of a dirty hotel that smells. but the pastries are yummy and staff are nice. Still overpriced like the other local ones in the area.,3
36,"Nice employees, nice location, Awful sushi.  Should have known something was amiss when it was empty at 6:30 on a Friday night.  Surely there are better places in town.",2
37,"Love this place!! I love that the pizza design your own at the same price. No up charging. S'mores pizza for dessert is a must!!! Fast, hot, and fresh!!",5
38,Good food at a reasonable price in a very comfortable setting overlooking the strip.,5
39,"No oysters in their AYCE Sushi dinner menu! Try the spicy seafood salad.. you can get a half order, you'll like it!",4
40,"Yelpers are correct! This place is something special. The food is delicious and they have great customer service. The fusion tacos, fusion flautas, bulgogi plate and fried rice were sooo good! Will definitely come back the next time we're in Vegas.",5
41,Terrible service. Our waiter was offensive and bad at serving the drinks the customer ordered,1
42,best. burger. in. the. world.,5
43,I thought my salad was disgusting.  I had chicken on my salad and I thought I was chewing on a chicken foot....Yuck! There was almost no lettuce mostly black bean juice and gristle.  I will not go back again and I suggest you don't either.,1
44,Yuk. not very tasty at all. only good point was that the counter guy caught that they had missed the bacon (if you can call it that) on hubby's burger.,1
45,"This place has EXCELLENT food, with generous helpings!\nMaybe that's why in the AM it usually has a bit of a line.\nI've never been disappointed, and the prices are very reasonable.",4
46,"Tasty, well-priced Malaysian cuisine unfussily presented and served in next to no time.",3
47,I've never had a tough time checking into Sky Harbor.  I do have trouble picking people up because I don't read the signs correctly :)  If my flights delayed I know that I can chill at one of the great bars they have in the Terminal 4.,3
48,By far one of the best buffets in las Vegas!,4
49,"Tried the Fajita Chicken and Beef mixed, is one of the best I tried. Other foods though are OK. Servings are huge!!",3
50,"Love this place, great beer selection, appetizers are as big as full meals and staff are friendly and attentive. Great place to stop after work. Happy hour could be a bit more generous but oh well.",5
51,"Great place to go to especially on the weekends, Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays.  Line can be long, but if you know people, you can pretty much just get in before other people.",4
52,no microwave or fridge; kind of weak A/C; no ice machine on second floor; ghetto part of town.,2
53,"Overrated. By serving everything tapas-style, Wicked Spoon has essentially increased the surface area of all dishes, allowing for maximum heat lamp dry-age. Yay.",2
54,"Outstanding customer service,friendly and knowledgeable staff,best prices around.\nIf you shop elsewhere,you are a bad person,and should feel bad.",5
55,"Had lunch here today. The service was extremely slow. It took several minutes, I'd guess about 15, for someone to take my order, and then another 15 or 20 minutes for the order to get to my table.  The food was very good but don't be in a hurry.",2
56,"Best bakery, very awesome atmosphere.",5
57,We ordered the Chicken panin and Tuna. What a waste of money. Awful! Will never return.  Paradise is 1000 times better.,1
58,Good food. Great location. Good service.,3
59,"Will never go back, Have been here twice, what a mistake. Expect to send your food back when it comes out. Burgers were burnt , Soup was cold. Everything is loaded with salt. Awful food. Cosmopolitan staff doesn't care if you complain about it",1
60,"If you have patience, this place isn't too bad. Ramen is good. Be sure to order the honey toast for dessert. However, it took another 20 min to come out.",3
61,My family has been using this dental office for over 10 years now!  The staff really cares about their patients. I love this place. Not a fan of getting dental work done but I surely wouldn't do it anywhere else,5
62,Pizza is very good!  Patio is nice and well shaded.  They will allow pets on the patio if well behaved!,3
63,"The folks running this place remain enthusiastic and friendly, but the food has become a bit too sweet, even the savory dishes are much too sweet. It is too bad as I really liked the food the first few times we went.",2
64,"The view is absolutely amazing, as is the staff! We went to see the High Roller about a week ago and we were not disappointed! Go at night. It's worth the extra money and the lights are spectacular.",5
65,"Horrible breakfast. Leathery eggs, razor-thin soggy bacon, COLD breakfast potatoes and only one slice of barely-singed toast. Staff was lackluster and kept forgetting items. Maybe their pizza is OK, but best avoided for breakfast.",1
66,OMG....  By far the best food I have ever had.,5
67,"Good food, great prices, good service.",5
68,Don't waste your time.  They don't listen to your order and then give you attitude when you question them on accuracy and quality.  Chick with tats and piercings is rude and arrogant.,1
69,"I was not a fan of the psychedelic \ng strings, the neon electric pants , the store doesnt \nhave nothing nice  unless you want to wear a tutu and some crazy ass pants",1
70,"This is a hidden gem in Mesa.  It was one of the best Thai restaurants I've ever eat at in my life.  Not only was the food excellent, but the service was superb.  We were able to get the flat noodles and also a rice dish.  I cannot wait to go back.",5
71,"If you're a cupcake fanatic like me, you'll like this place!! Tried their red velvet cupcake (which is as big as a muffin, but very moist & awesome frosting. Gotta try this place!",3
72,Oyster shooters in a plastic cup. Looked a little dirty. Shooters just tasted like ketchup.,1
73,"Helpful staff....thanks, Manuel. Quiet haven, inexpensive meal. But, dammit, a marguerite pizza is NOT supposed to have sauce on it. Hence the three stars.",3
74,Service is hit or miss. Pretty typical of a small nail salon. Shirley is fantastic..I'm not sure what to say about some of the other nail technicians..they've always done a consistent job with my manicures and pedicures but bad attitudes can definitely ruin the experience.,3
75,Service is terrible. Server literally came up to the table and said you ready? We didn't have water or anything. He didn't bring water for another 10 min. I'm forced to put 1star but I would be 0 stars if I could. Service first!,1
76,"The bathroom is disgusting, it should be check on regularly, especially when there are 3 of you working an no one actually doing anything and you're not busy.\n\nAs far as service and product, it's Starbucks.",1
77,"Compared to other options in the area, Brewskes is just a dated, overpriced dive bar.  The Menu has improved, but everything else (including the atmosphere) makes you wonder how they can justify chrginng the prices they do. There are much nicer places.",1
78,All our food was bland and burnt. 2 nights in a row. Probably cuz we stumbled in past 3am. But still. Come on.,2
79,"No matter how any times they tell me that this is the friendliest airport over the PA system, it still doesn't make it true..\n\nThe good thing is that the security lines are short the majority of the time.",2
80,Only good for girls. They treat guys like shit until they buy a table. This club is not a hot club so unless you roll with a bunch of girls don't even bother.,1
81,The rooms are nice and good. The staff was friendly.  It is a nice place to stay. It can be pricey but one of my top hotels on the strip in Las Vegas.,5
82,"Be careful if they walk around with a pan of cupcakes offering them.\n\nyou may think it's a nice gesture from the restaurant, but if you take one, its $2\n\nTotally uncool.",2
83,"Just opened and their service is dialed in. Great, fun atmosphere. Food was really good. Portions were big. It's obvious the employees love working there. Keep up the good work!",5
84,"We stayed Downtown Phoenix and took the light rail to the Sun Devil Stadium, with a quick stop for the bars on Mill. Couldn't have been easier!  No parking or traffic worries. Also didn't have to worry about having a drink. Easy, fast and trouble-free.",5
85,Awesome breakfast! Great service! I had the chili cheese omelet. Best omelets around. This is my new favorite place for breakfast!,5
86,Food is great and so was service. Wings plump and juicy,5
87,"One of the best Chinese places in Arizona by far. Independent from the other Chen's, this one seems to focus on the eating experience. Decor and customer service is a A+ in my book!\n\nWill be back!",5
88,Dirty location and very high prices but they do have great daily specials.  The employees were nice but I won't be back to this location.,2
89,Fantastic!! Love the Ramen! There's definitely a wait but worth it. Get the Gyoza and Miso Ramen. I get the Spicy Miso Ramen with extra bamboo shoots. Yummmmy!!,5
90,Waited an hour and a half for my 10 year son to get pain meds with a broken arm!!! Not acceptable! ! They won't even see you unless you check in at a kiosk,1
91,Food is terrible and the owner is rude. Very unpleasant experience.,1
92,They have good chicken and bomb biscuits when fresh. I just hate the service and paying for sauce. I mean I just bought a 12 pc bucket can I have atleast one sauce? I understand if I didn't buy chicken but whatever lol end rant.,3
93,"Delicious, Unique experience, great for groups or intimate dinners.",5
94,My favorite park! I love hiking up the hill and enjoying the view. The park is always clean and well maintained. My daughter really enjoys the water feature and playground here also.,5
95,Bad food and even worse service. Do not waste your time or money. I ordered the Cuban sandwich and it tasted like it just came from the microwave.,1
96,"Amazing happy hour and lunch menu! Good for date nights, groups, or families. Sushi is always fresh and tastes great! Drink deals are a plus with delicious green tea ice cream to end the visit. I highly recommend Yen Sushi!",5
97,"Dirty, dirty bathrooms.  If this is what your bathrooms look like I'd hate to see what the deli area looks like, or wherever else you store food products.  Posting pics of the bathroom and the hilarious sign regarding the cleanliness of bathrooms.",1
98,"Great meals,drinks and service in the bar. Happy hour until 7pm is a plus. We experienced none of the problems recently experienced by others, other than they were out of Corona beer. Nice change of pace from usual Westside restaurants and menus. Will return soon.",4
99,I have been here a couple times to eat inside their family restaurant.  They run a great business. Their food is great I love the yellow coconut curry at a level 10! I get their food to go all of the time. They are quick and easy to communicate with.,5
100,"This establishment has outgrown it's community, patients hidden in every nook & cranny.  Staff are knowledgable and friendly. The building it's self is extremely old and in need if repairs.",2
101,Place has great food! Service was slow due to how busy it was but well worth the wait.\n\nHighly recommended place for breakfast!,4
102,Great venue for music. The bartenders perform as if they've been beaten in the head with a club before work. I recommend bringing your own booze since it was approximately a 20 minute wait per drink on a Saturday night with no live music playing.,3
103,"Rebuilt after being bought from Joe Miller 2 years ago. Great stickie buns and good live music - piano bar, and fantastic views of Camelback Mountain, Mummy Mountain and the Praying Monk!\nFresh Fish and great Steaks!",4
104,"The ambiance at the restaurant was great.  \n\nI was a little disappointed with the mushroom purse, but that was probably because I was expecting something totally different.\n\nMy favorite was the kung pao shrimp.  Perfectly battered and well seasoned!",3
105,"Okay so as I was eating it I was loving it. So tasty...but then about an hour later I was sick. I won't give you the gory details, but I definitely won't be going there again.",1
106,"Yeah, this place has true Edinburgh grit. Stopped off for a quickie on way to hotel and stayed for dinner and the friendly company. If you are wandering down Rose Street, give this place a shot.",4
107,"Tried a green smoothie, the apple and greens. My smoothie was way to icy, i had to ask them to blend it again. Next time, I'll just order my goto here, the mango-a-gogo.",2
108,"One of the better values in vegas, this hip bastardized mexican place is pretty freakin good.  I got the baby back ribs marinated in some watermellon reduction.  Flan for desert was great.  1+ extra point for ironic  sexual innuendo in the name.",4
109,I went to Mimi's for breakfast/brunch and was diappointed.  The food was ok and the prices were a bit on the high side.  Service was decent but my expectations for this place were high and I was disappointed.,2
110,We came because of the great reviews.  Our server got almost every order wrong.  I give the one star for the chips and salsa.  I love good Mexican food.  This was not good at all.  I could not eat mine.  I will not try again.  The atmosphere was nice though!,1
111,"Stopped here to get a propane refill and the girl at the counter said no one was working who could refill it for me. \n\nHeads up folks, if you offer a service, you should train someone to do that service, even if it is the weekend!",1
112,"GREAT service! Such friendly staff. Tried Malaysian food for the first time, it was yummy!",4
113,Just like any other sushi place with a high pricing for the average quality,1
114,Closed (good riddance) and replaced by the Great Dane (much better),1
115,This place is GARBAGE. Food tasted like a frozen microwave food platter. Service was slow. I wouldn't recommend this place at all. Your better off going to Roberto's.,1
116,"This place is gross.  The tables are not clean and the staff is rude.  I watched them wipe thier nose and then touch my foood.  When I questioned this the manager said that the germs will \""cook off\"".  I left with trying thier food.",1
117,The Roasted Beef Steak tomato and the Spicy Tuna were amazing.  Heather and Cisco are great at the bar.,4
118,The staff here is extremely polite and courteous. I haven't been to a Einstein bagels in years I completely forgot how delightful the food is here. I ordered two bagels which only took about 3 minutes to make. If your looking for some fast service I definitely would recommend this place.,4
119,This is the only gas station I have every been to in my entire life to charge you to use your debit card and pump said they did not take credit. LAME. Poor beer selection. This convenient store is not very convenient.,2
120,"This hotel is a good value if you are just looking for a place to sleep. It's an older hotel in need of some repairs. However, the room was clean, the bed was comfortable, and the water pressure was great.",2
121,"Price is right, but you get what you pay for.",2
122,"Super yummy sandwiches and soups. They make all of their own bread, and have many original choices. The roast beef gorgonzola is awesome!",4
123,"Due to BPA concerns, I won't be getting hot sandwiches at Jason's anymore. All hot protein on sandwiches are heated in plastic bags. The club sandwiches are still awesome.",3
124,"Ate here for breakfast since we were comped coupons.  It was a pretty standard buffet, but for 3 of us to eat with the coupon it was like $10 so can't complain about the price.",3
125,"Cinnamon toast egg samich is good, but not sure about the sprinkled cinnamon and sugar on egg and American cheese. Coffee is great, I love this place they always get you in and out with out any problems",2
126,This place was gross. Spent way too much money for low quality food. My husband barely are his and they didn't even care.,1
127,"Nothing gourmet here, greasy fried food. Barely any crab legs.I didn't eat much and I kept throwing good away cause it was nasty. Save your money and go elsewhere.\n\nNot going there again",1
128,"Decent place, stopped by for dinner for a friends birthday.  \n\nFood was good, but the real winner here is the service!",4
129,not too bad. pretty big and open and theyve got good picnic table and grill areas. only downside is the screaming sound of airplanes from the airport. but my niece thought it was cool.,4
130,"The array of selection is wonderful. Fresh, clean and tasty.",3
131,The service was terrible. The counter help couldn't be bothered. I am from back east and a bit of a sub snob but this place doesn't even come close to good for az standards.,1
132,Not bad but definitely not great for the price and wait. The waitresses are nice but very inattentive. The dragon roll at happy hour had burnt eel and the sea bass took over 25 minutes to come out. Not worth my time nor my money.,2
133,Bad service. Bad food. Bad lunch for my 12/25. This was last year's 12/25 by the way.,2
134,I like this place.  Good service.  Food is pretty standard.,3
135,Great show. But we never had the sandstorm day replaced.  Bad Pasquale Rotella billionaire.,2
136,Everything is great but the staff! I've been there three times and every time I go the same girl is always working! Her nails are always very dirty... it is really gross.,3
137,"I want to hate you because you're a chain, but I have to adore you because of your tried and true familiarity. Bless you for having Southwestern Egg Rolls when I truly needed a snack to quell my wicked hangover before I took my 6 hour flight.",3
138,Delicious food....fresh....fresh...   Resonably priced.  Don't forget your punch card,4
139,TOTAL RIP OFF! We paid $14 for an 8oz margarita full of ice - wont ever go back - food was flavorless - this place has gone down hill fast - What a total waste of $$$,1
140,"It was a fun experience, I'm not sure if I'd go back because seafood isn't really my thing. Service was alright but had to keep waiting for a water!",3
141,So far. So good. I had a 12 appoint mention and they took me in right away. I just went to get a estimate of the damage and to see if I can get a check right away.,4
142,"Woah! $45 for a mani pedi, hold the phone. Wish they were worth every penny, but unfortunately they were not. Quite the minimal manicure and not so much effort in the pedicure. Definitely not worth the price.",2
143,"This is my favorite shredded beef taco in my area.  The rest of the food is just satisfactory, nothing special.  But, when I am in the mood for tacos, this is a great choice!",3
144,"stopped here cause we had a gift card.  Next time, I'm giving the gift card away.  SLOWEST service ever!  Drive 5 more minutes & go to Grouchy Johns!!",2
145,I was struggling between a 3 & 4 star. It was ok. Nothing happened to make it bad or great. I guess I would go again if I happened to be in the area.,3
146,"Had a firehouse hero sandwich and it was quite delicious.  It was a very flavorful sandwich, the prices were reasonable, and the people there are friendly.",4
147,I have been to this location twice in the past month and each time they mess up our order. Either they put two pieces of nuts I. A whole large ice cream or completely don't put in any item at all! I won't be coming to this location anymore.,1
148,But they are improving and the rodeo burger is back. Even with that though it is still the worst fast food around.,2
149,Friday night seafood................  all you can eat crab.  Yummy.  The selection was wonderful.  It was all really good.,4
150,This company is very unethical.. If you are looking to be treated like an idiot and not get your phone calls returned I would  highly recommend wardley. Thank god for Yelp AND THANKS FOR NOTHING WARDLEY!,1
151,"Nice decor, great service, very very mediocre sushi. Sashimi was OK but all of the rolls, from basic to specialty, were very muddled. Many other sushi options in CLT for WAY less $$$.",2
152,Have since tried almost all the subs on the menu... This is still my go-to place for a toasted sub!  Size of the sub is great and they make sure you will not be left hungry.,4
153,"Gosh, this place sucks.   Service was crappy.  Takes forever to eat.  Also, the chips were really thick and the salsa tasted like spaghetti sauce.  Far far far from the best mexican food I've ever had.  Felt like a rip off.",2
154,"Contrived, overpriced, soulless clothes, and a name, which in a desperate attempt to sound edgy, makes a schoolboy-level pun on based on the substance better known as gentlemens' relish.\n\nWaste of time.",2
155,I don't really like cold eggs. We waited a really long time for brunch and everyone's food was cold. \n\nTheir bread and raspberry beignets were delicious though.,2
156,"Yum, yum, yum!  And I didn't have to don my formals, either!\n\nNo items are bad here, and cheap too.",4
157,"Good chinese delivery. Quick, hot, lots of flavor. I'd recommend they use a bit less salt, as some of the dishes had a lot of it. Aside from that, good stuff.",4
158,"This is seriously the nicest and cleanest gym I have ever been to, not to mention with all the new machines and the juice bar which is a added bonus. The vibe here is great compared to other gyms here in Vegas.",4
159,Simple food and healthy.  Good stop for an easy good for you meal.,4
160,"Rooms are nice, but food and bar service is very very slow and takes forever! Will not order or eat here again.",2
161,When you installed my windshield you broke my chromatic mirror. My receipt shows you as Ultimate Glassworks Novus with same address. I have spoken with you (owner is nasty) and will pursue with all measures at my disposal. The date of the install was 5/17/2011.,1
162,Carne Asada was great. Drinks are weak. Chile Rellenos are the worst. Ever. Very bland restaurant.,2
163,The Frozen Hot Chocolate was bomb!\n\nespecially.. you know.. summer in vegas..,4
164,Not good Chinese food.,2
165,"OK, out of all the places I've been too, this is the most fun. So many fun and unruly nights here. And yes, afterwards was a buffets somewhere. So bad, yet so good.",4
166,This place for some reason... Always gets my order wrong. If it's not size it's the way my drink is made. Sigh.. Idk. I haven't been back in a while. Probably won't be either.,2
167,"Don't come here for the food. The beer is ok, standard Wisconsin bar alcohol selection. The servers are not too attentive.",2
168,"I can say that this sushi place is one of the best place i've been to here in vegas! Great service , Great food! Def coming back.",4
169,"Great location. Fine, not excellent, food. The oysters were phenomenal, but the special entree was disappointing...expensive and disappointing. Excellent drinks.",3
170,They finally followed up on this issue and my insurance company and myself were satisfied with the results.,4
171,The grossest grilled chicken salad EVER! Slimy chicken that is NOT hot and yellow lettuce!!! At least I have the croutons to eat.  I should have known better :(,1
172,An excellent place to go for a ice cream....   Great burger too....,4
173,Dirty and no service. Got tired of waiting and left.  I do not understand the great reviews.  Who knows maybe I went on a had day. But there were only two other tables and one had finished eating alread.,1
174,Easily the worst post office I have ever been to period.  Long lines and employees that are not friendly at all.  They need another post office in the centennial area of town to accommodate the citizens that live here.  One is clearly not enough.,1
175,"I just have one word to say... \""Expensive!\"" Food isn't that great, service is good and their Saturday night band is pretty good also.",3
176,I was going to mark this as a place to try until I read the rude responses by this owner to negative reviews!  I'll pass on this place. Sounds like food is primarily bland & don't complain about it! they throw you out?,1
177,good food and lots of it but its a bit expensive\n\n\n gift shop is good though,3
178,"I love the atmosphere and the food was great, you get to sing and dance there if you aren't shy.",4
179,They are ok.  Tried to step out of the box.  Got the Banana/Peanut Butter. No good. Cake wasn't fresh.  Only ate half of it.  Will make sure I ask which ones are the freshest. ??  Hope that the other flavors are ok.,2
180,I came out from California and was looking  for good Mexican food. What I found was a diamond in the rough. The tacos were great. The staff was on point and did a great job. Will be coming back.,4
181,Pool was cloudy and murky. You have to pay $500 to sit on one of the big blue seats by the pool. Everything here costs too much money. The pool isnt even that great. I'd rather even be at the excalibur than here!,1
182,The food is damn good. I've been coming to this restaurant for years. I love thAt Kung pao chicken.,4
183,"I always go to Tutti Giorni when I want some cheap pasta....fast. Not exactly a gourmet's delight. But they deliver what you expect, cheap and delicious pasta....it sure beats eating at subway.",3
184,One of the better matinee values in vegas! White tigers...good magic...pretty girls...what more do you want in this town!??! Its the typical boxes and vanishes but he has a great act! enjoy!,3
185,After reading so many fabulous review I was let down by the food and experience. Not worth the 600 + that we spent. I also never received out golden tickets,2
186,"Walgreen's has the best nuts. However, they recently changed their prices and only give a cheaper, 2-for on the halves and pieces. And they upped the price (again) on the whole cashews.  I will be shopping elsewhere.",2
187,"Food are very salty! I prefer Bamboo Club in Scottsdale. Very bad experience, poor customer service. Staffs are not professional. I wouldn't recommended it.",1
188,"Too much food and not  tasty!,",2
189,"pros: Great place! Good organic food!   Enthusiastic stuff!\n\ncons:  High turnover rate, often new stuff is clueless and service could vary from good to bad",4
190,"Great place to hang out. One of my fav bars in downtown phoenix. great decor, great music and great drinks!",4
191,"We ate at Koji when we were in Vegas last week.   The food was ok, sushi was fine but not extraordinary.\n\nThe rice was piping hot.  \n\nThe service was chilly served with a side of indifference.",3
192,"$8 for a tiny sandwich with one egg, two greasy strips of bacon, and a stale muffin. They say it's pricy because they get it local? It has to have substance to be considered anything. So whack.",1
193,"As my husband so accurately put it while we shared a drink on the crappy patio, \""I've seen better ambience in a Chuck E. Cheese.\""",2
194,"A smaller buffet off-strip. Good place to come for cheap, typical american food. Not great, not bad. The restaurant is clean and the service is very good. Nothing spectacular to report.",3
195,Ambiance was nice. Steak (pecan sirloin) was tasty. Waitresses were friendly. However was not overly impressed with restaurant. It was indistinguishable from other steakhouses.,3
196,"Perfect for people watching, not crowded. Fondue tree is beautiful, but somewhat disappointing as we were expecting a traditional fondue service - the fondue is served as a trio of chocolate dipping sauces. Convenient location right next to the front desk.",3
197,Good food. \n\nAwful service stick to delivery if you have to actually deal with anyone in the store you'd probably want to punch them.,2
198,This is not the best pho in the Valley. I hate to write a poor review of a business but don't get your hopes up if you're a pho enthusiast.,2
199,I use to have my boots repaired at Jova's but they increased their prices so much I stopped.  Does pretty good work but have out priced himself!\n\nThere are other Boot Repair places in Las Vegas that do just as good work at much lower prices.,2
