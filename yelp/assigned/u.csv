23,Our favorite Greek spot in town. Best fries on the planet!!!,UNK

28,I spend too much time here. AMAZING atmosphere and bartenders,UNK
29,Best mexican food by far in las Vegas. I love their veggie burrito and when ate mat the chimichanga couldn't be messed with. the food is sloppy yet organized and the portions could feed a lumberjack.,UNK

37,"This place always has great food and great service.  Last night I had the Basil chicken, Thai hot, which was very good.  I would eat here everyday if I could!",UNK
38,This place is great for families and large groups. Also great place for quick eats for lunch or dinner  They always have a variety of pizza on the buffet but if you do not see your favorite pizza they will make it for you.  The employees are always friendly and helpful at this location.,UNK
39,The food was pretty good and very reasonably priced. We had a couple sushi rolls with some chicken curry. Everything was solid and I'll be going back for sure.,UNK
40,I went here in July while visiting Arizona. Being vegetarian I had to check this place out. I ordered a large hummus. I was short on time but within 10-15 minutes received my food promptly with great customer service. I recommend this place.,UNK
41,Nothing to complain about here.  Quick service and the order was correct. A typical McDonalds and it was fairly clean.,UNK
42,I'm bumping up to 4.5 stars for the availability of ground ghost chilis...my mouth is watering as I type this. Nom!,UNK
43,Holy crap this mountain is rough. Made it to the top but now gotta go down. Don't need jabz leg class today,UNK
44,I can't comment on the food. We never got food or drinks or had a waitress acknowledge us after sitting there for 20 minutes. I won't be going back to try the food.  They blew it.,UNK
45,O.k BBQ ...we had sausage and BBQ sandwich as well as a burger they were all pretty good my favorite part of the meal was the bbq nacho for a appetizer ...,UNK
46,Great service! Prices were very reasonable and they were ALL so friendly!,UNK

48,The best show EVER!!!!,UNK
49,Oh jimmy johns...how I love thee. Let me count the ways...,UNK
50,I was very happy with my calamari taco. It had just the right amount of flavor and it was a nice break from more traditional seafood or Mexican. I'd probably go back next time I'm in Charlotte.,UNK
51,"The food is overpriced and not worth it and it's not a gaming bar. Can't usually find an open chair because non-gamers take them to watch tv, and there's no promotion for slot play. Seems like they could care less about your business.",UNK
52,"Jin Jin restaurant highly recommend, not that big, but the food are really good. We ordered orange chicken,Sichuan beef and seafood delight,which are all really good! Right choice to come!:)",UNK
53,Good beer and food!,UNK
54,Good breakfast sandwich!!!,UNK
55,"Take and bake sign was small and hard to see, out of towers , talked to staff about visiting nothing mentioned about cooking it, the establishment seemed to have some cooking facilities, but staff was no help, very poor questioner service.",UNK
56,"After the meal, I strongly suggest to try their deserts! Very creative and tasty!",UNK
57,Truly enjoyed thier food here.  Went with another family and got Parrillada De Tres Carnes.  I highly recommend- its now my favorite Mexican Restaurant in AZ.,UNK
58,Fair but not a four star salsa lacks a Mexican flare and the bean dip doesn't have much taste tortilla soup was fair ceasar salad okay dressing little thin,UNK
59,"Yummy!! The pizza is delish, the fried mushrooms heavenly, the carrot cake to die for and my family loves their wings!! I highly recommend!",UNK
60,"Great groomer, great pricing, they always go the extra mile. Our dogs doesn't play well with others but they always make her feel comfortable and take great care of her.",UNK
61,"Horrible service, whether busy or not.\nPizza is always limp, soggy or undercooked.\nBaked Tuna Sandwich is bitchin'.\nPizza Cookie is ok.\nGo to Scottsdale or Tempe location instead.",UNK
62,"There's a great selection of beers, and some decent bar food. All in all a little pricey,  but it's still a great experience.",UNK
63,"Unfortunate. I would recommend staying away from this place. The restaurant is not particularly clean, and the food is very sub par on many fronts; quality, taste and sitting time are a few points. Food from any mainstream fast good restaurant is about twice the quality.",UNK
64,"I used to live in Thailand, and this is one of my top choices when I'm on this side of the ocean. Friendly people and the most authentic Thai food I've found in Phoenix.",UNK
65,"All I ordered was onion rings.  What I got was barely heated frozen cardboard.  I asked for the check - waiter did not ask what was wrong, disappeared.  Paid check with cash, walked out.",UNK
66,Best FRESH Mexican food in the city!!!,UNK
67,"it was extremely loud and it took forever to get our food.  i'll try this place another time, but this visit wasn't up to par.",UNK
68,get newer seats. the seats ruin everything. so uncomfortable. its a nice idea having a home theater style for the public but the seats..,UNK
69,"Can't beat these prices anywhere in Vegas. I had the Earl club, and it was unlike any other sandwich I've ever had. Breads really soft but still crisp. Definitely a must if you're on a low budget.",UNK
70,"Poor customer service, and arrogant management. The cash registers also do not face to customer, so you cannot see the prices as they ring up the items, unless you go through the self check out lanes.",UNK
71,This place  reeks and they sell garbage. The only people I can see shopping in this dump are bohemian tree huggers who don't shower. The clothes are old and cruddy.,UNK
72,"Awesome pho, quick service and great staff.  The pho is about as good as I have had in Vegas or anywhere else.",UNK
73,"Great food, friendly atmosphere, gorgeous waitresses,  and excellent value meals! Breakfast menu is fabulous and I am now a regular customer. You have to try it!",UNK
74,"Awful pizza. Comparable to Sbarro's. Save yourself the time, money, and calories and go somewhere good.",UNK
75,"Great place!  I have been coming here after morning runs for years.  Coffee is always fresh, and they usually have a wonderful assortment of baked goods if you need something sweet.  The crowd is always friendly, and the service is stellar.",UNK
76,Horribly overpriced. $7 for 3 pack condoms lol?  Even in Scottsdale that's just not right. Go only if it's a dire emergency. Walgreens and Fry's nearby.,UNK
77,Very good delicious . Nice service fresh ingredients. Fair price. Good portions.\nDowntown Dan,UNK
78,Good massage and nice plunge pools but a bit pricey .,UNK
79,I would rate higher if they would just more than a .00001 inch thick slice of meat across the sandwich.  Subway is all bread and a total waste.  So many better places out there like Firehouse or Boardhouse!,UNK
80,Cannot believe how unhelpful and extremely rude the ladies were to me and other women here. They treat you like you're scum until you go to buy an expensive dress. Would never recommend this place to anyone looking for a nice dress shopping experience.,UNK
81,"What a show!  Great, crisp music and choreographed acrobatics.  Always something going on at multiple levels.  Sat in first row of 306 balcony section- more leg room for tall people and could see whole show without looking up.",UNK
82,I LOVE the orange sherbet! A couple of reviewers have mentioned that the flavors are more sweet which is my preference for fro yo. I have never been into tart fro yo.,UNK
83,"Good food, but I can't give it any higher than 3 stars because of the weird ass music the DJs play.",UNK
84,"We never see anyone eating here. We've eaten here a couple times (my kids like Pad Thai), and were always the only ones there. Food is below average.  It's a bit creepy being the only one's there at dinner time.",UNK
85,I can now said that I have been there. As a pawn shop its pretty boring. The prices are also high. I guess that comes from having a TV show. But I have to say the staff was nice.,UNK
86,"Love this place! Menu is huge and can make everyone in your group happy. Gluten free menu is awesome! Sports always on the TVs. \n\nGreat wine, beer, and craft beer selection.",UNK
87,"Beautiful, awesome, exciting, fantastic and wonderful scenery. This was the first stop on the club crawl tour. The music was great and did I mention how awesome the scenery is. Clean bathrooms and friendly club staff.",UNK
88,Everything was wonderful! However this isn't the best kept seceret anymore. hour wait min. so get in early!!,UNK
89,I'm not sure how you can call your place an English pub when you don't serve English beers. Bud light isn't an English beer. On top of it all the food was just ok. My advice pick another place to eat.,UNK
90,"Greek food was amazing! Wonderful service and help with exciting choices on the menu. Not elegant--authentic, affordable. Highly recommend, wish we could have returned before leaving Mesa!",UNK
91,The only good food I ever get are medium wings. I find that any Long Wong are the same and always enjoyed.   I have tried other items that I felt were poor.,UNK
92,Great service and tasty food.  YUM YUM YUM!,UNK
93,Life changing.  I literally cried.  I went in a bit tipsy and came out sober and awe struck.  Simply unbelievable.  Worth every penny.  Doesn't even need a story line for what these people are accomplishing in this show.,UNK
94,Love this place. This stop is a must on my way to work. Just wish there was one closer to my house.,UNK
95,"What can I say, awesome, probably one of the best pizza's I have ever had.",UNK
96,douche bag / meat head / christian audi gay / rhinstone / silver and gold foil all over my shirt / affliction / mr everyone is into mma / fuckin mo hawk / capital v neck central !!!!!!!,UNK
97,Poorly organized for a buffet.  People lined up like cattle in one long line for prime rib and seafood ie crab legs.  Food ok not awesome; question the $51 price.,UNK
98,"Way overpriced for shelf/canned food. Worst they don't even tell you that they charge extra for chips, guacamole, refills.",UNK
99,"Underwhelming gyro. There are french fries with it? First question: why? Second question: why are they not any good? I will say one good thing, it was cheap, and I didn't leave hungry.",UNK
100,Outstanding donuts.  The regular donuts are much better than Dunkin or Krispy Kreme.  The cake donuts are about the same.  Definitely our new go-to donut place!,UNK
101,we just went there to stay last night and when we checked in the hotel was under construction. It was a mess and we ended up leaving to stay somewhere else.,UNK
102,This is by far the best place to purchase anything for your home.  They have excellent customer service and not pushy sales people.,UNK
103,"Fresh, cheap & delicious. I wanna try everything!\nEasy to get to from the Metro and there's a lot of delicious pastries to try.",UNK
104,"The food is really great, but the prices are a little high. It can be a little pricey when you're ordering for more than one person other than that great place.",UNK
105,It's a stupid name but this spot was really good. Both the streaks and the sides were wonderful. Good service. Stylish place. Pleasantly surprised.,UNK
106,Had their pizza last night for my sons sleepover. None of the kids ate it and complained that it tasted metallic. It was indeed pretty horrible even for $5.99 per medium. We will never go near the place again.,UNK
107,"Great change of pace fast food, creative hot dogs, burgers. I'm full and very satisfied.",UNK
108,2nd time here in a week  The Chencho Fries & a Double Cheese burger !!!!,UNK
109,"Fantastic service did exactly as they said they would, and even gave a follow up call.  Mike is a great guy great to work with and most importantly the car is as good as new.",UNK
110,"Good BBQ I personally like meat serve without sauce, and this is exactly what they do, together with soft moist meat it is  great place for quick lunch (except lines ) but its actually best advertisement",UNK
111,First time there our server Reese was great she admitted she was new but she was very knowledgeable about the menu and specials been back twice since then but not the same service because we didn't have Reese gonna request her always,UNK
112,the crust is the best and i prefer to make my own pizza combinations as some on the menu are a bit non traditional for my taste.  the place tends to be loud however on weekends,UNK
113,Good New York style slices. Great for a quick lunch!,UNK
114,Worst service ever! Waited ten min to be greeted was never offered wine or dessert! Never received refills on drinks bread sticks etc took our server 10 min to come and check on us! Will never return to this location!!!!!!!!!!!,UNK
115,"Ads on tv brag about all the cheese and quality toppings.  What a joke.  They were fast and the counter lady very pleasant.  I would actually pay more for better ingredients.  But it will but not here.  They were not busy, wonder why.",UNK
116,Excellent Bloody Mary with extra spice to kick it up. Had the breakfast burro which was excellent as well.,UNK
117,"I am updating this review rating as the General Manager contacted me directly, so am appreciative of the outreach. Has anyone else tried? Let me know if I was way out of line with my review.",UNK
118,Personally I hate this location but sometimes I join others who go to this one. EVERY TIME I order spicy garlic wings it comes out tasting different I have no clue why and that is the reason I hate this location.,UNK
119,Sushi is decent but rest of the food is so so.,UNK
120,I got a great French manicure there! From out of town and kind of stumbled on it. Kinda nervous to do that but was definitely satisfied. Will go back whenever I can!,UNK
121,"It was alright. I set my expectations too high for my first time. It was good ice cream, just not what I expected. The employee that helped me was annoyed, but when I asked for help, she just looked at me. We'll see if I come back.",UNK
122,"Great food. Really great pizza.  My Italian friends eat here.\n\n If you are a Domino's person, this is not for you.",UNK
123,"Great service, good price and excellent food recommend you go here especially if you live close to this location. I go at least, 3 times a week and have never been disappointed.",UNK
124,Hands down my favorite Mexican restaurant in Vegas. The Service is always excellent. Food always fresh. I really have nothing bad to say about this place. Each time I always received the best food and service.,UNK
125,Just wanted to make sure their bad ratings stuck.  Terrible. I switched to Cox. Night and day difference. Won't be long be this place is out of business or bought out.,UNK
126,Decent food. Great location. Friendly service. Good booze. Simple menu.  Attractive patrons. Clean bathrooms. \n\nA good place to go if all the other restaurants in the Scottsdale Quarter are full with a long wait.,UNK
127,"I ate hear and the waitresses were cute but looked like they were on strung out on meth. The burger was good for the first 2 bites then the taste became very monotonous, I would not go here again.",UNK
128,"I took my two a bit difficult German shepherds in for a bath and nails and they did a great job. They also said my dogs behaved well. I'm sure they lied, but it made me feel good.",UNK
129,"Grandson loves the large burgers but I won,t go there unless we have a 2 for 1 coupon which they seem to publish often.",UNK
130,"Had a nice brunch on the patio.  Decor, servers and food were all spot on.  Menu had a good selection and food was very tasty.",UNK
131,"Every time I turn around, Charlotte surprises me with another gem; this place is cool!!  Def a bar atmosphere, but they have a really awesome patio.  Great food & even better beer selection; I love how they list their top-shelf booze!",UNK
132,When you go to bar you want a drink right?  Well what do you drink?  They have it. Hands down best beer/drink selection around. Staff members go above and beyond for any customer.,UNK
133,the only thing keeping me from raging on the employees right now is the insert of bread they  give you with your sandwich. enjoy over paying for a worse version of jimmy johns. dont come here.,UNK
134,"Prices pretty standard, ribs were tender but not very tasty, like they had been cooked on the stove not barbequed.  Relied on the sauce.  Staff was friendly, service quick.",UNK
135,"Perfect take out. Food tastes great. the mango chutney and all chicken dishes are to die for. Friendly people, great portions. Little oily sometimes tho.",UNK
136,This place has the special combination of spirit and good food. Great ingredients prepared very well and delivered with gusto . The place is also relaxed and conducive to casual chat and meeting new people. Will return another day.,UNK
137,Yummy chili cheese fries! mmmm!!!\n\nThe original burger was good too.\n\nNothing more to say though... this location tastes as good as any other Johnny Rockets.,UNK
138,"Food wasn't bad, but the service and price were. It shouldn't take 30 minutes and $16 to get a cheeseburger... seriously. I know it's part of a tourist resort, but come on... $4 soft drinks?",UNK
139,Just got back from the biggest waste of time and money I've experienced in a while. I pad nearly $50 for absolutely nothing to be done to my hands or toes. Don't waste your time here unless you want to leave with nothing more than an uneven paint job.,UNK
140,Best.pickles.ever!  The black bean dip is the best I've ever had as well.  Has a smoky/bbq-like taste.,UNK
141,Spent $140 on a mediocre meal.  My steak was not done right and was very tough on the outside.  Service was so-so.  I've had better steaks at Texas Roadhouse.,UNK
142,"Same story as everybody else. Waiting in a really long line, and only 2 attendants. They must not care too much about customer service around here.",UNK
143,Bar is okay and the atmosphere is nice.  Food is below average and pricey. Our food was cold and when we commented on that the sever didn't seem to care.,UNK
144,This place is a joke. Slow service cold food and it's like they took courses in airline catering out back. Beware. 5 star raters are from Midwest,UNK
145,"I revisited Wicked Spoon.  Sadly, although the service met my expectations, but the food was cold and seafood wasn't fresh.  Perhaps I came at the wrong time?  It costed too much not to be satisfied.",UNK
146,"The flavors and topping choices were great. If you control your pour and topping choices it is very affordable.  Beware, they have very large bowls to encourage you to take more than you really need.",UNK
147,Nice enough diner to have within casino... Pretty good menu similar to Cheesecake Factory...,UNK
148,"Really hoped for more. Not worth the extra dollars. Love the Mon Ami Gabi restaurant, but the hotel just didn't live up to my hopes.",UNK
149,"We received some mini bundt cakes from Nothing Bundt Cakes as a gift. The small size made them very cute, and the cake was moist, rich, and indulgent.",UNK
150,Solid Pizza at a fair price.\n\nI get this for work a lot and have found the quality to be consistent.  It's not the greatest pie ever but for the price it's good and the pies area good size.,UNK
151,First time in Vegas and this was an amazing restaurant half a year later craving it again. This is a trip making restaurant anything is good on the menu highly recommended.,UNK
152,Horrible service.  We went here after the opening party of Michael Jackson's show of Cirque.  Out of two bottles of wine we ordered.  Service took FOREVER!  Won't go back here,UNK
153,"Usually a SRO place on Friday night. We found the food to be quite typical TexMex, no zing for the palette. But hey, the view is great.",UNK
154,I love this place.  The waitresses are very attentive and the food is excellent with bountiful flavor.  I always get the pechuga asada but I have had several other selections.  All were excellent.  One of my top 5 places to eat in Phoenix.,UNK
155,The actual threading and price I would give 5 stars. The service and friendliness were definitely lacking. I called from a block away to ask if there was a wait. They said no. Showed up 1.5 minutes later and there were 8 people waiting. No acknowledgement upon arrival.,UNK
156,"Food is mediocre but the popcorn is awful. This is the only theatre that serves extremely salty popcorn. How do they manage to ruin popcorn?? Servers are a mixed bag. Few are good, others are sleepy. Don't go here for the food.",UNK
157,"For the amount of money I spend in this location I demand respect. These workers are rude, down right jack asses ( that's a donkey) I can not believe the way they treat people.",UNK
158,Good 50 ' s diner great food even late night. Fresh rolls on the Philly cheese steak.  Fries are nice golden brown.  That strawberry milk shake was not to sweet. It was just right.,UNK
159,Place has terrible parking.,UNK
160,"Good steak and wine, sat at the bar for a mandate",UNK
161,This is a great Pilates studio! I came on a groupon and chose to stay. The classes and teachers are great. You won't be disappointed I'd recommend this studio to everyone.,UNK
162,It was fine.  Most anything tastes good in butter.,UNK
163,"Place was not clean- tables were dirty, bathrooms were horrible. Too close for comfort at the lanes when bowling next to another family.",UNK
164,"The asada tacos are so good! The best I've had in Vegas. Just order them the way they come. Only $2 each, and the service was super quick even though they were really busy.",UNK
165,Ask for Kym.  Enough said.,UNK
166,Just alright.   BTW they did not honor the 20% off yelp deal either.,UNK
167,"For what people say about this place, I just don't see it.  I tried it and will not be back.  Too expensive for what is offered.  The wait is way too long and it didn't taste that great.  I would pick subway every day over this place.",UNK
168,I eat here a couple times a month.  Their steak potato and cheese burrito is my favorite.  I've also had the green chile burrito that is really good.  Always fast service and it's all for a good price.  This place is defiantly worth trying out.,UNK
169,Just walked out!  My son and I sat on the patio for over 10 minutes with NO service. I had to walk back into the building to get someone's attention. I have never had a good experience with Ihop and now I will never go back. I am forever boycotting Ihop!,UNK
170,"Heads up! Get to this place early if you want to eat there special.\n\n5 stars for great tasting food, minus 2 for and an unfriendly hostess.",UNK
171,"Service was ok and food wasn't any better.  The Orange chicken was ok, however the egg drop soup and fried rice left a lot to be desired.  Price is pretty good for a big lunch.  I don't think I'll be returning.",UNK
172,"This little charming BYOW had the best food I have ever tasted. I recommended this place to all of my friends who want to impress their first date. Service is great, and it's not that expensive for the quality of the food.",UNK
173,They are closing this location which is no loss. The service is horrible. I like grimaldis but this one sucks. Try the one at santan mall. Doesn't matter I suppose since this one closes in 2 days.,UNK
174,"Great resort for families. All the excitement of Vegas, without the casino.",UNK
175,Great inexpensive place.,UNK
176,Daughter loves the windmill. I love it isn't super crowded and has great shade,UNK
177,"Here for happy hour, it's mediocre at best. The cocktails are way to sweet.  The shrimp tempura roll was cold and soggy.  The gyoza were okay but only luke warm.  The pacific roll was good and the service was friendly.",UNK
178,"Terrible customer service ! Learn from your other stores  and Sweetheart you are an \""employee \"" not the owner",UNK
179,"The best place in town as far as I'm concerned! Peter is exceptional place is spotless, quiet and professional",UNK
180,It's getting better as the new owners remodel and get in some new tenants.,UNK
181,"great food, incredible portions.  they also have a healthy breakfast menu, which is great.\n\nlove their salads and happy hour menu.   Probably my favorite breakfast place.  Great french fries.\n\nwheat pancakes with fruit are incredible.",UNK
182,"Good, cheap, fast, and a bit messy eat for a quick lunch. The pork is very tender served piping hot with soft hot buns. Definitely recommend stopping by at some point if you're in Edinburgh for the festival.",UNK
183,"Probably my favorite brunch in Pittsburgh. The lemon ricotta pancakes are just wonderful, and the prosciutto and goat cheese omelet is fantastic. Often rather crowded, especially in the winter, but absolutely worth the wait!",UNK
184,"MIX 94.1 use to be my favorite radio station in Las Vegas, and then 107.9 came around. They play the best music and few commercials... and they do have awesome events!",UNK
185,The rest room smells bad big time! They really should do something about the smell.\n\nEverything was delish as usual!,UNK
186,I ran across this on my way to starbucks and was delightfully pleased! The crepes are just amazing - the best I've had since living in France!! The service was great and I would recommend this shop to everyone!,UNK
187,"While their sandwiches are tasty, there's just not enough for the price.  It's crowded and just not worth it when Quizno's and Subway are throwing $5 footlongs at your feet.",UNK
188,Terrible location. Dirty. When I went the owners children were in the kitchen eating and running around. Got home to find a toothpick cooked into my rolled taco. Got a refund but still very disgusted. I drive a little extra to go to a cleaner location.,UNK
189,They call people on the DO NOT CALL list.,UNK
190,"If you have Jodi Arias work schedule from Jan 2008, you should get them to Juan Martinez at the Mesa, AZ prosecutor office.   Justice for Travis",UNK
191,"The food was decent but not warm or hot at all. They charge you for things and don't tell you about it beforehand. The service is poor, you have to call them for service.",UNK
192,"Large portions, breakfast and the rest, 24hrs. Nice service moderately expensive. A New Jersey Diner transplanted on LV Blvd, but this one's in better condition.",UNK
193,We went here for a couple beers while in town for a concert. We ordered mozarella sticks and they arrived before we even had our first drink. The service was extremely slow and I don't care for half naked women. Maybe that is just me . . . .,UNK
194,Dont ever Fly US Airways to Hawaii. The Flight Attendants were rude and very unpleasant. Spend the Extra and Fly Hawaiian Airline.,UNK
195,"All I can say is \""disappointed\""!\nSmall over priced portions, and just so so. \nI won't be back. \nTry pizza rock, better pizza, larger portions, and cost less",UNK
196,I give this location no stars cuz they are horrible at there job took them 15 min to make a latte and my girlfriends iced coffee taste horrible!,UNK
197,"Just as good as you would expect. If you're in Vegas, you have to pay the Wockeez a visit!",UNK
198,Easy to make a appointment and really takes the time to get to know your issues and work on a solution that will get you back on your feet and not just coming back to him for more.  I trust him in and his knowledge.,UNK
199,I went here with 2 of my friends. It is clean and service was good but the food was disgusting. We all got different dishes and none of liked it. My sauce tasted like it was chef boyardee canned sauce. Would not recommend this place if you have taste buds.,UNK
200,Vig Uptown\nTwo comments:\nToo many lawyers and 60+ Cougars.\nAt least the cougars at Vig Arcadia are hot and 30-40.\nWhat can you expect on this side of town though....?,UNK
201,We loved our breakfast here. So fresh and flavorful! Coffee was excellent and that's coming from a NY coffee snob.,UNK
202,"What a great place. Fresh and healthy food and a wonderful atmosphere. I have eaten there 4 times in the last month and each thing i get is awesome. I hear they are adding new items all the time and always open for suggestions. Come on, help a small business out!",UNK
203,"I loved this place! Friends of ours took us here and the first thing I noticed was that it was clean, which is always a bonus. The women was very nice and the food was great. It tasted very fresh! Would make the extra 15 minute drive to pick this up!",UNK

206,"Last time I had Greek food that tasted this good I was at Taverna Katina in  Oia Santorini!\n\nHowever, this place is VERY expensive.",UNK
207,I have always loved this place.  Now even more since Tommy has become our favorite waiter!  Definitely ask for him.,UNK
208,Yes as good as it gets! Fantastico! Fabuloso!,UNK

210,"This place is kind of gross, however it hits the spot when you may be craving greasy mexican food that is cheap.  Stay away from the guacamole though as it is pretty gross.",UNK
211,Not as good today.  Service was not great and eggs and meat were overcooked.   Quality is slipping,UNK
212,Not impressed by this place! The whole place is ran by a bunch of teenagers who just dont care. Blizzards are lacking ingredients and not mixed well. Orders get mixed up and you end up with the wrong blizzard. I love DQ but I wont go back here.,UNK
213,Best store ever!  Service is wonderful.  Staff was so helpful  I would highly recommend Sole Sports to anyone.  Excellent!!  Awesome!!,UNK
214,The food inside victory cafe in the cannery is horrible ! Low quality food!,UNK
215,"Food is ok, service is hit or miss! Beef jerky us my favorite dish. Thai tea is not my favorite",UNK
216,"This place has great prices and a neat set up but it's always crowded and has a VERY heavy police presence. Now, I'm all for safety but I don't particularly enjoy feeling like a prisoner when downing drinks and playing darts. So three stars it is.",UNK
217,We love the popcorn here. Sometimes the picture isn't the greatest for the theater but overall we love to go here and get rewarded for our movie going so that is fun.,UNK
218,I love this place. Had a great lunch and watch Sex in the City here. It was a really good experience. I look forward to going back!,UNK
219,It's nice to see all the old signs. Learned more than I wanted to know about sign making. The tour guide was very informative.,UNK
220,"The hotel is Wonderful but when I went to their mc Donalds in the food court the managers were very rude, some of the employees were nice, food was ok, no $1 drinks though and only 1 refill",UNK
221,"Duke's is as bland as it gets:  boring beer selection, soggy pizza, zero atmosphere.  It is far more interesting to sit on your couch with a 7-up and a poached egg watching a Yule Log video than it is to visit Duke's Pub and Pizza.",UNK
222,The service of our waitress was very rude and not professional.  Sat for 20min never came back to take our order. Food didn't taste good. It was too salty.,UNK
223,"The check receptionist was \""OK\"", The check out receptionist was much more welcoming. The nurse was great and Jennae Porter PA-C was awesome! Would def refer and I plan on making this my Derm place!",UNK
224,"This is always a good place to go with family,  love the Royal hamburger and endless fries my daughter loves the mac and cheese",UNK
225,Mediocre for the price.,UNK
226,Go to the very bottom where is let's you see reviews that are not recommended. Those are the most truthful. DO NOT MOVE HERE FOR ANY REASON.,UNK
227,Some good sights seeing while at the stadium. Good view from where ever you sit. Had a great time inside and out during the recent Sevens Rugby tournament festivities. But it is old and outdated. OK at best. They should level it and put just off the strip.,UNK
228,"Beautiful venue. The ales are not my favorite though. Fortunately their machine is in place. If they start brewing smoother, hoppier IPAs and richer, bold Stouts, they could really make a big impact. They seem very popular nonetheless.",UNK
229,The place looks like a lot of fun. The food is above average for bar food. The patio and the outdoor stage make this place look like a lot of fun,UNK
230,"First impression not great, 6 minutes still waiting for coffee and I was only second person in here..\n\nTo long for coffee!!\n\nCool\nAtmosphere, staff maybe it to early very stoic",UNK
231,Amazing sushi. The place is pretty small but has a great ambiance about it. Reasonably priced sushi an it is presented very well. Will definitely come back anytime I am in Madison!,UNK
232,The food at least used to be good ... Now they changed ownership. Weird service remains but good food doesn't ...,UNK
233,"Quick, easy, yummy takeout. Try the veggie lo mein...",UNK
234,"House special steak was under cooked because it was cut thin on the end parts, thick midsection. Tougher than I expected. Salad & service was good. Appearance is good and clean.",UNK
235,Our favorite Mexican place around!!!,UNK
236,All you need to know is drunk people love the food.,UNK
237,Their king size bed is actually queen size. Room is tiny. We are pretty disappointed. \nOverall the design is very modern and nice. The griddle cafe is wonderful but long line in the morning.,UNK
238,Wendi our driver was great and showed up on time and made sure we were well taken care of. All details were confirmed by her in advance and I felt she made sure to keep in touch throughout the evening as to where she would be picking us up at the concert. I would definitely use them again!,UNK
239,I have eaten here several times. The food is good but typically the service is extremely slow. I would probably go more often but hate the thought of knowing I have to wait in line 10 or 15 minutes to place order and then another 15 or 20 minutes to  get food.,UNK
240,The salsa was almost tasteless whichvis stunning for a Mexican restaurant.  Once the main course arrived we still wanted to give this place a chance to impress. A simple taco and burrito still was not flavorful. Whether you're looking for authenticity or flavor this is not the place.,UNK
241,Man this place reminds me Ie le de cuca (brazilian place that burned down few years ago).. Kinda like u r down in Cuba or Mexico.. Awesome owner + awesome good + super cheap... Go u will love it,UNK
242,Our food came out cold.  I have a strict policy of not sending food back so ate cold lasagne.  Was still tasty.,UNK
243,"I just didn't like any of the beers.  We got the sampler and they were all really not very flavorful or good.  I wanted to like it, because microbreweries rock, but I didn't.",UNK
244,This place was excellent! We tried the Cajun shrimp boil and the lobster Mac and Cheese. Wine selection was great and the prices were very reasonable for the quality. Service was excellent. We will be back for sure!,UNK

247,"Amazing food, perfect balance of spice and flavour. A must try if you like authentic Chinese food.",UNK
248,Ihop in Vegas....still ihop.,UNK
249,"Impressed with this casino. It has been updated and though it is very \""smoky\"" the restaurants and buffet that is coming soon will make this a great place to stay. The rooms are well designed and upgraded. The pool area appears neat and clean.",UNK
250,"The staff here is great, but the layout is a bit odd. Ladies literally freeze their asses off in the winter just to pee! Small intimate venue, i do like that it has two different bars, and music genres.",UNK
251,The prices are high for the food they serve here. Clerk was kind of pushy and not that nice,UNK
252,"Place sucks, used to be great, it's not anymore. Owner thinks it's warm enough outside so heatlamps are not needed, who decides if it is cold. Owner or customer :(",UNK
253,"Wow,  spent $65 for breakfast. Service was poor, food was worst. It was disappointing. Bacon taste like .......nothing. pancakes was worst.",UNK

255,"Clean and quite! Dont miss the long lines and craziness that you get at the other theaters in the Valley. UltraStar is our new favorite place for movies. Have heard great things about the StarClass theater, cant wait to try it out",UNK
256,"This place is terrible. So bad we lied to get out of staying a second night. Light and air don't work. It's liken a renovated motel 6, so shitty",UNK
257,This place has horrendous customer service. Sat at a table for atleast 15min and no server came to take our order or atleast give us water. I never write a yelp review but this place is so horrible I had to.,UNK
258,My 4th time here for lunch. Delicious salsa! And the friendliest staff in downtown Mesa.,UNK
259,This is such a great little joint.  We hung out with a group for happy hour and the drinks were great as well as their appetizers! It was a great atmosphere! We will be going here when we go to Vegas.,UNK
260,"Save your money guys. This pace is well kept and clean but... food not so much, way over priced for the poor food quality/quantity. Your better off finding a taco truck near by or heck just goto Denny's, you won't be as disappointed there.",UNK
261,"Rude/arrogant staff: John (Johnny)\nShould be helpful of new comers that are just learning to admire this beautiful past time. \nInstead abrupt, arrogant personalities are abound in this overly priced location!",UNK
262,The Edamame Cashew Burger is amazing!,UNK
263,"I can only say that it was amazing!  I am a fan, and the service was really great.  I recommend trying this place if you like authentic Thai food.  I will definitely be going back.",UNK
264,"I was not impressed.  We were here with a group of friends and the staff didn't seem to care if they waited on us or not.  When our server did come around, he was friendly and seemed to enjoy what he was doing, but honestly, I've had better service at other places",UNK
265,"Great place, not a lot of parking.  We ordered a pizza and chicken parm.  It was really good food and the service was great.  We will be visiting this place again!",UNK
266,"I love this farmer's market! I hope more vendors will start coming to them and showing more diversity. But, no other complaints here. Most of the vendors are super nice, too.",UNK
267,Good environment. A more classy Chinese food place.\nmORE Expensive but better service.\nHas authentic stuff and americanized stuff like orange chicken too..,UNK
268,Overpriced. Bad service.,UNK
269,I purchased a voucher from fabness  and was having trouble. I clicked the chat button and was treated to a very rude customer service rep who did not help me and just disconnected me when I asked to speak to a manager. I will never order form them again.,UNK
270,Very friendly great customer service and fresh produce. Very convenient and affordable.,UNK
271,"Great little yogurt place.  At first I wasn't sure about not being self-serve, but it actually worked so that I wouldn't serve myself too much and wind up throwing yogurt away.  I like how they layer toppings for you and are willing to mix and match.",UNK
272,"Aside from the really negative party recruiter guy that kept calling me Tex and later took the drink out of my hand and chugged it, this place was okay. Had decent music, a decent open bar drink list. I wouldnt go back though.",UNK
273,M&m world is amazing usually my first stop every time I come to Vegas great souvenirs and they even have a free 3D movie that's great too you can even write on your M&M's!,UNK

277,Great food! Great atmosphere! Great beer! We will be going back for sure and brining our friends!,UNK
278,The staff was rude and the wifi is useless.,UNK
279,They have good deals goin on. Perfect for when you are craving bar food. Their artichoke and cheese dip was good! I tried the Asian wings and they had a nice tangy taste to it. Not as spicy as I expected it to be.,UNK
280,Je suis all\u00e9 plusieurs fois pour le lunch et toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s satisfait. Tr\u00e8s savoureux.,UNK
281,The manager Berry has no people skills or know anything of customer service. Just imagine a knuckle dragging guy who walks around with his mouth open and that's what you get to work with. They are selling second hand defective boots. Don't buy here!!!,UNK
282,The prime rib is outstanding. The price is high for the portion. The staff are very friendly and welcoming.,UNK
283,"The fries were terrible, there are no free refills, burger was just ok, and they have false advertising with the free milk shake!! Don't eat here ever!!!!",UNK
284,"The portions are big so split with someone, I had the Corned Beef Hash, the corned beef was so delicious.  Would go there again..",UNK
285,"Pollo fundido not good, Garcia's on 35th Ave way, way better.",UNK
286,"It's ok. Not a lot to say about it. Average food, average prices.",UNK
287,This place is disgustingly filled with flies everywhere! Not just a couple. Several hundreds of them. Some constantly buzz around you. And hundreds more just chilling on the ceiling.,UNK
288,Pad See Yew is the best!! The pineapple fried rice is amazing too.  If your nice David might even bring over some Johnnie Walker!,UNK
289,"I'm not a vegan.  I'm not even a vegetarian.  But I would totally become a regular here if I lived nearby.  Cheap, fast, very tasty, and the live music is a nice touch!",UNK
290,The ambience and place looks good. Lunch specials are worthy to try on week days. The sushi specials are simply awesome,UNK
291,"Nice. Great atmosphere!  We avoided to go over the weekend,  which it was a great idea!",UNK
292,I will never go back.  The sushi portions were small and expensive.  The food was mediocre at best . We spent almost $40 on an early dinner and felt like we were ripped off.  This was one of the worst sushi restaurants I have been to quality-wise.,UNK
293,"We came here for lunch while waiting for our next flight.  For airport food, it was pretty decent.  I wish that I had known that some dish already includes beans / rice such that I wouldn't accidentally an extra side of it.  The service was as expected for a busy airport food stand.",UNK
294,"Old furniture, barely working faucets, and got charged $20 per day resort fee without any additional services. Even newspaper that part of the resort fee was never delivered.",UNK
295,Way Over priced for small portion and terrible costumer service! Would never return. $70 lunch and they automatically add the tip which they don't mention for a server who stopped at your table twice and was to busy to refill your water glass! Thanks but no thanks,UNK
296,Been coming here for a while now it's very clean and the wait time isn't as bad as other places. However staff here is a hit or miss you never know how the experience will be,UNK
297,T and D sandy...Turkey is from grocery store but stuffing is the bomb. Try it once. Spinach salad huge and tasty:),UNK
298,"Good food. But the atmosphere is boring. The owners have no interest in incorporating culture into the restaurant, so they fill it with bad decorative art. The space gives no invitation to good conversation.",UNK
299,Food was very good! Great breakfast variety and lunch options as well. Love the dog friendly patio! Amanda was a great waitress! Very friendly :) I will definitely be coming back.,UNK
300,"SUCKS.    Dont know what I hate worse about this particular Walmart, the employees, the fact that there is NEVER enough check out open, or the face they have less to choose from than any of the other walmarts I visit.  parking is awful too!",UNK
301,I'm making my way down the curry menu and I haven't found a bad one yet!!,UNK
302,"Very clean, fast service, very nice employees and good subs!!",UNK
303,"Good atmosphere but food portions are light.  Put some food on that plate.  On a positive note, Dani is a great server!",UNK
304,"Some of the poorest customer service I have ever experienced, but the crepes and drinks were very good :)",UNK
305,"Kimchee Poke - rubbery\nSpicy Poke - good\nTako - ok\n\nGreat idea, but perhaps I was there on a slow day with not so fresh freshness.",UNK
306,There is no Sprint service here! The airport seems better than LAX,UNK
307,"The best donuts around!  Nice people, I love to stop in to see them, and their donuts are soooo good.  What a treat!",UNK
308,I took my family here the other night. All in all it was ok but not great. The service was good. The food was average but not great. I've been to Indian restaurants all over and have never been charged extra for rice? 4 dollars for a small bowl is just not right.,UNK
309,"Good food (best cheese enchiladas), but please do something with all the flies I won't be back until then , customer for years but find it hard to come back as the flies attack me and my food .",UNK
310,Way over hyped this place does NLT Vegas standards from there restaurants to their service their restaurants need to learn about how to treat customers,UNK
311,I've been seeing Tracy over 3 years and I've never left disappointed. I let her do her thing with my color and it looks great. I have long hair and she's never chopped it off either (that's always a fear seeing someone new),UNK
312,Great patio ambiance but most limp Caesar salad ever & drenched in dressing.  Wings okay but ordered as appetizer 10 minutes before entrees and all arrived at the same time.,UNK
313,It appears this restaurant is now closed.,UNK
314,Some strong drinks for really good prices. Coronas for 3.75 not bad other places $6 minimum . You can gamble to a plus. Would come back,UNK
315,Surprisingly good tex mex and a great atmosphere. The music is actually really good also.,UNK
316,Great food and excellent service. The cheese burgers are fresh on baked bread with cut fries!,UNK
317,"The two stars are for the service...  Food was not anywhere near what they charge for it...  Bottom of the list for steak places in Madison for food, top of list for price?!?!  No thanks.",UNK
318,Rarely do you find a spot that everything you eat is great.  Will be going back soon for more...especially the veggie board!,UNK
319,Katsu chicken is a fav of mine. Took some friends as part of the Hawaiian themed day at the office.,UNK
320,Came for the pool on a Sunday. Loved how large and varied the pool space is. Enjoyed a quiet start and then finished over by the DJ who was pumping out some pretty good jams.,UNK
321,"Il Bosco was awesome! Quality ingredients, great service and authentic feel. We appreciate the attention to detail.. from the custom olive plates to the herb garden outside. When it comes to pizza there are many choices...but this is the right one! We will be back soon!",UNK
322,"Do not miss this place if you are looking for great food for breakfast or lunch.  The long may look long, but it moves very fast.  Service is great and the portions are huge.",UNK
323,Decent breakfast burritos and surprisingly good rolled tacos.,UNK

326,Good service.,UNK
327,"Love the personal training sessions, classes and the friendly ambiance! Best way to get fit instead of a regular gym! Always leave here sweating and stronger!",UNK
328,"I just came here for the view but it made enough of an impression that I'd love to come back fro drinks and food. The view is amazing. On par with Ghostbar. Good music, sexy vibe.",UNK
329,"Yuck. I went there twice. Nothing memorable was served, other than pasta from a box. I would not return.",UNK
330,"This place is under new management and is much improved. Huge crowds, but fast takeaway service.",UNK
331,Slow slow slow check out. Selection is poor and check out is super slow.,UNK
332,"This is my favorite hotel in Las Vegas. The diamond suites are incredible, the casino is classic and the service is great.",UNK
333,I have been a patient of MVFP for over 10 years.  I have a great Dr. (Roseann Collins). And I find them to be organized and efficient.  Nothing but good experience with them.\nRichard,UNK
334,"Everything about this place is brilliant. Wouldn't be surprised to see them pop up all over the country, it's that fun (and delicious too). Hope one comes to Dallas, Tx, because I won't be back in NC for a while.",UNK
335,Very bland soup.....and $5 for one iced tea. Won't be returning,UNK
336,This is a hotel for a couple night stay not for a long period of time. The bed was hard and the pillows too soft. The front desk clerk in the morning had a major attitude for what who knows. Like I said good for a 1-2 night stay only,UNK
337,Best sunday funday spot ever!!,UNK
338,Wow. I'm glad there's more than 3 options.    The broth is super tasty. A pork lovers heaven. All pork everything.,UNK
339,We enjoyed perfectly cooked beef tenderloin and wonderful cocktails during happy hour. The drinks were wonderful and side dishes nice.,UNK

341,"Bike was in good working order, and the kiosks were user friendly. Of course, a bike share is never perfect! It was good enough for a day trip to NoDa and Dilworth.",UNK
342,"I won't buy coffee anywhere else as long as I live here. . . Try the Burundi or Bob-O-Link Brazil for truly great, fresh single-origin beans.  Great price for great product!  Kind employees and great service.",UNK
343,We ordered through a delivery service to have delivered to our office. The chocolate malted crunch was stale and old. So disappointed since I love going here. Wasted money on this delivery!,UNK
344,the worst chinese food ever!!! also worst customer service. all food i order has no taste.. if i can only give -0 review  i will,UNK
345,"Such a great place, amazing inventory. Unfortunately, I've never bought anything because it's so expensive. But I do like to go and just look. :)",UNK
346,"5 stars when comparing to other fast food restaurants.  Nice staff and yummy, quick food.  Tolerant of kids.  Never see more than 2 kids in here at once, so non-breeders won't be put-out.",UNK

348,Never have been treated so bad in a restaurant in my life!!!,UNK

350,Solid 4-star restaurant. The nachos are a MUST HAVE!  They are worth the $$. Burgers are ok and I wish I didn't get the shake. Tasted like a Wendy's frosty.,UNK
351,Delicious prickly pear and boysenberry although a little too sweet.  Live music.  Comfortable.,UNK
352,This hotel was by far one of the prettiest for its cost. The restaurants  bathrooms and rooms were killer. Clean rooms and yummy food. Best buffet by far.,UNK
353,"Not the best pizza in the world, but they are quick, the pizza is good, and affordable.  I love the garlic herb crusts that you can choose for your pizza.\nThis place is really for pick up or delivery only.",UNK
354,Had the chicken fried steak with buscuits and gravy.  Good panfried steak with good gravy.  Most places will deep fry the steak.  This one is pan fried and tastes much better.,UNK
355,First visit last night and we most def will be back!  Great food and even better service.  Wonderful local establishment!,UNK
356,"It's a quiet spot, but plenty of table & chairs for groups. Yet, it has comfy chairs pulled up to coffee table, just the right size to eat your sandwich or use it to bring your laptop to work/study.",UNK
357,"Waited over 40 minutes for a half-pound of dry ground beef; nothing \""BBQ\"" about the BBQ Western burger. If the rest of the menu is the same quality, no wonder they need girls in shorts and tank tops to get customers!",UNK
358,Worst bar ever! Full of old middle aged people the staff is rude and uptight ! It's always empty on the weekends which says aloe about this place. I have given this place a few chances never pleased . I rather go to zipps,UNK
359,Another one of Emeril Lagasse's restaurant that you can't go wrong with!!!The steaks are as good as delmonicos!!!the service is top notch!!!,UNK
360,Just finished eating here! And couldn't leave  without writing a review. Their service was wonderful and the food was even better. The choripollo was excellent big portions for under 8 bucks. Great lunch specials can't wait to come back when we are in town.,UNK
361,I got the slow roasted jerk chicken (yes I know at the fish market!) and it was very very good.  For dessert I split the 'doughnut' with ice cream which was very tasty.,UNK
362,I eat here every time I come to viva. Love the carnitas and the Barbacoa blew my mind!!,UNK

366,NOT good at all. Really disappointed after I read several good reviews,UNK
367,The store manager called the next day and acknowledged that there had been a miscommunication. She has followed through with resolving this situation to my satisfaction.,UNK
368,This is an excellent movie theater. The theaters are kept clean. I don't drink alcohol but they started serving alcoholic drinks by the concession stand. (It was good for my friends that wanted to get a little buzzed before the movie starts.),UNK
369,"I understand this is inside the Bellagio, but $8 for a bud light, that is ridiculous.  This place was crowded and just seemed a little small.  The waitresses were a little rude.\n\nI expected more.",UNK
370,Nice location but the food was very disappointing.,UNK
371,I give this place two stars. One star per piece of hair I found in my gross goat coconut dish.,UNK
372,"In regards to Cassie or \""Ricks\"" comment. I tried multiple times to get in touch with someone in upper management about my experience. It's funny how a review on social media suddenly makes this important...Too little to late.",UNK

375,Terrible service,UNK
376,"It's not bad, you get what you pay for.",UNK
377,"Good pub faire in a decent setting. I had sliders with a fruit salad. All ingredients were fresh and tasty. My experience last week was good, with friendly and efficient service. Although, I was a single diner arriving at 2:20 pm on a quiet Saturday afternoon.",UNK
378,Well I can't grade the staff we really didn't use them. There is so much cool stuff here from cooking toys to kids toys. We spent a good 45 min there and just poked around. Interesting creative and teaching crafts for kids that could enhance any B-day party.,UNK
379,"I attended in Atlanta, paid dearly for a ticket and was extremely disappointed. They barely gave away $5000 in prizes. I've waited a long time to be a part of this wonderful show and got the shock of my life. It was the worst ever!!!!",UNK
380,"August 29 my coworkers and I ordered, first they sent me the wrong food, second I had a hair in my food! I used to always love Lins but not anymore. Hint...maybe wear a hair net and hair pulled back.",UNK

388,"Great food, real good prices for what you get.  Mussels were excellent",UNK
389,"$47 dollars for 2 people, you would think the food is good. This crap was nasty. The only foods that were decent was the little fried shrimp and the ice cream. What a waste of money and time. Never again and why was it so much dessert, but hardly anything else?",UNK
390,Shamus is great!  He's super knowledgable and took the time to teach us a ton of stuff.  He's also way cheaper than the big box stores.  Thanks Shamus!!,UNK
391,"From calling in to getting in the transaction was AWSOME !! Customer service was great , forgot the young kids name but helped me out completely , thanx",UNK
392,We had brisket with no bun. Brisket was excellent and could be cut with fork. No knife necessary. Sides were good and BBQ sauce was good. Fun industrial feel. They do have a good selection of bottled beer. Tvs in dining area and kid friendly,UNK
393,"I great coffee shop away from the strip. The place has a fresh modern look. If you enjoy a good pour-over, consider this joint. The staff are very friendly. \n\nSeveral pastries and breakfast items to choose. Free Wi-Fi.",UNK
394,"I am all about strip clubs, but this place was not worth the $20 entrance, the $10 watered down drink, and getting finger printed to use my credit card. Not one pickle worth it here.",UNK
395,"I liked this joint; good beer, really interesting menu (I had a spicy dog with peanut butter, bacon, and Gouda cheese) fine prices and a really nice waitress. The time of service was lackluster, but we were outside and it was a beautiful day. Cool joint.",UNK
396,"The food was amazing! Hands down a great meal, but the service sucked. At one point our server asked us a question while he walked by...but he never stopped walking! \nIt just didn't have the feel of a 4 or 5 star restaurant.",UNK
397,Burgers are fabulous here when I've visited!  Servers are nice too!,UNK
398,James is a phenomenal massage therapist. The place is really nice and super professional. The floating bed is unbelievable and the infrared heated bed is very relaxing. I bought the membership five months ago and I am not sorry,UNK

401,"They have a really great Sunday brunch with wonderful tasting food, and all you can drink mimosa's or bloody mary's. The atmosphere is laid back with board games and a pool table upstairs, however the service has been absolutely horrible. If Republic Kitchen fails this will be the reason.",UNK
402,"The broadway pizza is yummy. The knots are a cheap yummy eat. $3 for 6 knots cheap, cheap!",UNK
403,"Went by the other day and it is closed.  Unfortunate, now I don't know where to get the delicious sour cherries in syrup I love with greek yogurt.",UNK
404,"Maybe I ordered the wrong sandwich, but this was just ok. Good price. but the sandwich was kind of dry and not very flavorful.\n\nBonus star for being open late. It's so hard to find something to eat after leaving nightclubs, so thanks!",UNK
405,Loved it!  I stopped in to check it out this week.  I felt very welcome and enjoyed my first Hot Yoga experience.  I hope to return soon!,UNK
406,Janet did an amazing job on making my dress look perfect. She keeps working on your dress until you are happy with how it looks. I loved working with her and would recommend her to any bride.,UNK

411,Pretty dope base! Been here a couple times!,UNK
412,"The food here just isn't that good. They try to make french food, but it's way too heavy on butter and other fats, and tastes more like diner food than a french breakfast shop.",UNK
413,"Simple but tasty, a chewy cookie and quality ice cream. Mix and match your favorite flavors for a downhome comfort experience.",UNK
414,"Worst customer experience ever, agree with all the other reviews!!  Gee, trend showing?  People that work there only care about their friends, not paying customers. Predict this place dead in 6 months. Miss the canteen.",UNK
415,Couldn't decide which burger I wanted since they all looked interesting. I opted for the slider trio for variety .Best burgers I've had in a while! Mouthwatering delicious :) Great selection of cocktails as well.,UNK

417,Love this little Mexican burrito shack! The carnesada is good! I love the beans and rice too!,UNK

427,3 out 4 delays in 6 month period that's unacceptable . We are gonna find a different airline,UNK
428,"I like Sprouts. They've got a great selection, and always have good produce. The only bad thing about this place is that I feel extra guilty when I forget my reusable shopping bags...so bring your reusables.",UNK
429,"Chicken Marsala and alfredo sauce were delicious, but the marinara sauce left little to be desired. I would have preferred the bread that was brought to the table to be warm or at least soft. All in all ok but we probably won't be back.",UNK
430,"Dont spend ur money here! The burgers were nothing different than Mc Donalds, seriously! The service was terrible, we waited 30 mins for our food to arrive and our waiter barely acknowledged us.",UNK
431,"Whimsical, fun and gorgeous. A very nice walkthrough - and the butterflies in the greenhouse were a fun touch.",UNK
432,"DBLTA sandwich + pancakes for two ppl. We don't know the pancake and the sandwich will be that big. Worth the price, the veg in the sandwich is fresh. Ice tea is great, love it cuz it's not sweet.",UNK

435,Absolutely love this place! The macaroons are delicious the ambiance is great and the staff is very nice!!! Definitely recommend when you're craving something sweet.,UNK
436,Excellent omelets  and light fluffy pancakes. There are so many great breakfast places in Scottsdale. This just may be the best in N Scottsdale. The patio feels like you are dining at a mountain ski lodge.,UNK
437,This location is horrible!  The Grind off of Camelback is a much better experience.  Quality of food AND customer service.  We will never go back!,UNK
438,Hands down best broth I've ever had. Ktown  in LA should be ashamed.\n\nFurther more... Young coconut. So good.,UNK
439,I should have just gone to Harris Teeter for a microwave pizza. I wouldn't have done this review if my friend didn't laugh at the pizza after I offered him a slice. It was like cardboard with barely any sauce or cheese. I'll never go there again.,UNK
440,Horrible. Place has gone downhill. Items are either overcooked or undercooked. Staff doesn't seem to care. Slow service.,UNK
441,"Cute little store. I love going here to find new treasures. They get new stuff in all the time. A lot of nice brand name items. My 2 teenage daughters love this store, I have never left this place empty handed.",UNK
442,I just called from Calif.to buy an anniversary gift for family in Summerlin and was put on hold by the manager listening to lame elevator music for way too long.  This is not good customer service.  Hope they're better in person.  I'm taking business elsewhere,UNK

446,"They definitely disclose that it's not typical Mexican tacos, so if that's what you want go somewhere else. They have very innovative, delicious ingredients and I've loved every taco I've tried. The nachos are especially delicious and the tequila selection is great.",UNK
447,Short wait for lunch. Service was good and the drinks are strong. The salmon was excellent and had a balsamic reduction which gave it a nice sweet crust. Overall good experience.,UNK
448,Small bowling alley (30 lanes). It was a lot of fun they had good pizza.  We were there for a company party which they were able to accommodate pretty well.,UNK
449,Very friendly staff! My drink always tastes great and exactly as I ordered it!,UNK
450,"Brunch was very disappointing, cocktails were mediocre, and there was just no atmosphere with the total of 3 people in this restaurant. Food was just average, not worth the pain of parking at this place. Does not validate and valet is $12.",UNK
451,Great sushi place for the price. Lots of unique rolls that were delicious.  Staff does a pretty good job keeping the wait to a minimum during the busy hours. Recommended if you are looking for quick sushi.,UNK
452,"A mandatory watering hole if you appreciate attentive service, solid scotch selection and (occasional) decent live music. If the name/logo leave it unclear:  remember your clothes will smell of cigars the next day.",UNK
453,"just found out they use fructose corn syrup in the ice cream, very disappointed in them. Why do they use that?",UNK
454,Overpriced Ashley furniture...... some made in china.\nCouch was saggy after a year. They only give you one year on the foam warranty.\nWarranty not great either.\nDo better research when furniture shopping.,UNK
455,The best pizza in the united states according to several magazines. The owner bakes each pizza himself. The wait is a bit long but you can grab a glass of vino next door at Bar Bianco. Well worth the wait and price. Excellent place to take a date.,UNK
456,"Absolutely terrible service, after nearly an hour of waiting for the employee to come out of the back with my new phone he told me that I had to buy it at retail price even though it clearly stated online that I could buy it at the discounted price.",UNK
457,Excellent Pho!   Really good deep tasting broth and all the fixing were delicious.,UNK
458,Best Tacos in town!! They have great variety menus with all day breakfast! Chilaquiles Verdes must try as well!,UNK
459,I hate this place. I feel like everyone here is party of wanna be redneck clique....\n\n\nNever again,UNK
460,"Stopped in for some hot chocolate, it came out warm not hot and our server was very apathetic. We were there for maybe 30 minutes and he never checked on us once. No plans to ever return.",UNK
461,Stopped by here one night when i was hanging with some friends.  I found the bar tenders to be rather rude and not interested in helping the customer.    The venue is really cool and does have a great vibe but bad customer service isn't worth it.,UNK
462,Good milkshake.. but the worst service ever.,UNK
463,They have one of the best Vegas rolls I have ever had! Other rolls are pretty good! Long live Sushi San,UNK

466,"Reasonably priced, authentic, Cantonese Chinese cuisine. Friendly service. Pictures of Hongkong decorate the walls. Noodles and chicken dishes always tasty. A midtown Phoenix find! I've never ordered the American-style dishes.",UNK
467,"I like this vet clinic. I have been coming here for over 5 years with my two pups. The staff is pretty helpful as I need help at times since one of my dogs can be a handful. All in all, I like Ann road animal hospital.",UNK
468,Premium price for a standard sandwich.\n\nWould have been an enjoyable visit had the deli guy been at least welcoming.,UNK
469,Two words.  Dirty and nasty. Better off driving 3 miles to the Steele creek McDonalds!,UNK
470,"I've had waaaay better sandwiches. It's perfect for the late night \""smokers\"" that don't care about what the food taste like as it is shoveled into their face eyes closed.",UNK
471,had a coconut and mocha blended really good nice outdoor seating area its next to a car wash they had several other types of drinks it seems like a nice little place to pass some time,UNK
472,If I love this place that means you'll love it too!,UNK
473,Carne Asada plate is awesome with fresh chopped onions and cilantro with hand made tortillas... can't go wrong!\n\nDon't forget to bring cash!,UNK
474,This may be the most over rated place ever!  OMG the stuff is so absolutely average at best. The staff when you walk in remixed me of an episode of restaurant stakeout. I tried it but I won't be back.,UNK
475,it is a pool supply store. not much else to say overpriced supplies but if you want good products you are going to have to pay for them. Staff is knowledgeable and helpful.,UNK
476,"I was not terribly impressed with the tacos--tortillas didnt hold up, beans tasted like they were out of a can and rice was salty...too many good mexican places in town to bother with this one!!",UNK
477,Great at remember that I had just been there the prior day and know what I wanted.  Lovely service,UNK

480,If your looking for quality food with quality ingrediants. This is not it. Sysco drek!!p,UNK
481,Very average Spanish food. In fact I found the paella to be extremely oily.  Way overpriced for what you get for your dollar. I added a star just for the outdoor patio.,UNK
482,love this place!! like all its one of those places you come out of feelin finnneeee!!! start off the night with a lil landy and youll be set : ),UNK
483,Parking garage is a little confusing to get into. But once in great layout. Friendly employees. Slot machines pay out really well for being on the strip. Lots of nice shops and prices aren't bad.,UNK
484,Great dessert option to keep things light. Flavors are special and unique. Tried the arroz con leche and it is delicious tasting like horchata or rice pudding with cinnamon.,UNK
485,"If you like soggy tastless food, this is the place to go. Its horrible, dont waste your money",UNK
486,"...At first glace, the soup at Pho Bang New York was dark and murky that went from transparent clean-cut, all business soup up top, to cloudy, mysterious and all party near the bottom - I present to you, the Soup Mullet...",UNK
487,"Destination dining. Came through Wickenburg,  spotted cabin. So glad we stopped.  French fries hand cut and perfectly fine.  Green chile bacon grilled cheese sandwich served with a cheerful smile. Drive out here.  It's worth it.",UNK
488,"Awesome dinner, be ready for a good kick! Margaritas were great too",UNK
489,"I can't get enough of the Frutti di Mare: possibly the best I've had anywhere. For the price, it's the best deal on the menu. Love it!",UNK

495,"Good massage, nice environment and professional staff. I'll return to this business in the future.",UNK
496,"This place is definitely a classic.  A fairly well run casino and hotel, lots of great shows.  But the rooms definitely need an update.  I was half expecting Sinatra to pop in at any moment.",UNK
497,"Not a huge fan.\nNot a lot of flavor and while it comes out hot.. Doesn't seem fresh. With other options in the area, I don't plan on returning.",UNK
498,Brad is awesome!!,UNK
499,This place is on a thin line between thrift store and junkyard. It just doesn't feel clean and no one is very welcoming if you aren't hipster enough. There are so many salons out there that I wouldn't give this one a shot.,UNK
500,"Went there about 10 times for cleaning as well as alterations.  Cleaning was fine but alterations were disappointing. They didn't do an original hem on my jeans and I was pretty clear about what I wanted. They lost my business, there is better elsewhere, keep looking.",UNK
501,"Went before our show. Great good, ambience & service.  Very very pricey, reviews said avg check $50..... Ummmm no unless you say per person",UNK
502,"The maple bacon cupcake was amazing, as for the others we tried, nothing special. The macaroons were yummy though.",UNK
503,"Again, fish and chips did not deliver, fish was small, and only two sticks, with too many fries to compensate. Not worth 15 dollars.",UNK
504,Whoo-hoo!  Per www.cinematreasures.org it has re-opened! http://cinematreasures.org/theater/4730/\nIt will be showing classic movies for the time being.  Future programming has yet to be determined.,UNK
505,The pupusas were gross and so were the waitresses with their rotten attitude. Never ever going back again.,UNK
506,Rice tasted like plastic. Service sucked. It was my first and last time going there. If I didn't have a $20 gift card I don't think I would went in the first place. Not a good experience at all. :(,UNK
507,Pho ga chicken was dried out. The spring rolls were the smallest portion I've ever seen & the peanut sauce was watered down. I've tried eating here twice. I give up,UNK
508,Always great service such nice people great prices. Love the chips and teas. Love the old small town looking store.,UNK

518,"Great food but only gets 3 stars from me because of their lousy service. And they keep raising their prices! The place is very busy most of the time, so the wait for the table or the food is very long. Order before you get there.",UNK
519,The food here is amazing and the service is always great!!! Would recommend this place to anyone...,UNK
520,The  crepes are made there fresh when you order with fruit toppings.  These are some of the best crepes I have tasted. Their cappuccinos have the perfect taste and everything was absolutely delicious.   The staff is very nice and always make you feel welcoming. My favorite coffee place.,UNK
521,"Best fried chicken of all of the supermarket chicken deli's.  Even better than Safeway.  And cheap.  8 pieces for $7.99 normally, and sometimes, when you're lucky, you can get it as low as $4.99 when it's on sale.",UNK
522,What a dump.  (Compared to all other hotel / casinos).  Don't let the pics fool you.  The old 70's casino tables and the mold in the bathrooms was enough for me.  Time for an extreme makeover..,UNK
523,Amazing bagels but average service . They are under staffed and also the manager isn't the nicest . She has a bit of an attitude .,UNK
524,I like the food at this restaurant but they do not deliver like it says! They need to change the info. Service is just OK.,UNK

531,Had dinner there last week and the food was amazing.  Ordered the three course meal and loved everything.  The bartender mixed up a surprise drink and I was not disappointed.  I would recommend Crudo to anyone who loves great food.,UNK
532,This is a nice desert landscaped area. I like to walk the trail when I'm on this side of town.  The walking path is pleasant and the scenery is beautiful. There are also other park facilities like picnic tables and basketball courts.,UNK
533,Really disappointing. The inside is nothing great at all. It really  doesn't stand out. The restaurants and places to eat were not that great at all.,UNK
534,Went here for brunch and was pleasantly surprised by the yummy food choices. I ended up having the Phoenician. Friendly staff and fast service!,UNK

536,"Would have loved to try out some juices in this shop, but wasn't able to get past the youngsters hanging out at the taste bar. \nMight want to consider making room for new customers!",UNK
537,"About as mediocre as you can get.  Mechanical bull/ sports bar/ loud music/ etc.  Bland, boring American cuisine.  There are plenty of better options in Las Vegas.",UNK
538,"Sometimes it's hard to find a seat but they have folding chairs in case you can't find one. But overall this places feels like a vacation, it's awesome.",UNK
539,Love my glitter nails (and toes) - - get compliments constantly!  Never chip or break.  Never worry about cleanliness or getting cuts ... absolutely perfect every time.,UNK
540,"Walmart as a chain is okay. his particular Walmart is horrible.  I have been here several times, and each time I have not been happy with the selection, the service or the attitude of the employees.  Go to the Walmart on Dobson and 8th street.",UNK
541,fuck a $20 cover. fuck house music. fuck your flair bartending. give me my damn drink.,UNK
542,Love the bagels and smear! Don't order a sandwich to go though bc it'll take forever. Customer service is still on par though!,UNK

552,Worst service ever. Started off with apps quickly and then the food didn't arrive for over an hour with no apologies and the hot dishes were cold. We watched them sit under the hot lamps for 20 minutes and asked what the status was Don't bother with this place.,UNK
553,"Decent yogurt. But it's not swirled! Toppings are un-crushed. The staff is nice, I'm giving them 3 stars because I got complimentary hot chocolate! Expected more but still good.",UNK
554,"Pretty much my favorite chain Mexican food. Although you have a lot of choice for great Mexican food in the area, it's a pretty good place and has a lot of menu choices",UNK
555,Service was very prompt. I got the Lamb Burger (outstanding) wife got the Runnelstone burger. We ordered the Appetizer sampler (the cheese curds and mac and cheese wedges are incredible) they have a great selection of micro brews. And fairly priced as well,UNK
556,This restaurant is the worst I've ever been. The hotel screed up my room and now this diner. Service is the worst and food is not far. The hotel deserve to be at the last hotel of the strip.,UNK
557,I've been there a couple of times. The service is good...the food is marginal...but what turned me off is when I saw this old guy drooling as he walked toward the food. I'll never be back!,UNK
558,Last night I ordered the chicken pita and the chicken wasn't fully cooked. I got food poisoning and am in the hospital.,UNK

574,"Happy Thanksgiving!  What my mother could NEVER do, Chef Brian can!  Thanksgiving @ Cork was great!",UNK

594,"The Korean tacos are not half bad, and the kid really likes the burgers.",UNK
595,Good beer and good seafood choices!  Much better than the casino's seafood buffet on Friday at French Market.  Try the crab cakes!  Good size oysters too!,UNK
596,Awesome job. Gustavo was professional and fast. No obnoxious upsell. Would definitely recommend this company to fellow yelpers.,UNK
597,Doesn't get worst than this- bland Indian dinner buffet. Ok customer service. Pretty expensive for the quality of buffet- but that is probably because it is Vegas.,UNK
598,"The BBT is by far the best bar in the Southside!  A bit off the beaten path, but the selection of food, craft beers, and great wait staff make me want to stay and hang out for hours!!  Definitely the neighborhood bar to be at! Love this place!",UNK

602,"Overpriced, food wasn't very good, the service was only decent. If you go to Cadillac Ranch go for the eye candy and the bar on a Friday or Saturday night otherwise you will walk out feeling like you just kissed your sister... yeah I said it!",UNK
603,Just had a second vehicle done by these guys despite a 45 minute drive to get there. Good work & honest prices. Highly recommended!,UNK

608,Great place! Greatest wings ever and fun atmosphere. I can't wait to go back and try the burgers.,UNK
609,"Tiny airport that is all about security. They will pat you down, take out your liquids, and pull your hair because they are so bored. One good thing is you can buy cheese and cheese curds at the airport!",UNK
610,"Good for a breakfast with little kids, but otherwise not worth going to.",UNK
611,"That's unfortunate. Even without tasting the food I was turned off after hearing about the \""bad customer\"" list.",UNK
612,My rating would be 2 1/2 if that were available.\n\nOverpriced fro what you get and does not live up to the hype.,UNK
613,Went here for breakfast.  Told the wait would be 15 - 20 minutes.  Waited 30 minutes.  Went to ask how much longer.  Told 30 more minutes.  Our name was 2nd down on list.  Do not appreciate being lied to about the wait.  We left.,UNK

623,"Stopped by at random, chefs are friendly and the food is fresh! All you can eat! Try the Tuna Karai if you like sashimi, delicious!",UNK
624,The barbecue was cold and certainly nothing to write home about.  I was hoping for some amazing Carolina-style BBQ.  This was not the place.  I should've ventured farther from the hotel in search of the real thing.,UNK
625,Nice clean space with lots of vendors. Courteous staff.,UNK
626,Excellent! It's the first stop we make when we arrive in AZ. Great food reasonable prices.,UNK

628,Can't beat the price.  Very clean.  Great size rooms.  A very nice breakfast spread!  Pool is small but almost always empty.  Even a small gym on site!  Great deal and would definitely stay again.,UNK
629,Did not return our call.  We waited 2 hours before we called someone else.  After 10 hours still haven't heard from him.  I guess he has enough business and doesn't need ours.,UNK
630,its a typical Filipino Grill...,UNK
631,"Stay away, food was really terrible!  Had ribs and fries based on waiter recommendation, ribs were actually cold, fries were cold...ribs were dry and tasteless.  Worst meal out in years, shame on you, Logan!",UNK
632,I like this place but they closed without notice today. I brought bunch of friends...,UNK
633,Some dishes are good.,UNK
634,Amazing Thai food. Specialized spicy flavor depending on what you like. Great service AND they put on the NCAA tourney for us. Spicy wings were also straight fantastic.,UNK
635,there was nothing fresh about the food.\naverage service and way too expensive when compared to poor quality.\nwe will not go there again,UNK
636,Ceased salad was ok.  The spaghettini was really lacking flavor.  Not a lot if choices on the menu. Overall a disappointment,UNK
637,Absolutley LOVE their wings!! I have never had a problem with them as I did at BWW plus a military discount!! Love all the flavors!!,UNK
638,The space is gorgeous and the aerial silks class I was able to attend was awesomely fun... but the management is less than tactful or helpful about scheduling and it has really soured me on the whole experience.,UNK
639,Easily the worst steak house I've been too.   Sad part is the salad was the best part of the meal.   My dry aged strip was so chewy and cold I was only able to eat a couple bites.  Never again,UNK
640,"I get take out from here all the time.  It is really unhealthy food but it is authentic, delicious soul food.  Consistently good from week to week.  The place is small and it takes a bit to get your food but it is worth it.",UNK
641,Service here is SLOW.\nWhat purpose is two drive thrus if they can't efficiently maintain one?,UNK
642,Huge selection fairly overpriced horrible customer service try to exchange something with a receipt was told I need the complete original packaging which was a piece of cardboard definitely will spend my money elsewhere. .,UNK
643,The quintessential Vegas buffet and it definitely lived up to its hype. It was a sea of unending food and all of it pleased me immensely. The servers were very prompt in refilling drinks. I was so delighted to sample so many unique foods!,UNK
644,"So so so so good! I went twice in one week for their Tokyo bowl! The portions are huge, plenty for at least two meals.",UNK
645,Since when does it take 1 1/2hrs. toile Lo mein?  My husband and I sat at this joint with only 1 other party in the dining room for over an hour.  I won't be stopping in on my lunch hour!!!!,UNK
646,"Too sweet. Tried the famous almond cake and some cupcakes. Cannot even finish eating them. Plus, the stuff there are rude, maybe just because there are too many customers in the little place.",UNK
647,Great Place to Eat.. Native New Yorker and I thought I was home with Mom.. Puerto Rican and Cuban food very similar.. Highly Recommend. .,UNK
648,"Stopped in for lunch pick up near work and found the most wonderful people working here. If you are the owner or manager reading this, everyone there on 3/27 at noon deserves a big raise!",UNK

650,Good service! Cool vibe & decent polish food.,UNK
651,Always a great experience!!!!!,UNK
652,Perfect lunch food.,UNK
653,Went here first time because of yelp reviews. My new favorite spot... found out it now owned by my other favorite sushi but this one is closer to home.  From food to service everything is top notch!!!,UNK
654,"Love the food, the brothers that own this place really try to stay true to serbian dishes when ever they can. And the pizza and beer selections are always top notch. In the high end game of non-dominos style pizzerias they are king",UNK
655,Really good chinese food...best place in the area for chinese delivery. The delivery times could be faster though.,UNK
656,Bernice and crew did a great job on our 2005 Honda Pilot. Also had two windows retinted. Very detailed work and very friendly people there. I have another car that I will be bringing in soon. Highly recommended. Price was fair and reasonable as well.,UNK
657,I come here for sporting events all the time. Arizona alumni club is here. The atmosphere is wonderful and food is good. I'm sad it's closing.,UNK
658,"Great cold subs, but I will take Penn station over this any day!",UNK
659,"Unfortunately, I didn't get to taste the food, as the overwhelming smell of sewage forced me to leave before I could order. We instead went next door to \""On the Grill\""",UNK
660,When my girlfriends and I visited XS on a Saturday night we met an Asian TV star and a New Orleans group of guys who were friends with an executive of Encore.  Needless to say we had a fabulous evening.,UNK
661,"The Flame is No longer burning. This Vintage, Iconic Steakhouse has closed its doors     for good in September of 2014.\n\nConstruction has begun on a new place. So Sad.",UNK
662,Perfect diner-type food in a diner-type atmosphere! The prices are a bit high for what you're getting but they are open all day and very convenient.,UNK
663,"great waitress, but super slow service in the kitchen. It took forever to get our food and it wasn't even busy. probably won't go back.",UNK
664,"This will be a boon to the PV Mall area, indefinitely. I'm just hoping a Sam's Club doesn't open up somewhere in the vicinity and the mall shatter beneath corporate giants, we don't need another Christown.",UNK
665,Really nice waitress but they really need to up the ante on their vegetarian options. They don't even have a plain marinara sauce option for spaghetti!,UNK
666,Very good Taiwan style Chinese restaurant. \n\nTaiwanese I have met tell me they barely get better at home. \n\nDo I really need to continue writing?,UNK
667,The BBQ is good but not great.  The prices are close to a fine dining restaurant.  Not impressed with the food when you look at the prices.  Good selection but nothing is really over the top.  Generic flavor and high prices.,UNK
668,We loved it a must when in Glendale!!! A little crowded but that's a sign it was good. Best hamburger in Glendale!!!,UNK
669,"If you crave some greasey spoon food at a drive-in style spot not near anything, this is your place. Once or twice a year is fine by me",UNK
670,Nice atmosphere. Soft music and no televisions. A lot of food for the price. Pad thai was kind of bland. Good spring rools and thai iced tea. Attentive staff.,UNK
671,These doughnuts are fresh! Just rolled through the drive through to get breakfast. service was fast and the doughnuts were fresh as usual. If you like fresh doughnuts this is the place for you.,UNK
672,"Simply put, my dog had an amazing time here. Reaper had plenty of room to play with the other dogs and most of the dogs/owners were very friendly. There wasn't much grass and the lake was a little gross but I cannot wait to take him to Cosmo again.",UNK
673,"Cheap for vegas, soup and sandwich filled me up =)\n\nthe earl grey lemonade... not as sweet as i want it to be but still pretty good for a tea",UNK

675,"Delicious cocktails, charcuterie was awesome!",UNK
676,Awesome tasting pizza!,UNK

678,Delivery girl needs to learn some basic etiquette.,UNK
679,"The space is nice, but the crowd is not good (very much on the older side, and lots of leering drunk guys).  Only pluses are that women usually get in for free & they have drink specials/free drinks for women during certain hours of the night.",UNK
680,"cool place, but they need a system to seat people.  my hubby n i went and the girls were nice and cute. we had to find our own seats out front though. drinks were ok, nothing special. didn't notice where the club part was...out by 5am",UNK
681,"Food,service,atmosphere feels like back home! the prices are just outrageous...cheap! I'm definitely going to be back!",UNK

685,I use their prepaid card. It works.,UNK
686,"The food was okay, but with the setting and the hype I'd heard about the place, I expected better. I even had my friends leftovers and his pasta was pretty it was alright, nothing special.",UNK
687,"This place sucks...... no seafood..... service is not great and people are not too friendly.after asking the waiter if they offered any seafood at all he just replied with\"" you have the menu,read it,I will be back\""",UNK
688,Way older crowd slow service leaving now,UNK
689,Great bite to grab before a show. My wife and I had dinner reservations somewhere else after criss angel and this was a perfect pizza snack for us to split. If you're really hungry I'd recommend getting one for yourself.,UNK
690,Came here with a Groupon because I would not come to the Paris otherwise. Never had a good experience here and this place lives up to my expectations.  The service was terrible and the place smelled like vomit. Not worth coming here even with a Groupon.,UNK
691,So many choices of mimosas to choose from! Passion fruit and strawberry was yummy! Tuna crepe was delicious. Service was excellent.,UNK
692,My new coffee spot!\nDrive thru service & good variety.\nPlus the barista waits for you to try the drink to make sure you like it.,UNK

694,"Fun...I went for Scotty Boy, and wasn't at all disappointed.  Bottle service!!!",UNK
695,"Best place in Terminal 4. I like the couches to have a beer, lounge around and use the airport WiFi. Tacos are good too, but new Mexican food place going in Terminal 4 in 2012 might give Oaxaca a run for its money",UNK
696,"we drove over specifically to go to Liberty. It was close to 2pm. So the lunch rush was gone, but the floors were so filthy and there was so much trash under the outside tables, that we ate across the street. The dirt was a huge turn off...",UNK

699,"I came here for breakfast on a Sunday. We waited under 5 minutes for a table for 4. The service was great, and the food was really great. There were lots of different options for people's tastes, and the presentations were very palatable.",UNK
700,If I could make it a ZERO i would!!!!,UNK
701,"If only I could rate it lower.  If you haven't eaten mexican food you might like this place.  Green sauce was burnt, salsa was boring, carne asada tasted like Italian food.  Sad.  I miss good mexican food.  :(",UNK
702,Love the bigs decor on the wall. Good hamburgers.\nFries are great!,UNK
703,"Understaffed, poor food and terrible service. Go somewhere else as this place is just a waste of time. We were looking for some smoked meat and thought this would be the place but it looked bad so we ordered pizza. Quite possibly the worse pizza I've ever had.",UNK
704,"Great service, a variety of side dishes that they promptly refill, and good Korean food.\n\nMy friend who just moved from Korea says it's his favorite restaurant so I suppose it is authentic enough!",UNK
705,"Best place to watch sporting events, attentive and friendly staff, and the truffle pizza is so damn good.",UNK
706,Very over priced and not very high quality.,UNK
707,There was no air conditioning in the room.  We had to leave at 1 AM because we couldn't take the heat anymore!  They charged the full rate for only staying at the hotel for 2 hours!,UNK
708,"Was very surprised at ALL the different toppings\nthey had here! If you think it, I bet they can make\nit! Maybe!",UNK
709,This place was awful. They were very rude and $25 was the price for a reg pedicure and it was a rip off. Whole thing lasted like 10 minutes. A 2 year old could have made my nails look better than they do now! Please dont come here!!!!,UNK
710,This place is average. Lots of food. Speedy staff. It's a casual buffet. Great for business lunches,UNK
711,"An average-quality cheeseburger and fries, at an above average price. I could have bought a steak burger for $10.",UNK

714,"Loved it! Top rate all the way. We had one issue which was promptly adressed and rectified! I had the dry rubbed ribeye, with a wonderful red wine sauce (recommended by the awesome waiter), which was to die for!",UNK
715,I would like to comment about their Nanny service but they never called or e-mailed me back. I made several attempts to contact them and they never returned any of my calls. It is basic professionalism to return calls or e-mails even if their service is busy at the moment.,UNK
716,Much better than last year!  They must have a decent saucier now. The Alfredo was right on.  [Oh my!  I just realized that their sauces must now just come out of a can.  I wish they'd tell us if they are freshly made.),UNK
717,"Do not ever go here. They do not care about service, they only care about getting shutdown. AVOID!!!!!",UNK
718,"This place gets from me breakfast, lunch and dinner it goes down right hear. Strongly recommend",UNK
719,Awful experience.  Average food and service does not make up for one of the worse dining experiences of my life.  Beware if you expect to spend more than an hour eating.  They'll ask you to leave.  They don't need to worry - we'll never return.,UNK
720,WOW. Stopped in after the AZ ROAD RACER 5k. The machaca special was great!  Eggs bacon and french toast was wonderful.,UNK

725,"It's a cafe, it's in the Cortez. Average food, average service. Be prepared to wait awhile for your food. The breakfast is decent, diner style food.",UNK

727,"I was starving and went Pei Wei - it was lame, here's why:\nSLOW cooking (this could mean it was fresher, though)\nNOT TASTY :( \nBig portions were good, though!",UNK
728,"I was expecting something really amazing as Cowboy Ciao is highly touted.  While the salads are quite tasty, the wagyu burger and the Korean ribs I had other times were just average especially for the price.",UNK
729,"I really like the signature toasted almond cake, but have been mostly disappointed with the other things I've tried here. I've also not been pleased with the employees - they're not very friendly.",UNK
730,Order taker: cup or bowl? Bowl. And I get a cup. \n\nCalifornia club on a croissant. Get regular bread. \n\nSeriously dude? Why even take the orders if you're not going to listen?,UNK
731,So.... We are really getting in to Mediterranean food.  We found this local eatery and we were very pleased.  The food was flavorful and fresh.  We will be back to try other dishes.,UNK
732,"Had a chicken parm sandwich on wheat bread for lunch. It was quite delicious! My meal tasted very fresh, and the bread has to be made fresh in-house, it was very good. I will absolutely be going back - a half sandwich is a very reasonable price.",UNK
733,"Inside the Planet Hollywood mall area, this location is ok. Not as friendly service as im used to but they do make a good coffee. Less hassle then the starbucks in planet hollywood casino.",UNK
734,"The French fries were so soggy you could use them as shoe laces , also portions were undersized not one of the containers were full to the top , not that any of us wanted to eat them",UNK
735,"We placed an order for delivery last night online and not even 20 min later our doorbell was ringing. The pizza was piping hot, exactly how we ordered and very tasty!\n\nKudos!!",UNK
736,It's Vegas baby how bad can it be?,UNK
737,Seriously so super fresh! Their sashimi is melt in your mouth goodness! But with all this AYCE available out there I just feel like this place is pretty expensive.,UNK
738,Not much here... outrageous prices for creepy and weird used stuff.,UNK
739,"Service is great, but food is blah. I got the tacos and it looked like a blind person took a bunch of ingredients and threw it on my plate. No presentation or care. I guess you go here for the atmosphere more than actual dining experience.",UNK
740,"I once had long strong healthy blond hair, I now have mushy stretchy blue highlights. George was his name. Stay away.",UNK
741,Fasts friendly service very clean and always a tasty burger!,UNK
742,I love the vibe here. I'm easy to please though as I'm not a coffee aficionado.,UNK
743,We been here a couple times now and have always received fresh hot food. The philly cheesesteak and the 57 burger are standouts.They have a soda fountain so you can share drinks. A good value for lunch or a late night snack.,UNK
744,"I ordered a cab online the evening before I needed it to get me to the Badger Bus. The cab never showed up. When I called,  the dispatcher was rude and unhelpful.",UNK
745,I like this place much better then the one across the street. I had a 45 minute massage and about 38 of it was on my feet which is what I wanted. At the end she did a good neck shoulder back massage to finish. Great prices and easy to get in at least during the day.,UNK
746,Friendly staff good coffee to start the day and Fish Taco Tuesdays are GREAT,UNK
747,Nice to sit and people watch for sure... not as much fun if you want to go to Target and either dinner or a movie without moving the car.\n\nI do like all the seating areas and water/fire features they have.,UNK
748,This place was horrible. Do not go here.,UNK
749,You ain't down,UNK
750,Went to the drive through just for an ice cream cone and I was informed that they weren't selling ice cream. When we pulled up to wait for the car in front of us to get there order we saw the worker hand them an    Ice cream come..,UNK
751,"Couldn't make split pizza, prices way too high.  The highest I ever seen on a pizza. $26 for a large is ridiculous.  Athens pizza down the road was a lot better and cheaper and tasted better.",UNK
752,"Went there tonight for the first time. Really good experience overall. Great upbeat vibe with cool music, beautiful men and women. The sushi was very goo, the infused sake was too. Service was prompt and kind and happy hour prices quite reasonable.",UNK
753,This gym has everything I need for a great workout. My only complaint is the free weights are scattered everywhere. People do not put them where they belong. If your looking for a 25lb plate check behind the 45's etc. Water taste like chlorine so I bring my own.,UNK
754,Steer clear of this hotel.  Mediocre rooms but very unpleasant service - they do not honor reservation requests and have nothing but excuses. Bar is way overpriced.  There are MANY choices in Charlotte - do not consider this hotel as one.,UNK

759,Mr Bigelow PhD is too busy with his extraterrestrial studies to understand that being a slum lord is a bad thing.,UNK
760,This LA Fitness has a wider range of age groups than the one down the road at Scottsdale and McDowell. The 4:30 Monday Bootcamp class is awesome! Especially if you like to get your butt kicked.,UNK
761,"We had dinner there on Sunday, January 26, 2014. The service, food, and atmosphere was wonderful!  The owner/chef came to our table and chatted with us for a few minutes. We will definitely go back!",UNK
762,"( I think I'm the last customer)  The tacos al pastor are loaded, I think they need a tad bit more seasoning,  tripas between soft and crunchy .... too bad they close at 1am",UNK
763,The concept is great and the raw foods are very good.  But it all falls down with the service.  I've experienced long waits here.,UNK
764,"Cheap, but inconsistent punctuality. I called an hour in advance only to be an hour late to my appointment and this has happened twice already. Only call if you want a cheap fare.",UNK
765,Only got the fries and the black cow shake. Neither were good. Maybe next time will be different.,UNK
766,"These guys were great!  Arrived on time, professional and didn't leave a mess.  Will definitely hire again!",UNK
767,"The taste was a 3 star, but $6.49 for a 16 oz iced vanilla soy latte? Really? Definitely minus one star for the ridiculously expensive prices. I could have gotten 2 drinks at Starbucks, and taste isn't much different either.",UNK
768,Slow service and the people serving food don't seen to be in a hurry at all to help the customers. I guess bad management.,UNK
769,Dumpling skin was too dry & thick. Stuffed ingredients were flavorless. I suggest you to go to Mei Xiang Yuan instead which is on St-Catherine street.,UNK

778,"Nice enough place, but expensive hotels should at least have a little bit of noise containment, and this one doesn't.",UNK
779,It's big.. There's no long wait but the service is getting worse.. Don't expect to much,UNK
780,Like the food when they have it available...twice no Caesars Chix and tonight no Carbonera,UNK

784,"Incredibly this place is even worse than what other reviewers have said about it. Feel free to eat the cereal for dinner, it's right across from the scary looking sushi.",UNK
785,"Wonderful! The signature burger & Mac dish, fruit Tea were excellent, great service right up there with Bachi burger",UNK
786,Good price. Pretty good gyros. con... they need to clean the tables down.,UNK

789,"Excellent, professional and  prompt service.",UNK

791,"the deli is ok for lunch or if you want to pick up a quick dinner to go.  but everytime i'm here for groceries, i just wish for one thing: A Whole Foods in Champaign.",UNK
792,"Truly bad food.  I hear the pizza might be edible.  Atmosphere is cool, though, no kidding.  Maybe go for beers.",UNK
793,"I'm sorry to be the Chinese Californian raining down on everyone's parade, but I grew up eating dim sum and China King does not cut it. I thought the variety was limited and the taste was meager. I...will not return. :(",UNK
794,I will try again when they have so e time to work out the bugs.  Need some sort of children's menu.,UNK
795,Best Latin American food in Vegas IMHO. I don't know what they put in that green sauce but I could drink it straight and die happy.,UNK
796,"Friendly staff, clean bathroom, ATM worked, cheap drinks in comparison to other places in the area.  I'll be back often...",UNK
797,It is big.  It is in Las Vegas.  It is a convention center.  They have conventions there.\n\n'Nuff said.,UNK
798,Its just too mediocre. I got my hopes up walking into this place because it wasn't a chain operation--can't justify trying them again though,UNK
799,"A+ amazing stuff. I love the feel of the place, the service is casual but professional and the food is next level outstanding. When it is on the ever changing menu, give the lamb osso bucco a try - it is fantastic. Prices are reasonable to boot.",UNK
800,"Go with the Sicilian Pan.  We've been eating here for years and it never disappoints.  Be ready to wait 30 to 40 minutes for a pizza, but it's worth it.  Beer prices are not bad and service was great.",UNK
801,Sat at the bar and had the worst service I've ever had!!!!! This place is so overpriced its a joke!! The only good thing is the cheap oysters.,UNK
802,Doughy. Is it really a bagel? Great atmosphere and fun to watch them flip the bagel. Got it to go and walked down the street munching away.,UNK
803,"yep. tons of feta on the feta gyro hides the fact the meat is missing. \n\nweak.\n\ntry king gyros on 43rd/tbird. little out of the way, but way better and you wont leave hungry.",UNK
804,"Always wonderful.  Not only does Betty and her staff make my dogs feel so welcome, but she is always so nice and sweet when I come in to drop off and pick up.  I have been coming for several years and always refer her to other people with pets.",UNK

812,"Exactly what the doctor ordered.  Good pizza, great service, casual atmosphere.\n\nWent twice in three days!",UNK
813,"The coffees and frozen drinks are very good. The yogurt was premade, so the granola was mushy.",UNK
814,WTF? They used to make great fries here and now all they have is deep fried  diced potatoes Gross! Get it together Jac's there are too many good restaurants in Madison to phone it in on a Friday night.,UNK
815,"We stopped in for a snack and to warm up on a rainy November day in early afternoon and had a very pleasant experience sitting in the small lounge bar area. Only a few other people were there, the hot, mulled wine hit the spot and the other snacks were tasty.",UNK
816,"Went for dinner with husband. There were plenty of Italian variety choices on the menu, as well specials. The pasta sauce was authentic, the food was good, the waitress was attentive, and the place was clean. It's worth checking out.",UNK
817,I can aways get what i need fast and it is not over priced.,UNK
818,Its a great place to eat a special meal but I wouldn't go here again for lunch. A little expensive for lunch. great fried shrimp though.,UNK
819,This place is nothing to write about! It was a 1980's flashback. The food was not very good and neither was the service!,UNK
820,Eh. Average. Bad service. I had the meatball sub and it left something to be desired...probably won't go back....there are too many places with similar food to waste my money on mediocrity.,UNK

824,Love this place! It's only 5 minutes away from my place and it's so good and unique! Going here more often.,UNK
825,"SUPER SLOW! Never been to such a slow Cafe Rio. There was no one in line, but it too 10-15 minutes to get food. Poorly organized staff.",UNK
826,"greeter which is basically security was the coolest dude there, they have hardly any wireless routers and when you ask somebody a question they are always in a hurry to get away from you to go on break i would not return to this location at all",UNK
827,"They have a very wide selection of stuff to choose from and they can even do some unusual requests as well. They are always reasonably priced, on time and the quality of their product is always good.",UNK
828,The food here is average and reasonably priced. A neighborhood place that you could learn to frequent because convenience of location and quick food.,UNK

830,"Terrible service!  It took more than 30 minutes for our food to come out at 1:45 pm on a Sunday!  And it was hot inside too!  I asked for AC and they didn't turn it on. My first, and last time to this place.",UNK
831,High Roller was more like Sloooooooow Roller.   So slow that we all thought it wasn't even moving.  Make sure to go at night!  We went at night and all the lights were amazing.,UNK

837,Excellent food. First discovered from delivery pizza but later came to dine in...even better! The house salad and mussels are amazing. Super personable staff too.,UNK
838,"I had a new shower built by these folks back in 2011 and it's been holding up great.  They were quick, did a good job, and stand behind their work.  I had some warranty repairs done a few months ago.  Very happy with the service I got and the end product is very nice",UNK
839,"I hear this place is hopping at around 2am.  I were here around midnight, on a Saturday night and it was dead!  The floors were sticky and the service was lacking.  I may try it again sometime but I'm not racing to go back immediatley.",UNK
840,Don't do global airport parking here- cheap but we could have walked back to our car faster since we waited over 40 minutes and called twice for shuttle back. Unless you like to walk- I would not have minded the 1 mile stretch. Pretty junk service.,UNK
841,"Great state of the art facility, funded by the very generous Thomas Siebel. A lot of the research that changes the world goes on in this facility. It's spacious, busy yet quiet, and full of amazing people working all day long.",UNK
842,Great food and great value!  A hidden gem in the lakes area.  Prices reasonable and quality good.  Can't say much more... if you get a chance try it!,UNK
843,"My friends and I really enjoyed the appetizers, entrees, and desserts that Chef Gina prepared. The food was unique and delicious!",UNK
844,Would not recommend.,UNK
845,Re writing my review the owner handled the situation with professionalism and handled the situation with etiquette not displayed at other business.\nI will definitely give it another shot,UNK
846,Food was okay.. Some flavor combinations didn't work together. Also menu is obscure other than the pizza and pastas so make sure your an adventurous eater,UNK
847,"The worst, the store manager is unprofessional and not very bright. He brings the whole establishment down. Never ever will I ever go back there. Disgusted!!!",UNK
848,"They boast that they have the worlds best pancakes - and it is true! Each bite tastes like toasted butter! Quick and friendly service, cheap, and located inside the Golden Gate Casino.",UNK
849,"The cookies aren't that great, sorry. I can hear the people down the hall banging each other's brains out. Kinda gross. The shuttle service is cool. Location is O.K.\n\nIt's only day 1 so we'll see.",UNK
850,"Great waffles, buttery & fluffy. Awesome syrup too. Bacon was perfectly crisp, and even had a nice amount of grease on the strips to add some moist texture. Honey lemonade was very refreshing. Great little place for a simple, well done, breakfast menu.",UNK
851,The food is ok but if you like service without a smile then you will also find that here!,UNK
852,Excellent rapport qualit\u00e9 / prix...\nLes + : Situ\u00e9 id\u00e9alement sur le strip\n           Le prix,UNK
853,Absolutely the best restaurant! !! Try the caramel pork chop & lobster.. the view is spectacular.,UNK
854,I am giving three stars based on the food. Good/consistent food. Very disappointed that Lindo didn't honor its own unexpired coupon for a free kids meal on Monday night. Not cool. I'll be going elsewhere in the future where coupons and offers are honored.,UNK
855,"Except for the guy yammering about Foursquare at the next table, this place was awesome! Really good veggie options and delicious tabouli in a cool neighborhood.",UNK
856,Had escargot for the first time .. Interesting not sure ill ever try that again but the salmon was good,UNK
857,Margaritas were amazing. It was a nice place to have good food and watch the football games. It helped that the manager had a bears Jersey on. Tortilla soup was great.,UNK
858,Went here 3 times and all 3 times I enjoyed it. Very good doner. I usually go to the other village on Jean Talon which is also amazing but I like the decor of this restaurant better. Keep in mind that they're not the same owner.,UNK
859,Best deal in the plateau. Get the half or quarter chicken plate. The chicken is juicy and they fill your box to the top with fries. I swear the woman who serves you is a saint. Call ahead to avoid the line. Also if you go before two it comes with free dessert.,UNK
860,"Despite the unnecessary/confusing layout, the Miracle Mile shops are definitely worth a browse. My favorite was the Bettie Page shop, they have some great dresses in all sizes there!",UNK
861,"Worst breakfast ever :( . I am so disappointed. Had their special with eggs, meat, potatoes and a pancake. The pancake is too large and tastes terrible. Fried eggs are tasteless. Bacon undercooked. Potatoes terrible. Coffee bad.",UNK
862,The Lox works was okay - overall the taste and ingredients was okay. The service is friendly but slow.,UNK
863,"Let's start with this; my waiter was a 30 year old guy with eyeliner caked on. Okay... that's it, you can find a better place to have a drink.",UNK
864,good food bad service! recommend just doing take out!,UNK
865,fantastic eatch concoius place. The tuna salad is out f this world and all of their smoothies rock! So grateful for Pita Jungle!,UNK
866,"Tried to visit the store on many occasions, tried to email the store, never answered, hard to write a review when you can't even get in touch with them to talk to.  Why have a business when your never open or get back to a customer.",UNK
867,"I've been coming here for years.the happy hour deals are unbeatable. The service is almost always great, unless they're training a new person, because they've had their share of waitress drop outs. But the constant team is fabulous.",UNK
868,I would go back one more time to see if it is better then hot and juicy,UNK
869,"Thanks Yelpers for the suggestion, in town for a few days and looking for a place to get my Taco fix, this place really hit the spot, and the sauce bar was stocked well and the selection of hot sauces was great!",UNK
870,Awsome nail place! The customer service is great and the work is perfection wouldn't go anywhere else!,UNK
871,Great Restaurant with great food nice wine. The inside ambience is good but there's no nice view of the city.,UNK
872,The chili cheese dog was to die for...it still had that awesome snap when I bit into it. The taste was amazing. Service was good and cheese fries I got to dip myself. I will be back!,UNK
873,"FIrst time at a Supper Club. Tons of fun! Definitely a different experience. Cod is delicious. Two pieces is plenty with all the extras you get (rolls, potato, salad, relish tray...)",UNK
874,They offer daily specials as well as $8.99 prime rib 24/7 which has always been delicious. Open atmosphere.,UNK
875,"My new hang out spot. Dani, the server, was wonderful. The appetizers were great! That's all we ate, the tacos and the Chicken Lolipops. Price was perfect for happy hour.",UNK
876,Super fun workout! I actually look forward to my once a week barre class. Time just flies by here. They switch up workout routine often to make it challenging n fun. All the instructors are very friendly. I just love the energy here! Definitely would recommend it to anyone.,UNK
877,Very disappointed. I've never seen or tasted a more disgusting burnt thin crust pizza. And they fact they delivered it to me is even more pathetic. I tried to reach out for the manager with no success. They are quite friendly at Papa Johns across the street.,UNK
878,"Quite a scenic location, and that's what you are mostly paying for. I could see taking a date here or maybe some out-of-town visitors but I would not make it a regular breakfast or lunch dining spot. It was nice to see the gallery with local artists' work.",UNK
879,"Had the worst experience eating at this restaurant. Cashier in front gave us the worst attitude.  I used to come to this restaurant every time I come to Las Vegas, I will not go any more.",UNK
880,It was soooo much better before they changed the name! Way to pricey now for what you get. Menu turned more upscale. The old Bavarian was a much better place.,UNK
881,"Not impressed. Maybe I came on a bad day, but the cookie I got was so doughy and just flavorless. Took a bite and tossed it. The brownie my friend got was okay-better than the cookie but still forgettable. Wouldn't come back here.",UNK
882,They stop serving at 7:30pm on a Saturday night.\n\nThat is retarded.\n\nThe End.,UNK
883,"Ew. I am just judging one crepe (the vegetarian mushroom one with b\u00e9chamel) but it was really, really bad. Not worth the line!",UNK
884,One word... bland.,UNK
885,GROSS!!!! We ordered the Appetizer Combo Platter and found pubic hair in one of the fried green beans! Made me lose my appetite.,UNK
886,"I don't recommend this place to anyone. Me and my friends came here because it was one of the the only restaurants that open for 24 hours. I had crispy caramel chicken. Unfortunately, it was poor quality. The staff was friendly; however, it wasn't worth it.",UNK
887,"Absolutely love their beef bulgogi stew! Brought my mom and sister here and they loved it as well :) wait times can vary though, but it sure is well worth the wait!",UNK
888,A friend recommended we go here for desert and we're glad we tried it.  It was different.  A nice change from ice cream.  The employees were helpful in choosing a selection.  It could have been cleaner.,UNK
889,Good pizza not the best! But good,UNK
890,They're too busy gossiping with one another to help customers.  I live right across the street but I'm going to drive out of my way to go to the next location on Boulder Highway.  Wish me luck.,UNK
891,The mango habanero wings are freakin awesome. Not impressed with the fries at all. \n\nThe staff are very friendly...,UNK
892,"Best sushi in area.  Once they get the right service, this place will grow on word of mouth.",UNK
893,We have a business dinner here. The food was alright. We ordered a bunch of pizzas for the table. Way too many raw onions and black olives - but the sausage and crust were pretty good.,UNK
894,Costco business center food.  Just your very basic breakfast at a decent price.,UNK
895,"Not a bad looking hotel on the outside. Not a bad casino, but the rooms are crap. You can't lock the door when your in the restroom.",UNK
896,What is all the hype about??  The burgers are greasy and fries not that great.  Sorry In n Out only 2 stars from me.,UNK
897,Located next door to Planet Hollywood this is a great place to pick up all the stuff you forgot or got confiscated from your carry on bag LOL.  Prices are a little higher than normal but hey it is Vegas!,UNK
898,"Average taste, huge portions",UNK
899,Great food and the service was pretty quick as well.  We had a party of 10 and everyone enjoyed their meals and drinks.  Can't wait to go there again!!,UNK
900,"Update is just an FYI - Bite has closed and held its last dinner service on August 11. They say they are looking for a new venue. Gift cards for Bite will be accepted at their sister restaurant, Vivo Kitchen in Sewickley.",UNK
901,"Great service, fast & friendly!  I go there every year.  Got the $4 off AND was told they will accept other company's coupons, yay!",UNK
902,Awesome custard and burgers.  Nothing says greasy happiness like cheese curds.  They do it right considering they are a big chain..,UNK
903,no more food @ cathouse... \n\nclub only now.,UNK
904,Great ambiance and drinks... horrible service!!!,UNK
905,"Ultra trendy yet not pretentious! Such a cool vibe, great service and mouth watering food and drink. This was our second visit to Andrea's and we'll definitely be coming back on our next trip to Vegas. Love, Love, Loved!!",UNK
906,"This is a pretty average coffee place. The owner is super friendly and the coffee is good enough that I have no complaints. There is food available though it wasn't the most terrific. I'll definitely stop by again, because it is definitely worth stopping by when in the area.",UNK
907,"I am not normally a huge fan of Denny's but, they gave me FREE BREAKFAST YESTERDAY!",UNK
908,"Don't come here if you value your lungs.  You can light up anywhere.  We moved multiple times and could not get away from smoke.  The ventilation is not good enough for the smoking that goes on.  Wynn offers a Vegan menu everywhere, but doesn't care about your lung health.",UNK
909,Horrible experience overall. Went a year ago and still dealing with billing issues.  Called and made an appointment well in advance and still waited over 2 hours to see anyone.  I would not recommend this office.,UNK
910,"So they've moved to a new location and become a restaurant/wine bar.  The old place had such a good ambiance, the new place however is pretty plain and boring. The food is still good but it's just not the same",UNK
911,"Best fast food burgers you can get ANYWHERE. I spent the summer in CA and had In n Out Burger a few times, and there's no comparison. The toppings and fries make it the best. Load up your burger fo' free.",UNK
912,Good experience always. Very good crust whether you want thick or thinner crust. God selection of toppings. Worth the trip.,UNK
913,"My favorite Filipino restaurant in Vegas, that's all!",UNK
914,"Change your name. I went to cheese 'n stuff to buy cheese and the choices were laughable. It's not even a cheese shop. If your interested in purchasing cheese go to Duck & Decanter, Wedge and Bottle, or AJ's.",UNK
915,Room was outdated and gross. We will not stay again,UNK
916,"The best thing about this outlet center is that it is indoors and rain or heat wave, you can still shop comfortably.  The selection could have been better.",UNK
917,"Classy, great service!  Fun atmosphere.  Lots of interesting choices on the menu.  Our waiter gave us some good tips.  \nthe sangria was delicious and my husband said it was one of the best martinis he's ever had.",UNK
918,"This is the place to load up on $1 draft beers while you wait for your table at Margaritaville.  That way, when you're seated you're already buzzed and don't have to waste money on $8 Landshark Lagers!  You're welcome!",UNK
919,It's okay....,UNK
920,I found a pair of Prada pumps here on sale for $90!!!  Crazy good deal.\n\nI have to deduct one star though for the appearance of the store and shitty outdated outlet it's located in.,UNK
921,I like this place. The food is pretty good and it's a good value. But how come no napkins in the dining room? I also might encourage management to wash and/or replace the plastic bowls they use for chips.,UNK
922,"Great BBQ dinners.  I have had the chicken and beef and both are excellent.  I especially like the \""Thank Q\"" donut at the end of dinner.  Very unique touch that keeps me going back.",UNK
923,Tried happy hour here with my boyfriend. The appetizers and beer were great!  We'll have to come back and try their full menu sometime.,UNK
924,Sandwiches are pre-made and put in a microwave to warm up. Even after that my sandwich came out cold and had to go back to ask them to microwave again. The iced tea tasted like it was brew several days earlier. Overpriced.,UNK
925,"The service was ridiculous, took about 20 min before our server attended us after being seated in what felt to us like a high school cafeteria.  After the food was finally brought out it was cold and didn't taste like eatable.  I would never go back.",UNK
926,"Love the designer brands, low prices and nice people.  New styles every day. Awesome!",UNK
927,There server sucks 100 degrees outside.she asked if we could sit outside.also they couldn't make my daughter a grilled cheese.I guess no cheese n white bread.your better off going to ihop!,UNK
928,Love the pizza here!,UNK
929,LOVE this restaurant. So many tasty choices! Best northern chinese food in AZ. I feel so happy to go here.,UNK
930,The food was good nothing to go crazy over they did however bring out a bean dip with the salsa that was very good & different from most places. The decour was fitting for a mexican restaurant,UNK
931,"Great food, average Mexican dive style restaurant. Staff is friendly, service is fair on the speed index",UNK
932,"Convenient, yes. Not the best deal in town. Seats were not very good and NOT as described when I purchased. Would seek other ticket sellers. And there are a lot.",UNK
933,"What a disappointment, Service was horrendous I took 45 minutes to get drinks to the table.  Steaks were poorly prepared and my NY was tough. Sides how ever were very tasty.  \n\nDo Not Go Here unless you only want potatoes.",UNK
934,7:53 happy your cold food really why these restaurants suck so freaking much thank god for good company,UNK
935,"Had the smoked meet sandwich. It was good, but nothing amazing.\n\nI would normally give this place 4 stars, but wow, the people that work here are jerks. Extremely rude and obnoxious. I would never go back.",UNK
936,"Great food. Incredible staff. Fun atmosphere. I love trader joe's. \nIf you are looking for affordable organic food - look no further. Besides that if you aren't satisfied then you can bring it back. This place is full of friendly, helpful people.",UNK
937,Food sucked. Strawberry's were kinda fresh. prices way too high. no more chicken up grade available. prices too high,UNK
938,Sorry to say we went there for lunch and they have closed. The note on the door said they did not pay the rent so they have been locked out.  Well the one in Surprise is awesome so guess they get all my business,UNK
939,Always super friendly staff.... I always use the drive thru and they are speedy and get everything correct. The grilled corn is yumm-o  the BRC Burrito is a good choice as well.... Guacamole is very good.,UNK
940,Great coffees and chocolate. The staff is really nice but unfortunately they are not enough to take care of rush hours. I feel bad for them because when you go there and it is less busy they take good care of their customers.,UNK
941,It's an outlet in the desert....what can I say It was hot....there is a parking structure next to the stores and it was packed did not have to wait to long for a spot.  Bring water and your walking shoes.,UNK
942,"Terrible experience and service! If you order food during happy hour, check the pricing! The waitress wouldn't correct her mistake and kept on giving excuses. Not cool....",UNK
943,The food is different than before. I think the par cooking is the issue. The plate is very hot the food on it is not and it is not as tasty as I remember it being kinda makes me sad I loved the Tampico stuffed chicken before and now not so much..,UNK
944,The best Italian delivery! Large portions and always good. Super fast delivery and staff excellent at handling orders. Salads are fresh. Which is hard to find in a restaurant that delivers.,UNK
945,If you don't know you better ask someone! I believe the best custard in town!,UNK
946,I ordered a large pepperoni pan pizza togo. I normally like pizza hut but for some  reason the pizza seemed way to greasy and didn't taste that great. In fact I got naseous after eating 2 slices.,UNK
947,Nail room has the best selection of gel colors and they're very sanitary. I love this place!!,UNK
948,"Very small, but wonderful food and wine. Some of the staff mentioned that they worked previously at Bomberos Cafe & Wine Bar (now Timo's Wine Bar).\n\nThe concept of this place is killer.",UNK
949,David & Amelia are just outstanding. My Pfaff emb machine has never worked better. This is the ONLY place I will ever take my machine.,UNK
950,"Greg is so professional and knowledgable. I have older windows and tried to get estimates from other companies but no other company knew how to properly install blinds with my complicated windows Not only did Greg know what to do, he did it for a better price!",UNK
951,"Staff is very friendly. Service is quick. Food is \""eh\"".   My advice is use lots of sauce because the veggies and meats don't have much to offer.",UNK
952,"Great service and very reasonable price. I stuck my tractor in the mud yesterday, my neighbor and I couldn't get it out.  Called Allen's this afternoon and by 4 PM he had it out. He charged less than half of what the other guy quoted me on the phone.",UNK
953,"Neat!! This place has the most random set up as you will find in other reviews. Menu is all organic, our bar tender/ server was very entertaining. The location was a bit hole in the wall, but once inside very worth it!",UNK
954,"Out of all the hotels that I've stayed at in Vegas, this one is by far my favorite place to stay. The rooms are great and the beds are amazing. I especially like the location.",UNK
955,"Super friendly staffs.cool drink for this hot Vegas weather,got our fav drinks after our gorgeous massage next door",UNK
956,Creative food but okay quality.  Very small quantity. Great service. My favorite is the lobster taco. But probably won't come back.,UNK
957,The  little crown is just as fun as the big one and a lot less crowded!  The old man and I are found there during football (soccer) season watching the games and hangin' with other locals.  Carlos is the best bartender EVER and quiz night is a ton of fun!!!,UNK
958,So relaxing combined with the meditation  and reiki. I'm still floating somewhere out in space. And breathing so much better. This was my first time and I will definitely be back.,UNK
959,Rooms were clean and staff was friendly.  It was a nice change of pace to not have a casino inside.,UNK
960,Something about their drinks seem off. I've had Coffee Bean at several locations and this one has seemed weird every time I've been.,UNK
961,Generic Montreal strip club. Woman are beautiful depending on the night you go and what time. Its pretty dirty and needs renovations but aside from that the dancers make it worthwhile.,UNK
962,This will be a popular destination of ours as the weather heats up. My daughter loves playing in the water rings at this place.,UNK
963,"Good Southwestern food: Addictive chips, efficient service.",UNK
964,"I've gone here twice now because of a Groupon. But I have to say, I'm not impressed. Both times the server wasn't very friendly and the drinks were expensive and not well made.",UNK

969,Staff was nice and helpful explaining the menu. Food was great. It hit the spot. I had the ham and cheddar panini and chicken noodle soup. Little pricey but worth it. I will be back. I'm excited to try the rest of the menu.,UNK
970,Clean.  People coughing all over the place.  Slow service with Shrek playing over and over again (even with no kids in the lobby.)  Bring a book and prepare to wait.,UNK
971,"The food was flat and not overly fresh. It is worse than its Uptown competitors by far. The portions, however, were generous, but that does little good if the food isn't great. I would not go back.",UNK
972,Ice cream name game ROCK!,UNK
973,worst place i ever been to. just plan rude. girls are a -1 but they think there 10s.,UNK
974,This is my favorite gym out of all the 24 hr fitness in Las Vegas. It's very clean and newer than the other locations. I've been instructing here for two years and absolutely love the members. Very nice!,UNK
975,"Thank you Jessica for fixing my disaster of a haircut! It is clear that being a hair stylist is your passion. Thanks a bunch! BTW, my friend loved your work as well.",UNK

977,Love this place. Love the feel to it and love the boat ride through the joint. They did a good job making u feel like ur somewhere else,UNK
978,"Unless you're flying international on a foreign airline, no airline can touch Virgin America. I actually feel like a paying customer and not a low-rate private in the Marines.",UNK
979,"This has to be the best Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas, hands down.  The rice with the nopal, the coffees, the birria tacos, the lost goes on. Ambience, staff, and food are all reasons to return.",UNK
980,"Food is good but pricey and the portions are small. When I spoke to the manager about the portions, he stated their corporate office determines the portion size and that he hears complains all of the time concerning it. - Skip it - my son and I were still hungry after eating.",UNK
981,"Been there several times, and service always polite and prompt.  Food good to very good.  Great neighborhood restaurant.",UNK
982,Very good food and very friendly service! Kids eat free every day all day too. Awesome! We liked the ambiance as well.,UNK
983,"Absolutely the best club in Vegas!! Everyone is really cool, the entertainment is awesomely bizarre. The drinks are great, the staff is amazing, and I had a blast. Good times!!",UNK
984,"Dirty! Why I came back here today I have no idea.  What part of \""I WANT MY BAGEL TOASTED!\"" is not part of their language.  I just don't get why a simple request is never right at this place.",UNK
985,"not a big fan of kbbq but had lots of selection and fairly cheap with good service, always had my drinks filled to the rim",UNK
986,"I love their macaroons, and the sandwiches are tasty as well!",UNK
987,"This is a small quaint restaurant located in Indian Trail, NC near the Walmart, the service was good and the food exceeded our expectation.  We would go back this one is a keeper.",UNK
988,"I cannot stand inconsistency, and that is what you get here at this location. Sometimes it's great, and other times it's just not.  So, I find myself coming here less and less.\n\nPlus side the staff are very friendly.",UNK
989,I found this place and it's a small place. The owner is very friendly and the staff was ready to help and pointed me in the right direction of the stuff I needed. They have a lot of different items such as vitamins and supplements. Great place I will be back,UNK
990,I had a hot turkey sandwich. It was very good and the roll was nice and fresh. The service was not at all what I was expecting. But the whole Caesars complex was a downer.,UNK
991,I feel asleep.... it wasnt that good... some of t he stunts were cool.. but other than that... it was okay,UNK
992,Came for a quick cone before getting on the tram. It is what is to be expected from a small ice cream shop.,UNK
993,Great airport to fly in or out of.,UNK
994,Good southern food with a Greek influence.  Wish this was closer to home. Have the best chicken n dumplings only once a week!,UNK

997,"First timer to RigaTony's.  Good food, great service!  A new favorite local Italian restaurant.",UNK
998,John is definitely a wonderful massage therapist!  His studio is peaceful.  I felt as though I had high end treatment at an affordable price.  Very detailed oriented and extremely knowledgeable about the body.  Not forceful yet very effective.  I would absolutely refer him and I plan on going back.,UNK
999,Food is okay. \n\nServer Blake was kind of condescending and I don't know if it it's because we were one of the only tables of color eating there. \n\nThey do offer a happy hour but the options seemed limited.,UNK
1000,"What's not to love about Sunny's diner? Home of the best breakfasts in Tempe! Not over priced like that LOUSY Chompie's - better wait staff, better service, better menu! All Hail Sunny's!",UNK
1001,"Tourist trap but excellent Poutine nonetheless. I had the Poutine with smoked meat my wife went with the plain.  Both were excellent.\n\nThere is also an upstairs, which I believe is part of the same restaurant, where we had an outstanding crepe.",UNK
1002,I cannot believe how SLOW SLOW SLOW the DT is here. How does corporate not get involved? There DT wait times must be HORRIBLE!,UNK
1003,"Not my favorite Cirque show, but the transformational stage was amazing. Pay extra for seats up close. You'll be glad you did.",UNK
1004,No sashimi all rolls. not as fresh. They want you to eat every piece of rice. Overpriced. Long wait. Not worth the  time and money and not too many selections. Never coming back!!!,UNK
1005,Very dirty and disgusting. Sat down and he brought out egg noodles and duck sauce. Long black hair right on top. Got up and walked out.,UNK
1006,Hour and a half wait. Tried to talk to nurse and she just walked away. There's plenty of other urgent cares in the area. Try someone else.,UNK
1007,I think this is the best thai in this area for sure. Their dinner dishes has really good taste and they make it look artistic and I like that !,UNK
1008,I ordered the b1 combo. It's was ono. There teriyaki beef is cherry. Recommended place to grind.,UNK
1009,"If you use this store as a convenience store you'll like it. If you try to do serious grocery shopping here, not so much. The prices are very high, and the produce is not the best. Think of it as a Super Circle K. Usually only one register open with a line.",UNK
1010,Bikram Yoga is heat yoga in a carpet studio. The studio smells like an old gym sock. I wanted to wear shower shoes just to cross the room. ICK!,UNK
1011,"It's fun, even for an old, straight fart like me. Great dance floor, interesting people watching.  Drinks are a little pricey as I recall.",UNK
1012,"Been an Aussie and in Vegas had to do the show,awesome,if you have a chance diffidently worth the experience !",UNK
1013,"Very good barbecue. Too bad it was pork instead of beef. Would recommend it though. Very friendly people, as is the norm in this part of the country.",UNK
1014,"Worst customer service I have ever experienced. Even though this Jiffy Smog is conveniently located right next to the DMV!!! I will never return, nor will I ever suggest that anyone spend money here. The long haired dimwit has zero customer service skills. . .",UNK
1015,Good job Phoenix you made something that sucks worse then the Arizona Center!,UNK

1017,"I can tell by the way it tastes that the falafel sandwich, baba ganoush and tabbouleh are totally vegan, and delicious too. I didn't bother asking them about ingredients because it's so obvious.",UNK
1018,"Great pizza, reasonable prices, fast service - cant ask for much more!",UNK
1019,Heaven on earth and free slice of bread when you walk in! Yum!  Best kept secret in las Vegas! Heaven on earth if your a bread lover!!,UNK

1022,I was looking for a great steakhouse in Charlotte! I know longer have to look any further. Between the delicious anniversary steak dinner and the best wait staff; Morton's is my favorite place.,UNK
1023,"Very loud, but what sports themed restaurant isn't. I only wish is for a plate! Wings are always big and cooked perfect. My wife told me that she wanted, \""wings and beer\"" for her valentine night out. She is my soul-mate!!!",UNK

1026,"The food was good, but nothing extraordinary. My husband loved the chocolate shake.  Service was good.",UNK
1027,"Don't let the proximity to the food court fool you- this is a nice, sit down restaurant. Yummy Italian food & great service.",UNK
1028,OK bar with decent beer on tap. A significant improvement from what it was before.   If you avoid the 5a7 crowd with Ubisoft across the street its actually not that bad.  But they really need to clean their taps.  The beer tastes dirty.,UNK
1029,"I can't believe how awesome this service was! My boyfriend and I thought it would be a hoax, but everything came out perfectly! No waiting in line, free admission for both of us and a free drink for me! Thanks Chris!",UNK
1030,"The Miller High Life is cheap.\n\nDead the night I went, so I didn't stay long enough to get to know the bartenders or anybody there.",UNK
1031,Might not be best area but the food and drinks were great. Friendly staff! If you go save room for fried ice cream. Delicious. Definitely going back.,UNK
1032,"Food took forever to cone out and was cold when it did. Nobody ever checked on us and we saw our waitress a whole three times between our food arriving and paying our bill.  Despite the restaurant being empty, the manager never checked on us.  This place obviously is not in business because of the service.",UNK
1033,Great bottle shop on the south end. Plenty to choose from.,UNK
1034,Like a steak and shake. Good fries. Mediocre oreo ice cream bar.,UNK
1035,"Terrible service, jerk of a bar tender, he was disrespectful to the hostess in front of customers. We got served water and 25 minutes later asked what we wanted to eat. Do not go to this location",UNK
1036,"It was silly to only give this legendary place 4 stars, I stand corrected by myself",UNK

1038,Great place for dinners for a date/families. Friendly employees great food and delicious cheesecake.,UNK
1039,"I had the Euro Burger, fantastic! Best burger I've had in a long time.  You could taste every element of the burger. The fries were not my favorite,  although real potatoes, they were very dry.",UNK
1040,"We got a medium pepperoni and also a medium sausage and mushroom. I have to say I thought the customer service was friendly and just fine, the pizza was good and we found ourselves wanting more of the sausage/mushroom.",UNK
1041,"Outstanding Service of some really exciting food served in a beautiful atmosphere.  My mahi mahi serving would not have been enough for a child, let alone an adult. Other 3 in party had enough, but mine was less than paltry.",UNK
1042,"Came back for a trim, and this time had a $7.99 coupon. :) Candice was there and trimmed my locks.  Great job.  \n\nSo, kudos to Cassie & Candice. If you go, ask for one of them.",UNK
1043,Great service and authentic tasting. Little pricey but has great flavors. Nice and clean new place. The old restaurant burnt down so it's newly remodeled. Must check this place out.,UNK
1044,macaroons at 1.20 each-a bit sweet but not bad! Incredible After Eight mocha and decent milkshake.  The bacon & maple syrup cr\u00eape was great and the croque madame sandwich was tasty as well,UNK
1045,Chicken was ok the the person at the counter not very friendly\n\n.,UNK
1046,Why I cannot give zero stars? The straff was very impolite and unfriendly when i asked some questions about the prepaid cards. They were not capable of giving right and useful information. Bad service!,UNK
1047,"Obviously, don't go out of your way to come here. But if you're staying at Monte Carlo, it's not so bad. I had the Ribeye steak which was actually cooked properly (medium well). Not much more you can ask for from your average casino cafe.",UNK
1048,"By far, the WORST food in all of Arizona if not the Nation.\nNothing more needs to be said.\nBuyer beware.",UNK
1049,A more high end mall just on the N boundary of Montreal right on the cusp of the 15  and 40.  Check out the SAQ as it's one of the best wine selections for SAQ in Montreal!,UNK
1050,"Super friendly staff, moderately priced fantastic food. Can't wait to come back!",UNK
1051,I was looking for a go to pizza place and I think I may have found it in Gino's. Had the Hawaiian pizza. It's was delicious. Plus the drivers have credit card machines which makes for easy payment when you don't have cash.,UNK
1052,I like Denny's      But this place is low quality for its high traffic  the food is not all that good   I have seen a few people who are not satisfied with this service this will be one Dennie's I won't come back to,UNK
1053,This is my daughter's 2nd year at ASA.  I appreciate the emails teachers send me regarding my daughter's progress or places that needs my attention.  I especially appreciate the lecture videos teacher created and the free tutoring time at lunch.  I am thankful my daughter study at ASA.,UNK
1054,This place has the best pita sandwhiches i have ever had.  Their pickles and hot sauce are my favorite ingredients.  The only thing that sucks is I typically want to go on Saturday and they are not open.,UNK
1055,"The pizza was decent but the appetizers and service left a lot to be desired. The server's attitude bordered on downright rude.\nNext time I'll skip the trip and get delivery! Better yet, try out a different local pizza place.",UNK
1056,The food tasted good but my stomach hurt shortly after...  My friends' tummies were OK so guess it was just me.\n\nThe restaurant claims to have famous meatballs and their meatballs are indeed tasty.,UNK
1057,"Cheese sauce.  Not cheese, cheese sauce.  Burnt carne asada and pink Carne asada in the same burrito. They couldn't even make my daughter's quesadilla properly.  This place is to be avoided.",UNK
1058,Not impressed at all. Drinks take a while. Like a long while. Like when Bigfoot has to get a spa mani pedi. This adventure is going to set you back a few minutes. I've had doctors visits and cable company appointments arrive sooner.,UNK
1059,"Very nice, you could lose time in here for several hours if you are not careful...",UNK
1060,"Just got an eye exam at Costco. I was a little hesitant, but they took my insurance. They got me in the same day and ordered my new glasses with no fuss. Very impressed.",UNK
1061,Sooooooooo slow. Open tables all over the place but still waited 35 minutes to be seated. Once seated waited a long time for waiter to even check if we wanted water.  Food was good but not worth the wait. Hate to see how this place runs when all the tables are taken,UNK
1062,"I was disappointed because this place seemed really fun, but after standing right at the bar and being passed several times by a female bartender who clearly did not want to be there, we never got served so we left.",UNK
1063,"Not like your local foods. If your a foodie, you can spend hours in here. There is a huge prepared foods area, a bar/tasting area, coffee area, smoothie bar, huge olive bar and chocolate bar.",UNK
1064,The staff is nice .... Tables never seem to be clean and treys the beef brisket was great except for the bread,UNK
1065,"Had a horrible time here.  service is horrible everyone is robotic and it was noisy on my floor, i left the day before check out it was that bad. wrote a formal complaint and they didnt do anything.  oh well guess i wont be doing business there",UNK
1066,"Horrible customer service. I was literally hung up on while trying to get pricing for my clients. Avoid this printer at all costs. They do not understand customer service, I am extremely angry and offended.",UNK
1067,"The best of the best! Highly recommend, they did a great job and I would definitely use them again.Thank you Total Home Solutions!",UNK
1068,Having breakfast at Eggs Tc best breakfast in Queen Creek. Awesome food love it because our family loves to order breakfast and lunch at the same time.,UNK
1069,"One of our touchstones in Vegas. Consistent, well priced fare. Good place to chill and relax while watching the Fountains at Bellagio in the background. Not fussy but not a diner. Bistro vibe in a restaurant setting.",UNK
1070,Guy behind counter seemed to be texting when we walked in and a bit bothered that we said we had not been before whats good?  I just walked out I dont have time for bad attitudes.  My husband walked out with a green tea.  It was green tea.,UNK
1071,Disappointed with the bitter coffee and less than desirable ambiance.  It is loud and uncomfortable inside.,UNK
1072,"1 week after being charged the $25 no refund.  We called back today and a \""manager\"" will need to call us back.  If that manager doesn't call back today and handle it then we'll have to file a fraudulent charge with our bank against the bar.",UNK
1073,This place is super close to where I live and I am glad it is. I have ordered from them twice and both times I was not disappointed. Pizza and wings hit the spot!,UNK
1074,This review is based on the waterfall only its a must everytime I come to vegas I was soo happy they changed the music to my faaaaaavorite MJ song Billie Jean. I love the show its amazing what you can do with water and sprinklers,UNK
1075,"This is a small farmer's market. The variety is minimal. The atmosphere is very friendly though. It is fun for the kids, but if you want to actually shop, not too good.",UNK
1076,"one of the best workouts ever! it's difficult, but fun and i always leave feeling better than when i arrived.",UNK
1077,"I went to this nice place, and i will go many time. I had the maple syrup macarons and was Delicious.",UNK
1078,"I always come here when we they have crawfish in season. But all of their other dishes are great too. Tonight the service was a little off, but all in all dinner was still great as always.",UNK
1079,"Excellent wings. Had wings at Duff's and Anchor in Buffalo, NY. This place got them beat!!! Honey BBQ, Honey Habanero, and ATL dry rub were simply awesome. Highly recommend this place.",UNK
1080,30 mins and counting... I still don't have my food. The restaurant is half filled. What happens if it was a fully packed?,UNK
1081,Chickens ok.  Their beef sucks.  Haven't tried the pork.  If It wasn't for the hot sauce I'd of not finished my food.  Don't know how or why this place is rated so high.  You've let me down fellow yelpers,UNK
1082,"Close to dining and you can take a boat shuttle to and from either the baseball or football games.  Although the Sheraton which has a great location is here, I do not recommend this outdated and nasty bed covering hotel.",UNK
1083,"Had a @groupon, went to have breakfast.\n\nThe prices were not bad, but the specials were high enough that the groupon wasn't a great value.\n\nThe food was decent enough, and I would likely return.",UNK
1084,"On time, excellent service, and speedy.  It was a pleasure doing business with them!",UNK
1085,A pretty decent airport.  It gets you going to where you need to be.  They have phone charging stations.  The food was pretty good.\n\nThis place got me to where I needed to be; it did its job and Yay! I'm a fan.,UNK
1086,The sandwich are made with fresh ingredients and their is a good selection of options. They taste fantastic! You'll never settle for Subway again! Plus they have loaded baked potatoes!!!,UNK
1087,"I'm not sure why people like this place so much.  The wait was long, the food came out cold, and the pastas were overcooked, gluey, greasy messes. The service was friendly but the food was very poor. Will never go back.",UNK
1088,If I could choose no stars i would. Frozen vegetables and flavorless food- that's what authentic is all about.  I applaud the effort but this restaurant should contact Gordon Ramsay. AVOID! Florindinos is more authentic,UNK
1089,Bagels are great but the service really sucks.  Even the guy running the place seems to have an attitude when you walk in.  I'm from NY and I end up going to Einstein bagel because I don't want to deal with these people.   It's pretty sad!,UNK
1090,"Ok so, bumping you back up. My friends dig it and I very much enjoy your sangria, warm vibes and company Firefly. But don't think for a second you can take my love for granted and start slippin' on me again.",UNK
1091,There are so many other better breakfast places...,UNK
1092,"I cannot come here anymore as much as I would love to have a nail salon so close to my house, I will drive 10-15 min now for better quality and attention to detail. Also lacking cleanliness in some areas.",UNK
1093,"best burger ever!!hands down five guys smashes in and out.free peanuts,mountains of fries and awesome toppings.",UNK
1094,Look good to me  Burger Bar will look,UNK
1095,service was ok but the place smells like a urinal cake,UNK
1096,"Amazing! Seriously amazing! From the amuse to the banana cream pie, everything was utterly delicious. We started with the  steak tartare and the crab and shrimp Louis. We then split the American Waygu ribeye and the lobster. Hands down the best meal ever!",UNK
1097,"The sushi here is very good, and reasonably priced for the quality and quantity you get. The contemporary vibe and layout of the restaurant is pleasing, and the service is very friendly. I'm also glad they kept the polished log benches/chairs from the previous incarnation of the establishment.",UNK
1098,Very fair.  Went with waiter's recs & shouldn't have. Joe's in Florida so much better.,UNK
1099,This is cool place to eat. Great atmosphere and good food. Good people. Food has been great every time I go.,UNK
1100,"Simply put, amazing! Best carnitas I've ever eaten! Street tacos are fantastic. Try the trainer salad if you are watching your carb intake. Don't be put off by the mini-mall locale, this place is legit!",UNK
1101,The service as slow. When we arrived at the restaurant we had to wait 10 min. before someone came and took our order. The food does not correlate with the description on the menu.  Pros: Halal.,UNK
1102,This one facing Walmart is the worst Subway location as far as customer service.\nThe one inside Walmart is much better than this.,UNK
1103,"Poor quality food, bad service, high price, filthy bathrooms.",UNK
1104,"Excellent meal and high quality service.  Had an excellent chicken and fries meal and a fantastic salad.  Though this was way better than Joel Robuchon.  Also, much chiller with nice bar dining area if you are not interested in a table or doing Vegas solo.",UNK
1105,Good first experience. Second was unfortunately my last,UNK
1106,"I'm a certified Chicken Pot Pie Freak.  No one does it better than the Bagel Cafe.  For those who drive to Las Vegas, put your car to good use and drive here.  At least 5 times better than any buffet or Casino Restaurant.",UNK
1107,I like this place. High marks for food quality and friendly service. Best of all is Happy Hour. Blue Moon for $2.50?????? ENOUGH SAID. Log off now and get over to The Living Room for Happy Hour!!!!!,UNK
1108,Wasn't impressed with their Honey Walnut Shrimp. But their deep fried King Crab was delicious! Garlic fried Tofu was tasteful.,UNK
1109,"Amazing bar!! The bartender, Carmit, is freaking amazing!! ..BEST bartender ever! ..karaoke is always a blast! Actually great singers and the hosts are a blast. Definitely recommend this bar to anyone and everyone !!",UNK
1110,"Looks seedy on the outside--in fact, it's situated in a decrepit minimal with a new-vegas ghost town feel. Lots of golden oldies and new machines too. Way more fun than a slot machine, and the payout is about the same!",UNK
1111,"360, yeah you really got it twisted with the name. The place is 360 and nothing about it is gourmet, more like 360 Garbage. Roberto's needs to open a place in this airport and fast. Please!!!!!",UNK
1112,"Walked in, place smelled like a cigar shop...walked out, went to Chipotle instead.",UNK
1113,I got food poison from here. I ate just 3 oysters and 2 days later I got sick for 1week. The restaurant was old and dirty. I even could not use restroom. I'm sacred to go back there to eat.,UNK
1114,"We've eaten here 3 times and each time had great service and food. The deep fried platter for 2 is a great deal! I love the inka dish with fish and cheese and rice, it's my favorite! The selection and unique cuisine is top notch!",UNK
1115,Food was fine but not worth waiting 40min for when the place is less than half full. Just hire the staff needed to make this place run like it should.  \nI'd pass on it unless you've got nothing but time and you're not very hungry.,UNK
1116,Met a friend at 1900 for dinner tonight. The pico was delish but otherwise my tostada was nothing out of the ordinary. The prices seemed a bit high for your average Mexican restaurant but I would probably give it another try!,UNK
1117,The mac'n cheese was really lacking flavour. The Texas BBQ beans and brisket were excellent. The chicken a bit dry. And they dont give you enough sauce!!,UNK
1118,Great new place for window tint and all custom vehicle upgrades. The owner and his wife are fantastic people. They use top quality products and do exceptional work.\n10/10. Will use again.,UNK
1119,Green chile pork was amazing. And happy hour all summer is awesome.,UNK
1120,"This was a good place to grab a quick bite to eat. Pizza and sandwiches were both yummy, service was friendly. Not gourmet but a nice switch up from the usual fancy restaurants or buffets that you get in Vegas.",UNK
1121,The airport is always packed...and security takes forever...but man a airport with slot machines...I heart you..,UNK
1122,"Typical Red Robin, so not much to say. The rib tips are crappy, but the beer was nice and cold.",UNK
1123,"Love their fried pickles, they are my fav. \nCustomer Service is great there too!",UNK
1124,Stay away from buffets in Vegas...too many people around food...easy way to get sick!! Trust.,UNK
1125,"Not your usual PC boring venue. Amazing experience great performers, host, music audience participation were all perfect. Blows a lot of the other big budget strip shows out of the water.  \n\nI would totally go see this again!!",UNK
1126,Three stars on price. Four stars for the food. FIVE STARS for the Chicken and the Egg breakfast!! \nEverything was perfectly prepared. Atmosphere was that of the European market.,UNK
1127,"Very Good but not great unfortunately.  I had the full course tasting menu and was mainly impressed with the dessert offerings.  Being not much of a dessert guy, this was a letdown since I had such a high expectation.  The other dishes are not as memorable for me.",UNK
1128,We came here for lunch...... The sandwiches are HUGE and delicious.  I can't wait to try breakfast!  Will be back soon.,UNK
1129,Food are little bit salty but the service is great. If you prefer something more special to try than buffet. Stratta would be a not bad to try. I highly recommended the tata beef appetizer.,UNK
1130,Great food but it's more of a night club / restaurant.,UNK
1131,"Very clean store. It is very well organised. I often feel overwhelmed in these types of stores, by I was fine here. The associates were nice. I will be back to this location. I definitely bought more then I came in for!",UNK
1132,Food so good that I wanted to eat them with my genitals.,UNK
1133,Good but not the real deal.  The big 3 pizza deep dish places in Chicago I feel are better.,UNK
1134,Came here during vacation and thought of trying it out. The portions are really big and reasonable pricing. The food is made from scratch and was DELICIOUS!!! DEFINITELY recommend this place,UNK
1135,Not bad... the Restaurant.com coupon helped make this 2 star restaurant into a 3-star.,UNK
1136,"Nice airport and the Southwest experience was great and affordable as usual,",UNK
1137,"This park is so nice and beautiful! Great playgrounds, fun train ride and carousel. Splash pad to cool down in summer too!",UNK
1138,"Local bookstores are often a delight, but Changing Hands is truly delicious...mmmm....books. Plus, I saw Sarah Vowell here which was uber cool.\n\nyes, I am a fan.\n\nboom",UNK
1139,"Crap wine selection served in dirty glasses. The food was good, but the dirty glass makes me wonder if the plate was even clean. Great fast service so I have to give them some credit.",UNK
1140,"Been here once, loved the idea of it. The sweet lady that served us just kept bringing us different foods, I thought that was awesome. We had our 2 year old with us and she was sweet with him and catered to what little kids like. The food was decent, not exactly super memorable.",UNK
1141,The past three times I have been here I have gotten sick!  Talked to another person the other day that had also been sick the next day after eating here.  Won't be going back.  Not worth getting sick over!,UNK
1142,"Love everything about this place, good decor, food, ambrosia hookah is the best! Happy hour is also a good time to go, 4-7pm! I will come here often!",UNK
1143,a good selection of interesting fusion or classic Indian fares but not everything passes the test on the menu. the wine by the glass selection is poor. The location is nice and restaurant comfortable. During warm days the terrace in the front is very pleasant.,UNK
1144,"Great hot sandwiches. I would highly recommend. Hidden off the West side of Scottsdale Road. Small interior. I would expect a wait if you hit the noon crowd. I've never seen anyone shop at deli, but the shelves break up the restaurant nicely.",UNK
1145,Never buy anything from this store. They fraudulently change your contract after you sign everything. We need anyone who has had problems with this store to contact me.,UNK
1146,"Just came from China Chili for lunch. First time for me. The service was very fast and friendly. The food was fine too, nothing really special but fine. I would go back if in the neighborhood.",UNK
1147,"I stopped in the Albertson's on my way home because of a sale on Coke.  The store was clean and bright, and the clerk who checked me out couldn't have been friendlier.  Parking is OK here and it's easy off and back on Flamingo.",UNK
1148,"The worst french fries EVER.  Wouldn't feed in n out fries 2 my dog.  That said, the burgers are slightly better than average.  I would rather pay more and get Fatburger.",UNK
1149,My friends and I have been coming to Tonic consistently for over a year now - you can not beat their happy hour and they actually play great music videos!  Who else does that these days - not even MTV!,UNK
1150,"Kandice at Linwright Design, LLC is extremely knowledgable about social media marketing, search engine optimization, and website design.  She is super creative and will help your business thrive in the social internet age that is constantly changing and evolving.",UNK
1151,Way way way overpriced!!  $12 for a burger fries and a drink. F that. In and out is the way to go.,UNK
1152,It is the place I go for burgers.  Fatburgers.  The shakes and fries simply tidy the meal up in my opinion.  :),UNK
1153,Two words- grilled pears. In the words of Rachel Ray- YUMMO. Go here...you'll enjoy it!!!,UNK
1154,"Cheap beers, and Irish Nachos are awesome.",UNK
1155,"Best chinese food in vegas, hands down. Homemade love in there and guess what?? the staff is nice..even on the phone. the prices are too absolutely die for! i spent more in gas getting there than i did on the food. love u guys",UNK
1156,Love going to Town Square to escape the superficial atmosphere at the strip.   Makes me feel like I am back in Cali.  Love the place and there is always something to do in the day time and evenings.\n\nA great place for kids.\n\n4 big stars,UNK
1157,Arnold Wrap is really good - but I don't think I'll be back soon because $8.50 for a wrap is insane.,UNK
1158,"Near the freeway. No food court, but the bathrooms are new and clean. Shops are decent but these are one of those outlets where everything is not an outlet. Go if you are on your way to a cards game :)",UNK
1159,"I stayed at west tower, it was ok, rooms smelled great and clean, affordable.\nThe buffet was awful. Next time I will pick another hotel.",UNK
1160,Kind of similar to Panera bread but much better choices! Lots of exotic flavors. They have a patio area for outdoor eating. We shared the French toast and feta breakfast sandwich. Both were good but the French bread was amazing!,UNK
1161,The food is good Chinese food though I did get sick once. The owners have been rude several times rushing us our the door saying there were people waiting. Also the men's room needs a deep cleaning,UNK
1162,I've only been here once. The donuts were okay but didn't seem special. Although I got there at 7:30 a.m. they didn't have a single donut with nuts on top. \nCash only,UNK
1163,the staff here is not enjoying their work. It feels too much like a factory assembly line here in here. SMILE PEOPLE ! Life's too short to be miserable.,UNK
1164,I love the pizza but there is always atleast a 45min wait for a table. But I have learned that you can pre-order your pizza so it will be ready close to the time you get seated. But their salads and deep dish is really good.,UNK
1165,"Best pizza I have found in Las Vegas.  Small dining room for eat in, but nice staff,  and decent pricing.  Antipasto is great, as is spagetti &amp; meatballs.  Very casual, but pleasant. Two thumbs up!!",UNK
1166,"So yummy & so fast! House special chicken & orange chicken are my favorites. Plus they use all white chicken breasts. I love that \""spicy\"" dishes can be ordered a little more mild; satisfies the entire lunch group dining together.",UNK
1167,I am a fan of their pita.  It was so fresh and warm.  Excellent!  I prefer the hummus at Pita Jungle though.,UNK
1168,Terrible sandwich. I don't care if it's a Pgh staple-- it's gross.,UNK
1169,We switched from a 'competitor' to Quality in the middle of or stay in Madison.  The switch was the right choice for use because the Quality Inn was great!  The rooms were spacious and clean.  The pool and spa were great!  The expanded breakfast was delicious.  We had a great experience here.,UNK
1170,"How this place won  6 yrs in row Best Buffet Award, is beyond me.\n\nMediocre at best, I would not waste money in here, many more choices  to go to.",UNK
1171,"Bright uncomfortable sitting area. We get it, it's a happy place : -). The wait is horrible on the weekends. The food is excellent though.",UNK
1172,Brought my friends to Sura today. Would not recommend this place..meats tough and not fresh including shrimp. Not good value for your money ay 25.99 per person. Did not enjoy the food.  Would not go back.,UNK
1173,"Delish! I came from California and randomly stopped into this place. I had the Santa Fe, it was delicious!",UNK
1174,Gotta love the Pizzookie and the Dirty Monkey!! So worth the wait!! Legalize Marinara!!,UNK
1175,A great place to stop off for a drink and the food is excellent!  Locally owned - a gem in the neighborhood,UNK
1176,"I really like the pizza and they deliver! It's a nice thin greasy style pizza. The toppings are a little scarce, but the price is good. Don't order sausage.",UNK
1177,Great place to donate your gently used items to help out those that need it.\n\nEveryone is always so friendly and grateful.  Maybe one day I can give more than just items.,UNK
1178,"Great authentic Hawaiian style food. Service brings this place down. Employees tend to be snippy, to downright rude. Orders frequently come out incorrect. Great food though.",UNK
1179,"When you order two pizza at the same time and they are given to you at one time with one undercooked and one overlooked, that takes talent.  This place has talent.  I love CPK, but need food to be consistently well prepared.",UNK
1180,Food is always good.,UNK
1181,"Facilities are OK for a conference, with the exception of the bathrooms that are woefully inadequate for any group larger than 20 persons. There were over 100\nattending today's meetings.",UNK
1182,Absolutely awesome!!! Food is fantastic and service matches! Our second time here and will for sure be back many more times. Don't miss this place!,UNK
1183,"Sorry, but our pizza was cold.  All nine cuts of it.  And the garlic wings didn't taste like garlic.  Maybe it was an off night?",UNK
1184,Pizza was good but over priced! Beer was 5 bucks during happy hour c'mon! If it were next to Oreganos I would go to Oreganos everytime.,UNK
1185,"The Pho here is delicious, and thee people are nice.",UNK
1186,"At the end of a long day and you want some great food in the neighborhood stay away from the chains and visit  locally owned Auslers Grill.  The daily specials truly are, do yourself a favor and enjoy one.",UNK
1187,Good burger and fries!,UNK
1188,"Unprofessional, rude, and like to argue. No thanks!",UNK
1189,Service is usually slow and the food is meh.,UNK
1190,"OK, like everything in this little area.  The price was alright, my burrito was alright, the salsa was alright.  There's got to be a better place close by!",UNK
1191,Laurie Roth is the absolute best colorist and hair cutter I have ever had. She is extremely knowledgable and knows how to make my hair look fantastic. Her prices are also very reasonable. She is a gem!,UNK
1192,"I wasn't very impressed with the food. Service was friendly.\n\nOther reviews have summed it up pretty well.  Decent, reasonable, nothing exceptional.\n\nStandard Mex, yo.",UNK
1193,It was thanksgiving day!  And I know I was thankful they were open!,UNK
1194,Simple.\nBlack bean burger. Yes.\nJalape\u00f1o hummus. Absolutely\nBeer. I'm there.\nGood prices. Done and done!,UNK
1195,"Really, very expensive. For real.\n\nWhen you spend $160 for a meal for two that consists of 8 small dishes and only two (duck tongue tacos and shu mai sampler) that really kill it, you've simply wasted your money.",UNK
1196,a 3 day kitchen remodel has turned into an 8 day job. all these 5 star reviews must be from people they know.  the only good thing I can say is that at least they answer their phones.,UNK
1197,Randomly stopped by while in Charlotte and had the best curry / hummus I have ever tasted. I wish they could ship their food to sf so I could eat it all day!,UNK
1198,Great place for dinner. The steaks and seafood are first class and worth the price. Try everything on the menu.,UNK
1199,Donuts are a 5.   Drive thru and wait times are horrible.   Total cluster f$&k\n\nIt should not take 25 minutes to get through a drive through\n\nThe people are nice but their process is so inefficient,UNK
1200,"I WILL NEVER again order from this people. No taste in that food, I would have throw it away but I was so hungry. The food was the worse ever!!! Ended up with upset stomach.",UNK
1201,Have had happy hour at this place now twice. Love the appetizers and the drink specials are great. Will keep returning.,UNK
1202,"This is for the Voodoo lounge -\n\nThe view is nice, but everyone is rude and treats you like a second-class citizen.\n\nNo thanks, I didn't come to Vegas to be treated like dirt.",UNK
1203,Today was our first time in here. Food was amazing! The cobra burger with grilled onions was fantastic!!,UNK
1204,Chicken fried chicken was dry but the green chili macaroni and cheese was good. Service was OK.,UNK
1205,Food was really good. We went on a Thursday night where they have 2 for 1 appetizers (helluva lot of food). \nThe service was also great. I will be visiting a lot more often.,UNK
1206,"I stopped by this little restaurant one day and I read the menu that was hanging in the window. That is when I noticed cockroach crawling out from behind it. Needless to say, I was so disgusted, I did not order any food. Truly gross :(",UNK
1207,"This place is has surprisingly good chinese food, but it's waaaaayyyyy overpriced.  But I eat here anyway since it's close to TAO and I'm usually way to drunk to stumble any further for food.",UNK
1208,"3 1/2 star, the food is good, however, way too pricy for what it is.  We shared two meals amongst four people and we payed around 30 bucks each!   Next time i'll go, i'll just stick to the bar with the live acoustic music.",UNK
1209,"Stopped in for the first time today, couldn't be more happy with the experience. Ribs were excellent,  service was great and very attentive.  Highly recommend Smoky Jon's and will be visiting again soon.",UNK
1210,So wonderful! Large portions and friendly service. I recommend the shrimp and spinach omelet... Its amazing!! There's no shortage of ingredients so bring your appetite. But honestly everything is delicious... Take everyone you know!,UNK
1211,Am impressed with how Cracker Barrel responded to this. The Manager called and we talked about it. My review stands as this was reflective of our experience at the time. We will try this restaurant next time we are passing thru as we have had 3 other pleasant experiences at this location.,UNK
1212,very nice sound effects & overall a great show - great cast/actors(ress),UNK

1214,The food was excellent. I tried the cranberry mojito and it was so good.,UNK
1215,I love this place.  It's hard not to enjoy yourself at a midget bar.  I wouldn't eat here under the drunkest of circumstances but for a few drinks and a good time with friends you cannot beat it.,UNK
1216,"Lovely, small theater. Anywhere you sit is a good seat.",UNK
1217,Ok I have to update... Took another forever to get our bill back and it was the wrong freakin bill.  Whatever.  It was the same ish cost so we finally paid and are leaving 5 hours later.,UNK
1218,these guys are the real deal! i got quoted to fix my ac for over 800 bucks and I got referred to Black Sheep and they had my AC fixed for less than 200 bucks! They are honest and will only use good parts to fix your car! I recommend them for any issues with your car,UNK
1219,"Shit service! Shit....\nIt's too bad there is a lot if competition in the area, and the menu looked great..",UNK
1220,"Too Busy, long waits, over worked staff, and expensive for Pizza.  Other than that the food is Okay.",UNK
1221,Food is always good at the Maple Leaf,UNK
1222,Ok 10 days in and the gel looks perfect !! Except where the growth is . I'm so happy . My old (nail place ) was very crowded and the gel would peel off a nail a day or two later. I'm so glad I found this place !,UNK
1223,Half my nails were filed square and the other round. They don't know what they are doing. Waste of money.,UNK
1224,"Pretty good. Nice chips, good burrito. Haven't found any Wonderful mexican in Madison so far, but this is not bad.",UNK
1225,This is the worst Golds Gym I have ever been too. The air is dense and hot like there is no ventilation. Seems very humid inside and most machines are old and starting to break causing them to not work right. I would recommend a different gym.,UNK
1226,Not even going to write anything.........miserable,UNK
1227,My husband and I enjoy trying new restaurants especially non-chain ones.  We have been several times to La Bona Pasta and have had a great experience each time we've been.  The staff is friendly and the food is delicious.,UNK
1228,"Very entertaining.  Lots of audience engagement.  Get 2 free tix by going to mentalist.com and clicking on \""las vegas\"" link and signing up for his newsletter",UNK
1229,Robert G. Was awesome! He checked my tire and fixed it for free! I've been a Toyota customer for years and this is why!!,UNK
1230,"I had the fish tacos, which I used to love. Tonight they were meh. Service was okay. My friend had the warm pear salad and enjoyed that",UNK
1231,"Very meh. Didn't really care for the atmosphere. Very forgettable and bland. You'd be better off trying somewhere else for dinner and saving time, money, and your stomach. \n\nNot. Worth. It.",UNK
1232,great cheese pitas  and dessert! The owner is also super helpful.  He explained to me and my husband what each item was and also gave us his suggestions.  We bought a bunch of different types that came straight out of the oven hot.  We literally sat in the car and devoured it.,UNK
1233,"Doctor Capobianco & his staff are amazing, & service is excellent. They are always accommodating, & they go above and beyond for their patients!",UNK
1234,Excellent job accommodating our group of 40 people.   The staff were all very friendly and the food was excellent as always.   Price was reasonable also.  \nI would definitely recommend and I  will be returning.,UNK
1235,"Very good Pad Thai and the soup was awesome! The location is really good although the outdoor seating could be more abundant and well shaded. Service was a little lacking as well, but I have to say again.. the Pad Thai was really good!",UNK
1236,Had lunch here. Ate the shrimp ceviche tacos and they were delicious. My husband had the shrimp po boys and shrimps were cooked perfectly. Not greasy. Service was good. Highly recommend.,UNK
1237,Great place to get awesome holiday decorations on the cheap. TONS of other things too. Brand names for 99 cents and they even have produce.,UNK
1238,Came back to get a scone. I decided on a strawberry scone. It was huge but flavorless.,UNK
1239,Cupcakery. Monte Carlo. \nCoconut. \nStrawberry shortcake.\n\nthe cakes were Moist. Not  too sweet. frosting was alright. definitely a solid cupcakery,UNK
1240,"Great place to grab a few drinks- very loud and busy though. Went here for dinner but they had to order the food in from down the street - it was okay. I had a mojito and it wasn't the best I've had, but great atmosphere!",UNK

1242,Outstanding good value and very fancy cuisine in a dive location.  I think I will violate the no repeat rule on vacation and go back again.  You must try,UNK
1243,poor service.  Ordered twice for delivery.. always at least 30 -40 min late from promised delivery time.,UNK
1244,"Service is good but a very old/bad glass of wine, prices are up and portion was down on the Butterfish dish.  Very disappointed, don't think I will return again.",UNK
1245,Best. Burger. Ever.,UNK
1246,"As a visitor to NC, I heard raving reviews about macs. Great service, the pulled pork was delish and trust me you want double serving of the Mac and cheese. \n\nThe portions are big and the prices low. This is def the spot you want to be.",UNK
1247,Worst crepes I've had. Dessert crepes were cold and rubbery. Definitely not fresh. The ice cream had a bad taste. I would never eat here again.,UNK
1248,Sooooooo slow. They do not process a line very fast and most of the time they mess up the order in the simplest of ways. When I've gone inside the employees seem flustered and not in a groove you would expect morning employees to be. Hope they figure it out.,UNK
1249,I love the Bison wrap.  The jicama fries are okay; I like mine with a little honey or barbeque sauce.,UNK
1250,All of the positive reviews for this place is legit. I came here right before flying out of Phoenix; definitely in the top 3 Mexican restaurants that I have ever been to. Food was extremely flavorful and the portion was big from what I remember.,UNK
1251,"The service at this location is hit or miss.  The restaurant is clean,  but sometimes the dishes and silverware are not.  The food is satisfactory for a TGIFridays.",UNK
1252,"I have being here a couple of times , and all experience so we're excellent. .food is delicious , atmosphere is great. .love the complimentary bread..fettuccine to die for..definitely my place to eat when I shop at fashion show",UNK
1253,"I HIGHLY do not recommend your money at this place because it is a waste of money. The food is undercooked and is OVERLY over priced. It's my first time here, and I will wouldn't recommend to come here. But everybody had their own opinion.",UNK
1254,"I like their smoothies but their wraps and sandwiches are always inconsistent and pretty pathetic. Portion sizes and ingredients change time to time. For the price you pay for the sandwiches and wraps, totally not worth it. I'll just go there for smoothies if I guess...",UNK
1255,"if you sit outside be prepared to wait a long time for service.  it's unfortunate :( water should be served right away. the foods good that's why I'm giving it 2 stars, but do not come hungry or thirsty.",UNK
1256,The Bluebird sandwich is my all time fav! Highly recommend  any of the homemade soups. Great locally owned place that makes great coffee too!,UNK
1257,"Went here on a Sunday afternoon, and only one employee was working. The line was long, but she kept her attitude up and got through everyone's orders flawlessly. \n\nClean restaurant, clean bathrooms, good lacation.",UNK
1258,Horrible dentist. Tried to upsell me on literally everything and told me I needed six fillings replaced (that had been done all within the last few years). Plus the facility itself was dirty. Gross!,UNK
1259,"The food is great, fresh and delicious.  An authentic Indian Cuisine Restaurant with an unbelievable lunch buffet, the service is excellent and is priced reasonably.  This experience is worth the drive.",UNK
1260,"I did like this place until we set for 30 minutes and no service, now I know why it's never crowded.",UNK
1261,The hotel was excellent. You are greeted when you leave and when you return. Check-in was effortless. The room was clean. Housekeeping come and clean the room twice daily. The front desk was always helpful. I would say this was the best 5 star hotel ever.,UNK
1262,California roll was good. I didn't care for the sauce that came with the blue crab and the service was terrible.,UNK
1263,"Food here was OK, but the service was AWFUL. We waited a full hour from when we arrived until our first drink order came, then didn't get a food order in for half an hour. I recommend any other place at MGM instead.",UNK
1264,A bit overpriced. Food not as good as advertised. Our group bought food from 3 of the places here and were not satisfied with the quality.,UNK
1265,Great BBQ!!!,UNK
1266,"This place was horrible! I paid 200 dollars for dinner for two, my steak was still mooing! If you are in Vegas and want a real steak, Gordon Ramsey Steakhouse does it right!",UNK
1267,A,UNK
1268,"Save your money!!!  You get quoted one price and get charged way more, happened not just once but twice!!!  Not worth it...",UNK
1269,It's not as great as xs but me and my girlfriends have great memories here:),UNK
1270,I agree with everyone's reviews.  Even the drive through is slow.  It isn't the greatest location but I do have hopes that they plan to upgrade the location.  There isn't many choices in buckeye for food add it is,UNK
1271,Probably as close to the real New York as you can get here in Vegas. The highlight of this casino is the roller coaster of course. If you are a thrill seeker this is definitely the place for you!,UNK
1272,best in town.  always go back for more.,UNK
1273,"Nice place, good prices, and friendly people. I'm not on that side of town too often, but it really hit the spot. I had the buffalo chicken fingers, which were standard bar\n\nI'd return if I'm out that way again.",UNK
1274,Not too good.  Very sweet and the price is very outrageous.   Pf hangs because it left me hanging.  Waitress was awesome though. Steph....,UNK
1275,Store closing but not quite sure of the date. There are some deals to be had but there were also a bunch of holes in the store when I was there a couple weeks ago. It's worth checking out if you are a bargain hunter. You never know what you might find.,UNK
1276,"If you're in the mood for a great Vegas establishment with top quality food without the long pesky wait, or burning a hole in your pocket. this place is for you.\n\nVery well priced, and great food selection. The onion rings are very delicious.",UNK
1277,"They always have a lot of employees but nothing every seems to speed up. The lines, wait, and food take forever. Like everything though since the other one is inside a very busy Wal-Mart your better off waiting in line here.",UNK
1278,Just got done eating here. I had the bacon omelette. Wow it was fantastic. Our service was great. Food came out fast. I have no complaints.,UNK
1279,Definitely not the best sushi but you gotta love the prices!,UNK
1280,Nan's and non veg curry was good....loved the custard fruit salad......biryani was not up to expectation......god knows about veg food....lamb curry was good....,UNK
1281,"I tried their yakisoba and as far as cheap Asian-y takeout-y noodles go, I can't believe I'm saying this, Chopstix does it better. It's edible though so whatever. Lol.",UNK
1282,Yummy!  I had the Reese 31 Below.  The small is a great size.  My huband had an ice cream cone.  We both demolished our sweet treats! :),UNK
1283,"One of my favorite lounges in Vegas for the generally upscale crowd, ample seating, and elevated vantage point from the 1.5 and 3rd floors.",UNK
1284,They have a great happy hour that we take advantage of.  Cool little guitar player/singer in the corner providing some chill John Mayer/classic rock covers.\n\nThe manager came over and introduced herself and gave us a free app for a future visit.  Super friendly!!  Thank you!!,UNK
1285,Extremely slow service.... go elsewhere!\n\nQuality of the food wasn't bad but ladies and gentlemen you will have a few birthdays by the time the food comes out.,UNK
1286,"Only place I go and have gone to for over 3 years.  Anyone you ask in there knows who I am and that I come in weekly.  Love it!!  I would tell you who I see, but that might make me getting an appointment harder!!  HAHA",UNK
1287,food is ok.\nSpecialty drinks are better.,UNK
1288,"Yelp Hours say they are closed on Sundays but they are open. This place is a lot nicer than the original location on Main St in down town Mesa. The food is not as authentic, missing the orignal location.",UNK
1289,The staff worked with me regarding my son's food allergies. We had an awesome time eating dinner. Great atmosphere!,UNK
1290,Small place in the cornor tucked away.  There aren't many shabu shabu places around so this will do.  It's clean and service friendly.  Things weren't explained the first time but I am sure once you know how it goes it's gonna be good.,UNK
1291,This happens to be one of my favorite clubs in Las Vegas.  The decor is fantastic and the atmosphere is peaceful and exciting at the same time. There are go go girls here and they dance amazing.,UNK
1292,"My husband and I went in August 2013...the service was really good and the manager is a great guy.\n\nFood was terrible, but I guess you go for the views.",UNK
1293,Great vintage clothing find! Whatever decade you're looking for can be found here! Clothing is all in fantastic condition! I picked up an awesome Rosie the Riveter style jumpsuit for a steal! Good selection of vintage concert tees too!,UNK
1294,Staff really doesn't care if you live or die !! They seem to not understand the concept of customer service and that less customers equals less money for the business . What a waste of a good location.,UNK
1295,"Great food and great atmosphere. Come from a Thai family and this place, considering its hipster location and demographic is surprisingly authentic. Service was a little slow so order everything in one shot.",UNK
1296,Decent pricing on the Juice\n\nOk Pricing on the Breakfast\n\nWAY TO much seating for the area that they have for my taste.,UNK
1297,Casual upscale dining for reasonable prices.  Gotta get the sorbet in the awesome carved ice block.,UNK
1298,Wynn Hotel's Wing Lei\nReally wanted to like it\nAlas just O.K.,UNK
1299,Delicious and moderately priced. Service was speedy and the waitress was exceptionally polite and friendly.,UNK
1300,"Food is inconsistent. I'll order shrimp curry one time and get a lot of shrimp and then another time and get two. Same with amount of veggies. Food is generally good if you live close, but sometimes you'll get a bad batch.",UNK
1301,I don't come here anymore because they are never the same ..when you eat here is hit or miss..that's pretty bad for an establishment and I used to brag about this place to everyone..,UNK
1302,High quality meat piled high on warm bread... delicious! This is a great option compared with most of the fast food centered food court restaurants. I would definitely come back.,UNK
1303,Good food but awful service. Hostess was friendly and the monkey cakes were awesome. Bloody Mary's were really good but it took 30 minutes for our food and thats unreasonable for breakfast.,UNK
1304,love the pho and spring rolls !!! the best vietonamese restaurant !! i,UNK
1305,"Queso dip is media oker. Cheese cake is good, the trio is good.",UNK
1306,Nice desert setting. Good for out of town guests.,UNK
1307,"Honestly, I'm giving it one star because I don't think it'll let me give them 0. Bad food, worse service, even worse \""entertainment\""...and those are the nicest things I can say about it...",UNK
1308,Was staying at encore so I popped in for lunch.  I had high expectations it fell flat.  Dare I say pf changs is better?  Not impressed for the money much better options in Wynn/encore for lunch.,UNK
1309,I love this place!  Very friendly and helpful.  And they carry hard to find supplements like GLEE!  It keeps me going!,UNK
1310,Ordered something from the midnight special menu.  I can't read Thai.\n\nDefinitely an interesting spot to eat at especially on karaoke night.  It can get pretty loud so be prepared to turn the dial on your hearing aid down a few notches.,UNK
1311,Had the best breakfast this morning! Try the California Omelet. Cooked to perfection along with the hash browns.,UNK
1312,This repair shop is great.  They take the time to thoroughly explain everything in terms that you can understand.  They don't do unnecessary work.  I thought I needed brakes and they checked them out and said they were in good shape.  Their prices are reasonable and they have the work done when promised.,UNK
1313,"I couldn't pick a casino I'd rather have in my backyard than GVR. The cinema feels very private, i enjoy the atmosphere.",UNK
1314,Sexy club. 10 girls getting in for free and a free bottle. It pays it be girls in vegas. Love the view here.,UNK
1315,"we popped in here for pre-dinner drinks.  I'm not an \""old fashioned\"" drinker, but my husband is.  I had a glass of wine, which was nice, and my husband really enjoyed his Old Fashioned.  Very friendly here!  Our bartender was awesome.",UNK
1316,"This was my first time and the sandwich was very good. I will eat here again and try something new. The environment was loud, crowded and not too comfortable, but I guess that's what you get when you eat in a popular spot crammed into a corner of a shopping area and casino.",UNK
1317,LOVE that this is close to my house and that the wait was only 20 min. Love both the verde and wiseguy pizza.,UNK
1318,Gas prices generally a lot higher then other nearby stations and an someone always parks in front of the air filling station. Likely this is on purpose.,UNK
1319,"We had great service,good coffee nice atmosphere. The food is the reason for the two stars.The potatoes where tasteless no shredded just frozen chunks. The biscuits where hard, not homemade and the gravy was bland.",UNK
1320,"Very nice staff! It would be not only for the best chocolate to enjoy the shopping experience there.\n\nGodiva chocolate in my opinion is the best chocolate, but also one of the most expensive.",UNK
1321,"Do your research before trying to negotiate a price with these guys, better yet, go to another dealer.\nWhat a complete waste of my time! They must think everyone who walks in there is a sucker...",UNK
1322,Expensive and time consuming. \nMy wife loves this place.,UNK
1323,"Great food! I would have given a 5 stars but the table, chairs, bathroom and one of our cool aid mugs was dirty. I will still come to this place though.",UNK
1324,"This place could be a lot better, but the service is simply not there. Went in there for dinner and it took about 45 minutes to get our food after we ordered. Waitress never checked in with us and had the nerve to drop off the check before our food even got there!",UNK
1325,I would recommend Broadstone Scottsdale Horizon to anyone looking for a friendly community. The staff are very professional and are always building a sense of community for the residents.It's a great place to live!,UNK
1326,Some times I like walmart sometimes I dont.  Meat there is always expensive.  Very hard to pricematch meat. Lines are always long.  They never have enough of the sticks that seperate the customers orders. Then on the other hand I get what I need all at once.,UNK
1327,"eh.... ok food.  Under staffed, slow, but friendly service.",UNK
1328,"Nice enough atmosphere, but poor service on a Friday evening especially since the place wasn't crowded... I guess that should have been a clue !\nAnyway, the hot wings had a nice bite to them... finally, something flavorful and hot enough...",UNK
1329,"Great food, great beer, and it's a Vikings bar! What's not to love?? The beer breads are all awesome as is the fish n' chips. And if your lucky enough to be around in the fall give the pumpkin porter a try!",UNK
1330,"I purchased 7 items from here and only enjoyed one. The Tres Leches was awesome, one of the best I've ever tasted, but the doughnuts, churros and assorted sweet breads were incredibly dry and flavorless.",UNK
1331,The staff can be a bit rude.,UNK
1332,"Food was okay,  not great. My martini was tasty.  Service was okay. The tables were too close together",UNK
1333,This hotel provided us the best view I've seen from the strip overlooking the fountain shows. The hotel was very trendy and high tech isn't even a good enough phrase to describe the ammenities. YOU must stay here if you want a great Vegas experience.,UNK
1334,"Pretty good burger place in an airport! Got the breakfast burger and it was delicious. Bacon, fried egg and a juicy patty - what could go wrong? The price is reasonable but the portion was a bit small.",UNK
1335,"Love this spot! We go once week, some times twice! Awesome spot to just kick back and enjoy an awesome prime rib, and an ice cold draft. Friendly staff, great bartender!",UNK
1336,"So retardedly slow I had time to post this review. Three people working, 6 customers in line twenty minutes 3rd up",UNK
1337,"I'm going to have to say this place is hit or miss. Unfortunately there is no way of knowing what the inventory is until you get there, but that's all part of the allure. The prices are great and the inventory is well organized.",UNK
1338,Solid 3 stars. Limited menu. Would like to go back and try the specials during the week & Happy Hour...,UNK
1339,This is a gorgeous hotel! Everything about this hotel screams luxury. Love it.,UNK
1340,Attended a tasting event here last night. I am impressed with the dedication to craft beers and friendly knowledgeable staff.,UNK
1341,"Worst Walmart on the planet went to get a cell phone and the clerk was the rudest person i have ever had the the pleasure of doing business with.  I will never spend another damn cent in that store again,",UNK
1342,I like Winco as a box store. I have visited numerous times and the place is clean and prices are good. I like their bulk candy area!,UNK
1343,"Got the Doritos supreme tacos and a grilled wrap with a cherry limeade. The tacos were soggy and flavorless because of the sour cream. Next time, no sour cream. Grilled thing was so-so. Cherry limeade was tha bomb.",UNK
1344,Have seen a few shows here and am always impressed by the acoustics. The American Soul and Rock-and-Roll Choir played last night and were excellent.,UNK
1345,"excellent food and drinks, happy hour is awesome",UNK
1346,We usually stopped by to get boba on the way home to OC. Boba here is better compared to other places in Chinatown.,UNK
1347,Based on service only. Food and shakes are very good.,UNK
1348,We want to thank shelly for taking care of our alladin while we are in Las Vegas. She took good care well. We are coming back for christmas vacation and see u soon..,UNK
1349,"I love this place.  I used to live in Squirrel Hill.  I first started going there as a bar patron, then quickly realized how great the food is.  Their buffalo chicken dip is awesome!  Its pretty great food for a reasonable price.  The bartenders are great too!",UNK
1350,I hate that MOST of the Roberto's cooks never wear gloves while cooking food ! They even sprinkle the cheese with their bare hands! Disgusting !!!!!!,UNK
1351,"Cute little place. Only tried some of the baked goods, and they were good. I hope to try their desserts and coffee next time.",UNK
1352,"Bleh. Bland, tasteless pizza, squishy pasta, watery sauce. The service was lackluster and the music is LOUD. Such a bummer, since it is so close to my house.",UNK
1353,"Wow....what happened to outback?!?! Service is friendly, but slooowww. Bread was stale. Steak cooked to order but really fatty. Yuck! Won't be returning to this location.",UNK
1354,"Terrible food at lunchtime. Flavorless, uninspiring and thus overpriced. There is such good food in Scottsdale- just go somewhere else.",UNK
1355,"Ate a burger last night, and got sick with headache, diarrahea, and the chills.  will not go back.",UNK
1356,Wow.\nExcellent dinner. Excellent wine. Wonderful friends. \n\nPerfect meal.,UNK
1357,"I love eating there.  The food is always so good and healthy.  The Mediteranian chicken salad is my favorite, but I have enjoyed every meal.  The seating is too crowded and they are always busy, but it is worth being a bit cramped.",UNK
1358,This is the second time I've been to this restaurant and both times the service was extremely slow. I will not be coming back here again.,UNK
1359,Savannah is an excellent bartender. Only reason I'm rating four stars is for poor service before she came on. Very attentive. Took the time to learn my name and drink. Great bartender had an excellent time.,UNK
1360,"The F&B is a cool environment to eat in. The food was great and our waiter was entertaining. If you like white sauce, try the Genovese pizza. Our visit was a little awkward because a waiter kept spilling and dropping on others and the floor.",UNK
1361,"Burger was good, fries were cold. It took thirty minutes to get a glass of wine to the table and we waited 40 minutes to get our food.",UNK
1362,"They don't give you a choice of 2-3 things to choose for your takeout plate and the plates are small so you get a small plate of one choice with a little rice box, but the food ain't too bad, just expected a little more",UNK
1363,Very salty...This place is hard to find..I was hoping for a good pizza..Was very dissapointed,UNK
1364,Cool place to see old photos and read brief history about Vegas. Not your typical pictures  you see everywhere else. Looks like it will be continually growing and changing so will for sure check out again in the future. Oh and it's FREE (donation box at door).,UNK
1365,"Very slow service.  Purchased lunch special that included beer.  They refused to give us beer and stated that they were cleaning their beer lines.  Poor planning, they should perform maintenance during closed hours, not during lunch time.  I would not return there.",UNK
1366,Walked in and was told that they can't take anyone. No explanation why. Terrible customer service.,UNK
1367,"Hilarious, friendly people that do wonderful work! Will definitely be coming back the next time I'm in the area!",UNK
1368,"Great beer selection,  and typical bar food. The only thing that was a not good was the seating outside we had a group of 6 but they sat us around a table for three.",UNK
1369,Overpriced sushi that's average. Drinks are decent but also pricey.,UNK
1370,"This place is fantastic. I only go to Mac's for lunch, but I have never ordered a bad item on the menu. I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys southern pork barbecue.",UNK
1371,"Great pizza, wine, and pricing. Highly recommend the veggie pizza with white truffle oil. Really great place for a night out with your hunny or great girls night on the patio. Excellent location next to bars and restaurants on Mill to enjoy after your delicious dinner.",UNK
1372,Best place I've found to kill an hour or two at CLT. Just sit back and relax with a nice local brew and a BBQ sandwich. Also got good service from the cheerful bartenders.,UNK
1373,Costly and not the best of the Thai restuarants I had.,UNK
1374,"This place is ok except all the old ties everywhere. It's like eating dinner in a closet with 50 years worth of dirty laundry. Some people like that I guess, but I avoid this place.\n\nOver priced for mediocre food.  Service average.",UNK
1375,"I really enjoyed my dining experience here there is no better way to have dinner at sunset in Las Vegas with a rotating dining floor and seeing the spectacular views on a 360* scale! Service was on point, food cooked and served to perfection and delicious! Fun romantic ambience! Will most definitely return!",UNK
1376,Took my husband here for a massage while I got a facial and neck and shoulder massage. My masseuse was great and so was my husband's. Place was clean. But I gave it 4stars because the rooms were too small to get a couples side by side massage.,UNK
1377,"Very good beer.  This is a chain brewpub but has high quality food and beer.  On par with the location in Sioux Falls, SD that I visited a couple of years ago.",UNK
1378,"Horrible experience! Paid for the most expensive wash and the car was still dirty on the inside, not wiped down, terrible vacuum job, windows smudges, the list goes on...waste of money, will not be going back there.",UNK
1379,"I love the look of this store. The walls with the descriptions (such as dairy or seafood) are eye catchers. Everything is clean, which is always a bonus when it comes to food.",UNK
1380,"Been here a few times, I guess I go for convenience since its close by.  It's an OK place but I had better.  Service is good and the product is like I said OK.  I've had Mr. Sushi on Black Canyon HWY which is better.",UNK
1381,Mini taco salad is the best item I've had here.,UNK
1382,Sushi Pizza - Enough said,UNK
1383,"big portion. \ncan't go wrong for Mediterranean food, its not stellar but satisfying.",UNK
1384,Great for some upscale Mexican. Not a taco joint.,UNK
1385,Overpriced and not worth it... Boooo.,UNK
1386,"Food is good but service can be hit and miss . I recommend the tacos and taco salad, great margaritas and tall draft beers",UNK
1387,Really enjoyed the food and staff. They have a great wine selection. Will be going back.,UNK
1388,Unsafe environment.,UNK
1389,Costumer service by phone was not friendly... The basil fried rice was really too spicy and not even good taste... I will never order again from this restaurant..:((,UNK
1390,"decent pizza depending on when you head in (sometimes the pie has clearly been sitting there for awhile). \nThere isn't that much good pizza by the slice in Madison and this will do the trick in a pinch, but don't expect anything special",UNK
1391,"Loved the fried chicken and waffle dish.  The spice and the maple syrup really worked well together.  My wife's chilaquiles dish was excellent, also, and she also enjoyed their signature iced coffee drink.  Nice vibe in this place, too.",UNK
1392,Not only was Angelo's Italian lemon water ice awful but they also had the nerve to charge a BLEEPING ten dollars for our two cups. We tossed them in the garbage after one spoonful.\n\nVery artificial in taste with an odd texture and very expensive.,UNK
1393,The rooms are small especially the bedroom.  The view from our room is fantastic.  The pool area is not large but there is a large area outside with misters with plenty of shade. Happy hour snacks were light but the bar tender was spot on.,UNK
1394,"The food is good, healthy and fresh. I usually opt for the chicken shawarma with a Greek salad.\n\nThe staff is always polite and attentive. One of my favorite quick, healthy and inexpensive spots.",UNK
1395,"Service is slow, and the salad I ordered was a little smaller than expected. Either way, the food was okay and staff were friendly",UNK
1396,Oooh this place always has my taste buds going!! I recommend there weekly soups and amazing salads (: and of course there cheesecake and Ice teas. You should never leave dissatisfied here,UNK
1397,Beautiful and perfect environment with a standard Benihana food!!!,UNK
1398,I've had better.  Nice decor though.,UNK
1399,"Couldn't get help to try on shoes (that I would have bought) but they have more than one person greeting at the door.  Great!  No service here, although the selection isn't so bad.",UNK
1400,"ASIAN NACHOS: IS  A MUST HAVE!!  \n\naffordable food, great for big parties!! just make sure you reserve ahead of time!",UNK
1401,"Amazing food, reasonable portions, healthy fare.  If you're visiting and want healthy and delicious, this is it.  Staff are professional, friendly and attentive.  Reasonably priced.",UNK
1402,This is by far my favorite Brewery in AZ. Food is good and I love the atmosphere and Beer is wonderfull!! What more can you ask for a Brewery! They serve good beer and you just enjoy!!!,UNK
1403,"We had a 4 day stay at the Rio and it was wonderful! The Penthouse is beautiful, the service was superb! All our needs were quickly taken care of!  Woot woot! We will be back!",UNK
1404,"Secret Garden is truly a Las Vegas treasure. It's for people of all ages. I love the dolphins and all the animal. It's a must see, really take your time and enjoy every minute of it.",UNK
1405,The food was decent..... but expensive\n\n\nBUT THE WAITRESS SUCKED\n\nTHE END!,UNK
1406,"I love it, the two piece leg and dark is quite tasty. I will definitely go back, they have remarkably fresh salsa.",UNK
1407,Dont eat here its nasty and they recycle their food.. The only good thing about this restaurant is its damn cheap hhahaha if you are cheap and want cheap quality of food then you eat here you cheap ass hahahah,UNK
1408,My wife loves this place and I have to say that I love the toppings... Not a huge fan of frozen yogurt but this place hits the spot.,UNK
1409,"Expensive, stingy, crappy food, uncooperative staff...meh, it's what we have available I guess.",UNK
1410,Man this is my favorite chinese place in the queen city by far.,UNK
1411,"Return visit for cholesterol bomb aka cheesesteak\nRoll was sparse w meat. 2 cheessteaks, fries and drinks over $30\nGetting ripped off makes me feel like I'm back in Philly",UNK
1412,This location is sooooo nice!! We sat outside on the upper level. Very nice ambiance and server. I got the gorgonzola burger and it was delicious!!! I really like this location and I'll return in the near future.,UNK
1413,"Brilliant buffet- super spongy naan, crunchy pakoda and samosa were my favorites. If u r dying for some good Indian food, this place will definitely satisfy you",UNK
1414,"I got a burger that was ordered medium and was beyond well done. It's a burger, figure it out",UNK
1415,Good hang out for sports. This place does get very crowded on peak hours.  Good Happy Hour!,UNK
1416,Terrible service. The wait staff has real attitude problem. Mongolian beef was chewy.  Moo shu pork plain additional charge for more wrappers!!! Overpriced...for what you get! Go somewhere else!,UNK
1417,Confirming that it's closed!  Just drove by it yesterday.,UNK
1418,"It's really not a Mexican restaurant so much as an Americanized version of Mexican. The burritos are OK, but often lacking a bit of flavor. The tofu in particular needs a bit of improvement.",UNK
1419,Kyle and Tracey are really good and nice would recommend getting.,UNK
1420,There food is delicious and they have a fine selection of gelato. The inclusion of the coffee bar is a nice touch. The spring and fall seem like the best times to go given the beautiful AZ weather. Give this a place a try!,UNK
1421,Why mess up a good thing? I asked for extra tomato sauce and was grossed out when I discovered that they squeezed extra sauce all over the top of the pizza. For some reason this pizza tasted disgustingly sweet. This was my Spinato's pizza.,UNK
1422,"This place is good. I love Italian food, this is fast food. Thats why only 4 stars. But it is still great. I always go here when I cone down to Vegas...they need to expand and build some in norcal.",UNK
1423,The brisket is so good it made me question my atheism.  The mac 'n cheese is also killer.,UNK
1424,This place is gross. The food is not good at all.\n\nMy husband and I were in search for good Mexican food (and still are) good thing we only ordered one burrito I couldn't even choke it down,UNK
1425,"I'm not a fan of this place, I've been here numerous times for some snacking or quick bites and I've always left disappointed",UNK
1426,"I had ordered the Club and Chipotle Chicken Avocado , which was extremely delicious from the first bite I took! The bread had taste just perfect and there was plenty of taste to both of the sandwiches!",UNK
1427,= = = = = =  CLOSED  = = = = = =\n\nThis one has closed (& we're just as well off without it).     :-),UNK
1428,It's quite big for a starbucks.  Right across from the university so lots of students.  It does what starbucks do.  it's good.,UNK
1429,"Nary a stumble upon arrival.  All avenues are clearly marked.  I'd agree with the nickname of America's friendliest airport.  Everyone from security to the rental shuttle driver gets a big thumbs up.  So, arrival was smooth.  Hope departure runs the same.",UNK
1430,"Heart Bar holds a special place in MY heart.  Why?  Because I met a 14-large bachelorette party at this bar.  Needless to say, it was a perfect weekend.  \n\nNote: Unless you're looking for hookers, avoid this place after 1am.",UNK
1431,Loved the Sunday Night Pasta dish. Good prices for Vegas. Nice servers & ambiance. Would recommend to travelers. A better version on Cheesecake Factory.,UNK
1432,"Burgers overpriced, buns stale, fry's cold, nothing special!   Nice atmosphere, but not worth the wait.  4 people, hamburgers, fry's, iced tea, over $80 bucks!   Hmmmmmm!",UNK
1433,"Great bargain for an \""off the strip\"" place that has everything. Liquor store not over priced. Everything was a \""good deal\"".",UNK
1434,"I had been this place many time, and the pho (noodle soup ) is my Favorite food, recommend this place have the best pho :)!!",UNK
1435,Walked in last night hoping to have a nice pie and great beer but they took off Four Peaks Kilt Lifter.  I quickly went elsewhere.  Why do they replace such a good selling staple?,UNK
1436,"Only tried the adobo, but I loved it!!",UNK
1437,Stepped in for a Passport Photo. Service was very friendly & prompt. I was in & out in under 5 minutes. Thanks!,UNK
1438,"Yum, and the service is outstanding.",UNK
1439,Can't wait to go back and try more!,UNK
1440,Never again.. such a rip off!! $4.59 for a small orange juice? Are you kidding? I thought it was $2.59..even that to me was expensive..,UNK
1441,"The food was very overpriced, especially for a tapas bar. The sardines were not very good, and difficult to pick through all the bones. Also, I'd like to see more vegetarian options on the menu.",UNK
1442,"I have been eating at Los Dos Molinos for over 25 years... can't get enough. New Mexican style, hatch chile flavor (HOT!)  The food taste awesome but, beware... it will make the back of your neck sweat.  Enjoy.",UNK
1443,"I'm never staying here again! Horrible! Rooms smell, not enough elevators for the amount of people staying here.\n\nOld, dirty, just not the type of Vegas I'm used to! Some times saving money isn't worth it!",UNK
1444,"This place is horrible.  The music is bad, drinks are overpriced, and the people want to be country, but live in the city.",UNK
1445,"Very disappointed after a recent visit.  From the get go, the woman who waited on me was totally rude.  Then to top it all off she went off on a group of women who had their children with them.  Guess it is not a child friendly place like I had hoped!",UNK
1446,10 m sitting down then someone come and offer me the water\nAnother 10 minutes go bye no one comes to take my order\nMy roommate love this place I personal I think they don't know how the business,UNK
1447,The WORST customer service I've ever had. Pretty much just a bunch of stoner kids that cant do simple math n throwing items at u when u ask for something,UNK
1448,overall is okay\nhad high expectation on the duck but it is way too over marinated....\ni will give a 3.5,UNK
1449,"Before we walked in, we got a coupon for buy-one-get-one free. Hey, why not right? The bbq was pretty good with some decent BBQ sauce, but it wasn't anything super that I'd go back for.",UNK
1450,"Arriba's was not as good as they used to be, apparently the original owner passed away and its under new ownership. Won't be coming back here again.",UNK
1451,Arroz con pollo platter!,UNK
1452,They have any kind of candy you would ever want! Last time I was here I saw chocolate covered grass hoppers lol!,UNK
1453,"I wasn't here very long, but I was able to find some good food & drink easily!",UNK
1454,Always great food and great service. The Prickly Pear sandwich is a classic. I recommend the chicken wings and pizza. The restaurant has a cozy feel and it's great to patronize a locally owned establishment.,UNK
1455,"EuroBurgr, one of THE best burgers I've had in my life!!! Delicious. Get it medium rare, if not, you don't understand food. But try! Pink beef is good.",UNK
1456,Dirty...even for a thrift store. I can never find anything in here.,UNK
1457,"This place has decent burgers, but it's definitely something you can skip. That being said, it reminds me of fancier Red Robin.",UNK
1458,This is always busy.  It is quality food done quickly.  The rare beef and special combo pho is always a winner.  \nWife loves #24 grilled chicken salad w/vermicelli and egg rolls.  4 year old son kills the egg rolls by himself.,UNK
1459,"Most incompetent people and the service is horrible.   Biggest disappointment, \nRun and dont look back.",UNK
1460,"Amazing food, great staff, great service. This may be the best place to eat in Las Vegas off the strip. Went with family from out of town. Ordered scallops, halibut, cheeseburger,  and a pasta. Everything was amazing. Comfortable atmosphere.",UNK
1461,"The equipment here is really nice and my son always has a great time when we go. However, the employees and owners are so rude that it makes me hesitant to spend my money here.",UNK
1462,"They're closed now, but the Banh Mi here was better than the one at the Graze.",UNK
1463,Long wait! And the usual screaming children and bad parenting that makes this place special,UNK
1464,No a bad place. Their barbacoa is good and so are their margaritas. I love their tortilla soup.,UNK
1465,Prepare to wait two hours for mediocre cuisine.  Go somewhere else.,UNK
1466,My family and I absolutely love Mexican food and this is a great spot we've been coming to for years! The margaritas are very delicious and the food is quite traditional!The staff is very attentive and I look forward to coming back very soon!,UNK
1467,"Food is good but only if you're eating there. Out of the last three times I've ordered for pickup they forgot to place my order twice and only realized so when I got there, unapologetic at best.",UNK
1468,The food is good but the atmosphere is better.  A great place for a Friday Happy Hour after work or a Sunday Bloody Mary and live music.,UNK
1469,This is the perfect way to cool down during summer. They put fresh fruit in their Popsicles and they are extremely reasonably priced.,UNK
1470,"Basic breakfast you can get anywhere. They didn't serve real butter, the biscuits were dense, and coffee weak. Atmosphere is nice and staff was great. I will not be bookmarking this one though",UNK
1471,"Fantastic Italian subs! Just like back in Jersey...So much meat, it's like the opposite of all the other sub chains. \n\nWhy do they have to be so far from home?",UNK
1472,"Horrible Customer Service!  No smiles, no personality, they called me \""You\"" the entire time I was there.  Very Bad",UNK
1473,The Salted Dulce De Leche MILKSHAKE will change your life... Absolutely love this little place!,UNK
1474,"You wont find many places to sit, don't expect wait staff, or cutlery, but the food is good, the service is personal.  Breakfast was tasty and filling",UNK
1475,"Really cute place, but the food is not good! The biscuits I had and the English muffin that my hubby had both were dry and hard. His poached eggs were very under done and the sausage was bland.",UNK
1476,the service was so slow we discussed stiffing the waiter (would never).  the food (hot wings and chicken and waffles) was very good! so were our mind bender drinks.,UNK
1477,Couldn't even get through to make a reservation. A brief hold is not 6+ minutes. Not getting my business.,UNK
1478,Sushi was average & choices extremely limited. Drinks watered down. Atmosphere and decor are tops,UNK
1479,"$2.00 for a side of sour cream, on a cold burrito. Kept pushing alcohol even though we said we didn't drink. Too bad this place has beautiful interior decorations.",UNK
1480,"If you haven't had a chance to get by this location, GO! They do an amazing table service now, and you order right as you enter! No more waiting for people in front of you to slowly progress through the long line!!!",UNK
1481,"The food was pretty good. The service was iffy. I waited thirty minutes for a dessert and their twelve dollar mimosas were a rip, barely had any booze. Probably wouldn't return, only went because we were staying at Palms Place.",UNK
1482,Great if you need coffee on the north end of the strip!,UNK
1483,"This little corner place is terrific--manages to be hip and homey at the same time. The soups, salads, smoothies are fresh and tasty, and the owners and staff are warm and friendly. Highly recommended.",UNK
1484,"This place is a must when in Vegas. I stop by at least once when I come to town and everybody I've brought has loved it. Good portions, great drinks, tons of flavor and reasonable prices make Guy's Vegas Kitchen + Bar the place to go on the strip!",UNK
1485,Just a place to look at games\n\nI usually find them cheaper after waiting or purchasing them Pre-Owned,UNK
1486,Very friendly staff. The freshest burrito I have ever had. The cook even made me special hot sauce!,UNK
1487,Wow wow wow! All the food we had here was too notch!! Bootleg burger was fantastic! Can't wait to come back !!,UNK
1488,"Had the raspberry muffin and it was delicious and fresh.  Well, it better be for $3.50.  The chocolate croissant was crispy but I've had much better in Montreal and in other cities.",UNK
1489,The food here is LEGIT. The prices are pretty good. Their beer selection is kind of weird but hey try something new.,UNK
1490,"I must say the fried chicken was below expectation, it was dry, bland and over-fried.  The waffles were just ok.  The portion was big, too big in my opinion.  I think they should focus on the quality rather than the quantity.",UNK
1491,This place was pretty good someone took me here a long time ago and I could never remember the name and I just found it. The neighborhood is not so nice But I guess don't let that run you away Have to try new things!!,UNK
1492,"3 stars cause they get my drink right every time, minus 2 stars cause the Wi-Fi is horribly slow, Burger King across the street is 69% faster... did some calculations to figure that out...",UNK
1493,This is the oldest AJs around. Decent selection but doesn't stock a lot of the quality items I go to AJs for. Also the appearance of this store doesn't seem to earn it the right to charge AJs prices. Not impressed with this location.,UNK
1494,Scale of 1-10 (single visit):\n7 Food\n7 Service\n7 Atmosphere\n5 Value\n\nJust didn't feel it.,UNK
1495,So the food is great. Been going for a while and maybe for the last time. They round the bill up to nearest nickel. WTF so your taking more money for what use? That is stealing to me. Over time it adds up,UNK
1496,Awesome in every respect. Great staff. Great food. Super spicy (on request). \n\nWill be back again and again.,UNK
1497,My Sister was ROOFIED here! The owner REFUSED to  check the surveillance cameras!  Go at your own risk! NEVER leave your drinks unattended.,UNK
1498,"This place is wonderful! Excellent customer service and the waxing service is amazing. If you like Brazilian, this is the best pain-less experience ever.\nI have been going here for months.",UNK
1499,"Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere!  3 hours for a \""partial highlight\"" I went running out of the salon with wet hair! Worst experience in a salon ever...",UNK
1500,nothing impressive besides the name.,UNK
1501,"Decent pizza place for Vegas, I enjoyed...",UNK
1502,I only wish they sold 8-10lb bags of their crushed ice. Convenient spot for lottery tickets.,UNK
1503,Rio has ruined a great breakfast. Food is not the same as the original. Food was cold service is poor. Go to the free standing spot not in a casino.,UNK
1504,I've been to many nail shops in this town and I always find myself comparing their work to Cute Nails. Wonderful shop!,UNK
1505,Probably the worst run business I have ever dealt with in my entire life.,UNK
1506,"I have had to visit this place a few times with a group. The food is generally very dry and doesn't seem very fresh. Unfortunately, the reopening has not improved the food one bit.",UNK
1507,Came here with a group and I was only one who didn't get the burger (got the reuben). The friends who had the burgers got them at varying levels of done-ness and all of them had stomach issues the entire day. The fries were very good though,UNK
1508,"BAD BAD BAD!!!! Not fresh, bad service, bad management and expensive. Not worth the money at all!\nDon't go there!",UNK
1509,"Great prices, especially during happy hour. But customer service needs A LOT of work! Either my order is skipped, i have to beg for a water refill because they never check on you, I get the wrong item, or I ask them for something and they just completely forget.",UNK
1510,Service was awesome!! Lobster Bisque wasn't :( I will deff try something new next time!,UNK
1511,Nice atmosphere but not so nice hot chocolate. I can be a food/drink purist sometimes and I didn't like them using chocolate sauce for my drink. Eww.,UNK
1512,"Tous les plats sont parfaits, vin d\u00e9licat et un service tr\u00e8s agr\u00e9able. De grands professionnels, un bel endroit en toute occasion.",UNK
1513,I enjoyed myself way more than I expected touring this exhibit.  My wife and I enjoyed taking humorous photos of each other.,UNK
1514,Not very good,UNK
1515,"Awesome, Awesome, Awesome! Great wines and always good company. The owners are usually the ones pouring their wines and most of their large family is involved in the business. I love to support local businesses and this is more than just a mom and pop shop!",UNK
1516,"I will drive completely out of my way to use this car wash. Super service, free vacuums - rescued me from a prior bad car washing experience. Thanks, guys!",UNK
1517,"Not only did we get the wrong soup, after 1 1/2 hours our food was served cold, over done and was missing our side dishes. We wound up leaving an went to another restaurant. Oh by the way, did I mention it was our 20th anniversary? So disappointing.",UNK
1518,Store is fine but there's always only 1 or 2 registers open and VERY slow.  I would recommend going to the Home Depot on 51st ave and Baseline as they're a lot better staffed.,UNK
1519,"Boo, good idea, bad execution. Ladies were fun atmosphere was very Vegas and easy going, but the food is blah at best and. \n\nBeer is cheap and you get a lot of blah food though!",UNK
1520,"Worth the wait. \n\nVery long wait time to take our order, despite having plenty of staff. Burger was very good.",UNK
1521,Two stars at best.  Service was slow and poor. Food was marginal at best. Came here in hopes of being quick and decent and was disappointed on both accounts. Pass on this place no matter how hungry or tired you might be.,UNK
1522,"Good selection, but I'm hoping they will get shoes in soon.  Customer service is great.",UNK
1523,I've been back a couple times since my last review and it is safe to say the pizza is still amazing!  I have ventured out to salads and their famous dulce dessert (I highly recommend it!) and have never been disappointed.,UNK
1524,"I had fun with some friends on a Sunday night. Stevie the bartender made us some awesome drinks! Shark the karaoke guy was nice enough to listen to our awful singing. Dana the owner is amazing, and I will be coming back!",UNK
1525,worst service ever.\nnot worth the money.,UNK
1526,Good service and friendly staff. My girlfriend took my laptop here when it crashed. I got it back running faster then ever and with newer software. They even gave me a better battery that runs longer. I will be coming back here for sure,UNK
1527,"orders are usually right, food is good, better than the other surprise options like mcdonalds and jack in the box.",UNK
1528,"We ate here yesterday and it was the BEST Italian food we have ever had! It was so good, we went back today and recommended it to a couple on the way back to the Venetian.",UNK
1529,We come often because of the gluten free options.  We have eaten there several times and never gotten sick.  It is for sure the family favorite and I find the staff here a bit better than some of the other locations.,UNK
1530,"Friendly staff, prompt service. Nice facility and bathroom was clean. Sitting area with massage chairs, LCD TV, magazines, and music in the background. Open covered patio with plenty of sitting area. Car was nicely was and dried.",UNK
1531,What a bargain. All you can eat buffet for 24 hours....good luck if you can handle 3 meals within 24 hours.,UNK
1532,"Idk, it's not that great quality pastries..... And the prices make me less excited. They get a gold star for the atmosphere though.",UNK
1533,"Lynn did a fantastic job. He was very responsive and even looked into some specific things I needed done, at no additional cost. Prices are very competitive. Locally owned. It is reassuring to have found an honest, reliable AC person.",UNK
1534,"So amazing how many people on here gave this place 4-5 stars...... Wow, so easily fooled or have never had real Vietnamese chow before.",UNK
1535,"Great collection, but very hard to find. Free is not free unless you bring a printed copy of coupon. They are not nice about it.",UNK
1536,Some of the best food in the area. Great selection of wines and very personable staff. Comfy atmosphere and great ambiance.,UNK
1537,"Straight up horrible: my burrito was terrible. Tortilla was hard, carne asada was like rubber. There are no good Mexican spots I'm AJ so stop looking. Only going to Baja Joes from now on",UNK
1538,Heard good things about this place so we stopped by while shopping. Huge mistake. My friend got food poisoning from the turkey sandwich. I had a chicken sandwich that was basically bread and sauce. Not good at all. Even the Mac n cheese was bad. \nNever again.,UNK
1539,Just had dinner there last night and the food was very good. Try the enchiladas and pizza!\nAnd the chai no cheese cheese cake was great!,UNK
1540,Came here for some sangria and 99 cent (!!!) tacos! Great meal on the cheap in Vegas. The service was friendly and fast as well.,UNK
1541,"The place is cool but way over priced 20% over average retail, you are way better off just going to REI or Bass Pro Shop. You can get the same or way better gear for a fraction of the cost.",UNK
1542,"I get my dresses and coats cleaned here and they always do a good job.  If I forget to print out coupons before I go, the really cool girl at the counter will spot me one.  Once, I needed a dress cleaned for a special occasion at the last minute and they totally accommodated me.",UNK
1543,These are best tacos in this area. Tacos el gordon are not that great.,UNK
1544,"Fabulous. Decor, service, presentation, menu, flavors, drinks-everything gets 4 stars. This restaurant is a prime example of a place that really knows what it is doing from the ground up. Call me impressed.",UNK
1545,Good food.  Unpleasant hostess.  I like that.they have lite calorie options.,UNK
1546,"place isn\""t new but a gem . wait service is on top of it and food is awesome. we will be back.",UNK
1547,"They don't put the price on their drinks and the margarita was 15 dollars. Service was slow, food was okay.",UNK
1548,Definitely a place to see and be seen in the Cosmopolitan. Great drink menu for those of the hard liquor bent. Not so good for the beer drinkers.,UNK
1549,I like pho in here. Very light and fresh,UNK
1550,"They're not renting Kayaks from their Tempe location \""right now\"" they say.",UNK
1551,Happening..crazy busy..long wait..super busy..super crowded. .worth it....\n\nCover can be steep 55 green ones..,UNK
1552,"Fig on a pizza? Yes please!  Add some prosciutto? Yes, please some more!\n\nGood wine, great company and thin crust that doesn't overpower the flavors on a piece of pizza pie...I'll be back!",UNK
1553,These guys at fresh wasabi microwaved my hamaichi Kama - scary!!!! Go to Sushi Brokers in Scottsdale for consistent and fresh sushi. Sorry this place does not cut it for me. Sushi rice was vinegary!,UNK
1554,Lovely place in the middle of nowhere.  Bottom floor is the bar and the second floor is a game area.  Appetizers were good and cold beer.,UNK
1555,"Good filet, delicious sides, a bit cramped, a bit pricey, but you get what you pay for.",UNK
1556,Love the pancakes and omelet here . Adolfo is awesome waiter!!!,UNK
1557,Best chilaquiles! Great services! Mariachi was amazing! I am for sure coming back to this place every Vegas trip!,UNK
1558,As a parent of a swimmer this is really not a great pool for watching a meet. The stands are small and the tiny results scoreboard is blocked by the crowd if not directly behind you. Parking is atrocious. The positive is the pool is pretty new and in good condition .,UNK
1559,"For lunch it had the best view, service, and price I've seen in Vegas thus far. i had some kind of steak sandwich and it was to die for. Can't remember the name and it's killing me.",UNK
1560,"What can I really say about this Costco that hasn't already been said before. I love shopping here. With the amount of food that my boys eat, I have to come here quite often. It helps me save money and I always fill up my tank here.",UNK
1561,Love the updated menu. I've had 3 of the sandwiches over the past 3 weeks. Every one of them was good. Most recently there with colleagues from out of town. Great service and food. All my friends thought the whole package was great.,UNK
1562,Jessica was fabulous and quick!!!  All of it only took an hour and probably because we were talking...ZEasy to find location and great suite.  Thanks Jessica.,UNK
1563,"Great Mexican food!  The meat is delicious, and very tender.  You receive chips at the beginning of your meal with yummy salsas to try.  The ambiance of the restaurant is not that great, but the food makes up for the lack of flare!",UNK
1564,"One of my preferred Ross stores. It's always neat, well-organized, and they have tons of high end names at this location.",UNK
1565,"Great atmosphere. We're doing out staff party there every year.\nThe guys are great, food is good and we always get discounts on drinks.",UNK
1566,Mediocre food and service.  Moderate sized private room available for meetings and parties.  Bartenders make a pretty good drink.  Nachos are huge.,UNK
1567,Miss this place! I have lived in many different cities over the years and this is the only city that never sleeps and of course has a 24 hour Starbucks! I enjoy the customer service and the team that works here and no matter when I come I get a great cup of Coffee!,UNK
1568,"Lux is popular for sure - but it's not my cup of coffee.  Tough for parking, tight spaces on the interior as well and average products.",UNK
1569,Great place! I went in for a tire pressure check. I was in and out in less than 10 minutes and was given a bottle of water. FREE! Great service nice employees I come here for all tire stuff. :)  thanks Discount Tire Guys.,UNK
1570,The food was satisfactory but the prices were amazing! Tried the beef ramen and I would definitely come again for it if I was on a budget. Friendly staff,UNK
1571,"Love going there in the Mornings, Best Staff and Fast Service!",UNK
1572,Poor quality products but many are cute/incredibly inexpensive so I guess it's fine if you just want it to last a season.,UNK
1573,Great place! Fantastic healthy shakes and good atmosphere. Free workouts too!  Definitely worth checking this place out.,UNK
1574,"Great place, reasonably priced the food was really good everything was fresh and the restaurant was spotless.",UNK
1575,Great for date night or lunch with the kids. The name says it all...anything with pesto is excellent.  Prices are reasonable especially for the quality.  We've been there 3 times now and will definitely go back.,UNK
1576,"I go to this bar because it's close to where I work. I like this bar because they have a really good selection of beer, decent patio to hang out on and I love this bar for the wings! Thank you Mel.",UNK
1577,Too expensive for a haircut.  Shoe shine?  I am wearing flip flops.  Everyone wanted tips.,UNK
1578,maybe its unfair because in compairing this place to boiling crab in so cal.. but this place wasn't good at all..,UNK
1579,Have tried it several times for pizza and the pasta and the food is good but the portions were lunch portions at dinner prices,UNK
1580,"This is the best Denny's / from the server - (Latoya's great) to the food, to the appearance of the restaurant. I would recommend this place to anyone coming by here. We had the French toast breakfast. All cooked & served perfectly.",UNK
1581,I started a postbox here for my business and the people who own and work at this PostNet are so friendly and helpful.\n\nDefinitely go if you're looking for incredible service.,UNK
1582,Was at this campus for a LinkedIn event. It was adequate. Building is dated and has that feel. Computer lab was fine but somewhat confining.  The event itself was great though!,UNK
1583,Horrible both my sons & husband had gotten food poisoning none of us will ever go back!,UNK
1584,"Phenomenal customer service! Came in with a warranty issue, they got me in immediately and replaced everything for free! Great feeling knowing my money is appreciated here and that I am truly covered under warranty :)",UNK
1585,Went to the peoria location and it's someone's house! Some one thinks they are funny! Bite me!,UNK
1586,Not really a fan of fast food but I like their fries and milkshakes. Also love that they are open late. I come here when Five Guys is closed. Lines are usually long but they move fast. Service is nice. I've never had them mess up on my order.,UNK
1587,"Food is ok, not great.  I've had way better.",UNK
1588,"A must on every Vegas trip. We ordered the shrimp, bacon dates, beef salad, escargot & more shrimp & sangrias. Dinner w/ drinks around $70 not bad for the taste and selection.",UNK
1589,"This is my favorite espresso cafe in the Fitchburg area.  High quality coffee, very nice chill atmosphere, and best of all, close to work.  Plus, they are locally owned and the owners are there regularly working, as well as supporting local artists.  Happy to support shops like this.",UNK
1590,"I go here to get my dog food and dog utilities. Staff is nice, if you run into them they will help. The store is always clean!",UNK
1591,"This hotel is a great hidden gem. It is newer, clean with all the amenities. Great access to the I-15 to get you to the strip in minutes. Self parking is easy if that is your choice.  Excellent fitness center as well.",UNK
1592,Hard to find a good spot for healthy food in this part of Vegas. Everything was very fresh. Great smoothie / juice bar. Excellent staff! Went 3x in a 2 day span after finding it.,UNK
1593,"Best food, best service, best atmosphere - this place has it all.  My family and I go often and are never disappointed.\nThe only Mexican food place we go to  now to get our spice fix!",UNK
1594,I did not like the food at all. Everything made me hack.,UNK
1595,"I had an epidural by Dr. Pappoe in 2012,and he paralyzed me,I lost my business,my home,and everything that mattered to me! He knew he had done this to me,and didn't seem to care at all!",UNK
1596,"I found a bug in my food and was given a \""discount\"" of $1.10, when the dish cost $6.99. I'd probably be less upset with the experience if the server was able to communicate with me, or if there really was service even!",UNK
1597,"A type of restaurant for very special occasions and/or company expensed dinners. A 5-star experience from the service, attention & of course, the bone-in rib eye.",UNK
1598,alot of good times will be had here. the staff is chill. the drinks are good. sit down by the fireplace and argue about pop culture with your friends.,UNK
1599,"Nice hole-in-the wall style sports bar, although bigger than most hole-in-the wall type places. Good beer selection. I did not eat there.",UNK
1600,"Worst, driest bone in ribeye I have ever had. Seriously. \n\nThe mussels were decent though.",UNK
1601,place is too good,UNK
1602,"Great grilled chicken and grilled veggies! Super clean and friendly. Great dips! Love it and it was healthy for me, my brother had the Mac and cheese too so not as healthy for him but he said it was great! :)",UNK
1603,One of my favorite and must visit cafe when I come here.  Their coffee are always made perfectly.   I absolutely love this little cafe.  It can get very crowded.   But also worth coming here for a take away.,UNK
1604,I did some real quick Christmas shopping here and it seemed like it was reasonably priced and they had a great layout and some pretty good sales. It's a new store and is probably similar to Michaels but with a cleaner layout.,UNK
1605,"Having been to farmer's markets all across the west coast, I expected more from this one.\n\nI wished they had more food vendors there.  It would really draw a pretty massive following if there were at least 4-5 food vendors that sold good food.",UNK
1606,"Finally found the nail salon I've been looking for, for so many years. Jackie is awesome and extremely meticulous. I've never had such a thorough gel mani and relaxing pedi. \n\nGirls this is the place to go!!",UNK
1607,"Cant say that I eat anything on the menu except for the sweet potato fries, which are pretty dang amazing!!!!  The service was a little awkward......the server didn't seem to be comfortable at the table talking to us.  Maybe his first day?",UNK
1608,"Excellent service on Friday, October 24. I had to send packages back to Chicago. The clerk,  Anthony, was extremely helpful, professional and did a great job of taping up three individual packages. I will definitely use this store again if needed.",UNK
1609,"Brown bag chicken sammich, mac n cheese, fried okra, and the bourbon drink.  Nuff said.",UNK
1610,Service sucks!!!!,UNK
1611,I really like the feel of this bar. I'm getting older and don't want the clubby scene of OldTown anymore. The wine selection was wonderful and I find its a nice place to hang out with your significant other or friends. Loved it.,UNK
1612,"Best sandwich is the sausage and peppers with Marinara and some of their hot peppers. Get the 20 inch and heat up the other half the following day. It's even better left over. Not all locations are perfect, but this one is fantastic.",UNK
1613,Good flavor to the meat but the fries and sandwiches themselves are missing the wow factor that you get from Five Guys. Just a slight step up from In N Out for more money. I give it an overwhelming meh rating.,UNK
1614,Tuesdays are the best obvs thanks to their special. Not really a dinner place but great place to hang out and have a variety of wine selections.,UNK
1615,I'm no Shakespeare so I'll keep it short.\nGreat food and beautiful patrons. It's obvious why this place is so popular.,UNK
1616,"Mention \""YEL.001\"" to receive the $6.00 per day and one time service fee of $2.50",UNK
1617,the music they play is pretty good...but this place is tiny!,UNK
1618,"Now that we have eaten here several more times, I realized the 4 stars does not do this place justice.  Really excellent food.",UNK
1619,Sauce would be my favorite place for pizza! Usually come here after my workout to grow! Great amazing food! Also great workers!,UNK
1620,"Dirty slick holds. Hate the fact I can't move mats. Some problems were fun, some were awful. The staff is very unfriendly. Unless you're part if the clique no one will talk to you.",UNK
1621,Great place for casual Mexican fare.  Very flavorful and colorful.  The Chile Relleno was very different and totally enjoyable.  Friendly atmosphere and quick service.\nI have been back a few times to try other items on the menu and I have never been disappointed.,UNK
1622,"Slowest\ncoffeehouse\nservice\never\n\nDo *not* go here if you are in any sort of a hurry, day or night.\n\nFood is okay.",UNK
1623,Great place to pick up really cheap veg*items. Hours of operation kind of suck though.,UNK
1624,Bartender & waitress nice food is ok ;) !! Good prices not best area but it's ok first time here !! My fiance seems to like it he loves his beer !,UNK
1625,"Stay off the strip and stay here!  Unlike the strip, you'll never have to get in your car or take a taxi.  With Fremont Street at the corner, an interesting evening is only a few steps away.",UNK
1626,Holy sweet mother of mercy!  Can't believe how good the food is. Don't skip the soup. So many options are GF. Short stack of pancakes were oh so good and loaded with berries!  Off the strip and a bit hard to find but well worth the journey.,UNK
1627,Was super excited to enjoy shaved snow in my neighborhood but that excitement quickly diminished after one taste.  Overly priced and not worth the cost.  I'll continue to drive to China Town for some yummy shaved snow.,UNK
1628,"They have a waitress with the worst attitude I've ever seen in any restaurant. The manager even argues with costumers for giving less tip to that waitress. The only star is for their food, average Chinese around Pittsburgh.",UNK
1629,I love their popusas! They are just a bit on the expensive side $2.30 each. Their Chicken Salad is also very good.,UNK
1630,"Very impressed,enjoyed my food here the Chicken burrito was really good and the prices are reasonable.Will be back here again in the future for sure!This was my first time eating at Qdoba and I thoroughly enjoyed it very tasty food in a nice open surrounding! Thanks",UNK
1631,Got take out and had them deliver a few times.  If your in the mood for Chinese takeout this place isn't bad.  Delivery added one star to my rating so keep that in mind when ordering.,UNK
1632,"If you wanted your chocolate fix, this is the place. A wide variety of chocolate drinks and foods. Love their shakes! Can get packed, as it is a like on the small side.",UNK
1633,"This place has seriously good pizza, awesome atmosphere and great customer service. Thoroughly impressed for a gourmet fast pizza experience. Also, balsamic. Fig. Glaze...sooooooo good! :)",UNK
1634,"I tried and will, in the future, pass on the spring rolls, \""house\"" fried rice, and tofu Pad Thai. Decent decor, prices and 24 hours so I'm going to go back and find something good here.",UNK
1635,"The people were nice, the prices were reasonable.  Would go again.",UNK
1636,"Yuck.  Go to Maestro's instead, it's the real deal.",UNK
1637,"I collect video games and check Bookman's every couple of months. Their selection varies but its a cool place to get old school games and systems. Their prices are moderate. Fair return policy too. Worth going to if you like used, old stuff.",UNK
1638,"Typical McDonald's, consistent food and conveniences. Today however I waited in the drive-through for over 15 minutes.  I cannot remember being stuck in a drive through that long and McDonald's before!!",UNK
1639,Unfortunately My Cousin Vinny has closed- the sign on the front states it is going to be a church (not kidding). Remodeling going on.,UNK
1640,"Usually there ok this one keeps messing up orders. Not doing anything complicated, you know mustard not mayo sort of thing. Twice I had to run back out to switch out a sandwich. I just don't think they care....",UNK
1641,The best video store ever! They have nearly everything and the employees are extremely knowledgeable and personable!,UNK
1642,"I enjoyed it, I loved telling people I ate at LoLo's.  But it is Chicken, waffles, corn bread.  Not my favorites but a fun place to go!",UNK
1643,Food was okay. Nothing spectacular to write home about. The Mac n cheese was not done and the ribs taste like they were boiled before being baked in an oven.,UNK
1644,"Good beer, cool bartender, we like to stop here every time we visit.  Although drinking in a shopping mall is DANGEROUS for your credit card!  you have been fore warned.",UNK

1647,This is simply the best papa johns around.  The pizza is always consistent and they exceed where others fail by making sure your order is correct. I have found this store to be much friendlier and cleaner than the others.,UNK
1648,"Service as great, food just average.  If you have the energy to walk go to the studio walk, you'll find something better.",UNK
1649,"For the price of the sandwich, where's the beef? I'm being freakin serious here!  All bread, toppings and minimum amount of protein. I made a better sandwich when I was 12 . Unacceptable!",UNK
1650,"We had lunch here. Although expensive, it wasn't good. Service was ok, not expected. The service poured water and the pitcher spilled water over the salmon plate yikes... not recommended",UNK
1651,"My family and I love Amazing Wok. It is fast, taste great, and reasonably priced.",UNK
1652,Very entertaining and lots of fun. There is more to this show than sensuality/sex appeal - the acrobats were oozing with talent and performed to perfection. \n\nDon't sit in the upper balcony if you want a good view.,UNK
1653,"Always wanted to stop here! Great place if your young, and looking get yourself into a little trouble if ya know what I mean! The Maloofs really know how to throw a party that goes to all hours of the morning.",UNK

1658,Fantastic staff and management! Flatbreads are exceptional as well and there are almost always specials going on that the staff is well-informed on. A must visit for sure!,UNK
1659,"Pretty good and good price.  I'm not a buffet person, so I didn't eat much but the group I was with made up for it.",UNK
1660,"I have tried almost all dishes there, and those taste great! Really recommend if you like spicy food, but you can choose no spicy flavor though.",UNK
1661,The guy in the store has a very poor customer service.. he looks very mean. He will price your stuff quickly without asking or interogating your medical insurance..Very poor customer service.....,UNK
1662,"Great atmosphere, Great food. The waiter Alex is the best at what he does. Truly had a great time!!!",UNK
1663,Too bad this place is now closed :( They had really good chai and frozen coffee drinks.... They will be missed,UNK
1664,"Good ice cream sandwiches at a reasonable price. $3.75 for an Ice Cream Sandwich. It uses Thrifty ice cream which I am not thrilled about, and uses ridiculously cheapo bowls and spoons, but it's still a fun place to take the wife and kids.",UNK
1665,No more fried pickles. :(,UNK
1666,"Had an awesome time New Years Eve here. Gabriel Iglesias put on an amazing show. Flufyguy did not disappoint, all new material. Our server Jaime was beyond awesome and handled the crazy situation beautifully. Will go back again.",UNK
1667,"Great activity for kids. It's clean, spacious and safe.",UNK
1668,"lots of eating place within walking distance. When we got tired, we just went back to the hotel room to rest. The rooms were spacious and clean, beds were comfortable and it was quiet. The hotel was conveniently located to access the freeway to all the CA attractions we drove to.",UNK
1669,The food here is way below par.about the only edible things are the hot and sour soup and fried rice. Go another half mile south to Padma express,UNK
1670,Housekeeping department needs attention. I did not get my coffee today!,UNK
1671,"All the restaurants close very early which is odd. I flew during Thanksgiving weekend and not one place was open at 10pm while the whole airport was bustling. Made no sense. Also, there were barely any outlets and the charging stations are always full and not worth the wait line.",UNK
1672,Closed permanently don't bother.,UNK
1673,"I didnt like it @ first but i guess i was ina bad mood. tried the Montagu sandwich, really yummy and was fun cause i had company.",UNK
1674,It was better when they first opened. Now service is not as pleasant and food quality has slipped,UNK
1675,"I like this store, and the staff is very friendly. The problem with this store is the poor pricing. If there is shelf pricing, it is often wrong or placed in front of the wrong item.\n\nThis is a big concern and should be a better tended business practice.",UNK
1676,Went to a wedding. The food was ok and the drinks were way over priced 5 for a soda and 6 for a bottle of water! Really! 16 for a mixed drink.,UNK
1677,Great great happy hour! Fun atmosphere! Great decor and best garlic edamame in the valley!,UNK
1678,Terrible food. I ordered a Buffalo Chicken wrap and they gave me lettuce and chicken and squirted some Buffalo sauce on it. Nothing that cannot be done at home in less than 5 mins. It's worse than subway and more expensive.,UNK
1679,Bill Cleveland was great at solving my issues and following up to make sure I was satisfied with the service.,UNK
1680,"The pizza is sub-par at best. Garlic bread was okay, but they use garlic powder instead of garlic. And, for a Saturday at 7 pm, it was dead!",UNK
1681,I hope you guys can use fresh crawfish for the customers!,UNK
1682,The only place in Laurenceville that has managed to not be over run by hipsters. \nThe bartenders are attentive & knowledgable. They actually make the drinks with more than a half a splash of alcohol,UNK
1683,"Do not use the mobile grooming services! The groomer was a no call/ no show. After three hours of waiting, I called the company and left a message. They did not have the decency to even call me back. I will be taking my business elsewhere.",UNK

1685,Best biscuits and gravy in town!,UNK
1686,"Pretty nice hotel. The Sahara hotel was pretty small so they didn't have a lot to work with. I am dissapointed though in the Celling. They just painted it black, they coulda been more creative with it",UNK
1687,Worst customer service I pick up my food in drive thru the girl at the window had attitude first she gave me the wrong food order & I told her thank you 2 times n she just ignore me what a customer service never going back again,UNK
1688,Very disappointed that they would NOT sell their lobster and shrimp Mac and cheese separately at ANY price. Comes only with two selections! Food was good service good.,UNK
1689,Sad to give any French restaurant a 2 star review.  Breaks my heart.  Boullibase was tasteless and had cold spots.,UNK
1690,Kristi is a real joy... I love getting 0% service and be completely ignored when trying to order a drink. Unless I am one of her ass-kissing regulars. And it's happened countless times.,UNK
1691,Food is decent but not great service is good and its in a nice spot to eat if you sit by the window but i wont go here if im looking for a premium steak.,UNK
1692,"Yummy Thrifty ice cream, snowie treats, and world famous smoothies....",UNK
1693,Worst experience I have ever had and worst decision I ever made was living here.  God help anyone that pays that much money to literally be tortured.,UNK
1694,"The Stromboli was good. Service was very pleasant. The place was dark and old, having to walk through the smoke filled bar to get to the glass partitioned dining room was disappointing....hold your breathe!  Would I go back, probably not. Once and done.",UNK
1695,The La Jolla is my favorite! The staff here is really great. Seriously one of my favorite spots for brunch!!!,UNK
1696,Absolutely loved this place. Got the pulled chicken and it wasn't what I was expecting. The chicken was moist and pretty chunky. Hands down the best pulled chicken sandwich I have ever had. Went here based on other Yelp reviews and I am so glad I did.,UNK
1697,Came here to grab a quick bagel but had to wait their computers were down. The manager could've announced it to those who were in line.,UNK
1698,Really disgusting sushi other than the nice service I would never ever come here poor quality sushi and way overpriced.,UNK
1699,A bit small inside. Bathrooms are clean and food is always great. The boy at the register is nice. There are Roberto's all over town but I prefer this one because of the cleanliness and food consistency.,UNK
1700,"We choose a chain for consistency but when the chicken is full of the part no one wants to eat it ruins the whole experience. Please cut the fat, literally!",UNK
1701,Fire the chef that worked 12/16/2014 evening shift after 10:30 pm. Food and coffee cold. We were the only people in the restaurant and still had bad food. Nasty green beans that were petrified and of course cold. Ebony and Misty saved the evening. Never again.,UNK
1702,"Had to be the worst dining experience I have had. They could make a drink correctly, the food was either over or under cooked. The service was worst than both combined. Definitely will never go there again. Don't waste your money.",UNK
1703,"All you can eat Mongolian food.  Hot, good, and affordable!",UNK
1704,"If I were 20 years younger and single, i probably would have had a better time. But I loved the music and eye candy! Staff wasn't all that. International crowd, apparently the dollar is weak and they all come to Vegas.",UNK
1705,This one's easy--best brisket sandwich outside of New York.,UNK
1706,"Terrible customer service! I love the merchandise, but each and every time I have gone in there...the service is terrible...and I walk out. I won't spend money in a place that does not know how to treat people.",UNK
1707,One of the nicest thrift stores I've ever been to. Well organized with quality items. The staff seem friendly as well.,UNK
1708,They have taken care of me with their amazing desserts!!!! I was recommended to them by a co worker & was greatly appreciative for the referral & the desserts I received.,UNK
1709,"Everything I have eaten here is delicious...a little pricey for lunch, but worth it. Its a good idea to split a pasta meal and a salad with a friend; Then you get the best of both worlds.",UNK
1710,"Very good pizza, very slow to make. Plan extra time out order ahead. We waited over an hour for a pizza (and the place wasn't busy).",UNK
1711,eww....delicious burrito......until i pulled a 12 inch long black hair from it! gross. and couldnt return it because we were already at another gate. normally super tasty burrito but not today.,UNK
1712,The menu looks really good but the food doesn't deliver the only thing I liked about this place was the garlic fries but fries are really hard to mess up.,UNK
1713,Very friendly!  Quick food that is similar to Chipotle but with more traditional dining experience.  Serving portions were big and you get a good value for the money.  Good go to place if you want something quick and filling.,UNK
1714,"We go here a lot for family dinners or lunches but the last few times have been very disappointing.  The menu is always changing, food quality is going down & service is extremely slow.\nI think it's time to find somewhere else to eat.",UNK
1715,I love Harris Teeter but this store is one I really don't care for. Service is awful. Manager is terrible. Store is older and needs to be remodeled.,UNK

1717,Abosultely love the pepperoni pizza and Ceasar Salad here.,UNK
1718,"A Vegas must!  TV's everywhere, stadium seating and great food!  We LOVE our \""Texas connection\"" bartender Daina. She is such a sweetheart and will make sure you have a great experience.  Without question the best sports book on the strip.",UNK
1719,"Bruschetta was excellent! Very good wine selection. Nice atmosphere, and not so loud that you cannot hear your company. Waitstaff is attentive and well-versed in their product. Good music, my boyfriend and I had fun playing name the artisit. No complaints!",UNK
1720,It's been a month since my haircut and it still looks awesome! Jenni did a great job!,UNK
1721,"David is amazing. He does my hair to perfection and I always get compliments. Davis also does my husband's hair - which is not an easy task! He does a great job, knows what he's doing and I trust him completely. Great job, David!",UNK
1722,The regular food at this restaurant is fantastic but their sushi is inedible. I've tried different rolls at different times. It's just not good. Calamari is excellent though and the service is always good.,UNK
1723,"We were here for a post rehearsal dinner party, great beer, delish mixed drinks, great for groups.",UNK
1724,One of the best meatballs I've ever had. I had the veal parmigiana for my main course and it was great. Overall a great experience and location.,UNK

1727,I had the experience of my employer ordering from Little Saigon for a luncheon we had scheduled.Never having had Vietnamese food I was weary but that changed. The spring rolls and soup were SO GOOD and so filling!! Look forward to trying more goodies from here in the near future.,UNK
1728,"Yum! Clean, fresh vibe to the place. Wonderful veggie options and adult beverages?! A rarity for veg friendly restaurants in the valley. Only complaint is the seating. I hate being in the middle of the room and most of the seating leaves you feeling exposed.",UNK
1729,always smiling and happy.\nthey have all the goodies you need when you want to spoil your hairy friend.,UNK
1730,"No longer $1 bloody mary's on weekend.  sad face.\n\nBut for $3 you can get a bloody mary or a mimosa and you don't have to order breakfast.  And boy, are those tasty.",UNK
1731,The music was good.  The beer was warm.  Wheat beer served warm can contain bacteria.  The person I was with and myself were both sick for three days.,UNK
1732,In my opinion the pharmacy  was understaffed and unable to serve customers in a timely manner.,UNK
1733,Definitely not worth the price. Too many other good choices try the new Fox place across the street. MUCH better than Chestnut. Sorry to say,UNK
1734,"I am duly impressed with your decent coffee, great vegetarian options and  free internet. I deeply love your hang-over cure wrap and constant parade of young people on a mission.",UNK
1735,Another failed attempt to locate a last minute Halloween costume. The didn't have a lot of interesting costumes to choose from so I didn't end up picking anything up. No one helped us or asked if we needed assistance the entire time we were there.,UNK
1736,"I love this Home Depot! Everyone is very friendly! \""Art\"" pointed us in the direction of a $5 solution for what was looking like a $1,000 problem. Very helpful, well-stocked and close to my home.",UNK

1740,Excellent food and excellent service.  The manager Kristen was awesome and so was our server Jeff. I highly recommend this restaurant for dinner.,UNK
1741,Texas de brazil wins hands down . The meat was dry . The pao de queijo was good . Overall it sucked . Sorry but I recommend everybody go to Texas de brazil,UNK
1742,So far have waited an hour for one burger and one baked potato + one drink has been incorrect. Apparently the machine failed to register the order so discount ahoy,UNK
1743,Love love love this place! I like the teas better than the blended boba drink. They have diff kinds of flavors. Sooooo good!,UNK
1744,Not entirely sure why this is 3 stars. I think it's delicious. The meat rodizio is amazing. Staff was kind and funny too. Definitely coming back here when I go to Vegas again.,UNK
1745,Food was up to par but an employee in the dining room ruined our experience.  She was on her cell phone during her break being so ridiculously loud. We could barely hear our own conversations.  Completely unprofessional and probably an indication of managements policies. Won't come again.,UNK
1746,Amazing food and amazing service. Try the skinny margarita. It's amazing. :),UNK
1747,"decent, but serioualy whose going to tell at 7 in the morning after a long night of work =]",UNK

1749,Employee here is abrasive even cursing at me.  Not your friendly local owned business. \nTh,UNK
1750,"This particular location is lacking on good service. We waited a very very long time between bowls of our unlimited soup, salad and bread sticks. It's sad bc Olive Garden is such a staple but this location left us annoyed and hungry!",UNK
1751,My family with three young children have eaten here twice. The staff are super nice to my kids and we love that each kid gets a personalized favorite meal.,UNK
1752,I only go here to watch ufc you will find good ufc fans here. Good beer,UNK
1753,"Picked me up, not a selection of cars at all, and very slow",UNK
1754,The food was good. A must have is the chili verde fries. Great green chili. The downfall is the prices.  The tacos ate really mini tacos for $4 a piece. Prob won't be back due to cost.,UNK
1755,"I had great ribs here, and the service was great. The price is also good, so great overall experience.",UNK
1756,"The food is fantastic as far as shawarmas go, but wait times can sometimes be a bit longer. Great value for the price, as you get a huge serving when you order the plate.",UNK

1758,"Still lovin' this place! Good food, friendly service, very clean, and a great value - for $6 plus change, you can get a HUGE burrito with all the fixin's. I especially love the barbacoa.",UNK
1759,"Great neighborhood chinese restaurant,  and they deliver. Chicken wings & House special chicken are my favorites.",UNK
1760,Over Rated FOOD!!! This place needs a good chef.. I don't plan on dining here again.  Pasta is so cheap but why charge ridiculous amount of money?,UNK
1761,I guess they don't deliver every night. The first time I called they hung up on my. Don't think I'll be trying them after this.,UNK
1762,"Chips are thin. Food is expensive and not much. Asked for no tomato, onions, mushrooms- got tomato and peppers( not listed on menu) won't return. Husband complained of not many fixings. On to another restaurant",UNK

1764,"Bad service. I felt uncomfortable, and there were no restrooms to wash up after eating jerk chicken off the bone.",UNK
1765,"Good food, decent price. Customer service almost non existent. Shake machine seems to Brake a lot. But still eat here 1-2 month for the food.",UNK
1766,"I was in the mood for a salad, maybe my mistake. It was not tasty at all. Processed cheese and meat, lettuce too hard and no flavor. I hope the sandwiches are better but wouldn't bet on it.",UNK
1767,"Funny how everyone here on yelp is fascinated with the bread at Tutto. Don't get me wrong, it was good but the rest of the food was delicious too!",UNK
1768,"Great food, lovely hostess, nice grass in the backyard to set the atmosphere and Manny is hella good at doing voices!",UNK
1769,Twas real,UNK
1770,Dined at Riazzi's for the first time last night and was very impressed. It has a cozy family italian feel with all the classic dishes on the menu. The staff was very attentive and the chicken parm with fettucine was delicious!,UNK
1771,"It would have been faster if I would have grown, harvested, and brewed the tea myself. Last time I come to this location ever!\n\nThey are always out of things and there is ALWAYS a huge line.",UNK
1772,"The pictures looked tasty but when you eat it, it's not all that great at all. Soggy fries and almost cold burger is what I got from this joint. Maybe its just this spot and it could be different from another joint but in the end its all not that great.",UNK
1773,Pulled pork with Cole slaw Sammy is pretty good!,UNK
1774,"Great place to hang out and drink good beer or be a good designated driver like me.  \n\nThe fries are my favorite thing on the menu!  However, the Green Chile Pork is amazing and my Mom refuses to order anything other than Beer Battered Fish & Chips.",UNK
1775,"The service was terrible, the food was adequate and we won't be back. There were only a few tables seated but the servers were absent most of the time. It was a horrible experience.",UNK
1776,"Easy in and out. Really wish there were more vegan, and organic products. For that reason, I find more items of my need at sprouts and whole foods. Wish I could come here more.",UNK
1777,LGO contacted me shortly after writing my last review. They offered a sincere apology and gave me a certificate as compensation for my poor service during my last visit. They also informed me that LGO coupons should always be accepted even if they are expired.,UNK
1778,Great place!!!!!!!!!  Awesome welcoming Labs!  good place to relax and workout and climb!! and close in the henderson area!,UNK
1779,One of my absolute favorite places in Vegas! Such a great piano bar and so completely underrated. The bartenders have some of the best voices I've ever heard (Specifically Dre- Amazing voice!!!) great entertainment and a must visit if you are in Fremont St,UNK

1786,"This place is just \""meh\"".  Sure it's pretty cheap and the people that work there are nice and helpful but in a city with so much more to offer, it just didn't do it for me.",UNK
1787,$6 on Tuesday. Can get really crowded fast. Go early for seats and line up.  I went to the washroom and came back to a huge line..but I didn't cut the line! Younger crowd here.,UNK
1788,Such a delicious spot for brunch! The prices are reasonable and the wait didn't take too long. I can't wait to go back and try other specialties! \n\n*They only seat you if your whole party is present,UNK
1789,I don't understand the negativity on some reviews of this place. It was super quick efficient and overall thorough. I recommend this place to anyone who is questionable.,UNK
1790,I am not sure what the big deal is. The food is good but nothing was spectacular. If you have to wait more than 15 minutes I would go somewhere else.,UNK
1791,"do not use for scorpion issues, waste of money.",UNK

1794,"I was so lucky to stumble across this little gem! The pizza is really really good, one of the best on the west coast.",UNK

1797,"Very average Mexican food. Felt like food just lacked seasoning. Service staff was great, hence 3 stars.",UNK
1798,"Food is ok - nothing that knocks your socks off.   It is a place to be seen in the Scottsdale area.  If you want to enjoy dinner, there are many better places to dine in Scottsdale than there.",UNK
1799,Our favorite fry bread in phoenix. We actually drove straight from the airport to here for a fry bread today!,UNK
1800,The pharmacist at this Walgreen's location is a HUGE jerk. Not helpful at all. Won't be visiting here again!!!,UNK

1802,"The place is nice, but you do expect more especially when it has Mario Batali's name involved. The portions are also small for the price you pay. The dishes are good but you want more.",UNK

1806,Best. Ramen. In. Town. So authentic! Amazing atmosphere! Love it!,UNK

1808,BEST pizza and fresh toppings.,UNK
1809,Should have known when the place was empty on a Friday afternoon,UNK

1811,Following my YELP comments I was contacted by AAA.  They aggressively analyzed my concerns and told me their courses of action that would be applied to solving the problems.

1814,"I recently visited Scottsdale, and enjoyed mass here. It is a very welcoming community. Check it out if you're in the area.",UNK
1815,Great food but terrible service on a Saturday evening. Drinks were not replenished once and server made promises then forgot to follow through. Would not recommend eating here on the weekend if you expect quality service. Great during the week when it's slower.,UNK
1816,"Good drinks, the place is always too busy. The decor is excellent and always fun. This place defined an era for Vegas and still does so.",UNK

1818,"Horrible. How this place has 4 stars is beyond me. A total waste of a dinner. I would never go back and I know good sushi be it masa, sushi of gari or sugarfish. Do yourself a favor and AVOID",UNK
1819,"And I quote...\n\""We are checking women's bags.\""\nSexist, yet understandable still sexist.  This is the theater where the guys have to sneak in the snacks!",UNK
1820,This place has been open for about a few months and I haven't been here until yesterday.  WOW!  This is some good food for not a whole lot of money.,UNK
1821,Worst place ever!  I don't think they like people of color in there because the bouncers will do their best to come up with excuses not to let them in. I saw it happen in front of me and then it happened to me.,UNK
1822,"Just a shout out for Ginger Luke and the outstanding creativity she has for designing hair! She is the only one that my 15 yr old daughter, Madisson, will let touch her hair.  Thanks for listening and loving what you do! :)",UNK

1828,"Food was good, but took a very long time to get our order (45 minutes). Entertainment was lacking, but it was still early in the night. FYI - they can only accept up to 8 credit cards per table, so keep this in mind if you have a large party.",UNK
1829,"Love this place for all their quality foods, treats, and eventa for our pup. They care about our 4 legged pup and us as well. The owners have become our friends and we even made a few fountain hills friends at spikes events. Definitely recommended!",UNK

1832,"Really, its as good as it gets. The food is hot and fresh. The cornbread is awesome and the service is good...I love this place.",UNK

1834,Best coffee and Danish you can buy. I always get the cheese Danish and the cappuccino. I love the little sugar stick that comes with it too. Skip the buffet an enjoy quality breakfast.,UNK
1835,Will not return. Food was salty and smelled like a greasy pan ;( will not be returning.,UNK
1836,"Horrible injera, it was NOT warm or fresh at all. I have been to many Ethiopian restaurants. They explained that I must have gotten injera from places that serve fresh injera out the oven. Wth",UNK
1837,"Cold stone is a classic staple of the wonderful Vegas ice cream eateries. This location houses all my favorites like birthday cake remix and peanut butter cup perfection. Overall, the location is fast, friendly, and clean.",UNK
1838,Elegant Kitchen Cabinets made my kitchen remodel a total nightmare.,UNK
1839,What? No flat screens in the room? \n\nThe Gold Coast has flat screen TV's (and a quicker check-in).,UNK
1840,"Whoever is doing their ordering should be fired.  They don't have any of the organic cage free eggs, and haven't for over a week.  The bread shelves are almost empty.  And tomorrow is back to school.  Seriously thinking about finding a new store.",UNK
1841,I had a chicken sandwich with a house salad . The food was very fresh and flavorful. But we were a little up set by the service. It was so slow that the appetizer came after the food.  Probably won't be back anytime soon.,UNK
1842,"Cannot wait to return this winter....their chocolate Pecan Pie is TO DIE FOR!\n\nLovely people, lovely business. \n\nJust lovely lovely lovely",UNK

1844,"Unlimited GULAB JAMUN!\n\nI don't find it as bland as some other reviewers do, but maybe I'm just a sucker for buffets.",UNK
1845,We went in last night and it was not busy at all! I don't think they're gonna last. Seems like everybody had desperation in their eyes.,UNK
1846,Really good pizza and wings!,UNK
1847,"This location is not a nice as the Saint Denis location, but the food is pretty much the same. Chocolate Chocolate and more Chocolate, if you go you must try the chocolate port, port and chocolate go so well together.",UNK
1848,"Heavy sauce, mediocre shrimp, good and friendly service. Do not think I will go back after two other friends said that they felt as bad as I did after eating there.\n\nThe only reason it has two stars is due to the excellent service.",UNK
1849,"Since I currently don't live near a Chipotle, I had to get some while travelling. My usual burrito bowl was good but there was an extra kick that made me wish I had gotten sour cream. Very fast service considering how long the line was.",UNK
1850,"This place is your standard American Chinese cuisine. Honestly, nothing too special about any of it. I must note, however, that the spring rolls are not too shabby.",UNK
1851,They microwaved our dim sum in front of us. Depressing. Nothing more to stay.,UNK
1852,Decent.  Room had a musky smoker smell to it. Nothing to write home about.,UNK
1853,Love the view its not filled to the max with people and room to move around.  GREAT SPOT FOR VIEWS. They have a membership but you can get in several different ways.,UNK
1854,It really wasn't that great.  Went for breakfast. It was dark and crowded. Nothing spectacular. You could get the same food at iHop for much cheaper.,UNK
1855,Horrible service. Bland food. Way over priced. And they don't even give you chips and salsa to start. Never go here.,UNK
1856,Just like some other people have said its just not what it was. Burgers are just so so and ofcourse you can buy an overpriced shirt or glass go figure,UNK
1857,"Awesome sushi, so so service. Some nights they can be great and some nights they can be incredibly slow with their service.",UNK
1858,Excellent food!  Very rich....waiters will try and upsell you so be prepared.  The bread was the best I have ever had & the mushroom pot pie was bomb!,UNK
1859,Awful attitudes of the old people behind the counter. Bad coffee and don't expect any of their pastries heated coz they dont have oven or microwave.,UNK
1860,Yum!  My favorite of any dept store restaurnt I have been too.\nGet a seat on he window and you can look out onto the strip/Wynn/Ti/Venetian.\nThe white truffle mac and cheese is superb.,UNK
1861,Like cone here late at night after a night of drinking!,UNK
1862,"Place is a great local watering hole perfect for pre gaming before a night out. Nothing spectacular but waitresses are pretty helpful unless the managers only have one girl waiting tables that night. Cant blame the waitresses but other than that, good food, good prices and a good choice.",UNK
1863,Love the choose 2 option. They are polite and the employees and managers here do a good job of keeping it clean. The spuds are awesome.,UNK
1864,"Sadly, this place is out of business, gobbled-up by the 1/2 dozen starbucks stores within a mile of the place.  Seek!  Find! Report!  Boycott corporate coffee!",UNK
1865,"Friendly but not the best work.  My manicure kinda looked like I painted my own nails.  The paint didn't go all the way to my cuticles, they had gaps between my nails and my cuticles.",UNK

1869,We've been waiting so long for our food that I don't care what it tastes like anymore.,UNK

1871,"Friendly staff, unique location, and awesome food! Have yet to try something I haven't enjoyed! The local farm to table concept and beer are killer!",UNK
1872,"The food here is really good. I've had both the tacos and burritos. Their gucamole is also quite yummy. On the downside, I think their portions are a little on the small side.",UNK
1873,Closest restaurant to Neighborhood Theater but walk the extra yards to better as the wings and pizza were less than average.,UNK
1874,I was pretty bummed when the Phoenix location closed.  You can always get a hearty breakfast here.  I like the spicy in-house sausage - biscuits and gravy on the side and you are talking my language.,UNK
1875,TURN DOWN THE DAMN MUSIC!! the cream puff I had at that papa place was pretty good. Couldn't hear anything though.,UNK
1876,"The place was fairly easy to find, we were greeted and sat immediately despite the rush. Did take a while to get our drink order due to short staffing. Otherwise, the food totally made up for it! A nice, and much needed spot in the Mesa area!",UNK
1877,"Average place, slightly overpriced- would go back, but wouldn't seek it again.",UNK
1878,This place is kind of like a train wreck.  One between a train full of Jersey Shore castoffs and a train full of Paris Hilton wannabes.  Just stay away.,UNK
1879,Definitely good but not great.  If your looking for a safe bet at the Gold Coast this is definitely a good choice.,UNK
1880,"Food was decent, service was terrible. What kind of sushi restaurant serves sushi without wasabi? Let's just say this place is far from authentic!",UNK
1881,"Delicious burger, lobster pot pie....excellent service. the best of all they let me in wearing hello kitty flip flops! Lol",UNK
1882,"Great wine. Poor menu and food. I won't be back.  But if you are going for nice wines and  pretty women and don't care about the food, then this might work for you.",UNK
1883,"Friendly service, great atmosphere, excellent coffee (they have their own house blend of a local coffeemaker) and phenomenal food!!!",UNK
1884,"You know, I had dinner here  the other night for the first time and the food was good, just above ok but no where near great.  Our server was nice but didn't know the beer menu at all.  Also, It took forever for our main course to arrive. Overall it was meh.",UNK
1885,Good food- expensive. Great ambiance . All in all a pleasant experience.,UNK
1886,The food here was good but our waitress disappeared after we got our food. After waiting an extra 15 mins we decided that it must be free so we got up and left.,UNK
1887,bring back the taco flatbread thingie!!,UNK
1888,"This is a real treat for anyone who wants to get some faith back in great restaurant food that is not overpriced, especially considering the quality of food they serve: organic meats, never-frozen fish, and generous portions.",UNK
1889,"Great price, fast and friendly service! Was done in about 10 mins. Can't ask for more than that!",UNK
1890,Save your money for another day - Very poor value for 300$.\nHad much better food for the same price in other cities. \nWine parings where very small pours\nLobster was deep fried\ndesert was marginal.,UNK
1891,Hated it.  Boring.  Wasn't funny at all.  I can't believe people pay to go see him.,UNK
1892,Gloomy location with great food. The panang is great. Very nice sticky rice with coconut ice cream.,UNK
1893,"Carefree Resort...not my choice.  I can \""care less\"" about this place.  Rooms smell like a sewer and the employees are not friendly.  I hope I won't be returning!",UNK
1894,My friend and I went there and order ramen. The service is very slow. The ramen is so bad. The soup is filled with all soy bean sauce the noodle is very very firm. hard to eat. I will never order it again,UNK
1895,I had to stop here just to pee and would never go in there again way to smokey.,UNK
1896,Saw this guy on 3TV segment.  Just a heads up he was rolling little balls of fondant in his bare hands and sticking them on a side of a cake.  If you want to eat food that has been rolled around in someone's bare hands by all means give this place a try.,UNK
1897,Loved the atmosphere and ladies' night special!,UNK
1898,"Great food, awesome taste and great customer service! So happy there right around the corner and quick.",UNK
1899,"It was good, but dated. But some would say that's the appeal.",UNK

1903,the. best. vanilla. ice. cream. on. earth. \n\nperiod!,UNK
1904,The man who worked in the electronics department (specifically cell phone sales) did not want to be at work today. He looked bored or tired and just wanted to be left alone. I hope he got some rest.,UNK
1905,"I have been here plenty of times....lunch as well as dinner. The food is almost always good. In fact, the location on the west has a nicer ambience so I would go there, especially for dinner.",UNK
1906,"Food is good, but service is a way too slow. So, if you have 1 hour lunch, do not go there as you will get your food 5 minutes before your lunch is over.",UNK
1907,"Although this airport is old, dated and lacking any nice amenities the airport is small and easy to navigate.  The taxi line can get super long but it moves fast so don't be discouraged. \n\nStay away from the slots. Some of the worst odds in the whole city.",UNK
1908,"Gas is 40 cents cheaper in Arizona than California? Yes, yes it is. Motherfuckers.",UNK
1909,"This review was for the buffet, um it took them about an hour to sit a party of 16. Then when we paid they wanted to seat the ones with the champagne deal on one end if the table and such. The food was good really yummy. I enjoyed it.",UNK
1910,The menu is very creative and the staff are very nice. It is a beautiful restaurant and the atmosphere is great outside. This place is not very busy yet and hopefully it will catch on and fill up soon.,UNK
1911,"It was fine for the area when you're in town for work and need a place close to the hotel/mall. However, I would not recommend.",UNK
1912,"When you walk inside the place looks extremely outdated nothing like some of the other Wendy's restaurants. Aside from the cosmetic part I do agree with a lot of the other reviews. The staff indeed isn't the friendliest,  but the food is like any other Wendy's restaurant.",UNK
1913,"Cool ambiance. Good appetizers. Don't order the short rib unless a) you like every bite to be either fatty or dry/charred, and b) you like your grits lukewarm and creamy.",UNK
1914,"Great tortillas and tamales served with sticky floors, scary bathrooms and regularly overflowing waste cans hurts Carolina's reputation. If they could hose the place down once in awhile, it would definately get more stars from me.",UNK
1915,Worst pizza I've had it's insane how they managed to still stay open,UNK
1916,"Service can be spotty, but the food is always good.  Another commenter referenced Azteca, and I would choose this restaurant 100% of the time over Azteca.  Definitely the best authentic Mexican in the area.",UNK
1917,"What happened?!  I know I haven't been to Jamba Juice in a while, but the cups got smaller, prices got bigger and the 'original' recipes vanished.  Shame on you!  I don't think I am ever coming back again.",UNK
1918,"I like this Bashas, especially Karen, BUT THE STARBUCKS SUCKS! They screwed up my order of almost $20! Not cool.",UNK

1920,"Loco Patron has become our new neighborhood haunt.  I'm a fan of their Loco Trio.  Big portion sizes, low prices, good margaritas, and Wednesday night poker. Definitely a sports bar with a Mexican flair.",UNK

1922,Hands down the best show on the strip.  I've seen the other cirque due soleil shows and this one is the grandest.,UNK
1923,I love Green and this location is so much more convenient than the Scottsdale location. My only gripe is the hours. I feel like they close too early and should be open on Sundays too. Give me MORE Green please.,UNK
1924,"I am a Realtor and this company took great care of my buyers,  5 fogged window replacements were part of the buyers repair requests and Rem A D always did what they said they would do. I will be using them again soon.",UNK

1928,Just go. It's nice and they have really great exhibitions.,UNK
1929,Great food but I can't tolerate poor service. Called in order and was told they were busy. Would be 20-30 mins. Order took an hour. Unacceptable.,UNK
1930,This is where pseudo hippies and eco yuppies cluster to drink coffee and cultivate awareness.,UNK

1937,this is an update from my last review...the dine in buffet at after noon is good..,UNK
1938,Gotta get the deals we need one of theses stores in Hawaii.... Great place to shop,UNK
1939,"Been in the neighboring stores and always saw a line running out of monta ramen. There are lots of ways you can do ramen, they have a limited selection.  The ramen choices they do have all delicious. But I'd have to say their fried race stood out the most to me",UNK
1940,"Service was super slow, and it was not a busy night.  Pizza was not exciting.",UNK

1949,"From the walk over to a casual look at the crowd I was expecting a horrible time, but I found everyone here to be friendly and pleasant. I didn't care for the cocktails here, but I had a far more pleasant time then expected. The manger Jerry is a really sweet fellow.",UNK
1950,"We Never had potatoes in enchiladas before, not good. Asked for more salsa and chips, they never came, marguerites were lousy. Service was very poor. With all the Mexican choices this doesn't cut it.",UNK
1951,Nice hotel with comfortable rooms. The only difficult part is learning the roads to get in and out - they are a little confusing.,UNK
1952,Nothing special. It's Americanized Mexican food and pricey! Happy hour only reason to go,UNK
1953,Whoever put Yes in the 'Good for kids' category LIED!  Good pizza but I'm disappointed that I have to go elsewhere after eating to get my child something to eat.,UNK
1954,Cool chilled out vibe. Very friendly team. Unique take on dishes that were still really good. scallop caprese and Bleeding Heart Ravioli were a good compliment. I'd be back to try something else on this imaginative menu.,UNK

1956,The watermelon gelato was heavenly and very refreshing but it also cost an arm and a leg....$4 for ONE scoop!! what a rip off. So go if you're willing to splurge on gelato.,UNK

1958,Carne asada gorditas are the best!!! Best gorditas in town. Try their Horchata too.,UNK

1960,"just a tad pricey i thought for Thai food, but the portions were more than enough to share with many....loved the soup, wish i remembered the name!",UNK

1968,"10.50 a person, clean, polite staff",UNK
1969,Based on the previous reviews i was super excited to eat here. However i was a bit disapointed. Fried chicken was kind of bland but nice and juicy and the fried catfish was kind of soggy. Mac and cheese and greens were very good. Service was slow.,UNK

1971,I've had a copy of Jingle All The Way since it came out and they haven't charged me a late fee yet. Talk about refusing to enforce the laws.,UNK

1977,Poorly cooked pizza i will say that the people are somewhat nice when ordering but would not give this place another chance,UNK

1979,Duh! Simon Be Boss! Loves One Piece! Believe It! I'm Gonna Be King of the Pirates!,UNK
1980,"We've been ordering from this Domino's forever.  I can't remember ever being disappointed in what they delivered.  Only once was there an error, and a corrected delivery arrived superfast.  Love these guys.",UNK

1990,Good drinks with some run of the mill tapas. Nothing was innovative which I don't mind since it wasn't to expensive. My food taste a little burnt which is what cost it the fourth star. Overall it's worth trying and you may like it better than I did.,UNK
1991,Do not get Lunch box. The katsu was dry. Fruits was canned pineapple which no one touched in my group.  Its not worth for $9.,UNK

2002,Very disappointed. Walked in. Very rudely told no appointment no service. So I made an appointment and came back. They left me waiting 30 minutes could have walked in somewhere else and waited 30 minutes. Do not recommend very rude guy running it named Danny.,UNK
2003,This place is a HUGE waste of space in the basement of the Luxor. All the warm food was cold and the cold food warm. Save your appetite and your money for something better.,UNK

2011,This place closed back around the first of the year.  Very sorry to see them go.,UNK
2012,"I agree that the food is uneven. Much of it is good, like the paella, but some of it is nothing special. A pitcher of Sangria is quite pricey here, but the staff seem to have a multi-national background and are interesting.",UNK
2013,Went and it was fine for breakfast. Service was nice food was eh. Nothing special.  Wish I had more to say about it.,UNK
2014,"-Traditional bar food, it was nothing special.\n-Good atmosphere for a sports bar \n-Nice outside seating area\n-Draft Beer was bad as was the White Sangria",UNK
2015,Definitely suitable for carnivores. My vegetarian dish did not exceed the expectation.,UNK

2017,"My friends and I all ordered breakfast. The food was mediocre but edible. However, I was not satisfied. If I am going to pay $17 for eggs benedict, I expect it to be above average. In this case, it was just meh.",UNK
2018,food ok  experience continues to go down,UNK

2032,Price is good but never have eaten at a sushi place with all you can eat that doesn't allow all specialty rolls to be offered,UNK

2034,"Awesome service, atmosphere, people and tattoos! Quality work! Great place for locals. What an amazing experience!!!",UNK

2037,On the first trip to Madison and it was a great place to eat at....\nThis 2nd trip they were out of sirloin and gave us grief over giving us a discount for up-charging our steak.....,UNK
2038,The worst service ever sitting in our table for more then 20 min with no one to approach us to take or drink order and when asked to speak to a manager rude as well not even an apology and pretty much told us it was busy since they have two floors and we could wait never returning,UNK
2039,"The sushi was good, the service absolutely sucked!  2 of us did all you can eat.  Ordered two rolls and two nigiri, first round took 20 minutes plus to get to us.  2nd round took even longer!  Will not return.",UNK

2043,"Edible, but nothing to write home about.  Had a taco salad, pretty generic, not much flavor",UNK
2044,"Like dancing in a closet.  If you have a damaged ear drum it might be a good idea, but for the rest of us it is just absurd.  Go to Voo Doo. Better drinks, better atmosphere and better view.  Plus you can move your arms without hitting 6 people.",UNK
2045,Arrived very late and immediately taken with the ambiance and the VERY cool kitchen that you can watch. Had an incredible meal that I am still thinking about 2 years later all the way here in Chicago.....  I would go back to Vegas just to eat here!,UNK
2046,"Delicious, light and airy crepes. Two of us split a savory and a dessert crepe, and the portions were perfect. The shop reminds me of an old time soda shop. Outside seating is small and shady.",UNK
2047,"If you love cevaps, you will love Euro Grill!  Definately add the ajvar & kajmak when ordering.  This is the only place in Charlotte that offers cevaps and other Bosnian specialties.",UNK

2049,"I like this place. If you're in the mood for Waffles, I encourage you to stop by.",UNK

2051,Really good coffee and good hot chocolate too.,UNK
2052,Pretty good for 3AM pizza. Knocked off a star because the slices were sweating off oils... (probably because we ordered all of the meats). Crust is on the thin side. Would come back when craving pizza in Vegas!,UNK
2053,"Rooftop deck! What else is there to say? The service was good, the signature drinks were yummy, the venue was awesome.\n\n-1 star for the high prices and no happy hour.",UNK
2054,"A gem in Stonecrest. Fresh ingredients, friendly service and a great value. Finally an establishment in this specific store location that adds color to the area and a simple beer/wine pizza option before a movie. This one could last.",UNK
2055,Fantastic service. Cheap sake and beer.,UNK
2056,"Elegant and decent selection, but in my opinion a bit overpriced for what you get in terms of furniture.  Would not hesitate to shop here for accessories, accents, artwork, or lighting fixtures but would probably look elsewhere for seating options.",UNK
2057,It was ok. Too much of a chain feel to it for it to be considered authentic Greek food. Try Pita Jungle instead.,UNK
2058,On peut m\u00eame se faire graver son nom sur un m&ms !\nunique !!,UNK
2059,Stopped here a few times for the yummy baklava. I've eaten lunch here once and it was fabulous. I had the tan-tan chicken and it was amazing! Moist chicken and lovely flavors.,UNK
2060,"The wait time is horrible , being close to the strip doesn't help but it is unreal. The urgent care  is under staff and from what it seems overwork . On the plus side it is clean  but there is no plus given for the time you lose.",UNK
2061,"This place is pretty sweet. Great atmosphere, good selection of music. Good tap beers. Old movies on roll, nice chill bar.",UNK
2062,"I used to love this place, but something is obviously different now. Frozen seafood, small portions, so-so service and staff not knowing the menu. In a town starving for a good Italian restaurant, this one is just not worth it.",UNK
2063,"Forgettable food, drink, and atmosphere.  Friendly service though and easily accommodates midsized to larger parties which suited our needs.",UNK
2064,"I'd heard a few recommendations to try the pizza here. I was thoroughly disappointed. The only reason I give it 2 stars instead of 1 is that they offer some options you don't find at every pizza place. With that said, I didn't really like the pizza.",UNK
2065,"The lines keep getting worse and the quality of food is significantly less on lunch vs. dinner.  Ironically, dinner costs roughly 40% more.  Still good food, and a decent value with the players card.",UNK
2066,"Way too expensive for a burger that was good, but I've had better. For 15.00 they could've thrown in some fries at least. Service was great though and atmosphere was nice.",UNK
2067,My girlfriend took me here on our way through Charlotte during a recent vacation. Enjoyed it well enough although I can't say it was memorable. The atmosphere was very lively but it was a bit pricey. I'd go again though.,UNK
2068,"Excellent food, drinks and service. We go out a lot, dining on the best places and this one is definitely one of the best.",UNK
2069,The prime rib breakfast special is great. It is only served Sunday till it runs out though.I prefer my hash browns crunchy and they were perfect today.,UNK
2070,Great new location.  Bar in the center.  Place looks great!  Had to have the chips and salsa that are so tasty.  Had chicken tacos that come with spicy cabbage slaw and slice avocado. Yum.  Another success story from Big Burrito Group.,UNK

2073,super awesome!!!,UNK
2074,"They sell bento boxes to-go.  There are fish, chicken, and combination Bento boxes.  It's a relatively cheap lunch - like $4 for a small Bento and $6 for a large one.  It's high quality food for the price.",UNK
2075,I think Macayo's is pretty good! They have a great menu however I think they're a bit over priced. (I'd recommend Aribas).,UNK
2076,"Wow. We were sitting at Paw's bar tonight, too. We thought it was us. Guess it was him afterall. We like Sasa Sushi on Cheyenne and Buffalo better. A FRIENDLIER, more personable atmosphere.",UNK
2077,Dr. Estavillo was key in connecting us to a pre-marital counselor in our area.,UNK

2084,Nice salon. Got a pedicure while my wife gets a manicure.  Great ped chairs with massage!,UNK

2087,"Ribs are my favorite, I read the reviews and was so happy to try these. The truth is they were not eatable. I hated them and no one in my family would eat them. Do not waste your money here.  They were not cooked right and the seasoning was flat out nasty.",UNK
2088,"Amazing. Everything is amazing. I don't know what else to say. If you can afford it, eat here at least once in your life",UNK
2089,"There masala dosa was awesome. Curries and naan were above average. Overall the food is good, but staff including owner are very serious and unfriendly. Better to take \""to go\"" food.",UNK

2121,They never answered their phone.\nMaybe they're out of business?,UNK

2191,Paradise Cantina is centrally located! It is not far from the strip... so it's great for both locals and tourists.  I would recommend this place to everyone looking for a fun bar with great drink specials!,UNK
2192,Horrible service. Don't bother stopping here!,UNK
2193,Great local BBQ spot!,UNK
2194,The cowd was ehh. The outside area was nice. Only one square that will let you see the bottom. They really hyped up this bar on The Real World. I expected more but it was cool.,UNK
2195,This is my 4th stay here in the past 2 years. Now that it is no longer a Hilton it is a disaster. I will never stay here again. Smoke filled and dirty.,UNK
2196,Updated:  they simply can't get their Americanos done right even with complaints and no I am not picky. .   After a few visits with no better results they get a one star review at best,UNK
2197,I had the chicken pita and was very pleased.  Clean friendly and comfortable atmosphere lead to an enjoyable dinner.  I recommend crazy pita to anyone that wants a quick bite to eat for cheap.  \n\nOne more thing... try the Casablanca lager.,UNK
2198,The best restaurant in Verrado and Buckeye...hand's down.,UNK
2199,Food was tasty.  Definitely better than many of the other reviews suggested.  I had the chicken enchilada and chili relleno combination.  2 for 1 special on the combination right now.  Great deal for dinner.,UNK

2202,"I felt the food was expensive for what it was w/ very small portions. That would have been accepted but the waitstaff was terribly rude. The food was average. I heard they took the photo booth out, so that looses some points, too.",UNK
2203,"This yogurt was alright, but it wasn't as creamy as I would have liked... I've had much better yogurt pretty much everywhere.\n\nWell, the sprinkles were good. I'll give them that lol",UNK
2204,"Great experience for the NFL DRAFT on Thursday night. Food was good, service was great!!!!!! Thank you Crystal!",UNK

2206,"Good food, sometimes the service lack.  Great atmosphere,  Would recommend this place based on that.  Otherwise pretty typical prime steak joint.",UNK
2207,"Their sign out front says \""Best in Las Vegas\"" and I fully agree. I have been to a few different spots to get a haircut but I have only gone back to Elliott & Co. Great atmosphere and they know their business.",UNK
2208,"Avoid at all costs. I think their name is now XO Nails. They were unprofessional, dirty and in then end I am not happy. Should of left before they started.",UNK
2209,"Had a medium Canadian bacon pineapple.  Very good, quality cheese, did to go, took them 30-40 minutes (Friday).  The place was packed!",UNK

2211,"Meh! After reading the reviews and the number of times the wait was an hour or more, I expected much more. \nThe pizza was not much better than Dominoes. The pasta was ok, and the service left a lot to be desired.",UNK

2213,"I am back! The foods still greats, the services awesome and now they have beer and wine..lol!",UNK

2216,"671 Yelp reviews........not so secret.\n\nGood slice of pizza, probably one of the better values on the strip. The guys working there were cool. No complaints.",UNK
2217,Only good thing I can say about this place is the food was hot. Service sucks they don't pick up your plates or refill your drinks. Food was so-so. Defiantly NOT WORTH how expensive it is!!!,UNK
2218,"Don't bother.  Overpriced, immemorable food served by a creepy waiter.  AND he didn't bother to tell me when I asked for water for the table that it would be $6 a bottle!!!!  \n\nYuck to the whole experience here.",UNK

2221,Everytime I go there is awesome! Everybody enjoying the hot sauna :) Good staff too.,UNK
2222,Not McDonald's fast but still faster then In-N-Out yet amazingly good. Don't have a very good side selection at all. The woman who took our order was... eccentric and would be oblivious of who Emily Post is but was still charming and efficient.,UNK
2223,"Got the Large pizza (delivered),  had good flavor and seemed to be quality ingredients, however the grease level was on the excessive side.  I'll probably go back and try the subs",UNK
2224,"Love this store! Always clean,. Always fresh items. Very friendly staff. Hardly any waiting for check out. Absolutely love this store. Has much better variety than other stores in the area. Worth the drive if you live in south central Phoenix. Love love love this store!",UNK
2225,"After Planet Dailies and Trader Vic's, I was soooooo happy to land at P F Chang's.  Good food, pretty good service, resonable prices.  Only a few minor negatives, but I much preferred P F Chang's.",UNK

2227,"The facility is very nice and clean and all the staff is so very nice, this is my favorite hospital in las Vegas",UNK
2228,Divey pub with a decent atmosphere.  A little too smokey for my taste and the beer selection on tap is nothing to brag about.  The crowd was a combination of skater types and preppy types.  It was interesting but not that exciting.,UNK
2229,Reopening this friday,UNK
2230,Me and my family were walking and found this little spot its very cute and the ice cream is the best i LOVE that they have games in the back also this is my family's new Sunday spot its very fun and its a cute little place,UNK

2233,Uhu...it just doesnt stand out,UNK
2234,This was the best noodle house I had been to.  The noodles were freshly pulled and the broth was very tasty.  Wish they had such a noodle shop in Sacramento.,UNK
2235,"Didn't last very long. Drove past it today and the sign was gone and it appeared to be shut. \n\nYet another victim of the economy, not to mention they were too pricy and not very good product, sadly.",UNK
2236,Nice local place with some interesting rolls you won't get at other places! My favorite was the tiger roll. We also liked their gyoza and tofu appetizer. Great service.. We plan on coming back!,UNK
2237,Hot and lovely. Long line and unfriendly door staff.,UNK
2238,Not a bad place to get food specials under $4. Service was not horrendous as they do get very busy here with high volume of folks lining up for good steggs after clubbing hours.,UNK
2239,Amazing. Beers are $1.50 and they will give you a freezer pop if you ask. Be sure and ask.,UNK
2240,Maybe 2 1/2 stars.  I'll come here for a trim.  They seem to do okay with men's hair though.  My husband has come here a few times and gotten a nice cut.,UNK

2242,Delish! Chicken fingers & wings are da truth!,UNK
2243,"I always like the meatloaf, mashed potatoes and green beans.  This Bob Evans was like the others.  Average chain service.  Good when needing something familiar :-)",UNK

2245,"Wonderful view, wonderful service.  I've eaten here several times but I always get lobster so I can't comment on other items.  The food was always great.",UNK
2246,Nice services. Their drunken noodle tastes like basic chow fun. The green curry is decent. The sea food dish is relatively fresh.,UNK
2247,By far the absolute worst restaurant in Montreal. Food tasted terrible and the service was cold and impersonal. Two of the four people in our group ended up vomiting when they got home. I would not recommend this place to my worst enemy.,UNK
2248,Took an order to go and found the spaghetti and meatballs to be pretty good.  That was about it.  House salad was sub par and the bread tasted like they picked it up from the grocery store.,UNK
2249,This place is really underrated. If you get there before 4pm you can get the lunch portion... It's a lot of food! The banana treats they give you after your meal are delish!,UNK
2250,"New in town and wanted a breakfast place within walking distance to our apartment. The Breakfast Club filled the bill. Great food, great service. We'll be back.",UNK
2251,"Small plates were pretty cool. Definitely recommend the truffle brussell sprouts and pork buns,\n\nRamen was just OK, though. Thin noodles and broth was not thick, rich, or hearty.",UNK
2252,Went for just a pint and hoping to get a smoke salmon appetizer.  But to my surprise not smoke salmon appetizer to be found.  Service was kinda slow but I was there mid week and early afternoon.  If I had more time in the city I'd give it another try.,UNK
2253,"Even though this place is off the \""touristy\"" Royal Mile, it really has great food. My husband and I ate there twice, dinner and breakfast, and both were delicious. I have to say that the Traditional Scottish breakfast was one of the best breakfasts of the trip.",UNK
2254,"Shannon is fantastic! I had a photoshoot that I needed to be tan for and she gave me a beautiful, custom tan. The scent wasn't as overpowering as other solutions and it lasted just a little less than a week. I would highly recommend her to anyone! Thank you Shannon!",UNK
2255,"Good place to go for late night eating. We got the truffle tater tots, which tasted even better the night after. I got the french onion soup, had a lot of cheese and was delicious. Service was ok, but plus that it was open late!",UNK
2256,"The food was good, but seriously.....$21.95 for a 6 oz chicken dish. No kids menu. Three servers for a thirty person party and a half full dining room. The original tutti's was much better",UNK
2257,Horrible drinks. Manager could tell we were not happy with our drinks fixed only one. Food needs help. Bartender had a bad attitude. Server was amazingl. Great tacos at take out bar,UNK
2258,"outpost doesn't measure up. \n\nWins: ahi tuna salad, seafood platter, peppermint ice cream. \nFail: oysters",UNK
2259,Great Thai in the desert,UNK

2261,Rented a full size SUV through priceline and we were in and out of the rental place very quickly.  They gave us a 2015 Tahoe with all the bells and whistles with only 2500 miles on it.  The gentleman helping us was very friendly.,UNK
2262,Very tasty-yes; the stuffed dates are a must.  Nice to find a place in Vegas that's not either cheesy or super high end.   Just a good place to have a nice dinner.,UNK
2263,The Thin Man Sandwich is amazing and worth the trip alone but the sides and soup were also very good. Service was friendly and fast.  Can't wait to go back and try everything else.,UNK

2265,The burger was really good. The service wasn't good.,UNK
2266,The customer service was rude and refused to refund our money for the night we didn't stay.,UNK
2267,Everything is excellent. Can't wait to go back,UNK
2268,"Though we are non locals, we are allowed to have computer privileges which we use frequently while on vacation.  There are a sufficient quantity of computers so we never have to wait.  The staff is very friendly and helpful.",UNK
2269,Over-Hyped. They offer vegan options and everything is natural but the taste is nothing out if this world and the wait time is a bit ridiculous. Not something I would go out of my way for.,UNK
2270,Went there because of reviews on yelp. Followed thru with the suggestion on what to order. The hero. Bring your appetite. Sandwich to large for 1 person. I finished the whole thing. I'm not that big of eater. Recommended.,UNK

2273,Food was ok. Pallea had shell fish that wasn't properly cleaned...got a bit of sand and one of the giant shrimps still had most of its vein...yucky. The service and callamary was great. Red sangria was great also!,UNK
2274,"First time a Joes! The food was good but nothing blew me away! I had the stone crabs, oysters on the half shell and madagascar shrimp. The service was awkward but good.",UNK
2275,"Always busy at lunchtime. Wish they would let us call in our order for pick up as we only get 30 minutes for lunch. Staff is pleasant. Food always fresh. Only negative complaint, they do not wipe the tables down on a regular basis.",UNK
2276,"We had issues with a misspelled name on our ticket and the staff was so helpful in getting it changed in a timely matter. Also, Jordan, one of our flight attendants, was the most amazing and pleasant flight attendant ever! Made everyone laugh and was very entertaining.",UNK
2277,"Pork belly bao buns were decent, though not the best. But their euro burger was delicious! Truffle Parmesan fries with aioli dip was perfect. And their shakes topped with pudding is a genius invention. Everything was delicious! Eat here.",UNK
2278,Went last night for a late dinner around 10pm. The service and ambiance were great. I loved the entertainment. The food was pretty good except for my lamb. I ordered it medium rare and it came out well done. It was the worst lamb I ever had.,UNK

2280,"This place is closed as of September 12'th 2014, sign on the door says they were closed by order of the Nevada courts. ??",UNK

2283,I don't mind the airport itself but the wait for baggage is ridiculous.  45 minute flight home from Vegas and 30+ minute wait on baggage. Insane!,UNK
2284,I can't say anything except I'm glad I tried this place.  Their hamburger was great.  I can't wait to go there next week.,UNK
2285,Stopped here for a late night bite. The chicken fingers were decent. Had a breakfast plate that was kinda bland. Decent service and atmosphere though.,UNK
2286,Great place for gasoline. The store is dirty and poorly maintained. The men's bathroom as broken and tagged up on a recent visit.,UNK
2287,"Nice clean location, friendly staff. \nTwo stars because they have, and I have let them, forget my ice cream cone twice.",UNK
2288,Looks are deceiving.........Burger is comparable to a $1 burger at a fast food chain.  Milkshakes are total artificial flavoring!  Don't let the cheap prices tempt you!,UNK
2289,I love popeyes chicken but this location wasn't as good as I had in Atlanta and Arlington.  Every table in the place was dirty. Chicken was not great seemed to be sitting to long. Won't come to this location again.,UNK
2290,Chicken Burrito is usually pretty good! This past time it had a little too much rice and not enough chicken and sauce. I would go back again...,UNK
2291,"Might have been great if the server ever brought us our drinks. Waited 25 min, said something, waited 5 more, and bailed. Not even crowded on a Sunday night.",UNK
2292,This place has a heck of a philly! the 8oz was split between 3 guys along with a large sausage pizza. I took a half and a slice and I was stuffed. They truly pack the philly!,UNK
2293,"This place was great \nLooks iffy on the outside and totally Funk on the inside.  It's looks like Gorge Clinton was the interior designer.  The food was really good and the staff was very friendly.  They are open 24 hours \""+\"" very recommend.",UNK
2294,"CLOSED. As of November 2009, this place is now closed.",UNK
2295,"They have all of the standard Mexican food options: tacos, burritos, enchiladas, tostadas, etc. But, for a counter service place, You can do better for yourself at several other places in town.",UNK
2296,Cheddar cheese is NOT Mexican!,UNK
2297,"Order the spice at 8 or 9, it's perfect. If you order the spicy chicken salad it is important to ask for it extra hot. Excellent food.",UNK

2299,Ate at this location twice first time was just ok...and my second time I got food poising,UNK
2300,"Jeff Dreikosen replaced our garage door sometime in May or June.  Based on YELP reviews, we thought we'd give this company a try.  My husband and I were really pleased at how professional and knowlegeable he is.  Highly recommended!",UNK
2301,This was an okay gym. Its smaller than some of their other gyms . So if your trying to lift be prepared to wait. If your looking to do cardio there more machines than you can shake a stick at .,UNK
2302,Pizza is definitely not NY style. Soft crust not crisp like NY pizza. Mediocre pizza at best.  Crust tastes like frozen pizza crust. I wont be going back.,UNK
2303,came here for breakfast nad had some good food!  the portion was good and the food was served hot and tasty.  Don't know about other meals but this place is fine for breakfast.,UNK
2304,"Haven't been able to try yet, but apparently they're closed now on Sat/Sundays. Just so you know...",UNK
2305,"Love the self serve kiosk at this location that is open 24 hours! It allows me to drop off and ship packages at my connivence  and the best part is the line is never that long...max 1 to 2 people at most, even at Christmas time.",UNK
2306,Wow you are at their mercy. Waiting 3 hours from check in to even be seen for preoperative.  No communication just told this is the way it is.... so far not impressed.,UNK

2308,Waiting for airport shuttle for 40 minutes. I quit! Absolute BS - your 1.6 miles from the airport. Nice job. I'll thankfully get on the 3rd Fairfield shuttle I've seen on my wait. Slackers.....,UNK
2309,Average decent 24hr restaurant that opens. Great place for Mandalay guests that are staying there to grab bites after the club. But I have to say its great they open 24hrs with good to large portions just that they need to lighten up with the salt.,UNK
2310,Love this place.    Great burgers.   Swanky vibe,UNK
2311,"Great venue. Many cigar sites rate this as a top cigar bar, but they don't allow cigar smoking. :\\",UNK
2312,I was a little nervous because I just moved out here from CA and didn't have a hairstylist. I found The Root on Yelp and I loved it. It lived up to its high rating. My hair looks amazing and the prices were reasonable. I am a customer for good!,UNK
2313,"Crazy busy, crazy packed and a happening place, but I wouldn't go again without a table and VIP access as the line up outside was insane!",UNK

2317,"Wow, great chocolate truffles... in downtown Madison. Excellent in beautiful boxes. They're made in their factory in Verona, Wisconsin. Fresh and delicious.",UNK

2320,Get the swedish massage.\n\n(end review),UNK

2322,It's a ride from the east valley but worth every mile. They assessed all the tires and found all the issues.,UNK
2323,"Apathetic service, not a brewing company, just a bar.  Pass this one by.",UNK
2324,Pretty lame. Nothing but a bunch of vendors. Stupid stuff like Dish tv or car rentals. The kids didn't even really enjoy it. Nothing like it used to be. Just completely commercialized. :(,UNK
2325,I haven't been to old navy in awhile so I was okay with this store. First time it was pretty messy from all the Christmas shoppers but the second time was a little cleaner. They did have good sales for all ages.,UNK

2331,"Food is good and close by, the service is so poor... I don't think they offer training to their servers and staff.. Obviously the cooks have the training they need. If I wanted good food and piss poor service I would have dinner with an angry ex",UNK
2332,"Almost as good as Fazoli's, only without free breadsticks and 5x the price. QUITE disappointing.",UNK
2333,"I frequent this place often, it makes decent bagels but I've eaten NYC Hot Bagels in brooklyn and this doesn't even compare.\n\nBut its an ok bagel place for sin city",UNK
2334,Nice atmosphere. Really clean. First time doing a true Vegan restaurant.,UNK
2335,there service was fabulous and burgers were  on point!  I highly recommend this joint!,UNK
2336,Great view of the strip at night. You could pay extra for an all you can drink bar furbished compartment. It took 30 minutes to complete the ride. You will be placed on the ride with others. The walk leading up to the high roller was a nice break from the strip.,UNK
2337,So came down here on a Friday night to check out the local scene.  Well the NO COVER advertisement is a lie and no one was even here.,UNK
2338,"Manager contacted me, explaining some of the recent problems.  I appreciate the effort, and for that I'll add a star.",UNK

2340,"Veggie Delight very great cooking and good flavor foods, fresh and clean.\nI love it.",UNK
2341,This place is very expensive compared to any other breakfast place in the valley. They really don't offer larger portions of food or higher quality to bring the prices they are asking.,UNK

2344,The pepperoni 's tasted stale. I couldn't believe they would send that nasty pizza out. My family could not eat this horrible pizza.,UNK
2345,Extremely dissapointing! For $120 I expected an actual jump. This was more like an extremely controlled descent. Not worth the price at all!,UNK
2346,I have ordered 3 times so far. Delivery is always super quick. My daughter loves the wonton soup and sesame chicken. I have tried several sushi and sashimi options. Impressive! Our new Fave!,UNK
2347,"Strange service, but the red curry is to die for!",UNK

2351,OUT OF MARGARITAS  ... This should not happen in the middle of the day.,UNK
2352,I had the black and white cupcake which was delicious! Wish I had time to try some more! The only reason I only gave 4 stars is because the wait can be very long! My friend got a milkshake and waited a good 15 minutes! Besides that everything tasted great! :),UNK
2353,Was very disappointed with their online inventory not being current. I called about replacing a specific tire and was told they had it. The tire that was mounted on my rim was not the one I requested and was a no name tire with dry rot around the rim. Will never return.,UNK
2354,Our server Cole was personable but not obtrusive!  BBQ delectable as always!   Side salad is plenty for two and the drunkin apples are  so tasty!,UNK

2367,Best steakhouse on the strip. Be prepared to pay the price - but worth every ounce. Make sure you reserve in advance otherwise you will be stuck with a slot that might not fit your hunger schedule. \n\nRecommendable.,UNK
2368,"Was looking forward to this experience, but made the mistake of going there really hungry.  The waiter took soo dang long without even giving us any water or anything that all 6 of us got up and left.",UNK
2369,"Great that it isn't part of a casino. Rooms are very nice, I would totally stay here again. Nice that it is close enough to things and yet on the outskirts enough that you don't have to fight traffic to get there.",UNK
2370,Me and my wife went to the meatball spot the classic ball is bland and dry. The stuffed ball I had was empty the pesto was bland. The chef needs to be given salt and pepper. Neather me or my wife will be back.,UNK
2371,"Just hit the drive thru at this place. Ordered large Fries and a large coke. My fries were half full, my coke is all ice, and they didn't give me a straw or ketchup.",UNK
2372,Very interesting place especially in the afternoon great crowd good customer service highly recommend you may have to spend a little extra but I think it's worth it give it a shot I don't think you will regret it,UNK
2373,Great food and great choices. All taste fresh and they have something for every time of the day,UNK
2374,Having a bad day? Sit at the sushi bar and order a few specials. Need a bit of happiness?  Yonaka can provide multiple bites of sunshine. I love this place and always will. They never cease to amaze.,UNK
2375,"Went to this \""establishment\"" of chicken had no ranch sauce or there own blackened ranch!!!",UNK
2376,"Don't waste your time. The waitresses are beyond slow, and once they are done flirting with the table next to you, she might  visit your table and then disappear.",UNK
2377,They always have either what I'm looking for or a really good alternative!,UNK
2378,Ate the seafood alfredo and was VERY disappointed. The sauce was very watery and bland. I basically loaded up on soup and breadsticks. Definitely a pass.,UNK
2379,"Great location, awesome atmosphere, outstanding customer service and delicious sushi!  Happy hour prices are awesome!  The monkey brains, jalepeno poppers and fish ball is a must try!  We will return!",UNK
2380,"Quick and easy stop...\nSometimes helpful, sometime not...\nRuns-out of produce...",UNK
2381,"This place was the worst of worst never have I tasted such gross food, found a hair in my food, vegetable rolls were just so nasty . We ended up throwing away 98. % of the food. This place needs closed down.",UNK
2382,Awesome! Just what my wife and I were looking for. We were in the mood for good old comfort food. Good size portions and fresh . Hostess very friendly and Anthony the waiter was great.,UNK
2383,The parking lot / drive-paths here are a nightmare. I must have made 3 passes before finally figuring out which path led me to Pax Pickup. Trying to get to the pickup area for a passenger is its own challenge as well.\nGood Luck.,UNK
2384,"Bartender and server were very friendly and helpful, very over priced, the Sandwich was extremely dry",UNK
2385,Thank you for being open Christmas day. I needed batteries for my kids toy and they where open. They were pushing the cheap ones but I stuck my guns and got the energizer.,UNK
2386,I went in one day for a Orange Julius and the machine was not working. A week later stopped in with some coworkers and chocolate cone wasnt available. A number of workers but awkward ordering and delivery system. I could not identify a supervisor/manager on duty during either visit.,UNK
2387,very  bad  service,UNK
2388,I was told there was a gluten free menu but that was not the case. Horrible options if you are gluten free.,UNK
2389,"Absolutely fantastic. Second time I have eaten here in a week, and today is only Tuesday! Cuban sandwich is to die for. Amazingly fresh ingredients. The housemade potato chips as a side are wonderful. The only thing better then the food is the hospitality. Job well done.",UNK
2390,"Loved this place.  The service was great, the restaurant was spotless, the food was really great and it was very affordable.  The Pupusa's were amazing!  I also loved their mango iced tea and the desserts were really tasty as well.",UNK
2391,"Unique and awesome. The drinks are curated, not thrown onto the menu. Food is flavorful and tasted great. A real find, should be a cult favorite. Fusion menu. I intend to eat here every time I return to Phoenix.",UNK
2392,Awesome quality at the BEST prices!!!!  Red Star Vapor allows you to custom select and flavor your juice at prices far less than what you'd pay at any other shop.  My only regret is not finding then sooner...,UNK
2393,The sandwiches had a lot less greens and vegetables than I'm used to at Subways I've frequently eaten at in California. Also didn't have any avocado... Overall the sandwiches were of much poorer quality than I've come to expect from Subway.,UNK
2394,"Smug, clickish and attitude. If you can get around that...you'll probably get a fine haircut.",UNK
2395,"Brigette was very sweet and attentive. Even as busy as they were for Sunday brunch, she helped make our experience here a great one. Ask for her when you come in!",UNK
2396,Food court quality.,UNK
2397,Very good food but music is too LOUD to have conversation with others - bring earplugs,UNK
2398,"Over priced, coffee tastes burnt.",UNK
2399,The only thing they are good for are for their curly fries.,UNK
2400,"Really not good. Really bad service. And their salad bar \""with over 50 choices of soups and salads\"" was a joke. If you're looking for a quality dining experience this is not the place.",UNK
2401,"Outstanding. Didn't try the off-the-bone ham but it looked great. Good bacon, great fresh eggs.",UNK
2402,"Just moved from Chicago... we love their pizza & garlic knots. We tried the Modesto (added spinach and sausage). Really really good. Plus, while we waited for the pizza... played a few slots next door and won enough to cover our dinner. Win win!",UNK
2403,"They are so good and take such good care to make our dogs have a relaxing experience. It's like a day spa for them. They were so relaxed after Kelly finished that they just dropped and slept. I loved them so much, I set up a regular schedule to have them maintained. Great job!",UNK
2404,"Celebrated birthday dinner with my family which included several children and the food was great our waitress was wonderful and even the other customers didn't mind the \""ring around the Rosie\"" going on in the corner. Thank you uncle sam's for the perfect evening!",UNK
2405,Been here a couple times. I liked the chicken burrito the first time but wasn't crazy about the enchiladas the second time. Nice atmosphere and location and good service. I will continue my search for a great Mexican restaurant in Montreal.,UNK
2406,"This is Fish n Chips with a Mexican flair.  Not sure what all the hype is about, though, if you like Fish n Chips, it's decent.  I just prefer the British version better.",UNK
2407,"this IS the best pizza in las vegas. Hard to think this place is just down my office and i have always passed by almost everyday. no fuss menu and owners that are really passionate on their pizza. give this a try, you will not be disappointet",UNK
2408,"This was my favorite thrift store in vegas.  But for some reason since they have remodeled its just not as good.  I can't seem to find good stuff that is reasonably priced.  I don't go anymore, and I used to go every week.",UNK
2409,"Ew, just ew. Worst Subway I've ever been too, nothing but fat people and this place was so dirty and the food was gross and stale, avoid at all costs.",UNK
2410,"This was the rudest hotel staff I have ever encountered. Although The common areas of the hotel were very nice, I was unimpressed by the room. I most likely would not say here again in the future.",UNK
2411,"Fish Tacos- awesome. Great service, delicious horchata. Guacamole was great! Love this place",UNK
2412,"This place looked really awesome and I wanted to go in and take a look. There are many fine ingredients around that I cannot find elsewhere such as truffle butter, certain Japanese tea and coffee presses and meats as desirable as Jamon Iberico. \n\nPretty awesome!",UNK
2413,Delicious Lebanese food in a cool and cozy setting. The grilled octopus is fantastic.,UNK
2414,These place is incredible it will not disappoint they are very nice they were very helpful the place I nice small joint they only have one table there so just pick up or delivery decent in price,UNK
2415,"Ogilvy is the the old school, high end department store for Montreal.  Many cities have their high end downtown department store that has always been there and in Montreal Ogilvy's is it.  Great old school service and expensive prices.",UNK
2416,"clean store, good parking - decent prices too with the gas points savings is a nice bonus.",UNK
2417,Great atmosphere with kind of an apothecary look. Good service. Quite a few craft beers on tap.,UNK
2418,I normally love this bar but the bartender tonight was Anthony and he is awful. I went to the bar to get a drink and he was off to the side flirting with someone.  As a customer I shouldn't be ignored while you try to get laid.,UNK
2419,Beautiful hotel! Prime location! Friendly staff! Top two hotels in Montreal if not the best!,UNK
2420,Sucks sucks sucks... It's open 24 hours and the dude was sleeping...boooooooo....sucks,UNK
2421,"Average food, good happy hour specials for drinks and appetizers, pretty dining room, friendly bartenders and servers. Open late.",UNK
2422,This post office sucks!!! Long lines only a couple of tellers. Place is in need of a makeover.....just horrible!!!!!!,UNK
2423,"I'm kind of getting bored with the menu here until I tried the Moroccan spiced salmon. Very delicious, the salmon was moist and the seasoning was really good, but I think the couscous is instant which is okay and I will have again when I come back here.",UNK
2424,"feels like eatting at hometown buffet! most food are super oily and creamy.  they charged $35 ...for such service and food quality , i dont think its worth it. \nbest dish : watermelon o_O",UNK
2425,Don't waste your money here! You will get much better food and service at Taco Bell across the street.,UNK
2426,The food was very good!! Everything we ordered was tasty. The service was excellent! Highly recommend this place.,UNK
2427,It's a bar in Caesars Palace - opens late so handy for drinks! not much else to say really!,UNK
2428,"We were pleasantly surprised by the cleanliness and great service. The hot salsa lived up to its reputation, but the chips left much to be desired. Unfortunately, the entrees were rather bland and we probably won't be back.",UNK
2429,"Great food, great happy hour specials, nice waitstaff.",UNK
2430,Awful does not begin to describe this clip joint.  Awful service and the food was about on par with a Dennys.  Somehow this place has managed to stay in business. I'll never be back again.  If you want good Italian in Vegas skip this place.,UNK
2431,Fast service! iPhone users check here first before you count you give up on your phone! They replaced the screen for $96.,UNK
2432,Yummy truffle fries!,UNK
2433,"Wow what a great little spot. Crepes were ridiculously good. Omelette was great too.  I think I finished two other peoples plates, ha.\n\nOnly downside: no credit cards, cash only!",UNK
2434,Great place to have drinks since I haven't been able to try the food yet.But the friendly staff is always making sure your OK and pouring nice drinks. \n   Not many sports bars in our neighborhood but Times 3 Just made things a whole lot better!,UNK
2435,"Nice people, nice place, good food.  A little stale smoke smell from the bar.",UNK
2436,"Great experience, food was excellent.  Vita our server was knowledgable and her suggestions were spot on. Will go back",UNK
2437,"Love the pizza and wings! Honey hot and the teriyaki wings are my favorite. Friendly service every time you go in, and good delivery service! One of the best pizza spots in the area! They usually have specials too, so I always ask before I order.",UNK
2438,My mother and I stopped in to price out rings for her 30th anniversary gift. We were greeted upon walking in and offered water or a cappucino. The customer service was excellent and the salespeople were really nice. If I am ever needing to buy jewelry I'll definitely come back again!,UNK
2439,Bun Bo Hue.... that is all I have to say. You don't always find bun bo hue with that much flavor but this place has it all. I'll be back for sure,UNK
2440,Good atmosphere but poor TV placement and slow unattentive service made this first visit to Blue 32 disappointing.  Probably won't be back.,UNK
2441,Bad coffee.  No excuse for breakfast place.  Weak and not hot.  Food was just okay and very pricey.,UNK
2442,Service is not always great here but the food is consistently delicious. Love the veggie burger. Fresh made sauces and all organic make this place good for your body as well. Best time to go is for lunch. Service sadly decreases at dinner.,UNK
2443,"One of my favourite bars in montreal, outstanding selection, great staff, awesome beer, great little beer garden and the revelation that is pulled pork poutine!! I really cannot find any fault, go there!",UNK
2444,Dont Go here... These people violate human rights!!,UNK
2445,Service wasn't that great and the food was just mediocre. I haven't been inside this casino since it opened until now. My bf wasn't impressed with his meal and we had it comped off.,UNK
2446,Had the best time only bad thing but not really is only T.G.I.F does room service.,UNK
2447,I thought the pizza was a little too oily. It wasn't bad though.,UNK
2448,We paid a $20 premium per person to skip the fucking line and are still waiting after an hour in line.  Don't give a fuck how good food is not coming back,UNK
2449,The food is very good. The service is beyond horrible!  Such a shame would love to go back but just can't handle the terrible service,UNK
2450,"This hotel is a great value!  Very clean, nice staff, very accommodating, and they keep their pool area open all night!",UNK
2451,"No happy hour specials on the patio. 9\"" Cheese pizza -$11.60. Almost rotten Hopalicious, $5. Potentially rabid squirrelzipping around under your feet - $0.00. No vodka in my first drink- c'mon, really?",UNK
2452,Overrated. Took over 30 minutes to get fajitas. No desire to return,UNK
2453,"Earl of Sandwich is a good spot for a quick bite at all times of the day. The sandwich and the price were on point, but I don't think it lived up to the hype.",UNK
2454,I love this store. It is adorable and you are able to pick up some unique pieces. The staff is friendly and I enjoyed stopping in.,UNK
2455,www.bigtsreivews.com,UNK
2456,"Just went for sushi. Superman roll was good. Overall I would prefer Pisces or Ru Sans, but this place was nearby and it did the job. Service was also good although it wasn't busy at the time.",UNK
2457,"The yummiest Indian Food i have ever tried in the Town .. Specially try their Indo Chinese dishes.. Great food, Nice restaurant and awesome hospitality.. Not like other typical Indian Restaurant in the town..",UNK
2458,This is my first experience with East Indian food. The price is hard to argue with. The selection of foods is pretty limited but also pretty tasty. I liked it.,UNK
2459,"Very bad purchase experience. I bought a shirt with a hole covered in the rolled up sleeves, but they denied my request to return it. I am so angery at this and will never shop their chothes anymore.",UNK
2460,BLEH!!!!!!!!,UNK
2461,Sadly the food has decreased in quality since my last review. I thought it was a fluke the last time I was here but it seems to be true. Unfortunately I think the decrease in business has led to the decrease in quality of food and this cycle is very hard to break out of.,UNK
2462,"The longhorn burger was great, and the shoestring fries were nice and crispy. Best part of the meal was the shake, Had the oreo shake which was great.",UNK
2463,"Customer service is ridiculous!!' Found a strand of hair in their dosa, and the guy said \""since you've already eaten it, I'm sorry, I cannot do anything!\"" Never visiting this place again!!!",UNK
2464,"Closed at 3:00 on a Saturday afternoon, what's up with that? No hours posted in the window. I would suggest that you call ahead before coming over.",UNK
2465,"Food is good, atmosphere is non existent and the chairs are really uncomfortable.  Better to take out than to eat in.",UNK
2466,Walked by today and noticed the windows were covered with kraft paper. There were summons taped to the doors. By the looks of it the bank has forced them to cease operation and close the business.,UNK
2467,"Bought a groupon for 2 at lunch, great value. The food was great,  they had seafood favs and a crepe station. Service was very pleasent. I would recommend as one of the better buffets on the strip",UNK
2468,I have seen every Cirque show on the strip and this was my least favorite.   There was no story line to follow and absolutely no element of surprise which I always find in Cirque show.   This show was basically consist of old tricks from other shows strung together and quite boring.,UNK
2469,"I'm picky about restaurants, so it takes a lot for me to recommend one. I didn't like the food here and wouldn't go again.",UNK
2470,This place is fantastic.  Really great food and has a homey ambiance.  Great meal here which didn't break the bank considering it really could have with all of it's exclusivity.,UNK
2471,Fun place for older kids. 9 and up. I didn't feel comfortable having my 3 years old there.,UNK
2472,"Cesar salad not good. It's stale lettuce and a bit bitter. Fish and chips is a good choice. The fish is large and so are those potato wedges. Decor is pretty classic, but I think it's a bit too dim.",UNK
2473,Good burger and fish. Got my free Burger for my blood donation in August. Clean place with friendly staff.,UNK
2474,Mainly use drive thru at this location and for the most part they are usually fairly quick and get your order right. Average location.,UNK
2475,"The staff here are always cheerful, friendly and helpful -- even when the place is crawling with people.  The prices are no worse than anywhere else and they have a fantastic stock of kits on the shelves and put together as examples.",UNK
2476,Good place after night work to relax a little bit and drink a hot drink in the Winter. Feel warmed and satisfied.,UNK
2477,Love the chicken broccoli w cheese yumm,UNK
2478,Great Beer selection and decent food.,UNK
2479,"An odd mix of Mexican and Irish food, none of which is very good.  However, there are all you can drink drinks (also not very good, but containing alcohol).\n\nReally not my first choice, or second, even at the Rio.",UNK
2480,Great service and food! We had a groupon and this did not affect our service which I have found at times can! overall great experience!,UNK
2481,"Decent drink prices($8.50 for jack and coke), really attractive go-go dancers and blackjack dealers right in the bar!  Is this heaven? No, it's lucky bar.",UNK
2482,"Good product, well worth it for the money",UNK
2483,"Iconic spot in Madison. If you're visiting, and it's between April and October, you must go here.",UNK
2484,"An okay breakfast diner, but nothing to be excited about.  The decor, however, is annoying and not at all conducive to relaxing and enjoying the meal.  Much too much fake nostalgia.",UNK
2485,"My favorite Coffee Plantation, although I miss the one at the Biltmore!! Coffee is way better than Starbucks!! For a great local coffee place, come here!!",UNK
2486,First time it was a great experience Erica was very nice professional!,UNK
2487,"We came here only as last resort. Our experience really confirmed all the negative reviews online. The food is mediocre at best, HORRIBLE service. And best of all, tips are automatically included, so you can't even voice your discontent. Never again.",UNK
2488,"This cafe rio is the worst I've been to. The workers are rude & the rice was just so dry, we had to pick out the driest grains.",UNK
2489,There aren't very many stores opened here anymore...dissapointed,UNK
2490,This restaurant is closed.  It sounds like it wasn't soon enough!,UNK
2491,"Great place,  Family friendly.  Loved the dinning room with the waterfall.  Had an excellent selection for its buffet. Customer service was friendly.  For Marriott rewards member, buffet was included unlike the Desert Ridge which nickled and dimed you on everything.",UNK
2492,"TSA Pre rocks here. Usually no line and very friendly folks. The main terminal is well laid out. Baggage claim can be a bit daunting after a long flight with all the \""Vegas Baby\"" lights. Overall one of the best small airports.",UNK
2493,"Great atmosphere, drinks very expensive for the size of them and the food was not up to what the reviews said. You get. 15% off of the tab for being in the industry which was nice and might have me going back.",UNK
2494,"= = = = = =  CLOSED!  = = = = = =\n\nSadly, this nice Sweet Tomatoes has closed.     :-(",UNK
2495,"Great, fast option in downtown Mesa. They have unique non-alcoholic drink options and the chimichangas are amazing. There are a few patio tables that offer nice views of the downtown area.",UNK
2496,"Beautiful place! This cafe never disappoints. Breakfast burrito is gigantic and can be shared due to the large portions. \""The\"" apple fritter is a MUST TRY!",UNK
2497,"This location is a joke.   10:30am on a Saturday and out of all decent savory bagels to make a sandwich, line nearly to the door and barely moving, fountain machine not working, and less than friendly service.   I will make sure to choose a different location next time!",UNK
2498,"Kent Brown prepares a great menu for pressers on the 8th floor.  From the holiday meal to the fajitas its all top notch, i recommend the meatloaf.",UNK
2499,We've been bringing our Scottie & our long coated Shih Tzu here for awhile now. They always do a wonderful job & my dogs look great! Thank you Lone Mountain!!!,UNK
2500,"bad company, sometimes good but mostly bad. have ask for pickup of some palm fronds from a tree trimming and they promised twice to pick up after the original trash day service missed them. they are still in the driveway.",UNK
2501,Pretty good  breakfast food - liked the meat lovers scramble. Not too greasy for what it was.,UNK
2502,"This 7-Eleven is on my way to work. I have stopped in a couple of times to get a Red Bull or other convenience item. It's in a pretty bad neighborhood, and I always feel kinda scared going in.",UNK
2503,The combo sandwich is awesome! The bacon barbecue burger is very good. I've been here a few times now and have had a great meal with good service every time.,UNK
2504,"An amazing little gem in downtown Middleton.  You're always met with a smile and a case full of delicious, pretty, locally focused treats!  You feel like you're in a cool grandmas kitchen...love Bloom!",UNK
2505,"Not impressed, over $200 for a RENTAL? And it has to be back the day after the event no matter what or it's an additional $20 per day.  It would have been cheaper to buy the dumb things. Never again",UNK
2506,We had crab and arugala salad and mahi mahi with cilanto lime slaw.   The food was good apart from the Mahi Mahi being a little overcooked for my taste.,UNK
2507,"My son and I had lunch here today, we had the Manhattan pizza. Flavor was good but nothing special. Above average for a little neighborhood pizza place. \nService was also a little better than expected. The guy behind the counter was very polite and attentive.",UNK
2508,"Pros: Clean, Friendly Staff\nCons: Where's the holiday dog clothes?!?!?",UNK
2509,not much attraction here other than be in old Vegas. rooms are old but can't expect much for anything in old Vegas. good place if you're trying to save so money,UNK
2510,Best sushi in town. Service is amazing and food is great. I would recommend this spot to a lot of people.,UNK
2511,"Closed for the week the day before Thanksgiving...you have got to be kidding me. Next stop, guru palace. I check it out eventually.",UNK
2512,Always had a good experience. This is three only mexican restaurant I've been to that actually season their food.,UNK
2513,This is a good spot to come to just to get a drink since it's not that crowded.  My bf and I stopped here on a Saturday night.  The bartender was laid back yet prompt.\n\nIt's primarily a burger place.  We only had drinks here.,UNK
2514,"Ate here for the first time, very impressed, let the chef chose and we were very pleased with the taste, selection and presentation.  Will be back!",UNK
2515,"Great dumplings and noodles and friendly staff.\nLast time we were there we had red bean paste and egg custard dumplings, both delicious.\n\nIt's difficult to find good Chinese food in Madison, so I am happy I found this place!",UNK
2516,"I will echo what all the others have said.  This is great food, great value & made with love.  Had the fresh spring rolls, drunken noodles & green tea ice cream.  WOW! what a meal.",UNK
2517,"Very poor quality meat, not authentic, bad flavor. AVOID",UNK
2518,get rid of the fries on the sandwiches and put the toppings on that i ordered,UNK
2519,The friendliness factor needs a lot of work as well as just having manners.   Also many display windows were dirty.\nStill a beautiful museum but hire friendlier more mature minded employees.,UNK
2520,"Noisey, limited atmosphere",UNK
2521,Chicken was cold on aloha plate for takeout. Lunch portions are too small. Mac Salad is good though. Price doesn't justify quality and taste. Moki's in mesa is worth the drive/time if you're going to spend money.,UNK
2522,"Not impressed - the water was unfiltered, the food was not authentic or good and the service was not attentive.",UNK
2523,Fast & Friendly.  Fresh sushi and it is excellent.  They always give me more food!,UNK
2524,"The food at Hawk's is shockingly mediocre.  Except for the chili, which I really, really like, everything is about as bland and unappetizing as can be.  I would give three stars but they just hiked their prices up, so two it is.",UNK
2525,Great good great service. We took are 3 young children there tonight. The customer service was top notch.Waitress help led my children there steak while by wife was busy with our 1 old. Manager came over a few times to entertain them. It just made eating out with the kids more enjoyable,UNK
2526,The raspberry pomegranate was my favorite of the 3 I tried. Clean and friendly atmosphere otherwise.,UNK
2527,Great sub shop. The food is really good and fresh. Definitely a great place to go whenever you have the urge for a sub sandwich.,UNK
2528,I'm surprised this place has such great reviews. I thought their rolls lacked lots of flavor and the fish was not fresh at all.,UNK
2529,"This is another fun free hotel show on the strip, like the nearby Sirens of TI and fountains at Bellagio. The volcano erupts, shooting flames in the air and \""lava\"" erupts and flows down the mountain to drum beats.",UNK
2530,Food took almost 2 hours to come out and when we got our food it was cold!\nwaitress was rude the one by chandler mall is so much better will drive the extra miles to get better service and hot food!,UNK
2531,"I ordered take out and watched my food sit in the window ignored.  While people who arrived after me eat.   Hhhmmmm, this is not cool.  Kinda wish I could take my tip back.",UNK

2533,love this place!,UNK
2534,I love rice and ate some many different forms of it during my life time. Komex has one of the best rices i have ever tasted. Reasonable prices is a plus too..,UNK
2535,"This store is full of that cheap, cutesy, country crap.  It's all made in China and then astronomically overpriced by these ladies.  The sales staff was uppity and rude. \n\nYou can get this junk on ebay for half the price.",UNK
2536,Any Yelper that gave this place more than 3 stars must either work their or be friends with somebody that works there.  TERRIBLE.,UNK
2537,"Everything is over the top huge, and battered. Really greasy. \nI wouldn't go here again. Dissappointed.",UNK
2538,A quick stop and the food is very good. We would have ate lunch and dinner in this place if Vegas did not have so many other options. The staff was excellent and very accommodating.\n\nVisited August 2014,UNK
2539,"I was thirsty and decided to get a drink.  McDonald's is the best place to get something cheap, especially when you're on the strip.",UNK
2540,"Not a big Starbucks fan, don't go often, but usually have friendly staff. This was an exception. The young man that was making the beverages was grumpy at best both with me and the other young man working. The drinks were fine but not used to this type of attitude.",UNK
2541,Unfortunately overpriced for the quality of the food. I feel like you could have the same items at another restaurant that is less stuffy and old-school than this place.,UNK
2542,"Nasty and cold. If you're not ordering pizza that has been sitting under the heater for awhile, then you'll be waiting for quite some time to receive your order. My mistake of ordering pizza that has been sitting for too long because it was gross.",UNK
2543,Sometimes you just want a big slice of pizza and sometimes it can't be kept a secret.,UNK
2544,"Pretty Ok food. I ordered Kung Pao chicken, it really didnt have that much chicken but it had a great flavor. Also order Egg fried rice and that was good too.",UNK

2546,"The wait was too long. I think any local such as I, will agree that bachi burger is way better and way cheaper as far as fancy burgers go that is. Food isnt bad but just not worth the money and the experience.",UNK
2547,"The portions are small, taste was average, and the price was expensive. Tasted better in downtown for way less the cost. 4 people cost over $150 and we left hungry!",UNK
2548,Crap food.,UNK
2549,"Excellent decore. Only Wynn and Encore have remained my best favorite hotels to stay,  favorite second would be city center complexes.\n\nInterior is lavish and rooms are well designed. \n\nI Prefere encore rooms over Wynn, more my style.",UNK
2550,The atmosphere and the service were both very good. The food would be very good if it were not **extremely salty** :(,UNK
2551,"Food was good, however this Is primarily an outdoor seating place and for some reason they allow smoking at the outdoor bar.  It is a problem.  If smoking bothers you avoid this place.",UNK
2552,"I absolutely love the International terminal.  It's clean, spacious, and security moves quite fast.  I am usually used to the long, crazy lines at SFO, and this was a really great place to take an international flight.  The bonus are the slot machines while you wait!",UNK
2553,"We love it here!  Love the coffee.  I really appreciate getting a mug instead of a to-go cup.  The oatmeal w ginger, blueberry, and almond is lovely.  Today's lentil stew was perfect. \nWe will be back and back and back.",UNK
2554,gotta love the smell of leather,UNK
2555,Disappointed.   Looking for tumeric root.  Had it but all was moldy.  And the place smells ptetty bad.,UNK
2556,Love it here. Classic Filipino cuisine. ok service average decor. Good star rating for its quality of food.,UNK
2557,Don't eat or drink here. Rooms okay but noisy. Parking scary. Bar and restaurant prices and service ridiculous. Wander to find better anywhere but here. Embarassed to think this represents Arizona for visitors.,UNK
2558,"Haven't tried their pizza yet but I do love the pasta shells and meatball.  The side order is big enough for a meal for one. The atmosphere is casual, open, and airy. The staff is friendly and the location is ideal; near movie theater and shopping.",UNK
2559,Nice that they are 24hrs but me and my bf were the only late night customers and the waitress still messed up the order. Bathroom was very dirty!,UNK
2560,Food is too expensive. The quality is too cheap and poorly prepared to justify the outrageous prices. The staff will likely ignore you until they feel like doing their jobs. The worst Panda Express I've ever been to.,UNK
2561,BEST PLACE EVER. Service was amazing!! and the food was even better! Great prices! We went on a bachelorette night and the bride got a free drink!  going back asap,UNK
2562,Disappointed. Nothing stood out. The deserts were okay. I honestly expected more !,UNK
2563,"Ordered a Gilled Italian with \""NO Tomatoes\"" to go as a suggestion from one of 8 people behind the counter. Didn't realize till I got home it was something totally different.  Food is just so-so.  I prefer paradise I think.",UNK
2564,Food were ok.  Nothing to brag about.  Service was a bit hard to get.  Typical Asian service I guess.,UNK
2565,Four star food. Three star price and 3 star service. Too much upselling. Grilled Octopus rocks but don't order too much...,UNK
2566,"Food's not bad, but not great. Very loud music. Service is lacking. And tonight they were out of the draft special and had no buns, so burgers were being served on white bread. Really.",UNK
2567,"- Place seems to be in need of renovations, just kinda run down compared to the Venetian's convention center which seems to be better maintained.\n- Otherwise it's an a-ok convention center with $10/day (with in/out privileges) parking.",UNK
2568,3.5 stars mainly due to the view.  I think the view is all the Ghost Bar has going for it.   \n\nI would say it's definitely a place to go at least once to check out...but it's not a place that I would frequent.,UNK
2569,You must order 3 or more business days in advance or pay $7 fee to expidite\n\nAlso you can go to any branch  not just this one,UNK
2570,The service was slow and I was shocked that they didn't serve any fish. The fish of the day was shirmp and spinich. Now how can they claim to be cajun and not serve any fried fish or have any crystals hot sauce?,UNK
2571,The most low-rent taco bell i ever been to,UNK
2572,Crappy service. Came in to order one sandwich. Told me 30 min wait because they are in middle of a big order.  Employees goofing off while making sandwiches. Should have one person working counter orders.,UNK
2573,Would have been a four star review except for the waiter Arnold who seems to think high pressure waiting is acceptable. Even after we told him we were in a rush he kept us waiting for over fifteen minutes before asking if we wanted dessert. He was too busy chatting with co workers. AVOID!!,UNK
2574,Consistent food and service.  The new red velvet pancakes were surprisingly better then anticipated.,UNK
2575,Pretty standards as Quik Trips go.,UNK
2576,Website hours don't match the actual store hours. Call before you go to make sure they are even open. 2nd visit and 2nd disappointment.,UNK
2577,"Great chicken fried steak.  I'm a coffee lover and I salute business that leave a carafe on your table! \nGreat service @ 2300,left full & happy!",UNK
2578,I was a total klutz and spilled my drink all over the floor in the checkout of Vons. They were super kind and replaced it at no charge!,UNK
2579,"Quick friendly service.  These guys actually want you to get the cheapest price with the best coverage.  Imagine that, from an insurance person?",UNK
2580,I like to check out the after holiday deals. Sometimes you find a winner. pricing isn't any better than the other guys,UNK
2581,"Great place to smoke a cigar and unwind. A poker table in the back lounge is nicely placed feet away from the humidor. The TVs always have sports on with a great crowd to smoke with! Cigars, humidors and accessories are all available.",UNK

2586,Tailoring - good\nCustomer Service - unimpressed,UNK
2587,"Just went here today for the first time.  Nice, clean, well lit, spacious dining experience.  Bloody Mary was good, and the pesto pasta was tasty and very fresh.  Also, nice clean personal restrooms, with nice scented soap!  Thanks!",UNK
2588,major  rip off do not go went through it in 45 minutes waste of 30 dollars wasn't even scary big waste of money go someplace  sucks!,UNK
2589,I keep giving the Grand Cafe a second chance and then I keep regretting it. The service is incredibly slow and the food is only mediocre.,UNK
2590,"Food is okay for the price, we figured to give it a try with all the great reviews and recommendations. Do not come in for brunch because the selection is rather limited. We'll probably try the dinner selection eventually and find out if this place is worth coming back to.",UNK
2591,"80's called. They want their electronics back. Staff was friendly though, this is just really outdated.",UNK
2592,Very nice place the misters outside really helped make it cool. The food was good not very much seasoning but overall it was good.,UNK
2593,"Fantastic variety of scrumptious crepes and warm friendly service.  Reminiscent of cafes in Europe.  Sometimes there is a small wait for your order, but it's not fast food (nor do we want that)!",UNK
2594,"I've been here a few times and each time, my alterations have taken longer than quoted and without notice, and the service I have gotten is more-or-less rude. I have also had things measured on me there ahead of time which still did not fit properly after being altered.",UNK
2595,This is a place you have to go to if you're having a late night in downtown.  Everything is always delicious.,UNK
2596,"Caught them before closing time, being generous with 2 stars regardless the tacos were mediocre at best.",UNK
2597,"bleh! this place is over rated! too big on size but lacking in taste. if u want BIG serving then its a good place to go, but im a person who go after the quality not quantity. :( sorry i",UNK
2598,Great food but the service is so bad it's almost funny. ALMOST. I don't know of it's worth waiting for my food and having to ask constantly for refills. I would try it once but I don't recommend coming back for seconds.,UNK

2601,The usual Del Taco...inside and out.  Fast and efficient service.  A good location.  Del Taco has amazing and cheaper food...try it!,UNK
2602,Just happened to be driving by and thought is stop for lunch. Got the Kung Pao chicken and asked them for extra spicy. Amazing!!!! So good and my mouth is on fire!!! Will definitely be coming back.,UNK
2603,uhm i get that im in vegas and things cost more...but ROFL WOW. theres a reasonable point in paying for something. \n\nto be dramatic...its like paying 10$ for a piece of gum.,UNK
2604,This place is a true gem in Vegas!  Definitely make a trip north to enjoy the history of this town through these fantastic Neon signs.  The staff is extremely knowledgeable and you will leave with a new appreciation for Sin City!,UNK
2605,"this place isnt bad but its not really good either. (food wise)\n\nThey have dim sum all day, and the prices are cheap so that is good.\n\nBut i won't come here again. Straight up.",UNK
2606,"Bought some fresh bagels, made straight from the machine. They were fresh, moist sesame bagels. Opted for the standard cream cheese even though they have a variety of spreads. Very tasty and this place deserves another visit as they had a cute bistro setting in their back yard.",UNK
2607,"I like CJ's. The booze is cheap, the patrons are friendly, the bartenders don't act like they're doing you a favor selling you a drink. If you're hungry there is a kitchen with cheap and better than average eats. Check it out.",UNK

2614,I thought I'd deviate from the normal visit of In & Out Burger. The food is nothing to rave about. The burger was the typical burger and I was impressed with the smash fries.,UNK
2615,"Love this store! \nI wish they had the raincoat i wanted in my size...it was on sale and Sooooo cute! alas, it was not to be. \nBut definitely worth a visit to check out the cute clothes and accessories",UNK
2616,Milkshake was awesome!  Try the dulce de leche. It was the perfect combo of sweet and a little bit of caramel saltiness.  Burger was flavorful too. Adding the caramelized onions and cheese was the way to go.,UNK
2617,"Good Irish breakfast.  Even though this is chain, there are staff from Erin who are happy to serve you.  The Guinness is good and the craic is better when with friends.  Only complaint is that I think they deep fry the white and black pudding which is a no-no...",UNK
2618,Uhh what happened here? Ordered orange chicken under new management. Horrible. Bring back the old recipe fast.,UNK

2629,"Not as many screaming kids as I thought there would be.  Only two things I felt were worth mentioning, the mac and cheese pizza and the cinnamon sticks, otherwise ok food. Not bad for the price tag.",UNK
2630,Some sections seem to be plagued at not being able to be kept up. Items can't be kept stocked. Shelves can't be kept straightened up. It's like they don't have pride in that department. This has been a ongoing issue in the shoe department for sometime.,UNK
2631,Free wifi if your smoking cigars.\nThe beer is cold and the prices are very reasonable.\nFreaky behind the bar is awesome,UNK
2632,"they have amazing chili.\n\nsadly, their staff sucks and i waited 30 minutes for my sprite.\n\nlame.",UNK

2635,"Maybe fun if you're here for shots late at night. Came here for lunch, had to ask for different lines twice as they were all brown and dried out. Nachos were dried out and chewy with processed nacho cheese. Sent it back",UNK
2636,"Really loved my tuna tartar, and the organic green salad. Between the two appetizers and an iced tea, that made the PERFECT lunch.",UNK
2637,Place is full and long lines; however you can pay $5 and get in the front and a free house shot. Drinks are inexpensive and really good! Lots of pool tables and great environment. One of my select places I love to go when on Mill.,UNK

2645,Horrible experience Don't stay at this hotel! \nFront desk manager is terrible Clarissa,UNK

2651,"Horrible service. Wouldn't give me what I was asking for for no reason, they lost out on the money they would have made from me. Don't go there.",UNK
2652,This place has awful food.  Every dish was so salty we could not eat it.  The appetizer (calamari) was also too salty to eat.  We will never go back again.,UNK
2653,My husband and I went here for the first time. It was a good and classy crowd. There wasn't many topless ladies which was a pleasant surprise for me. Great dj and really good drinks. Girls are free to get in but guys are 30$.,UNK
2654,BEST thai food I have ever had! Love the family run restaurant!,UNK
2655,"Ugh, not only was the food cold and too salty and greasy, but I then got food poisoning that night.  Never going here again.  Worst restaurant in Shadyside.",UNK

2661,"As a native New Yorker, good pizza is hard to come by in the QC, but Tonys really comes pretty close.... If you are into their oversized slices, or taking home a pie, the pizza is great.  The wings are really good too!",UNK
2662,"Okay for $40 you can eat all you can within a span of 24hours.  I tried one weekend and was never hungry.  I do have to mention that you do get tired of prime rib, crab legs and shrimp.",UNK
2663,These guys are great!  This is the go to place if you have knives that need sharpening or reconditioning and they do it at a ridiculously low price.  And they can usually do it on the spot while you wait too.  Recommended.,UNK
2664,"I drove really far to get to this place and eat. I arrived ten minutes to closing time. The cashier told me they were \""closed\"" because they had a slow night.\n\nThis makes no sense to me. They are slow so they reject a customer?",UNK
2665,"Nope, not buying it... Non japanese sushi joint with large screen tv playing hip hop music video... Why???? Nice interior though. I usually don't like to give negative reviews... but this wasn't my place (sorry).",UNK
2666,"When a place is so popular they don't need to give a shit about customers to get business.. they still should.  That's just business ethics. \n\nI'll spare you the details of my experience.  suffice to say, very rude.",UNK

2671,Can't believe they sell nazi items here.  Will never be back as well as their customer service and knowledge was  very poor.,UNK
2672,I've been coming here off & on over the years always the best service! Clean friendly & great mani/pedis!  The owners always remember my name & greet me each time.  Staff is consistent & been there very long term.,UNK
2673,The staff was really nice but honestly for the price and quality I'd rather just go to the grocery store and get a quart of ice cream. I remember when this place was one of the only and better ice cream places in town...not anymore!,UNK
2674,Too expensive for pre-packaged salads.,UNK
2675,After reading all posted reviews can't wait to try this place out.  I am a very picky eater so stand by for my review after a taste the food from Pita Kitchen Grill.,UNK
2676,"An excellent place for any occasion. Besides the great entrees, grilled artichoke was awesome. Angelo was on top of his game with excellent service and recommendations.",UNK

2681,"Pretty good food here, but the service is a little slow. I still recommend eating here if you handle the slow service.",UNK

2693,So much for that groupon. Tried to go there today only to find the doors closed and tables gone.,UNK
2694,Equipment is not well maintained. Pads are wearing out and not replaced on a fair amount of the machines..  No attention to oiling machines.  Place is not especially clean.  Not enough lockers.   Cardio cinema is a complete waste of space.,UNK
2695,"Definitely not a good place to eat with friends, especially on a budget. There are cheaper and better Lebanese food out there. You are paying for over priced food and lack of service.",UNK

2700,Worst flower experience ever. This place had very little options and the worker was extremely rude over the phone and in person. I will not be going back to this florist.,UNK

2720,Can you say delicious!? Service was good. Food was amazing.  Loved the atmosphere ! Who doesn't ? It's Vegas!!!!!,UNK
2721,Not competitive. The grocery stores and Lees all have lower prices. It is a shame.,UNK
2722,"The foie gras with truffle oil was excellent.  The caviar was pretty expensive, because it's super small, like one tiny little bite costs around $30.   I would like to try the smoke salmon appetizer next time.",UNK
2723,"Very good double steak burger and I must say the fries were really good, food was still hot when I got home!",UNK
2724,"Great Schtick, as a previous reviewer wrote. I don't remember much about the food, frankly (I seem to remember enjoying the onion rings) so it probably wasn't fantastic. But the experience of eating made the visit worth it.",UNK
2725,"Went in for breakfast burritos after a big night out. Aside from my burrito leaking some sort of sauce on my pants, it was fine. Nothing great, but not bad. Did the trick and under $10.",UNK
2726,"Eating at Durant's is a great experience. You feel like you're in a mafia film because of its history and decor. The food was excellent, service was excellent, and the overall experience was excellent.",UNK
2727,It was my first time to eat here and thought it was a nice little pizza place.  They cook the pizzas in a big ceramic open fire oven. I enjoyed the pepperoni pizza and the margarita pizza.,UNK
2728,Great ambiance and great new Mexican cuisine.  The fajitas are great and the Silver Coin Margs are super good.  For a fun night with friends this is the place.,UNK
2729,Very nice arena! I'm only used to going to Warriors' games at the Oracle but i think this was a great facility. Also helped that the Bobcats won their season opener!,UNK
2730,"This is a good location with speedy service, the only reason that this is not a five star review is because some of their employees are not up to par. The cost of the food to the amount that you get is great for your value. I can get out of there for less than $7.",UNK
2731,"Love love love Maggianos! The service is always fantastic, the food is even better, and the drinks never disappoint. The patio has a nice little view of the Wynn and the strip. Maggianos never disappoints!",UNK
2732,Love the chicken fried rice on the spicy side.  The manager here at this location is awesome she runs a good crew. Stop by if you have a chance it's worth it.,UNK

2734,"Fabulous neighborhood yoga studio, friendly and experienced staff, a wonderful place to roll out your mat.",UNK

2736,Really!? Lion burgers? You should be ashamed of yourself!,UNK
2737,Went to this place after a round of golf.  First time in Scottsdale area and glad I stopped by.  Good beer and fine waitresses yet the food wasn't the best.  Good place to catch the games at but wouldn't eat there,UNK
2738,Everything LOOKED fun..Its all broken. Anything worth a damn is out of order. Waste of time.,UNK
2739,Best almond croissant ever! Everything looks so good. Can't wait to return to Montreal to have another.  At least as good as any bakery I've visited in Paris..wish there was one in Ottawa,UNK

2742,"Great customer service, great food at a great price.",UNK
2743,"Atmosphere is really fun, down side was the martinis. For a martini bar, they suck, not tasty at all",UNK
2744,The service was so over the top rude I was laughing. Macarons.....just ok. Get over yourself.,UNK
2745,"Decent food - IF  you can Spanglish your way through ordering, and IF you actually get what you ordered. Management is POOR... don't expect a refund if they mess up your to-go order. COMPRENDE???",UNK

2747,Epicly Awesome!  Great Food!  Awesome Staff!  I love this place!,UNK
2748,The shrimp burger.....WOW!!!!! amazing,UNK
2749,Every interaction with employees was terrible. $15 Wells. Horrible DJ. Only thing that saved our night was leaving and hitting up chateau. Avoid unless you have free entry AND drinks...free cover alone is not reason enough to waste your Vegas evening.,UNK
2750,"Bungalow turned cozy, cool neighborhood restaurant with fantastic outdoor dining and intimate indoor spaces.  Pizza is amazing.",UNK
2751,"good waitress, but the food was definitely average.....and very limited sides with meal....on the other hand , very reasonable prices, and very nice attractive casino.",UNK

2754,"Dr. Frye is great, but the office/staff is the worse ever! They don't care at all. Sad the money we pay and the lack of servuce we don't receive! Don't watse your time or money here.\ns",UNK
2755,stopped in for lunch to go. the waitress recommended the chicken sandwich. pretty much the worst chicken sandwich ever. won't be back. to bad as i love to support local businesses.,UNK
2756,Was excited when I moved here from Vegas to find a Macayos.  Easily the best smooth salsa around.  I will say while they get four stars for the salsa I prefer the food of the restaurants overall in Vegas.  Menus are slightly different here in AZ.,UNK
2757,"Unoriginal, bland and boring.Review is for Joey, not the pie. Did not want to try after talking with this guy. Congratulations Joey!!! You are a 1 star human being. Off to Grimaldi's.",UNK
2758,"Good place to eat or get a beer for happy hour. They have many classic Irish dishes, burgers, and sandwiches. Sweet potato fries are quite tasty. Nice location right on Mill Avenue with patio.",UNK
2759,Really good vegetarian food. The spicy po boy is delicious and so are the chilli fries!,UNK
2760,My experience has been luke warm. I was recently there and left due to price. I have not found the people I dealt with to be warm. The services are always good.,UNK

2762,I have to give it 5 stars since I came in looking for something specific for Halloween and they had it. Even in the color I wanted. I am stoked. Another great visit!!,UNK
2763,"Unfortunetly, this wonderful store is now closed. Stocked a wide array of sizes from all different decades at FAIR prices! Really a triple-threat in the way of vintage stores.",UNK
2764,Fantastic salads and sandwiches. Have not tried the pizza YET  The service is always excellent! Tell your friends.,UNK
2765,"Excellent food, drinks, service, and ambience. I have not been let down by a dish yet. If you've never been here, I'd highly recommend that you try it. You won't be disappointed.",UNK
2766,I had the spicy schezuan noodle bowl and it was great.,UNK
2767,"Delicious, not earth shattering. Potbelly is better. However, in a sea of overpriced and mediocre food options, this place is well-priced - cheap, even! - and thus a standout.",UNK
2768,The beef noodle soup is huge. Decent place for a quick Chinese food fix. \nSteam pork dumplings are legit.\n\nTheir super size boba is also huge.,UNK
2769,Full flavor and Kambucha Ginger beer.  Son had the Garlic Crab Noodles and I had the Chicken Mole...flavor explosion.  Started with the Dried Fruit Guacamole...so good.,UNK
2770,Amazing service and food. I dine there minimum 2 times a week. Excellent service all the time and the environment is very warm and welcoming. Their food is excellent.,UNK
2771,"Found a few neat things at decent prices, but honestly LOTS of way overpriced things. We know the value of blown glass. If there isn't a sticker or stamp proving it's Murano, it shouldn't be sold for Murano prices.",UNK
2772,I went by today and found this place has permanently closed.  Another independent goes down.  So sad.,UNK
2773,Watch the signs for rental car return it is a little confusing.Took me 40 minutes to get from Hyatt place airport to rental car returns.,UNK

2775,"The food here is delicious !!!! Maybe even better then lindo michoacan !! It's the same prices as them plus they make their tortillas fresh !! My new favorite spot ! & the service is great, very attentive.",UNK
2776,"A very fun place! Great Drag Queens, good DJ and good vibe. Bonus- there was no cover the night I went(Sunday).",UNK
2777,Glen is an expert in electrical work. I like his great attitude and follow through. I think he can do anything you need both residential and business and would trust him with my home.,UNK
2778,Good food. I liked the Chicken Marsala but the prices could be better. There is a kid working their that looks like Jonah Hill/Seth from Super Bad - with a white boy fro and all! That made only OK service a little better!,UNK
2779,"Solid dogs, ESP if you are a dog fanatic. Gravy Fries are awesome. I have lunch here everyday I am in Pittsburgh. Much better than Franktuary.",UNK
2780,Decent club...i thot the music selection wasn't that great. Interiors were ok i guess.,UNK
2781,Found out at home our to go order was not what we ordered. Called in and asked to speak with mgr. Manager was too busy to take our call and they asked to return our call which never happened. Food is good but service is not.,UNK
2782,The employees here always have such great attitudes I would come here just for the service if the the burgers weren't so amazing,UNK

2787,This place is awesome!  I have eaten at lots of Chinese places and this place is great and reasonable.,UNK
2788,"Great hotel for the price the service was awesome the rooms were clean and spacious ,the staff was very helpful and friendly. Also no pet fee I would definitely recommend this hotel . A 5 min car ride to the strip if that.",UNK
2789,"Food good, not amazing. Shake is alright, it did come way later than we expected. I would've gave 3 stars however there is not a worker in sight with a smile or personality. I will probably not return here at all.",UNK
2790,This location is just ok probably because it is small and yet folks pack into this tiny box of a location. They have offer La Boulange pastries and seem to have a good assortment of salads and sandwiches available throughout the day. I like that this location is open early.,UNK
2791,"Tint is essential in arizona. I've been burnt in the past but not at Cactus Window Tint.  Amazing job!!   Call and ask for Rick.  Great service, really knows his tint!!  WOW!",UNK

2793,Bookmans is all great.,UNK
2794,Great neighborhood pub.  Food is better than expected from a cozy family sports pub.  Daily food and happy hour specials make it very affordable.  Reliable staff service and food.  The beef on a wreck (salted bun) is a real stand out.  Wings are great.,UNK
2795,"Ate here on a Saturday night. In no way compares to rodeo drive location. Outside of a helpful barkeep and some very fresh mignonette oysters food was disappointing, especially the chewy calamari but also chicken sausage pizza which was underwhelming.",UNK
2796,Best menudo in town. Great salsa. I've only eaten the menudo because it's so good that I haven't wanted to order anything else.,UNK
2797,"This place is amazing! Every time I go I am welcomed with a smile and my hair comes out looking great. This is such a inviting place with great conversation, and the vintage side is great I actually got my new record player here and the vinyl selection is cool!",UNK

2800,Cindy does an excellent job grooming and her daughter is very friendly and very mature. They all seem to be compassionate & caring for our furry kids.,UNK
2801,Not great. There are much nicer Mexican restaurants near by with much more efficient staff.,UNK
2802,I have been approximately 10 times. Each time was good. I love their green sauce. The restaurant itself isn't very appealing.  The location of the bathroom bothers me. It is definitely a safe bet when stuck in Glendale.,UNK
2803,Very cozy restaurant very busy during the weekend get there early. Food is very good and everything tastes homemade.,UNK
2804,"I know this place is popular, due to the fact they are usually busy, and you MUST have an appointment! BUT, I find it to be just mediocre. Not impressed.",UNK

2806,This service was absolutely amazing the owner was so sweet and considerate I paid $151 for 45 minute service. I was in and out quicker then I could have ever imagined. The price was also almost $200 cheaper then most places I checked. It was a quiet and safe environment.,UNK
2807,Just left Rivas for the second straight day....both times I ordered the steak ranchero breakfast burrito...AMAZING!!  a can't miss place!,UNK
2808,Get your picture taken with the Million Dollars! It's free. Otherwise run while you can... This place is in dire need of a renovation.,UNK
2809,The jury is out on the service department at the Mesa camping world. They just opened recently so they deserve a break. My first several encounters are not extremely positive but I expect that will turn around I hope,UNK
2810,Color nails is my new favorite! Exceptionally clean which is a huge priority for me. Customer service has always been great and they take their time and do a really good job,UNK
2811,Unprofessional and unimpressed.  Definitely shop around as there are so many property management companies in the area.  I'm fortunate enough to have found a upstanding and professional company.,UNK
2812,Everything about this place is DISGUSTING!!,UNK
2813,"I like their queen creek location better as far as space, set up and friendlier staff but the food was delicious. I recommend the pollo fundito",UNK
2814,"Don't eat here. Service SUCKS, food is mediocre, and they don't have tirimisu. They are on the way out and they deserve it.",UNK

2823,"Menu selection disappointing. Cob salad was good though. Being named the Adobe restaurant i expected a couple tex-mex selections.  Nope, typical golf club restaurant.  Expected more from the Biltmore.  Bummer!",UNK
2824,"Terrible service and terrible food.  It took the 1 hour to deliver food to our table and 20 minutes for 2 glasses of water.\n\nWould never recommend to anyone, a total disappointment.l",UNK

2828,Excellent.  Service was courteous and prompt.  The salad I had was the best I've ever eaten.  I also tried the chili-cheese fries and they were very good.  The drinks were really good too.  I wish Green were in my hometown.,UNK
2829,Can't speak to the other services the Y offers but the gym is well equipped and up kept. Staff always greats you on your way in and out. Good place to get a work out in.,UNK

2831,"Stand in an hour line to eat crappy food off a crappy limited menu, I would rather just eat real crap.",UNK
2832,"Check your order, they will mess it up or forget stuff. Friendly staff inside not in drive thru. Food is hot and fresh. Drive thur does move fast it seems.",UNK

2835,Good food in an upscale bar atmosphere. Smart design due to close proximity to Hotels and the ballpark (to capture both clientele). Seems like it was pulled right out of that Bar Rescue show. Everything is done top notch.,UNK
2836,Nice to see a Tropical Smoothie in this area! But heck...no customer service at all in this place and it takes sooooo long to get your order! Seriously 15-20min for a smoothie?! Really??,UNK
2837,Terrible service. I'm here right now and it's been 20 min and our waitress has not shown...,UNK
2838,"With such incompetent, careless service that can get only be masked by alcohol, the ONLY thing this place is good for is for having drinks at the bar.",UNK
2839,"I got the Joey bag of donuts burrito with chicken.  It was OK.  Smaller in size compared to Chipotle, and the favor just did not do it for me.  The free chips that come with the meal were GOOD!!!  Chipotle still captures my heart.",UNK
2840,"Best take out Chinese in San tan valley.  I've had noodles, soup, apps, main dishes, and everything has been good.  It's not a sit down type place (but you can).  I rated this for what it is, good take away Chinese food.",UNK
2841,"Slowest Starbucks ever. I have been here numerous times, and it never gets any faster.",UNK
2842,Warm and comforting \nStaff very knowledgable \nThe 'Water of Life'!,UNK
2843,Nice and clean but grossly overpriced compared to Walgreens or rite aid.  \nBathrooms locked which sucks when you have a 3 hour drive ahead of you. \nNot worth the stop.,UNK
2844,The cornbread was good but everything was without season and it was fruit Flys (along with the traps) everywhere! The collard greens had an excessive amount of uncooked onions and tomatoes. I would not recommend this to anyone if you are in the mood for good food.,UNK
2845,"Hands down, the best pizza in Arizona.  If you don't like it and rate it 2 stars or something, that's fine by me.  Have a nice night at Pizza Hut, I am headed to Grimaldi's.",UNK
2846,The highlight of my last Vegas trip. Ingenious choreography that chronicles the Beatles career from mod to peace-and-love to Indian-inspired. There doesn't appear to be a bad seat in the house. I was enthralled and have been singing the songs ever since!,UNK

2851,Jake and Season are always there to greet you with a smile and the best iced latte in town. No wonder they win all the coffee awards!,UNK

2853,"Gf liked the boullabaise, spinach tempura interesting at first...fish cake rubbery but flavorful.  Very nice decor. Great napkin folding.  Waiter hawked a phlegmball just as we were taking our first bite in an otherwise quiet restaurant.",UNK
2854,"Great old school diner feel. Food was great, staff was not terrible but nothing to rave about especially when its slow. \nYou have to go once to try the burgers, its a little pricing but you get a ton of food which makes up for the price.",UNK
2855,"lol yeah alot of older people here. not my music not my crowd. lol... but theres a bar, i got a buzz and left to go somewhere better!!!!!!!!!!",UNK
2856,Giant place - it'd be interesting to see it sometime actually filled with people.,UNK

2881,One of the few nice Chinese restaurants!,UNK
2882,"Met friends and family for late night drinks. Excellent service and great beer selection, but the lone guitarist was too damn loud. You think he was playing for a crowd of hundreds, and there weren't more than 50 people. My ears hurt after hours of it. Even the wait staff agreed.",UNK
2883,This place is very average.  Very nice decor and the menu is pretty good but the atmosphere is crapola. especially for a brewery.  Trying to be upscale but it really doesnt get there.  Not bad for lunch specials but overall this place is just average.,UNK

2891,Best bone and rib eye ever!,UNK
2892,Great Salon the staff was great along with the price! Recommend it everyone..,UNK
2893,I am so happy we selected George and his company to care for our pool and spa.  Our pool and spa have never been cleaner and his prices are reasonable to boot.  George is a very nice man and is easy to work with as well.  I highly recommend Aqualux pool services.,UNK
2894,After a round in the cold we decided to stay and watch the dallas game and have lunch and drinks.  Great food and service.  The mahi was moist and cooked perfectly and the sweet potato fries were great.  Would definitely put this restaurant with great views on my list of places to eat.,UNK

2901,"Great BBQ - Friendly staff, super atmosphere and reasonable prices - what else can you ask for? \nRibs and BBQ Chicken are my favorite.  Try the Devils spit sauce if you dare.",UNK
2902,"Food is too expensive.  NEVER has enough places to sit.  They could have ashow that has 30,000 people and i think they put out about 200 chairs.  it is ridiculous...",UNK
2903,"Service was marginal and food was not very good.  I remember this place being better, but I guess they changed their menu around a bit ago.  Let's just say I like the old one better.  I will pass on this place moving forward.",UNK
2904,"Food was bad...drunk people yelling.. Big mistake. Left food on the table, paid and walked out.",UNK
2905,"good cupcakes, had better but still would have again.",UNK
2906,Thought I would give them a 2nd chance... Bad idea! Employees make you feel like your putting them out for ordering overpriced pizza. this place will be out of business If  the owners don't  make a change quickly.,UNK
2907,If you like lighter version of Monta ... This is the place... A little bigger space also... I tried the miso ramen soup. Not bad...,UNK
2908,red onion has been around forever and it's a staple on Cave Creek Road. The burgers are always juicy and thick and yummy. They're on the rings are the bomb. Good beer selection and they are always cold,UNK
2909,"Used to work for sean and manessa who own Vivido Gelato. nice people really caring about their employees and very fair. There were so many flavors, I didnt even get to try them all myself!",UNK
2910,How this place gets such good reviews is beyond me. Food is bland and tasteless. Service is average at best. The place wasn't even clean. Chinese food is better even in the Midwest than it is at this place. To each his own I guess.,UNK
2911,"Ehh ok food , horrible customer service",UNK
2912,The young lady at the front desk was very professional to all customers even though some customers were not.  Incident taken on this date at 18:32 hours.,UNK
2913,"It's just bad pizza, folks.",UNK
2914,Poor food. Poor customer service. Terrible!!! Don't waste your money!!!!,UNK
2915,"Quiet, comfortable and convenient; excellent attributes for the business traveller! Breakfast included healthy choices but still provided something for the carb-a-holics :-)",UNK
2916,"Place is pretty good, I havent had the food here, but some of the bouncers at the front are nasty, they say, \"" you gotta hit me with something if you wanna go in\"", even when they dont have a cover. The rating is exclusively for that.",UNK
2917,In LOVE!!! Great place to escape the Las Vegas fast-paced atmosphere. Even if you don't get a massage their baths are the best to restore your body !!!! Great experience,UNK
2918,Worst service ever.. Because we literally had no service at all. Saw the reviews but seriously if no one greets you after 8min. Left. Service was awful,UNK
2919,i did pickup and delivery from a hotel on the strip and they were fantastic!,UNK
2920,"Tried Ling & Louies for the first time, different than the traditional for sure. Service and food were both excellent. We tried the duck sliders,lucky lo mein rice, orange peel chicken & beef & broccoli.",UNK
2921,"Well, I love REI.  This store has it all.  This particular location has great service.  Every time I have had to buy gear of whatever kind I've always been helped by someone who is thoroughly informed, as well as pleasant.",UNK
2922,It was just ok. I had the $15 surf and turf. What can you really expect for $15. You get what you pay for. The apps were the best part. I thought the bruschetta was good.,UNK
2923,"This place sucks!!! 6 people from my son's team got sick after eating here. All the manager could say was \""OK\"". They need to have the health department check them out and the Riviera should screen who they allow to sell in their food court.",UNK
2924,"I ordered the fish and chips. The fish was ok. The French fries were greasy, hand cut fries that were only half way cooked. They were so nasty I couldn't eat them. The price was $10. Total waste of money.",UNK
2925,The food was great. The view is phenomenal,UNK
2926,Awesome food. Great happy hour.  Amazing staff.  Excellent atmosphere.  The Big Roll is worth it!,UNK
2927,"Nice club, fun, friendly girls.  If you go, try to find Jade.  She does yoga, so is very flexible. She's a fun time; Let's just say I would be incredibly embarrassed if I were related to her.",UNK
2928,"How, oh how could this IHOP close, with premium placement next to the lightrail?",UNK
2929,"Great food, superb service, very clean environment, friendly atmosphere, super clean Decor & restrooms. Nohemi was a great attentive server, major props to this place, it's nice to travel and have a good breakfast place with no or minimal wait. A must try.",UNK
2930,"A-OK bakery.  Not overly impressed but not disappointed either.  Service was pleasant and the selection decent, just not stellar.  I'd go when in the area again but won't go out of my way or anything.",UNK
2931,I'm still here in the restaurant to write this review. This place SUCKS service is lacking and food I've had better. My serve Kalani forgot everything maybe it's time for a Career change.,UNK
2932,"The food wasn't bad, but it did lack flavor. They have great lunch prices and fast service....but, I probably wouldn't go back.",UNK
2933,Appointment times seem to be arbitrary and it feels more like a first come first served basis.  After waiting for 30 minutes I had to cancel and leave.  Front desk was friendly enough but seemed disorganized and overworked.  I'll try again another day and update review if things are different.,UNK
2934,We went for my brother in laws 30th birthday.  The staff and food were excellent.  I cant wait to go back.,UNK
2935,Rick is the best.  I live in Denver and fly out every few weeks for perfect highlights.  And the prices are fab to boot!,UNK
2936,The Coffee Shop service is slow. Don't waste your time on the burger it was a disaster. Overall the place is ok but it's low class compared to neighboring casinos. I probably wont stay here again.,UNK
2937,"Stale bread, bland sword fish, slow service. On the up side, the crabs were nice. Our best dish of the night was the brocolini. Which isn't saying much about the restaurant.",UNK
2938,"Don't eat here way over priced. $15 for 3 asparagus spears, 2 tbsp. of spinach and 4 tiny slices of tuna. Go down the street to Rachel's kitchen much more bang for your buck.",UNK
2939,Probably some of the better bar food in this complex. The only real downside is how loud this place is and how bad the seating is. You will get bumped into while you're eating almost every time,UNK
2940,It is fast food and reminiscent of all fast food.  Clearly Sonic is about shakes and deserts.  This location continues that.  What distinguishes the location is the group of young people that always have a positive attitude. They provide their name and check back with about 1/2 through your service.,UNK
2941,"Service, scallops, all - top notch in every way!",UNK
2942,Shepherd's Pie was amazing! This visit certainly changed my perception of British food. Next time I'm in Phoenix I will definitely return.,UNK
2943,"I was a little disappointed, the place is very old and the service was not great came in for dinner, way over priced for the portions and rice and naan not included! My suggestion is you read all reviews before going.",UNK
2944,"Good not great\nNeed a better lunch menu and Taco Tuesday special \nI will go back if in the area, but won't go out of my way",UNK
2945,As usual they slop a whole bunch of secret sauce so you can't taste the beef or the rest of the sandwich.  I had the new advertised Rueben and sure wasn't impressed.,UNK
2946,"This Starbuck's is super slow & overpriced compared to the others. They don't take gift cards due to \""technical difficulties.\"" I'd recommend finding another Starbuck's on the strip. Worst Starbucks to visit!",UNK
2947,"The food is decent, but that is if you can actually get service once seated, and if you get service it comes with a lot of bad attitude!\n\nI'd recommend skipping this place!",UNK
2948,Delicious thai ice teas and pad thai. Yellow curry is my wife's favorite and having several  levels of hotness make this a great place on the west side!,UNK
2949,"Maria is AMAZING! Super personable and excited to help. Got me in right away. Took her time and made me feel extremely comfortable. The office is clean and pretty. Blows miracle in progress out of the water, I will definitely be returning!",UNK
2950,Here to have a massage with Rich by far the best massage therapist I've ever had here.  Wow amazing as usual.,UNK
2951,Disappointing overcooked tofu cubes.  Food did not appear or taste fresh.  Will not return.,UNK
2952,The coffee is fantastic a little bit out of my way but it sure beats Starbucks. The customer service is exceptional as well. Highly recommended. I will be back.,UNK
2953,"The worst airport I've ever been to. There was only about one screen displaying flight statuses in a waiting area. There is a lack of anything to do (nothing to look at, no where to walk, not many places to eat, etc.)",UNK
2954,Worth the money!!! My friend bought a special for a pedicure and Swedish massage for two and OMG it was so worth the money. The Ravella has great amenities and the staff was super nice. I will be going back for sure. Great stress release.,UNK
2955,There are better in Vegas.Yes there are bargains!! However I will go out of my way to shop at other Walmart before i go there. Why ? There is a picket line there.,UNK
2956,"This is a must try if you live in Phoenix and like Thai food. Great food, clean/hip place, great service, reasonably priced...what more can you ask for?",UNK
2957,"Totally unimpressed. They didn't even make the burger as I ordered it. I was the only person in line, and they rushed me to take my order. Then got it wrong. Way over-priced.",UNK
2958,Cute little and red\nVery tasty,UNK
2959,"Run! It is ALL about the money!! They find any reason to sneak a regular visit fee into a well visit appointment. I was charged for an \""extended education\"" for discussing everyday life. I will never go back and I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.",UNK
2960,yum yum yum yum yum. that's all you need to know. service is great too!,UNK
2961,"Loved the pulled pork sandwich!! This is a terrific family owned, neighborhood BBQ shop! I could eat there every day of the week!!",UNK
2962,Food is excellent albeit a bit pricey.\nBut the noise level is Outrageous--We could not converse at all.\nWill not return during lunch or dinner hour unless some acoustical treatment is installed.,UNK
2963,"no thanks. half of the seats in the theater are office chairs, no joke.  too many other great movie theaters in scottsdale to waste your money on this one.",UNK
2964,"Excellent care. The teams in A 3 are Top Shelf. From the cleaning crew to aides to nurses to room service to midnight vampires to doctors, everyone was fabulous. Always cheerful, kind, warm, gentle hands and hearts and good ear.",UNK
2965,Great food at a great price!  Will def go again!   Deep fried marshmallows to die for and fried Oreos too!!!  Food hot and cooked great!!!,UNK
2966,"Don't eat here!!!!! They have horrible service, the food is nasty, and they take forever to make one hamburger.",UNK
2967,"Two stars for food, no stars for Service = one star.",UNK
2968,"The absolute WORST place to stay in Las Vegas. If you visit their website, ignore all the photos. Total dump. Although I've won money in their casino, even the casino and the rest of the grounds are terrible.\nStay anywhere, but here.",UNK
2969,i love going to Sweet Tomatoes...met my friend here since it was closer to her than to us on w flamingo. i forgot how busy they get with alot of keikis...unfortunately on this side some people are just ignorant and messy.,UNK
2970,"Great service! She makes you feel welcome and comfortable the entire time. Highly recommended for any waxing needs. In and out in a breeze, make sure to book your next appointment sooner than later.",UNK
2971,"I ate there last night, party of four. Had wait of 25 minutes. Food was just OK. Wonder what all reviews saw in this place. Disappointing. Never again.",UNK
2972,I'm not really sure what to say about Denny's. It was deadest Denny's I have ever been to. Service seemed fine and the food wasn't bad. I would go back.,UNK
2973,"This was a great show.  Celine was absolutely breathtaking when she took the stage.   However, Stevie Wonder,  give me the real thing.  Her emotional ending... give me a break.  How do you manage to cry at every performance?",UNK
2974,I reaaaaaly want to like this place because it's the only option at the lvh. please please please hire someone else in the kitchen. it wouldn't be hard. 1 month; it would be a different place. I promise. maybe one week.,UNK
2975,5/3/2014 midnight......\nsaw them loading all equipment into a truck.\n\n\nclosed!!\n\nout of business\n\nthey should have had cod,UNK
2976,not good service.. not bad service.. just service.. and hardly any nail polish...:(,UNK
2977,The food here was decent. Small portions with high prices. I would recommend eating something before hand.,UNK
2978,This is a Starbuck's located inside Von's. It is owned and managed by Von's.\n  Plenty of help and seats.\n  Very convenient for a caffeine boost  when I patronize this Von's or I am headed southeast.,UNK
2979,Lots of options but not the best of it's kind.  Fast enough for lunch and fair priced.,UNK
2980,I have eaten at this dive\n\nCan't beat the NFl specials 1/2 price Pizza's and wings during all Sunday and Monday NFL games.  Draft Beer $2.75-$3.25 Ice cold and delicious.,UNK
2981,"Cool, casual service and the home of probably the best cornbread I have ever had in my LIFE. In my view, you can't go wrong with Mert's. Happy eating!",UNK
2982,I like the place. Breads are good. Everything look clean. The only place that have bread I like. Recommend.,UNK
2983,Highly recommend.  They offer free wifi which is unheard of at a Westin level property.  Staff is super helpful.,UNK
2984,Can I put zero stars. At this point it took us 20 minutes after getting seated to get a waitress to stop at the table. Then given a poor excuse about why. Don't know if the food is any good at this time but the beer selection looks good.,UNK
2985,I'm looking for comedians to start a comedy night in Glendale  if your interested email me cutty20s@yahoo.com,UNK

2989,Good food for a good price. The ribs are highly recommended.,UNK
2990,"Keep it up!  Delicious!!  As New Yorkers, we were very skeptical but pleasantly surprised by the quality and taste of the food!!",UNK
2991,Great little spot when you spend the night in the middle of nowhere.  Plenty of coffee and flapjacks for the road.  Enjoy the space age ambiance.,UNK
2992,"I give this place one star because unlike J. Crew Factory online, they DO NOT sell boys and girls clothes, only men and women. Also, the employees here are just a little snooty.",UNK
2993,By far the best sushi in the east valley! It seems the smaller sushi bars always do better than the larger ones,UNK
2994,"Slow as molasses in an igloo. A line of ten deep took 25 minutes to go through. Also severely overpriced. $25 for a pre-made panini, two croissants and a bottle of water ($5!) yikes.",UNK
2995,Good chicken fingers.,UNK
2996,"God i hate eat n park. Only reason i have gone is for the salad bar because u cant find a decent salad bar in this city. Just about every entree iv had here is nothing more than rubbish, except maybe the cheesteak. Only go if u have little kids",UNK
2997,Favorite sushi place in NV!  Price is reasonable and food is incredible!  I will eat there every time I go to Las Vegas.,UNK
2998,"Not bad. Clean, conveniently located. Not so good if you need internet. I was going to post a picture of the speedtest.net results for this place. Download speed .03mbps, upload speed .02mbps. I think dial-up does better.",UNK
2999,"I have never really enjoyed Cafe Istanbul. From the attitude from the staff (catch them on a bad day and they're downright rude) to how insanely difficult it can be to even get new coals, I'd just rather go somewhere else with my friends.",UNK
3000,"Mall l, but I desperately need a beer break from school shopping. And since I was there, I had to have a burger. Not the best burger in town, but an acceptable alternative when out shopping",UNK
3001,Just crappy Mexican food the best part was the Mexican flag in my food. But this a disgrace to Mexico in every way possible. Every single menu item taste the same.  The salsa is watery and nasty. Don't waste your time.,UNK
3002,Terrible food quality. It used to be good. Now neither French nor Italian. Waiter is also clueless. Don't waste your time or money here! Giving it 2 stars for the musician and quick service. Eat here only if starving to death in Las Vegas.,UNK
3003,Third trip to the Strip. A decent room with good space. Not quite the view. Back end of Monte Carlo for us on rhw 15th floor. Not a seperate shower. Pros lots of small deli and eateries.,UNK
3004,"All fire and no flavor. Vindaloo was pretty hot, but no complexity.",UNK
3005,Low prices and good service.  I use it when I'm in between big store runs.  When I only need $20 to $40 worth of stuff or so.  Bring your own bags or you can buy them for .05.,UNK
3006,I have done several deals over the years with Stew. He is top notch. Not only is he extremely knowledgeable but he puts his clients first (he can be pretty funny too).,UNK
3007,I bring patients here a lot. ED staff is awesome!,UNK
3008,"My wife and I were the only people in the place this Monday night so the service was above and beyond. The Chop Salad was legit, the osso bucco was near perfect. I've paid a lot more for a whole lot less in the past.",UNK
3009,Passage to India is just another curry house serving up dishes with muddled flavors that won't excite you.  Paratha was a bit dense and came to the table when I was half way through my curry.,UNK
3010,"Had an amazing time at the club crawl! Great clubs, great deals, and a great group. The hosts seemed to really care and wanted to make sure everyone had an amazing time. For sure doing this every time I go to Vegas.....",UNK

3017,My husband and I had the most awesome experience at Prestos our waiter Alex and Alaina were the best they suggested the shrimp & grits and the chicken martini and both were great! We will definently be back thanks for a great dining experience.,UNK
3018,"For as much as this room cost, it's awful.  The furniture is dinged up and dingy, the TV is ancient and without inputs, and the toilet runs constantly.  I won't be staying here again.",UNK
3019,"I had the Lamb burger, and my wife had I think the mushroom burger.  Our food was very prompt, tasty, and decently presented.  Definitely will be coming back here for a bite next time in in town!",UNK
3020,Ahhh it's ok     Look you're in Vegas so how bad can it be?  Everyone in our party got a suite except us!!!!!! Nothing special.. I prefer the hotel at man bay better.,UNK
3021,Worst sushi ever. I hate when sushi looks dried out right when you get it. I wouldn't eat here if you paid me and you would have to because it costs so much.,UNK
3022,Great place to hang out. The staff really cares about their patrons. Good food and talented bartenders.,UNK
3023,Went for my birthday and bobby was out server. What an awesome guy! He took great care of us. I would deff go back and ask for him again. He made my night special.  You must for him.,UNK
3024,"Along with the same inspiring performances I have come to expect from a Cirque show, this show has the added bonus of being both hot and funny. Don't miss it!",UNK
3025,"Reasonably priced, decently fired pizza.\nThe salads are huge too!",UNK
3026,"Not bad at all. The staff is always very nice and quick. The sandwiches are alright, usually just a little soggy since they are not made right on the spot. THE CUPCAKES are incredible and so is the dill potato salad. Everything is pretty expensive but its usually worth it.",UNK
3027,I come here often because its great for lunch and they're usually quick. The workers are always nice and happy to greet you. There's a lot to choose from so everyone can have something they like. My favorite location hands down,UNK
3028,I ordered a small 11 inch vegetarian special pizza for lunch planning to keep half of it for dinner.  The pizza was so good that I finished it. Would recommend this place and I will be coming back.,UNK
3029,"don't get your eye exam here. The staff is very friendly as they rip you off with fee after excessive fee, on top of any insurance coverage you may have. They may even suggest financing. You should not need to get financing to get an eye exam.",UNK
3030,"Um way overpriced. The food was ok. Nothing to write home about tho. We sat on an edge where the water \""rains\"" and I got wet from it the whole time. Its decorated cute tho.",UNK
3031,Super yummy & the staff is great! I definitely recommend this place. Service was fast & the food looks absolutely delicious. I'll be ordering the cookie with ice cream for dessert. The place is not too busy so my server is super attentive & my meal got out in good time.,UNK
3032,This was our best fairmont stay and our favorite farimont resort. Could have not been better. Thank you. First class.,UNK
3033,As BBQ in Phoenix goes - this is one of the better ones.  Get there early - they fill up FAST!,UNK
3034,Kevin Vale and Michael Baker are distracted professionals.\n\nThey do not have the time to adequately represent their clients.\n\nThey let the other attorneys run right over them. \n\nDo not waste your hard earned money on this firm.,UNK
3035,"I like the lounge to have a quiet drink in but the food is really bad.  out of the freezer, into the fryer is not a recipe for good eats.",UNK
3036,Not my favorite of the local baristas but it's Starbucks...terribly consistent.,UNK
3037,"If you don't mind in eating a room that smells like an ashtray, you'll love it.  The kitchen fans pull the cigarette smoke thru the space from the casino floor.  After a meal you smell like you smoked a pack",UNK
3038,Perfect! The good is actually quite tasty.. I had the California chicken burger with a side salad. I like the way they stuff their griddles chicken breast with avocado and their side salad is made with fresh greens. I would definitely recommend this place for lunch..  :-),UNK
3039,"There pizza is really good have many sorts BUT for paying 26 something a person I wouldn't go back for it.\nThe food over all was eh, nothing was GREAT really the desserts were boring.. Not impressed.",UNK

3044,"We got married in April and made our way to Sage for dinner. What a great experience! Top notch food, fantastic service and a great atmosphere. Please go to Sage, and tell everyone you know about it. We live in the Midwest, and have already made recommendations to everyone we know!",UNK
3045,Updating my terrible review from 5 days ago. The owner of the new Stephanie location personally called me to discuss my bad experience 5 days ago. With the location just opening & it being a busy Friday night it shows he cares taking the time out. I will return to check it out once more.,UNK
3046,"Tried this place today after some co-workers recommended it. The food was amazing, service impeccable, and the store was sparkling clean. I think I have found my new favorite lunch spot!",UNK
3047,"This place is too Americanized!  Their food doesn't even come close to real Asian food.  It is a good place for people who want to say they are adventurous, but really like to eat hamburgers & hot dogs.  Over priced!",UNK
3048,"I go to Casino Royale for craps.  $5 minimum with 100x odds.  I don't bet anywhere near 100x odds, but I have seen people put down 100x.  Central location on the Strip is very convenient.  Otherwise, its very dingy and full of chain smokers.",UNK
3049,"Food is great, owners are nice and give good service, funny that people bitch about how the place looks its a taco stand not a restaurant.",UNK
3050,Really good coffee and nice staff. A great place to share a little moment with friends.,UNK

3054,My meal was well prepared the steak was cooked perfectly serving staff was friendly.  Their sparkling water appears home made and was warm. Hmm?They were very busy due to CES conference. Felt rushed for the table.,UNK
3055,"I love getting their $5 off $20 coupon in the mail. Everytime I come here I spend at least that much on their specials, fresh fruit or premade meals. And if you forget your $5 off coupon, a friendly face worker will gladly give you one.",UNK
3056,The owner stole a bracelet brought in for repairs and has lied over and over about returning it.,UNK
3057,"Beautiful park nestle in the heart of northern Las Vegas.  It's a great place for families to enjoy nature, walking, bicycling and playing on the man-made playground.  Very serene atmosphere.",UNK

3061,Food was decent but not amazing while the service was pretty slow.  Atmosphere was rather stale and uninteresting so I'd recommend take-out.,UNK
3062,"Their yogurt is good, but personally I'd recommend yogurtology or mojo better, for the flavor and especially because I really like the self-service system.",UNK
3063,"Nice park but people really need to pick up their dog poop. I have a dog and I clean up after her. I don't understand how pet owners can be that irresponsible. Other than the poop issue, there is a nice walking area and plenty of play areas for kids.",UNK

3073,I like this place mainly for the cold beer and the bikes.  I did have some good fried okra and collard greens here though.,UNK
3074,"They have alot of merchandise and clothing at this one, but a good bit of it looks trashy. It looks unorganized and cluttered compared to others I've been at. Prices are high as well.",UNK
3075,3AM greasy NY style fold that shit over and wash it down w/ a PBR goodness for $8.75 total.  At the Cosmo of all places too.  Delicious.,UNK
3076,OUTSTANDING!!!!  Will definitely be ordering their pizza in the near future!,UNK
3077,"Went to Harper's yesterday to eat, but as soon as I saw the B rating, we left.",UNK
3078,"to bad its closed, maybe it will re-open in the venetian, I dont think they will keep the 25 cent martinis, will keep u updated.",UNK
3079,"A small and amazing zoo. It's free, has lots of animals that people (children) like, and  is an easy way to spend a couple hours. This easily beats Chicago's Lincoln Park Zoo. A must-see!",UNK
3080,The food and the atmosphere were great.  Not what I expected from a place in a strip mall.  I would definitely recommend giving it  a try!,UNK
3081,"Love the ability to wait for a call at home instead of waiting room full of sick people! Good, efficient service. Will definitely use again!",UNK
3082,"This is good pizza when you consider the price and that it is meant to be for quick pick up. Let's not bother comparing it to other pizza places, because that wouldn't be fair. You'll never beat the price for a pizza like this.",UNK
3083,"slow, very slow.  you would think for what they charge they would move a little faster. slow, sloowww, sllloooowwww.",UNK
3084,"My wife and I have been here twice now and each time the subs were delicious and the prices are very reasonable. Plus, cheese curds! My favorite sub so far was the Philly cheesesteak. Great customer service too!",UNK
3085,"This trip wasn't as bad. Minus the heard of children ripping tags off things, collecting them, and throwing them on the floor. Again, while parents pay no regard to what their gremlins are doing",UNK
3086,The staff here was friendly but the food was sub par. There were a lot of weird twist to the breakfast plates that weren't explained on the menu when you order. Pancakes were probably the highlight on this menu after trying the spot out 4 different times.,UNK
3087,The best view in Las Vegas! I'm lucky to have friends that live at the Mandarin residences so we frequent this bar often. Drinks are expensive but it's worth it for the view and incredible atmosphere. It's a great place to start your night!,UNK
3088,"Really good food, authentic atmosphere. Service is a bit awkward, but not bad for a family run restaurant.",UNK
3089,This place was awesome. I have a 8 and 5 years old and Jimmy was really good. Their haircuts are perfect. Definitely worth the wait.,UNK
3090,"The drinks are good, the baristas are friendly and do a nice job. I love the staff. They make me smile every day!   The layout odd. No inside seating and limited outside seating.",UNK
3091,"We love this place! We eat at Famous Uncle Al's about once a week, especially during Volley Ball & Basketball season. It is a great friendly place to be. You really feel at home here, not to mention the good looking gray haired owner! Tell Ernie we said hello!",UNK
3092,I enjoy this place from time to time. The chicken is always fresh tasting and their avocado salsa is my favorite. I like to stop in for a grilled chicken breast with a loco side salad or their new chicken tacos. Best choice for fast food.,UNK
3093,"Excellent!  If I lived in Phoenix, I would consider driving here for dinner.   The sauce bin the carnitas had great flavor and texture.",UNK
3094,"Love this place. Not the fanciest looking joint, but it has the best Mexican food I've ever had! Well done!",UNK
3095,I came back to try the loose leaf. I was disappointed to see the tea tins were dusty and obviously don't sell well. I guess since this is more a coffee shop than tea place I should not be surprised. I will stick to the coffee!,UNK
3096,"This place used to good not sure what happened. Lamb chops were flavorless, soup was bland, and the service was terrible. Gazpacho was the worst! Barely ate anything we ordered. Don't waste your money.",UNK
3097,"Horribly slow. Crowded dining room. The food can be gotten at In and Out burger for half the price for the same food. \n\nAll in all, not worth the trip and the time wastes on a lunch hour.",UNK
3098,"Disappointing, really.  They didn't get our order right and there were only four people in.  The plates and glasses were all chipped up.  The coffee was mediocre and the inside was full of flies.  Won't be returning, but had hopes for this place.",UNK
3099,Winchells has the best donuts in my opinion. Theres nothing special about this particular shop. There chillas are my favorite though :),UNK
3100,I love that Cactus Grill offers tofu as a filling in their tacos and burritos.  The quality of the vegetables is a plus.,UNK
3101,It is a 7-11. Usual stuff. Clean store.,UNK
3102,"A great favorite of ours. Service is constantly friendly. Food is of excellent quality and portions are huge. They also accept Restaurant.com gift certificates. I highly recommend Golden Gate Chinese Restaurant. After moving from NYC two years ago, this has become our favorite Chinese restaurant in the Phoenix market!",UNK
3103,My number 1 pizza place here in AZ so far and I'm on a mission! Don't leave without eating the garlic cheese knots !,UNK
3104,They charged up twice for the same order and then yelled at me on the phone saying that because I didn't have my recite on me it wasn't there problem and hung up on me,UNK
3105,Tried to have dimmer here. 5:12 and still closed. No note or sign for explanation.  Unfortunate because I would have enjoyed trying it!,UNK
3106,"Cinnamon and sugar on sweet potato fries. Not what should come with a burger! Buffalo Wild Wings, where ya at? Good beers.",UNK
3107,Came here for brunch before a Cardinals' game. Food was good and drinks very generous. Love that they have the bus to the games. Very nice that everyone could enjoy their time and nobody had to worry about driving.,UNK
3108,What a delicious treat! Went here with a friend and enjoyed every last bite of my black cherry ice cream. Everything is handmade and it tastes that way! Would definitely love to go again!,UNK
3109,"The place is clean, menu is decent but an employee (apparently the manager?) was belligerantly drunk and running her mouth at the bar.  One drink and done for me, won't be back.  Ethically cannot support that behavior.",UNK
3110,"I was a little hesitant going in...very pleased...was in and out in an hour which included intake, met with doctor, xrays, and prescriptions...$30 co-pay...not bad...",UNK
3111,"This place is nothing special.  Just like every other RA, the food is okay and the atmosphere is asian inspired.  There are better places to eat around the Old Town Scottsdale area.  I say skip this and try something else like the Orange Table.",UNK
3112,"Helpful staff, good selection and healthy plants. My second favorite nursery and one that I frequent often.",UNK
3113,Beautiful presentation!  Great food!,UNK
3114,Best place to get all your gardening needs! They also have what the Garden Guys recommends to buy!,UNK
3115,"Stopped in here for lunch while in town for a wedding.  The food was solid, the service friendly, and the atmosphere welcoming.  I particularly enjoyed the mashed potatoes and the tomato-basil soup, which was excellent and a surprisingly good complement to the more traditional southern food I ordered.",UNK
3116,The raspados are absolutely delicious however their hours are unreliable. My husband and I went today at 1240 because the website said they open at 1200 but they were closed. I was craving their cajeta raspado :(,UNK
3117,The waffles are sooo good you can't eat just one.   The food is outstanding and even though you eventually become full you still want more.  The menu has  many selections and is very easy to read.\n\nLarry & Eva Roth,UNK
3118,Was highly average.    Burgers were greasy and nothing special.  Wouldn't take a special trip for it.   \nI agree.  In &Out way better!,UNK
3119,"This place has great food, but is habitually closed when they state that they should be open. To put this in perspective they have been closed 4 out of 7 times we've tried dinning here during their posted hours.",UNK
3120,"The food is amazing! I love the Belgian waffle beach style! Comes with bananas, pineapple, whipped cream, and caramel drizzle!!! The staff is absolutely wonderful as well! Always recommend this place!",UNK
3121,"Been here a few times n saw Dr Kelly Kang. She treated my lower back n after I came in. It helped ease the pain n after a few hours later it was much better. If you come in, I highly recommend you see her.",UNK
3122,"Love this place! Tina for pedi and Te for nails and wax. I am a regular and they are  always pleasant , quick, and clean. Give them a try!",UNK
3123,I ordered the crab fried rice and my friend had the kim chee fried rice. They were both good but the price wasn't. I thought it was a little too high.,UNK
3124,"Food was excellent! My sister had the filet mignon and LOVED it. I had the steak classique and it brought me great joy! Definitely recommended. Bring a sweater bc it's a little chilly, but well worth it.",UNK
3125,Fantastic service. Okay portion vs cost. Recommend sitting outside next to Las Vegas blvd. the croissant sandwich was delicious.,UNK
3126,"I've only been here once, but the reviews are pretty accurate. Ok to drink but the service for food is not so great. The competition in this area is big so you'd think they try harder but nope.",UNK
3127,Good food and fast service. Seemed very clean and the staff was friendly. It didn't knock my socks off but was tasty still and great for a road trip meal.,UNK
3128,"Sit outside!  Inside can be a little crowded & loud, but outside is just right!",UNK
3129,"Love this Place :)  Everything I Need is there...Reminds me back in the PI.   :)\nFrom renting Filipino DVD,Banks, Fast food, & Grocery...",UNK
3130,"This is the second time that I have been here in 4 weeks and I will not go back anytime soon, the service was average, the quality of the food was poor and the value non existant, so many better steakhouses in town --very disappointing especially after all the hype",UNK
3131,Not kid friendly food.  Potatoes are not good.  Pastries looked tasty.,UNK
3132,"I love this place!!! Lots of space and cheap, TASTY Mexican food. Not much more than that needs to be said.",UNK
3133,"All I had here was the AMAZING thick Italian hot chocolate in the dark chocolate variety, and it was splendid. Very chocolatey, very rich....I would get it again and would suggest you get it too!",UNK
3134,Love this place. Love the atmosphere the patio outside. Wonderful day to whiddle away the afternoon.,UNK
3135,"Great food, great service. Ask for Kathy... She is the most personable and sweetest waitress I've ever met.",UNK
3136,Great place for coffee and hanging out with friends. The staff is wonderful and John and Aurelia (the owners) are outgoing and fun. The food is tasty and changes with the season. You have to try the pulled pork. John smokes it himself on Saturday mornings.,UNK
3137,Worst breakfast I have ever had.  Ordered biscuits and gravy with sausage.  Gravy not hot and had to ask for more and still not enough to cover biscuits and sausage. Was not breakfast sausage but some dry beef stick. Never again.,UNK
3138,"Food is good but staff/service is HORRENDOUS. Every single time I go there they mess up my order, in my opinion they need to hire all new staff. And when I complained, I got attitude from the manager. Worst McDonald's.",UNK
3139,"I don't really care what the overall stars rating is, this place is great!\nThe Shepard's pie is one of the best in the valley and the staff is always ready with a fresh pint.\nThe Sunday jam sessions for traditional music is great.",UNK
3140,"OMG, was this buffet horrible!",UNK
3141,So sad the food is not the same as it used to be. I came back here several times for the awesome greek salad now it sucks. And the garlic fries are horrible too. Basically it's just now overpriced bar food.,UNK
3142,Food was amazing! I had the chicken Marsala and mushroom risotto which I couldn't finish because it was sooo much good. I totally recommend place.,UNK
3143,"Great staff, even, long lasting tan.",UNK
3144,I really like it and I am a pizza snob.  The main thing is the crust on the thin crust pizza was awesome.  Had a great outdoor seating area and the staff was friendly.  The fact that they were all hot chicks from ASU helped.,UNK
3145,"By far the best happy hour in Pittsburgh!  Drinks are 1/2 off!  The food is awesome. My favorites are the fish & tofu tacos, the bean dip, and the fried tofu on Thursday nights!",UNK
3146,This is my second visit here and i am happy to say it was way better than after they just opened.  \n\n2 egg breakfast with bacon and hash browns were perfect.  Service was excellent and had some sympathy for those of us who were nursing hangovers.,UNK
3147,"So delicious! We love the whip cream, biscoff, and berries...you can't go wrong with whatever you order from here!",UNK
3148,Horrible salty food! Chapalas mexican food is the best in Las Vegas hands down!,UNK
3149,"Absolutely love this shop. I have 3 tattoos done by Steve & one of them is a cover up. Everyone there is very talented in their own way. Very professional, positive vibes, & good music. Nothing but good things to say about this shop!!",UNK
3150,I was a kid in a candy store. Fully stock and plenty to choose from .,UNK
3151,Meh.  Trinkets.  A few restaurants.  Best thing here is the tixforless outlet but these are everywhere.,UNK
3152,"Love this place for sushi. You must try the American Dream Roll! You'll thank me later, I promise.",UNK
3153,"what a terrible place, and it is a shame because trapeze is so much fun but gets ruined by the douchebagery of the owner.",UNK
3154,Fresh food. You can see them make it as you order it. Great prices as well.,UNK
3155,So the first time I ate here was with my girlfriends in April I was the only one that got sick so I thought it was just me. I went back in July with six other people four got sick including me. I will never go back!,UNK
3156,Mix Zone Cafe is sooooooo good! Their lunch specials are VERY reasonably priced and the food is wonderful. I can't wait to go there again! Go check it out.,UNK
3157,"Stopped by at 8PM on Friday night for a quick snack, place was locked up tight with not a soul in sight. Closing time on Friday according to the location website is 9PM",UNK
3158,"Great breakfast spot, pancakes were delicious, service was great.",UNK
3159,"Decent selection, fair prices, but could use more folks at the checkout lanes, or at least a process whereby they call up more employees to help out quicker.",UNK
3160,"If there were a 'zero' stars, that's what they would get. Just down right rude and impatient. You are in the business of customer service people!! I would not recommend them to ANYONE!",UNK
3161,"Pizza and Caesar salad were great, pretty neat place to get a quick eat",UNK
3162,I feel like I could have purchased their food in the freezer section of my grocery store. Server was nice.,UNK
3163,Super friendly people. Had exactly what is to be expected from any good smoke shop. Tons of selection. Will be back!,UNK
3164,Very good food however Mongolia beef really spicy.  They have a drive threw located off of craig.,UNK
3165,Typical retirement course. The greens were in good shape. Had some challenging holes which was nice. A good value for Phoenix in the middle of winter when golf prices are outragous.,UNK
3166,"We came, we saw benches, never saw a host to seat us even though the signs said wait to be seated, we left and we won't return. No love from this place so no love for it.",UNK
3167,"Decent pizza, but don't bother dining in.  The service is negligible, plastic forks and knives, paper plates, and self serve drinks.  The place is too small and carry out patrons are constantly standing around your table.  Not very relaxing.",UNK
3168,"Adam was very professional, non-pushy, and great to do business with. We had checked out their competitors and Fitness 4 Home was much better in every way.",UNK
3169,"Really like this new place. Holding back on the fifth star until I try more menu items. Tucked away in yet another of our suburban strip malls, it is a delicious surprise and much needed. We hope it is a success and will be back soon to promote that!",UNK
3170,"Didn't want to taste anything here because when I asked to speak to the owner, I was told by the manager that the owner would not be receptive of me \""if you know what I mean\"" is what she said. I took this as a racial remark",UNK
3171,Great crew.  Each person has something special to offer and they all know what they are doing.  My mom switched after 10 years with Verizon because of some Bozo there...  Much happier with AT&T.,UNK
3172,Bartender sees me walk in but no greeting. Waited about 10 min but no service so I left.,UNK
3173,"Good pizza, excellent service. This was a family-run place - the chicken artichoke and bbq pizza was awesome.",UNK
3174,We found this place right when it opened and no longer go anywhere else for breakfast. This place is top notch.,UNK
3175,"Snob, cher, peu copieux (voir la photo) trop guind\u00e9 et peu de choix pour un brunch.",UNK
3176,"Rooms are decent but loud. Internet sucks which is why I won't be back. Not a great place. Service was ok, wireless internet is unreliable.",UNK
3177,It's Zipps. A chain restaurant that has the same feel wherever you go. Not as big as the one in Arcadia. The wings are always great. The pizza is comparable to the take-n-bake that you can pick up at your local grocery store.,UNK
3178,"Great place to eat on the strip. We had a large party and our server was more than accommodating. The ambiance was quaint and relaxing, a contrast to many other places on the strip which tend to be loud. I ordered a butternut squash salad  which was excellent.",UNK
3179,"Not a fan. He keeps shilling fad \""diet\"" and \""nutritional\"" products from some website, claiming he doesn't make a dime on them. Other issues I won't discuss here.",UNK
3180,"All I can say is stay away. We ordered the crispy beef, but got burnt beef instead.  This restaurant has no problem serving burnt food to its customers. Even the waitress saw that the food was burnt and served it anyway. They did offer to make us another, but only after we complained.",UNK
3181,"For some reason, this location does not make the smoothies like the other stores around Vegas. The smoothies here taste like blended ice. They don't even blend the smoothies enough. They taste more like slush than smoothies. This has happened on several occasions.",UNK
3182,"Got the call and asked them how they can help because my wife has been fighting breast cancer for a year and a half and we're broke, they hung up on me.",UNK
3183,Slow service from start to finish unfortunately and mediocre food other than the desserts.,UNK
3184,"I haven't had a bad sandwich here, yet.  The ones that I have had allowed me to be braver about trying new ones.   They also have awesome ice (yup, ice).  Similar to Sonic Drive In's.",UNK
3185,Had the thin crust deluxe. It was fantastic. Sausage was so good. Definitely worth going to. A 14 inch medium was more than enough for 2.,UNK
3186,This part of campus is beautiful. Come thirsty and hungry because there are lots of things to try!,UNK
3187,"Disgusting! Do not stay here!\n\nIt was very clear the room they put us in was not clean. The sheets were filthy and stained. \n\nIf everything else in the area is booked, do yourself a favor, go somewhere else.",UNK
3188,"Food was good, service bad.... Nice server, but he forgot about us. We waited for an hour after we fin eating to het asked desert...",UNK
3189,awesome eyebrow threading place.  fast.  cheap.  great service.  i've been here multiple times and i've always walked out with fabulous eyebrows!,UNK
3190,"came here for a rehearsal dinner and the food was pretty decent. then i came back for brunch and the food was dry. i had high hopes since everyone has mentioned their brunch is great. however, i was a bit disappointed. service was less than stellar.",UNK
3191,Can you be addicted to Panda Express? Cause I think I may have a Panda abuse problem...or I've just convinced myself that its good for me cause it's the only way I can make myself eat veggies!,UNK
3192,Sweet Republic has great ice cream and the staff was very friendly. We got to sample favors before deciding which one to get. The ice cream tasted very fresh! My favorite favor is the Salted Butter Caramel!!!,UNK
3193,We got take out and it was wonderful. Great tuna bowl and fried dumplings!.,UNK
3194,Very good! A unique Italian and menu that allows you to construct your own meatball dish. The second floor does pizza and the third has an partially open-air rooftop bar. Cool place!,UNK
3195,Why aria????? Why?? You had so much potential!!! \n\nPlace is shit!!,UNK
3196,Food was not good at all and they use Texas Toast.   Kids area kind of weird for a bar.\nBeer was not very cold and service was slow.,UNK
3197,Michael was amazing. He was so helpful and cared about our case and took the time to explain everything to us. He was able to resolve our case better than any other Attorney could have. He's a persistent Attorney  who didn't let up on the prosecutor.,UNK
3198,"Just the place I was looking for!. Authentic Mexican, big portions , delicious!",UNK
3199,Their crunch is AMAZING! And thei dragon roll is even better. I love this place for my Dojo and I. You have to go and you wont regret it!,UNK
3200,Loved the food! Lived in Asia for the most part of my life. This is one of the closest thing for a full Dimsum Chinese restaurant.,UNK
3201,Amazing!!! Service is always consistent and welcoming! Food is well portioned and cheap. Small location but cozy!,UNK
3202,Great place to watch a game or just grab a good bite to eat. The prices are reasonable and the amount of food you get for the price is pretty good. I would suggest the wings and the cheese fries...the fries were rather awesome.,UNK
3203,Food not that great burger was dry the Spanish dip way too salty as if they threw the bottle on it. Not worth to eat here but to watch sports its good.,UNK
3204,The best! Happy hour m-f from 1030am to 7? Thats crazy! 2.00 drafts! Specials everyday. All sports on all the time! FOOD IS THE BEST!,UNK
3205,Im a sushi nut. This was just mediocre. Service was good.  Food was fair but overpriced. Highly recommend looking elsewhere for the money,UNK
3206,Great food my go to Thai restaurant.,UNK
3207,Best Asian grocery in Pittsburgh. Went shopping for ingredients for a Korean dish I was making and they had everything. Food is fresh also!,UNK
3208,we call it the crack house because they have to be putting something in it to keep you craving for more. Unbelieveably delicious. I'm about to run out right now and get me some more. love love love my caniac. One love. xoxoxo.,UNK
3209,Food was not good.  App and Entree,UNK
3210,The shampoo session was wonderful.  Demetrio the stylist did a good job on my hair but it did not look like the picture I brought. My hair I'd now too short.,UNK
3211,"Good food and I love all the dipping sauces.  Best gyro I've had on campus.  Not a huge variety of food, though.",UNK
3212,I love tao! they have awesome service...the girls are gorgeous AND know what theyre doing. and if youre with all girls its easy to get a comped bottle,UNK
3213,Excellent food and friendly staff.,UNK
3214,The classic swirl is very good. The topping choices are limited compared to other places but the quality is there. Great yogurt overall and I will be returning.,UNK
3215,"Everything I have ever eaten here has been FABULOUS.  I have tried every curry they serve and it's hot spicy wonderfulness tailored to your own personal heat level.  If you like Thai food, you have to try this place.",UNK
3216,"Gel manicure: $35.00, they chipped after four days. Very disappointed.\nHuge selection of gel colors offered, but they don't actually have all the colors. Picked out three colors that they didn't have.",UNK
3217,Rob was so nice to deal with. I called him on the phone about a computer problem. He walked me through the steps and my computer was fixed.What a nice guy!,UNK
3218,"After getting one of their \""famous\"" burgers, I really don't understand the hype. Mediocre food and mediocre service.",UNK
3219,"Food decent, service lacks. They need to buy our waiter Powers a personality. I will give another.",UNK
3220,My husband went for lunch with a co-worker yesterday and they enjoyed it very much. Keep up the good work.,UNK
3221,do the all you can eat and order the pork belly its a must! i dont care if you dont like pork! the place is always pack so be prepared to wait 20-30mins,UNK
3222,Opened for a couple months then closed down!!! Scammed many people out of their Groupon. And now groupon has to lose money to refund everyone. Shame on this place. Couldn't even last a year and had to resort to scamming.,UNK
3223,"I don't know, it's a nice place, but I really felt that the options were kind of limited, especially for vegetarians. It's also kinda pricey and I paid about $12 for a salad that didn't leave me satisfied.",UNK
3224,"Quite simply, the best.",UNK
3225,"They always have amazing customer service, when I am there.",UNK
3226,"Not great, I would have preferred a frozen pizza instead. Super greasy, not a crispy crust. RUN to Grimaldi's instead!!",UNK
3227,"Did not even eat here because the hostess was so pushy and annoying.  But turned out for the best because we decided to go to another restaurant and while waiting for a table, my gf and I played a slot machine and won $100 right before we got our table at FIX.  Thanks",UNK
3228,The worst. We have a maintenance agreement with them which is a complete scam. They are unprofessional and do not respond quickly to emergency situations. Stay away!,UNK
3229,Dined here the other day for lunch.  I did all you can eat which probably wasn't worth it as it was happy hour and everything is so cheap.  The atmosphere isn't great and the quality is just ok but the service and the price are great.,UNK
3230,"Visiting town from Colorado, my friend and I love Hawaiian restaurants. Moki's was good. Nice menu selection. Got the chicken katsu and short ribs. Pretty good. Ribs were a little tough, and the katsu sauce was t great. A little pricey also.",UNK
3231,The service was great and the food was good. The owner was very friendly and made us feel very welcome as tourists. It was nearly midnight and he was still upbeat and hospitable.,UNK
3232,I had your fried chicken sandwich at the airport.  Needs some work.  Next time I'll try the beef you advertise.,UNK

3235,"Great lunch place with delicious fresh sandwiches, soups and salads and an excellent wait staff.",UNK

3237,This was okay.  Not my favorite zoo or the best but still okay.,UNK
3238,Sing Hi Chicken maybe one of the best in town. Does not matter what else you order but this is a must.\nPlace and location is not the best but go for the food. \nService is generally pretty good and prices are very reasonable,UNK

3242,"Sigh.  I know I'm about to commit Champaign-Urbana blasphemy, but...\n\nI don't get the hype.",UNK
3243,"The night I was there there were way too many sloppy-fall-down-drunks and the crowd looked \""ridden hard and put away wet\"". \n\nIt was like amateur hour at the Roxbury.",UNK
3244,"Would not recommend this dental clinic. I had a root canal that was not properly done, and the crown put on top of it  cracked. It was  temporarily filled, but three months later I had to have the tooth pulled.  They definitely are not afraid to charge for their services.",UNK
3245,Its a bank.. Most of the tellers are friendly they get you in and out. Get any questions answered.,UNK
3246,"Couldn't really get a feel for the place as I wasn't let in b/c  was wearing a tanktop.\n\nHowever, I do suggest you wear an affliction shirt. Seems to be the uniform.",UNK

3248,italian food at its best. and the complementary antipasta salad and bread earns this place 7 stars in my mind.,UNK
3249,"We LOVE hot bagel, the food is delicious. We will go on the weekend and get the bagel, egg, meat and cheese.  The bagels have a nice taste and are a change from the store bought type.",UNK
3250,11$ for a spicy tuna roll .... During happy hour ... That's all I have to say ... I can go across the street for 25$ all you can eat,UNK
3251,closed. out of business,UNK
3252,"I went to Mariana last month for a cut and have been meaning to give her a rave review. I only trust a very limited number people with my hair, and Mariana has joined the ranks. She listens to what you want and delivers an amazing style. And so reasonably priced.",UNK
3253,Gods breakfast in a cool small town cafe atmosphere. Recommend this to everyone! Forget the chain restaurants and come here for breakfast or lunch. Dinner is available on Thursday and Friday nights.,UNK
3254,"I am probably not the target demographic for this bar, but still decided to stop in one Saturday afternoon for a drink and some quick eats.  The food was cheap and actually pretty decent and they had a good selection of beer.  Nice bartenders too!",UNK
3255,"I went the other day to get some of my jewelry appraised, they only offered me $8 a gram for 18k gold, (it's worth $31 a gram) !!! What a rip off!",UNK
3256,I think that was just about the worst meal I ever ate.\nI ended up throwing half of it away.\nYuck,UNK
3257,"good, had the kobe burger but i couldnt tell the difference in tase compared to a normal beef burger.",UNK
3258,Visited this place months ago.  Loved the stuffed shells.  Patio all lit up at night was a romantic touch.,UNK
3259,"This place was awesome! They offered great prices for our quick civil ceremony, the customer service was perfect especially DaNella Ketcham the manager and Minister Richard made it very special!",UNK
3260,"Great Carne Asada and Chicken Tacos. \nSimple menu, REALLY well prepared food.\nSalsa and Condiment Bar was a win. \nCrowded interior (because the food is so good)",UNK
3261,I got pushed here from the flamingo for a night. Even though it's free don't do it. Pay to go elsewhere.  Service was terrible. Check in was forever long and there was no expedite for total reward tiers.,UNK
3262,stopped in for breakfast today and the food was cold. the chicken was old and tasted so nasty.\n\nwill not return,UNK
3263,"This place was a huge disappointment. The pizza was simply horrible, the salad disgusting and low quality but the wings weren't bad. \nJust the same with so many great places around I won't be back.",UNK
3264,"perhaps the worst steakhouse in Vegas! while service is great, atmosphere is dark with blue lighting and the food was average even though you can barely see it on the plate. only go here if you get comped which is unlikely if you're playing at the Palms!",UNK
3265,"People that know me know that I am really not a huge fan of pizza so, I went to Grimaldi's not expecting much because it is always the same. Wow I was wrong here. Great thin crispy but not too crunchy crunch with great wood fired taste. Very good.",UNK
3266,Really nice place. Great beers on tap.,UNK
3267,Not a big fan but Tax free yeah!  Off base has more selection and you can find deals. Unless your buying a high price item i would shop elsewhere. The lines get bad so don't be in a rush.,UNK
3268,Was excited to come here. Brought kids. Awful service. Nasty. Got sick. Do not recommend.,UNK
3269,"Just called the nurse's station phone lime provided on the web site to ask a few questions. Probably the rudest woman in Nevada to answer the phone. Could not believe what I was hearing. Called Thursday around 10:20 AM - January 1, 2015",UNK
3270,Good drinks and drink specials. Food is rather bland and boring compared to mad mex.,UNK
3271,This location is the main Borders in the Las Vegas Valley.  They have the largest book selection and that is all they sell.  Don't expect a large music or DVD selection as this one primarily focuses on books.,UNK
3272,My first and last visit. Beer selection marginal. Shepard's pie was obviously frozen and microwaved. Center was cold and greasy,UNK
3273,Great happy hour in a great location!  Perfect for drinks before a game with friends.,UNK
3274,"This place gave me the shits, like pissin outta my ass kinda shits. I went there right after new years for a chicken club and the flatbread was stale and tomatoes were definitely not fresh like the hills of Mangolia. The smoothie was good though.",UNK
3275,"The food is really good. However, the service could use some improvement. It felt like the server lacked people skills. Otherwise everything else was decent.",UNK
3276,Great burger and the kid's meal is plenty of food for just $6,UNK
3277,"very good pizza , would return",UNK
3278,"Nice decor, friendly staff",UNK
3279,"Fantastic food, amazing service. Very clean. Great place to come for breakfast or lunch if you are staying on the strip. Came two days in a row!",UNK
3280,"This is really a locals type establishment. The owner, Dan is very talented and know pizzas. Everything I'd from scratch and tastes awesome. Oh, also if you're staying in a hotel on the las Vegas strip, yep he delivers there. Enjoy Seattle Dans. I sure did",UNK
3281,If I could give them a negative star I would. The customer service was rude and I didn't end up getting the car that I already prepaid for. I'm still waiting on the supervisor to call back with my refund.,UNK
3282,this is our favorite location...the theatres and facilities are always spotless.  the staff is always friendly and the seats comfortable.,UNK
3283,Too crowded for a lunch time errand. Sub-par interior cleaning jobs. Classic car  on Scottsdale Rd is much better for not much more... Headed there next time.,UNK
3284,Great supermarket...has most foods that you need from around the world at really good prices,UNK
3285,Wings were not good.  They did not have any celery. Wait staff seemed distracted and not all that interested.\n\nLots of TVs for you sports aficianados.,UNK
3286,"OK I went to this place for their photobooth hoping for a old school film one but alas, they only have a digital photobooth :(",UNK
3287,ordered a pizza an some pasta.  Gnocci was ok.  not the best we had but not bad by any means.  we had a pizza on another trip and it was pretty good. not the best in the valley but wood fired so that is a bonus.  Good for carry out.,UNK
3288,"I love how this theatre is close to everything, but you can always find a parking spot and the theatre is never crowded. I just wish they (and all other movie theatres) would show movies at 8pm instead of 7 and 9.",UNK
3289,"I love this team, but really.  Someone needs to help them, big time.",UNK
3290,"Ridiculously long line for just an \""average\"" buffet. Price was ok, food was nothing to brag about. Would not come back.",UNK
3291,"Incompetent, rude, offensive, and zero responsibility. I've been a discount customer for a long time but this location is horrible.",UNK
3292,ZERO!!!\nCame here at 9:40pm. The gal told me they were taking to go orders only but she they supposedly close at 10pm. Really? I wont be back. \nThere's too many restaurants to choose from around here...,UNK
3293,"Upside: big, lots of stores, & great selection! Downside:  most of the toilets are broke, vending machines take money, & the little kiddie ride they have are either broke or takes your money!",UNK
3294,"This place sucks. \n\nOver priced. Sub par quality food. But the subs have cute pot related names and there's posters on the wall, so let's deal with it.",UNK
3295,Love this spot for a good lunch! Great salads and fresh sandwhiches !! Its my daily lunch! im in love! keep it up!!,UNK
3296,Ok.  Not great for what is supposedly a good steak joint.  Not much ambiance and food was good not great.,UNK
3297,"Hidden location in a dead strip mall. We came in for dipped cones, which were delicious---as expected. Service was fast and friendly. Would recommend this location.",UNK
3298,Worst place to go and every part of this experience is bad from buying a ticket to staff and so on - rent a car and drive yourself. They will not honor your discounts and customer service does not exists at all. You are better off avoiding this place at all cost.,UNK
3299,DON'T EAT HERE. My regular size gelato with 2 flavors cost $14 DOLLARS. Are you kidding me? DON'T EAT HERE.,UNK
3300,"Went there today with 4 colleagues, one of which is from Jordan. The food was hearty and delicious. I suggest as a rule getting the special of the day or a couple of the sides. The kunafa was delicious.",UNK
3301,A bit seedy but the drinks are cheap and I won $40.00 bucks!!,UNK
3302,Breakfast AND Dinner are amazing! The staff is pretty wonderful too! A+,UNK
3303,"Airports are like prisons. You ever been to jail? If you've gone through TSA, you know what jail is like.",UNK
3304,"Honestly, the worst service I've ever had. Tried it more than once, and I will never return.",UNK
3305,It's a beautiful facility but it's 9:00 p.m. and 107 degrees outside with zero breeze!!!,UNK
3306,"Overrated and definitely not worth the money.   Spent thousands and was still treated like crap.  With Light and Hakkasan now in play, this place is losing its luster.",UNK
3307,Best Chines in the area. Chicago had some of the best local Chinese I've eaten to date.,UNK
3308,Very friendly and good selection,UNK
3309,"Very nice menu and atmosphere, worth trying.\nIn our case, the side dish was cold, hmm.\nKitchen and staff did their best to make it right, but still...",UNK
3310,"Fit what I needed at the time, place needs more workers, the one girl has to take the order, make the food, take the money, make change, deliver food- all before she can take the next order. Not efficient!",UNK
3311,"Highly recommended!  I ate pho combination. First, the broth so tasty but light. And service was amazing, fast, friendly. \nThen I ordered to go tofu fried spicy chef specialty (I think). It was awesone!!!",UNK
3312,Prices at this location are generally higher then others,UNK
3313,"Terrible food. All food was served in a plastic tub and clearly had just been sitting under a heat lamp for hours. Skip the breakfast all together. Pink berry, Jamba Juice and several other great breakfast spots near concourse C and D.",UNK
3314,Fantastic food! It's all your favouries with a twist! Best Restaurant pulled pork ever! It is covered with a great cajun coleslaw! Just fantastic! You will be a regular too!,UNK
3315,"Gets better every time I go.\n\nLove the waiters, they are awesome!\n\nI got my own chop sticks also!!! WooooooooT!!! :)",UNK
3316,Closed...time to take it off the website!,UNK
3317,"Had a fabulous dinner here.  Service and food was great, enjoyed the surf & turf, which was incredibly delicious and very reasonably priced.",UNK
3318,"We came here for taco Tuesday. After waiting almost an hour and a half we were thinking, \""well you can't really go wrong with dollar tacos\"".... then La Paz did. I've been here a handful of times and have consistently gotten bad service.",UNK
3319,They do a good job. Best in the area. Student grooms save you $,UNK
3320,"The marinated pork tacos are the best I have personal ever had hands down.  Still not a fan of there decision of having split lines for different tacos, but its worth it!",UNK
3321,They are getting better here.   The food arrived quickly and they have a new ordering board which is nice.  My burger was better than it has been in the past.  The cobb salad was very good.,UNK
3322,"Reserved room a week in advance and requested 11am early check in, is now 3:45pm and we've been waiting at the resort all day. Classic bad business: under delivering after over promising. The Grand just a few miles away seems like a much better option.",UNK
3323,I was NOT impressed.  Thank God we had a Groupon because if I would have paid full price I would have been livid. The salad was mediocre at best. The dressing looked like mayo and the pizza was all dough. I do not recommend this place at all.,UNK
3324,"In my opinion the pizza here is better than Aiello's, but the staff is impersonal. Take the awesome people at Aiello's & combine with this pizza & it's a home run.",UNK
3325,We had three entrees and unanimously agreed that if we gave it to our dogs; they'd no longer be our best friends.   The meat was overcooked and it was like Samurai Sam karate chopped my intestines.  Summary - Meh on its best day.,UNK
3326,The prices can't be beat. For 3 dollars you can enjoy almost any sub on the menu. The bread is baked fresh and so is the other baked goods.,UNK
3327,"The view was spectacular and the whole experience was amazing. I only give it 3 stars because I didn't think the food measured up to the price. however, I think what you're paying for is the experience. I'm glad I went once, but I probably wouldn't go back.",UNK
3328,This is another very good Charlotte Library.  The wireless connectivity is quite good.  The collection of music and movies is very good. (South Regional might be a little better)  This is an oasis in the commercial wasteland that is Southpark.,UNK
3329,"This place is sorta pricey but the food, oh man, the food is soooo freakin' good. Especially if you love eggs and pancakes!",UNK
3330,Went to Paseo verde location,UNK
3331,Ughhh DANA IS EFFIN RUDE! \nAnd needs to be retrained on customer service or she needs to be fired ASAP! \nBut the food is awesome! Just need better servers ! Kay thanks bye!,UNK
3332,"Music terrible food way over priced 39 dollar rib eye should not be paper thin , the venue was off the hook should have been a great experience but you can't judge a book by it cover!",UNK
3333,I had the Breakfast Burrito for lunch and it was excellent. The service was friendly but not very responsive. Everyone in our group liked what they ordered.\n\nDespite the service I'd definitely go back and try some of the other menu items I was eyeing.,UNK
3334,"Service was okay, at best. I wouldn't go there again.  They quoted me at thousands of dollars of repairs for my car to pass inspection.  I took it somewhere else and had it done for a fraction of the quote.",UNK
3335,Cool hip spot off strip. Strong drinks amazing mini hotdog bites in bean dip. Deslish. Waitresses there are fun and friendly. I had a blast 2 nights there!  Downside was the beer selection. If they had better craft beers it would have been a 5 star,UNK
3336,"I came here on a Sunday afternoon. My waiter was on point and did a great job. The food was good, but I can't say I really enjoy the decor. Overall I enjoyed my lunch and I would come back.",UNK
3337,"Sandwich was pretty decent for a sandwich, got into a odd conversion about how she doesn't support yelp and supports some ihateyelp.com or whatever.... I honestly stopped paying attention and just wanted to eat. Will be back to try the soup!",UNK
3338,"Far from the strip, casino tower was old, noisy, service was poor. Casino tower bathrooms were dated.\n\nI came here for a conference, and would not have otherwise. If they hold another conference there next year, I will be staying on the strip to cab it there.",UNK
3339,The Mint Chocolate Almond Concrete is always made perfect!!!,UNK
3340,Burgers were good and the service was fine.  For whatever reason it sort of reminded me of Outback Steakhouse--only a Hawaiian version.  The cheese fries are very similar.,UNK
3341,Helpful customer service folks and even extra people on duty when the ATM was down.  If only the real estate aspect of Chase was as good as the banking side.,UNK
3342,this is pretty cool poker room.. a few different tournaments everyday.. and the $1/$2 tables is pretty good.. the crowd however tends be all guys.. but i guess that's with poker in general,UNK
3343,Great service,UNK
3344,"Great new restaurant in the area.  Food is good, and if you live at Shade, be sure to let the waiter know, 25% off your bill.",UNK
3345,I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PLACE!!! The atmosphere will put you into a completely different time warp! The food by Chef GARCIA is mouth watering! Trust me...order the MUSSELS!!!,UNK
3346,"I'm disappointed nearly every time I go here. Store is just too small. Variety sucks, prices suck. Why does it have to be so close??",UNK
3347,I have eaten here multiple times and my meal has always been fresh and good tasting. The mountain high mud pie is always great if you have the room for it after dinner!,UNK
3348,"I'm not a huge fan of this restaurant.  The biggest disappointment is that the shakes taste artificially flavored.  \n\nThe is the authentic Steak 'n Shake experience, in the Las Vegas desert.  If you love this chain, this has the same quality food and dining experience.",UNK
3349,Wish I could give 0 stars. This is the slowest chipotle I've ever been to. Plus they skimp on everything. Avoid at all cost.,UNK
3350,"My chai wasn't as tasty as other places, but was drinkable. Friend said that it is not her experience...maybe a bad make.",UNK
3351,"The Clubhouse has a lap pool and a beach pool. The scenery is really pretty with the waterfalls and greenery surrounding and makes a nice setting for a private party or wedding. The staff is nice, but not always helpful.",UNK
3352,"They gave my dad two new teeth! No more russian sailor smile! The doctors seems very patient and undrestanding, and gave him a ton of reading material and instruction. He said the surgery was easy, and loved it.",UNK
3353,Love this place. Come often because the service amazing. Even when they're busy or understaffed they try to take care of everyone. The happy hour of awesome and 5 dollar byob until 10. Always a good experience!,UNK
3354,Thought we would try a new place to watch a game and grab lunch.  It just plain sucked.  Lots of great sports bars in Vegas.  This ain't one of them.,UNK
3355,Super watered down wing sauce leaves it with no taste. Asked for extra sauce on pizza didn't get it. Other than those issues pizza is ok.,UNK
3356,Wonderful. Food as good as the big brother without the white table cloths. Will certainly be back.,UNK
3357,Lunch special soup tasted like diluted fish sauce. The  pad Thai is just noodles with peanuts and hardly any bean sprouts--very watery and tasteless.,UNK
3358,"This store is awesome! They have everything shoes, bathing suits, jewelry, and of course sex toys. The workers are very helpful and friendly. They also have classes that are taught by certified sex therapist. This store is huge. It's very clean and well put together.",UNK
3359,"I am now aware of the fact that they do not charge covers on the weekends...\n\nThis being the case, I could now possibly see myself dropping by for one cocktail on a Mill avenue binge session, but just one.",UNK
3360,i love this place! it's such a cute little restaurant and the food is amazing =] loved all the rolls and appetizers that we tried and the service was great. highly recommend it!,UNK
3361,Love this place! ! Will never go anywhere else ever again!!,UNK
3362,I've been to several locations and this one was by far te best. The bartenders were friendly who made really strong margaritas. My favorite part is the cat walk that you can drink your drinks on and yell at people on the street walking by. Always a good time.,UNK
3363,"I love the soup here!  I would go here just for that! Beyond the soup, it is definitely one of the better buffet's in Charlotte.  A little on the pricey side but well worth it in my opinion!",UNK
3364,Anytime here must get Gator..a little spicy but very good.  Good drinks and sometimes a band.,UNK
3365,"YES - this is well worth a stop on the way home from Las Vegas. Not much on ambiance, but the food here is absolutely terrific! Just go with the daily special.",UNK
3366,"Awesome location, acceptable beer selection, very good pub food. Clean and spacious inside, patio heaters make the outside seating area really comfortable. And it's about a block from one of the greatest city views in America! I'll definitely be back.",UNK
3367,"Terrible food. Naan bread wasn't fully cooked, nor did it taste good. The beef samosas were dry and too deep fried, and the beef curry wasn't anything special. Worst Indian food I have ever had.",UNK
3368,Dark dank bar with not much going on. Workers were not overly friendly. Live music is on the weekends and it is typically heavy metal.,UNK
3369,"Pretty loud and the food is good but not quite great although I guess the main reason one would come here is for some authentic German beer which this place delivers to perfection.  Fun, but not a place I would go out of my way to visit every time I am here.",UNK
3370,Pizza isn't bad but they could be friendlier. Also it would be nice to know that ranch is additional when you pay-it is inconvenient to pay extra what you use credit. Service was okay.,UNK
3371,"got very sick from the food, it was awful, especially the dip, they had cooked it with something and it made me very sick.",UNK
3372,"Don't ever try their wonton noodles , it tasted exactly like the instant wonton noodles except that it was worse.",UNK
3373,I just called for a quote to clean windows and base boards. The lady who I spoke with was hard to talk to and then hung up when I decided not to go with them.,UNK
3374,Too bad I checked yelp having having ordered...worst place ever. Go to Burger King across the hall for less greasy and more tasteful food. Absolutely disgusting,UNK
3375,"Very friendly and professional. Excellent value, but the service doesn't suffer for such a low price. Will definitely go again!",UNK
3376,"Custard pancake was delicious, fluffy with a sweet custard taste. 2 stars for sloooooow service and a very forgetful waiter. Pricey for the overall experience.",UNK
3377,rooms really big nice and clean. awsome for bachlors party.,UNK
3378,"This has been my second Yelp event. It was great! I'm a craft person and a jewelry fanatic, but then again what girl isn't. They had a lot of booths with my exact taste! I loved it and I'll definetly be going back!",UNK
3379,completely worthless wifi.,UNK
3380,Meh.\nPork chop with eggs was dry. Bread had a very salty butter. Buddies steak was good. Don't care to go back.,UNK
3381,No happy hour or 15% discount from hotel because it was a Coyotes game day.\nHerb Crusted Chicken was over cooked so it was dry but at least the baked potato was ok. Service was good she kept my drink filled.,UNK
3382,I agree with the staff review...very plain and robotic. Payless has come a far way. I never used to shop for shoes here because they were such cheap quality but have gotten a lot better!! I come here mainly for the jewelry! Great prices and cute styles!,UNK
3383,"pretty laid back, good drinks and food. a couple times i went and the misters were broken and leaking. otherwise, like it",UNK
3384,What is not to love about this store.  Great finds if you are willing to dig.  I just hate the lines you have to wait in to check out.,UNK
3385,"Awful, dirty, food not cooked all the way, shakes are with syrups!!!awful.  Will never go there again, workers are rude.",UNK
3386,I had a wonderful massage experience with Anna. I had the Thai combination which incorporated stretching and hot stones. This would be a great choice for athletes because of the stretching; it was akin to physical therapy in a way. Highly recommend! Reasonably priced too.,UNK
3387,Best fajitas ever! Love this place! Love the food! Love the the environment!  Great place to take your family!,UNK
3388,"The food's fresh, the service is good and we eat here fairly frequently. We like the baja burrito with fried fish :)",UNK
3389,"Even the smaller theaters are nice here :) Life of Pi should be very interesting. I'm ready for an adventure outside of my life. I get caught into movies and forget about all outside worries, specially here at this cinema :)",UNK
3390,Great atmosphere and good food...that's affordable!  Don't forget to check out the rooftop area!,UNK
3391,I don't know how many times you need to call me to harass me that My prescription  is ready but I am pretty sure once is enough. It would also be nice if when you call you put someone on the phone that speaks proper English.,UNK
3392,All bad...bad service...bad Sushi...never again...tell your servers to serve and stop watching the tvs ... :(,UNK
3393,Great service and yummy desserts!  I love Thrifty's ice cream so this brought me back to the good ole days. So many choices! I will definitely be back.,UNK
3394,"The size of their 5$ gyros are ridiculous. So much food, and solid too. Good staff",UNK
3395,"Valet parking is terrible.  Had to wait 40 minutes for my car and that is with calling ahead.  OH, and they raised the price from$19 to $28 for that excellent service.",UNK
3396,"What a nice place to have a special meal done with an artistic touch, served with an exotic juice, to make you feel the indulgence of the city. Orders are served particularly fast.",UNK
3397,really good pizza indeed,UNK
3398,Very poor food quality. Veal tasted like cold boxed foods. This place use to be great but no longer. Good STAFF and great view. Go for a drink but avoid the food.,UNK
3399,I have been to this Dollar Tree location on a number of occasions and I have to admit it's one of my least favorites in town. They rarely have a good selection and more often than not I walk out empty handed.,UNK
3400,Great place for a date night...,UNK
3401,I hate that I have to come here for my packages now. This is the slowest post office aside from downtown.,UNK
3402,"eeew. It started with a cranky waiter who told me that if I wanted to know the specials, then I should have read them on the board. The food was downhill from there. The entire place smelled like fried onions.",UNK
3403,"Why do they call this a resort?  One lousy convenience shop.  One lousy restaurant.  An old dated lobby.  With all the choices at the casinos, where the facilities are newer and rooms cheaper, I cannot see why you would want to come here.",UNK
3404,If you have a hankering for chicken strips this is the place to go!  Lots of options for dipping sauces and perfect atmosphere for kids!,UNK
3405,"LOUD, overpriced and under portioned. Waste of money. Walk out the casino front door and cross the street and go to McDonalds. I'm so disappointed!",UNK
3406,Helpful staff! This is what I like to see!!! Love the selection and the staff was very great in helping me and my Auntie find what we needed :D,UNK
3407,"This space is fantastic, great prices and great service.  Willy is the only barber I will go to from now on.  Best fade and straight razor on the valley.  I am sure that everyone at the shop is fantastic but Willy has bar none given me the best cut I have had in a long time.",UNK
3408,I always come here to buy the TDK DVD-R 100pk when they are on sale. This week they are only $17.99. \n\nThe staff is always friendly and helpful every time I shop here.,UNK
3409,Not a good experience. Left my iced coffee in the counter without calling my name. Messed up my order. Too busy with their LOUD conversation about wanting to leave early!! No wonder this place is always empty!!,UNK
3410,"Never a bad meal here. Cheap , but great sandwiches. Several sides to choose from. Line always goes fast. I always seem to get there before the line starts which is a bonus.  24/7 is a huge plus as well. I always get the Ham and Swiss",UNK
3411,Awesome bar happy hour with decent food offerings and drinks. Very cool interior and atmosphere. Restaurant is amazing too.,UNK
3412,A very friendly neighborhood place. The food is good and the atmosphere is relaxed and comfortable.,UNK
3413,The surf and turf with bison and tiger prawn shrimp was delicious! Great atmosphere but a little pricey. My sushi came out wrong the first time so that's why I'm giving it 4 of 5 stars. The food was definitely fresh!,UNK
3414,Boyfriend brought a box of assorted goodies home but everything seemed to taste the same and I guess it was too sugary and you couldn't tell the difference between each dessert since the sugar overpowered the flavors,UNK
3415,"great food, friendly staff, great management. They make me feel like family. I recommend the Mahi Mango Sandwich for lunch, the Hawaiian Gone Fishing and Drunk Shrimp apps and their rice, beans, salsas and homemade sauces are wonderful.",UNK
3416,"Better than average sushi w/nice selection in wonderful ambience.  Veggie food leaves a lot to be desired.  Nice salads, ramens and cooked Japanese dishes.  Friendly and efficient staff.",UNK
3417,"Randy's is highly recommended. After purchasing and (subsequently breaking) a specialty tool, necessary for a repair, a friend recommended Randy's and they got us out of a bind. They were incredibly knowledgeable and helpful. They had us in and out in no time.",UNK
3418,Dirty. Two cashiers and neither came to clean after I told them. It was not busy as I posted pics. Somebody needs ti reevaluate their employee choices!,UNK
3419,"Too inconsistent for me.  Crust tends to be overcooked so if like that, this is the place.  Ingredients are fine, especially the sausage.  NYC atmosphere is interesting and seating area small but adequate.",UNK
3420,I stop in as often as I can.  My favorite dish is the Hummus Deluxe.  The Baklava is rich and delicious.,UNK
3421,Server and food was very great. Everything was nice except the hostess was not very friendly. Made me not want to eat there at all (at least in my opinion).,UNK
3422,"Fast, accommodating service and food was  great. Our server , Rosa, was delightful and eager to make sure our impromptu birthday dinner for my 10 year old went great. The did a great job accommodating food allergies too.",UNK
3423,Bought my bong here. Lots of choices. Has everything you need to get ripped. True smoke store.,UNK
3424,Very low key kool area. A salon right across and beanch to sit on in front of the wondow. Overall it is like being in San Diego Ca.,UNK
3425,Such a shame this location is slated to close! \n\nBye electronics!\nBye discounted DVDs!\nBye more jobs in Ed... :-(,UNK
3426,The food tasted great. However the service was awful. Our waiter scolded us for asking him to split the check. We were all in disbelief and couldn't believe it was happening.,UNK
3427,very expensive better seafood at Harris Teeter very small selection,UNK
3428,Great service and competitive rates!,UNK
3429,First time visitor.  Food was very good.  Service was very slow.,UNK
3430,"It's my first time writing review on yelp, I feel like this place deserves 5 star!\nGreat owner,  clean, and best of all awesome food!\nI'll definitely be back!\nThank you, keep up the good work!",UNK
3431,Fantastic place! Dr. Hardy is incredibly gentle and professional. I just had a root canal performed today and wanted to write about my positive experience. I couldn't have asked for a better endodontist!! They are the best!!!!,UNK
3432,"Our usual place for take out and my \""lunch date\"" days with my toddler. Free soda with the lunch special is always a plus. Staff is friendly, food is good, and it's close to home.",UNK
3433,Closed. Number out of service. This is the same place as http://www.yelp.com/biz/korea-house-bbq-las-vegas,UNK
3434,Just not what we expected. Leaky toilet and wallpaper coming of the walls. I called about the toilet and got told to call back. Just pathetic of a major hotel in Vegas.,UNK
3435,"I just been here once customer service like shit never seen before , waiter throw food on the table. Food taste not good at all. Will never ever come back. Guys dont go here....",UNK
3436,it is ok. if it wasn't close to my house I wouldn't go there.,UNK
3437,"Total let down.  None of the charm of the one on Camelback. Not sure if the people who work here have ever even been to the original to understand what is all about.  Seems like every other Scottdale joint.  Yuppy, played out and lame.",UNK
3438,Great location and great rooms!  Nice sized rooms with three flat screen tvs and luxurious decor.  I have one HUGE gripe about this hotel... a hotel of this class and with so many conventions/meetings should NOT charge for internet in the rooms!!!,UNK
3439,"I stopped in here yesterday for a quick lunch.  I dine here at least once every couple of months.  Always great service, good specials, and tasty food.",UNK
3440,Nice and relaxed. Not to stuffy. Very Casual. I will come back for a quick bite with a glass of wine.,UNK
3441,Great place.  Great food...piping hot and delicious.  Excellent service.  House chianti was exceptional too.  I would just request to sit on the left side when you come in.  It looked to be quieter over there.  The right side is adjacent to the open kitchen.,UNK
3442,"Horrible place. The food was so-so, it was the management. They harassed and discriminated against me because I have a sight service animal. What they did was illegal by state and federal law. They should be ashamed.",UNK
3443,"Simply stated, the food here was absolutely delicious! The food is very savory and the staff is incredibly pleasant. It was a pleasure to dine here and I look forward to future visits!",UNK
3444,Breakfast buffet for 16.50 with all regular delicious breakfast item. Good deal and the place is beautiful.,UNK
3445,"The show is great! And that's the only good thing in the hotel!. The buffet was very very poor, not better even than any $10 Chinese buffet. If you think MGM buffet was poor, come to TL to see what's really poor!",UNK
3446,My friend and I came here and we did not like the spa. We had couple's massage and it wasn't that great. The massage was super expensive ($180 for a couple's Swedish massage) for the quality of the place. We will definitely not be returning.,UNK
3447,"cool bar, good bar snacks as well as food. kind of tucked away in the shoppes.",UNK
3448,"Great outdoor seating.  The interior was definitely someone's residence at some point.  Plenty of TVs for games.  The heat lamps outside and bar outside was key.  Beer selection was average, and we didn't have any of the food.  Overall an excellent time at the selwyn pub",UNK
3449,"Very friendly staff and the service was decent.  The food is good, but I thought it was expensive for what you get.",UNK
3450,"little disappointed with the waiters recommendation of the sea bass.. quite citrusy and unimaginative overall  with just those sliced cherry tomatoes, red and yellow.. the fish was not fresh.. I have to say the the large meatball appetizer was really nice..",UNK
3451,"Awesome employees, amazing beer selection, you don't get ignored even if they're busy, the food is top notch, it's in a great location, and it's always clean. Can't get much better than that.",UNK
3452,"$2 Miller Lights.  I love this place.  Hopefully some corporate giant doesn't bulldoze this down into an \""ultraresort.spa.casino.spot\"" or whatever they aim for.",UNK
3453,"Good food, competent staff.  Omelets made with egg whites so a little healthier then most.",UNK
3454,"Course was in ok shape except for standing water in the majority of the bunkers. Prices were reasonable, but they jammed packed too many groups and we were way backed up.",UNK
3455,"Great location! No road noise, beautiful sunsets over the lake and wonderful New Mexican cooking. We had the green chill meatloaf and garlic mashed potatoes and washed it down with some Odells craft brew. Can't wait to try more of the many interesting menu items.",UNK
3456,"Smelly and old interior, their Clarion which is attacked to the same building is newer and better! I requested a wake up call, they didn't set one for me, luckily i had back up, otherwise i would had missed my flight out of this dump",UNK
3457,"went to Texas de Brasil on Tuesday evening, had the best time. food is always amazing. Our server was Kristen, who was extremely friendly, pleasant and attentive, but was also very professional. the entire staff was great. but if you go, ask for Kristen, she is the best!!",UNK
3458,"Great food, but unfortunately we had terrible server experience.  Not impressed if I'm willing to pay that much.  Will not return.",UNK
3459,Crappiest service ever! If they is even a remote chance you may return something go somewhere else or look at every bit of fine print on your receipt. Never shopping at a Radio Shack again!,UNK
3460,Super great people and great mom/pop breakfast joint. Enjoyed their chicken fried steak & corn beef hash.,UNK
3461,I love using the Lemon Sage thickening spray. It is light and doesn't make your hair stiff. I also bought the shampoo and am excited to try it out too!,UNK
3462,"Fantastic crepes, friendly place.",UNK
3463,this is now a mexican bar w/ a hot dog cart out front on the weekends. Marinos De Camillo or something like that. Very small parking lot but the only bar in the neighborhood,UNK
3464,Very beautiful view from the dinning patio with waterfall and different kinds of wild flowers. Open from 6am-11am for breakfast. They have buffet and off the menu breakfast. The orange blueberry pancake is a must. They also brew Starbucks coffee!,UNK
3465,Really good tacos but overpriced for what it is.,UNK
3466,"I love the place simply because the food is very good for the price, its just that simple, not to mention Victor is my BOIIII...",UNK
3467,"Great food but the wait staff is off putting, our waitress  seemed  bored and not wanting to be their with a rushed attitude towards us. Unfortunately I was hopping this would be my go to neighborhood restaurant but scratch that idea.",UNK
3468,"This place used to be the best. It's gone downhill. Service is not very good and food isn't what it used to be, won't go back now that there's better places like Khoury's and Yassou's.",UNK
3469,A couple of weeks ago I walked past here on a Saturday afternoon and there was a forensic police officer collecting evidence from the doorway. \n\nI think that sums up this bar quite nicely.,UNK
3470,Love Jamba juice!! Stop in one day at 7pm ish and it was happy hour! Not sure if they still offer it but regardless I would still come in to get my fix! Try the WHITE GUMMY BEAR!,UNK
3471,"The food was great, loved the set up and fresh air feel. My big disappointment and an important aspect was the service. Got my drink order wrong, never checked to see if order was okay or if we needed anything until we were finished. Will think twice before I go back to this location.",UNK
3472,"I love their food, just wish they would drain/sop the oil off the fries prior to serving them.",UNK
3473,Pad Thai was great...i think it was $18. It took a while to get it after I ordered it though...only complaint.,UNK
3474,"Food is above average.  The staff seems a bit too casual for my taste.  I know it's a take-out/quick service \""restaurant\"", but talking to the guy in line in front of you about getting wasted isn't really my thing.",UNK
3475,"Food is good,  but the fried rice had a burnt taste to me,  My sister said it's good but It tasted funny to me.  But overall everything else we had was good",UNK
3476,"The food is good. The service is spotty. If it's packed, I'd go some where else. I recommend coming to this place and ordering a skillet. Food's got flavor.",UNK
3477,Great show full menu and bar.,UNK
3478,just. delicious. go. here.,UNK
3479,"Usually love this place until the last time we were there, all the fish were dead or dying in the fish tank display.....very turned off.",UNK
3480,The ramen and crispy shrimp ball are very delicious. Good place! Good food! Definitely we will come back.,UNK
3481,Went in on a HOT Arizona afternoon for some cold brewski and snacks. The air conditioning was borderlne cold!!   YAY!   Felt wonderful.  Really comfortable.  Great bartender and waitress.  We loved it!,UNK
3482,$1 burgers and $3 drafts will be missed.\nOther than that the place is good to watch the game and drink.\nThe tavern itself will be missed here in vegas,UNK
3483,Their pizza is great. I lived in NYC and have also spent a good amount of time in Italy. I feel I can be the judge of a damn good pizza now.,UNK
3484,Its not bad. If you feel the need to gamble. Waitress' are fast if your tipping.But all in all not bad. The bartenders are a little slow.,UNK
3485,I don't care what part of town you live in... make the drive. this store is the best. this is not young kids selling smoking supplies. These are conosueres who accualy give a shit about their product and,UNK
3486,Staff was professional and personable. The food was average. The experience was fun. The price for the evening was not worth it. I would return if the prices were a bit lower. This place is over priced for what you get.,UNK
3487,"The maple bacon doughnut was tasty, but the cherry fritter blew. my. mind. My iced coffee was decent as well. I anticipate returning to rainbow doughnuts!",UNK
3488,Great spicy veggie soup. Service is quick and friendly!,UNK
3489,I've been here several times and I would not recommend it.  The quality of food is sub par and I find the service to be unfriendly and a little arrogant.  I've given it atleast 5 chances which I think is fair.,UNK
3490,"Tasty food, friendly staff, fun atmosphere to watch soccer. The lamb stew, wings, and pastrami reuben were all deeelish. Be forewarned, the hot wings are no joke.",UNK
3491,"Our neighborhood coffee house....  Perfect with the drive thru window too!  Nice staff and always clean. My only concern is they are so popular, they tend to run out of items!!!!  Stock up, specially during the holidays",UNK
3492,"Food was good, beacon wrapped filet was great. Kinda disappointed about the salad bar and sides but would definitely come back if I had a craving for too much red meat.  Service was fine, seating was kinda a close.",UNK
3493,Great teachers but the lady in the front doesn't have a friendly attitude! They need better customer service if they expect people to stick around.,UNK
3494,Great spot for coffee or tea in the morning. Very interesting choices. Very nice help. Lots of souvenir items too.,UNK
3495,This place seems to appeal to an older crowd (late 30s/early 40s) The best thing about partying here is the view of the fountains outside the big window.,UNK
3496,"Really, really good Dim Sum, staff is great, some items get lost\n in translation, but so far everything we have ate has been great!",UNK
3497,Service was slow. Chili's food is bland.,UNK
3498,Still nice after all these years - though the indoor/outdoor thing is still a little creepy.,UNK
3499,"okay so the veal was \""good\"", but to advertise as good for kids and not have booster or high chairs is a stretch to say the least.",UNK
3500,Eh. The food is kind of bland and the staff wasn't very attentive. The only good thing there is boba tea which is probably the only reason I'll go back.,UNK
3501,"By far the worst manicure pedicure I have ever received. They rough, rude and provide low grade services. I actually need to file my nails to be even and my gel manicure was globbed on. Better luck doing your own nails.",UNK
3502,"Pho broth is delicious, spring rolls were great. \n\nOn the expensive side for pho, but location is great. Seating is tight as it's a small restaurant.",UNK
3503,A nice place to catch a little music on the patio.,UNK
3504,"I wasn't impressed. The meat on the Philly was flavorless they nickel and dime you for mushrooms, peppers and onions. The cook had a problem with his spatula when he wasn't cooking he was banging on the grill making music which was very annoying.",UNK
3505,I got the pizza and it's not good there is no way this just came out of the oven.  The crust is chewy and doughy .. Probably my last order here.  Disappointed,UNK
3506,"The meat selection was great, but not as good as other brazilian restaurants I've visited.",UNK
3507,"I really do like FOPP. Great GREAT range of DVDs and music. Not sure if its independent but at least I can get some good stuff here, also some cool books!",UNK
3508,I don't recommend this place at all. My friends and I ordered different menus but no one was satisfied.,UNK
3509,I love this place. It has a great variety of organic produce at a reasonable price!! They also have a great vitamin and supplement section and a great juice bar and section to order your food. Every time I go in I feel more dedicated and determined to live a healthier lifestyle!,UNK
3510,Do not go here at all. The people that run this place are not nice to customers at all.,UNK
3511,It's a good breakfast.  I would say its a little pricey for eggs. Service is a little overwhelmed at times.,UNK
3512,Good local Spanish bakery. We've been there a few times. The whole-wheat croissants are delicious.,UNK
3513,"I appreciated the talent, but The 39 Steps had too much \""nudge nudge wink wink\"" humor without ever really being funny",UNK
3514,Great pizza. I've had it 3 times. Would go again. But the place is a little dingy. But most good pizza places are;),UNK
3515,"Great hotel, lots of restaurants and shops within the property.  Very spacious rooms/suites.  I have stay here on more than a dozen occasion and services have always been top notch.  Only thing I don't like is that the pool area gets too crowded.",UNK
3516,OK food.\nI would probally get a pizza some other time.,UNK
3517,Love this place...just extremely small portions of food,UNK
3518,Good sushi with all you can eat options.,UNK
3519,"Meh.  Got the french toast - perhaps it's just because people raved about it that I was disappointed, but found it soggy, SO overly sweet and thought the bananas tasted rubbery.  Would go for eggs next time.",UNK
3520,I love this place!! I get the mapo tofu dish all the time. It is delicious. The owner is super cool and kind too. I definitely recommend this place for some Chinese takeout.,UNK
3521,"A quick and easy stop to pick up all the basics for any house party. The basics such as utensils, plates, napkins, cups, and decoration are inexpensive. Some of the items are on the cheesy side, but you get what you pay for.",UNK
3522,Huge line and not worth the wait. If you want a greasy breakfast than this is your place... I wasn't impressed.,UNK
3523,It's alright.,UNK
3524,"I got the salmon bagel, I asked for extra veggies and got charged for extra veggies, only to open my bagel at work and to find....... No veggies... Sigh..",UNK
3525,"An hour and a half later and cold, over priced for bad service. I used to really enjoy this establishment, however; I've been coming here for years and the service has been getting progressively worse, regrettably I will not likely be back, I wouldn't recommend this to anyone",UNK
3526,"Relaxed, unpretentious, and friendly...",UNK
3527,"Became our normal grocery store until we figured out where Trader Joe's was. Prices were never too high and they had special events from time to time, such as beer tastings.",UNK
3528,"The BBQ chicken was very tasty. The fries, cole slaw, and roll were not with the calories. Don't forget to bring cash as that is the only currency that is allowed. The service was excellent and very responsive.",UNK
3529,Terrible car wash! Bad customer service! Can another car wash buy this place out so we can get a decent car wash please?,UNK
3530,Pricing was very competitive compared to 5 other companies.  Great work and clean- up.  It took them two days instead of 1 day as estimated to remove two 40' high pine trees.  I would use them again if the need arises.,UNK
3531,"This place is close to my house, eat here at lease twice a month.  But the last few visits sure were disappointing.  The salsa bar was dirty.   Tables were not clean.  I have had good fish taco there, but will find a new location.",UNK
3532,"Wasn't that bad, but for the price it's 3 stars. 26 bucks for brunch. They do know how to cook bacon. For the price I could of got two Gordon Ramseys burGRs",UNK
3533,Not good... People must go here for the price/quanity over quality.  Low quality chicken and beef with a good sauce doesnt make it taste good.  Skippable.,UNK
3534,"Great place, Recommend to anyone",UNK
3535,Good solid deli fare. I have tried several sandwiches and they have all left me satisfied. I suggest they invest a little in the atmosphere if they want people to dine in (maybe they don't).,UNK
3536,Used him a few months ago to clean out an outside drain..cost $120.  Scheduling was fast and he showed up on time.,UNK
3537,First of all I gave them 1 star because there is no 0 star!!! I just went there for oil change and car wash. They made me wait for 2 hours and 10 minutes. Should I say something else?? Also I'll make sure that no one goes there!!!!,UNK
3538,"A friend and I came here for happy hour after a long day of shopping. We sat at the bar and our bartender was Dan, he was very nice and accommodating. We had sangria which was three dollars for a a drink, not bad pricing!",UNK
3539,"I love the cheese cake factory! Great price, great portion, great taste! I used to go all the time, but then I moved (thank god). But I'd go back for this cake! My favourite was the 4 cheese pasta and the original cheese cake",UNK
3540,Good cheap food when you are running out of money!,UNK
3541,The food has no taste. Very bland. The guacamole has parm cheese on top and is creamy. The fajitas were covered in cheese. There was no taste!,UNK
3542,Went twice for lunch because we had a Groupon. Terrible both times. Just not worth it.,UNK
3543,"NO wifi, average coffee at best. I dont get all the complements on this place. Was not thrilled with it at all.",UNK
3544,"Front desk ladies are very rude and the gentleman that is always there is very strange.  I live up the street and it was convenient to take my child there, but next time, I will go somewhere else.  RUDE STAFF!",UNK
3545,"The best Curry  Katsu I've ever had!!!!! Will definitely be back for more, my folks wouldn't even let me enjoy my food in piece, everybody wanted some!!! The wait was very long but ill wait again for that food.",UNK
3546,Overpriced and service is not friendly. You can buy cheaper indian groceries at Lee Lee's Oriental Market.,UNK
3547,"When the craving for non-chain Chinese food hits (I'm looking at you, Panda Express), this place is a decent alternative. And by decent, I mean \""not always good\"".",UNK
3548,"You call it. Night already starting right. The burger was ok . I like the pimento chesse. The burger was seasoned. If I had to come back to charlotte , I would comeback , but I wouldn't say it a place you have to try.",UNK
3549,So I was going to move in next week and here are the reasons why it is not happening!  Deplorable conditions after esther stated that it was ready. Not for 750 a month,UNK
3550,Skip this one.,UNK
3551,"If they have what you need, be prepared to wait a while to find out. They could really benefit from a self check out for people who don't need counter help.\n\nGo down the street a few miles to Windmill and Eastern, it's a much better store.",UNK
3552,"it was pretty cheap to fly to las vegas. depending on how many days you book ahead, you can save considerable monies. southwest has easy checkins. a long list of departure times and they leave from oaktown!",UNK
3553,"Classy little wine bar without the pretentious feel. Small menu items and pizza but kitchen closes at 10 on weekdays.  So far, I've tried the wine, but not the food.  I will be back.",UNK
3554,We were handed the menu and told to take the last booth. We sat down. Looked at the menu for a sec. Were bothered by it and walked out. Terrible host,UNK
3555,"If they're open at 11, the bartender and a security officer are unaware. Just standing here looking stupid. \n\nWent to viva salsa instead. Then home. Not gonna gamble here if they don't know when they are open.",UNK
3556,"Fresh, fresh, FRESH. There is no other fast food chain imaginable that has the local, wholesome, fresh, and ethical outlook that Chipotle does.",UNK
3557,Slowest service I've ever seen. Severely understaffed. Waited over 25 minutes for food to arrive. And it was slow.,UNK
3558,Was trespassed out of their store for taking pictures of what was on sale so I could let my wife know the prices in their store this place is a pathetic joke a waste of any time money or effort involved,UNK
3559,Warning:  Do NOT go here for breakfast.  Dinner is okay but breakfast is probably not a good idea.  I have to say that their mochas are tasty (when they are hot),UNK
3560,"Very slow service, attitude issues with line cooks and floor staff, we were there for dinner and lunch bith times staff was reaaaly bad and slow, not enough bus/cleaning staff on the floor.",UNK
3561,"Service is great but I'm sorry the sushi tastes like the one you buy at grocery stores, not fresh at all.",UNK
3562,"Although not a fan of ala Carte restaurants for Steak and in my case filet mignon  cooked medium was very much on point. The parking here however is a bit awkward as well as how to get into restaurant, very inconvenient but the food and service is good.",UNK
3563,Really cool and fun experience! Lots of dif choices of healthy delicious food and cookies! The wings are awesome and I love their teas.,UNK
3564,"Very entertaining, Funny and you'll scratch you're head and thinkin how the hell did he do that... Until today I'm still thinking how did he guess the guest names and stuff about them. Again worth the money!",UNK
3565,Typical McDonalds. Nothing special either good or bad.,UNK
3566,My husband and I at at this Outback last week with friends. The staff was wonderful and the food was great. We will be back to visit again.,UNK
3567,"Great music, but bartenders seems to be bothered or you feel unwelcome, no smile :( just drink!",UNK
3568,"Good quality food,  unfortunately the service was lacking. Our waiter was surprised that I wanted a second drink.  I actually had to call him over because the empty glad on the edge of the table didn't catch his attention.",UNK
3569,fantastic gluten free versions of practically everything on the menu. Top notch quality every time I've tried it.,UNK
3570,"Stopped by Lee's to pick up a couple bottles of wine.  They had a decent selection of reds, but it was a little overpriced.",UNK
3571,"Coffee was OK.. Lines in the morning were very long and service was slow, but nice. \n\nI am not a big fan of Seattles best.. it was the only decent coffee around.",UNK
3572,"I really wasn't impressed... I had the garlic parm fries they were hardly warm & soft like they were old!!! And the boneless wings weren't bad, doubt I'd go back!!!",UNK
3573,Nothing spectacular. I actually think Panda Express is better than this place.,UNK
3574,Cool local brewry and beer joint.  Makes a great wheat beer.  Food is good and atmosphere is what you would expect in a pub/bar.,UNK
3575,"Sitting in bar area waiting on 6 wings. Its been an hour and they are 20% full. Took us 20 minutes to get drinks, too. Will never be back.",UNK
3576,The place looks exactly like it did before only the food changed and is now mexican cuisine. Average and good food but nothing special. If you want a quick bite to eat this place will do.,UNK
3577,fantastic and authentic!,UNK
3578,"Foods ok. \nCheap if ur an adult with a boarding pass and u drink champagne.  However; if u have kids,this is pretty expensive since the age cut off is 3 n under. All in all, 3 stars for an average rating.",UNK
3579,Food was ok. Your normal wings. My only complaint was that we tried to enjoy a nice night our side and the patio was pretty dirty. Somebody should go out on a regular schedule and sweep.,UNK
3580,"Grade A white bread \""Mexican\"" food",UNK
3581,"I love hole-in-the-wall type restaurants and was really hoping this was going to be n awesome hidden gem in queen creek. I liked their tortillas but, their food was just ok for me.",UNK
3582,"Love coming here for thier food, been coming for the last 3 yrs.. just wish the prices were a bit lower",UNK
3583,Amazingly delicious burger with even tastier fries. I also had a PBC&B concrete and it was so flavourfull and rich.,UNK
3584,Don't get the chi foot massage. They advertise pressure points and reflex. I spent $125 for someone to rub my feet. It was terrible. No skills. They need to change their description and their customer service. Very unsatisfactory.,UNK
3585,"Just finished a two night stay and had a wonderful time. The staff here really makes the difference - everyone from the bell staff, counter, wait staff and cleaning crew are over the top friendly. Another nice touch they offer is free Wi-Fi - thumbs up.",UNK
3586,Really terrific Indonesian cuisine. The beef rendang and satay was absolutely delicious. The laksa lacked a little something-I can't quite put my finger on what.,UNK
3587,The bar reeks of smoke and the bar table feels sticky. You'll definitely feel like you're in the deepest hole in the way. The only good thing is that the drinks are cheap. But I really wouldn't recommend going there.,UNK
3588,Very tasty food from vegetarian perspective.  Loved their home style tofu and egg plant.  Atmosphere was nice. The owner was very friendly.  I'm definitely coming back.,UNK
3589,They deserve negative stars I heard that there is new owners and it shows from a terrific caterer to a terrible one I've used them for many charitable events it was always on point now I wouldn't recommend them to the dog pound,UNK
3590,24 hr sandwich shop in Chinatown with cheap eats.  Bread on the sandwich was probably the best part of it.,UNK
3591,"Meh...overrated. i'll stick with yo rita's for my chef sousa fix. food combinations are much  better in the smaller, bite-size taco portions.",UNK
3592,"The food was great as can be expected, but the service overall was unfriendly and not the usual for this chain. The dining area was wrecked, and we had to ask them to cleansome tables so that we had a clean one to sit at,.",UNK
3593,"i went here almost 6 months ago. Solid fajitas, decent margaritas, good service. I really remember their guacamole standing out",UNK
3594,"Later in the night, not very crowded yet they insisted we sit crowded next to another pair of people.  Service was slow, just getting a drink was an effort.  Food was poorly prepared and over cooked, or as in my partners case cold.  No way coming back other than drinks in the summer.",UNK
3595,"all dishes are kids size and expensive. they have great selection of dishes such as small bowl of talay soup for 18.00.our bill wa 140.00 for 2 person.ladies, don\""t take your men here if you want to save money",UNK
3596,Closed :(,UNK
3597,"I just can't get into this place. Maybe it is because the prices are a bit high and the menu a bit limited? It's just \""meh\"" to me.",UNK
3598,Easy to navigate. Plenty of food options. Careful about the distance between terminals though..,UNK
3599,"Painfully slow service here and then discovered they got our small, simple order wrong.  Staff not very polite either.  Won't be back.  Much better bagel place on the other side of the highway by Four Peaks brewery.",UNK
3600,This place is so gross and the food is doesn't taste good. The guy took forever to make my food and left a mess on his prep table. If you want microwaved processed food then this is the place for you! I will not go there again.,UNK
3601,Will go to this store if I can't find the organic product i'm looking for at Sprouts Market or Fresh and Easy. They have a great selection and amazing products. What drops it a couple of stars is the price. I just can't stomach it.,UNK
3602,"Love this place. It's one of the best fast food places around. It is a little pricey but the food is good, especially the coconut shrimp tacos. The chips and queso are addictive. All the portions are big. This place beats Chipotle hands down.",UNK
3603,"It was good, not great, the wafflewich was very good. The hours make it hard to get to this location. If your in the area try it, but I wouldn't go out of the way to try it.",UNK
3604,Bad service.,UNK
3605,Nasty!! Left early couldn't take it. Cigarette buns in the blanket. Water dripping all night because the faucet had corrosion.  Flat pillows. Old bed with no support! Gross pool and hot tub. All round gross. They should be shut down!,UNK
3606,good food  and that what matters.,UNK
3607,"Go here often with my mom for Lunch, Food is tasty and Salsa is great.  Love the Chimis and my mom likes the fish tacos.   Always look forward to eating here.",UNK
3608,"Love the food.  Ceviche, yoshi roll, and their roll with no rice that is wrapped with cucumber are out of this world.  Many other things I want to try on the menu, so will be back for sure",UNK
3609,Favorite spot for tasty Bruchetta!!,UNK
3610,Not the experience I was expecting.  Food was average service was good but overpriced.  The ribs taste boiled the one good thing the fries were fab.  Won't be returning to this establishment.,UNK
3611,Nice staff but a little slow to make the order compared to other SB's I've visited.,UNK
3612,Beware of the mouth breather at the drive-through! I've never seen someone mess up an order so many times in my life in the matter of minutes!,UNK
3613,"Good food! It can be a little expensive, but quality. The cheese curds were worth the buy. They have a good happy hour, but otherwise, I've never been here for a meal. As a student and then young professional starting out, it was just too expensive.",UNK
3614,"Our server Dylan was bad. He was mopey, surly, borderline-aggressive. I felt bad rewarding this behavior with a tip. The food was crap too but that is standard fare for Symposium.",UNK
3615,"the lack of specials is very disapointing. The food is awesome, and I have had some great meals there, but the prices have changed. If you want to keep up in this corporate environment, you need to compete with daily specials. DAILY.",UNK
3616,"needed an alignment.  Was in and out faster than promised, and no upsell!  Gotta love that.",UNK
3617,the arugula pear salad was as bland as the Valpolicella and La Noce pie. the ambiance on a cool April evening was a delight. the dining experience was saved by the 25% donation of our bill to Dining Out For Life.,UNK
3618,"I love Starbucks, but this location isn't the best. Most of the time my drink either tastes off or their staff doesn't really listen to requests.",UNK
3619,Was due to book into this Hotel but once I saw the rooms I walked straight back out. Haven't been updated in a long time.\n\nStaff were very polite and helpful but in would not consider staying here.,UNK
3620,We have experienced very poor customer service here.  Due to this poor customer service nothing else has mattered.,UNK
3621,low end thrift shopping at its best. Cheap...cheap..cheap thats the way we like it,UNK
3622,"Not having good time here , waiting for long time after order.  Tip are add on to the bill, even you feel they don't deserve the tip. \nFood are ok, but just bad serve",UNK
3623,The most frustrating unintelligent staff you can imagine that go back on their leasing quotes! Don't bother!,UNK
3624,"Called in for a simple question about if they had a specific jersey or not, and once was hung up on after being on hold, then the girl was completely rude and short when I called back. Learn some customer service.",UNK
3625,Shrimp Po boy was fab but too small for $9! They have Mr. PIBB & MELLO Yellow.  Still craving shrimp. I shall return.,UNK
3626,"Trennnnndy. But not intimidatingly so. A great location for a first date, or for drinks with a group of people. Drinks are good, martinis are strong. Tapas are on the whole, delicious. Ask the staff for recommendations.",UNK
3627,Three weeks later and my machine has tension problems like never before. Guess where I won't be going to get it fixed?,UNK
3628,"Decent food and ok drinks, just your typical mexican place, seems like it is a chain but i've not seen another one around.  There are definitely better places in plaza midwood.",UNK
3629,this was my first real german restaurant and i thought it was pretty good. i went with the schnitzel and tried one of the house brews. good stuff!,UNK
3630,"Best food since we have been in Vegas. Good prices, friendly staff.",UNK
3631,The experience was pleasant but I took my car to my mechanic a week or two later to get my brakes replaced.  They told me that I was about a quart low on oil which is disappointing.  It's a hassle to go back and ask them to fill it completely.,UNK
3632,They have a good happy hour. Quesadilla flavor was good but tortilla needed to be crispier.,UNK
3633,"Just an FYI, not many veg* options. Gravy isn't veg, but the pancakes are a little on the massive side. A little flavourless though.",UNK
3634,Can you please adjust this site to the correct hours. I came in on Sunday to drop off and you are apparently not open as it states. Would've been my first time using you. \n\nThank you,UNK
3635,Pretty good fast food greek food.,UNK
3636,Great food and great service!  Their mexican corn on the cob is off the hook!,UNK
3637,Very good burgers .... menu is a little confusing. For the novice. Service is a little inattentive. Bar area smells really bad.,UNK
3638,"Food is good, mostly burgers. Great pork with green chili! Pretzel buns... HELLO! So good!",UNK
3639,"Really good. The staff is always friendly. I love the greek salad and any of their iced teas. They also have a beer & wine license, so it's a good place to go for 1st Friday.",UNK
3640,"The people are nice, they work with you for getting things done in the best manner possible and are usually pretty quick about it.  Getting cars fixed, costs money, that's how it is.",UNK
3641,Save $ get your doughnuts at Fry's. The doughnut I got tasted like it may have been at least a day old. The shop isn't very clean or fun to look at. I was hoping it would be a fun little shop to take my daughter to.,UNK
3642,Took weeks to get my car after I purchased it when they told me it would only be one week.,UNK
3643,"Bad a$$ food!! Wish they sent out coupons, I would have eaten here sooner! Food was awesome, and service was speedy and friendly! Much better than other BBQ places for less $$!!",UNK
3644,Ate at this place last night...Miso soup was good....Vegi Noodle dish in beef broth was horrible....this place is way over priced...I will not go back again.,UNK
3645,Food wasn't very good at all. Service was ok. Tried the turkey sandwich and peach pie. Both kind of sucked. Salad was ok. The only good thing I can say was service was quick. Never going here again.,UNK
3646,"Holy crapoli, the strip is hella expensive. Good iced coffee for almost $5. The barista was sympathetic. That's probably about as good as it gets.",UNK
3647,"Really very good by Montreal standards, good even by Vancouver standards. Pricing is a bit peculiar, some things are crazy expensive and others seem under priced.  It has become my go-to sushi place.",UNK
3648,"Good service, but too much over price, $400 after tips for two of us, that price I can eat much much moore better sashimi at Los Angel, won't go back anymore",UNK
3649,"This club is awful. Shitty shitty layout. Only 2 bars? And one of them is by the entrance? \n\nThe bartenders suck here (they suck everywhere in Vegas, but especially here). \n\nDon't bother with this place",UNK
3650,I love Capriotti's... Just not this location. Dirty restaurant and employees that looked like they were hired right out of a homeless shelter.,UNK
3651,"This location is poorly run, staff is untrained on computer system and service.  There is no communication among the management who scramble to put out fires.  This location should be closed while kitchen, front, and management are retrained. The bread is terrific.",UNK
3652,"I  had a call this morning from Kitty, and they have agreed to refund a good portion of our repair bill.  Thank you so much for the call and concern.  I will now recommend W J Maloney Plumbing as an A-1 company.",UNK
3653,"I theeenk they offer a variety subs? Unfortunately, I've not been able to order anything else since discovering The Bobby about 10 years ago.",UNK
3654,Steak salad was blah.. tough steak and warm cherry tomatoes.\n\nFriend had a smoothie and it was warm too...\n\nIt is pricey too.,UNK
3655,"Just called the phone number, it's out of service. Web site is still up. Looks like another one bites the dust.",UNK
3656,Pros:\nClean restaurant. \nGreat food. \nFriendly staff.\nClose to home. \n\nCon:\nNo delivery...but worth the drive.,UNK
3657,Outstanding large park very close to the main strip and all the hotels.  The only reason not 5 stars is close to airport noise.,UNK
3658,Went here again last week and it was as good as ever. Excellent carbornara and decent wine list. Away from the touristy area also.,UNK
3659,Can't beat their Monday deals! All burgers are $5! I got the Belfast Burger and it was magical! Plus the craft beer of the day is only $3!,UNK
3660,"This is a great place. Unfortunately the food doesn't quite live up to the view. Still, I would recommend trying at least once to see for yourself.",UNK
3661,Fun atmosphere!  Nice menu selection. David the waiter was great.  Drinks are huge but don't taste much alcohol!  Better Mexican places...,UNK
3662,"Personally know 6 people who have gotten sick from the burgers and/or chicken served at Urban Tap. Ate there last night with friends, and the two girls who ordered burgers have been vomiting non-stop, all morning.",UNK
3663,Went there & no healthy options!!! All Sugar in everything & KFC or Churches tastes better!! Tea is bitter & instead of making a better kind it is turned into a sugar syrup,UNK
3664,I found the portions to be very small for the price. I had the garlic chicken for dinner and the amount of chicken in the dish probably added up to the size of a small kitten.,UNK
3665,"I've been eating here twice a week for years, because it's one of the few places around where you can still get liver & onions.  And I really like the atmosphere and music.",UNK
3666,I bought an English garden and the design is such that each piece has to be taken out and watered individually; just plastic containers stuck in the basket.  One of the flowers died almost immediately.  Buy beware!,UNK
3667,"Good for being in Pittsburgh, but it didn't knock it out of the park. Tasty, but not amazing.",UNK
3668,"This is a small place, simple, not fancy, but clean.  The service is fast and the portions are large.  For me it is close to home and very convenient because the service is fast and the meals can be healthy. Try the spring rolls!",UNK
3669,"Great spot to watch football when in town meeting up with friends. Its bar food, but pretty good. Not too \""Scottsdalish\"", but still plenty to see",UNK
3670,They have very very delicious shrimp tacos go - taco tuesday! You really can't go wrong with any selection. They have really nice salad too !,UNK
3671,"Out of all the Rebel stations I've been to, this is bar far the friendliest. I've only gotten gas here about 3 times. I'm here more often for a 32 oz cup of tea. Lol",UNK
3672,The place is overpriced and the taste is underpriced. If your in Vegas and are constipated this is the right place for you!,UNK
3673,I have been frequenting about 10 consignment stores in Scottsdale.  I am furnishing a house and looking for quality furniture and home goods at a decent price.  This place is one of my top 5 and the merchandise is of a high quality at a reasonable price.,UNK
3674,Couldn't sit us..very unhappy with the customer service here. I wouldn't recommend this place they're very mean to there customers who have been waiting for a long time..,UNK
3675,Closest thing to the real thing on the west coast great food,UNK

3677,Its Denny's - what else is there to say...,UNK
3678,Stopped in last Friday to get my favorite cupcakes and they were closed up; signs removed and nothing inside.  I am sad that they went out of business.,UNK
3679,Never eating here again. I was sick for 2 days after I eat one of their burgers.,UNK
3680,"Show up early as asked and sit 35 minutes past the appt being ignored.  A reminder, the patient who happens to be paying for a service values their time as well.",UNK
3681,"Great service & tasty food, but canned mushrooms is a deal breaker.  It tells me other ingredients may also be not fresh.",UNK
3682,I had a nice meal here the other night.  Service was very good.  Sea scallops were delicious.  Reasonably priced wine list.,UNK
3683,Small and simple location. They have lots of flavours to try out. It is a nice quiet atmosphere. Very relaxing and I like the dim lights ...,UNK
3684,"I'm not sure I even realized this was here before tonight.  Thank goodness it is!  From time to time you just gotta have some DQ.  The kids behind the counter were pleasant, respectful, and pour a hearty cup.",UNK
3685,Food was mediocre at best.  /The chips and salsa were the best part but I think its ridiculous that you have to pay $5 for chips and salsa.  The margaritas looked good but we didnt try them.  Ambiance is fine.,UNK
3686,"Great Short Ribs!  Will definitely go back to try other entres.  Plan to drink beer, the wine list is weak.",UNK
3687,"Always clean, friendly staff. Take my child to play-place here now & then.",UNK
3688,Want to hire someone who bails out on you last minute about a week before your wedding ? Please go ahead and hire this business. I am surprised she has such high ratings.,UNK

3691,Stopped in for a change of pace. Saw the opportunity to enjoy a nice hot bowl of pho   Glad I did. The yelp reviews were right in line.,UNK
3692,"Minutello's is going out of business. Last day of operation is Sunday, February 17, 2013.",UNK
3693,"Most Targets have a Starbucks and/or Pizza Hut attached them, this one does not.  Primarily, it serve Hot Dogs, sausages and chicken nuggets -- that said the food isn't bad -- but, it is only tube steaks.",UNK
3694,"The original Dutch Bros. (in Oregon) are great, these in Phoenix are fine.  Traditionally, you don't come for a cup of coffee when you go do Dutch Bros., you go for the experience.  If you've ever been to one in Oregon, you would know what I mean.",UNK
3695,Fun place to stop and have a beer. Unique atmosphere and good selection.,UNK
3696,"Piano bar experience was OK.  However, we ordered the pizza and it was the worst food I have eaten (attempted to eat).  Frozen crust - cardboard would have tasted better.  Shame on you for even allowing it in the back door!",UNK
3697,"Best brunch by far in Northwest Glendale. Always searching for a good spot in this area and found this one. Staff was great, food was good. Like the atmosphere . Plan on trying them for wine tasting And dinner soon",UNK
3698,it was the best smoked meat ever,UNK
3699,Tasty food truck food marked up to nosebleed levels served in a huge soulless hangar by arrogant staff.,UNK
3700,"All station casinos are great in general but I like the Boulder because it's never super congested, the cafe has some of the best pastries, they have all kinds of bonuses and perks for gamblers and the staff are so friendly.",UNK
3701,"I only had the chocolate covered banana with nuts but I absolutely loved it! I saw a lot of people enjoying the fried twinkles and other goodies, not for me =)",UNK
3702,Average at best.,UNK
3703,Will never eat here again. Sandwich was meteocre and overpriced. On top Of that I was charged more than I was told the total was. Horrible first time experience!,UNK
3704,Service was horrible- took 10 minutes to take our order. Asked for additional dressing for salad and another drink and that took an extra ten minutes because the server told me they had to get it way in the back? Not the type of service you'd expect when spending that much. Go elsewhere!,UNK
3705,Good place to go when you are hungry.  My favorite- Brisket sandwich.  Best I have had outside my home state of TX.  Fun atmosphere.,UNK
3706,Walked out if airport and bought a shuttle ticket - the lady was nice took time to explain everything - willie - not so friendly - looked bothered that I was interrupting his phone interactions - excuse me - driver was nice - a/c was working -,UNK
3707,"I only go for the ice cream cakes, which they always have a nice selection of in their store. Im in and out within a few minutes and the store is always clean.",UNK
3708,Was not impress the facility looked a bit dirty; and the food was just okay: nothing I would really recommend.,UNK
3709,"Overpriced. The ribs were not good at all, couldn't tell if I was eating meat or fat. The pulled pork sandwich  was low quality ad well. The fried mushrooms and fries would be the best part of the meal. I would avoid if you want good bbq .",UNK
3710,bengning looks good and but the food was avarage. I spent the night in the restroom so no more zupas for me.,UNK
3711,Pretty darn good pizza and great appetizers.  The staff was friendly and the place was clean.  I enjoyed the atmopshere.,UNK
3712,Do NOT buy the Groupon for the JCPenney optical department.  It's NOT a good deal.  It's just to get you in the door.  You can't buy a reasonable pair of eyeglasses for the Groupon price.,UNK
3713,Good food and good music.  Tuesday open mike night is a great time.  Friendly bartenders.  If you sit at the bar long enough you will get fed,UNK
3714,"Indoors the dining area has a chill cave feel, outside has a nice little stream. Local beer on tap, the food has a strong kick so order with caution.",UNK
3715,"Clean, quick and fairly priced for any office supply needs.",UNK
3716,Wonder how many hours of my life I have wasted waiting for shitty customer service from Walgreens pharmacists? Weird. Why do I keep returning? Don't know. Will go anywhere else but here from now on,UNK
3717,"GREAT beer, but not overly impressed by the service (which is slow) or the decor (which is blah).  I'm only giving them four stars because the beer really IS that good. Check it out.",UNK
3718,"THIS RESTAURANT IS CLOSED! The Pasta Shop took over the location, which is a huge upgrade.",UNK
3719,Brunch here will get your day off to a nice start. \nIts also a nice place for a date. don't remember what i ate but I remember enjoying it.,UNK
3720,Decent business hotel and well off the strip--quiet. Staff were helpful and the place was clean.,UNK
3721,"I hate them. They don't know how to turn off a maintenance light on a car newer then 1995. They told me I needed synthetic oil, I don't. Very unprofessional.",UNK
3722,"This place is great! The line is long but well worth the wait, I will be back for some good pizza.",UNK
3723,"This place has a lot of potential, with that being said, for the price, I expect the best most thoughtfully prepare bowl of Ramen.  It was good, but not that good.",UNK
3724,"My son and I were their 1st customers of the day and the floors were nasty, with yogurt toppings under the tables that had obviously been there a while. In a place that serves food, cleanliness is everything. While the yogurt is OK, I will not be going back.",UNK
3725,Wow. Ghetto really is the word here. Security for a grocery store?!  Had the double doors closed one on right and one on left so you had to zig zag through the entrance too.,UNK
3726,I like how THE people that give THE hotel THE 5 stars..awwmyGOD thats AWESOME!,UNK
3727,There was a bug in my yogurt!! Theh took a look at it and sure enough there was a little critter. They were nice enough to let me get a new one after that. Beware of the fruits!,UNK
3728,Good food and very clean but a bit pricey. So so overall.,UNK
3729,I stopped here for my first time and ordered a mocha. It tasted like pencil shavings and was over priced. I recommend going anywhere else for mochas. The worst coffee shop I have ever been in. The week old decaf at Circle K tastes better.,UNK
3730,Been here a couple times and the food is great but the service has been eh..lets just say it could get better. But it wont stop me from coming here! lol,UNK
3731,Don't order your keg from them.  They will sell it to someone else.  We ordered ours over 2 weeks ago for pick up today.  We were told they sold it two days ago to someone else.  What is wrong with this place???  That's not how you do business.,UNK
3732,"We had BBQ from Mac's for the super-bowl party, take out.  It was excellent, very lean and both pork and beef were quite nicely done.  We used our own sauces, so can't rate the sauces well enough to add that opinion.",UNK
3733,Good food if you like arbys,UNK
3734,Fast friendly service,UNK
3735,Samurai Sam's is way better.,UNK
3736,"I really wanted to give 5 stars on food alone but the service was just okay.. I got the rosemary filet with asparagus and it was probably one of the best steaks I have ever had.  We also got the sampler dip platter, that was delicious as well.",UNK
3737,Just okay...I would say the most over rated sushi joint in town. This place is always packed but the cucumber salad and tuna poke were as bland as can be!! Everything else was just okay...the sexy girl was fantastic!!!!!,UNK
3738,"iv'e been to this Albertsons many of  times and they have the worst selection of meat i ever seen  no skirt steak, no flank steak, no good sirloin steak,  no plate beef, no chuck hamburg, but everything else is ok.",UNK
3739,Love the food but the service the past 4 times has been not pleasant. There is a worker who isn't professional and sometimes his comments can be rude. I just want to eat in peace and not be bugged with nonsense like this kid skates around doing.,UNK
3740,"I searched on Yelp for \""best pizza in Scottsdale\"", and this came up #1.  I thought it was great.  The service was wonderful.  The pizza was great, probably thanks to the wood oven.",UNK
3741,"Not so fabulous, this place has really gone downhill and I mean both locations on the west side. If I pay u $45 why do I have to finish detailing my car myself? Plus they managed to destroy my ignition button, they scratched the letters off, very disappointed",UNK
3742,"Absolutely terrible customer service! First time we ever ordered from them and took them and hour and half before we gave in frustration of hearing \""it will be there in 2 minutes\"" mean while waiting an additional 15 minutes with no delivery for my family. Never will order from them again.",UNK
3743,"Conveniently located near the airport. Nice lobby...free internet, coffee & prints, friendly staff ...5 stars to Chandler...offered a shuttle ride to downtown Tempe and prompt pick up too.",UNK
3744,If you want a good Margarita you will love this place and their Guac live is really good too....I agree with the other the food needs some help but if you like Margarita's and Chips and Salsa this is the place to go...,UNK
3745,"Food was great, service was prompt and responsive!",UNK
3746,"The National used to be one of the very best mountain biking trails around unfortunately the rangers have been demolishing the natural obstacles, smoothing out the trail, I call it de-naturalizing.\n\n\""They paved paradise and put up a parking lot\"".",UNK
3747,"Went here, they were out of everything. They messed up all of our orders and even after they fixed them i wasn't impressed by the food.\n\n\nI am not impressed, but also because i was expecting a lot. (go in with low expectations i guess?)",UNK
3748,Store puts labels incorrectly and do not stand by the label price.,UNK
3749,Thai crunch salad is pretty good and the artichoke dip is pretty good as well. Give them a try if your in the neighborhood.,UNK
3750,"Lovely space, fantastic food, a great spot on a sunny day.\n\nNice place to stop for a drink or coffee as well if you're just in the area.\n\nFull review with photos please visit my blog which can be found on my profile.",UNK

3752,I keep hearing this place is good. I keep finding it's bad. Even the margaritas.,UNK
3753,Terrible service. Would have loved to rate the food except we finally left after waiting for a half an hour for an $11 cocktail.,UNK
3754,"Solid choice for Mexican food.  The best item I've had here is the Lisa Special, a large, buttery grilled quesadilla with chicken, green chile, and cheese.  The family that works here is friendly and eager to please.  Service was very good!",UNK
3755,"Completely over priced for what this is. Food is extremely hot to cover the lack of any type of flavor. Pitcher of beer prices are decent. Go somewhere else... this place is lacking in taste, service and quality..",UNK
3756,Went for breakfast very delicious burger unlucky with the server,UNK
3757,Went here for lunch the other day..had pad thai and \nEdemame.  Like everyone else says...a step above panda....i will go elsewhere for pad thai.,UNK
3758,"Great Coney's.  Something about the hot dogs themselves they have a great \""snap\"" to them.  Had the cheese fries too, they did not dissapoint.",UNK
3759,"Bad service, even worse food. Everything looks dirty. Food was under cooked. Area is horrible and staff gossip all day next to your table due to tiny environment.",UNK
3760,Always on a wait. Always waiting on an ardent server to take your order. Always has delicious gingerbread pancakes and gladiator burgers. Always greeted by one of the friendliest owners in oldtown.,UNK
3761,"There's nothing like eating A stone's throw from the beautiful fountains. The chicken and the ravioli dishes were incredible, but the $50 sirloin was tough and disappointing. Expensive, but this is Vegas...",UNK
3762,"Gotta love the phone-in service. I usually get the chicken katsu, kalua pork and spam musubi and it's always been great. The service is excellent...much better than that joke of a restaurant Aloha Kitchen near UNLV.",UNK
3763,Great for breakfast.  Wonderful treats and bread.,UNK
3764,"Service was good.  Food was terrible, from bread stick and dips to artichoke/goat cheese ravoli to seafood risotto.  My companion ended up with food poisoning, think it was the clams!   Would not go there again.",UNK
3765,"It's ok. Floor was dirty and our waiter seemed almost clueless. Food was good but not \""write home about\""",UNK
3766,Bland food and bland service. I will not be coming back.,UNK
3767,Not bad for breakfast or lunch. One star for price three for the food.,UNK
3768,"Forced into this place by my wife, way too crowded for my liking. Families were running out to escape the music, and drunken crowd. This place magically turns into a busy night club after dark. Too loud, service was terrible, and the food was worse.",UNK
3769,Foods pretty good but I come here for the yummy bread pudding.,UNK
3770,"Great food, large portions, will def go to the Chicago Location soon! can't wait to try the chicken and waffles and the stuffed cheese burgers they looked delish at other tables. Service was great and very personable too!",UNK
3771,Ehhhhhhhhhh.....,UNK
3772,"Eat upstairs, much quieter than the hectic atmosphere of everyone ordering downstairs.\n\nI've been three times, the quality of the burger is sometimes a gamble, and my burger has been messed up on two occasions. Fries are always excellent, however.",UNK
3773,"As far as airports go, it's fine. Pretty efficient, people working there are nice. Don't bother with the slot machines- they don't pay for CRAP! Then again, who would really expect them to, right?",UNK
3774,Fresh and yummy.  I nice change from Pho,UNK
3775,The ambiance makes it seem like a fancy restaurant but sadly it is not. The food reminds me of Mexican fast food joints like Chilis or Chevy's. Same kind of appetizers and everything. The service is good though.,UNK
3776,"I simply called to get some info about t-moble. And curious about the data plan and the process. And the mister i was talking over the phone was an AssHole very rude, and doesn't give a shit about new costumers.",UNK
3777,I do not like going into this location. The wait time is always toooooo long. I usually windup calling customer service to have my questions answered and then use the kiosk. Employees seem to be just chatting it up too much while people's precious time is being wasted.,UNK
3778,this place is great unless you come late at night.  the old guy that works there is super slow and unbelievably rude.,UNK
3779,Not good. Beef kabob was gross and gyros was blah. Fries were cr@p. Stay clear of the combo. Waste of time and money.,UNK
3780,"Good place, usually pretty crowded. Im not as huge a fan as some people but I would recommend it. I've had both the burger and sushi offerings and enjoyed myself each time.",UNK
3781,I have to say that this Thai Expr has considerably bigger portion than others! But like all other TEs the pad Thai's too greasy...,UNK
3782,"Marketing-only:  greenwash and healthy-washed, really just a lackluster meal with a hefty pricetag that isn't that green or healthy.  Styrofoam cup anyone???",UNK
3783,I loved the atmosphere and food.. Yummy..,UNK
3784,Prime rib special is a steal with soup or salad bar and great desert cherries jubilee is to die for,UNK
3785,"Delicious food, great service, reasonably priced and generous portions",UNK
3786,I've eaten here a couple times so far and have had the same rude customer service each time. The women that work here have no customer service skills. The food is inconsistent. I ordered the orange chicken and it was stale with way too much sauce. I give them 2 stars.,UNK
3787,I ordered a cappuccino! It felt a little light! It was too light. I believe the barista poured a sip into my cup and topped the rest off with foam. Not happy. I guess a few bucks does not go a long way these days. Try harder Starbucks!,UNK
3788,"Fairly mediocre, even by the relatively modest standards of Home Depot. Unfortunately, this is probably the best you're going to do for hardware in most of Pittsburgh.",UNK
3789,"Short ribs, tater tots, and potato leek gratin were amazing!  Great waitstaff and ambiance.  -can't wait to go back",UNK
3790,"Horrible food, restaurant in poor condition, bad smell in the air when you walk in the door",UNK
3791,I wasnt impressed. The pasties  were so so. Not like they are in the U.P.   Service poor. :(,UNK
3792,"This location does not have good service. Went through drive-through and they forgot our drinks and our sides. While they were preparing what they forgot, we could see another girl who had her back to us and it was obvious that she was on her phone. Any other KFC would be better.",UNK
3793,This place always has a long ass line. I don't understand it. I wish they could improve their service somehow.,UNK
3794,"I wanted to like it - but yeah, it was a meh experience.  Went for an early dinner so had a sandwich and fries and yeah - nothing special.  Not a place I need to go back to.",UNK
3795,I've expected more from this burger joint. I always have to compare it with in-n-out. IN-N-OUT hands down. For the price and taste in-n-out all day long,UNK
3796,I was looking for a large cocktail ring.  The salesclerk was patient and helpful.  This boutique has just about everything.  The prices are reasonable too.,UNK
3797,Great local shop with very friendly and helpful staff. Eclectic vibe with interesting art work on the walls and fresh beats playing in the background. The pumpkin spice latte (sugar free) was excellent and topped with some of the best fresh whipped cream I've had in awhile.,UNK
3798,"Great place to cure a hangover. They skimped on my mudslide though, maybe it was the hangover.",UNK
3799,Average food. There are only 1 or 2 even worth hitting up.,UNK
3800,This place was nice when it first opened bus has gone down hill over the years. Service is slow and the staff is unprofessional. Out of ALL the casinos in the valley this one has to be the worst,UNK
3801,Crazy busy from 5 to 7 in the evening on weekdays.,UNK
3802,"Love CB&TL's Blueberry Pomegrante ice blend. This location had it, made it, was great, I was happy.",UNK
3803,I have not had their lunch but I can confirm their pasta is very good. Worth a try.,UNK
3804,"I love Chili's,  but this location is odd.  Great bartenders, but food is so-so.  Recommend the guacamole!  Table service is just okay.  Kind of disappointed:/",UNK
3805,Good place to come and get your tire pressure checked!\n\nKeep up the good work guys!  Thank you for keeping us safe on the road!,UNK
3806,I love America's Taco Shop.  I only gave this location 3 stars due to lack of service. I am used to ATS taking pride in their service.  You can tell this location is a franchise.,UNK
3807,Every time I have gone to eat here I have walked out because no one ever shows up to seat us. When I place a delivery order I'm put on hold for at least 5 mins. Awful vet unprofessional,UNK
3808,Free pool sun - thur. Drink prices okay. Good pretty good. Wednesday all day happy hour.,UNK
3809,The lady I had finished my mani & pedi in less that 25min. She was going so fast that it didn't even look good at the end. I totally don't recommend this place at all.,UNK
3810,"If you like paying a million dollars for gelato, this place is for you!  Looks pretty in the case but the sticker shock is not worth it.",UNK
3811,"not sure why people love this place. It is unique but not chic, more bohemian or punk i think...if u r into Italian designers, this is not ur place",UNK
3812,I have seen a lot of shows here.  It's really nice and brings some amazing productions to the city.  \n\n(and I also saw the Great Gatsby ballet that another commenter mentioned!),UNK
3813,"I'm a M&M collector, no where else has this kind of selection!",UNK
3814,"Not as good as Bare, Tao Beach, Rehab, but still pretty fun.\n\nDitch Fridays is the only day to go.",UNK
3815,"This salon is a great cheap alternative in the central phoenix area.  I had a totally decent haircut for $30, the service was really nice.  Nothing out of this world, but definitely a great option if you are saving money.",UNK
3816,extreme price gouging..1-tiny small Rum & Coke $13.58cents.  Watered down sewer water. Do people actually tip the bartenders at this rate???   its called ripping off the tourists. Wow...,UNK
3817,"Had a terrible experience here when having an early rooftop dinner on a Saturday. The service was neglectful and it took almost an hour to get our food, almost making us late for the show we were on our way to. The food was average at best.",UNK
3818,"Visited here to check out the \""Auto Collections\"" car exhibit with a free coupon.\n\nWalking through the hotel itself - it was old, \""runned-down\"" and messy.",UNK
3819,"Had a corn dog and really enjoyed it. Just like the fair! My meal came with fries, coleslaw and a pckel. All was delicious...",UNK
3820,"Interesting food and drink choices and a fun atmosphere, I enjoyed it a great deal",UNK
3821,"The 4-5 times we've been here, we have always received prompt and friendly service. The menu has good variety and plenty of choices. The food is great and comes in portions too big to finish. I highly recommend Sir Hobo's for breakfast.",UNK
3822,"Lobby bar bartenders are rude. Two bartenders ignored us for 5+ minutes. We tried to get they're attention and when they made eye contact with us, they made no sign that they had seen us. We finally just decided to leave. There is no excuse for rude service.",UNK
3823,First time trying the restaurant. Went through the drive thru. Person taking order and collecting the money was very personable. Food was great for the price. \n\nI even like how they ask if you want a placemat if you eat in the car.,UNK
3824,"Great Beer, but food is terrible.  We ordered the prime rib nachos which were a joke.  They cost $12.  The portion and quality were awful.  The texture of the cheese was equivalent to government cheese.  It had a plastic taste.",UNK
3825,The coffee is the same but you should visit the S L O W E S T Starbucks ever! This place takes the award for not being able to take the orders nor care in the world about timing,UNK
3826,I was expecting healthier options.. It wasn't horrible just not healthy enough for me,UNK
3827,Mobile unit came to my office. Installation completed in about an hour. Installer was friendly and professional. He explained and gave me information about the new glass and curing process. I liked that they cover one chip for the lifetime of the windshield. I would recommend this service.,UNK
3828,"food is okay but not impressive.  The price is high. tip is enforced. One time we three friends just ordered regular dishes, costed 25$ per person , higher than average here",UNK
3829,"I would've given a 5 star, but the cleanliness isn't always up to par. The food is delicious. The price is very good for the amount of food you get.",UNK
3830,I never got served and when I did the waitress told me that she wasn't supposed to take tables yet.  So I grabbed my shit and left.  I didn't want her to work off the clock for free.  So I brought my business elsewhere.  Will never be back.,UNK
3831,"Why would u go here instead of an army surplus store for emergency preparedness? This place was so lame. I guess if you really want to experience a place that has a couple of fake zombies posted up in and around the store, then knock yourself out. That was about the only thing unique about it.",UNK
3832,It is very pricey here. Just wanted some drinks and ended up spending mre than $40.00 omg. go to SF LV Superstore instead. I havent been there but a couple of my friends advise it us a much better and more fresh option.,UNK
3833,Good food. cool side of town.  Decent coffee.,UNK
3834,"Nice atmosphere with above average food. This restaurant has a lot of potential. The wait staff was far below average: They were slow, and we had to ask multiple times for things. They were not the most polite wait staff, and our waitress was either a little demeaning or very socially awkward.",UNK
3835,"Horrible poker room. No action! Maybe, 1-2 tables going on a regular Saturday night (not holiday). Go elsewhere.",UNK
3836,"I came in for the ox tail soup!  They give you a lot of meat!  I enjoyed it.  If you are alone, you can skip the line and sit at the counter.  Good service, but not spectacular.",UNK
3837,Love the store. Nice stuff. Price reasonable. BAD parking...Employees at this location are nicer and willing to help compare to the one at Ohio River Blvd....Easy check out. Friendly staff.....,UNK
3838,"I will never return to the place. Service was very slow. My sons food was under cooked, coffee sucked and on top the that the place smelled like BO/toilet.",UNK
3839,"Excellent meal, great dessert, and so many beers.  I wasn't even mad when they were out of my favorite beer that night, because they had 10 other similar beers on tap, and several house brews/blends to try.",UNK
3840,"Messy store, no customer service and just an all-round bad experience! I think I will take my business elsewhere.",UNK
3841,"Definitely a glitzy, artsy, lackluster tourist trap. Not sure why this is a must do in every single guide book and website. The building is beautiful but the interior is marred by galleries I would never buy anything from. Oh well.",UNK
3842,"Inside the Planet hollywood, walked over from bellagio or cosmo when ever have craving. Can't go wrong with their best sandwich in the world combo.",UNK
3843,Good for watching the football in & getting a bit of a flavour of the down to earth side of the West End. Clean & cheerful with pleasant service although not without pretension as Stella's \u00a33.95 a pint.,UNK
3844,It was good as always. I'm in a hurry to get to a show but I really wanted to post this picture of Jen. Lol,UNK
3845,Overall its a pretty cool place. Cold beer and good wings but the service us hit or miss and some if the bands bring in a rough croud.,UNK
3846,Nothing to write home about....a txt will do. \n\nGood food \nGood service \nNothing special \n\nWould give it another shot. Pretty atmosphere....yes...I said pretty.,UNK
3847,"Good food, family owned, priced right and overall a nice place to grab Mexican food at a reasonable price.  Better than those BS fake places like Ajo ALs or Macayo. This is simple, fresh and done right.\nOur good to place for wanting Mexican and budget conscience.",UNK
3848,Average at best.\n\nQueso with Spinach was good but everything with queso had to have spinach. \n\nWorks well for people in that area.....,UNK
3849,Poor service... Had to ask 3 times for a drink ! The burger was well overcooked ! The only good point and star of the night was the cockail ! All the rest... Pass,UNK
3850,Zabas is ok but I cant stop comparing it to Chipolte. Although the fish tacos are top notch I prefer Chiptole.,UNK
3851,Bar food\nDecent bar food though.\nWaitress was nice\nBeer was cold \nCool paintings and art\nAtmosphere was warm and non pretentious,UNK
3852,I got a coconut slush. It was Ok except it wasnt full. There was about an inch missing from the top. I didnt exactly get my money's worth.,UNK
3853,Pretty awesome. Nice service. Good food. Nothing fancy. waffle breakfast sandwich was great. i dont know about waffle pizza. it wasnt bad... just not my thing. very nice staff. get waffles!!!,UNK
3854,"The Longinisa is my favorite the quantity is a lot I couldn't finish my plate and the service is very fast as all the food is ready to go, but It is a little greasy",UNK
3855,Waiting  30 minutes for a burger is a joke.  It's time to grow up and ditch the food truck and get a real location.,UNK
3856,No smoke flavor  in the pork bbq and sides(collards and black eyed peas) were devoid of flavor. Subpar bbq all the way,UNK
3857,"Had the pulled pork nachos and BBQ chicken lettuce wraps.  Food was good, but portions were extremely small for price.  Service was horrible.  Took 45 min to get bill at 4 in the afternoon.",UNK
3858,We frequent the Elephant Bar for fish and Ahi and other different delights.  Service varies on the visit.  The bar area itself is the best place normally.  The food is consistently very good with a nice variety.  \n\nLinda was our server tonight and was nice.,UNK
3859,"the duck dishes were great, and unique. Other than that I thought everything else was oooook.",UNK
3860,Unfortunately I had the most bland and dry shawarma I've ever had. No sauce or flavor.  I'm not sure I'll give the place another try or not. Service was great and the people nice but not impressed with the food.,UNK
3861,Nice decor and... that's all :-(\n\nService is impersonal and food is just extremely greasy and not savory at all.\n\nDisappointing overall,UNK
3862,"Arrived @ 6:15pm on Sat without a reservation, restaurant was fairly full.  We were seated immediately though.  No one even acknowledged our presence for 15 minutes.  We got up and left, once again, without being acknowledged.  Disappointed.",UNK
3863,Grabbed a quick slice between meetings and gambling. A good cure for a mid day hangover.  The pizza is decent. Not as good as a Chicago deep dish. But this is Las Vegas. And I don't expect the best. Was a good value also.....,UNK
3864,"I always come here to get my car washed. My car gets pretty clean for only $3, and I love the free vacuuming, can't beat that.",UNK
3865,"What kind of restaurant closes in Las Vegas at 9:15 PM on a Friday night?  I tried to make reservations at 9:30 PM and they said they were closed.  Truly unreal, there are far better places open until 11 PM or as late as 24 hours to consider!  Wayne Gorsek",UNK
3866,"I had the trainee waitress. Yay me. I wasn't a regular so I was more or less ignored. Fish and chips were mediocre at best, was hoping for more. All waitresses were easy on the eyes so that's a bonus..",UNK
3867,Great food great staff and great atmosphere.,UNK
3868,"Gave a decent amount of time since last visit.  Seated quickly.  Staff polite.  VERY busy, but they got the order correct and food was fresh.  MUCH better experience.  Still slammed and oddly organized location. . .but they're trying hard.",UNK
3869,Unfriendly staff,UNK
3870,"0 stars at Alll. This place is nothing but Shit hole!!, I strongly recommend that please never visit this place. Believe me!!",UNK
3871,"I've done the teppanyaki twice.  It is a lot of fun with a group of friends.  The prices are higher than normal, but the food is good.  This is definitely a place to be seen so dress accordingly.",UNK
3872,"Great ambiance, great food and great service! Glad a girlfriend told me about this hidden gem. Ordered my entree but wasn't sure what wine to order so the bartender offered a few samplings before I decided! We will definitely be back!",UNK
3873,110 outside and no AC for a 30 minute plus wait!  Terrible customer amenities,UNK
3874,Great place tucked away off Eastern. Bobby the manager is real helpful and I've never had any problems with the machines or equipment.,UNK
3875,Service is slow. food is passable at best. keep driving down the road better food is waiting for you,UNK
3876,Food was good. The service is poor. The restaurant is clean.,UNK
3877,"Awful poor excuse for a gyro. Food is always soggy. Meat is pure horsec*ck. Very unfriendly staff, but what do you expect from Greek f@ggots. Will never order from here again, total trash.",UNK
3878,"I love this place!! Fatty smoked meat, mustard on rye with pickle. Yum. Meat melts in your mouth. Bought it home to PA and it reheated (steam) amazingly well. So delicious as my mouth waters!",UNK
3879,"Excellent broccoli cheese soup!  Recommend the salmon sandwich too.  The salad bar had a lot of different items on it, but was missing some of the standards, i.e. black olives.  But still worth the trip and I would go back here again.",UNK
3880,"Sorry, to say our meal was not tasty at all and our tamale was cold. Maybe they can improve as we need more types and styles of food in Fountain Hills.",UNK
3881,"The food was mediocre. I had high hopes of the food, but was somewhat disappointed. It wasn't nasty,  it was just nothing to write home about.",UNK
3882,Great pub with friendly atmosphere and an excellent selection of food and drink. Great for a catch up with friends.,UNK
3883,This BK stinks like throw up and shit. Their burgers were bland and not so tasty at all.,UNK
3884,Great ambiance and view.  Preferred it to Mix,UNK
3885,"Snooze is my new favorite breakfast place! Lots of healthy choices for every liking. Gluten free, dairy free, vegan. A little pricey, but the service and quality are awesome!",UNK
3886,Great food! The filet mignon sliders were delicious! Mac n cheese was good not great. Love the ambiance.,UNK
3887,Selection is decent but the Crabs are awesome and bigger than most places. For the price alone killed them with the amount of Crabs I destroyed!!!,UNK
3888,Had the wor wonton soup and Mongolian beef. \n\nSoup was great and filled with lots of good stuff. \n\nBeef dish was good but much more typical American/chinese cuisine,UNK
3889,The quality of service and car wash has become absolutely horrible at this location. Plus they have the highest gas prices in the area.,UNK
3890,"I enjoy Indian food, but this place had the worst service.  We had a table of 6 and some people got their food in 15 minutes, some people got their food in an hour.  What a horrible experience.",UNK
3891,"Yummy! Good hearty buffet; fine for lunch. Many better buffets in Vegas, but none more commonly satisfying south of the city than South Point, though try the M Resort Casino buffet for quality.",UNK
3892,"Mandy's is really delicious. They're not skimpy on the delicious items in every bite. It's very yummy but way, way too expensive.",UNK
3893,"One of my favorite night clubs anywhere. I prefer Sundays or Mondays versus Friday or Saturday, slightly more sophisticated crowd. \nThe music and atmosphere are allways great.",UNK
3894,"The managers of both the Italian and Asian counters are extremely rude and pushy, I think their names are Tom and Jamie.  You would also think such a huge store they would have a decent selection.  Way over priced too.  I would recommend going elsewhere, a place where managers actually care for your business.",UNK
3895,"I like this restaurant.  The Spicy Tofu soup is amazing, I haven't been able to find better in town. \nI always go for lunch as I think it is a little pricey, and the service isnt the best.",UNK
3896,"Horrible food, no way comparable to other mexican restaunrants in the valley..... \n\nFood didn't taste good at all",UNK
3897,"Good service but if you advertise a breakfast as a healthy one, actually HAVE the whole wheat toast as mentioned. Bizarre.",UNK
3898,If I could give no stars I would. My delivers order was incomplete and food arrived burned. I'm now walking this back for a refund. Cafe Verde is good flamingo pizza is good Boston pizza is great....this was a total disapointment,UNK
3899,"Great food here.  Not some place that you would wander into, but well worth going.  Nice patio out back when the weather is nice.  Bring your own bottle and enjoy!!",UNK
3900,"Tried for the first time.  We had the Blanco Burger and the El Diablo burger, with a side of Sweet potato fries.  Food was good but way over priced.  Service was good,  but the place was really noisy.",UNK
3901,All you can eat salad.  But I like my own dressing....there ranch. Just isn't right.,UNK
3902,"Out of business, too bad, was a great location and atmosphere.",UNK
3903,"A huge amount of food for a relatively cheap price. But the tenders we had were on the dry side. I'll have to give this place another try and see if they redeem themselves. If it's good enough for chumlee, it's good enough for me",UNK
3904,"This place smells like ass can anyone confirm that this place stinks.. like the smell.. as my daughter would say \""ewww gross!!!\"" In a one year olds voice while she's holding her nose...",UNK
3905,"Great! Love the Pho Soup. I was a little sad it was not vegetarian, but otherwise it is great food and friendly staff.",UNK
3906,Long lines but exactly what I expect for an airport. Fast enough service to get a coffee before my flight.,UNK
3907,Brought my family here yesterday.  The food is good but the service is terrible.  Please do not come here and expect good service.,UNK
3908,Overpriced under good. Service was great but the food is not worth a drive to downtown CHandler.  I'll stay in my neighborhood and go to Tum Nak Thai.,UNK
3909,This is literally the worst pizza I've ever had.,UNK
3910,"Clean and reasonably priced, and centrally located to the clubs, shopping, and Metro.",UNK
3911,"Sorry guys, we are much bigger fans of the the Hon Machi on Alma School.  The service was horrible and the food was sub par.",UNK
3912,Pizza was super dry we got pesto chicken pizza but more over the service was nothing to write home about,UNK
3913,"We want highly recommend this restaurant. Great food, good service. Expensive but not too much.\nWent back the day after for 5 to 7 happy hour at the bar. Great formula with nice cocktails and small plates at a very reasonable price. And David the bartender is the must.",UNK
3914,This contains more talking and more dancing than all the other Cirque du Soleil shows.  Unless your a huge Elvis fan go see Ka or O.  Both are better.,UNK
3915,Food poisoning from chicken wings ordered on 3/20/13.  Throwing up some nasty chicken.  Avoid this place!,UNK
3916,Gets three stars because of the service and the view. Both of which are great. The prices are way too high for the quality of the food that you get. I work near East Los and this place would shut down after two weeks there.,UNK
3917,Update - after I posted my review a comment was left by Main Event Entertainment asking me to email their district manager William.  I sent William an email over a week ago and still haven't received a response.,UNK
3918,everyone before me has said it already-a flash from the past-a drug store w/a diner. such great memories.,UNK
3919,Good Sushi at a fair price.,UNK
3920,"I've never written a review on Yelp before so it really says something about how annoyed I am right now. They missed something on my order and when I went back to the window, they saw me, turned away, and ignored me. I'll never come back.",UNK
3921,"This place sucks. Please seat yourself and please serve yourself. After sitting for about 5 minutes we watched 3 servers ignore us & had to go inside. We watched this happen with 2 other tables. The music sucks, don't order liquor drinks because you'll be paying $10 for soda water!",UNK
3922,"New owners errr! Don't even speak English !\nI showed her the picture and she still brought me the wrong dish !\nThe food is not fresh like before it tastes like dog , This place has no customer service skills.\nI will never return !",UNK
3923,Excellent atmosphere and friendly service.   Food was great.,UNK
3924,Service trop long plats pas assez recherch\u00e9 sec trop simple . Ne pas y aller un dimanche !,UNK
3925,This place is garbage.  Super small.  No seats unless you get a table and it's well drinks.,UNK
3926,Terrible service from everyone.  Food was bland and average. Waited forever. Not worth the money. Not by half.,UNK
3927,Always a great place to go for lunch. The avocado egg rolls are amazing!,UNK
3928,"it was ok.  \n\nmussels were good.  service ok.  ambiance seemed dated.  worth a trip, but not sure i would go back.",UNK
3929,You can't spell IT RIPS without Spirit!\n\nit's the worst ever!!!,UNK
3930,I tried to call in an order and was left on hold for over 15 mins. I finally just hung up...,UNK
3931,"the phone number is disconnected. and it looks like a new smoothie place has replaced this. it used to be next to as you wish, right? and it stinks cuz I have groupons that I intended to use at this location.",UNK
3932,I hate this place,UNK
3933,"Nice find for breakfast on my way back to Phoenix from Flagstaff! Very comfortable, \""eggcelent\"" service and good food as well! I will definitely return when back in the area!",UNK
3934,"Been to this big lots a few times, I recommend It. The pictures they have for sale are always really nice and the service has always been good. They also have some pretty good deals that just can't be beat",UNK
3935,My 2nd time there. As good as first time. Small little 15 table hole in the wall that serves great food. Good prices and filling portions. Highly recommend the steak kabob very tastey. Will be back,UNK
3936,They got me in and out quickly for my appointment at the Genius Bar.  Unfortunately when I got home I realized the problem I came in for hadn't been solved.,UNK
3937,Great atmosphere and outdoor seating. Great selection of beers but be prepared for no service. We waited with no one offering is menus. People around is were waiting to pay but no service still. Trust me were not impatient but this was bad.,UNK
3938,SKIP THIS PLACE. Self serve with a factory taste and a Giant TIP JAR SIGN for no service and robot behavior.,UNK
3939,This place isn't here anymore! This is the 5th time on our trip that yelp has do e this to is.,UNK
3940,Nice looking mall but did not buy anything,UNK
3941,"WAAAY too small. Ultimately I would find another pool party. Having lots of people is fun, no doubt, but the overcrowding really kills it.",UNK
3942,"We eat here a couple of time a month, the food is always good and the service is good.  The lunch prices are great for a sit-down.",UNK
3943,"Fun atmosphere, and decent margaritas. If you plan on going order a cheese dip and drinks only. Skip the food and just have a couple drinks along with chips and salsa. Trust me, you will be glad you listened! Food is very bland and very expensive.",UNK
3944,"If your trying to eat clean and healthy, you must try the protein style with NO sauce. Keeping the sauce defeats the purpose.. IMHO",UNK
3945,"Good, quick sammy. Lots of options and always tasty.",UNK
3946,Don't go there in the afternoon. Apparently they stop brewing coffee hours before I got there because half of them were out and the other half cold. The sandwich may have been cooked that morning as well. So disappointed at this location.,UNK
3947,"Great food as always just make sure you go after 6:30pm or before 5 because the \""Sun City rush\"" is insane.  The ribs were amazing...",UNK
3948,"Good pho, less than average customer service. I like that it's open 24/7 ...go for lunch. Obviously get some pho ---try the grilled pork spring rolls!",UNK
3949,"Inoffensive sushi. Nothing too exciting, but not bad. Hamachi roll was nice, but some of the fancy rolls feel like they are trying too hard.",UNK
3950,"Quality control at its poorest! I spit out the pad Thai, I couldn't cut the meat with a sharp knife, the crab was too salty (you have to request to boil them to made edible). Bellagio, I expected more from you...",UNK
3951,Nice course to play right off th eplane great bang for the buck!,UNK
3952,"I would never come back here again!  I love live comedy but wasn't impressed with Ralphie May or anything about this club for the saturday night show.  Our bill for drinks was more then we spend on dinner AND drinks at CIBO, that is INSANE.  Never going back.",UNK
3953,Mixologists extraordinaire.   The bartenders here like their craft and like to surprise you (pleasantly) if you're in the mood for something.   Very friendly and relaxing and a cool crowd as hotel lobby bars go.,UNK
3954,Ahhhh scary not fan a rough crowds but dinning is worth a try!,UNK
3955,The food is legit.  Probably the best non chain Chinese restaurant in Gilbert. Garlic green beans are great. Service is good but is real laid back.,UNK
3956,Long line so I expected something spectacular. It was just average Italian food with a high price.,UNK
3957,"Not bad at all, but the omelets and pancakes are better at Crackers.",UNK
3958,"Puke. Greasy, Box of fruit is a joke. Skip it and go to Magnolia's @ 4 Queens, if you are looking for good coffee shop-type food.",UNK
3959,"Fun but loud. Spendy drinks, but hot servers. You get a wide mix of music while they are tied to Rock & Roll Fantasy Camp, the good, the bad, and the fugly.\n\nBottom line I'll go back just to see server Alicia!",UNK
3960,Great price for a decent and quick car wash.  Love the location sadly I won't be going back since all of the quarters disappeared out of my console while they were washing / detailing it.  Not a feel good to be tipping someone that has already tipped themselves.,UNK
3961,Straight up you are only get in if you pay your way in. Doesn't matter if you have a ticket or not if you don't wanna pay $50 a head plan on waiting at least an hour and a half.,UNK
3962,Went for lunch.\nThis is a local favorite. The meatball sliders are a big hit and pizza is a little pricey but worth it. \nStaff was friendly. Would come back again.,UNK
3963,"Below average Mexican food at best. And $6 for chips and guacamole? Unless you go to Chandler High, skip this place.",UNK
3964,"Very friendly, great customer service and you can't beat the prices.",UNK
3965,Poor service and very open sketchy (drug?) dealings in the parking area. My friend and I walk here for cigarettes and often see questionable activity going on. The second star is solely earned by the giant American flag that flies on this property. That thing is glorious!,UNK
3966,"Good cocktails, cozy atmosphere,  great addition to the depth of Montford. Try The Prohibited at medium spicy.",UNK
3967,I ALMOST gave up on trying after multiple fails on rude service and being so unorganized.  The past few times have been a great & cheerful experience though.  They definitely got it together and found a team that works!!  I never met a soup I did not like at panera!!,UNK
3968,"Wish I could give this one star. I wasn't expecting much other than a sandwich/sub...unfortunately it was the most boring, limp and flavorless sub I think I've ever had. I'll definitely avoid Blimpies going forward in my travels.",UNK
3969,"Been here many times & now get a dirty, cheap corner bar feel. Dirty bathrooms tell me a lot & now they have someone providing \""valet\"" service.",UNK
3970,Great open concept layout. excellent eating areas. The only problem I ran into was that it took about 15 minutes to get a drink at the bar. Hopefully this was just a one time occurance.,UNK
3971,"good drinks, nice atmosphere, sometimes crazy packed but all in all i dig it!!",UNK
3972,Great food! There are very few places you can get great Mexican food and this is one of few! Great prices for the food and the staff are great people! I always go there after a night out!,UNK
3973,"Over staffed, but there is never anyone to help me look at something I am potentially going to buy. No bargaining whatsoever, not even if the item has been there forever.",UNK
3974,It is the crew that makes this store work!\nAnd it is the crew that keeps me coming back!\nThey always seem to go above and beyond what is being asked.\nThat kind of service is rare!,UNK
3975,"The food at these shops is terrible. It is like eating airplane food. Salty, bland, thoughtless. Do yourself a favor, spend your money somewhere that cares a little about quality.",UNK
3976,Terrible customer service. Waited about an hour just to get a normal car wash I don't understand. There is no reason a car wash to take that just just to be normal. Didn't even clean the inside good,UNK
3977,Margaritas and Nachos appetizers thats all we had \nand we enjoyed it  cant speak of much else quick service \nwe did not have dinner i didnt think it was a place i would have dinner\nbut apps and a cocktail A-OK,UNK
3978,I was very disappointed with the customer service here. I'm through with Mens Warehouse forever because of this store.,UNK
3979,cool spot.  good bbq.  \n\nwent for brunch with a group of friends.  inexpensive bottomless mimosas and excellent food.  simple design of the menu and decor but tastefully done.  The upstairs is big enough that you could easily throw a party.,UNK
3980,A great mom and pop place to eat healthy & to grab a juice! Green Zing is my go to The have a pretty good selection of organic extras to incorporate into your life as well.,UNK
3981,Over priced for the quality and taste they offer. Don't think I'll be going back. Their customer service needs some help too we didn't get our drinks until we started eating and they weren't nice enough to even bring to the table. Simply not going back.,UNK
3982,All the tapas I've had are good.  The sangria is also good.  The place can be very noisy so don't go if you're looking for an intimate dinner.,UNK
3983,Been here 45 mins....no food yet.   Think they need to get their act together in the kitchen.   This is unacceptable.  I hope they get this in order....would love to have a great place like this in our neighborhood.,UNK
3984,"Hanging with friends here to avoid traffic.\n\nService is good. Xmas decorations cute. Environment is good for having a discussion. Soup really too salty, they changed it to another type of soup for me :)",UNK
3985,"I love the ambient lighting and artsy decor. Wine was good. Great flavoring, slight hint of sweetness. Would recommend the Truffled Mushroom Pizza or one of their bruschetta planks. Tiramisu once again proves itself. :)",UNK
3986,"Like the outdoor seating, however the indoor environment is pretty messy and crowded. They have very good service and their hot chocolate is amazing, made with hot milk and real chocolate.",UNK
3987,There is something wrong when you try and use a shared branching system and you are told that you are second rate and will have to wait for all the other customers who are members to be helped before you will be helped,UNK
3988,The food and service were amazing. The wait for a table was crazy long and the only complaint I had is that we called ahead of time when we were on our way to get on the list and the girl that answered refused to put us on the list over the phone. Otherwise great experience.,UNK
3989,Worst planned parenthood. No one go here.,UNK
3990,Good food great quantity and good service all in all really good place to go,UNK
3991,"Not the best pizza in the world (it's also not the worst but at $5,  why complain.",UNK
3992,I have been a resident here for almost 13 months. I really love my 2bed 2bath apartment home. This facility is clean and the management here is awesome. \n\nAlbertus B,UNK
3993,"If their photo machine (They HAD two) breaks down, don't expect a quick solution. Out of stock item needs to be ordered, NOT HAPPPENING! They are a \""Convenient\"" store. INCONVENIENT (For locals)",UNK

3995,"Did not want to give one star. Horrible service, grouchy servers..... Worst service ive ever had. Do your family a favor.... Don't eat at golden china..... Especially if your Hispanic",UNK
3996,"Even in the cooler months, it's still very warm inside this post office..  in the summer months its unbearable.",UNK
3997,Had lunch here twice. Staff was very freindly and attentive. I had the bison meatloaf both times. The bison meatloaf is excellent and I completely enjoyed it. I would stop back again if I was in the area.,UNK
3998,Bought an apple pie and it went moldy in two days. Brie was expensive and the worst tasting I've ever had.,UNK
3999,Also be sure to check out the reviews that are not recommended by yelp.  All say the same thing.,UNK
4000,"Ho-hum food, about like a Applebee's or Chili's. What I had was way too salty. Decent enough service.",UNK
4001,Excellent pizza. The best. Had antipasto.  Was great. Prices somewhat ok. But service sucks. Needs new management to control the staff.  Very disappointed on staff but pizza greattt,UNK
4002,"Update, never returned money or call.  Thanks Amex for doing the right thing!",UNK
4003,Horrible service. Manager lady lacked intelligence and customer service skills were awful.  Decided to not ship after completing transaction and she claimed there's a $5 refund fee although there were no signs stating of such policy.  DO NOT USE THIS STORE!,UNK
4004,"Green Curry, medium hot: delicious!",UNK
4005,For some reason I always have to connect between terminal E and terminal A. As a hub it's pretty busy so hoof it to your next gate!,UNK
4006,This pizza is really really frickin good. I like the arugula. Go here when you go to trader joes. The other restaurants aren't as good,UNK
4007,Run of the mill bar with dirty floors and extremely loud music.,UNK
4008,"Young man was very helpful in getting me into a new pair of Levis, but I was surprised at the lighting in this store.  It is very gloomy and dark... weird for a Dillards.",UNK
4009,"I have tried a few of the burgers and dogs here and loved every one. This is a former Boston Market location and is essentially set up the same way. Don't be in a hurry, this is not fast food.",UNK
4010,"Used to be one of our favorite places.\nPortion sizes have probably halved, prices have probably doubled.\nThe service is terrible, the food is still amazing but everything else sucks!\nHow do you get 1/2 the food for double the price?",UNK
4011,"Completely downhill in the past few months as the management changed and a lot of the staff in general have changed.  NOW HIRING sign has been up for awhile, so perhaps the fault rests with understaffing.",UNK
4012,"Beautiful restaurant, superior waitstaff, fair price and VERY nicely prepared curry, rolls and H/S soup. they are conservative with salt so a dash of soy puts it together for my taste. Actually a nice way to serve Chinese! A new favorite for me!",UNK
4013,They don't open till 12pm - if you have an early lunch time you are out of luck. Food and service is good though.,UNK
4014,"This place is a joke, wait 20 minutes for a the , the front counter person was rude, parking is a disaster , and the place is small and cramped , what the hell am I paying for? Be warned this is the worst la fitness in town  or maybe the whole state.",UNK
4015,Good sports bar. Love the wings but be careful. Hot is really hot! Good burgers and fries. Would like more craft beers but they seem to prefer the basics. The focaccia sate awesome. This has become our go to sports bar.,UNK
4016,"Tried a premade salad, NASTY! Maybe the pizza would have been a better choice. Many people seemed satisfied.",UNK
4017,"We stayed here as part of a tour group.  The location was good, the room was nice, the bed was comfortable, the pillows not.  The bathroom was okay, the sink was dated and chipped, the air conditioning never worked properly.  It wasn't a horrible experience, just so-so.",UNK
4018,"Not for me. Typical college bar with typical prices. That said, if I were a freshman in college with a fake ID, this would be ideal. I would find somewhere else if you are older than 21 years old.",UNK
4019,oooh moist creaminess.,UNK
4020,We come here for mid-night snacks (yep! we eat a lot!)\nI must say their Prime Rib for $5.99-7.99 is really good.,UNK
4021,If you like chocolate you are in for a treat (pun intended).  The over-the-top choclatyness of this place gets overwhelming fast but if you pace yourself and keep your portions small it's worth the indulgence of wallet and diet.,UNK
4022,I really like this spot! No complaints :),UNK
4023,"Bigger is not always better, and this place proves it. The sandwiches are plenty, and the dishes are heaping, but the food is not flavorful. Add salt & pepper! Very clean and always busy, so nothing bad... Just decent.",UNK
4024,"The food is wonderful but mistakes are often made. We order there quite a bit and it's almost never specifically what we ordered. We keep ordering though, as I said the food is really good.",UNK
4025,It's a fun place to go with a big group of friends. With indoor and outdoor bar seating I really enjoy sitting back on the patio. The blood orange margarita is my most preferable drink. The food there is decent. The service is as well.,UNK
4026,This place sucks. Bagel with butter or cream cheese means you have to put in on yourself. So the pricey fee for a bagel must be for all their manual labor. Not. I waited 15 minutes for a plain bagel. Unacceptable.,UNK
4027,Thanksgiving dinner at $75 per head was very disappointing last evening.  The food was just average at best.  The food was bland and uninspired.  We will not return here.,UNK
4028,"Can still say that I haven't been disappointed having gone back to the Blue Saguaro  Jen is right.  The menu may not change but it;s always a good eat,",UNK
4029,"Love coming to this place but not if the staff is rude. Brianna, fat shaming people won't make you look or feel any better! Won't be visiting this location again unless I know she is no longer working there.",UNK
4030,A very nice store. the usual cashiers and bag boy  that ignore you and and make you feel like you are interupeding them.,UNK
4031,"We ordered delivery pizza for our first try of Barro's and it was good. Although for thin crust, the crispiness did not survive the drive.  I like the flavor and want to try eating in.  I am not a fan of most delivery pizza but this was good.",UNK
4032,By far the worst manicure I got. The lady named yen hates doing nails she complained about her back hurting and having arthritis in her hands . She kept pushing my hand in the dryer got red all on the sides of my fingers and the polish kept wrinkling,UNK
4033,I really want to like this location... They are always very nice but EVERY SINGLE TIME I stop - it's completely empty and I end up waiting 15 to 20 min for food... Sorry guys but you are losing a ton of business !!!,UNK
4034,still definitely prefer red mango in korea but the pom yogurt was delish as anticipated =),UNK
4035,Awesome Atmosphere and Awesome Beer.  Great building with plenty of outdoor seating.  Got the Fish n Chips and they did not dissapoint.,UNK
4036,Terrible service.  Bad food.  Manager was rude and they forgot parts of our order and refused to split a check.  Not going back.,UNK
4037,"Service is ok, only if u know Spanish. Shrimp quesadilla is no good, the tiny mini steam shrimp in between two piece of tortillas. \n\nI don't think I would go back.",UNK
4038,Been here 2 Times. dissapointed. \nI ve Been to tao Dubai & losangeles & Compared to them. \n\nSkip this One & go to TAO,UNK
4039,"It may not be the \""best\"" sushi in town, but it's so much fun. Potato Mountain Rules! Great value.",UNK
4040,"Big fan of Munchies. Salty, greasy Greek food between 5 - 10 dollars for a meal. Good daily lunch specials. Be careful on your way back from Mill, as the price hike between 6pm and 2am is noticeable the next morning.",UNK
4041,"Completely chill environment. I pretty much always get the chicken quesadilla which is awesome, so I really can't comment on anything else. The prices are good and the service is quick.",UNK
4042,I seriously did not know this was a smaller version of Mrs. Buttersfileds. The wait time was super long and the dining area was super tight. Food is just as good as the mother restaurant. I recommend Butters if you are ever in the area.,UNK
4043,Good beer. Decent food.,UNK
4044,Good food... Nice and clean,UNK
4045,"I've been using them for 4 years because of their close proximity to my house but I've stopped.  Too many issues the last 6 months with clothes 2-3 days late, items missing, and very inconsistent customer service.  The staff turnover is very, very high.",UNK
4046,"Sweet little place for a treat or get something for breakfast, 2nd floor of the building. Also milk tea, and some other beverages. Too bad they can't put a few chairs outside on the balcony, it was a lovely night when we were there.",UNK
4047,"These guys do great work in a timely manner. Chris is always a pleasure to do business with and really understands how to help small business owners.\nAny type of custom signage needs, they can help. From design to install, they have you covered.",UNK
4048,"I am weary of hot yoga (It is too easy to overstretch) and the classes here are definitely hot.  But for what it is, Amazing Yoga does a very good job.  I agree with the comments that the facilities could benefit from changing rooms (you'll need to change after going!)",UNK
4049,Great eatery!!!!   The service was a bit slow but nice atmosphere and great food!!!,UNK
4050,The room was nice and the hotel was clean but there was a lot of mechanical noise. $18 for parking is a bit much.,UNK
4051,"A great, no frills, clean, cheap, free coffee place to stay. Newly renovated. Great location in downtown Phoenix. We were in room 217.",UNK
4052,"We went here on a saturday night, about an hour before close. I appreciated how the wait staff offered to make any dish we wanted fresh. They watched what we and other patrons were taking off the buffet and quickly made up small portions to replace. The selection is pretty good and varied.",UNK
4053,"The location is great. Fresh brew iced tea would be welcome. The menu is fine, but I think that they could review what is on it and see what could be tweaked, improved or refined.",UNK
4054,If you want to wait in line for horrible overpriced food and bad service here is the place. Do not go here.,UNK
4055,Grapefruit served squeezed\nA very fluffy pancake\nWhat a great ham steak\n--\nQuality is guaranteed here.,UNK
4056,Love this place! Smoke meat is really good. The only problem : its really small and elbow to elbow seating isn't really pleasant.,UNK
4057,Kids loved it. Not enough to do with the smaller kids.,UNK
4058,Portions are small compared to other Thai restaurants in the area overall its good food (ordered the pad Thai ),UNK
4059,"Worst food. They don't know how to make dal tadka, mutter paneer infact not even masala papad. They should realize idli is not whiskey, the older the better.",UNK
4060,"Interesting menu, great service. Really good alternative to a chain breakfast experience!",UNK
4061,OMG! If you have kids steer clear. No children's menu and they don't care... They make you feel like a big bother!,UNK
4062,Service terrible. Sushi par at best. Better sushi places out there. My salmon sashimi had bones in it.,UNK
4063,"Forgot my cheese for my sandwiches, but didnt forget to charge me! Then when I decided to stand up for all those out there who have been shorted their order, they were closed! You win this round, Wendys. 2 stars for my 2 missing cheeses.",UNK
4064,Just read others reviews but stoped in anyway the husband and I were told everyone is going to lunch....We wont be back. I hate when people give me a nasty attitude.,UNK
4065,Love their breakfast burritos!! Haven't tried anything else there but very happy with the breakfast!!,UNK
4066,Beautiful location. Very long and very boring.  Definitely just a one time thing. You can become bored quick and easily.,UNK
4067,We had a groupon and decided to try it out. It wasn't hAppy hour and my draft bud light was $5. The appetizers were so-so. It's a great atmosphere and would be fun after a game.,UNK
4068,"Not a bad Starbucks, at this point everyone should know how these run and what they carry so I won't get into it.  Service is decent but unless you go real early expect to wait in line for awhile.",UNK
4069,"Food was good. Service was fast. Only a 3 star for the petty reason of 39 cents for a ranch packet. Not a total game breaker, but it's the small things that annoy me.",UNK
4070,Great for groups for cheese and desserts not for dinner. I like to be served not to cook my own meal ep for over $100 bill,UNK
4071,Slow as fudgesicles.,UNK
4072,"What a nice venue for a concert, we have been here several times for other events and had a great time.",UNK
4073,This place has a line always very ghetto the employees are slow and curse .....very very unprofessional bums outside and I feel like im shopping at a second hand corner store,UNK
4074,Management at this location is terrible. How could you be a nationwide chain and not have capability to void a receipt so that I could adequately tip your employee.?!,UNK
4075,"GUYS, THE FRIES....what are you going to do about the soggy fries?  Customers are looking for hot, crispy fries and you continue to fail in that delivery.  It really takes away from the excellent burgers you serve up.",UNK
4076,"Great beer selection, with descriptions for those of us who want to learn more about the art of beer tasting! The brat was delicious, but the bun was a little dry. Great happy hour & fun atmosphere- would come back for sure! A welcome change from the typical Mill Ave restaurants/bars.",UNK
4077,Went on a Saturday morning at 11. Place was empty but the servers were friendly.  Used an Amazon Local voucher. Good food. The onion rings were really good!,UNK
4078,"Great bourbon selection, awesome atmosphere, and a total let down due to lackluster bartenders.  Was hoping for great cocktails, but was disappointed.  Creativity and enthusiam distinctly absent.",UNK
4079,food was fresh and authentic but way overpriced. owner was nice and so was girl behind counter will I be back maybe but only ordering food once you add in $2 drinks and $3 desserts the bill begins to rack up,UNK
4080,"Not the best haircut, nor the worst, I might go back, I might not...I keep waiting to find a reason to stay.  The price was good enough that I'll give it one more try and update you then!",UNK
4081,"Previously we've had great dinners at pieros. Last night something went horribly wrong. Smug and surly service, mediocre food and high prices are seldom a good combination. That's what we got in spades. \n\nAVOID!!!",UNK
4082,I recommend this place as a must go only because you get great views of the strip take some photos and then leave. Except for the views which are amazing there is nothing else going for it.,UNK
4083,Cute place to visit with friends,UNK
4084,Not impressed.  Convenient location.  Decent food.  Salad was good.  How hard can it be to make a black and tan that is black....  and tan?,UNK
4085,Central Coffee is one of two favorites in the QC. Extra friendly staff and just straight up GREAT coffee!!,UNK
4086,How does a new battery take 3 hours to install? \nI had 1/2 a mind to push my dead car to Advance Auto,UNK
4087,You get what you pay for!,UNK
4088,"Everything about this place screams authentic Italian food. Went with my family, got this incredible pasta dish, literally everything I have tried so far from them has been spectacular! It is a little pricey but worth it",UNK
4089,"After having a bad experience and informing the management, Dean and Deluca went above and beyond in improving my perception of the market.  Way to go!",UNK
4090,Room was large and had a laminate wood floor which was nice (hotel carpets are so gross).  They did overcharge me at the front desk by $5 a night which I did not catch til I left.  Not a good place to walk around at night but otherwise a good stay.,UNK
4091,"We came here for a private party and tried to order a Rye Manhattan and the idiot server said \"" like rye bread? \"" forget this place, including the dishwater pasta.",UNK
4092,While the food is usually very good. This time I went and I am a regular that tips 20%+. My partner and I were completely ignored. We allowed 15 minutes. It will be a long time before I return.,UNK
4093,There was a 40 minute line for a car... And so many people waiting. I would anywhere rather than wait that long... Not recommended,UNK
4094,I base my rating on the first and last impression of this venue. Parking. Plan for an hour to get in and at least an hour to get out. We will never be back. This venue should be embarrased. Venues double the size can get patrons in and out faster.,UNK
4095,"I arrived fifteen minutes early. I was not seen until an hour and a half after my appt time. I walked in after a lady. She left I still was not seen until twenty minutes after she left. The office was clean, service in my opinion was poor.",UNK
4096,Wasnt the cleanest place any time ive gone. Prices of the drinks were always changing. Only decent thing was the music.,UNK
4097,"Great food, friendly service. We both had the Stromboli and they were huge! The food did take a while to come out but it was worth the wait.",UNK
4098,"The hotel itself is beautiful, but way too big. There is always a conference of some sort going on, so be prepared to wait 10-20 minutes for an elevator. Not very efficient. It's also very loud. Excellent pool though.",UNK
4099,"Cheap, good comfort food. This place has been around a long time, the wait staff is super friendly, and the tea is super sweet.\n\nYou can't go wrong with their fried fish-it was delicious!, or the meat and two they have every day.",UNK
4100,"Horrible service! especially on NFL Sundays. We waited over an hour for an order of wings and a pizza. The wings were tough, and the pizza was cold. The bartender screwed up on a simple rum and coke, and the servers were not all that friendly either.",UNK
4101,"The food was average at best. I spent three days here and had 3 lunches and 3 breakfasts here. Something, likely one if their salads did not agree with me and I was reminded about it for about 18-24 hours.",UNK
4102,"This place was horrible!  Thw waitress was very nice, however it took 40 minutes to get our soup and grilled cheese.  When we got the soup.....of course it was cold and it was not good at all!",UNK
4103,The 4 cheese ravioli was great but the service was awful. The menu items were pretty pricey as well.,UNK
4104,"Too crowded and overheated during peak times after work, and they charge you unnecessarily for two months after you quit.",UNK
4105,"Wow! If you are ever in Florence Arizona or just passing thru, this place is definitely worth the stop. Great thin crust pizza! I didn't get a chance to try their desserts but I will next time for sure.",UNK
4106,"Not impressed so far.  Showed up at 11:30 and they had no rooms avail with a King Size Bed, which was requested.  When I got into the room, the toilet was filled to the rim with the last guests lunch...Nice!",UNK
4107,Was definitely worth the money even though the ride was too short! Worth doing with your loved one especially when you go underneath the bridge! ;-),UNK
4108,"it was ok.. all i got was a pizza and salad, and it took forever, pizza wasnt that great salad was, ok...overall, get entree menus or nothing..",UNK
4109,"Why does yelp force us to at least give one star? Yelp should realize some places deserve a negative rating. This place is one of them. Overpriced, badly cooked.",UNK
4110,The biscuit was great. The grits were great. The apple butter is amazing. A great breakfast spot.,UNK
4111,Lots of artisans and an improvement to the downtown area!,UNK
4112,"Made 2 appts n waited all afternoon for them then got txts saying they cant make, not wasting anymore time on this unreliable service",UNK
4113,Lords food,UNK
4114,"So happy they opened this at Red Rock! Food was great! Service was good! They just opened last week and you can tell they are still working the kinks out. Will be back, hopefully they will have it more together then.",UNK
4115,"1 star for not being open at 10:30pm for a pick-up order on a Saturday night of all nights, despite an 11pm closing time as stated on Yelp.",UNK
4116,Horrible greasy food.\nGm didn't care at all when we complained.\nManagement reflects overall very poor experience. My tummy still hurts!,UNK
4117,Excellent food and very impressed with services. The waiter Conor was awesome .I shared with him my list of food allergies and next thing you know the General Manager  Jason took my list show it to the chef and I end  up having a great meal . Very grateful Thank you.,UNK
4118,They don't deliver!!,UNK
4119,Food was good.\nThe staff was a bit unprofessional.,UNK
4120,"I called to place an order for delivery and the guy simply stated \""we have a $30 minimum and you have to place the order through grub hub\"" and then hung up. Congratulations on losing a customer before ever even earning one.",UNK
4121,After several issues with this location we no longer use them and have taken our business elsewhere. Good luck. Poor  service does cost you.,UNK
4122,"This place just bored me.\nReally don't know what to say.\nBored, bored, bored, bored, bored.",UNK
4123,"Very very noisy and chaotic. Great food but our server was clearly overwhelmed and, while pleasant, was mildly neglectful (long wait to get menus and to order; took a few tries to get pepper on table).",UNK
4124,"Still no communication from TOCA, they obviously do not care about their customers. Oh that's right, we are not customers, we are patients. I was corrected by their staff. Thanks for pointing that out!",UNK
4125,"Worst service I have ever had at a hooters restaurant. Order took 20min and it was wrong! Totally disorganized staff. What a joke! It was like watching a \""Hell's Kitchen\"" episode! LOL!!!",UNK
4126,"The food here is very bland, nothing special. But it'll have to do as there aren't very many veggie places in Vegas (as expected).",UNK
4127,"The son of the owners of Los Dos Molinos will do well here. Good draw from the neighborhood, great Tequilas, and terrific food!",UNK
4128,Been here twice.  Both times loved the cupcakes.  It's now my go-to treat for my daughter. Yummy!!,UNK
4129,The sushi wasn't anything spectacular for the amount of money that I spent. there are a ton of more delicious sushi elsewhere for the fraction of the cost that I spent on my group of friends for dinner here. I guess you pay for location not food !,UNK
4130,"It's a good alternative to Starbucks, but the taste isn't that much different. The guy with the weird ponytail (not the owner) is kinda annoying though.",UNK
4131,The service was fantastic and the meat quality was excellent.  But the restaurant had a dirty wet sponge smell to it.\n\nPlenty of meat and sides to go around.  The salad bar was ok.,UNK
4132,"Overrated. Food was mediocre, wait was long and even the famed frozen hot chocolate wasn't all that great and definitely not worth the price.",UNK
4133,I have eaten here for years and it is usually pretty good.  But it it smokey as fuck.  They need to get their hood fixed or upgraded for the health of their employees and patrons.  Surprised it would be up to code in its current state.,UNK
4134,"Soggy bun, Overcooked patty, Frozen fries, Terrible service.  This was probably the worst lunch I've ever had.  Seriously you can get a better burger at McDonalds.",UNK
4135,Horrible!! 2 hours in queue,UNK
4136,The service was excellent. The food was incredible considering it was only 475 calories. Portions were even good.,UNK
4137,Great food and great customer service! My favorite BBQ place. The Prime Rib they occasionally have is so delicious. Highly recommended.,UNK
4138,"What happen to the service ?  The staff at the old location was more friendly and responsive. I am always waiting to pick up my order. The pizza is a still great, but the service at the new location is poor. Management needs to get involved and improve the service.",UNK
4139,Worst hotel. Just checking in was a horrific experience. Over half an hour to tell us they don't have a room ready even though we paid for it,UNK
4140,"The food was fresh n healthy, a little over priced for the portions.",UNK
4141,Kinda wonky... dirty carpet and garish castle. Kinda motel-ish more than a hotel and I stayed pre recession so it wasn't cheap...,UNK
4142,There was nobody running the drive through of this location at 1130pm on a Monday night. I stopped in and waited for about 5 minutes at the drive through. I was never greeted or served. Needless to say I was very disappointed to have wasted my time and gas driving to this location for nothing.,UNK
4143,"The food is ok. But for the prices it should be much better. Some people really love this place, but I just don't understand their excitement. The atmosphere is pleasant and relaxing.",UNK
4144,Turned me on to Sweet Potato Fries!! SOOOO good,UNK
4145,"The service was friendly and efficient, but the food was just ok.  For all of the dining choices in Vegas, I would not run back to this place!  There are other Mexican restaurants with better food and atmosphere.",UNK
4146,My breakfast was disgusting last time. Waits have been so long! Waiter was dull. My eggs were half cooked. Way over priced.,UNK
4147,"don't see many live shows to compare this to. but as an average guy watching it  i found it rather entertaining. orchestra, vocals, costumes and the specially built theater collectively made this a nice night. at about 1 1/2 hours it is just about right.",UNK
4148,"Great service, delicious cannoli's, great pizza crust!  Place is a little small and it gets busy.",UNK
4149,"Ordered delivery, cashew chicken and crab puffs, i took one bite of the chicken and spit it out, it was awful!! The crab puffs were ok, but the chicken was terrible! I spent 20 bucks and'now have to go spend more",UNK
4150,This place is pretty good. I have been going here for about a year now. The prices are the best. I get 5 or 6 items dry cleaned for about $15,UNK
4151,"Great place, nice people, superb service!",UNK
4152,"Love this place. Great selection, of burgers and fries. Sign up for their special offers.",UNK
4153,"I'm fairly certain this is the first restaurant I've eaten in where the server was chewing gum.    4 or 5 visits, but I think I'm done, none to write home about.  That's all I've got to say.",UNK
4154,Good Food but terrible service.\n\nWaiters are always very rude and short.\nthey need an attitude adjustment!!\n\nwould get five stars if they had better service,UNK
4155,Terrible service terrible food so to sum up terrible!!,UNK
4156,"Staff is friendly. Food is good not great. I still like going here a couple times a week. The margherita's have NO alcohol, won't be ordering those anymore.",UNK
4157,For one... The serve was terrible. Had to asked the server 3x for katsup. Could barely get refills and on top of all that.  The food was cold. I will never go back there again. What a waste. Told the manager.,UNK
4158,I agree with other reviewers quality vs price isn't there. Had the eggs Benedict wAs sub-par and & $14 bucks.had a side of bacon which was over cooked and dry.dont get caught up in the hype of this place. Lots of better places to go.,UNK
4159,Say what this place is not good at all. Please pass unless you liked over cooked and over priced Mexican Food. Never again will we eat this nasty food.,UNK
4160,Food tasted good but for tacos it is was pricey. Not a lot of seating either. I had the lobster taco which was 20$ but was small. Drinks are good though. They only have one Bench for a large group other than that go with only one friend.,UNK
4161,The food did not taste great and my husbands order came out on the cold side. :/ We will not be going back as we were not impressed.,UNK
4162,Took us 10 minutes to be seated and there was nobody else ahead of us in line. Not at all a traditional sushi place at all with terrible costumer service,UNK
4163,Their mango lasso is mixed with too much yogurt,UNK
4164,"Great food but not a great value. This is an expensive restaurant relative to the portion size. This is not a good value compared to most Asian restaurants but it is a different experience. Food tasted great, just relatively too expensive.",UNK
4165,"great indian food! they have a little different menu from the ordinary indian places, they have a lot of  \""modern dishes\"" which is basically they put a little twist to the traditional indian dishes!",UNK
4166,It's alright for my lunch break if it lands during the happy hour.  The atmosphere is nice.  I've yet to be amazed there yet and there is much better sushi joints in Vegas.,UNK
4167,"Food was warm at best, some cold. Only two sugar free/nsa items oj the desert line and both were dry/stale. usually a very good buffet, but disappointing this time",UNK
4168,"This is a great savers location! Best place to find unique costume items. Great selection. Parking is limited. Beware of Wendy's lot next door, lots of tow signs.",UNK
4169,"I walked out (12-30-14, 2:30 PM) in disgust after female server tried to seat me in a tiny booth even though there were many bigger booths and tables available. Asked to talk to manager but told he wasn't available.",UNK
4170,"Cool atmosphere, quick friendly service, sup par pad thai. Good meat, overcooked noodles, no heat.",UNK
4171,"Loved this place , dinner was good :)  food is too much to eat though :)\nI liked the ambience , it's cozy n bright :) I feel bad for eating after my gym though :(",UNK
4172,"Good prices, and they opened a check stand just as we go in line and they do this all the time. Nice clerks and the selections are great. Oh and SALE ON Gatorade",UNK
4173,Good traditional Mexican food.  Quick too.\n\nExcellent shredded chicken!,UNK
4174,Business trip brought me to Montreal. Room was clean and contemporary. Bed was comfortable. Coffee was really good that hotel served at business meetings. \n\nI would recommend hotel for business travelers. Close walking distance to sights.,UNK
4175,now in Tempe Enterprize one of my friends rented a Nissan LEAF for 2 weeks. You have to ask and hope you get the person who can connect you up.\nMaybe the Tesla will be available for renting some day.,UNK
4176,Typical downtown Starbucks -nice seating and the fact they have free wi if is always a good thing! Within walking distance of businesses very. Busy-friendly staff and always accurate orders with fresh ingredients,UNK
4177,The food was entirely inedible. Had the chicken teriyaki bowl and it was cold. The egg drop soup was off and the service was terrible. I've never not eaten what was placed in front of me but we are all leaving our food. I strongly recommend you go anywhere else.,UNK
4178,"Yummy and great!   Awesome rolls.   The Salmon Bomber is probably one of the best rolls I have ever had, at any sushi joint, but watch out, it's spicy!",UNK
4179,Very bad. I won't be back. The first sign was there were no Asians eating there. Should have been a clue. Having lived in several Asian countries for many years I know what authentic Thai food is. This isn't it.,UNK
4180,"Pork chops were not well seasoned, noodles are too mooshy, food was too sweet, definitely overrated.",UNK
4181,"VERY clean place and the person behind the counter was very nice and helpful. The chicken is good and the menu has alot going for it. The only reason it's not 5 stars, is that the chicken is good, but not great. But hey, great friend chicken is rare ;)",UNK
4182,"If I could rate this place -5, I would. \nWorst service ever. Horrible food. And absolutely no understanding of how to treat customers. Left after what they call 'beef carpaccio' showed up... more like a mushy raw meat pizza.",UNK
4183,"I went there on Thanksgiving with a singles group. Nice atmosphere and an excellent server, but the meal was nasty. I wasn't even going to touch the yams! Apple pie was crusty and hard..no desire to finish it. We really enjoyed the rocking chairs though!",UNK
4184,Their expertise consist of a former web designer. Great if your looking for a website--If not RUN this place has horrible management! And the prices....well just call and find out for yourself!,UNK
4185,Dim sum food came out cold.. Service is poor.. No detail on check out bill..I will not come here at all ...,UNK
4186,Best way to describe this place is fast food Chinese. Food was not fresh and was previously prepared. Rice was dry.,UNK
4187,"They consistently succeed at inconsistency.  Sometimes my order is correct, other days it's a surprise.  They have good ice coffee for a reasonable price.",UNK
4188,Nice locals spot,UNK
4189,"The guacamole is what deserves a five star review! The pomegranate seeds add such a flavor kick, it's melt in your mouth! \n\nThe overall menu and service is pretty good, but nothing that stands out.",UNK
4190,Worst  experience  ever!! The hostess was rude. The waitress was rude and the manager Joe was worse!  I think Amy's Bakery has met its match! The food was as bad as the service.,UNK
4191,"If John Lennon and George Harrison rose from the dead to play one more Beatles concert at the Nile, I wouldn't go.  It was easily 90 degrees inside and they actually have the audacity to charge $2 for a re-entry wristband.",UNK
4192,Summertime happy hour weeknights until 7:00PM- beer and margaritas under $3.00.,UNK
4193,I have had a few extraordinary dishes there and a a couple that missed the mark. Skip the hour wait at RnR and go there for bottomless momosas with your Sunday brunch.,UNK
4194,Horrible service for a place that is totally empty. Bartender is extremely unfriendly and works at a snails pace. Food menu is from Stop N Shop (Gas Station) across from parking lot. No reason to stop and go inside unless you waiting for food from Roberto's.,UNK
4195,"I think they really shine with fall & winter menus and have enjoyed some good meals at the original Table 274. We went to this location a week or two ago and everything we got was only \""ok.\"" Glad we had a groupon.",UNK
4196,"Daaaaayum, everything is expensive. The only things that weren't were the souvenir shot glasses in the middle aisle for .99 haha. Sigh haha.",UNK
4197,This place is now closed. It is now called Pittsburgh burgers. Just past by and saw the sign. Hope their food will be better!,UNK
4198,"This Target makes me feel like i'm in a Walmart, not a good thing! The whole layout is cramped and there is no Pizza Hut Express. Service is slow and staff doesn't want to help :(",UNK
4199,Updated since they did finally give our money back.  Still beware.,UNK
4200,"Shwarma bowl with everything on it is pure heaven. The pita chips and hummus is always tasty as well. Just slightly overpriced by a dollar or two; but I like the small setting, everything is visible from the counter, and the food is always delicious.",UNK
4201,"Great place. Friendly/efficient service and delicious food. Got a three combo platter, was plenty of food and was able to take a taco home. Generous amount of chips. Frozen margarita was strong. Definitely going back.",UNK
4202,Hilarious. I like his style even though he's freaky to look at. But you know what? The fact he looks so freaky is a part of his act.,UNK
4203,Not very friendly! I mailed a package today and had my 2 young kids with me and they rushed me out of the way at the self kiosk so they could help someone else.,UNK
4204,Food is good. Lady at the front desk with attitude bad. She acted like she was doing me a favor by me eating there. When will Charlotte get a restaurant with hand pulled noodles?,UNK
4205,"overall food wasnt half bad, my major issue was so -called hostess chasing our car down the street because we had the nerve to use gift certificate to pay for our order, never have i been treated so poorly ,my only advice if you decide to go is bring cash and lots of it",UNK
4206,"3 dart machines, a Foosball, a shuffleboard. Wouldn't call this a place for games. Upstairs opens at 11? What's up there that's not open at 9? But as a bonus, drinks are cheap, staff is friendly. Great job.",UNK
4207,"I actually enjoyed this Pool Party Ditch Fridays! No cover charge, music was good, ambiance was good! Food & Drink are always expensive I mean its Vegas!! But when you get in free, why complain!!",UNK
4208,Chips and salsa are good. Great happy hr. specials,UNK
4209,"I didn't try the food, so that is the only things holding back another star.  Went there for girls night out and had a blast.  The band was amazing, crowd was fun, staff was attentive.  It was just a great night!  I would recommend.",UNK
4210,Knowlegable but very pushy and sales-y. He did more talking than listening to me about what my problems are. Was also turned off by the HcG diet advertisement they had outside their door.,UNK
4211,"Great food but terrible terrible service, called an an order and almost after one whole hour after promise time food finally came out for pick up to go. It really is too bad that they went out of business because the food was really good.",UNK
4212,I said I would re review this place... I would recommend this place! The food was delicious but it's not an inexpensive lunch,UNK
4213,"This place is tons of fun! \nI stopped in with my family to have oysters and beer and we ended up eating and drinking for a couple of hours. \n\nGreat ambiance, friendly service and good food.",UNK
4214,I love that they have a gluten free menu.  The gf pancake is a nice rare splurge.  Beware! It's totally addictive.   Best part? Real whipped butter.,UNK
4215,"Pretty cool sports bar with great TV coverage, had a party of 12 so did apps and hordevres. Drinks were good but a little pricey and need better selection on whiskey.",UNK
4216,Love this place since it was tea planet.,UNK
4217,Good size room. Decent pool area.,UNK
4218,"Good food, service a little slow, a little dated and you do have to put up with a lot of whiney elderly clientele who send the waiter back for a lot of petty trivial stuff that takes away from handling other customers,  more like babysitting seniors.",UNK
4219,"The mini donuts are gone. I hear they are going to bring some other people in to try and do it, but forget it.\nThe family that ran it made them best.\nIts all downhill from here, Im afraid",UNK
4220,"Uggh...typical LCB store.  Bad selection, bad atmosphere, bad attitudes.",UNK
4221,i hate this wall mart its soo small and dirty and the staff are rude,UNK
4222,This place is closed down,UNK
4223,"The food was good. A bit spicy,. the chips and salsa oh plenty. Salsa a bit warm, but Im a grengo. Price somewhat high. Didn't have a lunch menu? All- in all would try again.",UNK
4224,Very good food with a great value. We enjoyed every dish we ordered.,UNK
4225,"It's a shame- the burgers are actually good but I can't get over seeing the employee scoop my fries with his bare hands.  Ewwww.  Luckily, I said something & got new, untouched fries but can't shake the image",UNK
4226,Check out my blog review and photos:\n\nhttp://food-tales-and-other-fun.tumblr.com/post/24344649924/,UNK
4227,Really less quantity and totally dis-interested service .. Wasted my money here today ..,UNK
4228,waiting in line is worth it...but the hostess was rude and the music is way too loud!,UNK
4229,Food here is TERRIBLE!! I think the price is too much. The oysters are frozen instead of fresh. The sushi rice are spoiled!!!! Unacceptable! I won't recommend this buffet restaurant.,UNK
4230,Machines are very old - many out-of-order. Premises not very clean.  A tacky place.  Will not go there again.,UNK
4231,Me and the hubby ordered the meatloaf sandwich.... We should have ordered just one and split it it was sooooooo huge.... but so delicious and we had leftovers.,UNK
4232,"Big portions of food but very loud and crowded. I can barely have a conversation here!\n\nVery dimly lit, i would say this place would not be ideal for a date but more like a drunken gathering with lots of margaritas!",UNK
4233,Pretty bad. Owner could have cared less to even say hello or goodbye.\n\nItalian Beef was far from anything I ever had in Chicago. If you want good Italian beef look to Lukes or even the frozen stuff at Costco. It's better trust me.,UNK
4234,Coffee sucks!  It's just tan water.  Brought it to their attention .  They said it was all remeasured and there was nothing they could do.  Don't drink the coffee!!,UNK
4235,1st time here.  Both ordered Monte Christo sandwiches.  You know its not good when the food comes out in less than 10 minutes.  Soggy sandwich.  Cold potatoes.  Ice tea and coffee just plain bad.  Won't get a second chance... plus side-waitress very nice.,UNK
4236,It was good pho but overpriced.  Paying for the convenience of staying on the strip and not having to drive to China Town.,UNK
4237,I have reservations for 3 weeks from now and I have to say I am a little scared based on the reviews so far. I am hoping I cannot believe everything I read here since this will be my birthday trip and I have not been to Vegas in 20 years. SLS I am looking to be impressed.,UNK
4238,I only come to Albertson's to shop for dairy products like eggs and milk as they always have sales on those 2 items.  They stop taking your discount cards to save all the hassles and reduce speeds.  Great location right inside Desert Ridge Marketplace and the JW Marriott Desert Ridge.,UNK
4239,"this is certainly my favorite brunch spot in town.  a plethora of teas, tasty individual french presses of coffee, vegan cakes...\nalso a nice place to take grown-ups or people who take really good care of their bodies.",UNK
4240,"Service was just adequate with a very nice but strange waitress.\n\nFood is also, again, just adequate.  Some dishes are good, others bland.  \n\nOverall I probably won't go back; there are just too many better options in Madison.",UNK
4241,"YUM! This place is good. Fried pickles, Rotisserie Chicken, cole slaw!\nI did not try the fried chicken and waffles but saw many having it and smiling so it must have been good. Recommend!",UNK
4242,"the cookies were ok, nothing special. I asked if they were a bakery; which means they make the food on site. I was told that they get the doughs frozen from their factory and they (cashiers, not bakers) bake them.",UNK
4243,"Really people?!?!?!?!  After reading so many great reviews, I had to try to this place.  We ordered the Western Special....what a big disappointment  :( \nI guess I had really high expectations...prolly won't return.",UNK
4244,This piece of shit place doesn't even answer the phone. How are THEY still in business with SUCH SHIT SERVICE!!!!,UNK

4246,"Good ribs, amazing hot links and service with a smile!",UNK
4247,"Watch out , the staff tries to solict your girlfriend for another guest. The punk kids that work there think they are so cool. Are they are hostesses, like in restaurant. I stick with XS next time.",UNK
4248,"More bar than restaurant. The food is what you would expect from a bar. They have a dartboard. They have their own draft called hoot - available by pitcher. Interesting decor - movies, sports, etc. Excellent, friendly service.",UNK
4249,"I usually Order from here a lot, it normal takes 20 mins for them to get here but today when the answered the phone the lady was RUDE!! & Deaf. They took an hour to get here but all in all it was delicious",UNK
4250,This place is entirely what you would expect: okay fast mexican food at a reasonable price and nothing more.,UNK
4251,terrible always a long line no matter the time of day for keys and package pickup. Can't wait until the post office goes out of business and UPS takes over! Avoid spending any of your hard earned money at the post office use FedEx or UPS!,UNK
4252,"If you use drive through unwrap and check your order before you leave.  They just leave items out of the bag, and when you get home part of your order is missing.  After years of regular visits I'm never going back.",UNK
4253,decent sized mall with a fair variety of stores to browse and shop.,UNK
4254,Did not have what I was looking for and weren't very helpful or friendly. Not a fan.,UNK
4255,Don't know why everyone gets so excited about this chain unless it's because it's so cheap!?  The patties are so thin they are practically non-existent!!,UNK
4256,I have been here for 40 minutes and still waiting to be seen while the employees are just chatting away up front. I guess they only have one doctor? Probably will not come back again.,UNK
4257,"Bad, bad, bad. They said 45-50 minutes and it didn't get here for an hour and a half. Their flyer prices totalled $15 but they charged $19. \n\nDon't order here!  Anywhere else.",UNK
4258,I sent an email thru the Mastro website to let them know I got food poisoning at one of their restaurants. No response from them yet. I guess the restaurant doesn't care about their customers...,UNK
4259,I'm so sad that they closed this place down and turned it into a Mexican cantina. They had the best tapas and sangria happy hour in Las Vegas!,UNK
4260,"They charged a cover, were stingy with the liquor, and the DJ sucked. Disappointing.",UNK
4261,WAY overpriced for what we got.  The room was musty and the food was so-so.  Very disappointed.,UNK
4262,Don't walk by.  Run by this place and don't look back.  The worst Mexican food in Phoenix.  Absolutely no flavor. The only thing going for it is the friendly wait staff.,UNK
4263,"Hooters has closed this location, sorry.",UNK
4264,Wow! By far the WORST manicure I've ever had!!!!!\nHorrible service. \nDo yourself a favor and go to the nail place next to Pita Jungle. They do a super job and are very courtious and friendly.,UNK
4265,"Always busy!  Very friendly staff.  If they make an error, they will make it right.  Love the menu selection.  The chicken is cooked right there on large rotisserie burners.  The cilantro dressing is to die for!  Love the little salsa bar!",UNK
4266,"Great place.  The drinks are excellent.  It's what I would call Alsatian fare, so if that's your scene, Sardine is the place for you.",UNK
4267,"Had a lunch-sized pizza which was really good and the friend that I with said he always has good meals there. Clean, efficient, with friendly staff. The only thing keeping it from 4 stars was the price. A tad too pricey to eat here for lunch regularly.",UNK
4268,Monster Framing & Art Gallery really helped me make the right choice for a romantic gift.  These guys are really knowledgeable about all the different options for custom framing and were very patient in helping me create the perfect gift.,UNK
4269,"I expected something unique.  What I found was Ikea's older twin sister, just more expensive.",UNK
4270,One of the BEST croissant in Montreal . Everything is good and fresh . Really worth to try and the detour .,UNK
4271,Nice place. Good pub food. Great beer and cider selection. The staff has been personable and professionable in my three visits. Needs live music. Where's the live music?,UNK
4272,"pricey, pricey pricey and it isnt that good!",UNK
4273,"Not the best, but good enough when you're craving some filipino food and dont want to go too far.",UNK
4274,Any deli shop in AZ that has capicola ham deserves some stars.  They have a good selection of sandwiches and chips.  Just shows how much Subway is losing it brand when these spots are popping up and you come in and leave very refreshed that there are better options,UNK
4275,"Nice, clean rooms. GREAT price, Bowling alley, theater, lots of places to eat. I enjoyed my stay.",UNK
4276,"This place is on most peoples favorite restaurant list.  If you can afford dinner great; however, the large half orders on the lunch menu are a good bargain.",UNK
4277,2.50 transaction ATM fee. Come on. FCUs are supposed to stick together. Oh wait. This is vegas.,UNK
4278,Disinterested children work here 'supervised' by a woman in her 40's who is absolutely useless.,UNK

4282,Health department just issued 40 demerits during a routine inspection.,UNK
4283,Recently stayed at the JW Marriott during a business trip. Overall the hotel is very nice. The rooms are very large and comfortable. The staff was also very friendly. The only negative was the internet which was very slow. A solid 4 stars.,UNK
4284,"A party of five, we were seated quickly but waited nearly 30 minutes before we decided to walkout. No acknowledgment at all by no one. Very poor customer service and will not return there at all... There are lot of restaurants that are willing to take me monies.",UNK
4285,"Well I new better to come in on a Sunday 45 minutes to be seated, 20 more then we were told, another 45 to get our food plus they never brought the whole meal and no one asked how we were doing. Bottom line it was not worth 2 hours of my life",UNK
4286,The girl started making my pizza before even asking me what I wanted & what kind of dough I wanted. Every table was dirty. The same girl walked passed me while I was cleaning our table & didn't even help. I'll never come back here again.,UNK
4287,"Clean hotel, friendly staff, good and fast customer service, decent club (LAX), buffet and in room dinning could be improved.",UNK

4289,Aloha Yogurt is pretty awesome. I have only been here just a few times but I really love the place. They have awesome outdoor seating and really fresh toppings. They also have non-dairy yogurt! I would recommend.,UNK
4290,Disappointed!! They  forgot I ordered coffee then didn't refill then food was cold.  The two stars is they took my meal off the bill.  Will not return.,UNK
4291,Food is very tasty. I had the green lemon plate and it taste amazing. The service however it's poor and the cashier is an ass. It was my first time eating here and she make it quite hard. I didn't tip her!!,UNK
4292,I thought this place had a lot to offer. I didn't think the options from the cola bar was all that good though. I thought would be amazing creations but there were only sodas. The merchandise was a huge variety and the green screen with the polar bear was nice.,UNK
4293,The locker rooms are filthy the equipment. Is falling Apart and the weights are dirty.    The front desk staff are not friendly.    Been going to other gyms and I will drive the extra mile for cleanliness and friendly staff,UNK
4294,"The server was terrible here.  She got the orders all wrong, try to save us money by including my meal with someone elses when that person clearly wanted all four of the things in the deal he was getting. Clean location, but bad service.",UNK
4295,Food was tasteless and service was slow. We got the calamari and the Caesar salad. Definitely one of the worst salads- Outback is better. Best thing was the free bread and the view. Spend your money elsewhere,UNK
4296,Decent burger but outrageously overhyped. Horrible wait around lunch time and definitely too expensive for what it was. I'd recommend a lot of other burgers before I'd ever recommend this place,UNK
4297,"Total Business Solutions has really helped me get my company organized. They handle my payroll, monthly sales tax, P&L's and year end taxes. The staff is very attentive and helpful in answering my emails and phone calls. My meetings with Jason are always productive and useful.",UNK

4299,"Dr. Wells - Awesome, thoughtful and through.  Great for aging cats.  The female Dr. however leaves quite a bit to be desired in her level of care/attention and is ALWAYS in a huge rush.",UNK
4300,"A solid place for a casual bite with a twinge of hipness. Several cuts of steak, bunch of different toppings for burgers, fries, baked potatoes and a few beers and wines. No complaints here! But its nothing to go on about.",UNK
4301,Lost its Pizazz. Long lines not worth the wait. Save yr time. Go somewhere else. Food overcooked in the warmers.,UNK
4302,Made an appointment at 5:30 and literally waited 40 mins in room till the vet came in. He didn't come in till 6:10. What is the point of making an appointment if you don't even see anyone at the time you made?,UNK
4303,"Fast and friendly service. The Dim Sum are very tasty. May favorite was the Fried Meatball, i was caught by surprised that the outside of it was made with mochi mmmmm! The Thai tea was also delicious.",UNK

4305,They are now out of business.,UNK
4306,They seem to have sacrificed customer service completely. You have to check in at a kiosk pay $25.00 for the baggage fee . There CSR always seem to be rude. I believe they are missing out by not having great customer service. They are at best below average.,UNK
4307,"Black bean burger is really good, average ambience and finally the bad part fries are oily smelling",UNK
4308,The food is very good!  I suggest you take it to go. I had to ask for tea and boxes for the food. The server hung out behind the register texting. Really? Do you expect to be tipped?!?  Definitely take out!,UNK
4309,Good distribution of meat and cheese,UNK
4310,"Everyone is relatively friendly and they are excellent at nail art. The only downfall is the the quality of their pedicures. I have had three here, and left disappointed after each. Overall it's cleanly and gorgeous inside!",UNK
4311,"Do not use printing services. I had to explain what I wanted 3 separate times and the staff confirmed that they understand and have all the information needed each time. they still messed it up anyway! despite their mistake, the staff was still rude and ignorant. they seriously need some customer service training!",UNK
4312,Reserved a non-smoking room and they could not accommodate when I checked in. I will never come back.,UNK
4313,"Coco Rico hits the spot. Make sure you order everything with spices on top! The chicken is tender and the potatoes are really flavourful. The service could be better, but what do you expect for such a bustling joint?",UNK
4314,"Verizon sucks, despite all the good things I've heard about them. One example: auto-pay randomly won't work and you'll be charged a late payment fee that they won't reverse. That's one problem I never had in 10 years at AT&T!",UNK
4315,"Wonderful staff, fun, clean rooms, nice workout room. Terrific food at ZUZU. Very cool.",UNK
4316,"Actually I've been here 3 times already, and each time I've gone I've never been dissatisfied with the selection of the food items. Not much of a selection, but just all the favorites. Served fast and healthy portioned. Great eats for less.",UNK
4317,"Sub par food. Waiting time is terrible, didn't get drinks for 30 min and food for like 1 1/2 hours. Just cause there's a party going on doesn't mean you ignore your other customers",UNK
4318,I had an item taken from our room.  When we expressed our concern we never even received a phone call back.,UNK
4319,"Horrible service, horrible attitudes. I created a yelp account to write this review. Absolutely rude and incredibly expensive.",UNK
4320,NOt a fan. Very strange place with mediochre food. The marsala sauce was thick and cold. The staff was not very friendly and the service was sub par. I will not be returning.,UNK
4321,From games to food I agree with all the four and five stars Bill's is getting. I never stayed in the hotel part some people type its small and still giving it four stars it must be good.,UNK
4322,"Learned about this place from AZ Republic a few weeks ago. Finally went there to try the Chocolate Croissants and Almond Croissants with my wife. Fabulous, flaky and flavorful! Definitely will go back and try some breakfast and lunch there.",UNK
4323,"Limited hours, a bit dated, and no showers, but they have Campari. Mmm... Campari.  I suppose there are worse places to wait for your flight.",UNK
4324,"This place is awesome, they did a wonderful job cleaning my teethes and gives goood advices on how to take care of your teethes. I recommend going here to clean your teethes! Also, it is free to bleach your teeth too!",UNK
4325,"This company is a scam.  I purchased 5 shirts...went for the fitting, paid the taxes, and 5 months later, still nothing after dozens of calls and emails.  The store front is gone.  STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY!!",UNK
4326,Maybe the college crowd likes sub standard food because of the lack luster drinks but for $25 this lunch was comparable to the quality of Taco Bell! Not impressed at all :(,UNK
4327,Had my first experience with a friend who has been going here for years....   The bartenders and servers were extremely friendly... the food was good quality... Overall was a pleasant experience... I would definitely go back!,UNK
4328,"Pros: good music, lighting, and general atmosphere\nCons: overpriced drinks, straight bartenders/go go dancers (with their girlfriends standing right next to them) not convenient location, couldnt get a cab back for 15 mins",UNK
4329,"Slow service when they weren't even half full, burned mac and cheese served without blinking an eye, and pretty much mediocre food all around.  If you're headed here, sit at the bar, and chat with the bartender, and service is a hell of a lot better.",UNK
4330,"My bf and I LOVE this place! When we want pizza, this is our go to. We can eat an XL between the 2 of us... of course I have like 2 slices and he eats the rest. SO good!",UNK
4331,Nice icecreams with a huge amount of alternatives. Nice place to grab an icecream when in the mall. Had the donought - one. Overall good place,UNK
4332,"Pizza is average - they use the \""sweet\"" sauce which I do not care for. Pomo is better. Service was very slow and not very nice.",UNK
4333,"I found this sushi to be painfully mediocre.\n\nStandard menu with average roll options... quality was poor, in that my boyfriend ended up on the pot for an entire evening immediatly after consuming Uni at this establishment....",UNK
4334,"Small inside and hard to get a seat sometimes, but good sushi. Try the Candy Cane.",UNK
4335,Not bad! The chicken brochette seemed to have a Dijon-honey mustard glaze which I found delicious!! The portions are large with each plate being filled with salad and large potato wedges. I'd go again,UNK
4336,"Very good place. In addition to top notch typical pub food, they have an excellent selection of gluten free options, both for food and drink. This sets jacs apart from other similar places. Worth a return visit.",UNK
4337,I got the worst food poisoning I have ever had in my life from this place. It has been three days and I'm still having trouble eating and digesting food. I do not recommend eating here,UNK
4338,For Arizona it was ok.  The menu was a little heavy on the fried rolls.  Waiter was very friendly.  The soy sauce dishes were the size of soup bowls and they gave us metal soup spoons with the miso - must be authentic Arizona sushi.,UNK
4339,Slowest place ever. I ordered 25 minutes ago and I am still waiting. Just 2 sandwiches. Not rocket science. Then I get both sandwiches and they are both wrong. Wish I could give less than one star.,UNK
4340,"I had a really good facial. My girl was very informative and professional. I would suggest updating the staff info on the website, as I couldn't find her so I can't give a specific name.",UNK
4341,Cheap pork shoomai!,UNK
4342,"Didn't stay at this hotel, but it was sooo cute.  Love the many food choices and wow, had the best chicken burger ever.",UNK
4343,I liked their red velvet cupcake better than the Mad Hatter one.  Still nowhere close to Sprinkles but it was fine and took care of the cupcake fix.,UNK
4344,"Went on opening day, they had tons of staff but were still slow. We ordered two hot dogs and fries and they forgot the fries. I got the chili dog, it was ok. He got the Chicago dog and liked it. Fries were good. Price is moderate.",UNK
4345,"i got the famous andys sage benedict.  it was a little on the bland side, but because the portions are so big and the presentation really makes the atmosphere fun and exciting ill be going back for more..",UNK
4346,This place is absolutely infested with cockroaches (I've seen them myself and an exterminator has confirmed infestation beyond what I could have even imagined). And the food is not very good at all. Yucky! Be on the lookout for health department citations!,UNK
4347,"Solid, cheap, delicious Italian.  Good calzones, baked spaghetti, and Alfredo (don't forget to add chicken).  Excellent for takeout as well.",UNK
4348,"Trashy.  Like a giant ghetto dollar store.  poor quality products, sketchy environment, dirty.  Not to mention the drunk elvis impersonator.  This is not a \""swap meet\"" and I'm sorry I wasted my time!",UNK
4349,The food was good but not spectacular. The atmosphere and service was great. I love the bocce ball court is great. Fun to play while enjoying a cervesa. I'm very willing to give this place a 2nd chance.,UNK
4350,"The room is huge, the inside is pretty and the people\nBad internet and AC\n\nNot super centrally located on the strip either so getting to the other casinos can be a bit of a pain...but i guess that's their goal ;)",UNK
4351,Brunch drinks and ambiance (Vinyl Station) were fabulous! Food was ok. They definitely do not know how to make fried chicken. They need to visit Willie Mayes in NOLA or The Tuck Shop locally to understand fried chicken needs to have actual flavor.,UNK
4352,"The sushi and food isn't all that, but the cocktails and waitresses are!\n\nRecommendations: Kiwi Collins",UNK
4353,"Decent and fun party zone before Dbax games, it can be packed on weekends. Babes look great, service is ok, and food is mediocre, but none of that really matters. Come for the babes before the game.",UNK
4354,"If you like tasteless but expensive food, be my guest.",UNK
4355,Out Of Business.  What took so long?,UNK
4356,"This place has huge portions and great good. Also, the atmosphere is really quaint (read small) and therefore reservation are a must.\n\nLiverpool House (same chef and owner) is also worth trying out!",UNK
4357,McDonalds food served by English language challenged people. Enough said.,UNK
4358,"First, You need to wait 20 minutes to get seats, then the nightmare just begins.  We waited for 1 hour to get our food. Besides, the food is not worth the wait time.",UNK
4359,Always a big queue...\nSlightly higher than normal...\nFast student lunches.,UNK
4360,"This place is so freaking slow.  I have been sitting at the window so long that I was able to download this app and write a bad review.  I'm rounding 10 minutes. This is slow food,  not fast food.",UNK
4361,I don't know why people like this place. There wasn't anything wrong with the service but the food was awful. Very weird... Especially the salsa and sauces.,UNK
4362,"Terrible customer service, they told me my order would be ready on Friday and I never heard anything until the next Tuesday. Can't trust them.",UNK
4363,yelp suggested it and it's out of business!! there was a note on the door saying the landlord was taking back the property.,UNK
4364,"The concept is interesting, its like subway but with Sushi. I think I will go back again. You can call your order in also which is great when your on your lunch break",UNK
4365,Very bad Panda. Don't come here after 8 or the meat and broccoli will seem rotten. Always extra greasy and unsavory. Drive down to 59th if you must have it.,UNK
4366,"The donuts are hit and miss, but when they're a hit, they are oh-so-good.  The coffee is tasty and a great deal.  The service is fine; nothing has ever really stood out as especially good or bad.",UNK
4367,Only bar downtown Madison I can think of that has air hockey.  For that it gets a star.,UNK
4368,"No different than a normal CPK.  Grabbed a later night pie and ate it in the room.  Went BBQ Chicken, their specialty.  Good as always.\n\nGood service and food came out fast.  Another bonus for the Mirage.",UNK
4369,I just got an email from a fellow yelper who ate a Sau Paulo and had the CFS.  The chef is still an idiot.,UNK
4370,"Food is good, but enjoy the cooking at the original spot better.",UNK
4371,"A good breakfast at a very nice price. The eggs, bacon and sausage were good. The hobo breakfast suffers from bland gravy and lackluster home fries. Another negative is the artificial butter spread provided at table. The coffee was very good though.",UNK
4372,"Beautiful, hip ambience - disappointing dishes. I wished I liked it because I liked the atmosphere and the music. Great city feel, bad menu.",UNK
4373,"Interesting food. If you don't make a reservation, you won't get served",UNK
4374,Went here for 1-year anniversary. Over-priced food where 50 and 60 year old townies and professors eat.\n\nYou've been warned.,UNK
4375,No Longer in Business - Now a Mexican Joint....haven't tried it yet...,UNK
4376,White tuna sushi was great! But the Pad Thai just ok.  Next time i'll stick to the sushi,UNK
4377,Good pho portion size reasonable\nThere is no basil\n NOT authentic,UNK
4378,"Gorgeous place to stop by and have a few drinks before heading out for the night. It can be a bit quiet, but the service is great.",UNK
4379,"Warning! Don't rent a bike there , they make you own the first $2000 if anything happens to the bike your fault or not, not worth the risk their crooks.",UNK
4380,"We walked right into the cafe because there was no line, but waited for almost an hour for our dinner. We were falling asleep at the table. Food was OK, but service sucks. Expect the long wait on the food.",UNK
4381,"Manager needs a personality, otherwise food is overpriced crap. This place was good once, not so much anymore. I wish these chains would get it together and stop wondering why business is so slow.",UNK
4382,"If I could give this place 0 stars I would. Food was not as described in the menu, one $30 plate was room temperature and all of the meat was fat. Also I had to get up and get my water refilled at the bar.",UNK
4383,"Breakfast was good, the eggs were a little hard cooked for my liking, explained to waitress and was fixed. Mimosa was weak, not worth the price!",UNK
4384,"Eggs Benedict:  meh - kinda dry biscuit, potatoes were tasteless and strangely uniformely sized cubes\nLatte:  good\n\nNice space and service was good.  Maybe come back, maybe not.",UNK
4385,Very friendly staff but not the best selection of gear and the price aren't the best. There are  better stores.,UNK
4386,Do NOT recommend.  Horrible Customer Service.  Owner (Kenny) swears at customers.  Plenty of other mechanics in town that treat customers with respect.,UNK
4387,"Great location, super cool conversion of an old gas station. My only gripe would be that barista didnt rinse portafilter before pulling my espresso shots , thus my cappuccino tasted burnt. This is however a common problem at most indy coffee places.",UNK
4388,Checked the credit card statement... they added a fraudulent $5 tip to the bill.,UNK
4389,A fun coffee shop within walking distance of my house works great for me. Definitely not the best in the neighborhood but it has a very unique and fun style and I've never had to wait in line.,UNK
4390,"At best this place is average.  Not bad but not worth trying either, many other places are better in the area.",UNK
4391,If you like paraside bakery Do not come here!! Soup isnt good . Salad is so gross! Chicken looks like its plastic rubber!! Customer service isnt bad but i would never ever reccomend this!!!!!!!!!,UNK
4392,"I'm never shopping here, I don't wanna shop somewhere where associates think if u can afford it in just goona purchase the bag online then looked at if I could afford it",UNK
4393,This place is **CLOSED**.,UNK
4394,Worst. They are rude and awful people. The owner is a giant douche and seems to hate the world as a result.,UNK
4395,"Meh, No prime rib, no olive selection, and no fruit selection except for fruits in a cup.  I've had better food selection elsewhere.",UNK
4396,I just paid $15 for a double cheeseburger /fries/regular drink. I am kicking myself. There is a FIVE GUYS across the street and I wish I went there.  First and LAST time I will ever eat here.,UNK
4397,"I was really unimpressed. My boyfriend and I went in wanting pad thai like we are used to finding at other restaurants. What we got was expensive, not anything special, and a small portion size.",UNK
4398,Horrible experience.  I will never shop here ever again.,UNK
4399,"Good drinks, kinda blah atmosphere.",UNK
4400,Honestly bummed. Read the great reviews and ordered delivery. But it's been over two hours and it's not here. When I called they never answered. Looks like I don't get to try the delicious pizza. :(,UNK
4401,YUCK!!!! Go elsewhere for your chicken!,UNK
4402,Good for Altar bar. But they didn't have fries....,UNK
4403,I give them a 5 for service and attentiveness but the food was just ok. My grandma didn't like the meat loaf and my grandma didn't like her salad. My turkey sandwich was OK but dry. Not a big fan. Great service tho,UNK
4404,"My experience here was terrible with Becky... That's the only problem with the place.\n\nHowever, Dr. Sotelo, Dr. Cannon, and Dr. Resnick are absolutely amazing.",UNK
4405,Tasteless and  expensive. $12 fruit plate tastes like plastic. And took 30min to prepare an omelette...,UNK
4406,We finally just left. Never got service after watching our waitress gab to her friends for 15 minutes. Nice.,UNK
4407,"For the most part, the atmosphere, food, service and location are up to snuff. I always enjoy the Picnic Salad but the grilled cheese sandwich was a major disappointment.",UNK
4408,"I just threw up a little hearing the name \""jack in the box\"".  Hope you are ready for some food poisoning.",UNK
4409,"A bit pricey in my opinion. Everything is self serve. The bulgogi and the chicken were delicious, but all the sides were mediocre. Although the meat was good, I don't think I'll be returning.",UNK
4410,If you want good Mexican food do not go here. It's the Mexican version of mcdonalds and I will never have it again.,UNK
4411,"Dirty restaurant. Last time I went, my food all smelled and tasted fishy. They do have good portion sizes.",UNK
4412,"Good service, good food, good specials",UNK
4413,"OK this place is good during the week and early on the weekends\nLate on weekends it kinda really sucks.\ntoo many, too little space.",UNK
4414,"Even the non-office \""nice\"" chairs left us with partial paralysis.  Very hard and uncomfortable.  Also, the high school kids working there could use some customer service training.",UNK
4415,"This place is fucking garbage and should be condemned. First room I got was fucking filthy, internet drops in and out and the dumb motherfucker at the front desk is NO help.",UNK
4416,"I have tried a lot of vietnamese restaurant, this one is just so so. The roll is good, but the pho, not as delicious as I expected.",UNK
4417,Was told they deliver to Nellis Suites. Too bad I'll never know because no one answered my 6 attempts to call at 5pm.,UNK
4418,This place was really a neat location.  My friend and I played pool and had a drink. The server was great and the place was nice.  I really liked it and would recommend it to anyone.,UNK
4419,Food was good but the decor was a little creepy.,UNK
4420,"We went at 4p to avoid a line, but still waited 90 mins.  The price was $45 per person.  We were under whelmed.  A good $30 buffet, but def not worth the $45.",UNK
4421,"do not go here, tou will be ripped off on drinks, the game is they will say, you did not give me 20.00, and short change you, they wait until you have a few drinks, and then start short changing you, the bartenter is a skink!!!",UNK
4422,"THIS LOCATION IS CLOSED. When it was in business it was hit-or-miss, more bad than good. Opened new location in Urbana.",UNK
4423,I live in the neighborhood and tried this place once...it's now closed and it's not a surprise.  Can anyone open a good restaurant that's not a chain in our area?,UNK
4424,"I have to say, i am really not impressed with this place.  Service was spotty, the food was sub par.",UNK
4425,"Terrible management rude, mostly yard sale merchandise very little in the way of real antiques.",UNK
4426,Great service and tastes good.. But boyfriend and I got food poisoning after we got home...so not eating here again.,UNK
4427,"If only it was possible to give 0 stars. The worst company I have EVER dealt with. They are rude, poorly run, and they are the people that give insurance companies a bad name. I hope that this company goes out of business. THE WORST.",UNK
4428,Went here with friends and have been to other locations. This location was different than the rest though.the food came out overlooked to the point of tasting burned. Was not impressed.,UNK
4429,"Use the automated postal center, and skip the long line.",UNK
4430,"the place smell so bad with smokers,we have to leave right away.",UNK
4431,@holverson: SCREW YOU Valvoline Instant Oil Change! I schedule a 3 hr appt. & you close without canceling. Make me drive 1 hr w/kids. You suck!! #FAIL,UNK
4432,We order number one and three. The tonkotsu ramen and shoyutonkotsu ramen. Those are pretty good. I would not recommend the gyoza. Taste like my cooking skill. Gyoza is not crispy and very oily.,UNK
4433,"Kona Grill was okay for me, the variety of sushi rolls was not to my liking. I did however enjoy my husband's salmon thai (sweet chilli glaze) salad and the Korean bulgogi taco. Probably won't return unless for cocktails.",UNK
4434,"This bar is fine as a meeting place before hitting the town or for a nightcap. This is not a main event by any means, but service was fine and the drinks weren't too weak.",UNK
4435,Fairway bar and grill except there is no grill just cold cut sandwiches and $8.19 draft beer. But the beer was my fault because the price isn't on the menu and I didn't ask.,UNK
4436,Pricey. Its a fancy atmosphere with not-so-great food and service. I expected more for my money.,UNK
4437,"The people were semi-ok customer service. Not impressing, but I don't care as much about that. Short and to the point is find with me. \nI do care about food quality, and this one was not the best.",UNK
4438,"The mall itself is ok, but appears to be going down hill slightly. The recession has definitely taken its toll on the small business owners here. Multiple stores have closed and there don't seem to be any \""Coming Soon\"" signs to announce a replacement. Still its better than Metro Center Mall.",UNK
4439,You're better off at Dave and Busters. The games are super old and the place smells like kids sitting around in their own crap. Gross.,UNK
4440,They only deliver through WheelDeliver.com,UNK
4441,"The new owners screwed this place up.  It used to be affordable, but not any longer.  No sales.  No coupons.  No flyers.  They might as well board the place up and call it quits.   Expired food remains on the shelf.  I wish it was not so.",UNK
4442,Real good service and great food. My pasta tasted different then the others I was with but everything else was good.,UNK
4443,"Decent hotel, but worst check out experience in a long time. Prime time and you only have two people at the desk. Seems a little absurd. In room check out not working = fail.",UNK
4444,"Over priced and the food is blah, the only thing that I found good on the menu was the choco taco, and those can be picked up for a couple of bucks at any convenience store.",UNK
4445,"Bland-- lacking spice, garlic, ginger...you know, the ingredients that make you crave Chinese food.  This is typical Valley Chinese.  I wouldn't bother coming here on my own time/dollar.  Can't speak to the Hawaiian dishes.",UNK
4446,"Eh considering I spent $10 per salad, it was a ripoff that they forgot the ham :( this is not a good place to go to if you don't have much time until your flight",UNK
4447,The Italian combo is awesome!,UNK
4448,"They served left over pasta. Yes it came out of portioned zip locked bags. Sauce was absolutely not fresh, nothing was! With the amount of great restaurants in montreal that serve fresh food, it hurst to pay for less than passable food. Stay away!!",UNK
4449,Pretty ghetto. Pretty empty at 2:30am on a Friday night. Pretty sick that girls were barfing in the sinks. Pretty much not going back.,UNK
4450,Staff is not knowledgable and unapologetic. Please use better training procedures as I waited 20 minutes for them to figure out a printer situation (and even tried to help with mo knowledge of the product) and they were still unable to assist me. Thank you.,UNK
4451,Like,UNK
4452,Better think twice or three times about spending you money in this Bar not friendly or nice I guess your making them do their job and they sure make u feel that way.,UNK
4453,I know this place just opened so usually I can excuse the fact that the employees bad service is chalked up to inexperience and getting use to the place. However it doesn't excuse the disgusting long hair I found in my food. Go somewhere else.,UNK
4454,It's one thing to charge a $12 minimum for a ride less than a half a mile away. It's another thing to inform someone of this after you've arrived at the destination. On top of that this guy didn't even have any change. What a scheister!,UNK
4455,Worst Steak Tacos...EVER. \n\nTasted like marinated cardboard served in newspaper. Really and I don't normally give restaurants bad reviews.,UNK
4456,3 stars because the food is pretty delicious. Cons: I felt like the lady in the front was really rude. She was not friendly at all. Another con was that it is pretty pricey and that they charge for to go boxes.,UNK
4457,Do not stay in the west wing the tower is what your're looking for! The west wing is outdated and crummy!,UNK
4458,"The food is okay but nothing special, seemed to be really slow for business and almost boring.",UNK
4459,absolutely nothing special.  Overpriced basic sushi.  Don't believe the hype.  There are plenty of other ways to lose money in vegas...,UNK
4460,Totally overcharged and the owner is a perve. Next year it's Turbo Tax for me baby!,UNK
4461,"Solid sandwich, great price.  I would probably come back to try more of the menu.  The microbrews were great!",UNK
4462,Bad service! The malted waffle for $5.00 looked and tasted like a toaster waffle. We went here because the rating was good but.........,UNK
4463,Service was really bad.  Completely under staffed. Out of pulled pork. What type of BBQ joint sells out of pulled pork?  And the food we did have was cold. Won't be going back.,UNK
4464,The dumbasses sold me the wrong size intake hose because they didn't have the right size in stock. I bought a fancy hydraulic jack there and while it was great for awhile the thing broke shortly afterwards.,UNK
4465,It was ok to me - the bagel was a little tough & didn't really care for their coffee.,UNK
4466,"The service at Mr. Roberts is okay, but the free live music is what pulls me in! Drinks are reasonably priced too.",UNK
4467,Crowded they didn't honor my gold level for my Starbucks card,UNK
4468,"good store,good selection,bad customer services and be very careful what beer you buy check the date you have a chance to buy beer expired from last year",UNK
4469,"The food was okay but they did not put enough in the plate for the price. I have been to many other restaurants and if they did not give you enough meat, they at least gave you a lot of rice. It was kind of a disappointment.",UNK
4470,This place is kinda gross.  The guys I came with just wanted to come here for the 99 cent foot long hot dog....so luckily we didn't have to stay long.  :P,UNK
4471,"Dennys, whats has happened to you? This visit  turned out to be like other visits to Dennys locations in California. Long waits for food that is warm at best.",UNK
4472,"Customer service is a hit or miss here, but most of my experiences have been bad. I came here once and the employee didn't wash their hands before making my sandwich. Ew.",UNK
4473,"Friendly staff, but stars down for quality of the food. The first time I ordered the Western with sweet potato fries, the fries were soggy. The second time I ordered the Western with sweet potato fries, the fries were cold. Never again Carl's Jr., never again.",UNK
4474,"I go to this facility usually 3 nights per week at about 2am and love it. Its jot crowded at all, usually having about 3-5 people in it. I can have the basketball court to myself I wanted and move freely through workout stations.",UNK
4475,Store hours are wrong. Opened after 11am. They were not prepared and when we walked in the young lady uses rags to clean the floor the placed them on the front counter. So not going back to this place.,UNK
4476,I just couldnt have any worse time while i was there. I was given the wrong change and then they argued to me about it for an hour and then I found the bread to be old and kinda flaky.,UNK
4477,Their pizza is really going downhill.  I used really like their pizza but the last one was flavor lacking and really chewy!,UNK
4478,Confirm the other posts. Don't waste your time at this rude place. Show up at their ppen time and doors wide open but tell you they are closed and not even an invite to come back. Good to not need the business I guess.,UNK
4479,"Wanted to try this place since it had the shortest wait time... well now I know why.. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing, but the black pepper chicken didn't have much flavor at all.. I was very disappointed and will not be coming back.",UNK
4480,"Came here for the red velvet pancakes. My niece found a long strand of hair in her omelet, nasty. Came once before it was ok, this time it was sub-par. Never again.",UNK
4481,Food is great.. had the harbor lobster bake everything was amazing.   Those biscuits you get are even better. Lol\nManager was kind of a ass hole last time we went (we just asked for a both instead),UNK
4482,"Solid sandwichs made quickly in a nice environment. A good place to go for a quick, solid sandwich.",UNK
4483,"Quick and easy but I wouldn't say it was \""good\"". More like to late to cook dinner, super hungry, deal with the quality, place.",UNK
4484,I witnessed this company / Owners treat parents horrible at the Trunk R treat in Queen creek..they were using profanity ..I would never recommend them. The owners were even really mean and inappropriate.,UNK
4485,I had a pleasant lunch here. It was the first time I've ever had pad thai. It was good. I will be going again very convenient location. Staff was really friendly and helpful.,UNK
4486,This place is not very good. I quit eating here after the second time I found hair in my food,UNK
4487,"The caprese panini is delicious and I would order that again.   The pizza though, which is the main thing here - meh.  Overpriced, stingy with the toppings and a crust that is nothing special (actually, too thin).",UNK
4488,"Other then the high prices, I was on the phone for almost an hour to add ONE package! I beg of you to hire employees with some type CUSTOMER SERVICE BACKGROUND!",UNK
4489,"I wanted to grab a quick bite before flying back to LA.  Service here could hardly be described as quick here, nor could it be described as accurate.  I never did get my drink order that day; not even a glass of water.",UNK
4490,ProTech is a horrible company.  Their customer service is the worst I've run into in a long time. They decided today that yelling at me and then transferring me to a tech is acceptable behavior for a business to have.  I would not recommend them to anyone.,UNK
4491,Food was OK.   Bread and oil combination was too salty somehow.  Service needs some attention.  I was beginning to think that our waitress was put into a witness protection program after the main course was served.  We had mediocre service a year ago and wanted to give them another try.,UNK
4492,Say they open at 8am...sitting here at 10 after and locked/shuttered. Can't open on time?,UNK
4493,Saw show last night and left early as it was horrible. She lip singing the entire time and her dancing was horrible. Boo!,UNK

4495,"If you crave a hotdog this should be the place to go to if your in the neighbourhood, serving Nathan's hotdogs you can't go wrong.  The workers were also very friendly, i have not tried anything else but the hot dogs.",UNK
4496,My bed was crunchy. \n\nLast time I slept in a crunchy bed was in Rosarito on Spring Break. I also wore flip flops in the shower.\n\nEnough said.,UNK
4497,disgusting food rude workers. signs everywhere to not take more food than you can eat/not to wase food to prevent rise in cost....if food was edible i would eat it.  $28 for me n hubby wasted.,UNK
4498,A Taco Bell is a Taco Bell is a Taco Bell. Or is it?  This location is a favorite. It's close by. They are consistent. They are quick. I love me anything volcano. I wish they had the pizza hut with it.,UNK
4499,If you  want the slowest service when 2 people Are making drinks  then for Shure come here.... This is why old people shouldn't work at Starbucks,UNK
4500,"here's a tip - they don't stock their shelves, so what's on display they might not have, and they often have discontinued items on display. lame.",UNK
4501,"Food was about average, the service was good, but the portions were tiny. Only got 6 shrimp for 10 bucks, had to eat something else I was still hungry. Definitely wouldn't recommend.",UNK
4502,Worst ever sushi place in Las Vegas and I been to a lot of them. Will never come back to this place ever. Food and service sucks b....ls.,UNK
4503,"The exposed wall and industrial-like atmosphere is nice. \n\nThe coffee is good. \n\nThe best thing about this place is the staff. Unlike the majority of independent coffee shops, they are extremely friendly and helpful.\n\nI'm definitely a fan.",UNK
4504,"So. The food was worth more than two stars but man was the service horrible. We waited an hour and fifteen minutes for our food. It wasn't the servers fault, she was trying. The kitchen just responded that it's busy. Not coming back anyone soon",UNK
4505,This place could definitely use an interior upgrade. Went on a weekday and parking and seating not so busy/packed. The experience is fun which is why I gave it a 3. Food is so-so but nothing special.,UNK
4506,"Cheap,abundant food of so-so quality. Ambience is very poor. It is dirty and messy. And there is in no real service.  But dirty cheap if that is what you are looking for in a restaurant.",UNK
4507,"Your average overpriced airport food lounge and bar. Had time to kill between connections..and needed breakfast..the waiter was pretty slow, seemed like he was overeworked with the...6 or so people in the bar...",UNK
4508,"DO NOT go here. Have been going here for 3 years and quality has gone way done. Now, my diamond ring has been \""lost\"" under some questionable circumstances, and they are refusing to help me or look or do anything. Don't let this happen to you.",UNK
4509,"Very cool place to browse and pick up stuff for my second favorite room in the house! Make sure you check out the clearance wall, they also have something cool over there. Super helpful here in anything you are looking for and also they have some good cookbooks on hand also.",UNK
4510,"One of the lady was extremely rude and was unable to identify  a 2003 silver proof quarter repeatedly saying it wasn't silver and dropping it on a glass counter. Then they proceeded to offer me 50% of spot value on 90% silver. Bad service, bad offers, bad business. Stay away!",UNK
4511,"It's nice that they're in my neighborhood, but their pho is just so blah. I need flavor with my soup and noodles damn it. The rice they use is like bird seed too - I couldn't eat finish my meal.",UNK
4512,"$15 for guacamole.\n\nThat's almost all I need to say. \n\nYep, I think that's all I'm going to say.",UNK
4513,"I went there for brunch on Saturday with my dad and sister. Paid $33 for each of us. Food was okay, nothing to complain or brag about but did not feel especial. Environment and service  were nice though. Took off 1 star for price.",UNK
4514,Good pizza. Good prices. But there are so many flies in the restaurant it's almost unbearable. Next time I will take it to go for sure.  Would be 4 stars if not for the gross pest problem.,UNK
4515,I upgraded to the Ultimate Car Wash because of a special.  It was not worth it.  My dash is too oily looking when the finish is matte.  My floor mats were washed and yet I had to pick off debris.  Leather conditioner was left soaking on my seat.,UNK
4516,we had a great server but we came with a whole soccer team and apparently the other server helping them can't do her job and the manager didn't seem too concerned with the poor service.,UNK
4517,"24 hour open cafe with a good variety of breakfast items, salads and meals..came here for early, I think 1:00 am for breakfast...good pancakes, eggs and toast...good service and fast",UNK
4518,"OK sushi. Tried it several times. When I'm shopping at Home Depot, Target or Pet Smart. I get a thing for sushi and cold Japanese beer. Conveniently located in the same parking lot of Home Depot. Every time, disappointed.",UNK
4519,Awesome shark tank! Great wait staff! My whole family had a great time. I had the turkey platter which tasted good. Then I spent the next  24 hours with food poisoning.,UNK
4520,It's getting old. The room smelled oldy. The Parking structure is dirty. The buffet is great.\nThe Mresort is the best!,UNK
4521,"Switched out my phone which was nice, but I think they gave me a \""refurbished\"" one...",UNK
4522,"The New York Sirloin was cooked well, but it was pretty tough. The online menu said they had prime rib, which is why we came, but they don't even sell it. Our server Bryan was very good",UNK
4523,"The food was good -- not great. Service and management was really poor: amateurs with wrong antagonistic attitude towards their clients. Typical provincial attitude of somebody that thinks/acts as a big fish in a very small pond. No finesse, no style, but OK heavy food.",UNK
4524,This place is ok.  Think of it like a Carrabas for Mexican food.  Nothing great... nothing authentic... nothing offensive.  Middle of the road Mexican fare at a reasonable price.  It is acceptable.,UNK
4525,Okay coffee. But I think people only go here to see girls in lingerie make coffee! Haha but if that's what people like!,UNK
4526,"I visited this place for photo facial because I bought a Groupon. It's very hard to get in, you need to book at least 90 days ahead of time.",UNK
4527,it's closed!  i'm bummed out.  best deli i found in the area.\nit's closed.  it's closed.  it's closed. it's closed,UNK
4528,"L-A-Z-Y!!!! I was ready to spend a good $50-$60 and they said I'm out of their delivery range. Looking at my gps, they're 4.4 miles away.",UNK
4529,Closed and no one knew  or cared..,UNK
4530,"Nice little hole in the wall location for a quick Gyro Sandwich. \n\nI ordered the typical Gyro and Fries. I it was very good. Could have used a little more sauce, but other than that it was a nice little quick lunch.",UNK
4531,"It's been awhile since I've been here and I was really looking forward to the create a pasta since it's been awhile.  Apparently they don't have it anymore.  The quality wasn't what I expected. The service was alright,  just not sure if I would return again.",UNK
4532,"Never again, I don't like food poising so I'm going to tell you to pass on this place. Calamari RUINED me for at least a couple of weeks.",UNK
4533,just ok for the price.,UNK
4534,"The food was fine. Nothing really stood out, but it wasn't bad either.\n\nThe interior is in desperate need of updating. Everything looks worn out and tired.",UNK
4535,"Poor poor service, then they finally show up and then away they go to have long conversation with some friend. Door is just OK",UNK
4536,"In love with the French atmosphere, disappointed with the food. Many dishes too salty and overrated by the staff. Hard to eat healthy here. The menu is all over the place.",UNK
4537,"Good food , good service",UNK
4538,They did a great job with the re-model. The rooms are very nice! Hopefully they stay that way!!,UNK

4540,"First time here, but never to return.  This place is Creepy! Got the runs the next day, ugh.  :(",UNK
4541,This place is horrid! They are discriminatory and I will NEVER come back!!!! They are also horribly organized! FAIL!!,UNK
4542,Great service- overpriced food :-/,UNK
4543,"Staff at this location is a bit rude and condescending. Gym is ok, no real free wights , no bench, this is not for serious body builders. As a plus there are a lot of quality cardio machines",UNK
4544,Horrible service place. Our waitress walked right past us. No word.    We watched as she asked other people what they wanted.  Really.  No silverware. No napkins.,UNK
4545,Burgers are excellent but fries are too salty.,UNK
4546,Hated it.  Expected HUGE wedding superstore with all kinds of decorations instead it's mostly wedding party clothes.  Air conditioning was working very well.  Sales rep wasn't listening to what I said I wanted and brought horrible dresses to me.,UNK
4547,Owner was rude and insulting. Won't EVER go back. $12 is way too much to spend on hamburger on a stale bun.,UNK
4548,This place has the worst customer service ever! It's amazing they are still in business. Gives Baskin Robbins a bad name.,UNK
4549,"do not come here horrible gym, staff harassment specially when your husband trying to help you out. parking horrible, gym is basically a meat market. staff rude, dirty disgusting gym.and no free wifi trainers jealous with their CLIPBOARD",UNK
4550,First visit to Burger 21. Ordered the Burger 101 and onion strings to go. The onion strings were so heavily coated with salt I could not even eat them. The burger was very salty as well and did not finish it. Very disappointed and will not return.,UNK
4551,"Please don't waste your time or money!  Absolutely horrible, it taste as bad as the building looks! HORRIBLE SERVICE TOO!",UNK
4552,I thought this is too conservative and expensive. Recommended for rich people.,UNK
4553,I get my drugs here.,UNK
4554,"Love coming to hooters,metro location is my favorite place to be the beers are ice cold and all the girls are gorgeous!:)",UNK
4555,"Zero knowledge about insurance billing and general office procedures. Office manager argues and has a bad attitude. I would not recommend this place, nor will I ever schedule another appointment. Go to Lenscrafters if you have Tricare/United Healthcare.",UNK
4556,"The happy hour bar menu and drinks were very nice. The bartender made the \""rita\"" for me on the tart side which is what I wanted. The shredded pork was fantastic. Very nice atmosphere. The servers seemed friendly and efficient.",UNK
4557,"Hash hash a go go is named accurately because you will have to go go if you know what I mean before you leave.  Service was slow, the food came out for our table at three different times. While the food portions were large the food tasted bland and was barely warm.",UNK
4558,The pool is nice the lazy river is fun and a great place to cool off. Bring you own drinks because the waitresses are only interested in helping the cabanas.,UNK
4559,The food is decent with a big variety of seafood dishes. But at 40$ a person I just didn't think it was worth it. I'd rather spend that much on 1 freshly cooked seafood dinner then all I can eat buffet dishes.,UNK
4560,The employees are friendly and seem knowledgable but 2 hours to get a flat fixed is unacceptable. I will be taking my business elsewhere from now on.,UNK
4561,no press shirts came back with wrinkles! how do you do that? these are work shirts that you don't even have to press....these guys sent them back to me with wrinkles in them....run away....,UNK
4562,I've tried 3 separate times to eat here and it's always closed. Is this place out of business?,UNK
4563,Only nice to have a drink before going out but it's a shame to wait 30mn to get in there and pay a cover... just to see a bunch on bacholerette girls getting shot on stage. You do it only once...,UNK
4564,i was very disappointed..been to many of their locations like the ever soo good NYC location.  gotta say save your money and go elsewhere cuz this location bites,UNK
4565,"Food tasted very cheap. Couldn't eat it, went to subway instead. I recommend cleaning the walls.",UNK
4566,"Went in a few nights ago and had a dreadful meal.  Service was incredibly slow, calamari was tough and chewy, and the lasagna had the consistency of mush.  Too bad, I have eaten here 5 times with solid results.  Maybe it was an off night.",UNK
4567,One lady was great.  My friend was going to just ask for a pen and all the lady did was cut us off and day she couldn't help.  I agree with everyone.   Worse service.  Even worse them the California dmv.,UNK
4568,Slow and rude service at a dirty restaurant.,UNK
4569,Really average food in buffet for lunch. It was a good selection but food was a little less than I would expect.,UNK
4570,Hit or Miss. They are short handed every night so delivery can be hella slow. The place also closes very early. Before 11.,UNK
4571,The place is pretty nice so that's not my beef. The service sucks sucks sucks. Over priced for the wrong service and they will not refund anything. Go elsewhere.,UNK
4572,"Get the original, deluxe on dark rye. OMG!!!",UNK
4573,"Food and beer were excellent tonight. Filet, mashed potatoes, spinach, pilsner all marvelous.  Service was pretty slow though and waiter disappeared for 20+ minutes during our meal.",UNK
4574,This place really isn't all hyped up to be. I had a champon spicy and it was way too salty. I'd rather have Vietnamese pho any day.  It costed $15.  I will never go back.,UNK
4575,"Meh... precisely. Nice location, outdoor seating, and friendly staff. Mediocre American food. Best thing, it serves breakfast till 3 or 4pm. Basic basic American food with no twist.",UNK
4576,Food was okay....a bit pricey though for their selection.   Lechon kawali was fresh. roomie ordered French fries ; he said they were stale.  We ordered the shrimp platter and it took over 25 mins to arrive.,UNK
4577,"Was a regular, until today. Stood in line while they fumbled with the register for 10 minutes and then was promptly ignored while they went and prepped. Fine, don't take my money. I won't beg.",UNK
4578,"This is for the nightclub. \nIt was pretty empty. No line, no cover. \nMost people have not heard of it.\nMostly people there for bottle service since it was cheap there.\nNot the place to go for a Vegas clubbing experience.",UNK
4579,The atmosphere is really cool but the options were not that great. I got a veggie sandwich and it was not that great.,UNK
4580,"This place sucks, the food taste like medicine.  Way too salty. The guy at the register is sooooo rude, I should of went to Mcdonald instead. Yuckkkk. For all the people who gave bad reviews,  belive it or not but its true.",UNK
4581,"Price of the room was very reasonable. Kitchenette is equipped with plates, silverware, electric stove and refrigerator. Ice maker did not work. There is no ice maker on hotel premises. I like the hotel towels; they are thick.  The downfall for me is the room had an odor.",UNK
4582,"All you can eat for $26.00 is a great deal. Beats the Strip and tourist. It was good, fresh and creative. Definitely do it again and again! A no brainer!",UNK
4583,The walk up window though me off Ok Food but I had better BBQ in Phx,UNK
4584,People here are incompetent.  They claim I can't get a health certificate in the state of Nevada and fly my pet out from another state.  On top of that they apparently only take walkins.  I'll never bring my dog back here.,UNK
4585,There is a consistent bad smell in the meats/cheese area. The rancid smell is obvious and they lack proper ventilation. Can management do everything about it?,UNK
4586,"Decent food, nothing spectacular. Service is so-so, like any other chinese restaurant. We had about 10 different dishes, everything was ok and no after-the-fact rections so I guess that's a plus :) Definitely decent asian food in Vegas.",UNK
4587,"YES, I appreciate the undying love and dedication to In-N-Out Burger.  I just don't get it.  To me, the burger tasted like a somewhat better \""Big Mac.\""",UNK
4588,Err.... I wouldn't stop here again.  It's a classic joint but this location was not the best of A & W's.  At least it's on Route 66,UNK
4589,The food is bland and expensive. The ribs have no flavor. The mashed potatoes were lacking taste. The only thing I liked was the Pepsi.  This place should really shut down.,UNK
4590,"I work Uptown, so I have eaten here several times. Tin Tin is reasonably priced and convenient for a quick lunch. Most of the food, however, has a fast-food mall food court type feel. The Pho and Canton Noodle soups are plentiful and satisfying!",UNK
4591,"Looonnngg wait, suppose it's worth it to some, but definitely not one of my fave brunch places.  Great OJ, however.",UNK
4592,"Cleanliness is not on their radar. Outside patio was filthy, server kept running his hand thru his hair.",UNK
4593,"It was a rainy night. I wanted pad thai take-out and Sa-Bai Thong is just a couple miles down the road. Not amazing, but it's pad thai, so what do you expect. I thought their version was solid. Thanks, Sa-Bai Thong!",UNK
4594,"Excellent food and service.  However, food was cold to luke warm and served on cold plates.  Need to heat the plates and bring the food to a very high temperature before serving especially when it's 20 degrees outside.  Take a note from the Belgians.  They know how to do it very well.",UNK
4595,"The food is good. However, the service is super slow. they lose a lot of business because they can't  manage the lunch rush.  I  have visited several times and every time its the same thing.  Expect your order to take forever I can't say it enough.",UNK
4596,"No longer as inspired, service is aloof at best.  I used to look forward to power lunch specials but they seem off par lately and filet is no longer offered on the $25 business lunch.  Last time we ate here, steaks were grisly and tough - quality control?",UNK
4597,Not a good experience. Party of 5. Got all of the orders wrong in some way. Food was cold. Server was new. Didn't refill drinks. Didn't ask if we wanted dessert. If they don't ask I don't suggest. It's their tip.,UNK
4598,"Pizza is thick, chewy in the center, crunchy on the outside and tasteless",UNK
4599,Overrated. The frozen hot chocolate was nothing special and They seriously need to change the layout of the seating.,UNK
4600,"Kind of expensive, and so so service. \nThe lettuce wraps tasted weird and weren't very good, the xo green beans were just okay for $13, and the shrimp tasted flavorless and fishy. \nNo wonder it was pretty empty.",UNK
4601,"Terrible service.... Worse food. Server offered a\""generic\"" salad with an entree. I'll warn my friends and will never come back...I must say that the manager was the best part about this place",UNK
4602,15$ mimosa.  Mehh. Decent service for an airport bar. Menu was limited at my early Arrival. I opted for a liquid breakfast.,UNK
4603,Service was very good.  Pizza was just okay.  I came here three years ago and have been thinking about the tiramisu.  They don't have it any more.  Bring it back...thats the reason I came here.  The dessert menu seriously lacks.,UNK
4604,I would rate it as average. I would rather suggest you go to the yardhouse and spend the same for better food and service. Food is average service is not do good. Rating 2 and half.,UNK
4605,We ventured to Feedbag tonight and were not impressed with the food. The service was very good and portion sizes were nice but the instant macaroni and cheese and instant mashed potatoes left us disappointed.,UNK
4606,"If you like Guy Fieri, you'll love the food. If you love food, you may not appreciate the service or the lack of consistency in the product.",UNK
4607,OVERHYPED.  I've had better burgers almost everywhere.,UNK
4608,"Place is small, so friend and I ordered take-out. We tried the chicken kebab and the kofta kebab. It came with lots of rice, salad, grilled tomatoes and peppers. Taste was alright. Portion would definitely fill you up.",UNK
4609,Stopped in before heading to Springsteen concert Wed. night.  Nice local tavern feel to it.  Staff was very helpful.  Decent beer selection.  Tried the Caswell Chicken Oscar sandwich on staff recommendation.  Good sandwich.  Cold Beer.  Good selection on the juke box.,UNK
4610,"It's a mall. One Big A$$ mall with 4 levels of shopping. It boasts having Canada's largest food-court selection, and as others have mentioned: it's part of the underground city.",UNK
4611,Good food steak was a little dry but everything else was great,UNK
4612,"Pretty good.  Not my favorite custard place ever.  It was a little disappointing.  Also, employees are inconsistent in their serving sizes, which my husband pays attention to LOL! Its edible, but nothing we go out of our way for.",UNK
4613,Great spot; food ok; staff does try but not the best...love the views and the room.....,UNK
4614,Had breakfast here and found the quality of the food to be comparable to Denny's at prices that are nothing like Denny's.   A very disappointing dining experience.,UNK
4615,"Great when busy and the food is hot, but I've noticed that it isn't as good when it's a bit slow like a Saturday afternoon.",UNK
4616,Not sure what the rave about this place.  Decent sandwich at a decent price.  \n\n3 Stars.  Chances are I'll be back but wouldn't go out of my way for it.,UNK
4617,Great little head shop.,UNK
4618,Delivery was delish.,UNK
4619,The food was good but I don't think its worth the price. Suchi was good I loved the lobster roll but again its not filling and costs too much. The jalapeno yellowtail lived up to its hype but I wouldn't pay that price for it again.,UNK
4620,"Had some soy chicken, it wasn't very good.  Chicken came out a little cold and flavorless.  The other guys seemed to enjoy their meals.",UNK
4621,"Good place to go see a movie, only $7 matinee, not as good of a place to eat. The buffet is lackluster at best, something as simple as bread pudding lacks the flavor you would find in other buffets.",UNK
4622,Too expensive for the burger.  Rather eat at Red Robin. More for your money,UNK
4623,"Not impressed.  I had the nachos, calimari and fish and chips with my brother and nothing really stood out about them.  It was food...but not really anything to write home about.",UNK
4624,"The food is wonderful, some of the better dishes I've ever had. But months or a year ago they stopped letting anyone under 21 into the restaurant, so I no longer go because I don't want my son to feel left out. Great food, bad management",UNK
4625,Once was enough for me. Over all mediocre.,UNK
4626,"Its always nice with new cycle stores, but I think this store can do much better if they want to show planet X.\n\nI was relly bored walkong through the store.",UNK
4627,This place is now -Rick's Caberet-and it always looks dead probably since its a very hard to get to location.,UNK
4628,"I had a lunch buffet today, food is average taste. Nothing special or surprise items.common Indian buffet, interior looks good.Poor customer service.",UNK
4629,"We arrived at closing time...that may have affected my order.  I ordered the salmon burger and its ok! It wasn't very flavorful....very bland. The aioli sauce saved it from tasting like cardboard.  Sorry, but I wasn't impressed.",UNK
4630,"It is not your average-Charlotte menu. Most of the food is fried and it is certainly flavorful, but I wouldn't say spicy or hot. \n\nIt is a decent casual place to grab lunch and I would certainly go back.",UNK
4631,"Not a local company, they just contract out  to anybody. The lady I got was average. Overall the price is good but if you need really hardcore cleaning you'll need more than 1 person. The cleaning lady said cleaning inside cabinets and the fridge are not included. NOT all inclusive !!",UNK
4632,"Food was good but service is slipping. I ordered 3 chicken tenders only with the garlic sauce. I received the chicken tenders, but not the sauce.",UNK
4633,"Straightforward Italian fast food, efficiently served on New Years Eve",UNK
4634,"The chai latte was good, but no WiFi?   Probably a good place to chat it up with friends.  Unfortuneately since the chairs are hard and the WiFi disconnected, it doesn't meet my needs.  Not likely to return.",UNK
4635,This cute little pastry shop is open most of the night. Unfortunately the pastries look better than they taste (the cupcakes were good but forgettable) but could definitely curb a sweet tooth!,UNK
4636,"cute, good location, but all hype.  they screwed up my order and charged me extra, go figure.  a friend also got bad food poisoning. also, vegetarian / non-meat options are tofu, tofu, or tofu.",UNK
4637,Ordered food even though I wasn't hungry just because I could. Nowhere like it in NorCal.,UNK
4638,Super sad that there is no bakery or roasted duck inside this Ranch 99 location. :( Everything here is WAY overpriced and nothing is sold in bulk here.,UNK
4639,I don't understand why they act so unfriendly and provide such loose deadlines. Two weeks was what I was informed that it would take to fix my unit. I followed up after 9 days and was told now it will be three weeks and they haven't even started working on it.,UNK
4640,Girl at front counter was in a very bad mood didn't even say hi....  dirty and rude.. last time I'm coming here,UNK
4641,Awesome pizza! Wednesday half off bottles of wine is great for a ladies or date night. Nice bar and patio area.,UNK
4642,Neither great nor bad. Reliable cheap meal. Lots of selection to choose from.,UNK
4643,"Ra is a good standby, and they have good happy hour deals. Nothing mind blowing but not a bad place for some after-work drinks and sushi.",UNK
4644,"Not the best curry,  it's a bit pricey.  To little portions. But the people are very nice & have good customer service.",UNK
4645,"Holsteins is not the best burger in town. It was just \""meh\"". My burger was overcooked. I asked for a medium burger and got a well done burger. Not completely dry but pretty close. And of course it has Vegas Strip prices.",UNK
4646,"A lot of stores, bars and restaurant options. Cool interior, well-appointed rooms, exquisite tubs and showers and location on the strip. However, although I understand pricing in Vegas, I disagree alcoholic drinks should cost $18. Not for me.",UNK
4647,"Nothing bad, nothing great, service good.\nWill return to try again to see if I have the same reaction.",UNK
4648,"I must say, this business has excellent customer service. They sent out a new batch of food that was good. Much better then the first batch. Everything we just tried was delicious this time. Maybe I was too harsh the first time. I will continue ordering from them in the future.",UNK
4649,"Once you get sat down in the theater this place is great. How ever, it's a bit odd how empty it always is. And the front seems dirty and unmaintained. This should have been a 12-16 not a 24 imo.",UNK
4650,The meat is bbq less. Who wants to add sauce to their own bbq...not me. It was 3 star worthy. The fries & beans were just ok. Will I return maybe.,UNK
4651,"5/30/09 - music was great!!!! hip hop, r&b and reggae... but it was HOOOOD!!!! thank goodness this guy i knew gotta table, which was away from the hoodness!",UNK
4652,It was very delicious and tastey.,UNK
4653,"The hot dogs are similar to what you would have at a good back yard BBQ. This place is a bit overrated, nothing compared to Pinks or Wurstk\u00fcche in Los Angeles. The onion rings were the best item to get here.",UNK
4654,It was OK... I'm a foodie and love Mexican so wanted to try it out.  Wasnt impressed! The waitress was super sweet :) the food on the other hand was out of a can.  With all the Mexican restaurants in town this is not worth checking out.,UNK
4655,A-OK,UNK
4656,"Circular stairs - ugh! Gallery - really pretty. Dining room - ok (have you seen Hearst Castle in California?) Mary, Queen of Scots area - historically nice.",UNK
4657,"Overpriced and just ok..  Service wasn't anything fantastic.  Grind Burger up the street is better, cheaper, and cool ambiance.",UNK
4658,"Good Burger, but over price.",UNK
4659,They really need to invest in some more food areas. Other than that it was a pretty convenient location from TI since they had a shuttle to and from the show I was attending.,UNK
4660,"Usually have a little wait even with an appointment, but it gives the kiddo time to play with the train and pick her movie.",UNK
4661,"Stopped in for half price apps, the pot stickers and and skewered bbq chicken.  Was pleased with the value and would stop back in.  Little to no atmosphere.  Would have to try again to recommend.",UNK
4662,This place looks like its getting ready to close down!!! Weird.,UNK
4663,"Nice remodel and pedicure was ok, but still searching for my go-to spot.",UNK
4664,"Decent staff, a little above average \""bar food\"", and a cool  ambiance with fireplaces and a pool table... looking for a northeastern ski lodge cozy feeling was found at the Outside Inn!",UNK
4665,"Ok, so it's Panda Express, just like every other Panda, but without the express part. I have never come here and not waited for them to have to make food. Forget about eating here is there is more than a couple of people in front of you.",UNK
4666,Very busy place and usually a delayed time to see the doctor even if you have an appointment set.,UNK
4667,"For a quick lunch, my friends and I would go here. Quick, friendly.",UNK
4668,This is consistently the most unorganized Einsteins we go to. We try to avoid this location but when we find ourselves here our hopes are that they've improved. Year after year we've found they they stay consistent: unorganized and confused.,UNK
4669,Good beer selection. Service sucks.,UNK
4670,"Nothing special.  Had the Sicilian crust.  Not the type of pizza i want to eat again.  The place was crowded, lots of families.  I would go to Grimaldi's next time.",UNK
4671,Much better than Subway...especially the bread.  The employees are always great and accommodating.  This store is also a really big supporter of our community and they deserve our business because of it.  \nI just wish they had spinach as an alternative to lettuce.,UNK
4672,Had a sloppy egg/bacon breakfast with what they called 'guacamole'. I have not had the chance to eat their main dishes.,UNK
4673,The server stepped on my foot while we were waiting to be seated. She acted as if she didn't feel anything. No apology at all!,UNK
4674,Been here a couple of times to get my vege fix.  Good price and fast.  The line is always long and it can be hot or miss.  Buffet has various types foods from all over.  My favorite is the Middle Eastern section.  You can find better than this...,UNK
4675,"Will agree with Mio S. Good quality, fresh, friendly pep. \nActually their salad looked better than pizza.",UNK
4676,Not the friendliest of service but they get your order correct 90% of the time.,UNK
4677,"I like this place.  The people are friendly and the food is good.  It is definetly quiet.  I must say though, I enjoy a good quiet setting from time to time.  It is a wonder how they stay in business though.  It's always sparce on the patrons.",UNK
4678,i feel like this hotel and casino is more appealing to the guys than gals. i think i only like the green glow of the place on the outside hahaha!,UNK
4679,I was impressed at the variety of foods available on the buffet. The Sushi was delicious. \nThe plating on the salads was beautiful. Service was great.\nThe downside is the price- I thought it was expensive for a buffet.,UNK
4680,They always get my order wrong. The waitress looked like she was on drugs. happy hour pricing is good. great patio seating to view the whole strip from henderson. Just dont expect  your food to come out correctly.,UNK
4681,"The ramen is good, but the selection is not. They only have fatty pork... Im a beef eater.",UNK
4682,"The meat in the chicken and beef pho was overcooked and dry. Service was slow, had to flag down our waitress, who was busy on her cell phone, to get her to help us.",UNK
4683,"Not the newest or the nicest but, everything you need and usually no wait for machines. The staff is super nice and there are magazines to read while your there. If they could just turn up the AC a little bit and put ESPN on more than two of the TVs.",UNK
4684,The Razzleberry Pie was super but pricy $12.99. I guess next month is $5.99 pies. Oh well it was yummy.,UNK
4685,"Pros: Sushi is good\n\nCons: Service slow and lacking, music too loud, people seated too close to you.\n\nRecommend to others: Yes, if they are the patient sort.",UNK
4686,I'm adding an extra star because they have cute counter staff.,UNK
4687,I enjoyed my sushi rolls.  Staff was friendly and the place is clean and nice inside.,UNK
4688,"Came in here for a quick lunch before my flight. The food is decent. However, I wouldn't say that it was an authentic Vietnamese restaurant, much more like a Chinese restaurant to me.",UNK
4689,Came here on a Friday late night about an hour before closing. Service was slow and waiter got our 2 item order wrong. They were out of one of the topping options (which are few to begin with). Too many other options around to want to ever come back here again.,UNK
4690,Meh.... $20 for a chicken Caesar salad is a tough sell even in town square. Too much good competion in the same mall for that.,UNK
4691,"These bagels are fine, but I think their drinks are yummy. I like the blackberry lemonade. \n\nThe interior is sterile, but air conditioned with clean bathrooms and on state street that is saying a lot.",UNK
4692,"I stopped by yesterday, only to find out this location has closed : (",UNK
4693,Awesome atmosphere. Awesome staff. Unique food. Ok taste.,UNK
4694,"People love this place.  I am just not a fan of their pizza.  Then again, I am an ex-New Yorker!",UNK
4695,Terrible car wash. Only reason it gets 2 stars is because the manager was responsible and offered a free wash (which I won't be using),UNK
4696,"Typical Vegas buffet. You won't be blown away but it's better than cafeteria food. If you're settling for a buffet, you should be expecting this. If you want a good buffet, then go to Bellagio or the Wynn.",UNK
4697,"It's a bar with fun latin nights.Haven't had the food but if you know how to salsa, or don't but like the vibe, Cosmos is probably one of the more fun places to go dancing.",UNK
4698,Party time!,UNK
4699,Cool experience but definitely not worth almost $40/person. Bar was very small and liquor selection was limited. Won't go there ever again.,UNK
4700,"If it weren't for the steep price ($20/ person), it'd totally be worth it.  I'd say that $15 would make it feel like a better value.  However, my group spent an enjoyable hour checking out the dolphins and various felines.",UNK
4701,Same old starbucks as everywhere else. Have your usual!  I love the white mocha frap  with caramel. This is probably the main reason I come to Starbucks.,UNK
4702,Took 30 minutes for a beer however burger was excellent!  Staff was very friendly and apologized for the delayed beer and was very good about recovering from the mishap.,UNK
4703,"Great food, great servers. Mgmt? Not sure. Friday night. 12 open tables and they are making families wait. We actually sat at an open table waiting for them to seat us at an open table??",UNK
4704,"Food was good and customer service, just a bit over priced.",UNK
4705,"Unfortunately I was not impressed with food quality. I had only ever been to the Cabo San Lucas location, and hoped it was isolated. Food was not great, service was barely available and drinks were ok.",UNK
4706,"Hillside is missing a couple things. Outside music and attentive service. Two things that make sitting on the patio on a Sunday, much, much better.\nGood service is a concious choice.",UNK
4707,I hate that I let my friends convince me to eat at this place on the Strip.  Spent approx. $60 for 2 dinners and 2 beers.  The quality was just mediocre too.  Grrr...never again!,UNK
4708,You would think they would know how to pour a Guinness correctly . . . . after I got over this I enjoyed myself.,UNK
4709,Overrated and expensive with spotty service.,UNK
4710,"The food was excellent but it was very expensive for the portion sizes. For three of us at lunch, the bill before tip was $105 & we didn't even have drinks. Service was good too but again I can't justify the price.",UNK
4711,"well, that was fast! my sandwich was made before i even finished paying.\n\nThe bread wasn't anything to write home about. \n\n\nThe whole experience was simple, fast, and easy.",UNK
4712,"Great smoked meat, environment is not bad and serving was so so",UNK
4713,"The casino floor is remodeling annd it is kinda messy for now... it looks very nice.   The room was terrible.   The furniture not align, dirty,  and carpet is very old.  Pretty much a run down hotel.",UNK
4714,Its alright.,UNK
4715,Good dinner.  Family friendly way to spend a few hours.,UNK
4716,"Average at best \""Italian\"" food. Way over priced for the quality of food and service that you receive. I suggest saving your money and going elsewhere.",UNK
4717,"Overrated and expensive. When Oceanaire opens at the Biltmore, I'd gladly drive down there versus Ocean Club.",UNK
4718,"Could be better.  There are many other MJ's epic songs were not perform in the show.  Over all, a decent show; definitely could be better.  Since this is still a new show compare to majority of other popular shows in Vegas, there is alot of room to improve.",UNK
4719,"Great location but the wait time and employees, not so great!\n\nThey need loud upbeat music or something.. If I took my time\nAnd did not acknowledge customers I'd be in big trouble.",UNK
4720,Food is great a little skimpy on portions but great flavors.  We got 4 meat choice deal and for 20 + dollars I think there should be more.  Sides are small also but tasty not sure if I'll be back but maybe for a lunch need more food for dinner,UNK
4721,not as good as expected..... I guess I like Cora more.....\nThe Montreal putine was too salty to have a bite. :(,UNK
4722,First time at this one and I get my cup and go fill up my drink only to find an ant in my drink. Restaurant looked fairly clean and all but I just can't stand finding stuff in my drinks or food but the food was fresh and out in a reasonable time.,UNK
4723,Not that good.,UNK
4724,just another outlet,UNK
4725,"Barbershop conversation is never an issue until the barbers neglect the fact that a lot of their customers are professionals and not looking to spend all day at the shop. Otherwise, you will leave with a good cut. Make a reservation if possible.",UNK
4726,"They don't take culinary insurance. If you have culinary you must pay a $75 office fee. Apart from that, everything else seemed very good.",UNK
4727,It's a rip-off for a simple passport photo. It's 12 bucks-- way too expensive for such a low quality passport photo!,UNK
4728,Amazing burgers!  We even saw Robert Duvall chowing down on one when we went.,UNK
4729,"Went for the \""garlic festival\"".  Love this place but where was the garlic festival?  They were selling some garlic but that was it.  Very disappointing. I will continue to buy their oils and spreads but won't bother to attend anymore \""festivals\"".",UNK
4730,Good food but all three people I went with got food poisoning.  All three had rotisserie chicken. Won't be going back soon.,UNK
4731,Old fashioned cafe. Simple meat and three menu plus a bunch of sandwiches. \nMassive amount of food. \nMost of patrons work nearby.,UNK
4732,"For a place specializing in burgers, their burgers are really unimpressive. They are not bad by any means. Just boring. The outside seating is a plus though.",UNK
4733,"Great service. Knowledgable. Just remember though. It's pizza. Just pizza. If there's more than an hour wait, don't wait. Just go somewhere else. They'll be around next time.",UNK
4734,"Cine Capri is great, especially for movies like Gravity.  Food and drink choices could be improved, though they're certainly better than Desert Ridge's.  Had issues one time with broken seats and crazy loud volume.  Still usually better than AMC.",UNK
4735,I only gave 3 stars since it took forever to navigate through the store but I wanted to give a shout out to my cashier Tameika. She was super friendly!,UNK
4736,"Food was okay, but coming from SoCal i've had better for less than half the price! The margaritas were awesome, but for $16 they better be!! I probably wouldn't come back here again, too expensive!",UNK
4737,"Check out the 1929 Steinway self playing piano. One of two in the world, the other is in the Smithsonian. The piano is valued at 28 million dollars and was willed to the Wrigley Mansion",UNK
4738,What a pleasant surprise.   Great and ever changing beers on tap.  Nice open decor and decent bar food.  Flanny's has become a go to place for a quick bite and a brew.  It's a whole lot nicer than the last few occupants  at this location.,UNK
4739,"The pizza has too much cheese, is too greasy, and is not great. The gyro is average to good. The burgers were surprisingly good for a pizza delivery place. Better than a lot of delivery pizza in the area, but nothing special.",UNK
4740,Great pizza on the west size with an awesome medium buffalo wings sauce for the side \nYummy,UNK
4741,"This is very simple. If you come to this show without expectations, I am sure you will love it.\n\nIf you come to this show expecting acrobatics seen in other Cirque shows, you will be disappointed.",UNK
4742,"I've been to a number of these stores, and for decorations or womans clothing it may be a hit, but for mens clothing I just get disappointed Everytime I attempt to shop there.",UNK
4743,The broccoli beef and ginger mushroom chicken were okay. The chow mien was the worst I've ever had. Undercooked and bland. I'm a good eater and left it all on the plate.,UNK
4744,"Nothing special...  A so so Chicago dog!!!\nNo resemblance to the dogs I had in Chicago this summer.  The place is more like a \""Taste of Cleveland\""!  You get what you pay for... but not here!!!",UNK
4745,"Food is great but service is terrible. This is one of my favorite restaurants, but this location doesn't make the grade. Waited 15 minutes in an empty restaurant at 1:30 for a bean burrito to go. Seriously...",UNK
4746,Service was good waitresses friendly I ordered the burnt ends and they were fairly awful. I went because it was close to my motel. I will drive farther for food next time. Beware.,UNK
4747,"There is something just missing from this beef sandwich. I cant place my finger on it. It wasnt bad at all but its missing something. I had the beef sandwich wet, with cheese and peppers just how i get it at al's and its short.",UNK
4748,This place closed its doors for business,UNK
4749,Food is Shitty probably would be good if they had a cook that knew how to cook it correctly.  Staff is ok no complaints drinks are good as well,UNK
4750,"Overpriced. Did I just pay $30 for a soggy, excessively-oily pizza? Ugh.\nAlso, service was as slow as a snail. Not worth the visit, trust me.",UNK
4751,"Service is OK.  Food is quite tasty, though a touch on the oily side.  We went on a Saturday for dinner and were happy to go back for Sunday lunch.  I plan on going back.",UNK
4752,"Good coffee, good service, but terrible Wi-Fi! I came here to get a little work done and it was impossible due to the ridiculously slow speed of their Internet here. I will definitely find another place to grab a cup of coffee and work next time I'm in the area.",UNK
4753,This place is alright. Sometimes its great sometimes its blah. \nOne time my popcorn was so salty i returned it 3 times!! \nThe theaters are always half way cleaned. \nI love $5 Tuesdays.,UNK
4754,"$10 for a 4:20pm show. The absolute WORST movie theater popcorn I have ever eaten. I wish I'd have gone a few miles out of the way to AMC for $5 tickets and good popcorn. Very, very disappointing visit!",UNK
4755,"Good place to go for cheap food, great location, especially in the Tempe area.  Fast and friendly service.",UNK
4756,Argh not worth it. Just go to paris buffet. Yes the have fewer choices but it doesnt suck like the spice market.,UNK
4757,"Typical Golden Corral. Food was good, service was good, price was good. No complaints.",UNK
4758,"The food was as good as advertised but the service was not. We sat down for 15-20 min before anyone even said a word to us. Finally, a waiter who didn't even work in our area helped us out.",UNK
4759,Good burger. I was expecting ahi tuna burgers or shrimp burgers with crazy sauces. The menu was really beef focused. I had the asian inspired burger with hoisin glaze and pork belly. I gave it 8 out of 10.,UNK
4760,It's ok... As far as airports go!  I quite enjoy sitting back and watching people sprint barefoot through the airport to get to their connection!!!!,UNK
4761,"Store is closing soon... (sign on window)\n\nI have purchased some FCUK shirts here, but this time there were barely any selection left.",UNK
4762,Very very average with snarky tourist fatigued service. Skip it and head to art:brgr. Excellent cider though.,UNK
4763,I liked the atmosphere but the food was WAY too salty.  Just didn't care for it.,UNK
4764,"Had I yelped this buffet before shelling out the cash, I might not have found myself sitting at the table wondering whether the executive chef graduated from the Culinary Institute of Hometown.",UNK
4765,The sushi was good but I was expecting a better experience from what i had heard. Decor/ambience not up to the price level.,UNK
4766,"Very pricey even for the airport.. though fresh and acceptable. The bagels don't have that chewy bagel texture, more like bread. In a pinch, it'll do.",UNK
4767,"Meh, this place is OK. Pittsburgh Chinese sucks so there aren't many options, it's pretty much here or Mandarin. I usually go Mandarin if they are open. This is a decent back up when they are closed-- delivery on weekends is weird.... just saying'.",UNK
4768,Review deleted,UNK
4769,"Great staff.  Rather hilly.  Good conference setting.  Room was very pleasant.  Need to pay for wireless, refrigerator is stocked with high priced beverages.  Coffee machine is modest.  Pools are nice.  Good for a weekend get-away.",UNK
4770,what a dump,UNK
4771,"The FARM BURGER was seriously average, nothing to rave about. \n\nGo for the CHILI HOTDOG instead!\n\nThe MAUI ONION RINGS are a must!",UNK
4772,every time i order from them it takes more than 30 min and i live less than a mile away. my order is always right minus one time that was wrong,UNK
4773,This review is just for the take out counter. Went in to get cheesecake that would not have nuts in it. Lovely staff were kind enough to walk me through the options. Ended up with a white chocolate blueberry cheesecake. Hit the spot.,UNK
4774,"Went here because they were supposed to have a nice craft beer selection, which they did. However if I am going to buy premium priced beer I want it to be kept in a cooler and not just sitting out.  No, thanks, won't be back.",UNK
4775,I actually thought the prices were reasonable for Vegas and for the Wynn. The food is good and the service was fine (although there were exactly 4 parties in the place when I went) The Wynn is sort of isolated uptown but it is beautiful.,UNK
4776,"Came here for happy hour, the food was ok, asked the bar tender about the free drink with any purchase offer on yelp. He didn't even know about it, and didn't give me an answer neither....",UNK
4777,"We use this as one of our staple restaurants. Better than average food and good service. It is noisy because of the poor ceiling design, but other than that it's a good place to go for a quick dinner, lunch, or happy hour.",UNK
4778,I am sorry but after experiencing The Buffet at Aria wicked spoon does not compare. Bad selection food is just okay and I was disappointed with most of the food I ate. The chef at the omelet station needs to go back to culinary school and learn how to make an omelet.,UNK
4779,"Nice place, very rustic and southwestern. The prime rib was very tender and tasted great. The service could be a little quicker, but other than that its an outstanding family restaurant.",UNK
4780,"Good and local, but ask them to run your slice through the oven twice - otherwise it doens't come out hot.",UNK
4781,"Quick and easy boarding! I never have a problem getting my baggage within a decent time frame. The only con is that there is a bit of traffic getting to your gate, so make sure you leave at least an hour to check in your bags.",UNK
4782,"Tried this place out and the food was ok, what concerned me was the cleanliness of the kitchen. The floor was really dirty, under the burners or stove seemed to have months of grease buildup etc. 50c extra to use debit or credit card btw.",UNK
4783,"Food and atmosphere are just Ok here.  Probably shouldn't have gotten an enchilada in a more \""tex mex\"" kinda place ... however the service and margaritas are definitely something everyone should experience!",UNK
4784,The food is good but service was slow and had to keep asking for meats to come to the table. Seems like they are understaffed. Over all good place and good food but service needs improvement,UNK
4785,"we ordered porridge, chow mein, and i got a grass jelly drink. all the food was average chinese food. it's one of the only decent chinese restaurants that isn't fusion nor expensive in vegas.",UNK
4786,"Hmm...sadly, not enough menu... :( ... Margarita would've been awesome, till I found a \""Fruit Fly\"" in my drink...hmm... other than that, staff were great and great location...",UNK
4787,Average in every way.  Not saying it was bad...just average.,UNK
4788,"L'endroit est agr\u00e9able, la nourriture est bonne, mais... Ce que l'on propose comme choix n'est pas \u00e0 la hauteur de l'Europea.",UNK
4789,"This place has gotten progressively worse. The \""home fries\"" are either burnt hard or chewy raw. The new menus look great but are held together with bread ties. I believe in supporting our local restaurants but this is our last time here.",UNK
4790,The food was great as well as their service. their pizza was delish i want to go back soon! :),UNK
4791,Just as good as your typical Westfield mall.  No thing special about it.  I used it as an air-conditioned walk-through from my Trump hotel room to the main part of the strip.  Downside is that shops and restaurants/food court close so early.,UNK
4792,This Walmart sucks. There's never enough employees to deal with the massive hordes of customers. There is almost always somebody trying to shoplift something. There is also a lot of bickering and arguing between customers in line. It's like a ghetto.,UNK
4793,Over priced for what it is. A good place to have a couple drinks for happy hour,UNK
4794,"Sorry Nandos hideaway but the food was not great at all. No flavor , pricey , not even eye appealing. The only tasty thing was the Ranchero sauce.",UNK
4795,"This was slightly short of OK.  Table and chairs were uncomfortable.  it looked really cute, but it was crowded, busy, and the waitstaff was rude, rushed us, and overall, it wasn't a pleasant dining experience.",UNK
4796,Smells like old people.,UNK
4797,"While waiting for some friends, we ordered some edamame and spicy tuna rolls.  The edamame was tasty and steamed perfectly, while the the spicy tuna rolls were good. Great for grabbing a quick bite to eat if you're at the Hyatt.",UNK
4798,"We went drive through and the cashier was extremely lazy. We asked for a medicine and she said \"" we sell that upfront \""",UNK
4799,Hail ceasar was relatively boring.. Dressing was bland. Baby kale salad was really good. Turkey burger was okay... Don't get the gluten free bread! Drinks were good.,UNK
4800,Have been now 3 times and enjoyed but now they are constantly RUNNING OUT of stuff so two stars is the best I can give. Not worth the price!!!,UNK
4801,"I absolutely loved the setup and overall atmosphere. Although I wasn't too impressed by the food - which felt a little overpriced and tasted just OK, this is definitely a great place for drinks and oysters for a festive evening.",UNK
4802,Great food! Delicious fresh pizza. Service a little slow. I knocked off a star because they don't recycle. That was a big surprise for a restaurant with organic food.,UNK
4803,Good stuff but didn't take my yelp coupon. :( cuz it wasn't the right size appetizer. I would of known if they offered different sized appetizers.,UNK
4804,Drive Thru STINKS!!!!! Go in IF you want a half way decent meal. The service has been TERRIBLE at this location for a while. Can't understand how they are still in business. ANY of them for that matter.,UNK
4805,"The waits at the drive thru used to be terrible, however recently it doesn't seem that bad. I like to get the grilled chicken... it's pretty tasty.",UNK
4806,"Not a bad option if you are starving at the PHX airport. Ordered the Chicken Lo Mein. The vegetables tasted fresh, the chicken was white meat and the service was kind.",UNK
4807,RIP,UNK
4808,I believe the name has changed to Cous Cous.  I think they have new owners & chefs.  the lamb burger spices have changed for the lesser .  doubt I will return.  I don't like the last 2 new cashiers I've delt with.,UNK
4809,Just ok. Expensive for a diner. Been there about 6 times and that's been awhile. If you like over priced ok diner food then stop but there are a lot better places right down the road.,UNK
4810,The flavor was good but for the price I would have expected a little more meat. I like more meat then bread but other then that it was good. I will try again!,UNK
4811,Chips and salsa are my favorite here. Food and service are just ok!,UNK
4812,"Not real impressed.  Sauce wasn't all that and sliced beef was tough. Trash can was full, restaurant wasn't real clean. Two small sandwiches and two sides came to $20.   Won't be back.",UNK
4813,"Had the chicken kabob and hummus. Didnt enjoy either, hence, the two stars. On the other hand, the bartender was really nice. Might give a second try.",UNK
4814,"I stopped by Pinos today in hopes of trying it but to my dismay they do not take Visa unless the bill is over $25.00 bummer!!  So, one day when I happen to have cash will be the day I get to try it.",UNK
4815,Drinks was alright. Lots of areas to sit in. Love the atmosphere but hate the DJs. They can't spin crap so I end up leaving the place earlier than I plan to.,UNK
4816,"blech.  this isn't pizza.  the steak hoagie tasted decent, but that's not steak either... then again this wouldn't be worst decision you could make at 1AM",UNK
4817,"Average Chinese food, certainly not fusion.  Spring rolls boring and greasy, as was veggie chow mein boring.  Broccoli in oyster sauce was good and a good price",UNK
4818,I've eaten here a couple times and just don't get what the hype is all about.  The portions are wasteful and the food is just okay.  There is nothing farm fresh about it. Service is fine though.,UNK
4819,The angry grinch guy with the glasses pretty much annoyed us the whole time we were there. If you work at a place with children be happy! Don't ruin an experience for people who are paying to have fun.,UNK
4820,Food atmosphere and beer are always great! The service here is the worst anywhere I have been in a long while. It's not just this visit it's all four visits I have made in the last year.,UNK
4821,Staff are a little snooty. Good ambience. If you are not a regular it's like you don't exist.,UNK
4822,"Decent pub fare, decent beer, decent prices.  Good spot for a casual bite,  we had our 4yr old with and they had a children's menu which is great.",UNK
4823,Pretty good delivery of traditional fare. Gotta point out the Fish Taco's as exceptional. Rating would be higher but the service is inconsistent.,UNK
4824,"Atmosphere was decent/ clean. Service was good, they are friendly and fast. The Greek salad was decent but not the best I've had. The chicken shawarma was not very good, maybe it's just me, would not order it again.",UNK
4825,BEST pork skewers...BUT 1. Whats with the lettuce? All it does is make whatever I ordered taste like lettuce. And 2. Please do something about those flies buzzing about indoors. Its the reason I prefer to go when I order there,UNK
4826,"What's all of the hype? There is better pizza in town like everywhere. Napolis, Sammy's, Angelina's, Rocco's NY PIzza, etc. etc.",UNK
4827,Took along time to get some help and they were not busy.,UNK
4828,I was here for dinner on a Saturday night . The place was crowded but not jammed . I had the seafood tasting and my date had the chefs tasting . We were both pleased but I felt the portions were small . The only draw back was that the service was slow but everyone was professional and nice .,UNK
4829,"Sorry Papa. My pizza was kinda bland, nothing really special about it. Instead of the Supreme maybe next time (if there is one) I'll try one of those specialty pizzas.",UNK
4830,"We went here for breakfast on Saturday.  We had the breakfast burrito  $13 and the french toast $12.  The small portion was good for breakfast, but the set up and service could use some improvements.\n\nI can't believe we spent $38 for breakfast and coffee",UNK
4831,Mediocre place. Service is trying to sell over priced items. House wine is less than expectations. Overall experience is disappointed.,UNK
4832,Nice place but DO NOT take an apartment facing South Blvd. Extremely loud music from local bars until 2-3 am Thursday through Saturday,UNK
4833,"Great location, fun atmosphere, excellent service, hit and miss food quality. The chicken enchiladas were bland, but my daughter loved the spicy chicken tacos. With all the great restaurant options in Vegas, I won't be eating here again.",UNK
4834,"Food was okay I wasn't impressed. My girlfriend had a salad and a she got was a lousy iceberg salad. The service was slow , I doubt I'll go back .",UNK
4835,"Management has definitely improved their service, menu, cleanliness. Huge improvement!",UNK
4836,One of those places where you can make their menu items vegan/vegetarian  by asking for changes.  This is not what I look for in a restaurant.,UNK
4837,"The wait was long and my soup was cold. The cappuccino was alright. Everything on the \""light\"" menu has eggs, so if you don't like eggs and don't want something with 80g of fat and sugar for breakfast, you're kind of screwed.",UNK
4838,"I like eating here when I go downtown. As I'm grubbing, and I'm the only customer there, the fat bald cook proceeds to yell at the busser. Borderline threatening him. One of the most uncomfortable experiences ever. Shame on that dude.",UNK
4839,"Tad pricy for a gay bar,",UNK
4840,"The food and drink special were GREAT, but the service was not! I believe the service makes half the experience when going out to eat and the hostess was rude and our server was not too friendly, but it may have been because she was serving like 5 or 6 tables and was way too rushed.",UNK
4841,Cheap dry cleaning but Im not big on people eating while they do customer service. I can still smell her food.,UNK
4842,Good food and good music is a winner any night. They bring in some great bands and keep the resturant on top par with most strip favs,UNK
4843,"Pure, purely sucks.  The drinks were overpriced and half of the club was roped off and outside was closed as well.",UNK
4844,I feel like I'm in the 80s at this movie theater . This place is in need of a major renovation and carpet cleaning,UNK
4845,"This place reminds me of a dollar store. The reason I had to stop in was because they carried a toy that my son wanted. Otherwise, I don't think I would have stopped in. Prices aren't all that great either.",UNK
4846,Tired. Staff and food.,UNK
4847,They have lost clothing on me twice and I still have not received a call or follow up on an article of clothing they lost.  Should have come on here first!,UNK
4848,Food is enjoyable and portions are big. Tried there Jamaican chicken wings and jerk shrimp. Both were average.,UNK
4849,"This buffet is alright.  I think it is too hyped up.  None of the items really stood out.  I went for brunch, and they didnt have crab legs nor sashimi.  Those are my 2 favorite thing to eat, and they didnt have it.  Oh well.",UNK
4850,We like this buffet cuz my hubby always gets buy 1 get 1 free with his taxi id and with our daughter that's 3 is also free; makes it an awesome price for the three of us.  Food is good for our price.,UNK
4851,If you want to stay at a hotel on the strip stay away from the Stratosphere. It is the last hotel on the strip and too far walk to and from. Sure the place is cheaper then the rest but its not worth it.,UNK
4852,"More Austin powers than James Bond.  Dancers in god-awful outfits strut in raised boxes.  Signature cocktails are $10 and either too sweet or too sour, but come with adorable gummie bears.  Not exclusive as the name indicates, as you will see anyone who is everyone.",UNK
4853,"Always have a few people in here and the food is pretty typical.  Quick stop for an average lunch.  Kalua pork has good flavor, curry is too blah but their crab rangoon is always good.",UNK
4854,Tous leurs plats avec du smoke meat sont excellents. Vaut le d\u00e9tour. Service rapide et courtois.,UNK
4855,A little too dark but still a nice place. Forgot what drink I ordered but it was tasty. Its a small  setting and good for small group of friends to have a few drinks. Very relaxed atmosphere.,UNK
4856,"Was great the first time I went, but this last time was not ass good.  The tonkotsu ramen broth was so thick that it felt like I was eating a bowl of ramen with gravy...",UNK
4857,"Essen war ok, aber nichts besonderes. Durchschnitt. Die pasta bekommen wir zuhause besser hin. Service wirklich verbesserungsw\u00fcrdig !",UNK
4858,"Parking not very welcoming to large RV's, and don't park next door at the convenience station they charge to park. Staff seemed confused on how to handle special requests, choosing instead to argue with a customer in-front of me and behind me.",UNK
4859,Went during lunch on Saturday. Food came out in too many phases. Corn then rice then calamari then shrimp basket. Pretty simple menu but flavorful.\nI would recommend for folks on a budget but still want decent seafood,UNK
4860,"Lol,hahahha,heheheh i dont Know where to start.I'm gonna Say that Come to the United States of America to See a Real Shopping centre.",UNK
4861,It's alright I guess. My bun bo hue was a touch too bland and my friends basil pork thing was several touches blander. All the more curious because the chicken larb was pretty solid tasting and flavorful.,UNK
4862,"Terrible location, excellent food. I'll be returning for sure to surprise my co-workers with breakfast!",UNK
4863,"This place was really good but it didn't amaze me or anything. The pizza was good but pizza is always good to me. You definitely get what you pay for though! I ate four garlic knots, only one piece of pizza and a cannoli and I was crazy full!",UNK
4864,"The cheesesteak was edible. The service was grumpy. \n\nThis is Oakland we're talking about, so no surprises there. \n\nI give it 2 greasy stale buns out of 5.",UNK
4865,Food was great...service...not so much.  It may have just been a bad day for them...will give another chance.,UNK
4866,"Not a bad place to browse around for a while. The staff is cheerful and relaxed. it's mostly geared for college kids, though.",UNK
4867,"This restaurant was pretty average. The steak, a little worse than average. It kind of made me feel like I was a ranch hand, because they didn't have real tables or seats. Just picnic tables.",UNK
4868,Cool bartenders. Best view in Vegas. Disappointing dj. Great if you like middle aged women with no underwear.,UNK
4869,Bey good food. The only thing is that it's a little bit pricey for what your getting.,UNK
4870,Decor was nice but the food needs flavor. If you like bland Mexican this is for you.,UNK
4871,"Regardless of what Darren W. said, I do not, nor have I ever worked for Phantom of the Attic. However, I have shopped there, and appreciated their selection.",UNK
4872,"I know my friends like this place.  But to me the service was lazy and veryy slow. Gnats flying all around, and the soda was flat.  The waitress said it wasn't.  No paper towels in the bathroom.",UNK
4873,FREEZING in this restaurant. they have eliminated SO MANY appetizers.  my pretzel sticks were over cooked.  service is slow & there is almost no one here. probably won't return.  go to Applebee's instead.,UNK
4874,"Ordered the iced coffee with sugar free hazelnut. The coffee tasted horrible, I've had better come from a can of Folgers.",UNK
4875,Not impressed. Really just a concept restaurant with meh food and kitschy decor. OK as a local bar hangout and no more. So many other options especially on Monroe St!,UNK
4876,It used to be good. But recently the quality plummeted badly. I don't wanna eat here again! Tasteless wings. Bad servers. Nothing is good about this place now!,UNK
4877,"Sad little place, even by Pittsburgh standards. Ambience of a funeral parlor, with average age of patrons about 69. Exemplary Calabria's dish? Oriental chicken salad garnished with uncooked ramen noodles.",UNK
4878,Ac didnt work cleaning staff walked in without knocking wont be staying here again,UNK
4879,"Great music, atmosphere & patio. Overpriced food. Our server wasn't great.  Had to wait forever to get anything, like our bill, and the restaurant wasn't busy.",UNK
4880,"This hotel was busy during the weekend I visited, and at times the front desk was short staffed. Noise in the rooms from nearby I-17 was a problem. There are so many hotels in this area, I'll stay somewhere else in the future.",UNK
4881,So I had this when I just visited back to Vegas. Tried the Baby Back Ribs and the Mac and Cheese. I didn't love it. It was o.k. I really enjoy TC's RIB Crib more.  Nice place inside and friendly staff.,UNK
4882,Walked in on saturday night. Restaurant half empty but was turned away cuz no reservation (along with 2 other parties)! Promptly booked reservations on opentable and got seated. Food good but service and general operations will doom this place to a short life:(,UNK
4883,Not the best Starbucks experience I've ever had.   Messy and slow.,UNK
4884,"got the number 6. I was disappointed with the food. it was semi warm, it just wasnt flavorful.\nthe hummus was decent tho.  I felt ripped off with the price, 10 bucks for this? NO THANKS. Not going back",UNK
4885,I was surprised at how small the cake was.    But had the cake tasted awesome it would have made up for it.   It was one of the worst cakes I had ever tasted .    Very very disappointing,UNK
4886,"Not bad for a 24 hour joint, fast service but the food was only worth 2 stars at best... Definitely will NOT be coming back...!!! Dirty tables & floors...!",UNK
4887,"Smoothies are fine. Just like any other Jamba Juice location. However, this location never honors it's Groupon deals, which needs to be fixed. Stop posting Groupons or honor them, Bell location!",UNK
4888,If I have to shop there I do it in the morning before it is over ran with other shoppers. It is still better than the Fry's on Reems and Bell. I need a drink before I go there.,UNK
4889,It was alright but I've had better!,UNK
4890,Where are you?!?!\nWe went to eat there and the restaurant was gone!,UNK
4891,"Honestly not the best. I ordered the beef rice, shrimp and garlic chicken. The only item I liked was the rice. The shrimp had more vegetables then shrimp. There wasn't that much garlic chicken. The hot and spicy soup was atrocious.  Very disappointed with the food.",UNK
4892,"Didn't seem to want to help me.. Pretty nice selection though, maybe they had something that would have worked. Oh well... there are other jewelers in town.",UNK
4893,It is over priced..\nStaffs are not friendly and all foods are salty as typical buffet restaurant.\nThe Makino provides much better service and food.\nVery dissapointed....,UNK
4894,"This place has gone downhill over the past year or so.  I was really disappointed with the service and quality of the food.  I would rather go to BWW for good wings.  Waited forever for beer.  Used to be a great after work stop, now not so much.",UNK
4895,"Ok, I didn't like this place, but my husband did.  So, split vote!",UNK
4896,"Completely remodeled inside in the last few weeks. Still has the odd way that you have to line up to order, and the same staff. It just looks newer/cleaner.\n\nAnd its still just Subway.",UNK
4897,"Average food... Below average atmosphere.\nThe server had a spanish soap opera on the loud TV... Totally trashy.\nI would NOT recommend this place, so MANY other Mexican food options... lame-o.",UNK
4898,"Scenery nice, food meh.",UNK
4899,Not impressed with our Togo order. Looked like it was slapped together. The cheese fries looked like they had no cheese on them. Also we did not receive a receipt after paying.,UNK
4900,"Beautiful place, very expensive and they duped me on my lease. Pleasant at first but then it went downhill.",UNK
4901,If you don't have kids stay away! If you do have kids what are you doing in Las Vegas? I hate all the smoking indoors. Couldn't find any quality food at the hotel.,UNK
4902,It was fine. The food was OK but I've certainly had better and fresher Thai food elsewhere. I would not go back.,UNK
4903,Foul tasting chicken. I don't know what else could make me so sad.,UNK
4904,Expensive and unworthy. Employers are unfriendly and disrespectful so no tips for them!!\nThe owner gave me the cold shoulder treat me like shit when I complaint about their service.,UNK
4905,"The clothes are cute-but vastly overpriced. Unless you are a typical size four,or have never had children, you're out of luck. The staff are rude and unfriendly.... consistently. No one smiles in here. A big downer.",UNK
4906,"Boring! The music was so loud your brain vibrated. The guys couldn't dance, amateurs and not good looking! The pranks were old and the show stale.",UNK
4907,It's Subway...tastes the same everywhere you go...at least this place is next to my gym and they get you in and out really quick! nuff said!,UNK
4908,Caprese sandwich not what I expected the bun should have been toasted it was just lacking flavor.,UNK
4909,Nice looking place ... food wasn't bad ... just something I didn't like ... not sure what ... sorry for the horrible review.,UNK
4910,Der Laden ist im Prinzip ganz ok.,UNK
4911,"The staff was nice and friendly but the weight time for the food was very slow. I ordered something simple, a chicken ceasar salad but the dressing seemed to contain a strong taste of vinegar. I enjoyed the music, played rock n' roll.",UNK
4912,Awesome view. Good food. But horrible service. The restaurant had no more than 7 tables sat. There was a ton of employees working and service was still slow.,UNK
4913,Hole in the wall,UNK
4914,The machines are worn out and old.  They really need to spend some money on new equipment. The free weight section Is fine though.,UNK
4915,This location is hit or miss.. Unfortunately it's usually a miss. There's not much to eat in this area.,UNK
4916,Service was very slow. Restaurant wasn't very clean. 2 people sitting in the lobby and lots of dirty tables.. One of the employees kids came in and took over the place crawling on everything and was very disruptive. The fool was awesome and the staff was friendly.,UNK
4917,"Went with friends to grab a few drinks and the place was dead, and for being 9pm i was a bit shocked.  The waitress never came around and most of us sad with an empty glass so we decided to just move on to another place!",UNK
4918,Bof ...,UNK
4919,I was not impressed. The pizza crust on the Margherita I ordered was soggy. I have had better at Pizzeria Bianco or Humble Pie.,UNK
4920,"Meh, it was ok but a bit expensive for a diner.  The wait staff was a bit aloof.",UNK
4921,Nothing special about this place. The food is ok and the service is slow. Not enough space between tables so its almost like your having dinner with the tables next to you.,UNK
4922,"Service has always been horrible for the past couple years, even when it used to be tea planet. The good boba never makes up for it and their slow staff.",UNK
4923,"We went here once because our usual Sunday place was crowded. My tacos were okay, but they completely screwed up my boyfriends order. Their margaritas were pretty substandard which was disappointing. Needless to say, we will not be returning.",UNK
4924,"Pizza is nothing special. Canned mushrooms, spinach, and shrimp. Sauce and cheese ordinary. We will not go back",UNK
4925,There were few parts that I liked but I wasn't so entertained in general. Hopefully the other shows are better,UNK
4926,Security line is extremely unpredictable. It may take 15 or 75 minutes to clear....,UNK
4927,"Good example of mediocre Vegas factory food. Service was great, but food was uninspiring. Free antipasta was best part, bread was plain and refined, olive oil was pale, anchovies were old, beer list weak.",UNK
4928,"Its located in food court area of Rivera, there r other good indian options on strip. I prefer tamba over this.",UNK
4929,"Good happy hour, but the food is lacking and expensive.",UNK
4930,All I had was a sandwich and a pretzel from here. Seems they could've done better on all of it. They have people working there that don't seem to care what they serve of how it's prepared. Really ad for a place right on the strip :(,UNK
4931,"In a word: forgettable. This is AZ, you can get better mexican fare on any corner. Largely bland and uncreative, food was just ok. Service was good, food was more than it was worth.",UNK
4932,Went for dinner with mother and uncle. All three meals where all right but not amazing. The quality to price ratio was off (too expensive). My meal was ordinary with meatballs that where dry and over cooked. Wine was good.,UNK
4933,Service was great but both my boyfriend and I ended up with a touch of food poisoning. I think it was from the chicken on a stick appetizer. We both ate that and it was the only common thing we ate. I will not be going back to the Pink Pepper:(,UNK
4934,Neat place to take kids for the atmosphere. But...it's really over priced for the quality if food and the amount of time the food took to come out. Food was bland and my pasta was cold by the time it got to the table. Service was ok I guess.,UNK
4935,"Lots of people to help but too busy talking to each other...so, I left...",UNK
4936,Back after a few months and they still can't get these Americanos right .   How hard is it?,UNK
4937,"The sandwiches are very good, but for whatever reason this location allways screws up my order! They forget to put it in or forget to call my name and it takes 25 min to get my food. That being said the encore is very good, just be prepared to wait a while",UNK
4938,"I don't want to be mean, but this place should be called \""Over-rated.\"" We waited an hour for what was a breakfast I could have done 100 times better at home. The food was SO BLAND and there was absolutely nothing special about it.",UNK
4939,It's okay... The rooms have been renovated with ikea furniture ... And it's kinda smelly like musty...not a favorite.,UNK
4940,"I would recommend you the potatoes soup or clam chowder they are awesome... services is ok, kind of slow during lunch time",UNK
4941,"I think I heard too much hype...it just wasn't good. Very bland biryani with little or no meat, subpar service, and slow food delivery. I prefer Priya...though the service is not good either...their dishes are delicious.",UNK
4942,"Great for kids, not suitable for adults.",UNK
4943,Good pizza for a decent price. The blueberry cheesecake was awesome.  Our service was terrible. A 45 minute meal took 90 minutes because our server never checked on us. We had to repeatedly ask for the check. Then we actually asked another server to process the payment because we never saw our server again.,UNK
4944,Still blah after all this time.,UNK
4945,"I can't even guys, I mean really.  There were people huddled around the front door smoking.  The service was slow, they give these thin little slices of bread when you pay for extra bread and get a COLD lil tiny slice.",UNK
4946,"Nice sales on designer clothing sometimes. But staff can be hit or miss. I like how the store is organized by color, but some of the no-name brands are seriously overpriced here. Great stop for a last-minute-event-notice though.",UNK
4947,Should have went to pita jungle... Chicken tacos are pretty bland. The nachos were good but salty.,UNK
4948,Cool atmosphere. Drinks are quite high priced for being off the strip. ($4.00 for a canned Bud Light???)\nLower drink prices and this would get 4-5 stars...,UNK
4949,"Marquee, y u so pretentious?!",UNK
4950,I went back.\n\nAnd it still smells.,UNK
4951,I really do not understand why the reviews are so good.  The food was very mediocre and it smelled like old beer in the restaurant.  I do not recommend this place.,UNK
4952,Tried Biscuits again last week. They cannot make an egg over easy. The whites have to be cooked while the yolk is still runny. This is not rocket science.,UNK
4953,Store is never stocked. Always out of stock on items. The Walmart on Bell Road is much better. Always has what I need - all the time.,UNK
4954,"The Boston  clam chowder was good. The combination pan roast is one I will never order again. It did not taste fresh, it was not flavorful at all . I rather go back to the oyster bar at Palace Station. Service though was good.",UNK
4955,"Friendly staff, welcoming decor and nice atmosphere. \n\nHowever, I found it was very pricey as compared to the end result - I went for a gel mani/pedi and found it was very simplistic and disappointing, especially for $90.",UNK
4956,"The sushi pizza was okay, but all three rolls tasted like cucumber and rice...bland.  Expensive for such quality and small portions.",UNK
4957,"Unimpressed\n\nI you're looking for cheap.bland food this is your spot\n\nCame in for breakfast, probably won't be back",UNK
4958,"The chicken teriyaki was overcooked, overseasoned and very oily. The mongolian beef is okay for an airport food.",UNK
4959,When I'm hungry for Italian...\n\n... I see the Martorano's billboard and lose my appetite.,UNK
4960,Can I have more steak with this Fat!? Geez! It was a tiny steak with more fat and it will run you 16+ rip off never again.\n\nOnly good thing is the TVs with ESPN!,UNK
4961,"This club is pretty small, and rather interesting. \n\nBe sure to check out Midget night here!",UNK
4962,I'm flying United Express and my flights delayed.   Nothing new.  99% of the time during my three trips to Wisconsin ONLY one time my flight was on time.,UNK
4963,"Worst espresso I've had in years. Ordered a double, and it barely cornered the bottom of the cup. Very, very bitter. \n\nPurchased a kale salad to take on the flight; it was tasty and nutritious.",UNK
4964,Not enough soup for the tonkotsu and yes tonkotsu is all about the soup.  What is the point for marketing tonkotsu when stingy on soup.  Not recommended!!,UNK
4965,"flew in an out of international terminal or terminal 2. Very sub par, they need to finish the new international terminal very soon cause this one does not have much to offer accept a shorter wait for a cab.",UNK
4966,Server was polite. Food was marginal and took waaay too long to come out. Beer selection very limited. The only thing that kept a smile on my face was watching ppl fall off of the mechanical bull.,UNK
4967,Very hot!  Poor air conditioning.,UNK
4968,Not impressed. Good chance I won't be a repeat customer.,UNK
4969,One time I was there it took them about 15 minutes to just get someone to the cash register come on! I eventually just left.,UNK
4970,Room smelled like sweaty sneakers.....disgusting!!  Requested a room change and second room wasn't quite as smelly but still had an odor.  Will never stay here again!!,UNK
4971,"I'm not a fan of their cupcakes. There is way to much frosting on them. They do come in some fun flavors, but I mostly feel gross after eating one.",UNK
4972,"The drive through barista has been a bit surley when I have visited there.  Today the credit card receipt blew out their window and the barista only said \""lovely\"" and stomped away as if it was my fault?  They seemed a little rude.",UNK
4973,The food is absolutely average.  The service is not quite that good.  But it is one of those places that distributes buy one/get one style coupons.  If you have a coupon....what the heck.,UNK
4974,Food is barely average and going down hill fast. Service is not great but they try. But they might think of asking the waitress to shower once in a while. Gross.,UNK
4975,Came to this place cs I heard the wings were really good . I mean the food was great BUT the service was awful !! The waiters take forever to bring your food/refills . They forget everything & totally ignore you . HORRIBLE !!,UNK
4976,Wife likes it.  Bagels OK.  Service terrible.  Took 15 minutes to get 3 bagels.  Wife can go there but I won't be back.  Way too much competition for my $$ in this part of town for such lousy service.,UNK
4977,"Don't waste time eating here. Atmosphere is wonderful drinks are great! Food is horrible, no taste and overpriced. Get your money worth on good quality food like Longhorn.",UNK
4978,"- The service was friendly and prompt\n- The guacamole was better than what I had at the downtown location\n- The posole was much worse than the downtown location\n\nOverall, decent overpriced airport food if you have time.",UNK
4979,When you can't even get good service at the bar imagine how sitting in the dining room might have been. Actually the male bartender was so rude to a customer not sure I would ever go back!!! Good luck if you decide to try it.....,UNK
4980,Very poor service.  Orange chicken was just chicken nuggets with a little sauce that didn't taste like orange.  Way to much breaking. We took friends and all were very disappointed in quality.  We ate here when it first opened and it was better.  Sweet sour soup was OK someone said.,UNK
4981,I ordered a 17 dollar burger and asked for bacon.  When I'm paying 17 bucks I expect the order to be correct.  There was no bacon!  Where's the bacon?  Not on my burger.   Get it together people.,UNK
4982,Go at happy hour and enjoy some beer.  Skip the food unless you're really starved.  Go next door to Arby's for dinner.,UNK
4983,"I have been here 4 times. The first time was great! The wait staff was friendly and the wings were great. However, the three times after that I had horrible wait staff, was ignored by the manager, and the food was lacking at best.",UNK
4984,Not so good. They''ve expanded their dining area but the food is still mediocre at best for Thai food.  But then I'm spoiled I lived in Thailand for 8 months.,UNK
4985,"Rather boring dishes without a lot of flavor. Not terrible, but in a city full of great Mexican food there are better options.",UNK
4986,It's an OK place..\nThe buffet wasn't all that great\nThe steak place across from the buffet is delicious.\nOur room had a two inch space under the entrance door where we could hear all the noise in the hallway.,UNK
4987,"Nothing special. Kind of a half-assed attempt to some reason mix Italian with a diner. The food is just okay, nothing stands out at all that would distinguish it from anywhere else. You can find better around here, especially for the price.",UNK
4988,Food was good. Girl taking order didn't pay attention to order and screwed it up. Cook yelled at her. \nFire that chick and it will be a 4,UNK
4989,"It's overpriced and cheesy, but still worth at least a quick look.",UNK
4990,"Surprised this place garners such positive reviews. Went for salad greens or seasonal anything and ended up empty handed. A long line of people checking out had bags of ??  It is a lovely spot and quirky but I expected to buy farm fresh anything, not a latte.",UNK
4991,Broth n ramen was not bad but the charsiew aka pork was a disappointment. They were too tough n didnt give us the shiok feeling biting it. We didnt even finish the meat. Chickenkaraga was not authentic enough.,UNK
4992,I had the two meat combo with beans and slaw.  The brisket was dry and the hot links weren't.  They did have never-ending pickles and soda.  I'll stay with Famous Daves or John Mull's.,UNK
4993,Staff was unimpressive. They didn't have pancakes or waffles because they were out of batter. \nI saw the good reviews here and relied on them for a good bfast. Wouldn't eat here again.,UNK
4994,A fun place to go to try something new. The restaurant itself is cute and an experience in itself. The flavors were a little bland for my taste though.,UNK
4995,Beautiful place. Just wish the taste of the food matched the decor.,UNK
4996,I have been here before and always enjoyed the coffee.  Today went with some friends and we all made a comment about the bad attitude of the staff.  The girl at the register was rude.  I do not think I will be going back anytime soon.,UNK
4997,Do not eat here on cheap wing nights (Tuesdays and Thursdays). I've come to realize that both the service and the food are terrible on these days.,UNK
4998,Very poor customer service experience... but... what else can you expect?,UNK
4999,"Disappointed in quality of overall meal - the meats and breads were OK.  The pierogies were NOT good, too doughy and greasy.",UNK
