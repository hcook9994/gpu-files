0,Huge gender imbalance and rude staff.,1
1,Didn't come here to eat just drink but can't really go wrong with 2.50 coronas this is definitely is a college bar and a bit noisy what's wierd is there Oregon duck fans and not ASU fans? Great place for day drinking though,3
2,"Nova's is great  if you get their fresh bread.  I particularly like their Focaccia\nand their savory scones.\n\nAs far as sweet treats, I love their gingerbread cookies around the holidays.",4
3,"I got coconut shaved ice with condensed milk and pineapples and it was pretty yummy. The portions are pretty big, I ordered the smallest one and had to share. Great price for how much I get.",5
4,Very nice octogenarian who was wholly unable to correctly prescribe new glasses. \n\nI would not recommend this business.   I gave him two stars because he is a very nice gentleman.,2
5,This place is run horribly. It was out of cheddar and steak for Philly sandwiches.,1
6,Very impressed with the practical advice that Island Life uses and advises by. First choice in maintenance and service recommendations.,5
7,"awesome tacos on the cheap...killer weekday lunch spot. Fish tacos and shrimp tacos. Give it a try, its GOOD!",5
8,"There were pop rocks in my \""popping spicy crab roll\"" it literally popped in my mouth.  POP ROCKS really! Sushi chefs everywhere are embarassed. \n\n'Nuff said.",2
9,"I think they are closed. Phone's been disconnected for months. Very sad, loved eating here.",4
10,Took a longer/more expensive route to save 2 minutes and then took 8 minutes to get change from other cab drivers.,2
11,"One of the worst hotels I stayed in anywhere.  During my spring training visit earlier this year, almost every day I had trouble with the door key cards.  Very poor decor also.",1
12,Excellent! Can't say enough good stuff about this place. The BBQ sauce is incredible and the Brisket falls apart and is so moist. This is my new favorite place.,5
13,My life would be incomplete without this place. My husband and i go weekly in the summer for tacos. The grocery store is great for specialty items for a decent price that you would otherwise pay much more for in a larger grocery store.,5
14,"first impressions were definitely cool, calm and collective. good vibes and a great atmosphere.  the pinot noir wine was very smooth bodied and full flavored. visiting from Sierra Vista I never heard of this place. Pizza is great! I recommend all to try it.",5
15,Absolutely in credible I recommend this place to anyone!!!,5
16,"Best Thai Basil Beef Stir-Fry, bar none.",4
17,"Major disappointment. Chewy calamari that tasted like it was sitting around all day and a soggy pizza. Prices are way too high, quality way too low.",2
18,Bought my engagement ring here. The sales woman was very polite and a true professional. She kept me within my budget and helped us find a beautiful ring. Also the application for credit was quick and discreet. I definitely would make another big purchase here.,5

20,a great fried fish that I've been tried for a long time! Worth to try for sure!,4
21,Judy Moore and her team offer beautiful and affordable jewelry. They are experts in the jewelry world and can guide you to the perfect gift for a loved one or yourself. I highly recommend them!,5
22,"Well made Sandwiches, I love their bread.",4
23,Great food and atmosphere and the Watermelon Zipperita is awesome,5
24,This place gets an extra star only because it is where I met my significant other.. . otherwise stay away.,2
25,Great salad bar. Service was excellent. My plate was never empty. My only issue is that the meat (to me anyway) was seasoned with to much salt. This would probably keep me from returning.,3
26,Service here was amazing. Ask for Tammy!,5
27,"I'm always down for Olive Garden! The food at this location is always good, however, as stated in other reviews, the wait can be kind of long. Sometimes you get a good server and sometimes you don't.",3
28,Food is ok. Service is horrible. 3x here and waitress and overall service makes me not want to come back. \nThe fact that they are busy should not affect  ... HOSPITALITY !!!,1
29,"Good sports bar. Great service, decent food, and open til 2am!",4
30,As long as I remember to bring cash this place is stellar. And now that they started serving food I'll be here all the time. Baked eggs? Uhh yes please!  Love it. Another score for Matt and family. :),5
31,Dr. Philips is amazing. I like the way he interacted with my son and with us to help us understand the problem with my kid.,4
32,"Perfectly aged and cooked steak! Great date night place ( hoping that my date next time will be be a gentleman. ..) but hey, at least I enjoyed my dinner!\nLove the lobster mashed potatoes :)",5
33,"real chinese food, excellent price",4
34,Pass! One of the most tasteless burgers I've eaten. Overpriced for what I received. I've had better at fast food. Not worth it.,1
35,"This review is for the Mad Greek Primm, NV \""stateline\""\nFood is ok, not great or craving to come back. Every table had a bottle of tapatio on it, this should be a clear message they are not serious about Greek food.",2
36,sage fried chicken and waffles.\n\nthere is bacon INSIDE the waffles.\n\nheart attack.\n\ni die.,4
37,four stars cos the beer is pricey BUT FIVE STARS COS THE BEER IS SO DELICOUS!,5
38,This place is amazing great food great service nothing else to be said.,5
39,"Fast checkout surprised to see that there wasn't many shoppers, place was nice and neat had a weird guy look at me kinda scared lol bt other dan dat it was ok. Nothing wow or bad either jst neutral.",3
40,"Brings me lots luck here, specially the 777 slot machines...  :-)",4
41,great waffles great service nice atmosphere great prices,5
42,Average selection and service. I go because they carry liquid seaweed. Nothing special to report,3
43,"The Poppin rolls were AWESOME! This place is way better than The Sushi Room, I think it is re-invented, but, they did it....so much better.  I highly recommend.",4
44,"Awesome breakfast spot!  In from out of town. Service great, food for kids, wife and me!",5
45,Has an awesome selection of different types of meat. Price is great. The seasonings are fresh and you could actually smell the fruit!,4
46,All doctors and staff are great! We see Dr. Levin normally and he takes the time to sit down with you and explain everything. You never feel rushed and I have never waited more than five minutes to be seen even on a same day sick visit.,5
47,"Gisoo and Vaneeza were a pleasant surprise. Great color and style/haircut. They listen to what you want. Super clean salon, very friendly staff. Glad I found them. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed. Massaging shampoo felt relaxing.",5
48,Great food bad service.  Gets really busy fast and not much parking.,4
49,Meh.. Breakfast Service seemed to be angry at each other or something. Got the job done. Prices high plating is nice but food was cool. Had the Huevos Rancheros.,2
50,"Cupcake pops were too moist, didn't like the outside either..they were too cold.\n\nThe cupcake I had was just ok, nothing great.",3
51,Really great place! Love how my hair looks every time. She's such a talent!,4
52,"Pizza was oily, caesar was too garlicky and prices are a little too high for me.\nThe bar embience was good but they need a happy hours or specials. \nMight try again in a few months.",2
53,"basic food, nothing special, but all tasted good.  Limited menu, funny wine selection, no multipuciano, or other usual italian wines.  Just the popular basics.  Right next to Goodwill, but better than you'd expect",3
54,"Unpleasant, inexperienced, and unwilling to help.... Don't take your animals here one groomer was severely hurting one of the dogs being groomed.",1
55,"Every time I go into this store I feel very uncomfortable! The security guard followed me around the store peeking at me from behind aisles! Not so slick, and very annoying!",2
56,Can't speak to the quality of service as I've been sitting here waiting more than a half hour for my first appointment.,1
57,We went back recently for lunch. It was terrible. The cold dish ( black ears) already went bad and they still served it. The fruit was not refresh either. Not sure what happened since we visited last time. It was the worst buffet experience that we had ever.,1
58,Food taste and quality are good but the price is high for the quantity of food they serve.,3
59,Just not my kind of place. There really wasn't anything in particular that stood out that was horrible. It lends itself to a younger crowd.  It never seems that clean. It has decent drink specials. During large events it will become incredibly packed.,2
60,I heard so much though the years about this place that I had to try (especially that it was a 5 minute walk for me). This is a fine bistro but it helps it to be located where there is not too much competition.,3
61,Typical Bloomfield dive bar. Typical Pittsburgh Dive bar. Nothing wrong with that. Saw a band here one night on my only visit. Great acoustics for an old building. Nice prices in beer and well brands. Parking's a bear on the weekends.,2
62,"My wife & I went this buffet restaurant for lunch recently. In our opinion, we sampled many dishes, including the Mongolian Barbecue & also the sushi.  All dishes are average.  The waitress was friendly.",3
63,"Excellent broth for the raman I'm highly recommend it. The meat is very tender, the noodles has just enough tenderness and chewiness to it.",4
64,Pizza crust & toppings are excellent. However the pizza sauce was too salty. I'm willing to try again later.,3
65,Love the variety of items!,5
66,"Love the concept of a drive thru salad joint. The thought and care that went into designing it was obvious. After a few trips though, I found that even after adding protein to my salads I just wasn't satisfied. The food is quality and the staff friendly and the menu is great.",3
67,Went for lunch and service is good and sushi rolls very good. Try the heart attack app...very yummy.,4
68,Great value. Terrible casino but nice clean rooms. Internet is 14 bucks for 24 hours.,3
69,excellent breakfast... great bacon sold here!,3
70,We sat down and waited for five minutes only to be completely ignored. Only one other table was seated so they weren't busy. We finally walked out. We won't be back. If I could give it half a star I would.,1
71,"Good food, fun menu, and pretty good service. No real complaints here...it gets hectic when its busy...but the employees make up for it in kindness and competence :)",4
72,"Cute, 50's-esqe (as currently manufactured in China) mid-century modern space. Interesting and inventive pancakes. Pineapple upside down cake was excellent, sweet potato didn't quite work.  Not too pricey for a breakfast place.  Will try again.",4
73,"Hands down worst experience ever! Our waiter was just lost. We asked for our checks early to avoid having any issues but still took over 45 minutes. Then a manager got involved and was even more lost and rude about the whole situation, extremely unprofessional.",1
74,Cool\n\ndramatic and entertaining for a family outting.,3
75,"The guy behind the counter was friendly enough. The cupcakes were very small. They should take coffee out of the name, I felt as though I was drinking the complimentary coffee at a Motel 6.",1
76,"Though the seating is tight and service can be a little iffy, the food is awesome!",4
77,"This is a favorite spot for me and my friends. Good service and good food. I wish the bathroom was a littler cleaner, but that's my only complaint.",4
78,Reliable.  'Nuff said.,3
79,Good for price.,2
80,"Oops, wrong location!",1
81,It is what it is. Needs some fine tuning but it's nothing special one way or the other. It is better than McD's.,2
82,"They always close down the meat counter & salad bar way before they need to. And the \""fresh\"" fish is bs. I don't understand why anyone would put rotting fish in the case.",1
83,"There are several clinics from all over the places. But I think this is one of the best I've seen. You can feel the warm heart of every employee working in here, so that the patient will get more comfortable. Good job!",3
84,"Mario, you've done it again.  Not the best, but this is a good one.",3
85,Good destination for pizza. Would frequently go there for a slice at lunch when I worked in the area. Nice New York style pizza with a crisp crust.,3
86,"No class. Food OK at best. Service , negative. Requested a new waiter immediately. Don't bother",2
87,"the room is dirty especially the bed which has bread crumb. i guess they didnt clean the room when we check in. the room is small. compare palm place to other hotel, this is the worst.",1
88,Decent dog. Rolls were nicely steamed and they have a decent mayo topping. Good hangover food.,3
89,"No public WiFi, and wireless broadband service is terrible. I usually don't care about this at a ballgame, but during a weather delay it was frustrating.",2
90,Worst and smelliest sushi I have ever had in my life! We were a party of 9 and ordered just about every kind of roll and sashimi they had and didn't like one thing.,1
91,Went here for luch today to try something new. The food is rotton. The juice is warm. No wonder it was so cheap.,1
92,This bar was irritatingly upsetting. No happy hour. NO DRINK menu. and ONE cocktail drink cost me $8.,1
93,"The service was quite bad here. Our waiter did his best to facilitate what had to be the WORST kitchen turn around I have ever seen. The order took 30 minutes to serve, very sad when consider that I ordered rare steak on an empty night.",1
94,"Really so so with that price range. However, we enjoy the view that we can see people enjoy sun tanning and swimming. However, the bread pudding was pretty good there. Worth to try",2
95,"The worst ,sugar free will give you stomach cramps unbelievable. I order four for Thanksgivings and all were a disappointment",1
96,There's a lady named Mari who's too unfriendly for  customer service that has worked the past couple of times we have eaten here.,2
97,"I don't get it. \nIt's just a regular burger, regular fries and regular cheese curds. \nCompletely regular.",2
98,Food is mediochre at best. Service is slow even by geologic time. The micro brew is typical and unimaginitive. On the good side the patio is dog friendly. One star just for that.,2
99,Not the best Thai food I have had. I found it very bland and too greasy. It seemed to be more about the chili than thai spice.,2
