462,Awesome instructors and classes. I highly recommend them to anyone who is looking for dance classes for their students. They offer high quality classes and never discriminate between competition and recreational students (this is not true of all dance schools). Every student receives the same high quality education.,UNK

488,Great stay and amenities.  Biggest annoyance was long lines for check in and if you wanted to check out and get a print out long lines.  Hire people that will expedite exit and entrance would be my only comment...then it would have been a perfect stay.,UNK

649,"Just to let you know, the owner of the restaurant contacted me after she read my review and told me I complain too much.",UNK
650,I have since found out that Bob Evans sold this off and they have gone to a more French menu.  This explains the reduction of choices.  I am not impressed and will likely never go to Mimi's again unless there is a change in the menu.,UNK
651,Great little shop that provided pretty good service. They do quick work and everything works again.,UNK

665,"Irene is, quite simply, the world's most talented and responsible alterations seamstress.",UNK

667,Food is amazing.,UNK

677,I'm happy to see that this place has closed down!,UNK
678,"This place was pretty good, although I wasn't feeling that great during or after, but I don't think it was due to the food.  Too bad because I could have really torn through quite a bit of this stuff.  Lamb chops were excellent.  Hand made sushi as well, nice!",UNK
679,Good little restaurant! hashbrowns are really good. Bacon was under-cooked. Waffles looked amazing.,UNK
680,"Fun sushi place with modern decor.  The all-you-can-eat includes everything on the menu which is awesome (includes apps and deserts!).  Watch out for rolls with banana and creamy sauces, as they are super rich and can fill you up too quickly.",UNK

692,"Love this place. The sizes are a good price('small' is great for two people) and the lady was so kind. You can mix in candy bars, ice cream sprinkles, brownies, or even pie fillings. Hot drinks and boba are available too.",UNK
693,Don't waste your time. Equipment is not well maintained and there hasn't been a working scale for months. I advised them on these matters and they did nothing. I joined 24 hour fitness instead.,UNK
694,"Had a lot of fun!  nice club.  but yes, extremely crowded, getting drinks became an issue, but what can you expect?  Came to have fun, and I did.  Wasn't anything amazing, but fun~",UNK

708,Meatmarket for the 30-something crowd.  In all the bad ways.,UNK
709,"If you want to go to a fast food restaurant to be ignored, then this is the place.  The employees go out of there way to ignore anyone who might be in line.  Only when there is a line of 5 people do they slither to the counter.  Horrible business.",UNK

715,Their chocolate mint and strawberry flavors are my favorites!\n\nBring a camera--this place has plenty of photo ops!,UNK

797,Sushi catcher is an above average sushi place the fish and ingredients could be a little fresher but that doesn't hinder the experience you'll have. It's a pretty small seating place but the staff is very friendly and attentive. Give it a try!,UNK

808,"Food was great. The staff was very friendly. However, the service could be better. This is the best kosher place in Vegas though...",UNK

811,Poor food with below average service! What could be better? \n\nIf you are waiting for someone at the airport and looking to eat do yourself a favor and go to the Paradise Bakery across the hall.,UNK
812,The beans are bland as cardboard. The onions were uncooked and the salsa was not pica. I recommend taco bell over this place. However the cochata was delicious. Maybe they should rethink their mission and vision.,UNK
813,Saki flowing. Place rocks. Most places fried rice is bland but there's was good. PS. I'm drunk off saki bombers.,UNK

818,My wife and I were both sick to our stomachs after eating here.,UNK
819,I went back here again last night .  I ordered the catfish dinner and got two hand breaded fillets of fresh catfish that was perfectly seasoned and absolutely delicious. It was served with fries and only $8.99. It was the best fried fish I have had in a long time!,UNK

828,$20 minimum on delivery. Way too high when considering other delivery options in the area. (In a college town. lol),UNK
829,We got to sample some of Belinda's pickles at the Phoenix Public Farmer's Market.  They have a terrific crunch - unlike any I've had before - in 2 flavors.  They were so good we had to buy some to take back to California!,UNK
830,Just got done doing this. Our tour guide was Jerry. He was incredibly informative. \n\nThis is the best way to do the hoover dam. I have been before and learned so many new things this time around. \n\nDefinitely use these guys!,UNK

845,I enjoyed the new drink infusions and the server was a hottie!  Great for people watching.,UNK
846,Pharmacy is entirely too slow.   This is a busy place.  Either need faster workers or more of them,UNK
847,"Great place! I loved the intimate atmosphere, not like your big salons on the strip but you get the same quality. Prices are reasonable. I had a shampoo and blow out from Misty and have already scheduled an appointment for color.",UNK

852,Die Bedienung war sehr nett. Der Cocktail und die burger waren lecker und die Vorspeise war klasse.,UNK
853,This review is for Oscar behind the bar.  He is simply the best and hardest working bartender I have ever seen and believe me I've been in plenty of bars.,UNK
854,Another burger joint of the week place. OK so I get it. Good burger and I do not like soft fries anywhere so I will not comment on the fries. Interesting taste in the burgers. Very popular niche type place. Again it will satisfy the occasional craving.,UNK
855,Really good food. I had mutton biriyani and tandoori chicken. Both were in sufficient quantities and reasonably priced.  Chicken was really soft and easy to digest in tandoori.  Will definitely be back to this place and try out their other delicacies,UNK
856,Oodles and oodles of history right at your fingertips.  The grounds are lovely the house is amazing and there is just so much to do and see here historically.  I'm no stranger to Scottish royal houses but this one is lovely!,UNK
857,This place is a little over rated / pricey. The waiter was awkward n touched me on my shoulder which made me feel uncomfortable.,UNK
858,Love this place. They have unique desserts here considering they have a candy shop within the restaurant as well. Candy bakes pizza to amazing milkshakes. Defiantly a spot to hit up.,UNK
859,Not my favorite.  I didn't like the style of bringing the meat to the table.,UNK
860,"I have a dozen maintenance requests. None get any response. When I call about it, they send a guy that doesn't know what to do. I'm moving out. I've had it. Beware of this place, it's a hell hole!",UNK
861,$4 for a cup of coffee?   Damn worth it.   So damn good.,UNK

877,"Love this place! Great food, great service, great atmosphere! Mmm table bread, Mountain Dew, & Caesar Salads!!",UNK
878,Nothing for the non farm eater. The veggie sandwich they do serve is too salty to taste anything else. Service was friendly and quick though.,UNK
879,Completely lame.,UNK
880,"By far the best Irish Pub in the area!\n\nThe food is delicious, standard Irish fare.  Great whiskey selection, and the expected Irish beer selection as well.\n\nPLUS- Every Friday night, The Paper Snowmen play, and they rock.",UNK
881,Bobby needs to heed his own criticisms.  The burger had no flavor.  Hint: season the meat!    I know why they have burger sauce on the table.  The service was good and the fries were great!,UNK
882,Went in to buy a reflective ankle strap and they were very helpful. They took the time to explain everything about strap including how they made them using old tubes from the store.,UNK

891,Soooooooo amazing & I'm in love!!!! ;),UNK

896,"One of the busier places in old town on Monday nights. I avoid Dollhouse on the weekends, but it's fun on Monday nights. I liked it better as crown room btw.",UNK
897,Good food but consistent poor service-nobody acts like they care-don't bother ordering online- it'll actually take you longer once you get there then if you went thru the service line-I'll drive further to avoid this location which is sad because we need good places in the neighborhood.,UNK

901,I love the pad thai it's so yummy and their thai iced tea is too bomb  the best thai food I ever tasted,UNK

926,"We ended up getting sick after eating at this \""restaurant\"". Only seems good as a bar. Service was on the slow side which you wouldn't expect for a Thursday.",UNK
927,Quality ingredients = good food. Chicken Francese is the bomb! ...Also sausage & peppers appetizer was really good. ...Cool location is directly across from Wynn.,UNK

1160,I know I'm not supposed to eat there but it's just SO good. All the beef dishes are amazing.,UNK

1182,"It's hard not to like the nostalgia of this place but the hostess is rude, the bartenders surely and the food mediocre. There are simply too many other choices.",UNK

1189,"Holy mother of God....this place is simply awesome. Beautiful people everywhere.  Drinks are great and the design/layout is incredible.  I must say, the Cosmopolitan is certainly a swanky-swanky place!",UNK

1191,I had a great experience. The woman working there was kind and patient. I will never use the post office again.,UNK

1193,"Live music, great bruschetta, great service",UNK
1194,if you're looking for customer service do not go to Bacchanal Buffet!  We hiked the maze to the buffet to show up at 10:01 only to be turned away.  Absolutely no compassion!,UNK
1195,Nice little hole in the wall. Everything was great. Even chatted up the boss a bit. Very nice guy.,UNK
1196,CG/Tania run a great scuba shop. Clean with the latest gear and great customer service. Their scuba socials and scuba labs are a great way to connect with other divers. Looking forward to a scuba trip with them soon,UNK

1199,I have been a loyal customer for over 3 years from this place and recently their food sux and their customer service is awful. Not only their prices are outrageous the cashiers don't know how to be polite and are very rude. We are done and they get a big F.,UNK

1203,This store has the most friendly and knowledgeable employees. This store also seems to have the largest selection of fish out of the 4 in my area. Our puppies love the bargain bin they always have toys just their size. Fun place to shop with your four legged kids!,UNK
1204,Not the best location for a Vegan but nice experience.  The rest of the group enjoyed themselves.,UNK
1205,0% financing is always good. But you can't go in this place without someone following you around so they can get a sale. Good selection of everything tho. Will always go back but might want to dress in camouflage to blend in and look in peace.,UNK
1206,Got food poisoning here yesterday--it was either from the lettuce or the shrimp dumpling,UNK
1207,The food was ok. My friends rave about it I thought it as ok. \nLots of TVs.\nService was forgetful and that's why I'm giving 3 not 4 stars.,UNK
1208,"I don't expect 5 star food or service from a place like this, but I have gotten better service and food from McDonalds. My visit included slow service from disinterested waitresses, and chewy, tough French fries and an ok burger. This place was awful.",UNK
1209,Had great service but the food was below par. Oysters were not cut off the shell and had to basically tear the oysters apart to get to them. There were 4 of us all together and none of us were satisfied.,UNK
1210,shit sandwich disgusting and huge line \nIf you like organic and healthuy walk away !!! insane that they are so successful maybe because of no competition around,UNK
1211,They gave me lemons for my fish tacos because they were out of limes. Other than that it was a decent Baja Fresh.,UNK
1212,"My Favorite Dive in the Valley. Maria (pronounced Mahr-eya) is the best bartender around. I've been coming to the H&H for years. The food is ok, the drinks are strong and it's a come-as-you-are kind of place.",UNK
1213,"Nicest shop ive seen in the valley, great selection of juice and hardware, friendly staff.",UNK
1214,Everything was amazing except the price.,UNK
1215,Better than average Asian food for a take-out restaurant. Get their crab angels though. DELICIOUS!,UNK

1217,"Great atmosphere, friendly welcoming service and most important the food it is delicious!!! I highly recommend it, specially if you are like me, from out of town. Great experience!!!",UNK
1218,"I really loved this place. I'm afraid it will probably offend some Pittsburgh residents as the portions are rather small relative to the prices. However, really really good sushi is expensive. This is some of the best sashimi I've had in Pittsburgh.",UNK
1219,"The drinks are good, and service is spot on when the place isn't super crowded. The music can be hit or miss. Sometimes it's awesome, and sometimes not. All in all an okay place.",UNK
1220,"Great food,  very satisfying and in ample portions.  Nice unusual interior design.  Free wifi. What else can you desire?",UNK
1221,"What a relaxing place to have coffee or hot chocolate. The coffee tastes great, and Ted & Maria make an awesome latte. The garden at Harper's Nursery is always beautiful, and it's like a little nature getaway in the middle of the city. Highly recommend it!",UNK
1222,Jersey Mikes subs are the bomb! Club sub is my favorite. One of the few sandwich joints that uses crisp warm bacon. Unlike Jimmy Johns which uses cold limp bacon. Make sure to get the red pepper relish. Frickin delish!,UNK
1223,Ice cream between fresh baked cookies is just as delicious as it sounds. Super delicious.,UNK
1224,Definitely a trendy place to go and I must say the Best Late I have ever had. Home made caramel and great roasted beans from counter culture. Can't go wrong here.,UNK
1225,Terrible customer service. The barista couldn't wait to finish helping so she could get back to her texting. She was moving quite slowly while making one drink with four customers in line waiting to be served.,UNK
1226,Went here for a friends birthday! It was pretty casual and a really cool place. They have awesome Jalapeno and Bacon Mac & Cheese! Their lattes were really great too!,UNK

1228,"We were walking around and saw this place, the place is kind of a hole in the wall with reasonable prices. \nFood was excellent but service was atrocious that day, I'd go again though since food was so tasty :)",UNK
1229,"Popped in quickly to literally grab milk and bread. Easy, pleasy. Everything was where it's supposed to be, it was well stocked, clean and easy to purchase. I would say \""I wish all HT's were like this,\"" but they are.",UNK

1231,"We had dinner in this restaurant . Everything was awesome! Customer service, food, life music and good Italian vine.I suggest you reserve table before coming. Very nice place!",UNK

1233,"Awful company to work for and worst childcare facility to bring your child too. The company owners are not capable of running a learning center. Take it from an employee, disappointed. Id like to apologize to all the parents who have enrolled and pulled their children out with confusion.",UNK
1234,"Hip atmosphere, eclectic mix of food. I had the cubanini and it was satisfying.  I want to try the sushi next time.",UNK
1235,This place is really nice.   Would definitely come back for a date night.  I would recommend splitting a meal.  Proportions are HUGE.  The BLD burger is awesesome but just tooo big.,UNK
1236,Great fast Asian food. Place was packed during lunch. Everything was fresh and flavorful. I like that combos are so cheap and cone with fresh potstickers.,UNK
1237,"I did not like this place at all. My husband & daughter also didn't like it. It's flavorless. It's like half assed American Mexican food at Salsarita's or QDoba prices. Trust me, just go to a QDoba.",UNK
1238,Woo Hoo!  Little Caesars opens in Fountain Hills!  Yummy pizza.,UNK
1239,This was a pleasant surprise! We really enjoyed the food but did let the manager know the service was sub par. Thomas absolutely made things right. No excuses! We will for sure be back!  That is the way to run a business.,UNK

1245,I had so much fan last Thursday for R3hab! I wish you guys didn't charge $40 for the lockers though :(,UNK
1246,Guardian is the alarm company I have at my new home. Justin Kissel from Guardian was very helpful with the process and educated my wife and I on what we should have in our home. \n\nWe sleep better at night now that Guardian is looking out for us. Thanks guys!,UNK
1247,This front desk was way too small for the volume of people that were coming in and out on a Thursday afternoon. I couldn't imagine it on a weekend or evening. The facility was clean and very relaxing once you got into the waiting area.,UNK
1248,"Need a quick and health lunch.  This market has a lot of great choices.  From hot bar salad bar,  pizza, sandwiches, sushi, Chinese food and much more.  Great alternative to fast food.",UNK

1251,Yeah it's close to everything but the rooms aresuper dirty. I would never sleep in this hotel again.,UNK

1254,"Love this place! Food is awesome and the ladies are so friendly! LOVE small businesses! Great atmosphere, great food, great decor, great all around!",UNK

1257,The spicy seafood noodles soup is perfect for cold night and it get better everytime.,UNK
1258,I have to say that today I had a great sandwich. It was much better than subway. It was an italian sub and it was delicious. Perhaps the night staff is more liberal with toppings and meat because this sandwitch was more appropriately filled. Good job!,UNK
1259,just simply put. stay away from this place!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,UNK
1260,"Jan came out to our house and was on time and very professional, we ordered 22 Shutters for our entire house. The shutters were installed within the time frame that we were promised and turned out wonderful. The entire experience has been very professional.",UNK
1261,Middle of the pack food with inflated prices thanks to its location. The margaritas tasted great but left us to ordering if they forgot to add the Tequila. I'd suggest sticking to the appetizers since they're more than big enough as a meal and relatively reasonably priced.,UNK
1262,Great service and excellent place to get breakfast. The eggs Benedict were made perfect! You won't be disappointed by their omelettes either,UNK
1263,They had lots of selections so I really didn't have to try everything. I liked most of the dishes I tried.,UNK
1264,This is absolutely the best pizza I've ever had. We ordered 2 different pizzas and the Stromboli. The Stromboli is out of this world!!,UNK
1265,"Pork BBQ sandwich was very good.  Two available sauces at the table, one vinegar based, one saucy...both were good.  Beer on the menu to include some local NoDa options.  Service was quick and friendly.",UNK
1266,"The food is good. But the served amount is too little compared to the price. And the soup is too salty. Please, go to other places for Chinese food.",UNK
1267,major disappointment this year with your christmas musioc.Its the same loops over and over. It used to be some fun and different variety but its the same loops over and and again - I found a different station,UNK
1268,the potatoes are off the chain.. a tad bit pricey for an egg sandwich out... but overall the place is good..,UNK
1269,"Great food, excellent service. Love sitting outside too when the weather is nice. A great go-to place in the neighborhood!",UNK
1270,"I have been back to this place several times since and have received acceptable service each time.  Perhaps it was an isolated experience the first time.  My co-worker who was treated rudely, however, has sworn not to return.",UNK
1271,"An excellent free museum. Varied displays, and great for kids and families. Equally great for escaping the elements outside. I can also say (from personal experience) that the upstairs cafe serves fine chocolate cake!",UNK
1272,"Over priced, just go to Chevron up the street if your worried about quality of gas..",UNK
1273,Suuuuper friendly staff got me in and out with an oil change in under 30 minutes! I walked in without an appointment but they took me right in. Very helpful and affordable prices are just a perk!  I absolutely recommend giving Hondatronics your business!,UNK
1274,"I take my six-year-old son here for his Mohawk cut. They do a great job, are always friendly and the wait is pretty short when you just walk-in. I've tried a few other shops in the Surprise area and this place is head and shoulders superior.",UNK

1278,"Horrible place, watered down rum and coke, rancid grease and nasty management. Chad the floor manager discriminated against my service animal by asking to see her vest and identification, illegal by state and federal laws. \""You! Sit at the back of the bus.\""",UNK
1279,OMG!!! the best place ever! cheap eats and bomb a** food. especially late night.,UNK
1280,Stopped in for lunch recently and had a great time as usual. The staff is friendly and helpful but also speedy so you can really get in and out for a lunch stop. Loved the specials that they have now- half salad and half pizza for 10 bucks is great. Thanks again Fate!,UNK

1284,"They hosted our Notre Dame game watch party - we had a wonderful time! Great people, great service and very good food!",UNK
1285,"If you go here, get a gift card from restaurant.com. They always have specials so you get 50%-70% off the cards. It ends up costing you $3 when you get a $25 gift card to this place. So worth it.",UNK
1286,Taste was great but evrrything wss a little greasy for my taste.,UNK
1287,Excellent fried fish! I love the option of picking your own fresh fish (large variety too!) and having it cleaned and fried to your liking on the spot! \nThe prices are great as well.,UNK
1288,"Gorgeous venue. Terrible comp policy. Why would you cut out all comps for low and mid-tier (dropping avg 10,000 per visit) players? Not so bright. This is why half their gaming revenue is lost.\n\nBoycott.",UNK
1289,"Gotta love the deals. We've gotten the steak and eggs and steak dinner which was $5-7, I forgot the deal, but I know it's cheap and good especially late at night.  I think the deal is only available after midnight? Must go!",UNK
1290,"Cute patio with nice misters, good food, and great service. I am a fan. Tried the mouth watering osso busco and petite chicken. The sweet rolls and butter were also delicious. Cute local restaurant.",UNK
1291,Delicious dinner...very slow service!,UNK
1292,"i can't believe i'm rating a paradise bakery, but this one is the worst. didn't realize mediocre sandwiches take 20 minutes to make. just don't bother, go someplace worth the  7 dollar sandwich.",UNK
1293,"The food is fantastic. It really isn't Chicago style in the slightest, but it is quite delicious. Calzone might be my favorite thing. \nI will say delivery times are a deal inconsistent.",UNK
1294,I eat there a few times until I realize that they wash there hands ONLY WITH WATER NO SOAP!!!  BEWARE,UNK
1295,There were at least 4 flavors of crawfish to get here. The sauce was good and it did not leave me sick with an upset stomach. The shrimp was yummy too. The mild flavor was lacking taste but that's no surprise.,UNK
1296,"service was perfect.  food was as good as it gets.  when you make a basic margherita pizza this good, you deserve 5 stars.  Beer list is amazing too.  You can not go wrong with this place at all.",UNK
1297,"So I usually have a good experience here. The chefs are very nice as they were today, but if you're not at the sushi bar the service is much slower when it comes to the sushi. Overall not bad, but could have been much better service.",UNK
1298,Excellent service!,UNK
1299,Best bar food on this side of town.,UNK

1302,"Good Food, Good Coffee.  And you can get a genuine ceramic mug, very civilized!",UNK
1303,"Excellent food. Warmly lit low light ambiance and good background music. Unfriendly hostess, but waitstaff was on point. Felt decadent to be there and we'll try it again.",UNK
1304,Do you work at Bally's?  Look at your physique...  This place is a nice place to relax and drinks are cheap.  It's just not that big of a pool.,UNK
1305,"I have to say this about the best pizza I have had to date. Compared to the rest of Vegas and the Wynn, the prices are pretty reasonable. I ordered two pizzas within 4 hours of each other and split a banana split while waiting for the second which was also tasty.",UNK
1306,"Our doggy Hercules thanks Luxe Pet Hotels for the care and excellent service!\n\nThe facilities are nice, staff considerate... Wouldn't hesitate to bring our dog here next time.",UNK

1309,If there is something I can say about the Bayside Buffet its STEAK TIPS. The steak tips are a must try! Also there is an auto pay system so no more long lines!,UNK

1312,"Never again... Way too expensive for being a hotdog joint. So not a \""Chicago\"" type food. Would be more accurate to advertise as being a Greek restaurant.",UNK
1313,I love this hotel. I stay here often when I come. Great service and vlose to everything.,UNK
1314,Islands is a great place for a quick burger. They have really good chicken sandwiches and salads. It is a great place for kids. They have a new kids menu that has a lot of healthy options. The desserts are pretty tasty too.,UNK
1315,Listen to the guy that said this place says one hour then it progressess. Horrible wait times. The guy was greasy and gave me chills. I felt like my car was being violated,UNK
1316,They carry a good selection of soy sauces and have decent prices for bulk rice. Do note that there is a $10 minimum on debit/credit card usage.,UNK
1317,I've always loved this place. Haven't been in a while but will check it out again at the end of December.,UNK
1318,Was excited to try the pizza.  I like the Chipotle idea of Italian! Love the pasta for a quick lunch. For what it was it was good. But Saturday at 2pm doors locked! Is it gone for good???,UNK
1319,"Very good NY style pizza. They have plenty more on the menu, but we usually stick to pizza and salad. I've eaten here many times and it is consistently good. The garlic knots are now free as an appetizer and they are a family favorite.",UNK
1320,"One of our favs for pizza!!!!! However, Renee was amazing as our Server!!!! Thank you Renee for making my evening with my Parents so enjoyable!!!!!",UNK
1321,"I gave this place a try because coworkers LOVED their chair massages.  I can see why.  I had the Hot Stone massage and I am extremely pleased.  They are super friendly, ask questions so they know what areas to concentrate on or avoid and did a great job.",UNK
1322,Excellent. Could not ask for better.,UNK
1323,"Good food, but does not live up to the name. It seems they would focus on the alcohol just as much as the food.",UNK
1324,Yuck!  Worst all you can eat sushi experience ever!  I recommend that you take your money and go elsewhere.,UNK
1325,A nice little location hidden in between apartments and some local businesses. The coffee here is pretty darn good and there a few treats too. I like that it never seems busy so no waiting around - dash in - dash out!,UNK
1326,I like it more for hanging out and having a pint.,UNK
1327,"this place is ok. some of the dishes are hit or miss. this is one of those places when you order 5 dishes, 3 are really good and 2 are ok.\n\ni may come back if i have a comp...",UNK
1328,"Great BBQ, Sauce is great, Cole slaw is good, no complaints for me. It's a BBQ shack, so anybody expecting frills will be greatly disappointed. It's all about the food and that is great.",UNK
1329,Not impressed!  N. Tatum was much better location.,UNK
1330,Amazing! Good quick service. Our waitress  Amanda was especially helpful. Thank you Kings Fish House for pissing us off and making us come here.,UNK
1331,"I am a huge fan of this place, great oysters, great steaks, great vibes, young hip crowd with a few richies mixed in.   5 star for the food, and service!",UNK
1332,"Great selection of casual authentic Cantonese food. The service was a little slow during lunch hour, and the food was a-ok. Overall a welcome addition to Las Vegas, and I look forward to trying out the many choices, especially the HK style desserts!",UNK
1333,Good food.. great drinks,UNK
1334,One drink got me drunk.  Five stars,UNK
1335,"Only been in one time and was really impressed. Great customer service, and a very clean environment. Angus burger was cooked to perfection and super juicy! My friend had the char dog and said it was amazing!  Will be back!!",UNK
1336,"Came here with the 4 for $40 deal where 4 people can share a family style pasta, salad and bread.  It's a pretty good deal, the catch is that none of the pasta dishes that you can choose from have meat, so it's pretty much a vegetarian meal.",UNK
1337,I found them to be very unprofessional.  I will not use them ever again.,UNK
1338,"5 days it takes this lethargic water company to turn our water on in our new home in Surprise!  If you do have to deal with their customer service reps, you will see the perfect example of a company with no standards.",UNK
1339,"I love the beer!\nI find the food to be also good, but nothing panty-droppingly good.",UNK
1340,"Great airport. Easy to navigate, good shops and decent food",UNK
1341,Went yesterday with a girlfriend... got 4 different cupcakes.  Yummy!  I highly recommend the chocolate marshmallow :),UNK
1342,"Nicely decorated interior, very friendly service, and excellent food.",UNK
1343,I was very impressed with the flavors served at Bobby's! I had the goat cheese burger with the sweet potato fries! I cannot wait to go back & I've been telling all my friends to go too!,UNK
1344,"Impressive! I like the seating in the back, the bar and bartenders are great, menu looked great, can't wait to try it sometime!",UNK
1345,"Eat at sushi bar, staff is friend and fun!",UNK
1346,"It had been a while since eating at El Bravo....and I am glad to put it back in my 'good places to eat' list.  Great food.  Go check it out.  Oh, and they make their tortillas in house!  Yumm!",UNK
1347,"Our favorite local Mexican restaurant. Good chips and salsa/bean dip! The chicken mole is the best in town! Great views of the strip too, go after dark to see all the lights on the strip! \nServers are friendly and attentive.",UNK
1348,"I used to be a pretty big fan of WF, but I just can't justify spending so much money at the grocery store.  Now I only go there if I need something I can't get anywhere else.  I like their vegan pizzas, though.",UNK
1349,Here is my blog on my experience with them. http://coulterinfinitiaz.blogspot.com/?m=1,UNK
1350,it would be nice if you updated your hours so i dont have to drive 20 minutes to find you closed an hour early.,UNK
1351,Nothing to write home about. I ate there tonight and was not impressed. Mostly locals with their hoochie mammas getting ready to go out on a Friday night. Not sure if it is even worth a second try...,UNK
1352,Old school pub in Tempe. I like the patio with Christmas lights and heaters. It is the last bar on that side of the road so cool views of Mission Palma Hotel and Hayden Butte mountain. The fish and chips are bomb. Good happy hour food prices.,UNK
1353,This is a great place for Korean. I took the kalbi while my wife had the bibbimbap which was quite nice. The food was really good and so was the service. Would definitely be going back.,UNK
1354,"Zipps is my favorite place to watch a game, get a beer especially during football season.\n\nI recommend the medium golden wings and a 32oz domestic.\n\nThey have the best happy hour and daily specials around.",UNK
1355,"A big, comfortable place which has a great decor. The food is great, good price and server fast. They even have a salsa bar so you don't have to wait to get more chips and salsa. Works well for a couple or 20.",UNK
1356,We love uncle bears...Its a nice local place to get some food and drinks! I love the blakened chicken sliders. They have great weekly specials and they have these trivia type games you can play on the tv. I would highly recommend this place!,UNK
1357,"Interesting pieces. Small store, might have what your looking for if basic is what you need.",UNK
1358,"Stopped in for lunch to have a quick bite.... Very impressed! Nice atmosphere, the staff was friendly and the food was GREAT at a good price! I had the chicken cream chop pita...would definitely recommend it!",UNK
1359,"The staff was friendly without being overbearing, the restaurant was very clean (even the high chairs were wiped down!), and the food was great!  Casual dining at its best!",UNK
1360,"Don't come here if you're in a hurry! Slow service, and food takes forever. The pizza itself wasn't horrible.",UNK
1361,We had a great time here. Liked the flight of 5 wines for $10.  Not the top wines around but what do you expect for the very reasonable prices.  Definitely thought the staff was extremely attentive and made it fun for us to hang out a few hours.,UNK
1362,"Great show (Odd Couple) last night!  Enjoyed it tremendously.  The cast was excellent and the service was excellent.  The quality of the food, however, is deteriorating.",UNK
1363,I just had the potato & cheese flautas. They're so satisfying. And the salsa roja & guacamole add great flavor. This little corner of Container Park es muy bien!,UNK
1364,Today my wife and I were completely ignored. Awesome business model.,UNK
1365,"Cheap, good Mexican- great if that's what you're craving! Chips/salsa and guac somewhat addicting. Great little spot!",UNK
1366,the first time they never put my antenna back on other than that they do a great job in and out in 20 minutes,UNK
1367,"Absolutely the best!  Dr. Drew is amazing.  I have tried other Joint locations, but sold here!  This is a great concept - in and out usually in about 10-15 minutes!",UNK
1368,Great place for a traditional American style and/or Filipino Style breakfast. The wait was reasonable. I recommend the red velvet pancakes.,UNK
1369,Bad service but the food was okay.,UNK
1370,I love this place! I've been eating here since I was a kid and it used to be D's Thai Food. I've never had a bad meal here!,UNK
1371,Pretty cool bar.  The drinks are good.  Some local beers on tap which is awesome a plus for me.  The food was good although I was disappointed they didn't have fried green tomatoes on the menu anymore.  The veggie burger was tasty though.,UNK
1372,Good place to come in the morning. Good Donuts and they will always make fresh coffee as needed.,UNK
1373,"Yummy for my tummy.. Very classy, delicious and fast. I called three days before my event for a last minute cake and they pulled through with a delicious beautiful product. Bravo",UNK
1374,"Likes-although there is no green tea match a , the papaya milk tea and Jasmine milk tea are powerful in taste and I even froze one to save for the next day. Dislike- minimum purchase with a debit card. Yuck!",UNK
1375,My girlfriend and I dined at this location last night and she got food poisoning. She was sick and miserable all night. Definitely the last time I will be eating here.,UNK
1376,Standard sushi for Phoenix.,UNK
1377,"1 angry hangover + 1 large, steaming bowl of fresh, made in small batches says the chef oatmeal + berries, granola, brown sugar and milk.. = less painful reality and happy food belly.",UNK
1378,Usually less busy at 8am than the other Starbucks locations in Spring Valley and the drive thru is open again! Free wifi as usual and lots of place to sit.,UNK
1379,I brought my 90 year old mother in to have her acrylic nails removed. Nancy began clipping roughly at them and she ripped off part of my mom's nail. She didn't care at all! Don't go there!,UNK
1380,This is a great Chipolte.  Perfect location---across the street from Fashion Square.  The staff is always helpful and friendly.  The food/toppings are always fresh and tasty!,UNK
1381,Not sure what everyone sees in these pies. Not worth the money.,UNK
1382,"Had the meatiest, unbelievably stuffed beef burrito ever here. Cheap too, although it was kind of greasy. Still good though, A-OK!",UNK
1383,This past weekend I had an excellent experience at Sandbar.  My two friends and I all enjoyed the happy hour prices available until 7 all weekend.  The food was delicious with reasonable prices. Our waitress was great and very helpful as this was our first visit to sandbar.  Fun atmosphere!  Would recommend to friends!,UNK
1384,"Just walked out on a $20 order,disgusting pigs. Use it to buy some gloves, and a food handlers course.",UNK
1385,State-of-the-art facility with a wide range of  high quality firearms. Been a member since the day they opened and train at least twice a week.  Great group of folks work there.,UNK
1386,Gross!,UNK
1387,LOUD! good spot for wine and appetizers,UNK
1388,"Love the grass fed beef, you can definitely taste the difference! The only reason I give them 4 stars instead of 5 is that they don't have fries, and the potato chips were ok but not worth 4 bucks. They should raise the price of the burger and include fries :)",UNK
1389,Fresh and tasty. No two dishes taste alike and they are always efficient getting orders together. I just wish they delivered!,UNK
1390,"Love our local Ace store! We come here for everything home and garden related. I love the American flags out front and the staff is always helpful. Plus, it feels better to support the little guy as opposed to going to Home Depot.",UNK
1391,"If you are wondering how many licks it takes, come here.  You have your choice of various candies, including tons of Jelly Bellies, and a great Hello Kitty section.   Additionally, there are adult-themed offerings, both edible & non, in the back.",UNK
1392,"Got the turkey burger and it was yummy. My friends said their burgers were cooked more than they wanted though. Still, food was good. Our server didn't check back often but I know typically they are more attentive because I've been to this location a few times",UNK
1393,"Food was great!  Service not so great...  When you're paying that much for a meal, the service should be just as good as the food.  Get the bananas foster for dessert, you won't be disappointed!",UNK
1394,"My new favorite. I'm a regular.\n\nVeg board, wine coolers, and Old Chub all day everyday.",UNK
1395,"Nice pleasant place, but the service not so much. The cashier seemed like she didn't want to be their and they got my order wrong. Unless you like ok food and shitty service highly recommend!",UNK
1396,"Really good, authentic colombian food as if your grandma made it :) alot of products from Colombia that you cannot find anywhere else.. Will be visiting again soon.",UNK
1397,"Great customer service. Got me in very quickly, which is always nice. Every customer that came in while I was there seemed to be handled the same way I was.",UNK
1398,Skip it. Unfriendly staff and food that is sub par. At least at the fast food spots you know what you're getting... They put cilantro on both our dishes too; on the fries and the chicken wings.,UNK
1399,Moon juice IPA  yum,UNK
1400,Great New York style pizza and great wings. Good deal and great people with a great sense of humor. You can tell they actually enjoy what they are doing. This has become a quick favoite of ours for takeout and even eat in.,UNK
1401,Boquerones and manchego mac and cheese were pretty good! Tres leches cake was also nice. Should have gone with the full pitcher of Sangria. Can't wait to try the paella next time.,UNK
1402,I love Brazilian steakhouses and this is the best I've been to. I preferred it to Fogo. Free meal for your birthday and it's a clear winner. Great service and great food. Picanha and lamb are my favorites. I'll be back.,UNK
1403,The place was clean.  The employees were friendly enough.  The ice cream was delicious.  My only complaint is that the guy mixing our ice cream thought it was ok to tell us that his job was annoying and the worst job he ever had and he hated it.   Like we really want to hear that.,UNK
1404,Yes! From our of town and looking for something local with an atmosphere. Decided I liked the menu.  No let down.  Ask for Cassie.... great and made sure we were very comfortable.  Food was great and great choices.   You won't be dissatisfied.,UNK
1405,3 out of 4 times I try to come here I end up leaving without buying anything. The drive through is a complete joke. The absolute slowest moving line I've ever experienced.,UNK
1406,Great place veyr helpful staff without being invasive or pushy. Stopped by on impulse and walked out with some new gear.  Spoke with a very helpful guy named Darren i belive.  Great selectiin and great prices.  Will definatly be back.  You guys rock,UNK
1407,This store has the worst customer service. They made us feel like we were bothering them. The sad part is that we were the only customers in the store. I will never go back to location again even though it's super close to my house.,UNK
1408,It's really good!!! \nEverything taste so fresh. People here are very kind. Definitely worth it!!!,UNK
1409,Very good food! Service was awesome. It is a bit loud though since you're right by the lobby.,UNK
1410,"Has a some chairs out front so you can socialize under the hot summer sun. The employees are exceptionally friendly, particularly in the early hours of the morning when I typically grab a drink. Expect it to be moderately busy due to the location.",UNK
1411,"Love watching the \""dance\"" of making the drinks.  Super fast service, huge selection.\nKeep wanting to branch out but end up getting the Tiramisu again and again.",UNK
1412,The service is so slow it's ridiculous.  It can take 20-30 minutes for a cup.  It's an okay product but the service is unbearable.,UNK
1413,"Stop here! This place is great lots of items, nicely displayed and clean. Friendly owner(I presume) great vibe. Even found a little treasure!",UNK
1414,"Pretty good place, and the price is good for all that you get. The staff is friendly and it is very relaxed.",UNK
1415,If you have nothing to really do and just want a basic lunch in a cozy environment I say go for it. I dont know what the pie is so humble about its not that great. With all the other choices for food in scottsdale I say look elsewhere for an interesting time.,UNK
1416,Took my friend here for his birthday and he had the best hair cut and shave he's ever had!   He now has a standing appointment every three weeks!  Thank you Elliot!,UNK
1417,I love this store because it promotes healthy sex and relationships as well. It's a very body/sex positive and pro-woman business (not what I would normally expect from an adult shop).,UNK
1418,"Pretty good Chinese food. After living in SF, I am somewhat of a snob when it comes to my Chinese, and so far this is the best I have had in the area. Very good potstickers!",UNK
1419,"I came to see it 1 last time before it closed and now I am glad it is closing. Rude workers , dirty everything,  and just not worth your time.",UNK
1420,The place looks great but the service is underwhelming. I also agree with the other posters. The high pressure sales has gotten old.  These people are worse than Wells Fargo tellers.,UNK
1421,"It was good. Loved the decor, menu had something on there for everyone. Wasn't knock your socks off amazing, but good enough that I'll be back.",UNK
1422,Holy Crap! If you want to die go to Banner Gateway Hospital....too much to explain but trust me you're better off going to some voo doo witch doctor or doing some home remedies before you should come to this place!,UNK
1423,"Always fun in the casino, the history of this place is so special it's hard not to have fun",UNK
1424,The Thai curry wings were good and very large but everything else was standard bar style food. Pullanos wings are better and worth the extra few miles to drive for.,UNK
1425,Never bad...consistent,UNK
1426,Great food and great concept!  I loved my meal and loved the ability to build my own pizza and have it ready in 2 mins.  I hope they open more locations!,UNK
1427,"Downtown's new Hot Spot! La Comida is Morton's newest restaurant, located on 6th and Freemont. Featuring traditional Mexican cuisine in a fun and hip environment, it is an absolute MUST try!",UNK
1428,This place is so amazing. Music was great (hip hop and house) and overlooks the entire strip. \nDrinks were cheap and the crowd is great looking. I wouldve given 5 stars is the promoter (Kevin angles) wouldn't have lied about getting in for free,UNK
1429,"Wouldn't want to stay here again. Rooms were smelly, old, and needed major redo. Luckily the beds weren't bad, but other than that, the place needs to remodel. \n\nYo Yo",UNK
1430,what happened to the bob???!!!!!!!,UNK
1431,DJ on fridays..good drinks nice crowd.,UNK
1432,"What a fun Irish Pub. Great food (Had breakfast the next morning). Great staff and a great band; not your typical Irish group. Beer and drink prices were reasonable, especially for the STRIP. Outstanding Irish coffee.",UNK
1433,It's by no means a Japanese restaurant. The only thing I think real is the instant miso soup. Don't ever order Sukiyaki Udon! I am so disappointed by it.,UNK
1434,Nice to have a quality pharmacy so close to downtown.  A much needed addition.,UNK
1435,"Randi and Next Door Realty deserve more than five stars! The quality of communication and care for my property is outstanding, and I feel so much better that, even though I'm in another state, Next Door cares about me and the tenants. Thank you!",UNK
1436,"Best sub shop in the Phoenix Metro Area. High quality food with very reasonable prices. The employees and owner are super friendly and personable, such a great place to bring family or friends.",UNK
1437,"Great service. Fun atmosphere. Amazing food for when you just want to pig out. The only problem is there's always a 45 minute wait no matter what day or time you go, so if you don't mind waiting it's a Vegas must see :)",UNK
1438,"Loved it,small intimate, food very good, desert nummy!",UNK
1439,"This is one of the best places to get pizza in Phoenix, there are only one or two others that I would buy a pizza from. I have been going there for years. And their sausage tastes just fine to me, at least there is enough to actually taste.",UNK
1440,Manque de service aux caisses ! Souvent plusieurs clients laissent leurs achats et s'en vont. Dommage puisque ce n'est pas le nombre d'employer qui manque,UNK
1441,"I always get the same thing, but my friends do get other stuff and they agree it is great. I get the chicken teriyaki bowl with breast meat. Not only is it delicious but it is so much food, we always have left overs.",UNK
1442,Would give it 0 stars if I could. Getto place with workers that don't give a damn about customer service! Never will go here or recommend to anyone that they waste any money on this place!,UNK
1443,I just came here for sodas and water. My last trip was disappointing due to the advertisement for certain products and prices not matching the ads. Its a nice store and easy access from 7th St or the lights on Bell but the parking can get hectic.,UNK
1444,BBQ Chicken Sandwich and Fry's with some spicy sauce.... what a way to top off a beautiful Friday!,UNK
1445,"Nothing to write home about.  Fancy noodle guy making the them from scratch. ....but the window dressing really didn't match or meet expectations.  In fact, a trip to Panda Express would have saved me $70 and we would have had a better meal.    Never again!",UNK
1446,It is good pizza.  The slice is huge for lunch.  Ordered the 24 Big Jimmy.  It gets soggy in the middle.  Stick with their regular size large.     More and more of these pizza companies are using the toaster conveyor to cook.  Im not a big fan of that.,UNK
1447,"Went there for craps and stuff, nothing fancy.  Just a regular casino with regular games.  It was a while ago and I don't remember what I actually did there, so that just shows you how regular and normal it was....",UNK
1448,Great food.  Killer desers.  Owner and staff are very nice.  Really good food. Nice interior.,UNK
1449,I had Juan at Snail Motorsports install my Eisenmann Race exhaust on my 2008 BMW M5.  He did a fantastic job and treated my car as if it was his own. He took great care of my baby.  I would highly recommend his shop!,UNK
1450,Had the nachos since nothing else appealed to me.  I have had better nacho cheese at a Football game.  Pretty bad.,UNK
1451,Very decent Mexican food =) \nLoved the shrimp and crab enchiladas.,UNK
1452,Any yelpers know where Sue is working now? She was amazing and she's left this place. I'll follow her if I know where to go?,UNK
1453,"Solid crepes, but not much selection on the menu. Definitely overpriced.\n\nNutella crepe is the best (without the bananas). Yum!",UNK
1454,The food is great... but the wait is long.,UNK
1455,"Only once. Never again. Although the food tasted great, I waited 45 min after my entire family finished their meals. The waitress even took their plates before I ate. When my dish finally arrived it took all of 10 seconds to finish. Smallest most expensive dinner I have ever had.",UNK
1456,By far the most family friendly environment I have seen in a dance studio.  The hard working lady at the front desk is absolutely amazing. If you are looking to take your kids to a great studio this is the place!!!!,UNK
1457,I'm a big fan of Guy and have always wanted to try his new restaurant in Vegas. The restaurant was a cool rustic style with a big bar in the middle. To be honest I didn't think the service was all that good but the food made up for it.,UNK
1458,"Friendly staff, great bar selection & awesome food. Prices are more then reasonable. Locals, discover this gem!",UNK
1459,Heaven for vegan . \nStay away from the meat. \nGreat desserts. \nTake the Turkish coffee.,UNK
1460,"A little unsatisfied with the selection but they did manage to have the steamer that I was looking for. Macy's is open until 11pm for the holidays, so if you desperately feel the urge to shop late, this is the place to be apparently.",UNK
1461,This place is awesome. Really great food ad they cater to customers like me with dietary restrictions. I will definitely be back :-),UNK
1462,"Good food, slow service and kind of pricey!",UNK
1463,"Always here for the Mint 400 race. Fits the needs with parking, service and great staff.",UNK
1464,"Great place, portions might be a tad to big for a breakfast place. Don't wanna feel disgusting the whole day, other than that really good food and service.",UNK
1465,"Just ordered my sub and asked for my hot peppers on the side.  Was told they couldn't and the reason is \""it's against company policy\"".  What?? They done me wrong and won't go back.",UNK
1466,Met up with my friend and her mom for some day time drinking. Was not disappointed with this place. Great beer selection and the poutine dish was perfect. Will absolutely be returning,UNK
1467,Get the green curry and don't look back. It's a strong move. I love how healthy this place can be and the food is not processed. I feel like this is how home cooking would be if my mom was Asian. A little expensive though.,UNK
1468,"I did not like mine, chinch on the toppings.",UNK
1469,"Love this target store; always clean, never too crowded, and love the brands and products they offer.",UNK
1470,"Since posting my review below, the office contacted me in writing stating that they can no longer see me as a patient. As if I would have ever tried to return there! This place is a joke.",UNK
1471,"This is where I take all friends and family visiting San Tan Valley, it has always been friendly, wonderful food and drinks. It is my too go place for sure.",UNK
1472,"The food was terrific, but there was only one server so the service was a bit slow. The dessert was also really good, but not the typical tiramisu I've had before. The gnocchi was perfect!",UNK
1473,"Good Bahn Mi. Not great, but good.",UNK
1474,Great food and friendly service. They just updated the menu and the Chicken Parm is on point.,UNK
1475,"I wish whole foods wouldn't be as expensive as it is, but then again you pay what you get. Here I mean organic food, clean establishment, helpful staff etc.",UNK
1476,This is by far the best Thai food around! Just had it for my first time yesterday. I'm so hooked. I ordered spicey beef noodle and had them add mint. Yummm,UNK
1477,"Awesome experience, I've only been there twice but I just moved across the street. I know I'll be in more often, they seem consistent.",UNK
1478,"Delicious.  Small portions (expected from this kind of restaurant).  Great service. Decent drinks. Tastebuds satisfied, but not the belly.",UNK
1479,I loved my huge roast beef/turkey sandwich. We split 3 ways and had leftovers. Would definitely visit again.,UNK
1480,"Food is good considering the price. I am addicted to the Sesame Balls! Staff is nice.\n\nThe steamed clams were seasoned well, sushi was fresh, the hot and sour soup was AWESOME!",UNK
1481,First time eating Filipino cuisine and the folks here made it an awesome experience. Great food @ a great price! We will be back.,UNK
1482,The entire staff was very helpful. We came with a group of 6 and all enjoyed ourselves and the service provided. James was our instructor and I am very glad he was. Make sure you ask for him! He is also very funny!,UNK
1483,Dinner with the Saunders Family,UNK
1484,"So good. Been there a bunch of times and Everything that I've ordered from here tasted awesome! I do however wanna try their desserts, they looks delicious but I'm usually too full to try them.",UNK
1485,Such a great show. They gave free Jell-O shots. It was very funny and sexy. Definitely a must watch.,UNK
1486,"College kids infatuated with Tommy Chong and the whole pot culture aren't the most discerning food enthusiasts.  This place fits them well.  For the rest of us, it is a decent sandwich in a very cramped space.",UNK
1487,Great lounge. Much better than United. Free well drinks and wine and a buffet meal is served - gratis. Cool vibe and layout. Only complaint is that it's too small. Place is always packed and hard to find a seat. Also has free wifi.,UNK
1488,Rio pool! No longer a hot spot free pool for local son the weekend. They started charging for pool entry a month ago for Friday - Sunday.  $20 per adult and $10 for children.  No wonder it's completely dead for a Saturday!,UNK
1489,Wonderful locally owned boutique. Carries great brands you can't find everywhere and amazing staff. Very quaint store. I highly recommend checking out Shop Pepper.,UNK
1490,I love potbellys but for the price the sandwiches are small. Back in Chicago the potbelly sandwiches are bigger? Or at least I don't ever remember them being that small?!?,UNK
1491,Great service quick and easy to order family place great food decent prices a must if around this area!,UNK
1492,Switched a $10 table to a $5 table for us but the Blackjack dealer was rusty and wasn't sure of her pay outs or bonus bets... Disappointing...,UNK

1540,All i have to say is this place is - Grrrrreat ! Very relaxing lounge and good place to eat after midnight .,UNK
1541,Pizza was crushed and all the cheese and toppings stuck to the box.  The driver didn't care.  The store didn't care.  Even wrote corporate and got no response.  Get your pizza some place else as they don't care about your business.,UNK
1542,"Very good. I always get the Spicy Korean Chicken and Kahlua Pig Combo. The portions are huge and the food is full of flavor. The bathroom was a bit on the gross side, and the dining room could use a cleaning",UNK

1581,"Great sandwiches, great service what more can you ask for.",UNK
1582,What a nice treat and affordable too. The ice is fluffy just like the snow back home up north. The flavors range from classic to contemporary. The owner is a great guy and has a LSU banner up despite the fact he is from ASU BUSTED.,UNK

1608,I stayed here for 3 nights just a week ago. The casino is old and smoky. But the room was very clean and looked good for the rate. I booked through expedia.com. The rate included free value slam breakfast at Denny's. So it was a good deal.,UNK

1612,We had the green curry with shrimp and the pad Thai both great flavors and perfect spice. Great service very helpful for one of our members who is glutton free. Good atmosphere as well. If you like Thai food this the place for you.,UNK
1613,"thoroughly impressed with the knowledge of the volunteers, the amazing animals and wide selection of products available. almost adopted either a pitbull pup named Andy and the older dalmation/bulldog mis Alice!",UNK
1614,I can only imagine that most of the 4-5 star reviews here were written by drunken-late-night vacationers staying at the Tuscany.  We had a poorly prepared breakfast with weak coffee and limited service - cannot recommend.,UNK

1622,Awful lunch I got a turkey and Swiss wrap that literally was tasteless.  I feel like I wasted 15 bucks on lunch.  I should have listened to the reviewers who said that past the desserts the food isn't good.,UNK
1623,Girl casino dealers can wear bikini tops....enough said. Our dealer was in training and even though we are 33 and 35 we were carded. That's fine I guess but the atmosphere is different and we lost money so not my favorite spot.,UNK
1624,"Been there several times, mainly for the the awesome bands they have there. The drinks are pretty decent and the wait staff to. I like the free popcorn also. I had eaten there only a couple times during lunch and wasn't really impressed. I've had better burgers else where.",UNK

1632,Never again. Massage was ok. Staff was really rude. Associate said because of special I was supposed to leave at least 20% tip. She called me cheap. Wth. Whats the point of having a special if im required to leave a certain amount for a tip. Never again.,UNK

1639,These guys are not fair with price..they markup the parts too much and charge labor rates similar to dealerships. Took it elsewhere and saved 30%,UNK
1640,Yet another horrible experience. 7 grain bread was soggy and undercooked. A few weeks ago the tuna was missing from the sandwich. And it's only this location.,UNK
1641,Was our first time here and had a great lunch.  We split the house salad (amazing salad dressing) and a vegetariana pizza.  Food was excellent and our server was awesome.  Loved this place and can't wait to go back again.,UNK

1677,The yougurt dipping sauce is delish!,UNK
1678,This place is great !\nI get the chili cheese fries and  have a Sanders hot fudge sundae for dessert. Sanders Milk chocolate  is the best. Its a nice mom and pop place and the Detroit atmosphere is prevalent all over the place.,UNK
1679,"Basically have to come here for flooring from our builder, this place acts like since we have no option they can treat us like we're not the customer. No stars as this place really needs to train their employees better and not worry about texting or Facebook it's sad they deserve no stars",UNK
1680,The prices are going up and quality is sliding. I thought McCafe would help bring competitive prices to the industry but unfortunately are on par with Starbucks.,UNK
1681,I never leave reviews but this food was so terrible I threw all $40 worth in the garbage. In 32 years its by far the worst food I have ever tried.,UNK

1685,"We had high expectations, as the food at Rivertowne in Verona is great. We tried the beer special, $3 for Anchor Brewing beer that was great. The fish sandwich was excellent but the fries were disappointing. The mushroom burger was very good, too.",UNK
1686,"Good for drinks only, food tasted horrible.  How can you mess up on teriyaki chicken?! It tasted like plastic, and they the staff didnt even do anything about it when asked to change it. Horrible.",UNK

1690,Great second hand furniture and housewares. The clothes are amazing too I just wish they had more of them. The lady working was so very kind and knew a lot about the local stuff going on. If you are looking for a good find for reasonable prices definitely come to this place.,UNK
1691,"Mediocre at best. Food was ok, service was ok, but nothing special. Will not eat here again in the near future.",UNK
1692,Cool location but I found the pizza to be kinda average. The Italian hoagie was good. Parking was a nightmare.,UNK
1693,I liked the food and had a good meal. The decor and the seating arrangements were a little off though and I never really felt comfortable. Its tucked away in a strip mall so I guess its one of those place you have to know to find and they were busy.,UNK

1730,"We tried Joe's today for the first time.  Overall, it was an enjoyable experience.  However, the price is too high for the quality of the product.  Honestly, I enjoy Red Lobster more, which is half the price for Joe's, and Red Lobster gives you bread.",UNK
1731,Great chicken tenders. Juicy and tender staff Are really nice  Reasonable prices. This is a keep coming back place :  ),UNK
1732,OK for a quick breakfast. No one can mess up a nova lox sandwich. Bottomless drinks are a plus.,UNK
1733,"Absolutely delicious!\n\nGreat pizza, just be ready to wait in a very length line and wait time. Be ready to break the bank as the pizza is slightly expensive ($22 I believe is where a full pie starts).",UNK
1734,Free entrance if you print coupon from their website,UNK
1735,Idiots can't even do a simple delivery. Lost my business and future business. They juggle me around from one location to another. Ended up not getting food. Thx,UNK
1736,nothing like ordering bbq from angry folk with attitude and mediocre Q. AND Don't even think about asking for extra sauce. Never again.,UNK

1741,This location was extremely low on staff. I waited about 3 hours to provide a urine sample. The staff was talking very loud about other patients private records and situations. Everyone in the crowded waiting room could hear the staff's conversation.,UNK

1748,"Great views, great customer service.",UNK
1749,For twenty one dollars for a hair cut I thought I would get more than just a cut with the clippers.  To be honest it was kind of like going to Great Clips.  Nothing fancy just a quick hair cut so they can get the people out of the doors.,UNK

1766,"One of the best hotels I have ever stayed. The rooms were elegant, spacious, clean and very comfortable. I would definitely come back.",UNK

1768,"I love me some boots! They have some amazing hats, boots, clothes, and toys for the kids. All of the employees seem to be nice. The prices are very good. Normally things are on sale and or really cheap. I buy boots/ visit the store quite often too.",UNK
1769,Good find! Food interesting! Would come back with a bigger crowd so I could sample more variety! Reny was attentive however a waitress at the front was complaining about work schedule loud enough for customers to hear full conversation!,UNK

1780,"Ever since Dominos changed up their recipe/ingredients, their pizza has really been awesome. I enjoy the thin crust with spinach, tomatoes, and mushrooms.  Mmmm",UNK
1781,The place is about as authentic as one of those cheap plastic coconut bras that you get for $5 at the ABC store in the seedy part of Honolulu but it is tough to argue with their low lunch prices.  I can tolerate a lot more when it is only $5.,UNK
1782,Totally authentic. Splendid.,UNK
1783,"Been wanting to come here for a while and finally stopped in earlier this morning. I got the number 20 and it was pretty good. The potato salad on the side was okay, nothing special. Overall it's a nice place, food is good, but I feel like the portions are small.",UNK

1794,"For people who prepay there should be some element of urgency,  unreal how long its taking. Other car companies have the car waiting.......not Budget, not Budget EVER AGAIN!",UNK

1797,Fucking suckEd.   Very expensive and girls are shit.   Avoid like the noid,UNK
1798,After hours of playing on the tables it was a nice place to stop and rest my feet with an ice cold stout and fresh raw oysters. And eating at a place called Triple 7 has to boost your luck especially in Sin City.,UNK
1799,awesome wings,UNK
1800,"This is my favorite steakhouse! Their appetizers, salad are well made and delicious. The steaks are cooked to exactly to the diner's request. Great place to begin night on the town in uptown Charlotte or celebrate an important event.",UNK
1801,"Horrible customer service, I do not recommend:-(",UNK
1802,How can you complain when it's all a DOLLAR ? I love this place !!! A dollar a hollar ! Yeah !,UNK

1815,"These guys have been my plumbers for years and for good reason. Very trust worthy, punctual and friendly. Always get things done quickly for me and at a great price. I love the fact that they are a family business too.",UNK
1816,"For a flatlander like myself, the ride on this funicular is its own adventure. Add 3 flatlander babes and climbing up a mountain while watching Heinz Field shrink is even more exciting (or terrifying, depending on your outlook).",UNK
1817,"Food is always fresh and the atmosphere is warm and comfy.  My only issue is that the the waitstaff will serve you at random.  One guy for drinks, one person for food, one to bring the check etc.  It gets a little hectic and unorganized.  Peace!",UNK

1819,The Saimin was really good. Get there early to avoid the long line.,UNK
1820,Typical American restaurant. Flavorless. Not to mention overpriced. Don't waste your money.,UNK
1821,We ate here two years ago and everything was fantastic. Ate here last spring after they added 'Steakhouse' to their name and the food and service went downhill. The witch doctor cocktail is still worth the visit though.,UNK
1822,"This place is ridiculous. We had a group of 4 police a child and they said 10-20 minute. We waited 10 minute then the hostess said we can't seat any groups now. Why would they have told us this when we arrived???,,",UNK
1823,Awesome fresh salad for the price. You can make your own or have one of their creations. Same with the sandwiches. Great service too. I will keep coming back.,UNK
1824,"Extremely average pizza. The server was very nice and helpful, but the pizza was nothing special.",UNK
1825,Lunch buffet until 2.30pm.,UNK

1827,"I frequent Jays.  Best gyro deal in the area.  The place is not fancy at all.  Don't expect that great of service.  Be sure to listen for your order to be up.  It is barebones, but my stop in Tempe for gyros..",UNK
1828,4 stars for the onion rings alone.,UNK
1829,"Excellent job. Brandon was very responsive - called to confirm the day before, called when he was on his way. He and his helper packed up everything quickly and efficiently. All in all, very pleased. Made my move significantly easier.",UNK
1830,Best place in Vegas and most of the country. Great prices. Can get busy as this is a local spot and small. Hidden in a strip mall. I always suggest this place!!,UNK
1831,The choclates and pastries are surprisngly really good! And I thought it wouldn't live up to the hype.\n\nBut if it seems too pricey for just pastries then just go to at least see the chocolate display.,UNK
1832,The steak was cooked to perfection  .  Staff  is very friendly. Nice place to hang out.,UNK
1833,Great friendly staff.  Awesome snack on these hot days especially for the kids.  I only dropped a start because they are a little heavy with the syrup.  The kids surely don't mind but I prefer a better ice / syrup ratio.,UNK

1835,"Amazing food, incredible service!",UNK
1836,Service = great. Food = alright. \n\nI've been here a few times over the years. For a cheesy chain it's ok. Nothing amazing. But the endless fries and drinks are a pretty cool feature.,UNK
1837,"This place is not bad but they forgot my moms tempura udon soup. Everyone in the restaurant received there food except for my mom, especially the people that came after us and ordered received their food first. This place does not have a good customer service.",UNK
1838,"The PA Courtney was nice, friendly and knowledgeable. I was pleased with my experience.",UNK
1839,Pretty nice pub atmosphere. Went in for happy hour. Dollar wings and dollar sliders. And 2 for 1 domestic drafts. Nice service and above decent food.,UNK
1840,"Another solid, but not spectacular Las Vegas Hotel/Casino. Good mid-range selection for the north side of the strip. King room I stayed in was notably larger than similarly classed selections in other hotels. Shopping selections (not a big criteria for me) seem more varied than some of the others.",UNK
1841,"Ya, it's that good! I don't really know how healthy it is, especially after adding \""toppings\"" to the stuff, but who cares. The best!",UNK
1842,So happy with this little shop. I was in a bind and needed an entire set of dance shoes for two kids. They were very helpful and I found everything I needed at very good prices.,UNK
1843,"My fianc\u00e9e got her wedding dress here! The selection is unique, outrageous, and well worth a look. They have some very strange looking clothing here, but mixed in are some gems. Their clerk was very helpful and polite, and made us feel welcome.",UNK
1844,"Decent spot in the mall for coffee that isn't overly dark (Starbucks downstairs), cookies that are tasty, and some soup/sandwich options that are much better than the offerings at merchants there in the food court.",UNK
1845,"absolutely amazing show! definite must see! everything was fantastic...the music, the acts, the effects, and the great usage of water. simply entertaining from start to end.",UNK
1846,Selection isn't as nice as other locations. \nParking sucks because its shared with Smart & Final.\nTons of vegan and vegetarian friendly  foods. \nLove their wines!,UNK

1851,House of pizza is the best pizza in Las Vegas thousands of customers will agree with pure ingredients and real Italian new York taste,UNK

1864,"Spicy deliciousness. Fresh and tasty, every time. My favorite Thai restaurant.",UNK
1865,"Went for a tour which was incredibly packed with daycares since it is the summer but the workers handled it lovely. Pay the $10 to make a chocolate pizza, it is worth it. The chocolate is amazing and there is a large selection to choose from!",UNK
1866,This little market has closed down . What a shame.,UNK
1867,"Unique food, great atmosphere, pricey but worth a trip for special occasions.",UNK
1868,"Friendly and welcoming place! Good food. Mussel is highly recommended, very frsh.  And its not expensive!",UNK
1869,I felt every emotion during this show. I don't think you would even have to be a Beatles fan to get into it. Well worth the money!,UNK
1870,"Holy cow, the beer garden in this place is huge.  I couldn't find the people I was looking for, so I guess that was a bad thing in my case.  Looks like it could be a fun time, but it wasn't for me!",UNK
1871,Great burgers very fresh great toppings and a awesome price  very and clean inside and the service very quick,UNK
1872,Sign on the door said something a about the lease. Not sure if closure is permanent.,UNK
1873,"This place is pretty good, and I'm glad to have another place to eat at in North Mesa. The staff is friendly and I like that is a small local business. The chicken quesadilla and carne asada potato were delicious!  I will be going back for sure.",UNK
1874,"I love stopping by Anthology to pick up cards for special occasions and holidays.  It is very charming shop run by lovely people.  If you are looking for quality paper goods and the sweetest rubber stamps around, Anthology is surely the place for you.",UNK
1875,Not impressed overall chicken club was OK but the fish was not good fries and onion rings are frozen.,UNK
1876,"Oh man, I can't really choose between Perkins and IHOP because they are both equally BAD. Perkins was dark and depressing and the food was extremely oily. Ask yourself: Do you want to start your day with breakfast (or lunch or dinner for that matter) at this place?",UNK
1877,We went at noon and the three lions were all sleeping!,UNK
1878,"The biggest collection of garage sale rejects in the city.\nItems are dirty, dusty and of questionable working order.",UNK

1880,It was over an hour wait in line and it whips pretty hard at the end. I thought it was just ok.,UNK
1881,"I definitely am a big fan of the panda express chain, and just so happens 2 be closest 2 my house. :-)",UNK
1882,Got the traditional Gyro and chicken skewer plate.  I'd go for the Gyro over the skewer but both were pretty decent.  Not a fan of their hummus and the Greek salad was just ok.  Rice was good though.,UNK
1883,I ordered pizza by the slice. I got 2 slices which were very greasy and the dough wasn't cooked through. Maybe it was just an off day for the kitchen. Don't know if I'll go back or not. I definitely won't go back for the pizza.,UNK
1884,They don't know what the el Gordo burrito is at this location. Maybe they should look at their own website!  All the others know what it us and make it no questions asked!,UNK
1885,"$1.50 for a huge hotdog and a drink, you really can't beat that. Also, I enjoy their pizza slices as well. It's a nice lunch just to grab while you are there.",UNK
1886,Service is extremely slow and the food is nothing special.  It seems convenient until it takes 2 hours to have breakfast.....Not a fan!,UNK
1887,"Food? Delicious? Korean? Yeah right. This place serves the most disgusting food. Its not food for humans, its food for dogs!!! !!!.....",UNK
1888,"i think most Starbucks are the same, consistent good customer services and good food. The barista will try to please you as much as your weird taste will allow. Even the customer who chilled here are friendly",UNK
1889,Thier cash register doesnt work and this is apparently a regular thing. I had to run over to smiths because my family had already made thir yogurt. Dont go here unless you have cash.,UNK
1890,"Great service - very prompt and professional, meticulous about cleaning up the small branch debris.  Very reasonably priced as well.   Will definitely continue to use their service.",UNK
1891,Most unreliable airlines ever.. Cancelled a San Francisco flight saying it's bad weather when two other flights are going to sfo airport. They wouldn't compensate or do anything. This is my second time with US airways and have had similar experience both times.,UNK
1892,This place was ok. I know there's a lot of good blurb out there and that's why we visited. The service was excellent but the food and drinks were just average. And the bathrooms were dirty. Meh.,UNK
1893,Great beer selection. Delicious poutine. Very chill atmosphere with great service. Can hang here for hours.,UNK

1899,I love the market and the food is wonderful.,UNK
1900,Fun friendly servers and pretty good food! They are known for burgers but their salads are really good too!,UNK
1901,Unfortunately it was recently sold and is no longer the wonderful gem it once was. Very sad.  Don't waste your time or money here.,UNK
1902,Horrible service!!!! If you do not have your party there then they do not seat anyone!! The are rude and very snobby for a service that should be great. Food is fine if you can get past the service :/,UNK
1903,Dive right in! It's my favorite dive in Urbana but since Gremer is gone it's not quite the same. Had to move westward to the other side of the tracks to see my favorite bartender.,UNK
1904,Good food. Sloppy service and dirty. When the front door is dirty and the floor hasn't been swept or the ceiling fans cleaned we should have left.,UNK
1905,"Though the flavors the have are great, i cant get over the fact that they would charge 16 dollars for a 15ml bottle of juice i found the same brand of juice i had bought on ebay for 7 dollars less",UNK
1906,"Food is very good. Spider hand roll is huge and tastes great.\nService is fair.\nMusic a little loud but interesting.\nSeating is weird, get a booth on the bar side of the restaurant or you legs will dangle in space.",UNK
1907,"Steak was over cooked. Ordered medium rare, was served well done.",UNK
1908,"Great service! terrible food, a shame.  The Ceasar salad had the wrong type of lettuce, wrong dressing. Came with tomatos!  Lasagna bland and mushy!  And why. The Tv??!",UNK
1909,"Can not get a hold of them on the phone...ever!   1 hour and no answer.   Same number that is on the tag/license??? What is the point, they don't answer the phone.",UNK
1910,"I bought a Groupon for this place, but have yet to use it since every time I have called (during regular business hours) no one has picked up the phone! I even left a message, but no one has returned my call.\nImpossible to make an appointment!!",UNK
1911,"Thank you, Joe, for fixing my MacAir today!  Ahhh I'm so happy.\n\nThis store is always slammed; must say something about it! :)",UNK
1912,Don't even waste your time or gas it's a total rip off. not to mention the man who owns this Mr. Jim Rhodes is a crook.  If I could give it negative stars I would.,UNK
1913,"Mediocre, forgettable experience. We ordered pineapple fried rice, pad thai and something else I can't recall. One note flavor in all the dishes. I've had better Thai in a mall food court.",UNK
1914,Love Starubucks coffee but hate this location.  Always extremely busy and the people working at this particular one are always so rude and short with customers.  Will go out of my way to go to another Starbucks that offers a more pleasant experience.,UNK
1915,"Tasty pasta, but the quiche has a weird sedimentary crust and they serve rocky roasty potatoes with EVERYTHING. Also the vegan soup usually... tastes it.",UNK
1916,Very poor customer service with an attitude...always rude when you are asking about what they charge. I dont recommend them at all,UNK
1917,I just moved to AZ and needed a mechanic. My friends told me to go see Luis at 2B Transmission and so I did. I was very happy they took good care of me and I highly recommend him. Very nice guys!,UNK
1918,"Always a great meal, tomato moz sandwich amazing, focia pizza amazing",UNK
1919,"Its too smokey for me. The food is really good, the drinks are weak.  sometimes its too loud to talk or hear anyone. Its cool they support local bands, but I dont like paying a cover for crappy local bands.",UNK
1920,"Crazy busy on a Sunday morning @10:00, sat at the bar..quick service..both ordered the Calf. Benny,  Next trip the pork carnitas. Waitress recommended the Southwest carnitas which looked awesome.\nGreat place for breakfast/brunch.",UNK
1921,Root beer is delicious.  Service is very good.  It's hidden waay in the back of a strip of stores so you won't see it driving by.  Enjoyed or meals.,UNK
1922,Had a convention here and the resort seemed a little dated for Vegas.  The staff was spot on and our convention went off without a hitch.  \nI worked a lot so I was not able to enjoy a lot of the hotel besides the dinning options. They were both really nice for a hotel.,UNK
1923,"Good food, horrible customer service. I continue to give them business because it's close to work but otherwise I wouldn't bother. Nothing like being treated crappy while spending your hard earned money. Several of my co-workers have had the same experience.",UNK
1924,Service wasn't good. Our waitress seem over worked and under extreme pressure. The manager did not address our concerns. I will not return to this location.,UNK
1925,I must have gone on a bad day because the fries tasted like cardboard.  The burger weren't all that.  Been there once and never went back. Maybe one day I will give it another try!,UNK
1926,Great pit stop before heading back to LA!,UNK
1927,"The first time I visited Vegas was in 2005, and this place was supposed to be some hot stuff. This time around, it is not any more. The place is so run down. The only nice thing about it is the lobby.",UNK
1928,I love this place :). My husband and I are cult followers of cafe rio.  Their salads are perfect and they have vanilla coke in the fountain and key lime pie.  Perfect storm for us to worship the place.  I think it is because they make everything fresh.,UNK
1929,Great selection of delicious pizza varieties!,UNK
1930,"Love this place!   My 11 yo daughter who is down right terrified of dentists absolutely LOVED Dr. King (Dr. Angel was on maternity leave).   Very nice, cool, young, and awesome.   I'm even changing who I see to do to Angel Dentistry.",UNK

1934,"Good service, nice patio atmosphere, generous portions, excellent drinks. I would recommend the fish tacos and the house margarita, but skip the ceviche.",UNK
1935,Horrible service! Crappy food! We waited 45 min at our table before we even got any type of food.,UNK
1936,They spin a wheel every half hour which will tell you what their drink special is! I had $5 margaritas! Yum!,UNK
1937,I always come here to get my oil change. friendly staff and free car wash!,UNK
1938,This airport needs a train like Atlanta.,UNK
1939,The only boba place I go to!,UNK
1940,"Perhaps it was just a bad day, but our order was messed up multiple times & under cooked.  On the plus side we received a free drink coupon without even asking.   Espresso tastes average, like a Starbucks.  Great location in an attractive neighborhood.",UNK
1941,"It's a very nice and calm restaurant, almost chic kind of, but you can still go there in casual with friends or your loved one. The staff there are great and the chef is awesome! In my opinion, the price isn't too high compared to some very high class restaurant.",UNK
1942,Open on Sunday! We shared thai basil and a pot of tom yum soup. The service was excellent and we liked our dish so much we ordered another one to go. I also loved how clean and neat everything was! We will definitely be coming back.,UNK
1943,"Great food, large portions.",UNK
1944,second time here and this was outstanding.  ryan our man of the night was a perfect example of how a waiter handles orders and explained all servings.  it was a treat to go there with family and friends.  thank you for having a perfect waiter.,UNK
1945,They have a chai tea drink called the Himalayan Hammer. \n\nIt sounds like a sex position.\n\nIt's just as good as one.\n\nNuff said.,UNK
1946,Great place to get plumbing supplies/materials. Counter guys are awesome! Sales ladies know their stuff,UNK
1947,"Loved this place last Saturday nite.  Came back to use 20% coupon we got online. Steak was overcooked and over seasoned, broccoli cold. Very disappointed.",UNK
1948,Ram was too hungover to eat their steak and eggs. They were overcooked. The bloody mary had a spicy back of your throat. Ram had the cheeseballs. So many dudes. Swerve,UNK
1949,"I went, I kindly asked for orange juice (a non menu item), I offered to pay more. They made it without any fuss. I'm happy! Thank you, thus the review A-OK.",UNK
1950,"I ordered take out of Tom Yum soup and Chilli Chicken, what a disappointment. None of these tasted good, Tom Yum soup was kinda disgusting.",UNK
1951,"Love this place!  Not sure why they average only 3 stars.  I get the gel mani/pedi and I'm always happy with the results.  Had a male do my nails today (not sure of his name), but he was awesome!",UNK
1952,Never get my online order in less than an hour. I'm done!,UNK
1953,The staff is friendly and quick to make the food. But as far as the food goes it's not worth the money. The bread is very thin and hard and the sandwiches are very plain and lacking in flavor.,UNK
1954,Great place with great owners! The smoothies are so much better than Jamba juice! Give it a try you won't be sorry!,UNK
1955,What I love about this place is that the service is constantly fabulous the food is wonderful and the company divine. Love everything about it is specially the too young lady sitting next to us.,UNK
1956,Wanted a Pedicure and figured I'd give this place a try since it was across the street from my hotel.,UNK
1957,It was our first time here... But we'll definitely be back!!!! Simple delicious fast. Great service. Great choices. Can't wait to try the ong choy Thai style!,UNK
1958,Fabulous! Where has this place been all my life. Everyone is so friendly and seem to really enjoy their jobs. Every drink I have ever had here is awesome. Definitely worth giving up Starbucks over.,UNK
1959,Very good sushi. Thanks fellow helpers for the reccommendation. I visited this place while on a business trip and wasn't disappointed. Will definitely come back. Sushi was far better than the fancy places on Scottsdale Blvd.,UNK
1960,"Excellent restaurant! Great food, great service, and the ambiance was great. Not too loud, not too quiet. The beef is amazing - quite possibly the best I have ever had.  The only downfall I would have to say is the price, quite expensive.",UNK
1961,"I bought their Groupon and have called several times and sent several emails about making a reservation and they do not reply.  They are a scam, avoid them, they take your money and screw you.  Now I need to call Groupon to get my money back!",UNK
1962,"Way overrated by yelp! Pho ok, but small portion and not much meat",UNK
1963,"Although none the dresses popped out at us and the ones that did were out of our price range, Dedee was very helpful and courteous. I would return here in the future if I needed evening wear and had the budget for it.",UNK
1964,This restaurant has a very fun vibe w great servers. The owner is almost always here and very friendly. The food is great and never disappoints.  Highly recommend this place for breakfast and lunch.  Our Server Shannon was great.,UNK
1965,Went there for lunch and had a Chicken chopped salad.  There was not a lot of chicken and it was not cheap!  Everything is already made and it is re-heated after you order it.,UNK
1966,Patience is required as they take their sweet time and it isn't even busy. It's been 30 minutes and I don't know that they'll be done soon. I would come back because it's cheap but definitely not during 'rush' hour.,UNK
1967,"The food is ok for 1am food. I've had better but it is definitely edible.\n\nHowever I waited over 30 minutes despite nudging twice to pay. They are massively understaffed, at least at night.",UNK
1968,"I got marry on aug 10, 2013 and it was great they were really nice always helpful I can say is if any one wants to get marry n a nice romantic place then this is the place",UNK
1969,I stay away for chain restaurants for a reason and my recent dinner only confirmed that. \nFood-bland and inconsistent from person to person. \nWait staff - sucked and no effort\nI will not be going back.,UNK
1970,"small aquarium, but it's not too pricey. it has a cool tunnel where you can see the teeth of the shark. pretty cool to be able to see a shark in the middle of the desert!",UNK
1971,Average pancake house with nothing to rave about. The eggs were good and so were the pancakes.  I would have loved to try the grits but they had none.  \n\nNothing to write home about - guess I am spoiled because we have stellar breakfast joints in suburban Chicago.,UNK
1972,Loved this place!!!! You MUST visit this place when your in vegas!!,UNK
1973,Always a good brunch location. Wish they'd open one in the east valley closer to where I live. Chocolate pancakes and eggs Benedict are my favorites here.,UNK
1974,"I haven't stayed here but I've been inside. Hotel looks really nice. Nice lobby and very well decorated. Its located at a descent location on the Strip. However, their casino isn't the best. If you are a gambler, might wanna hit up some other casinos.",UNK
1975,Saturday morning is the farmers market great to get fresh veggies and fruit.\nAnd the kids can play while u do a little shopping. \nThey have alot of goodies. All natural stuff.,UNK
1976,"I know it's the airport but are wings really that hard to make? We only had an order of wings and a beer and soda, but the wings were wayyyy below par.  Service was decent.",UNK
1977,Rip off 8 dollars a beer!  Seriously not kidding!  Insane!  Truly beyond belief!  Pizzas also very overpriced!,UNK
1978,This place is really authentic Chinese style. Strongly recommended for people who love Chinese cuisine. They even have hot pot from Mon-Thur. Will try next time,UNK
1979,Not a fan...boring food and their service stinks!\nThey wouldn't serve our party water (on the patio-mid summer) until the whole party arrived! LAME,UNK
1980,"Went here recently for daughter's birthday.  As always, excellent service,food good, but pricey.  One of our favorite places.",UNK
1981,mostly clothes. ghetto vibe.,UNK

1985,"Fun Club, open format so you heard every type of music, had a great time, atmosphere was cool, not packed, which is a good thing in Las Vegas NC, I would no doubt go back",UNK
1986,Good beer. Bad facsimile of German food,UNK
1987,"Soooo happy we came here!!! I'm not usually a fan of eating Indian food at a restaurant but we came here for father's day and we not disappointed. Everything was so tasty and perfectly portioned too. If you like Indian food, you must try this place.",UNK

1992,"I have my office cabinets installed by VIP Smart storage on August 2nd, 2013 and I'm very happy with the result. The cabinet is good quality,  stable and look good. The company have quality employees who are professional and provide excellent customer services.",UNK
1993,I used to really like this place but the last time I was there the sushi was not fresh. Salmon tasted yucky. I think the standard is going down.,UNK
1994,Wish it was better. Wasn't sure the shuttle was going to show. It arrived 15 mins late. Guide did not top talking the entire trip. Spent to much time in lines.,UNK
1995,I had steamed chicken and veggies along with hot and sour soup! I would never get tired of it!,UNK
1996,I'm not a vegan but the food here is great. You come out of there feeling very healthy too. The environment is also very nice and modern.,UNK

1998,"Favorite Park in the city! Beautiful spot! Fitness,Family or Fun!",UNK
1999,"I was not dazzled by the food.  The place is quaint for an uptown spot.  The food is definitely overpriced. I will not return on my dime, it would have to be someone else's.",UNK
2000,What do you expect it is TGI Friday's.  Only thing open late night at Aliante.,UNK
2001,"Worth the 15 min. Drive. Creative concept came thru on all notes , well done  generous portions  left totally satisfied   love the  Drink Menu",UNK
2002,Vraiment une bonne adresse de restauration rapide. La qualit\u00e9 est en moyenne sup\u00e9rieure \u00e0 ce qu'on retrouve ailleurs.,UNK
2003,"Good guys. Just ask for Stu and he'll take care of you. I've used them for several clients already (restaurant, construction) and not a problem. They let you know how long it takes and they've always hit the mark for me.",UNK
2004,Excellent - especially for airport food. The carne asada tacos were great.,UNK
2005,I used to like this place but poorly managed and incompetent wait staff. I will never come back.,UNK
2006,Went here cause a friend said was so great. After waiting over an hour to be saeted it wasn't worth the wait. It was just OK.,UNK

2008,Great Customer Service! Affordable! Quick Turn around!,UNK
2009,i'm a total fan of eons. love their selection! a little pricey though.,UNK
2010,"Seems to be a mixture if various Asian dishes. The food was tasty but not out of this world heavenly! Service was ok. Overall, not wow-d by the experience unfortunately.",UNK
2011,Seriously the best Miso soup I have ever had. The fish is fresh and all the rolls are well made and flavorful. Strongly recommend it.,UNK
2012,"We love this place, it is always clean, well staffed & tastes so good! prices are reasonable & after you spend $50 you get $5 off.  The evenings get very busy, so we normally come in the afternoon.",UNK
2013,"Great customer service with friendly employees.\n\nSometimes things can get backed-up, but remember this seems to be a training location for new local CJs.\n\nThey are very flexible with allowing customers ask for food \""their way\"".",UNK
2014,Service is very friendly. I had the cheesequila with steak and it was a great breakfast combo. Lots of gluten free options but still pancakes and toast if you want to have the traditional breakfast stuff.,UNK
2015,Have only been for lunch on 2 occasions.\n\nSalad and soup was great but it took awhile to get it. Not sure that would be good if I worked!,UNK
2016,You never know what you will see on Fremont st. The place for a cheep show from the man in the box to the guy painting with spray paint to the guy doing clay sculpture while you wait also you may see jesus. The light show if pretty cool to.,UNK
2017,Stir fry selection is great.  They have everything from steak to fish to scallops.  The only downfall is during dinner rush it can take a long time to have your food prepared.,UNK
2018,Too good for words!  Amazing service and even better food! I  can't wait to come back and try more! Charles was our server and did an excellent job recommending dishes! The chef came over a few times to check on us and even sent out food for us to try!,UNK
2019,"Had my carpets, tile , and grout cleaned and they exceeded my expectations! My tile especially its night and day difference. Luiz and his staff were friendly and professional. I will be recommending them to friends and family.",UNK
2020,"This place is now closed. Apparently they lost their liquor license and those of us who purchased a Yelp Deal for that place are stuck with a certificate we cannot use. Shame, because I heard so many great things about the food. RIP Antars.",UNK
2021,"Nothing special, but close to my loft in Phoenix.  I have walked by this place for years and never stopped in and finally got around to it today.  The Gyro with Feta was solid, but nothing special.",UNK
2022,Gyro salad was big it equals 2 meals for me. Most popular item that everyone I saw getting was the gyro pita meal.\n\nAnd the gyro meat melts in your mouth,UNK
2023,This place is definitely awesome! Never have I seen a more organized and fancy Filipino Restaurant here in Vegas before! And they've got great lunch specials! I recommend the Dinuguan! :),UNK
2024,Visiting for a week on business. Great local beer! Definitely worth checking out if you're in the area. I recommend the Honey  Brown. They also had a local band playing. Offers seating inside and two balconies.,UNK
2025,"Not nearly as good as good as Big Daddy's, Counter Burger or the Penguin.  But also much cheaper.  No table service for food; outdoor seating on side of four lane road.  Everything feels a bit cheap but it also shows up in terms of value on the menu and drink list.",UNK
2026,Just had break job and oil change and it was done quickly and professionally.  Very impressed with the overall experience and I will refer all of my friends and coworkers to these guys from now on.  Thanks again to all at Brake Masters.,UNK

2029,great selection VERY HIGH PRICES,UNK
2030,"There is nothing quite like the pork soup dumplings. They are fantastic! My husband orders a batch alone for his meal. The hot and spicy wonton noodles are not for the heat weak minded. I love spicy food, and this satisfies every craving!",UNK
2031,"The 3 4 1 happy hour really means they will take one drink and mix it with water and pour it into three glasses for you. It may be a \""new\"" bar but it is worn out, it would be nice if they invested some money in the replacing the duct taped vinyl seating.",UNK
2032,"I was in Montreal for F1 weekend.  I couldn't be happier to find this place and get the cut I needed.  Great atmosphere, skilled barbers, reasonable prices.   I'll be back next year.",UNK
2033,"Overpriced mediocre food. It isn't God awful, but nothing to look forward to either. Save your bucks for more satisfying food. If you end up at the buffet anyway, the tiny Tiramisu and the cheese Blitzes are descent.",UNK
2034,I can here not knowing what to expect. I left full and happy. Many traditional items were on the menu as well as a few specialties. Make sure you get there early or you will have a long wait.,UNK

2039,"I've been eating here for 10 years or so, starting back in my art institute days. The place has stayed stable over the years although the food has dropped a little in quality since the staff changed. But you still can't beat the two entree lunch for $4.92!",UNK
2040,"Don't order online. You pay for what you order but sometimes meat is forgotten, and you're paying for items you don't get. Otherwise the food is good and the people at the counter are friendly.",UNK
2041,"Mediocre at best for concerts. Long, rectangular space that is absolutely flat. If you are not fairly close to the stage you can't see the stage. Weird layout...",UNK
2042,Best fried chicken I've had in the area. Workers were super nice and helpful. Only reason I gave 4 instead of 5 is I thought the sides were just ok.,UNK

2048,Don't believe any bad review! These guys have passion! The level of detail and care that the Clean Freak team spends on every part of the car is nuts! I haven't seen anyone work this hard or care this much about a deep clean. I am very impressed.,UNK

2053,I've been to other places in Laveen and this one is the best. Awesome prices and the people are very friendly. Even as a walk in on a busy day they are staffed to meet the demanding need and not having to wait too long. LOVE IT,UNK
2054,I ate the hot dogs... Really not good at all... Plus soggy French fries... Sweetened iced tea in the unsweetened dispenser...,UNK

2057,"What a great place to sit and eat where portion sizes are big, prices are reasonable and service was out of this world. I liked being off the strip away from the chaos for a while. Gave me a feeling of home!! Thank you!!",UNK
2058,"Food...eh Pricey for average food although they try to make it an upscale experience. Wine/drinks good. Service excellent.  Heard happy hour is good 3-6p, 11p-2a.",UNK

2062,"Clean, professional, and very fast.  Could not be more impressed.",UNK

2081,"They always seem to have a peanut butter variety in stock, which is a total win in my book. Plus they have the best sampling policy in the city...and you can wander around Pottery Barn while you eat.",UNK
2082,Quick lunch with my manager before flying out of Phoenix. Good food; Mexican ambiance. Guac was the best I've ever had... Veggie taco over pork taco over fish taco,UNK
2083,"This is not a Walmart, the standard were low. Customer eating in the aisle and the beer selection sucked but if you are a bud fan welcome to your heaven, enjoy",UNK
2084,"The fried pickles were great, and the fries were so-so. I really wish the ownership never changed. From what i hear it is not the same as it used to be. Still i wont be too harsh on the ol' penguin. 3 stars for me",UNK
2085,"This buffet does not belong in a 5 star hotel.  It was overpriced for the quality, when compared to Bellagio's or Wynn's buffet.  We only ate here because of $100 credit that came with hotel room",UNK

2088,Meh - I've had better sushi for a cheaper price. I guess they can charge whatever because you are trapped. Vegas.,UNK
2089,If you are in need of a doughnut fix this is the place to go. I had bought a half dozen for my boyfriend and I to share and we almost finished the whole box in one sitting! My favorite would have to be the Maple Bacon but there are still more that I have yet to try.,UNK
2090,Horrible service!!! Came here by accident and they were so rude I couldnt believe it! All sitting around and said it was a 45min wait!! Went right next door to major auto service and peter helped me! He was so polite and nice!,UNK
2091,"Came back for another tattoo and saw Tanner again. Just some lettering on the ribs. Same great attitude, attention to detail and price. SO happy I have this place and artist. I'll definitely be back when I'm ready for my next ink.",UNK
2092,Meh... This yoga studio is just okay. There are much better hot classes in Charlotte (and at a much cheaper price). It seems like people just go here so they can check-in on Facebook rather than practice yoga.,UNK
2093,I gotta give them 5 stars.  I love the old house ambiance and the friendly service.  My Italian pasty was excellent and enough for two meals.  They have a great beer selection.  Be sure to enjoy their patio when the weather is nice.,UNK
2094,"This cafe is terrible! The drinks are just as expensive as starbucks but don't taste half as good!! The staff is extremely rude and have major queen attitudes, stick with the starbucks across the street. 1 star because it looks pretty on the outside.....",UNK
2095,"One of my favorite restaurants! I eat at Cornish Pasty at least once a month because the food is that good and the atmosphere is ago much fun. Everything on the menu is yummy, but the Reuben pasty is the best on the menu. Truly delish.",UNK
2096,"Better than Starbucks. That's all I got, but its enough. Check it out if the yuppies don't scare you away.",UNK
2097,Had the Sushi which was good and a wedge salad which was great.\nNo doubt the steaks are top notch but I just wasn't in the mood,UNK
2098,"Great food. And though I'm not usually a fan of chocolate, the chocolate souffle was to die for! The view is wonderful, the service was great. Not the very best Las Vegas has to offer, but still mighty fine!",UNK
2099,"Great place to eat. The atmosphere is electrifying. If you go on a weekend evening, it is packed with young people. Their food is excellent. Pomme frites, garganelli and southern fried quail hit the home run for me. Will go there over and over again!",UNK
2100,"Only LVCC direct option, but rooms are very run down and food options are horrible on site. They have a captive tradeshow market and have done few upgrades in past 10+ years. Decent suites for client events and catered food is good enough to impress clients with a view of the strip.",UNK
2101,"One of my favorite local shops. It has locally produced coffee, meat, bread, honey, salsa and fresh eggs. Also nice selection of tamales. I shop here every week to supplement my groceries with all the locally produced goods. Very happy they are in my neighborhood!",UNK
2102,"Ewww, just ewww. I may need a tetanus shot from being in the store.",UNK
2103,"We had a Blt Burger, Slider, shared an order of Fries and two drinks. The total was $47.50 before tip. The burgers were pretty good. The service was rushed and not so friendly. Will not be back.",UNK
2104,The happy hour prices are EXCELLENT and the food is great! I really enjoyed my experience here and I will definitely return.,UNK
2105,ugh not a fan :(,UNK
2106,"After 2 bites, I threw my chili dog out.   Seek out another place selling a quality dog (like Hebrew National or even Nathan's) instead of this.  Nice view from the outdoor patio though.",UNK
2107,Great atmosphere. Chopped salad was great. Lamb burger was far too gamey and fries where mediocre.,UNK
2108,I absolutely love the fish tacos at Rubios!!!  I have and will continue to recommend Rubios to friends and family!!  If you've never had a fish taco I would suggest trying your first one at Rubios!!  DELICIOUS!!,UNK
2109,Sadly I've never really had good food or drinks here.\n\nThe place is kinda nice inside but I'm SOOO not into the Themed Restaurants.  They were cool for a week but that week has long passed.,UNK
2110,two stars; great organized store; very clean; my problem is that I went to store for a specific item on the recent ad and they were totally out of the product; as a result I bought nothing there and went elsewhere to do my shopping,UNK
2111,"Always friendly, and the crust is so fresh.",UNK
2112,"The one by me has been under \""preview\"" since December, its now nearly May... Well when it opens I guess I can try it!  Looks nice but seeing it in use is believing. Parking lot is always filled, so must be decent? Maybe its time to join?",UNK
2113,We had dinner here a few weeks ago and for $100 I'm not impressed at all. I was expecting better food for the price range. Our service was fantastic and the restaurant was nice but the food was a let down. Definitely not on the list of places I would return to.,UNK
2114,"LOVE ikea,   make sure you try the swedish meatballs at the cafe or be sure to pick up a bag of them to take home in the frozen food section!!",UNK
2115,This was by far one of my best dining experiences... Chef Mimmo is amazing. From the food to the service to the ambiance.. I can't not say enough!,UNK
2116,Third time here it's never open.\nWalk by last night still no changes or was locked,UNK
2117,"Miss my old home! Best place to live! Gated community, security, and close to everything... The 101, 202 & 60. Tempe Marketplace, Mesa riverview and 10 minutes from Old Town Scottsdale!",UNK
2118,"Super helpful and nice. I had no idea what I wanted or what I was looking for. Someone helped me pick a good flavor for 30 or so minutes. I hear that organic juice exists for the vapes, and if it does, I hope they carry it. I enjoy getting my products there.",UNK
2119,"Ate at the bar, very good service, Mai Tai's were excellent.  Lettuce wraps, salads, lasagna were all very good.",UNK
2120,The crepes themselves are really delicious.  I had the Monterey Crepe and I would definitely recommend it.  Will try a dessert crepe next time for sure.  I'll downside was how disorganized the seating process was as well as the wait time.  Worth the wait though.,UNK
2121,It's OK. Next time I'll try another menu item.,UNK
2122,Beautiful place and beautiful grounds.,UNK
2123,Absolutely DISGUSTING! Filthy chef / owner - Armando Martinez (not Italian by the way) could care less about the food you are going to put in your mouth or the service he provides - beware fellow foodies!,UNK
2124,"Staff isn't friendly, place is a maze!",UNK
2125,Great place for supplements. They have a knowledgeable staff and have a great selection of product. The prices are about average as well. Not to high but not Super cheap either. They also have a smoothie bar as well that's pretty sweet!,UNK
2126,Awesome.  One word says it all,UNK
2127,"JD pecan pie is yummy!  We enjoyed the chicken fried steak, too.  Our waitress was fun, happy and obviously enjoyed her job.  We'll be back.",UNK
2128,"Good after hours spot! I usually go around 2am on the weekend after hanging out at the epicenter. The food is okay, but the people watching is hilarious. FYI, the crowd can get a little rough.",UNK
2129,I really enjoyed this place. The guy taking orders was awesome and the red Chile is great. Its very hard to find good red Chile and they have it.,UNK
2130,Jizz-tasic!!!,UNK
2131,Very good- I like getting the white pizza on half and another flavor- like the special(like supreme) or the spicy chicken if you like hotter sauces....quick for takeout too!,UNK
2132,Three words--chilli cheese fries.  YUM!,UNK
2133,The portion of food here were huge. You need 2 people to eat one dish and we got a lot of food. I would not of tried this place if the other restaurant would let a toddler in the fine dining so we settle for this place.,UNK
2134,"Must admit I like casual restaurants like this plus I love Mediterranean food.\nGreat choices for Vegetarians - super friendly staff, good choice of beer, plenty of seating and food tasted great.\nWe usually make the mistake of ordering too much food....",UNK
2135,I had an inspection and oil change. There was only one guy working alone and he communicated like a cave man. I will not be back.,UNK
2136,"Here for the 35 cent wings and now I remember why I stopped coming here.  Extremely slow service, tiny teeny itty bitty wings & flat beer.  Got here at 7:30 and barely leaving at 9p due to the ridiculous wait time.",UNK
2137,I had the southern fried shrimp tacos. They were quite tasty. However they were made with popcorn shrimp which I feel should be noted on the menu. The Mac & cheese was so-so. We did have green curry mussels as an app though that were delicious!,UNK
2138,Overall a decent place to eat breakfast.  Make sure to ask how things are prepared as they may make things a bit differently than you expect.  Service was good. Others around us were not as lucky with that.,UNK
2139,Terrible Billing Dept!!!! They lost my lousy $6.58 payment and put me through Hell trying to prove it was paid - Total IDIOTS,UNK
2140,"Go on a weekday! You almost have the place to yourself. If you go on a weekend or holiday, forget it!! You're dodging strollers and kids wherever you go!!",UNK
2141,"Huge portions, perfect hangover food, but the service was less than attentive. I'd go back bc the food helped clear up my hangover.",UNK
2142,"Very friendly service and a great dining experience.   Wr sat outside which was very nice.   The pizza was probably a 3 or 4 star but the service and atmosphere makes up the difference.  And a plus,  they serve Coke products.  And there are not too mancy choices in Verado.",UNK
2143,"I LOVE their products but I can't stand the smell of the store! I can't imagine how anyone can work there, just being in the store for 5 minutes gives me a headache. If you're sensitive to overpowering smells, stick to online ordering.",UNK
2144,"Stay away from this hooters. Bad food, bad service. Bleh!",UNK
2145,Awful drinks. The beer was extremely watered down and the mixed drinks were horrible. Not a place for a group get togethers for lunch before a game.,UNK
2146,First time visitor and I highly recommend! The staff and hair stylist were very welcoming and nice! I only had to have extensions taken out this visit but will definitely return once back in town. A++,UNK
2147,If you're willing to fork out the money -- you too can taste the best steak and lobster bisque on the planet.,UNK
2148,Pizza is very good and the Philly & fries were great. People there are always nice to my wife and I even when we're wearing our Bears gear & they're Packer fans. We live nearby and hope they stay around!!,UNK
2149,"Friendly, efficient service. Very good chef's salad, delicious club sandwich. Quite atmosphere. Fair prices with generous portions. Senior crowd but doesn't have to be, we were the only family here at the time but felt very welcome. We'll be back!",UNK
2150,I just started going to this place and they are very nice and helpful.  I will be getting a hair cut and treatment done here soon and will review again after!,UNK
2151,"My boyfriend loves this store!! There are old, rare books that you won't ever see nowhere else. It's a very cool place to stop in and take a look around!",UNK
2152,Wow! So I am in the market for a gym with a pool. So glad I checked  Yelp! Needless to say I will NOT be considering LA Fitness.,UNK
2153,Had to drop my rating a couple of stars because they never offer the trout for the 3 course lunch special anymore.  The trout is what really made the lunch special great.,UNK
2154,"Very tasty and fresh kabobs made to order.  So far the best kabobs I have had in Vegas, just like back home.  Will definitely come back for more kabobs. This restaurant just opened 4 days ago. Service was great.",UNK
2155,Friendly enough place,UNK
2156,"A good sandwich, but not great.  I tried the meatball, BLT and original, none of them were exceptional.  I guess most folks don't know what an excellent sandwich really tastes like.",UNK
2157,"The drinks are humongous (not a good thing), and the food is mediocre. I guess it's a slight step up from fast food, but for the price it isn't worth the trip.",UNK
2158,Dj is cool. The place needs a theme ASAP,UNK
2159,"Edamame and California roll.  Simple lunch, prepared and served well.  Will definitely come back next time I'm in town.",UNK
2160,"Well, if your address isn't correct and you don't pick up the phone to help with directions you can't expect a great customer response...  Was really looking forward to eating here, now not so sure.",UNK
2161,This place is alright I get the BBQ short ribs. Good price for a big plate of sticky rice and short ribs.,UNK
2162,"Wonderful local restaurant. Super clean, friendly with very authentic and tasty food. Try asking for some recommendations. We tried the soup, dumplings and curry, all of which were great. Highly recommended.",UNK
2163,"cool views up top, but food kinda sucks since it's not even considered fine dining. some food may look good, but don't taste very good, do not order seafood; think about it, why would you order seafood in a desert?",UNK
2164,"Food was just average.  Crab cake sliders were blah.  Husband had the club sandwich, it was pretty good.",UNK
2165,"Really cool concept- they use local ingredients (some picked right outside of their front door). We went for breakfast and had the a) meat and potatoes and b) chicken and mushroom scrambles. These were BIG portions, so bring your appetite.",UNK
2166,Good food. Good prices. Good looking wait staff. Hostess was really nice and really cute. Service is fantastic. I come back yes.,UNK
2167,I liked this place although the food seems dry and it is halal. Although nice food for fish and fries were tasty.,UNK
2168,Overrated .  Prices are to high.  The desserts are good but not worth the price.  Food is blah for what you pay.,UNK
2169,Great place to watch the hockey game.  Plenty of TV's with great staff.  \n\nI recommend the Poutine and any of the burgers.  This is pun food so I would try to get fancy.,UNK
2170,"What an great hotel.  Friendly valets, exceptional front desk staff, awesome bartenders, and above and beyond management service.  I WILL be back again, hopefully this time for pleasure rather than business!",UNK
2171,"Nice facility but massage therapist tend to be below excellent at Massage Envys, for every good massage I must endure 4 - 5 well below excellent massages.",UNK
2172,I thought it was very boring considering the price. They have 1 dish and it's a basic salad and steak and fries. The steak I had coated $20 and was thin and tough.  The fries are pretty lame too. I don't understand the great reviews.,UNK
2173,I went theyre with my boyfriend and family and i must say the food was delicious!!!! We ordered pizza salad and sandwiches and everything was great!! I must say we didnt have any leftovers to take home lol looking forward to a return visit.,UNK
2174,"The drinks were too weak, what is advertised as hot is not. We had the Shrimp Diablo which was bland (as were the home made tortilla). We were one drink and out..",UNK
2175,I feel badly for posting a negative review. I am unable to delete it so I'm resubmitting it.,UNK
2176,"Love this place, I get the $7 lunch special almost every day. Just call ahead and they will have it ready for you. Staff is friendly and food is great",UNK
2177,The food here is decent but certainly not worth dealing with the very condescending owner. I'd much rather take my money to a place that appreciates their customers.,UNK
2178,The bread was good.,UNK
2179,I enjoyed their bacon Bloody Mary!  The portions here are outrageous! I recommend doing any of the hashes!,UNK
2180,Dark and ominous. Love the setting. The service was okay. The bangers and mash pasty was a letdown. The garlic fries were good though. I'll come back and try a different pasty.,UNK
2181,This is not the same quality as the Jersey Mike's we have in san diego. The roast beef wasn't rare at all and portion was not what I am used to. Overall the sandwhich was good.,UNK
2182,I was my late night dinner. The service was great and friendly.,UNK
2183,"The  staff is so friendly, always great service. I have eaten sushi here 8x and never had a bad meal. Great value and everything is delicious! Love the Tiger Roll and Salmon lover.",UNK
2184,ummm its ok!,UNK
2185,I wasn't that excited about the breakfast I had. We had the breakfast skillet and the kids had pancakes nothing I tried here was rememberable. I'll have to give it another chance since its in my neighborhood.,UNK
2186,This place was just okay to me. Food is good and the service is excellent. I had the kung pao chicken and the servings are HUGE!! Not satisfied enough to come back.,UNK
2187,"I enjoy this place for the tea since I am not a coffee drinker, in the afternoons they have music and is also great for people watching.",UNK
2188,Had dinner here on a Monday night.  Service was fairly slow but friendly.  Fried oysters were not cooked enough and sent back and then came back burnt.   The kicker was asking for water and having it poured in my empty soda glass.  Probably will not be back here.,UNK
2189,"Tried the American Chopsuey, tad too much sweet sauce for my taste.\nThe fried rice was spiced right",UNK
2190,"Very awesome place for bread. Very good. Go in early though because it will sell out :,(",UNK
2191,"The service was friendly but highly inadequate. The food was delivered incorrectly and slowly. Once delivered not overwhelmingly wonderful, but not horrible either...although I did have about three soggy shrimp in the mix. Not sure how you make soggy shrimp but they managed to do it!",UNK
2192,Finally got to experience terminal 3. I had to pick up friends and drop them off at the airport and it was all smooth sailing. We decided to step inside and check it out. It didn't really look fancy brand new but it was very clean.,UNK
2193,Incredible!  The bartender was so sweet and made the night for us!  The food was great and we would 100% come here again,UNK
2194,"The Pirate Ship is broken.  Pretty typical actually.  Seems like this time it is going to be broken for a while.  My advice, keep walking, plenty of more fun to be had elsewhere on the strip.",UNK
2195,They always pass out their flyers at the house so if I'm lucky I get them before blowing all over the lawn kicker is they don't ever offer delivery in our area.,UNK
2196,"$8.25 for a little Bloody Mary, well Vodka. You make the call",UNK
2197,Closing down for several months to add a kfc to a taco bell that is doing a perfectly fine business and then revising your hours so that you are not open as late doesn't impress me.,UNK
2198,"The pizza is good for a quick bite, but the service, even a simple greeting sucks... I know I have tattoos and it's a busy Las Vegas food court but show some effort. Ha",UNK
2199,I would have never waked into this placE without the reviews from Yelp and man am I glad I did. Great food served up in a shed. Will return.,UNK
2200,Meh. I've experienced better.\n\nStandard Target selection to be found at this one.  Only thing that takes it down a notch below others is the cleanliness of the store.  Not filthy -- just not up to par.,UNK
2201,"Gotta see the cussing waiter, it's like having dinner and a show!   Great service and the happy hour specials are on point!",UNK
2202,It just closed. It was exquisite as a reviewer put it but too expensive and snobby  for these times.,UNK
2203,"So delicious! As a vegetarian, they have great options for me. I really love the veggie bao & Nutella bao!",UNK
2204,the bistro is pricey but good food.  you have to want to go to enjoy the environment.\n\nthe nightclub was subpar.  they played pop music and songs that are not fun to dance to unless you're drunk off your mind.,UNK
2205,We each got a drink and each ordered a sandwich. The waitress let us order and then it turns out they didn't even have lettuce. Just wasn't a great experience overall. I won't be going back and was very disappointed!,UNK
2206,Pool Masters are great! They repaired my pool and give me the best weekly cleaning service. cheap and easy!,UNK
2207,I go out of my way to go to this Walgreens because of how clean and well-organized it is. Late night staff is always very friendly. The pharmacist was helpful and polite and answered all of my questions passionately. They have my business!,UNK
2208,"Come here if you want to spend $50+ per head on burnt, bitter steaks, soggy vegetables and weak sour drinks.",UNK
2209,"Awesome alternative to starbucks.  The service was good, and the two drinks I got (chiller mocha and tropical temptation smoothie) were excellent.  The prices seemed a bit high, but it was made up for in quality of their product.",UNK
2210,"Rooms are spacious and well appointed.  But the bathrooms are FANTASTIC!  Nice marble bathtubs, great amenities.  Love it.  Always want to stay here.",UNK
2211,"Beware, I was shocked to find out they charge a delivery fee for each item. I ordered 3 sandwiches and was charged $4.09 delivery. That's $1.36 ea. Ridiculous, almost the cost of a sandwich.",UNK

2215,Fabulas great service with a smile. And good fresh food always donut clerks exceed my expectations,UNK
2216,This place is absolutely gross the bathroom is horrible the rooms are dirty the wait time is insane over 4 hours when someone is in extreme pain is insane! Avoid this place if I could give it -100 stars I would,UNK
2217,You should check out PlayNetwork.com.  Great customer service with a ton of service options that won't break the bank.,UNK
2218,"Even though I said that I couldn't spend that much on sunglasses to replace my cheap scratched ones, the clerk was very helpful and offered to clean my current ones for free to see if the solution might fill some of the shallow scratches. I will be back when I have more money to spend :)",UNK
2219,"This restaurant discriminates based on gender; went in tonight and was told that all women get free pizzas and men do not, so I walked out...",UNK
2220,"Rude, disrespectful and obnoxious. Will never come back here again. Don't waste your time or money.",UNK
2221,I will de decently recommend this place..,UNK
2222,"A very efficient double-decker bus that runs loop from the airport through the city.  It's moderately expensive for a bus, I thought, but the plentiful space for bags inside and the limited stops it made are advantages over a city bus.",UNK
2223,We went for my mothers birthday and it seemed like our waitress didn't care about our table but the table across from us she gave a lot of attention to. We felt and ignored and we won't be coming here again. If I could give zero stars I would.,UNK
2224,"I wrote a review on Sunday and now it's gone ? It was about their very, very poor service. Where do the reviews go that are up on the Yelp website and then disappear from the businesses page one is reviewing?",UNK
2225,"Overpriced and food wasn't good! It was a wild place with all the going on with the employees dressing up going around giving free shots etc., but food was bad and pricey!",UNK
2226,"LOL, the new place for \""People Of Walmart\"". It's a larger, cleaner version of Food City. Some strange characters shop there. Affordable though. Bag your own stuff.",UNK
2227,This is a great place to just chill whether it with friends or if you just failed an exam and you need a drank lol. They have great drink deals and good food too. I recommend trying the Irish nachos. They have different specials everyday too.,UNK
2228,Authentic and fresh. It's always great to see your meat sliced in front of you. Hot pastrami on rye took me right back to my childhood in Manhattan.,UNK
2229,"Take out shouldn't be cold when it gets home. 3rd time here. Sad. Not - not warm - cold. Veggies, chicken, rice...everything. Cold Asian food is not ok. If I wanted to reheat my dinner, I'd go to the frozen section.",UNK
2230,"Update - There is a \""for lease\"" sign on the building. It's safe to say they closed.",UNK
2231,Slowest Drive thru all the time. But location and my morning need for egg and cheese wraps has me coming back for more.,UNK
2232,"Tried dinner there on a coupon. Overall a good experience, but not the caliber steakhouse the prices imply. Great martinis.",UNK

2234,No longer the human bean,UNK
2235,Excellent food with great service.,UNK
2236,"Thank you for the friendly service! But the food was too sweet for me and never really did it for me. I'm willing to try it again, based on it's close location, but I will hope for a spicier experience.",UNK
2237,I have to be honest that I really would prefer to go to the Home Depot down the road. The customer service at Home Depot is really really good especially because I'm not always sure exactly what I need. I also think they have a little bit better selection.,UNK
2238,"Tequila selection isn't what it used to be, and the menu has a lot of inaccuracies (sorry sir, we don't have that tequila anymore either).  Food was alright but service was a chore, and it wasn't very busy either.",UNK
2239,"Five stars for the red velvet pancakes alone. Plus we were served quickly even though the place was packed when we came in, which I took as a good sign. I will definitely be back here next time I'm in Vegas!",UNK

2241,Really good donuts and friendly service.   You can tell that each donut is baked with a dash of love.,UNK
2242,Good room for beginners. Not much else to say that hasn't been covered in all of the other reviews. I wouldn't play in this poker room if I weren't staying in this hotel. Great place to buy in cheap to just sit and get drunk.,UNK

2244,nice location. food prices high for portion sizes. swordfish strip was alright and the potato was undercooked. management was less than friendly. Didn't want to deal with what I had to say and it seemed like it was just brushing me off.,UNK
2245,Love this place! The pho is the best in the Valley. But I have tried appetizers and dinner entrees that weren't my favorites. Stick with the pho and you can't go wrong!,UNK
2246,"Below average standard of sushi and yakitori. The tempura was heavy. That said, service was friendly.",UNK
2247,"Other than the long wait this place bis awesome.  Always good salad, pizza and pasta.  Make sure to follow it up with a pizzoookie.",UNK
2248,Tasteless microwaved-like Mexican food. Just awful. We ordered tacos and they didn't even taste like real food. Not recommended unless you are really starving.,UNK
2249,"The service sucks. Nobody seemed to know how to speak English. Their dim sum isn't the best. I usually don't do reviews but if you really want dim sum and some service, don't go there. It's worth the drive to spring mountain.",UNK
2250,"If your out on Mill partying, you should definitely eat here once your done. You don't need another slice of pizza. You will thank yourself the next day.",UNK

2252,So so good. All the chicken dishes are great.,UNK
2253,"Wont be back. Ridiculously expensive, bad service, and tacky decor. Despite our waitress forgetting to bring drinks until we asked for them 20 minutes later, the food tasted good. Wish the portion sizes were bigger.",UNK
2254,"I'm traveling for some corporate training this week, so I had to have my business suit and a dress dry cleaned.  I have to say that they did a good job and were pretty prompt.  I've been very satisfied with this place in all the years I've been coming here.",UNK

2256,Can't miss stop for the best Fish Sandwich in Pittsburgh.,UNK
2257,"All i can say is rude!! They always seam bothered when you walk in and if you ask questions. $16 for a small bottle of juice, for that price i need better customer service! For now ill be shopping for my stuff somewhere else!",UNK
2258,"It's a chain, and its offerings are rarely changed. That said, the service was stellar, and my friend's low-salt needs were very nicely accommodated. Something for everyone; just a tad more expensive than non-chain Chinese restaurants (and yeah, they have sushi).",UNK
2259,"Southern food with a twist, very good location and ambience! Good food and great presentation, great place for lunch or brunch",UNK
2260,The worst service I ever saw !! Especially if you are not from USA. They just using the high rating on Yelp and do nothing to keep it. I recommend to go to Cabo Wabo instead.,UNK
2261,"I had lunch there and was really impressed.  I had the Tempura Udon which was alright, but nothing to get excited about.  The caterpillar roll was very good, but not enough to save the entire experience",UNK

2266,"Food is 4 stars, service restaurant 4, bar is 2.  Bartender is kind to locals, not south to the casual visitor.  Marten is best beer, wings are really good, specials keep it interesting, but food is wayyyyyyy overpriced.",UNK
2267,"Food was not bad, but not really good either.",UNK
2268,I love Settebello! Napoli style pizza rocks my socks off! Get the Diavola pizza if you like spicy! Mmmm,UNK

2273,"This place is horrible and I have never thrown up after eating breakfast. But yes as soon as we left, they got there breakfast back. Negative 5 stars.",UNK

2279,Just went their for the late night meal.  T-Bone steak for $9.99 you can bet that deal and it was 24 four hours.,UNK
2280,Sprouts is my number one go to store for all produce! The prices are always reasonable and the product is always in great shape. I gave it 4 instead of 5 because sometimes when I go the check out is very slow (I think it may be more the customers though).,UNK
2281,Do not get sushi here. It is 99% rice and 1% mediocre fish. The Thai food tastes alright though.,UNK
2282,"My prior review was 1 star about 60 days ago.  This time was remarkably better.  Server Deneice really knocked it out.  Kitchen runs a little slow there, so if they ever figure that out, they'll get to 5 stars",UNK
2283,Hair in my salad. No refills. Didn't ask how my food was or how my steak was cooked. Unpleasant waitress. Need I say more?,UNK
2284,"This is a nice place to visit, Rainforest cafe is a good eat but otherwise i wouldn't stay here. I have to be honest, I havent stayed here but the feel that I get from this place, i have definitely seen better in Vegas!!",UNK

2288,We came in with a business group of 10 people and the service was great and attentive to our needs. The sushi apps were tasty and the main dished were cooked to perfection. I have tasted better but it is a nice place to go to impress.,UNK
2289,Large selection and decent prices.  Only game in town now that Circuit City is closed.  Not a fan of the extended warranty/service contract they always push.,UNK
2290,"i've been here 3 times now, but i only come here on sundays to get the 1/2 off any steaks which is really good. i recommend the 18oz bone in rib eye cooked to your request.",UNK
2291,Good design for workday lunch - in and out in a few minutes. Food is okay.\n\nNo place to sit inside. Don't take American Express. Menu online is not 100% accurate to what they serve (maybe they rotate dishes).,UNK
2292,Pretty solid lunch. Everything was fresh and tasty. The guy who made my sandwich however was slow and even though I repeated what I wanted several times he forgot my green bell peppers.,UNK
2293,I tried the beef gyro and was so good and the chicken strips and hot wings all was good and great,UNK
2294,Pizza was burnt and clearly warmed up with some more cheese thrown on top.  Won't go back.,UNK

2298,I love starbucks coffee. Its good and not bad with the price. I just wish they offered Almond Milk! I want unsweetened almond milk lattes!,UNK
2299,Our favorite restaurant for steak.  This is one of few restaurants on the strip that I would recommend.  I'm usually one for variety but the filet mignon with red wine reduction is so good that I cannot bring myself to order anything else.,UNK
2300,Don't let Efrain run your credit card. He's a shady dude. Just refused me and my son 80 dollars is services because I didn't want him to cut my hair. I'm finally done with them.,UNK

2306,Service was excellent.  Only issue is our meals were way more salty than necessary. Wife loved the Blood Orange margarita.,UNK
2307,"I was very disappointed with this place had gone here in the past and loved it but this time they were rude , spilled my drink on my food as the refilled it never apologized when seated they just pointed to where we we're to sit just not the way it was with the old owners",UNK
2308,The go to spot for a nice frozen treat to combat the warm Vegas sun. \n\nIt's tourist prices.. but what isn't on the strip?\n\nAnd a big plus is they will fill any cup for a comparable price.,UNK
2309,Girl looked at me weird when I asked for Sicilian slice and I had to say square. They no have which is disappointing.  Plain cheese slice is good.,UNK
2310,Good place to walk about if you fancy a walk.,UNK
2311,Great place with a cool college vibe. The rolls are unique to the community and the service is awesome!\n\n$1.50 beers during happy hour!,UNK
2312,There store employee/manager kristin is not at all friendly. She acts like she's doing a million things instead of providing customer service.,UNK
2313,Cool lounge to sit and enjoy a drink!  The service was ok...would help if the waitress actually smiled and looked like she enjoyed being there!,UNK
2314,"This is the most overrated place in existence.  The menu is limited, the fries taste like cardboard, and the burgers are thin, thin scrawny little patties.  I don't get it, and I certainly don't eat there anymore",UNK
2315,The best. Love the furniture and the helpful  salesperson.  Very knowledgable.,UNK
2316,"The inside is very nice and clean, I will give them that. But there employees are not happy or nice. Food is hit or miss. Sometime they get it right sometimes they don't. The lines are usually long and take way too long.",UNK
2317,"Best food of it's kind around. I think I have tried everything they offer and it is all excellent. Especially the lamb/ beef shwarma.  The flavors are incredible.  Also, for espresso fans, try the turkish coffee.",UNK
2318,"CLOSED DOWN\nnot surprised considering it was at the same intersection with both Harris Tweeter and Food Lion.\n\nAlso shows how useful five star reviews based on a one time $2 purchase (water, sweet tea etc) are . Pfouie",UNK
2319,"Although the chicken teriyaki tasted decent, the service wasn't too great. The Thai tea sucked too, I had to take it back and it still wasn't good.",UNK
2320,ok food but most of it is frozen or canned and the ribs gave me the shits.,UNK
2321,Stopped in for a while before heading to the airport. Great deals on Tuesdays and pretty decent bar food. The bartender was super nice and engaging. It was in the middle of the day so I'm not sure how the night time scene is.,UNK
2322,Lenny was amazing!! Fixed my horrible eyelash job from somewhere else. Will be coming back!,UNK
2323,"This place is great. I'm a chef in Las Vegas and I know how hard it is to do breakfast well. They do it very very well! Food is healthy, flavorful and the staff and owners are top notch.",UNK
2324,RUDE. just got hung up on on the phone. Called back and was not able to get a finished sentence in. If you dont want to deal with customer service then dont open a bakery. duh.,UNK
2325,Wait times are awful and the service is horrendous. Food was mediocre at best.,UNK
2326,Absolutely nothing special about this place. Not worth a second visit. It is sad that best moderately priced Italian restaurant is Olive Garden.,UNK

2334,Best gyros (hard g) in Pittsburgh,UNK
2335,"Terrible! I threw the majority of my order away. The soup was inedible. The sushi turned my stomach. I'm still hoping I'm not going to get sick from this experience. \nThe service was fast, though.",UNK
2336,Joe has been my property manager for over 4 years. We have been extremely happy with the service we have received.

2338,"over-rated, air-inflated garbage.",UNK

2346,Tucked into ye olde Litchfield Park is one of the best sushi joints in the valley that has not only the freshest fish but the most excellent chef .,UNK

2348,"Only certain cuts of steak is USDA PRIME or A5 kobe.  For about the same price head to Mastro's... much better quality steak. At this price range, USDA prime should be the min level of beef served.",UNK
2349,Nothing better than a bunch of pizza to ease a night of debauchery. Decent cheap pizza by the slice in New York or Sicilian styles and a decent cannolli.,UNK
2350,This is a solid neighborhood place.  My BBQ brisket was very good.  Always friendly service here at the bar.,UNK
2351,"I always wanted to try the Rio buffet.  Finally got a chance to go.  The food is not that great, but teppanyaki is the bomb!",UNK

2353,mechanical bull + random really drunk people = a whole lotta fun,UNK
2354,"Yuck! Do yourself a favor and go out of your way to find a Chipotle or Qdoba, they are SOOOOO much better. Chicken looked processed and was cold, the veggies were mushy and the rice they use sucks. Stay away.",UNK
2355,"The frozen hot chocolate was very good! I had the meatball parmesan pizza which was ok. My hubbie had the mac n cheese which was very good but super rich. All in all, pretty good but expensive for what you are getting.",UNK
2356,"Good juice, good prices.",UNK
2357,"The seats may be comfy and the pricing better than AMC but this particular Harkins patrons are kind of in the ghetto, really sticky floors and loudmouthed people every time we go here to try and enjoy a movie. Better off sticking to Chandler Fashion over this one.",UNK
2358,Very disorganized. Hard to get anyone to call you back within a reasonable time frame. Never again.,UNK
2359,Manager felt bad last time my friend and I came and offered us a drink. Nice gesture but still...,UNK

2361,I love this place as they take bets on Major League Soccer. They even had bets for the US Open Cup which I did not expect at all. They also have prop bets for NFL for those of you interested.,UNK
2362,The regular rooms are a bit smaller than other hotels that I've stayed in.  Try to request for upper floors and away from the main building.  It could get pretty noisy.,UNK
2363,Love to rock climb... But the staff at this gym were extremely rude and impatient! Won't be going back here because of them,UNK
2364,"So so so damn good, I can't wait to go back for more! The location is in a residential neighborhood which is a little weird but like I said the food is so damn good you don't care about the location.",UNK
2365,"Short, but fun course... worth the green fee! Friendly staff. No driving range.",UNK
2366,Don't waste your time and money like I did. Look up mark fugit orthodics. He custom makes them for your feet at less than 200! I'll never get my money back on a product that helped minimally and made other parts numb.,UNK

2370,"Had dinner on Saturday, June 16.  The service was extremely slow and unattentive for server follow up or refils.  Considering the restaurant is part of a major Marriott Resort, the food was well below average for the prices charged.  I would not recommend this restaurant.",UNK
2371,Pulled pork was great! Do know that when you say you want the large portion you are going to get a huge portion. Service was spectacular with at least four people asking if I needed anything else. They also call you sweetie and honey like a true southern restaurant,UNK
2372,I go out of my way to work for this location! The employees are fast and friendly. Great way to start the morning!,UNK
2373,"Nice enough furniture. Salesmen pretty friendly. Not the highest end furniture but as the saying goes, \""you get what you pay for\"".",UNK
2374,Good steak burritos and tacos.,UNK

2381,My sister likes the hot wings...  They were ok considering they are from a sports bar deli.,UNK
2382,Everything was great! i couldn't believe they had roasted bone marrow you can't find that in any buffet. I would of given it five stars if they had oysters and crab legs. Overall i will definitely be returning back to the wicked spoon.,UNK
2383,"I like the place, but it's a bit pricey and selection is a little limited after going to the Yogurtini up the road a few times.  At least the selection of yogurts tends to cycle more so than the other place.",UNK
2384,The service was SLOW. I ordered a toasted bagel with cream cheese. I found a piece of plastic inside the bagel. Yuck!,UNK
2385,One of the best bbq joints in Charlotte. I had the bbq sandwich...simply amazing. Fries and fried pickles were good too. Definitely will return.,UNK
2386,Bingo is really cheap here the bingo attendants call the numbers differently sometimes slow but mostly way to fast. Pay out is good though for the prices. I would probably come here again if i was in the area,UNK

2388,"Amazing food and great service.  I highly reccomend sitting at the counter on your first visit so you can watch the food being prepared.  If you're into great tasting food then this is your place.  If you get the chance try the leaks, they're fantastic.",UNK

2404,"I dropped off a script and was told they would send a text when it was ready. 4 hrs later I go pick it up just to find out they never processed it. So while they fill it last minute, I go to purchase soup and get told they are closed! Sick and pissed!",UNK
2405,Great atmosphere! Great food! What an awesome way to spend a late Sunday afternoon in the sun.  Outside patio is worth the wait.,UNK

2420,"Boy how things have changed.  The staff and menu are the same, but the way the food is prepared is completely different (not in a good way) and the service has become very slow.\n\nI'm not sure what happened, by I hope they get their act together.",UNK

2429,Pretty cool coffee shop. This is definitely the place to go for getting work done (or in my case grading papers) and is VERY student friendly. The food is really good and pretty much made in house but I have to say is quite over priced.,UNK
2430,Nothing that outstanding.,UNK
2431,"A cool department store with some great options for all price-points.  Very similar to Macy's in the US, they have a good variety of items for different styles.  They also can have some incredible sales.",UNK

2437,I was at this location And I have never waited longer for three cars to to be served. Molly the attendant was so slow I wanted to kill myself,UNK

2440,"Sunday Brunch was really nice.  Not over the top, but well worth the $13.  Will go again.",UNK

2442,"I adore Trader Joe's and everything they have to offer. This location, however, needs to grow! It's pretty small and the parking lot is crowded and hectic. I wish TJ's would expand to a bigger location. Staff is awesome, however.",UNK
2443,Decided to try China King based on Yelp reviews and was extremely disappointed.\n\nThe food was very ho-hum and the restaurant had a terrible fishy odor.  Not impressed at all.,UNK

2454,"Bad attitudes and rude behavior from both employees, one was the manager. I'll be avoiding this McD's from here on out.",UNK

2456,YUMMY! The pasta was very well done. The shrimp were larger than I expected and blended well with the cheese sauce. Definitely better than Olive Garden any day of the year.,UNK
2457,"Big disappointment.  I was expecting quality food.  The food was average.  Variety is not.  Service was bad.  Even the dessert did not taste good for us.  Price was very expensive.  I would have rather gone to Golden Corral (a bit exaggerated but given difference in prices, I would).",UNK
2458,"Uh-maze-ing!!! Originally from michigan now living in Seattle visiting family in phoenix. Came in, to visit family and HAD to come in to check it out. Great service friendly welcome line out the door the entire experience.",UNK
2459,"Perfect, right on St. Catherine's.  Summer outside, with a BYOB, plenty of SAC (liquor stores) close by. Nice food, good service, right on prices.....overall totally worth a visit !",UNK

2462,"I can't believe I've waited this long....simple, hearty, delicious.  This place is a winner.",UNK
2463,Gone to Sushi time several times and have never left that not feeling satisfied. The atmosphere is nice and cozy. The sushi is pretty damn good given it's economic price. Go to this place during happy hour and you can get hot sake!,UNK
2464,Seems like this place isen't a good place to have drinks?  My friend that lives in Vegas was going to take me their for happy hour. MMMM going to have to rethink about it.,UNK
2465,Nice place.really busy so very hard to get appt. Or walk in. Clean and friendly. Hope it slows down so I cam get in more often. How do they remember everyone's name?! Lol,UNK

2467,"Lot's of Tony's around, this one is good food, but after many tries, I prefer other locations. Sad because this is very close to me. Seems there may have been a management change recently and this location has slipped a bit more.",UNK
2468,The lady here was super nice. I really liked this spot as a breakfast joint. Everyone knew each other - the food was okay but the atmosphere made it up. It it is in a rinky dink area but I would still check it out again when I am in vegas.,UNK

2470,absolutely loved this place.  I had the brisket and my wife had the ribs.  bother were very good.  Desert came with the meal and was quite tasty.  Great place to eat.,UNK
2471,"I festival dedicated to Ostriches and only two Ostriches, really?  This was a typical fair.  Over crowded with middle and high schooler's, people bumping into you, long ass lines and breathing in dirt.  Why anyone would think this would be fun is beyond me.",UNK

2477,"It's by far the worst service EVER! this company needs to fire their management first of all. 2nd, it's Christmas, don't have only 3 servers on the floor. Didn't even get any drinks. Never coming back or recommending this place to ANYONE",UNK

2480,"Came here on a Monday at 4pm, place was graveyard and seemed dirty. Service mediocre as was the burger, then had a rotten French Fry and lost my appetite. Wanted to try something new, which was a mistake, will never spend my hard earned money here again!!",UNK
2481,Love the selection and prices! Employess are very helpful!  Everything is always fresh and of the highest quality!\n\nUnlike other grocery stores or specialty supermarkets Sprouts is king in my book!,UNK
2482,"My wife and I wanted to like this small busy place but just could not. VERY poor service -- we ordered 4 items and only got 2 due to waiter and kitchen SNAFUs. Food was mediocre. Keep moving, nothing to see here.",UNK
2483,"The mushroom goat cheese quesadilla is so yummy and a respectable amount of food. The sangria was delicious, albeit a bit pricey. The churros with chocolate sauce are totally worth saving room for! The patio atmosphere is really nice as well.",UNK
2484,Food was amazing and the price isn't bad. Served super hot. Definitely will eat again when back on this side of town.,UNK
2485,THEY STILL CANNOT GET MY ORDER RIGHT!!! Why is mcdonalds food like crack?  Hate the service  but cannot stay away!!!,UNK

2491,Outstanding service great food and a unique atmosphere. We had sandwiches and cookies and they were excellent. Great prices too. This one was worth the drive,UNK
2492,"Great prices on quality merchandise. Much better than similar discount stores, i.e. TJ Maxx, Marshalls. An easy place to walk into with no intention of buying anything, and leaving a few hundred dollars lighter. Caveat emptor.",UNK
2493,"Love this place. My family and I come here when ever we can. My two boys just love the butchers block, and the cheese plank. Their happy hour deal is awesome too $5 pitchers. The outside patio is also fun to hang out and relax.",UNK
2494,My wife and I have visited St. Anthony's Chapel three time so far and every time the experience is a moving one.  I would recommend the guided tour.  The amount of relics contained in the chapel is amazing.  If you a person of faith this is a wonderful place.,UNK
2495,LA Jolla Salad is huge! Their salad dressings are great. The sliders looked great as well. They are generous with portions and the service was excellent. Extensive menu that can feed even the pickiest eaters.,UNK
2496,Molto bene!!!,UNK
2497,"Overpriced movies and food, its your average movie theatre really.",UNK
2498,"Try the \""cave-aged\"" Marissa. This cheese alone earn 5 stars. \n\nThe only unfortunate part is the location. I wish they consider moving the store to Madison so that more people can sample many of their award winning cheeses.",UNK
2499,"Alright to hang out once in a while, music is alright only because they actually play a variety of different bands, staff is friendly, drinks are good, haven't tried the food yet, but who needs food when there's beer",UNK

2503,I love this nail spa.  I have always had great service here and they do a good job.  Prices are very reasonable. They recently expanded the salon and the place is very clean and modern. They do a great job with gel nails (no bubbles) and usually get me in and out pretty quickly.,UNK
2504,"Pretty to very good. Pita could have been heated better, and an additional $2 is a bit steep for substitute salad over fries. Salad could have had more feta too. Plastic and styrofoam everything detracts from the overall experience, but I'll be back.",UNK
2505,The food is only a one star. It's usually burnt when you get it. The service is two stars. Slow service even when not busy. A lot of TV's and great interior. I just wish the owners would bump up food and service.,UNK
2506,Worst wait staff and management i have ever experienced in my life!!! Kinda feels like a retirement home.,UNK
2507,Not too much for a gf person to have here. I had a salad.,UNK
2508,"Terrible. Their maids do not speak English and when you tell them to clean for an hour they charge you for 4 hours. They used dirty water to mop the floors, were extremely loud when cleaning the blinds and they lie on the phone and imply you are a liar.",UNK
2509,Our 1 hour drive to Tempe for NCounter was worth every penny.  Great value for the $$$.  Very inexpensive meals with friendly/helpful staff.,UNK
2510,"not worth the price.\nThe Spa is great and quiet, but rooms are just ok and a distance from the pool casino, etc.\nWill stay in Mandalay Bay next time",UNK
2511,Great concept! \n\nDefinitely worth the try !,UNK
2512,"This place is small, but it doesn't appear to ever be crowded, and the small crowd that was there seemed to turn over frequently.  The music was decent and the service was good.  If you have a large group and are looking for a place without a large crowd, this might be the place.",UNK
2513,I'm not a fan but I enjoy drinking at the bar area. So if you're coming to drink ... not so bad. If you're coming to eat ...  ah you might think again!,UNK
2514,it's kind of over rating. The food is good but not  4-star food,UNK
2515,I'm not sure who is going to win in the Civil War of the amazing flavor that just came from that pizza I loved it every minute of it,UNK

2517,"Hired these guys to clean our windows for my business, they missed two appointments I had made with them. The first seemed like a misunderstanding but we had agreed upon them returning a month later, when the day came they were no were to be seen.",UNK
2518,Make reservations. this place had a line out the door. The Taxi driver even said it was his favorite restaurant. the Walnut shrimp was great,UNK
2519,Ordered at 8:12pm.  It is now 10:02pm and no food. Awful. Do not order.  Unless you want to wait for 2 hours and not get your food.,UNK
2520,The lines are outrageous   Avoid this place. You'll save ten bucks but lose your mind in the process. Going back to Hertz!!,UNK
2521,I love kneaders- I really do. But DO NOT go through the drive-thru if you are in a hurry. I would say average wait time is 10 minutes. \n\nMy only complaint- other than that keep on keeping on Kneaders!,UNK
2522,"Cool marina style bar, however the food is seriously lacking.  Can't stress this enough, a $10 burger should be something special. Go for a HH drink and grab In-N-Out on the way home.",UNK
2523,"Great atmosphere and a departure from the mundane. If you're looking for some unique dishes filled great entertainment, this is the place to go in Old Montreal. Order the duck confite, and maple whisky cider drink and be stuffed!",UNK
2524,Another country restaurant/bar option if you want to head north...,UNK
2525,Best when you need to escape the madness for good pizza!,UNK
2526,"Totally a wonderful place, great restaurants, shops, and everything conveniently located around you. :) enjoy! :)",UNK

2528,Not very good. They were sloppy.,UNK
2529,"Transplant from the northeast. Tried the General Tso's, sauce was more like teriyaki and chicken was overcooked. My 11 year old loves Chinese and I got this at 7 pm so he was pretty hungry, had about 3 bites and was done. Look elsewhere.",UNK
2530,Really good food. Good service and fairly prompt seating. Had the crepes and the wife had a dutch baby. Both were really tasty. This is our second time here and will definitly come again.,UNK
2531,"Called this location prior to visit, the boy that answered the phone was so rude we didn't even want to go. Food is good so we gave 2 stars.",UNK
2532,The patient service here is extremely slow. \nThe wait time exceeds one hour. Dr. Fredrick  Lippman has  challenges with accessibility.,UNK
2533,Best buffet/restaurant I've been to in awhile.. Food was awesome. Can't wait to go back. Sooo rooting for this place to succeed. Then the east side would finally have a decent place to eat. Love it:),UNK
2534,"This was my 1st show in Vegas, it was soooo worth the $$$ !!! I like how this cirque show doesn't travel and is particular to Vegas! Make sure you are in center, 1st or 2nd level for best seats! A-mazing performers!",UNK
2535,"Urban Wax is fantastic! Super clean, professional, knowledgeable and friendly. A little more expensive, but worth every penny! I will totally pay a little more for fabulous eyebrows! Ask for Allison, she's the best!",UNK
2536,I am in love with this place. The cupcakes are amazing and the service is outstanding. Ive been in about three times and every time I  was treated like family. I will forever be a customer because of the quality and the service.,UNK
2537,I order from Beijing about once a week. The delivery is very quick and the food is always hot! Ask for the spicy chicken soup if you have a cold! Food is great! And I've seen the owner at Sprouts getting fresh produce.,UNK
2538,"I love in-n-out but this is one of their busier stores that I have been to! The food was good but service wasn't exactly \""in-n-out\"".",UNK
2539,"One 4-lettered \""F\"" word sums up this place: FAIL\n\nThe only thing even remotely Hawaiian about this place is the Polynesian dancing, but even then, they do Tahitian, not hula. Weak.",UNK
2540,The italian food was definitely the best try the meat balls yummm... Generic buffet food but definitely better than most by far and super cheap for only 10 bucks,UNK
2541,Very good food and very friendly staff.  Really enjoy the sandwiches for lunch time.  They have an outdoor patio which is nice when the weather is good.,UNK
2542,The Bartenders Suck---\nAt least the few i experienced...\nOtherwise I LOVE THE PLACE\nDid i mention the Bartenders Suck?,UNK
2543,Saw on triple DDD. Pizza is best in town. Suicide fries were good but not as hot as I had hoped. Will be back again.,UNK
2544,"This place just keeps going downhill every year, seems half the retail spots are empty and even the strip malls surrounding it are dying. Not sure what they can do to save this place but as it is now there is little reason to visit besides the theater.",UNK
2545,Avoid unless you just want to hang out. Def not a 'good' dinner place,UNK
2546,it is almost ok for lunch. not expensive\uff0c nice environment. But the kinds of dishes provided is not too much.,UNK
2547,"domino's wings were horrible, extremely small and fatty all around.",UNK
2548,"This place is pretty cool for a dive, love that you have options for DJ inside and live band outside, nickel beer is awesomely crazy they could do .50 beers and it would still be a hit.  I like the bartenders here will definitely have to come back",UNK
2549,Hit and miss menu options.  Always enjoy the hot sour soup and Kung Pao Scallops and Shrimp.  Edgy atmosphere and cool bathrooms if you have the urge.\n\nUsed to be a unique dining experience but now food is predictable and unspectacular.,UNK
2550,"Great selection, as one would exxpect from a Bath and Body Works.\n\nBut even better than that, great people.  They are always so helpful.  I will always come to this location.",UNK
2551,"Typical bar ... nothing special.  Bartenders are really friendly though.  Ordered a glass of wine and attempted to enjoy it, but some guy was smoking a cigar behind me, so that's all I could focus on.",UNK
2552,Pretty standard Caribou location.  It's larger than the Matthews location on 51 and has more seating (inside and out).  There's also a electric fireplace.\n\nService at this location is generally fast and attentive.,UNK
2553,This place was mediocre at best. The customer service was terrible. I could barely tell who was working there and who wasn't.,UNK
2554,I spent way too long here today to figure what I needed to get for goodie bags. Not that it was a bad thing I just couldn't decide they had so much to choose from.\nThey have good stuff for a $1 compared to the $.99 store.,UNK
2555,"I've been to @sambalatte once and I effing love this place!  Great atmosphere, service and product!\n\nI stay nearby with some regularity and I am already looking forward to a return trip to this place.\n\nCool coffeehouse here!",UNK
2556,"I used to love coming to foxy nails, and Missy was my nail tech, but they changed management and now it is horrible.  It is not clean anymore, the person running the front desk is rude and the clientele has changed dramatically.  I am in search of a new salon definitely!",UNK

2561,Awesome shoe selection!!,UNK
2562,RUDe!!!!!,UNK
2563,"Their attitude sucks.  They never say hello or thank you, very miserable people and still behaving like they are in their flicking old country.  NO class.  My experience was with the old man.  I will shop there till I find another place since I am new in Vegas!",UNK
2564,Worst service I ever had in Vegas. Waiter is rude and we waited more than half hour to even get the water. The steak we ordered was midium but had a well done steak which is disgusting! Will never come back. EVER!,UNK
2565,Normal cheap hotel. Needs to be updated but very clean and fine especially for the price range. Was able to get the room for $75 for off nights and they did offer a military discount on prime nights for $84. 5 minute drive to hospital and close to multiple restaurants and bars.,UNK
2566,I had lunch menu.\nNothing special and their food is too oily.,UNK
2567,Great atmosphere and good first date place. Try the bruschetta it was awesome. Menu simple but very good!,UNK

2572,"Cool idea, a place to have a drink and play arcade games.  Its kinda small, not much room to play while others are walking around (drunk).  Watch the dress code, too strict for me.  Would rather forget about the drinks and just go to the Pinball Hall of Fame.",UNK
2573,Fabulous meal.  We shared the pate appetizer.  I had the roast chicken and my friend had mussels.  We shared the chocolate mousse for dessert.  It was all so good and our waiter was terrific.  Definitely worth it.,UNK
2574,Nothing really special. I've tried better. Everything was too sweet.  Waste of money. Service was just okay.,UNK
2575,MY fav !,UNK

2583,"In my opinion, Tin Tin has gone downhill over the past years. Food not as tasty and diverse as it once was, and many items were not hot, even though I was there at the lunch hour peak. The iced tea tasted like instant. For $12, I expect better.",UNK

2585,I love Windsor style backyard burger with the side of Mac and cheese! Must have. Cool vibez,UNK

2587,"Had the Chicken Fried Steak... Oh man talk about Yum!   This place does it right,  fast friendly service,  reasonable prices.. They have all the bases coveted and they been doing it a long  time.   It's difficult to please this critic but they did.",UNK

2598,Great take out spot conveniently located in the Latta Arcade. Never takes more than 5 minutes to get my food even during the lunch rush. Pricing could be a dollar cheaper in my opinion but the bourbon chicken special is fantastic.,UNK
2599,I would never go here again though they have a vast amount of different flavored wings as I tried 5 different flavors none were too appetizing if you happen to find yourself check out the salt n pepper wings they were different I've never seen that flavor before as a wing contra sore,UNK

2602,"The guys at this barbershop are great, clean cutz and good vibes.Always playing good music.They get busy make sure to set appointment",UNK
2603,This place is so fake it's sickening- the server Cindy is phony. Jose is a dick - and the owner- couldn't make the time to take my credit card. The salad dressing was tasteless and the Osso Bucco was just okay.,UNK
2604,My go to delivery Chinese spot..from that category you gotta know what to expect but the Wok definitely steps it up over any other delivery place that I know of in the area.,UNK
2605,We purchased the 3-day pass for $20 each. It took us up and down the strip as many times as we wanted!! Worth the buy to get around the strip!!!!,UNK

2611,"Decent haircuts, affordable pricing. They always cut your hair shorter than you ask! Staff seems miserable, except the one guy who is chatty. I don't mind someone quiet cutting my hair, I really don't need to chat while getting my hair cut. Overall 3/5.",UNK
2612,Dirty change room.,UNK
2613,Disappointed. Went yesterday with my son for the first time. Started in the shoe section. Within a few minutes I had been shoved twice. Wow. Manners people.  I did find a Michael Kors shrug for a great price but I will probably not go back.,UNK

2616,Asshole driver bilked me by charging $2. upon entry to McCarran Airport. The fee is only for leaving. What a cunt.,UNK
2617,It was ok.  Not as fancy as it sounded on the website.  The service was decent.  I would have figured the server would have asked what wine I'd like with my steak but the subject never came up.,UNK
2618,"Happy hour is great and the bartenders rock!! If you're going, find a seat at the bar...best service and a view of the passer-bys on the strip makes for good people watching.",UNK
2619,OUTSTANDING drove for 45 min and will do it many times more great food the mac and cheese along with the baked beens best i've ever had...If getting Brisket get sandwich instead of plate much better.,UNK

2622,I highly recommend the beef bowl entree and iced almond milk tea if it's your first visit and don't want to get something you're unsure of. The brick toast is also something yummy to try out.,UNK
2623,I showed up at the drive up window with no answer: first at the speaker and then at the window and I know they were open. I guess they just don't like customers here.,UNK
2624,Clean theaters and bathrooms with many movie options to choose from.\n\nDo park on the West side of Red Rock Casino as the theater is quite far from the East parking garage.\n\nEnjoyed the movie Interatellar on IMAX with family.,UNK

2636,"Amazing food, service, ambiance, as well as gluten free knowledge and options. Highly recommend! I will likely become a regular!",UNK
2637,Great grocery store for halal meat and what not. The restaurant is better for take out food as there is very limited room to eat there.,UNK
2638,Ok neighborhood-vibe restaurant. Food was typical of a greasy spoon. Or maybe I'm just from LA and have higher standards. The oysters were just ok. Even those felt somewhat...'greasy'.,UNK
2639,Great Brats!,UNK

2645,"Asian food for white people.  Not terrible but very, very bland.",UNK
2646,"A lot of times Thai noodle dishes feel heavy to me.  The noodle dishes we had here were surprisingly light and just as flavorable.  We had 3 dishes for 4 people, under 45$ after tip/tax for dinner seemed like a great deal!",UNK

2652,Good for Lunch,UNK
2653,"A decent Thai restaurant off the strip.  The  decor was sparse, the wait staff pre-occupied,  the portions were modist and the prices on the high side for Thai.  We had Pad Thai, a Duck curry that tasted wonderful and a Northern Thai dish that was simple but nice.",UNK
2654,"30-45 minute wait, food didn't live up to the hype. The nice thing about it is that it has sports book",UNK
2655,Truly a horrible experience. Everything was rushed with very little professionalism. Never coming back here again with my gf. :(,UNK
2656,"Walked in after not being able to go to another restaurant. Was nice surprise because expected food not to be good.  It was good authentic Chinese food.   It wasn't the best Chinese food I've had,  but the service was better than most Chinese restaurants.",UNK

2660,"Not sure what expectations people have with these chain establishments like Subway; however, I don't find a great difference between this location and others enough to count for much. The staff is great here and the sandwiches are just like any subway sandwich that I have ever had across this country.",UNK
2661,"Cheap, but in a shady spot. The food wasn't exactly mom's quality,  but the options are good.",UNK
2662,Kenne das El Taquito schon Seit \u00fcber zehn Jahren. Es ist und bleibt der beste Mexikaner in der Gegend.,UNK
2663,Pricing is way too extreme.,UNK
2664,Believe the reviews. Terrible customer service. Expect to wait at least an hour to checkin.... Don't be fooled by the cheap price. Pay the extra money and rent elsewhere.,UNK
2665,This Starbuck's is friendly and fast. Everything is always made perfect and consistent. They know what they are doing here and are happy. You can tell when the staff are happy where they work.,UNK

2671,Not worth it!,UNK
2672,Bad food. Dirty. I feel like I got scabies after eating there. Flys everywhere.  Disgusting!,UNK
2673,"An \""old fashioned\"" comedy club, the Riv offers talented comedians in a club atmosphere that looks like it hasn't been updated since the Johnson Administration.  The Riv loses a star for the uncomfortable chairs- surely, these antiques violate the Geneva Convention!",UNK

2685,Overpriced. Dry cupcakes. Waxy bland frosting.,UNK
2686,Great service.  Car is always clean inside and out. And they are fast.,UNK
2687,Leave lots of time if you are using a rental car!  The rental car center is quite far from the airport and you have to wait for the shuttle.  No tram or alternate routes means at least 20 minute process.,UNK
2688,Walked in and I was greatly by their friendly stAff. It is a very clean staff and Dr.Roach gave us a personal tour. He is great with my Rottweiler. She loved him and I was impressed...I recommend this place to everyone..,UNK

2691,The best Jewish Delli in the northeast Vally. The Cloak &. Dagger gets it today!,UNK
2692,Every time that I bring my vehicles into your dealership I receive excellent service. Chris Bates is a very knowledgeable service adviser listens to me and makes sure that my vehicles are checked for any maintenance that they require. He and Jason Briggs are the main reasons that I keep coming back to your dealership.,UNK
2693,"Overall very good, clean and busy. They had a lot of maki roll options but they are mostly tempura based fried in some way. But I did have the grasshopper roll and the seaweed salad on top was a good flavor addition",UNK
2694,Pho is fine but the soup is not even close to 'warm'. I would give this place 4 stars if soup would be hotter.,UNK
2695,Best Gluten Free Yogurt around- can be found at Zen Zen.  If you want unique flavors and healthy choices then visit Zen Zen Yogurt in Phoenix on Indian School near Pita Jungle.  And they have the BEST Vanilla in town don't forget to sample it.,UNK
2696,Great idea for Korea/Mexican fusion.  Korean burrito tastes great along with the korean tacos.  I gave them 3 stars because service is so-so.  I've been here multiple times and I am never impressed by the waitress/owners attitude.,UNK

2699,Just what you want for breakfast Home baking especially the brownies. Loved the sausage provolone wrap,UNK
2700,You can't go wrong with a little Cracker Barrel. I got the chicken fried steak and it was great. My friend had the pecan pancakes and I don't really like pecans.. But they were tasty!,UNK
2701,"Great service, amazing food and a fun time. The All You Can Eat sushi is the best deal in town. The craftsmanship of the rolls is superb. We will be coming back in the near future. Sushi 22, Yaaaaassssss!!!",UNK

2703,RM Seafood is so overrated. I was really disappointed with the food. It is the equivalent of an average seafood restaurant back in the Boston area. I have heard such great thing about Rick Moonen's restaurants. This place is overpriced average food.,UNK
2704,The onion rigs/fries combo is great -- they have excellent onion rings!!  I always get a bacon cheeseburger and it's always great!  The choices of toppings is pretty extensive.  I love that they have chocolate soda there - such a throwback :),UNK

2709,"Awesome show, worth the $$.  Truly funny guy- tell he likes to laugh at himself and others!  The theater was smaller than I expected but fit his style and could actually see him. We will DEFINITELY see him again.",UNK
2710,Always packed but i dont really like their music selection and the way the stage and dance area is set up. slippery  and dirty. always drunk people standing on tables and spilling beer. everything is sticky,UNK
2711,Great place to watch the game. The food is bar food in quality and selection.,UNK
2712,"Coming from NYC originally, it should be illegal for a place like this to be allowed to use my city's name. Instead how 'bout they change it to Pittsburgh because the food really is the Pitts (no offense to all you from Pittsburgh, sorry.)",UNK
2713,Amazing sushi and great staff! I can not wait to go again. My 5 year old son loved everything we ordered and the sushi was fresh and delicious. I recommend this restaurant to anyone in the area!!,UNK

2715,"We had a great wonderful time at Macaroni.  We ordered the tasting menu which was so much fun, flavorful and exciting.  Would highly recommend it.  Kristin the manager came over to make sure everything was awesome and it was!!",UNK

2723,"Rude staff members. No communication between \""people in charge\"" and the other employees. Not willing to accommodate or admit they were wrong. A group of 18 of us know that we will not be retuning.",UNK
2724,Not what I was expecting. I was told that this was a great place and what I ordered was not worth the money. The service was ok. Will not be going back.,UNK

2742,Worst. Rude. Horrible quality. All they do is talk crap when u ask them to fix THEIR mistakes. Never go here.,UNK
2743,"Great food, great environment. Burgers are great but the FRIES and SHAKES rock the party that rock the body!!!\n\nWe have been going there for about 9 months and have never been disappointed.",UNK
2744,"The cookies come out of a rubbermaid bucket which isn't that appetizing.  Then the taste is less so.  I get the old-school Mill Ave charm, but these guys need to bring their A-game.",UNK
2745,What a wonderful experience. The wait staff was friendly and quite helpful. The waiter recommended my new favorite wine. The ambiance is sophisticated but yet casual. The food was delectable and the presentation quite stunning.,UNK
2746,I love cinnabon. This one is an ok one.  Mostly everything gets baked fresh about every half hour. The service is ok and the workers aren't to friendly but I don't care I just want the cinnabon.,UNK
2747,"Nice restaurant. Met both the husband and wife team. Very friendly. The food was good, and the service was great. I will eat there again.",UNK
2748,We went to Shucks for the first time yesterday for breakfast.The food was delicious! My husband had the crab and lobster omelette and it was sooooo good! The prices are great and the service was great! We will definitely be going back :),UNK
2749,Shady cabs. Left my phone in cab. Offered $20 for him to bring it back 5 mins after being dropped off; he responded $50. Sure ok...,UNK
2750,Great Teppanyaki Place had this chef named Daniel San . Best Show I have ever seen on a teppanyaki table and awesome food too. He said he has show #1 - 4  and always thinks about new things to do.. I recommend you ask for him if you go here.,UNK
2751,I love that everything here is so cheap in bulk. My only complaint is that they have far less items then you would see at a grocery store.,UNK
2752,"Nothing much to say about this restaurant. Its next to the a slot machines, it's cheap but the food is not particularly good.\n\nIt's OK if you're really hungry!",UNK
2753,"GREAT ! Burgers  fresh fresh fresh   and I like the way to put your own topping on.  great flavor and 3 sizes to chose from and double it if you want.   Had the jalapeno poppers they were great as well.  we will be back, many times!",UNK
2754,This place used to be great except their service has always been terrible. \nSo I started to just pick up my food to go but now their food is getting bad too! \nTheir desserts are the only thing saving this place.\nSuch a shame,UNK
2755,"In most cities The Mirage would stand out, but aside from its central location there is really not much 'special' about this property on Las Vegas Boulevard.  Certainly a fine hotel and cheaper than some depending on deals and discounts, but bargain travelers can stay cheaper and luxury travelers would likely be let down.",UNK
2756,Always good food here.....great to get in and out of waiting on a flight.\nHave never had a bad meal and the service has been really qick,UNK
2757,The quality and taste is amazing however a plate for one waffle was 11 dollars I sure will go again if the add more food to there plates,UNK
2758,Great when it's good but tends to be uneven.,UNK
2759,Very average food and slow service during our recent Sunday lunch. My salad was soaked in dressing and rather plain.\n\nRestaurant in a shopping mall.,UNK
2760,Decent Japanese food. Pretty much crappy service the last 3 or 4 times I've been there. Too bad.,UNK
2761,This place has decent coverage of the games. Waited what seemed like for 50 minutes for nachos. Let's get it together.,UNK
2762,Not really impressed. Paid 14.75 for two plain yogurts split flavored with no toppings. Which was mediocre at best.  They price the yogurt with a scale. I'll stick to ice cream :P. You are pretty much paying for the atmosphere here.,UNK
2763,"In comparison to Chandler Gringos, I like this one much less. It was DEAD on a Friday night and nothing special going on with pricing. We got a drink and bounced out to the next place.",UNK
2764,"The good:\n- they have pizza\n\nThe  bad\n- used to be clean.\n- tables, floor, trays are dirty\n- pricey",UNK
2765,I love it I didn't like shrimp before and now at boiling crab it changed. I love the shrimp the favor is so good I can have a bucket of it. The chicken wings are delicious! And the fries and rice is so good! I love the Boiling Crab,UNK
2766,The 3 course combo is a great deal!!! Cheap filling and downtown. You even get chocolate chip cookies. Sundae bar is still in a BATHTUB- \nbring a party- there's room for it and no one here.. people forget about it.,UNK
2767,A little disappointed.  We did the tasting menu which was okay.  When I reflect on it now the most memorable entrees were the octopus salad and the dessert.,UNK
2768,"I wouldn't review a Walgreens if only for the fact to let you know that this is not a 24hr location. The nearest is at Dobson & Warner and they also have a Redbox. This one does, but again they are only open until 10 pm.",UNK
2769,Our seats were shaking from people walking past our table next to the handicap ramp and the food wasn't the best quality. Crab legs were dry and the fruit looked like it was sitting out too Long. There are much better buffet deals in Vegas.,UNK
2770,This is a dive bar.  We were killing time before a wedding receoption and this place was next to where the reception was going to be held.  I would not recommend this place to anyone.  It's just not my thing.  It's old and dark.,UNK
2771,Nice theater in a nice casino.  Staff overall is okay.,UNK
2772,"This sandwich shop was not what I was expecting. Although it was a quality sandwich with a great taste, the price was too much. The portions were so small for a sandwich so expensive. The great taste is overruled by the ridiculous price of a sandwich.",UNK
2773,"Lines out the door, the staff was sort of friendly. The patrons, not so much. Dirty is a nice way of describing the tables and chairs we sat at. I didn't want to put my kid in the one high chair they had because it was so sticky and gross.",UNK
2774,"I love the cookies and cupcakes here!  I have been visiting this place for a couple years now, and it just keeps getting better!\n\nDuring the summer, don't miss out on their ice cream sandwiches :)",UNK
2775,This place is awesome!  The service was perfect and the food was phenominal!  I also like that the manager came to the table to see how our food was and if we were happy.  I will definitely return to this restaurant!,UNK
2776,Excellent pizza. I really loved the meatball pizza. \nHighly recommend.,UNK
2777,Closed bankrupt,UNK
2778,"Great selection of beers, something for everyone. My favorite is the Kilt Lifter. Beautiful patio area and inside you feel like you are part of the brewery. At times you can see them crafting the fine beers. Four Peaks also offers great food too.",UNK
2779,This is a nice arena. It is small enough that there is not really a bad seat. The seats are more spacious than your average arena or stadium. There is plenty of parking and the lot is easily accessible off of Swenson St.,UNK
2780,Awesome atmosphere!! Went here with a Groupon Now and loved it. The food was good. They were really flexible with the bill too.,UNK
2781,"Good chips and salsa, like that they give you 3 different salsas. Both their beans are vegetarian, awesome. I recommend the black bean and cheese burrito enchilada style. Some people like the outdoor seating but the smell of the duck pond is pretty sick.",UNK
2782,"Had one of my best haircuts here in April. I was in town for a trade show, went without appointment on a Sunday. The cut was done all with electric razors (with varying guide adaptors to control length). It was quick, cheap, fast and good! An experience!",UNK
2783,"Exceptional local Carefree/Cave Creek/N. Scottsdale hangout for quality Italian, tasty gourmet pizzas, and even back-East style fast food.  Prices are very reasonable and consistency is never an issue with food or service.",UNK
2784,I have been going to Someburros since they first opened in 1986. I have tried almost everything on their menu and love it all!  Best red chili beef I have ever had!  Amazing chimichangas. I could go on and on about how delicious the food is.  Fantastic!!',UNK
2785,is now ***closed***,UNK
2786,came all the way for this. and I should order 10 to go and bring it back to Seattle. Very good fries! love the cheese burger !,UNK
2787,"Pretty indifferent about InO.  Not the worst, not the best. I never plan going, its more of a spontaneous \""I am hungry and they're the first I see that are convenient to turn into\""",UNK
2788,The coffee was just not hot!,UNK
2789,Really Enjoyed it!  Great from the start through the end of the meal. The Guacamole was excellent.   Had one of the Wood Fired Oven Entrees the Chamorro and it was fantastic...falling off the bone tender fantastic.,UNK
2790,"Awesome place. Went for EDC weekend and was near the stage for Fat Boy Slim.\nZero douche, never bumped once and great staff overall. A much better time than Tao Beach or EBC. Fairly even ratios of friendly girls as well.",UNK
2791,Great food! The curry is awesome! So is the Pad Thai and beef salad!!!! Really reasonably priced!,UNK
2792,Your general Baja Fresh but way too expensive because its in a casino,UNK
2793,"Man this place is good!  Bring it to Vegas, please?  Came for lunch, ended up getting a bunch of cookies, too.  Their cookies are soooo good.  Everything is very reasonably priced.",UNK
2794,"Just had an amazing lunch, and now can't wait to see the cardinals on all these tv's!",UNK
2795,"Horrible experience! \nNo customer service \nEmpty pans \nFood was discussing, even the jello and ice cream, couldn't get those right. I live right across the street And I'll never go there again, don't recommend it to anyone.",UNK
2796,I liked that this place was packed full of stuff! But at those PRICES I don't know how they stay in business! I heard good things about what they give if you sell..was very sad they weren't accepting clothes.(but I see why!),UNK
2797,All the employees here are horrible and whoever does the hiring needs to be fired. Never met customer service people so rude and bothered by the fact that you come to their job and purchase stuff. Hello the customer is the reason you have a job and paycheck you small minded humans.,UNK
2798,You feel like your in downtown Detroit when you come here nowadays. It used to be classy place with good martini drinks. Now its a trashy place that serves watered down ones..,UNK
2799,Don't see the big deal in these expensive burgers. Really? Won't be back not worth it,UNK
2800,"Great food, had several different kinds of tacos and grilled Mexican corn.  All was delicious but it was super hot in that tiny place, very uncomfortable.",UNK
2801,"Pizza was good, but nothing special.  Seriously overpriced - every topping is another $2 and they double charge you if you do half and half with different toppings.",UNK
2802,They're rather boring. They never do anything and it's always crowded around the cage. This is a free exhibit though so can't complain much. Just don't waste too much of your time waiting for them to move.,UNK
2803,"We come here for the 49cent tacos, but if you're looking for customer service that's above and beyond your expectations, you're barking up the wrong tree. They don't even smile at you. Just saying ;)",UNK
2804,Decent food buy WAYYY too expensive. $13.50 dinner price is outrageous. I'd rather go to an actual Chinese place like Sesame Inn and get very high quality food for much less.,UNK
2805,Ewww found three fingernails in my eggs. When I asked for a new plate they acted like I was completely unreasonable. Do you even know how to breakfast? Insanity.,UNK
2806,"My wife and I discovered Roadside while house hunting in the area...simply put...good food, atmosphere and friendly and efficient service!!!\n\nHighly Recommended!!",UNK
2807,"I went to see Dr. Liu. He seemed like a great doctor. The office staff was so rude when I tried to schedule my surgery, I decided to go to another doctor.",UNK
2808,"Wonderful food, amazing service, memorable experience",UNK
2809,FABULOUS.....Always if there is a wait it is worth it!,UNK
2810,"The food was terrible and the place was seemingly unclean. Moreover, our waitress was clueless when asked about food suggestions, beers, etc. Will never go here again.",UNK
2811,Great Chicken Soup!,UNK
2812,Only reason they get two stars is because their pies are great. Terrible service and don't have enough people working so it takes half an hour to get anyone to even acknowledge that you are waiting.,UNK
2813,People ask do they have Chicago style pizza or New York style pizza? The answer is they have Italian pizza and it is the best you will find any where around these parts. As a matter of fact everything about this place is very Italian. This is a class operation,UNK
2814,The kids had fun but totally overpriced for what they have to offer. Cashman did the photos...what a joke that was still waiting for their system to come up 2 days later and they are offering nothing to compensate for the hassle.,UNK
2815,"Not the absolute best Italian food, but pretty darn good. My favorites are garlic cheese knots, pizza, and pasta dishes! The Hero's are not so good though. All the dishes are huge -- definitely big enough to share! Great take out food!",UNK
2816,Wash was OK but the hard upwell tactics are to the point of being sleazy - I had to beg the guy to shut up and just write the ticket so I could get on with the wash - STAY AWAY,UNK
2817,I am really surprised that this placed closed down 'cause the shops inside weren't that bad and it was fun to walk through. Granted no one was buying 'cause of the prices but they still had some quality shops worth checking out.,UNK
2818,Their so called over night staff is Never there. you are paying extra for someone to be caring for your sick pets or boarding pets during the night? HA what a joke. The kennels are always dirty as well  over priced care.,UNK
2819,"They really know what they are doing out there. Chris made the most perfect mule cocktail that I have ever had. They might not have a lot in stock, but they pack a punch with everything",UNK
2820,I don't know what's so great about this place.  The menu seemed overpriced for what it was.  It just didn't taste that great.,UNK
2821,A great place for kids.  The Adventuredome is fun and has a few rides and carnival games.  The rooms are decent for rest.  Can't beat the prices.  It has seen it's better days though.,UNK
2822,"This is for the JC at the Venetian. I like their service. Bought a Ramona and a pair of flats. Speedy, just like I needed it. Bought it right before departure time (+time needed to go to the airport!).",UNK
2823,Truly a fun place to hang out and people watch.  I was in last night for a late night glass of wine and a pizza.  The prosciutto pizza is super thin crust and pretty good.  A lot of people from Comicon were in and out wearing their costumes.  What a kick!,UNK
2824,Not impressed. WAY too much mayo... bad bread... overall just not that great.\nIf you want a good sub go to Jersey Mikes - Their subs are amazing!,UNK
2825,Fresh and good but the actual hot dog on the Chicago dog tastes like one from the grocery store. Meets the craving for Chicago but not completely.,UNK
2826,This show was ...o..k...at the most...there's not a lot of acrobatics like the other shows...not a lot of actions....I would recommend another show from Cirque Du Soleil...,UNK
2827,"Si vous aimez jouer aux \u00e9checs c'est la place ! Sinon, y'a du caf\u00e9/th\u00e9 \u00e9quitable et le wifi est gratuit !",UNK
2828,This review is for Payards macarons. They have lots of taste and a great flavor. Nicely made but i prefer Bouchons for the subtleness and size.,UNK
2829,"I own the Andrew Leo Hair Salon on Walnut St. and we have a new arrangement in the salon every week. Everyone loves each new arrangement. We never know what we're getting, but have really enjoyed having a fresh and artistic floral touch. And oh the candles they make are absolutely wonderful.",UNK
2830,This place was decent for lunch.  I say it had average sushi.  I would try it again for lunch.,UNK
2831,I love the food my favorite are the dumplings and the fresh rolls. I also love the crab fried rice. The service is excellent,UNK
2832,While it is the best newspaper in Phoenix it remains well below average.,UNK
2833,"WOW! Smoked steak tartar, filet, service, the whole thing - spectacular.",UNK
2834,Not kid friendly at all.... Food was alright but not for the price... They charge 10 bucks to split a meal!!! Are u kidding me?!,UNK
2835,"I'll echo what others have said.  The service was poor.  This is a $6 million upfit and it's gorgeous.  The food is good, but not spectacular like the atmosphere.\n\nLots of potential here in the front and back of house.",UNK
2836,"dated, kind of shabby 70s feel in the non-remodeled portion of the hotel, nice soaps/lotion",UNK
2837,I got the Chinese eggplant with tofu. Atmosphere is nice enough. Price is great and food is good american-chinese. Solid four stars.,UNK
2838,Great atmosphere and even better drink deals,UNK
2839,"Absolutely terrible service, food, and overall atmosphere. Couldn't ask for a worse location and experience. If I wanted a three-story failure I would've run into a burning building. Paying for roped off parking is also the most amazing idea.",UNK
2840,"Just came home from a 5 course wine dinner. Wow fabulous! Chef Jon Spahr did us proud with chef Beau MacMillan at his side. Great evening , wonderful food, and GREAT wine.",UNK
2841,very nice and fast service. Great vegetarian food. Would definitely recommend. Lemonade is to die for,UNK
2842,kokomos ROCKS !!! This place is so clean and all their toppings are sooo fresh.. We go there 2x per week and love to see the place packed all the time.. Glad u r in town !!!,UNK
2843,I have been coming here for 12 years!  There is a reason I will only come here. Don always is polite and the shop is always clean and welcoming.  Sonny has been my nail tech for years and does a wonderful job everytime.  I always recommend the salon when someone asks where to go.,UNK
2844,I love the pho so 1,UNK
2845,Stopped in at 5:30 for a quick dinner. Place was nearly empty except for a few regulars at the bar. Service was prompt and the food was fine. Nothing too remarkable.,UNK
2846,"Fun place for St Patrick's fun. Live music, decent drinks, okay service, fun atmosphere",UNK
2847,"I could not find any staff to help me find a hard drive enclosure that I was looking for. No one was available or even in the store on a Saturday afternoon, I waited for 30 minutes in store.\n\nFuture Shop it is.",UNK
2848,"We love the table cooking here and give it 4 stars but dont come for the sushi. We love Sushi Wow for the rolls, but we like Sushi Tachi for the ll you can eat nigiri",UNK
2849,"Pool party that won't let us splash? Get in trouble for raging too hard? The venue is really nice but I'm here to party and get wild, not lounge around listening to music. If I wanted to do that I would be at the hotel pool",UNK
2850,Inexpensive...well situated(Latin quarter) large well furnished clean rooms...friendly helpful staff...indoor pool and bar/restaurant on site...very nice.  If I'm ever back in Montreal I would stay here again.,UNK
2851,Fun and fairly enxpensive place to meet-up with friends. Although dont expect great mexican food beyond the price you pay.,UNK
2852,Service is almost always slow and food is just okay. Even my beer was warm tonight. Kinda of pricey but what do you expect out of a hotel restaurant?,UNK
2853,"The banana nut muffins are worth the trip alone.  I had the chocolate chip pancakes and they were great. Overall, nice atmosphere, friendly service, and great food with generous portions.  Will definitely go back to try some other pancake combinations.",UNK
2854,"I absolutely love this parish.  I have tried out many other churches in the Valley and am,most comfortable here.  I even plan on serving by lectoring!  Everyone is the nicest and helpful!  Im so happy to become a life long parishioner!!!",UNK
2855,"Awesome Spot. I was in town for Spring Training and happened by this place. don't ask me what I was doing in this part of town, I plead the fifth!",UNK
2856,"The food is good, however the staff is very uninviting, and the store is also pretty dirty.",UNK
2857,Had 2 burnt 16$ pizzas and a few drinks for 85 $ lol what a rip. Dont even bother. Told waiter the issue but he argued saying we already ate it. Yeaa after waiting a long time. We wr hungry,UNK
2858,"Underwhelming.  It's a beautiful space, rather trendy looking.  I love the decor and how the conversation areas are spread throughout the room.  But they need to really develop their wine list more.",UNK
2859,"Booked on. Priceline 3nights given the worst room in the place. 4th for corner closest to airport.security chain on door broken,remote for tv does,nt work whole room shakes every time a plane takes off.  Thanks Priceline.",UNK
2860,I love shopping at Costco. Great prices and the best bakery. Only down side is when I went to get something to eat there the woman behind the counter was yelling at us and rolled her eyes when we said we needed a minute. There was nobody behind us in line. No need for the attitude,UNK
2861,"So good! A salad and a slice.  Delicious.  Great service, too!",UNK
2862,Great lunch specials. But they add a gratuity of their choosing to to-go orders and will not remove it. \n\nShady as hell. Won't be back.,UNK
2863,"The price scanners here will always, always overcharge you, especially on staple items like bread and milk. Bring a pad and paper so you can write down the shelf price. Or better yet shop at the new Winco in Henderson where groceries are 33-40% less.",UNK
2864,Took longer to rent my car than fly here.  Absolutely ridiculous.  I was told it would be a 30 min wait and it's been three times that- still waiting... All the chairs in their lobby are full of angry customers.,UNK
2865,This is going to be short and sweet. There is a nice selection of rental agencies at this location. I would look into rewards programs for particular rental agencies like Hertz or Enterprise as it may speed up the process for you.,UNK
2866,"Mediocre food, mine was really really salty.  Kind of an interesting place though, looks like a Colorado lodge but what's that decor doing in Arizona??  Looks like a good place to go after work for happy hour and hangin with friends, so-so for a nice dinner.",UNK
2867,"Service at the bar, excelent! with that said unfortunately the food was not.  Stopped in for happy hour and decided to stay for dinner. We had apps. and one entree. The food for sure was sub par. We will not be going back.",UNK
2868,I love this place. Amazing food from scratch and the service is always top notch.,UNK
2869,"Checked it out. Its ok, fresh organic food is always great but price is a bit more than china town where produce is larger, just as fresh (still has dirt on it!) waaay more variety and cheaper. Ok if its close to you.",UNK
2870,"I never write reviews but this DEFINITELY deserved one. Came a week ago the day I arrived and came back on my way back out. Incredible food, ambience and great service and staff! Love it! I'll be back in a couple weeks!",UNK
2871,Such a fun event! Always love to be able to take our dog Ziggy out and the pup cakes from sprinkles are his favorite treat! Thanks so much yelp and let's get more dog friendly events going!,UNK
2872,Horrible!!! Meats were dry sweet tea was watery mac n cheese taste like boxed kraft. Bbq sauce runny. Never Again,UNK
2873,Suzanne is Amazing!  Truly a nail goddess :)  I have never had nails that looked so real and held up so well ever!  She does everything by hand and they are perfect every time.  She also has an amazing personality!  I enjoy the hour I get to spend with her.,UNK
2874,This is a great spot to grab a bite to eat before the movie. Typical Panda Express + free wifi.,UNK
2875,This place just sucks ill take taco bell over this place and margaritas were horrible just tastes like margarita mix not to mention the prices for the margs were outrageous but then again what do you expect for airport food?,UNK
2876,"Been coming here for past 6 months.  And I have not looked for any other coffee joints.  Coffee is superb!  I love it here, the owner definitely has passion and great taste.",UNK
2877,Stopped in for a late breakfast--midweek.  There were plenty of seats so the wait was not an issue. Service was prompt and friendly.  Quite frankly the food was average.  I would go to Pamela's before here anytime.,UNK
2878,This store is always busy and the parking lot can fill up quickly. Once you are in thou the staff is helpful and will look to make sure that you get exactly what you need,UNK
2879,Did not care for the food at,UNK
2880,I wasn't impressed at all.,UNK
2881,"I brough my car for service to this location , and waited for 15 minutes no one adknowledged me ! Service is very slow!   No very friendly customer service at all! When my service contract expires i will never comeback here!",UNK
2882,"Had to get some links taken out of a new watch, they charged $15 and it took less than 5 minutes, they even showed me how to make adjustments at home if needed. Definite repeat customer.",UNK
2883,Grade: C-\n\nTriangle-shaped fish fillets served on Styrofoam plates. Good greasy Hushpuppies and cold beer. Good service and prices.,UNK
2884,"They make their pancakes with peanut oil.\n\nWhich makes me sad, because I'm allergic to peanuts.\n\nSo yeah, until they use something else, I literally can't eat pancakes here.",UNK
2885,What a cute little place. That's all I remember. The food was OK. They don't have coffee. I was there for brunch. Ya.,UNK
2886,Very good food.  The staff was very friendly and cared about how we liked the food.  They gave us samples to taste and were very genuine.  4 stars instead of 5 simply for the ambiance.  It's just a self serve taqueria.,UNK
2887,We didn't have to wait in line (which apparently is a normal occurrence here) and the service was good and fast! Everyone was very friendly and the Mac and cheese was to excellent! I would definitely recommend this place when visiting Montreal.,UNK
2888,The filet mignon and lobster mac and cheese was to die for! The James Bond table was pretty awesome too.,UNK
2889,you guys are the best! roberto's can't hold a candle to you!   LOVE u guys! ty!,UNK
2890,"I love coming to Coffee Rush. The employees are friendly, but more importantly, they are experts when it comes to crafting amazing espresso drinks.",UNK
2891,Will not be back.  Was seated at a dirty table had to point out that the coasters were all dirty. Food was not as good as recent visits blooming onion very greasy and ribs appeared to have been warmed up then just cooked my opinion,UNK
2892,"The service was excellent. The food was good, but doesn't live up to expectations.",UNK
2893,The Gallery is a must stop for me once a year.  I'm a big fan of Dale Chihuly.  The glass art is incredible.,UNK
2894,Have to try the brisket and the donuts.,UNK
2895,"Servers are chatting, not paying attention to tables. I can see my salad is ready at the window. Worst serves ever.",UNK
2896,I love this place.  I always carry out so I can't speak to the service but the food is great!  Very reasonably priced and good sized portions.  I can't find any good Chinese in this town but this place covers that need.  Definitely check it out....,UNK
2897,Atmosphere was great.  Service was mediocre.  Food was plain and boring.  At $120 for two it sucked.  Eat elsewhere.,UNK
2898,One of the best food and service I have ever had! Definitely is a place to visit while in Las Vegas!,UNK
2899,I went here for my 23rd birthday dinner. I came her for their Kobe burger and it was a good choice. It was soooo yummy! Next time I want to try their drinks in the hug mug :),UNK
2900,"Best Ramen in Las Vegas!! It's always busy, so the best time to go it's right when they open at 11:30. Try the potstickers too, great place!! Highly recommend!!",UNK
2901,Waiter was friendly but the other reviews here seem to hit the nail on the head.  This place has great potential but the food is bland and overpriced for the quality. Was forced into coming since some family had set up a reservation.,UNK
2902,"Great service, great bartenders, beer on tap is extensive. Fantastic views! Love this place!",UNK
2903,bomb pizza and ranch but the owner lady is rude. i only ran into her once and i never want to again i almost never came back because of her but luckily i have eaten there many times now and havnt seen her,UNK
2904,"Purchased a groupon for 2 for $49 taxes not included was great food looked fresh didn't wait in line, if you arrive after 7pm you'll be in a line. Waiters are great def will return again when in town.",UNK
2905,"The staff are some of the most helpful and nicest people you will come across!  Not alot of business, hope the store makes it!",UNK
2906,I have brought boots and shoes here for years.  JR always does great work at a fair price.  He can even sharpen knives.,UNK
2907,"Pretty average sushi.  If I had to pick a favorite, it would be the mesa roll.  Friendly and fast service...I think it might be family-owned and operated.  I wasn't blown out of the water, but the food is decent and ill probably be back!",UNK
2908,rude drivers.  Skip this cab and take the next one.,UNK
2909,"The food is fabulous......always hot, fresh, and super yummy! The service is kind of slow and hard to get refills on drinks but otherwise its great....I don't mind the mediocre service in exchange for delicious food.",UNK
2910,The first time we visited it was great. Tonight the planetarium was disappointing. The presentations were blurry and all six of us walked out complaining to each other about the terrible resolution. Too bad!,UNK
2911,"The only thing I liked about this sushi bar was the size.  It is very large.  Custom rolls were weak, freshness was questionable and the price was way to high.  Have not been back.",UNK
2912,The waffle cone isnt free.  The store should be fined for false advertising.  They measure the cone on the weigh machine so they jack you.  $10 for a small amount of yogurt is pwnage,UNK
2913,"I like the sandwiches & the proximity to home is appealing.\n\nBut the customer service was not the business at all. They're slow, unfriendly & very to themselves. \n\nThe quality is what you'd expect from a chain sandwich store.",UNK
2914,"All the Outlets we've been to basically offer the same goods with the same name brand stores. Take heart. Deals CAN be had. All you need I'd time, patience, endurance and most of all cold hard cash. Go for it.",UNK
2915,"great happy hour prices, kid friendly, the food is decent for the pricing.",UNK
2916,"Growing up in NY, I know pizza. This place has great pizza. Authentic. Jimmy the owner is super nice and was genuinely interested in what we thought of the food. I recommend you go for the pizza. One of the two best in Arizona.",UNK
2917,would never go back i went to have photo facials done by sierra she burned my face and im still doing everything i can to fix her damage i have to wear so much makeup and cover up now and its still there doing tons of treatments and it dsnt fade thanks,UNK
2918,Great place to take the kids. They loved it.,UNK
2919,Luke warm water; low water pressure; tub needs to be replaced (looks dirty).  Workout facility is mediocre.  This is the worse HGI they I've stayed in.  Checking out to and going to a different hotel.  Staff was nice. Breakfast was good.,UNK
2920,"Our room needs serious renovation.  The wallpaper were peeling off, the TV screen was not clear, looks like an analog.  We did not get the deluxe room that we reserved.  The location however is ideal.",UNK
2921,"Went on Valentines day. Big mistake, place was so overbooked our waitress was ready to cry. Also, felt like a high school re-union, nothing but teenagers.\nFood was good but drink service was slow.",UNK
2922,Get ready to wait forever for a drink here. So ridiculous. The staff doesn't prioritize or make drinks in the order that they were ordered. I came in before work and waited almost 30 minutes for my drink. I was so close to walking out!!,UNK
2923,"2.7/5 Average deli. Better than Subway for sure but nothing out of the ordinary, could have got the same ingrediants from the deli at Albertsons and made my own.",UNK
2924,"terrible rip off.  las vegas joke.  wanted to spend money, got shook down for nothing",UNK
2925,"I just found this place over price! Food was a bit of below average especially \""Malaysia chicken curry\"". I don't think I will ever be back again.",UNK
2926,Came in around 9pm on a few different nights. Good bagels and hot chocolate but cashier was snippy.,UNK
2927,"Forum Shops a blast.\nMakes me wish I was filthy.\nFilthy-rich, dumbass.",UNK
2928,"Cozy little place, only a bar too sit at, though. No tables. Excellent latte, and the cappuccino was good. Good choice of panini as well (got the chicken one and really enjoyed it).",UNK
2929,Great kungpao vegs!,UNK
2930,"Good food, friendly service",UNK
2931,"Pretty dirty place, but drunk food is drunk food. I was very excited to see that they say they offer Kingfisher Beer, a classic Indian beer, on the menu, but I was super disappointed to find out they did not have any in stock.",UNK
2932,We got here at 7. It is now 8:54. We still have no food. Apparently this place cannot handle big groups. Also they told some of us the chicken pot pie was available. And then they came back and said it was not. Hopes and dreams crushed.,UNK
2933,Great experience - excellent food and very unique atmosphere.,UNK
2934,"The service was fast & easy, I just had to call ahead of time to make an appointment. I just thought the price could have been better; $35 for an IVP fingerprint card seemed like a lot, but it's a niche market. Overall I would recommend it.",UNK
2935,"Wasn't expecting much when I was looking at the front of the store, but when I walked inside I was blown away.  The coffee was great and fresh, sitting on top of a great atmosphere to blog, do HW, etc.  Definitely should try it if you have a chance!",UNK
2936,Yup,UNK
2937,"These guys are awesome, I had a short notice job and they did everything to squeeze in a convenient time for me. They were helpful and had a good attitude even though the job was a tough 3 story one. I highly recommend these guys. The prices aren't bad either!",UNK
2938,"Yelp deal was not honored, even though we were the only people in the establishment, because it was happy hour. Also Chardonnay was ordered but then the server brought red wine. I don't plan to return.",UNK
2939,"Kicked me out for wearing a wife beater! I'm glad I don't live on this side of town, fuckin snobs",UNK
2940,They have $2 BJ with loose rules.\n\nNice.,UNK
2941,Horrible high cost and small portion's the people are very in profetiomal and don't care about customer service and good edicts I will never go again and if you want good food it's a waist of money,UNK
2942,The food here is excellent but the 50 cent transaction fee for credit card is ridiculous.,UNK
2943,"It's your typical coffee shop. The bathrooms were clean and service friendly. We did have a guy come in and try to sell us stuff, saying he was a wholesaler which was annoying. Thankfully he didn't try the hard sell. Otherwise the place was fine.",UNK
2944,Came 3 days ago and still waiting for the food!!!!!!!!!!!!! The food wasn't that great and just spend whole lot of money for no reason.. After waiting for the food which took almost 30 mins..,UNK
2945,not impressed. My salad was $17 for lunch!! and also NOT WORTH IT. Very pricey for what you get.,UNK
2946,"Great for business travel and personal. Unbelievable planes, flight crews are the best. This is a great way to travel privately. The costs are more that worth the fantastic experience. Reasonable is an understatement. This is the best private travel experience out there.",UNK
2947,This company was horrible to deal with. We took our vehicle in to be repaired and they continued to call with more work they wanted to do. We had to pay them $600 to get the vehicle back and it still isn't fixed.,UNK
2948,The water fountain show is really pretty and sort of mesmerizing and quite relaxing for some reason.  It gets really crowded with people standing around but you can watch from many different places.,UNK
2949,"When the owner comes by to apologize, I'ts not a good night. Service is slow, pizza is nothing special in a town with some good pie. It's also weirdly loud in there.",UNK
2950,I went here with a group. They had a ton of good authentic Korean food. There portions are nice. I would say that I liked there bulgogi pizza and sweet potato fries the best. The latter is more of like a dessert with how it's made.,UNK
2951,"Best place for fresh raw oysters in Las Vegas,  They are $1 per oyster during the happy hour (2:45 to 6 pm).  The burger was perfection.  Order it medium rare with a pint of Guinness.",UNK
2952,Terrible place to eat and not very clean at all. Way over priced foe fast food. 5$ for a plain roast beef forget that!,UNK
2953,"My husband and I can not get enough of their spinach and feta! BEST pizza, EVER!!!",UNK
2954,"A small restaurant located inside the Baiz Grocery story. The food is not that bad, although I have not tasted enough of the dishes...The meat pies and chicken shawarma were the big deals for me and I really like them.",UNK
2955,Came here for the first time. A roach crawled on my arm the first five minutes. Not a good thing.,UNK
2956,"Taco Tuesday's here are the best, and their margaritas rock! Stale chips and watery salsa need some work, but all their other food is great.",UNK
2957,I was able 2 get right in. No wait! Scott is the best. I was in out within an hour. He really worked with me to make sure I was able to get what I needed taking care of.,UNK
2958,The prices were a little high and the flank steak was unimpressive.  Interesting location with nice views of the park.  We had a reservation and got seated right away and had good service all night.,UNK
2959,"It's hard to find what you're looking for, but the staff there is very friendly and helpful. They went out of their way to help me find what I was looking for.",UNK
2960,"Marginal food, small portions, over-priced.  Service was awful.  Pass",UNK
2961,"The staff is great. The food is very hit and miss. Nothing is consistent out of the kitchen except inconsistency. Sunday/Monday breakfasts are not anything like the other 5 days.. again, due to inconsistency.",UNK
2962,"Staff was very helpful, pool area was clean and up to date. Rooms were clean and up to date.\n\nWould stay here again.",UNK
2963,26$ hamburger was great after a night of partying. This one good thing about this place is that it is open to 5am.,UNK
2964,shit !  It took 25 minutes to get my food at 12:30 in the afternoon on Friday the 11th. I'm not going back,UNK
2965,Great service and of course AWESOME chips and salsa.,UNK
2966,These guys are amazing! I had a blast. They sing oldies music mixed with current day music. Very talented.,UNK
2967,I booked here with a very good deal from expedia and it was on the LV strip. That's why I chose there. It wasn't that bad but if it wasn't on the strip I would look for somewhere else.,UNK
2968,"Carmen's came highly recommended, & now I will recommend them to EVERYONE!!! Fast, friendly, honest!!!",UNK
2969,"I used to think they had the best tonkotsu ramen in Arizona but lately something changed. It's not as good as before. The soup tastes weaker and the meat is harder and tastes different. Also, miso soup should never come out by its self for Japanese food.",UNK
2970,They had an event for Amici club members to try their newest items on the menu. Their Mahi Wulfie was excellent.  The berry sangria was good although a bit sweet. Our server was very friendly and nice.  This was my first-time I definitely will return.,UNK
2971,"The bathroom was so dirty and awful, like it hadn't been cleaned in a month or more.  The food was old, like it had been cooked in the morning and sat in the pan all day.  Too expensive and not so great customer service, never going back",UNK
2972,"Since going to this location, we discovered we were ripped off and completely lied to. Do NOT go to this store!! Talk about dishonest!!",UNK
2973,"Flowers arrangements are phenomenal. Prices are fair. Customer service is key. They value your opinion and really help guide to your like. My flowers died probably because of our fault, they replaced what died three days later! I'm forever a customer!",UNK
2974,PJ Clarke's Sucks!!! food made me sick once and then went back for a 2end try at it food was small no flavor and the 2 guys at the bar blow!,UNK
2975,This service department is great. I had some ongoing problems with my car and they were easily taken care here. Sam was very informative and knowledgeable about my cars issues and repair process. They even washed and vacuumed it really nice for me upon pick up.,UNK
2976,Tried another local barber shop and didn't like it. Came here and got it fixed and I loved it. I like how they wash your hair and cut it again to insure that you get a proper hair cut. Will definitely be going here again. A decent hair cut for 20.,UNK
2977,"Great food, great atmosphere, and great service. Can't really ask for much more. I'll definitely be back.",UNK
2978,oysters were rubbery and skanky. tasted old. service was decent. was really hoping it would be good.,UNK
2979,One of the best sushi places I've been to.  Very friendly staff makes this a go to place for me.,UNK
2980,"Mike's used to be a very good restaurant where the food and service were excellent.  Recently we had pizza, pasta and salad, all of which were just okay. To make matters worse, the server was surly. The prices are just too high for an unpleasant experience.",UNK
2981,Love this casino!  On the small side compared to the big guys on the strip - but it feels like old Vegas only updated!  Love the vibe!!!  \n\nI stayed in a renovated room - very nice.  Will come again.,UNK
2982,They have bed bugs like the size of a chupacabra and I got bit in my butt by a bug and don't even get me started on the customer service.,UNK
2983,"Staff and venue are nice/cute, but I am sorry it comes down to flavor and quality of the little pastries, doesn it? \nIt has nothing on JP or Payard.",UNK
2984,"Very disappointed with the food quality.. Overpriced, tasteless.. And poor service..",UNK
2985,The brunch buffet on saturdays is way too pricey for the selection and the quality is simply average. Will not be eating here again.,UNK
2986,gave them a budget for an arrangement for my wife and i was really impressed. My wife loved them. Great place great owner,UNK
2987,This place needs a heavy supply of air filters. The room was so dirty that we couldnt breathe after sleeping. The casino is average - same games and sports book as the others.,UNK
2988,"Don't bother scheduling your appointment in advance online(they never received my reservation even though I had a confirmation number.). Also make sure you give your name at \""check-in\"" to at least three different people to make sure you get on the list.  Worst customer service.",UNK
2989,I thought it was pricey for the product. Service was slow and the server blamed the the bar staff? Many better chioces that are locally grown.,UNK
2990,"simple, and always perfectly made! if you like japanese curry, this place does it the best",UNK
2991,"The staff there was incredibly rude and obnoxious.  I was insulted about my bag which had nothing to do with my purchase.  I am not saying anything about the Affliction company, but I would never return to that location again.",UNK
2992,Great food!,UNK
2993,I'm all about the Chips & Salsa.  My usual Happy Hour fix here: Queso Fundido & Chips and an Iced Tea. Always great service. I can't wait for tomorrow's Happy Hour here. Cheers***,UNK
2994,This Brakes Plus. The is best Brakes Plus. Jeff And Lee are great.,UNK
2995,"Has horrible food.  I love Chinese food and this place is pretty bad.  I went back three times hoping they have improved, but left disappointed every time. Not worth what I paid for.",UNK
2996,Excellent outdoor dining and top service! Love the steak aupoivre and the delicious greens. This is now my favorite restaurant on the strip!,UNK
2997,Food and smoothies are awesome and consistent.  The employees are not happy to be here and I always feel like I'm putting them out when I show up.,UNK
2998,interesting food and small portions for $$$,UNK
2999,"The food was good here.  The service was okay.  The atmosphere could use some work, but it is a basic Gyro shop.",UNK
3000,"Pretty good location. They tend to get pretty busy at lunch time, when I usually frequent this place, but they are efficient and always seem to get each customer in and out as quickly as possible. Customer service is pretty friendly as well.",UNK
3001,So slowwwwwww. But pretty good gyro.,UNK
3002,"The customer service is poor, extremely poor. The only savior of this place was a really nice tech that barely spoke english, but was extremely friendly and warm!",UNK
3003,"Crowded and lots of tools. Sticky table tops, lame music. Boooo.",UNK
3004,A little bit of renovation going on and things have been moved around but still a huge supply of goods.,UNK
3005,Apple Zombies everywhere! Watch your back!,UNK
3006,not terrible... not as nice as i expected it to be. i should have checked the reviews before i went to this place.,UNK
3007,Be sure to ask if your car is ready yet. They forget to announce it sometimes and leave you in the lobby waiting for Christmas.,UNK
3008,Horrible!!!  Too much flaws in their. 25 cent wings,UNK
3009,stracciatella and ferrero rocher. happiness.,UNK
3010,I had the chicken bowl.  Tasty.,UNK
3011,We ordered the salmon entree.  The food took an incredibly long time to be served which lead me to believe they had forgotten our meal and then made it in a rush.  It was under cooked and had to be sent back.  I probably would not return to Veranda.,UNK
3012,"If you like to play low-limit Texas Hold 'Em then this is good place to do it. They have tons of tournaments and lots of tables. The only problem with this place is that the other players are OLD. Oh well, you came here to play poker.",UNK
3013,The quality of the food is like heaven. No joke. From the moment I tasted it to the time iam makomg the review (less than 2 weeks) i have ate here 4 times. Yes iam that addicted.,UNK
3014,Always a favorite spot for great apps and sushi. Sake selection is amazing. Best Gyoza's in town! Still have yet to find time for Paint Nite.,UNK
3015,I do love this doctors office but the wait time is dreadful. I would recommend Dr. Miller to any one with children.,UNK
3016,"Once again not nuts about this place.  Food seems to have lost its flavor, the front counter folks could put a smile or two on their faces.  I cant stand when someone hates their job and you can tell!",UNK
3017,Happy hour meatballs before the game.  Add a beer and it's all good.,UNK
3018,"This place is as bad to be expected! \n\nEssentially a warehouse stuffed with random fabric scraps, ribbon and assorted accessories. \n\nTo be honest, you better come here on a scavenger hunt, or else you will be disappointed!",UNK
3019,Love supporting local businesses and I'm not a fussy eater but I've had better frozen pizzas that weren't burned. Crust was horrible and the vege toppings came from a can. I really don't understand how this place stays in business....,UNK
3020,"Love how upon arrival you are greeted by slot machines and life-size posters of Chip n Dales dancers! Terminal B lacks decent shopping, bars and restaurants (would come in handy when your flight is delayed). \n\nHighly recommend flying Virgin America",UNK
3021,"Ate there today...it was awful...couldn't believe it,never again.",UNK
3022,"Love it, love it, love it. Food is great can't stop ordering take out. This is not a Texas restaurant but as close as Arizona can get too one. Can't wait to go again.",UNK
3023,great place with quality products. i have bout grass seed for my yard and i have done my neighbors and they come out great and thick green,UNK
3024,A bit of a weight but worth it.,UNK
3025,A theme of East Coast beach from the 70s. This place was doomed from the start. Fried. Expensive. Zip for vegetarians. Obnoxious presence in the neighborhood with no parking. How soon will it go away?,UNK
3026,"Not exactly sure what I ate, but it wasn't ramen, that for sure.  Might give it another try, i usually give all spots a 4th",UNK
3027,"With the name, I definitely thought I was in for some good NYC pizza. The only similarity is the size of the slice. The pizza is overpriced and doesn't taste that good. The kids didn't even go back for a second slice.",UNK
3028,"Good layout, friendly staff, and excellent waffle fries. The place didn't get jumping until almost midnight. The ratio of men to women was terrible, about 75/25 percent so if you're a single guy, be aware. Maybe I came on a bad night.",UNK
3029,"It's always a pleasure to go into the best hookah bar in Montreal. Amazing staff, wonderful selection of top quality tobacco and a fun environment where you can have some drinks, or even some delicious teas. \n\nOverall an exceptional experience for anyone looking for a relaxed environment!",UNK
3030,"10-15min wait, friendly, great nail service though. Yes I will be back when I return. Thanks for the foot spa referral Jimmy!",UNK
3031,The food here was good and came out quick.  They seemed a little disorganized when it came to taking care of our larger than normal party which included 9 patrons.,UNK
3032,"Was not impressed by their limited flavors, tobacco was to hoarse, made everyone cough. Needs to be decorated, very plain, but nice staff",UNK
3033,Cold bread \n\nAverage chiken\n\nDirty glasses and forks and knives \n\nService was so bad i changed waiters 3times,UNK

3037,This used to be my favorite Mexican restaurant in the EV now it's a great shame. Menu has changed slightly but the quality is on serious decline!,UNK
3038,Great coffee and atmosphere. Very friendly staff that makes you feel at home. It's a wonderful place to meet up with a friend in the south Chandler/Gilbert area.,UNK
3039,Amazing service!!! And new gel manis and pedis with 3d design!!!! If ur in the area come here!!!! Thanks new horizon nails!,UNK
3040,The best hotel we've stayed at since coming out here in the last 12 years bar none.,UNK
3041,"One of the worse chocolate fraps. It was bitter, to syrupy, and over-priced. I do not recommend this place",UNK
3042,Service is really good. Food is even better. Hidden gem. Pad thai is amazzzzing. Daily specials and great happy hour,UNK
3043,"this was my first las vegas buffet experience. crab, shrimp, tons of fresh veggies. I had no idea they were this good!",UNK

3045,"Excellent Margaritas, Food pretty good too! Lack Mexican Ambiance, like having a mexican meal at a CPK. Nice Patio, Id go back for the Margaritas for sure. Excellent Service and very nice.",UNK
3046,Lady was so rude to me on the phone that it caused me to not go. Such a shame that ive seen a lot of good reviews and i really wanted to give this place a try. Food isnt everything. Garbage service = no service.,UNK
3047,"This place is pretty cool and all...$450 for an unfurnished studio,and $500 for a furnished utilities included..plus they have rent a cops..yaaaaa to the rescue right?...right?.....",UNK
3048,Great food - love their Mediterranean dishes. We always go as a group and share plates so you can try a little bit of everything. Cool atmosphere too. Wednesday is their best night to go - 25% off your entire bill from 5-9pm.,UNK
3049,mmmmm....yummy food! Did not except such good food to be honest.,UNK
3050,Avg. Not terrible. I had the larb... It was close to delicious.,UNK
3051,"First time in the Monte Carlo resort , don't really like it theirs no wifi the rooms are not that great",UNK
3052,"Great inventory and nice (but slow) counter staff.  The \""boyz\"" in the yard have attitude. More fun driving the fork lifts than helping customers.  Time for some housekeeping, I think.",UNK
3053,If you're looking for the typical buffet that's slightly higher priced like the rest this ones good for the kids but I still like to stick with Ellis Island Casino for steak and eggs only $8.99... Gotta love the old school price!!!!!\n.,UNK
3054,Horrible haircut. The lady did not want to hear how I wanted my hair cut. She kept saying that it wouldn't work. And she didn't even know how to do a taper. Just awful. Not to mention that the TVs weren't working.,UNK
3055,The Walmart of Las Vegas hotels. You get what you pay for. Very basic rooms. Pool is like a public pool.,UNK
3056,"UPDATE:\n\nThey are closed down. Probably for good. I went down there, on Sunday, & the sign at the window said they didn't pay the rent for the building. So, it might be gone now.",UNK
3057,Very good cheap food. Pittsburgh classic.Great desserts! The oreo pie is amazing! The servers are always very friendly. The salad bar could be a little more clean.,UNK
3058,One of the best pizzas I've ever had. Love that they use locally sourced cheeses and heritage pigs for their pork products.  The quality of the ingredients shine through in the superb flavor of the pizza.,UNK
3059,This place is just an average casino buffet that you can find everywhere. Nothing too bad and nothing too special.,UNK
3060,The food and service were okay.  I was not WOW'd by my meal (carnitas) although the place has a great reputation.  Good environment.  Big bar area.,UNK
3061,Jade red is the best!  Snickerdoodles are awesome - only reason it gets a 4 star is because of the potential for your food to fight back later.  Overall a great hole in the wall place that is a solid lunch choice,UNK
3062,"Everything on the menu is authentic Japanese food, served the traditional way. I actually had a small dish of matcha and curry salt served with tempura. Noodles are made daily and sashimi was amazing. For the amount of food they serve, I think it's fairly inexpensive.",UNK
3063,Outstanding food!\nHad the salad with shredded beef and was really tasty. No dressing needed here or even salsa for that matter. Service was great as well. Cute little place. Enjoyed myself and the atmosphere here.,UNK

3065,Needed a cheap place to stay for a few days. This was excellent in that regard.,UNK
3066,"Excellent place to watch any game. We were actually watching 2 World Cup games at once. Really good food (I liked the chicken torta and lobster tacos). The bucket of beer is really cold and cheap. Service was good, fast, and friendly.",UNK
3067,"Looks very promising, but as someone in the biz, I would never review a restaurant util 90 days old. Good luck guys. Love the huge round ice cube in my Negroni.",UNK
3068,"I love that they are trying to use local produce, but it shouldn't take 30 min to make a smoothie. This is the slowest service in the world. Only come if you have plenty of time to kill.",UNK
3069,as with all large music chains they are paid low and the merchandise is in poor shape you get what you pay for?,UNK
3070,"This place is the quintessential Mama's Kitchen. Everything is amazing, and try the cheesecake. It is the lightest and fluffiest dreamy cheesecake I have ever eaten.",UNK
3071,"Consistently good. We took advantage of the two 4-course special for $40...soup, starter, main & mini dessert. All yummy but the orange peel beef is awesome!",UNK
3072,I am just unimpressed with this campus. The whole place seems dirty and poorly maintained.,UNK
3073,"Sketch on outside, nice inside.\n\nOther than being in kind of a sketch part of town, it was a pretty nice hotel in close proximity to the airport. \n\nMy only complaint is that I never saw the manager at the manager's reception!",UNK
3074,"Toto's is so-so.  Not bad or good, just fine.",UNK
3075,"Room was hot as hell, the ac man couldn't seemt to fix the problem. .",UNK
3076,"The prices were ridiculously marked up on the beer, wine, and liquor.",UNK
3077,"I appreciate P.U.B. esp. since the strip has few bars with long beer lists.  That said, the selection at Burger Bar is longer and better.  Nonetheless, my husband and I enjoyed stopping here for to try some new beers, and the bartender was friendly.",UNK
3078,Love taco bell chalupas. This particular location consistently smells really bad though.,UNK
3079,The sushi was ok but on the pricey side. The service was extremely slow. Although we had a large group (8 people) it took us 2 hours to have lunch.,UNK
3080,Love the salads and great bread!  I WILL get in the car for GREAT BREAD!  Not bad pricing for such a pricy neighborhood.  Next time I will have to try the pizza!,UNK
3081,Couldn't be better. Enough said!,UNK
3082,"Terrible service / food in a captive market. We just finished breakfast, had to wait 25min althought the restaurant was half empty. Half our food was cold or wrong, and for the price, this is ridiculous. \n\nStrongly do not recommend unless you have nothing else.",UNK
3083,"It is no boiling crab. The spices were a bit off. Service was slow. Our orders mixed up, hence, our bill took some figuring out.",UNK
3084,Been going here for 15 years. Best customer service. The couple who own this place are great with customers. I've gotten a lot of pants altered here as well. Very good work.,UNK
3085,Ok so I have a biased opinion because I only stopped in for a quick drink before visiting Nonna Maria at Italia Fest... But the service was not quick at all. Took the waitress 10 minutes to get 1 glass. Not cool. The pizza looked delish tho.,UNK
3086,Rudys always comes through when you need a great BBQ fix. Everything is awesome but the Turkey leaves all other BBQ places in the coals.,UNK
3087,"Nasty ! Just gave this Native one last try and again terrible food, 35$ for burnt cold food and poor service.  Do yourself a favor and save your money and your stomach. Enough said",UNK
3088,"The crew is amazing, some of the nicest people I've ever met.",UNK
3089,Shorter hours than the rest in this area bit there is almost never a wait of line.  The pharmacy staff are exceptionally professional and friendly.,UNK
3090,"This place sucks are room's had no Ac the manager had us moving room whit no help from them- we found bedbugs on the bed nasty place to stay at \""Im never never staying here again \"" customers service sucks",UNK
3091,they make a decent sandwich for the price.. the bread is excellent.. but it's really not worth coming here if you're sober as there are plenty of better dining options nearby,UNK
3092,"Did not care for the environment, wait or tap selection. NOT ENOUGH SEATING! \n Excellent concept Horrible delivery!",UNK
3093,this hotel has been there for a while.. I do think the interior is pretty old. The rooms are pretty small. The whole place is not my style.,UNK
3094,"Decent food, only thing memorable is how much of a douche Jo$h is from behind the counter. I didn't realize personalities could be that pretentious but after my second encounter I'm convinced otherwise. I'll be attending a different rubios going forward!",UNK
3095,The food is good. But the service isnt that great. We had to wait for a noodle for an hour once.,UNK
3096,Just checked in and have spent about 2 hours on the game floor with absolutely No waitresses coming by for drink service.  I expected more service.  Seriously regretting staying here.,UNK
3097,Went here to meet a nightclub tour group which starts at this location then tours a few other clubs. I asked the bartender how to check in and he was very rude. He obviously hated the nightclub tour groups so made sure he was as condescending as possible to me. Ouch!,UNK
3098,"Love this place, it is good simple as that",UNK
3099,"Came in for lunch.  Tasty and plentiful.  Very kind family service.  I wish it were busier, they are in the mood to cook!  They keep bringing things out and I'm just stuffed.  I'll be back.",UNK
3100,Comfortable and clean. The people who work there are always friendly and I never have to worry when dropping the kids off for a movie.,UNK
3101,"The  hostess is a honey, foods just above average, annoying having to wait in line without a menu to read.",UNK
3102,They charged us for water. They didn't even offer tap. The food was poor to mediocre for ethiopian. We ordered the veggie combo. Merkato is better.,UNK
3103,I will never set foot in this place again. I have never seen a bigger bunch of pathetic a-holes grouped together in my life. You would seriously have to pay me to get me back in the door.,UNK
3104,"Great place very hip, clean and nice decor.  Very nice people food is very healthy and good.  I would definitely refer it to friends.",UNK
3105,This food sucks. I would rather spend 20 cents on ramen noodles because I would end up happier. Even when a coworker drags you here just pass on putting any of this in your mouth. No matter how hungry you are!,UNK
3106,Love Love Love this place! Food and service is always A1. My only complaint is the KoolAid is way OVERPRICED!!!!,UNK
3107,Food was amazing. Friend and I grazed on apps and sides and were very pleased and full! Glad I gave this place a shot in lieu of their current yelp of 3.5 stars.,UNK
3108,This is a really good restaurant!  A must try for people who like Korean food!\n\nFavorites: Bulgogi with lettuce wraps and chap chae\n\nI really want to go back to try the karaoke here.,UNK
3109,My first and last time.  Not much flavor in the food.  Fried rice was soggy and hot and sour soup was weak on all accounts,UNK
3110,Awesome place with big portions and ice cold beer. Service is mostly hit but sometimes miss. This usually happens when they are busy though so I don't blame them. Try the BBQ chicken pizza and their chicken wrap. A nice cold sunbru to top it all off.,UNK
3111,"The Tilted Kilt is the best place in the valley to meet up and have a drink, NO exceptions.  The girls are gorgeous, the deals are great and their facebook page is amazing.  The bar tenders always have great deals and this is the only place I go to watch sports.",UNK
3112,"Delicious food! Service was incredible, well orchestrated and very friendly. Our server was incredible and had great recommendations about the food and drink selection. The patio is really nice and a great place to people watch while having an incredible dinning experience.",UNK
3113,"Interesting little hole in the wall. $2 good cup of tea to go, and tons of really nice (but also very expensive) boutiquey items. Leather bags, interesting crafts, all very cool.",UNK
3114,"Fun place. Great food. Joint them every Sunday for Watching Dead, the Walking Dead viewing party, hosted by the cast of Evil Dead the Musical. Followed by karaoke.",UNK
3115,Terrible registration service right. 25 guests and only 3 staffers. Manager was no help in speeding line,UNK
3116,"I live very close to Jason's Deli. For a long time, I ate there at least once a week. Last time I visited Jason's Deli, I ordered a chicken salad wrap with tomato and found a metal staple in my food. I have not been back since...",UNK
3117,I love the sports book. Not smokey.,UNK
3118,"Nice and clean airport overall... enjoyable experience, except when you miss your flight and you're stuck there longer than expected.",UNK
3119,"OMG, I now leave for the airport four hours before every flight, just so I can hang out in this lounge. Spacious, comfortable seating, delicious buffet meals, high-speed wifi, and everything is so clean. I almost LIKE traveling again.",UNK
3120,After a fun night out in vegas. It wouldn't be complete after a cheap steak dinner at Ellis Island hhahahaha,UNK
3121,"Do yourself a favor and hit up this gym! The coaches, workouts and overall community are the best in the city. You'll thank me later!",UNK
3122,"This is one of my favorite local sushi joints! For a fresh and inexpensive sushi meal they can't be beat. Great service, great sushi, always fresh and really great prices. A wonderful neighborhood sushi joint.",UNK
3123,Pretty good food. Ordered for delivery. Took over an hour for delivery on a sat night. Got chicken Parmesan and a calzone. The garlic knots are really good.  Maybe we'll try the pizza next time.,UNK
3124,Guacamole needs help! Fish tacos were good. Taco salad was good too. They need to keep doors closed to keep flies out!!!,UNK
3125,"I like how imadake makes it feel like authentic Japanese restaurant however the experience I got was a little disappointed,  it was a busy day with a rowdy crowds everywhere so service was lacking while I had a increasing headache . The food presentation was very nice , taste was satisfying .",UNK
3126,Great food and great service: Tip: you can order a side of Guac instead of the full appetizer if you don't need the full amount. Great Margaritas too!,UNK
3127,My wife and I have been coming here for years and the waiters have always been awesome but today we met Danny and this guy knows how to provide great customer service.\nAsk for him when you go !!!,UNK
3128,"They got my order, and my girlfriend's order, wrong on the same day. Do not expect to get what you order.",UNK
3129,"this place was delicious!  the menu is limited (Chef's choice), it's BYOB and they only accept cash, but it is a unique & fun experience.  I highly recommend going!",UNK
3130,"Great food, beer, prices, staff and atmosphere.  I'll be moving to a house just down the street in a few weeks.  I think I've found my new favorite watering hole!",UNK
3131,"John was awesome, very helpful, friendly and honest. Came out the next day. Affordable pricing, nothing shady. Thought my door was beyond repair, he literally brought it back to life. Would recommend to anyone who has a problem and thinks there is no hope.",UNK
3132,"The girls are nice, they know how to make you feel special, the food is good too. I had the bbq bacon burger with sweet potato fries. Moderately pricey but I'd go again if invited.",UNK
3133,"This place makes such great food and the store is fun to shop in while you wait. They make their own English muffins, which are so freakin good, you'll wonder why no other bakery has ever made them.",UNK
3134,"Best pizza in the area. Quick delivery. Last time our pizza was extremely greasy but all in all, good stuff.",UNK
3135,I was always get the chipotle avocado sandwich. Service is always great considering they serve so many customers. Earls is always a nice place to eat.,UNK
3136,Fantastic! They were punctual and amazingly kind and friendly. They took great care with our belongings and were reasonably priced. I've never had a move go so smoothly!,UNK
3137,Poor service. Food is overpriced and they stiff local charities out of money crying broke. Avoid this place it's run by dishonest people.,UNK
3138,Fish tacos were lackluster at best... \nBaja Rolls were eh..,UNK
3139,"I really liked thid place, as soon as we saw the menu we wanted everything on the menu. Average breakfast is $7.50 which is more then fair and food tasted fresh and delicious!!",UNK
3140,This is one of our families favorite yogurt spots! We usually come here once of twice a week. There's always a good selection of flavors to choose from and plenty of toppings. You can't go wrong here!,UNK
3141,I've enjoyed coming here for the entire time I've lived in Las Vegas and I just happen to come here 5 days a week nowadays,UNK
3142,"Don't get me wrong, I love Tory but their customer service SUCKS that it makes me not want to purchase anything from their boutique stores/outlets.",UNK
3143,From the time we got in till the time we left from the service to the meal...very impressed..,UNK
3144,Average food at best. Service was painfully slow and when it was around it felt like there was a language barrier (and I actually do NOT believe that was the case). Not quite the twilight zone but it must be a boarder town.,UNK
3145,Finally veered away from my usual sandwich or cold rice noodles and ordered the beef pho....darn it was good!,UNK
3146,"This place is gross, really just smoke and mirrors.\nThey make you think the food is going to be good because of the ambiance. Food is disgusting. Bartender is slow and rude, way over priced and the bathrooms are gross!",UNK
3147,Worst service I have ever experienced. It took two hours plus to get my food. The only good thing was that there is no way to get over served. The food once it came was marginal at best.,UNK
3148,"Lots of beers from Wisconsin available, but only one cider.  Food was OK; we were directed here from a cheese shop because they offered fried cheese curds.  Pretty hopping place!",UNK
3149,Went there for lunch and it took nearly 2 hours. My salad had hair on it and the curry was too watery.,UNK
3150,"Best home-cooked breakfast in the neighborhood, and a welcome new addition to this corner of the city.",UNK
3151,Worst sushi experience in Vegas. Amazed they're still open. Over priced tiny portions. Huge disappointment.,UNK
3152,"Passable, but really cheap sushi.\n\nThe rice is a bit hard and the sushi is a bit too warm, but the service is so friendly and the price so cheap that I would definitely come again.",UNK
3153,Free wifi and awesome atmosphere. Everything on their menu is fantastic.,UNK
3154,As of 9/10/11: came here craving some pastries before my Mont Royal climb and found out from the Gallery lady that the bakery is CLOSED! :( \n\nMy search for almond croissant in Montreal continues...,UNK
3155,"Nothin to write home about,.. We stopped in from the long walk down Vegas Blvd.. Happy hours best deal",UNK
3156,SO DELICIOUS! I got three scoops and asked the worker to surprise me and my tummy was happy.,UNK
3157,"The store was dirty, One thing I was looking for that they didn't have any of was Customer Service. All automated checkouts. Poor selection of national brands.Shopping carts needed a good cleaning.",UNK
3158,"No wonder this restaurant has wonderful reviews, the food was amazing ,kudos to the chef ,cheap ,good portion so tasty !!! Worth the drive",UNK
3159,Awesome! It's a great place to walk through even if you don't plan on spending any money. There's good places to eat also. It's huge and you will always have something to look at. No boredom here.,UNK
3160,Great produce. Reasonably priced.  Close enough to walk from downtown hotels.,UNK
3161,I've had pizza at Ray's Pizza in NYC and this pizza does not come close. It was all soggy. The staff was really nice. I might come back and try some of the other things on the menu.,UNK
3162,This shop is hit or miss. It's usually dirty and the customer service is lax. Go to The Human Bean down the street instead.,UNK
3163,Attitude with over priced merchandise. Walk down the street to walgreens.,UNK
3164,"Decent cuisine, and I'm not that into Chinese food.  Decently priced as well.",UNK
3165,"This place is hyped and overrated. I'd pick a costco polish sausage any day over this. AND, it's kind of a long wait for a friggin HOT DOG. gaahhh.",UNK
3166,"Fish and chips YUUUUMMMMM - now if only I wasn't so hungover that night I might have enjoyed a bit more.\n\nThe place gets packed, but I always expect that one in Vegas and two in any Irish pub",UNK
3167,The only shop we use in Vegas and we live in the far northwest. The guys are really knowledgable and they have great detox and smoke supplies.,UNK
3168,"Had a tex-mex type burger that was pretty good. Can get a little pricey but they have \""combos\"" that I guess is supposed to save you money. Service was good, nothing bad but nothing too great as well.",UNK
3169,Great food! Great service! Love the atmosphere and vibe! Their bean dip is to die for!!! Fresh side table guacamole too!!! Defiantly my favorite Mexican food!,UNK
3170,I had a veggie sandwich.  The bread was fresh and it was pretty darn tastey.  Servers were very friendly and accomodating.,UNK
3171,"Had the best drink list! The food is good, but the people watching was the best part. sit outside and enjoy a beer before a NHL game.",UNK
3172,Every time we com to CP Forum Shops we always pop in to MARC BY MARC JACOBS and every time we get excellent service.  The sales staff is very helpful and go above and beyond!,UNK
3173,Incompetent staff. Medicore food. \n\nNot impressed enough to write much other than that you should go elsewhere.,UNK
3174,Horrible table after setting up a reservation. Seafood platter overpriced. Pizza okay. You are paying for the name.,UNK
3175,Pullman PB&J is still pretty awesome.. the rest sucks! Is suck a technical term?,UNK
3176,We eat at Inca Grill once or twice a month.  We generally go for a half or full chicken with salad and lots of sauces.   Seems to be the best Peruvian restaurant in town... We love it! :),UNK
3177,This place is roach and cricket infested. Think twice before moving here. All they want you for is your money,UNK
3178,I feel that there is not enough variety for the amount of money you have to pay. Souper salad is cheaper and offer practically the same thing. Although they do serve fresher items then souper salad.,UNK
3179,It has finally been put out of its misery.  \nRalph's is closed.\nThere's an urgent care there now.,UNK
3180,Arrived for a late dinner after landing at Vegas. Had a great view of the Bellagio fountains from the patio area. Food was delicious. Would go again.,UNK
3181,We tried to get tickets for the Hobbit. Their computers were down and they were only taking cash. My complaint is that they were not telling people in line. Very poor customer service.,UNK
3182,"Fancy fancy! It was a little much for my taste, but it's definitely nice for a nice meal out. I prefer more laid back establishments. :-)",UNK
3183,Wont last at this location. They don't open early enough. Customer service sucks. And the marketing is horrible. Good luck though!,UNK
3184,Great food worth the wait. The menu even tells you what items will take longer so no surprises. It just gives you more time to eat some cheesy garlic knots. Yummy.,UNK
3185,Worst place ever to watch a game. Audio up audio down audio up audio down the entire game. Who ever complains the loudest gets their way with game sound. Until the next person complains. Food average.,UNK
3186,"-Good selection.\n\n-Convenient parking.\n\n-Friendly employees, helpful.\n\n-Unique food items.\n\n-Good prices, but it adds up if you're not careful.",UNK
3187,Do not use any of the services the are scam the have connection to the organize crime \nThe tow away cars Illegally and no one can stop them doing that,UNK
3188,"Fun bar with good music. Prices are more here then most of freemont but not too bad. I like the 2 stories and that u can be outside but not when its 115 outside. Staff isnt the most engaging or the friendliest but hey, its freemont",UNK
3189,If five pieces is all you can eat for 19.95 then you are good. However with a limited selection for all you can eat and a smaller section of rolls this is not what is advertised. $1 charge for left over pieces too. Must be a tough market.,UNK
3190,New shrimp cocktail was awesome!   Love them!,UNK
3191,The sandwich is pretty good except for the service . Its a little slow considering they have a lot of help behind the counter. Half of them don't even know what they are doing. Need more training for their help.,UNK
3192,Good food ... But priced a little higher for student crowd ...,UNK
3193,Beyond expectation\nNever had food deliverd where\nI needed to let food cool down\nBaked ravoli excellent garlic cheese bread\nExcellent ! Will recommend to anyone and everyone ! Thank you cafe Verdi .,UNK
3194,Excellent job!!,UNK
3195,Worst free car wash ever! After 2300 miles of driving from florida I jumped on the free carwash with oil change deal. the car was not even clean at the end.,UNK
3196,"The owner is awesome, the employees rock, the goods are great, and that's just the inside!",UNK
3197,"Paid for breakfast, and stayed til lunch.  Got to enjoy both meals.  Not a bad deal.  The downside is that the quality and service lacked.",UNK
3198,Wouldn't you know their out of business. I had a Tec come out last summer and he charged me under the table. Half of what the company had quoted me. Plus he still charge me a trip charge only to install $75.00 dollars in parts. Thank God there out of business.,UNK
3199,"This is a great place to order how YOU want not what they have, change your sandwich to have Green Chili, no problem. Love this restaurant.",UNK
3200,I usually drive through for food.  Friendly and quick service.,UNK
3201,"They got me in immediately,  were super nice and very informative!  Will definitely be coming back :)",UNK
3202,"Of all the places I ate while I was in Vegas, this place had the best food by far. The staff was extremely polite, the beer selection was even pretty good for a \""classier\"" restaurant. I highly recommend checking this place out if you're in the area.",UNK
3203,"My GOD this place is way too busy for there to only be 3 TSA agents on staff. Seriously.\n\nThe taxi line is way fast and super efficient, which is beautiful. Other than that, it's an airport. Not much else to say.",UNK
3204,This place is very good for lunch in Charlotte. I have only tried the pastas but the food is made fresh and is well priced. The wait can be long at times but there are a lot of lines. A good fast casual restaurant to try in Charlotte.,UNK
3205,We have 3 better places out in Summerlin and there was nothing remarkable about my experience here. Service was so so even with the House manager working the room.,UNK
3206,"Always friendly, Call ahead and they've got it waiting.  I wish they could just know by my # what I always order.",UNK
3207,HORRIBLE!!!! It's a Friday in Vegas and there are 3 customer service people working. We have waited over an hour. Will never rent here again. Use another car rental agency. Don't waste your time.,UNK
3208,"Just ok.  Not very much meat in #8 grill chicken sandwich.  Ordered 2 iced coffes, but they could only make 1.  I still choose Hue Tai for vietnamese sandwiches.",UNK
3209,well it is free and this is Vegas,UNK
3210,This McD's service sucks. I have been here numerous times and have had some sort of bad service every single time.,UNK
3211,Great view overlooking the strip way overpriced got two non alcoholic drinks a shrimp cocktail and a side Caesar salad and the bill was $37,UNK
3212,"Meal includes a trip to the excellent salad bar. Fried flounder, shrimp and scallops don't disappoint. Orion rings are very good. Hush puppies are very good.",UNK
3213,Amazing gym! Coaches are great! Their open gym and summer camp are great programs! Hands down best place in AZ for gymnastics!,UNK
3214,One of the worst for placing orders to go they never answer there phone and when they do they never get the order right !! Warning don't call a order in !!!,UNK
3215,"This place is perfection! After going a few times with my boyfriend, I can see how one could crave some chicken and waffles on a Sunday morning.  Don't sleep in too late though because you will wait if you hit the church crowd.  Don't skip the grits!",UNK
3216,"I have tried to call Sal's a few times and they area always \""closing\"" or won't deliver a few miles away.  If you are close and it is dinner time, great.  If not, don't bother.",UNK
3217,This is very near to my place. Not crowded and good place to do your quick shopping.,UNK
3218,This place was terrible. The pictures I saw on yelp did not match what was on the menu and the staff was awful. To top it off screaming kids and you can't even have a mimosa with your brunch.,UNK
3219,"I went to the free zone with my girlfriend for a drag show. The drag show was not bad, but the bartenders gave me nasty looks. I would have stayed if I felt welcome but I did not. It was sad because i was hoping for a good time.",UNK
3220,More like 3.5 stars.  The atmosphere is really nice & the food is pretty good. I wasn't crazy about what I got but I did like it & the portions were good. My husband really liked his dish. We will be going back for sure to check it out again!,UNK
3221,"Very nice new location, next to Springs Preserve. They used to be located across the freeway at Lorenzi Park. You'll see two main exhibit halls that contain very useful and historic information about the Las Vegas area. A good way to get away from the Strip life and become more educated.",UNK
3222,My fiance and I purchased a groupon deal for an hour of archery lessons.  I have never shot a bow and arrow before so I was excited and a bit nervous at the same time.  Zoey was an awesome instructor!!  I'm hooked and will definitely be coming back.,UNK
3223,"Visited last week and was very happy. It took a few minutes longer than expected but it was well worth the wait. WILL return, next time in town.",UNK
3224,"Went here for breakfast today. Got the plain bagel with plain cream cheese and breakfast burrito with sausage. Have to say that I'm not impressed and the burro was very very bland. I give this place a \""meh\"".",UNK
3225,This place was filthy. We couldn't get into our room for an hour because the locks were broke. Our TV didn't work and they said there was nothing they could do.,UNK
3226,Entrees are too salty. Lobster bisque soup was a failure but Crab cake is one of those Must-Try.,UNK
3227,Yum! Really great food. Happy to see a location in green valley! Busy but no wait for a table. Food service a little slow but worth the wait! Great brunch for $35 for 2 ppl.,UNK
3228,Great food and great staff.  Very friendly and a great atmosphere.  Go there everytime I'm in the area!!..,UNK
3229,Sushi was good but they forgot about the Chicken Katsu that I ordered. I can't remember the last time I left a restraurant hungry.,UNK
3230,Cool place for beers and sports. Not so great food. Chicken tasted like it was boiled then grilled. Pizza was undercooked. They got us a new one which was okay. Our server Victoria was really nice though.,UNK
3231,"This store was friendly enough, but didnt really seem to know what to do when i needed a new sim card. I went to a different verizon store in Vegas the next day, and they took care of me right away.",UNK
3232,Fast production/shipping and Excellent customer service. Our lapel pins turned out just how we wanted. Adzonwheelz will definitely be using Logo Executives again.,UNK
3233,They do a god job in my pedicure just think need spend little more time on foot massage,UNK
3234,"I love this place 4am-9am haha\nSo I tried it for dinner one night, and I was pleasantly surprised. It was delicious and really good quality. \n\n\nStill a great after hours dive feel",UNK
3235,Food came out way too quick for the price that cost. That probably explains why it tasted like last nights warmed up leftovers.,UNK
3236,Fair selection. Beautiful store. Zero Opus X. Marginally friendly salespeople.,UNK
3237,Been coming here for 10 years. Always tasty and the lady behind the glass is nice as hell! :),UNK
3238,Won't be going back to this place anytime soon.,UNK
3239,"Eh. Nothing bad to say nothing good. Service, was very average, drinks were average, and the bar was packed. No where to sit, no where to stand, but other than that it's fun to check out. Just buy a few drinks somewhere else because of the high prices.",UNK
3240,Food was alright but customer service left a lot to be desired.,UNK
3241,The food was excellent. Very helpful wait staff. Our overall experience was wonderful.,UNK
3242,"It's a bit pricey, but the patio and the bar are both good environments. The filet is probably the best thing on the menu. I like sitting in the lounge of the bar.. Nice comfortable seats and the dining area seems sterile to me.",UNK
3243,"Ill give that hotel 1 star or motel style ,no cufe in room  i asked Y ?they told me even belagio  hotel dont have ,are u comparing to that !!! Slow as speed internet , no buffet. Away from strip its not worth it",UNK
3244,"The pesto pizza was very good, the potato pizza was pretty bland.",UNK
3245,The food is decent. We go here mainly because its close and they have a big game room for the kids. The kids have tons of fun every time we go here.,UNK
3246,Very nice steakhouse. Great ambiance. Very nice staff. Our waiter AJ was great. The food was very good. I expected my steak to be more tender. But everyone else in our large party only had good things to say.,UNK
3247,The staff is always friendly and chipper in the morning.  Bagel and Iced Tea always done to perfection.  Wish it had longer hours.,UNK
3248,"This mall is huge!  They have tons of shopping options, parking and eateries. I like their location and that they are fully indoors.",UNK
3249,"This place was horrible..service was a disaster, food was ok but unless you feel like waiting and hour for food and having people in the back argue with you over the food then I would highly recommend never coming here, there are much much better Pho places.",UNK
3250,"Menu looked good but the breakfast burritos were horrible.  Destroyed my day, should have went to Fausto's!  Never again and my boss agreed.",UNK
3251,"Worst General Tso's Chicken EVER!!!  Mushy chicken, awful sauce!!  Had the worst stomache ache followed by explosive (you know what) 1 hour after eating it!!",UNK
3252,"Love this place, sushi is good and great customer service!",UNK
3253,"Not too impressed with the TJ max side, but love home goods! I could spend a solid hour looking through their deals!",UNK
3254,"This place has gone down hill, loved outback back in the day, now the food is blan and overpriced",UNK
3255,It is hard to find but it is definitely worth it!  You can either pick up a pizza or just get a slice immediately.  They are open late and it is great to get a slice after going out at night.,UNK
3256,"Went here on a working lunch and had the crab cake sandwich. In hindsight, I should've tried the fish sandwich, which they claim can't be eaten by one person alone. The food was fine, though, and it was relatively inexpensive. Decent lunch place.",UNK
3257,A fake plant in the corner was so thick with dust it made me question the cleanliness of the kitchen. Every door was dirty even the entrance doors which were glass and easy to clean. Food was not awesome.,UNK
3258,Went to see the Song with my wife on our date night! Very clean theatre. We will be back,UNK
3259,Took over 10 min in the drive thru. ..1st time at this location.   The woman who took my order would not let me finish speaking long enough to get understand my order... get it together DD...,UNK
3260,Stayed in the South Tower on the 14th floor and it was quiet as a mouse all weekend. Kind of bare bones rooms but comfortable and large. You might want to bring your own pillows. The view is spectacular. No complaints!,UNK
3261,I will only come here for the house margaritas. I'm not a fan of the food here.,UNK
3262,"You will get the shits after eating here.... tried several times since I work close....  myself and coworkers all have the same result with different menu items.....  pass by, eat somewhere else.\n\nYou will thank me later",UNK
3263,Went back for the fried icecream - but that was all I was interested in. Everything else I could make better in the comfort of my own kitchen.\n\nNote that it wasn't cheap since they no longer have half off but instead a lower priced late night menu.,UNK
3264,Fries were cold and the tomatoe slices were merely laid on top. I know this is airport food but plenty of fast food places make a better cheesesteak,UNK
3265,"Decent food. Known for the portion side. Flavor was alright. With as many spots there are in Vegas, I doubt I'd come back again.",UNK
3266,One more fantastic spot that I've driven by and not stopped in. BIG MISTAKE! 10$ om let and potatoes that ranks up with the best. Going to be part of my routine now.... can't wait to hit more of this cool menu!,UNK
3267,I usually do not go to buffet because low quality foods they make.. Wicked Spoon Buffet was just okay.. Buffet is buffet.,UNK
3268,"The start is for atmosphere, food is awful. No flavor whatsoever. Drinks are over priced . I was expecting a good Margarita for 13 dollars but it was just like the food. No flavor. I will not come back nor recommend anyone .",UNK
3269,What a cool place...literally and figuratively!  The place is comfortably cool and the yogurt choices excellent!  I'll be baaaack!,UNK
3270,"Truly great service. However, the grub lacked luster all around. Granted I had takeout both times but it is unlikely I would go back. :(",UNK
3271,"When I visit Phoenix, I sometimes stay at the Hyatt hotel so Networks is naturally were I eat.  It is a convenient and safe choice n the neighborhood.  Although most of the selections tend to lean towards the fast food genre, you can find comfort in their coconut shrimp, or chicken sandwiches.",UNK
3272,Food Was Edible.   In my opinion (and my families) the food was flavorless. \nProbably won't be back.,UNK
3273,This was a horrible meal.  I went with my brother and we both were sick afterwards.  The food is quantity not quality.  I don't want to ever go back.,UNK
3274,"The burgers are large and greasy.  Thats about it.  If you like waiting for over an hour plus to get average food, this is your place.  The diarrhea is free tho.",UNK
3275,"Mussels French fries apple tart tatin chicken or steak sandwich, escargot, French onion soup, n bread are all good. Avg food is hamburger, seafood crepe (premade not fresh crepe).",UNK
3276,I had this for take out earlier in the week and was really disappointed. I did order Chicken Pad Thai which is probably the most basic of Thai dishes but still it wasn't nearly as good as other Thai places I have had. This place has potential but did not deliver during my first experience.,UNK
3277,Came here for lunch. Great tomato bisque and 4 cheese grilled cheese sandwich. Definitely a great place for lunch.,UNK
3278,One of my favorite happy hour places in the Scottsdale area. The staff is always prompt and friendly without being over bearing and their menu is very solid.  \n\nMake sure you give any of their oven cooked flat breads a try as they are all fantastic,UNK
3279,"My third purchase, yes I like this place.  The service dept is great too.  My salesperson drove to Tucson to get the exact car I wanted.  Another fine buying experience.",UNK
3280,I got an oil change and AC recharge for my car.  They squeezed me in with no appointment and everything was done quickly.  I am happy with my results.,UNK
3281,"I came back after the renovation, thinking they had improved. Atmosphere, furniture was an improvement. However after they took our order, it took them at least 30 min.to bring ut out, and our orders was not complete. Not coming back....",UNK
3282,Just had lunch today with a few of my girlfriends. I ordered the fish tacos and would not hesitate to order them again next time. I'm not much of a restaurant critic so I'll finish by saying the service was great and food was delicious!,UNK
3283,"Absolutely love this little place.  Support your local guys!  Nice bikes, wonderful customer service.",UNK
3284,Loved it! They are super nice and patient! Not only do they do an amazing job but they are also super quick! Definitely always going there from now on,UNK
3285,"This is a good sized park, looks like you can rent bikes here as well. Great place to be on a sunny day, lots of people, families, and dogs!\n\n\nNext time i go I think i'll try out the greenway connector nearby",UNK
3286,"OMG this place is so amazing, the food is so delicious, and the price for the portion and the quality is totally worth it. The staff are very friendly. I m so happy we finally have a great tonkatsu place like this in Vegas",UNK
3287,"Damn good Pizza!!! Great crust, great toppings and tasty sauce! What more can I ask for? Comin' back here real soon! Yeah!",UNK
3288,Nasty pizza and good service do not equal 5 stars.,UNK
3289,"This was my first time at Oregano's. The good pizza, but not the best! Maybe I should try something different next time.",UNK
3290,Good pizza.  Loved the sweet tomato sauce.,UNK
3291,"I loved this place. I had the prime rib, I enjoyed every bite. The service was immpacable.  Worth every penny.",UNK
3292,"Comfy seats, good service, below average food. Don't forget to bring your parking pass to get it validated.",UNK
3293,"I appreciate that the chai is real tea and not made from some syrup or concentrate, but the couple times I've gotten it, it hasn't been mixed to my liking. With JoBot the honey and spices seem to to always just sit sadly at the bottom of my cup.",UNK
3294,"For the cost to stay there the value is excellent, just don't expect the best accommodations. You are literally sleeping in a giant Hooters restaurant.",UNK
3295,"Decent breakfast, nothing too memorable about it.",UNK
3296,Better places to eat in Vegas then here honestly ...,UNK
3297,"Never have I ever wrote a review for place, but I just had to with this particular place. Long story short I would not recommend ever buying a car from this place and these people, terrible service. Terrible everything! No need to say anymore.",UNK
3298,This company is family owned and well operated. They will be there when you need it. Today out shower broke and got stuck with water running. His tech got here in time to fix the issue right away. Thanks for the great service!,UNK
3299,Terrible! Worst foot massage ever n I've been to many. Total lack of effort. I almost  wanted to quit halfway through. DO NOT WASTE Your time n money here!!!,UNK
3300,Not very good. And I was hopeful. I saw him 25 years ago and he was hilarious. Not as much now.,UNK
3301,"Clean, very tasty, and I love the creativity in the dishes.  Well worth the price and I recommend trying different dishes because with each new dish I try I have not been disappointed.",UNK
3302,Erin Kelly did my hair and she was so personable and was great at consulting with me she is very talented. I enjoyed sipping on some wine from Postinos while Erin was doing my hair it was a great experience I highly recommend Erin kelly!,UNK
3303,Nom,UNK
3304,"If I could give a half a star I would. The service here is absolutely terrible to the point it's a joke. Do they even have servers working here???? This place could be great but it's not; flat our terrible, over priced, and just bad",UNK
3305,"Beware - they lie! I've never used scuba equipment before, and they are supposed to be the experts. They are only experts at taking your money. You can not return any items. Too many people in the class. We had 2 people quit because they couldn't get assistance.",UNK
3306,I would definitely check this off the list and not go back. Food was not enjoyable. There were 7 of us and it was our last stop from our 24 hour Vegas buffet pass. None of us finished our food and hardly went back for seconds.,UNK
3307,"Chicken is very good. Fish and shrimp are great. Sides are good too but don't leave without a pint or quart of their gumbo. Like lasagna, it's much better the next day after all of the seasoning have soaked into everything.",UNK
3308,We always order the burger with bacon and top it off with a scrambled egg. The shakes are very good. Each time we go it seems to get better,UNK
3309,Quick and easy to rent a car even on a holiday.,UNK
3310,Consistently Good.Been to several around the states and never been disapointed.Great beer and beer selection.Both the food and finger food good also.Im usually get appetizers only and focus on the beer.,UNK
3311,Incredibly rude staff. I asked for help with a curtain pattern and two staff members bickered over who had to help me. Also when I went to check out another two staff members were arguing at the cash register. I will never be back!,UNK
3312,"Overpriced.  Went in duing happy hour and was charged full price, $11 margartia.  Food is OK.  There are a lot of other better places.",UNK
3313,"Super professional, beautiful setting, tools are taken out of the sterile packaging right in front of you.  They offer a top notch manicure and I would not go anywhere else when I'm in the area.",UNK
3314,I think this place is fine. Why others give only 1-2 stars?,UNK
3315,"Brunch is El Dorado's savior.  As a food fight restaurant goes, I still think they have the worst service of any.  I would give their service a six, and their food and 8.",UNK
3316,"Not the best place, but decent. Kind of like a fly over state but as restaurant.",UNK
3317,The hotel is very dated. Some of the dealers are super rude! The taxi line attendant was very rude. Won't stay there again!,UNK
3318,"A must eat place in vegas, this is old vegas, great italian, but you can eat a steak or stone crabs if you want.  Must get the osso bucco and the creamed corn.  If you are on a date get a booth",UNK
3319,"The food over all was good, but it's pretty ordinary.  It's not super expensive, but it's not cheap either.  I have to say that with the food like this, the price should be a bit lower.  I liked the carpaccio though.",UNK
3320,The best!,UNK
3321,"If I could give this company a zero I would.  The business manager \""Mike\""  is completely unprofessional and incompitent.  On top of that he smells like smoke. Have another cigarette.",UNK
3322,"Not bad, just average. The service is attentive, the food however wasn't good. The people who wrote all the positive reviews must rate Taco Bell 5 stars. Covering food with bland sauce, serving it with rice, beans and cheese doesn't make it Mexican.",UNK
3323,"I tried them again, and they've redeemed themselves.  I went back and the food was much better so I change my original opinion of 1 star.  The previous visit that was so horrible was a drive through visit. This last time I actually ate inside so maybe that's key.",UNK
3324,Mom and pop joint located inside of mountains edge. I come here for the convenience but the food is good. Try their chicken fried steak with biscuits and gravy. If you bring in a coffee cup and leave it on their wall you'll always get free refills.,UNK
3325,"Above average location. Staff was friendly and attentive, food was solid and cooked as ordered. No wait when we arrived. Their 4 for $15 menu is great! Soup, Salad, Entree and dessert all for fifteen bucks is a DEAL! :O)",UNK
3326,"The service here sucks basketball sized balls! 30 minutes to get a server to my table, 30 to get my burger to the table. Should've gone to the Waffle House",UNK
3327,"Best Sushi I have ever had. Absolutely amazing. And the rolls are just huge. Largest rolls I have found at any Sushi restaurant. The Gila Monster and Poison Ivy rolls are just to die for.  If you are looking for sushi in the west valley, they cannot be beat.",UNK
3328,"This place is always packed. So if you need assistance I strongly suggest making an appointment. I showed up a little late and they still fit me in and helped me with my issue. Great customer service, just make sure you make an appointment.",UNK
3329,"I think the low rating is not deserved. Service was great. Beer cold and good lunch. Oh, did I mention eye candy too?....The only drawback was that I think you can find better NFL drink specials at other bars in the area.",UNK
3330,"I haven't really ever found anything that is useful to me or my style.  I love Cost Plus, Stein Mart and Anthropologie more.  This stuff is just too high priced.  There isn't enough of a varied selection (everything is the same style).",UNK
3331,"Having the breakfast special. which come with two eggs, pancakes or toast, potatoes or has brown, and link sausage or turkey patty for $4.99 Not bad for a deal that's a lot of food!",UNK
3332,"Food was good, however I'm not sure what happened to the service.  The typically good service was replaced some terrible and I mean terrible servers.",UNK
3333,"I tried the shrimp and chips and they were tasty.  The shrimp was a little salty, but with the dipping sauce they tasted fine.  I liked the \""chips\"" a lot.  After reading the other review I'm nervous to try the fish and chips.",UNK
3334,"Chris and Josh were really fun! No monotone action, they treated us like we were the only customers in the entire store! This is by far the best customer service I have ever had in a restaurant! Thank you! :)",UNK
3335,h\u00e4tte mir mehr kundenservice gew\u00fcnscht,UNK
3336,"Pump action shotty, homeboy..\n\nShoot it.\n\n\nMy boss paid for me, so I can't complain about value per dollar spent, but this place really has it all.",UNK
3337,Talk about a hole in the wall. No frills at all here. One page paper menu with only a handful of dishes on it. Worth it for the pho and the price can't be beat.,UNK
3338,"If you don't like friendly service, the nicest patrons and great food and drinks then this place is not for you.",UNK
3339,"My favorite pizza in Madison.  The dough is great, and cooked quickly in the brick oven.  My daughter enjoys watching the brick oven cooking process, which you can see from most of the restaurant.  Always has a few pretty good local beers on tap, and tasty homemade pudding for after the pizza.",UNK
3340,"Rotating taps. $9 flights. Best pretzel bun in town. I've never left unsatisfied. If I had to complain, it gets super loud in here.",UNK
3341,I adore Karma Connection! The owners are so nice and informative! Their merchandise  and selection is really growing! They have new jewelry every time I go in!,UNK
3342,Another fine dinner at China Village.  I ordered Ma-Po bean curd for dinner.  I had enough to share with my dinner mate.  The service was excellent as usual.  The hostess was very concerned that my group enjoyed their dinner.,UNK
3343,I often stop here for my coffee on the way into work and to get gas. Service is usually fast and friendly. They have a fairly regular staff here who all know what they're doing.,UNK
3344,"My wife and son purchased 4 different cupcakes as a surprise and they ate two of them and both ended up throwing up that night.  We'll NEVER go back.  They are not very good anyway, they have way too much icing and not enough cupcake.",UNK
3345,"The new owner really helped this paper go to the next level. The content is fresh and the design very magazine like. Glad it's still publishing, now that the Tribune is gone",UNK
3346,One of best dining experiences I've had in Phoenix.  Looking forward to my next time there.,UNK
3347,The only thing I miss about living in Phoenix is that I can no longer frequent Caffe Boa.  You just can't go wrong here.  The food is outstanding.  Don't let the strip mall fool you.  This place is a gem.,UNK
3348,"Went to this place since it was close to our house, but I wasn't all that impressed. Fine if you want simple Mexican food, but I've had much better for the value.",UNK
3349,Super clean fresh fish!! Best sushi I've had off strip!,UNK
3350,Always a good time. Excellent set up for any weather situation. They tend to have live music on Fridays and Saturdays. The Wine Vault sells local beers an wine ice cold available for purchase by the glass and bottle. Very knowledgeable staff and chill atmosphere. Dog and kid friendly as well.,UNK
3351,"I could eat at Swish every day! The food is really good and I've never been unhappy with the service. I highly recommend the Kobe Beef \""Hungry Plate\""",UNK
3352,"Stay away from this cleaning company.........After confirming appointment, they suddenly cancel your appointment a day before and never give you a other cleaning date for the next two months.I will never buy their coupon from groupon anymore.",UNK
3353,Basic pizza place downtown with downtown prices. The pizza was good and the guy working was really nice but the music was way too loud for an early Wednesday lunch and I didn't feel like the two slices and soda were worth the $8 price tag.,UNK
3354,Food and service both deserve this rating as does the other location outside of Chicago.,UNK
3355,Visited this Verizon store today not impressed with management.,UNK
3356,"I used to really love Bluphies, but about 2 years ago (around when they renovated) I feel like they lost their charm. Their dinner entrees got much more expensive and lacked their original substance. It's still solid, but not a regular for us anymore.",UNK
3357,"Overpriced, over cooked and bland. Did not enjoy the food at all. On the bright side, the ambiance was nice.",UNK
3358,"Spotless place!  The food is great.  Love the burgers and pizzas.  I am not a thin crust guy, but their thin crust is awesome!  The service is fast and friendly and the patio is very cool!",UNK
3359,Seriously the BEST peanut butter pie I have ever had! No wonder it is award winning!  The caramel candies are also super amazing!  I can eat an entire bag of the Junk Food popcorn in one sitting.  Love this shop for special treats!,UNK
3360,"This store sucks.  The merchandise, teams, everything is limited.  The store looks 1/2 empty.  The employees are friendly but they enjoy chatter with each other more.  I rather hit the mall or online.",UNK
3361,Terrible and unorganized.  I think everybody was excited to have Los Dos in Ahwatukee but after giving this place two chances I'm over it.  I won't go back.,UNK
3362,It was just ok!! All the salsas didn't have no flavor. The seviche was sweet I was not expecting that and the tacos were not that good kinda bland nothing special... Probably not coming back and I would not recommended either..,UNK
3363,"First time at Zio: I was welcomed very well. I had a glass of Zin suggested by John. Good and affordable. I chose to take out and ordered the homemade  fettuccini with spinach, white beans and tomatoes. Nice flavors. I'll go back.",UNK
3364,"Good pizza, been there many times. The girl behind the counter tonight was rude, slow and mildly retarded.  Go to the Arcadia location.",UNK
3365,Finally got to try Bachi. Great burgers! Our server was very helpful explaining and describing the menu to us. Shuffle fries are good as well.,UNK
3366,Two words. Happy Hour. That is all.,UNK
3367,"Best late night place to eat after a night of partying and whatevers.  Good food, nuff said.",UNK
3368,Nice neighborhood place.  The only drawback is number of flavors.  I feel the yogurt texture is much creamier than other stores.  Easy to get to if you live in Mountains Edge.\n\nCute benches for chairs and great music.,UNK
3369,Its everything you ever wanted for your home and all the other things you never knew you needed. Even if you don't buy anything it is a great place to get inspiration (i need a farmhouse sink in my life).  They have cinnamon buns too!,UNK
3370,this is a fun place to go for a cosume if you are an entertainer or just for fun! They have some new and almost new quality clothing and you can get 30% off if you bring a donation the staff was cool sometime you can find some cool stuff antiques other random stuff.,UNK
3371,"Strictly a place for Seniors, they love the terrible food which is salty and high in fat typical bar food.  The service is terrible, and the bartender spends most of the time chatting with friends at the bar and ignoring the customers.  Go into Phoenix if your looking for good food.",UNK
3372,"Wow, store isn't even open 10 minutes after their posted time, talk about great customer service!",UNK
3373,"Really great job done on my car with a good price to boot. I recommend this place for your car audio needs for sure. Tony, the guy who runs the place, really takes care of you as a customer. I have gone here twice already and couldn't be more pleased with the service!",UNK
3374,Ambience in the garden is magnificent with attention given to the landscaping. Staffing by management was less than adequate. Pleasant server was overwhelmed and lacked support. Manager was oblivious when this was brought to their attention.,UNK
3375,"Great food , the salmon was to die for.\nThe waiter was informative and had a stupid attitude when we had questions ,good price  4 star since it was my first time here and I hate rude and very unfriendly waiter",UNK
3376,Really good quality food on par with the best Indian restaurants in this region. Simple menus and the convenience of a world food market while you wait!,UNK
3377,"I went there for Botox and the Vail was bad , they did not open it in front of me like it should be done but in a back room , The effect was 0 \nSo there you go $450 out of the window",UNK
3378,"Been there 3 times. Good food, but service could definitely be quicker. Also I have had multiple problems when it comes to credit card charges. They overcharged me last night and a few weeks ago gave the wrong card back to my girlfriend.",UNK
3379,"While this place has great ambiance, I won't be back. I really have had better tasting vegetarian food elsewhere :(",UNK
3380,I come here with my friends and the food is really good and I would come here all the time and I would recommend this place too the people I know .. The staff are so awesome,UNK
3381,"This is a decent happy hour spot.  I go here occasionally with a group of my girlfriends (ages 20s and 30s) and we reserve one of the big corner booths.  Sushi is good, drinks are excellent.  Bill is usually around $30.  Service is decent.",UNK
3382,"The man who works here is NOT friendly at all. When we arrived we were the only people in the place and no employees to be found.  We sat down and waited 10 minutes before getting up and yelling \""hello\"" before any one came out. He seemed very bothered that we were there.",UNK
3383,This was a very clean place but the service was not that great. When it was time for the birthday song the server did not have the cake out. Also she was asking us questions while were trying to take pictures of our child with the top cheese Chuckie.,UNK
3384,"Excellent sandwiches...the robbie and the cole turkey were fantastic!!! Service was quick, seating is really limited but as deli's go this is one of the best!",UNK
3385,"The restaurant did their level best to make it up to me, so here's another star for giving a damn. Thanks!",UNK
3386,First time here with my family. Was greeted right away. Very small and cute place. Lovely house turned into restaurant.,UNK
3387,Place is awesome! Wish we didn't wait till our last night in Montreal to go here!,UNK

3389,"Just a bar, nothing that great I'm afraid.",UNK
3390,Cute little authentic place. Chimichanga wasnt that bad.,UNK
3391,My husband  and i were very pleased  with the house cleaning  service we received from  Pristine!  The cleaners were very prompt and professional.  Our house  sparkled after they left! We have already scheduled another appointment.,UNK
3392,The Cornish Pasty on University is very small place. There is more room and outdoor seating at the one in Mesa which is a little farther but worth it also. They have great Pasty's!!! They are truely gourmet hot pockets! YUM!,UNK
3393,Back a year later and they are still as good as ever.,UNK
3394,Great service and atmosphere.  The food is good - comfort food for the soul.,UNK
3395,"Located in Circus Circus Hotel Casino on The Las Vegas Strip. Ok so I went for breakfast, I was not wowed. It wasn't bad just not great. There is better and cheaper in Las Vegas. Live it up you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!",UNK
3396,The Super burrito is awesome! Will be returning soon.,UNK
3397,"Darby made my drink and she was terrible. She was not following proper procedure to create the beverage and when I pointed it out, she rolled her eyes. \n\nThis store constantly has issues with beverage quality and the baristas are not friendly.",UNK
3398,I have never had a worse experience with any company in my entire life.  I cannot wait until my contract is up,UNK
3399,Shut up. Go Here. And get the Mac Gnarly Burger or any burger...yum.\n\nBeachy vibe...awesome fries too man i'm hungry. Just do it.,UNK
3400,Good food. Patio was very nice. No complaints and good drink specials. I Recommend it!,UNK
3401,"By far, The Pink Pepper is the best Thai food in the East Valley.  Their buffet is reasonably priced and delicious!",UNK
3402,I have never had a bad meal at this place! The breads are to die for and the sauces are amazing! However the best thing on the menu is their Rice Balls! One of our top places to go!,UNK
3403,"For faster service: park, get out of your car, and walk up to the window.",UNK
3404,love love love this place!!! got all my Korean food needs here!!!,UNK
3405,I came all the way down there to use a groupon and you refused to take it via my phone.  Shame on you for not honoring it.  GROUPON USERS BEWARE.,UNK
3406,"Food is great, I've only had the beef pho and spring rolls. My only complaint is the portion compared to the price. Pho da lat is not as good but you get more for your money.",UNK
3407,"Oh yeah, this place absolutely blows. I'll enter in a new reason (though all mentioned are perfectly valid): Limited Clint Eastwood selections in the movie department. Fie!",UNK
3408,"I've been seeing Lauretta for a few months now, and she has been nothing short of excellent! She uses only the best products which produce the best results! She's so sweet and professional, great skin rules and so does she!",UNK
3409,I am sorry I hadn't been here before. From the outside you have no idea what hidden treasures are inside. Everything we had as appetizers and our meals were great.  I love the new variety to our palettes. I highly recommend you come here.,UNK
3410,Fucking worst restaurant I ever ate. Grand lux is the best tasting 24/7 cafe in Vegas and is only marginally more expensive than this shit hole. Service was decent but I hate places that jack up prices and are no better than a coco's restaurant.,UNK
3411,Great stadium to watch a ball game. The overall feel is small so there is not a bad seat in the house. \nLots of things to do around the stadium and there seems to always be a good crowd in attendance. \nTickets are reasonable so make sure you stop by.,UNK
3412,Talk about rude & mean.  This place is awful!,UNK
3413,"Great restaurant! \nThe service is just as it should be and the food is tasty. Plus, it's a \""bring your own wine\"" kind of restaurants which makes it a place where prices are reasonable. \nWill definitely go back!",UNK
3414,"First I must say the food was excellent. Definitely a must try if you are a burger fan. However, service was lacking energy and familiarity with menu, hope to go back and possibly just sit at the bar!",UNK
3415,"They don't honor coupons from \""Coupon Clipper\"" app.  They require the coupon to be printed. Not cool. I won't be back.",UNK
3416,"Yum!  Had a fantastic dinner here!  Impeccable service, generous bartender, fabulous food.\n\nTry The Whale appetizer!  So good!!!",UNK
3417,Cute spot and convenient location. Love the style and decor just like their sister restaurants.  It was a great spot for lunch with coworkers and our tummies were all happy from our meals. Food was delicious and service was great.,UNK
3418,Extensive menu.  Food ok but a little greasy but otherwise not bad.  Typical service at a Vietnamese restaurant.,UNK
3419,"Water tasted metallic. Service was quite awkward/inattentive. \n\nRamen noodles were good, but broth was anaemic. Lychee smoothie tasted powdery and artificial.",UNK
3420,"I work close by, and I compare all Mexican restaurants to Si Senor's by default.  Nando's falls far short, very bland and boring food.  It's a shame, I wanted to like this place but the food is tasteless.",UNK
3421,That was fun.,UNK
3422,"I brought a pepperoni pie home from Pat's once and it was completely forgettable. The sauce was average and, like the cheese, not plentiful enough. It wasn't any better cold the next day.",UNK
3423,"it's SO good! and i love the fact that it's a hidden gem in Cosmo (although everyone knows where it is)\n\nI wish there's more topping they could add to the pizza, other than that everything was yummyumm",UNK
3424,Cute old fashioned ice cream parlor. seemed to have a lot of regulars. we were just there to get a banana split which was very good\n\nenjoyed the family circus cartoons,UNK
3425,Great view of the Bellagio fountains. Food and service was a total missed.,UNK
3426,Pizza was average for New York style. Delivery was pretty quick but the pizza was cold and way over-priced. 25 dollars for one pizza is a little ridiculous.,UNK
3427,"We live close so we eat at Billy's a lot but never have been disappointed. It was the first time trying the Southern pulled pork BBQ instead of the usual suspects. It was good. And they sell Mecktoberfest. All in all, still good.",UNK
3428,"Awesome food, best shrimp ceviche in town!  Awesome prices and I've never had a bad experience there - all the employees are always extremely nice.  Only down side is they no longer have their location in Queen Creek!",UNK
3429,Love Corbin's. Took my Mom and wife for Mother's Day brunch. I had the Mexican Frittata. YUM!,UNK
3430,"Quite possibly the best Pho in Phoenix. The broth has a great flavor, and the Thai iced tea (not on the menu, but ask for it) was the perfect amount of sweetness. Plus, the service was great. I'd rate it higher if I could!",UNK
3431,"My expectations were high and the food was just so-so. Got the chicken and waffles.  Chicken was pretty good, waffles not so great.  Don't feel the need to revisit.",UNK
3432,This is my local Wells Fargo and i have to say they have excellent customer service and have helped me out with a few problems without any hassle.,UNK
3433,The place is nice and Big! lots of seating space with a few comfy seats such as lazyboy style seats. In a really cute house looking thing. The service is ok. A little more friendly would really make this place pop.,UNK
3434,Really good place to cure your hangover. Lots of sweets and deep fried food to relieve a crazy night in vegas. Only thing is its a bit pricey...but who cares in vegas! Definitely worth trying.,UNK
3435,"Good atmosphere. Decent prices (except for the sangria @ $9). The rice was awful, dry and hard. The salsa however was excellent, especially the green salsa. I had the chile relleno, which was pretty tasty.",UNK
3436,The buffet was decent but avoid the sushi at all costs.  I had to spit it out in my napkin.  It was honestly the foulest tasting food I have eaten all year.,UNK
3437,Plus+s\nDrive Thru Rx\nPhoto\nRed Box for Videos\nRight by my House\nNear Pita Jungle\n\nDownside\nNo Parking\nSlow Service,UNK
3438,Great food. SUPER FRIENDLY. I love small buiness owners more so than them truly authentic Phillys. Check them out and support  them.,UNK
3439,Everything tastes so fresh. .I got two fish tacos and a chicken burritos. .yummy yummy in my tummy...,UNK
3440,"For a membership only place, this place was very sub par. The food was something I would expect from a local dive bar, not a country club.\n\nThe only redeeming factor is the view of the course/camelback and the strong drinks from a limited bar.",UNK
3441,Great breakfast at the deli.  I love the biscuits and gravy with sausage links.  Most employees are very good to the customers.   Manager does a great job with the store.,UNK
3442,"It is great that there is a Greek place open 24 hours, but their food is really only mediocre.",UNK
3443,"The egg sandwich was good, but macarons were ugly, service was poor, wait time was long and prices are high.",UNK
3444,Just spent the week at Paris la's Vegas. We had dinner at their buffet everything. I tried was luke warm and over cooked and very very very bland.  I would skip this one for sure!,UNK
3445,Be sure to get their Indian Curry. You won't be disappointed.,UNK
3446,"This review is for food only!  TERRIBLE!  I know its a chain, but come on!  Don't bother if you have any inkling of eating.  Good if you just want to watch the game and drink beer...",UNK
3447,"they took real good care of our Lucy cat...and were very professional and honest.  very small location, so don't be fooled or put off by the front.",UNK
3448,If you order from here get it take out. It took them 2 hours to deliver my one pizza. My poor kids were starving and I didn't even get an apology. I kept calling and they kept saying it would come in 5 mins. They need to get their act together.,UNK
3449,don't go to this store if you don't want to sit for 30 minutes when it's not busy just to get a new iphone. place is full of employees walking around.,UNK
3450,"Good produce for a good price!  Among the local grocery stores, Sprouts probably offers the best value.  And there are always good weekly deals!  The processed foods are a little pricy, but that's only because they are organic or specialty foods.",UNK
3451,OK didn't want to cook it was 10pm so thought pick up this to take home yule never go here. Kfc is way better.  This place chicken sucks. All there food sucks.,UNK
3452,"Warm and inviting ambiance.  Breakfast panini and burritos are very good.  Plenty of froo-froo drinks but I like their basic hot, black coffee. Pastry selection is tasty, too.",UNK
3453,"Worse customer service ever. The people in the office don't have the intelligence to schedule tradesmen, and then lie about giving you a call in advance when they're supposed to arrive, at which point they're already three hours late.",UNK
3454,Bland boring noodle place. I was hoping this would be like the chain Noodles & Company. Nope. The feel of the place is nice. The pesto pasta dish I received had no flavor to it. It was very bland for pesto.,UNK
3455,Great yogurt! Everyone was very nice. Great flavors & great names. We got a punch card and will fill it up fast!,UNK
3456,"The best pizza that I have found so far in Las Vegas!  The stromboli's are good, tha anti pasta is great, etc.  Love this small walk up with a few tables for sitting.  The best part though (as it should be) is the pizza!",UNK
3457,Pretty good fast Hawaiian! The chicken katsu is delicious. A little pricy in my opinion but still good,UNK
3458,"I have been here a bunch of times.\nEach time, I don't pay at all.\nI will only come back if I get dragged here again.\nRain is okay, but it is not one of my favorite clubs in Vegas.",UNK
3459,"Update: I emailed the manage to tell him about my experience, he never even bothered responding to my email. We will never be back.",UNK
3460,"Pretty tasty, but accepts no cards, and usually has a long wait. I can't say it stands above other pancake/breakfast places around the city but it's certainly not bad and very cheap!",UNK
3461,The staff was OK on our visit but really not all that helpful. When I picked up the glazed plate my son painted there were small holes in the glaze showing raw ceramic.\n\nWould we go again? Possibly but we won't be rushing back.,UNK
3462,"Got a hot chocolate n the lady gave me half of cup full! When I ask her why is she missing half of cup, she said \"" if I put more water then it won't taste good\"" what a bad customer service!!!",UNK
3463,"Fast, great value.... and a diverse different menu.",UNK
3464,There are plenty of better buffets elsewhere. Don't let the popularity and upscale feel of the hotel/casino trick you into thinking the buffet will also be good.,UNK
3465,"Nice steakhouse. Consistent meat quality wher you have their bone in ribeye in Vegas, NYC, DC, or Chicago.",UNK
3466,food was okay. prices were crazy high though.,UNK
3467,"Wonderful food in a very unusual setting.  The prices are very affordable and they can accommodate large groups.  The store carries an odd assortment of collectibles, antiques and used items, I had a lot of fun browsing after my meal.  The staff is very friendly.",UNK
3468,"This place is where to go for a great men's haircut in Pittsburgh.  The barbers are spot on with their skills.  I walked out looking five years younger, at least.  Loved it!",UNK
3469,"Hands down the BEST place to be in Scottsdale morning, noon and night! \n\nFlat bread pizza is to die for, the Mediterranean salad is delicious and the wine takes the cake!\n\nI love Olive & Ivy!",UNK
3470,"great food, great prices, friendly service.",UNK
3471,"Life saver! My wife and I need sun tan lotion, water, and some meds for the our headache. Got them all at a reasonable price. Get your things here instead of a the shops in the casinos. It's way cheaper.",UNK
3472,I got my hair extensions at rejoice your beautiful. Renee O'brien is the ABSOLUTE BEST IN AZ!!!!,UNK
3473,OMB best place for relaxing after work. Copper is the best beer I've ever had.,UNK
3474,Love the hummus plate. Fun for happy hour with the girls.,UNK
3475,Been here more times than I can count! Service really is not good but their happy hour prices and offerings make up for it. On sundays they have happy hour all day long in the bar area!,UNK
3476,Such a great vibe here!! Love the space. Good music. Warm people. Challenging classes. Mindful thoughts to take with you for later.,UNK
3477,"Poor job vacuuming, they didnt even remove the mats. Passable job on interior. I just hope they used the correct oil with the oil change. Overall not a very good job for the price. Won't be back. (two stars for the interior wipe down.)",UNK
3478,"Worst restaurant in town . Staff were rude, service was slow and food was average. Won't be going there again.....",UNK
3479,Tons of classes and equipment. Indoor and outdoor pool and hot tubs. Great food in the cafe. There are saunas and all kinds of other amenities in the locker room. Can get busy during peak times.,UNK
3480,"Like Ray's in NYC, if you are in a hurry you can grab a quick slice that gets reheated.  \nI like to order the whole pie.  The monster comes with a ton of toppings and is one mess of a pizza.  Love it.",UNK
3481,"Love how close this place is to my house, love the Californian dreamin chicken sandwich! This place has a friendly staff and is kept clean. I have been here a bunch of times and have never been disappointed!!",UNK
3482,"This place is awful! Barbecue and beer are great together this is definitely not the place for it. Horrible customer service,  I love Lynyrd Skynyrd's music and will continue to listen,however, as far as for food...I think not!",UNK
3483,Always friendly and knowledgable.  They dont try to pressure you and go above and beyond!  They will match anyones prices as well so why go to some place else and get so so service when you can go here and get it all.,UNK
3484,Yuck!  I don't ever think I've given this bad of a review!  Not good.  Hopefully this was just a  bad night for them.  Cold potatoes and undone chicken.  I just don't know what to say!  Ewe!  I would not do again.,UNK
3485,"I went here with a yelp deal.  The service was great, the food was very good.  I had a gyro and my mom had a vegetarian platter.  The portions were generous and very tasty.  I will be back when I am in town again.",UNK
3486,"Gorgeous view of the city, but it's overcrowded. The bartenders are rude, the drinks expensive...and there's nowhere to sit and enjoy ONE drink. Good thing I got in free because I was a guest of the hotel, but it is overrated",UNK
3487,This place has a lot of cool stuff. From military surplus to work wear. The only thing I would recommend this place is to offer frequent customers some discounts.\n\nThe downside: NO REFUNDS OR EXCHANGES,UNK
3488,"Service was a bit slow today and they ran out of the French vanilla creamer,  But my French Toast was right on.  The food is still worth the wait here.",UNK
3489,I expected MUCH more for the 4.5 stars.  Had asada flautas.  Below average at best.  Chips and salsa were average at best.  Sitting area is too small.  Would not return.,UNK
3490,"This hotel is one of the top on my list , not too expensive but is great, love their pool and since I always stay here when I'm in business trip is very convenient for me",UNK
3491,Seems that everything was priced extremely high on this visit.,UNK
3492,This Bruggers suffers from very poor customer service. The manager had a terrible attitude! I thought she might even quit her job when I asked for a cup for water. Who wants to start their day like this? Even the 16 year old kids at McDonald's are much nicer in the morning.,UNK
3493,"I don't come here often, but when I do, I remember just how great a hotel this place is! It's absolutely great to just walk around and admire the interior design and gamble a bit!",UNK
3494,"In my opinion, probably one of best in town for soul food.What makes Off Da Hook different from the competition is their chicken. Very well prepared and seasoning that you can actually taste. My next visit I will try the catfish",UNK
3495,"O is visually stunning, but it has no emotional impact. When's the last time you paid $190 to watch paint dry?",UNK
3496,the waitress service is suspect!!!  they sat us  in a corner and forgot about us!!  our waitress was horrible!!!!!!! and rude!!!!!    but the food is good!!!!!,UNK
3497,"Since my last review, I have been back probably 10 times and enjoyed it every time.  The breakfast is so delish and the smoothies are great as well.  Staff is super friendly and the atmosphere is bright and vibrant.  A good place to stop after a bike ride around Lake Monona",UNK
3498,Good food. Cute place. The potatoes were 'slightly' undercooked but still good. The grape jelly was delicious.  I want to try their Chicken Salad sandwich so I will for sure go back and try that.,UNK
3499,Great food prepared to order and generous servings. The burgers are among the best I've ever had. Highly recommended!,UNK
3500,"= = = = = =  SO SAD, SO SAD!  = = = = = =\n\nCafe Istanbul has discontinued their Weekday Lunch Buffet.     :-((",UNK
3501,"Stopped by today for lunch (Sunday 7-27-08).\nPho Loc is closed, appears the roof collapsed.\n\nLooks like they are gone.  :(",UNK
3502,"I saw one of there signs that said breakfast buffet for $7.99 it turned out to be $12.99 cause weekends it comes with champagne. I thought it was kind of misleading. The breakfast buffet was nothing to write home about, not very good",UNK
3503,"The staff was very friendly was clean location easy to find , the food was very good beef chowmein combination fried rice thai tea :) good and affordable",UNK
3504,"The topping selection is great, the staff is friendly, but twice now my yogurt has been icy. It's as if the machine is too cold.",UNK
3505,Made arrangements to meet a group of friends here yesterday only to find the place is closed. They need to update their website - it was frustrating to check it out online only to find it's apparently been closed for over a month :(,UNK
3506,I won't hurry back.  I did enjoy the amount of avocado they put on my veggie burger.  The sweet potato fries were okay.  The line was a bit long and the food a bit over priced.,UNK
3507,"An average, in the casino theatre.  Really nothing special to it but I can at least say that the floors weren't sticky and it didn't smell like moldy popcorn.",UNK
3508,"Overrated, its too far off the strip and when I was in there it seemed as if my money wasn't good enough.  Just didn't care for the attitude.",UNK
3509,Best burger on Mill,UNK
3510,"It is ok buffet. We had champagne buffet on christmas day. Not worth it, but some items were edible. Nothing to write home about. Would not eat there again, unless it is a freebie.",UNK
3511,: My personal favorite is the Guess Store...supah cheap and love their Guess Woman Watches..hotel rooms ? 5 stars..Condo style. I love it! :),UNK
3512,"1 of the most comfortable places to watch football.  it looks like they turned the keno area into a bigscreen viewing area.  deluxe chairs.  a hip, vintage casino with great service & strong cocktails.  cool old school crowd.  haven't tried a room or their food",UNK
3513,It's Costco!!!! That should be enough right there. Love going when I'm hungry cause I can mob up on a ton of free samples.,UNK
3514,"We did not want to have breakfast at the hotel and we decided to give this place a try. It is a great place . Service is very nice and friendly.we had Darlesia as our server , I give her 5 stars. I highly recommend The eggs & I.",UNK
3515,Its a margarita store inside a mall... not that cool.  Go and do something else in vegas.,UNK
3516,"Now that I had first hand experience with some of the management I will not be going back. And in case anybody wonders I went to the management, they didn't come to me.",UNK
3517,went there during christmas week. line for lunch was 2 1/2 hours long.  Nothing spectacular...everything was below average other than prime rib & king crab leg.  such a waste of $ & tummy.  definitely would not recommend to anyone.,UNK
3518,Marty was incredible to work with! He did a wonderful job with our pool fence- showed up on time and the fence is fabulous! We would recommend him to anyone!,UNK
3519,I had a very special project in mind for an engagement ring. Doug was able to design what I had in mind on a computer and conceptualize it with a 3D printer! Great quality with a very fair price! The perfect ring was made.,UNK
3520,"Consistently great service. Pretty standard food quality for a high end chain. Have really enjoyed this location both when busy and quiet.  Cocktails aren't particularly exciting or strong, but a great wine selection makes up for it.  Best way to describe the experience, 'consistent'.",UNK
3521,1 Star.,UNK
3522,I love their gyros! It was one of the best. $6.99 special and you'll get fries & a drink. It was delicious.,UNK
3523,Love my local bar!,UNK
3524,"This place is awesome. The \""what it is\""...so delicious. I'm from Cincinnati and we come here at least once any time we are in town.",UNK
3525,"I have to say, I was quite disappointed with the crepes.  We got the Queen City and Mascarpone and Berries. They were thick and more like burrito texture than actually crepes.  Don't think i will  be coming here again for crepes.",UNK
3526,One of the best Mediterranean restaurants in Madison. Nothing beats their kebabs!,UNK
3527,Average sandwich type food but AWESOME sweet tea.  Wish there were more of these in Florida by our home. Also sugar cookies are primo.,UNK
3528,"I love this resort and this bar is no exception!  Beautiful decor, great service and excellent drink selections!",UNK
3529,Very helpful.  Barista took the time to explain perks that will keep us coming back! Thanks Hillary!,UNK
3530,I have tried various bread and pastries from this location. The cranberry bagels and scones are huge and packed. Good stuff.,UNK
3531,"Delicious, flavorful and a perfect blend of spices. The Chicken Biriyani is really tasty!",UNK
3532,"My rating went down, because I love F&E ... But not when the lady I always see there is rude... Sorry F&E .. Dont make me drive over to 7th..",UNK
3533,Loving Hut is ok.   Great that they care.  Their heart is in the right place.  Food is average - frequently processed and over-salted.  Nice atmosphere.,UNK
3534,"Not a good place to eat at! The girl wrapping the burritos looked like she wanted to get out of there. Ingredients were not fresh, rice was burnt and the finished product didn't taste good at all. Avoid this place if you could.",UNK
3535,"Food was ok as long as you don't ask for butter on the side. You might just get ketchup butter. Service is pretty good our waiter Jeremiah was awesome even though it was busy, he still checked in on us. But over all i give them a 2.5",UNK
3536,"It's like the Scottsdale Gun Club without the expense of ammo! A great place to practice for the amateur or Olympic champion alike. There are lessons for kids and adults. Air conditioned and safe, I could spend my entire summer here. Love it. 5 stars all the way.",UNK
3537,Just finished a dinner of pierogies that our Pgh family brought to WV - always look forward to Pierogies Plus - try the apricot for a sweet treet!,UNK

3539,"In 2 words - Great place (for lunch)\nEat there 3 times a week, great service, good food, smiley faces all the time, definetly worth a review. Watch out from spice level 5 and up, they can make u go boom!! :-)",UNK
3540,"Have been to Joe's a number of times and enjoyed their food.  We have had terrible service every time, though.  It's worth going because the food is good and the atmosphere is fun.  Just be patient, and your night will be fine.",UNK
3541,Update. Im sick of coming here and having them tell me after a long wait in line that theyre out of whatever im looking for. Please. After a few times i get the picture.,UNK
3542,"We love the Little Gym.  Our little gymsters can crawl around and play on mats and beams.  The laugh, they smile, oh and they shed a tear here and there.  Balls, sticks, bubbles, songs -- lots of activities to entertain infants!",UNK
3543,"The happy hour tapas are the hidden gem here...sauteed scallops, sauteed mushrooms, etc. a great value and great food.",UNK
3544,Awesome never ending chips. Jamaica aka Sorrel drink is great. The Chimichanga is Amazing!,UNK
3545,We love this McDonalds. They are clean and fast and the food is always fresh. The help is polite and i love the sweet tea.,UNK
3546,Good place for something quick and healthy.  I'm a fan of the pasta salad--it's light and tasty!\n\nSo glad i live near both locations in central phx--so can do when i feel the urge:),UNK
3547,"Best Thai ever! Always looking for another Thai place to remind us of our favorite spot in Vegas and it's hard, no one will ever compare! This is said having been to Thailand!",UNK
3548,Over priced for just deli meat... alos took a long long long time to get food,UNK
3549,"Service was good, bacon was great, hash browns were awesome, but the pancakes that they stake their name on were all very dry. Not to mention OVER FIVE DOLLARS for a single glass of orange juice with no refills. Ridiculous.",UNK
3550,"Chips and salsa are always great, staff is friendly, coupons are always coming through my email, margaritas are delicious.",UNK
3551,"Good atmosphere, nice place to go and chat with friends or simply ignore the world and be on your laptop.  They have a variety of coffee and sandwiches. The Nutella coffee is a good option as long as you like your coffee in the sweet side!",UNK
3552,"The place is now Amor de Brazil, which is a much better place than Phil and Tony's ever was.",UNK
3553,This was the most disorganized mess   I will never go back.  Even when they gave us free tickets for the inconvenience that the performer loni love canceled.    I wonder why she canceled.,UNK
3554,This is a really good Bikram studio.  The first class was really hard and it gets a little less challenging but never easy.  I have been practicing for about two months and now just can not wait to go to the next class.,UNK
3555,"Not a fan, not even a little bit. Underwhelmed by the overall taste and the sauce on the slice, which I think is the most significant ingredient was bland. Not likely to give Ray a chance to make a second impression.",UNK
3556,"Definitely a mixed crowd as stated before.  Decent food, a nice place to watch the game that is on that day.  Not a place where I am a regular, but there seem to be the same faces every time I walk by...weird. 2 stars.",UNK
3557,"Stopped in here for a few drinks on a Friday night at about 11:30, it was pretty dead considering it was a weekend. Cover charge was outrageous. I don't think we'll be going back.",UNK
3558,"Went for dinner with a friend, def a fan.",UNK
3559,Dakota Chase is the cutest salon ever.  Everyone is always super friendly and Scotty is amazing.  Ask for him and tell them Amy sent you. :),UNK
3560,"This place cant even make what they have on the menu. Every time I come here for dinner the food is different and never what is stated in the menu. They are frequently out of items as well, but wont tell you till you order. This place is good for drinks only in my opinion!",UNK
3561,Not much to say.No one in the group enjoyed the meal...the cheese and sauces were off. Service was poor.,UNK
3562,They do not respect our flag!!! A business should have more respect for our country and address issues like this.,UNK
3563,"Cheap, good, quick, friendly.... \n\nTry the Smoked Chipotle Tobasco on the burrito!",UNK
3564,Great doughnuts as usual. It has been a few years since I have had one. It just reignited my love for them.,UNK
3565,"Sean is the man! Finally, I found someone who actually works on the motorized Razor scooters. After calling, then driving to 5 different locations I was ready to give up.  They fixed them quickly, super pleasant to work with and reasonably priced.",UNK
3566,Only open a couple of weeks but not a good experience. Waited over an hour to receive our food. Waitress was nice but had way too many tables. Food was just ok.\nI normally do not write reviews but felt like I should share.,UNK
3567,Two stars because the ambiance and service are good.  The food sucks.  It all sounds fantastic but just doesn't come through.  Had the bone in ribeye and a ton of appetizers.  The appetizers were okay and the steak was awful and I mean a w f u l,UNK
3568,"\""I drove all the way to the California border and paid $90 to get fingerprinted only to find out later my fingerprints were no good and needed to be redone. If you need them for California, go somewhere else.\""",UNK
3569,The food sucks and so does the service beware of the old Asian lady Linda she is the worst! Super attitude and can barely even speak! Avoid this place at all costs it's not worth your money or disappointment! Just say no,UNK
3570,"Most disgusting sushi ever.  As each dish came forward on the conveyor belt, it was like watching some bizarre game of chance.  Not really knowing if the next bite was going to make you sick(er)....",UNK
3571,I like this place b/c it's close to my house. It's a little more $ than some of the other joints in town. I wish they would run promos/coupons. Always good flavors with LOTS of toppings.,UNK
3572,Tausana is awesome! She did exactly what I wanted and desperately needed! She is super cool and very down to earth. Did awesome layers for my style (beachy)\n\nSalon is also very nice and trendy. Loved it!,UNK
3573,"Mexican food that is quick and to the point. Great for a quick lunch. Good food, but fast food atmosphere.",UNK
3574,"I dig the Vig. Good food and a great atmosphere/patio. If you like Bocce Ball, then you should definitely check it out, but go soon before it starts to warm up again and be sure to take the Vig Rig home if you're blasted.",UNK
3575,"I recommend this of restaurants to everyone, they make the food fresh for you. I love their sweet-and-sour pork and their fried rice. :)",UNK
3576,"Patty melt was delicious and portions were just right, not too large - not too small.",UNK
3577,The only thing this place has is free Wifi.  The food prices are horrible!  Baggage is slow.   Slot machines take up much seating. Kiosk salesman soliciting passengers.,UNK
3578,Never disappoints!,UNK
3579,"It's a little loud in there, but overall the happy hour was great. Very reasonable and good drinks.",UNK
3580,"No need for a long review for this place. Freshness of the fish used for sushi is questionable. And a fellow diner found a cockroach in their food, causing a quick exodus of clients. Never going back again.\n\nIf only zero stars was an option.",UNK
3581,This is a hidden gem of a restaurant. Very surprised at how good the food was. Quick service too.,UNK
3582,"Service was very good, but food was mediocre.  For the price, I expected much better.",UNK
3583,"So the place is beautiful, the sushi is nice and all, but... My husband's rolls arrives after 40-50 LONG MINUTES! And he went for the \""all you can eat\"" menu... What's that all about?!",UNK
3584,"Besides the great drinks, Saffron JAK pizza is now being served at Sidebar. The super greeky pizza is AMAZING!",UNK
3585,"Pathetic excuse for a \""restaurant \"". You can't just slap a famous name on it and serve mediocre food and service.",UNK
3586,Nice people but WAY too loud for a neighborhood bar.,UNK
3587,Need to work on customer service at the front desk.,UNK
3588,The worst customer service ever! I wouldn't do any business here. They are extremely rude! i decided to order flowers elsewhere!,UNK
3589,The sauces are good but the wings are the size of a childs thumb. not worth the price.,UNK
3590,Salsa was fantastic!  I had the chicken tacos....the chicken was very salty...they were okay.,UNK
3591,We can hardly avoid this place because of the kids. They know when we come to the drive thru sometimes twice on Saturdays. We get great service and the fries are always hot.,UNK
3592,Just ate there tonight. Everything was excellent. Veggies were fresh an believe them when they something is spicy. The staff were friendly and helpful.,UNK
3593,"Host was rude and we had a long wait to be seated.  Once seated we got the wham-bam-thank you service.  Food was good, nice portions.  Interior could use a face lift.  Overall Meh!",UNK
3594,Nothing overwhelming here - seems pretty generic. Food was passable but I have had better. Was more chinese than thai.,UNK
3595,"Georgia cuts my hair phenomenally, she fades it well and my hard part is real clean.  I love the scalp massage and the hot towel on my face.",UNK
3596,"Avoid at all costs. The service was horribly slow. The draft beer machine was down, they were completely out of craft beers and do you think they even comped us a crappy Bud Light? Nope! The manager was full of excuses though.",UNK
3597,I waited 2 hours and nobody showed up with my food! Absolutely ridiculous all I ordered was a burger and fries,UNK
3598,"The staff is friendly, fast and efficient.  The food is fresh and made to order.  They often run specials sent via text so join the CAPS104.",UNK
3599,Beautiful Campus,UNK
3600,It's not okay... Waited 30 minutes just for a glass of wine. The management had the poor servers completely overworked. Additionally the food was not very good... It was fish and fries night and nobody liked it in my group. This is a management problem.,UNK
3601,This is a really nice fry's. Their bakery is actually better than most of their other locations.,UNK
3602,The staff does not seem to have a real sense of empathy. I would not recommend them as a patient,UNK
3603,My God! This place keeps getting better and better!!! Even when they're so busy that the line is out the door around the corner!!!!,UNK
3604,I was impressed with Takumi. Their miso soup is delish. I had the veggie cucumber and avacado rolls. Will go back again,UNK
3605,"Pretty cool diner, cool enough for me to visit six times in my last five weeks in Pittsburgh. The trick? It opens at 7am, so get there at 6:55.",UNK

3609,"Sounds like Christine K,'s Review is very personal and not impartial. I have had work done a Wolberts and found nothing wrong with the  service.",UNK

3614,2 for 1 Jameson shots for $6!!,UNK
3615,"Meh, I had better services else where..",UNK
3616,"Had the chance to visit here with a Livingsocial deal. Food was average, generous portion sizes with a cozy like sportsbar atmosphere. Would come back for the all you can eat sushi for $20, however deal was no good on this offer.",UNK
3617,"2 1/2  stars very mediocre Mexican food no flavor, salsa is way too mild, never thought Mexican food could be this bland. \nThis place closes at midnight on weekdays and 2am on weekends.  Really bad neighborhood don't go there after dark!",UNK
3618,Food and service were good.  Prices are reasonable.  The decor/ambience doesn't help them at all.  Felt like I was sitting in a hotel lobby from the 80's.  Recommend that you sit outside and benefit from the hotel grounds.,UNK

3627,"Great coffee, phenomenal pancakes, and the rest of their menu is delicious...but the service is lacking.",UNK
3628,"Pricey for gelato - paid almost $6 bucks for a 2 scoop cone. Also, there was nothing special about it. It's definitely not a place I'd go out of my way to go to again. Just another shop that pushes cream :-/",UNK
3629,"Like anywhere in this city, it is a chore to drive there.  Parking was next to impossible and after that the place is CLOSED",UNK
3630,Overpriced! The clams was good but the mahi mahi and angel hair pasta were mediocre. I went here by accident cause I got it mix up with the oyster bar at Harrah.,UNK
3631,My cousin just had her wedding here. It was so much fun! Everyone had a good time. The environment is so natural and beautiful. I would recommend it for any event.,UNK

3634,"Good food, decent priced lunch menu.  Definitely recommend!",UNK
3635,"Far from the CA headquarters, this particular location tries but misses the mark of the usual standard.  Unattended bathrooms and a harried, albeit friendly staff don't quite give the same great in-n-out experience, but you can't blame them for trying.",UNK
3636,"A tasty and healthy option that delivers! \nIf you live/work on the square, you should be eating here once a week...or daily.",UNK
3637,All we did here was drink!  But they were good.,UNK

3639,"Like most on yelp I really wanted to like this place..food is super bland,staff super rude.what a waste of historical space.something good awesome and delicious needs to be here!",UNK
3640,Terrible service. Short tempers with two different guys working there. The vegan options are pretty limited and expensive. They charge a lot extra per topping. And a lot extra if you want the vegan cheese. Also no tap water only bottled. Pizza wasn't bad.,UNK
3641,Not a fan of the phone you have to pick up to order your food. Had to go wash my hands before the food came out. Dog was OK. Milkshake was average.,UNK
3642,Great atmosphere!,UNK
3643,"great place near town, good restaurant, great views, friendly people.",UNK
3644,"I would give 5 stars for their awesome food, but the service is SO slow !! I'm being generous with 2 stars. Great fantastic food but be prepared to wait a very very very long time :(",UNK
3645,Best Pizza in the world. Been around for ever. Been going there for over 25 years and still has a great tasting pizza. Price is not cheap but worth every penny.,UNK
3646,"Dino and the guys at scorpion have single handedly changed my opinion of off road shop. They are not only knowledgeable and friendly, but there is literally nothing they can't do. From bolt on to complete custom this is the place you should be coming. Ha coming",UNK
3647,I came for Sunday brunch.  Nothing stood out.  Food was for the most part over-cooked and not memorable.  Dessert section is ok.  Definitely not worth the price and there are so many better  buffets in Vegas.  Will not be coming back.,UNK

3651,I like this restaurant.  Since it is so small I am a little intimidated to bring my small children though.  The food is good and if you sign up for their online club you get coupons fairly frequently.,UNK
3652,"Clean. Clean. Love this place. You can pay for a visit you are not forced to buy a yearly membership. Love that. Great for babies and 5, 6, 7 year olds. Couches are comfortable. They have wifi. Bouncy house too!",UNK

3654,"Very impressed! I like the ambiance, the service, the food... Everything!",UNK
3655,"Only bad thing is very small seating area. Crusts are amazing, I had garlic herb. Large $5 can't beat it. I can tell their business is 90% delivery but I'd still stop by and pickup again!",UNK
3656,Really knows his stuff and is really reasonablly priced!  Without a doubt the best and most honest mechanic I've ever dealt with.,UNK
3657,"The food is ok, but I really don't see why people are so rabid about this place.  The items stress size and fat food instead of flavor.  If it weren't such a great value, I would have given it 2 stars.",UNK
3658,Service at the bar area is hit or miss. We had two bartenders waiting on us.  One made our drinks and delivered in record time.  We ordered a few apps and an entree. The apps all came but they completely forgot our entree.  After an hour of waiting we decided to leave.,UNK
3659,"Jimmy Johns is fast,fresh and good. They would be that much better if they sold hot sandwhiches.",UNK
3660,"A clean little thai place tucked in a strip mall. They have 5.95 lunch specials. The food was okay..nothing to rave about, but not bad either. The waitress was sweet, and the service was good. The thai iced tea was yummy.",UNK

3665,Nice portions and friendly service. Good experience but I enjoy other places in the valley for a good breakfast.,UNK
3666,"Men who ride motorcycles dont put gel in their hair. A biker bar doesnt have a Botix blonde barbi making out with a kid wearing designer jeans at the bar. You are gonna find your typical Scottsdale posers, so be prepared.",UNK
3667,I cant believe people think this is good sushi. The 8 piece chef special was sour and soggy. Very over priced and terrible. Save your money. I was ripped off.,UNK
3668,"Had breakfast here on 1/12/2013, they said they have been open less than 3 weeks.  I ordered an omelette and coffee, the food was really good!  Coffee was good too, and refills came promptly.  No problems with the service.",UNK
3669,"My fave place for breakfast! A varied, and delicious menu, I've been happy with all my meals here so far. The Cajun prime rib beni is -the best- and most satisfying meal here, just delicious. The staff is friendly and  accommodating!",UNK
3670,"This place is good if you're not on a diet. Otherwise, trying to order a custom omelette or breakfast gets VERY expensive.",UNK
3671,"It was just ok as far as food goes the service I give A+, I went during rest week and got a great price and good value, But as for going and paying full price.I would say I would not go back . You can find much better steakhouses in the valley for similar price",UNK
3672,Mike does such a great job ! I haven't found any one that does my nails like Mike !,UNK
3673,"Real hole in the wall restaurant. Great burgers and fries. Burger and salad bar to choose your own toppings, which all seemed fresh.\n\nBad part of town. Service is abrupt.",UNK
3674,Best kept secret in Las Vegas. 25 cents to play. take $10 and spend the entire day going back in time. Right next to the VERY cheap tropicana Cinema. Sodas & water 50 cents. More than a museum or arcade a truly life changing experience.,UNK
3675,a terrific new yoga studio downtown.  highly recommend it.  instructors are patient and engaging.  the classes are tailored to fit the levels of those who attend.  much nicer than attending a yoga class at a multi-purpose gym.,UNK
3676,"Service lent, cocktails pas \u00e0 leur meilleur. Ambiance de Casino.",UNK
3677,"If you love food that's floating with oil, then go A head be my guest.",UNK
3678,Very good and quick food.  Guacamole is fresh and you get\na choice of whole wheat or regular tortilla.  Nice service and very clean kitchen,UNK
3679,"One of the few Chinese places I will frequent. Not only is the food great but the service is great, food comes out quickly as well. Try the tangerine chicken you won't regret it.",UNK
3680,"Whole Paycheck prices, over $400 for a small cart of food is absurd!  Vitamin products are full retail prices in most cases, buy online and you can save 50%!  Wayne Gorsek",UNK

3682,"This place was highly recommended and it was as good as all the reviews.  We had appetizers, dinner, dessert, and drinks here and everything was well worth it.  I loved the sweet corn ravioli.",UNK
3683,"Drip coffee is pretty good, but of the several visits I have yet to get anything near a decent espresso drink. For example, the small americano has a single shot and then water. The extra large (Why is there an extra large?) has a single shot then water.",UNK
3684,"One of the best coffee shops in Scottsdale.  Fun events, great Chia (the best in town), great staff and the best to hang out with a laptop.",UNK
3685,I've been here a few times. Food is good (for buffet) sushi is usually fresh and tasty. A little slow on refills for drinks but friendly service. Decent selection to choose from. Pricing not bad considering  it's ALL u can eat.,UNK
3686,Best ever.,UNK
3687,Eek! Methinks not indeed. One of the worst branches that I have visited!,UNK
3688,I'm writing a review for the bar more so than the pizzeria. Love the bar namely for the bartenders. Great food and deals. Nice spot to make your usual hangout. Chill atmosphere.,UNK

3694,"Amazing gelato and awesome gelato!!!!! Best in las vegas!!! Really nice interior, super clean",UNK

3699,Great place for a quick cheap breakfast. We were in town from Jersey for a baseball game last weekend and as close to a Jersey diner I've seen in the Midwest. The waitresses were all business so be ready to order. Our whole party left full and pleasantly plump.,UNK
3700,Service sucked! $13 for a margarita you serious... I would rather buy a bottle of Cabo wabo and chill at home. Service was horrible!,UNK
3701,This place was awesome because it was affordable. Now they have changed owners and they charge for everything! $1.50 per item that you want to add to a burrito. Will go to Roberto's instead.,UNK

3703,"Great place in Old Town Scottsdale!  The food is great, the service is good and it is in a good location!",UNK

3706,Staff was very nice and my baby Pumpkin seemed to have enjoyed her stay. Next time I visit my family in Phoenix I will definitely use this facility again.,UNK
3707,One of the best meals I have ever had. We have wanted to try Olives for a long time and just never had made it here before on trips to Las Vegas. The pasta was handmade and melted in your mouth. The entire meal was perfection.,UNK
3708,"Had some calamari tempura and a couple sushi rolls. Nothing was bad, but nothing was particularly memorable either. All of the staff was extremely pleasant.",UNK
3709,"This place tastes like Steak & Shake. The only thing different that I can think of is the Haagen Dazs milk shakes, the presentation of the food, they also serve beer.",UNK
3710,"4 for coffee and brunch food. Great coffee and expresso. Food is brunch and very good. Try quiche, potatoes, tuna sandwich awesome. Say a 4 for basic brunch food and drinks.",UNK
3711,"Brunch today with hubby and best friends--good food, glad I don't have to fly to ABQ just to get adovada,",UNK
3712,Pretty good/consistent fare but a touch expensive for one notch above average food.  $16-$20 salads are a bit much. Steak Frites were good but not great.,UNK
3713,"Go there to grab a drink but skip the food, much better choices to feed yourself in the area.\nI you think of Madison's as a bar you'll be fine: friendly staff, good choices of beer on tap, plenty of TVs to watch local sports.",UNK
3714,Okay.,UNK
3715,"Great food great service...had the ribeye steak salad and hot wings, wasn't that hungry (got the junior salad which was more than enough)...they were both spicy and delish.",UNK

3719,"Love their boba and especially their diamond ice that fills with fruit such as strawberries, melons, and my very favorite red beans. Always order the medium ones cause you will crave for more if you order small. Guaranteed! :)",UNK
3720,"Great dnuts, the only issue is where it is located and its cash only but great dnuts",UNK
3721,First trip here food was very bland and the overall conditions were horrible. Tables were nasty fountain drink machine had not been cleaned in what looked like forever 1/2 or the drinks were empty. It would be a good place for a sandwich shop for sure is only positive thing I can truly say,UNK
3722,very very nice. not amazing but very very nice.,UNK
3723,"Great food, been eating here for 7 years, the atmosphere is very welcoming, the service is above excellent, must try.",UNK

3735,"I've been a Chase customer for nearly 20 years and have several accounts, both personal and business. Today for my business I tried to draw $1000 in ones and the branch was completely unaccommodating.  I expect money to be available to enable my business.  That was not the case today.",UNK

3739,"Lobster, Lobster, Lobster!!!!  The food was out of this world!",UNK
3740,If you are looking for a fancy state of the art restaurant this is not your place. It is a good burger with kind workers. Yes the burgers do get messy but that is part of what makes it so good. I will be back for sure.,UNK
3741,"Very popular place, even on weekdays (of well, it was spring break...) so come early and get crazy!",UNK

3743,Favorite Pho ever!  I love this place!  The iced tea is amazing!  The service was great too!  I highly recommend it!,UNK

3752,"I like this store, plenty of space to walk, lots of different produce, organic cosmetics and supplements. If I would have more money I would shop only there definitely.",UNK
3753,Tried to make an appointment on line twice.  They show available dates and times that are not available.  The office confirmed the appointment only to call back and ask for the appointment to be rescheduled at their convenience.  If you don't have the availability do not make it available on line.,UNK
3754,"Great Sushi. They don't offer all you can eat, so it can be pricey, but the fish is extremely fresh. Fun atmosphere.",UNK
3755,"1.00 movies(Tuesday Only) and 1.50 every other day? What could be better. It is cash only. You end up spending more money  on then the actual movie. The theaters are pretty small, but find a time to go during the week or earlier in the day.",UNK

3771,won't be going back... food was mediocre at best.  it is NOT kid-friendly.,UNK
3772,The last few times being in that store I've noticed that the manager Temple is very rude to his employees and he even had an elderly lady help with his put downs on a young man working there. So disappointing that an adult is willing to put down his employees!!,UNK

Huge language barrier in this restaurant; bring someone who can speak and understand Chinese for adequate service.",UNK
3785,What a lot of clutter!  Poor lighting!  I don't know how they manage to stay in business.  It had an old and moldy smell to it! \nI took a quick look around and left. What a trip to the gutter!\nddc,UNK

3800,"This place is so delicious. A bit pricey but totally worth a trip. The alcoholic milkshakes are delusion, can't even taste the booze.",UNK
3801,"After bouncing back and fourth between different cigar shops in town, I'm certain that this location is my favorite. They always seem to be better stocked than everyone else, and the staff is very helpful.",UNK

3803,"Food, atmosphere, and taste.\n\nTry it for yourself.",UNK
3804,I was totally let down by the Hilton. I stayed here for a business trade show week long. The morning buffet was horrible. One day it didn't open until 1130am another day it didn't open until 800am.,UNK
3805,Altered my dress in a day! It came out perfect and was reasonably priced. Very happy customer.,UNK
3806,"It is a good burger but its not worth the $$.  For 45 dollars for my wife and myself which included no drinks, 1 appetizer and 2 burgers its just too expensive for what you get.    Go to the oyster bar next door...now that place rocks it.",UNK

3810,My girlfriend got the taconuts and man where they awesome!,UNK

3812,"This is definitely my second home! Always a great shopping experience. \n\nThe layouts pretty much the same as any other, however they have a solid selection of produce here, so you can get all of your shopping done in one run.",UNK
3813,Below average food above average prices.  Order a pizza once but the cardboard box tasted better.  Cashier is friendly but that does not help other the food.  Burger patties are precooked.  Not sure if I would purchase one.  On Thursday they sell sub sandwiches they are not too bad.,UNK
3814,"I went in mid day on a Saturday and was helped immediately! Quick, exacting, and they really want you to be happy. Talking with you and getting your eyebrows just right, helped ease the tension. Highly recommend!",UNK
3815,"Really friendly/ good service from staff. Has a mini Indian food store. The restaurant side was clean, and trying out 2 dishes it's good. I've had better but I've also had many worse.",UNK
3816,"It was OK. I only got a boba tea and it didn't really impress me. The place looks a lot like a Subway sandwich shop, but has a lot more variety.",UNK
3817,"This place just became my favorite place in Vegas to eat. So delish, fresh and unique. Great cocktails and yummy food with cool decor and ambience.  I got the veggie pizza and the Mos-cito drink. Both very good! I will be back!",UNK

3821,This place rocks!  Great fish and great prices and the people working there make your experience fun.  Ask D for his secret monkey ball roll or ask for the off-menu garlic edamame!,UNK
3822,It looks cool friendly staff but over priced.,UNK
3823,Food was amazing and the staff was on point.  They recommended food that was exactly what we were looking for and it all came out in a timely manner.\nI will be back!,UNK

3830,"Swanky, gorgeous and expensive!! Bring your bank book even to buy clothes! Makes Bellagio look old and worn...which it is!",UNK
3831,Lame at best... No bark on the pork sandwich and cornbread smothered in a pound of butter. I would not go back and would advise others to look elsewhere. \n\nMuch better options are out there..,UNK
3832,The pizza was good but waaaayyy over priced....seriously? It costs like 6 bucks to make a whole pizza why does one slice cost that much?,UNK
3833,Cool place for kids 3-8 years old.. I have 6 and 8 yr old they had great time... Would not recommend for older kids nothing for them to ride.. There is about 8-10 rides,UNK
3834,I ate here for breakfast last week during a visit to Las Vegas. The breakfast was reasonably priced (for a location on the Strip) and the service was fast and attentive. I loved their pancakes and the location is convenient if you are inside of the Stratosphere.,UNK
3835,"nice place, great food and friendly  staff.  however  won't recommend  if you're  a non smoker.",UNK
3836,Great veggie food\nTried the veggie fish  and chicken sandwich \nBoth were good\n\nMango slush was not that great. But definitely worth the penny,UNK

3838,"If you're one person, they make a fuss about sitting at a booth, even if they're all empty. Sushi and sashimi are not bad.",UNK
3839,"This is the same format as the normal Kohl's, but the merchandise was set up a little messy especially in the accessories area.  =(",UNK
3840,I wish I could give this place a zero. I ordered a coffee (first mistake) at 11am and not only did it take forever to get my drink but it was room temperature at best. I know BK is not known for its coffee but I expect a little more than this,UNK
3841,Always good and always friendly service. Have even ordered dishes that weren't on the menu and they made it no problem and it came out great. No complaints at all. Definitely worth stopping by and trying for yourself.,UNK
3842,"Best Italian joint in the city!  The pici with duck is so insanely delicious... I swear, I dream about it.  The caramel dessert is super outstanding.  Great service too!  If you're feeling adventurous, try the pizza with the duck egg.  YUM x10!",UNK

3844,"Another fun place in downtown Mesa! Great food, great atmosphere. Love it!!",UNK
3845,"Solid beer, love the selection.  Wish they had some better food, but its a brewery.  They just offer popcorn and beer, go here on a full stomach.  The beer is strong and delicious!  mmm mmm 4 star good.  glug glug beer!",UNK
3846,Galleria mall is the last decent locals mall.,UNK
3847,These guys don't support UofA teams so I wont support them in Tucson.,UNK
3848,My new favorite spot for British pubs. The food is decent. Drink is affordable compared to other prices on the strip yet close to the strip. Check out their Tuesday specials. I had a fun time with friends here.,UNK
3849,Horrible service. The bar was practically empty and they acted like they were going out of their way to pour you a drink after the bartender finished his snow boarding story to the other bartender. Forget about the tattooed wattress serving you.,UNK
3850,"Delicious, unique, and you will be so glad you tried it! Best. Sandwich. Ever. Plus, amazing service!!!!! Thank you Zooks!!!!!",UNK
3851,Overpriced for the food they serve. Service was bad.,UNK
3852,"Competent, but expensive (and inconsistent) sushi. A place to go if you have RFB, but I wouldn't spend money here. You're paying for the waterfall view, but only a fraction of the tables have that.",UNK

3854,Very old and strange place. Normally I would call the government to shut it down. But the pizza was surprisingly good. I have no idea how this place stays open. But don't eat there... Seriously. Have it delivered. Ignorance is bliss.,UNK
3855,"Baker is my first go-to place when I'm looking to add to my gardens. Tons of natives, cacti, herbs and etc fill their property & I can always find what I need. They also have experts and some special shows on occasion which are very interesting to see.",UNK
3856,its walmart...nothing else to say,UNK

3858,"Overrated terrible food horrible service. If this is supposedly the best Wisconsin has to offer, get me out if here. They need to hire a chef and then hire all new staff. There has to be at least one decent place to eat on this city.",UNK

3860,I have always enjoyed Milo's. Superb fish. Exquisite starters. And I adore the Milo's Special. Service is also spectacular.,UNK
3861,Love love love the lobster salad. However the service is so slow and horrible that I will only get takeout. Too bad because it's a great location and you would expect amazing service in a more upscale area.,UNK
3862,"This is an \""okay\"" buffet. Not as low quality as Circus Circus and Imperial Palace but not nearly as good as Rio. I would say eat here for breakfast but skip dinner.",UNK

3865,"The staff here is very nice and helpful. When I was having a hard time to find a good size for Winter boots, they patiently brought a lot of pairs for me to try on. When one didn't fit me, they gave some valuable suggestion. It's pricey but worth spending.",UNK
3866,"I wish they had a fridge in the standard room. And I'm lazy to walk the strip and through their long casino before getting to the hotel part. Other than that, everything was just like any standard Vegas hotel room.",UNK
3867,Great location!  I love that you can substitute burger with a veggi patti and that they have gluten free bread.  Love love love the smiley cookies :),UNK
3868,"best BBQ in the valley. tritip is on point. ask for \""Ryan\"" and he'll add dakine special sauce. when you eat it you be like \""BONGO!\""",UNK
3869,I grew up in Madison and Sai-Bai Thong was the only Thai restaurant I'd ever been to until college.  Because of that I thought I hated Thai food.  \n\nIt wasn't Thai food's fault.  It was Sai-Bai Thong's fault.,UNK
3870,"Their version of a Cappuccino is a latte with some airy foam on top. Low selection of pastries.\nOK ambiance, but usually busy and difficult to find a place to sit.\nWi-Fi available, but slow and unreliable...",UNK
3871,"total dive bar.... paper plates, over-cooked food, yucky.....",UNK
3872,"An interesting aspect of the buffet is that many of the sides come in their own small dish or pot and that makes sharing a taste easier. We had a large group and tried many of the sides. I enjoyed much of the food, but would not rate this as a top buffet.",UNK
3873,"Used a Groupon to try this gem out, the wife and I were very satified and left happy.  Try the fried avacado with crab meat.",UNK
3874,"Always enjoy ourselves here. Unprententious with great paninis, cheese and meat plates. North Peoria gem. Watch calendar for tasting events.",UNK

3878,I don't care about your views on the second amendment.  You owe it to yourself to go to the gunstore and try it out!  Incredibly helpful and friendly staff will walk you through all the steps.  See how you feel after firing off a few dozen rounds with them!,UNK
3879,"It's a dollar store, what do you expect?  Everything you ever need in your everyday life is no more than $1.  Other than that, they do have fast check-out service.  They however only accept visa and mastercard.",UNK
3880,Health nut is perfect to start the day,UNK
3881,Sweetbreads! Grilled two different ways. Fantastic. I felt like I was back in BA sitting at the port area..\nWell worth the taxi ride.,UNK

3883,"My third time, not a good meal on my last time. The food took forever and the place was not busy. Worst of all my sliced steak had a fishy flavor . Yuck",UNK
3884,Butter Burger and the milkshakes \nTheir in house root beer is pretty good too,UNK
3885,Not worth the money. Baked oysters were decent but the fish and chicken were below average,UNK

3890,Worst service ever! Didn't have many domestic beers an the they where not draft. We had to ask our waiter for everything.,UNK
3891,"Ive enjoyed multiple items here and the service is always great and friendly. I recommend ordering Adobado Nachos with no beans. Reading other reviews about it being over priced, I feel they are not ordering the correct items to get the most out of a meal.",UNK
3892,"As a New Yorker, I have really high pizza standards. And this place is fantastic!",UNK

3894,"I love Fresh and Easy. This store is a little different from most.  They installed faux wood floors, and put doors an all freezers and refrigerators.\n\nF&E has excellent pricing, and quality. I just wish there were more of them.",UNK
3895,A nice & pretty clean theater! Nothing special like the Luxury Theaters -- but can't go wrong with their $5 Mondays special! Seats were still comfortable and it didn't feel so crowded! Great way to end a dinner night!,UNK
3896,I love all the outlets they have at this location. The food is always fast but finding parking is virtually impossible.,UNK
3897,"Best Sandwiches- actually, in general best vegan dinner spot in town. I never have to worry if there's meat or dairy in my food :) and raw food nights are amazing!",UNK
3898,"A restaurant in the old town of Casa Grande cannot justify $30 meals, especially when the food is only average.",UNK
3899,Breakfast sandwich is pretty good and friendly service but not very efficient. And what's with the styrofoam containers? Very environmentally irresponsible. No one else uses those anymore. Get with it!,UNK

3904,"Great pizza, atmosphere, and beer",UNK
3905,"Stopped in today on a Wednesday. Nice atmosphere, but if you're not local, it's hard to get the bartender's attention. If you don't want the traffic from the hotel, don't locate next to the hotel...",UNK
3906,Great place. Great breakfast. My advice get there early and with appetite.,UNK
3907,Great price for an alignment.  Easy and quick service was provided.  I like that they did not try to add on any sales garbage and try to pressure unnecessary repairs.,UNK
3908,I just wish it was not so expensive\nthen I would go more often,UNK
3909,"I am a cookie monster, and this place is awesome.  It's just a matter of getting past the cupcakes which isn't easy.  Everyday they have good sales on several items.",UNK
3910,"Movie theatre is the typical Harkins experience.  Fairly new movie theatre, $1.00 drink cups, etc.  The reason behind the just 3 star rating?  Parking SUCKS.  Not enough spots, drove around for at least 10 minutes looking for a spot.",UNK

3917,Cute place. Service sucked. Short rib tacos and tatter tots were amazing. Don't eat the fish tacos they taste like dirt.,UNK
3918,"Great food, excellent selection of wines. The staff make you feel welcome and are eager to please. Always ask about the specials, and their wine dinners are always great.",UNK
3919,Best veggie burger around. The staff was very sociable and welcoming. The guy on the grill was awesome - got all of the temps dead on. I only give it four because  seating is tight and they do not take reservations.,UNK

3925,"Hands down, best yogurt in all of lv and I assure you, I've been to all of them. The pumpkin pie flavor is BOMB!!!",UNK
3926,We were expecting to find foie gras poutine on the menu but it wasn't. The ambiance was very dirty and cheap feeling and the fries were of poor quality. It was very filling and good food if you are drunk but I will probably not go back there.,UNK
3927,I had a wonderful meal here on Sunday.  The service was great and the menu interesting.  I definitely recommend this restaurant.,UNK

3931,I love their ramen! the best in town!! i really wish they serve ramen for dinner also :(,UNK
3932,"Food was reasonably priced for Strip food. The gimmick is OK. Server was good but seemed like the kitchen was on break. Waited 40mins for 2 entrees. Otherwise, not bad.",UNK

3938,Pizza is too expensive and doesn't taste like anything special. A tiny piece of tiramisu was close to $7 and doesn't even taste that good. The tiramsu at Carrabba's is cheaper. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.,UNK

3948,Excellent food!! Colby meatball amazing. Definitely ho to this restaurant when in Vegas,UNK

3953,Best BBQ in the Southeast. The Sides are as good as the BBQ.\n\nI am from Texas and I know good BBQ. You guys are the best in North Carolina.,UNK

3960,"A little overrated and way out of the way (unless you have a car or a monorail pass). This is what Reno looks and feels like. A little more sketchy than the strip, but supposedly these casinos pay out 10% more than the other larger casinos.",UNK
3961,"I am IN LOVE with these tacos. I've tried every kind they make, even the lengua, and the food is seriously outstanding. A must-try if you're down on Fremont near Container Park.",UNK

3986,Delicious food. Great place for weekend fun. Awesome Bloody Mary bar on the weekends. Great patio when it's warm outside. I go here a lot and highly recommend it.,UNK
3987,"Overrated, just like your Sun Devils.  A large stadium full of bandwagon fans.",UNK
3988,It's been over a year since i have been here. Everything was decent the food was fresh. \nThe employees were very friendly and it was kept clean inside. Will most likely be back in soon.,UNK
3989,I got my nails done here and I'm a guy and it was great!,UNK
3990,This is the closest convenience store near my house and I really like the staff here. They open up new registers as soon as they see the lines getting long and they're really helpful and friendly.,UNK
3991,"All about meat\nThe bread was the highlight of the meal, it was delicious. I agree with another poster that the bread and a salad or app might be the best options \nbreautiful retaurant and friendly staff but incredibly unheathful food.",UNK
3992,Very disappointing. So many better buffets than this. Even their California roll sucked.,UNK
3993,"Great Filipino food,all you can eat Adobo...Chicken,Beef,Pork got ur Pancit behon,Pancit palabok,and soups",UNK

3996,"Thorps is cool, I like the atmosphere of the place.  \n\nThanks for the haircut, Tara!! Love it!!",UNK
3997,Tix 4 tonight is a great value for show tickets. They have several locations on the strip and downtown.,UNK
3998,Never had a bad experience here so I give it 5 stars. Everything is delicious and quick to get to the table. On Tuesdays they do 99 cent margaritas. One of the better Mexican food joints. I prefer this location to the Indian School one.,UNK
3999,Always make sure to have them repeat your order in the drive thru. They always mess up my order and I end up having to drive back to get it replaced. How do they stay in business like this?,UNK
4000,If I could give vapor vortex a negative star I would. The employees were constantly talking about drugs right out in the open making a very uncomfortable environment. I wanted to purchase some juice and instantly had other products shoved In my face. In my opinion it was not even a satisfactory experience.,UNK
4001,"Love the pizza, reverse happy hour special , especially the wings and pretzels. Beer is obviously the best part",UNK
4002,"Terrible assistant manager, failed to bring included item with meals and he was rude beyond belief!",UNK
4003,"Yuck. The food was terrible. The fries were cold, then microwaved. The waitress was nice enough but not very attentive. The atmosphere isn't very comfortable. I don't see a reason to go back.",UNK
4004,never again,UNK
4005,This place is next to my work so it's convenient. The staff is friendly and always willing to help. Definitely recommend this place,UNK
4006,Dinner buffet. Not 100% perfect but many things stood out and you could find a few things that were spot on. The Chinese duck was to die for. The Gelato.. Yum. For 24.00 it was a bargain.,UNK
4007,"Very enjoyable experience. Drink before coming to the theater, drinks are $16 each!",UNK
4008,"This place is the best! Best people, best food and now they serve drinks! Awesome! The only real Colombian food in the valley",UNK
4009,Was extremely disappointed here.  Just never connected with the staff and som.  Food was OK.  Overpriced and over-hyped.  Best part of the evening was hanging in the bar before dinner.,UNK
4010,This place is pretty good! they serve a selection of creatively topped dogs and some of the best greasy fries I have had in awhile. enough said!  Time to go drink some beer and devour this dog!,UNK
4011,"The service was great until the new waitress took over, she had no patience and rushed us (my delicious glass of sangria was half full when she took it away). The food was great. I got salmon salad. And they offer hookah on the third floor, with beautiful view!",UNK
4012,"My friend took us here. It was my first time. The \""snow cream\"" in a cup was good. Was expecting more. But I guess I prefer fro-yo better (frozen yogurt w/ fruit or toppings).",UNK
4013,"4.1/5 stars - Often rated the best pizza in Phoenix, there are better.",UNK
4014,My favorite chocolates. I think I started with the Earl Grey a few years ago and I've never looked back. We go to lunch nearby and then stop off here for dessert.,UNK
4015,"My favorite place for breakfast just about anywhere. Get an omelet (you can't go wrong with any of them), pumpkin bread, and potatoes. I moved away 2 years ago and I STILL crave Omelet House.",UNK
4016,"its a dive alright.  very loud with the kitchen all yelling orders at once. I had the bibimbop, which was ok and they do use ground beef.  in a pinch its fine for when you crave korean.",UNK
4017,"We stopped at Kona for lunch on our way from Carefree to Scottsdale.  Weird menu, everything from sushi to flatbread pizza.  We were underwhelmed by the food but service was friendly and attentive.  Would not recommend if you're into good food.",UNK
4018,I'm from Atlanta visiting at a convention downtown and tried this place as a recommendation. The food was outstanding and the service was excellent.  Worth the short drive to sit outside in the pleasant weather this time of year.  Would definitely recommend.,UNK
4019,"Not a good restaurant!\nNice atmosphere. The food is over priced, not very good, and it's not even served on a plate. Really?\nI was disappointed enough in it that I decided to post a review!",UNK
4020,"The tinga chicken torta left little to be desired. No flavor and barely any chicken on the torta. Bummer. However, the queso was fantastic!",UNK
4021,I have to report that I just walked out of this restaurant after waiting a good 5 plus minutes for a server to show up. I was especially convinced when I looked over at the other table's greasy looking pizza. Eek! Methinks not.,UNK
4022,Used to be a very good pub indeed but has gone down hill over the last couple of years since a change of ownership. The downstairs area has now it seems been made merely functional rather than cosy as previously so I'll not be making another visit for some time.,UNK
4023,Thanks for the heads up! Thanks to the reviews I will not be going here to get my nails done.,UNK
4024,"Just a quick note:  Cosplay waitress are no longer there.  \""We don't do that anymore.\"" said the staff when I inquired on 2/17/2014.  Makes it -1 star since the Chinese food was just OK+",UNK
4025,"If you got kids this is the place to go. Parking lot is very tight and it gets packed like crazy. It's best to go early in the morning rather then the middle of the day. Games are fun, everyone enjoys it, and that's what really matters.",UNK
4026,= = = = = =  CLOSED  = = = = = =\n\nSorry to see Him's JL close.  I liked the place.     :-(,UNK
4027,loved to ambience. great food. average drinks.,UNK
4028,the food is just ok.. and the price is pretty high!! so not as reasonable.. \nI rather go further to Cambridge or Waterloo to hv some nicer japanese food!,UNK
4029,Went to BJ s for lunch with fairly large work group.   They were on time with all the food despite over a dozen of us.   Food was better them I expected although typical pizza and pub stuff.  They got us on and out quickly and service was prompt at all times,UNK
4030,"Went in on a Groupon, food was good but also greasy, but not enuff for me to go out of my way to eat there. \nWent there at lunch, it was dead, but yet took forever to get our food.",UNK
4031,While our server was great the food was mediocre and the atmosphere poor. Place was a little grungy. Won't be going back,UNK
4032,"cute enough staff, decent enough food",UNK
4033,Cultureless chain restaurant with bland food. Employees are more interested in flirting with each other at the host stand than to acknowledge you when you walk in or walk out.,UNK
4034,"Not bad, beef and brocorri is very good.that's all I got there. Place was empty for the most part. Nothing to boast nothing to complain. It's your average asian food joint. And the best part is, they are with in walking distance.",UNK
4035,"I have two girls, ages 3 and 1.  This place was absolutely perfect for them!  It's huge inside with tons of things for them to touch, climb on, and play with.  I'm looking forward to taking them again during the summer when it's too hot to be outside!",UNK
4036,"I had their gelato and thought it was good but nothing spectacular about it. I had better one before. Maybe I need to try out their pastry and sandwich the next time I am back. Overall, I will give this place another try.",UNK
4037,"Fantastic guacamole and ceviche. Unassuming location.  Pl turn down the loud tv station, tho...",UNK
4038,Beat body shop in town joe is the best!!\nHe does a great job on matching exotic paint,UNK

4040,"Absolutely love this hotel!! Awesome staff, decor, pool, sky deck!! We will definitely stay there again!",UNK
4041,"overpriced for the quality.  You can definitely get worse.  $15 for breakfast, I expect fresh donuts and bagels.  If it is convenient for you, go ahead.",UNK
4042,Very tasty and filling. before leaving vegas thast weekend I just needed one more for the road sadly they were closed on sunday.  but will definitley be back on my next vegas trip.,UNK
4043,Good place to get a quick meal. I went there for breakfast ordered a sausage eggs cheese sandwich and food came out fast and fresh ! The restaurant is clean and nice tables. Free refill coffee and it just like Starbucks but offers table service . Very impressed !,UNK
4044,I tried all the dishes yelp said to order and couldn't finish anything. Everything was too salty to consume.  \nI gave them two stars because the dessert on the other hand was great. I make back once just to have dessert but probably would never come back again.,UNK
4045,"Chef Rusconi has done a great job with his restaurant.  The decor is nice, service was attentive and the food was fantastic!",UNK
4046,"Bartenders are awful here. How are you working as a bartender downtown and NOT be able to make a mojito?? Also, the attitude behind the bar was very unpleasant and unprofessional. Spend your money else where!",UNK

4050,"Excellent skewers at reasonable price. Ordered 15 piece combo and a few sided orders, enough to feed 2 adults and one child.",UNK
4051,BEST TRAM EVER! esp during the summer.\n\nperfect for lazy people who are hungover and not in the mood to walk (esp during the 100+ degree summers),UNK
4052,"Should have walked out like the people next to us. Drinks $$$....drunk lady in 2nd row kept heckling, talking loud, flipping everyone off. They should have escorted her out. Comedians not funny :(",UNK
4053,"Best bar, jukebox, people and the best place for Vegas souvenirs.  A no brainer place to go if you visit Vegas...if you like the strip casinos...stay there!",UNK
4054,Absolutely delicious ramen. The hakata and the chashu are my favorites. It can get busy but don't let a wait discourage you. Completely worth it.,UNK
4055,"Best milkshakes in CU! They also have delicious lunches and dinners at affordable prices. However, besides the milkshakes, the Courier is best for breakfast, might I recommend the outmeal with fruit.",UNK
4056,"Sadly, seems to be out of business as of 2/27/2013. Food was very good.",UNK
4057,JC does amazing work. I have gone to other stylists before and their work just pales in comparison. I have never walked away dissatisfied. She is a very kind and genuine person as well and that is important to me.,UNK
4058,"nice people , good food , one of my favorites to watch a game and play video poker",UNK
4059,"I had congee and it was a bit mediocre to me. I would come back just to get a quick meal, but not really spend much time because the service was ehh too.",UNK
4060,"Very over-priced and the owner is a bit of a dick. Overall, definitely not worth it. The spaetzel is pretty good though.",UNK
4061,Absolutely amazing! A must see.,UNK
4062,This is a wonderful find. The local couple are so nice and the prices reasonable. I highly recommend this place.,UNK
4063,Awful.   Zero stars.  1 hour wait for a reservation and all staff were rude or indifferent.,UNK
4064,Use open table to get a table!,UNK
4065,Hands down the best house infused cucumber vodka...ever! Loved the food and sitting on the water view deck. The only complaint was slow service...she forgot our oysters that we ordered and food was really slow.,UNK
4066,"Hanging out with my family for a brunch,\nIt is a great place to spend time together, I enjoyed my breakfast burrito! Also they enjoyed their Baby Chick Skillet, the Mexican Skillet & the Strawberry Pancake. Price is okay!",UNK
4067,I like the downtown it was different then the yuppies!! The drinks where strong and people where friendly and the clubs where good,UNK
4068,Everything about our dining experience was absolutely superb!  Outstanding service and some of the most delicious steak ever.  The salad bar is incredible too!  I highly recommend it.,UNK
4069,"Went there Sunday night to check out the BRAND NEW club! Staff was super nice, very clean and a classy joint. My straight friends felt very welcome and comfortable! Wish them much success!!!",UNK
4070,Great electrician . Will use them again in a heart beat,UNK
4071,Best thai food restaurant I ever went!\nEVERYTHING is so good!,UNK
4072,"Great for burgers,  dogs and ice cream.  Reminds of a mom and pop place from my home town that was only open in summer.",UNK
4073,"The food is on par with any decent casino buffet, but having to pay full $19.99 price for a 5 year old is a bit ridiculous IMO, so definitely skip it if you have kids...",UNK
4074,"great show. well paced, lots of variation of music.",UNK
4075,I'd give it 3.5 stars if I could. From the other reviews I was expecting a more dramatic space. Just had a few glasses of wine though and a cheese plate. No dinner.,UNK
4076,"The most disgusting shepherds pie on the planet! Service sucked, prices were ridiculous drinks were watered-down. Who's  running this place? Will never be returning!",UNK
4077,"I got the Tai Pho and it was very good and came in good proportion. Not the best pho I have ever had but, it does pass for a good dinner meal. The restaurant is very nice outside and inside. Our waitress was very lovely. There was much to complain.",UNK
4078,"Ghetto subway and they dont even honor \"" sub of the month\""will never return.Both employees were rude.",UNK
4079,...I need a washer and dryer.  Badly.  This place just confirmed something I already knew.,UNK
4080,Wow.  Came in the restaurant at 8:45 pm on a Saturday night to be told we would not be served because they close at 9 pm.  \nI'm never coming back!,UNK
4081,"Really nice property with spacious and clean rooms, amazing outdoor space with 2 inviting pools! And when you factor in $50 bucks/night on Priceline, it's murder I tell ya!",UNK
4082,"Good concept, after some practice they might have a good thing going here. As with most new restaurants they had some pretty serious service issues, but we managed through and enjoyed our meal overall. I'll be back in a few months.",UNK
4083,What a wonderful little greasy spoon diner. Breakfast special was AWESOME and totally worth the reasonable price. Nice little local place with good food and a basic atmosphere.,UNK
4084,"Good friendly workers @ this place. Didn't get to try their yogurt, ordered oatmeal. They even filled up a bowl of water for my friends dog! :) thanks guys!",UNK
4085,Never once have I left this establishment without a smile on my face and my VW running tip top! To add to the experience the staff has personality and it does not cost extra!! Thank you for your endless VW and Audi expertise.,UNK
4086,Had the brisket and the bbq beef sandwich + sides.  Everything was no good.  The meat was dry the sides were bland.  If you're looking for good BBQ in the Phoenix area I recommend Honey Bears or Bobby Q's.,UNK
4087,Most times the food has been okay. But last night the baked potato was so over cooked. It was brownish color inside and extremely dry.,UNK
4088,No Thanks! We will never go back. TAPA's terrible and over priced. The only reason it's a two stars because our waiter was decent and the guacamole and the drinks were okay.  I approve this message JK KUHL..,UNK
4089,"Reminds me of a place back in Chicago me and my wife would eat at. Looking forward to the happy hour there, as the deals looked pretty good, and the food was excellent. Really liked it.",UNK
4090,Loved it! Best French toast ever!,UNK
4091,Awesome view and great tasting drinks but a steep price to pay for them. For a lounge the DJ had the music playing as loud as a night club so forget about trying to have a converstaion with anyone while you are there.,UNK
4092,"The buffet used to be really good. I used to love this buffet. I mean, its ok.",UNK
4093,Good food and OK service--but cash only.,UNK
4094,Cult vibes + delicious lemongrass mock chicken. I try to avoid meat substitutes in general these days but Veggie House holds a special place in my heart.,UNK
4095,"Slooooow service. Food was cold when I got it. Staff is friendly enough, they just need more staff on for the Friday rush.",UNK
4096,The Doctor is Great!,UNK
4097,"Sam, Sven, and all the vendors here make the market special.",UNK
4098,LONG WAIT!  never again will we use this rental car company.,UNK
4099,"The first time I went there for an oil change, they stripped one of the parts and I didn't know till I went somewhere else for my next oil change. The manager made it right no questions asked and even paid for my oil change! I will definitely be going back!",UNK
4100,"Wanted a restaurant within walking distance of our hotel so picked this one.  Was ok:  Nothing major to complain about, but also really nothing to rave about either.  There are better restaurants to choose from.",UNK
4101,Yardhouse is one of the best Happy Hour's in Vegas.... Right before the Welcome sign in the heart of town square shopping mall this place is a gem. Best beer selection in town and great prices on everything.,UNK
4102,"Great!! My favorite food, this one and the one by my work are both really yummy. Chicken flat bread pizza is by far my favorite. Good food and beer can't complain.",UNK
4103,Now I remember why I stopped coming here they charged me $30 more than where I normally go to the same services and service is not that great,UNK
4104,"Nice place, but I was not impressed with the food. I can get more authentic Mexican food at a filibertos. The one shining star was their salsa's, and the service was ok. Not some place I would return to. :(",UNK
4105,Thoughtfully prepared food. Very attentive service from manager and chef.,UNK
4106,"I've been here several times.  I've always had good service and food.   I also asked if something could be made with shrimp instead of chicken and they said they would do whatever I wanted.  Met the owner when it first opened, nice guy.  Will continue going back at this time.",UNK
4107,Great Gyros.  Fast & Friendly service.  Mini-mart & desserts attached to cafe.,UNK
4108,Got a bowl to-go and it was great. I wish I would have got some sauce. I will be back to try more for sure. Keep up the good quality and nice pieces of chicken.,UNK
4109,"Place is great!!!   Love the decor.  Food well rounded and to the point.  Service was \""right on.\""  Won't go back cause I don't like being that far from the strip, I can never find my way home. LOL!!",UNK
4110,"Great atmosphere, good service, but just average food!",UNK
4111,"Love, Love, Love Fleming's happy hour!\n\nIt is a nice atmosphere with smokin' deals on decent wine and drinks and great appetizers. There is also a very tasty burger on the happy hour menu.  The service is usually excellent.",UNK
4112,"Love the pizza, pasta and yummy desserts!  Service is always fantastic!! Great lunch specials make this an easy pick over a drive through and a number 3!!",UNK
4113,"Cute little cafe! Very whimsical decor. Server was friendly and attentive, food was good and coffee was great. Would love to try more items from their menu.",UNK
4114,"Very nice people, nice place inside, but not Thai food that's worth coming back for, very bland and the Thai coffee isn't right, maybe the owners would benefit from checking out Archie's or the noodle house..",UNK
4115,"Best Thai food for your dollar in the entire valley. I'm no Thai expert, but I have been to at least a dozen here in the valley. Keep in mind - this is NOT a fancy place - just a simple, inexpensive, casual dining experience. WOW!",UNK
4116,They charge for chips and salsa.  Cockroach came out from under our table so we left.,UNK
4117,"Lunch today, crispy gnocchi & Cheeseburger with fries.  Both solid dishes however the sauce with the gnocchi was a little flat.  The menu however was loaded and demands that we return soon.",UNK
4118,"Sucked, ordered a BBQ Chicken Sicilian pizza and they gave me a regular. There was no BBQ sauce in it. The seafood calzone had more bread and grease then actual meat. And the service was shit. No more from me.",UNK
4119,Had to find a place to accommodate a  large party of thirty people. DeVon was our server and gave us excellent service. The pizza excellent and the salads were great. I would recommend coming here any time!,UNK
4120,"This place is terrible.  The help is rude.  I have been here three times and walked out the last time after the bartender stood around and talked to his buddies instead of serving my date and I.  I know it is new, maybe it will get better.",UNK
4121,Good happy hour menu and great specialty drinks. Very fresh food and good service. been here twice and will go back when I am in the area.,UNK
4122,80 mins deep tissue massage costs 205 dollars plus tip. However the massage therapist did not perform a deep tissue massage at all. I am always bad at face to face confrontation so I was not able to tell them this was probably one of the worst deep tissue massages I ever received.,UNK
4123,I would avoid this hotel. The live to get their hands in your credit card. They will post random charges constantly without permission. I am also a Wyndom client and am totally blown away they can't do something to the management here for their fraudulent activities.,UNK
4124,Middle of the road chinese food. I've had most of the chicken dishes and Thai soup. Satisfied with both but doesn't blow me away. They are quick and the portions are big for the price. I'd take this any day over the fast food Chinese place.,UNK
4125,"Simple but good chinese food. Recommend sezchuan or hunan chicken dishes. However, very busy at peak meal times so plan wisely.",UNK
4126,My second favorite pizza place in the valley. Along with the baked spaghetti pie your meal will be delightful. Finish it with the Italian Almond Wine Cake!,UNK
4127,"flavor was good, but there was more bread than I expected. Price was a bit high for what I got",UNK
4128,Lobster Quesadillas are to die for! 2pm - 7pm happy hour 50% off apps and drinks! So dank!,UNK
4129,"Potatos are amazing, a very solid breakfast choice. Bluberry infused french toast is ridiculously filling",UNK
4130,"Another good Cirque show...not great, but good!  I have seen so many Cirque shows that maybe I am just not as impressed by it anymore.  Just seems like they do the same acts in different shows...looking for something new and creative!",UNK
4131,"For less than 5 bucks it's definitely as good as it gets. \n\nIn my opinion I'd skip the pizza, but their burgers and sandwiches sure are tasty and hit the spot.\n\nI just wish there was one in San Francisco.",UNK
4132,"When here for lunch great food and very friendly staff :)...gave us free egg rolls,cheese wontons & a soda...I it's the small things that really count! Thanks for the great service and food!!!",UNK
4133,"Quick, professional, and friendly service. Mention Yelp to get discount. \nSO happy they were able to replace my cracked screen.",UNK
4134,"I would give this place 3.5 star rating if I could. Above average quality for buffet. Lots of choices, and even they had a lot of choices of asian food and dessert. Not worth the 1.5 hours waiting though, imo.",UNK
4135,The service here was excellent!  I was given very full portions and the service was very fast and friendly.  The food was pretty good and the price was reasonable.  Ofelia helped me and was very helpful and accomodating and fixed any issues that I had immediately.,UNK
4136,"have ordered from here a lot and tonight tried to order something different a kids meal and got told we are busy and not doing any substitutions. Way to be rude to customers, i took my business elsewhere.",UNK
4137,"Had a great time last night, 6.25 for 2 movies! we brought our own chairs, and picnic basket. The sound system is the radio on your car, so it shouldn't be a problem.",UNK
4138,"I didn't really like this one. We have been to lots of shows in Las Vegas, but this one was my least favorite. The theatre was really awesome, but the show was not that good. Probably worth going to if you can't find tickets to other shows.",UNK
4139,"Great tacos and salsa.  Carnitas, pescado, and goat...and good salsa and roasted jalape\u00f1os.",UNK
4140,"I'm not a beer drinker, but my friends and I come here sometimes for happy hour. Mojitos here rock!",UNK
4141,"Horrible! We were excited to eat here because of the name. However, the hot dogs were dried out and disgusting, buns were dry, and there are no refills on soda. I would suggest walking a couple of doors down to the burger joint.",UNK
4142,"TOO EFFIN' CROWDED. Find a different In N Out on your phone and go there instead for better service and less crowds. Otherwise, food is just like any other traditional In N Out which is delish!",UNK
4143,die Preise f\u00fcr Wurst und Fleisch f\u00fcr seine Supermarktqualit\u00e4t sind sehr \u00fcberzogen.,UNK
4144,"The service was appalling. They left us on the back patio and forgot about us.  When something was said, they didn't seem to care.  We left and went to Phoenix City Grill.",UNK
4145,Adorable coffee house. Love their fall drinks. Pumpkin chai...mmmmmmm!,UNK
4146,Amazing breakfast. Have come here on several occasions and am never disappointed with what I get. Stop by and check it out.,UNK
4147,This place is delicious !  Great family place and not too expensive. The plates are huge also so you definitely get what you pay for. Service was good! although it was a bit packed and had to wait 15 min to be seated but it was well worth the wait!,UNK
4148,"I have been there many times, including business dinners. We always seem to get the same waiter with the pony tail. He never disappoints. The food is always consistent, and the restaurant is always packed. I really enjoy going here for good italian food.",UNK
4149,"Growth Nation and AZIGG have worked with Sonoran Studios on several occasions and they have always been fast, reliable, professional, available and GREAT. It means a lot not to have to worry about A/V - Sonoran has it handled. Highly recommended!",UNK
4150,Nice big beer selection but the food wasn't so great (spicy tuna roll and California roll are not what you expect and don't really taste as one would expect either).,UNK
4151,"Not sure how this place is for dinner, but for lunch it is more cafeteria than anything else.  Food is not served to you at lunch.  You have to get up and get it yourself even if you are paying almost $30 for a prime rib!",UNK
4152,Service was good.  Strip steaks were adequate but not spectacular. Pretzel bites were good but hard to eat without burning yourself.,UNK
4153,doesn't deserve a star..not a great Insurance group.don't bother signing up I was a member for 2 years then what did u guys do I got laid off and denied my claim...don't waste your money.,UNK
4154,My go to when I don't want to sit in a smokey bar to eat dinner.  Fast friendly service and good food.,UNK
4155,"I am in meat heaven! Everything is perfectly prepared, the service is fantastic and the manager Marco was phenomenal! We had an allergy issue and they knew not only what we could and could not have, they knew every ingredient in every dish! Eagerly looking forward to coming back!",UNK
4156,"Great balkan style lunch menu!\nExcellent Hummus, fresh salad and vegetables and the chicken skewers were also very well seasoned.. But a little bit dry.\nService was very friendly! :-)",UNK
4157,"Nice little place, and the free mug thing is pretty cool. I am informed they hardly card *anyone*, but I'm not sure whether that's the case or not. Nothing too huge, but it is a tradition, and it's kinda cute.",UNK
4158,Great food. Baked Mac n Cheese is delicious.  Definitely try the Wasabi Cream sauce.  Can't wait to go back.,UNK
4159,This place was super boring .. I wouldn't go back... U can't smoke weed lol \nBut super boring here,UNK
4160,"Clean and convenient public restroom on the strip, you don't have to walk through 9 miles of mall or casino to find it.  Just sayin', keep it in mind...",UNK
4161,Not nearly as good as the original in LA. One nice thing is the 3am closing time. Skip this outpost and save yourself for the original.,UNK
4162,"Delicious and well-priced slices. Definitely going to marry the garlic knots one day. It's pretty packed on the weekends, especially after Alive After Five, but the service is quick.",UNK
4163,"Within walking distance from my apartment - I felt good about walking to get my groceries when I knew I would be given more organic choices - without the snobby upsell.  Trader Joe's is doing everything right by keeping things simple, tolerable and light hearted",UNK
4164,Great locally owned cafe with quality coffee! Cozy atmosphere and a few outdoor tables to enjoy some nice Carolina weather.,UNK
4165,I ordered the spicy chicken gui on the grill. It was very delicious. I went with a group of 7 and they were very accommodating to us. The staff was friendly. I will come here again for sure.,UNK
4166,"It's a divey little bar in a sketchy part of town and for what I this better than most.\nKaraoke Wednesdays\n$1,50 beers during NFL",UNK
4167,We had our car windows tinted there this morning.  LOVE IT!  They were done ahead of schedule and did a great job.,UNK
4168,Best place for ramen noodles! Great flavor on all there dishes and best part it's cheap!,UNK
4169,Food was not bad! Waiters kept a full drink on our table. Not much to choose from. Good price.Overall seemed like a good spot for a quick fix.,UNK
4170,"I got the chicken salad, and its more salad than chicken. I counted a total of 6 little squares of chicken. For $8 I expected more chicken!",UNK
4171,We perform this self-guided tour Concert Hall gigantic. It is an amazing place if they will not have to miss any important concert. We could not attend but knew the place was worth ...,UNK
4172,one of the worst steak sandwiches i've ever eaten. there were 7 of us and the only people who liked their food were the kids and the one who had the pizza. \n\ni would never eat here again,UNK
4173,The service was horrible and the food wasn't very good either. Our server was rude and very slow.,UNK
4174,Looks like their always pack!!!!,UNK
4175,"5 stars for sure - Carmon was prompt, professional, friendly and fair. Great to know there is someone to rely on when you lose your keys! Would definitely recommend his services :))",UNK
4176,"Love the wings, service is cute. We doubted our waitress would remember our order because she didn't write anything down but she was SPOT ON.\n\nYou know what you get in Hooters. Well done.",UNK
4177,Local slot casino. No table games. But the main attraction is Fat Choy!,UNK
4178,Fast service! The order was made correctly and was delicious. Friendly staff. We had an order of 3 large pizzas and they were all good. Much better than other experiences I've had with Pizza Hut!,UNK
4179,Went for lunch had the fish fry. Really bad over cooked just bad. Will not ever go back,UNK
4180,"Good place to go to at reasonable prices.   I have found their fish is excellent for an Italian restaurant.  Pasta dishes tend to be a bit heavy.  Would give 5 stars,  but service here can be a hit or miss proposition.  Sometimes very good,  sometimes slow with the serving staff very confused.",UNK
4181,not bad... but because i couldnt eat meat i just try frise and sushi no... no. i ate befor better sushi in other bars...,UNK
4182,Very good fresh fish!! I am very picky because I'm from San Diego but I really liked this place,UNK
4183,landlord who got rid of Furr's now wants me to patronize? No way! Boycott!,UNK
4184,Once again I cannot say enough good things about the service and product from Maria. Our finished kitchen is beautiful!,UNK
4185,"I thought the prices were very high, considering how the food tasted.  The restaurant itself reminded me of Applebees because of the decor - It was an \""okay\"" experience, but I would probably not go back.",UNK
4186,Super knowledgable owner Rachel helped me figure out what cheeses I needed when I was indecisive and what they wet well with.  They were all excellent and my wine and cheese party was a success!!  So nice to finally have a true cheese shop in Charlotte.,UNK
4187,Never mind,UNK
4188,"Golds Gym SUCKS!!\n\nManager told me he was going to cancel membership,  failed to do so.\nHe doesn't even have the balls to call me.  What a pussie!!!!!!!!!!!!!",UNK
4189,Get the daily pasta special.. Can't beat it. Skip salad and dessert-won't have room,UNK
4190,"Love this place.  HUGE and tons of selection!  Snacks, drinks, gifts, furniture, dish wear, candles, lotions, etc.  \n\nFound the Japanese marble sodas.  =)",UNK
4191,AMAZING!  Lots of security to go through to get in but the grounds are great.  So relaxing and private.  The houses in the neighborhood are to die for!,UNK
4192,"The service is always friendly, and the food always good, but I find this location to have been extremely slow in the drive thru on my last 3 visits.",UNK
4193,"GREAT COFFEE, great service. What's not to like?! Check it out.",UNK
4194,"Service is a little weak, but you can't beat steak and eggs for only $3.99! My husband and I come here a lot and leave happy for what we paid for.",UNK
4195,"Sympathische Bedienung, gute Stimmung, gemischtes Publikum, angenehm leise Musik. Wenn ich wieder mal in KA bin hol mein Guinness dort.",UNK
4196,"Love, love, love this place! Its my to go thai joint. Food is yummy and service is an A+. Lunch prices are such a good deal and good sized portions. One of my fave's!",UNK
4197,"Bartender super unfriendly, Rhonda was her name. Said tourists ask too many questions. Had nachos they were ok. Customer service horrible.",UNK
4198,"3.5 stars. I would go back for the mussels, the wine and the vanilla souffle. We also had the duck and although the meat was good, I didn't like the flavor of the risotto.",UNK
4199,"Really enoyed our dinner, we tried the Shepards Pie and Fish and chips, both were very good.  Nice place on a residential street, will return",UNK
4200,Only based off the Menudo on a Sunday afternoon. The tripe and hominy needed to be cooked longer.,UNK
4201,poor service. rude servers. only go there when I have having a pho craving and there is no other choice,UNK
4202,"Rude employee. I will not be back. It's bad enough that dunkin does not make their product in house anymore, but to put up with rude people at 5:00 am???  There are plenty of other donut shops to go to.",UNK
4203,"Yes the service was slow, and the hostess acted like she didn't want to seat us.  Within 12 hours of eating here, I got sick to my stomach.",UNK
4204,Not great but good.,UNK
4205,"Wow, my husband and I were beyond impressed. Drinks are delicious and the the food so amazing. I had the special, which was a red snapper. Easily the best fish I have ever had. And in Arizona, too funny! Stellar!!!",UNK
4206,"This place was nothing special! If your looking for rude staff, over priced food and a long wait, this is the place for you...",UNK
4207,I love these donuts. Reminds of a place I used to go back home in Texas. The staff is very friendly.,UNK
4208,"I don't always eat Vegan, but when I do it's \""Bronze Cafe\"". Delicious, guilt free, creative items that make me wanting more. Highly recommended when in Las Vegas, NV.",UNK
4209,"The coffee was cold, the food was blah.  Nothing special and not worth the wait! The only thing that was to die for was the fried oreos--Amazing!",UNK
4210,"This place is awesome! Must go place in Vegas. Great drinks, food, and entertainment!",UNK
4211,"I will give them an extra star now that they have called me back and fixed the mistake.  But from the experience I had, I will probably still not use them again.",UNK
4212,great bbq!,UNK
4213,Good milkshakes! Real ice cream. Serving size good enough for two.,UNK
4214,"Not nearly as good as Russian groceries in other cities.  Some bakery items are stale depending on turnover. Vegetables are hit or miss,  But some items worth the trip. Husband and wife owners could be friendlier. Speaking in Russian helps.",UNK
4215,"One of my favorite meals I had on my last trip to the city! Oxtails, sides and desserts were outstanding!  Ill be moving to town in a few months and I hope to become a regular :)",UNK
4216,Overpriced drinks served by lousy inept bartenders.,UNK
4217,"Best pizza in Charlotte. Reminds me of New York, Boston style pizza. Nice huge slices. Took me 2 years to find a pizza place that deserves repeat business. I just wish they delivered. Staff is very down to earth.",UNK
4218,"Great deli meats, cheeses, sandwiches and accompaniments at a decent price. Really good homemade cheesecakes, by the slice. Also carry a variety of good beers, though these are a little pricey.",UNK
4219,Cold(brrr) and expensive. We liked the mannequin in the front of the bar the best.,UNK
4220,Just okay. My chicken katsu was overcooked and oily.,UNK
4221,Dr Raissi is the best. He took care of my achilles tear and was fantastic. I also recommend Dr Miao for anything above the knee. Both are great Dr's and are very nice.,UNK
4222,Its about the best mexican i've had in PHX.  Super consistent and delicious!,UNK
4223,Dis place is closed.,UNK
4224,Totally recommend this landscaping company.. They did a great job. Very reliable and what I really liked is that they had more two guys show up.  They had about six. Thank you for making my yard look good again.,UNK
4225,Spent almost $5 on a single butter burger that had a patty so small the bun actually has almost twice as many calories.  Thank you Culver's for helping renew my commitment to home cooked food.,UNK
4226,"the quality of the coffee depends on the person who makes it..sometimes its amazing,other times i cant even go through my cup,they make the best redvelevet and strawberry cakes but every thing else i got wasn't good at all",UNK
4227,"Huge portions , great food and ambiance!!!!",UNK
4228,Not the top Italian restaurant in town but a great spot for a lighter style of Italian if you don't want too much. Also a great spot for lunch especially with larger groups. Service was not too bad. Has a great location though in the Venetian.,UNK
4229,"This is my new favorite sushi place in the Valley of the Sun. Great prices, fresh,  and awesome service.  Overall very happy.",UNK
4230,"Good food, great prices!",UNK
4231,Not good pizza.,UNK
4232,"Blah. It was okay. I think if they lowered all of the prices by five dollars and added a couple of waitresses, I would have had an A+ experience. It was a huge tourist trap. Would probably not go back.",UNK
4233,The food is wonderful here!!  I've tried everything and love it all.  My favorite is the combo kabob plate you get a little bit of everything and you can share it with a friend.  They serve you lots of food so be hungry or just take rest home for another meal.,UNK
4234,Food was fine the waiter was nice but the duration for food drinks or anything is unreal- stay the hell away and it's way to expensive for what you get... A waste of time and money I will tell all my friends and family to skip this over priced Denny's,UNK
4235,We went later in the evening so we were seated pretty fast. Had the queso dip and salads. Food was good but service was really slow.,UNK
4236,The drive thru people act like they are on the Beavis and Butthead show.,UNK
4237,"Loved the little 3D show they had here, other than that the MMs were overpriced & it'd most likely melt in the Vegas sizzling weather anyways.",UNK
4238,I went in to have my laptop looked at. I was asked if I needed help right away and Nick was awesome. He fixed my problems easily and professionally. I will be returning with my husband's laptop for a full tune up.,UNK
4239,Worst buffet I have ever been to in Las Vegas. Absolutely a rip off  what chef? I see nothing worthy that is here warranting a good rating for a buffet. Waste of hard earned money. Management could care less if food bad.  Never ever would I recommend this place 100%,UNK
4240,Just witnessed a most sexist and unfair firing of a waitress in front of other customers. The owner was rude to other customers who tried to come to her aid. He said he lost a regular because she brought him the wrong tea. He lost a lot more regulars because of his public display of anger.,UNK
4241,"Listened to our wishes, submitted a plan, worked with us as we revised the plan both in cost and design, did the work and we have enjoyed the results for two years now.  I have referred this company to my neighbors, friends and acquaintances--I'm that happy with the results.",UNK
4242,Best sushi in Las Vegas hands down!  Service is awesome! Restaurant is clean. This pace is so good we went two days in a row.  Another bonus is that they are open late too. Can't wait to go back!,UNK
4243,Back again!!  Had a classic cheese burger. Don't even try to eat the whole thing!!  Was so good!!,UNK
4244,"Food is no. Better than a school cafeteria, bland,, typical cheap crap better to pay more.than come here",UNK
4245,Interesting place to say the least. Crowd was good and lively and the beer was priced fairly. They have a foozball table and a good selection of music.,UNK
4246,Havent been to this mall in awhile. This mall is a shell of what it use to be. Its pretty much a indoor swap meet these days. Im honestly surprise its still in business. The only good thing about it is they have quite a bit of shoe stores than most malls.,UNK
4247,"If you are feeling hungry with a fellow carnivore, I recommend the Meat and Potatoes for two.  A 36oz Ribeye with potato wedges and bone marrow butter for $55.  Yummo!\n\nBurgers are also really great!",UNK
4248,What's not to love about Louis V??? Always go here to see the seasons newest and best! I'm in love with red! When not in Paris ... Scottsdale will have to do! Love my LV!,UNK
4249,"Bad service, walked out before i even ordered. Smelled like bad triple sec.",UNK
4250,There was a hair in my spring roll... enough said...,UNK
4251,"Probably one of the worst restaurants in Charlotte. No Joke. The service is horrible. Bad attitude, not helpful and lazy. The food tastes like cheap frozen boxes.. The view is great, but don't eat there.",UNK
4252,Ordered a regular tuna roll and there was a bone in it... The tuna itself was not that good either. This place is very pricey and not great. I would recommend going somewhere else.,UNK
4253,"The only reason I am giving 2 stars is the beer.  As for the rest, imagine overpaying for not-so-good food in a restaurant that smells like dirty dishwater and looks like it came from chain restaurant heaven.  I guess I just prefer local restaurants over chains.",UNK
4254,"Yummy sandwiches, the bread is very good",UNK
4255,"Met my honey here on our very first date :) But - had some orange dreamsicle latte that was disgusting and it was also very very quiet in there - no music and tons of people studying, so it felt like a library. We had to leave just so we could talk.",UNK
4256,What an amazing Nail Salon! They made my nails exactly how I wanted them to be. Plus they are affordable! I will be a repeat customer for sure! Hands down the best nail salon I have found in vegas!,UNK
4257,"Best sub I've ever had, seriously amazing and I will be returning I'll be dreaming of my next sub\n\nI've been back and it's just as good as the first AMAZING",UNK
4258,The only reason it got 2 starts is because the food was okay.\nBut I went into that bar twice and both times I saw a fight. And one time a creepy old man was hitting on my wife the whole time.\nNever ever again will I got to that hole!,UNK
4259,"Rolled by Starbucks at 8:30am for breakfast, which was a tall steamed non-fat milk and an apple bran muffin.  I guess it was decent enough to rate a 3, but I have to subtract 1 star for the lack of organic milk.",UNK
4260,"Good burger for the price, especially if you get it animal style.  Still though, they don't have bacon.  NO BACON!!  That would be like the equivalent of opening up a pizza joint but having no pepperoni.  Shame.",UNK
4261,I have found them to be less than accomodating or helpful.,UNK
4262,Fast in the drive thru....awesome service. baristas are so friendly and nice,UNK
4263,I hate this center it would so hard to get in and out of; especially on weekends and during the holidays. I have almost been hit a handful of times there and seen more accidents than I can count in the last 10 years.,UNK
4264,"This may be my new addiction. The staff is very helpful and attentive. I could have spent hours in there. Hopefully, if my schedule allows, I will be able to to take a jewelry class.",UNK
4265,this place is really bad!!!,UNK
4266,"Jerry the owner is one of the best artists in town. He tattoos because he loves it not for the money. My tattoo was not rushed and he made it look great. Prices are very cheap, probably half of any other shop. My favorite place to get tattoos by far!",UNK
4267,"Kudos for having a separate vegetarian menu -- it made it really easy to order. The chopped salad I had was decent, though more like a poor man's version of Burmese tea leaf salad. Minus one star for charging four bucks for chips & salsa.",UNK
4268,2nd time here and I love it no complaints. The people in NC are so nice and helpful here wow just wow,UNK
4269,"Good food with a great environment. Came here for lunch, ordered a sandwich, and left with a satisfied belly. However, the food can be really oily, especially the sandwiches and fries.",UNK
4270,Good quality sushi a little heavy on the wasabi. But for me very overpriced but I guess that's Vegas.,UNK
4271,"Went back for happy hour, highly recommended.  You can try several different items to eat, get full, and not break the bank.  Also a quality selection of beers and good amount of outdoor seating with misters if it's not 120 degrees out.  I'll definitely be back.",UNK
4272,"Great food, but kinda steep on pricing. ($1/inch on subs.) Got 1 wrap and 2 regular sized subs for $22!",UNK
4273,"Dane County was a fun and warm airport. Although it's small, there was plenty of food and drink options. For the business travelers, I did not notice any wifi stations or recharging stations.",UNK
4274,Just not a favorite place. Food is subpar and bar tenders seem to have their minds on the women customers versus trying to serve.  After giving a few try's will not go back.,UNK
4275,Great place with a beautiful atmosphere and great service. Try the silver noodle soup and follow it with some Pad Tai!,UNK
4276,"Over-priced and overrated. Somewhere along the way, this chain started prioritizing the gimmick over the food.",UNK
4277,Alright first things first the Oaxaca burrito is a solid 5 stars but the rest of the menu is mediocre in the taste category with little in appeal beyond just a normal little mexican restaurant. The one on the south side is better than the one up north!!!,UNK
4278,"this place deserves five stars! the ones who gave any less most likely did not order the SAGE FRIED CHICKEN BENEDICT! lol \n\nbut beware, servings are huge so plan to share!",UNK
4279,Good place to go and eat gyros if your up in North Scottsdale. The staff is friendly and the food gets to you real fast. The price is somewhere between 7-10 per meal but that's usual for N. Scottsdale.,UNK
4280,"Totally agree, Connie H. No need to panic. He has my wedding, babies, memories, first home, etc..... There has been a tragedy in the family but there is not any reason to call names or make accusations.",UNK
4281,"Great \""Everyman\"" pub. Just beer and basic drinks, but that's ok. Sociable atmosphere. Appeared to be mostly locals, but I felt right at home. 30-something crowd give or take.",UNK
4282,You must be an extreme carnivore to eat here.  Menu is hard to follow.  Nothing but pork and beef.  A little snooty.,UNK
4283,"Good, small portions. Pricey for simple foods. Nice environment.",UNK
4284,First time here and definitely will come back soon!,UNK
4285,"Marielle said it all. Very unprofessional. Beware the owner, he will never respond to phone calls or text messages due to prior engagements. Satisfied with their previous maid service, but unsatisfied with their business.",UNK
4286,I stop by on the way home to get some beignets. This was my first time there and they were absolutely awesome. This will be a regular stop on the way home.,UNK
4287,"Bagels are good, just like any other place in town.  \n\nService and staff are horrible, I'm not going there again.  \n\nI work, and I live less then 3 miles from this place.",UNK
4288,"It's on the Royal Mile so expect quite a few tourists, especially during the peak season.\n\nOk range of beer, with good food, you should see the size of the Shepard's pie, huge ;-)\n\ngood place for a quick pint",UNK
4289,"Best del taco in town hands down. Staff is amazing. Food is wonderful. Can't ask for anything better. Also just found out dining is open until 2am on most days and on the weekends, open all night! Score!",UNK
4290,Best burger ever! must try,UNK
4291,Enjoy coming to this location for all my pool needs. Alan is extremely helpful with all my questions and concerns,UNK
4292,Such a great place! My 2 year old was so excited to see the lions! We will make frequent trips!,UNK
4293,Haze is a very nice club.  I didn't enjoy the long lines or the fat that there were no seats available for regular patrons but I guess that is one of the clubs rules.,UNK
4294,"I love this place, but the line situation is out of control. It's dreadful. There's not enough cashiers and there was like 15 people in line waiting.  They gotta figure this out better.",UNK
4295,I was insane not to give this place Five Stars. They are a treasure in the East Valley.,UNK
4296,Walked in and asked for a plain manicure. Was taken in immediately. Treated with great respect and kindness. Facility very clean. Would return in a heartbeat.,UNK
4297,Excellent quality.  We ordered the half chicken and chicken soup.  Everything was very flavorful and fresh.  A nice little place.  Recommended!,UNK
4298,Just had what have been the best Reuben of my life but I did just have the most expensive one. $9 for a small sandwich with no sides just seem a bit much.,UNK
4299,No no no. What place are you people eating? The reviews looked good but the food was the same bland slop I could get at any stripmall place in the country. Panda Express is better than this. I am not criticizing the owners just the reviewers!,UNK
4300,Pool was awesome. Sportsbook great. Rooms on point. Best craps tables. Turned 100 into 5100 dollars in 4 hours. Insanity.  Couldn't have had a better trip. Got rooms comped and rooms comped for next month,UNK
4301,"Jack is the best! Very professional and respects customers. The whole team at manolo blahnik are incredible, even their manager. Thank you jack for everything! Will definitely come back and buy more pairs!",UNK
4302,Seriously the best shaved ice I have ever had.... the flavors are fabulous and the ice is shaved to perfection. The owners of it are super friendly and you can tell they work really hard to please their customers. 10 out of 10.,UNK
4303,Drove all the way out there because it said it was open on Yelp. Turns out it was closed. No signage saying it was closed for the holiday weekend. Just emptiness.,UNK
4304,Visited friend John Mo in Pittsburgh for one night and he brought me here...great move. Big fatty sandwich but really really delicious.,UNK
4305,Super chill bar. LOVED the all white interior. LOVED the bartender. LOVED the music. What else is there to say? I'll be back!,UNK
4306,I have flown Southwest for a long time and they are an ok airlines. I would fly with them if it takes me more then 3 hrs to get to my destination but otherwise you would be better of on Jet Blue or Spirit which is way cheaper for example if you were going to LA or SD.,UNK
4307,They do a nice job on all my Pommies! It took a couple visits for them to get all my particular wants down but they did! Nice people and close to home.,UNK
4308,At eagle's concert,UNK
4309,Eh just okay. It was hot of course and misters would have been graet.,UNK
4310,The shower in this hotel is the worst shower I have ever taken a shower in.. I could Pee stronger than this shower. Absolutely no water pressure to wash off the smell of strippers and beer.,UNK
4311,Without a doubt...best burger in America\n\nThe service was outstanding. I would highly recommend this place to anyone. Good for families...prices reasonable.,UNK
4312,"This location is 10x better than the Henderson location, the employees look presentable, they're much nicer, and the store is a lot better.",UNK
4313,Waited 15 minutes and no waiter ever came to take our order. Walked out. Horrible service!,UNK
4314,"Va Dang is pretty darn delicious. I prefer Pho Thanh, but thats my taste. I like the broth better at Pho Thanh, however Va Dang has way better deserts available.",UNK
4315,"Amazing! So far the Works is my favorite: biscoff, strawberries, and cream. The cream is very thick and creamy :) The biscoff is delicious! Not cheap but so good and very filling. And super friendly people that work there. Love this truck!",UNK
4316,Tried the food twice and it was so good. The staff was very friendly and let me try a few different things before I made my decision. I will definitely go back... a lot.,UNK
4317,"An ok burger, but not quality.  Bun was nice as were the fries and shake, but burger was not 100% beef.  It was kind of soggy and looked unappealing.  Taste was ok...nothing to write home about.",UNK
4318,"I love this place. I can't say enough it was so nice! Really huge too, definitely do the BBQ!!",UNK
4319,Good cappuccino. They brew Commonplace coffee. I liked the bird in the cage. Overall nice place.,UNK
4320,"The food is always good and the price is reasonable. However, the place can be a real dump sometimes, which is a big turn off for me.",UNK
4321,"Nice rustic dark atmosphere, with good burgers and excellent chili. Prices are more than fair with adequate service.",UNK
4322,Made a reservation for a brunch here with my fam. The food was just okay for me. A bit pricey but I have expected it. But definitely love the Frozen Hot Chocolate!!!,UNK
4323,"Dude. The atmosphere of this place is top notch. The food, and drink is excellent. Monday's are all you can eat fish and chips, and it's probably the best in town. They are a great place, if you love watching soccer, you will be in ultimate heaven.",UNK
4324,"Top 5 favorite breakfast places in Vegas for Me. In my opinion, they have the best, simple home made buttermilk pancakes. The atmosphere is kind of dainty and old, but the food both breakfast and lunch definitely makes up for it.",UNK
4325,i really wanted to love this place but i gotta say it wasnt as great as some people pump it up to be .....dont get me wrong the food was good but not mind blowing,UNK
4326,"We finally tried this place and I have to say the food was good, did lack a little flavor , but over all good food and good prices.",UNK
4327,Horrible service this evening ... Walked in at 7 pm ... We occupied only table in restaurant ... Sat for 20 minutes while they took new take out orders ignoring us even though we told them we were ready to order ... Finally walked out,UNK
4328,"The food here was \""ok\"". The chips & salsa were good, but everything else was mediocre. I don't think the food was worth the price. Service was excellent.",UNK
4329,My good friend introduce the place to me. I think Tian is the best!!!\nHe is very friendly and professional.,UNK
4330,"The atmosphere is great. It's like an old narrow bar with plenty of counter & booth seats. The food is amazing. Everything we had was good, the brisket, jambalaya, twice baked potatoes, & sweet potato fries.  We will definitely come back.",UNK
4331,"nice food! just the price seems little bit expensive, two ppl paid 64 pounds",UNK
4332,Met up with a friend here to have some drinks. The crowd was very sketchy. Lots of bikers and hoodlums. Was a hold on tight to your wallet tight type of place. Although I hear they have very good wings. Might have to hire a body guard and go check them out.,UNK
4333,This place is ok. I love the curbside food pick-up option. This is great when you are on your way home from work and don't want to cook. Unfortunately the food is not consistent in quality.,UNK
4334,"One of the finest AJ's locations I have encountered.  The items are always well stocked, the service is always impeccable and the Grill is always well serviced.  The bakery happens to be my favorite, with a vast selection of exquisite desserts.  Never fails to impress.",UNK
4335,I absolutely love Island Flavor! My family lives in Hawaii and I've been to many local restaurants on Oahu. Island flavor definitely is up to par with those local restaurants. I would recommend a favorite dish but it's difficult because they are all exquisite! Definitely recommended!,UNK
4336,"Super fun, interactive sushi chefs when sitting at the sushi bar! Jay's Burrito is my favorite. Very nice prices for good sushi!",UNK
4337,So freaking good. Will was a great help and explained the menu when we walked up. Our crew ordered sandwiches then went over to Dino's to pick up some cold beers to go with our sandwiches. Will brought us our food and it was divine. Definitely worth checking this spot out.,UNK
4338,I didn't even want to go. I was so wrong! Best place I ate in Vegas.,UNK
4339,Service was great.  This price for dim sum at this place is the cheapest.  My favorites were  the tripe and the chicken feet.  Would definitely come here again.,UNK
4340,"Stopped here to grab a hot coffee but made the mistake of asking \""with sugar\"". It was so sweet that it felt like having sugar syrup so my advise would be to skip the sugar or stick with Starbucks.",UNK

4349,"This place feels like a Goodwill.   Areas are picked over, the men's clothing section is dusty, empty in places and just plain sad.   They have some nice things in their home accessories section where we have found some very nice items for good prices.  We don't go here much anymore.",UNK
4350,"The menu was small and underwhelming. The flatbread pizza most likely came out of the box. They didn't have the sauces, so the gave us ketchup to go with over cooked shrimp/bacon and extremely greasy fries.",UNK

4367,"My pho of choice is chicken, and the chicken pho at this place had an unusual flavor - kind of sweet.  But otherwise, not much other flavor.  I had to keep adding soy sauce & sriracha but overall a disappointing meal.  I won't be back.",UNK

4380,I saw this show for free when they first appeared in Vegas. Back then they had a better Circus vibe with more activities outside the tent.  Now they only have a bar.  I guess they need to save money.  The show was very good and up close and personal.,UNK

4388,"The very first time I went the buffalo location and I  thought it was just ok. I found out they had another restaurant on Durango and not only is it around the corner but the restaurant bigger, all of their staff is always pleasant but I thought the quality of food was better at this location!!",UNK
4389,"Very good but I still think Ruth Chris makes the best steak. Had 20 ounce rib eye (bone 3 ounces), creamed spinach, and split salad with wine on date night.",UNK
4390,Definitely not my first choice for gelato. Taste generic and more like ice cream rather than gelato. Highly disappointed.,UNK

4400,Last call is a 1130pm.  Fail.  The Bourbon steak bar is awesome cuz there is nobody in it.  Fat people are loners.,UNK

4408,I was not impressed with this restaurant.  The food was average...and not very fresh.  You could tell it was all frozen and processed.  I'd rather spend my money on a dozen other restaurants that serve the same food but at a much higher quality.,UNK

4444,The pizza is so good that I forgive them for being Red Sox fans and will continue to eat there despite all the Red Sox posters. So if a New Yorker can tolerate Red Sox paraphernalia the Pizza has to be good!,UNK
4445,Was more smokey than other casino's.  We have a great time playing all the games.,UNK
4446,"The parking lot is all done now, so getting in and out is much less difficult. \n\nEither this place is set up oddly or I am because I can never find anything there. I wander around until either finding somebody or giving up (it's about 50/50).",UNK
4447,"Food is good, but we walked out after we were told to sit down then ignored as the lone waitress helped ten people who ordered at the counter.  This will affect if we ever come back.\nUpdate: I've gone back and the key is to never sit down before ordering.",UNK

4477,"Thought the repairs would be $160-170 for a belt and motor bolts. Turned out to be $1600-1700. Apparently this is a normal price, but they could have at least been clear and concise when telling me the price. Avoiding Midas from now on.",UNK

4498,Seeing the reviews on Yelp it looks like a really good place to eat because of the high reviews . The items were pretty pricey and the food was ok.

4518,Great food! I was lookin for something to eat that was close to where I was workin and I found Jimmy G's. Had no idea it was here but very happy I found it though!,UNK
4519,Terrible pizza.  I can buy a better pizza at HT.  Staff is very unfriendly. I don't see why this has so many stars.  Nasty is the word to describe the unsavory taste. I would rather drive 15 miles to Wolfmans Pizza.,UNK
4520,amazing the dbl elk burger is awesome moist burger and gigantic... wish it was closer...,UNK
4521,I do not like Garcia's pizza very much! From the outside the place looks cute and very inviting but once you go inside you will think differently! The pizza is nothing to talk about and I would suggest going somewhere else!,UNK
4522,"Arrived at 9:25pm to be told in a very dis-interested manner that they closed at ten, therefore forget it. They must start being \""closed\"" about an hour before closing time, won't be back",UNK
4523,This is by far the worst experience I have ever had. I've always loved Bahama bucks and never had a problem. But today I ordered ice cream flavored shaved ice and get a cup of ice cream and shaved ice. This is ridiculous...,UNK
4524,Tasty sandwich. I gave 3 stars only because I drove 45 minutes to try their sandwich. The sandwich while tasty did not impress me to worth the long drive.,UNK
4525,Gone donw since last time we where here. New owner?  First game day not organized at. Food was cold half cooked not enough staff to keep up.,UNK
4526,The prices are a little high and the food is ok. I have had better pizza. The wings where also ok. The people where nice both times we have eaten there.,UNK
4527,One of the best places in town.  Love the food and the wine.  Great date place.,UNK
4528,"Really good service and atmosphere.  Food was good, but over-spiced and definitely pricy.  I would go back, just not very often.",UNK
4529,"FINALLY! Found some tacos worthy of my time. They offer regular size as well as the mini \""street tacos\"" size. Prices are really cheap and everyone loved what they got. This has become my destination for tacos.",UNK
4530,"Crazy yummy brunch menu!  Great place to hang.  Food was awesome, serves quick, and service was top notch!",UNK
4531,"Fun atmosphere, great tasting small plates, nice selection of wine, friendly staff. The food is beautiful and delicious. We shared about 7 dishes between the three of us and were able to try a lot of yummy things plus have room for dessert.",UNK
4532,Excellent care and service!\nHighly recommend this place and the staff!\nI have been coming here for 10 + years.,UNK
4533,Pretty darn great!! Al pastor tacos...awesome! And the street corn was perfect. I'm looking forward to trying more kinds of tacos. The salsa bar is great but the topping on the tacos is legit. No need for any extras,UNK
4534,"The food here varies depending on who is cooking, but when it's good it's melt your fucking face good.",UNK
4535,"This is an awesome whole in the wall for people who like to sit at the bar.  Bartenders are great, good peeps, and great foodies.  Give it a try when you are looking for the hole in the wall (but nice at the same time).",UNK
4536,we went there for lunch and they have a pretty nice lunch menu. i had their steakhouse burger and it was pretty tasty! would definitely go again because the price was definitely right.,UNK
4537,"The chicken is fantastic, the potatoes are amazing, and the service is prompt. I would recommend anything on the menu. This food doesn't even compare to other fried chicken joints.",UNK
4538,"Fukuda is closed. It's now Lomito, a South American restaurant. @lomitotruck\n\n\n...\n\n\n...\n\n\n...",UNK
4539,Had the eight corner pizza and a salad last night. Being from the Bronx NY I had my reservations but let me tell you it was not bad at all. I think I found my new favorite pizza joint now that I live in Matthews now.,UNK
4540,I gave this location such a low rating because the store is usually a mess. Having worked in supermarkets before I've noticed that products you think would be in the same aisle are in a completely irrelevant spot. Their shelves need to be reset in a better manner.,UNK
4541,Good pizza.,UNK
4542,Incredible! What can one say? It's like eating in a master chef's house.\n\n6 stars ******,UNK
4543,Awesome venue for concerts! I hate the concerts that are wedged in the center of a casino. \n\nThese guys know their shiz,UNK
4544,"Great welcoming staff & friendly service.  The sushi was just average.  It need some improving.  Also, there was a mess up on the order that shouldn't of be missed.",UNK
4545,"Walked in starving for a good sandwhich and some soup.  Menu was so unoriginal hubub and I walked out and went to Paradise across the way, which isn't all that great either.\n\nNothing special here.",UNK
4546,The food was okay. The crumb cake they serve hot was amazing but the eggs Benedict was just average.,UNK
4547,Great food and flavor and the bulgogi had an awesome taste. The staff was friendly and its great food with a great price. I recommend the bulgogi fries to everyone,UNK
4548,Absolutely fabulous restaurant! One of the best of the best I have ever been. The service was impeccable. We can't wait to come back next time we are in Vegas!,UNK
4549,"They are saving money by doing the first coat of polish with some crappy off brand in a similar color. The polish looks really bad, the impurities in the crappy polish are showing. Not recommended.",UNK
4550,"We absolutely love this shop! We stopped going to any other shops because of Casey the owner. They have the best juices, great prices, and AMAZING customer service. This place is the BIZZNAZZ",UNK
4551,mediocre food and terrible service,UNK
4552,Friendly service and delicious ice cream!,UNK
4553,"Love the bread!!! Healthy salad options, bakery goods are delicious too! Breakfast here is always delicious as well.  Good customer service, consistent food quality and overall yumminess!",UNK
4554,"Cool hotel on the south end of the strip, close to the newer hotels.  Decent prices",UNK
4555,"We visited while in town for work, and had a nice evening on the patio with some sangria (both white and red were yummy) and a couple of tapas. The servers were a tiny bit slow, but very nice. Overall a good visit!",UNK
4556,"I like the different way it is set and what makes it unique, but somehow fighting for table, and the yelling of our name for kitchen uhh ,also limited  choices and cash only",UNK
4557,Good classic bar food and then some.  $5 burgers every Tuesday after 5pm. Good cocktails. Calamari good but portion looks deceiving as lettuce lays below calamari.,UNK
4558,"The burger was amazing. The fries are good with the seasoning salt, but otherwise not my cup of tea. Service is fair. Price is pretty cheap.",UNK
4559,The food was just ok in my opinion. I would say that Golden Corral is much better on a good day. I did enjoy the cotton candy and the fruit tarts...everything else was just meh...,UNK
4560,As a bride I was VERY disappointed with the services!  They ran more than a half hour past my appointment making me late to my own wedding and because the hair dresser was rushing the curls all fell out and my hair looked horrible; I would have been better off doing it myself!,UNK
4561,We missed the first venue but had a great time at every other place. It was worth the price and would recommend it to everyone who wants to check out multiple bars!,UNK
4562,One star for not breaking a $100 bill if total is $20 bucks.,UNK
4563,It's definitely faster getting through security here than at DIA (my home airport) but it's an airport. How great can it be?,UNK
4564,Good breakfast selection. I enjoyed the fresh coffee and the customer service. I had the chiliaquiles which I felt had an over abundance of sauce and not enough chips. The husband and I shared a cinnamon roll which was delicious. Nice hole in the wall diner.,UNK
4565,Love there bagels & sammy's. not a fan of the coffee but everything else is yummy. Staff is always pleasant,UNK
4566,They have the slowest drive thru service.  Don't go to this location if you're running late!,UNK
4567,"Unfortunately this place has horrible customer service. They messed up my order and refused to make it right. Their food is just like their customer service - horrible. See for yourself, why don't you :)",UNK
4568,"I love this place - the turkey burger, fries, and shakes are delicious. It's nicely decorated and homey with fun trivia and riddles on the numbered cards they give you to indicate your order. I've never been disappointed here.",UNK
4569,"I've visited this Denny's every time I'm been to Vegas since 1999. Convenient location, decent prices for the Strip. Food standard Denny's, and I've had good service every time I've been there.",UNK
4570,"Not bad for a tiny neighborhood pizza place. Not great either. The pizza crust was crunchy and perfectly cooked. The ingredients on our pepperoni and mushroom were just ok, not top shelf ingredients. The chicken wings were surprisingly good.",UNK
4571,Worst casino hotel I've ever been to!. Had some fucking guard yelling at me through the casino and following me and had the maid barge in my room before check out. I have ptsd and this was the worst possible vacation. Thanks tuscany!,UNK
4572,This was the best eye exam and prescription I've had in years...Everything is so crisp and clear with my new lenses..If you want the best vision possible I strongly recommend using this practice for all your eye care needs.,UNK
4573,"The worst cleaner ever.  When I arrived to pick up my jacket, it was still in their dirty laundry basket.  I will never go back.  This place is unorganized & messy!",UNK
4574,My son loved the sushi the portions are huge !!!,UNK
4575,"Food was decent for what it is.\n Generous portions,friendly counter guy.\nPlace probably would fail a health inspection thou.\nNever going back!",UNK
4576,The Mini Shrimp Chimis are just ok & the HOT hot sauce that comes with the chips is not very hot.,UNK
4577,Awesome service and food. Great place to celebrate a birthday or anniversary. Wish I could visit more often.,UNK
4578,"Great rolled tacos and machaca burrito. But, the smell of pine sol was too strong. Wished there would haven been outdoor seating.",UNK
4579,"Got marguerita pizza, Crust is amazing. Flavors good. Hard to eat like a pizza when it's flooded with water from the canned tomatoes. Had to get a fork and knife. Had they used fresh tomatoes pizza would be perfect 5 stars if fixed!",UNK
4580,Sonora Hot Dog...How can you go wrong with a bacon wrapped hot dog?  Pretty good when your hungry and tired from walking up and down the strip.,UNK
4581,Terrible food and service. Every dish was disgusting and the staff ignored us continuously.,UNK
4582,"If you like sushi - this is a must GO place. You should ask for the specials because the head chef gets top of the shelf sushi from all over the world. Simply amazing food, service and great atmosphere",UNK
4583,I have been to this noodle cafe many times and love love their Ramen. Their TanTanMen is very good and very hot. I like their Shrimp Shumai too.  The sushi is OK but I don't go there for that.,UNK
4584,Service was great. Beer was cheap. Good menu options for large parties including veggies.,UNK
4585,I typically do not like chain restaurants but the service here is always amazing. I haven't had dinner at this specific location. I usually go Tuesday nights when they have $1 fish tacos that are amazing!They have amazing happy hour specials and during the summer the patio is great!,UNK
4586,"Very disappointing, bland food, burnt pizza crust. Only reason we didn't walk out was the lovely food server Vagana. Will not go again, the end of a family tradition. Time to pick a new italian restaurant for next year.",UNK
4587,Sunday 2 4 1 refills are great,UNK
4588,Located inside Palms Casino. Didn't have a good experience. They advertisied a special but did not honor it when we got there.,UNK
4589,The zoo is really nice and the staff are very friendly!,UNK
4590,A good place for a quick lunch. While the bad thing is that it is not always quick enough.,UNK
4591,Chicken and beef enchiladas and steak burrito were just average.  The spice really overwhelms any other flavors and the meats were low quality.,UNK
4592,The pad Thai was absolutely disgusting. The Mongolian beef was average. I would have been happier at a Panda Express. It's sad because the service was good but we should have taken a clue when the restaurant was empty.,UNK
4593,From start to finish the place is great. Seared Big Eye Tuna was the choice of the evening and they did it right. Service was top notch. Great Wine list too! It's a must if you are in the Area.,UNK
4594,Hands down the best empanadas in Las Vegas. The malabon was excellent. The pastries were very delicious. Service was fast and friendly. I will definitely be back for more.,UNK
4595,The quality of the food was very good.  This is more of a take out restaurant than a sit down.,UNK
4596,Fabulous service.  Fabulous cleaning.  Not such great prices...but you get what you pay for.  (and they speak English!),UNK
4597,"Went with wife and two kids for dinner.  We had a great time. The food was delicious, service was great and ambiance just right.  Go here!  You will not be disappointed",UNK
4598,Lobster Kim Chee fried rice is one of the best things on the menu in my opinion.,UNK
4599,A must see show for rock and roll lovers. Quality and vibe. Great to get to see these stars on stage on a very close and lively musical proposal. Great music selection,UNK
4600,"A show with Australian, nearly naked men dancing and drives women crazy with their bodies. The men are good looking and do they know about it too. Sometimes you get shocked even though you know what will happen. Funny and sexy!",UNK
4601,"I really enjoy this location cause all the staff is pretty helpful and knowledgeable about there products! They have fantastic specials and great vitamin selection! \nI love all there bulk items that you can buy, by the ounce!",UNK
4602,Very disappointing. The food is mediocre and WAY OVER PRICED for the quality. This place is fine for some beers in the bar and watching sports but eat before you get here.,UNK
4603,"This store is good for girlie needs. Cute glasses, napkins, and gifts. Also you can make your own lotion scents. Pretty cool and unique. As a tourist I just wanted to AZ gear. Not much to choose from. Customer service was good. Helpful.",UNK
4604,"Great food, fast service, no efficient organization on faxed orders or online ordering. Keep up the great work though!!",UNK
4605,"I love this place. It's not \""Little Italy\"" or the Bronx in New York, but it's great fun and the food is more than enjoyable, with a strong menu and fine service.",UNK
4606,These guys have the best scallops I've tasted in a landlocked area! I don't know how they do it. House Noodles with Scallops is a must try!!,UNK
4607,"I've only been there once but I'll defiantly being going back again. We ordered the satay, eggplant curry and pad Thai and everything was excellent; great taste and cooked perfectly. Nice chill atmosphere and comfortable space and outdoor donning area. Would recommend.",UNK
4608,I usually go here for lunch. Great service. Love the hostes Claudia! :) Great place.,UNK
4609,"Consistently delicious, fresh and flavorful; a long time favorite in a town with many restaurants to choose from. Much more of a local favorite than a tourist spot.",UNK
4610,The arroz pon collo was a great dish! The plates full of chicken and veggies to fill you up! Make sure to ask for the soft shells to go with it!,UNK
4611,The service was quick and satisfactory. I order a swordfish steak that was dry and no flavor. I believe they can do a better job with the seafood.,UNK
4612,They have MADELEINES!!!!! I love these things and have not been get them at the 4 other Starbucks I go to. Until now.,UNK
4613,This was so bad everyone in the wedding party visiting got up half way through. I go to comedy shows regularly and I have seen local opening acts that held my attention better. Save your $! Don't waste your time!,UNK
4614,Hands down the best place in town for your bikes. The mechanics are excellent and they are always willing to help you out with anything you need.,UNK
4615,The restaurant is beautiful and the service is just OK.  The food is nothing special and I don't see any reason to choose this restaurant again.,UNK
4616,"This Walmart has it all. Groceries, garden, ammunition, nail salon, pharmacy, etc. It's huge and a great one stop shop. Great prices of course! \n\nPlenty of parking and plenty of cashiers.",UNK
4617,"Great food, terrible service - I recommend it only if your eating TO GO.",UNK
4618,"Flat white and rocky road ... Just what I need on a day like today! Coffee & cake will wash the blues away!  Love the place, atmosphere and the cakes& coffee",UNK
4619,Very very good flavors. Family owned and operated. Gets a little hot during the evening as he sun is setting. I usually get the 2 chicken enchiladas and my wife has the veggie tacos. Top 3 Mexican food behind leticias.,UNK
4620,"For an ex-pat from San Francisco, this was a huge find.  A big Asian grocery store with a Mexican section?  Dream.  It has a ton of Asian sauces, spices and snacks for great prices.  It also has super cheap produce and a variety of other basics.",UNK
4621,"This place is the best. It's worth the price, why not invest in your health? Food tastes great and everyone there is awesome, I basically live at here.",UNK
4622,The best of everything. Really. The best poker room. The best waitresses. The best blackjack dealers and tables. Enough said.,UNK
4623,Love their lemon pepper & hot n juicy shrimp. Good size restaurant only waited 20mins for seating.,UNK
4624,"I grew up in Northern NJ, and I consider myself somewhat of a pizza snob. Pizzeria Bianco deserves its high rating - the pizza was great.",UNK
4625,Do not order a mixed drink. When asked if there was alcohol the female bartender said that is how she was told to make them. Plus had to wait 15 min just to get service at the bar. Hi Fi and Diercks are much much better!,UNK
4626,Absolutely awesome experience. Traveling through on business and decided I needed a new tattoo. Anthony managed to work me in and did a fantastic job. Nice atmosphere with some amazing artwork on display too. I'll be back.,UNK
4627,We went for Friday lunch.\nThe food was of mixed quality. Agreed it;s a different cuisine but not worth the two hours( yes you read that right )  wait we had to do.,UNK
4628,The portion sizes are pretty big.  Definitely recommend the junior salad if you aren't a huge eater.  Service was great and the staff seemed very knowledgeable.  All the ingredients looked fresh and I love the variety of options.,UNK
4629,"Very reasonable priced las Vegas buffet.  Food is above average nothing impressive but can't complain with price.  Great customer service, were accommodating with special dietary restrictions.",UNK
4630,Well looks like I wasn't the only one that didn't care for  this place....Since it's now closed,UNK
4631,"To be honest, I was disappointed. Maybe because I have high expectation since the lines are so long and waiting time is miserable. \n\nThe environment is nice but the choices are too limited. Some food are really salty.\n\nWill not eat again next time.",UNK
4632,"Great atmosphere but the Happy Hour menu was very limited...probably the shortest list I have seen by far. The Sangria was all right...could be better. Bruchetta was really amazing though! Will most likely give it another chance, either for lunch or dinner next time.",UNK
4633,"If you love authentic street tacos, this place is a must try!  Their enchiladas are also awesome and the carne asada is fantastic too.  If you're going for lunch during the week, I would recommend calling in your order.  They are usually very busy during that time.",UNK
4634,"Happily surprised!   The food was fast and fresh. The service was GREAT!   The owner knows quite a few people by name and greets them as they come in.  Everyone that works the counter is very nice, didn't expect this level of service.   We will be back!",UNK
4635,They have a good selection of shoes at a decent price. But customer service is really lacking. Every time I go in there I wait at least 35 mins before I get helped. Wish they had better customer service. They put on good runs on third Thursdays. But will not buy anything there.,UNK
4636,"This place is amazing!! Best meal I have had in awhile. Started with empanadas which were awesome, had beef short rib for entree which was delicious, and key lime pie for dessert.. Very impressed with food and our server was great too. Will definitely be back!!",UNK
4637,Fun spot!  The beer was decent and the service was wonderful!  They also have mixed drinks for those who don't like beer.  There is a TV and a nice outdoor area looking towards the gardens.,UNK
4638,The sole employee working there was very sweet and helpful.  The store looked very clean but the selection of popcorn was wanting.  I have been to the Popcorn Girl many times and am a fan.  This place is smaller and actually more expensive.,UNK
4639,Awesome food! Great Service.,UNK
4640,Awesome yogurt bar!!!!! Put everything on it!!!!,UNK
4641,Great value and convenient location.  \nClean\nHelpful and friendly staff\nQuick check in/out\nNice fitness facility,UNK
4642,Very basic theater. Seats are uncomfortable and sound quality isn't all that great.,UNK
4643,"Great atmosphere.  Nice mexican food can be hard to pull off.  Javiers does it right.  Great margaritas, great service, great food.  Best Mexican place I have been in vegas.  Great for a fun night out.",UNK
4644,"An enormous place that has everything you could possibly want. I give this hotel four stars only because the Adventuredome indoor theme park, the hotels main draw was closed.",UNK
4645,This is good stuff no doubt. Same guys as Slidn Thru so you know the \nservice is great and the food will be original and BOMB!!,UNK
4646,"Super sympa, simple et tr\u00e8s bon. Un petit resto \u00e0 ajouter \u00e0 votre carnet d'adresse!!!",UNK
4647,The hubby and I both love going to the $5 classes. The instructors are very good and motivating. I like how each instructor directs the classes differently so you are not getting the same flow each time. The lavender towel at the end of the class is worth all the pain :),UNK
4648,"This is the regular hotel I stay whenever biz take me to Vegas. Just another Holliday Inn express. Internet sometime spotty, some room are not maintenance well. Overall it is clean, quite, free breakfast.",UNK
4649,"Terrible food that made me sick. Awful service. And oddly enough, I got the same interaction regarding \""sides\"" that others have posted here.",UNK
4650,"Quite frankly, this place is incredibly mediocre. I had pretty awful service when I went last (Restaurant was half full yet I got no water refill). Sushi Express has better asian food than Fugu and at a much cheaper price.",UNK
4651,Los Tacos is authentic mexican food!!!  loved love love it:)\nFab late night snack!,UNK
4652,Honest service. Hard workers. They won't try n upsell you like Parker n sons.,UNK
4653,"They were awesome! Showed up early, friendly, quick, and did a great job. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!",UNK
4654,Favorite BBQ place !! Love love,UNK
4655,It's a small chain that does a good job of being a chain.  We did have fun there and enjoyed our food.,UNK
4656,"from the moment we checked service was fantastic and not because I am platinum marriott member. from the bellman, to the valet, room service great service. the upgrade was nice too",UNK
4657,"good food, but horrible customer service experience with the manager left me and my wife completely disgusted with this place.. never going back if it were the last place on earth serving food.",UNK
4658,"Dr. Sadowski and his staff are great. They are very inclusive and respectful of all families, stay up to date with current technology and best practices. For those without dental insurance they will still treat you and work out payment plans.",UNK
4659,"I am so disgusted that there was a used condom on the ground at the entrance. Even after telling a store associate, it was still on the ground before I left.",UNK
4660,"I love this place. Meats and spices and veggies, all cooked how I like them. I often do gluten free, and often feel picky and stingy when asking servers to alter stuff and its nice having it my way from the get go.",UNK
4661,"Good food, friendly service, reasonable prices make this a definite 4 star.  Great outdoor seating location.",UNK
4662,Slow....ice coffee in a soda paper cup?  Western omelet on a salted bagel...not so good.  Had much better bagels.  Safe to say I won't be coming back here for breakfast.,UNK
4663,Great Salsa!!!!  The service is okay but the bartenders are great!  Good carnitas.,UNK
4664,The service here is amazing! Robert the manager is always super nice&makes my cream exactly the way I like it. Nick is super awesome! I highly recommend this DQ!,UNK
4665,"Yum lennys. This one is not my preferred Lennys location, but still decent. The inside could use some updating and so could the menu.",UNK
4666,"The valley isn't known for its \""mom and pop restaurants\"" or \""Dives\"" as I affectionately call them but this place was spot on a great place to eat. I'm looking forward to trying their breakfast items.",UNK
4667,Extremely good Mexican food! Ordered michelada and shrimp cocktail. Super bomb! Helps recover from hangovers and super good! I always come here now just for that! Must try!,UNK
4668,"Properly priced and great food.  I can eat there for less than 20 bucks and leave full and happy.  Great job, and the belt full of sushi is fun to watch and anticipate what item will come next!!!",UNK
4669,"A tad pricy, average portions, but it's the best chinese food I've had in the states of Pennsylvania and Michigan",UNK
4670,"I love this place. Old time dive. This is a place where everyone will know your name! Food is great. Amy, Ben, and Matt are amazing so is the rest of the staff!!! Awesome happy hour deals that can't be beat!!!",UNK
4671,"I personally Love Panera their food is different and tasty, Love the steak sandwich at breakfast, Frozen caramels are delicious and staff is great!",UNK
4672,Worse place ever! These are college kids that burn the food or do not cook it right. They don't pay attention to your order either. It is gross! If I could give them less then one star I would!,UNK
4673,"They do great work, were reasonable priced and were able to diagnose the problem pretty quickly.  I will use them again for my other vehicles.",UNK
4674,Seriously worth the wait! Best burger ever!,UNK
4675,"No, just no.  So dirty, always out of soap and paper towels. Only meat heads that care about other meat heads. Terrible account management as well. Doesn't even deserve a star.",UNK
4676,"Excellent, fast, inexpensive. Plain old good Mexican Food. I would drive across town for it, but if you live in the vicinity it's a must have.",UNK
4677,"I had the sweet and spicy chicken, and loved it! This place is somewhat expensive, but you get a lot of food for the price.",UNK
4678,"Wide beer selection, but not a lot of rare/unique ones. Good food, but overpriced. No sound for NFL games was kind of a bummer.",UNK
4679,"A pretty good Pizza, I live near the North Cheyenne location, but think the South Eastern store s better. Try them both and decide for yourself",UNK
4680,Totally worth risking standing on line in the cold. Buy tickets in advance online. Also bring student ID for a discounted ticket. Really enjoyed the Chinese garden.,UNK
4681,Just went there at 11pm on a sunday and they said they were closing because they weren't busy.  3 hours early and nothing else open in plaza midwood.,UNK
4682,Dirty. \n\nPlenty to look at....,UNK
4683,"Easily the worst \""burrito\"" I have ever had.\nIt amazes my that anyone would choose to eat at this chain. I bet the rations they serve from the back of UN trucks to refugees is better.",UNK
4684,Be patient.  It's a nice airport but it does get chaotic.  Scheduling seems to be random and gates get really busy with flights leaving right next to or across from one another.,UNK
4685,"Just like predicted, Business is closed",UNK
4686,"Always fresh tasting, flavorful and hot pizza. For $5 you can't beat this deal with a stick, it IS that good! Their customer service is top-notch and make you feel welcome in their little storefront. Great food, great people and definitely 5 stars.",UNK

4688,"Great happy hour, the fish and chips are excellent!",UNK

4690,The friendliest service and the best and freshest tasting sub sandwhiches I ever had. This place is better than Subway. I will continue to come every time I'm in town. Thank you so much!!!,UNK
4691,"WHY do some people recommend this place?  It took a long time to get to order, the4 food was not particularly special nor reasonable, and it was so noisy that we could hardly talk.  NOPE..will not go back there.",UNK
4692,I would have to say this is one of my favorite spots to eat at. The curry is absolutely amazing and delicious. Check them out it will be worth your time everything there is fresh and the people are very nice.,UNK
4693,"The service is terrible. The food is only decent. The only reason I could ever see coming back here would be for the beer, and quite frankly, I'd rather drive across town to the Tenaya Creek Brewery. I can say I won't be a return customer",UNK
4694,Great show and talent!  I love the theater too!  No bad seats in the house.,UNK
4695,great place and great team!!,UNK
4696,"always a lot of fun to see all the wealthy & glamorous people shopping. a little out of my budget but we love the fish aquarium, the king neptune show and all the beautiful people.",UNK

4698,"Loved my nails and was in and out in no time:) walking distance in Old Town, loved it!  Professional and lots of style selection, I did cherry red with silver tips:)",UNK
4699,Much better than streets of New York and there wings are the best I go there all the time,UNK
4700,"While in town hopped the bus down to this mall, and I can say it as a waste of time.  Walked end to end nothing caught our interesting, and the food court was not very inviting ether, we left with nothing and have never been back.",UNK
4701,"My first LGA experience...won't be back unless someone begs me. Omelette was served cold, too busy to care what the plate looked like and no silverware clean. The place was packed. Why?",UNK
4702,They are closed!\n Was bummed because I saw all the positive reviews!\n\n\nEnded up next door at Skewer's and had a great meal.,UNK
4703,"It's nice place! Whenever i found chance, i go there for dinner or lunch. Tasty food quality. I recommend it to all my group friend.",UNK
4704,"If you are trying to decide what charity is most worthy of your contributions, donate to Gracie's Cottage.  Come see for yourself how this thrift store does everything from supporting the local community to supporting missionaries around the world.",UNK
4705,"Come to Studio 54 if you're 40+ or like people who are 40+. \n\nSmall, cramped and devoid of any attractive people. And let me remind you, I'm drunk and it's dark, yet, my opinion still stands.",UNK
4706,"Great food, great service, great HH. Don't go too often though.",UNK
4707,Was traveling through on business- they were able to see me on short notice. Friendly staff and a terrific hair cut!,UNK
4708,Can't even get anyone on the phone. Left two messages - still no call back. Guess I'll be spending my money elsewhere!,UNK
4709,"Horrible service. Wish I could have given it a zero. We waited an hour for our food, no one addressed the wait and I was charged for something that never arrived.",UNK
4710,"Really overpriced, 6 or 7$ for 4 gyozas made of beans. Took over an hour to be seated even with a reservation. Ran out of 2 of our dishes and didn't even bother to tell us. Took over 50 minutes to bring our food.",UNK
4711,"Overrated and underwhelming.  The place is messy like a Walmart on Boxing Day.  The brand names are scarce.  Not what I expected.  Sure it's crowded because it just recently opened, but they could have done much better.",UNK
4712,"Sandwich and plantains were both good choices, but I thought the Aji sauce, a green chili sauce, was great. Loved the kick with the plantains.",UNK
4713,pay the musicians what is agreed upon. this sort of uncool practices spread fast and furiuos1,UNK
4714,"this place has gone down hill , everything taste bland, go to archies instead . it is worth the drive",UNK
4715,"I can see their goal to put some Chinese elements into theater art. However, the customs really need to rework and the script and the entire choreography need some serious work as well. They literally wasted all the performers' talents and it is a pity.",UNK
4716,I love weiners! The pastrami is pretty good too!,UNK
4717,It all tasted the way a $6.99 buffet would taste. So...I can't really complain lol. But not coming back.,UNK
4718,"This Walmart was just like any other walmart, except, the employees were extremely rude and not helpful at all. I will no longer be going to this walmart, I will drive the extra miles to another walmart for the smiles and friendly help!!!",UNK
4719,The wait staff were very friendly! The lunch specials are big portions! Two could easily share! Sweet n sour chicken and Cream cheese wontons were excellent! I would definitely eat here again!,UNK
4720,Paid $13 for a Reuben with a salad. It was okay. It did not make me want to go back. Next time I park in the schlotsky's I will go there as badly as I hate giving m money to chains.,UNK
4721,I would give them 5 stars if they had better chips BUT their food is great them accommodate our vegetarian needs. The place is clean. I have dined in both the bar and restaurant area and both rock. The ElPatron is SO GREAT!,UNK
4722,4:20pm  just walked in and then turned around and left! First time I've ever seen a Paradise Bakery that dirty!,UNK
4723,The room itself was not bad and the prices are pretty good. Unfortunatly the maid service has a lot of room for improvement.  We had dirty towels in our bathroom and the general cleaning of said room was poor at best!,UNK
4724,Pool was incredibly crowded and drinks are pricey. Music was good and drinks take awhile.... Be prepared,UNK
4725,"For the past few years we have loved this restaurant, however customer service has not been the best. Its time to find another sushi place. Not interested anymore. If the owner doesn't care about customer service why the sushi chefs care! BAD SERVICE!!",UNK
4726,Had a great time.  Upbeat music while playing video poker.  Great people watching!,UNK
4727,"Great little place! Food is good quality at an affordable price. The fried rice is excellent! Better than some of the more expensive places around the strip! Family dinner with soup, fried won tons, 2 entrees and fried rice was more than enough for a family of 3 at a reasonable prices.",UNK
4728,"Worst service ever! Don't waste your time at this location it sucks and the servers act like they are too cool and emo to serve with any sort of personality.. Food is always good but it's not even worth it , just go to a different location",UNK
4729,Great food and great service. I will definitely come back \nStrongly recommend this place,UNK
4730,"Great service, and great people.",UNK
4731,"This place is just a cool pub to hangout. Its a good place to get out, grab a couch, some beer and wings and catch the game! \nDefinately two thumbs up!!",UNK

4736,"Decent food. I try hard to like bagels more, but maybe i should just give up. Service here is hit or miss.",UNK
4737,Never order for delivery!! Ordered and they never showed up. Don't know how the food taste because I never received it.,UNK
4738,"There are three lines for different meats. Carne Asada tacos not worth the wait, BUT the AL PASTOR are worth the wait!!",UNK
4739,This Hawaiian themed burger joint was ok. They have some Hawaiian style dishes & a wide variety of burger toppings. The food was pretty good but the service was very poor. Waiting 10 minutes plus just to get drink refills or more napkins is not cool.,UNK
4740,Their happy hour prices are amazing for wines! We had the half sandwiches with soup and it was really fresh and light. Okay service but the atmosphere is so easy and comfortable!,UNK
4741,"Molly was a fantastic server! Never had to ask for anything, always refilled out drinks and made sure we were taken care of! We will definitely be coming back & requesting her as our server!!",UNK
4742,"Solid pizza considering this is Las Vegas. For a Chicago chef I expected more, but definitely a better alternative to Grimaldis.",UNK
4743,margarita...WHAT??  give me some!!!,UNK
4744,"Very limited selection. This is a smaller Walmart location. Cashiers are nice, but very over worked. Out of the 19 or so check stands, there are 3-4 open on average. Lines are horrible to checkout.",UNK
4745,"This church was amazing, the priest and choir was on point. It's a good church to go to when you're looking for a mass to attend and to go to that's closer to the strip.",UNK
4746,"The service was good, but the food not.  You pay for the view.  Go to SF for a real restaurant",UNK
4747,Nice old school diner feel. Good food and service. We were pretty lucky to walk in and get seated with no problem. The place was hopping the whole time we were there.\n\nJust another of so many great eateries in Tempe.,UNK
4748,Microwaved food over over over seasoned gyro meet horrible food and very expensive. There are much better Greek restaurants ..,UNK
4749,it's nice to have a BBQ place that serves beer in our area. and it's open late which is awesome. Mac and cheese is awesome and so is the cornbread. fast friendly service. the BBQ sauce was a bit salty but very good all-around.,UNK
4750,Amazing Italian food... The owner and son make the service friendly and great for families or a couples night out...\n\nMy favorite is veal parm & wife loves about 10 different meals!!\n\nMust go!!,UNK
4751,Awesome custard!!! The best in Las Vegas. Make sure to bring cash. They do not take debt or credit cards.,UNK

4753,Outstanding food. Extremely friendly and helpful staff. Very clean and modern looking. I highly recommend you try this new establishment out.,UNK
4754,"A great place to find the gift for the hard to buy for person. I could also find lots of thing for the not so hard to buy for, myself!!! Great staff and wonderful place to shop!",UNK
4755,"Freddy fixed an issue with my hot water tank and everything works great.  I found his service to be reliable, affordable and quick.  I felt like he knew his work well and that I can trust his opinion and guidance.  Would definitely work with again!",UNK
4756,"Not to bad of a spot. A bit on the price side but the food and sushi is good  full bar with out side seating. Happy Hour is nice, a good selection of items.",UNK
4757,Delicious food exceptional food especially on a cold day or for that matter any day for spicy miso soup so good  The price is right would recommend this to all my friends,UNK
4758,"Daily specials! Kitschy holiday decor this time of year (Bucky's wearing a santa hat!). Love to sit by the \""window\"" into the bar. Friendly patrons, always end up striking up conversations with others! Looks like they also serve pizza.",UNK
4759,"Good selection of beer, nice waitresses and challenging but very fun \""live\"" trivia on Thursdays at 7p.m. We go with a group... good times!  Only suggestion would be for them to expand their appetizer menu.",UNK
4760,Too slow. Dish tastes so so.,UNK
4761,Customer service is slow and lacking. I can't recommend anyone staying here. Pay a little more and get a place where people actually care.,UNK

4764,Excellent traditional Mayan cuisine! We found this place on Yelp and loved it!! We will definitely come back. The cochinita pibil enchiladas were delicious!!,UNK
4765,"Our noodles were more on the uncooked side. The food had some taste , but I wouldn't come here again.",UNK
4766,"The rooftop bar is great for drinks but I wouldn't say it's worth the wait if busy. Their menu is limited and if you ate vegetarian, there is not nearly anything to sample from. Drinks ok. Meh.",UNK
4767,Fresh ingredients and authentic atmosphere set this place apart for Pho. #18 was excellent and the regular size was plenty,UNK
4768,It's alright. The frozen chocolate is not worth $11. Tastes like chocolate milk and they put whip cream on it. Service is slow as hell. 2 stars.,UNK
4769,Great food and service!! I can't get enough of the steak chili! our server was always smiling and my beer was always full! she never forgot anything and didn't even flinch when she was asked for chop sticks by our sugar buzzed teenager!!,UNK
4770,go just to say that you've gone..\n\nwe had no lines / no cover - dj was cool - dancefloor was packed. \nkinda small and feels cramped\n\ntake me back to xs asap,UNK
4771,The meat dishes like lamb kebab & chicken 65 we're not that great. \nPaneer tikka masala. Plenty of gravy but only 8 cubes paneer. Chana masala was ok. Naan was fresh & soft.,UNK
4772,A little pricey and the service lacked a bit. But super fresh and delicious. Will go back but hopefully with a better server.,UNK
4773,"Great BBQ, Love taking the family to this place. Ribs fall of the bone and are So good. Glad its close to home.",UNK

4775,"Very poor service, very poor cocktails and they don't care.",UNK
4776,"Been coming in for breakfast and lunch multiple time a month (be sure to pick up their customer appreciation cards, buy 8 get 1 free) for breakfast and lunch. The freshly baked bread is awesome and the menu is solid. Gotta give it a five and go back tomorrow.",UNK
4777,"Went here tonight. I bought an ocean blue goblet. It was decent definitely not worth the $36 dollars. Decent place, just extremely pricey.",UNK
4778,Here is a recipe for success:  take the two worst airlines in the industry and merge them together.  What do you think you get?  One colossal airline that completely sucks,UNK
4779,"This place and other local spots like the Teepee remind us of a far gone time when our Mexican food was predictable and when our standards were low.  But sometimes that hits the spot.  This place definitely has some history, just ask Marty Robbins.",UNK
4780,"The serving is good, but the steak dinner is not that good, also the sauce for the fried squid is strange.......",UNK
4781,"Great Greek Salad!  Nice server but seemed like she was the only one in the place. Poor girl. Everyone raved about the NY style wings, but I thought thy were average.",UNK

4783,"BEST Donuts on the face of the earth, make sure you bring CASH!  They don't take cards......     These donuts are to die for!",UNK
4784,"I had both my sons through doctors here. Neither births were positive experiences although my sons are happy and healthy. Pediatricians upstairs are grand. Obgyn, not so much.",UNK
4785,"Worst customer service I have ever experienced in my entire life. I never write reviews but after this experience, I thought it my duty to warn future patrons. Never will I ever come back...not even if the food was free.",UNK
4786,"Felt like I was smoking hookah in my garage. Horrible decor, mediocre hookah. Definitely better options in the surrounding area. Our server was difficult to understand.",UNK
4787,Beautiful place - large campus - pricey - but it is a Biltmore,UNK
4788,"My husband and I found this place by accident last night. We went out to do something else and ended up here. We found their wine to be wonderful, the service was fantastic and we even met some new people we hope to see again. Can't wait to go back!",UNK

4790,"Clean fun casino with a hearty buffet. Well-priced and good food. Recommended as a dependable buffet, especially for a casual lunch.",UNK
4791,Best food in Anthem. Been going here for years and food has been consistently delicious. These folks take pride in what they do and it shows! I hope someday they open a bigger place. Yum!,UNK
4792,"I visited their new location in The Village (1654 rue Sainte-Catherine East) and experienced the most terrible dining ever.  S L O W service, mixed-up orders, miniscule portions, exorbitant prices.  There is no reason to ever eat here.",UNK
4793,This is the single best fried chicken on the planet. The only thing missing is the bulletproof glass.,UNK
4794,"Love this place, always get cupcakes there. My favorites are any thing with cherries. All so good. They are rich and really good if you need something sweet. We always get birthday cakes and holiday cakes there every year for the past probably six years.",UNK
4795,Excellent service and excellent entertainment was only topped by the unreal bone in fillet!! Possibly the best steak I have ever had!!,UNK
4796,I had a rubber band in my baked potato yuk so disgusting. It was from either sombodies hair or who knows . Never going back,UNK
4797,The bartender was very rude. I asked him to fix a drink that was bad and he told he wouldn't fix it that I should just get something else. The server wasn't really sure what was on happy hour. No manager was alerted about my disservice.,UNK
4798,"This is one of our favorite shows in Vegas! There is so much going on, you can watch it numerous times and find something new every time. All seats are great! This is definitely a must!",UNK
4799,Horrible service.    Tried to call number and all it does is ring then goes to fax line.    Terrible place to go,UNK
4800,This is a sorority ran facility. I was uncomfortable the majority of the time I was there. Lots of pool tables is nice. The clientele is all male and I'm not surprised with the staff they have. I will not go back to this Baileys/Fox and the Hound.,UNK
4801,Good burgers and convenient. Can't complain!,UNK
4802,Spazzmatics bring their A game! I absolutely  love these guys and can't wait to watch them again.,UNK
4803,i usually order the skirt steak with fries.  it's usually good but once in a while the meat is lower quality.  the chimichurri is fantastic and the local beer is good.,UNK
4804,Great pizza but the service is horrible had to wait 20 mins after my stated early delivery time and they acted like it was no big deal. Great pizza and wings service is poor,UNK
4805,"What a fun show - I was a little skeptical because of the price and the small venue, but it was everything you want in a vegas show: comedy, stunts, and good production values.  Worth every penny.",UNK
4806,Such a fun place for kids and parents both.  Great place to make gifts or just to have fun.  So fun.,UNK
4807,"The staff is incredibly rude. I pay $20 dollars a month to go here and I am treated like a child. Half the equipment does not work properly. The changing areas are nice though, I will give them that. I would take my business elsewhere. No customer service here whatsoever.",UNK
4808,This is a great place!  We got protein bowls with steak. So good!  The portions are large. We sat outside & people watched while we ate !,UNK
4809,"Negativo,  I guess that they are good if you like hard, stale donut with no flavor, If you want  a good donut just make the trip to BOSA on Glendale....",UNK
4810,we were hoping for more of a sushi restaurant but this is much more of a fish restaurant.  the sushi was good but the nigri was expensive compared to other places we have been.  with all the other choices out there - we probably won't be back.,UNK
4811,Hotel is decently nice itself but the staff being terrible greatly detracts.,UNK
4812,3rd time in for a slice and disappointed each time.  Single stale lukewarm pizza slice for nearly $6.00.  Pizza looks promising if you get a whole fresh pie. No idea what anything costs because prices aren't posted. Unlikely to return unless drunk.,UNK
4813,"I only ordered the hummus and pita here, so this review is based on that.  The hummus was incredibly fresh and tasty.  I could eat it all day long.  I want to return to try some of their other stuff.  Not much here besides the food though, very regular looking place.",UNK
4814,Wasn't thrilled.   The Bacchanal is wayyyyu better.    The dessert section here is half the size.  The drinks tasted funny.  Maybe chlorine.  Idk.   We left not feeling full.   Waited for drinks and had to go ask.,UNK
4815,Amazing hash! If you are looking for a friendly local breakfast or brunch diner then search no further. This place serves excellent food at reasonable prices. They are head and shoulders above that hash house a no no chain.,UNK
4816,"food is ok, but service is very slow!",UNK
4817,"Pizza Hut never tastes the same. This location tasted unusually different. The best Pizza Hut is in anthem highlands. Next time I'm in the mood for pizza, I'll be going to them.",UNK
4818,Just saw the Sexy Sheena Easton in the South Piont show room. My  sugar walls will never be the same. Every seat is a great seat. Had a great  time.,UNK

4820,Awesome. Great food. Lil commercial but I'm still satisfied. Me and my sister got the California burritos. Just a slight bit different then the ones back home were used to. Other than that. A plus,UNK
4821,This place is great to enjoy drinks in a nice quiet atmosphere (patio area). Love coming with friends & catching up.,UNK
4822,just ok....,UNK
4823,Great place to stay for fans of Frank Lloyd Weight or Art Deco Architecture. The grounds are beautiful and there are many restaurants on the campus and nearby. There are many different types of rooms with differing views and styles and prices. I've eaten at the restaurants which I've liked as well.,UNK
4824,I love this place for a quick teriyaki. I disagree w/ others who say its expensive I think it was right on track...Combo meat veggie bowl is my fav and their spring rolls are GREAT~,UNK
4825,There was poor selection of foods.\nThe quality of foods was just low.\nIt is not worth to pay $30.00 plus at all.,UNK
4826,its pretty good food tastes very fresh and fast delivery with easy online ordering its a good price and i have leftovers,UNK
4827,Roach spotted in ladies room closest to the Big Seafood Buffet. YUK!,UNK

4829,"We use to come with all our friends for their steak special but we were really disappointed the last few times we came.  Never mind the service is slow, the food was not worth the wait.",UNK
4830,DO NOT lease from here. Sent me to collections before even coming to me about the issue. Received the large collections notice four months later and the day before my wedding. I sent multiple emails and never heard back from management after I moved out. BEWARE of scumbags,UNK
4831,I am not a big fan of sushi. There food is okay here I will only go if my friends are going but the service is so so bad. If it weren't for my friends I would never go there again.,UNK
4832,"Catfish, Mac-N-Cheese with Callard Greens and a side of laughter.   The people at Mario's make you feel like your part of the family.  Only three tables inside, so you might want to get it to go but it's worth it.",UNK
4833,Always come here for the good food and friendly staff.\n\nGet the Ultimate bagel sandwich with crispy bacon. Non nom nom nom,UNK
4834,Date night! We sat at a choice table to enjoy the sunset. Always great food and drinks.,UNK
4835,"Terrible food, ended up throwing it out and buying snacks in the store next door. Rolled tacos looked store bought, cheese wasn't even melted on the food.",UNK
4836,"Hummus is very good. Not a place you'd want to \""go out\"" for dinner but great for a quick bite to eat. Would go there again.",UNK
4837,"They had crab legs, sushi, longan, escargot and frog legs!!!  It don't get any more hardcore than that!",UNK
4838,"The food is great !! Service sucks, they sit you down, get your drinks and then forget about you. Tip order take out...food is ready when they say it is.",UNK
4839,"Usually Have a great experience but the last time was awful! The host was very rude and our server Jeffrey was slow and sarcastic (in a bad way) the food is always great, but over all dealing with the staff was not worth it!",UNK
4840,The Room was way too small for my big ass...the casino was nice though.,UNK
4841,"Staff is fantastic, food is great. The best place to watch a game and drink great beers with very good food.",UNK
4842,There's tons of parking and this is close to where I live the hike is not amazing but its near west phx and the parking lot is big and safe. Not much to see but you can see it off the freeway and its really near the exit. You can mountain bike here.,UNK
4843,"The service is very friendly. You'd think coming in at midnight people might be grumpy, but the service was very nice! Cute little spot with yummy options :)",UNK
4844,A cozy family friendly breakfast spot. Reasonably prices and excellent food. Banana nut muffins are delicious. Staff is very friendly.,UNK
4845,Great menu and service.  Sweet breads were fantastic.,UNK
4846,"This is a great sports bar. Super comfortable booths, easy access to watching TV. Very good food. We had the chicken soup, burgers, appetizers and a grilled ham sandwich. Everything was great, very good service too. Will definitely be going back.",UNK

4848,Rushed my manicure and did the shaping wrong. It started cracking the next day. Won't be back.,UNK
4849,"It has a great area for kids, plus free circus act shows. If you aren't traveling with kids, then I cannot recommend this casino. It smelled and no one came around with drinks the whole time we were playing craps and blackjack. The place is in serious need of cleaning and renovation.",UNK
4850,"Love the drinks, food, atmosphere.",UNK
4851,"Great place!  Very reasonably priced.  Big, beautiful rooms.  Comfy beds.  Quiet.  And great restaurants and shopping surrounding it.  I would go back in a heart beat.",UNK
4852,I still hit up u swirl every now and then.  I agree that it is a little overpriced for frozen yogurt.  I usually only get the yogurt though since the fruit toppings don't look too appealing.,UNK
4853,I have never felt better int life then after a day at this spa. No more little old Chinese ladies will be touching this body again.,UNK
4854,"I love this venue, but lately cosmo has more shows. So until they get indie bands to play here, I'll be at cosma. Plus cosmo has free concerts at book and stage.",UNK
4855,Not my choice to go to usually. I dislike the service and selection here. Seems like the quality and service has gone down over the years.,UNK
4856,"Love this place - a must stop every time I am in the greater PHX area on business.\nSean and Elena in the bar are the best!!! Food is great, atmosphere even better after work and for games. Try the Scotch Eggs - a real treat.",UNK
4857,The yogurt is very good. They make their own flavors I now know. The service and friendliness and neighborhood personal feel is so great. Have loved this place for years now and it just keeps getting better every time I go in.,UNK
4858,Literally waited an hour and half to get service. Food was decent but not for $50 a plate. Very dissapointed,UNK

4860,Lux is like being taught physics by Sir Isaac Newton.,UNK
4861,Used to dine here a lot. Food is good but the rudeness of the owner Don makes this a no go. He should not take his unhappiness out on the customers,UNK
4862,"Good chicken sandwich and burgers.......but I will never wait an hour for lunch again. I would understand if the place was packed, but four tables were seated when we arrived. Again, good food but expect a long wait.",UNK
4863,fast and tasty...............delivery driver Bryce was a sweet heart!,UNK
4864,"Brunch at Graze did not disappoint!  The Nutella French toast with apples was superb as was the cheese curds and the open, clean atmosphere.",UNK
4865,Our party of 4 enjoyed a very nice table with Sean as our waiter. The warm olives and potato chips were excellent appetizers. I enjoyed my recommended filet mignon au poivre. Two others enjoyed the bolognaise. Overall a good choice for dinner.,UNK
4866,After a crappy visit here the manager contacted me to invite me back and send me a gift card. I am still looking for my gift card 3 months later. I tried to email the manager with no response what a shitty establishment!,UNK
4867,"Everything is so fresh here. One of our favorite sushi places in Las Vegas. The service is pretty good, sometimes you'll wait a bit to see your server during times. I would have done 5 stars but they don't offer any military discounts, so 4 stars is still good!",UNK
4868,Service is not too good.  Food is okay but not great.,UNK
4869,"Meh. The bread was cold, the bean dip it's served with was cold, the mushroom dish that was described as served over risotto was served over cold orzo. Didn't knock my socks off.",UNK
4870,Pretty good combination pizza. Always see the same regulars here.. Awkward $1 extra for to go orders.. Lol  nice bartenders,UNK
4871,"One of the better night clubs I've been to in vegas! The dj rocks!  I loved the music. Drinks were fine, but pricey. It's a kind of classier club, which was still fun but there's a few snobby people.",UNK
4872,"Buffet is OK, but not great. \nBetter choices in town. \nIf you insist on going, show up early evening to avoid a line.",UNK
4873,Food was way overpriced for the taste. Beans overcooked. Tortillas seemed stale. Server was horrible. Avoid this place. Dont waste ur $. Sorry bout iiiiit.,UNK
4874,"Terry and her crew are the best, i loove how they make you feel like family every one is so welcome and super energetic, I'm on week two and i can already feel the difference, they know how you body works and adjust the work out for you! Best place hands down!",UNK
4875,So so food. Had to send back a sandwich twice. But they were very nice about it. I agree with who ever posted the comment a few weeks ago about them putting up stickers blighting the neighborhood on street signs and light poles.,UNK
4876,Burned a pair of beautiful leather shoes to a crisp . Every other shoe shine since shocked & disgusted with their stupid flame idea !,UNK
4877,Way more Hype than quality and taste.,UNK
4878,Not a great job and mows with guards up.  Damaged my car and then denied it and started cussing.  Unprofessional and Rude and not very good landscape service.  I to wish they had a 0 star.,UNK
4879,"Cute place, nice decor, great bathrooms, coffee is alright too.  Nice staff.  Dirt parking though, and I get that it's Cave Creek but still, some of us like to have clean cars.  This is a necessary stop on a trip up to Cave Creek.",UNK
4880,They offer a happy hour from 5pm to 6:45pm but when we arrived at 5:15pm they were booked until 9pm even though no one was in the restaurant. I'll post a photo of the empty restaurant. Take your wallet where they care about your business.,UNK
4881,"Wow!! I want to call this Fresh and Fruity (an Ihop knee-jerk reaction)... I just found this place today and truly, it lives up to its namesake: everything is fresh and it really is easy!  Love the self-check out!  Instant fan here!",UNK
4882,Very polite and helpful. Great job and is fast and fair. I highly recommend I have had several clothes worked on and they always turn out great.,UNK

4889,"Awesome, definitely coming back.",UNK
4890,"The food was great. I had the Tryst Benedict and my co-workers had the oatmeal. Our server, Brianna, kept our coffee glasses full at all times and was overall fantastic! I'll definite come back when I come back to visit.",UNK
4891,Terrible customer service. Did you not read the sign on my door that said no soliciting??,UNK
4892,"The food was very disappointed..$39.99 for buffet, you would of thought the food would be great.  I was extremely disappointed with the food...very thing seems to be all dried up and over cook.",UNK
4893,"Classy, quiet hotel just off the strip. Room was nice and clean and the staff was very friendly. Would definitely come back!",UNK
4894,It's not that great. Better off to drive 10 more minutes and find a better sushi place. Also it always smells like bad cleaning products.,UNK
4895,"Salad and potato bar for the masses.  Good grief, pay a couple dollars   more for something good.  The mac and cheese looked like it came from a Kraft box.  There is no way I would go back.  Made for big people who want to think they are eating healthy.",UNK
4896,"So bad , using bad chicken which is overdate and tasty like shit. Smell so bad with gongbao chicken.  I promise I will never ever back.",UNK
4897,The coffees here are great but the baked goods are amazing,UNK
4898,"Stayed there on business for my first time in Las Vegas. Room was nice. bowling, movie theater in addition to pool and spa. Buffet was INCREDIBLE!",UNK
4899,"I was there on 10/18/13.  Obviously the kind of reviews it was receiving led to its on downfall.  The place is closed for \""rebranding\"" - and may re-open under a different name in 2014.",UNK
4900,"We got everything we ordered correctly. The fries were super fresh and we have tons of leftovers of them. The little burger is still a big burger, so don't order too big! Staff was friendly and the place was clean.",UNK
4901,"Delivery\nWe all have had the quality of our food minish when it is delivered. \nNot the case with Thailicious. \n\nEasily some of the best Thai food ever, the seafood was so fresh tasting, yum.",UNK
4902,TERRiBLE. \nExpensive. Our 4 year old cost $13. \nFor hour \n\nNot worth it\n\nToilets disgusting and smelly\n\nRip off,UNK
4903,Love the Carnitas!,UNK
4904,The check in woman was a complete c word.  She was too busy with her nappy hair to give a crap about us checking in.   The pina colada was disgusting and gave me the shits.,UNK
4905,We were told the wait was 20 min even though there were 10 empty tables - menu is NOT vegan friendly waitress not helpful with substituting would not recommend or come back,UNK
4906,"First of all... Thank you Alicia for being an amazing bartender! Knew the bar, beer and menu by heart and very friendly. I will definitely come back. Food was great and so were the drinks.",UNK
4907,"Went to get the giant eiffel tower drinks after midnight and ALL the machines were shut down. Typically I wouldn't complain, but this is Vegas they should at least have one machine working. Instead we spent 24 bucks on watered down drinks....",UNK
4908,They have a lot of clothes and good shoes.  Definitely one of the better racks I have been too.,UNK
4909,Bad service at  this location,UNK
4910,They have a great happy hour here.  The popovers are awesome and the burger with jalapenos is a steal at $8.  The escargot are very good but not quite as good as before they changed the recipe.,UNK
4911,Relaxed and warm atmosphere. I didn't try the sandwiches but the patisserie was so delicious,UNK
4912,"The airport is kinda old. There are some charging stations near the restroom. But, they aren't very many. Would be nice to have more outlets.",UNK
4913,"Yummy subs at a good price. The former owners were jerks and would always skimp on the food. The new owners and their employees are friendly, fast, and hook it up.",UNK
4914,Never dining here again no matter how good the food is....My sister got a stomach ache and mild food poisoning from lunch. We had tom yum soup and the mongolian beef. NEVER again!!! SO SAD!,UNK
4915,By far the best juice bar in Pittsburgh.,UNK
4916,Very entertaining!,UNK
4917,what a messy place! If you want to look a good bargain you have to look carefully because everything is chaos! Even Big Lots has more order. Not worth my time.,UNK
4918,"Their Chicken Critter Salad's got game. More portion of chicken than any other chicken salad I've ordered elsewhere.  They have other great entrees, but this cowpoke likes his critters",UNK
4919,simple yet delicious! Relatively inexpensive and the hotcakes are scrumptious! Thanks Pamela,UNK
4920,"It could be nice, but it just wasnt.  The room tried to be modern, but it was cheesy.  The shower was open and built terribly, the room was small and the decorations seemed cheap. The only plus side is its location.",UNK
4921,everytime I come this weekend and its clean and I love the bathroom it smells like candy and the water is warm great customer service quick,UNK
4922,"The bread is awesome. Light on the meat, and the veggies weren't the freshest. Will go back only with a coupon as its costly for a sandwich.",UNK
4923,Why does this place have so many good reviews. The service was slow and not a lot of people were in there for a Saturday night and the burgers were pretty dry and plain. Nothing special at all.,UNK
4924,My husband and I love our sushi and just moved to Vegas. We've eaten at 3 sushi spots and so far this is our favorite. Fish is always fresh. The uni tastes like it just came out of the water. Price is very reasonable. I recommend eating here.,UNK
4925,"Like all outets, it'll be a hit or miss. And it seems Vegas gets the best outlets. The only bad thing about his outlet is it's outdoors. Either you'll be sweating under the hot sun or freezing cold in the winter. Loads of tourists here of course.",UNK
4926,yuck-ey!!\nnever again!!!,UNK
4927,"It's not so bad. It's a budget place. The walkways are pretty dirty though, and the shower a little scuzzy. I've stayed in worse.",UNK
4928,this place sucks... \n\nfood was low quality and really bad service..\nthe McDonalds next door would probably satisfy your needs better than this place.,UNK
4929,"Quick, fresh, lots of salsa choices, and CLOSED\n\nGood little places to get away from the standard fast food.  Likes their salsa bar and services was usually quick.  Sorry to see that they are closed as of around 4/1.",UNK
4930,"Love this place! They offer a great twist on good local made hot dogs. Who needs a bun anyways? Try the the Igby, you can't go wrong.",UNK
4931,"loved it, the experience was amazing, the food was top, simply the chef is amazing cook and the service was really good. Would go back for sure!",UNK
4932,They have great sushi and food. Service is always attentive and friendly. It can get very crowded at night and weekends. The happy hour and late night happy hour deals are super awesome too!,UNK
4933,Affordable & good in taste.\nDidn't like that the cookies had sugar sprayed all across that kind of killed them for me.,UNK
4934,"Good food, good service. More of a bar than restaurant.",UNK
4935,Pretty small theatre... Service was ok,UNK

4937,I love this place!! Every time I go to Vegas I have to get stop here for lunch. They have the best hot pastrami sandwich! Highly recommended!!,UNK

4940,"Went for a quick lunch. Had the 2 beef taco combo with chips and salsa. Salsa was very good, made fresh daily. Tacos, beans and rice were bland. Nice clean place with friendly staff.",UNK
4941,"Nothing impressive, DJ spins the same music like every other DJ around here. They were letting people in wearing tennis shoes and baseball caps. Service was okay, nothing special. First and last time.",UNK
4942,We took our group of 55 students here for dinner and we had a great time.  The staff at Planet Hollywood was attentive and helpful and the food was great!  I'd definitely come back!,UNK
4943,"Very very bad. All of the food was stale and cold. All of the meat/chicken was dry. And the worst of all, I paid $25 for two people. We will never go back there.",UNK
4944,"I have only gone to Carlys on my lunch break and it made me late returning to work. Regardless, I did enjoy my food and time spent there. The waitress seemed a little stressed out, but then again she did have about 10 tables to deal with all at once.",UNK
4945,Really delicious home-made tasting Italian food. The garlic bread is amazing. Wine is pretty good too.,UNK
4946,The cook here us the slowest cook i have ever seen in my life! The Kid was talking the whole time...,UNK
4947,"5 Stars for the Pool Area, best spot in the area! Must check out if you're a tourist and spend a day relaxing.",UNK

4949,"I have been there  a couple times. It's a great place ruined by over priced drinks and food. That and there is limited parking. Their happy hour is a joke, limited to a small section of the restaurant. Service was ok. Overall value is poor.",UNK
4950,I went to this restaurant and I was not that impressed. I ordered the Chilean sea bass and it was quite bland! The happy hour isn't bad but they need to season their food a bit more!,UNK
4951,The service was rude and when I left my car there for nearly two hours they still couldn't manage to get the oil change done by the time they said they would.,UNK
4952,"Dreadful. \n\nBoring, overpriced food, obnoxious servers, and creepy management. Caught the owner lewdly gazing at my girlfriend. Not my favourite dining experience!",UNK
4953,The food wasn't that great- so I'm not a fan - the salad was the only thing worth eating,UNK
4954,I love Gyros and this wasn't the place to get a good one.  There are way better places around the Henderson area to get one.  Prices seemed too high as well,UNK
4955,Very limited menu for lunch but what they do prepare is delish. I had the smoke turkey and fried egg sandwich and my companion had the pulled pork. We both thought they were tasty. Very stylish inside and I would like to try it for dinner.,UNK
4956,"Love this place. 1 minute from my house. Super friendly staff. Great coffee, bagels & cinnamon buns.",UNK
4957,"The world may never know why Van Buren is such a ghetto paradise, but you can rest assured that you are right in the thick of it at the Days inn!  Nice pool, and the palm trees are a plus.  Just roll with it.  It will all be over before you know it.",UNK
4958,"My carne asada torta was terrible. The meat marinade made it seem store bought and it was so tough I could barely eat it. Was hoping for an authentic west side Mexican spot. Um...you better fix it guys, cause that meal sucked.",UNK
4959,"Not the nicest or newest hotel on the strip, but its centrally located, the prices are always incredibly hard to beat, and the staff is always helpful and friendly.  I would stay here anytime!",UNK
4960,I really like this place - second time coming good for mixed groups of vegetarians and meat eaters- second time coming and very good. I really like the soup (veg lemon grass) Plus it's bring your own wine!,UNK
4961,"The truffle creamed spinach was awesome!!  I got the tuna (I know, at a steak house) and it was ok.  Husband liked his steak but preferred Delmonico's for the same price.  Overall, the food was ok.",UNK
4962,"Cheap, rundown, dirty, but cheap.",UNK

4967,Dr. Brooks saved my dog's life. I'm very grateful for the professional service and care we received. I highly recomend this animal hospital.,UNK
4968,"I have eaten at many Salsitas which are usually good, but this one sucks. Six bucks for a.pollo asada borito that was pretty much beans and rice. What chicken there was had a funky smell.",UNK
4969,"Very good espresso, I will be back.",UNK
4970,"Do NOT eat here my husband got food poisoning.\nMy husband went to ceasar's and had lunch at Plant Hollywood he ordered a turkey sandwich with fries sounds harmless, well later that day he got the worst case of food poisoning that landed him at the ER.",UNK
4971,Reuben sandwich w salad AND soup and all three totally bland! I'm sad that I didn't enjoy this place because I LOVE delis. Damn.,UNK

4975,Not that great of a buffet but perfect for a quick breakfast. They only had like two people working though so they were running around like crazy. I recommend making your own omelet!,UNK
4976,This is a great place to eat and drink wine. The food is delicious and the service is always wonderful. I have been here several times and I love it. The cheeses are spectacular and I am not even the biggest cheese fan. The desserts are great too.,UNK
4977,Worst management company I have ever dealt with. They have an excuse for everything and deliver nothing. They are not truthful people to deal with. I have lived here for year and half and have yet to have good encounter with management.\nDo not move here!,UNK
4978,Worth a visit just to check out the amazing waterfall inside. Oh and make sure to reserve a table because even then there's a long VIP line.,UNK
4979,Not worth the price and I dunno how they are still open especially on nuns island! They have a competitor sushi palace just across!,UNK
4980,People are great and the food is awesome. Been eating their pizza's regularly for a couple years now. Awesome!!,UNK
4981,Just like ever other mcdonalds. Depends on which manager is on duty. I get great service when I'm sure the GM is around but other then that it's terrible. But then again.. You get what you pay for.,UNK
4982,Giani has done amazing work on me for a while now. He's got talent like no other! I won't go to anyone else! His shop is awesome and he has alot of great artists. Thank you G! See ya soon for some more tattoo therapy! :),UNK

4986,This is my sbsolute favorite restaurant!  Their chips and salsa is incredible. I recommend requesting the smooth salsa and mixing it with their ranch. The salad and soup are both crazy good. I have never had anything that I did not love at this restraunt.,UNK
4987,"The man working there was very nice, but the food was not.",UNK
4988,"I've had better Yelpers. This place wasn't bad, but I won't be back. I was looking for that taste. You know what I'm talking about.",UNK
4989,Excellent dinner. Had a New York Strip steak and Scallops for $22.00,UNK
4990,We were very disappointed. We ordered ordinary dishes that had rookie mistakes. The shrimp cocktail and the fish in the cippino were overcooked...I think Red Lobster doesn't even make these mistakes. We will not be returning.,UNK
4991,"I had dinner here tonight, and loved the entire experience! The patio was roomy, our server was quick, and the food was delicious! I ordered the Thai Cobb salad and really enjoyed the unique, healthy flavor! My dinner was priced fairly and I got a lot of food. I will be going back",UNK
4992,Best Burgers in CU.  Everything else on their eclectic menus also pretty rocks the most.  That will be all.,UNK

4994,"Just do yourself a favor and don't go here. Worst customer service, food is always wrong and nasty and they charge for sauces.",UNK
4995,Went last night and sat in the bar area.  We had Ally as our server and she recommended a great bottle of wine since their Malbec is no longer available.  She was great and she has served us before and always does great.  Great food and great atmosphere.,UNK
4996,I broke my iphone 5S screen last week end and these guys fixed my phone in just 20mins. They have the lowest price in town. Great job wireless phone doctors! Im referring you to every one i know that has a broken phone. :),UNK

5004,Wanted to stop in but had that raven banner up just can't do it !,UNK
5005,I'm talking about the Wolfgang Puck express in gate D.   I ordered a Greek salad and the lettuce looked and tasted like it was a week old.  The tomatoes seemed to have been dipped in vinager for days.  It was disgusting.  Doesn't this company have quality control?,UNK
5006,"Cute atmosphere, a few good beers on tap, good sliders. The waitress was kind of a snob and looked \""busy\"" even though there were only like 4 other people at the bar, so that was weird.",UNK
5007,Great sandwich shop.  Pastrami deluxe is my favorite.,UNK
5008,Me and my sister went here for the first time and we both ordered the steak and shrimp plate which was excellent we also ordered the flat bread appetizer which was outstanding and the service was outstanding we will be back to this location,UNK
5009,We waited over an hour for a table. The hostesses were beyond rude. The food was ok but definitely not worth the wait. Don't waste your time!,UNK
5010,"The ingredients are fresh and good but i always have to throw the pizza in the oven because it is never fully cooked, get your stuff together guys, your pizza would be good if it was cooked right! Cant comment about anything else.",UNK
5011,First trip was six years ago.  Last year very disappointing.  This year. Not any more.  Celebrity has overtaken the culture and attitude.  Sorry customers are such an inconvenience.  Word is really getting out.   It has become a smug attitude. Sad,UNK
5012,I stumbled across this place because I was hungry and it was late and I happened to be near it at the time. I had the salmon and it was good. I plan on trying it again at some point the next time I'm in Madison.,UNK

5017,The food was good but the price.....not so much. The service however was the best we had in Vegas. The service is the only reason I am giving this one three stars. And that's all I really have to say about this place.,UNK
5018,Food is pretty good here. We usually just get pizza and a salad. Ive heard the Serbian food is really good. The service is up and down. The beer selection is very good and the atmosphere is cool.,UNK

5021,"I drove by this location earlier today and was a little sad that they were closed for good... then I realized, who needs Borders when you have a perfectly good Half Price Books across the street? And a B&N nearby?",UNK
5022,Very pricey.  Small amount of lobster in all the dishes we tried.  Large portions of bread  to make up for it.  The food is tasty just no where near enough lobster.  Cute gimmick just won't satisfy your need for shellfish,UNK
5023,"One of the more cleaner 24. But this review is based on the people that go this 24. Gym filled with racist people who will stereotype you based on your race. If you are Asian, you are not welcomed at the basketball court.",UNK

5043,"Really good, greasy pizza.  However, in a town full of truly great pizza (Glass Nickel, Ian's, and Roman Candle), Falbo Bros is just a late night stop.  It is what it is.",UNK
5044,Nice little shop to stop and get fueled.  The iced coffee hit the spot.  We were in unknown territory on the way out of Vegas when we spotted this place.  We were happy to find it.,UNK

5050,This place is a dump. Very dirty and grimy. The tables and seats are not clean. The waffles were ok. Nothing special. I would not go here again.,UNK
5051,"Service is SLOW. And by the looks of the place, I'm a bit afraid of the conditions...",UNK
5052,It's was ok! I thought the reputation of the hotel would hold up in the buffet but it didn't . It was a step above hometown buffet. Pricey for what is it.,UNK
5053,They microwave their BBQ items. NOT FRESH!,UNK
5054,"I had the chicken katsu curry.  It was a little curry sauce poured over the katsu.  Not bad, but not really great.  Wife and I shared a crab rangoon and it was good.",UNK

5058,The food is good. I have been 4 times and the service has always been horrible. 20 minutes to get a diet coke after having to call the manager. This is the last time I am going there.,UNK
5059,Great food. I love sitting at the bar. I usually get a pizza. Lots of choices and I've never had anything bad.,UNK
5060,This was never my choice of bank. They took over my bank years ago. Now they're saying other people can't make cash deposits to my account. What kind of bank doesn't accept cash? So I'm out. Wells Fargo was very friendly when I opened my account with them.,UNK
5061,Food was decent it's only IHOP nothing amazing.,UNK
5062,Great food! \nReasonable price!\nAte at the bar because it was packed on a Thursday night at 8!\nBartender was very attentive even being busy! \n\nHighly recommended,UNK
5063,Shop closes at 7pm and I walk in 25 minutes before closing and they wouldn't take me although they were clearly open and available. Annoying.,UNK
5064,Coffee is amazing and the crepes are wonderful.  Great vegetarian options and love the touch of fried egg on top!,UNK
5065,We ordered very basic fried rice dishes. They're reasonably priced but very very bland. I'll give them another shot with other menu items but with the fail of this simple dish I won't know what to expect.,UNK
5066,"Service was Horrible, Food was Cold, Drinks were Hot!  Just plain Lousy.\nVery Disappointing!  Go to Prime Steak House instead @ the Bellagio",UNK
5067,Great executive course right in the heart of Scottsdale. The 18 th hole gets me every time. There are discounts online at golfnow.com. The course is always in great shape and their driving range is good.,UNK
5068,Great beer great food,UNK
5069,I'm a big fan of their strawberry water and if I'm looking for a better lunch than what I have at home I'll swing by and pick up a salad from here.  They have a good selection- and it's constantly expanding.,UNK
5070,"Macy's always has great stuff, but standing in line for 15-20 min is a lot. Great selection, easy parking, great facility.",UNK
5071,Even in  late night the place is full.\n\nThere is too many people endless place to work out.\n\nthey have To make this place bigger.,UNK
5072,Beautiful view. \nCustomer service is awful!!!!! Definitely understaffed. If there were more bartenders on staff I might consider giving it another shot. I just can't see waiting 45 minutes for one drink!,UNK
5073,Fish tacos here are fantastic!!!,UNK
5074,I used to come here every other week for the past few years ... After tonight... Never again...,UNK
5075,What's the point of having a Starbucks if it doesn't open till after 8am?!?! Most people are already at work by then..,UNK
5076,"I love this place! If you are going to get a full set, make sure you call ahead and make an appointment with Heather.  She does an amazing job and they seem to stay on longer than anyone I've ever gone to see. EVERYONE here is so nice though!",UNK
5077,The little ceasers that was at this location was so much better.  Pizza slice i ordered was cold/reheated and not very tasty.\n\nBest new york pizza is secret pizza at the cosmopolitan,UNK
5078,This place is amazing from top to bottom. 2 hours down we are still here.,UNK
5079,Our favorite spot :),UNK
5080,Pretty much on par with my past experiences with Ethiopian food. Had the vegetarian combo with the avocado salad. Tasty but nothing crazy exciting.,UNK
5081,"First time at trivia night and our little team claimed victory so my overall impression of this Majerle's is very positive.   Food is standard bar fare, but the service was good with friendly and attentive servers.  I will be back...",UNK
5082,"Normally I'd leave 4 stars but the service wasn't up to par. Sushi was good by Champaign standards. But the service was slow, and we had to wait 30 minutes to be told they ran out of the dessert we had ordered.",UNK
5083,Nice place...,UNK
5084,AWESOME!  Excellent prices and delicious food. I ordered Mongolian Beef minus mushrooms- my meal was superb. Best Mongolian beef I've ever had! The owner was friendly and talkative. I'll be eating here again next time I'm in Madison.,UNK
5085,Its gross! Their dim sum is nasty and hard! Their noodle soups are so so. Not that great.,UNK
5086,"I have to agree with you Sarah. I question why I still go here even after everytime I leave my car is scratched up. Sure it's cleaner than when I brought it in, but not as clean as it should be. \nI'm too lazy to wash my own car too.",UNK
5087,"Amazing vegan sweets! Love their Sunday brunch! Highly recommend.  \n\nNote: it does get loud and overrun by hipsters, but the food is still well worth it.",UNK
5088,"The food is slightly better quality than most buffet's, but the service isn't great. It's also quite expensive. There is a large selection of food.",UNK
5089,Gyro plate... ehhhhh. Not as good as metropolitan across the way but they stop serving lunch at 2pm so I had to get my rotating lamb beef fix and I gave it a try. Salty.,UNK
5090,"If you want something quick and pretty good \""asian food\"" go for it.  I wasn't disappointed it was exactly what I expected.  The old Teriyaki Chicken Bowl from Jack is better.",UNK
5091,Went for breakfast. Food was precooked sitting out cold. Eggs cold-bacon cold. The only thing hot was the coffee. Yes it was inexpensive but horrible.,UNK
5092,I don't think Gordon has tried his onion rings. To heavy and thick with a very hard batter.  The hog burger is not something I would order again however the sweet potato fries were very good,UNK
5093,i have the servics here i owner of bedrock bbq bbq ok 3 1/2 but the services was good,UNK
5094,I'm hooked on this pizza! Love it. Fast delivery.,UNK
5095,Excellent food! Loved the Kobe beef sashimi and the variety of specialty rolls. A little pricey but your in Vegas and at a resort so what do ya expect?,UNK

5098,"Great customer service, Best glass company in all of Maricopa County. Highly recommend. Professional staff",UNK
5099,The music and ambiance amazing. Very professional crowd. Yet super guy heavy. View is super nice. Also in the other tower is mix similar view just different more casual layout.,UNK
5100,"I initially liked Tere's in the beginning, however, recently when I schedule any appointment with a specific nail tech it is always someone else I don't know. This has become more and more frequent. I hope I can change this behavior or I will look for a new place.",UNK
5101,"Very quiet place and the food is healthy, tasty and fresh.  \n\nI saw a bunch of music videos on the TV while I ate, and I don't think any of the music was in english, but I am still curious to hear the songs anyway.",UNK
5102,"Food is good. Service is not so good. If you're already in the area its a good option, but I wouldn't go out of my way.",UNK
5103,"Been going to Red Devil for years.  Always know what you are going to get here.  Good Pizza, sandwiches, wings and more.  The service is great and the prices are reasonable.",UNK
5104,Great quick service in a very clean establishment. I have brought donuts to my office at least a dozen times in the last year or two from this store and never been disappointed. They are extremely efficient.\n\nI'll keep coming back!,UNK
5105,"Strawberry mojitos and taquitos were great!! Wings are gross, but who orders wings at a mexican place? Chips and dip are great :)",UNK
5106,"Food here was ok\n\nSalad bar has good variety.  Service here sucks.  Salad bar was missing several items.  Several people complained and amongst the 3+ servers, they couldn't fill the missing items on a weekend at 7PM.",UNK
5107,They changed the formula for a bit so it was not as creamy and it was terrible but now its bacl to the way it was.. creamy and delicious.. price is grwat and cant complain for the bih servings and amount of fixings,UNK
5108,"Everybody loves Daily Does!  The lines say that every Saturday and Sunday morning.  The food is much more fresh than any breakfast joint I have been to.  It's in a great spot in Old Town too!  Also, their pretzel buns...LOVE.",UNK
5109,Nice staff. Informative during my delayed flight. Ordered the bratwurst. Good for airport food. Decent!,UNK
5110,This place is amazing!! We went two days in a row. The ramen is delicious!! The broth is so savory!! Highly recommended!! Don't forget to add the fresh garlic to your noodles,UNK
5111,"Great mall. Need more elevators, more restrooms and what the hell, says you open at 10:00 am but the stores aren't even open yet. \n\nThis mall needs to get it together.",UNK
5112,"I was at the mall, \nGot my nails done on the spot, \nDidn't need to call to make a reservation, and it was fast \nNice People,good service\nWill use again",UNK
5113,This place would be better if there was one dj who wasn't playing crap music.,UNK
5114,The undisputed taco champion of Laveen! They take such great care in the preparation and presentation of their food and it always tastes fresh.\n\nI've tried something different on their menu and have never been disappointed.,UNK
5115,$$BEER$$...Just so so. I guess the price of beer made it expensive. Nothing to write home about.,UNK
5116,"Very good, Cartel is better by far.",UNK
5117,"Great place to take the family.  Would recommend this location for parties. Glen, the game attendant did a great job resolving the problem with one of the games.",UNK
5118,"Miss Jan, is the sweetest lady around. I can always find what I need there. Also, she always seems to come through with poducts and/or ideas!!",UNK
5119,Service was wonderful.  Phad Thai not that great.,UNK
5120,"Satisfied with food! The stuffed mushroom is a no-no. However, tandoori chicken, chicken makhani, and fish n yogurt sauce are delicious. The portions are generous and service is prompt! I recommend this place",UNK
5121,"Bon, tr\u00e8s copieux, bonne ambiance, service super sympa !",UNK
5122,"I had the cajun catfish and fried okra.  The food was hot and fresh.  We ate around noon and there was a steady stream of people that came in as we dined...  It took about 15 minutes to get our food, but we weren't in a hurry.",UNK
5123,"I had a similar experience as most other reviewers.  I bought a Groupon, made an appointment, had to reschedule my appointment and never got a call back.  The professionalism is severely lacking.  Groupon was very accommodating when I made my complaint against this business.",UNK
5124,"Surprisingly, the accommodations are a little worn already. However, I love the casino area. Very nice!",UNK
5125,This place is cool and jukebox is great but the bartenders are all facing premature mid-life crisis. The only friendly bartender is the girl whom I wish would be there more often.,UNK
5126,"I like this place. It's quiet and not crowded so I can use their Wi-Fi and get work done. Good coffee, good treats.",UNK
5127,The pick up bus runs every 10 minutes. It is very convenient especially if you are preferred.,UNK
5128,"Outstanding experience from the perfectly cooked and seasoned steak down to the swivel chairs. Enjoyed everything about my experience here. The staff was outstanding, the food was delicious and the ambiance exceptional. Well worth the price",UNK
5129,I love this place!!!  They are very hard working therapists that offer massage for extremely reasonable prices.  I can afford to be a regular here because of the low cost.,UNK
5130,Just bad overpriced Italian food. Bread and service at the counter were particularly bad. Caesar salad was full of dressing. The pasta sauce tasted like what you buy in the supermarket. Another tourist's trap. Best thing was the adjacent fountain......,UNK
5131,Best choice of ingredients and selection of toppings I've seen in a pizza joint. Spotted goat is great but what's really great about this place is a vegan actually has options on this menu.,UNK
5132,What a treat! \n\nWe opted for the sit-down restaurant experience and the breakfast we had (although pricey) was so delicious. \n\nI didn't know Eggs Benedict can be this good! \n\nService was great too.,UNK
5133,Always super messy in the store and dressing rooms make me feel like I'm going to catch a disease. I think reflooring this store would drastically change the experience. Also more friendly employees. I've been to way nicer F21's.,UNK
5134,"Solid meal. I had the chicken strips. They were awesome. Right balance of meat, seasoning, and breading. The wife had the bangers and mash and fried pickles. She was definitely a fan. We will most definitely come back again.",UNK
5135,This is my brothers favorite pizza place. Make sure you know what kind of pizza you like before you order. I it's crispy which I love but others hate.,UNK
5136,Not a real fan of this place. I have been here three times and I think it is a trendy money pit that has bleh food.,UNK
5137,"Staff is friendly and attentive, but food is AWFUL & expensive. The only reason I dine here is for the view. Breathtaking view!",UNK
5138,Food good. Server Michael never mentioned the free included spumanti ice cream \nWe left without it.,UNK
5139,"dont come! u are better off. going to the seven eleven .food sucks !  way over price,\nn service was ok! but the food dosent have flavor, condiments or anything. yeahhhhh jjst dont go , u will regret it",UNK
5140,This place is hands down better than any nearby choice; especially chain restaurants. Service is polite and food is FRESH! I try new dishes every time and have yet to be disappointed.,UNK
5141,"Short staffed so the service was good for the situation. Food was good, my only problem is they aren't showing the Arizona state game on the big screen. Can't believe the fan base here...leaving at the half",UNK
5142,"This has now gone bust - sadly, I suspect, due to the tram works which has closed the whole of Shandwick Place.",UNK
5143,"Our burger was good. Pretzel roll was soft.  Service was good. Food came out quick. Milkshake was thick & yummy. French fries were fresh cut, thin & just warm. Not my preference.",UNK
5144,We got a happy meal with no toy.\nWhat's the point?!\nAnd the manager was a prick,UNK
5145,"They had a decent cup of coffee.  I enjoyed it.  They had a lot of interesting looking pastries, muffins and cookies that looked good but I only got a cup of coffee.  Pretty fast service but they were a little disorganized for a little bit.",UNK
5146,Peanut butter Blondie was a win!!! This place could definitely use a face lift but the product was incredible so I can't complain. I'll be back ;),UNK
5147,"This club is cool.  If you don't have a VIP booth then you're shit outta luck, because there is barely any place to sit and the dance floor is always crowded.  Other than that, the venue is pretty nice!",UNK
5148,"This place is awesome!! Friendly staff and great service. Literally takes less than 5 minutes from the airport, always has some kind of groupon offer available, picks and drops you off right in front of your car. Will be happy to use them again",UNK
5149,The staff is much better! The food is served in an appropriate time. I'm glad that I have it another shot.,UNK
5150,Huge selection. So much booze it's hard to choose.  Yummy in my tummy.,UNK
5151,"Good food! Although, there was this strange flavor that seemed to be carried throughout each main and side dish. Great service, and the food came out at the right temperature and promptly. Fpr cleanliness, I would rate it 4 out of 5.",UNK
5152,This place is great! Best vietnamese food!,UNK
5153,"The employees are SOOO rude here. I asked for a chocolate milkshake and the response I got was \""no chocolate shake.\"" That's not even a complete sentence....and they want to make $15/hr. Ridiculous!",UNK
5154,Try the fish and chips. The shrimp has a lot of breading. If your looking for cheep this is your place. Only take cash,UNK
5155,"NIce place. Food is good and affordable, yet it's nice enough to have a semi-fancy night out at too.",UNK
5156,"A very very long wait like two hours,  this is the best pizza in the state of az but wating two hours to eat is not right.  The pizza is really good.",UNK
5157,Every time I'm in Vegas I make it a point to come here. They have the best sandwiches without breaking the bank. Love the Cannonballs sandwich & the tuna melt.,UNK
5158,"Worst customer service ever. Lines are long,  and the workers don't even pretend to care. My shipping quotes were also not honored, just bad experiences overall.",UNK
5159,I just wanted an oil change and I get quoted $400 to replace an oil pan and oil drain plug.,UNK
5160,Great service great $2 sub I'm very happy I got the cold cut trio and it was delicious. Typical usual subway experience however the stuff was very nice and accommodating .,UNK
5161,"Everything was great.  Requested to split two entr\u00e9es and four separate plates came out...As requested, split entrees.",UNK
5162,there is a reason i put up with other clubs in Las Vegas...\n\n\n...and not this one.,UNK
5163,Just walking around the south side and stumbled upon this gem. Amazing milkshakes!!!! And yummy chocolate. Will defiantly be returning!!!,UNK
5164,Pluses\n1.Location is good\n2. Price is not bad considering location\nMinuses\n1. No place to sit\n2. Pizza is just MEDIOCRE,UNK
5165,"Yuck\n\nTwo stars because the margaritas were tasty.  The food was horrible.\n\nEverything tasted pre-made, pre-packaged, and horrifically commercial.  Yuck!",UNK
5166,"It's good, but the topping selection, decoration, and service is better at Tutti Frutti a half block up the street.  I'd go there instead any day.",UNK
5167,Thank you Pablo for the wonderful experience you provided to Emilio & I. We were both very pleased with the service. We'll be back!,UNK
5168,"Yummy sandwiches, and great chips!",UNK
5169,"A VERY cool little indie grocery store.  Completely organic, and really fun.  They have a food prep area and a coffee bar as well.  In the evening the place opens up to the street and has a great young hip vibe.",UNK
5170,Worth the money. You'll probably see celebrities here. You have to get there early to ensure entry.,UNK
5171,"The beer and the service are outstanding.  The location is terrible for finding parking if you try to patron this place during peak hours.  The happy hour is a little anemic but if you love craft beer, the pros outweigh the cons.",UNK
5172,Esther was amazing. She was caring and really made sure I loved my hair for my sister's wedding.,UNK
5173,Loveee this place! the coffee is soooo good and it's a really cool place to chill for a few hours. I had an iced latte and it was absolutely amazing! Definitely highly recommended if you want quality coffee in Waterloo.,UNK
5174,Every time I have gone here the food was greasy and a bit too old. I usually like Panda and this is closest to my place so I have been disappointed...then I went in mid day recently and it smelled so bad I had to leave. The staff is always nice though.,UNK
5175,Fantastic place for inventive delicious food.,UNK
5176,Excellent coffee and service. The cafe is a small one with 3 tables so best as a take away place. We had two flat whites to go and they were very well done. \n\nThe cafe also sells their own beans,UNK
5177,Every time I've been here I always see multiple health code violations. The French fries are pretty good but the Reuben made me very ill.,UNK
5178,Great bar feel. The poppers were delicious and the beer on tap was great. Great service . TV s at every table was a plus. I'll be back on Sunday for football.,UNK
5179,"Eating here now, wonton soup is good. Kung pow chicken very good. Loved the egg roll. I would definitely come back! Very reasonable prices.",UNK
5180,"This place reminds me a little of a \""Greek Chipotle\"". It is casual dining, a step up from fast food, with very good quality food and very reasonable prices. It is a perfect lunch stop and a welcome change from burger and sandwich shops.",UNK
5181,"I knew the mango margaritas would be good, but I was amazed at how wonderful the tilapia was!! Flaky and fresh and not over-battered...I highly recommend trying it!!",UNK
5182,I'am sorry to report the food here at Salvatore's stinks.  Nothing tasted very good. Thanks for the great service.,UNK

5184,"Our favorite restaurant downtown! Simplicity in presentation and environment, out of this world food!",UNK
5185,The owner greeted us as we walked in- they were jammed packed but he got us a seat outside in less than 5 min. the server was kind too and the food amazing! the price is cheap for what you get! I had the southwestern sandwich and french onion soup which were both excellent!,UNK
5186,Cheap food and beer.  Too bad the food isn't any good.  Poutine was very marginal.  Service was ok.  First pitcher of beer came out completely flat.  Good for sports as there are TVs all over the place.  Just an average sports bar with crappy food.,UNK
5187,"Went there in a School field trip with my kid. This is one of Vegas' hidden treasures. It's not big and its not as sophisticated as NY or LA, but iy is clean and well-maintained. They have shows for almost every age range.",UNK
5188,"Loved everything about this place. It's beautifully done, small and quaint. The menu is great and the food was amazing. It was suggested as one of the best restaurants in the city and certainly delivered.",UNK
5189,Great food and service only bad thing is if you are there 1 hour you hear the same music 4 times omg and every time I go I hear the same music the owner needs some variety omg,UNK
5190,Standing at counter for 10 minutes while 2 associates carried on a conversation and 1 associate walked passed me and did not offer assistance.  Very poor customer service tonight. Language not appropriate either.,UNK
5191,If I could give them negative starts i would. Worst customer service I have ever experienced.,UNK
5192,I have had a salad here about 6 times in the past couple of months and it just seems like the lettuce and the some of the toppings are just not that fresh.  Just seems like it should be better...,UNK

5197,"This was our first visit and we will be back. Margaritas were excellent, food great, and fast, friendly service! Overall extremely happy with our experience!",UNK
5198,"Pretty average BK. It shares a dining room with Popeyes so you'll have decent variety in the building.  The trash cans are always turned facing the walls for some reason, and the fountain drink machines don't always function, but overall it's not much different than any other BK.",UNK
5199,"Meal was very good, I had the filet of sole, waitress was attentive, however did not clear plates when I was finished. Service is almost always an issue when dining @ Mimi's. see the other reviews for Casa Grande.",UNK
5200,You do not want to waste your time at Jolly Bob's. Yes it has fun drinks if you can actually get one. The bartender there is plain rude and it takes forever to get a drink. Food if average. Trust me a lot better places in town.,UNK
5201,"I had their Reuben, and it was juicy, tender, and unique. I will definitely come back for more and possibly try their dessert next time.",UNK
5202,"Totally on point with good wood fired pizza!  I wish they had more of a bar selection, but of what they have....it's good.  I also love the water station.",UNK
5203,"Best hot dog i've ever had!  This place was absolutely great.  Such an interesting combination of flavors, but it definitely works.",UNK
5204,1) Stale fries\n2) Watery gravy\n3) Ketchup packs were all nasty because i guess sauce spilled all over it\n\ni've been to wayyyyy better popeyes!,UNK
5205,"Pizza is good.  Amazing Garlic Bread,  Little pricey.  Nice spot within walking distance from my pad.  Plan on going here again.",UNK
5206,Horrible service..I can see staff messing around in the back while I watch them.. waiting for my food.. smh,UNK
5207,"Service here are not so great. But who is normally at a tea place for their service anyways. As for their milk tea, it was still very sweet even with 1/3 of sugar. I really wish there tea could be more stronger. Since its too light for my taste.",UNK
5208,Such a great breakfast and lunch spot.  I adore the Spanish omelette.  Plus they will custom make your omelette to order.  No worries about additions or changes.  And tons of sides to choose from.,UNK
5209,"Great work, fixed my tattoo an loved it.. thanks Chris..Thanks Ryan for the referral. Definitely coming back..",UNK
5210,"The food was decent.  But yet again, the staff managed to screw my order up and ended up charging me more then what I should of payed for.",UNK
5211,Love me some Alaska Airlines.  There is always a decently priced ticket to LA and Vegas.,UNK
5212,"Nobody asked us for help including the greeter. 3 employees walked right passed us without offering to help us, expected more for a Home Depot. Giving 3 stars only because the store had alot of stock on the product I was looking for.",UNK
5213,"Food not spicy at all, horrible slow service, did not feel welcome at all, rude employee! overpriced, overall an experience no one should ever have!!",UNK
5214,"I wish I would have been flying an actual AA flight, but I was put onto a US Airways plane and it sucked.  I was really bummed, they haven't  been good for quite a long time.  Hopefully I'll get on an AA flight on my way back.",UNK
5215,Great food! Below average service.,UNK
5216,"Conveniently located near good food and a Starbucks. This in my world is a \""trifecta of awesomeness.\""",UNK
5217,"This place is no longer in business... (at least, not at this location)",UNK
5218,3 stars. What more am I supposed to say aside from the fact that I love how they have slot machines inside... haha\n\nSin City baby!,UNK
5219,"Great selections, plenty of stations and really good wait staff. This buffet is what the Spice Market used to be like. Creative dishes from different cultures and one of the best desert and cheese bars around. Well worth a trip.",UNK
5220,I was hoping for a kick @$$ sandwich - I got what might be a step above subway but they don't even bake their own bread (subway does). I'll stick with jimmy johns or keep looking.,UNK
5221,"Took forever to get our food, very disorganized wait staff! Food was OK but the water must come right out of the water main, tasted terrible. Also the place was very dirty!",UNK
5222,"I had an incredible time here because I was with good company and the service was good, but honestly, I can't remember much about the food.  I do remember the incredible view!  I want to go back and give this place another try.",UNK
5223,Food is decent to good.  I have gone there three times for take out for my staff and the orders were completely screwed up three times and when I our someone else tried to correct the order they were incompetent or hostile.,UNK
5224,"I shared big plate with my colleague, various meat  was finely seasoned and taste was very good. Turkish tea is also great.",UNK
5225,We waited 20 minutes for a waiter to attend to us. There were only 3 tables occupied for goodness sake. If only the overly distracted Chef said something or the hyperactive old female waiter sent another server. This place wouldn't get 1 star. WE WALKED OUT.,UNK
5226,"I love this Buffet. It's a little pricey, but can we complain? It delievers on damn good food. I hope the their standards stay the same and I'll keep coming.",UNK
5227,terrible phone and customer service.  absolutely awful.  will never use for installation of anything again. They overcharged me and were completely inconvenient. I don't care what the deal is. Never again Home Depot.,UNK
5228,"So from 3-7pm Monday's- Saturday's, I'm freakin in love with this place!  Yes, that's during happy hour.  This place is amazing for happy hour.  I can't speak for any other times during the day.  =)",UNK
5229,"Bland breakfast burrito. Needs some salt. Yes the hot sauce is spicy but taste shouldn't be just about \""how hot\"" the salsa is. I'll try it another day and update my review.",UNK
5230,All i can say is what happened to this place!!\nI use to visit this location years ago when i lived in el paso and now this place has multiplied and the food quality has gone way low!,UNK
5231,The steak deal is easily worth double the asking price.  Its a solid 15 dolla steak.  The fried chicken is quite good as well - blows hash house away.  Hit it.,UNK
5232,Favorite place because it represents east coast culture! They have the best meatloaf sandwich and cookies I've had. I order here once a week or more! Great place :),UNK
5233,"Overpriced for slightly above average food. Very nice, clean and the food was fresh. I had to over stuff myself to feel like I got my moneys worth. There wasn't anything that I really hated or loved.",UNK
5234,"Quite frankly, I think i was Hispanic during my past life or something because I absolutely loveeeeee Mexican food! Now you cant really find authentic Mexican food around this area but this place is pretty legit.   definitely recommend the steak tacos and brisket nachos!! Yum!",UNK
5235,"Great shop, been coming here for years. I don't trust any other shop in Vegas. Definitely recommend making an appointment before you come.",UNK

5248,"Well, it was a very late morning breakfast, so the staff may have just been recovering from a busy morning, but the service was not great.  Took a while to even get place settings.  The food was okay, but I was expecting better after seeing all the 4 star reviews.",UNK

5298,"Just had the worst experience at CPK in Charlotte. We used to be frequent customers, will never return. Still have not even heard from them after writing to them explaining my situation. The manager here is AWFUL! Ruined a 5 year olds birthday and was completely rude and arrogant!",UNK

5313,We had a great lunch.  The Blue Corn pancake with BBQ duck was super.  My wife has the hot smoked salmon club and I had the Yucatan chicken skewers.  Both were excellent.,UNK
5314,Opens late. Long lines. Under staffed. Packages never available for pick up when slip states. Packages sit at local sorting facility for days on end without being delivered. My experience with this post office feels like an insight into living in communist Russia in the 80s,UNK
5315,"What a let down!  Could go to chain steakhouse and get the same taste.  Steaks not cooked correctly. Waitress seemed like we were putting her out everytime we asked for something.  For the price and for the chef's name on it, I expected so much more.",UNK

5321,Was not impressed with the pizza.the Dell was raw very undercooked it was just an OK sauce nothing to rave about.. I come from a long line of pizza makers and i know good pizza when I taste it.. this wasn't close to being good very disappointed,UNK

5327,Very friendly and helpful staff. The ease of getting into this location can be a bit difficult. Due to the shape of the property and the flow of traffic they have blocked off the parking area from the drive through area. On a busy day it makes it a little more difficult to get your deposits ready.,UNK
5328,FYI:  This location is closed as of 9/23/08.,UNK
5329,"Overall, good meal, reasonably priced and large selection.",UNK
5330,"Decent hotel not too far from the strip, clean with very big rooms. Stayed here in June during the week. You can park you car close to your building//room and don't have to walk through endless halls of casino. Resort fee 19$.",UNK

5333,"Good but not great.  Liked Montigu better than cannonball. Boyfriend finished the larger pieces from both sandwiches we tried, and he was still hungry.  Taste-wise, if we were in Miracle Mile Mall, we might eat there again... But won't make a separate trip.",UNK

5335,Kinda cute mais tres chere!!! oh baby watch your wallet!,UNK

5342,Smell like a bathroom. Drinks taste just the same.,UNK

5344,"I went here on a friend's recommendation and was completely underwhelmed. I remember that I had chicken, but that's all I remember about it. I think Monroe Street deserves something better.",UNK

5348,"Good food, good drinks. Music was a bit too loud on the patio, and the front of the house didn't seem entirely prepared for us to sit on the upper patio. Would definitely recommend.",UNK

5358,Outstanding wagyu beef. Great wine list and the best peanut butter chocolate dessert on earth!!,UNK

5368,"Nice alternative from most Vegas attractions and a good way to kill the afternoon if you're not hungover. Not appropriate for all ages, obviously. Definitely gruesome in some parts. The Valentine's Day Massacre display was pretty intense. Museum itself seemed like new.",UNK
5369,"Not the best Mexican food in town, but I'm a fan of their lunch specials. Cheap and fast, great for a working lunch. I love their bean dip, salsa and chips as well! I'd recommend it if you're in the neighborhood.",UNK

5379,Great Service and Friendly staff. In and out quickly. Will go back for additional services when my truck needs it.,UNK
5380,"Gigantic bar, good HH spot. Extensive menu with standard bar fare. Starters outshine the entrees. Nachos, boneless buffalo wings, onion rings were decent. Pass on the hummus plate. Good service, but would probably just return for large draft selection.",UNK

5511,"Surprised that this place was rather nice inside given the seedy location by Metro.  Parking was decent.  Staff were friendly.  Food options were as good or better than other S.T. locations I've visited in recent months.  Heck, I might have to go back.",UNK
5512,"Back when I took my Civic there, they were a good place. Very helpful and got things done. But the only reason it couldn't be a 5 star is because it was kind of expensive for services. $39.99 for an oil change?",UNK
5513,"Don't know why everyone likes this place. Ate here three times in hope I was wrong. I was right, this place is over rated. Their ahi poke was salty. You can't have hawaiian food and mess up poke.",UNK

5522,"Why say Thai twice? Who knows, maybe because you have to look twice to believe there is actually a decent Thai restaurant hiding amongst the tiny village of Las Vegas. Good food! No complaints - nor any great superlatives. Reasonable prices for VEGAS. Nice people running the place.",UNK

5524,Carne asada tacos were good. Salsa bar was nice with 6 different kinds.,UNK

5544,"Nice spot, with a friendly staff.  The sandwiches were very good, and the ingredients all tasted very fresh.  The lady at the counter convinced me to try the cookies, and I was not disappointed.  Oh, and of course, try the cider, it's no joke. Mmmm.",UNK
5545,My expectations were high coming in due to the reviews but really was unimpressed with selection and taste. Ice cream was eh and cost was high. Would rather get Ben and Jerry's from the local mart.,UNK

5562,Liked the food a lot. Exciting and exotic taste no matter how you choose to mix up the ingredients. However I'm not always happy with the service. Staff a little rude and inpatient. Maby just to busy? Also portion varies each time I go there.,UNK
5563,"Service sucks, food sucks, life sucks. If you come here, you will feel the same. Oh yeah, my friends chair is gonna fall apart. I will update with a photo if it does.",UNK
5564,"It's better than Spanish fly because it has more pool chairs, but the ground it way to hot to walk on. Drinks are good but pricey. Either valet or plan on parking down the street as they don't have many spots.",UNK
5565,"awful, popcorn is the worst.  Cannot enjoy movie at all because people are \n ordering during the movie and waiters are making noise constantly going back and forth and  up and down.   The smell of the food and hearing people eating and drinking, placing  orders is annoying.",UNK
5566,I tried their tika masala.  BLAND!  So I added some of the hot sauce to make it more edible.  I don't think I'll go back..,UNK
5567,I should have listened to the previous reviews and ratings.  French dip was tasteless and the roast beef had that greenish sheen to it like it had been sitting too long and then they over cooked it to cover for the fact it had gone bad.  Never again!,UNK
5568,You are a disgusting excuse for a human who gives all pet sitters a bad name!,UNK

5575,The boneless wings are terrible. Food is mediocre at best and prices are definitely not worth it. Won't be going back!,UNK
5576,Nothing special about the place really. I feel like it was built for the lunch hour crowd. Always loved Sam's Cafe but not sure since it changed names if it's any good.,UNK
5577,"Great food , great service. Anything on the menu is worth the price and worth ordering. Make reservations is all I've gotta say. There is always a wait",UNK

5580,Brandy is an awesome manager and super stylist and Cheryl rocks it too! Excellent customer service.,UNK
5581,Expectedly high priced drinks at this lobby bar in Cosmopolitan. I think one Moscow Mule was $16 with tax and tip included. I guess this bar is good for pre-partying or people watching. I just hate spending this much on drinks though?,UNK
5582,Great place to drink on the patio on a beautiful Phoenix day!  Great drink selection and friendly servers.,UNK
5583,NOT an outlet. Found the exact same products and prices at my regular Disney store last week. Save your time and shop online.,UNK

5590,Service was pretty good. Food was decent. Ambiance was nice...kind of a contemporary lounge feel. Pretty nice drink list.,UNK
5591,"Simply put, I did not like this place. I came here for lunch on a weekday and while the service was good, do yourself a favor and try lunch elsewhere. The water tasted gross and the chicken was not tasty at all! I do not recommend this restaurant.",UNK
5592,I've been here twice now for breakfast.  The recent visit was very good.  The baguette french toast was wonderful.  Nice service in a pretty room with large windows to the pool/patio area.,UNK
5593,"Terrible service, we waited almost an hour for our food; they brought us our appetizer but nothing else we told them we're leaving we are paying for the appetizer , we are not paying for anything else and left.",UNK
5594,"Wasn't able to try the food\nAfter waiting for 15 min for service, we left!",UNK
5595,I like the new stores and restaurants and there are still more to come.  The mall is a little small for so much land and I hope they expand further.  It is a step in the right direction though as they try to upgrade.,UNK
5596,"Might just be our new favorite sushi restaurant! The tuna poke is delicious along with all the rolls we've tried- favorites so far are the something good roll and the primo roll. Yum! So far we've only gotten take out, not dined in.",UNK
5597,Love the Pink Taco!!! Good Mexican food and very good Margaritas!!,UNK
5598,"This is definitley a cool place to see a concert or hang out before a Steelers game.  My school has actually come here to have our Spring Formals for the past couple years, and it is always a very nice venue.",UNK
5599,"How disappointing!  I was so excited to try this place out, but the food was marginal at best.  The silverware was dirty and I had to return my wine because the glass still had lipstick on it from a previous guest. I will definitely not be back!",UNK
5600,"Herbal salad and soft shell crab are tasty. The pad thai was very...wet?! It's such a basic dish, I'm surprised they could mess this up. Service is so slow I wanted to leave. Will not try again.",UNK
5601,"The location is good, but the food is far from authentic Japanese food. The teriyaki sauce seems fake. Better choices for Japanese food in town would be Yellowfin or Kamakura. I thought the prices were too high for what you got. College kids might enjoy the large portions of food however.",UNK
5602,Service was kind of lousy. Came here on a holiday and so it was a mad house. Our estimated wait time was completely off. We waited for 45 mins when they told us 20. Food was good.,UNK
5603,"The hotel was renovated from the old Saharah hotel but, the rooms are still terrible. And, their concierge services are also very bad. The hotel is also located in distance from the main strip.",UNK
5604,Psyched to try classics.\nSad to learn: cold cheese poutine.\nSmoked meat's just deli.,UNK
5605,"Les pommes de terre au d\u00e9jeuner sont excellentes, de m\u00eame que le caf\u00e9.",UNK
5606,"Unique location and good food, the flags remind me at my original home (Bavaria), can recommend the pizza and the carrot cake :)",UNK
5607,"Pretty good, large portion, pretty waitress, bad parking and poor atmosphere. I don't know if I'd go back. Maybe if I was really hungry and it boiled down to this place or the Cheba Hut.",UNK
5608,My first time flying American..even though my friend warned me against it.  My gate changed 2 times and was delayed 3 times..don't know if I'll make my connection now!,UNK
5609,Food is only so so. Too greasy and makes the buns soggy.,UNK
5610,"Using yelp, I got a great deal here. But the food took forever and the man behind the counter couldn't even crack a smile. No doubt it was good pizza though!",UNK
5611,"Delicious pizza! I just enjoyed a slice of pepperoni and Italian sausage with the perfect amount of grease on thin crust. Best part, it cost me less than $3.50. Will frequent for lunch.",UNK
5612,Awesome place for a casual date night. Amazing ice-creams and tasty appetizers. I'm not a fan of the price but I can over look that for a special occasion.,UNK
5613,I really hate this airline. Sucks that aa merge with them. They are a bunch of rude flight attendant.,UNK
5614,best scallion pancakes in PHX!,UNK
5615,Not the best chipotle location!  They give you small portions compared to other locations. And when you call them on it they get all butt hurt. I'm a fan of chipotle but  not a fan boy that thinks chipotle could do no wrong.,UNK
5616,Great food and portions! Was not a fan of their coffee. Nicely decorated!,UNK
5617,Massive Sandwhich of great proportions!  Service was super friendly and the atmosphere of this place  was mad chill.  You can't leave this place hungry.,UNK
5618,This place is not good sushi and the prices don't reflect the service.  I went with 2 friends and the waitress made a huge deal about my friend returning her cucumber salad that looked a few days old.  Will not be going back.  Smith's on Valle Verde makes better rolls!,UNK
5619,"Don't order the ribs!! Awful! They're fatty and tough, without much flavor. I hate for my first review to be a bad one, but oh well...",UNK
5620,"Slices is good for a East Coast pizza fix. Nice thin slices, heated to crunchy after you select from a bank of pre-made pizzas. Cheap, quick eats for lunch!",UNK
5621,"I didn't try the hotdogs but everyone said they were good. Fries were amazing. The place is just kinda small, which I guess you can expect for the location.",UNK
5622,The Pizza: 9\n\nThe sandwich: 7\n\nThe service: 4\n\nThe cost: atrocious \n\n$9 for a vodka and Soda?? $18 for a tiny pizza? C'mon now,UNK
5623,"they need to remodel the casino, is so outdated.",UNK
5624,not all it's crabbed up to be.,UNK
5625,"I can't complain about the service, but the food always makes my stomach sick. \n\nBathrooms are always dirty. Last time i was there, I left the place \""running\"".",UNK
5626,Ordered their flavor of the week smores. Extremely strong dark chocolate taste overpowered any other flavor. No Graham cracker in the icecream. Almost threw away the cone. Cold stone is way better.,UNK
5627,Great all vegan menu. Attentive staff and bright environment.  Very tasty.,UNK
5628,"Why was this place so empty during prime time for weekday lunch?\n\nDo people have a thing against large portions of quality food, nice spacious setting, and amazing service?",UNK
5629,Would've liked to have gone three and a half stars here but of course can't cause it's just not allowed. Good food. Family run. Good service. Not crowded. Inexpensive.,UNK
5630,This would be a great place to open a retail store!!!!!!   Maybe they should hire some help to make spending money easier.  I'll spend my money on line.,UNK
5631,All though this location may be closer to home I still prefer the Town Square location. I have only been here once and the service was sub-par. Come to think of it they messed up my order even when I sent it back once.,UNK
5632,"I went with my servers choice while visiting this restaurant, I ended up having the soy salmon. It was definitely a great choice and was delicious to the last bite but was kind of on the expensive side. The interior of this restaurant is gorgeous, the staff was a little bit on the slow side though.",UNK
5633,This place stole my fiance. \n\n....At least when he is missing I know where to find him! \n(and he brings me home their awesome chicken wings) \nhahaha,UNK
5634,"Had a chance to check it out ..was very busy inside and there was a wait., but the food was good even with a limited menu. Id go again if im close by",UNK
5635,Our family was passing through Vegas and wanted yummy Asian food. Yelped and read many good reviews. We liked this little family owned spot. Though we didn't get to try the bim bam bap the BBQ mix plate was a delicious alternative.,UNK
5636,"We had their cheese pizza and wings, it was pretty good. The best thing about the pizza was the crust. The wings were nothing special.",UNK
5637,Tried to use their 10 off offer and they said the current owner doesn't  do yelp anymore.   Not a good way to start off.,UNK
5638,I do not see the value of the store. I look at most prices and what is offered. I have purchased here but infrequently and not a lot,UNK
5639,"Food quality is there..\nService / waitresses could be a little bit more happier about their job..\nThe garlicky, buttery, Hot n Juicy smell in your breath and fingers need to go..",UNK
5640,Enjoy the brunch here on Sundays but that is usually the only time we eat here. The Lloyds omelet is great and you can sub grits or a biscuit for beer bread if you ask. Good draft beer selection.,UNK
5641,"After having lunch here, I'm upset at having passed by this place so often and never stopping in.  There were lots of \""emergency personnel\"" which is generally a sign of good eats.  My lunch was delicious and the service was friendly and fast.  Looking forward to coming again!",UNK
5642,Club looks great but takes a while to get in. Door guys dont have much customer service but they were busy. The girls had a great time,UNK
5643,A-Ok! Fun donut recipes like s'mores and bacon donuts. I found the donuts to be a bit on the greasy side though.,UNK
5644,Pizza sauce and crust was flat with no taste. Owners were not very friendly.,UNK
5645,"El Pollo Loco FREE Chicken for Mothers Day http://bit.ly/BymAs , http://bit.ly/nlKUm , http://bit.ly/nzgPu",UNK
5646,Will NEVER go there again! !!!! They over charge my gift card n they said it was the cards fault! !!! They have stole money from me before!!!! Who ever did my nails did a rush job cause it was crowded n it was a horrible job!,UNK
5647,This club is a has been... That is All!,UNK
5648,I went here twice. Once for a pedi and the other for a nail repair.\nThe first time they were ok but I was not impressed. When i went for my nail repair the lady was rushing and was rude I will not be going back again,UNK
5649,"Had an electrical fire today, after I got locked out of my house yesterday with a door malfunction, and the A/C has been out for 2 days now. But it's only 94 degrees in the house, so totally not too bad.",UNK
5650,Small room and can hear street noise from the 21st floor. No Casino so better off staying at Planet Hollywood.,UNK
5651,"If you are looking for beer....stop by the pub!  The Pub has a ENORMOUS beer menu.  We didn't stop in for food, so I can't give any reviews about the grub.",UNK
5652,"wrote back to Chris and never heard from him, so much for that.",UNK
5653,Wow what an average burger!! Asked for medium rare and it came well done! 25 dollars for an average burger! Not good....,UNK
5654,"No soy sauce. The hostesses that work here are the worst. Waited 30 minutes for a table. I was informed I had to wait another 20. I gave an extra star for our bartender, Travis.",UNK
5655,Ya.  Canned corporate response.  Way to go Mandalay!  Way to address my statements with a non-statement.  I won't be back.  But thanks for the heartfelt and sincere apology.  It means a lot.  Corporate robot...,UNK
5656,"amazing foods, amazing value.\nI would say It's the best in the town!\n\nbetter go to the restaurant earlier and try that real indian samosa.\nit's pretty loud and busy at dinner.",UNK
5657,"I got the French toast with scrambled eggs and bacon. Although the French Toast was sufficiently fluffy, it was nothing special. Reasonable priced. Ok service. I think there are probably better choices for breakfast.",UNK
5658,"I'm all about dive bars, but this one just kind of sucked.  The bartender wasn't at all friendly or interested in helping us.  The decorations were weird, even for Christmas.  The place had no special feeling whatsoever, so I won't go back.  Oh, and cash only.",UNK
5659,"Pizza was super greasy, they took a slice of cheese pizza and put all the toppings on it then melted it in the oven... so the ham and sausage was cold. Also 3.50 for one slice totally not worth it. Unfortunately I cannot recommend this place.",UNK
5660,"Food is blah, but atmosphere is stellar. Just stick with coffee and you'll be happy!",UNK
5661,A little less than mediocre Chinese food but it is what it is. Has some really good lunch and dinner special prices though. Nothing to brag about.,UNK
5662,"St James Shopping Centre could definitely have better shops.  There are parts that feels a little down market and chavvy ... but then probably something to do with being an indoor shopping centre.\n\nJohn Lewis is the star attraction, all the other shops are general high street fare.",UNK
5663,Horrible. The place reeks of smoke. The management at check-in and out do not care about their customers. They were rude and degrading to the point of being insulting. Resort fee is hidden and not worth it.,UNK
5664,"The food is wonderful,  the inside is nice, and the service was just okay. Asked for a to go cup for my daughter's thai tea and ended up having to ask another server.",UNK
5665,They are dishonest about their prices. They claim its 9.95 a month but it cost  $100 to activate your account. The first month of the year they  charge you $49 for a price guarantee fee. This happens every year and they never tell you about it.,UNK
5666,Food was decent.  Don't expect service.  Got a huge frown and attitude when I had the audacity to ask the server to bring me chop sticks.   She brought me a spoon to eat my meal with and nothing else. What?,UNK
5667,Tr\u00e8s bof d\u00e9\u00e7ue par les sandwich et soupes. Trop cher pour ce que cest. \u00c7a vaut pas le coup,UNK
5668,"The sheets were clean, flat screen tv nice, bed very comfortable, pillows nice and firm, but the carpet needs to be steam cleaned twice or just replaced. minus 2 stars",UNK
5669,Slow servers.\n\nSoda was only refilled when I yelled out to the server.\n\nNothing too special.,UNK
5670,Crowded on their open skates but alot o fun.\nPrice is good. \nStaff is alot of young teenagers.\n\nIt is something fun to do with the family.,UNK
5671,I used to love this place. This last visit I never got a chance to eat. Waited 30 minutes for a small pizza that never came. Not one word from the staff about any kind of delay either,UNK
5672,I had a blast when some friends and I went here looking for something different to do.  It's kinda pricey for what you get but I'm competitive and I love racing the boys...and winning!  :),UNK
5673,Great home style food.  One of my favorite breakfast places.,UNK
5674,I will not stay there again.  The train is a deal breaker for me.  The rooms are really nice and the staff is friendly and professional.,UNK
5675,they do not make good scrambled eggs. the pumpkin pacakes were pretty good though,UNK
5676,"Great little hole-in-the-wall type place. Sandwiches are wonderful, especially the Carolina Turkey Club.",UNK
5677,Awesome.   Oyster heaven.,UNK
5678,The staff is not friendly and feel overbearing.  Not a fun experience shopping here....,UNK
5679,Food isn't that good and the Biscuits and Gravey was the worst ever .Don't order the eggs Benedict either,UNK
5680,Literally 3 cars in the whole facility and I waited about an hour for the car to be cleaned.  Decent car wash though. Speed it up guys.,UNK
5681,"This place was cute and clean and had nice personality, but when it came to the food it was very ordinary. These are dishes you can throw together yourself if you wanted. Nothing spectacular at all, I wouldn't come back to this place.",UNK
5682,I'm not impressed. The food was ok at best. The corn beef hash is not at all what you'd expect and it was a disappointment. A mimosa will cost you over $12 too. Very overpriced and I do not recommend it at all.,UNK
5683,a decent place for breakfast. More along the lines of a greasy spoon ; but cleaner with better than typical service.,UNK
5684,"Love Joe's.  My fav is the pull pork sandwich.  The sides are also awesome, especially the mac and cheese.",UNK
5685,Great service and food! What more can I say. If you like Mediterranean food you will love this gem on Fremont.,UNK
5686,nothing special,UNK
5687,"cool dive/brittish pub in downtown.  friendly staff, decent prices and cool atmosphere.  i would give it 5, but i hate soccer and it is ALWAYS on in here.",UNK
5688,"Wings soggy and cold, beer is warm, service is super slow, they overcharge also, not worth it!",UNK
5689,"I hate this mall. It is a tourist trap, the mall and the parking lot are always crowded, the mall has some sort of artificial smell. Only reason I come here is to go to Adidas.",UNK
5690,Excellent pasta dishes - good variety.  We really like the artwork on display on the walls.  Very comfortable place to dine with very friendly service.,UNK
5691,THIS IS NO LONGER A SE\u00d1OR TACO!!  It was replaced by sub par place. Not nearly as delicious!,UNK
5692,Just got escorted out because one of our friends was carrying a military ID. thanks for respecting those who keep our country safe.,UNK
5693,I got robbed here! Sucks. This place used to be awesome and now it is trashy and gross. Go somewhere else.,UNK
5694,"Overrated, ok service, very bland food.",UNK
5695,This was a fun night out for the family.  We decided to try the Wisconsin course. It was challenging but fun.  We'll be back to try the California and Indoor course too.,UNK
5696,The people washing and waxing my truck were great.  But the owner and cashiers not so much!,UNK
5697,This place is not good! The waiter was incomprehensible and the food is yucky. You're friends are going to say it's fine but don't give into peer pressure! The end!,UNK
5698,Good food. Good beers. Had some live music last night which was entertaining too. \nWould've preferred some more options on the food menu.,UNK
5699,"Overall, we were very underwhelmed! Terrible customer service from lady at the front door, just ok service, decor was nice, and my omlet was delish, but way too expensive for the type of food offered.",UNK
5700,great boba but customer service is not as good.\nhad a friend come here and got a wrong order for a drink when there was only two of us. but great boba.,UNK
5701,"Aaron did reach out to me to rectify the situation and it was much appreciated \n\nI'm going to use the credit given to give them a second shot, I'll let you guys know how it goes",UNK
5702,Got here at 4:30 PM and half of the tables were open. We were refused service. Rude waitress. Terrible experience.,UNK
5703,"I would not recommend going here.  There are so many better options.  The food was very dry and made 2 of us sick.  They do not serve alcohol and the meat tasted months old.  Save yourself, don't go.",UNK
5704,The first experience we had here was amazing.  Had a follow up trip for V-day and I was really unimpressed. All 4 courses that night really failed to impress,UNK
5705,Have driven by this place thinking it would be a great cheap dive. Pretty over priced for the quality and the service was lazy. Not much else to say!,UNK
5706,Been here for breakfast many times.  Lunch only a few.  Great American food with speedy service and fair prices.   Only four stars because of the wait on the weekends which actually shows how good this place really is. Never been during the week but it would be a regular lunch destination if I worked downtown.,UNK
5707,"This bar is the biggest pile of shit. Horrible service, too expensive, and in a bad area. Do yourself a favor, and never ever come here.",UNK
5708,"The food is great but the almost hour long wait, in line, is not worth it... It would be a 5 star review if it wasn't such an inconvenience of a wait.. the prices are a little high also but you get what you pay for.",UNK
5709,"GREAT FOOD! Ok drinks, but if you like beer they have a very large selection.",UNK
5710,This place looks like my grandma's kitchen! If you seat down ordering is confusing and the people taking your order make you feel like you have already done something wrong! Food was sad!,UNK
5711,Bad service- rude and unhelpful.  \ndirty - I saw a guy pick up the floor mats and clean them and never washed his hands. \n The food was horrible. Never again.,UNK
5712,You can't understand a word the lady says through the drive through. Great food,UNK
5713,Make sure you check the price I saw them charging more than the listed price and brought it to there attention to no avail,UNK
5714,I won't be coming back here. Everything looks nice but the taste is not very good. The meal just tasted fake.,UNK
5715,This place is dead!!!  They created this club after scarying off all the loyal people that attended it when it was still Tangerine.... this is a terrible place to hangout.. that's why they give girls all you can drink for free hahaha!!!,UNK
5716,They replace batteries.  That is nice.  I have NO idea how they sell anything else to stay in business.,UNK
5717,It feels dangerous outside like you are going to get robbed but the cashier lady is very friendly and nice.,UNK
5718,Affordable combos-grilled chicken or a sandwich with 2 sides close to the Concordia downtown campus for around 8 bucks. The chicken is always good but the sides often lack luster (mashed potatoes from a box?). Speedy service and convenient location.,UNK
5719,Food was terrible and very overpriced. I should have known to leave when i walked in and I could not smell a hint of barbecue smoke. WILL NEVER RETURN!,UNK
5720,Late night specials are great. Cheep Breakfast food and Burgers after midnight. Coffee was not the greatest. DId the trick before the journey back to LA.,UNK
5721,This place is horrible. The service is second rate and the estimates are through the roof. A poorly run company by poorly organized people,UNK
5722,I usually come to this location when I am pulling through the drive through ATM. On a few occasions the outdoor ATM has been out of order and I have had to use their indoor one. Standard location with good parking and location.,UNK
5723,"Good, but not great.  Pizza was too salty and we got the margerita, pesto lasagna was not pestoey enough and too dry.  I mean it was good it just needed a bit more finesse, everything. Big Mexican sodas!",UNK
5724,Service is a major part in an Establishment. With that said this place needs to work on it. They HELLA SLOW........ last and only time I come here.,UNK
5725,Nice atmosphere. Good food. I had the buffalo on some fluffy fantastic foccacia bread. It was awesome. A combo with a drink and chips came to $9. They have free wi-fi which makes working or using your iPhone a pleasure.,UNK
5726,This place is soooooo expensive. Their only saving grace is the taste. The line is slow and long. It's just a window you walk up to and they can only make 3 crepes at a time so don't expect to get out quickly.,UNK
5727,"I was pleasantly surprised. Carlos, was great, helping us choose our tapas. We will be back!!",UNK
5728,Large and tasty gyro pitas.  Great crispy fries.,UNK
5729,"Over priced, boring and bland. Place looks like it should for a NY style pizza joint... But it sure doesn't deliver. I can't believe they are even allowed to call that tasteless piece of cardboard pizza! Sadly, I would not eat here again.",UNK
5730,"Food is tasty, but over priced. It's simple things put together. Service took long for one meal to go. A nice place to have a Sunday brunch though.",UNK
5731,The lobster mac and cheese was terrible. I also tried the lobster ice cream which was another terrible idea. Won't come back for anything else. Located inside the Planet Hollywood.,UNK
5732,CRAZY overpriced unappealing boring entrees with a pretentious atmosphere...move on...  there are way way WAAYYY better choices in town.,UNK
5733,Cheap lunch specials. Thai fried rice was good.,UNK
5734,Normally I love the food here for brunch but the eggs Benedict were horrible. I could barely cut through the toast and the ham was non existent but my moms bananas foster waffles were delicious,UNK
5735,Pollo con queso is ridiculous! Huge menu. Also try the white sands sauce.,UNK
5736,"(Serving) size doesn't always mean better.  Was disappointed with the pancake. I was so looking forward to this too after seeing the great reviews. The service didn't make up for the experience either. Love the hotel, but won't be rushing back to this cafe anytime soon.",UNK
5737,Une cuisine italienne comme ont aiment! Pour les amateurs de p\u00e2te :) the place to be!,UNK
5738,Great food. Nice atmosphere. Good service. And now has alcohol. Salads and sandwiches are delicious. Will be back.,UNK
5739,This loction is ok. The meals were ok. The service on this vist was exceptionally friendly.,UNK
5740,"OK guys, I have to update this location. My wife and I ate there last night. A little after 6pm someone did a drive-by and shot out three of the windows. WTF? See my photos for proof, this ain't no BS!",UNK

5742,Junk shop. Rarely find anything.,UNK
5743,Nice little restaurant . Service fast and friendly. I was accompanying a friend for a snack and I indulged in the mango salad which was delicious. I look forward to sampling more from the interesting menu on my next visit,UNK
5744,This is a great place to stay off-strip for non-gamblers.  The rooms are very nice.  The staff is friendly and helpful.  It is close to the team for easy access to the strip.,UNK
5745,FAmilia pizza is wayyyy better,UNK
5746,"The employees are rude and got 2/3 items wrong in my order, then was annoyed to fix it. The guy working the ordering in the drive thru was terrible.  I won't be back.",UNK
5747,"I've always ordered to-go whenever I've been here, and the service is super fast. I love their tacos. Great value for the substance.",UNK
5748,"Had super high expectations based on the reviews, but food was bland, service was terrible, and we took our food to go and they forgot the grape leaves-the whole reason I got the veggie spreads plate!  Not cool!  Won't return.",UNK
5749,The food and service is average but I have to give this restaurant 2 stars to compensate for all of the high ratings its gotten. I think this restaurant is so popular because of the great view.,UNK
5750,Their solution to any problem is to wait for a phone update or activate an old phone. They also reset my phone and I lost all my apps.,UNK
5751,Food was good but very pricey. Bad service.,UNK
5752,"Worst place in town! The staff was rude and unprofessional. Miguel \""the manager\"" had a serious power trip. I will not be recommending this place to anyone in the future.",UNK
5753,"I don't visit Souvia often, but each time I go the employees are completely inconvenienced and annoyed to answer questions. With that said, their tea is delicious, my favorites are angels kiss and tropical green.",UNK
5754,"This place used to be great, with unique dishes, yummy breadsticks with special butters and complimentary white chocolate for dessert. Now it's just average, with nice outdoor seating.",UNK
5755,I have found out during certain days that they do make ham & cheese croissants. Yummy.....,UNK
5756,Always finding good deals here.,UNK
5757,"Good  atmosphere, good service, and clean. However the food is(pardon me)  gringo mexican food. Lacking  flavor and kick.  Even the salsa was bland without spice. Not horrible, but completely forgettable.",UNK
5758,"I sort of didn't like how the tables were dirty, and the food was alright.\n\nNot a fan.",UNK
5759,They have balut.\n\nThe other food we had was pretty good too.,UNK
5760,Service wasn't great and very slow.  I ordered a simple plate of steak and potatoes. The steak was over cooked and dry. The potatoes were under cooked and bland. Only good thing on my plate was the vegetable sides.,UNK
5761,"I got a note from someone who works at the show. Apparently they have updated the show and removed all the video content. So, it might be better than when I went last. :)",UNK
5762,Uneventful food...,UNK
5763,Do NOT get Raechel as a teller she is slow. Painfully slow. It took her 15 minutes to do a  1500 deposit that i counted and turned. AND THEN spoke to me as if i didnt know what i was doing when i do the same thing weekly.,UNK
5764,Not an Italian Fan but the seafood fettuccine was good as well as the warm olive appetizer. Nice and close to the hotel so I may have to try it again next week!,UNK
5765,The place has a cute setup but nothing else impressed me here. With all the sushi places that are in  Vegas I'm sure there are numerous better options.,UNK
5766,Dog food! I wish I knew about the bar before a terrible lunch.,UNK
5767,I don't even want to give this place 1 star right now. I am so disgusted by the fact that I saw my server walking over to my table carrying my food and sneezed directly on the plates. I will never eat here again!,UNK
5768,"Poor service (the waitress asked if we were eating dinner, took our drink order, then NEVER came back to take our food order) Overpriced and tasteless food. And on top of that-rude customers.",UNK
5769,"Not much of a selection at any of the stores, it's all junky leftovers from 2 seasons ago.  I won't go back.",UNK
5770,Extremely slow... We waited entirely too long for food.,UNK
5771,"FOOD POISONING. Salad bar. Husband and I both within six hours of eating here, sick for 72 hours, missed work, N e v e r   A g a i n.",UNK
5772,I came here to check out all of the fragrances. I adore all of the Tom Fords colognes and perfumes. They are so rich and decadant. The staff here was super friendly and engaging. What a fabulous shopping experience!,UNK
5773,this is not the nicest big lots in the world but i still like it just the same. it reminds me a lot of ross but they have more sections and different options. most of the time the prices are amazing sometimes its just hard to find exactly the thing your looking for.,UNK
5774,This is my 2nd time watching KA. They replaced the epic top-down action sequence with a poorly rendered CG recording. Was a bit disappointed in that.  Must say beginning was more impressive than the end but still carries the most engaging storyline in Cirque du Soleil in my opinion.,UNK
5775,The atmosphere here is really cool.  Great place to go with friends and to watch sports.  I love their local selection of craft brews.  The wings were good and the fish tacos were nice too.  I will go back.,UNK
5776,"Slowest. Service. Ever. \n\nWe wasted our entire evening there after being trapped for two hours! Food was mediocre and expensive. The staff was friendly enough, but the slow service ruined everything for us.",UNK
5777,Went with three other sushi regulars and one newbie.  All enjoyed immensely.  $45 out the door despite several shared beers and sake.  I'll go back for sure.,UNK
5778,"Over crowded. Over priced. Over dull. \nThis is like Hellywood.. Uhmm.. NO THANKS!!!\n\nIt is pretty though, so... 2 stars... LOL....",UNK
5779,What's to say. Sometimes you just gotta give in to guilty pleasures. All day breakfast!  I get the sausage egg and cheese biscuit without the sausage and cheese. I'm trying!,UNK
5780,"Great food, But patio furniture sucks. Makes for an uncomfortable and dirty kind of feeling. Now I was there about a month ago so I'm not sure if they got new furniture but overall awesome worth another visit",UNK
5781,Great meat and very friendly and helpful service.,UNK
5782,"I was a bit ticked off when we skipped breakfast and waited around for this place to open since we were drawn by the unlimited SUSHI advertised on all the signs.  In fact, they only have tapas now.",UNK
5783,Not impressed.  This place doesnt have alot of stuff and I can never find what I need. I rather shop at Spirit Halloween.,UNK
5784,So good,UNK
5785,"I am disappointed with this place. Seeing all the reviews I was expecting a very good lunch buffet , but the buffet was bad and expensive.",UNK
5786,The employees here need some serious training. They have no concept of customer service. They also have supply chain issues (always out of product and never know when it is coming in). I have tried Marvel a few times and each time the experience got worse. Will never go back now.,UNK
5787,Kylie is fantastic!! Her wash is excellent and her blow dry/styling is one of the best I've seen! Highly recommend,UNK
5788,"Perfect place to get spices, oils and large amounts of rice. O yah they also sell the best naan in the world!",UNK
5789,Two stars cause the salad was crisp. The chicken was terrible. They should use a higher quality of meat. The service was horrible. Somebody please tell me where i can get a good chicken bowl,UNK
5790,"Over rated. Better food else where. Waitress did not bother to refill my iced tea when she brought over refills for my husband and son. My turkey club sandwich - dry. Although I did enjoy the small side of Cesar salad, hence the 2 stars.",UNK
5791,Horrible enough said and they have the nerve to sale chicken and waffles. If I was the food police they would be banded from making horrible chicken and waffles,UNK
5792,"Great for a quick bite. Food is fresh, bar is stocked. Device feels family owned.",UNK
5793,We live in Scottsdale.  We were asked over the lunch rush to wait 15 min for a table.  Mine you....we have been frequent guests.  Poor service.,UNK
5794,Terrible manager with terrible service and client interaction!,UNK
5795,It's quite simple. The food is great! The service is slow! And 98.9% of the time they will get your order wrong!,UNK
5796,"Waiting time: less than 10 minutes (check website before arrival); excellent, friendly, competent staff.  The room was like the arctic tundra.  It was so ridiculously, uncomfortably cold.",UNK
5797,Horrible people OK food. The food is soap but the owner needs a frontal lobotomy. By removing the little midget from his ass. Don't waste your time. Life is to short to go somewhere with no insurance on the Buisness.,UNK
5798,Ok it's Great clips. It's different every time you go but generally the people are friendly and want to do well. If your haircut isn't complicated you should be fine,UNK
5799,"The \""suite\"" was supremely disappointing (at an extra cost) and looks like any dingy motel room.  \n\nThe price is good but if you factor in additional cab fare since you are farther from the nice hotels, you are not getting that much of a better deal.",UNK
5800,"This place was great when Chris and his wife were running it. I got a beautiful tattoo on my foot. Then went back to add more to it, Chris was gone and Tony just messed it up so bad.",UNK
5801,We were completely blown away by the show. Went there with my wife and parents and was worried they may not like it. But everyone had such a good time. Fantastic show.,UNK
5802,"Horrible. The sausage was frozen in the middle, the toast wasn't toasted, potatoes had no seasoning, coffee tasted like soap. Do they ever try their own food?",UNK
5803,great pizza place.. simple and easy.. Plaza has some great places to eat... best downtown,UNK
5804,The service was excellent. Food was hot. It was just your average chicken restaurant.,UNK
5805,I stopped in this QT yesterday for the first time in months. I love the clean bathrooms and friendly staff. There is a large drink selection and it was nice that the machines were all in working order. They have a good food and snack selection. I will definitely be back soon,UNK
5806,"don't like, i ask for spicy not a jar of red chili pepper.  one person wating on 20 tables. you think about how quick you get serve.",UNK
5807,"!Warning!\nSorry, but I have to let everyone know of this place dishonesty:\nThey erase expiration dates of their food products, so be very\ncareful. I saw a woman in the back actually wiping the dates off.",UNK
5808,The food and drinks where great. This place was full of specials from 55 cents wings to happy hour drink specials! The waiter was friendly and helpful. I look forward to coming back again.,UNK
5809,Who has only 2 people working the counter on a busy Saturday?  Answer: Dollar Rent A Car. 15 people in front of us and an hour plus wait is ridiculous.,UNK
5810,Wholeheartedly agree about the extremely poor service at this location.  I've actually been recommending that people go just to see how comically bad it really is.,UNK
5811,"Meh. I wish this place was awesome because it is so close to my house. But it's the kind of greasy, MSG-laden cuisine that is often served as Chinese fare. Portions are good, but the food is just ok. It's takeout-only.",UNK
5812,"I enjoy coming here for a movie or two on the weekdays.  It's not crowded, it's easy to access, and it's clean.  You can't ask for more.",UNK
5813,"I just came in for an OJ and one of their fruit cups, I was in a deep craving of fruits and this was the closest spot to me that Thursday that offered such small craving to-go. The service was okay/good. Could have been better.",UNK
5814,"Good but not great.  The food is consistent just lacks the ? factor that makes you say, Let's have that tonight!  It's standard chinese food fair.",UNK
5815,"Decent prices, great coupons and deals if available. Mango gelati with vanilla custard is perfection for summer heat. Very friendly staff.",UNK
5816,"based on my one experience here it was positive. I used the drive through, the lady at the window was very nice.",UNK
5817,Nice store. Good size but when I went there. The department seemed messy. Especially in the junior section. Not many selections. The only good thing is that it's better than up north and my boyfriend bought stuff he loved and had in stock.,UNK
5818,"We eat at the Nil Bleu every time we are in Montreal. We've always had a good, reasonably priced meal. The food is much better than some of the Ethiopian restaurants in our local area. We've introduced several people to the restaurant and all have been pleased.",UNK
5819,"Cool place, great to see Blue Moon on Tap. Wonderful BBQ's in the summer!",UNK
5820,Wow I can not believe the POOR service I received from John. This place is not worth your time it looks nice from the outside but that's it. If you want to pay for over priced Mexican than waste your money here if not go somewhere that is worth it.,UNK
5821,"Sorry to all my Thai friends but I'm not really into Thai food because I do not like spicy foods and also foods that have too much herbs like cilantro and basil. Whenever I go to Thai restaurant, I pretty much only order Pad See Ew with chicken.",UNK
5822,"best boba i have tasted in town! hate the wait and the service, but love the boba!",UNK
5823,Worst car wash in the world they steal your valuables from inside your car and the managers deny that any of their employees did it even though you know you had your stuff inside right before the wash never going back who ever you are that stole my watch karma is a b**ch,UNK
5824,"This place is nothing special.\n\nYou get many options for hotdog toppings, and the food isn't bad, but it's definitely overrated and there are better places to eat on the strip.",UNK
5825,Crowded bar on the Royal Mile has a decent atmosphere and often has live music.  The back nook behind the bar is a cozy spot where you are able to have a conversation with friends.,UNK
5826,Great donuts and open 24/7.  I love their buttermilk donuts and they have these adorable little filled donut holes.,UNK
5827,I thought that the beef panang was a little weak. The soup needed more tamarin. Still the lunch special was ok,UNK
5828,Servings are very small.  food so-so.,UNK
5829,They will pump your ears with the crappiest music in all common areas including the pool at all corners. A true lack of class.,UNK
5830,"Second chance, bad service, over and undercooked pizza and appetizers. Cops randomly showed up for whatever reason? How is this place open still?",UNK
5831,Went into cici's tonight and they were basically closed at 9 when thw door and website says 10. Hours of operation should be changed to 9 w take oUT til 10...poor customer service and will think twice before going back...,UNK
5832,Ok customer service awesome prices LOVE the price match feature Walmart has to offer.,UNK
5833,"Not sure about 4 star, My friend had a chicken burger, he said it was just ok .My egg salad sandwich was ok ( 4 out of a 10). The waitress was very nice. We wont be back in future.",UNK
5834,Portions are small for the price and burgers are not that great. Service was not good. they shouldnt leave open kitchen to see them messing around while you wait for your food and the place is empty. Many better options if your craving a good burger.,UNK
5835,Salad was fresh and delicious.  Service was prompt. They are open 24 hours which is really nice.,UNK
5836,"Four stars for a hot dog stand, not bad at all.  Had to come try the Char Dog after seeing The Wiener's Circle featured on the Travel Chanel. I can see why their Chicago Style hot dogs are legendary. Counter attendant Daniel was friendly and helpful.A must try.",UNK
5837,Walked out bad service no attention after 10 minutes at table then another ten with no drinks. Trust the reviews don't go,UNK
5838,Brighton is a class act. Their offerings are quality and there prices are in line. The folks here were a pleasant as could be and even offered me a bottle of water as I left.\nMy only complaint is that it's tucked back off the canal.,UNK
5839,"I love the breakfast here! I order a la carte and it's the best. Egg whites, goat cheese and spinach with a side of cranberry-walnut toast is a must try!\nBon App\u00e9tit!",UNK
5840,I have been coming here every month for 5 years to see the same technician. I would never go anywhere else.,UNK
5841,"Of all the Lodges, this one has the best bartenders and servers. All others have left a bad taste in my mouth. This location is awesome and will recommended to anyone.",UNK
5842,Worst dinner in Vegas by far.,UNK
5843,"Pretty nice place, even though they weren't prepared for BCS championship crowd and closed at midnight. Bartenders were at least pretty nice about it.",UNK
5844,"They don't have good personal trainers, and i think its not a professional gym at all .",UNK
5845,Solid hotel.  The SkyLoft suites were pretty darn impressive.,UNK
5846,Great naan.,UNK
5847,Rude bartender\nNeeds to learn how to fix drinks instead of arguing about it...specially when someone in training is making them and he didn't offer to help or fix the matter.....,UNK
5848,Great place for buffet lunch. Unfortunately the same exact food is offered at dinner for 3x the price.\n\nStrangely we were at the buffet and at 315 were told they are ready to close and asked  us to leave.,UNK
5849,Dutch Bros is an outstanding coffee joint.   This Oregon company rocks it in AZ! So glad you are here!  Always great service and great strong coffee. Check em out!,UNK
5850,Purchased a groupon coupon  and was treated as a bother rather than being helpful! \nI would not recommend this place!!!!!,UNK
5851,"In the recently renovated Tropicana, this was a quick choice that seemed affordable. But, the caesar salad looked like it was from Wendy's and my pizza slice was decent but cost $7....for a slice.",UNK
5852,Cool server. The place was full of Scottsdale  douchbags and way to over priced hints all the douchbags. Hey if douchbags is your thing then this is the place for you.,UNK
5853,"Thank you to the Ladies and Gentlemen of this establishment for inspiring me to keep up with my exercise regimen and healthy diet *wink wink*...Also, thank you for adding some new moves to my already hot and heavy repertoire. :P",UNK
5854,Gotta love Roberto's. There always open.  Carna asda buritto wet is yummi.,UNK
5855,One of my favorite stores in Vegas due to it's style and affordable prices!,UNK
5856,"I enjoyed the decor and the bar tender and staff were friendly and attentive.  The food options were somewhat limited, portion sizes were small, and the presentation was so-so.  Overall, the meal was OK, but pricey.",UNK
5857,"Amazing food, service was a little slow for 10PM at night.",UNK
5858,"Three floors, multiple bars, university type crowd, open very late, expensive but hey its a club and centrally located near lots of other night clubs.",UNK
5859,Tiny portions and way bland food. Skip this one altogether.,UNK
5860,"Their selection is absolutely extensive.  The quality and taste are the exact opposite.  We tried about 15 things & only 2 tasted good!  $35 makes it definitely not worth it.  Bottomless mimosas though for $10, i believe.",UNK
5861,"Little pricey but good contemporary furniture and the woman who helped me was really nice and not pushy at all. Good deals during the floor sale.  They also delivered exactly when they said they would, despite a major snow storm.",UNK
5862,Yummy yummy,UNK
5863,The employees seem to hate their lives. We waited 15 minutes before the server even acknowledged us! They need some vitamin D in their lives!,UNK
5864,"Drunk pizza is good pizza but not always. Such as when you realize after waiting for half an hour in line, you wish you called Pizza Hut for delivery service to your room instead. The best part of Secret Pizza is meeting funny and chatty drunk patrons in line.",UNK
5865,Food is good but the wait for take out is always between 45 minutes to 1 hour. I might have to find some other place cuz this is the third time and I don't think 3rd time was the charm.,UNK
5866,The tour took us down south blvd to 4 different bars/brewery's/pubs. It was fun. Not extremely informative but a nice day in charlotte. I recommend looking for a groupon.,UNK
5867,skip unless you like pre-packaged food and rude bartenders,UNK
5868,"It's my first time here, but it won't be my last. Goat cheese french toast is awesome and my waitress was amazing.",UNK
5869,"Three Stars for location.  This hotel is walking distance to all Madison has to offer.  It has a decent hotel bar, never crowded and nice clean rooms.",UNK
5870,Gel manicure lasted 6 days before cracking and peeling. They are con artists with the up charges without telling you.,UNK
5871,I was disappointed the very last time I went here. And it made my guts feel funny =[ not cool...thank goodness it was not a date.,UNK
5872,"Great prices and food. I ordered a pho tai ( rare steak ). They packed it with meat..i felt like more meat than noodles, which is a huge plus! I would totally go again. Must try! \n\nPs. Only cash.",UNK
5873,My Son loves this please great way to beat the Vegas Heat and you can bring your own food.,UNK
5874,"I got nachos and it was layered so high that the cheese on the bottom wasn't melted. Also, I wasn't a fan of the corn mixed in with the nachos. The salsa was nasty.",UNK
5875,"Love their happy hour , pasta's are OK .. very nice environment . Decent customer service , Always come here for a quick bite.",UNK
5876,"The food is the same as as the rest of the franchise.  The service is horrible, go to the concord mills restaurant.\n\nThey don't seem to care.",UNK
5877,Great food and cool vibe loved it. The skirt steak is Bomb! Def recommend that if you go there.,UNK
5878,"Located conveniently on Willy St., its the type of hardware store you expect to see Dennis the Menace running around in.  Small, friendly, and knowledgeable, its a shocking change to the big box places.\n\nMy hardware store of choice.",UNK
5879,"Dr. Rumman is NOT a helpful doctor, and she doesn't answer all my questions. Her whole attitude at the hospital seemed arrogant and least understanding.",UNK
5880,"The food is INCREDIBLE!!!!!  The girl at the counter was very nice and very helpful, however the food took forever and the place was quite uncomfortable.  I would definitely recommend eating there, just make sure you are not in a hurry.",UNK
5881,We've eaten lunch there two days in a row and have enjoyed the choices they offer.  The mango salad is tasty and I tried the turkey cranberry sandwich.  Staff there is very friendly and helpful. The place is clean and they have loads of parking. Nice stop after a movie.,UNK
5882,Sad that there is such bad customer service when the economy is so bad. I hope management knows they're paying employees to play with cell phones and talk on the restaurant phones while ignoring customers. What a shame,UNK
5883,Good modern atmosphere and delicious cupcakes.,UNK
5884,Dinner for 4. Everyone was happy for the most part. My salmon was a little salty. Hubs steak was delish! Everything looked great and our waitress was nice.,UNK
5885,The only good thing I can say about this place is the waitress was very friendly.  The chips and salsa were bland. The burrito was very boring. The carnitas tacos were dry. Nothing interesting or fresh.   Definitely not going back again.,UNK
5886,"Great place for soups, salads or breakfast . I had a huge breakfast here for only $9 and it was only $1 more for a delicious coffee to go with it! The service was great and the atmosphere very comfortable. Plenty of room and big windows .",UNK
5887,Not exactly what I would call a great place to eat. If you want to take your teenager out for a shake or ice cream you may enjoy it :),UNK
5888,"I really like Fresh & Easy.  However, this is not my favorite branch.  They don't have a fresh bakery, and they don't seem to have as good sales as other branches.  But it's still a good market.",UNK
5889,Great place for cheap drinks. This place is laid back and will let you bring your dog in. They have quality beers on tap for low prices. The location is conveniently located by the lightrail. I would give them 5 stars but they play 2 many damn Boston sports!,UNK
5890,"I was seen quickly and I wasn't rushed out. Spa chairs are older, but I got mani-pedi for $34. Staff was friendly, but she cut my cuticle. My feet look great. All in all, I left more relaxed than when I arrived.",UNK
5891,Again  friendly tsa agents! Could this be possible that they are now all being nice. Wow . Le grand e orange is now open inside gateD\nNice fresh food.,UNK
5892,"Being from California, I am pretty snob when it comes to Vietnamese foods.  Noodles Ranch could be the best one in Scottsdale, but it's ok by my CA standard.   Price was pretty decent, and settings are beautiful!",UNK
5893,Salad was missing the main ingredient but the pizza saved the day.,UNK
5894,"This place is completely amazing service was great food was even better!! I finally had the red velvet pancakes and let me tell you it was everything I was hoping it would be, if you are wanting a great experience definitely check this place out.",UNK
5895,Best patio in town.  Only visited once so far.  Food above average and the menu has a good variety that goes beyond basic bar food. Service and the patio were A+.  The place just has a cool vibe to it.  Can't wait to go back.,UNK
5896,I have tried the Frozen Yogurt here. However i don't like it much. its more like Icecream or little bit melted. I like Yogurtland much better. It's not bad at all. However i prefer Yogurtland.,UNK
5897,So glad to have something close to our house. We have gone here a few times and has been good! We have ordered the club sandwiches and blizzards. Everything has been good!,UNK
5898,"A nice modern place set within the heart of Bloomfield. Very clean, a variety of toppings offerings, and nice staff. Stop in here sometime soon before the weather gets too cold!",UNK
5899,Awful customer service. They were so rude I had to walk out. Didn't seem very interested in serving me at all. I felt like I was bothering them.,UNK
5900,Not the chipotle it used to be compared to couple years back..they are stingy with everything now..I barely come here anymore it used to be 2-3 times a week..step it up you are a big franchise now,UNK
5901,"It was OK. Service was friendly, but slow. Food was OK, but I don't think it was a good value.",UNK
5902,"Sadly, Jolly Bob's is no more  :(",UNK
5903,"the place is a bit run down, and while hole in the wall places are usually great this one is just okay. Food is kinda meh, employee wasn't very friendly, and it all adds up to cost a chunk of change.",UNK
5904,"I had the onion soup and the Pecan Sirloin, but since they cook with wine, and I really hate wine, my steak was ruin, but it was my fault I should had mention I dont like, wine.",UNK
5905,"Not really a burger palace.  You can't add another patty, make your own burger or have different types of meats.\n\nFood is a bit pricey, pretty basic menu and honestly I would rather go to five guys.",UNK
5906,Very filthy floors trash overflowing restrooms filthy and the automatic light turns off to quickly. So go fast.  No seat covers in restroom. \nDOGNUT were ok but a not so favorable experience,UNK
5907,"Horrible General Manager, horrible managers, horrible staff! Can care less about customer service. Never bring my money anywhere near this place ever again.",UNK
5908,We had miserable service this week at dinner. Who hires the staff? The food was sketchy at best. What has happened to this gem of a restaurant? We will be going else where on our next evening out.,UNK
5909,"less than average breakfast joint .\nIf they don't have fresh orange juice , they shouldn't be calling it tutti frutti.\nnever again",UNK
5910,Get the streak frites.  That is all you need to know.,UNK
5911,"The food is delicious and the salsa is one of my favorites around the Gilbert area.  I have not had a bad service experience at this Arribas, though I typically go during busy dining times.",UNK
5912,The food was good and the waiter was nice. I sent back my French toast and traded it out for a cinnamon roll. The chicken fried steak and cinnamon roll is the bomb.defiantly come back,UNK
5913,"My friend got a cold pressed coffee. Good flavor but no almond milk offered? Just soy and cows milk. I find that odd. Also, no stevia or raw sugar. Probably would never go back",UNK
5914,The food was amazing. It was something new that I had never tried before. The taste was authentic and homemade. Other then the taste of the food the most compelling aspect was the friendly waiter. She was very kind and enlighten.,UNK
5915,Katz Deli is indeed closed -- but the space will become a second Postino location.,UNK
5916,$25 all you can eat sushi. Great food and service. But make sure you watch the amount charged on your credit card before you leave.,UNK
5917,It was ok.  Had better,UNK
5918,"Just had a ridiculous interaction with Linda, the owner, over a $7 Groupon coupon. Sad really. There are so many pizza places; she needs to appreciate it's the little things that keep customers happy",UNK
5919,I have a 4 day a week subscription to the Arizona Republic. I never read it but it makes for perfect poop papers in and around my Umbrella Cockatoos' cages!,UNK
5920,Not that good. I've had better burgers at Jack In The Box,UNK
5921,This place stunk like a sewer and was boring we were there maybe 15min. to grab a drink and relize what a waste of time this place was. \n1star for the hot gogo dancer who gave us free shots and 1star because we got in free.,UNK
5922,Food was good. Service was awful. Took 46 minutes from when we bought our food for it to get to our table. Don't go on Saturday nights. Save yourself and drive a few more miles and go to the one in Chandler.,UNK
5923,save your money. fast food has better quality beef. their t-bone is totally missing the tender side of the cut. it is a rip off - and high priced. it is meant for people who do not understand what they are ordering or what they should receive.,UNK
5924,Love your Taco Tuesdays! I go about every week. Servers are always very friendly and food comes out pretty quick.,UNK
5925,"I recently ate there with my family. I had chow fun, my daughter had chicken chow mein, husband got the sweet & sour chicken. i personally thought the food was horrible and it gave us belly aches!",UNK
5926,Terrible service... our waitress was practically ignoring us and she only had 3 tables! One star might be harsh yeah but I wont be spending that kind of money on a place this this again.,UNK
5927,Good drink prices and a good layout that divides bar and showroom. The nachos are pretty decent too.,UNK
5928,Legit club in Vegas.  It was a friday night but it wasn't overly crowded.  We stayed for a few good hours and were burnt out.\n\nLots of tools in the club though.  Eddy Hardy types.  You know what I'm talking about.,UNK
5929,"Great place for a lunch, or as I recently found out...live music on Friday nights to forget about the week that just passed.",UNK
5930,Going to close soon,UNK
5931,Happy hour 24-7... can't get better than that and they have a better sushi selection than RA sushi. I wish the place was bigger. They finally have gift cards and a Pearl Reviews point card  SCORE!,UNK
5932,Terrible customer service. Will never climb here again and have told friends of bad experience.,UNK
5933,"Facilities are not as nice as some of the more upscale golf courses in town, but I go for the \""Cloud Nine\"" mini course - par 3, Irons course. Just $19 bucks 13 holes.",UNK
5934,"Overcrowded and overpriced ! if you don't get a table, it's not worth going in.",UNK
5935,"Terrible service. All waitresses seem to be in training; they're more interested in talking to each other or watching the TV. Most of all, after complaining about to the manager, he didn't seem to care.",UNK
5936,"Food is always good, the service is hit or miss. Fast seating, clean, and good prices.",UNK
5937,"The food was good, but the service was lacking. 5 tables of two people and three servers and did not check back once to see if I needed anything or if everything was okay, would have been nice to have gotten more water.",UNK
5938,"Had a massage and i felt it was expensive for the experience.  Vlean, nice, newish, but just not fantiastic.  Will try again next trip and review again.",UNK
5939,"Friendly service.  Meat smoked on site, very smoky meat, but a bit boring.  Moist and tender, but I felt the strong smoking drowned out natural flavor of brisket and chicken.",UNK
5940,"My husband went here for a haircut after reading the reviews here on Yelp, and we (I say we, because his haircuts rarely get my stamp of approval!) were very happy!\nHe got a short (yeah!) haircut and it looks great!",UNK
5941,This outlet SUCKS.  The only store worth visiting is the Nike Outlet.  That's it.  Don't waste your time here.,UNK
5942,I had the Groupon for this service. It left white splotches in my car (even after it dried) and took an hour longer than he said he was going to. It is in the ghetto and there is nowhere to sit while you are waiting.,UNK
5943,"Over-rated, over-priced pies. The banana cream pie tasted artificial and cost 18 dollars!  Save your hard earned dollars and buy a grocery store pie. You'll feel better about your purchase!",UNK
5944,"nice to get off the strip and be in a dive bar. Staff is nice, music rocks and it's just a fun place!",UNK
5945,We would have given it 5 stars but most dishes were too salty.,UNK

5949,And it's still CLOSED DOWN!\n\nIn fact it's so closed that a Polish restaurant is in that place now,UNK
5950,"I only ever go here when my boyfriend is craving a greasy, tasteless fatburger. I can't stand these things. Like another poster said, they just make me hungry for In-n-out.",UNK
5951,"Casino is decent, pool is fun, rooms due for revamp.. The suite I was in had water damage from hottub in room with furniture peeling apart.  When I called the front desk they said all the rooms were like that. ;o(",UNK
5952,I really like this place.  I am begging the owner to please print some of the specials in English.,UNK
5953,"The products, tools are all the same. I have been using Uhaul my whole life. Will continue to. But no doubt this place has a serious customer service problem. I would strongly suggest you find a different uhaul to spend your money at.",UNK
5954,Excellent for quick meal on the go...,UNK
5955,Good food but had to FIND our server every time we needed anything. Unacceptable when you are paying to eat out.,UNK
5956,Cannot believe this place was on DD&D! Poor service and the saurbratan was flavorless and tough. Will never be back!,UNK
5957,Fun spot for cocktails and a light meal.  Interesting scene.,UNK
5958,79 minute wait. Still here. Yeaaaaaa! Snack bar is only reason for star.,UNK
5959,This place was really gross. To bad there wasn't a zero star. I got the Bobbie because I thought it was creative but it was disgusting. I pulled out a piece of hair and I got a soda. The total was like 15 bucks. It sucks. No recommendation,UNK
5960,"This place used to be really great prior to their expansion.  They are just ok.  The foods never persistent.  Different cooks, several locations = Avg quality.",UNK
5961,The Bun Bo Hue was okay.  This is a food court area.  Do not expect much for atmosphere.,UNK
5962,"Pants are not sorted to size, pants and shirts are mis-labeled for size. After spending 20 minutes finding the right size, we find a 20 minute line, one register open 10 people in line. If we weren't in a jam, we'd have left.",UNK
5963,Not worth $60 a night.,UNK
5964,"I eat here with some regularity.  The staff is always friendly, the atmosphere is great.  I don't love all the sandwiches, but I really like the BBQ sandwich, and the Falafels are to die for.\n\nDeserts are also excellent.",UNK
5965,This buffet sucks dick. Selection was very minimal. Meats were pretty bland. I've had better meals at Hometown Buffet. I only liked the desserts. That was the best part.,UNK
5966,"Bad coffee. The only plus is convenience, if you stayed at the hotel. I'd rather walk to the mc donalds",UNK
5967,I found this on Groupon and gave it a go. It was fun to go something different but I'm not sure I would go back. I didn't find that it was a high level of comedy. I suggest you Try it if you get a discount ticket.,UNK
5968,"If you can get past waiting in a long line, the food is worth it! They have many different delicious desserts, and their sandwiches as quite good as well! This is a place you should try at least once!",UNK
5969,"Love this place! Great happy hour and always such a good vibe! Not to mention one of my favorite bartenders works here! Service is always great, food is always good and I love that it is so close to home!",UNK
5970,They refused to honor a coupon for a free cigar they had published in local Valpak.\nWas told the manager had decided to quit honoring them a month before.\nShame on you.  I won't be coming back.,UNK
5971,Ordered take out and was not impressed. They had charged us incorrectly and the avocado on my salad was bland and rubbery. If that had been my first time eating there I wouldn't be back. It was just a blah meal.,UNK
5972,"Grilled pork sandwich is the best, it is only $3.50.  Pho is great.  But is that price is higher than most places???",UNK
5973,They were helpful!,UNK
5974,"nice decor, but over priced for something mediocre",UNK
5975,"Be careful, this place just had 12 health violations!\nhttp://www.kpho.com/story/23042384/dirty-dining-aug-1-valley-sushi-bar-has-12-major-violations",UNK
5976,"Had the rosemary shrimp, grilled veggies, and the rosemary beef brisket. It was good but there are better places to stop in Pittsburgh. Sit outside and make sure you grab some spices if you want them. It's BYOB too.",UNK
5977,"amazing food, i loved the kobe burger, and the lobster mash potatoes. . . everything was well cooked",UNK
5978,"The healing cocoon that I booked wasn't exactly healing or relaxing.  It was broken.  Fortunately, management knows customer service and provided a full refund.  Enjoyed all the various rooms and relaxation areas.  Not sure I will return with so many options in Vegas.",UNK
5979,"I like it here, it's across my office. It's perfect for lunch, they have a lunch menu both healthy and unhealthy choices. I like their salmon dish, salads and Iced tea. Their muffins are great too. Good service.",UNK
5980,We just had the ice cream and it was great - recommended for a treat.  I think there are about 10 flavors on the menu and lots of toppings.,UNK
5981,"service very,very slow. food not very good. way overpriced. not worth it.won't go back again!",UNK
5982,"Overrated.  Got the breakfast Sammie,   with the \""gourmet\"" bun, turned out to be a regular burger bun.  Egg wasn't seasoned, there was nothing unique about the food.  Plus 7.00 for the Sammie - horrible.",UNK
5983,Great Pizza!,UNK
5984,"I ordered seafood chowfun, schreaded  chicken with eggplant in garlic  sauce , and shrimp  fried rice,  All these dishes were delicious and we're very generous  portions, so I do recommend  this chinese  restaurant. You will not be disappointed .",UNK
5985,"Eh. The food isn't so great here. I like the combo of corn and flour tortilla chips, but that's about it. It's a fun place, but I wouldn't ever choose to go here.",UNK
5986,"I've been to better. The best part are the crab legs. Other than that, its like any other buffet. A little pricey to be like any other buffet. For the price, go to wicked spoons at cosmo.",UNK
5987,Quite possibly the worst food I have ever had at a reputable restaurant. Some food was inedible salty and the veggies had no seasoning whatsoever. Terribly disappointing.,UNK
5988,Have a bunch of messages with people's story's of their problems with this store. Please keep messaging me so we can bring this fraudulent company down.,UNK
5989,30 beers on tap from 30 great brewers.  The cooler has hundreds more in bottles but this place satisfies!  I've been here 20 times for the ale but the service can be weak at times.,UNK
5990,horrible. thank god it was comped dinner still it was not good at all,UNK
5991,Its been an hour since we ordered our food... I came here at 6:45 and its 7:48pm... definently will not be coming back.,UNK
5992,$20 for 4L of beer! Great pre-drinking place! Very nice staff!,UNK
5993,"Food was cold  and mushy fried rice was blah,  soup was good  portions not like other one on cactus. Not something I would go out of my way for.  Beautiful inside though",UNK
5994,Food was very overpriced and not good at all same w/ drinks and no specials or promos this bar needs to be rescued again,UNK
5995,Worst chinese I have ever had egg foo yung was just an omelete and the taste was disgusting never ever go back there again,UNK
5996,"Seriously, no Chocolate or Red Velvet? Come on!!! Second time I've been here when they've had neither.\nYogurtland had Chocolate Malt and another Chocolate variety. I'll stick with them from now on.",UNK
5997,Maybe I got too hyped up about this place but I have to say that I don't see they hype that everyone is talking about.  It was a typical Las Vegas buffet.,UNK
5998,The food wasn't so good for being Chinese food and i know what great Chinese food taste like.,UNK
5999,Descent Taco Bell. Friendly service. A little tiny on the inside but pretty quick. Frequent it enough and have enjoyed it thus far.,UNK
6000,I've been here before several times and enjoyed it with no complaints.  But this time was not very good.  My boyfriend is now massaging the one hand that was skipped during the massage.  And he is doing a better job!  I don't think I will be returning.,UNK
6001,"Drinks were good, especially the Thai Iced Tea, but employees are rude and unfriendly.",UNK
6002,Drinks were nice and strong. Waitstaff was very cool. I felt the food was a bit overpriced for the portions. Nice decor. Not much else to say here. View of Vegas was great though. Good place for a first or second date.,UNK
6003,"I gave their carne asada burrito experience a try... Couldn't even finish half of it, because it was so gross.",UNK
6004,Le midi = All you can eat sushis !,UNK
6005,"Overrated and pricey, with a combination of bland food\nAnd complete lack of service. Avoid this place, unless that\nIs what you are looking for.",UNK
6006,Update: I had to take a couple stars away based on my most recent experience at Thai House...my entree was blander than normal and the mango sticky rice was a major disappointment--the mango had been frozen!,UNK
6007,Service crew is very slow.,UNK
6008,Food was average to below average. I had better at major Italian chains for half the host. You pay for the location. Me and my wife got two salads and two simple pasta dishes for $70 no wine no dessert.,UNK
6009,The food was actually pretty tasty but the service I received spoiled the whole thing.  In this economy I'm not spending $8 on a 6 in. sub to be treated rudely.  I can go to Port of Subs or Capriotti's to the the same quality for less.,UNK
6010,"Been here 5-6 times. It's overrated. Good crust and decent Caesar Salad, but poor service from too-good-to-help employees makes it not worth my while...",UNK
6011,"After arriving at the airport, my husband asked me if I wanted coffee since we had to wake up at 3 am that day to catch the plan.  Of course I said yes since it was free.  I ended up getting the caramel brulee latte and it was good.",UNK
6012,Got food poisoning here today. I have been here before and have been satisfied. Today though I got the biscuits and gravy with eggs. Since then I have been vomiting all day. Very upset this is keeping me in the house on a Saturday,UNK
6013,"Over $23 dollars for 2 \""value\"" meals and both my husband and I got sick. Don't waste your money or ruin your health.",UNK
6014,"Was about to order delivery,dinner for one, (bf took the car to work) BUT your order has to be over 15 dollars! Guess I'll just have to pick up some other day looks like pizza night :(",UNK
6015,"Airport food.  Overpriced, soggy, not very good ham and cheese bagel.  Blech...waste of my money.",UNK
6016,I like this place.  I eat there if I'm in the neighborhood.  I like their soft tacos and their burrito bowls.  \n\nI would definitely pick this place over Taco Bell.,UNK
6017,"The WAll of Speakers is pretty fresh. \nAll the Girls who work there, look like they do at least 4 days of workouts on their stomachs. It has an open air atmosphere.",UNK
6018,Fast service there today. I was in and out in no time through their drive up. Food was fresh and hot and very good.,UNK
6019,Last few tries have been more hit and miss.  Difficult to order and food quality has been off sometimes.,UNK
6020,"Native New Yorker seemed like a place that would have awesome pizza.  We had pizza, wings, salad, and some beer.  The best part of the meal was actually the salad.  The pizza tasted fairly plan and very greasy.",UNK
6021,Love their lunch options - always busy but well priced and yummy!!! Good to go for casual dining - pretty authentic Thai - just about everything on the menu is good.,UNK
6022,"Went today for the first time.  The massage experience with Christine was great, however, the hard sell for membership after was a bit stressful. It killed all the the good work of the therapist!",UNK
6023,comforting in the midst of quiteness!!!,UNK
6024,Beijing noodle went downhill after new management took over. Texture of noodles tasted not as good as before. There is no more live show of noodle making. So do not expect that if you read it from old reviews.,UNK
6025,I LOVE this Harris-Teeter. I make a visit there every Saturday. The staff is friendly even though they are mostly college students. The deli never disappoints and the produce is very fresh.,UNK
6026,This place used to be a solid sushi choice however the last two times we have ordered take-out it has been a disappointment.  The fish has been sliced ultra-thin served over excessive rice.  It comes off as they are struggling and trying to cut costs.,UNK
6027,"The pizza on the buffet line is good, but not  always stocked up.  Too much wait time for replenishing.  The area dedicated for the buffet area is too small to service their customers.  They could improve their buffet by adding a salad bar.",UNK
6028,Wish I could say more....Have had better sushi.,UNK
6029,"The fresh berries, yogurt and granola parfait was excellent.  Their standard eggs/hash browns/meat was good too. Nice ambience and good service.",UNK
6030,Helpful and friendly staff on the phone I was looking for balloons but they did not have helium the staff member provided a close alternative,UNK
6031,"Really good, cost effective specials and the steak was amazing",UNK
6032,Great restaurant! It really is nice to look at and the food is great. My friends and I have stopped in just to chat and soak up up the atmosphere over some chips and shirley temples!,UNK
6033,I'm holding off in writing this full review until I hear from the owner or someone else whom is able to make me feel better about giving this place more of my money...,UNK
6034,"Decent service; the people were nice but $70 for 7 shirts and 1 pair of pants is just obscene - don't waste your money, there are other dry cleaners who will do just as good of a job for half the price.",UNK
6035,"Ew, never again.",UNK
6036,Do you like a large selection of non-traditional beers? Then I say YES! That is all - check this place out.,UNK
6037,"Ending afternoon in old Montreal, Vallier was a nice surprise. Window seat, good jazz, tasty cheese plate with excellent small French rolls. Relaxed clientele, all enjoying themselves. Casual, comfortable decor, a favorite spot.",UNK
6038,Not bad for a quick stop to fuel up. One slice usually does the trick for me. Nice variety of slices most of the time.,UNK
6039,"Don't expect to be full once you leave.  The portions are small and the prices are high.  But, the quality of food and the good service made up for it. We tried most of the recommendations here on Yelp and it did not disappoint.",UNK
6040,"this place is a big joke, why do people go there?? big line?? lol woowww  \n Service is slow, slowwwww. 40min to order drinks, and i tip 40%, your loss sweetie.",UNK
6041,So apparently the food was horrible according to 4 people so i know i wont be back for food even though the gravy cheese curd fries looked yummy enough,UNK
6042,"Sub-par food for the price (or any price, really). Bad service.\n\nI can't think of any positives about this place other than it's closed to the sports venues downtown.",UNK
6043,The music is WAY to loud. You can't even hear yourself think much less talk. No selection of sizes. Clothing is cheaply made and overpriced.,UNK
6044,"If you like atmosphere, this is the place. If you like taste.... Well I would rather go to 808 tapas. Everything taste the same and I never been still hungry at a ayce.",UNK
6045,"Good BBQ place, definitely give the Apple Pie Moonshine a shot.",UNK
6046,Great service friendly staff. Portions are huge. Food is well prepared and tastes good. Already looking forward to the take home and we are just leaving the restaurant.,UNK
6047,Huge T-Bone Steak for $9.99. Its was pretty good. I tried my daughters pancakes and eggs and pretty damn good too. Been here 3 times around 10am and there was no line. All I have to say is Great service and food.,UNK
6048,Best Italian in Madison. I recommend trying their seasonal vegetable dishes. It's a very nice restaurant where the staff are not snobs. Still can be a place for causal dining.,UNK
6049,"A little pricey for what you get.  I got 3 dozen donuts, and it was $40!  Yikes!  Maybe they deserve 2.5 stars.\n\nI do like the NAME of the place, of course.",UNK
6050,"Food was good, but the service ruined it for me. I dont know if the young woman who helped me at the drive through was having a bad day, but she was rude and basically threw my food at me. I do not feel like going there again anytime soon.",UNK
6051,Very long wait for a mediocre pizza. \nNot worth the hype. Definitely had better pizzas elsewhere including Phoenix. Grimaldi's in Scottsdale have way better Margarita pizzas.,UNK
6052,"The BEST fries in town! All other items are very good, everything is fresh and hot which is a plus @ a buffet. Been here for over 20 years, they must be doing something right.",UNK
6053,This place is dumb.  Over over priced - dont go trust me.  Burnt - ass coffee for $5.,UNK
6054,It's closed now. \n\nLos Favoritos took it's place.  A significant improvement.,UNK
6055,Blah barf worst burgers.,UNK
6056,"Great food.  Service is awful and rude!!!!!!!!!!!!  I always go here for brunch, but after my last experience I don't think I'll be back!",UNK
6057,Always find great sales and when you add your Macy's coupon it makes it even better.   I have walked out of the store sometimes when everything is said and done with items 80% and up off. Sales staff has always been curtious and helpful.,UNK
6058,Great cake and desserts only wish the price was less.,UNK
6059,Worst Mexican food I've ever had. Try taco's el Gordo.,UNK
6060,Food was okay. Over priced for the amount if food you get. Ordered cheesecake and was told it was frozen. Had to take it home in a to-go box to let in thaw out. Service was okay.,UNK
6061,This is a great pit-spot!! Great place to get ready for The ultra-Violence... They have a variety of slushies that are packed with liquor-y goodness.,UNK
6062,Nothing spectacular. But the food is good. For the price.i had the teriyaki beef. It was tender with just enough sauce.,UNK
6063,Came early; so didn't have to wait long for dinner. I probably didn't eat enough to make the buffet worth it for me.  I don't even recall what I ate that night but I was impressed by the huge dessert section.,UNK
6064,4.0/5 - Pork Belly Tacos\n3.0/5 - Grilled Salmon Salad\n3.5/5 - House Smoked Salmon Sandwich\n2.5/5 - Rice and Beans - flavorful and not dry,UNK
6065,These guys are rip off's!!! Will try and illegally tow you! Do not use them!!!!! Beware of this company,UNK
6066,"Yummy food. Good Service.\n\nCustom burgers: great\nFat Fries: good\nZucchini Fries: great, and good portion.\n\nKind of a pricey lunch, but great place to try out.",UNK
6067,Good go to for a quick lunch. Everyone always finds something delicious that they enjoy. My favorite is the California Tacos. The boy always gets a quarter chicken and we eat everything on the plate. Great place for quick eats.,UNK
6068,Neat place in Carefree that offers home goods and some smaller knick knacks.   Very eclectic product base at the store. But they have high end prices on most items.,UNK
6069,salad was drenched in dressing I got a chicken Cobb salad and there was nothing but lettuce a few tomatoes and no eggs! it was disgusting!,UNK
6070,I ordered a takeout here today and ordered my FF extra crispy.  Same old limp soggy under cooked fries as usual.,UNK
6071,Dr Fakhouri is amazing and the best but the front desk people are rude and incompetent.  They do not know what they are doing. They need to learn about customer service. They are the 1st people we see and they can lose client because of their bad attitude.,UNK
6072,Food was pretty good. However not a lot of options for the buffet. Service was just ok.,UNK
6073,"Very expensive hotel, but very good service overall.",UNK
6074,"If you want to be ignored by bartenders who think they are way too hot for this place i.e. doing their makeup in the mirror, than this place is for you.... Over priced drinks with exact jiggers??????? Boooooo midtown",UNK
6075,Not very organized. I'm glad I arrived 2 hours early because you know what might happen. It's a small airport but gets the job done. We don't need a palace of an airport just to catch a plane. LOL,UNK
6076,"Beer selection criticised by three troglodytes at the bar.  All encouraged by (female, spectacled, simple) bar staff.  Appears to have went significantly downhill since change of ownership.  Terrible staff, poisonous clientele - I would recommend avoiding.",UNK
6077,They charge an additional fee for credit cards AND DEBIT CARDS. That isn't cool. I really like the place and have been coming for years but didn't realize they were charging extra for debit cards. Uncool.,UNK
6078,Only good thing I like about Raising canes is their sauce..The sweet tea taste similar to McDonald's so nothing new. Also they don't accept bills over $100 beware,UNK
6079,WOW! I should have read these reviews before walking in to this Little Caesars. Appearantly the people running this store don't give a crap about the nasty customer service at this location.  They lost a customer for sure. Never again,UNK
6080,Hash house a go go is a terrible place. The prices are high and the food and the service sucks. It's awful and overrated. All the food is fattening and garbage!!!,UNK
6081,"Tiny pool full of tepid piss water w fist pumping idiots....and its $35 for a Ciroc/RB.\nPass. Liquid @ Aria is bigger, cleaner and has better music and vibe.",UNK
6082,"It took me a couple of tries to get used to it but now I am hooked! JJ's is a fantastic alternative to Subway. I give it 4 stars --with the realization it is fast food. Great, tasty, quick sandwich!",UNK
6083,"Kungpao chicken is the best iv ever had!\n\nFood is great, they are fast, and friendly. \n\nI love this place!",UNK
6084,Absolutely disgusting.  Ive been here before and it was good. I just tried it again and got pad thai. The chicken was old and smelled and the shrimp was overcooked and not cleaned. I will never return and wouldn't recommend it to anyone.,UNK
6085,fun place to hang out for drink on friday and sat nights.,UNK
6086,Bagels are always good. The nova lox bagel was on point.  The low cal egg white sandwich was fine but not remarkable. Nice casual way to spend a Sunday morning chilling with the family.,UNK
6087,A good place to go if you want to get away from tourists in the old montreal area. It has vegetarian food with is definitely a plus. Also the music is good.,UNK
6088,"bad, bad, bad.  the chow mein was edible and that is literally the nicest thing i can say.",UNK
6089,"Had the Walu (Hawaiian butterfish), and was excellent.  Sushi was good, my friends said best ever, I thought more average.  Rock shrimp appetizer also average.  Wait staff was excellent.",UNK
6090,"I ever tried Vietnamese or Pho before I ate here, and I was surprised how much I liked it. The food was tasty and the derive was good.",UNK
6091,Inexpensive. Some good deals. Lots of regulars. Friendly family owned.,UNK
6092,This is the coolest of the theme oriented casinos in Vegas.  It's cheesy but it works.,UNK
6093,"The food is just eh, but it's fun to go here for some Jewish food. Everybody loves their sliders too!",UNK
6094,"Just had a coffee and cheese Danish from here while staying at the cosmopolitan. Seriously one of the BEST cheese Danish I've ever had, however it is very pricey (but what isn't in Vegas).",UNK
6095,"I cannot understand why this place is so busy. The food is mediocre at best, but the service is absolutely terrible. \n\nStay away from this place if you are looking to have good food and a relaxing meal.",UNK
6096,nice place not the best but def not the worst,UNK
6097,"I would not recommend taking \""dry clean only\"" clothing here. Out of three garments with three different fabrics, all were returned damaged. I had such high hopes for this place. I liked the location and the staff, but will not go back nor recommend.",UNK
6098,"The place was fine, esp for the price. They welcomed my 5yo daughter, and gave her a decent cut (bob) in a reasonable amount of time. Chrissy was our stylist.",UNK
6099,"Great patio and service, but the food is pretty bad. It's hard to mess up guacamole, and they even managed to do that. Come for a drink, but go somewhere else for dinner",UNK
6100,Food sucked!!! Very bland!!! Plus service was very slow. We were there for 45min. Before we got any salad or meals. Shoulda known better than to eat at one of these corporate owned garbage places. What a waste of $100 !!!!,UNK
6101,Came here for dinner on our first night in Vegas as we were staying in the PH and we definitely learned our lesson. The portions were tinyyyy and items were overpriced (even for Vegas). Will not be back.,UNK
6102,Poor service on weekends AND my to-go order was messed up.  Will never come back here.,UNK
6103,"Our server was great and the food came out fast, but I just don't think I'm the kind of girl who likes a hot dog on naan bread. Hot dog was good, ingredients were fresh, but I don't think I'll come back due to my own preferences.",UNK
6104,"Good variety of delicious smoothies!\n\nTip:  You can order your smoothie \""skinny\"" which means they don't add sweetener. According to the nutrition guide, this saves you 100 calories and 24 grams of sugar.",UNK
6105,"great food, great service, awesome slaw!!",UNK
6106,"Yes, it's fast food but very good! I love the cheddar butter burger, fries and of course a concrete mixer! The only complaint about this location is they always mess something up with our order in the drive thru.",UNK
6107,"I've been here twice and both times have been pretty good.  It's a very friendly atmosphere with good service and the food is fresh, good with nice presentation.  It gets a little loud, but still a friendly atmosphere.  I would definitely recommend checking it out!",UNK
6108,One of the worst Asian restaurant.  The server smelled like a rotten fish.  Dont buy their Pho.  Its not real pho and the food is over priced.,UNK
6109,"I love to go to BJ's with my friends, great fun!",UNK
6110,We drove there from Vegas and found out it was $70 to look at the grand canyon. We left. Not paying those prices!,UNK
6111,Discount after 10pm which is great for me =) I eat late.,UNK
6112,Their appetizer fried wonton is the best! it has that zesty sweet taste to it which I love! I would say its the only thing i order from the appetizer menu. Haven't tried it yet?! i suggest you should!,UNK
6113,So glad I stayed close to home and skipped Panda Express. General Tso chicken made with sll yummy white meat. Will visit again,UNK
6114,"Great location with fast service and cheap drinks ($5 for wine and beer). \n\nI pre-gamed here while I waited for my friends to join me for the Madonna concert, great idea since the drinks in the concert venue were $16 a piece. Ouch.",UNK
6115,"Small but cute. The wait staff was nice and the place is clean. Good pizza, pasta needed to be drained a little bit more but the marinara sauce was flavorful.  The place was real hot however.  Not too comfortable.  However, it won't stop me from trying it again.",UNK
6116,Pulled a nail and repaired my tire in 30 min...didn't even charge me.  Guys here were pretty nice!!!,UNK
6117,HORRIBLE! Got a manicure and polish started chipping after just a few hours! The worker that did manicure seemed uninterested and annoyed to be there while rushing through manicure. Overall poor experience. Will never go back,UNK
6118,"One of the better places for all you can eat. Quality is good considering price. Rolls are not as crazy as I like, but the price is right.",UNK
6119,"Located in a mall, and looked good. Service was a bit slow. Not terribly friendly. French toast was dry, over cooked, and thin. Not very good. Expected more,  but served its purpose. Quick, inexpensive, and average food quality.",UNK
6120,"Most good Vegas hotels have very decent poolside cafe food. Misters help provide some relief from the heat. Salads are delicious with good portions. Other hangover food also good portions (hot dog, BLT, etc).",UNK
6121,"Wasn't able to have a full dinner here, but had great appetizers creamy tempura shrimp was delicious will definitely come back. Drinks were just ok.",UNK
6122,"I really liked this location.  Great view of downtown on the patio, it is located in a great spot, the food is great, the service is really good & most importantly, they have a good selection of beer.  I recommend the Blacksmith (Guiness & Smithwicks).",UNK
6123,Horrible!!! My daughter received a splinter from the wooden chair. The wings were freezer burned and undercooked. By the rudest staff on the planet. Dank dark and distgusting.,UNK
6124,"Nice place for some pre-flight drinks! I can't speak for the food, but the menu looked very nice! The prices were very reasonable especially for an airport bar.",UNK
6125,So disappointing. Food wasn't even 'just ok'. In a city of great restaurants this one isn't even acceptable. Don't waste your time on bad food at three times the cost of much better places.,UNK
6126,"Great location and good atmosphere, but over priced and the food is nothing special at all. The salads looked ok, but the sandwiches are boring - I even had to asked for some kind of dressing for my turkey sandwich after they brought it out dry. I would've rather made lunch at home.",UNK
6127,"Service was good, Food was really good! Looking forward to going back.",UNK
6128,"Really good food at the given price. If you're looking for cheap, good Mexican, this is the place to go to. Will definitely go back.",UNK
6129,"South Park is a really nice, really fancy mall, but I generally hate being there. It's the kind of mall that requires you to be dressed up to shop there. If you just want a normal mall with all the normal stores, check out Carolina Pavilion.",UNK
6130,"I have been there a couple of times.  Nice space, huge you could get lost in there and I have.  The parking totally sucks! Such a big place little  lot.  Food and drinks are goood",UNK
6131,POOR service!  Long Wait for Drinks!,UNK
6132,Great food! Clean. Basic. Friendly staff and reasonably priced. What more do you need?,UNK
6133,Quite a spread.  This place has a little of everything.  The real amazing part is that everything is excellent.,UNK
6134,"I like this spot because it's not in a casino and not packed so you can find a great seat. This time though, the floor was sticky and had not been swept. :(",UNK
6135,"Came here today just to get a massage, and sadly it is no longer at this location.  I'm not sure if they have relocated, or simply gone out of business.",UNK
6136,Not real BBQ...just over cooked meat.,UNK
6137,"If you like over cooked tough as leather ribs, rubber skinned chicken and instant mashed potatoes this is the place for you. Otherwise you'd do better to go to a vending machine.",UNK
6138,ITs a bit expensive than most but has a good variety of items.,UNK
6139,"I got the Sicilian sandwich, it tasted alright. I wasn't jumping up and down at the cost, subway is still cheaper. Food was made fast, the outside seating was cute.",UNK
6140,Pretty dirty. The buffet has on ok selection. Has bad pinal county health inspections.,UNK
6141,Perfect restaurant! Has a mixture of food to satisfy everyone. Burgers are great and the sushi is fantastic.,UNK
6142,To get more detailed I would give it a 3.7. The highlight of this place are the drinks and desserts. The meals are above average but it wasn't as great as I expected it to be.,UNK
6143,"Awful pizza... I bought a $4 slice and it was terrible. Salty, dry, and burnt. No good.",UNK
6144,"Small, but had the basics with good quality",UNK
6145,"I wouldnt waste your time or money... It really is just mostly prints, and sculptures... The history, etc. is all stuff  you can read online, etc and get just of good an experience.",UNK
6146,Still excellent service and greeting from Therese. Great value. Great portions.,UNK
6147,"The French toast, oddly pancake style, is to die for. Also great to eat the ethnic food in the evening when available.",UNK
6148,"No higher than two stars. Service friendly. Food expensive, yet very basic. No wow factor here. Chart House a better choice. Medium crowd, yet they put us right at tables next to one another limiting privacy.",UNK
6149,Not a bad place to get a drink before a flight.,UNK
6150,The wait at the Pharmacy and Customer Service desk is always outrageous.  They need to staff better on weekends. Plus the Pharmacy needs longer hours.,UNK
6151,"Good Car Wash.  It was quick and clean.  The pre-sprayed the wheel wells and pressure washed some of the harder areas.  The cost was reasonable. Nothing broke on my car going through it, so it gets a A+",UNK
6152,"We went here for brunch. Their selections were decent but there weren't as many options as other places in the area. For the price though, it was well worth it. Prime rib was great; they actually had medium rare. Omlet bar hit the spot as well. Service was good.",UNK
6153,"The rooms are good sized,  and well decorated. The beds are kind of hard, and there were not enough pillows for my taste. The staff is professional and helpful.  I'd say this is a 4 star hotel at a 3 star price. I would stay here again.",UNK
6154,I've eaten a lot of burritos in my day. That was hands down the worst yet.   Shameful,UNK
6155,"I had ordered a bowl of pork.  The meat was cooked to perfection, and filled half the plate.  The other half was carbohydrates (rice).\n\nI will be nice to get a greater proportion of meat than rice.",UNK
6156,Not bad at all. Liked that we had Paris next door and we were able to go from one hotel to another. Just about smack in the middle of the strip. \nWe'd stay there again.,UNK
6157,"My daughter and I shared the babaganouch, cheese egg rolls, beef lula and chicken lula. We really enjoyed the appetizers but were both disappointed with the beef and chicken. The texture was mushy & fatty. Overall, cute & clean but I would not recommend the proteins.",UNK
6158,"Read the other reviews, and I agree with all of them. I've had good and bad meals there, BUT it is the only place for an Apple pancake. Don't order anything else. Skip the extras and REMEMBER to bring cash.",UNK
6159,"So just an update, she did contact me and say that she had an unexpected death in the family, so hence the no communication.",UNK
6160,"Had the Carne Tacos. It was pretty good. Their beef had some seasoning to it so it wasn't bland.  The service was nice and there's a self serve salsa table, which I love.",UNK
6161,"Better pizza than any chain.  Better pizza that you would get anyplace other than NYC or Jersey.  BUT, why go here when just up the street is Napoli?  Mineo's has the rep, Napoli has the better pie.",UNK
6162,Pretty confusing AIrport.   I still like SFO the most.,UNK
6163,okayyishh.. Not a lot of variety for vegetarian. Have had much better mexican food!,UNK
6164,"Very good food and wine, friendly server, and a great view of the fountains at the Bellagio.",UNK
6165,"Not surprisingly, it appears this place has closed down.\n\nWorst. Service. Ever.",UNK
6166,"barely empty on a Saturday night. $10 cover in vegas is alright I guess,just went there for some hookah n drinks. Hookah is pretty decent\n\n\npregaming here is cool but not the best spot  if you wana dance and have fun.",UNK
6167,"Sorry but after seeing the bathroom, I will never eat here again.",UNK
6168,Place is nice. Food is good. Ordered the roasted half chicken. It was superb.  It had a crunchy skin and was well spiced. Bartender was a good wine selector. Service was well oriented. 4 stars due to a higher price.,UNK
6169,"Store is convenient, However I wasn't provided with any options for shipping a package. And was just told the price of what I needed to pay. If I wanted bad customer service I would've gone to the post office. Probably would've been cheaper, too.",UNK
6170,Good deal on happy hour- but service absolutely sucks. Finished a drink waiting to order food.,UNK
6171,"Friendly service, great atmosphere and generous portions. All in all this is a great place to eat.",UNK
6172,They don't serve fresh food. Their buffet is probably the worst I had in USA in recent past. Place and decoration look good.,UNK
6173,"Place seriously SUCKS! Now the people serving are sooooo sweet! But the place is small and tacky, but then again we are talking about Flavor Flav here. Everything was just okay, I definitely do no want to go there again.",UNK
6174,overcrowded. overrated.,UNK
6175,"Snobby golf course. Overpriced. Lots of golf courses in the valley that are much nicer and less expensive. No GPS, the course is not well maintained. The ranger has a power trip. This course is a novelty and that's about it.",UNK
6176,Very good for with large portions. Worth the money.,UNK
6177,Customer service,UNK
6178,"Only reason I liked coming here as a kid was to go to the seafood section and mess with the live crabs. I get them tongs and just mess with them. cruel, yes. fun? what else was there for a kid to do in a store",UNK
6179,This place is pretty good but be careful if you have tinted windows because they messed up my drivers side tint,UNK
6180,Didn't have correct vehicle that was reserved,UNK
6181,Dont bother. It once was a good place. But I was so dissapointed.  Why waste the money opening a new and or new place and foget the food. No regard to detail. Did you forget that you sell food FOOD for a living.,UNK
6182,Not happy with this company at all. Would not recommend. I cancelled after two weeks.,UNK
6183,"S-L-O-W ...there for Sunday brunch ..place was not at all packed, yet we waited about 45 minutes for our food.  Service wasn't good either ..food was decent, not spectacular ...probably won't go back to this place ..",UNK
6184,"I am not sure why this market has such high reviews. In my opinion, it is similar to every other Asian Market in the Phoenix area. I agree with other reviewers that the large amount of empty space is off putting. The customer service could definitely be better. The prices are fairly average.",UNK
6185,This walmart was really icky. And it made me go bazerk! There were zero cashiers and 50 people trying to buy their products. I had to wait in line for over 30 minutes just to buy my tampons.,UNK
6186,"Try the grilled pork sandwich, or was it roast pork? I can't remember, but it was really good. However,  I did not care for the Vietnamese stuffed bao or bread.",UNK
6187,Hmmm not as good as it used to be.,UNK
6188,"They're front door was opened and i walked in  5 minutes before they open at 12 noon i guess is when they're open for business.\n\n employee inside said  sorry we're not open,  Why is your front door open then.",UNK
6189,"I was so upset when I paid 35 bucks for a tiny Sake (large) I kinda hated the place then on. In LA fine dining the same size is less than half that. On principle, I would never return, regardless of food or service quality.",UNK
6190,Not bad. Authentic Jalisco style. I would come back.,UNK
6191,"The closest thing to Steak n Shake in AZ. I had the pizza burger, it was okay but not fantastic. I will go again soon, but for now they get a solid 4 stars.",UNK
6192,"Delivery is super fast. If you think you can jump in the shower after you call in your order, you'll end up answering your door in a towel.",UNK
6193,"This store is horrible. Waited 20 mins in line for a return and had my receipt,  they gave me the lowest dollar amount available and we're extremely rude to me. Will not shop at Macy's anymore. Dillard's is 100x's better!!",UNK
6194,The worst place I have ever been. The service was horrible and the food was even worse. If u are someone who values customer service this isnt the place for you.,UNK
6195,Worst dimsum I have ever eating.  Receptionist has horrible attitude.  The guy I think is the owner.  We had 16 people and they refused to put 2 tables together.,UNK
6196,"Slow service, didn't take my Yelp coupon, Food was good. Very nice atmosphere, but I barely ever saw or heard from my waiter. I would not recommend if you don't have a lot of time to eat.",UNK
6197,Don't be afraid when you walk into the dimly lit space that mimics the feel of being in a coal mine.  Cornish Pasty Co offers up a wide variety of pasties that are very good.  I think this my new spot for lunch on my way to the airport.    Good beer too.,UNK
6198,Great Atmosphere... and the service was great! The lady behind the bar was very friendly! We will definitely be back! I have a date with the oxtail risotto!,UNK
6199,"Food is disgusting, Drinks are expensive , the manager is rude and the bartenders overcharge to make extra money. They have no AC.",UNK
6200,"Love the food. Some of the best, if not the best, Italian food in PHX. A bit on the pricey side, but portions are generous and Nick's has a great variety.",UNK
6201,Ok hotel in a non-descript locale.  The hotel itself is very dated.  I would look for other hotels unless you are using point like I was.,UNK
6202,"The auto-generated email saying that the owner would contact me was a complete lie. No call. No email. No anything. Well, it's cool... There are other choices out there.",UNK
6203,I will not even try this place due to them putting flyers on my door more than once after I have told them to stop. They tape it over the lock so I cant get in without moving it.,UNK
6204,"Its Cheesecake Factory....been to one, you've been to them all.",UNK
6205,"I love the hazelnut latte here! There is almost always a line, but they are really efficient and move the line fast. \n\nI only had the hazelnut latte here, but they have tons of options and ice cream too!",UNK
6206,Great seafood and wine. Very helpful and knowledgeable staff.,UNK
6207,"Great food, great wine list. Specialty wines by the glass.",UNK
6208,Great food but slow service.,UNK
6209,"I was a walk-in and they were able to squeeze me in.  Atmosphere was nice.  The ladies were very friendly.  I received a mani, pedi, and eyebrow wax.  I am very happy with the results.",UNK
6210,"Came here because the original Pancake house we normally come to was torn down since out last visit. Great service, and great hash",UNK
6211,every thing people say about the service is true. horrible...,UNK
6212,Egg roll-not very good. No brown rice and the sesame chicken was too sweet with one broccoli stalk!!  So go down the street to one of the other places. It was cheap so I did get what I paid for!,UNK
6213,"Worse pizza ever.. Worse service ever. Gave it a couple of chance. Never ordering again, especially after giving them an order for a dozen pizza for a lunch meeting and all pizza were gross and undercooked. And the owner is the most arrogant, nasty person.",UNK
6214,"Try them for the first time and it was pretty good, my kids love the chicken tender. Service was fast and friendly. Everything on menu are bar food.",UNK
6215,The food is okay but I think the habit or burger city Grill is better. You're paying for a name.,UNK
6216,Walk on by. Service is hell. Whom ever manages this place should fire the woman working there. Bad bad service!,UNK
6217,I was excited to try this place because of all the yelp reviews but according to the waitress there isn't any vegetarian options on the menu....WEIRD??,UNK
6218,Stayed at the Mandalay Bay for the weekend came to Starbucks 3 times and all 3 times they're was some kind of drama.  These ladies don't give a shit.  Prepare to have a coffee with a side of drama.,UNK
6219,"Worst customer service I've ever had. I would never go here again,  they are rude and treated me terribly.",UNK
6220,Great place to eat/order to go a quick shawarma. Its a family owned restaurant and the food clearly shows that. I like it!,UNK
6221,"I didn't even make it to the doctor, the staff was so incompetent I couldn't bring myself to trust the doctor with anything.",UNK
6222,"It was authentic, although a bit over spiced. Service level was low to average, food quality and quantity was good. Overall it was a miss, but I went at closing (9:30p), so I might try it again next trip.",UNK
6223,The Place: Hip Decor\nThe Service: Not So Great\nThe Food: Blah\n\nBetween the Food & Service... I'd have to say PASS!!!,UNK
6224,"I can see why people could get married here. Its nice, quick and efficient.",UNK
6225,"This place would fair better in a town with fewer food options. The pizza is... ok. The service is plain slow. Location is great and they do have a street side terrace, just don't be in a hurry.",UNK
6226,"Outside of the bad service and the overly rude hostess the food is actually pretty good, but there are better places in Vegas for steak.",UNK
6227,$50 for 3 burgers and a shake. Are you kidding me!!! Shake was not real. Very disappointing when most Ruby's are pretty good.,UNK
6228,It was so good!! It was Noon on Sunday when the first opened. The staff was great and nice. The food was the best. \n\nI will have to go back. iPhone owners should check in with Gowalla.,UNK
6229,"I asked what was best and ended up with shredded beef.  She said definitely better than the pupusas.  Quality of beef was OK and tomato was looking past it's prime.  I dont quite get the positive reviews here.   The tamarind drink was excellent, however.",UNK
6230,Redneck lady bartender ignored me for ten minutes then got snotty when Dahmer and I asked for  draft beers. Nothing on tap. Hostile locals don't like outsiders. We left without ordering anything.  Dahmer was so pissed off that he added it to his 86 list.,UNK
6231,"Always excellent service, whether eating in or stopping in for take out. Love the hot and sour soup and the house special lo mein",UNK
6232,"This place was good, but not super memorable. You'll want to order well in advance if you are doing pickup or delivery since it takes a long time to get your food. I've never eaten at the restaurant itself.",UNK
6233,"cool spot.  food is solid-not El Pulgarcito on Central or Copan over on Sharon Amity, but decent prices and great marguaritas.",UNK
6234,"Moderate beer choices and decent food. Even though this is a very cookie-cutter Irish pub, not a bad place to kick start your happy hour.",UNK
6235,Creamy and authentic gelato but nothing too special.  They serve traditional flavors which are well done but I'd like to see more creative flavors.,UNK
6236,This place used to be much more classy and tons more fun. Will try again maybe on another night.,UNK
6237,2 of us wanted to try this place for dinner on a Saturday evening. We were told 20-30 minute wait when they had at minimum of 12 tables open that we counted. Can't foresee trying this place again.,UNK
6238,Good products and location but bad management. The crew lack of knowledge utilizing their time in between customers during fairly busy time. I was a bit disappointed during my first visit.,UNK
6239,Update: Another star added due to the owner Lew's email to me regarding my visit and awesome service recovery. That's something you don't get very often.,UNK
6240,Too much sugar in everything.,UNK
6241,I just visited this place last night. The food is great. The service was good. I plan to visit the place again soon. Definitely recommend the place to others.,UNK
6242,Worst service I have ever had in Las Vegas. Nachos are good but not worth te extremely bad service or the mediocre house margaritas. Would not suggest anyone go here. TERRIBLE SERVICE!,UNK
6243,"After Boxing class this morning (Shhhhh!) I stopped in for a donut (Really, just the one, Dear!) and loved the customer service I received. Donut was delicious, I think.. I ate is so quickly I don't remember! :)",UNK
6244,"I used to love this place. Now dark, depressing and the food is so over priced and has really gone down hill.",UNK
6245,"An alright icecream shop. Staff was pretty friendly, service was average speed, and prices were also average. I got a smoothie and it was decent-- not the best I've ever had. I'd say it's pretty mediocre.",UNK
6246,Really poor service and way overpriced. You could make much better choices.They do not keep to a high standard of service.\nThe rooms are not worth the money.,UNK
6247,"Great ambiance and service was impeccable. The food is just okay, definitely over-salted. We had the kids cheese pizza (which was generous in size), ceasar salads, the roasted vegetable panini and risotto.",UNK
6248,I eat here at least once a week. The food is great and I also love how they've expanded their menu as of late to include dishes. I am a huge fan of their blackened salmon.,UNK
6249,This place has a nice environment along with good food. Happy hour here is probably the best for any mexican restaurants. What's better than $3 dollar drinks that are pretty exquisite and half off huge appetizer plates?,UNK
6250,Had just arrived in Chandler & this was our 1st experience .Needing more customer service.waited 20 mins for a manager. No one ever showed! Very glad there are 4 to chose from so I will head to another! Lines are always too long!,UNK
6251,"Overall mediocre. Decent sushi, average prices. Went one time..idk if I'd go back",UNK
6252,"Small, casual restaurant with excellent fish, prices and service. I had the grilled sole and it was enormous and delicious, especially with their special hot sauce. I also had a Quebec beer, Boreale Blonde, which was quite good.",UNK
6253,Michelle in sales hung up on me rather than answer my question or redirect me about a phone exchange. Wow.\nVerizon is normally better than this.,UNK
6254,"Food and service were just ok. We left our camera on the table after the meal. One waitress told us she saw it and kept it inside, then the ones inside denied and took it. Have left stuff at many places before, hard to find such dishonesty in North America.",UNK
6255,We live down the street from here and always go to their Happy Hour. Very good prices and great food! I tried the Baja Tacos and my boyfriend always gets the Seared Ahi. Services is always good and staff is very friendly.,UNK
6256,i would recommend this barbershop to anyone looking for a fresh cut.  The directions to get there were kind of weird.  U cut my hair and did a good job.,UNK
6257,I'm not entirely happy with going to this place this time around. Service was awful and had to get the waitress' attention just to ask for something. The food was tasty at the time but now my stomach hurts. I wonder if they even got an A from the health department.,UNK
6258,Nondescript place serving great bean & cheese burritos and tacos.,UNK
6259,Expensive veal scallopini tasted like it was from the OLIVE GARDEN. The service was a little slow. Overpriced.   They need a menu do over,UNK
6260,Nice sandwich shop.,UNK
6261,Way overpriced tiny portions service is very weird there.,UNK
6262,Friendly.  Decent food. Reasonable prices.  I went there for a late night meal and just had a small plate so can't give it a fair review but no complaints\n\nMy friend that went with is a regular and really loves it.,UNK
6263,"High-end brands, rock-bottom prices, and it smells like Marshall's in here... Or maybe it's just the scent of bargains.",UNK
6264,Nice folks..bland food.,UNK
6265,"Just gross.  Not much else to say and really no other way to say it.  If you skipped certain days of chemistry, you may be in for a brief treat as the liquid nitrogen works.  Otherwise stick to regular old ice cream and enjoy what you eat.",UNK
6266,Very nice clean place.  Got a Pedicure and was there less than 30 minutes.  $45 + tip.  Too expensive for what it is.,UNK
6267,"The food is actually fairly mediocre.  But with an endless supply of buy one/get one coupons they distribute, it's one of those \""why not\"" sort of places for a breakfast for two.",UNK
6268,"average food and service in my opinion.  I eat mexican food regularly, in So Calif. and this is not exceptional.",UNK
6269,Food was good.  Service was mixed.  Wierd interaction with a bartender who said the place had nothing to do with San Francisco.  All the marketing in the hotel seemed to lend itself that way.,UNK
6270,"Another great experience here at The Draft House.  Love the Staff, people, and food.  If you have a bad experience here, please talk to that staff.  They are great folks like you and I.  Thank you Draft House!",UNK
6271,Me and my family just ate there when passing through and it was not as good as I expected with all the good reviews...we were quite disappointed. :-(,UNK
6272,"I am a big fan of the dueling piano/piano bar shows and this one is one of the worst I have seen.  The same two women have been there every time, and it's just not good.  The only one worse is the one over in Paris.",UNK
6273,"Empty for lunch. Had a Sonoran burrito, good but the relano sauce was missing. Terrific Cadillac margarita\n\nGood service",UNK
6274,"Not good. Ordered a spicy tuna roll; mostly rice, and cucumber. Quality was not good, sashimi was plain and presentation was terrible. I pulled up at noon, not one car in the lot, I was the only customer....",UNK
6275,"Great music, gets very crowded, but awesome atmosphere. make sure you get there before midnight if you're on the list.",UNK
6276,That is one pretty pizza! I mean PERFECTLY round! Great crust! Good pizza! The staff are super friendly! Try the lunch special it comes with a small pizza and a soda! Not bad for the wallet! Clean establishment.,UNK
6277,Terrible customer service-even witnessed rudeness to a woman in a wheel chair. We ordered one thing-bucket of GRILLED chicken. They gave us fried.   Little wonder why Chick Fil A dominates.   AVOID,UNK
6278,"I live in the neighborhood stop by a few times the food is always pretty good, the service is always pretty bad, it's a great place to go up you want to stop drinking because you will be waiting a while for that refill",UNK
6279,"Only thing good about Sonic is their drinks.\nAny and everytime I've ever tried any of their food items, it has absolutely failed - here, Cali, anywhere. Don't do it - unless you're super thirsty!",UNK
6280,Has to be one of the worst drive thru I have been too on a Sunday night Around 9pm it took me 35 min yes you heard correctly 35 min to get some tacos the drive thru only had 5 cars in front of me too that's the worst part,UNK
6281,"Cold fries and best of all, a customer came in and ordered. The table he wanted had some kind of white creamy junk on it. He went and told someone and they handed him a rag. Lol",UNK
6282,Very so so burgers. Best to head elsewhere for a burger. Lots of other options. Limited options. Service could easily be improved. Once at this place was enough. I won't be back,UNK
6283,"It is Hooters, you'll get the same food and beer at every location. They have a great happy hour and not so great food. Good eye candy, and sports on. What more is there to say?",UNK
6284,"Wouldn't come again. The food is so so... The service is good, but the taste is not there. Potato chips are overwhelmed with the blue cheese and the Asian salad with chicken just not there.",UNK
6285,"You get what you pay for here.  For $2.50 per garment, you'll get your clothes dry-cleaned, but you could pay more elsewhere for a better pressing with fewer wrinkles.",UNK
6286,Good late night breakfast. It's a little pricey but it's vegas. Perfect post club food.,UNK
6287,"Great place.  Poutines are awesome!  I am a beer snob and I usually lean towards IPA's, but decided to try the Amber.  It was clean, fresh and one of the best tasting draughts I have had in a long time!  Service was top notch",UNK
6288,Awesome produce Awesome Meats horrible horrible horrible lines. If they got their register situation figures out I'd give it 5 stars.,UNK
6289,Been here a couple of time order take out and sat on the patio for lunch... great place... the patio is a hide away Cove... great for lunch... lunch special are great!!,UNK
6290,"No clothes here yet, no need to go in!  \n\njust home and furniture, waste of what it could be!",UNK
6291,bought shoes and then exchanged them for diff ones.  pro tip:  clean them before you exchange them.  it'll save you a lot of hassle.,UNK
6292,"Mediocre. Better than Five Guys, not as good as In n Out.",UNK
6293,Pizza is ok pasta ok wings ok salads ok \nService sucked one of them was mean to my sis when she worked there but she doesn't anymore. Enjoy if your going,UNK
6294,Yuk. poor food and even worse service.,UNK
6295,I'm glad I had a BOGO coupon! I will give this place another try if I have another coupon.  08/24/2013 Update - I have yet to return.,UNK
6296,Their menus are fun.\nBut I guess they aren't that fun.\nUhhh...where's my pizza?,UNK
6297,Good pizza for $9.99 two slice of pizza and drink for $9.99.,UNK
6298,"Horrible. Service is slow, drinks don't come close to the pic and food takes a long time.",UNK
6299,Great for drinks after a long day of meetings and in the morning the breakfast  offers traditional morning fare with speedy service. \nO\nI recommend the duck confi eggs Benedict or the croque madam.,UNK
6300,I would do anything for the ribs at this place.  Falling-off-the-bone flavorful and tender goodness.  \n\nBest ribs I've EVER tasted.,UNK
6301,Food was good but service wasn't too great. I was there when there were barely any customers so there was no excuse. The waiter didn't seem like he cared and rude in my opinion.,UNK
6302,I agree with rw from Scottsdale. The fish and chips were bad. My fish was way overdone and the fries were soggy. My friend's fish tacos looked much better. Not a big fan of fish tacos but wish I got those instead.,UNK
6303,"I loved the ambiance. Well decorated and fancy white table cloth. \n\nI ordered the veal, but wasn't that impressed with the lunch prices. I would try other options next time for sure.",UNK
6304,"Nice atmosphere, friendly and EXTREMELY fast service.  Sadly, I've gotten better food at a drive-thru.",UNK
6305,"If I can add a half I totally would be at a 3.5 on this place.  The Mexican food is probably the best I have had in Phoenix.  The price is very good.  The service was fair, skip the guac but I would recommend two magaritas.",UNK
6306,Bartender on verge of being rude.  Very crowded.  Good beer selection and cozy environment but am not dying to go back.,UNK
6307,"Saw Santana last week in the newly refurbished Joint and was very impressed.\n\nThe place is beautiful, the acoustics are top notch..... I've seen many shows prior to the renovation and in my opinion, the Hard Rock did a very good job.",UNK
6308,"The slowest sonic of my life. Friendly staff, but I was in the drive-through with only two cars in front of me and I was in line for at least 20 minutes. Super frown.",UNK
6309,"Good atmosphere, but food was average, and a bit $$$.  \n\nTry the Lobster Miso.",UNK
6310,"Its Indian-American fusion restaurant.... Naans are good, chettinad chicken is just ok.. Dessert and appetizers are over prized ....",UNK
6311,By far the best AYCE sushi in town. At least in my opinion. You can ask for custom hand rolls that are not ton the menu.,UNK
6312,"Really happy with the quality of wash and with the monthly wash prices, wait times are also usually very short",UNK
6313,SECOND time here and I had food poisoning both times :( love it but I won't be back.,UNK
6314,"The location is great, but the food is just OK. But the place looks nice.",UNK
6315,Good wings and fun atmosphere :)  The rest of the menu is what you'd expect from a college/university pub - but I think most people go here for the wings.,UNK
6316,Convenient location in the casino. Slow service though and sirloin was not that good tonight- lined with a layer if tough fat. Used my entertainment book coupon so that helped and nice that you can charge to your room. We 'll be back but I'll order something different.,UNK
6317,Love the fish and grits! Best in Charlotte!,UNK
6318,Convenience store is located right by the casino so the prices are jacked up.  I glanced into the bar and it looked like a glimpse into the flotsam of humanity.    They sell liquor and convenience.   Sliding to the darker side of humanity.,UNK
6319,A decent Frozen Yogurt place. Basically a clone of Yogurtology but the location is conveniently located near Basha's and CVS.,UNK
6320,A stunning building...\nExams to graduation...\nUni centrepiece.,UNK
6321,"The food was tasty and the service was pretty good. If you're in the mood to try something different, check this place out. The hummus was especially good with the piping hot pita bread. Yum yum",UNK
6322,Average food. The waitress was pretty rude and gave us problems with the Groupon we had.,UNK
6323,Ambience is good. The price is pretty good. The food is good with a decent portions. Malasadas is a must. Have a extra time to wait. Service is not that fast. Hawaiian time.,UNK
6324,Never order takeout on the phone! Great spot for cheap tacos. And the new California heat taco is out if control! Great eats and deals everyday of the week!,UNK
6325,"Lots of variety. Wish they had more sushi variey though.  This buffet is particularly good if you love meat and other protein products as they have quite a selection. Loved the desserts here. Food quality was average.  Overall, a decent buffet.",UNK
6326,"Gross, sketchy, white trash, and filled with drug dealers.\n\nBartender can't make a margarita to save his life.",UNK
6327,"Good wait staff. They have a nice white egg om-let. French toast and pancakes tasty.  This place is very close to the University, and within a mile of several hotels.",UNK
6328,"Non event, not worth the time or the money, just mediocre food.",UNK
6329,"A good selection of beads and much more...love the relaxed welcoming atmosphere from the time you entered. They made eye contact, smiled and made me feel welcome. Definitely will go again.",UNK
6330,"LAME, if you want this experience then go to a grocery store meat locker with a bottle of jack, it will be cheaper and more fun.",UNK
6331,Do not come here if you're a vegetarian. There is literally nothing on the menu and the chef was not helpful at all.,UNK
6332,Best value for hotel on the strip.  Smack dab in the middle of everything so hold on to your taxi money.  Some rooms have prime viewing of Bellagio fountains.  Seems nicer than similarly priced hotels and doesnt attract as many trashy people as them too.,UNK
6333,I occasionally been here in this location. I had bad service all the time. The servers are always in a mad mood and always rude. I really dislike the service at this location. Don't recommend this location.,UNK
6334,"This place is terrible, there food was cold and i had an undercooked chicken it was horrible the quantity on my plate was very low the pricing is crazy too overpriced absolute bad dinner",UNK
6335,Our first time here and our server Matthew was very helpful with suggestions. Omelets were excellent and the potato chips were awesome.,UNK
6336,"The only reason I come here every now and then, is because it's close to our home. Otherwise, this place is known to mess up your drive-thru order.",UNK
6337,"Really disappointed in the food here. Enjoyed our meal at the Gilbert location when it opened and thought this location would be just as good when it opened, but it was super average. \n\nI will go to the other Postinos owned restaurants in the area before I come back here.",UNK
6338,I enjoy this hotel for location and overall feel. Unfortunately the beds are quite uncomfortable and the sheets feel like sandpaper.,UNK
6339,"Waited for five minutes for someone to acknowledge me. Go to Target on Blue Diamond, much more helpful!",UNK
6340,Meh.  Coffee was weak and everything else was average at best. I had heard good things about their biscuits and gravy. While the biscuit was quite fluffy the gravy really wasn't anything to write home about and the eggs tasted weird.,UNK
6341,Clean. Machines well managed. Friendly staff. Downside is it isn't a 24 hour laundromat. Location is within a reasonable distance from home.,UNK
6342,Great coffee & great service.,UNK
6343,"Food was okay, I was expecting more while in Gilbert.  Service was good no complaints there just was expecting a less chain type experience.",UNK
6344,"The other Zipps locations seem to be a lot better in terms of service / food. The service was neutral at best. The onion rings were terrible...dry, cold, and hard as rocks. If this location makes it another year I will be thoroughly surprised.",UNK
6345,The ice is bad. This place is run down.Some of the instructors need to remember that the customer pays money for lessons therefore pays their salary so they should loose the attitude!!! That goes for pretty much everyone that works there.The Ice Den is soooooo much better.,UNK
6346,"Great pizza...but as another reviewer mentioned -- they are a bit feisty. Be forewarned that the slices are humungous, so one might do it if you have a small appetite, like moi.",UNK
6347,What I expect from a robertos. They have good service and good food.,UNK
6348,"HORRIBLE.  My family had a made a reservation before flying into Vegas; we arrived and had to drive to the Fox rental yard to be told that there weren't any cars available, come back tomorrow.  Don't bother making a reservation because it WON'T be honored.",UNK
6349,"Pretzels were good, everything else (including their French onion soup) was not good and expensive. Won't be back.",UNK
6350,Went to order chicken nuggets through the drive through. Found out McDonald's discontinued my favorite spicy/hot mustard sauce. I left without ordering anything... Won't be back. DISAPPOINTED!!,UNK
6351,It is exactly what it says it is - mini golf in the dark! If you like mini-golf then you'll love this! Good fun if you go with a group of people but I can't imagine going more than once.,UNK
6352,It's nice that they serve alcohol here but the food seems really bland. I had the fried rice and orange chicken and really was not impressed. Sorry guys.,UNK
6353,If you can deal with the poor service,UNK
6354,It used to have a bigger selection but they closed the back wall. It's one of the better buffets. But nothing amazing. Dinner is a lot more worth then breakfast. Breakfast does not even have a omelet/pancake station which I thought was weird.,UNK
6355,The buns fall apart so you end up eating your burger with a soggy bun.  Staff does not seem to know what is going on and they are not well trained.  Can't think on their own.,UNK
6356,Great atmosphere! Wish the Outside Upper Deck were open on a more consistent basis.,UNK
6357,Great place. I would give it 5 stars if it were larger (and the lines smaller) and if the greeter/server's stringy black hair would have been tied up. It was dragging in the food as she bent over to put the plates on the table.  But I will be back!,UNK
6358,Very poor customer service. I won't be back.,UNK
6359,"Good French toast, sausage wasn't that great though. Very friendly staff, and I liked the decoration.",UNK
6360,"Good food but so expensive comparing \nFor the food they serve, the service is great the margaritas need to be better although they said it was made from scratch but didn't buy that",UNK
6361,"Ordered their special which consisted of turkey, gravy, and stuffing all on a sandwich. It was good. Not great, but not bad either. I've had better. Had a bag of jalepeno chips and a Newcastle along with the sandwich.",UNK
6362,Well food was fresh and delicious service was way behind the power curve though one of my pet peeves is an empty glass but we had four empty glasses and there were less than a dozen people in the restaurant. O well to many places to go with fresh delicious food and great service than this joint.,UNK
6363,Great place on Sunday afternoon and sitting outside. I'll be a regular.,UNK
6364,its a good quick breakfast place. you cant beat their breakfast special.,UNK
6365,"Used to be so good idk what happened because their chow mein, hot and sour soup, honey shrimp--just everything is disgusting compared to iron chef. I promise you I used to be a weekly customer there. Idk if they got new cooks but everything is not good anymore.",UNK
6366,"I hate myself every time I wind up shopping here. Having to lock up my purse, indifferent staff, high prices....  plus they carry very little sterling and charge through the nose for what they do have.",UNK
6367,Worst burger experience ever. Took forever to get our order (30 mins) and when it did arrive it was wrong. They corrected it ten minutes later and when is got to us the fries were greasy and the burgers were too salty,UNK
6368,Best margaritas in town!\n\nFood is affordable & very delicious! Best chicken tacos I've ever had!,UNK
6369,This place no longer has cheap prices. They sometimes are higher then 7eleven down the street at silverado ranch.,UNK
6370,"Great store. Staff is professional and friendly.  Only downfall, during the summer,  upon entering the store, it smells funky. I cannot describe the smell, just I recommend they clean their A/C ducts??",UNK
6371,"Good food consistently poor service, slow, no one checking on you, no water refills very frustrating.",UNK
6372,I've eaten here about 6-7 times.\nOn a few occasions they can be reasonable.\nBut far too often the wings taste like left overs which were microwaved from the previous day.\nQuality is not important to this restaurant.,UNK
6373,my favorite things at bouchon:\n(*) pomme frites\n(*) lemon tart\n(*) view of the pool courtyard,UNK
6374,This store smells horrible. I immediately walked out.,UNK
6375,"\""I don't know I just work here\"" should sum up the service given at border line. This was the answer I got to a question from the one and only employee we could find in the restaurant. She was impatient with taking our order.",UNK
6376,They no longer have a liquor license. As of 3/7/12! :(,UNK
6377,Way too small. Don't waste your time.,UNK
6378,"Great restaurant! I've never been disappointed. The food is consistently good, and the service is very professional.",UNK
6379,Tried one of their different sushi and the food here is much better but the waitress staff need to be much more organized and efficient! And what kind of professional establishment doesn't have bottled water?\nOr any Cannes drinks besides cheap alcohol?,UNK
6380,"Worst store ever!  I understand how it to be poor but being poor doesn't mean you don't need to have respect.  People pushing, kids screaming & workers lined up washing your car down.  It is dirty and the workers are rude.",UNK
6381,The food was really good. The dishes were kind of dirty. And our service just sucked.\n\nWhy would you give two people three small pieces of bread to eat a bowl full of hummus? I'd only go back if it was for take out.,UNK
6382,"OMG just came out of Fuji for dinner at 845p and Rivergate is running their sprinklers...it's November, shopping center open and causing issues in getting to your car without getting wet.\nMajor fail",UNK
6383,"Let's ignore the trivial stuff - this is a comedy club and what's important is that every person who walked on that stage had me laughing. My cheeks hurt when I walked out of there. I will be back, they are stuck with me now.",UNK
6384,"I was supposed to receive my dress in the mail a month ago.  I have not received in and I'm not getting a response from the store as to when it will arrive.  I have no idea what their products are like, but I definitely will never shop here again.",UNK
6385,"Not for the location but Sprint over all.  HATE IT, HATE IT, HATE IT!  Lots of dropped calls and just plain bad reception.  And this is in the heart of the city too.  Central Corridor.  I wish I could change!",UNK
6386,Super fresh food but the line is too long for a quick-service restaurant and ordering my food was kinda a hassle because the menu is like over your head; it's hard to see.  It's like they tried to copy Chipotle but offer better quality food.,UNK
6387,"For the amount of time I waited and the money spent, not really impressed. People were saying that the quality went down, and now I believe it. I'm not saying that it wasn't good, but it wasn't greater either.",UNK
6388,"Ninny...Pad Thai!  Also, the server was awesome! Very rare you get great service now-a-days...he was awesome!",UNK
6389,Terrible customer service.  Have been going here for many years and will not return.,UNK
6390,"awful, food was not good, people with me got sick and will not go there again.",UNK
6391,"Slow, slow, slow.  Place was a ghost town.  Service was poor, facilities seemed in need of maintenance and repair.  I wonder how long until the Lake Las Vegas hotels change brands again or just shut down altogether.  The golf course looked like they were just letting return to desert.",UNK
6392,"After the change of ownership, this place is horrible now.  It's just too salty!",UNK
6393,Worst place in Old Town Scottsdale. Do not waste your 10 bucks walking in the door if you want actual customer service.,UNK
6394,The finished resurfacing the parking lot last week. The place is starting to show signs that they are spending money on it.,UNK
6395,"I have had several pasties and they were all good. They have a good beer list with huge mugs available. I like the classic rock that they play, and the dive-bar atmosphere.",UNK
6396,No sweet potato fries anymore and $2 for a tea? McDonalds here I come! And their regular fries have changed yet again.,UNK
6397,This place is always very busy at lunch time and I dont understand. They serve high priced super lame cafeteria food. This falls just below fussali for the worst dining option at park central.,UNK
6398,Best tortillas in town! I like the green chile burro.,UNK
6399,I like this place.  I don't get a chance to go very often but every time I go it's always good.  I always have the Seared Tuna.  Great place to sit outside and eat when it is cooler.,UNK
6400,Kazansky's is now closed.,UNK
6401,Great burgers and sandwiches. Had the pastrami burger with sweet potato fries this time. Service was good and it didn't take long for our food to come out.,UNK
6402,"Overall, I recommend. The pulled chicken and it was a little dry so I use extra BBQ sauce to bring freshness to it. BBQ food tends to be greasy so keep that in mind.",UNK
6403,"My juice was delicious,  \nCustomer service here was crummy. Lady was not friendly or welcoming.",UNK
6404,i was qouted a price and after that i paid more...,UNK
6405,"Nice place for casual dining with friends. Good service. A little bit on the expensive side for what you get, but overall a nice place with a nice ambiance.",UNK
6406,"Really good food, service, atmosphere! Pricey.",UNK
6407,"Wast there last Friday. Seats right in front if the stage. The show was good. The headliner, while a bit long, was good. Fantastic service from our waitresses. Will definitely go back.",UNK
6408,Great place to read the Sunday paper and a tasty breakfast,UNK
6409,Good place.  Almost always very busy... Might want to make a reservation.  The chefs don't seem to have a whole of personality.... And they are often times not Japanese at all... But the food is good nonetheless.,UNK
6410,April 9th was the day we had this bad experience.  Very long wait to get a table due to lack of staff.  Waiter was very slow and rude! Only thing it had going for it was that it was open late.  Never again will I be dining at this place!,UNK
6411,This place is a good choice for healthy food that is tasty. They are always friendly to :-),UNK
6412,Can't believe that anyone who's ever had quality sushi would like this place. This place would be out of business back in Cali. Not only is the sushi boring but it's WAY OVER PRICED!,UNK
6413,i would have loved to give more stars but i am not completely convinced. the oysters are tasty but small. i love the fried green tomatoes. my husband usually gets the fish and says its okay.,UNK
6414,"1.5 hours late, then proceeded to lie to us about our actually reservation time being later to cover the fact that they oversold their schedule.",UNK
6415,"This place is a lot nicer than I expected it to be in an older gym.  Its clean, and big.  Still nicer than most 24 hour fitness in the Valley!! :-)",UNK
6416,"A little cramped on NYE 2010/11 to see Diddy.  A nice club with great staff, too bad not in a better casino.",UNK
6417,My family and I used to always go to the Green Valley Brooklyn Bagel. This one is not worthy of the convenience. We were served moldy cheese and when we brought it back we were not offered a refund. EW!,UNK
6418,Flavorful not bitter I have only had a double espresso iced & a regular I enjoyed it,UNK
6419,I have eaten at a lot of Ruth's Chris joints.  This was the only place where nothing tasted like any of them.  Apparently not part of the main chain and it shows.   Fail on all levels.  Had to send steak back twice before I just said to hell with it.  Horrible.,UNK
6420,Not great people to work for... however i'll still give them 2 stars for the fact that the products are top of the line for a slush bar. And you can mix flavors and customize the liquor that goes in because they all start out virgins :),UNK
6421,"This place was a disappointment. Overpriced, especially considering you basically make your own meal. Service isn't fantastic, and it's a boring atmosphere. I won't be returning.",UNK
6422,Great food and dessert...total scottsdale snobbery atmosphere.,UNK
6423,Thx guys.\nThe beer was tasty and the street tacos were awesome.  My lady says the salmon tacos were the best but I preferred the bison. Thx again and see you soon.,UNK
6424,"Yuck!  I have no idea why people go to this icky, over priced chain restaurant.",UNK
6425,They lost a star from me due to my last stay here the whole hotel got sick due to something in the vent system. And when we get down stairs they had out emergency vitamin c packets. Hotel chain this size could of done better for a full hotel of sick guest.,UNK
6426,Excellent burgers and a great atmosphere! The tri-tip sandwich was fantastic on grilled sourdough.  My wife had a charburger and loved the fact that she was able to add avocado. We will definitely be back.,UNK
6427,"We called today, told them that we live in the area of Tropicana, just east of Boulder highway, and they said that they don't serve this area. So, if you live in southeast Las Vegas, call someone else.",UNK
6428,"Slow service.  Tables are shaking. Food is mediocre. To many good places to go to, stay away",UNK
6429,Terrible service!! Rude manager! Lost a customer for life And the manager didn't care,UNK
6430,Disappointed. 3 of the 6 sodas were out of order. They were also out of the carrots and two of the taco meats were gone too.,UNK
6431,"I have tried this place a few times now and I am just not impressed enough to go back again.  I have tried a few of the burgers and one of the salads and it wasn't horrible, but it wasn't memorable either.",UNK
6432,OMG! I. Forgot to mention their French fries! I think they are double fried or something because it was a pile of salty extra crispy goodness.,UNK
6433,This 3 star rating is for the food.  The food is OK here but when you combine it with the cheap price it is worth going.  I probably eat here a couple times a month.  Its good cheap eats!,UNK
6434,"Like this lil grocery. Very convienient, lots of choices for a smaller store,  clean, produce is always good and keeps well. Love the fresh meats they have at the counter and their ground coffee.",UNK
6435,"Not all tacos are created the same...and for this visit, I was all about the carne asada nachos. Definitely a treat",UNK
6436,I found this place through EAT24. an easy online ordering app. I ordered for delivery. I waited over an hour and a half for my food to be delivered. When the subpar food finally arrived it was ice cold. I would not recommend this place.,UNK
6437,"The pool was awesome,  however,  the hotel was a disappointment.  We went here to get married, the employees were rude snd the restaurants were over priced,  even for Vegas.  We spent most of our time nex door at the mirage.  But the pool was good.",UNK
6438,Pretty good fish tacos! Didn't like the shrimp taco tho. Chips & guac were delicious. Will come back to try breakfast burritos.,UNK
6439,"Outdoors, cold beer, good burgers, good people watching, Love this place for the open air and friendly staff. Avoid if it is too hot and no breeze. Or too cold. Burgers are good and happy hour beer is cold.",UNK
6440,It is what it is - very good fast food Mexican restaurant in South Phoenix.,UNK
6441,I LOVE In-N-Out but this location is the slowest I've ever been too!(California included) I can understand long wait when they are busy but there were only 3 other cars in the drive thru and a handful of people inside.,UNK
6442,Worst customer service ever. Stay away. Only got 1 star bc I had to give them one.  UPDATE- they are closed permanently,UNK
6443,I stayed here for 4 nights it is good the best thing is the location every thing is close to you but the room was average nothing spacial there is no noise isolation you can hear every thing the bed was not comfortable,UNK
6444,Staff is nice and friendly but the car wash did a terrible job. They had employees dry my car but when I got home I discovered spots all over. I'll stick to Fabulous Freddy's from now on.,UNK
6445,"OMG, I am so FULL!  Crab Cake and the ribs are my two favorite apps there! Be sure to try them. \n\nps...don't fill up on the biscuit!",UNK
6446,"Big, smelly and industrial.  It is a cheap place to stay in Edinburgh.  The dorms are swampy and unpleasant, but the double rooms are functional.",UNK
6447,"Had been here in the past and was definitely disappointed.  My last visit a week or two ago was a welcome improvement.  They still have a few things to improve but are seemingly coming around.  Now, a little more attractive HH and you'll see me more often.",UNK
6448,"Just Ok Hot dogs, I have had better.",UNK
6449,"The Wings are pretty good. At least on Tuesdays on Wing Night. Lots of fried food. Everytime I go there I think that I will enjoy the food, but when I taste the food I remember that most of it tastes really boring. \n\nStick with the wings...",UNK
6450,So so Pho and super unfriendly service.  Definitely better places to go in Vegas.,UNK
6451,Food is great!!,UNK
6452,"Had dinner with my wife and son on New Years Eve.  Place was not crowded yet dinner was not nearly as good as it used to be.  Lobster and Rainbow roll were small, chicken yaki soba was horrible.  Service lacked too.  Lots of other great choices in the area.",UNK
6453,This place is like dirty Mexico in the middle of Scottsdale. Not a fan.,UNK
6454,"Poor service, crap steak ($52 for a 1/2 inch thick ribeye?) and merger  wine pours - the Brussels sprouts were really good but, gimme a break here....this sucked for the money spent. Avoid.",UNK
6455,"Stop by the Hideaway today and had a good time. Plenty of bikes, food and live music. It's worth the afternoon to spend some time there.",UNK
6456,"Great spacious dinning area for family, friends and co workers. Pizza was delivered in a timely maner (20min). Prices are reasonable here. Courteous waiters and clean restaurant.",UNK
6457,I get really tired of every restaurant on the strip having to charge $10 bucks for a drink. It's not that I am cheap by any means but I struggle paying $10.00 for a well Vodka bloody mary. That being said the food and the service are er solid.,UNK
6458,My panini had burnt oil on both sides of the bread which made it taste bad. They didn't seem to think it was a big deal. Clearly no pride in their work.,UNK
6459,"Mediocre.... That's all I can say about this place. Limited drink option, ok sushi, ok service and ok price. No wait on Saturday night, I guess that was good. They have reverse happy hour from 9 pm daily with pretty limited selection.",UNK
6460,After hours pizza to the rescue! Located near all the bars and clubs in DT Scottsdale. Good pizza at a cheap price whenever I what.... I'm in!,UNK
6461,The reviews about mediocre service is spot on. Good value and likeability of the food. Wife says she'll be back but probably without me. Server paid too much attention to regulars and neglect newcomers.,UNK
6462,Food was well prepared and tasty. The service was quick and attentive. They serve generous portions and the three of us left satisfied.,UNK
6463,Horrible Service. Extremely slow to seat us... and feed us... and water us... and bill us... slooooow.\nWe won't be going back.,UNK
6464,"Worst sushi I've ever had. I didn't think it was possible to have bad sushi, unless of course it caused you to become ill. But this is the first time I've had bad sushi.",UNK
6465,"Terrible, we've stayed at other MGM resorts and they were all better (regardless of price) than this one.",UNK
6466,Ate here for breakfast. Typical diner food. My omelette was pretty good but the hash browns were awful! There was so much butter flavoring in them they were soggy. Wouldn't come here again.,UNK
6467,"I love the pizza here. I guess I am supposed to comment more. However, I will just stick with my original statement that the pizza is great and deserves a four star review based only on the quality/taste of the pizza.",UNK
6468,"Poor food, long wait for service!!!! Stay away.",UNK
6469,I absolutely love Chelsea's Kitchen. I have never had a bad experience and their patio is awesome. The only downside to the patio is that the tables are built in place so it is hard to have a large party on the back patio.,UNK
6470,Tasty food...but avoid the anemic and overpriced taco salad that would be better priced at $1.99 rather than $6.99.,UNK
6471,"Always busy but worth the wait, good service, good food and consistent!",UNK
6472,"Super weird when a Jersey Shore-esq guy wearing True Religion jeans is walking around filling everyone's water glasses. \nGreen Tea Martini is absolutely amazing, sushi wasn't fantastic.\n3 stars because it was awkward.\nWould not return.",UNK
6473,Great spot to eat lunch and dinner. Sundae roll is amazing!!!! The charge for the tea is the only reason they are getting 4 stars :),UNK
6474,all HYPE\nBUT the pizza at 2am is amazing tho LOL\n\nsecret tip. call ahead if your ordering a pie. it takes 20 mins if you wait,UNK
6475,"Love Happy Hour and the live band. Prices are good for happy hour, I wouldn't order the mojito again but I would order a martini... they got that one down every time.",UNK
6476,"Burgers were great, you get free refils on fries.   Waiter was very friendly.   Only negative I could say is I ordered \""some pink\"" on my burger and it came out medium to medium well.",UNK
6477,"Food was excellent.  I had the lamb meat balls, and some wine. Service was great as well.",UNK
6478,"This mandarin has great staff and good service. If you are going for authentic Chinese food , don't come here. But if your looking for an awesome dessert experience...this is the place to go!",UNK
6479,You get what you paid for.,UNK
6480,A friend recommended. Nail tech was  friendly and did a great job. Wine was good.   Massage chair was better then Polished. Overall enjoyed the experience and will go back.,UNK
6481,"Been here a couple of time, I guess it's an ok place to pass your time.",UNK
6482,"I ordered the crispy spicy tuna ($16) with chicken fried rice ($15), both were filling and well prepared. Service was great, ambiance was excellent. Well priced considering you're in Vegas.",UNK
6483,"Decent place to have dinner. However, I'd say the buffet at Wynn is much better for a slightly more expensive price. The crab legs are watery, but the dessert selection is great.",UNK
6484,Turkey burger was very well seasoned. Everything was really fresh & clean. Would definitely go here again!,UNK
6485,"NIGHTMARE. Poorly designed. Poorly organized. Disastrous dining experience. But the food . . . Dammit the food is good. Less hipster service, more ambiance, and no screaming children would make this place a winner.",UNK
6486,Love the enchiladas!! They say they are their specialty & they're not kiddin! They have a full page of enchiladas. Everything takes incredibly fresh. Service & size leave alot to be desired  but the food (& portion size) is well worth it!,UNK
6487,"nothing was really great, I would definitely continue to try other places before ever going back.",UNK
6488,Had early dinner.  DBacks playoff game underway which drew everyone's attention.  Service was very food and food was great.,UNK
6489,HATE  Nothing.\n\nDISLIKE  Kitchen closed before last call.\n\nLIKE  Friendly staff. Open late. Menu is organized into helpful sections. Location is close to home. Selection of rolls.\n\nLOVE  Nothing.,UNK
6490,Food was not tasty. Either too salty or too sweet. Soup was not good. Here for a birthday party which was ruined due to server dropping calamari on the birthday girls and guests. Service was terribly slow. Desert was ok but selection was not. Would not come again.,UNK
6491,being from toronto I've been to a better parties on a friday night :/,UNK
6492,"Mmm. Solid burgers, good beer. A little overpriced and there's always a wait. Order the bison burger - it's mouth-meltingly good.",UNK
6493,Great miso soup...BUT.\nThe least fresh sushi I've had.\n'twas truly awful.,UNK
6494,Worst zoo I've ever been too. Way over priced for a filthy facility. Will never waste my money here again. The only nice thing I can say is that all of the staff are very friendly,UNK
6495,"Buono's was sold after 20+ years of Jimmy making the best pies in town. Sauce recipe is the same, dough is the same, pepperonis not at all the same crust isn't quite as thin but overall great pizza.",UNK
6496,A delicious menu with a twist. Unique wine list too!,UNK
6497,"CLT\n  Depends on your carrier but there is some nice food options. It's been upgraded recently, funny the best food is on the domestic piers and the international piers have the least to offer. The First Flight Sushi is great, US has two lounges B and C",UNK
6498,"Prices are ridiculous, we didn't even order alcoholic drinks nor big stakes or fish, and yet the bill came back for the 4 of us for $435.00, incredible, never again.\nService great!, food (appetizers) OK.",UNK
6499,Great service overall. I was a little disappointed that their prime rib was way over salted even if you cut away from the rub. The dessert wasn't much better. It was tad bland and didn't allow me to leave there satisfied.,UNK
6500,"The flamboyant owner/waiter is really rude. This restaurant is really small and can't fit parties of 10 or more.  The food is good, but since the service was so horrible, I'll never come back.",UNK
6501,"This is an okay place on the square in Madison but as a whole is not too different from the dozens of other bars that dot the downtown area. Often crowded, good luck finding a seat, and prepare for it to be about 100 degrees in there because there are so many people.",UNK
6502,"So tasty, reasonably priced, cozy and clean inside and such friendly and courteous staff. What a treasure! I just got a gyro plate tonight, but I'll be back to try more of the menu for certain!",UNK
6503,"I was there for one week business conference.\nBad air quality in the room, and unreliable plumbing....\nLooks like the building is still not yet complete.\n\nOf course, the TV and the light dimmer obviously did not work.",UNK
6504,Ok nothing special.,UNK
6505,"This place is amazing!  Chuck E. Baby was playing, beer was cold and food was awesome!!!",UNK
6506,"Great spot for food and a few beers. Have taken family from out of town there a number of times and had a good meal. The combo plates are the way to get, get a bit of everything!",UNK
6507,Below average bar food. Appetizers are ok. Good atmosphere though and good drink specials.,UNK
6508,Great little place. Great service. Inexpensive. Great food. Even delivers. Mine & my husbands new favorite little find.,UNK
6509,Want to watch the Pens game? No worries...the little puke bartender changes the channel at will and would rather watch The Little Mermaid. \n\nRidiculous.,UNK
6510,Worst staff ever. The ladies at the front desk are horrible. i liked the doctor I had but the staff is the worst,UNK
6511,"It's an ok store.  Typically the cashiers are goofing off, deli is horribly slow or takes forever to acknowledge you.",UNK
6512,Don't get the omakase... it's all the boring stuff. Way better choices off the a la carte menu.,UNK
6513,"The food here was ok, for the price it was alittle underacheiving. Except for the chef special. Grey sole with risotto to die for.  Service spectacular.",UNK
6514,"this place isn't bad .... it just isn't good.  Really overpriced for what you get.\nBut I guess you're in Vegas, so there.",UNK
6515,"I work in the area and few times needed to get something for a pressing home need.  \n\nThese folks have always been friendly and very helpful and their prices aren't bad, either.  \n\nDid I mention friendly & helpful?",UNK
6516,The club sucks... tiny dance floor and expensive drinks... get your party on for free downstairs. The music is better and there is a lot of room to sit and chill with friends  =),UNK
6517,I didn't love this store but its not horrible. To be fair I didn't have an appointment and the girls at the shop were nice enough to let me browse. However I was kind of lost and it was a bit hectic in there.,UNK
6518,"Malee's on Mill is solid, reasonably-priced, standard Thai fare.",UNK
6519,Very good food and saw a great selection of beers. Servers were attentive. Inside could use a bit of a facelift but all in all a very good place.\nWill come again,UNK
6520,great local spot to get a greasy dinner breakfast!,UNK
6521,"The customer service is horrible which is too bad because the food is great. But button-line is I just can't ever go back, customer service is key to enjoying a meal.",UNK
6522,"Those tostada shrimp bites were delicious, I wasn't excited about paying for chips & salsa. It is a great HH spot but the dinner menu was underwhelming",UNK
6523,"They do great eyebrows but every time I go, they're closed. Very frustrating when I was excited about having a place close to home.",UNK
6524,"Had dinner last night here. The food left a lot to be desired. Reputation aside the salmon cakes had no seasoning and the ribeye was tough. Really disappointing. I've been here before when I come to Charlotte and had better food. Hopefully, this was a one-off.",UNK
6525,"Come on now, advertised as all you can eat, then they hit you up for $6 for dessert. What a rip.  The meat was overcooked, and the salad bar wasn't as good as they advertised. Total disappointment.  Service was excellent.",UNK
6526,Great entertainment for Men and Women.Loved the dancing singing and sexy ppl.Will go back again,UNK
6527,"Mongorian beef is good. Flied lice isn't all that, could use some flavor.",UNK
6528,worst hotel in vegas\n\nsuck ass!!!,UNK
6529,Worst Chinese food I've ever eaten.  Couldn't even finish half of it.,UNK

6531,ok. But it's a bit too pricey for what you get.,UNK
6532,I went there last week for the 1st time. Lovely decor. Food was great' I tried their chopped beef sandwich. The sauce has a sweet BBQ flavor. The meat was tender and very flavor able. sides were good also.,UNK
6533,Good food and good entertainment.  Food is good and plentiful.  Where the Key West Margaritaville lacks in flare this place has it.,UNK
6534,"take a taxi, take a taxi, take a taxi!!! you get what you pay for.",UNK
6535,"I was expecting some fun, good service? I was expecting something! Too crowded. Stupid ass sign in the front for dress code. What is that about? This place is too much of a dump to have a dress code.",UNK
6536,"I love their selection of salads even more so then Paradise Bakery which I am also a big fan of, and I loved their sweet potato sandwich! I also enjoy that they have pasta dishes to choose from. I am a huge fan of both Wildflower and Paradise Bakery for Fast Foods.",UNK
6537,"Great happy hour food and good drink specials. Try the Firecracker shrimp appetizer and Huckleberry Margarita, really good!!!\nGood idea after hiking Camelback mountain....\nFriendly, pleasant staff.",UNK
6538,Don't even bother. The food served had no relation to the beautiful pictures on the menu. Plus the excuses we got for the inconsistancy were laughable. JR,UNK
6539,The best place to eat late night inlas vegas if you are out late this is the place to eat! I def recommend the shrimp pasta,UNK
6540,"First time here today. Nice people, good service, excellent pizza and salad.  Also a cool interior and design.  Thumbs up.",UNK
6541,"Went here with my girlfriend. We both agreed it was good not great. Food is about what you'd expect from a central Illinois Italian restaurant. The atmosphere is a bit dark and dated, but the staff was very friendly.",UNK
6542,"It was okay to me. But I would love to come here to try it again. Got green tea bubble and this strawberry thing with loke grass jello, pudding.",UNK
6543,I went here in the afternoon and got a raspberry cupcake & chocolate chip cookie came to $4.29 it was disgusting the worst dried out cupcake & the cookie wasn't good either (how do u mess up a chocolate chip cookie?). Do not recommend at all!,UNK
6544,Loove the lunch menu! Inexpensive and filling. Cheaper than most fast food places with a home flavor. I love when I get to have lunch here,UNK
6545,"This place is really good, I like their house Fried rice and its big portion size.  Oh they have the most awesome fried dumpling, my mouth is drooling just thinking about it. I normally order there at least 2 to 3 time a month sometime to go or eat in.",UNK
6546,This place sucks!! Staff was rude. Rooms look like army barracks. We came for the ambiance and hospitality but were greeted with terrible service and poor attitudes!!\n\nWould not recommend!,UNK
6547,"Good wings and very good boneless wings. Limited draft beer collection. Overall a good place to hang out and watch sports, eat wings and have a few beers. Service is a bit slow at times",UNK
6548,"Howzit!?\n\nDecent Thai food. Average atmosphere. Good service.\n\nNotable dish: Beef Panang Curry, Garlic Pork with Tofu.",UNK
6549,"The building is cool, the food value is pretty good, but food flavor has diminished a lot.  The salsas were sweet (why sweet?), and the meats were bland.  Bummer.  Better Mexican food is pretty commonly available.",UNK
6550,"For the price, you would expect more.  \n\nThe deserts at the buffets were better!",UNK
6551,Fast & friendly service - was told by a friend to order the drink with the edible flower.... It did not disappoint!  Lovely refreshing ginger cocktail that is served with a tiny edible flower that makes your mouth tingle. Loved it.,UNK
6552,Eh...its not your typical burger....purina yuppie chow!!,UNK
6553,Good but not as good as Cheyenne location,UNK
6554,We went there on 11/22/14 for breakfest and the sign on the door said they business is closed.  The Landlord took repossession of the business for failure to pay rent.,UNK
6555,"Well, it's Dunkin' and I always thought their donuts were kinda \""meh\"".  But hey, what's not to like about a cup of Dunkin' Donuts coffee?",UNK
6556,"This place was solid!, We stayed at the MGM for a company conference.  This place became our group hang out.  The service was good, The food was good, the table staff was pretty good.  The Bar staff was on top of their game.  The Beer selection was pretty good as well.",UNK
6557,"simply the worst, and is not even all the people that work there but the corporation core values are aimed in take every dollar possible out of their costumers pocket and not even maintain a sanitary environment on this particularly establishment.",UNK
6558,"What's not to love about this place?  Great pizza, great pasta, and great service from Stephany(thanks girl).  There was live music Friday night, which added to a great evening.  I think I may have finally found a real Italian spot in Charlotte:-)",UNK
6559,Had the mini eclair and cannoli and unfortunately it was nothing noteworthy.  They aren't located in a fun area and the business seems to focus on decorative wedding cakes.  However the person who helped us was super friendly!,UNK
6560,"I would like a \""will call\"" window at the Tempe location.  Waiting a day or two for a part drives me nuts when they are located just a few miles away.  AND I have to pay  $10 shipping for that.",UNK
6561,small selection and kind of overpriced. \n\ndefinitely avoid on wednesday nights. as saturday mornings are much more lively.,UNK
6562,"This place is permanently closed, but there are still Groupon Now offers. I purchased the Groupon Now, and headed over, looped the strip mall three times looking for this restaurant only to find that it has been closed.",UNK
6563,Went for breakfast with a girlfriend and our daughters on a Saturday morning about a month ago. The service was great and the food was also. I liked that they had an iced coffee option. I would recommend this restaurant.,UNK
6564,The sushi is okay. The speciality rolls are good but it's not the best sushi I've had by far. The bento box for lunch came with a ton of food and it was all really good.,UNK
6565,Shit Sandwich!!!,UNK
6566,"Great food, great bar, and a staff that recognizes and acknowledges locals/regulars. The happy hour menu is the great secret.",UNK
6567,"Long Lines, But normal atmosphere.",UNK
6568,"It's great to have a diet menu.  The veggies were fresh and delicious, but the sauce was a little bland, watery and sweet.  If you are going to do diet, you have to use garlic, maybe some hot sauce to spice it up.",UNK
6569,"Don't waste your time or money.  The service is poor and the food is below average, nothing to write home about.  The restaurant is also very small.",UNK
6570,Good food. They're going to ask if you want the bbq chicken bun for 2.00. Don't get it. It's really small and only worth a dollar maybe at most.,UNK
6571,"I really enjoy coming here for breakfast. The service is really nice and fast and the food is good. I got the omelet egg breakfast with a side of bacon and my boyfriend got the breakfast, which we both loved. We're definitely coming back for another Saturday brunch.",UNK
6572,"So, with all the hype we were super excited to try this place. Honestly, it was mediocre ice cream stacked between a mediocre cookie. It didn't taste spectacular by any means. I felt like I had the same quality with a gas station ice cream sandwich. Sorry :/",UNK
6573,I walk in at 7:30 the doors are open they let me pick my fish then tell me the don't cook after 7:30 nice doing business with you,UNK
6574,"I don't what to make of this resturant.  This restaurant really did whored out East Asian culture with all the Buddhist figures, it almost seems ironic in the heart of Sin City.  This is another level of whorentialism by whites.",UNK
6575,Great staff... The young gal at the Drive Thru is amazing.. Very friendly and professional... XXL nacho with xtra beef is the way to go..,UNK
6576,Second time I had there food because they're like the only ppl who deliver around here. WORST FOOD. The lo mein is good though,UNK
6577,Great bar. Love the location and the atmosphere.,UNK
6578,"OK place but had better.\nSteak was OK although for the price i was expecting better.\nwe were seated on a table and the seats were small.\nNo parking, had to drive around till i found a ramp (with pay meters) not too far.",UNK
6579,Super salty mashed potatoes were horrible. Roast beef was sandwich type meat. Very disappointing.,UNK
6580,Didn't get what I had asked for number one. They didn't last very long number two. Was told this was the best. Even drove across town.,UNK
6581,"I am a HUGE fan of chipotle, but man this location is the worst. I went with friends and we got Horridly sick. Beware",UNK
6582,"Bartender sucks!!!!!!!! Go to the casino and order your drinks!!!!! Hope the food is better. Food was good, service (including waitress) sucks!!! Dont know why Red Rock hosts this establishment????",UNK
6583,"This is decent, if Americanized noodle cuisine.  Lot of sugar in everything.  Cool bar and unfinished concrete urban decor.  Nice to drop by if in the neighborhood, but real Asian food is just right down central without any pretense of fusion.  Also, fusion.",UNK
6584,"The place was great looking and  the employees were great, but the food while plentful every item I had was lukewarm and average in both quality and taste.",UNK
6585,"Not bad. Not great. Quick lunch, looking out at the pool. But you're paying for it. Nice crowd. Typical Vegas high-end coffee shop.",UNK
6586,"Great classes, perfect temp in the room (around 90-95), great teachers.  I've been here a few times and have enjoyed it each time.  Will continue to go here.",UNK
6587,"So after my negative review, I was offered a chance by the restaurant to come and re-try their food.  I responded via email to the manager, never heard back... Way to add salt to the wound!",UNK
6588,Always great service and ambiance.  The sushi is always fresh and the selection is always solid and diverse.  Go for lunch and take advantage of their bento box specials.,UNK
6589,"Carpet is torn up, locker rooms are in a sever need of a remodel from 1986. Equipment is old and there are always 5-7 machines broke. Seriously, this should be the crown jewel for Phoenix area 24 hour fitness gyms. Especially for the area. What a let down.",UNK
6590,Greedy when it comes to Wi-Fi. Spent 19 dollars between two people and got a 4-7 dollar time allot for one hour. Drinks are expensive and super sweet.,UNK
6591,Does this place still exist?  I drove around this area for 15 minutes looking and the best I can gather is that this Lowe's got converted into a Steinmart.  Lame.,UNK
6592,The chicken Panang was very good.  I had a 7 spice level and it had a nice kick.  You will not be disappointed.,UNK
6593,This confirms my opinion that restaurants that claim to have a great view rarely have good food but are always overpriced.  This one is also old and run down.,UNK
6594,"They do great quality work. The only reason I did not give them five stars is for their lack of customer courtesy not once but twice. I am a very patient and understanding person, but being rude twice means you dont want my business and I tipped 20%.",UNK
6595,Refused to call me a cab because I had a phone.,UNK
6596,"Food was tasty. Service was SLOW.\n\nI have been back twice since this dinner, and my two-star review stands.  The food is no doubt good.  However the wait time is extremely lacking and will make me consider other establishment in the future.",UNK
6597,Yuk! Couldn't even chew the steak. I love del taco but never have I experience such a disgusting meal. Didn't get past the first bite.,UNK
6598,"BLAH food and blah service \nNo sushi during lunch, but it is not that good anyways",UNK
6599,"Outstanding ambiance, cocktails, view and service sums up my experience at Mon Ami Gabi.  My chicken was nothing special but I would for sure go again just ordering a different main entr\u00e9e.",UNK
6600,being as i have never changed a battery in my life-them throwing the tools at me and saying change it yourself doesn't show good customer service.,UNK
6601,"Very cool place. My only complaints are no alcohol, and it was very hot in there.other then that the place was awesome",UNK
6602,"The food was overpriced and not very good. The staff is rude, I ordered a sandwich with no peppers and it was smothered in peppers. I had been to the one on McKellips and was happy. The Country Club is somewhere I will never go again.",UNK
6603,"Love the name.  Kim did my mani & pedi in no time flat.  She did a great job on a traditional mani, which is a rarity these days.  She said they also do hair in the space.  I'd go back.  Very clean.",UNK
6604,This place is tight!!! Saw all the stuff from the show. Even met Chum Lee. The majority of items that were on the show are expensive. But def worth checking out if your ever visiting Vegas.,UNK
6605,Rain WAS cool... now its just a tourist trap. Better clubbin in NY or LA.,UNK
6606,"Food was delicious, I had chicken lo mein and pork fried rice! The egg drop soup was a bit bland, nothing but egg and pepper. I couldn't stop staring at the nasty carpet or the lady serving with big purple rubber gloves!",UNK
6607,Came in last night (Saturday) for a slice. 15 minutes and $5 for a slice?! Egads. Ya'll gotta do better,UNK
6608,"Service is decent. The karaoke night sucked. With the digital age, karaoke should never be limited to such a lame list of cliche songs..",UNK
6609,Fine place to check in after a Cubs spring training game.,UNK
6610,Liked the store unfortunately it is closing on Oct 16th,UNK
6611,"This place is ok. I've only ever tried breakfast bagel sandwiches. The bagels are good. Eggs have no flavor, not even salt and pepper. Customer service could be way better. Outdoor seating is a bonus.",UNK
6612,"While staying at the Monte Carlo I ate here at least 3 times. The food was fast, fresh and delicious. I didn't realize it was a chain. I wish there were some in Houston!",UNK
6613,The dessert was wonderful - some rhubarb thing with ice-cream.  The food :-|,UNK
6614,"Did not like it in general ambient is to overcharge , service us excellent but my meat was overcooked , big disappointment.",UNK
6615,Went for lunch and had the French Dip sandwich....very good choice but man what a gutbuster!!!,UNK
6616,"The portions were slightly small, despite the high price, but very tasty. The hostess and waitress seemed to have some type of foreign object up their hind quarters all night but the bartender was outstanding. I've seen better bathrooms in a aircraft carrier. Nice place but not worth the price.",UNK
6617,"Waited at the pool for 30 minutes before being served. Comfortable beds. Live band at night. I didn't pick this hoyel , randomly it was selected. It was OK for the price.",UNK
6618,"I thought food was good.  I particularly liked being able to sit outside.  Lots of seating.   Just a bit loud on the night I was there but, despite the crowd, service was fast enough.",UNK
6619,They now serve SPAM MUSUBI on their menu!  But not as good as the ones you find in the lil' Mom & Pop stores in Hawaii.,UNK
6620,Closed? Thank goodness.,UNK
6621,"Great place to go for happy hour before a game at Jobing.com.  Nice selection of beers and appetizers, all reasonably priced.  Attentive service.  I'll be back again for sure.",UNK
6622,"Very friendly, but doesn't have as much character as the Pig.  I tried two of the in-house beers, the Cherry Milk Stout (delicious) and the Red Rye Ale (disgusting).",UNK
6623,Nastyyy calzone!!!! Do not go there!!! I had to throw out my food!!!!,UNK
6624,.,UNK
6625,"There are few other shops in the area with better service and ramen, but I will say there boba tea is pretty tasty.",UNK
6626,"Decent, a classic, but a little overhyped.",UNK
6627,"Food was good, service was below average, empty booths and you make sit at a small table. Drinks need to come out faster. Average at best!",UNK
6628,"After watching Tool Fiery's review on triple d a couple of time, we finally tried it. Looked better on t.v. We left over easy with an un-easy feeling in our stomach and wallet. $3.00 for a shot of o.j. Come on man.",UNK
6629,"Personally, I would not pay that much for a hot dog that is not even hot when you get it. My friend bought me lunch there once and though their waffle ice cream was good, as well as their peanut butter one, I won't go back there.",UNK
6630,"They are closed, went there for breakfast and the sign is even gone.",UNK
6631,Don't waste you time; this buffet is just bad. Low quality and nasty. Go to Bellagio or Paris and get a good buffet.,UNK
6632,"Great store. Pretty much the same as Home Depot. If you can't find it here, you can always head to Home Depot. Between the two places, they pretty much have everything you need to remodel your home. I do prefer Home Depot Behr paint over Lowes brand though.",UNK
6633,You have to be careful here and only order the Hawaiian food because they also offer Chinese food but they jacked up the price for that and you don't get as much as when you order Chinese food. I get the Loco Moco because it's huge and cheap,UNK
6634,Pho Kim long took a pho Kim long time to bring us our food.  Food was very ok.  Nothing to write home to mom about...\nWould come here again because of the name....,UNK
6635,Great place to eat in for pizza. The Maui Zaui pizza was really good. Italian garlic supreme was delicious too. Service was fast and friendly.  Would come back again.,UNK
6636,"Eh....so it's not the best quality. But hell, if you want a cheap meal and you're staying there, just go for it.",UNK
6637,Had never been here before but thought I'd give it a try. It was excellent! Extremely fresh and delicious. Clean facility and very friendly staff :),UNK
6638,"Not bad gyro, but there's better. I like mine with crushed peppers and they didn't have any. Overall it's ok.",UNK
6639,They have bed bugs. See the pictures. Gross.,UNK
6640,"Great Service, Great Burgers minus the fries :) oh and Animal Style, at a Great Price!!!  They take pride in their food and customer service and it shows.",UNK
6641,This review is for the deli.  Service was good.  Had the matzo ball soup which wasn't so good.  Chicken flavor was missing in the broth. Other reviews indicated just like homemade but it wasn't.,UNK
6642,Quite possibly the dullest buffet in Vegas... I'll stick to the Rio and Bellagio.,UNK
6643,The Cake Boss should be ashamed of his store. The service was horrible and we never had any cake. We waited 45 mins.,UNK
6644,"Pricy, but not so much compared to other things on the Strip, and it tasted pretty good.",UNK
6645,A solid spot for burrito's! All the staple items with fresh ingredients and great offers... Tuesday & Thursday!,UNK
6646,Over-hyped tourist trap slop...,UNK
6647,"Great name, but the beer is insipid, bland, and served  in plastic pitchers. Yuck. College greeksters might dig it, but anyone with an actual palate will be repelled. Costly, boring, feh.",UNK
6648,"If you like cheeseburgers do yourself a favor and come in and try the cheesy cheeseburger they have there, it's great. Not going to lie, this would be a delicious way to cure a hangover as well",UNK
6649,This place was aight! We stopped by for round 1. The waitress was very nice. Drinks about $12 and super strong but totally worth it. Hmm probably not returning to spend the whole night here but maybe to grab A drink.,UNK
6650,Excellent service and a cute little place in historic Glendale. Beautiful little tree-lined street and a lively patio. I had the tomato mozarella sandwich and tomato noodle soup. Both were very good. I'll be back for lunch.,UNK
6651,"Coffee shop located inside Paris.  \n\nPurchased chocolate croissant and coffee.  \n\nCoffee was alright.  It was rather bland taste.\n\nChocolate croissant was not bad, but nothing extraordinary.",UNK
6652,yesterday had the lunch buffet with my wife and ended up with a bad case of food poisoning. Between the throwing up and diarrhea it was worse than going through chemotherapy. Needless to say I will not be back,UNK
6653,Slow slow slow!\nFood was nothing to call home about,UNK
6654,Typical chicken. Service was not so great and the spacing to sit in here is very small.\n\nLocation is great but pulling in and pulling out is so hard due to Spring Mnt road being so busy.,UNK
6655,"I ordered the BBQ mix plate for 7.95. Definitely not the best Hawaiian food I've ever had. Short ribs were tasty, chicken was bland, beef tasted like liver. \n\nThere are definitely better island eats in town!",UNK
6656,"It's Olive Garden and it's in Surprise, so it's always busy. I've always had decent service and good tasting food. If I have my choice, I'm always going to choose a less chain place, but it's not bad in a pinch.",UNK
6657,"BIG SHOCKER:  Red, Hot & Blue was/is CLOSED @ the Waterfront",UNK

6660,"Server very disconnected from doing his job, serving! I ordered the Seafood mixed grill... Great flavor, yet tiny portion for $30! All other Flavors rocked...",UNK
6661,"It's not the best burgers but they're decent, but what I really like are the fries and how much you get..",UNK
6662,Topical chain restaurant ... Food was not good at all,UNK
6663,"Went here thinking we could get cheap yummy mexican. The only thing that was cheap was the quality of the food. Same prices as the other Mexican restaurants I like much better. Drive to Ajo Als,or El Encanto instead.",UNK
6664,"This place is a complete rip off. You go to sell them something and they offer you a ridiculously low amount, only to turn around and jack up the price close to the retail NEW price.",UNK
6665,Ghetto white trashy bar. First time here and my car was broken into.,UNK
6666,"Way to pricy for what you get! Food was just ok, kind of bazaar place overall.",UNK
6667,"Not very pleased with our experience. Duck tasted good, but delivery was poor. We received the duck and 5 minutes later we received our rice. Would not recommend or come to this location again.",UNK
6668,"This place is a french want to be restaurant. Not really premium and authentic french food, Very americanized and expensive.",UNK
6669,Probably the worst Mexican food I have ever had. And I have eaten at Taco Bell. Super low quality!,UNK
6670,Roadhouse Cafe was a great place to hang out...Great live music and the saloon looked like out of the movie. The food was good and so was the waitstaff. Great place to go for a ride or a hang out time and enjoy a beer and good food.,UNK
6671,"Too many tweekers.\nOutside panhandling & inside hanging out.\nGrilled chicken was tasty, & service was OK though.",UNK
6672,"What is this place, a supper club? Looks like a bar for regulars. Only had a couple drinks, didn't try the food. Im sure theres some type of fish fry here.",UNK
6673,Great Sandwiches and pub style food . This place reminds me of Cheers cause the staf is so friendly and they make you feel at home.,UNK
6674,I love this place. They are hardcore Korean chefs and owner.\nYou probably get better deal just order off the happy hour menu over the all you can-eat. The quality of food is great here and it's a little gem I am so glad to discover !,UNK
6675,"Very milky mozzarella here - excellent cheese on their pizza.  Thin NYC style slices make this a great lunch place.  Reasonable prices and usually has sufficient seating for the lunch crowd.  \n\n\nFaces the east, sharing same parking lot with Lowe's.",UNK
6676,"I Had the \""Big Slab\"" take out, IT SUCKED!!! This place has gone downhill fast! Ribs looked like dried jerky on a bone.. I'm not going back!!!!!!",UNK
6677,Use to be my favorite taco shop in my area. Until I found a piece of latex glove in my taco. I haven't been able to return. Glad they wear gloves though.,UNK
6678,"Decent food, really polite and nice staff,  but order got mixed up a few times on an empty night.",UNK
6679,"I've been three times and plan on going again. Simply put, it's a nice place to go and have some good food.",UNK
6680,"Food was good, but halfway through the meal we saw roaches on the walls and floor.  That part was not so good.",UNK
6681,Engaging service thanks Phil.  Enjoyed the food.  The only issue was the size of the booth.  Kinda small for four people.,UNK
6682,"We're tourists & this was a great find. The service was excellent, the atmosphere fun, and Mexican food the way we like it--lots of choices & the right amount of spice. We'll be back.",UNK
6683,I wasn't thrilled with my meal here--but the drinks are great and the banana dessert was amazing as well.  Best to go here if you're into authentic Mexican dishes as opposed to fresh tex mex.,UNK
6684,Delicious food and a generous beer selection! I had the venison shepherds pie and it was amaze!,UNK
6685,"The Guiness Irish stew was ok, the service was good and the Caesar salad was fresh and crisp",UNK
6686,"Food was amazing, however I docked to stars because our waitress was extremely slow and very forgetful!",UNK
6687,"This was kinda fun but not nearly enough! No free fall, it is a controlled fall at only 45 mph. The best part was right before you jump. Then...you slowly descend. You should have at least half way down in true free fall.  Then I would give it 5 stars.",UNK
6688,So noisy we could not have a conversation.   Asked to be moved.   There was a table available but not for us.   No accommodation made.  We left.  Won't return.,UNK
6689,My daughter and I had dueling pedicures recently. I would say that there is nothing out of the ordinary here nothing special. The folks there are pleasant and they did a good job although I would have enjoyed a bit more massage time.,UNK
6690,"Holy cow.  It cost me like $25 to get a couple of sweaters dry cleaned here last year.   Granted, they did a good job, and they packed them in some really nice covers, but ouch.  Check pricing before you drop off your stuff here.",UNK
6691,Slow & expensive and overall the worst experience I ever had at a printer. It took them over 30 mins just to wire-o one document...!,UNK
6692,"Straight outta NY.  Get decent deli and all the attitude you would expect.  They use Boar's Head meat which is top quality, but the bread is in need of a change.  Hot pastrami is especially good if available as a daily special.",UNK
6693,I had both of my dogs groomed and they shaved one of my kids belly so close it is now infected. NOT Happy!!!,UNK
6694,"wasn't one of the best boba visits I've had here in town. there are other places that have better quality products.  they did just open up a few months ago, so I'd give them a while to find their niche and offer something Vegas doesn't already have.",UNK
6695,"Overpriced.  At these prices the food quality should be better. The food isn't bad   but not great either, not good enough to justify the prices.",UNK
6696,Casino management was nice enough to give me a personal call to apologize. He also comped my stay for the first night. It's nice that they still take time to address complaints. I'll probably be open to staying again at their hotel at least.,UNK
6697,The atmosphere was great. The food and service was not so great. We had a really depressed waitress and food took for ever to come out. We also noticed the food to be bland and dry. I would not recommend this place to anyone looking for authentic Mexican food.,UNK
6698,Restaurant is closed.,UNK
6699,John did my oil change and his wife kept me entertained with great conversation.  I would gladly recommend for any auto repair.  will do business again!,UNK
6700,Overall it was just ok. Bomba desserts are probably the best thing they serve.,UNK
6701,"Very good pizza! It is not greasy and the prices are what I expect for an airport. It is higher than I would pay off airport, but not on airport property.",UNK
6702,I had The Garlic Pizza which was tasty. The Service was ok. Other than that I think this place is average.,UNK
6703,Nice happy hr!  Nice big TV setup.  Food seems typical for a bar / restaurant .  I'll keep this place on my list and see if it improves with time.  Its pretty obvious that they just opened so I gave them a third star for potential rather than two stars they would get otherwise.,UNK
6704,"Drinks are good, food sucks & is expensive.  Atmosphere needs major upkeep.",UNK
6705,Nice & fresh but nothing spectacular. I'm still in love with Krispy Kremes.\n\nBring Cash!,UNK
6706,Vanessa did a great job of taking care of us.  Service was quick and food was good. Would definitely go again!,UNK
6707,"Two stars is all I give this place because of service. I really like the sushi here but after more then one really bad experience with the service, my good will has run out. Now I just avoid the place.",UNK
6708,"I've been there only once, and that was enough. Yes, it is too crowded and infested with undergrads. If you are in for a randomly meeting unattractive people, this may be the place for you.",UNK
6709,"The atmosphere was nice, but I ordered the Mahi Mahi and it came out over cooked and super dry. It was like eating cardboard.",UNK
6710,"This place is good for a quick lunch or dinner with family. Kid-friendly, too.",UNK
6711,"I love this place. They always make you feel so welcome and at home. They do a fantastic job, and really listen when you tell them what you want.",UNK
6712,Very nice location but food was awful.  Had a chicken salad yuck.  Service stunk big time!,UNK
6713,Terrible experience. Worst service ever. We should call room service 3 time to get some thing.\nWhen we get there the shampoos in the bathroom were half used! Disgusting!,UNK
6714,Shabu shabu. Boiled meat. Boiled vegetables. Really...would you even do this at home? Flavorless.,UNK
6715,"Head sized pizza slices! The pizza is pretty good, but you would really only come here for the giant slices. Per square inch, probably the best deal on the strip.",UNK
6716,Hard to tell which was colder: my beer or my burrito. The service was non-existent. And had to beg for chips and salsa. Skip this one.,UNK
6717,I had the spicy sausage and mushroom. Not much meat though the pizza tasted good. Mostly dough and cheese. Everything else seems fine. Nice atmosphere and friendly staff.,UNK
6718,"Very nice clean place,  big screen tv's great, nice atmosphere, good prices, the asada taco salad was not good ( beans where too salty and too many ), I will go back to try them again, the place is great!!",UNK
6719,Worst experience ever. Equipment was not cleaned properly. They charged more than I normally pay at my regular place Biagio and their service was no where close to as good. I do not recommend.,UNK
6720,"This place has closed permanently. Major bummer, Mill keeps hiking the rent and there are not many businesses left that can afford it.",UNK
6721,"Meh, it's functional I guess.  I'm usually only here for layovers and seem to have the same experience every time.  Walking long, endless hallways in search of more than one food option and never finding a place to sit down near the food options or near the gates.",UNK
6722,"The steaks we had were disappointing for the price. We both order medium rare, my wife got a rare steak and I got medium. They argued that they we're cook correctly.  \n\nI have better steak at Outback, longhorn.",UNK
6723,"7 mins before they where closing and the open sign still lit, we where walking up to go buy some gelato. One of the workers locked the door right before we could open it, and walked off. We wont be back! That's bad service!!!",UNK
6724,Do not go do not go.  Staff was slow and not caring.  When I express question and concerns at the end the vet threw her hands in the air and walk away and made it like is was my fault.  Again don't go,UNK
6725,"It's true, they do have incredibly slow service. But my order has never been messed up, and they are usually pretty friendly. Don't stop by if you're running late for work.",UNK
6726,Horrible! You would think that a place that prides themselves from being from Texas would have top quality meat. Not the case at this place. Save your money.,UNK
6727,I use this location frequently because of its location being the closest to my work.  The traffic to get in and out is consistently bad.  The set-up of the drive through is an accident waiting to happen.  This location seems to have more inconsistent quality in their drinks than others I have been to.,UNK
6728,"I have had several meals here and the service has always been professional and attentive.  Food is good, they know their fish.  Try the scallops if your in the mood!  worth every penny.",UNK
6729,"Good, healthy, fast!",UNK
6730,"Great atmosphere, trendy, chic, but the food leaves a lot to be desired.",UNK
6731,"Yum! This place is great. They make your pizza right in front of you, with fresh ingredients. You can choose from your standard pizza fare, order one of their specialty pizzas OR you can come up with whatever crazy little combo your fatty little bacon-loving heart desires. Good stuff!",UNK
6732,"Very dangerous to use ATM at night!  It's located  on the back of the building with a brick wall  on your right, completely hiding from view.  Safer to drive to the one on Las Vegas Blvd and Clark, very open and lit up like the 4th of July.",UNK
6733,The pork is awesome.,UNK
6734,What happened to the Rio?  I checked in and checked out.  The room was horrible.  it had a couch that was covered in stains.  Hallway carpets were filthy.  Rio needs some definite renovating on all levels.,UNK
6735,"They have a lot of coupon online, price is not bad, service also, base on there price, I still will be back, lol",UNK
6736,Inefficient gateways. Need to shuttle everywhere. Slow security checkpoint lines.,UNK
6737,Taco Bell is Taco Bell-- What can one say about it? The service is kind of slow here. I have been in faster drive thrus. Ha!,UNK
6738,"If you want a dog and are in the area, this is a pretty good call. Having said that, it is probably not worth a special trip. You can find a better hot dog or brat at a ballpark or in the supermarket.",UNK
6739,Waste of money and time. I understand a surcharge for convenience... But a 200% markup is ridiculous. Owner is rude too.,UNK
6740,The other issue is recently I've had problems with the automatic gate. Seems this is the only place that I have an issue with the scanner as I am a monthly member. Wish they fix this issue soon. Frustrating when you're in a hurry.,UNK
6741,"Boneless Wings had a tasty sauce, but not enough sauce and too much coating for my taste.",UNK
6742,Great neighborhood Italian place. I always get the Cavatelli Con Salsiccia. Always great service and love the assortment bread they bring out.,UNK
6743,Food is pretty good. Solid cheap Chinese take out.,UNK
6744,"Don't go chasing waterfalls...\nThis place was a huge let-down. Ordered appetizers and they sucked, cheese stix were undercooked and southwest eggrolls were cold. Service sucked...",UNK
6745,There isn't a coffee shop at the address given in yelp. I called the number but couldn't reach them.,UNK
6746,"Fast service, reasonable price , authentic Chinese food, but sometimes too salty and greasy for some food.\nI only go there once a while. One of the most popular veggie dishes is eggplant with green bean.",UNK
6747,"Good bulgogi, and a spicy octopus platter I forgot the name of.  I'd visit again, but my eyes tear whenever I walk into the place- not their fault I'm allergic to *.",UNK
6748,i recommend it as something to do once. its cool seeing all the ice .the ice cups are neat. its damn cold in there. the drinks are not memorable but the place is.,UNK
6749,Friendly folks and great food.  Enjoyed very much!,UNK
6750,I thought the food here to be a little on the bland side.  The paella I had just didn't do it for me and though the steak is just shy of being an entire cow I was still reaching for the salt.,UNK
6751,This place SUCKS! NO CUSTOMER SERVICE! payed for a suite with a king bed and they give me a room with 2 queen beds! After try to up sell me at check in! Classic!,UNK
6752,Found these guys using Bing. My iPhone home button was unresponsive. Brought it in and less than 30 minutes I was up and running. Brand new home button installed. Works better now than it did when it was new.,UNK
6753,Good food and service. The 5 course meal is too much food.,UNK
6754,"The office canceled appointments on the day of service twice. Very rude service, will not return.",UNK
6755,Always a nightmare to cash out here.,UNK
6756,"Chips and salsa is the only good thing about this place. Food is mediocre, service is below average. Which sucks because this place used to be decent.",UNK
6757,"Had the nachopalooza with brisket, large portion but bland taste. Service was the worst part. Waitress never checked on us after bring served. Never again.",UNK
6758,"Sushi Mon never disappoints. It's a nice, casual sushi restaurant. The sushi is fresh and the rolls are good. The servers and sushi chefs are all very friendly and nice. Prices are decent.",UNK
6759,I think this is the best pizza in Dormont!!! i have never had a bad pie from here! stop in and get a slice or 2!,UNK
6760,This place is insane there is so much stuff in this store. I couldnt belive the selcetion they have from all over the world. Their liquor section is huge. They also have this huge tank with live fish in it.,UNK
6761,great restaurant.....has been for years!,UNK
6762,yes I am a fan- and this is yummy. \n\nCreative assortment of dough pockets filled with yummy.\n\nRecommend for groups or even a cheap date.,UNK
6763,I enjoyed all the food! The angry spider was a-mazing! Here visiting family and it was all smiles! Service was slow but it allowed me and my family to bond more.,UNK
6764,Disappointed. The decor is beautiful but the food is bland. Disconnected service. Parking is a nightmare! The manager is very sweet and tried to correct everything from mistakes on our order to mistakes on our bill but the food isn't good enough to return.,UNK
6765,Best place in the city to get a dog,UNK
6766,"Really enjoyed the atmosphere.  The crispy, spicy, tuna roll was unusual and yummy.",UNK
6767,"This theater is inside the Boulder Station Casino. We went to a 10:30 show and it was a pretty decent place. It was convenient and the concessions are like any other Regal theater, just a little smaller and not as glitzy.",UNK
6768,Bad haircut first time.  Went back a day later to get it fixed and they were not very nice. Still doesn't look good.,UNK
6769,My gel polish came off in 2 days...\nwent back they polished again and still came off again!!\nI wont go back !\n\nlike it was watered down...,UNK
6770,Very friendly and accommodating staff. Location is convenient and prices are reasonable. The shop is not the most upscale venue but clean and gets the job done. Steve and staff made sure I was satisfied and let me know that's what they are there for :),UNK
6771,"The room was not clean.  The hotel manager was extremely rude and aggressive.  \n\nSimply put, don't stay here.  For the same money, you can do a lot better.",UNK
6772,Pleasantly surprised at the menu selection and quality of food.  Wine selections were great by the bottle but I would love to see some higher quality wines by the glass.  \n\nMac & Cheese was really good!  Poor child with us had everyone eating off her plate.,UNK
6773,Coconuts shrimp with horseradish and marmalade.  Raspberry Point oysters with Mignonette glacee au champagne,UNK
6774,"I love there shrimp and lobster with fried rice.  Good value no frills restaurant but clean, and folks are friendly!",UNK
6775,Pizza was just ok and the live music was horrible and annoying. I will definitely skip this place next trip.,UNK
6776,"It is a non for profit place. Decent coffee/latte selections. I only ordered tea. There is live music most nights, but it is such a small space... kind of uncomfortable. I'd rather go to starbucks(and I hate starbucks).",UNK
6777,Food is ok for the price. Menu never changes though. Can get boring.,UNK
6778,"It is good, especially turtle sundae. It is kind of pricey, for a small sundae almost $6!!",UNK
6779,"To busy here to stop here\nThis place is always busy, but the staff sucks, Ihave to send my food back two times, and it still was not right.",UNK
6780,"This place has a nice neighborhood feel to it.  I like that they have New Castle on tap.  The food is pretty typical bar food and nothing I have had stands out as stellar.  If you live close, it's perfect for a Sunday afternoon beer and sports watching.",UNK
6781,"How can you mess up a greasy spoon breakfast?  Well, these guys managed to do it.  Stick with Pamela's.",UNK
6782,"Looked like a great place, but not a member of the association of children's museums, so our membership was not honored.  Went to the Science Museum instead",UNK
6783,Saw it on food network and had to try this place. Had the banh mi burger a couple of weeks ago. Everything was good but the bun was really soggy.,UNK
6784,This used to be my favorite place until a small worm was on my roll.  We took a video of it and management offered to pay for meals. Never will eat there again.,UNK
6785,"Great food.  Good service.  Some of the younger employees aren't as friendly, but they try.  The food is affordable, tasty, and delivery is fast.  They are consistently good.",UNK
6786,Great Turkey Grinder!,UNK
6787,"This place was decent BBQ. There wasn't anything that really stood out about this place. The pulled pork sandwich was kind of bland, along with the Mac and cheese. The potato salad I really liked.",UNK
6788,"Real ale on tap complete with frequent rotation of guest ales plus the usual drops, plenty of flat screens make it a great place to watch a game or two...and the staff are knowledgeable about what they're pulling & happy to chat about them. Really enjoyable!",UNK
6789,"Great Service.\nIf I return, I will Build My Own burger as the ones on the menu had clashing flavors.  If you want medium rare, ask for rare, ours came out medium.\nGreat Beer Selection.",UNK
6790,"Definitely one of my new favorite hotels. You can pretty much just stay here with the family the entire time you are here. Their pools (lazy pool, wave pool) were awesome. Kids loved it. Not so bad it's at the end of the strip.",UNK
6791,So sad this place didn't last. Now I have to travel to the one on paradise and Sahara. The vagrants that hung around probably scared away everyone.  This shopping center is notorious for that!,UNK
6792,PT's is overall a great little chain of bars food throughout the Valley.  The have a location on almost every major street at some point or another.  PT's delivers your full-bar and draft brews along with a nice list of both starter items and full entrees.,UNK
6793,"Had classic sweet crepe and the polish tea (which is  black tea with honey and lemon piece) there. Not much seats in there, looks like about 4 or 5 table. Good place for drop by and have some drinks.",UNK
6794,Went here late at night for dinner after a flight. Obviously the C team was on duty. Food was cold. Expected better,UNK
6795,"This place was priced very well.  I would rate the massage average, as the pressure was not deep pressure as requested, but it was very relaxing and I felt good afterwards.  Therapists were very friendly and the ambience was great.  They used some great aromatherapy techniques.",UNK
6796,Don't go!!  Worst buffet I ever had last night. $56.75 per person including tax and tips for few main dishes which are not very testy. Not worth it.,UNK
6797,Ya know .. I don't get it .. seems like a small step up from an IHOP or Denny's .. maybe it's just me.,UNK
6798,"The food was really awful.  Best part was the drink I had.  Service, bad.  Location great so no excuse!",UNK
6799,Pleasant atmosphere. Food was very well prepared and the staff very attentive. Wasn't expecting the quality this restaurant delivered being located in the museum itself.,UNK
6800,Everyone is incredibly rude and act like they are doing u a favor allowing u to book at their hotel.  In this economy they will never survive.  What a bunch of assholes.,UNK
6801,"Super late review but this place does get a 4. I loved the food and the service was great, especially since it was for my mom's birthday. Cool place to stop and get some filipino food inVegas.",UNK
6802,An Arcadia restaurant feel in South Scottsdale. Finally! Happy hour is only $1 off f&b which isn't all that great but we still enjoyed. The cocktails were good and food was also reasonably priced and tasty. Will definitely be back.,UNK
6803,Love the Blue Black Mac & Cheese and the  Bourbon Teriakye wings are delicious!! Nice atmosphere and drinks specials! Outdoor patio is heated and full bar!! This place is cool to hang with friends and meet new ones!!,UNK
6804,Most expensive headband purchase ever.  I came in here thinking I might find one cheaper than ULTA which is located next door.  \nSpent $65 and didn't find a headband.,UNK
6805,Horrible service. Drinks were made incorrectly and the food wasn't that good. Walk across the street and go to hi fi or whiskey row,UNK
6806,"In the young, naive days before I discovered the joy of gyros, this place was just a late night grub and Greek mafia money laundering joint. Rooftop patio which was cool (but not in the winter when it would have been *very* cool).",UNK
6807,"Not worth the price: amateur staff, over cooked seafood, watered down drinks.  This used to be a higher end seafood restaurant, now it's the equivalent of an Applebees, with the high end price tag.",UNK
6808,"burnt dry chicken, way over cooked prime ribs. Very unacceptable. Price was higher than it was worth. There was no effort put into this food. It was rushed, fast food style. burnt.",UNK
6809,"Tourist trap! Pricey mediocre chinese food, not quite the same cheap eats Sam Woo like in San Gabriel, Cali. You'll be paying twice as much for a roast duck here and it's super salty. This place takes CASH ONLY!",UNK
6810,"I love their roast beef sandwich. The couscous side is perfect as well. With a soda, it was less than $9! Can't beat that.",UNK
6811,Pretty good service for fast food.,UNK
6812,"Great sandwiches, camembert yum!",UNK
6813,"Came here to soak up my whiskey-infused self with some bean & cheese pupusas, mmm. I love Beaubien for it's wide range of food, but this place is always spot on and the drinks are cheap.",UNK
6814,Great place to stop. The service was good and so was the food. Simple menu with all the basics.  This joint is pretty small though but still a good stop for early or late breakfast.,UNK
6815,"Unbelievable. Bad service to start with, and they were not even busy. The buffet portion of the meal was sub-par at best. Avoid!",UNK
6816,"I have only had lunch there, never breakfast. The sandwiches are average and the prices are steep. The waitstaff is usually always very pleasant!",UNK
6817,"Slowest. Drive-thru. Ever. Been here 3x, same experience every time.",UNK
6818,4.5 Stars\nThe seafood tower was amazing and my ribeye was very good.  Very expensive.  Much better experience than the ocean club in Newport Beach.,UNK
6819,good locals casino but the staff are rude and grumpy....is it so hard to smile? ill still come back because it has great food and movie theater is pristine but the dealers need an attitude check,UNK
6820,"Marissa is awesome, skilled and funny. Do stop by and tell her I sent you.",UNK
6821,"If you like mindless, generic music, then this is the place for you.  The dance floors are on the small side, and seating is inadequate.  Have been a few times [always being dragged after the first time].  Crowded with pretentiousness up the wazoo.",UNK
6822,"The pizza was just \""ok\"" crust was chewy and undercooked in the middle while the edges were good. Pretty stingy with the cheese and toppings as well. Went back another time and the pizza was better, bumping review up to 3 stars.",UNK
6823,Bean Curd Sea Bass and Fried Rice from here is decent. \n\nService HELLA SUCKS here though!,UNK
6824,"Great place to get a real deep tissue back massage, they do a great job getting the knots out and helping relaxation. Wish they do more work on the arms and legs, but can't beat walking in and no appointment needed.",UNK
6825,This was lovely. Marianne and I and  my 13 year old son went for dinner.  Charming interior.  Cozy. Friendly service.  Really good food.  Squid ink risotto especially good in my book.  $$$ but worth the trip.,UNK
6826,"This place absolutely Sucked!!! Deserved NO STARS if that was an option, overhyped and overflowing with Douchebags...Never Again....Phok Yu - PhoKimLong",UNK
6827,"We've eaten here 3 times now and I think it's great for fast food, the Gyro's are delicious.  I also appreciate that you can call ahead and just pick up your order in the drive through.  This is one of my fav's.",UNK
6828,Not too busy.  Employees are moderately friendly.  Expect to wait in line for a bit on your lunch or after work.,UNK
6829,"This is the best Greek food I've found in AZ.  Try their lamb kabobs, or lamb chops and Tzatziki and pita bread. Nice waiters, too! Good stuff!",UNK
6830,Hometown cooking at its best. Great all you can eat fish special on friday nights. My other favorite is country fried steak and eggs! Hashbrowns are my favorite.,UNK
6831,A nice property. More low key than many in Las Vegas. Very friendly and efficient staff. The room could have been a bit more thoroughly cleaned.,UNK
6832,The food is ridiculously delicious! This is my go-to place for filipino food. I just wish it was bigger and better menu list.,UNK
6833,"We ordered food to go at this restaurant. They told us we would have to wait 30 minutes. Instead, the wait was 1 hour and 10 minutes. I will never go back. The food is better at Gaati and they don't make you wait forever.",UNK
6834,"Great food and best bang for the buck! Go in during happy hour and you wont regret when you leave! Must try their wings and sliders, i prefer mild wings and tuna melt sliders.",UNK
6835,"Ok, buffet but not outstanding.  It was easy in and easy out, but the choices seemes somewhat limited.  My wife did not like the freshness or the the seasoning of the  crab here.  Probably a good choice with coupon for Breakfast or Lunch, but you can do better.",UNK
6836,Stayed here for a week while waiting to move into my home.  Look it is what it is which means it's a place to sleep and make a simple meal if you have to.  Staff is friendly and the rooms are clean.,UNK
6837,Pretty good deli sandwich but a hassle for parking. Love the selection of things to buy sorta like a little market in NY!,UNK
6838,"Yuck. All around. Dirty, nasty, and tacky! We had wings there which literally glowed under the \""awesome\"" black lights. We call them Snot Wings. There are plenty o'dive bars out there which are good and good for ya. This is not one of them.",UNK
6839,Ok if you need a toco fix.,UNK
6840,I really liked the large menu variety and all of the vegetarian food but unfortunately my carnivorous husband did not enjoy this place very well. Cozy little place.,UNK
6841,"Food was good, small place. The manager kept making personal calls right at the register which was a little strange, but the food was fantastic. I ordered 2 shawarma (one pita, one baguette) and both were amazing. Worth a visit",UNK
6842,Place is really nice and pretty good service so far.  It would be nice if they got rid of the crappy draft domestic beer and put more craft beer on their 24 taps.  It would also help if the bartenders were actually educated on the craft beer they do serve on draft.,UNK
6843,Great store (prices and selection)!  Great people!  Geat cause!,UNK
6844,"Two hours for an oil change??? I asked to get an appraisal of my SUV to possibly trade it in, that never happened. Then they tell me my vehicle needs over $600.00 worth of maintenance; I think not.",UNK
6845,"Drink was okay, nothing special. The wait was a bit long. Maybe I came when the place was fairly new? Seemed like the staff was still learning. Interior was nice. I'm on the fence giving this place 2 or 3 stars.",UNK
6846,Dinner work meeting. No frills expected. Seating was prompt and servers very attentive and food was good. All good here!,UNK
6847,"Did a great job with grinding our skittish dog's nails, cost us $15 bucks though. Very clean shop, lots of high quality accessories and foods",UNK
6848,"Local restaurant, really small... Owner is the chef... Really funny and nice guy. Very authentic!",UNK
6849,the combos were very good and at a good price. i liked the food at woodlands a bit better but the atmosphere here was a little less take out then there. will be going back!,UNK
6850,I love to get my pedicures from Lee when I go here. He gives the best foot massage ever. Their prices are great and the location is easy to get to.,UNK

6852,The movie I wanted was list at this theater but didn't have. So I had pick a second choice. All in all theater seems fine.,UNK
6853,"Went in for a windshield rock chip repair and it turned out adequately.  Left a little residue on the outside that is visible but it was all charged to my insurance, so that's good.  They even through in a full car wash.",UNK
6854,"I used to go there yearly with the retired in laws. I think they love it. The pizza tastes like it came from a box. Very crowded. Amazing organ player if that's your gig. Everyone should go there once in life, or should they?",UNK
6855,I was pretty disappointed to find out that they do not carry any type of yard art or Talavera pottery... \nI'm always looking to add a little something.,UNK
6856,"This place does offer good sushi and prefixed menu, but it is definitly way over rated. For the price they are asking, I would expect the fish to taste as good as the fishes in Tsukiji Fish Market, in Tokyo.",UNK
6857,Great place to spot for a drink or quick bite to eat while downtown.,UNK
6858,"Super good Chicken Pad Thai! Huge portion for a cheap price. Go there about twice a month for the same exact thing!\n\nThe food is good for about a 20 minute window however, don't try and bring this home...",UNK

6861,"Came in and asked for a certain shoe in size 6 - 7 1/2. The girl working there today responded \""We only have ADULT sizes\"". I have never been so insulted in my life.",UNK
6862,"Cheesesteak, do it the right way, with cheese wiz, perfection. If you're a fan of sweet potato fries they have great ones.\n\nGreat lunch spot, order at the counter and sit, quick service.",UNK
6863,"Quick tip.  I liked the hotel but feel the $20 per night \""service fee\"" is dishonest.  Whatever rate you book at folks, its actually $20 higher when you check out.  Why can't they just be straight about their rate like every other hotel?",UNK
6864,I should have known that this place was doomed since there was no one in there at lunch hour. A crusty cone of cold cheese took ages to get to me despite being the only person in the restaurant. Never again.,UNK
6865,"That is a great cat they have working, but they only have 3 brands of cat food, all of them expensive.  Funny enough though not as expensive as what I was looking for.  They followed me around like I was going to stuff my pockets and that just ruined the whole mom and pop thing.",UNK
6866,"I went into the bar at 12:15 asked to have the Angel game put in the TV. I ate lunch sat there with no drink refill, left at 12:50 they still didn't put the game on. I was the only person in the bar! Pathetic service",UNK
6867,"Everything was bad. From the sticky Spanish rice, to the tap water, to the cold food (that was supposed to be hot), to the service.  Will not go again!",UNK

6869,"Great food, but waay over priced.  Rio is the way to go if you're on a tighter budget..",UNK
6870,"We stopped for breakfast this morning. Everything was ok, but not wonderful. The cashier wasn't listening & failed to give us our pastries. My husbands mocha was more like hot chocolate & my was just ok. My muffin was a bit on the stale side.",UNK
6871,The worst hotel ever\n Worst service in the world,UNK
6872,Dishonest don't trust them or go there. Told my elderly parents they needed a new AC system. All they needed was a few dollars worth of freon.  Dishonest,UNK
6873,Overpriced for breakfast.  \n\nWeird seating arrangement\n.,UNK
6874,"Quantity over quality. When it comes to sushi and seafood, a buffet is definitely NOT the way to go!",UNK
6875,The food is good and the price is fair.  My only complain is that the place was a bit dirty (our table smelled funny and there was a bit of trash on the floor).,UNK
6876,"The food was decent, but this place needs to teach their staff proper service and sanitation. The woman who take my order for bubble tea also handled the cash then brought our drinks out while touching the straws with her hands. So gross and unsanitary..",UNK
6877,Service is slow and has gotten worse since expanding. Food variety is great and the boutique Pastys are very filling.,UNK
6878,My wife had surgery there n we r not very happy with the results n waiting time to be seen by doctor is horribly long. She is not going back,UNK
6879,Its an Ok airport. The Security lines are minimal usually. The Restaurants here are more expensive than other airports that ive been in. Ample parking. Airline staff are helpful and Mccarran has plenty of wheelchairs which is a big plus when your traveling with an elderly passenger.,UNK
6880,"Even for airport food this is pretty low quality. Step up your game if you expect to stay in terminal 4!\n\nOrdered a margherita pizza...very plain, flimsy crust, underwhelming.",UNK
6881,"Essen war sehr gut. Das Preis-Leistung-Verh\u00e4ltnis stimmt auch. Ich denk, wir werden wieder hin gehen, wenn uns nach Thai ist.",UNK
6882,The broth they use is spot on. The noodles tasted packaged. And the gyoza were definitely frozen. But its all worth a trip to this tiny little noodle house.,UNK
6883,Management has no clue what they are doing. Always mess up the orders and management hides in the back. Food could be ok but it never comes out right. They wont be open much longer as boombozz was way better and went out of business.,UNK
6884,So those pictures on yelp of the view from grandview? I snapped those exact same ones using my own camera. For a grand total of $9 + 2.75 atm fee. Bring exact change.,UNK
6885,"My smoothies are always yummy, my favorite is the Peanut Paradise, it's literally heaven after a workout and gets rid of my unhealthy treat craving. \n\nUsually understaffed though, those girls got to be stressed.",UNK
6886,The service was horrible and the food was atrocious. It was worse than bar food. I couldn't even finish my sandwich. Pretty much paid $9 for a diet coke and I'm still hungry and have to find somewhere else to eat.,UNK
6887,Elegant foodie restaurant. Imaginative presentations and flavor combinations. Sorry we didn't have room for dessert.   Very good value.,UNK
6888,"Stopped in with a friend of mine on a busy night. Even though busy, we were greeted and helped by a very friendly sales associate. The store was kept neat and tidy, especially considering it's the holiday shopping season. I would definitely visit this location again.",UNK
6889,"So much crafting, so little time.\n\nGood prices on home decor things, lots of items to complete scrap booking and artsy projects. \n\nSometimes they have great sales, sometimes if an item is not on sale, its over priced.",UNK
6890,"This place is just incredible, all the World and AZ beers you can handle!! My only disappointment was the food was just ok, the tater tots were cooked just right though!",UNK
6891,"Good food and very attentive staff.  I agree with other reviewers, though.  The prices are steep for what you're getting and the beer options could be more diverse than light, medium and dark.",UNK
6892,Good banana smoothies. The place was packed and we were still served in about 15min. I was impressed. Everything was fresh and hot. Breakfast sandwiches are good. I look forward to trying the breakfast pizzas next time.,UNK
6893,"Uber expensive but what isn't in Vegas? I had the 24 ounce Ribeye and it was the bomb. Not $49 worth but great for Vegas. Good service, nice time for 8 dudes eating big steaks.",UNK
6894,"This place is saved by the salsas for the chips. Again lame tacos in the traditional non-mexican style. Nice patio to sit and relax, but they should train better their waitress.",UNK
6895,we ordered a specialty pizza yesterday. and it was one of the best i have ever had!,UNK
6896,"Fast and friendly service, but the coffee in my latte tasted bitter and burnt.",UNK
6897,Is this place someone's house?? This address took is into a neighborhood. I'm confused I can't give any stars really.,UNK
6898,"It's a landmark. One of the originals of sin city. Otherwise there are many places better. But, cool to see.",UNK
6899,"This place has a cool look on the out side but I didn't like the fact that they charged $5 for a tray of measly small samples of 5 different sodas. This is just outrageous.\n\nOverall, tourist trap =P",UNK
6900,Ordered Salmon roll. Rice was hard and dry. I could also buy the same thing at 7eleven for 4.99. Not a good first impression.,UNK
6901,Last time I ate here everything was over salted and my 5 year old thought the pizza was weird(having tried it I concur). I had one good experience and one terrible one so it will average out.,UNK
6902,"Why does it have to be so cold here??\nNobody check the temps in this freezer airport??\n2 stars for finishing with the construction but non for the climate control!\nPlease keep this place airport temp, thank you : )",UNK
6903,"What happened to this place?  it used to be one of my favorite places and now the food has gone way down hill. Worse, our family has gotten food poisoning the last two times they ate there so it is no more for us.  What a shame this place used to be amazing.",UNK
6904,Great atmosphere. Bar staff was incredible. Food was amazing. Highly recommend this sushi spot. They have a little bit of everything on the menu as well. And the surrounding area was incredible. Food was affordable for sure and tasted great.,UNK
6905,Our usual stop for Sat morning breakfast! Can't beat the traditional day starter.  Simple and filling!,UNK
6906,Service was horrible! Took forever! Ordered pancakes and they came burned. Don't waste your time coming here.,UNK
6907,Has everything I need for my pretty kitty and my fish live past 2 days.,UNK
6908,Service was slow. The pulled chicken on my nachos was cold. The braised beef was very chewy. Portions were alright. Prices were also so so.,UNK
6909,dont bother,UNK
6910,"Great food, good service, and an excellent laid back atmosphere. It's a perfect place to get a drink or share a meal whether it be for a night cap or a random Wednesday night outing. You can just go in, seat yourself, and ask the friendly server their beer recommendations.",UNK
6911,"Very good food, but a bit overpriced.",UNK
6912,I loves me some Yogis. Great lunch time spot. Packed most of the time but not too bad with time it takes to get your order made. I always call ahead so its ready when I get there.,UNK
6913,Been coming here for years. They do excellent work and reasonable prices. They also took care of my luggage repair.,UNK
6914,Dont know how this place got 4 stars what a dive nobody there sat 5 min nobody came left won't go again,UNK
6915,Cleanly place. Was satisfied with the bowl of Pho I got.,UNK
6916,"Small, compact aquariums and petting the baby sharks and rays are very cool.  Also the underwater viewing, where it feels you are in a \r\nsunken ship, looking out into the sea and the sharks are impressive. \r\nGo through it in an hour.  $13",UNK
6917,Best scones & croissants in the city by far!!!,UNK
6918,One spider roll with greasy limp crab and iceberg lettuce please.\n\nNo thanks.,UNK
6919,"Very cute place with a great patio, but be warned that the food is really spicy! I enjoy hot food but this was borderline unedible. Margaritas were good and decor is fun and festive. Service was great and exchanged my extra spicy food without issue.",UNK
6920,"Watch out, this Starbucks is more expensive than normal Starbucks locations because its tourist central.",UNK
6921,Good Chinese buffet. Decently priced and a lot of good food.,UNK
6922,"Great little place for Mexican food. Always clean, the food is good to great depending on your choice. Prices are reasonable and if you want more salsa just ask with no upcharge.  Great service and I have never experienced a long wait either. Really glad they are in the neighborhood!",UNK
6923,Meat and two place. Pretty decent food. Great service. Divey.,UNK
6924,"Amazing food, horrible waitress, we asked for a teaspoon and she said they don't have any, then brings a teaspoon anyways???? Idiot! She should be fired.",UNK
6925,"We eat here almost every month, excellent veal and pasta dishes, pizza and likes the seafood salad.",UNK
6926,"Nice, cozy cafe.  The Panini sandwch I had was pretty good, but nothing terribly special.  I should go back and get some pastries because they looked mighty tasty.",UNK
6927,Terrible service! Terrible food! If I could have done 0 stars I would have! Never coming back here again.,UNK
6928,Terrible service.  Food was good,UNK
6929,Today was our second visit and the breakfast is incredible. If you live here or are a tourist with a car go out of your way to have breakfast. Soon to be Best Breakfast in Phoenix. Point your GPS for Town and Country Shopping Center and enjoy. Pancakes are delicious and the coffee is tasty.,UNK
6930,Seriously- ice cream sandwiches 5 star?NO way! The ice cream gelato is good but the ice cream sandwiches is buttered bread with ice cream UGH! Definitely don't know  what all the hype is about,UNK
6931,"The worse customer service I've experienced in Downtown Phoenix. I'm talking zero acknowledgement any customers in the store even existed, followed by severe attitude at the counter with a bonus eye roll. If you're into this place you're better off making a drive to one of their other stores.",UNK
6932,Very dry chicken. Not very tasty.,UNK
6933,The chicken was fresh and very tasty first time there but greasy cant make it a habit,UNK
6934,"Not very good food, especially for the price walk a couple hundred feet and get something to go.",UNK
6935,Nice relaxed atmosphere. Delicious but expensive beer. $8 Brats that don't fill the bun. Hard wooden wobbly stools.,UNK
6936,$12 for a tiny Beef on Weck sandwich and fries... $11 for a pound of wings (that's about 7 wings)...$18.25 for a large cheese and pepperoni pizza... Overpriced bar food to say the least.,UNK
6937,Not sure why this was on Food Network. Chicken was fatty and dark meat in curries. The best parts of the meal were the nan bread and the rice.,UNK
6938,"Food is average, service is poor. We ordered thalis and the quantity was too much for a single person.",UNK
6939,"pretty good stuff. definitely lots of choices in rolls. most of them seem the same though a little repetitive. overall taste was good, service was really good, price was ok",UNK
6940,"New location, same crappy attitude. I dislike most of the people that work here. They are usually pretty rude. Their selection is ok although I think their prices are high for used clothing. Very rarely someone will approach you to see if you need any help.",UNK
6941,"What a great little bar, this will be another Arcadia success story. However, I don't like having to leave my drink inside just to go for a smoke. A tiny patio in the back with a table or two for drinks would be fine.",UNK
6942,It is not terrible but there are much better Mexican food places.,UNK
6943,"I love Pho, but not to Pho Kim Long...I've had better! \n\nI give it 2 stars for the convenience of its operating hours.",UNK
6944,"Meh, nothing special at all! Had the brisket sliders, more like fat sliders. Save yourself the nausea....",UNK
6945,"One of my top favorite BBQ joints in Charlotte! The fish tacos are pretty tasty, too!",UNK
6946,nice service and sandwiches are outstanding. great,UNK
6947,"The service was great and food came quickly.  The prices were good and the menu was easy to navigate.  I love their online menu.  Unfortunately, the food wasn't anything to write home about.  No one in my party of 3 cared for their dishes.",UNK
6948,"Nice clean bar with a ton of beer options.  Full bar as well.  I didn't order any food, but I saw a burger come out that looked pretty good.",UNK
6949,"This was the worst Persian food I have ever had. The service was even worse than the food. I will never go there again, I have been in many persian restaurants in LA and the Bay Area, this one stands at the bottom of the list. I recommend anything else but Habib.",UNK
6950,Good coffee and nice staff!  A nice place to and have a cup of coffee after have a poor dinner at the Sushi place next store!,UNK
6951,Gross... the only great thing about my meal was the chedder biscuits. I knew by the look of my meal when it came to the table I was going to get food poisoning. I WAS RIGHT.,UNK
6952,"They offer unlimited uni and ama ebi, but overall quality of this place is worse than average.  With so many AYCE sushi places in town, you can do much better.  But I have friends that love this place because all they want to eat is subpar uni.",UNK
6953,"Update. As of July 6, 2012, It looks like this place is closed. Does anyone know for sure?",UNK
6954,Tried the new Angus Steak bagel. YUM! Drive-thru was fast and service was polite and efficient.,UNK
6955,This restaurant is terrible!  My wife picked up two BBQ brisket sandwiches and the meat was tasteless and dryed out;  not mention the shitty sauce and white bun it was served on. It was a $20 rip in the a$$.,UNK
6956,over priced! not worth service! was not happy with color at all.,UNK
6957,So...many...sinks...felt the need to constantly wash my hands...,UNK
6958,Can't say this is even close to the Best of Madison. We had awful service and our food was nowhere near best of anything.,UNK
6959,"Fanz has apparently closed. Maybe 2-3 weeks ago?\nI can understand why....Not the best sports bar around, mediocre service and OK food.",UNK
6960,"Bland. While the decor is lovely and the customer service was above average, the food was just not impressive. I was disappointed, because the menu left much to desire. If you want some seriously great Thai food, try the Pink Pepper in Mesa.",UNK
6961,Prima Lage um an einem sonnigen Tag ein k\u00fchles Getr\u00e4nk zu sich zu nehmen.,UNK
6962,"Great service, but overpriced. Kind of like a med end chipotle. If you are looking for authentic Mexican food and salsa this is not the place, but it appears healthier then others.",UNK
6963,"Fantastic wraps and pizza that we all shared! \nAwesome beer selection!\nGreat service, I would defiantly come back soon.",UNK
6964,"I had a pretty great Reuben here the other day. I hadn't been in a while, but I feel my criticism of the slow service/high prices remains a problem. But the Reuben was really good, so there is that.",UNK
6965,Love the atmosphere here and the waitress was super nice and friendly. The cheese garlic bread sticks were very good. The downside....the pizza. It was soggy and greasy. Normally that doesnt really bother me however that plus the weird tasting sauce just made it sub par.,UNK
6966,One f the best hot dOgs I've had. It did not break or spill or get all over places. I dislike the daiquiri though. It was too sweet.,UNK
6967,So this is what people talk about when going to larger cities and dealing with waiting in lines.  Had no idea that when we entered we'd be given a number and asked to wait.  Thankfully the wait time wasn't too long and things moved pretty rapidly.,UNK
6968,Very customer focused down to earth staff& food is home cookin& filling. Very packed dining area butt staff makes you feel like you are the only guests.\nBig variety in menu,UNK
6969,Came in at 700 pm Saturday night  place is clean  .  Waitresses were slow. Handling to many tables each\n30 minute ticket times   food was average    I'll skip next time ......,UNK
6970,20 mins to get service and then another 30 waiting for drinks. Went to the bar to find out what was going on. They finally told us they were looking for the alcohol that goes in the drinks...BS!! Avoid this place like the plague!!!,UNK
6971,Went to this place twice. Both times the meat was it extremely dry. Some of the chopped brisket was drier than beef jerky.,UNK
6972,One of the better pizzas I've had in Phx. Sry Domino's!,UNK
6973,"Love their Chop House Salad.  Some entrees can be too salty.  Overall, a fun place!",UNK
6974,Just a quick update - A month later and still no response from the letter I wrote to the manager. At this point I know that it's over and done with but I will not be staying there again. Really poor customer service.,UNK
6975,1 car in the drive thru = 15 minutes,UNK
6976,"Good place, rooms are nice but slightly worn - maybe due for a refresh.  Wi-fi stinks - good reception but constantly drops the connection.  Great location, good rates, breakfast is very nice.",UNK
6977,The worst home warranty insurance I have ever seen. They are rude and unprofessional. They are so scared that they don't even let you talk to the owner if you have a complain.,UNK
6978,"Beautiful rooms, excellent meeting spaces. The beds are like clouds and the double shower head in the bathroom was amazing. \n\nHowever, the customer service lacks excellence and the WiFi is completely unreliable.",UNK
6979,"Great little atmosphere, but dinner was not that great. I think when we go back it will be for drinks and apps and from looking at what others were ordering, that might be the way to go.",UNK
6980,overall this place gets 3 stars due to the lack of customer service but great ass Filipino food in Vegas !,UNK
6981,"Very basic American Standard food nothing exotic but, good. Come in Sunday mornings for the big breakfast skillet.",UNK
6982,The postings are accurate.  This place fails to succeed on almost every measure.\n\nIt's real bright spot is its location.  For breakfast sometimes that's enough.,UNK
6983,"Service is bad! We had deserts, thue Sundae is a bunch of ice cream and whipped cream, and cocktails come fancy... even these things the slow waiter messed up!",UNK
6984,Driving by and tried it for lunch.  The staff tried hard to accommodate me because I was in a hurry and illegally parked outside.  Pizza was pretty good and service excellent.,UNK
6985,The service sucks. The food is ok. Don't let the good ambience of the place fool you. The only good thing is the chips and salsa.,UNK
6986,"Shitty food, not very good service. Never return. This place is NOT good. Expensive with no Good Seafood at all.",UNK
6987,"I was duped!!!! Lack of karaoke. DJ talks too much. If I wanted to go to a club, I'd have gone to one. The food is the saving grace.",UNK
6988,"I had my meal on the premises while with a friend (I usually take it home) and it was a pretty decent experience.  The store is clean and the staff are so friendly they make you feel right at home.  Thanks, PoS!",UNK
6989,If you like it slow and stinky this is the place.  And I like fast food when I'm at airports :(,UNK
6990,"Loved it. Good prices good food, love the variety of Mexican cheeses, tortillas  and sweet breads.",UNK
6991,Great location and very friendly baristas. Pretty standard selection; the cappuccino I ordered did not change my life but was tasty.,UNK
6992,"Suites are very large. However, you can hear everything going on outside and thru the bearing walls in each bedroom. I had to turn the fan on and insert earplugs to attempt and drown it out. Aaargh.",UNK
6993,"If you order anything more than appetizers and expect a quality meal, you'll be somewhat let down..",UNK
6994,Italian tapas.  Small trendy place in Vieux Montreal.  Very good small plates for a late night meal.  We did wait a while to be seated because host was also waiting tables.  Once seated food came out quickly.  Very friendly service. A bit high priced.  Overall a nice place.,UNK
6995,"Beautiful waterside setting contrasted by tasteless eggs, greasy hash browns and weak coffee",UNK
6996,"Some of the BEST Spanish Rice I've ever had - usually not a fan of it in general, but tried it here, and LOVED it. Tacos are good as well, lots of options. Recommend getting several kinds, including the baja taco.",UNK
6997,Great street tacos!  Small portions but a good enough deal. The downfall is this is a no gun zone so I will not come back. Because we all know the criminals obey the no gun zone signs right? .,UNK
6998,Very quirky place but very good lunch. The kind of hole in the wall where you find business suits and tank tops. The food is quite unique and tasty. Very reasonable,UNK
6999,I have been playing dollar slots for over one hour and have not been offered one single drink. This in my opinion qualifies as bad customer service. In fact I haven't seen one person walk around with a drink tray inquiring if anyone wants a drink.,UNK
7000,"Okay, I decided I wanted acrylics and gave Phoenix Nails another shot. This experience was much better than my last! I love my nails! I decided to go with the gel polish and I am glad I did.",UNK
7001,"When going from Tempe to Old Town, the big orange bus is definitely the way to go.  Get a group of at least 5 people together and it's only $3 per person.  The drivers are usually very friendly (and attractive) and arrive on time!",UNK
7002,$6.25 for an iced coffee isn't expensive it is price gouging.,UNK
7003,"Just not a very good foot doctor. I have written about two others that I have visited and this one \"" just takes the cake\"" rude, expensive didn't listen and just wanted to cut! Don't Go!",UNK
7004,"Nice people and good service, its just too cold inside!",UNK
7005,"I went into Transformations for a consultation & the experience was horrible. The facility is gorgeous but the people, especially Dr. Afifi, were unkind, impatient, & had very little knowledge  of the procedure I was interested in or any people skills. Do not use this clinic!",UNK
7006,"Actually better than good, this is the new one across 215 from Costco.  Have eaten several times at Centennial and is also good.    The only problem was when i got home it was the wrong order, chicken vs beef teriyaki.",UNK
7007,"I was in the Strip last week and noticed that their sign is still just white grease pencil in the window.  You stay classy, guys.",UNK
7008,"Bad service, mediocre food.  Wouldn't go out of my way to eat here, but it'll do in a pinch.",UNK
7009,One of my go-to's!,UNK
7010,"I order it for my employees occasionally.  The pizza is what you expect, nothing better than OK.  They throw on an extra $1.50 for delivery charge and the drivers tell us that most goes directly to the managers pockets.  That Sucks.",UNK
7011,"I like the Eiffel Tower and Arc du Triumph in front.  Except they're all mashed up and give the place a claustrophobic effect.  Also, what's up with the crazy \""sky\"" thing inside?  Kinda weird.",UNK
7012,"Dos y dos, carne taco, taco sampler, fried banana, tres leches.  Lots of food for the price paid.",UNK
7013,"Your standard Panda Express with the typical, salt-laden dishes but the prices are decent for the Strip and it is super fast!",UNK
7014,Pretty good pizza. One of the better pizza places in Pittsburgh. The pepperoni they use is pretty good. It is a nice cup and char.  Sauce is decent too.,UNK
7015,Great Spot! The chocolate chip Cookie French toast is amazing. HUGE portions as well. Dare anyone to try and finish those two slices of heaven in one sitting.,UNK
7016,I used to love the Turkey Cranberry sandwich.  It has changed for the worse.  Now just a couple of crappy slices of turkey that look like something from the back of my fridge.  The cookie quality has declined as well.,UNK
7017,I think this video sums up my opinion of this restaurant.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df0BXSnBr1Q&feature=related,UNK
7018,"Great happy hour scene and food selection. Honesty i would say the seafood is generally avg given pricing, but the meat dishes are really quality and worth your time and $$&",UNK
7019,i would give this a 2 star.  the place is just disorganized.  lots of products and lots of different brands.  there is a huge parking in front. they close at 8 p.m.,UNK
7020,Had a grilled chicken salad. Chicken was over cooked and very dry. I asked for honey mustard and got ranch. The girls seemed to be rushed with little time for good service.  Not sure I'll return.,UNK
7021,"Had dinner last night. We each had the chicken fajita a decent sized portion, unable to finish. Pleasant tasting; nothing remarkable, but certainly ok.",UNK
7022,"Horrible, overcooked noodles, burnt-tasting curry, watered-down drinks and the kicker: the worst service from the rudest male bartender. Never again. Just no.",UNK
7023,food is good because it's Barros but the appetizers and salads come out with the pizza... this is the third time its happened. the location in QC is waaaay better.,UNK
7024,"Great beer and authentic German fare.  A very good option for big groups - they can handle it.  Generally busy.  Not the place to go for vegetarian options, although they might have one or two.  It is very nice for kids.",UNK
7025,Fooled by the ambience.. Bad food.,UNK
7026,"Service sucks, tiny portions, WAY OVER PRICED! Will not return.",UNK
7027,The tacos were awesome. Very authentic Mexican food....they also have a children menu which is very beneficial to me cuz I act like a 3 year old from time to time.,UNK
7028,"Meh, slow. No service to speak of way too much $$ for the so so food. I walk in the front door, no one greets us. We didnt know where to sit. It was chaotic. The pastries are good, but I wont be back.",UNK
7029,"The place was completely empty however the women working there had impeccable service and was very helpful. She did an excellent job with my brows. I'm not from Madison and I was looking for a place to walk in, but I will definitely come back next time I'm in town",UNK

7031,"The only reason why I am giving this a 3, is because the Bison Burger was great! Other then that, coming from So.Cali, this Mexican style of food does not compare. But I would give it a try again.",UNK
7032,"Tries too hard to be \""sensual\"" over compensates with boobs burlesque show style.  The host was bad too.",UNK
7033,"Convenient location for me.  It's a good place to play bingo, I haven't won much on the slots.  The live music is generally pretty good.  The ventilation system for smoke could be better.",UNK
7034,"It is a Taco Bell. The restaurant that was supposed to take over the world. Not as cheap as it was back in the day, but still good quick food. Friendly staff.",UNK

7040,"I stopped by for a quick bite.  Very pricey, as is everything in Vegas, but the steak was wonderful!",UNK
7041,"I was only there once, the food was average and an older guy, possibly the owner thought it would be okay to sit at our table, spread out his newspaper and sip his coffee. I hope he enjoyed himself cause we sure didn't.",UNK
7042,"One of my favorite pizza joints in town. Been going here since they let you draw on the tables with crayons. The pizza is usually amazing, but the pizza varies depending on who cooks it. Love the bread that comes with dinner too.  Overall very good.",UNK
7043,Mom's favorite is the honey walnut shrimp and the food here is always fresh,UNK
7044,"I'm not digging it. Yes, the atmosphere might be fun, but the cupcakes weren't to my expectations. Dry \""cake\"", generic/ processed frosting, and overall not a super good experience.",UNK
7045,"First time and I wasn't impressed. Chicken is flavorless, dry and way too pricey. Will not return.",UNK
7046,Check in on Yelp and get 20% of services.,UNK
7047,"We stop in this QT every time we pass by, which varies from a few times a month to months in between.  It's on our way to play baseball some 60 miles from home.  The people here are friendlier than average, even moreso than most QTs.",UNK
7048,"This is a local bar and not a fine dining restaurant, but they have a very friendly staff and serve a great Friday night all you can eat fish fry. If you can get past the noise level and the plain and simple accommodations, you will enjoy the food and the service.",UNK
7049,The absolute rudest person and the highest prices of any estate sales! What an awful combination so do not waste your time by going to any of their sales only to get abused and gouged.,UNK
7050,"The place has an awful smell, the condiments table is super dirty, and my Chicago beef was lackluster",UNK
7051,Never seen so many desperate people queuing on a busy roundabout - so dangerous.  We're only talking doughnuts but I guess you are speaking to a nation that eat fried mars bars.  Surely doughnuts are not the latest Scottish craze?!,UNK

7055,Place looks great but is just more of the same in Town Square. Food and service wasn't better than just ok. I thought prices were high for lunch,UNK
7056,The deuce. Pricey ass drinks as per usual.,UNK
7057,Excellent food fast and nice reminds me of NYC diners,UNK
7058,"What a horrible horrible place. They make you wait in line when nobody is inside the bar. Meanwhile, they let dozens of people in the front with no issue. They're trying to be LA or Vegas. Complete failure.",UNK
7059,Just wanted a small cup of coffee.  Maybe it was old but pH was low enough to etch metal.  The soy milk they added curdled upon impact.  I had one sip and tossed it immediately.  I won't go back.  Where can one get good coffee and not a blended drink?,UNK
7060,"Food was okay, but kinda plain. Wasn't sure if there was seasoning on the burger or not. The cashier also said we had to use all of the $40 on one visit, which it does not say on the groupon, so beware",UNK
7061,Sorry to break to you but  it seems another Village  inn has bitten the dust...,UNK
7062,Our stay was ok at most. Room not clean. Staff not helpful. Cafe food in hotel - yuck. Not going back.,UNK
7063,Its ok. If you like teppan but the sushi needs little attention here.  Better off going to real Japanese sushi places if you want sashimi or anything special.,UNK
7064,Located on the 64th floor of Mandalay Bay Hotel on the Las Vegas Strip where the view of the city is breathtaking.  I celebrated my 25th birthday here and we'll be celebrating my friend's 25th birthday here tonight! I love this place ~ ambiance is techie yet comfortable.,UNK

7070,"Excellent korean bbq tacos, quick service from friendly proprietor made this an awesome, cheap lunch.",UNK

7073,Food was great. Only 3 stars because you stare at gross people at the pool (you might lose you appetite) or people shuffling through the middle of the restaurant. It's loud and hard to enjoy your meal. 4 stars for the service we received.,UNK
7074,"Wish you would have never left Rock Hill, sorry to see y'all close but never went to your new location.",UNK
7075,"Decided to tryout local BBQ place based on positive reviews. Got pork dinner, Mac and cheese, and BBQ slaw. Not a very good meal at all. Pork was sticky and slimy. Mac and cheese tasted processed and BBQ slaw had no flavor.",UNK
7076,What's the point of a reservation if I still have to wait 30 minutes?!? The brunch lacks order and the staff is mediocre in managing the crowds of those with reservations versus walk-ins. Could have found better things to do with my time.,UNK
7077,"The \""live\"" band was straight cover lip sync trash. Just keep the DJ on.\n\nFree fun, though at times they do charge a cover.",UNK
7078,Dr costa is amazing but she left. We will follow her anywhere and know of many others who feel the same,UNK
7079,Yelp had to remind me that I ate here. I ate the burger waiting in line because USAirways cancelled all the outbound flights to SFO for no reason.  So there's two things in this review that I would hesitate before doing again.,UNK

7085,My room was dirty had bed bugs that bit my Johnson first night. Next morning I noticed my sheets looked like it hadn't been washed. Room was shitty to.,UNK
7086,Hayden Hidalgo...stop leaving your crap flyers in unwanted sections of stores. Your gym sucks and you make it almost impossible for someone to cancel their membership.,UNK
7087,"The food is great, very relaxing.  The service staff is not in your face every ten seconds, but if you need something they are right there to get it.  Parking is a little painful, as you will need to valet your car, otherwise your forced to walk about a block to park.",UNK
7088,Decent food and close to the airport.,UNK
7089,Decent buffet I think it was $10 at lunch when we went.  They had a decent selection of hot foot and sushi type rolls. I'd go back for sure!,UNK
7090,"Terrible! Worse buffet I have ever been too. would not go back. Very disappointing. Most of the food choices were empty trays, no one spoke english, just an awful place.",UNK
7091,I had a free dozen originals coupon my boss sent me there with. When i told the guy what I was getting he rolled his eyes at me! I get it you're not making a profit from me today but I won't be going back after that. How rude!,UNK
7092,"Meh, my filet was overcooked, service was slow. Ambiance was nice but ..nothing really special. The sides were a la carte. If you're looking for a good steakhouse, look elsewhere.",UNK
7093,I literally waited in the car 10 mins before the order came out in the drive thru! Did someone say fast food!?? Oh and it wasn't even for me,UNK
7094,Scale of 1-10 (single visit):\n8 Food\nn/a Service\n7 Atmosphere\n8 Value\n\nPay-by-the-pound is always greatness.,UNK
7095,"Guys. You charge .99 for one donut but 5.99 for a half dozen.  C'mon fix the sign.  I have brought this before on premise but the argued the sign wasn't wrong, but inside it's still 5.99.   fix the sign.",UNK
7096,Place is closed they need to update the yelp site they closed with 0 notice to anyone kind of a poor way to treat loyal customers don't just shit your doors one day without notice,UNK
7097,Pretty hotel with awesome views. But minus one star for the construction out front that has been there forever. It's also not immune to hair in the shower. Drain was so bad I had to shower quickly so it wouldn't overflow.,UNK
7098,Awesome food! All i got to say. They deliver and you also can eat in. Friendly people also! Portions are good size.,UNK
7099,"Wow really packed and really big... a big circle. If your diligent and patient, you might find a few good deals. Has your average stores with a few specialty's. The food court is about the same as well.",UNK
7100,Closed. Next nearest location is at the Best Western on Rue Drummond. I feel they lost something during the move. I don't enjoy the food as much in their new location.,UNK
7101,"The pizza was good, but then again it's kinda hard to mess up. If you are looking for a quick fix and you're in City Center then I'd recommend it. I wouldn't say it is worth going out of your way to try.",UNK
7102,"It always seems to be lacking in the protein department. Not enough meat. The service was super rushed this time despite my $30 bill for s single diner. The food ultimately is awesome. Service, and perhaps presentation of the protein would be beneficial.",UNK
7103,Carne Asada Fries. By. The. Pound. I love this place. I will admit the place is small but the food isn't.,UNK
7104,"One of the cheaper places to stay on the strip, but they definitely need to up grade the rooms. Seems as if the only things they've really upgraded in the rooms are the beds and tv (which can swivel). Other than that everything else is pretty old school.",UNK
7105,It's not the worst option for fast food style airport food. They have veggie tacos that provide reasonable portions and nice scoops of guacamole. The rice is awful and the salsa is more like pizza sauce. Although it's affordable and quick.,UNK
7106,Nothing about the food is woth mention.  Good place for atmosphere not much else.  Grab your beer and paper hat and GTFO.,UNK
7107,"It's a new place, looks good and clean. As far as the food I give it a 8 out of 10. All you can eat Mongolian food.",UNK
7108,my iPhones were broken and the 2 phones were fixed in about 1 1/2 hours. great service and very pleased with the ease and speed. definitely recommend it!!,UNK

7110,it was okay.....small place but the food was good....large portions....,UNK
7111,"Crowded store, with plenty of goods. Didn't find outlet pricing particularly compelling, esp. given Kate Spade is a frequent Gilt feature. Staff was so-so.",UNK
7112,"Horrible service, called in order and messed it up quite badly and I will suggest my work gets catering from somewhere else and I for sure will not order here again since they messed my order up 3 times.",UNK
7113,"It was okay. My husband & I went there last week & neither of us have any real complaints. Everything was okay... the food was mediocre, the service was fine but nothing over the top.",UNK
7114,I had a new unit installed and have had nothing but problems with there \npoor workmanship. Eventually I had to a get a lot of it redone by a professional.,UNK
7115,"Worst service I've ever had. Paid for $100 car wash, an hour and a half later came back and they forgot about my car. Then had to argue 30 minutes for a full refund. On top of it all I love with a dirty car. Never going back.",UNK
7116,"Surprised that this is still listed, they have been closed for a couple of years now... Hmmm..",UNK
7117,This place is amazing. The service is so fast I think it takes less time to get my food there than at a mcdonalds. Great food decent staff.,UNK
7118,Would I rather pay too much for mediocre hot dogs or mediocre pizza? Count this as another winning data point for mediocre pizza.,UNK
7119,I got a burnt fish. Thanks for the lunch tho. It was great eating burnt fish... On a date...,UNK
7120,"HUGE ROACH CRAWLING UP THE WALL! They didn't even kill it because it got away  a table next to is said casually, \""oh there's another one?\""So gross food wasn't good enough to deal with that",UNK
7121,"Very friendly service at the drive thru!! 48 degrees out side, I'm ordering a large chili!",UNK
7122,"Good coffee ... i'm not eating doughnuts or bagels at the moment, so it's hard to rate their signature foods. Ask me again in 40 pounds.",UNK
7123,"Food is great.. Fairly good amount..sumptuous!! But pls we need the Buko pandan back, k?",UNK
7124,"Nice little pub. Nothing amazing, nothing horrible. I'd come back but wouldn't go out of my way for it.",UNK
7125,"Several steps above Pei Wei - I come here for lunch frequently.  The Singapore Noodles are great, as are many of their stir frys.  Locally owned and operated!  This place has many regulars, I know of one couple that eats there every day!",UNK
7126,"Food was good, but not great.  Service was fantastic, but atmosphere was only so-so.  Get the Mac and cheese",UNK
7127,"Overall a very good Chinese restaurant.  The Orange chicken, Beef broccoli and Triple delight a very good.  The Teriyaki chicken was just ok and the egg roll was good, but not great. Very reasonably priced very good food.",UNK
7128,"Wow, not the place you want to patronize if you like customer service as part of your shopping experience.  That'll teach me for trying to patronize \""the little guy\"". Unfortunately, that's why they are where they are.",UNK
7129,Waited half an hour for a very simple order to take out and watched several other customers come in after me and leave with their food before me. Food was cold when I received it. Overall disappointed.,UNK
7130,I love coming here.  Being able to make my noodles the way I want is awesome plus the kids love it.  Very affordable too. It gets very busy around lunch time but the line moves fast.,UNK
7131,"For an airport eatery this is above par, hense the 4 stars. Decent medium well cooked burger with slaw. \n\nWould be a 3 star outside of an airport though.",UNK
7132,"Cramped Seating, Old, and small compartment above for carry on.  At least I made it back to SFO alive!!!!  They get a star for that.",UNK
7133,"Love, love, love Los Taquitos!  Their carne asada burro and their quesadillas are stellar.  What's even better is that their prices are so reasonable.  I am never going to Taco Bell again.",UNK
7134,"They don't have sunomono! No cucumber salad! The miso soup was watery, where's the miso? All the rolls are tiny, and very basic. Unmemorable",UNK
7135,Seriously I have two jimmy johns the same distance from me and neither will deliver. To me that's just a pathetic excuse to be lazy.,UNK
7136,"good service, cheap good pizza      PRO TIP,  check in on foursquare and get discount",UNK
7137,"My first time into a Pita Jungle in a few years, and now I'm a fan. Shwarma wrap was excellent but the garlic dip won over our whole table.",UNK
7138,"I love jazzercise, for me it is fun and effective. I've lost inches down from size 10 to 8.  The variety makes it fun and the instructors are great.",UNK
7139,"New location! same great service and tasty food. I got the cannelloni again and no regrets. I wish they had more pasta options, like cappelletti or other salsas like boscaiola!. Still, the antipasto is a winner!!",UNK
7140,"Pros: Broad menu selection. Cons: Unrealistic beer prices... at least, for Guinness. At $6.50 per (imperial) pint, it's the most expensive Guinness in Charlotte.",UNK
7141,Good food but the service could use some help.  I think the portion sizes could go up or the prices should come down.  You shouldnt leave a place hungry after spending $38.  \n\nI would rate them lower but I have had good meals here.,UNK
7142,"Fun, but for a family of 4 to go two times, it's $78, way too expensive to come back!!",UNK
7143,"The plating is really good~ great ambiance and great view, but in terms of good itself, I would say it's hit or miss. Good for date",UNK
7144,"So sad, they closed this business.",UNK
7145,"What a great find in Vegas right across the way from the Hard Rock, the price is right, and the food is on point, I suggest the greek salad to all you salad love rs with the feta dressing, pasta rocks, pizza bomb.",UNK

7147,waited long time but well wort hit.i will return.,UNK
7148,The service was great. The food was subpar for the price. Both steaks were subpar in quality,UNK
7149,Very fun and entertaining show for the entire family!,UNK
7150,Went there this morning and had the bacon burrito...YUM! Talk about filling...I have a big appetite and this place fills me up~\n\nCheck it out if you are in the area it is so worth it!,UNK
7151,I saw this restaurant on triple D and I love it!  Kudos on the Emerald Chicken and Jade Red Chicken.  Mexican - Asian fusion combines two of my favorite cuisines and its budget friendly.  It doesn't get any better than this :),UNK
7152,Food quality and service is progressively getting worse. They used to use cashews in their salads and now it's peanuts. They are also very unorganized and inefficient with their food orders.,UNK
7153,I witnessed the manager yelling at the employees and threatening them with mandatory overtime or else they can leave...who does that? very unprofessional.I left the store and bought the same outfit on Amazon. I will never come back,UNK
7154,Try the flavor of the month: Bananas Foster - yum!,UNK

7157,clean and nice,UNK
7158,I love greasy disgusting pizza so we eat Here once in awhile. The staff totally suck and now we just expect it and laugh. I think I saw a guy with a full beard and no covering in the kitchen. I checked for beard hair in my pizza and didn't see any.,UNK
7159,"Filthy! Floors, drink station, everything! Returned my sons apples that were completely brown and watched the employee rummage through many more before bringing out a new box... He handed them to me and they were expired.  Never again.",UNK
7160,Service is slow and the meals are uninspired. Please see the photo of the marinated Jindori chicken as takeout for $28. What a ripoff.  I am pissed just looking at the small size of it. There is less than a drumstick amount of chicken.,UNK
7161,This place is close to home however the customer service is horrible. And if you complain it only gets worse. They crank so many people through they don't care if you are happy. Some competition close by could make them reevaluate how they treat customers.,UNK
7162,"This place blows. In addition, they keep posting photos that clogs up my feed!  They seem to think they can post photos for free advertising, but their service is horrible.",UNK
7163,"It's a perfect place to go after a night on the strip. The decorations are slightly eccentric, but the people are great and the portions are large. I definently recommend the waffles. :)",UNK

7167,Tap water !?! :/   try filtering u r food and ice tea will b much better!...farm fish..is Disgusting. ..,UNK
7168,"Yummy pizza that offers both delivery and carryout. Much better than most of the other chain pizza restaurants; I despise Papa John's, Pizza Hut, etc., but Hungry Howie's is a great place to get some tasty food.",UNK
7169,"Good prices, but terrible customer service. The people that work there were not friendly at all. I wouldn't go back, I don't care how much cheaper they are. Would it hurt them to smile and say please and thank you?",UNK
7170,Overpriced crap.,UNK
7171,"Absolutely horrible service and the pizza was NOT in my top 10 in South Hills let alone the top in Pittsburgh. Asked for something specific. When delivered, it was wrong. When we called, the person who took the call was rude. HORRIBLE.",UNK
7172,"Service, food, atmosphere was blah. Won't be back.",UNK
7173,Me and my Business partner had dinner there last night. Ordered the Chief special with Kobe Ribeye and My partner ordered the Filet. Both were good. Nothing to rave over thou. I would expect better quality for the price and would probably choose a different steak house next time.,UNK
7174,Over priced at $21.99 per person.  Food is gross . . . extremely noisy . . .kids running around like it is a playground.  I will never set foot in this place again.,UNK

7178,It was a good $10 for Lunch. Seafood is good here as well as the fruits and deserts..the hibachi station is worth trying. But I'm not excited about it,UNK
7179,Its a hardware store. Not the greatest service ( no one ever available),UNK
7180,Sushi was ok not bad.Do have to say there tuna tar tar is yums. Hubby had fish and chips he said the fries where good but not the fish.,UNK

7182,closed due to the roof collapsed during a monsoon rain,UNK
7183,I wouldn't recommend this place if you're looking for a bar. I had four drinks in two hours along with dinner and the waitress cut me off. I was no where closed to being even buzzed. Was really offensive. Wouldn't come back unless I sat at the bar directly.,UNK
7184,Beef tacos were very good (4-star). Guacamole was runny and had some rind/pit in it.  Other sides were just OK.,UNK
7185,Service during happy hour in the bar area is just so-so. The service in the actual restaurant is excellent. Shrimp and eggplant is my favorite appetizer.,UNK
7186,"Pretty shitty place. Bad atmosphere, bad food.",UNK
7187,"Yummy  I love ph, and I've been to many a Vietnamese restaurant looking for ph. This place has wonderful ph, especially for Arizona. I love their broken rice dishes as well; the eggs and the pork are delicious.",UNK

7192,"Seriously their jalapeno corn bread, with the honey sweet butter was amazing!! I would come back for that. Their BBQ ribs are pretty good too, but man won me with the corn bread! The service was pretty good. I can't complain!",UNK
7193,what is it with Wendys ?  They never get the orders right. If any of the employees would smile I would die from shock.  This review applies to many of the Wendys  that I have been to. Even in Florida.  Do they train them to be rude and ignorant ?,UNK
7194,Looking for Lychee? Bayside buffet has it for breakfast!,UNK
7195,Pretty good NC barbeque. Had some pork and brisket and both had good flavor and were very juicy. Having six different sauces also helps because you can determine which one you prefer.,UNK
7196,"Best sushi I have in Goodyear, AZ thus far. It is a bit pricey, but the quality and taste are on point. I would recommend to others",UNK
7197,DO NOT get the wanton soup or anything wanton for that matter. One order of wanton soup comes with 4 pieces of wanton. Each wanton was 98% wrapper 2% meat. Total rip off!! Worst wanton in my life!,UNK
7198,A State agency.  I have worked for 4 agencies and this is one of the best.  Caring and compassionate management and friendly coworkers.,UNK
7199,Very disappointed.  Plus there was an actual leaf blower in the back of the restaurant that left me uneasy,UNK
7200,"Slightly overrated, but pretty good stuff. The food and beer is expensive for the C-U. Better than Giordanos. Get there early and be prepared to wait b/c it is popular and can get very crowded, especially on fridays.",UNK
7201,This place is so terrible.  Don't waste your money or time.  Only thing that was ok was the batting cage.  Staff horrible management even worse!,UNK
7202,Dueling pianos?\nDrankin' drinks? \nYeah. \nBring it.,UNK
7203,"Another Sergakis location. Food ordered from here actually gets made at sports station and then run over. Different vibe from station and kbox, much more relax and less Tvs.",UNK
7204,Just purchase coupon called them to confirm  they said you need 24 hours notice we only in town for tonight it dose not say any thing about that on the voucher and I thing all the review are fake  on this place,UNK

7207,Out of yellowtail ! Out of snapper ! Wtf ?,UNK

7209,"We go to Yama quite a bit as it close to our office for lunch.  I really like the Spicy Seafood salad, however it seems they have cut the portion size way down.  The server today was not very attentive either.",UNK
7210,For the best dogs in Charlotte they tasted fair...I've had much worse but also much better...we've had better hotdogs at home.  Fries and chips were OK.  Milkshakes were not great.  Service was good.  Overall it was just OK.,UNK

7212,"Okay shopping mall. Variety of stores, many chains like footlockers, gap, h & m, loft,....it's fun to go for a little afternoon of shopping.",UNK
7213,You can skip this place. .too many pretend cowboy wannabees..if you don't look the part they won't dance with you. .you will have more fun across the street at What the Hell bar and grill. ..,UNK
7214,"Drive-thru is always fast.\n\nI don't like going inside, though. Inside has a very different atmosphere. The staff there seems less interested in customer service. But the drive thru team is stellar.",UNK
7215,This place is overpriced and overrated... there are a bunch of kids in it and you can get a much better burger at five guys.,UNK
7216,"Great pad, delicious curry and the best sticky rice and mango. Small portions and pricey but definitely still great. The place itself was hard to find and doesn't look like much from the outside, but the inside has a really nice authentic feel to it.",UNK
7217,Um - I would like to report a rape !\n\nI ordered a 2 piece dark meal with a side of fries and a bottle of water - \n\n$10.57 - i should have told that kid where he could have put that chicken.,UNK
7218,"Looking for the best hangover meal? or maybe a late night, been drinking all day kinda dish? They have really good soup. Big portions too.",UNK
7219,Rushed us in and out.  The food was excellent but the service was so rushed and the floor host hovered so much that it made it an unpleasant dinner. Too bad because it had the potential to be a great meal.,UNK
7220,"Fenomenal fresh fries, fine burgers and sandwiches, friendly good service.\n\nIf you're going to go crazy and break all those resolutions about not eating....this is a pretty good place to break that resolution with fries and a sandwich.",UNK
7221,-Fancy salad place.\n\n-Salads are very yummy.\n\n-Parking is a pain in the butt.\n\n-Pricey for lunch.,UNK
7222,"Great baked clams, desserts are good, fresh ravioli awesome. Service was terrific. This place reminds me of the Italian restaurants in NY",UNK
7223,"I tried this place, there food is good. They make the best egg rolls.  I never had to wait  long for a table also. It is BYOB",UNK
7224,"Blue lemon is a real cute place, the decor is great, love their little coffee bar area! I ordered the Mediterranean salad with chicken it was yummy and light!  I would go again!",UNK
7225,"Great location, sea food is fresh, I enjoy the end of the week.  Garlic Shrimp dish blew me away.  One of those places when you finally eat there you were thinking why it took so long.  Real Food is here, Look for their three locations in the Valley",UNK
7226,We ate at Native last Tuesday because of their wing special. We walked out without having to pay for the bill. My wife and kids meals where over cooked and that made the chicken like rubber. My chicken still had feathers attached. Sick!!!!!,UNK
7227,Slow service.  One friend did not get his meal till we were finished eating ours. \n\nBurger was just ok. Not crazy about the bun.,UNK
7228,"Horrible! The check in took an hour! The place is run down and dirty. The elevators are filthy, we will NEVER go back there!",UNK
7229,"It was horrifically discusting and i'm never going back. The wings will make you vomit. Oh, and make sure you check your silverware!!",UNK
7230,"Good menu choices, friendly staff, clean restaurant, but the food is just okay at best.",UNK
7231,"Doesn't compare to Hawaii's famous shaved ice, but its pretty close to it. Very friendly and attentive. The guy working there guided me through the flavors and toppings and gave my daughter a free sample. Will definitely go back! Great place. Very clean and modern.",UNK
7232,The classic DIVE CASINO that I used to bring all my friends too.\n\nI am going to have to find another classic dive.\n\nI can't wait for it's reopening.,UNK
7233,"Worse experience ever! I walked in for just a trim on the sides wanting to keep a manly side part cut and walked out with half my hair gone. The stylist said he was the owner, will not be coming back.",UNK
7234,"I was looking for some good Mexican food and found someburros on yelp so my family went there for dinner. The food was good, but my fiancee and daughter end up getting possibly food positioning. They were up all night and the next day in the bathroom.",UNK
7235,Very disappointed with City Tavern. The place looks very warn and the food was awful and the prices were outrageous.,UNK
7236,Decent BBQ for AZ. Limited selection however for what I like and they dont have a sliced moist brisket. this place has some of the best Wings in the valley and for that alone i leave this review. Get them dry rubbed!,UNK
7237,"It's a bank, they charge fees and give you marginal service.",UNK
7238,"Pass on this place, go to Texas de Brazil - 1000x's better.",UNK
7239,"A nice place to stop in if you're out for a stroll in shadyside. Though I think this place is overpriced and a bit overrated, the staff is always nice and you can discover some pretty good finds. Obviously much better for women's clothes",UNK
7240,"It is OK.  I was disappointed to get my food on the cold side of the scale.  I would thought, considering the hype and prices, that this would be a detail to take care of.\n\nOther than that the ambiance is great and the drinks are good too.",UNK
7241,"Great food.  Very generous portions.  I vow to return often.  We ask for mild and it was perfect.  I might get more adventuresome next time, because I like a little heat.  Not so for my husband.",UNK
7242,"The Hibachi dinner and show is awesome, very fun for the kids. Plenty of food and drinks are good. Just make sure you don't arrive too late so you don't feel rushed out.",UNK
7243,"Definitely not quiet by any means but it is a great place to go if you are looking for something more upscale than the local tavern. The martinis, of course, are to die for and the servers are always a joy to be around!",UNK
7244,Good food and friendly staff. A little pricey for what you get.,UNK
7245,Skip this location and go the extra few miles to the Geno's on Williams Field near Val Vista. The Famous cheesesteak at this location is hardly worthy of the name. At the Williams Field location you'll get a proper cheesesteak... 1000% better than here.,UNK
7246,Pretty good food and good-sized meals,UNK
7247,Presented me with an expensive and invasive treatment plan.  Did not work well with my dog.  I contacted the company to express my concerns.  Awaiting their response.,UNK
7248,"Was not greeted at the door. I was charged $18 for  a simple cut 3 on top and 2 on the sides nothing else.. Should've gone to great clips which is in the same plaza, friendlier staff and better prices.",UNK
7249,$5 for a cup of the smallest size of chai tea latte that is a mixture of cold pre-made chai tea liquid and hot milk foam. Employees are not professional they don't even know the coffees on their menu.,UNK
7250,"Coffee roasted on site - Sunday afternoons. Good coffee, usually quiet atmosphere. very nice staff. sanwiches are a bit over priced, but taste good. Focus on the coffee and you will do well. Have gotten alot of work done here and have held many meetings outside.",UNK
7251,"Nothing that special here, service was okay. Ordered the American Kobe Beef Burger & sweet potato fries, was expecting a bit more!",UNK
7252,"First time here! I ordered the Bay Area French Toast, the fb had the traditional breakfast. Both of us were surprised at how much food there was on the plates and how fast they came out (we came at the prime time breakfast hour, on a Sunday no less).",UNK
7253,"Food was good and beer was way over priced you can go to yard house and get two beers for the price of one at lbs, service sucked the manger and bartender spent more time watching football then pouring beer. would never go there again",UNK
7254,Great place for an event!,UNK
7255,This business is closed.,UNK
7256,I really enjoy the atmosphere at this bar & grill. Definitely the place to go if you're in the Arcadia neighborhood.,UNK
7257,"Decent food at a relatively inexpensive price.  They don't take reservations, so be prepared to wait.  The cheesy bread is really good.  I wasn't impressed with the salad.  The pizzas are enormous!",UNK
7258,"To begin, the service was great.  However, the ravioli seemed frozen and the meatballs in the spaghetti and meatballs were flavorless.  A lackluster meal all around.",UNK
7259,"Over priced food! Service was great! Milk shake was amazing! Curly fries were luke warm like they had been sitting around for awhile. The burger was exactly as described, but not special at all. The I-80 was rather bland.",UNK
7260,It's 80 Degrees outside and beautiful today and they have an empty patio and won't let anyone sit out there. The manager said it's the owners decision. That's so lame!,UNK
7261,Very happy to have found this place! The food is great!,UNK
7262,"Don't bother showing up early. They tell you to come 15-20 mins before, but they make you stand there in line and wait while a steady stream of people pour in. What's the point???",UNK
7263,They open at 6am but today's paper is not available in the RJ machine.  So make an extra stop at the 7-Eleven to get your paper if you get there before 7am.,UNK
7264,Location Is NOT open for lunch as hours say on Yelp.. Monday to Friday they open at 4. Please fix your information.,UNK
7265,"Food was good but, not great. Location is very cool, in the town center. (think Big White columned building with southern looking square)\n\nNo lunch specials-you paid dinner prices.",UNK
7266,Update: Don't get the chicken pot pie... no flavor under that crust! Disappointed...,UNK
7267,The food was OK. Good customer service.,UNK
7268,"I love Starbucks, but this one has terrible parking and a small sitting room.  The parking lot has like 6 spots...and no street parking!",UNK
7269,"The service was not too great. The Waitress needs to smile more. We were a party of 9. The food was ok, prefer authentic, this taste like it was out of a can. Most likely won't be coming back to this restaurant.",UNK
7270,"From out of town, I was look for a good take out Pizza and I was not disappointed. Fresh mushrooms, good hand tossed crust, just the right amount of sauce. Well done. Good price also. Service was good. Definetly recommend.",UNK
7271,Great wedge salad... lousy steaks!,UNK
7272,"My favorite sushi in Madison.\n\nI like the atmosphere, and I like the staff.  They are nice, and the sushi isn't too expensive.  Plus you get to watch them make it on a plasma screen tv.",UNK
7273,Great prices that can't be beat! We paid $13 before tip which included 2 dinners and beer. Don't let the small size fool you either - there's plenty of seating in back and it's usually busy with locals who have discovered this hidden gem.,UNK
7274,I have been here twice for lunch and both times were great. Large portions and fast service. The service was good but not great. But that shouldn't stop you from having a good meal.,UNK
7275,"Came here with a group of 7, \nmade reservations earlier in the day,\nThe service was on point,\nFood arrived in a quick manor and was delicious!\nWould definitely come back!",UNK
7276,"I've ordered carry out and delivery from Lucky Kitchen about 5 times now... Awesome food, with great service. They deliver quickly, and the driver's always polite. When we go in to pick up our order, the staff is friendly and the place is very clean.",UNK
7277,Don't bother.  I've enjoyed Taco Bell more.,UNK
7278,"Terrible management. Inconsistent carding policies. Crabby servers. Too dark, extremely loud, and below average food. Don't waste your time.",UNK
7279,"\""Meh\""\n\n\n+1",UNK
7280,"Used to be a good place to eat but service is so slow and very loud bar people made our Sunday morning breakfast very unpleasant. Food is good for the area, nothing fancy.",UNK
7281,"Went here in Aug, very cheesy. What you expect from Hooters, enough said.",UNK
7282,"Chive dumplings were ok. Fried rice was bland and too greasy, beef stew was alright, and the chicken ginger noodle soup was very bland and chicken was too dry.",UNK
7283,"People are super friendly and the aroma of smoked meat makes your mouth water. They have a stage for live bands that play blues, jazz, and oldest.  We first order southern sweet tea and its made perfect! Not too sweet and not over brewed.",UNK
7284,Ibiza sounds great in concept but something just falls short here.  The wine selection is nice and some of the small dishes are solid but the service is lacking and the vibe is a bit average for what it is going for.,UNK
7285,Roaches in the bathroom.  Dirty and cluttered.  Saw that they were on dirty dining after we ate there.  YUCK!,UNK
7286,"Simply put - you're stuck at the airport - so they \""got ya\"". Crappy food, so-so drink and poor service. Good luck if this is your choice. Go get Burger King before you choose this.",UNK
7287,Great size portions...I always get the lettuce wraps. Been here prob about 5 times. Great brownies for $1.25! Love their monthly/seasonal sandwich selections.,UNK
7288,"The tacos and salsa are some of the best in town.  Overall I love Los Olivos, however the atmosphere at this location is only one step up from a Denny's.  I prefer takeout at this location!",UNK
7289,Toujours agr\u00e9able de se prendre un petit lunch \u00e0 cet endroit. Toujours bon toujours abordable.,UNK
7290,Very convenient and the staff is awesome. If you're a fan of hot dogs they are quite good and there are lots to choose from.,UNK
7291,"Had great coloring experiences and not so great haircuts. Tried to stick with them, but it was just one mediocre cut after another.\n\nGreat location, and ahem, atmosphere.",UNK
7292,"I had been a couple of times in the past, but today's visit was horrible.. I won't be returning.  Food wasn't that good.  Comparable to a mediocre buffet like Railroad Pass..",UNK
7293,"This is a nice little place that has some pretty good sandwich's. I got the vegetarian turkey sandwich they also have vegetarian cheese steak (unfortunately no vegan cheese) , but its nice to have some veg options.",UNK
7294,Was showing some friends Fremont Street and this was a must stop for the sexy greaters and deep friend Oreos and Twinkies! They blew some money in the slots and everyone left feeling good and buzzed.,UNK
7295,Nothing was good. Very disappointing. Didnt like anything I tried.,UNK
7296,As of this week they appear to be out of business.  I had a few of our cars washed there and they did okay.  Hopefully someone will take over the place.,UNK
7297,"The location and decor are downscale, but the food is delicious, inexpensive, and healthy.\n\nPlenty of vegan options.\n\nThere is no alcohol served, but the spiced tea was very good.",UNK
7298,"Went there for Bingo, it was okay - smoking and non-smoking were in the same room, really wasn't much of a non-smoking area.  The whole experience was just okay.",UNK
7299,"Good Job on the free sangria, place is going downhill fast....not even free stuff will get the public to come back.\n\nFix the health department issues first'\n\nFarewell firefly",UNK
7300,Over rated  :((((,UNK
7301,"Target is OK, nothing stood out to me on the shopping trip. Had a nice selection and well lit aisles.",UNK
7302,"Kind of like Scottsdale meets Jersey shore.  Solid Italian American menu that is deserving of neighborhood patronage, assuming that you can deal with the added decibels created by the patrons and the layout.",UNK
7303,"My husband I went there last night, with some out of town guests.  What a great time we had!  Drinks were very good priced and a live band, no cover charge, and what a Great time we had.  We will be going back here again, we loved it.",UNK
7304,"Decided to go out of the way and go to this particular location. Was greeted with a rude \""what do you want?\"" Every table was dirty. There was soda spilled on the floor and was already to the point that it was sticky. Overall worst Jimmy Johns experience.",UNK
7305,"Sassy Cow vanilla ice cream was the best ever - UNTIL they started adding ingredients other than cream, sugar and natural flavors.  Now it has gum, carageenan and other gunk that has totally spoiled the great taste.  \n\nI switching back to another brand.",UNK
7306,"Recommend, ordered delivery from here when I was working late and the food was great.  Had orange chicken, egg foo young, egg rolls, and white and brown rice.",UNK
7307,Garbage...I would rate food 3 but service brought it down to one....Garbage...go to suri ayce...rate Suri 3 but service brings in to 4,UNK
7308,I would only get the chicken wings. Everything else is ok. The know how to do some wings.,UNK
7309,"I like the galleria, especially the grand foyer that makes walking into the office like a presidential entrance. \n\nThe facilities are well kept, and everyone who works the center is really friendly.",UNK
7310,"I can't begin to tell you all the problems we had with this restaurant again won't be back, would not recommend this one. Mario Battali needs to actually visit his restaurants and train his staff on waiting tables and cooking steaks.",UNK
7311,"The boba drink was terrible, but the shaved ice was good.",UNK
7312,Melissa and Steve's wedding; what a great time with family and friends.,UNK
7313,We came here for NYE dinner and waited for half an hour. The line moved fast. It might be a tourist trap but it's a safe bet. \nRecommend it if you are out of options. Decent food,UNK
7314,We were about to buy some products an my 2 year old had to use the bathroom. One lady said ok and the other said no! So rude! Even though we live the place we wont be back due to the rude service!,UNK
7315,"45 minute wait for a take out order. Tried calling it in, but now I see why it didn't work. Even the manager is ignoring the phone.",UNK
7316,"Its really just a haircut joint, nothing special. I usually let Jasmine cut my hair.  She does a good job consistently. I had my hair cut for a new job & she did an excellent job, scissors up top & clippers on the side.",UNK
7317,They advertised they had espresso coffee. Waitress said machine was broken. I had the feeling  they did not want to make cappuccino. Either way i was very disappointed.,UNK
7318,Seriously this is the worst mcdonalds. The last time I went it took 20 minutes to get a spicy chicken and a fry. They have two windows and they ignored the window I was  at while taking orders of 3 other cars. Lame.,UNK
7319,"Market bistro is basically Sauce with better sandwiches and worse pizza. But I like the location and the shorter lines, if that really matters.",UNK
7320,Terrible service on Monday nights,UNK
7321,"Not nice at all, cheeesy. They had a.channel for sound so loud that you could barely hold a conversation. The place looks dated as well as the clientele.  On the plus side, great selection of bottled beer.",UNK
7322,"I love these cakes - great flavor, moist, sweet frosting, over all delicious.  Staff was very friendly and helpful.  However I only gave 4 stars because the store is closed on Sunday, the day I usually crave their cake!",UNK
7323,I know that this airport strives to be the friendliest.... Perhaps they need to share that philosophy with the people that work here. Thankfully they have Blue Moon.,UNK
7324,"We stopped here because their dinner special was reasonable. It was about $20 for some sushi, one drink, a salad, and miso. Overall it wasn't nearly as good as the sushi I've had in LA, but the salad was at least good and I left full",UNK
7325,Awful process. Had to wait for a cup of coffee after paying. Need to pour plain coffee when you pay like Starbucks does. We want Starbucks back!,UNK
7326,"Not good ,, too small... n its overrated! who waits 1hr for a glass of wine., i would rather get a bottle n drink at home.",UNK
7327,"Only thing going for this bar is the little person that comes out and feeds people shots.  Otherwise, typical bar that allows smoking.",UNK
7328,"Coffee was ok, a bit weak. The atmosphere is positive.",UNK
7329,"This place was ok until I went in the other day. The cook didn't wear gloves when grabbing my bacon from the fridge. When I complained n walked out he had the nerve to shrug his nasty shoulders and say \""oh well.\"" Stay away from this location.",UNK
7330,"The best eggplant ever.  Not too much Breading, delicious sauce. Try it in a sandwich or with pasta!  Manga Manga",UNK
7331,"Checked this place out for the first time.  With the exception of it being very hot inside (had all the doors open no A/C) it was a really for a social area.  We didn't have food, only drinks so I can't comment on the food.",UNK
7332,Excellent service. Thankyou Denise!\nFood was excellent...the two of us shared the C4 salad and a custom and pizza with a cappuccino and a latte.  Everything was very good and the portions big!,UNK

7336,"I hate to be the voice of dissent, but I miss Neapolitan. This reboot isn't nearly as good.",UNK

7340,Great breakfast today\nGreat service\nGreat food\nFun atmosphere\nSimple...this place is a winner!,UNK
7341,I went with my family to breakfast at this diner. I ordered a veggie omelette it was very good. Basic diner. Nice atmosphere. Love the fact they had flavored creamer for my coffee. Coffee was so so.,UNK
7342,Total rip off. Their food cost must be about 15%.. Large prices and small portions..,UNK
7343,Sushi and happy hour is really good. Don't bother eating there. Food is about 1.5 star.,UNK
7344,"I love the food here, but parking is hard to get.  The burgers have always been delicious and they take care of the outside tables (cleaning) better than other locations.  Try the wedge salad and fries.  Delicious.",UNK
7345,We always come in here for their buffet. Good food and costumer service.,UNK
7346,I got a margarita here that was excellent but the location isnt as good as the one at cesars palace. i did not get an extra shot but next time im getting  a hurricane.,UNK
7347,"Pros: Wide selection means you won't visit without finding something, live music some nights\n\nCons: While they have many discount CDs, the majority of them are worthless. Other CDs tend to be over-priced.",UNK
7348,Pizza is fantastic. Service is marginal. Kid friendly interactive tables upstairs rarely work properly. \n\nKitchen is ridiculously slow but if you've got time and patience for a forgetful staff the za is worth the wait.,UNK
7349,"Outrageously large portions, good enough to share with the whole family.  The baked beans are also FANTASTIC as a side as well as the slaw.  \n\nI'm not a huge fan of the BBQ sauces, but the meat is just right :)",UNK
7350,I keep trying them but each time their chicken is so dry!  They do have great customer service.....but I can't go for just that.,UNK
7351,Nice people work here & a welcome addition to the bland downtown lunch scene. Kinda expensive & cramped but that's ok,UNK

7353,"Love the location, love the people watching, but mostly I just adore the Modern Tiki Fish Sandwich. It is my favorite menu item.",UNK

7355,Update: came here for lunch with a group of 6. Ordered and still waiting for our food after an hour. Waitress was not polite at all.,UNK
7356,"wish they brought the sea food that was prepared in front of you back. rest of food is decent nothing to great. get what u pay for. chocolate fountain is a plus with the fruit, candy and cookies you can dunk in it. new quesadillas are pretty good",UNK

7358,It was really bad desision whe we decided as a family to go to the time share  presentation for these resorts! Unprofessional staff\n\nDr Hattar,UNK
7359,"Delivery is slow and not even close to the best Chinese in the area.  No matter if it's rice or noodles or chicken or pork, everything tastes off--like it's been overcooked in mop-bucket-water.  Try House of Lee instead.",UNK
7360,"Consistently terrible and SLOW service. Great happy hour specials both food and drink but I just can't justify how terrible the service is. With some decent management this could place be something special, for now my money goes elsewhere.",UNK
7361,"Had the prime rib, terrible the baked potato was great.  I'm not sure what animal the prime rib came from probably not cow.  I'd stick to zingers if I come back",UNK
7362,Love this place. The food is great!,UNK
7363,Manti wasn't bad! Worth going,UNK
7364,Love this place.The food is awesome. My boyfriend is Cantonese and he said the food is authentic.  We go there weekly. Only flaw is the service. Da waitresses don't know how to wait tables.,UNK
7365,"Delicious meal, great service, inviting atmosphere.\n\nWaited too long to write this, don't remember the menu item I had, but it was delicious.\n\nWould definitely return.",UNK
7366,Service was nice and friendly. Food was bland and tasteless. Seems like a place for a much older crowd.,UNK
7367,I personally love their products. But I had a bad experience with the sales lady.,UNK
7368,Scallops were perfect. My corn side dish was amazing and I'd eat the entire thing by myself if I could. My friends enjoyed their filets and chicken. Would I go back? Of course.,UNK
7369,"They cater towards people that workout and like to know what they're eating.  Yet, no nutrition information posted anywhere.  Get it together.",UNK
7370,Nice West-Island bar. Great patio with lots of TVs in the summer. Cheap beer. Food is decent but could be better. Good for sports events. Definitely better than bar hymus across the street.,UNK
7371,"Okay, the place does not have the best atmosphere or decor .... but the food is pretty tasty and the prizes are reasonable. Good place to go for a casual, quick bite to eat.",UNK
7372,Second worse airline after American Airlines.,UNK
7373,Don't get fooled about the special.. It only applies during the week days and non holidays...came here on July 4 holiday and charges almost doubled the advertised rate...call total reward number and they were useless...NEVER CALL AGAIN!!!,UNK
7374,"After waiting at the bar for ten minutes without even an acknowledgement from the bartender who was arguing with a waitress over her personal order, I walked out.  As I did, the hostess just smiled.  And it was only me and another person at the bar.  Will not go back to this location.",UNK
7375,"One of my favorites - great selection (a bit pricey), food's very good, especially considering that they've whipped up vegetarian things off menu for me, and beautiful bartenders. The atmosphere ranges from dinner on the weekdays to happy hour in the evenings to bar weekend nights.",UNK
7376,Fun Place,UNK
7377,A promoting agency that does not work well with you for clubs and attractions in vegas. Experience started off okay though they like to text you a lot and then the deal falls through. If there's even a deal they give you. Grade very poor!!!,UNK
7378,"Nice place, and nice sweet pastries, coffee, tea and scones.\n\nMore trendy/updated than classic.\n\nBeen here twice, but i rather prefer Peters Yard",UNK
7379,"The pizza was not bad.  I've definitly had better.  The crust is just very heavy.  I'm sure I will have it again, just no go out of my way for it.",UNK
7380,Just like macaroni grill.  Not a fan of oily over-cooked pasta.  The salads are overdressed and super salty.  The serivce was terrific even though it was Mother's Day.,UNK
7381,The coffee was great but the downfall was the limited pastries and things to eat. I've haven't seen it this low at any Starbucks location so I was pretty turned off.,UNK
7382,Always have good experiences here!,UNK
7383,"Good food, open late is great.",UNK
7384,I only went to a conference here so I can't speak about the rooms or service. But it is a beautiful building. Outstanding design. The conference facilities were great and I have no complaints there.,UNK
7385,highly marginal\nmost of the food was cold and flavorless. the cornbread was like eating sawdust\n\nhowever the sauce was pretty good,UNK
7386,"Where it all began.\nAnd, when the end of the world comes, where it all will end.\nSome things seen here cannot be unseen.\nIf you must come, do so very, very early, unless you enjoy standing in a parking garage for hours.",UNK
7387,Good food here consistently.,UNK
7388,Yes. I will give you a call after this weekend. I can assure you that was the only food we has in common in a while. We were 5 in the table. Only me and her had the same food. The rest thanksfully didnt get sick,UNK
7389,You are not allowed to use the wireless. Thats pretty sad.  But they do have diet coke,UNK
7390,Service was good but the potatoes and biscuits were frozen. Fresh homemade biscuits and some hand cut potatoes would be nice.,UNK
7391,"Great food, but awful service.",UNK
7392,Delicious chicken and even better waffles. The sweet tea is great but sometimes it can be too sweet. Give this place a try!,UNK
7393,"GONE!\n\nNo longer in this cute House - In its place, a new Business: Savannah's : Dining, Bakery & Catering.",UNK
7394,Ok. Relatively cheap for sandwich.  My sandwich was filing but tasteless.  Not sure what they use for oil and vinegar but it had no taste.  Even the meat was bland.  Weird.,UNK
7395,"I have to agree with Alice, everything does look a little skinny in this shop. The parrots looks anorexic, have a little look for yourself. But then again, when did you ever seen a happy caged animal?",UNK
7396,The new location is awesome and I love how they place the DJs they have upstairs overlooking the front of the store. The staff is always friendly and inviting and most of the clothes are great. I always make time to stop here when I am Biltmore.,UNK
7397,"They have one of the best fried chicken sandwiches I have ever had.  I was blocked in traffic due to the president taking off at the airport, so when I ordered my food to pick up, they literally brought it out to my car for me.  They are the nicest people.",UNK
7398,Nasty!!! No variety food tastes like it came off a can ugh!,UNK
7399,"got my lashes done Thursday night and half of them have already fallen out, not too impressed with the work done here :( what a disappointment",UNK
7400,Wisconsin in the final 4!,UNK
7401,The bacon was overdone and the guests were immature. I really liked this bar but I'm a single girl so no security to walk you out just in case. :(,UNK
7402,"Long line in drive-thru.  Obnoxiously perky employees.  Skunky, overpriced coffee.  Avoid!",UNK
7403,Just an anerage Asain Buffet,UNK
7404,"I said it once and I'll say it a million times more. HM has one of the worst costumer service out there, but I guess it matches the low quality of product.  I only shop here on emergencies.",UNK
7405,ugh...this buffet made me sick.  I was eating my life away just fine.  And then I decided to have the crab legs.  Big mistake.  I walked back to my hotel feeling nauseated.  I spent the rest of my 21st birthday in the bathroom.  Enough said.,UNK
7406,Mall is okay. Semi ghetto. But it is close & they have reasonable stores.,UNK
7407,Unpleasant experience: Waiting line 1.5 hours with half of staff going on break and not treated friendly.,UNK
7408,"The baristas don't let you have anything how you want it. \""They know better\"".\nDisappointed.",UNK
7409,"Loud, overpriced, and annoying. I wouldn't wish an afternoon there on my worst enemy.",UNK
7410,"Not terrible. I only go there because I live nearby. Staff members are friendly and helpful, but peak times are cramped. Also, they've been removing their normal exercise bikes and replacing them with these truly awful video game systems.",UNK
7411,it was a very nice place to lounge and the workers were very nice but I ate the chilled eggplant and within hours I got food poisoning. I definitely would not come back.,UNK
7412,Soup watery. Food mediocre. Salad was pure vinegar.,UNK
7413,we love this place Missy often asked to go right there as soon as she lands LOL she a picky eater and can find stuff she loves there....Great food!,UNK
7414,Stopped in here while shopping because there was no place else to go. I did not have high expectations and my expectations were met. The food was marginal although the service was good. The burger just wasn't very good.,UNK
7415,"this was such a nice place to go, First date idea or anniversary haha... the food is so good, the atmosphere is exquisite, the drinks and the service so good. is a must go here in Phoenix.",UNK
7416,"leasing guy at the front was dead, worst customer service/greeter ever. on his phone the whole time! floor plan shown to us fell below our expectations. other than that, its a good location and clean place.",UNK
7417,"The margaritas are fantastic, the service was great and the appetizers were pretty good.",UNK
7418,"Good food and great service. Stopped in for lunch and was pleasantly surprised. Will definitely be back. They have a limited menu but everything on it looked good, I would definitely recommend them.",UNK
7419,Cool bar.  Kinda reminds me of this bar in the burbs of Cleveland called Johns Cafe I used to patron everyday!   And I love the indoor fire pits!,UNK
7420,"I'm going to update my review on one point:  it's not a dive bar.  This time we sat in the back and it was perfectly fine.  But yes, it's a bar.  But the food was still delicious, and I can't wait to go back!",UNK
7421,"Food - I will give 4 stars. Wait time is horrible for both online ordering and at the restaurant, thus they get 1 star from me. This has happened to me twice. The last time I just left and went to Muramoto.",UNK
7422,This place is a dump\nOverpriced drinks and lousy atmosphere.\nReminds me of a garage\nThis place will be out Of business in no time.\nDon't waste the gas money,UNK
7423,"Stopped by to exchange some items we received as a gift. The woman who attempted to help us was incredibly rude, unfriendly, and unprofessional and was completely not helpful. Thanks for nothing, Lana! Unbelievable!",UNK
7424,"Terrible!  Turkey sandwich with hardly any turkey. Nice place but what a rip off!  Even the free yogurt was lousy. Ok, the chips were OK. First time and the last too.",UNK
7425,"Got in the express lane to get a defunct battery replaced, the next thing the truck is getting tested for alignments.  2hours  then an estimate for over $570 for a starter replacement, no thank you!",UNK
7426,"Went there 2011-04-17; THE PLACE IS CLOSED.  sign on door says \""closed for renovations\"", but there there was no renovation visible and the \""noodle palace\"" sign over the door has been removed.",UNK
7427,Pretty good brunch. Quite pricey for dinner. The peach mimosa was awesome.,UNK
7428,"We had dinner there last night with some new friends from Canada.  Food was much better than what's served in the one in New Castle, DE.  Bonus, happy hour prices all day Sunday!  Service was so so.",UNK
7429,Airport has ample restaurant options and of course plenty of slot machines to keep you entertained while you wait for your flight.,UNK
7430,Pizzeria Butana\n\nWhere they treat their customers like dogs!,UNK
7431,Really liked it alot.  Lots of interesting things on the menu.  Steak chilaquiles.,UNK
7432,Only place we could get special flour in mid-summer,UNK
7433,Nachos at 3a. This place served it's purpose. \n\nFor some reason the water was awwweeeesooooomme too.\n\nJust saying. \n\nxxx C,UNK
7434,"I expected more because of the way people amp this place up but the dogs aren't that good to me. They're ok. Homemade chili cheese dogs taste better. Just my opinion though, you may think otherwise.",UNK
7435,"Stuffed bacon cheeseburger with pretzel bun was great!! The atmosphere was good but it was a little warmer than what I feel is comfortable. Service was average. Overall, a good experience, will likely go back at some point.",UNK
7436,Do not use this company as the owner does not stand behind his word!,UNK
7437,They did not do well. They totally screwed my order up and then just seemed indifferent to it. \nI should have known better.,UNK
7438,Huge place big selection lots of gaming space....customer serviced needs work.,UNK
7439,"Seems like a good crowd.  Very chill.  Cool signs, but the atmosphere is lacking.",UNK
7440,"Dropped by tonight for an Americano....not good!  I had high expectations, but this was the worst Americano I've ever tried.  Don't waste your time on this place.  I would rather spend the time driving over to Lux for some quality espresso.",UNK
7441,Pot roast and biscuit were solid.  Collards and fried green tomatoes were disappointing.   Overall nice meal with southern diner type atmosphere.  Next time I will try the chicken and dumplings.,UNK
7442,great slice of pizza!,UNK
7443,I went to Asie Moderne to try one particular dish.\n\nI ordered their sour soup with tripe and beef.\n \nI was very happy! I grew up eating Cambodian dishes and the soup taste just like my mom used to make it.,UNK
7444,"One of the wrost places to stay at, avoid as far as possible.",UNK
7445,The restaurant smells off when you walk in and my chicken teriyaki felt squishy.,UNK
7446,There are too many ice crystals in Mojo Yogurt.  I threw half of mine away.  I prefer creamier fro yo.,UNK
7447,"The food was pretty good, nothing overly exciting.  I was impressed by the wine selection.  I would give this place a higher rating if their service was better.  It has been lackluster at best.",UNK
7448,Grand VIEW - that just about sums it up. The only other thing worth mentioning is the price.,UNK
7449,"Food might have been good, however they were out of rice, Guacamole, and oh ya, CARNE ASADA.",UNK
7450,"Excellent gourmet hot dogs.  I had the Angry Dog, which has spicy pork bulgogi, Asian slaw, diced jalape\u00f1os and fiery mayo on it.",UNK
7451,The buffet food tastes like cardboard. Our server and the fresh pasta chef were very nice. Vince Neil bar service is slow and the bartender forgot to bring us our drinks. Not worth it.,UNK
7452,Yellowtail carpaccio is amazing. Waygu beef is done quite rare so it's a bit too chewy.,UNK
7453,"Seems like one of the only spots to grab breakfast downtown aside from a chain. Good egg/meat platters (home fries were bomb!!) and awesome pancakes. No frills, no complaints, good value.",UNK
7454,I live nearby and this place is an easy quick takeout. Last two times here I ordered BEEF enchiladas only to find nothing but cheese.  caught them the last time and ended up with the cheese ones for free.  just make sure you're getting what you order,UNK
7455,"Service was good, everyone was friendly and the sushi is good and the prices are great! The happy hour is a good deal. The outside area needs tending, clean Windows, sweep up cigarettes and wipe down tables and chairs. I would still come back...",UNK
7456,Nothing special burger-wise but the very pleasant older gentleman working the dining room made my 21 year old daughter's day by stopping at our table to chat & giving her a paper In N Out hat. The chocolate & vanilla milkshakes were delicious though!,UNK
7457,"First time here, loved the Pimento Cheese Fritters, burgers were great.  Great service and just a fun place!",UNK
7458,"They have every kind of dried food you can think of! Fish, nuts, fruit - all kinds and they have bulk candy! There was line when I went there on Saturday morning, so be prepared.",UNK
7459,I was torn between a 3 and 4. This place is cool. There is a tree growing in the middle of the dining room. The food is good not to inspired but good. The service is very good. Actually the more I think about it the more I want to go back.,UNK
7460,"Ok, I have been here personally...  If you're meeting someone for drinks it's okay.  Almost always crowded with pretentious people, the dance floor is tiny, the food is average and everything is expensive...",UNK
7461,"The scallops, steak, nutella brownies, dirty martinis and duck l'lorange was superb. Dim lighting, casual attire.",UNK
7462,"Disappointed. The dip is cheese whiz?! Really? Only regular salted pretzels that were cold and hard. Not what we were really hopping for. I had hopped for specialty, maybe a pizza pretzel! The filled kind. Wont be returning",UNK
7463,"HORRIBLE! The servers weren't interested, the food was just ok and the place was trashed. It was disgusting actually. We will never go there again.",UNK
7464,really good! I love the turkey cranberry sandwich! it was awesome! the cookies are to die for! only downfall is there are alil to pricey for a sandwich!,UNK
7465,"Be warned, this is the second time I've had thai me up and its just okay. The food is not spicy at all and I ordered an 8. In addition, the food is overly priced. With so many places to eat nearby, spend your money elsewhere.",UNK
7466,"I was not impressed. By anything. I will say that now I am more determined to make ceviche at home, which I'm sure will be better.",UNK
7467,"We had to wait 30 min before the food came out, and the waitress was a stoic bitch. The food was just mediocre and over priced.",UNK
7468,After a long day of driving I was so hoping the 4 star reviews would not steer me wrong.  From rice and beans to burrito or tacos the food was bland or over spiced that you could not tolerate the taste. Skip if you have a choice.,UNK
7469,Rude Owners and dirty unsanitary.. Would not return,UNK
7470,Great food ... But there were 3 issues\n1. You can not creat your own omelet \n2. Slow services \n3. Little bit pricy,UNK
7471,"Saving grace was the crepes. Meat was tough,  rubbery and somewhat flavorless, cake was dry.\n\nCrepes were awesome though. They saved the rating.",UNK
7472,"Way overpriced for what you get.  Check in on Yelp and you get a free bud light, other than that I'd avoid this place.",UNK
7473,"Big fan of the Church.  Their non traditional pierogies are almost always a great choice, paired with the pizza and their beer brewed on site, this is a must stop when in the Bloomfield area of Pittsburgh.",UNK
7474,Denny's is Denny's but sometimes the service ruins the experience. Shortage of help in this location makes the meal a bummer. Hard to get coffee refills and even had to work at getting a check to pay the bill. I will avoid this one in the future,UNK
7475,I liked it. Came with my kids. All that i expected from a place like this. Good food.,UNK
7476,"got 2 free   dinner buffet from playing on myvegas.com . expected better food . most things I tried , didn't taste good . the only good thing was the made to order pasta station. dinner was 34.99 $  mon- thur",UNK
7477,a good place to go with friend when you are very hungry!,UNK
7478,"I love their Dilworth but the drive was too long for me. I am glad they open this new location. Their chicken and spicy sauce are great, ah and don't forget the empanadas!",UNK
7479,"My steak was great, but my wife's pasta came out underdone and the waitress felt like having a 20 minute conversation with another table instead of fixing the problem. When we asked that this be corrected the bread came out cold and the drinks were never refilled.",UNK
7480,"The bartenders were friendly and talented in juggling cups while making drinks. My favorite drink was Tranquil Waters, which consisted of Cruzan mango rum, blue curacao, pineapple juice, and mango!",UNK
7481,This place is a gimmick and a joke. The food quality is similar to Burger King. The fondue was an embarrassment. Save your money and go to Dairy Queen. Service was terrible. I was told the Sugar Factory near the Paris was better.,UNK
7482,"The service is good and the salsa is tasty, but the food is just average.  It's also pretty noisy indoors, if you're looking to have a conversation.",UNK
7483,Fun eclectic menu.  Friendly staff. Good food and the roasted Pig is awesome. \nGood selection of fresh oysters. Patio dining with fire pit is a great feature.  Look forward to attending wine events to sample their wines,UNK
7484,So I ordered a chicken plate and 10 mins later they came out and told me they were out of chicken ... at 5 pm ???? they owner never came over or the Manager to say anything.... I thought it was Rude!,UNK
7485,All you can eat $25. How could you go wrong? The sushi is very good. And the hot food as well.,UNK
7486,The tofu soup tastes like it's been flavored by instant noodle soup powder. The vegetable tofu soup had no veggies at all. Very friendly service though!,UNK
7487,Horrible service they will come to your house start job and never come back to . They do Kohler repairs and Kohler should lose their number!,UNK
7488,"The fuel reward network doesn't work at this store. Store has been notified several times to correct the system. They refuse to fix the problem. Reported problem to the fuel rewards network, hoping they can correct this shady problem.",UNK
7489,"I've never been a big fan of L&L, especially since I've had better, but I gotta say the mochiko chicken here is pretty good. That's all I order there. Another plus, their \""mini\"" plates are pretty big.",UNK
7490,Just OK. Food was anything to rave about. I've been to other Tacones and the food has always been really good. Very disappointed. I do think this location focuses more on the alcoholic beverages than the food.,UNK
7491,"Soooo good! Love the Thousand Beans, its definitely one of my absolute favs. \nGlad this location opened! Service is always great.",UNK
7492,I really enjoyed this place.  Great variety of memorabilia.  Have some fun and try the trays of soda from around the world.  You will find some great tasting drinks....... And some not so great tasting drinks.,UNK
7493,"Wow this place is gross. Outdated. Dirty. Reminds me of a bad dream. I was on the 10th floor and could still hear the music. I don't know where I will be staying tonight, but it won't be at the 4 queens.",UNK
7494,I love that this place gives you a pass to eat all day. It was a decent good food buffet but it definitely is not your fancy 5 star dining experience.,UNK
7495,Been sitting here for over 45 minutes now. All I wanted to do is add a beneficiary to my accounts. Watching the employee work was worse than watching paint dry. Another reminder of why I should have taken my business to another bank!,UNK
7496,Nice place to visit in spring time frame.  The prices are affordable and the views are breathtaking.,UNK
7497,very helpful staff and one of the best lookin lowes i have ever seen,UNK
7498,"I ordered the southern fried chicken sandwich from drive-thru, it came without ANY condiments on it.  Just a plain piece of chicken on a bun?  Come on guys, get it right",UNK
7499,"Been to AZ hundreds of times, how did I miss this place!? What a find - I second & third all the excellent breakfast reviews, awesome food and great friendly atmosphere. Not a bad value either considering its AZ, will definitely come here again next trip!",UNK
7500,"Meh, not the \""best\"" by far concerning the pizza. Like the fresh tomatoes but lacking in flavor from the other toppings. Maybe it's cause the crust is too heavy. There are better options especially in scottsdale.",UNK
7501,Service was slow to non-existent.,UNK
7502,"I was not a big fan of sushi, but after tasting here I started loving sushi. It is little bit costly but the food is good.",UNK
7503,"I was here last night for the Mosaik ballet.  Gotta love this old, nicely restored theatre.  It's a classic and I enjoy attending performances here every time.",UNK
7504,"Great sales/finance staff! Smooth, easy car buying process. Horrible service department! Communication along with their customer service is terrible. Will not buy from again because of service department.",UNK
7505,I love this place because it's totally vegan friendly and she'll totally accommodate your needs .. The hostess is so charismatic and the place is in pretty good shape .. Small and quaint .. Clean and yummy .. Great prices and good service :),UNK
7506,My girlfriend and I enjoyed a great meal when we went here. I ordered the 22oz steak and my girlfriend had the lamp. The food was cooked perfectly but expect to dish out alot of cash for your meal.,UNK
7507,For airport food you can't go wrong with chili's! Limited menu but good selections. Good place to pass the time while waiting at the airport which lets face it is always a drag. Mushroom swiss burger was juicy and fresh.,UNK
7508,Ok crowd. Good place to see concerts. But stupid expensive drinks and the bartenders do not give very good service. I've downgraded this place to only a concert stop. And only then if there is nothing else going on.,UNK
7509,"Great place to hang out before a concert. Very good Margarita and at $4 during happy hour, just can't beat that!",UNK
7510,This hotel was horrible. The staff was too nice the food was too good and the room was clean and spacious. If i had a fridge or microwave I would have said 5 star. If you like that sort of thing stay here as for me I'm not staying here again til the next time,UNK
7511,Some good Chicago eats on the west side of Phoenix.  Loved the pizza puff and the hot dog and Italian beef were decent. Fries were ok.  Love the logos painted outside in the parking lot-they even have the Chicago rush represented-nice!,UNK
7512,was a little hesitant with the low ratings i saw but i liked it.  the decor was great!  surprised with the pond and geese with the authentic mexican blankets and tile.  i ordered the meatball soup and liked them both.  the price was reasonable.  would go back.,UNK
7513,This place. I've tried to give them so many chances. Such a convenient location. But their drive thru takes at least 15 minutes each time. Very inconvenient.,UNK
7514,bumped up a star because they fixed their mistake and gave me a credit.,UNK
7515,"Probably one of the worst places in las Vegas. Poor service, crappy drinks and food that tastes like it was made day before yesterday. And best part of all....u get to pay before u get your food!!!",UNK
7516,"Another east-side dive bar... not great, but not bad either.",UNK
7517,"Everyone was right, but for different reasons.  Most of our food was cold and our beer warm. Guess at half price, you get what you pay for.  Even bathrooms rivaled Circle K - gross.",UNK
7518,"Average food. Noisy inside. Not a lot of parking, actually horrible parking. I got caught in the drive thru trying to leave. It's like healthier fast food. I had the breakfast burro and my wife had the Cali club. Both were average to me.",UNK
7519,This store was closed before the posted hours the last two times I went. We went to pickup a Redbox DVD and wasted the trip even though we got there 50 minutes before closing time.,UNK
7520,"I agree, this place doesn't have anything special to offer and seating is crammed. Service wasn't too bad but their is room for improvement.",UNK
7521,"Can I give 0 stars? That's what this place deserves. Poor sanitation practices, the owner was ease dropping on my conversation with friends and just started laughing randomly and put herself in our conversation. Go next door to D's for better food and service! Food is way overpriced!",UNK
7522,"Service was decent. The food and the were way below par. I would not ever return to this sushi restaurant. Rolls fell apart, soy paper was pink? There edamame was edible. Literally this is the worst sushi I have ever had.",UNK
7523,The Charlotte Museum of History is an important part of the Charlotte community. It is dedicated to preservation of the Revolutionary War era of Mecklenburg County. The jewel of the museum is the Rock House - oldest house in the county.  I have visited many times and really feel the staff does a great job. Go visit!,UNK
7524,The staff is great but the beds...not so much.  The place could use an overhaul.,UNK
7525,"Lovely modern decor.  Service really good and helpful. Food - delicious. SEVICHE , fabulous.  Portions small for the price.",UNK
7526,"This place has a great happy hour.  The Scottsdale people-watching is top-notch, too.  Highly recommended place for good sushi in Old Town.\n\nI always sit outside on the patio...",UNK
7527,Just waited twenty minutes with three bartenders for no service...sorry I got a guy with me! Never Again I understand the low rating,UNK
7528,All workers are confused and we got passed around since they don't know which bus we should be on.  If you want a stressful start to your Vegas experience. Pick them,UNK
7529,No brown rice. Almost no vegetarian options.,UNK
7530,"Same experience again today. I did a careful check of the interior before driving away and noticed a few areas they missed. Not just 'left a few spots,' but completely missed with the towel. I hate that they just don't get it right from the start.",UNK
7531,"This Albertsons is alright. There's always a cashier with jet black hair who literally looks like she's dying a little more with every customer she sees, but besides that it's a fine grocery store.",UNK
7532,"Great place for Pho in the SW Valley!  I go there for lunch the Pho has a great taste, beef is tender and rice noodles very good, plus the broth is yummy.  Only problem it's close on Tuesday.",UNK
7533,"Wow, definitely the worst \""Thai\"" food I've ever tried to choke down. Completely flavorless, mushy and definitely not worth the $8.95.  You'd be better off gnawing on your sweaty sock....",UNK
7534,"I was VERY disappointed with the portion size. Previously, I would get 4 times the size of the sandwich now. If the sandwich is going to shrink in size, the price should as well. $8 for a bite size sandwich, a little ridiculous!",UNK
7535,"Steak, seafood, appetizers tasted amazing. Really good wine selection and excellent service.",UNK
7536,"I would rather go to Rome and see the real thing, just a copy of Saint Peters Basilica...",UNK
7537,Excellent beef with Broccoli!  Will be back,UNK
7538,Can't beat $2 for a any size latte on Wednesdays.  Small latte?  $2 please.  Medium latte?  $2 please!  Large latte?  $2 please!  You get the idea.  Hint:  I'd go with the large...,UNK
7539,"Sad to report that there is no longer a poker room at this casino...\nEven if the rooms are updated, there is no \""draw\"" for me to venture to this side of Fremont Street.",UNK
7540,Place is a hole in the wall. They have a good Pad Se Eew. Fried rice isn't so good. They good lunch deals.,UNK
7541,Cox Communications \nHORRIBLE customer service and OUTRAGEOUS prices.....I am so so upset over the way they treat customers. They act like they own you and as if they are doing you the favor...what happened to quality customer service?,UNK
7542,I have been back for brunch and it is pretty fab. My kid loves the bacon and I devour the chicken chiliques (sp?),UNK
7543,"Added a star for effort, since the manager messaged me about the experience and seemed legitimately concerned. They'll have a chance to make up for the last visit when football season rolls around again, but not before.",UNK
7544,"I love the convenience of panda express and although we have not been happy at other panda expresses, everything we got here was delicious!",UNK
7545,"They delivered the wrong couch,  called twice and went in person twice and the issue is still not resolved. Very disappointed! When I went in person I saw people standing around and not answering calls. Ridiculous!",UNK
7546,Real cool place.. And a shout out to the waitress who did not kick me out for breaking like 10 glasses! it was a accident i swear.,UNK
7547,"Very tasty rolls, sushi chefs very friendly and loved the 90's R&B music as well haha. I will be back for teppan",UNK
7548,"Cool concept, slight miss on execution. Half the booths are closed on Sunday. No designated parking just for the market, we got turned away across the street by the church organization. Parking garage closest to it charges $2 per 20 minutes.",UNK
7549,I sat at the outdoor bar under a straw rooftop and the March breeze cooled down the Phoenix 90-degree March heat and I truly felt like I was in Hawaii. The margaritas were S-T-R-O-N-G and the crowd was lively and fun!,UNK
7550,"It's not great... but it's not awful. A little overpriced for mediocre food. Love the spinach enchiladas. If you're in the area and there's nowhere else close by you want to travel for Mexican, it will do.",UNK
7551,Huge flavorless portions. Salsa is tomato pur\u00e9e basically. My can of diet coke was fantastic!,UNK
7552,This place has average food at best and everything is over priced. I would rather spend a little more and walk down the way to yardhouse.,UNK
7553,"I ate the Asparagus Salad, Parmesan Panna Cotta, Prosciutto dish. Was it AMAZING!!!! It was light and perfect for a late dinner. I would go here again, definitely.",UNK
7554,"the specials are great, the bar tenders are fun and the pool  party is fun/  On another visit on a Saturday Kim was colorful Fun and mature. Go Cowboys!",UNK
7555,"good burgers, good beers",UNK
7556,"One word- Chicken'nDumplings! (or is that two words?)  Love it!  Not everything on the menu is perfect, but everyone comes here for their favorite thing, my boyfriend loved the pork chops, and rarely stray from their usual order.  A true southern diner.",UNK
7557,"Service is slow when there's few people and being near the bus stop, they need to step it up for those in a hurry!",UNK
7558,"Horrible service, they keep delaying the delivery of our order, they say they arrived and called with no answer to buy more time, when called to complain got hang up on, DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE \nPS: I'm not an ex-employee",UNK
7559,The stir fry is edible. That's about all I can say. It is as authentically Asian as pei Wei.  Maybe less so.,UNK
7560,"meh, should've saved myself for the dessert. everything else was lackluster in comparison.",UNK
7561,*  Very dirty dinning area!!\n*  Employees obviously do not care about customer service \n*  McDonalds should pull their affiliation - very bad representation of the brand,UNK
7562,"Typical food for cracker barrel,. Service is usually pretty good, however today was poor. Several employees standing around talking loudly, all while we waited for 5 min. to be seated in a near empty restaurant. Almost walked out!",UNK
7563,"Got a bag of many different pastries.  Every single one of them was stale, barely edible.  Super disappointing since a few years ago this place was a solid 4.",UNK
7564,French OnionSoup was killer & we will come back. Enjoyed the rest of the meal & thought it was fairly priced.,UNK
7565,Veggie sandwich is delicious. Love the sweet potato fries.  I cannot complain about a sports bar that carries La Crema Pinot Noir just for me!,UNK
7566,"Terrible experience. I'm not typically picky about my customer service, but the service at this location was the pits.",UNK
7567,"Just left had my  money returned. Awful tasteless. cat fish , greens and peas. Dissapointed no soul in that food. Greasy fried way to hard. Service was indifferent and order was incorrect. Left as I arrived ,hungry.",UNK
7568,Great bartender and attentive service..... but really?! Really?! No champagne on a Sunday?! What about mimosas?,UNK
7569,Not bad for a Mexican fast food place in Nevada !!  and like the others have said this place is really clean....,UNK
7570,"Still 1 star. Service was terrible. You can email as many buy 1 get one free to your customers, but if the service is terrible and I have to track the manager down to get a check and cash me out. Bad news.",UNK
7571,"I enjoy Netflix, but I am really bad at getting my mail and sending my mail. I do everything electronically. I really wish there was more of a selection within the Instant Queue.",UNK
7572,"This is everything wrong about the postal service...uninspired staff, inefficient prodedures...would have been better served by trained monkeys.",UNK
7573,They're ok a little bit pricey and sometimes they seem undercooked but the green corn is excellent.,UNK
7574,Chili cheese dog ranking is a 7 out of 10.  Monica at the counter who helped serve us outside was so nice and kind.  She truly appreciated our business.,UNK
7575,Excellent sandwiches.  Avocado on toasted sourdough was the best.  Must have had two whole avocados on the sandwich!,UNK
7576,something are priced high others not. good if you want a funky addiction to your wardrobe,UNK
7577,"Super friendly staff.\n\nBasic, decent food.\n\nRun down, western, rustic decor.",UNK
7578,Garlic fries are a must and a place that serves arrogant bastard on tap has to be pretty good.  Wife and I ordered the cowboy and mushroom burger.  Holy cow!  Awesome and good riddance of the old place yeah it was cheaper but you skimped on taste and quality,UNK
7579,"Like chipotle with pizza, it was quick good service and overall pizza was pretty solid. will definitely return!",UNK
7580,The ribs were burnt to a crisp and the brisket was so dry.  I can't believe this place has 4 1/2 stars. Wtf,UNK
7581,"Quite possibly the worst Giant Eagle in existence. Super small, carries no vegetarian items, except sad fruits and vegetables that have collected dust for weeks. People seem to come here for lottery tickets and Diet Coke. Those they have.",UNK
7582,"Now that I have a better look at my eye brows, she went a little crazy on the right brow verses the left. I'm just going to stick to my spot in Tempe....",UNK
7583,Hot links were very average. Terrible texture.,UNK
7584,Slow service. Mediocre food.,UNK
7585,This has to be a new one. \nLooks very nice and clean. \nPeople where helpful and nice. \nHas to be The best one I have ever been to.,UNK
7586,"5 stars for the large sampler , fresh , tasty and big portion!\n\n2-star goes for my Surf&Turf  due to the unchewable lobster..very disappointed since it should not have happened in such a noted restaurant",UNK
7587,Well worth the price. . 9.50 for lunch. . Clean & comfortable.  Occasionally you can get a 20% off coupon in the mail.,UNK
7588,"Food was good. However the service could be better. Our server was pushy, and made us bus our own table before bringing out our entrees. Seriously aren't you suppose clear the table yourself?",UNK
7589,"When paying $45 for a 10oz. prime rib, I do not expect to be served out of a cart wheeled  to my table. I expect the food to be brought from the kitchen. That really cheapened the experience, IMO.",UNK
7590,It's burger king! If you don't know about it....try it. Their Burgers are good but their milkshakes are better! Try a milkshake! Then go play slot machines!,UNK
7591,"The best Fine Whiskey list in all of the madison area, gotta specifically ask for the list tho, off the chain!",UNK
7592,Took two and a half hours for Mani pedi. I sat for long periods of time in between with no one working on me while they accommodated other walk-ins. My GEL!! Manicure chipped off 5 fingers by day 3.,UNK
7593,Food was ok once we got it. Waited over 30 minutes for a burger at a burger place. Got there before the lunch rush and ordered right away. People seated after us were almost done eating when we got our food. Won't go back.,UNK
7594,"It's Monday at 9am and they are not open for breakfast like their sign says. \""Daily 6-10am\""",UNK
7595,"pretty good place to buy or sell used books, CDs, movies, etc.\ni haven't really been since the advent of downloading, but i always favored Eastside over this place for atmosphere, authenticity of \""record\"" shop and staff.",UNK
7596,"The car wash is good but man I tell you everytime I've been to this place the high pressure up selling is totally annoying.  You mean I can't even get a car wash without up selling pressure?  Man, I no longer go there.  Danny's is less pressure.",UNK
7597,This is a great place to eat! The people there are so nice and the food is fantastic. They have some of the best cornbread I've had and the catfish and chicken are fried to golden perfection but deliciously moist.,UNK
7598,Food was ok. I had the steak kabob plate. The salad and rice was good. The steak was tough.,UNK
7599,Frequent this cafe regularly as i receive comps from the casino. The food is overall pretty good for the price but the service seems to be increasingly worse. A simple dinner generally takes 90 minutes due to the poor/slow service. Poor management can only be to blame.,UNK
7600,enjoyed a lunch special.   Just not awesome enough.,UNK
7601,"Last reviewed 3 1/2 years ago and website gone, I believe they are gone!",UNK
7602,I always receive great service here.  No complaints at all.,UNK

7604,last sunday we were going to give it a try and the smell of a dirty rug had us turn at the door !!!,UNK
7605,"Awesome lunch special, delicious and they give you more food. I like the chicken panang, and their Tom yum soup especially! I think I'm allergic to their chicken with chili mint tho, I get hives every time I eat it.",UNK
7606,If you have any sort of complaint whatsoever expect management to laugh at you and then hang up the phone.,UNK
7607,So glad for this addition to the Hard Rock.  Pretzel Fondue is fab!  Prices are great...good service.  The decor is very rocker chic and the atmosphere enjoyable!  Wonderful menu selections and a great patio experience as well!,UNK
7608,Very good car wash by hand then wax by hand prices range anywhere from $13 to $200 depending on what you want everybody in Vegas likes a clean shiney car,UNK
7609,"I know its just breakfast, but the portions are huge. Enjoy",UNK
7610,"Ok. This is obviously not the Cadillac Ranch anymore, but the mechanical bull is still there. And the prices too. The food is not terrible nor is it tasty either. Just average. Which is strange because it is eye appealing. Just the taste is not there. I recommend going else where overall.",UNK
7611,Been there once for happy hour they have great deals good food and a lot of options. Only bad thing I can say is it's kindve dark and there and not really welcoming for a sports bar but the staff are friendly and attentive,UNK
7612,I've tried the breakfast sandwiches a couple of times and wasn't too impressed either time.  Seems like glorified fast food and I would much rather have McDonalds since I get what I expect for a more reasonable price.,UNK
7613,That was not a great buffet that i expected. They have simple food. So do not spend your money there.,UNK
7614,This place would be great if it was open.  Note to wendys and every other food place at the phoenix airport....tsa security opens at 3 AM so it would make sense for food to be available then instead of waiting until 5 AM.   FAIL,UNK
7615,Staff was nice food was terrible. I'll never eat here again.,UNK
7616,"The sauce here is what makes the pizza pretty good; the service is whatever and their gyros are so-so.  Their \""pick-up special\"" is great so if you don't want to spend a lot of money, give that a try.",UNK
7617,"This is a funky Starbucks, but the closest to my work. \nNot my favorite one, I have to admit.\nThe crew is always smiling and pleasant enough. \nBut they do seem to be training people a lot. Maybe high turnover?",UNK
7618,Awesome crust.  No smaller side salad option.,UNK
7619,One dollar pizzas on Mondays after 5! (When you buy a drink)\n\nGood food.  Good bartending.,UNK
7620,Not woth the pricing.,UNK
7621,DLUX has great burgers and even better fries. I've been here a number of times and I have never had a bad time or meal. The same goes for the drinks - their specialty cocktails are always mixed perfectly.,UNK
7622,"Staff was very friendly. We were promptly checked in. An employee gave us a small tour while giving information of surrounding attractions. A big plus is the delicious popcorn they offer. Nice little snack! The hotel isn't in the heart if Scottsdale, but it isn't far.",UNK
7623,"We recently tried this place, during lunch.  The crunchy tacos are really good.  The rice and beans are so so.  Haven't tried the Ritas yet.",UNK
7624,"Barry is definitely showing his age, it was almost hard for me to watch some parts of the show when he danced. Overall it was entertaining, my mom is a big fan so I grew up hearing his music. I am only 26 and I think I was definitely one of the youngest people in the crowd.",UNK
7625,The valet here is extremely rude . This is the second bad experience I have had with valet . On top of it I tipped him 5$ and no thank you just a blank stare . I am in the hospitality industry and you must always say thank you .,UNK
7626,"Apparently, they've instituted a policy of requiring that if you order a drink and sit down to enjoy it, you HAVE to order one of their fat-laden, high calorie pastry as well.  Otherwise, they won't sell you the drink.  Disappointed.",UNK
7627,We where just visiting  the area and we look at the reviews and that's what made our decision to eat at the Spoon. The bread was excellent mouth watering! My husband and I had the steak and spare ribs and it was an excellent choice very devious and juicy.,UNK
7628,"Although the price of the food and service was great, the taste of the food was just okay. The menu was extensive but what I ordered was nothing special.",UNK
7629,I got the cutest glasses & the friendliest service here...,UNK
7630,"The Nachos are awesome! Really cool environment to kick back, chill, and get your grub and drink on. Can't wait to come back!",UNK
7631,"Delicious no lettuce salads - except they need to chop their cucumbers smaller. Very yummy food overall. Hate the seating atmosphere. Everyone is on top of each other and not in a good way. But, you can get it to go so thats a bonus.",UNK
7632,"Interesting tricks, but not always entertaining. Tries to rush through the show to be able to sell his DVDs.",UNK
7633,If your hungry in the A.M.  This is the place.  Their breakfast burritos are great.  Enjoy.,UNK
7634,Love coming here for my late night after party cheeseburger run! They're open 24 hours and the service is usually fast and friendly!,UNK
7635,This place was a huge disappointment. The cookies were not chewy as they state but over cooked and crunchy. The ice cream itself was also not very creamy and a bit icy.  The only positive was the customer service was good.,UNK
7636,"Pizza is delish!! We live on Chandler and the 202 and live within 2 and 3 miles of 2 locations and you don't deliver to our address?! Get real. For convenience, we'll order from pizza hut.",UNK
7637,"Went to an event there last evening, their walu is to die for, fresh and delicious, not to mention their selections of different maitais, i will definitely suggest this place for an evening night out for happy hour.",UNK
7638,"This place is fairly new and still getting the word out. The atmosphere is very nice with a great sound system and visual displays. In addition, there is plenty of space and seating (yes, not just VIP) people. It is definitely worth checking out if you want something different in Scottsdale.",UNK
7639,Indeed one of the best Mediterranean restaurants in town! The Greek salad dressing is authentic and delish. Can't wait to go back.,UNK
7640,Located inside Miracle Mile this place offers friendly service and the beer comes to you quick...the beer however is not the best...I'd say try a different brewery,UNK
7641,This gym has everything i could ask for in a workout facility.  I especially love the theater room for cardio.  The staff is friendly and the personal trainers are knowledgeable and supportive of fitness goals.  I have personally worked with Brent for over 6mos and always feel like I get a great workout.,UNK
7642,"Extremely slow service. We waited nearly ten minutes before I had to ask for a manager because  no one came to our table.  They were busy, but someone should have at least acknowledge us.  I will likely not come back.",UNK
7643,Always good pizza never any complaints about it. Got wings with the pizza and wings where super tiny. That's really the only complaint I can have,UNK
7644,"Relaxing atmosphere & service is great. Unfortunately, coffee is weak. Prices are very high.",UNK
7645,"I tried Haven awhile back, late evening. I got the regular cheeseburger with their house sauce - it was good. Lots of fresh fries. I will try again.",UNK
7646,"Average food, average wait service, good happy hour. Staff can be dizzy. Take-out has been a better experience.",UNK
7647,Filthy place.  Bad tasteless food.  Rude waitress.  Yuck!!!!,UNK
7648,"Someone needs to alert corporate.  I show up on a Friday 6pm. 3 guys, yes I said 3 guys, are working the bar.  Not a tilted Kilt girl can be found behind the bar.  So many other options in Pitt for a good bar.",UNK
7649,"This hotel was okay...nothing special, but nothing terrible either. Definitely on the outdated side. I got a room with a king sized bed. It was $79 before tax.",UNK
7650,"Had egg drop soup, salt pepper pork chop, lettuce wraps, Chinese broccoli... Wasn't impressed by any of it.",UNK
7651,Not as good as I remembered. Sent the food back as it tasted off. Pies seemed a bit odd too. Frozen and defrosted? Texture wasnt quite right.,UNK
7652,Worth it only for happy hour prices. For 6 people it was only $60 and everyone got drinks and ate until we were stuffed. I really enjoyed the ground beef nachos and gilroy pizza. The pizzas are really thin and flavorful. Nice atmosphere and chill environment.,UNK
7653,Chef Yoshi has left and the sushi has gone downhill. The sushi is not nearly as creative or fresh as before.,UNK
7654,"Everything was average, the crowd, the food and the service.  It really wasn't memorable.  There are better options, even for Charlotte.",UNK
7655,Words cannot express how much of a hatred I have for Century Link! If I had any other   option I would switch in a heartbeat.,UNK
7656,We paid $17 for a single cheeseburger and a double cheeseburger with any toppings of our choice plus two drinks. We shared a regular fry. The burger was good and the people were nice.,UNK
7657,"Tacos rocked so hard, the Salsa was great, service was friendly and fast. It's a nice change from Gallo Blanco... I'm torn between the two, but that's OKay.",UNK
7658,"Excellent place! Awesome ramen! Good spot for lunch, delicious every time! Try everything with tea and a beer.",UNK
7659,"Came here b4 Wockeez show with a group of friends, steak was good, service was aight - took a while, long while for one of our orders. Good spot to eat but nothing special.",UNK
7660,Brunch Bloody Mary's. Mimosas.  Nice small portioned tasty food . Not stellar service but Good for a brunch.,UNK
7661,"Avoid this place, It has guys hanging out waiting to tow your car. If you eat there and then shop, they watch as you leave the lot and call a tow.",UNK
7662,"Good NY style pizza!  Lunch specials is a good price, too.",UNK
7663,"I really liked this place, so many different things to do. And at night they have live music which is fun. \n\nThey have a couple different restaurants to try and a couple of bars to go to. They allow you to buy a drink and walk around the park which is nice.",UNK
7664,Longest wait for basic food.  Really nothing special.  Had the egg salad sandwich which had more lettuce than anything else.,UNK
7665,I am enjoying the bread. Will be back.,UNK
7666,I have too much fun here. Location is great for avoiding strip traffic and the food court is really convenient. Service at the restaurants is also good and ya gotta love the pool. Staff also is friendly.,UNK
7667,"Mediocre chinese food; it wasn't bad, but it wasn't unique.  The host and my waitress were nice, but we waited long for our food; about 30-45 minutes for 4 dishes for 3 people.",UNK
7668,"Good enough barbecue, but Lucille's is much better.  I like the hot barbecue sauce.",UNK
7669,"This place is perfect if you love soggy pizza,  dining with cock-a-roaches,  and being overcharged. \n\nIt's mostly my own fault, trying to find food on X-Mas eve, even in Vegas was difficult.",UNK
7670,Always hits the stop after some gambling,UNK
7671,"The sushi is good but the service could be better. If you're okay to wait, give it a shot.",UNK
7672,what beats friendly gas attendants PLUS mcdonald's? nothing! gas + food in the desolate southwest Las Vegas area before hitting the freeway and easy access down blue diamond road.,UNK
7673,Wow does this place suck. The menu is solo mixed its hardly even a Greek restauraunt. I ate 4 chicken wings and some gyros and got the craps and the worst stomach ache I've ever had.,UNK
7674,"Decent selection of good quality of fish for sushi or sashimi. AND their hakata ramen was very pleasant and appreciated surprise.  Good rich broth, firm noodles, green onions, and seaweed. The pork slices were about average.",UNK
7675,Im a fan of good chinese. i must say the wonton soup was loaded with big fat wontons 8 of them and the pan fried noode dish with chicken was awesome.. i went twice.. Worth every penny!,UNK
7676,"The atmosphere here is comfortable and attractive.  The service is above average.  The lunch specials are quite appealing, and the food itself is pretty tasty.",UNK
7677,This is decent for what it is. I don't expect much considering we are in Vegas. Filling at best.,UNK
7678,"The food was good, nothing too surprising. Portions are big, worth the money.",UNK
7679,Ate here last night. Was good. Some growing pains as they just opened up. Mahi tacos were very good. Ate there tonight and was very disappointed.  The short rib hash was not hash.  It was stew. As stew it is pretty good. As hash it sucks!,UNK
7680,Needs more fruit at breakfast but all in all a good stay. Helpful staff; business center severely needs update but staff was able to accommodate my needs. I'd stay again.,UNK
7681,Great pizza-wood fired!!  Nice little west valley hidden gem!,UNK
7682,Decent food and the decor is tasteful. Not nearly the best Indian in town but good if you are in the area.\n\nThe quality of the chicken in the Tikka was a little poor.,UNK
7683,Good customer service,UNK
7684,Decent food. I went during lunch time. I'd definately go again.,UNK
7685,"This place always takes so long to seat you, the service is never on point. If you go, make sure you have a ton of time to wait. On the up side, that food is actually pretty good, if you have all afternoon to wait for it that is...",UNK
7686,They have new owners and a new menu. All of the sushi chefs are new too. The new menu is good. There are only so many rolls you can make.  It pretty much comes down to how fresh the product is and how clean the place is. I would recommend you try this place.,UNK
7687,I really enjoy going to Floyds. It's a nice date place with great wine prices and tasty food!,UNK
7688,It was good for airport food.  I enjoyed it.  No stove here. So go with raw only.  Chefs were great and onsite preparing.,UNK
7689,Very relaxing here.. Dark room waterfall...nap time,UNK
7690,"They missed a couple little spots, but otherwise it was a pretty great job. The employees were all friendly (except for one of the vacuumers at the beginning) and made certain I was satisfied before I drove away.",UNK
7691,nice mocha. friendly staff,UNK
7692,"Great staff, new menu items delicious. Love the margaritas, all made with fresh lime juice. House margarita is outstanding. \nOutdoors seating limited yet fun with the colorful chairs, umbrellas etc...",UNK
7693,The iced coffee with extra cream is my all-time favorite. The donuts are good but not amazing. The other food items don't look as appetizing so I've never tried them. The 4 stars is for the coffee only.,UNK
7694,Literally the worst breakfast I've ever had (at twice the price).,UNK
7695,The best goat roti in Charlotte!,UNK
7696,"meh.  steak is not usually a 'good deal' at a restaurant, so I set the bar high.  neither was the steak perfect, nor the atmosphere 'wonderful' nor the service 'great', it was all just 'okay'. and rather expensive",UNK
7697,Food was good! Lemonade was excellent! And the owner is spunky and interactive! Can't go wrong with whatever you order!,UNK
7698,"Had work done there,  People are nice, and helpful.  Prices seem okay.",UNK
7699,Us airways has horrible customer support. Airport is older and needs to be modernized. Their are power cords but you have to know how to find them. All that being said 3 stars for free and fast wifi.,UNK
7700,"I love the selection of baked goods and breakfast treats for work :)  I've never had lunch or eaten here...someday soon, will have to try it.",UNK
7701,I've had a few different experiences at paragon. Every instance involving the owner (steve) has been awful. However Russ one of the sales team has been helpful and pretty attentive. I would not give them my money again. It's a shame.,UNK
7702,"Rude manager, her name is Kara. Report her!!! If she doesnt like to work with people why is she even working there.",UNK
7703,Gets alot of hype from being on Top Chef. But there are much better Thai restaurants in Vegas and the price is too high. It is a tourist trap.,UNK
7704,"Decent way to pass some time with family. In cityscape across from us airways stadium. Not much else to do there during the middle of the day though, also shoe rental is expensive so bring your own if you have them.",UNK
7705,"Yes, it is reasonably priced.  Yes, my food was tasty (6 on a scale of 1-10).  However, the place did not look clean to me--I won't be back because of that.",UNK
7706,VERY fun! the lines were outrageous but it was worth it.. the roller coaster is kinda bumpy & long.. but it will have you super PUMPED. highly recommend riding at night!,UNK
7707,"Excellent, authentic Chinese restaurant. Reminds me of NY. Great service, good prices & tastes great.",UNK
7708,This place is a complete waste of money.  They prowl on poor vulnerable people that are desperate to make changes in their life but once they have your money you don't hear from them again unless you fit there creeper Vegas mold.  Would give them negative stars if I could.,UNK
7709,The calamari was fantastic. The tacos were nice but there are better ones around. Our server was very funny and definitely enhanced the experience. Worth checking out.,UNK
7710,"Good place for an event.  The skywalk was way out of the way, though",UNK
7711,I never had an issue. The cashier was friendly.,UNK
7712,"Stopped by for happy hour, and a great quick meal of the Cal Italia pizza and the meatball appetizer. Great food all around at great prices.",UNK
7713,I really liked this place! Service and food were both really good! The drunken noodles were pretty amazing!!!,UNK
7714,Great place to hold a party! Thank you Dan & staff for making our QCMP Poker Ride a success with the food!,UNK
7715,It's a step above fast food and the menu revolves around chicken tenders.  Service was great.  It took them a little longer to make our orders and they gave us a bunch of free food to make up for it.  Friendly place and good food.,UNK
7716,"Great customer service abd the good is good. You'll find whatever you have a taste for on the menu. Traditional American style restaurant. Each time we come we try to order something different. So far, we haven't ordered anything we were not satisfied with.",UNK
7717,"I have always had good service here. I had placed a catering order that somehow they lost, and they were able to turn the order around in less than 20 minutes the morning that I showed up to pick up the food. AMAZING!!!!!",UNK
7718,Had a very disappointing breakfast. The french toast actually comes with toast. Really? The French toast and bacon came out cold. This is more of a coffee place is a breakfast place.,UNK
7719,Everyone raves about this place and I'm not a huge fan. They put cheese on their potatoes.. you can ask any place to add cheese on your potatoes. I had a 3 cheese omelette and was super disappointed. It was tasteless.,UNK
7720,Way over priced.  Food was okay but definitely not one of the best buffets in town.  Highly recommending passing on this one.,UNK
7721,My husband being a native New Yorker is always searching for a decent pie. He enjoyed Glass Nickels pizza and plans on coming back. \n\nI thought it was okay but I am an Ian's Pizza junkie.,UNK
7722,Just had breakfast the mimosas good breakfast good but way to many flys it's someone left door open all day.,UNK
7723,Rudeness......dumbness......carelessness.....dont go there,UNK
7724,"The service is terrible, It took at least an hour for my table to get our food after ordering it. Not to mention it is cold inside, and uncomfortable. The food was average.",UNK
7725,"This place is closed for quite a few months.\nA new \""Asian Fusion\"" place is supposed to open at this location soon...word has it in town.",UNK
7726,Nice place to get a reasonable price meal in Vegas. I stop by everytime I'm here in Vegas. The service is immpecable and the waitress uniforms are a plus side..,UNK
7727,"I ordered the Skinny Turkey Burger.  The worst Turkey Burger I have ever had.  It was dense, dry and without flavor.  The lettuce and tomato were sparse at best.",UNK
7728,For a sit down Filipino restaurant I expect better. The food is blah I will only return to try breakfast but other than that I'll stick to my buffet style places or home for Filipino food.,UNK
7729,"I HATE IT!!!!!!!\nThey charge you twice the amount, than you would normally pay at the neighborhood corner SB's.\nIt's the same coffee dammit!",UNK
7730,"Just had fish and chips, some of the worst ever. The batter was solid with very little fish inside. The chips had obviously been cooked ages ago and were  rubbish. A complete waste of money and would never go back",UNK
7731,"Barbeque is very subjective, and I happen to love the pulled turkey and the sauce here and will keep going back for it again and again. I suggest at least giving it a try, if you don't like it there keep trying different palces.",UNK
7732,"I have never tried Greek food, but after eating here- I truly enjoy it! Their garlic sauce and chicken shawarma  was fantastic! It's very tasty =) they have great customer service and I will definitely go back again!",UNK
7733,It's okay.  Sorry I grew up on San Francisco's Chinese food.  I rather go to Orchid Gardens on Sahara!,UNK
7734,"You used to be so much better, really going down hill :(",UNK
7735,i never thought i would say this but i hated this place they were disrespectful messed up my order and accused me of lying showed my receipt and got no apology or anything i almost hauled off and slapped her ass,UNK
7736,Still one of the best places on earth to buy toys and video games.  Their selection is great and usually they have great sales right before major holidays.,UNK
7737,"22 people in line before me, and we don't seem to be moving.  Must be new people working, I don't recognize them and they are SLOWWWWWW.",UNK
7738,"the sandwich was amazing....but defintiely not worth $9. I've definitely had better.  It didn't even come with a side. great location and outdoor seating, but overrated.",UNK
7739,I have a bad experience when come here before and I never come back again. The food is not good as I expected. Maybe I come back some days and retry.,UNK
7740,"This club is a nice looking club, newly opened, empty, terribly promoted.",UNK
7741,I can't say enough about how cool the staging is!  It is totally amazing!  This is the first Cirque that truly had a story from beginning to end.  The only negative that I could provide is that some acts maybe went too long.,UNK
7742,good but too busy,UNK
7743,"Decent food, really good hot salsa, but the prices are RIDIC. We won't be back.",UNK
7744,"What a dump, I had dinner at the steakhouse after that I was told I couldn't go to the club because I was wearing a velour track suit?  Over priced drinks and they let hookers in.",UNK
7745,"Very friendly and food was delicious.  I did think they were a bit over priced, but food was good.",UNK
7746,"Nice store and nice staff. They always have seasonal decorations which is great. Things can be hard to find sometimes since there is so much stuff, but the staff is always there to help.",UNK
7747,Their broth is weak. Food no flavor.,UNK
7748,"Newest update The owner here is charging .60 for a stinking refill that costs him 2 to 3 cents. I don't know what this guy is thinking. Greed, Greed, Greed!!!!!",UNK
7749,The service was awful. I ordered a club sandwich and my wife and son both ordered Tuscan chicken. We waited 40 minutes for the food to arrive. My wife's chicken was burnt so that was sent back. Not a good experience considering what we paid. Will never go back again.,UNK
7750,The new owners of Ice House Tavern are no longer hosting live bands. This is such a disappointment to the local music scene!,UNK
7751,"I've been coming here with my family since I was a kid. Unfortunately, it seems as though the taste of the food has gone bad, new cooks perhaps?  Although there are many that still choose to eat here, I will no longer return especially after receiving poor customer service.",UNK

7755,This is the closest subway to my work. Its clean and convenient.  Eat Fresh!,UNK
7756,Ordered a chicken Parmesan toasted sub at the guys recommendation. The outside of the sandwich looked pretty good but it was stuffed with thin breaded 'chicken' strips that had meat similar to what you get in a McDonald's chicken nugget. For 8 bucks I expected somewhat better.,UNK
7757,"The customer service people in this Gap need more training in \""customer service\""",UNK

7769,This buffet is a classic case of you get what you pay for. I went there after playing some poker downstairs. I won so I was in a good mood. Unfortunately the food was just average at best. I give it an extra star because the ice cream was good.,UNK
7770,"Watch your drink! We loved going in to have a cold one every time we are in Ole Town, one of our party experienced being hit by a drug. It could have been really bad, had we were not a large group and was able to care for our friend!",UNK

7780,"What's there not to like about breakfast/brunch food. At a reasonable price and with an extensive menu, Eggspectation is a level above your grungy diner. Definitely the place to go after a night of partying out in the streets of Montreezy.",UNK

7791,"While their sweet selection is interesting, I only go here out of proximity to my house. The price is higher than most tea houses and the drinks are a bit sweeter, but the staff is friendly and great vegan selection.",UNK
7792,"I would have thought they would have better service considering the overabundance of staff. Kind of an \""iffy\"" location. Not easy in & out access. Parking behind store only.",UNK
7793,I stay here on business while visiting a customer right down the street. Rather far from decent restaurants but not a bad stay and very comfortable. Hilton honors club members have our own floor.,UNK

7814,"As a copperfield fan since the 90s, I have three words to describe this show: Phoning. It. In. He could at least appear to gaf, instead of looking as if he would rather be in his special place than do a show.  Great illusions. Horrible showmanship.",UNK
7815,"I've eaten here twice, it was better a few years back. The steak wasn't that great quality in general for the steak. The sides and salads were excellent. I'm kind of upset that they share the name with the fantastic steakhouse Emeril owns in New Orleans.",UNK

7821,Service - terrible; food - so-so; blonde waitress with a massive black eye - classy.,UNK

7826,I don't know which was worse.....the prices or the customer service. This place is expensive for the quality of what comes out. The staff was rude and very short. I will not be going back!,UNK

7835,"It's a HUGE slice and a fair price but, other than that, I don't share the enthusiasm for Mamma Mia's. It's just \""OK.\""",UNK
7836,Hooters more or less. Plenty of eye candy and terrible food. The mix drinks are terrible. Beer only.,UNK
7837,The food is pretty good but not outstanding. Nice atmosphere. Outdoor seating. I had a great strawberry margarita and their fideo soup is very yummy.,UNK
7838,Good prices.  It's like a cheaper H&M but the quality is good for its price point.  They have amazing deals on tank tops (I love tank tops) and short shorts for men(also love me some short shorts lol).,UNK
7839,Worst bartenders here! You can stand @ the bar for a long period of time before any of them will acknowledge you & this happens when their not busy! This has happened more then once. I guess they don't care about making $$$$$.,UNK
7840,"Except for the fact that they serve Peet's coffee, nothing will entice me to return here anytime soon. The interior is too drab for me. It didn't make want to linger. I ended up picking up my coffee and walking out.",UNK
7841,Excellent Tika Masala Chicken!  I would highly recommend this place for good Indian food. Nice atmosphere!,UNK

7844,Great selection of Bbq/smoking needs!,UNK
7845,The food is really really good and is not very expensive.  I love hush puppies and they were probably the best I have ever had.  The burgers and sandwiches are all really good and the service is fantastic.  The only problem is that the place is small and the wait is usually long.,UNK
7846,"Asshole bouncers, ugly patrons, bad music, expensive cover, pricey drinks, but hey, you can get in.  I'd rather sit at the slots an or play bingo with the blue hairs.\n\nDon't watse your time or money.",UNK

7858,"I loved the molcajete! The margarita was really good as well, and it sneaks up on you.. i could barely make it to the car!",UNK
7859,"Good, fresh fish. Sat at the bar and received decent service as the sushi chef made eye contact often to see if we needed anything else. Deducted a star for the hair found in my ginger toward the end of my meal.",UNK
7860,"Very disappointed. Management did not deliver what we reserved and confirmed before our arrival.  Lots of  little problems and two BIG ISSUES, add up to a bad review and a don't bother recommendation. Try the Orleans, off the strip. Much better and free shuttle to the strip.",UNK
7861,This theater gets dirtier everytime I go in it.,UNK
7862,This is a small acoustic club that is definitely worth the visit.  There is limited seating so plan to arrive early if you want a seat.  The food is pretty good and the service is very good.  I have seen some great shows here and plan to go back often.,UNK
7863,"Has a really big splash bad, biggest I've seen all over town. Splash pad does not function till May 31.Park is clean but the bathroom stalls have no door. The basketball court is kid sized. The parking lot is tiny.",UNK
7864,We found the pizza very good but too pricey for what they serve. Service was ok but not spectacular. It was convenient because we spent the day at the New York-New York Casino. But there are better and less expensive alternatives for good New York Style Pizza in Las Vegas.,UNK
7865,I called Central Towing last night because I had accidentally locked my keys inside my car. They said it was going to be about a 25 minute wait. After an hour I called several times... no answer. They didn't show up until an hour and a half later!,UNK

7869,"Busy night on Thursday but solid service. Pho was mediocre with the broth arriving to our table lukewarm. Not ideal. Also had beef spring rolls, good not great. Overall I've had better Vietnamese in Vegas.",UNK
7870,"Local, Farm Fresh, Organic!\nSouth Tryon Street is the best location of all their stores. \nOne of my favorites and I'm a regular here. Check it out.\nPS - They make smoothies",UNK
7871,The service sucks here. The girl has no personality and she looks like she came to work in her pjs. The food was awful and it sucked. Definitely would not come back or recommend to anyone.,UNK
7872,"Too expensive to buy anything here!!\nJust walk here, touch around and walk out.",UNK
7873,"Waited 45 minutes and still had no service. If you're a busy person, go to Great Clips across the street.",UNK
7874,Absolutely not. My drink was weak as hell. Tastes like sour lime juice and ice. It's decor is great but whyyyyy is everything over-priced?,UNK
7875,"Good food although very spicy.  Good service and ambient.  Good for kids too, a bowl of rice is always a success with them",UNK
7876,Went here for breakfast and it was just okay. The vegan options were minimal and our meal was just ehh.,UNK

7881,do not use these people to finance  your vehicle.  They do not fully disclose fees and terms and when you get to the end of your loan you will have a surprise.  Unethical,UNK
7882,"The staff is very friendly. Service is good. Food is also very good. For guys, sitting and being able to watch ESPN on with flat screen is an added plus! :-)",UNK
7883,"Great new addition to downtown Phoenix!  We have stopped in a few times already and have been very impressed with everything we tried.  They offer an extensive and reasonably priced happy hour, so highly recommend checking it out.  The edamame and potstickers are quite good and the rice bowls are tasty too.",UNK
7884,Stopped in to buy a couple bags of ice.   Counter person said they didn't have any. Spoke with a manager who said sometimes they have it and sometimes they don't.  No one wanted to bag any.,UNK
7885,Nice workers and good food. It seems to have the problems that a new location would have but I'm hopefully they will get them worked out soon.\n\n\nThe sweet pork tacos and burritos are awesome.,UNK
7886,"Worst Apple Store in the nation! Always chaos, horrible customer service. Just order online.",UNK

7891,The stadium is fantastic. I took off a star for the terrible parking and single exit.,UNK
7892,Easily some of the worst service I've ever had. Over priced and overrated at even one star. Rude servers. Slow service. Food average at best. Beers ok if you can get any. Stay away. Lots of better options out there.,UNK
7893,Average show worth the price of free if you can get them. Juggler comedian was the highlight.,UNK
7894,"Conceptually, I think this place is great.  Beautiful design, clean, efficient system.  I am very disappointed with their work, though.  My gel manicure was $35 and looked rough from the moment I walked out the door.  See photo from 8/2 of light pink polish.",UNK

7896,"Yummy food, reasonable prices....need I say more?",UNK
7897,"The food was not oily which is good. However, it lacks taste. To make matter worse, it was extremely salty. The decor was light and the place was clean. None of the above matters if the food is not good. I will not go back again.",UNK
7898,"I stopped in for a lunch the other day.  Meh.   not impressed.  I had a \""tuna melt\"" - which ended up being a bland tuna sandwich on toasted bread.  Onion rings were from a frozen bag....lame.",UNK
7899,Had breakfast here. Huge pancakes! Very good food and good service.,UNK
7900,I was in town visiting a friend and he said this was a good local bar where we could have a couple beer and play a game of poker. I wish there were something like that in OC. Apparently they have a HUGE soccer following..we were there in January. A good time!,UNK
7901,"Compared to L&L and aloha Hawaiian BBQ, I like ohana the best. Their daily specials are a cant beat deal. I also like their Chinese menu items. It's a nice change of pace sometimes. Loco moco is probably the best thing here.",UNK
7902,"I want to start off by saying that the restaurant is well put. The sandwhiches and smoothies are good, but apart from the pastry, there isn't really anything too special about it.",UNK
7903,We went here for dinner Thanksgiving Day with a party of 12. Our waitress was really nice and super accommodating. I got chicken and waffles. Pretty yummy. Portions are epic here. No one was able to finish their dish. You definitely get your money's worth.,UNK
7904,"Service is great, the dish I got was disappointing, but the server had it taken off my bill without me asking or suggesting to take it off.  Any establishment that does that is top notch in my eyes, they remember how important the guest experience is to people.",UNK
7905,"Only reason I ate there was \""kids eat free\"".  The boxed cereal was good.  Kelloggs sure does know how to make their Corn Flakes.",UNK
7906,"Solid diner food. The Chicken Fried Steak is \""legit\"". Their version of Loco Moco is \""meh\"", you should pass.",UNK
7907,"This place has a nice lunch special. You get soup, salad and a three selection combination plate for about $13. I chose the teriyaki beef, combination tempura and California rolls. I couldn't finish my plate. The service was good and the atmosphere was fine for lunch.",UNK
7908,"Need better wine sampler glasses. Way too small to see, smell and taste the wine.  Need to,knock it up a notch if you expect clients to purchase your wine.",UNK
7909,This buffet was quite the disappointment. The food didn't look appetizing and they still had breakfast food at 3pm. There weren't that many options and the options that were there wasn't great. Would not return.,UNK
7910,Very great atmosphere had a wonderful bartender so much that we came back to eat and it was awesome food SPENDY but worth it! Thanks Matt for the homemade Sangria!!,UNK
7911,Friendly knowledgeable staff. Get your cellphone fixed up fast!,UNK
7912,"If you have been to the Ditka's in Chicago, do not eat here. You will be sad. Very sad. This Ditka's is a very poor imitation of the original. The hostesses really should be looking at careers in the prison system.",UNK
7913,"We were at the New York New York for the Manhattan Express roller coaster... and after walking around so much, we were hungry. \n\nWe shared a hot dog and some fries. Both were edible/decent.. nothing special here.",UNK

7915,This place is as bland as they get. The food was mediocre and the atmosphere was too.,UNK

7917,very typical dim sum. i don't know why it's still called a buffet though since they are no longer a buffet.,UNK

7922,Great coffee because it it peets.,UNK
7923,"This was one of the first places I tried in Madison.  After having several brunches and lunches this is one of my favorite places to go.  The food at this clean, upscale Irish styled pub is consistently very good as is the atmosphere and service.",UNK

7926,Show aside. The Venetian Theater had one bartender / server. Never expect the Venetian to have any customer service.hundreds of Vegas tourist ? Genius!!!!  .,UNK
7927,"I really like this Mimi's, it seems nicer than the one we used to frequent in/near Summerlin. Very friendly staff, clean amenities, and the food is about what I would expect for the prices. My husband hates the coffee here, other than that, it's all good!",UNK

7935,"Got me some pho, and it came with a standard metal spoon and didn't come with any cilanto or mint leaves. Service was less than exceptional. However, the Japanese Dancing with the Stars knockoff on TV was pretty entertaining.",UNK
7936,Good little greasy spoon. Decent prices and for good food.,UNK
7937,will post a review when I can recolate. I have nothing bad to say except this place rocks. Need to provide detaisl for viwers,UNK
7938,"The place is like attending an event that will never happen.  The ceiling was too high, and the atmosphere anything but cozy.  Sound bounced off the walls like a bus station, and the food at best....mediocre.",UNK
7939,"Did not live up to what others have said about the place. 5 guys across the street is much better, smashbuger continues to the best burger in town!",UNK
7940,it's seems like medium means well done here so make your self clear!,UNK
7941,Great food but terrible service ! All the servers are complement and could care less .,UNK
7942,the property is undergoing construction.   You may want to select another location until they are done.   then you should let a few months pass and check the reviews again.,UNK
7943,Total bargain!  Will take Megabus again in the future.  The drivers are very strict and will yell at you if you're talking too loudly but I guess I appreciated that.  The electricity outlets and Wifi didn't work on the trip to NYC but did on the way back.,UNK
7944,this place sucks big time invited by one of the host here for a comped suit  lost 8600 palyin here and still got charged 1250.00 for 2 nights i will defienitly not be back very disapointed mr maloof,UNK
7945,3.5 stars. Not bad but not great. Always have to judge a Mexican restaurant by there salsa and enchiladas.. Both were meh+,UNK
7946,"Good spot for drinks and snacks after work. The fish and chips are amazing, and so is the (huge!) salad with blue cheese and grilled chicken. It's also a very good place for brunches!",UNK
7947,Not worth the price. I would not go back. Pretty unexciting.,UNK
7948,"I think this place is rated 4 stars because of all the hungover hipsters in Plaza, and waffle house isnt close by. Nothing special, and it's cash only.",UNK
7949,"Good, not great. For the price, there are better steakhouses to choose from in Madison.",UNK
7950,"I took my kid in for wash/deep cond, she has VERY CURLY hair that tangles EZ, Sasha complained about her back hurting & it taking to long for her to comb out. Her 1st experience & probably last",UNK
7951,"The pastries were flat and did not have much filling inside. They have room for improvement. \n\nI tried several of the buns, with high hopes for the red bean, but it was disappointing.",UNK
7952,The service was the best!!! The food was horrible!! Will be back to try again only because of the service ...,UNK
7953,"Gross! Diva chefs won't accommodate minor requests .. All I wanted was different onions!!! Bland, tasteless and plain boring!\nWorst feeling.. Leaving a restaurant hungry",UNK
7954,"OK, so I lied.  There is something that would compel me to return to this restaurant, and that is an offer from the corporate office to return to the restaurant in an effort to change my mind.  I'll let you know the results...",UNK
7955,I've always had good experiences here. Everyone seems very competent and professional.,UNK
7956,"Trendy atmosphere, friendly yet slow staff, good sandwich but not mind-blowing. Maybe I expected too much.",UNK
7957,Very average.  The big eye app was not fresh.  The Kobe beef carpaccio was flavorless and seemed like it might have been seared.\n\nI left it at that before diving into a very overpriced steak,UNK
7958,"No wifi. Very small, low ceilings. Equipment is very close together.",UNK
7959,Solid hotel and very cheap.  We would go back.,UNK
7960,I tried the pan fried crispy noodles with chicken and the pad thai.  Both were disgusting! I actually had to return the pan fried noodles because it was not edible.,UNK
7961,"Will not return.  Food was lacking in flavor, as well as being brought to the table in a haphazard way.",UNK
7962,Amanda is the only employee on this store that is working. All others are wandering around aimlessly and chatting with co'workers'.,UNK
7963,"This place is a lot like your local BJ's, with more beer and crappier food. I only give this place such a favorable rating because they've got a beer for everyone and they've got it on draft. Holla.",UNK
7964,First time they served me oatmeal in a cup. Second time they have no hot chocolate and I still had to wait in the drive thru. Unsure why the management staff is unable to order the right amount of inventory. Im not giving a 3rd chance to be disappointed.,UNK
7965,"Selection was poor. The customer service was ok as the woman in the shop was helpful and wanted to please, but the few gowns they did have were old and outdated.",UNK
7966,"Really poor service, really long waits, incredibly average food at a pretty absurd price. No free refills on soft drinks is always something that irks me as well.",UNK
7967,Tr\u00e8s bon burger dans une ambiance de pub.,UNK
7968,"Waitress Diane was super! The place is freezing.  All are complaining. The male manager Shane called us guys! Corrected him, but he remembered me from Sunset restaurants.  Told him he should set an example for his staff! SMDH!",UNK
7969,"Terrible. \n\nMeatball sampler. Five dry fried meatballs. 5 boring sauces. Two pieces of toast.\n\nPass on this \""spot\"".",UNK
7970,Good coffee but Their unrefrigerated mayo is breeding ground for salmonella.   great place for food poisoning.,UNK
7971,"I have to admit, I thought it was going to be better. At its price it's good,but paying a few dollars more gets you better Indian in PGH. Sweet woman owns and operates the store. But please try it and give her some support",UNK
7972,Good assortment of riding gear for both off-road and street riding. Mediocre customer service. Average prices.,UNK
7973,Great quality restaurant.  Had the Sushi many times and its always good!  Big desserts to share!,UNK
7974,"Really enjoyed the extensive menu and many choices for vegan, etc.  Food was excellent quality and value.  Staff was very nice.  Don't go if you're in a hurry it's a relaxed pace.",UNK
7975,"Sent back a bloody steak and didnt see it for 30 minutes. desert took another 45 min to get there. Ruined our anniversery dinner, Longest meal I have ever had to sit thru...",UNK
7976,"It was a 2 hour wait with online reservations, but after that everything was quick and smooth. This place needs more staff. The car was nice and the return was smooth. You get what you pay for, and you don't pay much.",UNK
7977,"Make sure you ask at the counter & take the free cvs club card! They have lot of sales, like right now they are doing a buy one, get one free for so many items in the nutrients/ vitamins, etc section.",UNK
7978,Bought a groupon and thought I would give this a shot.  The beans and rice were fine but the meat seemed to be of a low quality.  I will not go back and wouldn't recommend.,UNK
7979,"The quality and selection has gone down during the past few months.  The \""Wife\"" has a lousy attitude and it shows in they way the restaurant is run.",UNK
7980,"It's priced well and it's clean. Don't expect this to be a 5 star hotel. The price is well worth the stay, as long as you remember that you will have to get your own linen and kitchen supplies at the front desk.",UNK
7981,Came for happy hour and had a mixed drink and the spinach dip. The dip was really good with sliced baguette slices but the mixed drink was weaker than something from a cheap bar. I watched the pour and it was barely a second and it cost me ten bucks. Complete ripoff.,UNK
7982,What a Dump compared to Walmart and Target. Their aisles and merchandise are unorganized and sloppy. I don't know how they stay in business.,UNK
7983,As far as a Quizno's goes this one is clean and the owner is very friendly.  I'm in here a lot since it's close to work and enjoy the food.  Gets busy around noon but the line moves pretty fast,UNK
7984,"While the food is ok, who wants to pay $15 for a roast beef sandwich. Jasons Deli is a much better deal.",UNK
7985,"Way over priced. Fancy Mexican food, there's no such thing in my mind.  $9 for a 12 ounce Margarita is absurd.",UNK
7986,I've stayed at the Luxor for over a month in the pyramid. It is one of the coolest hotels and every experience was great.,UNK
7987,The wash was good but service moved way too slowly (I waited an hour for my car),UNK
7988,If I could give this dentist no stars I would. She has no idea how to listen to patients. She is the worst dentist I've ever seen.,UNK
7989,"Very beautiful hotel. Super sleek and modern. The rooms are a bit small, but it has a very beautiful view of the strip. I've stayed here about 3 times already, and enjoy it every time. Extremely classy place to be.",UNK
7990,Saturday night...45 minutes later...no food!  Poor service!,UNK
7991,Beware! Horrible service. We went to all you can eat lunch and if you leave meat on the plate the waiter will charge you extra at the end of lunch. The meat looked like dog food with no flavor. I left the place wanting to throw up. Never again!!!!!!,UNK
7992,Definitely not authentic Indian food...felt like fast food Indian food at best.  Service and atmosphere were just ok.,UNK
7993,"Front desk receptionist is a little abrasive. He should brush up on his customer service skills. The acupuncture was gentle, and took alot of pressure off of my neck. So far so good.",UNK
7994,Hadn't been here for a while and decided to get some food to go.  Fish and chips was good.  Wings tasted like they had been cooked in old oil and the French Dip was horrible - the meat was as tough as shoe leather!  Will NOT eat here again!!,UNK
7995,"In short: cute stuff but a little pricey. But I guess this is a \""vintage\"" store and not thrift store.... -___- I left here with some cute things but wasn't too overly excited.",UNK
7996,"Nice dessert, love the ham, seafood area is disappointing, about 15 mins to start your food including line up to pay, get to seat, not bad for Tuesday lunch.",UNK
7997,Had the cheeseburger and clam chowder. Delicious and good price! They delivered pretty fast. Great service. Looking forward to trying more.,UNK
7998,I just love this food! It's always delicious and the service is pretty good! I am the kind of girl that just likes good food and this is the kind of spot that keeps me coming back for more! Yum!,UNK
7999,$5.75 yuengling draught. Boobs I can't touch aren't worth that much to me. Only the aesthetics bumped this place to two stars.,UNK
8000,I would give them a negative star if possible. I scheduled a 2pm pick up to the airport and No Show No Call!! Discount cab to the rescue! Yellow can suck it. Unreliable!!!,UNK
8001,"Pretty average Indian buffet.  Not enough vegetable dishes, everything had meat and we can't eat meat.  Green tea was $5.00 which seemed high.",UNK
8002,"My husband had breakfast Hawaian burger, cool, unique different.  I had a milkshake and toast (a bit hungover).  Cool atmosphere and good service (although a little slow when we first arrived to be waited on).",UNK
8003,"Ordered two blizzards, two cones and two smoothies, it took nearly 30 mins!! Their were 5 ppl working and yet service so slow. NEVER again.",UNK
8004,"I really like the breakfast items and the hot chocolate is good too.  The atmosphere is intimat and much like a coffee house.  The MOMS group meets there, so they could use more high chairs and a kids menu.",UNK
8005,Tiffany never brought my water. I asked seven times.\n\nI was only here for karaoke.,UNK
8006,"Total manipulation at Las Vegas airport Advantage counter! Reservation was for noon. Arrives at counter at 11:25 and was told I was too early! I stood 50' away for 30 minutes. Then manipulated up charges! Make sure you rent what YOU want, not what SHE sells.",UNK
8007,Tiny little place with great ambiance. I love the fact it is staffed by volunteers and all proceeds go to Seeds of Hope. Good coffee. If they had a few more available munchies they would be all set.,UNK
8008,Meh....decent Filibertos knockoff but the place feels like a major health hazard considering how new it is.\n\nJust think Filibertos with less quality control and smaller portions.,UNK
8009,Not on the approved diet...but dam good,UNK
8010,DSW is one of my favorite places to buy shoes. They have a wide variety at discounted prices.,UNK
8011,"Exellant food! Inexpensive lunch buffet ( like 8.95). Friendly staff. Best beans and rice anywhere! Not much more to ask for. Food portions are inconsistant, I think it depends on who's cooking.",UNK
8012,This place is a blast from the past in every way shape and form -  The Only thing it has going for it is how close it is to the convention center \nBring you Ebola hazard suits here - you will need them - who knows what is hidden behind the walls of this place,UNK
8013,SERVICE HORRIBLE!!!\nHostess could care less and server at bar was too busy flirting with some girl to pay us any mind!\nFood way overpriced and not that good!\n  What a huge let down!!,UNK
8014,"Unfriendly staff and they don't even have toothpaste, toothbrushes or shower gel when we requested for these! Had to run out to get these basic essentials middle of the night. Will never stay here again.",UNK
8015,"Ok prices, Ok food. I would rather go to Thai Basil. The portions don't match the price, in my opinion.",UNK
8016,"Rated \""10 best family restaurant chains\"". Fine, two reasons to hate it.",UNK
8017,"The food overall is average, nothing special, but the Sunday Brunch is small, good quality, and reasonably priced. We go there during the winter when it is nice time to sit outside on the patio.",UNK
8018,"It's great to pick your dinner with a salad bar as a side-item. Also, their menus have a lot of options if you don't want a big meal. Overall I have been here a few times and never disappoint.",UNK
8019,Food is overall good but every roll has imitation crabmeat. I'm pretty sure this is their way of getting you full when you choose all you can eat.,UNK
8020,"I had extremely high expectations for this place due to the amazing pasta sauce with the same name.  Its ok, decent ingredients but lacking significant flavor.  Pricing is ok for Vegas.  The music selection doesn't match the resturant",UNK
8021,One of the best Filipino restaurant in Phoenix AZ. Very friendly staff. Desserts are amazing.,UNK
8022,"The bald guy with the glasses clearly does not enjoy his job as he was rude and impolite. He worked super slow and had a grimace on his face the whole time, you could clearly see he was \""overjoyed\"" to be working behind the counter.",UNK
8023,"I Love it here!  I've been here around 3-4 times... Great Chinese Food! Service is Great!  Quite, Elegant Ambience... Beautiful Asian Decor.  Love the Blond Bartender! She knows her wines!",UNK
8024,Had a flight out at noon so I decided to check out this place.  Breakfast is only served here until 10AM.  So placed my ordered for a cheesesteak sandwich.  Definitely had better.\n\nBut the wait staff was awesome.,UNK
8025,"Prices are high, choices are limited, the staff is small. Do not try to call or search for help. Michael's is way better in my opinion.",UNK
8026,"The location is always busy, but always very clean...everytime I've been they have what I need! \n\n\nAnd its' in a great location!",UNK
8027,"1 star for being 2 blocks away from work\n1 star for serving super cheap, super large beers\n1 star for being kicked out from an Applebee's -YES, AN APPLEBEE'S- after 5 super cheap, super large beers",UNK
8028,"Mexican food for white people.  It's clean and nice inside, but food is not authentic.",UNK
8029,This is like my go to fast food place. The food is almost always fresh and delicious the only problem here is the customer service. They're always rude and act like they hate their lives. But the fast and speedy service makes up for their bitchyness I guess lol.,UNK
8030,Great thin crust pizza with fresh ingredients.  Place was really hopping and service was awesome.,UNK
8031,"Their patio had a great view of the strip, and the live band and dancer was pretty cool. My husband and I were not very impressed with the food though. It seems like a great place to go for a drink, but maybe skip dinner here.",UNK
8032,"I deducted 2 stars because the yogurt was not that frozen - actually kind of runny and melted fast.  Otherwise, a fun place and fun staff.",UNK
8033,"Horrible. Do not eat here. I felt sick afterwards, and my girlfriends mom got really sick later that night. Service was horrible. And very overpriced for what you get.",UNK
8034,Deano the bartender was very nice and very good with customer service. But the philly cheese steak! OMG! That thing was SO SALTY! I will never ever get in my life again,UNK
8035,The food is excellent and the delivery service is outstanding.  They handle everything with a smile. We've eaten our way through the menu and haven't found anything that wasn't good.,UNK
8036,I liked it bc of the coupons but it is now closed they informed me by email.,UNK
8037,More guys here than girls....lol.just waiting for a girl to take her top off,UNK
8038,"Very close to home, average Mexican food. I wish it was better, we'd come much more often.",UNK
8039,Cool atmosphere and motif. The beer list is good and the prices aren't bad. Good selection of food items and the sandwiches are delicious.,UNK
8040,"The complimentary chips come with 4 dips, a bean, sour cream, salsa, and green chili. Nice touch versus the usual chips and salsa. \nI ordered the chicken fajitas. The rice was a little soggy, but everything else was good.",UNK
8041,"Good massage...but with clothes on most of the time.  They do know what they are doing though, and both my husband and i felt much less tension in the muscles afterwards.",UNK
8042,Nice place.. wish there were bigger TVs.. but had a wide variety of beers on tap.. i even had the half yard glass (32 oz).. try the turkey stacker with the special sauce..,UNK
8043,This place is a waste of time head down the street to humbertos instead same price better food,UNK
8044,"Not the best bar, but bartenders were super nice and hooked it up :)",UNK
8045,"great restaurant, i went here few weeks ago, and tried to eat all you can eat. food was great and yangnum galbi was great too. Great restaurant.",UNK
8046,"Remembered it being better at their old location, to be honest I was quite disappointed this last time. Probably won't be back.",UNK
8047,"My pancakes had pockets of flour in them. Not scratch, just a mix. One star for service. That's it. Won't be back.  Yeplers, 3.5 stars? Really?  You guys burnt me on this one.",UNK
8048,Ordered chili cheese fries and they ran out of cheese!  Was close to their closing time but i really was craving bad bad food!,UNK
8049,I would have to say one of the best oyster bars of all times. Have gotten better quality seafood here than in the south and nw. Always fun to watch them cook your combo pan roast in front of you.,UNK
8050,"Nothing special..decent seating, good service, nothing extraordinary about the food. It tasted like any average Indian place, but I don't have high expectations from an Indian place in las vegas! \nWould I go there again? Yes",UNK
8051,This is one of the good dimsum places in Las Vegas.,UNK
8052,Office and restrooms are very dusty and dirty. Staff is rude and to busy with inside gossip then to help or be even cordial. I was referred by my primary so I drove all the way from the far west valley. To be treated like crap. Love it.,UNK
8053,"I've gone a few times, ordered something different each time, hoping that something stood out as good. No such luck.\nLasagna, manicotti, and of course pizza. Nothing was that good.",UNK
8054,"Tacos were good and simple.  They were small and cheap, you'll want to order a few. Horchata was good and homemade.  Beans were plain.  Certainly not the best I've tried but I would come back.",UNK
8055,"Bad food, bad service. We will not be back.",UNK
8056,Food was great.  Service was extremely slow for us last Tuesday.  They may have been short-staffed as our waitress was also the bartender.  The folks who came after us almost left after they were seated for the same reason.,UNK
8057,Food was cold and not true Spanish tapas. Would never go back even with a Groupon. No windows which made me feel like I was in a dungeon.,UNK
8058,Food and atmosphere is great! The owner is fun if you get to meet her. I love the fact that you can BYOB thus saving a ton of money on drinks.  I have had less expensive Pho though but the Pho here is great!,UNK
8059,"It's bar food. Who cares. The place is a lot of fun. I always walk out with a smile on my face. FANTASTIC Friday Happy Hour. 50\u00a2 beer and a free buffet of \""snack food.\""",UNK
8060,"Large Portions, B+ Service. Clean.  Extensive Menu but ultimately underwhelming hotel  food.   Good if you are staying at the hotel but not a destination.",UNK
8061,"I was impressed with the variety of goods but the service was, like most things Quebec, lethargic and indifferent. Very likely due to me being English speaking. Stores like this have convinced me that internet shopping (in the USA) is the way to go. Too bad.",UNK
8062,"Authentic food, but they messed up my order and over charged us.",UNK
8063,I do not recommend coming here for breakfast. The menu is over priced for terrible food. I had the scrambled eggs with bacon and wheat toast and my mother had the french toast. The food was luke warm to cold and wouldn't recommend either.,UNK
8064,"I thought this place was good, but service wasn't that great. I liked the atmosphere and what I did eat, so I'll be going back.",UNK
8065,"This may be the worst McDonalds in Arizona.  Poorly designed facility makes it almost impossible to access soft drinks and condiments.  To top it off, the food is usually stale or cold.",UNK
8066,"First time here. Pad thai okay with plenty of shrimp, chicken and tofu. Juicier than traditional Thai food. Good service. Deconstructed taco looked good. Enough food with each meal.",UNK
8067,"Delicious,  good service",UNK
8068,Was in town for my friend's 40th birthday and stayed at Bally's. Dirty room. Found toe nail clippings throughout the room including a massive big toe toenail clipping.,UNK
8069,"Ugh. Ate here because some coworkers said, \""You HAVE to try the bobo chicken!\"". More like doodoo chicken. What the f$!% did I just eat?!",UNK
8070,This was horrible. The service was really bad. We didn't have our meal. Ie never came because we left...took over two hours to get appetizer. Horrible.never go,UNK
8071,ew don't even bother. I always see a long line here too.\nonly came here because we stayed at ballys and didn't want to migrate far for food.\n\nworst buffett ever.,UNK
8072,"Just like every eatery, it is hit or miss with the service.  However this time, what's notable is the shrinkage of the menu and the quality of service.",UNK
8073,"Price matching to online stores IS advertised in the store but as soon as you bring it up, they start with the bad attitudes and make you walk all over the store to deal with multiple employees. It was worth it for me price matching to Amazon and saving more than $50 on a $140 though.",UNK
8074,"No. No. No. The reason I give 1 star is you can get full for cheap, and there is a salad bar. The rest of the food offered is just mixing the same few ingredients together in different ways.",UNK
8075,Don't gamble here.  It's like your a little kid at a carnival and all the games are rigged.,UNK
8076,"Used a Groupon. Food was good, but menu items all seemed to have the same ingredients. Would suggest owners clean the restaurant a bit more, like the inside if the women's bathroom door had dirty hand print grime. Nice for a quick bite after a movie or while shopping.",UNK
8077,"overpriced, ceviche was decent, guacamole was good- also had chicken quesadillas which literally tasted like they had chicken in them from McDonald's (so gross!!!!)",UNK
8078,"The new Arby's beef gyros were really good. Of course its not the real gyro meat, but the tzatziki sauce makes it taste like the real thing.  Service was quick. Will come back again.",UNK
8079,"So, you don't HAVE to be a stoner to eat here, I think just to work here. The sandwiches are pretty deelish, the service is kinda slow (hmm, I wonder why?) Whatever, it is what it is, yummy sandwiches for lunch.",UNK
8080,Great service but food was ok sorry I won't be going again,UNK
8081,Really good food! And one if the few Chinese places where the staff smiles.. Good vibes ;),UNK
8082,90 min waiting it's too long for someone has an appointment \nI wish I can give them 0 for customer service,UNK
8083,"the food was good, but vastly overpriced. were it $2 or $3 cheaper a plate, it would have been a++.",UNK
8084,"A bit pricey. The sushi is standard, nothing mind blowing. The service is great though and if you check in you get free edamame. That's all I've got.",UNK
8085,Bottom line: Favorless. \nWishing Tokyo Sushi hadn't closed. Liking forward to the next endeavor. It can't be a lot worse than this. Looking for a happy ending. Suggestions?,UNK
8086,We went there with high hopes & but got disappointment.\nMany of the items had just rice with charred vegetables without any spice. Even meat items had no taste. We felt it too costly for the quality we got.\nDesserts were okay.,UNK
8087,"I must be a fan. This is the only place I go to get our water bottles filled. Real nice layout, plenty of facets for 5 gal bottles, friendly staff + ice cream. What isn't there to like.",UNK
8088,"A comfortable, quiet dining area is a welcome change from the everyday experience.  The staff is helpful and ready to make you comfortable and satisfied whether you are a practicing vegan or just experimenting.",UNK
8089,Really impressed with the service and selection. They have a system where you turn an egg on the top of the table to notify the staff if you need help!,UNK
8090,My son loves this place. A great standby too-cold-out place to spend the day with the kids.,UNK
8091,"The store was very clean and well stocked. The womens restroom smelled nice as I walled by, but the mens room was nasty.",UNK
8092,"Some pretty nice things in here.  However with the store just opening not a single sales associate said hi or, as we walked past the main checkout area again no greetings.  Not off to a great start.",UNK
8093,Not a bad place to go but not my first choice. The food is good but nothing unique or special.,UNK
8094,"Great service, tons of fake body parts. No parking.",UNK
8095,Grade: F\n\nThis place sucks ass. I am not the only one who thinks that either. Nuff said.,UNK
8096,"The beignets were disappointing. The entrees were amazing, though, and the cornbread to die for!",UNK
8097,Thank you.,UNK
8098,We've gone here 3 times now and they keep getting worse.  The last time was take out and when we got home the order was totally wrong.,UNK
8099,ummm i wish they had more classes for the beginner...\n\nthis dance studio is very clean and great instructors.\nbut i just don't like atmosphere in this studio.\ni would prefer they are more friendly...,UNK
8100,Food was nasty for a Vegas Buffet. The people were rude and demanded more money if we wanted to stay for dinner. Avoid it's not worth even if free. I'm never coming back.,UNK
8101,"Great beer selection.  They carry my favorite Belgian beer, Gulden Draak in bottles.  Also high points for unique character, independent ownership, positive support for local artists community groups and downtown Vegas culture.  Great place to meet friends and get acquainted with the Vegas Arts and #VegasTech scene.",UNK
8102,This place was not good.  Definitely not the place to be scene.  Not a good looking crowd.,UNK
8103,"We live in Paradise Valley and drive all the way to Sushi Ken for the best tasting Tempura udon and yummy rolls.  My kids also love their kids menu!  This place reminds me of the Japanese places we used to go to when we lived in San Jose, CA.",UNK
8104,"BWW has maintained its standard over the years I've been with them.  Classic sports bar look with great friendly service.  Although the kitchen messed up our order, but Tyler made a speedy recovery and provided excellent customer service.",UNK
8105,"Efficient and friendly service, excellent lunch specials, sushi was fresh and delicious. Recommend the Tarantula roll, and their California roll was best I've ever had (simple roll, excellently prepared).",UNK
8106,Overpriced. Greasy. Not good.  What wasn't greasy was too salty. My first and last experience with dim sum. I would have rather set my hard earned $$ on fire.,UNK
8107,"Terrible Pad Thai, smelled and tasted awful. The yellow curry was super runny and definitely not up to par with some of the other places around here. Very disappointed. Will not be returning.",UNK
8108,"SLOW service and not worth the long wait. The chicken is average and very salty. Culinary Dropout's fried chicken is better. Infact, KFC chicken is better than this joint.",UNK
8109,Excellent coffee. Cute little hole in the wall style cafe. Good service. Food menu fairly average and food is as expected - nothing to rave about.,UNK
8110,Place is not what I expected. Yes it's huge and nice inside but the food wasn't so good and the customer service was terrible. If I was I'm scottsdale I wouldn't consider this place at all. I love Italian food but this is a disappointment.,UNK
8111,Had some tacos on taco Tuesday yesterday and immediately got an upset stomach.  Woke up this morning and was in the bathroom more than once.  Don't think I'll be going back here unless I want to have the same brown issue.,UNK
8112,"$3 parking fee, and the valet has cones on every space. This is tantamount to a cover charge, and the food isn't THAT good.",UNK
8113,"Great food. Great conversation (Joe, get back to work), terrific value.",UNK
8114,"This place is tiny and cluttered and conveniently located in the atwater market. However the coffee beans are always fresh and not badly priced either. now if only they had certified organic beans, then there would be a fifth star.",UNK
8115,"This place is no longer Villa Francesca it is now Italian on 7th. All new menu with maybe two plain pasta dishes. They've decided to go \""upscale\"". Can't review the food because I didn't stay to try it.",UNK
8116,"Great place to stop in for a late night snack and escape the high prices of the strip.  It was very crowded when I went, but true to the fast food industry name, my order came out very quick.",UNK
8117,Avoid this place. Sushi was badly made every roll fell apart. Bad service very slow got our meal wrong twice. Stick with the Chinese menu if anything at all.,UNK
8118,Had the California burrito here. It was a burrito with French fries inside that was unique. Nothing outstanding but nice to mix it up if your tired of the average burrito.,UNK
8119,Stayed here on my recent trip. Housekeeping sucked. They didn't even change the sheets or clean the bathroom floors. The facilities are fine and the hotel itself is not bad otherwise.,UNK
8120,"Good pizza and friendly staff however, I'm not their boss but they always call me that.",UNK
8121,"Great and prompt service,; the food quality and presentation is excellent! Nice atmosphere in a European like setting. prices are reasonable.",UNK
8122,"Simple food that takes an extremely long time to arrive. We had the slowest service I can remember. Moreover, it was pretty crappy, unapologetic service. I'll never go back. It's simply not worth it.",UNK
8123,"I go to watch Grounded and Fred Green there. Drinks are decent and cold. One of those places you can't believe there's a cover charge. Like Mandi said, slumming without the risk.",UNK
8124,its del taco.  the food was alright but ive had better.. prices are higher which is a given. service was good. ehhh good place to get late night food or a quick cheaper lunch. =/,UNK
8125,A weird place with almost nothing in it. And all the stuff was smashed looking. What a bizarre place...,UNK
8126,"The service was outstanding. The food not so. My \""firecracker\"" (wontons fried with fillings) were so overcooked they were hard and like rubber, the burn taste ruined the meal. Good service and great coffee but I will stick with Macaroni Grill.",UNK
8127,"**Hotel room had a faulty Iron, destroyed my shirt, and they did not refund me or do anything about except replace my iron with a working one.\n\nWorst customer care of all time",UNK
8128,Awful. Luggage took over an hour to show up. The shuttle services are solely paid services (hotels do not provide free shuttles for their customers) and generally terrible. Use a taxi to get to your hotel!,UNK
8129,"Very average place. It seems to be a popular place for locals. But since spring training visitors bring some revenue to these places, you'd think we would get some better service. Average food too....everything here must come frozen.",UNK
8130,Oh how sad!  My husband has been talking and talking and talking about coming back for their falafels when we go back to Scottsdale for Spring Training in March.  Now I have to tell him the bed news...*tear.,UNK
8131,"Disappointing! Turned away without even trying after driving 25 minutes to try for the 1st time. It's 9:15, sign says close at 10p. \""We decided to close early today\"" #FalseAdvertising",UNK
8132,Good place to hang out and have beers with the guys. Your nightly little pizza buffet is a nice addition. Italian food here is bad but the pizza stands out,UNK
8133,"Way cheaper than the Art Java location on Mont Royal, but service and food are also a tad more basic. The wifi is much better however, even at peak hours (the Mont Royal location only offers a mediocre/erratic Ile Sans Fil wifi access).",UNK
8134,"had breakfast there. thought it was better than sitting in dusk inside. terrible eggs, artificial orange juice. expensive",UNK
8135,"My sisters and I voted, 7.5 out of 10. Decent sandwiches, very clean and good customer service.",UNK
8136,"when i first heard about this place on food network i gave it a try and it was good..but after that the 2-3rd time sucked, the food didn't taste the same and the price was pretty to high sorry burger bar but BLT at the mirage kicks your butt hands down",UNK
8137,Horrible. I don't even see how you people can think its good? I had once piece of California maki and almost puked. Their soups have no flavor and over priced one word horrid!,UNK
8138,"Acoustics are all right, but seats are not that comfortable.\n\nGood location, good selection of movies, but if you watch a late night movie it is very deserted.",UNK
8139,"Love the Urban Outfitters there, and found a perfect little dress at FCUK.\nOther than that, I thought it was a boring mall, and would go to Cesars Forum in a blast before this place.",UNK
8140,I really like the location of the hotel. However the rooms and service are just average and therefore overpriced for what you get. The rooms are not that clean and the bathrooms are not well designed. If the rooms were 50% cheaper I would recommend this place.,UNK
8141,"Wide variety of Asian styles.  Service experience at this location varies widely during lunch.  Food is consistent.  Patio great during day, impossible at dusk.",UNK
8142,"overall not bad, great portions for the price. pretty good, average food. def a great place for just a run of the mill type meal. \n\n(2 people 20 bucks, cant really complain)",UNK
8143,We tried this place based on all the Yelp reviews.  What a disappointment. I feel like I threw away $40. We got 3 rolls and none of them were good. Fish was subpar.  Don't believe the hype!,UNK
8144,Disappointing food for the price.  I've had better Jambalaya out of a box.   I had high expectations but was thoroughly underwhelmed.,UNK
8145,A fun novelty joint.   Reminded me of Detroit winters.   Even better when  you see drunk people vomit on the tables made of ice.,UNK
8146,Coffee is so so..do not order the frittata's! So weird that you have to microwave it yourself. And then its just bland. Also- no wi-fi???,UNK
8147,Had the Carne Asada Chilaquiles for late breakfast. Was delicious and filling! The restaurant was full so I sat on the bar and the hostess was nice and fast. Prices were ok!,UNK
8148,Long wait and poor service as well as over priced. Enjoy! Sushi was ok but not in anyway the best we have had. \n\nLarge sake is $44 each... Fun times..,UNK
8149,Pass....,UNK
8150,"Expensive and wouldn't let me check in. My husband and I went here to get a price check on tires and a wheel alignment, it was very expensive for just one tire. Sorry folks but I don't plan on coming back unless I strike it rich.",UNK
8151,Just okay vegetarian/vegan joint. I was disappointed with the atmosphere and for it being a veggie place it was quite greasy overall. I'd recommend it for a casual healthy-ish lunch.,UNK
8152,"Good local place (glad they moved away from the \""meat-market\""  Vig.  Usually always get the tots but I am an addict.  Food is comfort with some health thrown in and service is dependent upon who you wind up with but it is never bad.",UNK
8153,Just plain unprofessional!,UNK
8154,There are gas stations within a few miles of this particular location with cheaper prices.,UNK
8155,"Boba was good! But I do have to mention the ants crawling all around the inside of the \""pick up\"" window!! Ahh so gross",UNK
8156,"I am a little surprised this place has so many stars. I thought the food was pretty average. It was a good value for takeout but nothing special. I like the fact that they have such a large delivery area. Overall, I think Chopstick Express is better for the same style of food.",UNK
8157,"Great employees, Lobby and breakfast area where nice.  Good food,  but rooms need a serious renovation.  \n\nBut it's clean...",UNK
8158,Quick Service and you get a large quantity of food. I wish the lady behind the counter didn't have such a bad attitude. General tso tofu 4 life,UNK
8159,"Nice coffee shop but terrible lighting for studying unless you're sitting by the windows during the day.  If you're more in the mood to chill, talk or play a board game with friends you'll probably enjoy the atmosphere.  Oh, and the espresso is pretty decent too.",UNK
8160,I waited an hour for wings and fries. And when the food got here I wasn't impressed and the fries were soggy.,UNK
8161,"went into the dark bathroom\nflipped on the lights\nscurrying ROACHES, as in plural, ran into hiding\ni squealed\nwe left",UNK
8162,My family and I have been waiting for our food... 30mins! And there's only one other table- hate this place!,UNK
8163,"Very dated, small bathroom, tube TV\n\nBreakfast was good.",UNK
8164,"The food is all pretty greasy and a little overpriced. The Mexican pizza was pretty good if you're up for a heavy, grease-laden meal.",UNK
8165,It was pretty good diner food. I enjoyed it and looked at it for what it was. It is just like a lot of comfort food chains. It was good and The service was good. Good place to stop off to eat at. Exceptional Pancakes.,UNK
8166,one specific member lacked on customer service...  And for a starbucks employee I expected more. Its not busy yet it took awhile to receive just my Black tea.... Manager was polite and assisted with my short n simple order. But oh well I guess ... tsk tsk,UNK
8167,The slowest starbucks EVER! Really nice staff but no one here is in a hurry! Waited over 15 minutes in the drive thru! Stupid in my part and this is not the first time it's almost everytime you wait long wait times!,UNK
8168,I got my engagement ring sized and this happened. I received a ring that was a lot thinner and sharp. Now I have small cuts and extremely dry skin which I didn't have before. Sad face!,UNK
8169,"staff was very enthusiastic, but the food was highly overrated. nachos with pulled pork had no taste, pasta dish was mediocre, eggs was good. i would not go back even for happy hour deals.",UNK
8170,"Well I'm expecting more variety like lobster,tempura etc.Food taste good.but way to expensive for the price!!'",UNK
8171,"Good food, nice and relaxed atmosphere.",UNK
8172,"Worst customer service in existence!   It's kinda funny to see this in this day and age.   But,  if of don't mind the attitude the food is good.",UNK
8173,"Pedestrian and boring Thai food for the masses. If your idea of exotic is Pad Thai, then this is the place for you. No heat, no flavour, no imagination.\n\nServer lacked enthusiasm, obviously a common trend here throughout the restaurant.",UNK
8174,The location and patio are great but I had poor service. We had to go find our own napkins and silverware. Our waitress would disappear for long periods of time not refilling our drinks. The food took an hour to get out to us and was poorly put together. Overall I was disappointed.,UNK
8175,"The sushi is just barely above average.  The service from the wait staff is good, but the sushi chefs themselves border on rude.  Super inexpensive.  If you need a sushi fix, don't care about the service, and are poor, then this is for you.",UNK
8176,"Slowest Starbucks ever. When the line is 10 people deep, the barista still only makes one drink at a time. Try to avoid if you can.",UNK
8177,We made reservations on open table & drove here to find out that it was closed on a Saturday night.  We ended up eating at Sedona (2 minutes away) and had an excellent dining experience over there.   Wish I could give you ZERO STARS.,UNK
8178,"Worst place in the world, unless you want to wait an hour for a witch to draw your blood then go here.",UNK
8179,"The food was just OK.  Maybe that I am pretty much over Prime Rib, but this was just passable.  \n\nNice surroundings, and a great booth.",UNK
8180,Great place for a happy hour glass of wine.  Outside seating has a nice view of the lake.  The pizza shop next door will deliver to your table.,UNK
8181,"Very slow service in an empty restaurant, average food.",UNK
8182,"This is impressively tasteless. I adore Chinese food but this place is really unacceptable, not even mediocre.",UNK
8183,It's basically not worth the long waiting. It took me almost 90 min to get a table. The quality of food is less than average.,UNK
8184,"Over priced, ok pizza.  Nothing special.  I will not return",UNK
8185,"Can't really talk about much but the poor service. We walked out after 25 minutes without any. We even told the hostess we were headed to the showroom. She said she would tell our server. We never saw a server. Too bad, the menu looked interesting.",UNK
8186,"Mal organisado, no habia nada pregubte por pastelillos no habian pregunte por Sandwiches no habian y tampoco croquetas, Rolys es el mejor",UNK
8187,"Got this as a delivery while I was staying at the Sheraton in Madison.  I got a calzone and it basically sucked a$$.  My partner liked her pizza.  The salad was totally lame.  Lettuce, and a slice of cucumber.  Ive had much better.",UNK
8188,Excellent food best gyro in town! The gyro platter is fantastic as well. The guy that takes the order is a so rude.  He makes me think twice about sating there. The restaurant itself is dirty and the seating really needs to be updated.,UNK
8189,"Pretty much met my expectations, which was quite low. The best thing was the bbq beef ribs, but I expect better quality and selection if I'm paying 20 bucks for dinner at a vegas buffet.",UNK
8190,"Location-wise it's a good location, the staff is usually friendly and the selection is pretty good. Although the sales section tends to be more expensive for the same things than other Urban outfitters I have been to.",UNK
8191,This place is now called Gelato Spot and doesn't open until 3 PM.,UNK
8192,Stains in the carpets. Fixtures falling off the wall and a big green line through the Freaken TV overall this place is a ratchet shithole. No wonder Paris Hilton sold this piece  of shit hotel before everything fell apart on her.,UNK
8193,Horrible!!!  better Mexican food at the pool area of the Flamingo  a real disappointment  Food  and Margaritas are the worst I ever had.,UNK
8194,"Good food served by a nice, friendly staff. I'm glad they are in my neighborhood. I wish they had potato salad, though...",UNK
8195,"I'm adding another star, because the owner, Howard, has really gone out of his way to make things right. To the point that I'm willing to give them another shot. Hopefully, after that, I'll be able to add more stars.",UNK
8196,"Hubby and I dropped in after a hellish morning at the Social Security office. Hubby loves pizza so we made a stop.\n\nPizza wan't bad, it was actually pretty decent. But the place was disgusting and the cashier was incredibly rude.",UNK
8197,I'm sitting in here right now trying to work and they are blasting Glenn Beck super loud. Ay yi yi. Time to leave.,UNK
8198,Decided to try this place for after dinner drinks with wifey. They have a good selection of brews and an overall cool place to hang out.  Didn't have a chance to check out the food menu. Place is worth a visit for drinks or just hanging out.,UNK
8199,"Quiet and subdued spot for breakfast, although the vibe was hurry up and finish. Check arrived unbidden, plates removed at the earliest moment. They should invest in tea cozies to keep it hot for the second cup.",UNK
8200,"This is the worst food I have had in Phoenix. I went here on a whim with a friend, seeking japanese food. I am not even sure what they served me. Terrible. Do not go here.",UNK
8201,Over priced and under filling. A $9 salad shouldn't be 95% lettuce. Save your money for somewhere else. Their saving grace is the beer.,UNK
8202,"Stopped into Gigi's yesterday, won't be going back anytime soon.. \n\nCupcakes look and taste like they been on the display shelves for days as the cake and frosting appeared to be on the VERY dry side..",UNK
8203,"WARNING: DO NOT STAY HERE!\n\nBad customer service and very small rooms and bathrooms.\nMotel 6 converted, no one should charge 100+ for a ill designed room.",UNK
8204,"I'm giving this place 1 star because I just walked in with my mother n daughter asked for the all-u-can eat and the waiter says \""make sure you cannot share anything\""...no shit Sherlock....",UNK
8205,"The food is delicious but this place is probably not the best place to come if you only have an hour for lunch and don't want to feel rushed. Service was nice too, it was busy and took a bit for the food to come out. I'd go again.",UNK
8206,Rude driver speeds down narrow streets radio so loud he can't even tell his boss is calling him to straighten him out. If that's how they represent themselves I will take my business elsewhere.,UNK
8207,"Nice and clean, service is great, noodles were just ok. Don't get me wrong they were made fresh, you can watch the guy making them in the window. I guess I had really high expectations. I would however recommend it and I will return.",UNK
8208,"Poutine was cold and disgusting , server was nice",UNK
8209,1 star is giving this company an apartment complex too many stars!! Horrible people that run this company - DO NOT LIVE THERE!!!! There are so many other better apartments in Charlotte to choose from - better prices too!,UNK
8210,"Not too bad, good prices, food was quick fish and chips. I've had better, I've a lot worse too..so middle of the road for me..but I left full :-)",UNK
8211,"From the stale peanuts at the beginning of the line where it starts. Then for $13 bucks, forget it. I can eat for same price for two people and be IN and OUT burger",UNK
8212,Food is decent but service sucks! Also a bit pricey!,UNK
8213,more of the same.  the staff turns over every few months.  the sushi never tastes very fresh relative to places like Pure.  lots of scottsdale attitude for a place barely surviving from bankruptcy.  have you been on a weeknight? how,UNK
8214,Awful pancakes! \nI love pancakes and these were nearly inedible.  The first batch came out undercooked and had to send back \nSecond batch was just gross. \nWill never go back again.,UNK
8215,Very bland food with hardly any seasoning. The waitress was very rude to us and it took ages for someone to take our order. Beer was good.,UNK
8216,Poor customer service ruined an otherwise decent breakfast.,UNK
8217,Leckeres Esssen. Pizza auch zum Abholen. Eine Institution in R\u00fcppurr,UNK
8218,"Weak, overpriced and lacking quality.  My bloody maria tasted like plastic. I had extremely high hopes for this place esp since the space/location are perfect.   I would just rather drive an extra ten minutes and get a taco from Casa Rasta",UNK
8219,"In 3 words: Not worth it. \nThe patties were store bought and the price, outlandish considering. Honestly, you may as well go across the street to the 5 Guys.",UNK
8220,It's a pretty good breakfast place. Kind of like Denny's and their service there is alright. It's more of a good rest stop type of diner than a family friendly diner.,UNK
8221,"The burrito I had was way too expensive, small, and bland. If you like burritos, don't get one here.",UNK
8222,We were literally in light one hour ago and when we left to meet a group of friends that couldn't get in. They wouldn't let us in. Worst case of customer service. I would rather walk up and down the stairs of Hakkasan a thousand times before going back in light.,UNK
8223,I made a quick stop here to get some lunch and talk to the owner/manager. Unfortunately the manager was really rude. Opted to not have lunch there and won't bother to go back with all of the other reviews.,UNK
8224,"This location is just a faux SB, it's run by the supermarket it's located in and you can tell.  THey don't take SB gift cards and the staff is rude and make terrible drinks.",UNK
8225,Tight and cramped tables so close together that you can touch your neighbor! Pizzas are terrific along with some great deals for happy hour.\nIf you can sit at the bar...do it! Nice local place but it really needs more space to accommodate patrons comfortably...,UNK
8226,Chicken Katsu was horrible. Over cooked & massive fatty chicken yuck.,UNK
8227,"Honestly, going here on a Saturday night was a completely normal experience. Beau was looking for a case for his phone- and while we left empty handed, it was not crowded and someone helped us the second we got in the door. No complaints here.",UNK
8228,"I know it depends who you get, but this is worst hospital service ever. It took they forever or non when I push help button.",UNK
8229,"What's so great about this place? This seems to be the only pho place Vegas people go to. Always busy, but the food isn't even that great. Shame!",UNK
8230,Really rude on the phone. Hope she's nicer to the pets.,UNK
8231,Perfectly fine terminals. Small but clean and well staffed. Love Jet Blue.,UNK
8232,No gym. \n\nRoom wasn't clean. \n\nA lot of street noise. \n\nBut great location.,UNK
8233,"We have been regulars at Chop since it opened. There have been a few changes recently, but Christine behind the bar was delightful and one of the main reasons we continue to visit. The GM seems to be rather unfriendly and a bit chaotic. We hope they figure it out.",UNK
8234,Went there on a dinner date with the hubby we both ordered lamb shank. Well somehow mine was not well cooked and lets just say I had food poisoning after that. Enough said,UNK
8235,"After a couple hours of browsing and a coffee, a visit to the restroom was necessary.\n\nI've been to cleaner restrooms at truck stops!  This place was disgusting!  Not sure what the management thinks about a cleaning schedule, but it clearly wasn't a priority.",UNK
8236,"Had the crab cakes. .  Mistake. .  Dry,  not much flavor. . Worse,  the rice and plantains were baked to the point that it was a dry lump with burned wood flavor",UNK
8237,"We decided to try this place for a nice Saturday afternoon lunch! I was very disappointed with my burger. It lacked any type of flavor. However, Kevin really enjoyed his chicken & dumplings. I probably won't try it again with all the other great restaurants in the area.",UNK
8238,We were going to try Olive's last night but found they have gone out of business.,UNK
8239,Great if you want to spend $18 to see lots and lots and lots of cactus.,UNK
8240,"The good service and cleanliness cannot overcome overcooked and stringy lobster and king crab legs. First time, last time.",UNK
8241,There are days when the line at Starbucks is just too long and I need caffine - this place has it!\n\nPretty decent coffee and fresh pastries.\n\nService is quick.,UNK
8242,"Pleasant, good service, and reasonably priced. Enjoyed the shrimp chow mein (soft noodles).",UNK
8243,BOOOO!!!! Costco did away with the $1.58 chocolate dipped  almond covered ice cream in the cafeteria.,UNK
8244,"Fajita were ok but the pizza was terrible. Atmosphere is good and they try, food just isn't spectacular.",UNK
8245,"Ok, food ok, service poor. This place is more for a beer than a meal.",UNK
8246,"Stand up live posted they would contact me on Facebook regarding not allowing me in with a valid ticket, purchased from their window \nThey blocked me instead \nWhat a great business nice \nPoor service poorly ran very upsetting to deal with !!! Stay away from this venue",UNK
8247,"Ok, not a bad place at all.  I usually stick to appetizers. The portions  are large and enough  for 2 to share.  Fairly fast service and decent prices.",UNK
8248,I was in Las Vegas this week and the restaurant has been closed. It's kind of the pits....  I saw the Restaurant Impossible show and I planed to visit the place for breakfast.,UNK
8249,The food here is just ok. I have had the ravioli and was not very impressed. The garlic bread is very good and the meat lovers pizza is very good. Overall a cheap italian dinner but not a regular place for us.,UNK
8250,Standing at customer service desk to ask a question where I'm being ignored and the phone rings. She actually picked up the phone and hung it back up without answering it. Epic fail in the customer service department.,UNK
8251,"Good food, good live music, good service & good prices.\nTry the hot dog with your beer, you wont be disappointed.",UNK
8252,"No parking, rude staff, equipment often broken, sauna almost never works",UNK
8253,I'm Filipino and I am picky about my food and I found that this place was just all right. I've had better food at different places. It was a bit over priced for the food portions they have.,UNK
8254,Service is very nice.  The cooking though is uneven.  The dishes we had during our first and second visits were very good.  Our third visit was not as good.,UNK
8255,I tried to substitute tomatoes for onions and they charged me 59 cent!  They are nickel and dining me... must be struggling,UNK
8256,"Even though they were featuring really great discounts, I found the stuff at this store to be not of the same quality as the regular Bebe store. Everything in the store reminded of stuff you'll find at Forever 21 stores which is not a good thing.",UNK
8257,Simple decor (reminds me of something from the 80s). Sat center at first row but we were the 4th seat back from stage (about as close as is comfortable). Saw Rob Schneider and felt close to the action. They have several bars inside (no outside booze allowed).,UNK
8258,Terrible service and the food was cold when it got to the table. Severely disappointing. Not nearly the same experience as it was a few years ago. Lots of other good places nearby,UNK
8259,Not magical.,UNK
8260,"This place is great... If you like over-priced drinks, not having a server, and listening to the douchiest karaoke host on the planet (particularly the guy on November 30, 2014).",UNK
8261,They finally got it right and no more problems.,UNK
8262,be nice if their food was actually made by the Asians and not store bought.....,UNK
8263,Watery bloody and slow service. Terrible management.,UNK
8264,"Unfortunately, this location is going out of business. I have been going here for years. It's not a huge location, but they have a decent location.",UNK
8265,"\""Meh\"" pretty much says it all. And not even a cheap \""meh\"" at that. Kinda cool atmosphere, high prices, unexceptional food and passable service. Why bother?",UNK
8266,"Since it's pricey here, I just get the kids meal. The burger is pretty much the same size as the all American. The fried pickles are pretty good. I would rather go to IN n OUT though.",UNK
8267,"I hate CVS, their store layouts drive me nuts, that alone keeps me from going back. I know petty. lol",UNK
8268,"JULY 4TH WEEKEND it cost $79.99 plus tax for the pass, crazy",UNK
8269,"Not bad, not great. Really nice people work here, service was super quick. Portions were small, the taste of the rolls weren't that out of the world. Normal. Not worth the price, though.",UNK
8270,Love the free wi-fi and the fly by lanes in terminal 4.\nI'll probably bump up my review once all the new food choices get in!,UNK
8271,"SCAM! Do NOT order from here. They took my money, never delivered the cheesecake, and just stopped responding to my messages. When I reported that incident to my bank, they said they delivered on time. After reading this, I am completely shocked that it happened to others, too.",UNK
8272,Awful service. Brought me my check before I received any food.,UNK
8273,Nothing interesting there. Recommended for people that are into country and mature.,UNK
8274,The dudes who work here are too busy being rad to be bothered with customers.  The staff at Bicycle Haus is much more friendly and helpful.,UNK
8275,Food was okay.  Balding manager didn't greet us at door. All the employees seemed absolutely miserable there-especially the manager.  What a depressing mood in this place.,UNK
8276,"I ate here 2 times. I will not be back. Food took a long time to come, the bread was dried and cracking. My wife had a beef dip that tasted a week old. I tried it twice and the food & service was bad.  You lost me as a customer!",UNK
8277,"They have some great harder-to-find packaged items (melon bars - yes, please!), but they sold us a whole bagful of ROTTEN purple yams!!  What?!  We got home and started preparing them before we figured it out. GROSS.",UNK
8278,Worse club ever. They advetisted  free drinks for ladies but was not true then once got inside there was nobody in there. Dance floor was empty.  Go somewhere else,UNK
8279,"Closed?  Someone tell the Sweet Tomatoes Marketing department.  I got the flyer in the mail today 12/31/14, and that location is still listed.  Sad....",UNK
8280,Ehh. Ok. Cool views from outside,UNK
8281,Boyfriend and I used to go in here for the great drinks and food but lately we have been getting horrible customer service and staff was not very friendly till we started flashing money. I understand you work for tips but we shouldn't have to throw you money just to get a refill.,UNK
8282,"good food...i remember getting the rabbit, that was pretty yummy.",UNK
8283,"It is a shame to called this place Vietnamese food. Rice is not cooked properly, meat is too dried, Pho is too sweet. Dont expect authenticfood here. However, the customer service was friendly tho. I'd give a star for that.",UNK
8284,The grand cafe has been a hit and miss type place for me at the sunset station.I did not want to try it here but the buffet had a long line. Eggs Benedict was great! The poached eggs where really not that poached but It was good.,UNK

8297,Changed owners and the name. Epic fail! Prices have almost doubled as has the wait time.,UNK
8298,Ugh.  Not my kinda place.  Just a bunch of chain stores and restaurants.,UNK
8299,I have to add this: on more than one occasion we've seen the cooks handling buns right after touching raw meat without washing hands or changing gloves. NOT SAFE!,UNK
8300,"A simple request, salt. Never got. Waiter never came back to check on us after the food was serverd. A simple courteous long time practice. This place is too busy for me. I felt like an orphan. In thier defense, food was excellent.",UNK
8301,No Buena ! \nRice was okay and chips were okay.\nI won't be returning \nMade me sick all night  ;(,UNK
8302,"I do not recommend this spa! I got a groupon, which is why I went. It's small, not very clean, and not worth it. I was very disappointed. It feels more like a gym locker room. Go to another spa!",UNK
8303,This place was okay.  It was very dificult to make an appointment and when I finally did it wasnt worth the trouble. My hair didnt turn out how I wanted even though they went back and redid it,UNK
8304,Average..The Hotel is a dump I wish they had more standalone locations in Las Vegas Hopefully the will get a locations near Nellis AFB!!,UNK
8305,What a disappointment. Good Memories of Gyro Time on W. Charleston have all faded. Gyro Time was once tasty. Now just serving overpriced calories with a bad attitude.,UNK

8309,Gonna keep this really simple because I'm tired. Bad food. End of story!,UNK
8310,They have been harassing me for month about paying for tests on my cat that I didn't authorize. I changed vets a while ago because the first experience I had was a good one but every other after as been horrible.  I won't ever go back.,UNK
8311,Not overly impressed just average. Pre packages potatoes & hash browns  nice atmosphere  gd waiting staff seemed well organized.,UNK
8312,This place is in my neighborhood and I decided to support a local business instead of going to a chain like Little Caesar's or something. The pizza was mediocre and the price was high. Perfect. The veggies on my pizza were basically raw and the sauce did not taste good.,UNK

8320,"This place is clearly priced for the location, which is near a lot of places. Staff was kind. Random drilling and sawing at 6am kinda ruined the experience.",UNK
8321,Nothing urgent about it - only go if there's no other options.,UNK

8329,Its ok but I never seem to enjoy myself when I am here. I would rather drink at home.,UNK

8333,"Met friends here for dinner a week ago. Staff was friendly, place was clean, and the food was good.",UNK

8335,"Took our guests from Ohio to see this unique place, and we wanted to see it too. We waited over 45 minutes and no one showed to open the gates. Very under managed and disorganized. We left to see other sites, could not wait all day!!",UNK

8337,Came here for a mani and pedi... Waiting in the spa chair for 45 minutes and I walked out! Very low staffed... Run down! Stay away!,UNK
8338,A pricy place in the airport. However we liked the club salad. And they turned it over fast for us. Good lookin' beer selection too.,UNK
8339,"Customer service here is the worst!  Don't even bother ordering ahead of time because they won't have your order, or any record of your order.. Although I really like the food here, I won't be back.  2 strikes is all it takes for me,",UNK

8341,"This place is now closed. It's open as a different Thai place, but I have no idea if there is any relation",UNK
8342,"Sport Chalet only gets two stars from me because they do not carry ammunition which I was looking for on Saturday. I must say though, the staff was very friendly. The gentleman I spoke to did not hesitate to refer me to Dicks Sporting Goods. I appreciate the honesty and lack of excuses.",UNK
8343,No Senior Discount.  Small drink  .25 . Supposed to be free.,UNK
8344,"Very cool - LOL The whole place is made up of ice - walls, bars, decorations, sculptures, seating, table - yes fairly cold. It was worth the extra money to go with the package that included the fur coat, hat (that you keep) and drink.",UNK
8345,"Small, smelly, and an embarrassment for a SkyClub.",UNK
8346,This place sucks. They charge for korean hot tea. Charge tip % of 4 or more.  Charge for refill on side dishes of 3 or more. Crap!!!,UNK

8350,The sub was amazing and if I would have had just that I would have given 5 stars but I also got a salad to share with my daughter and it was brown and disgusting. We asked for a new one and that one was brown as well. So stick to subs at this place!,UNK
8351,Horrible place. Staff was unfriendly. Room was stinking. Bad deal and a horrible hotel.,UNK

8355,"Overcooked rice, cold chicken. Do not recommend. When i approached cook would only microwave which in turn, dried out rest of food. Caveat emptor.",UNK
8356,They cut our 2 year old's hair and did a decent job. I don't think it's that much different than going anywhere else except the kids can sit in a Lightning McQueen car and watch a movie while they get their hair cut.,UNK
8357,7 min before a server came to our table ...ill update once I actually get my food ...if I ever do,UNK
8358,AWFUL!!!!  Very unorganized.....does not deserve the one star,UNK
8359,"Scottsdale Mountainside has it down when it comes to customer service, towels and keys. Scottsdale also has a cabinet that keeps your keys by number at front desk, try it. Also, stuck up staff is not a good look.",UNK

8362,Bad salty greasy chicken... But the staff is nice!,UNK
8363,Sushi and burger don't mix!,UNK
8364,Eh pizza is alright. Not a crazy fan of but it could also be because they took AN HOUR to deliver when we are 5 mins away.,UNK
8365,"Delightful commercial coffee shop.  Close to McGill, pleasantly staffed, good solid cup of coffee or mixed espresso drink.  This second cup is my Go-To place before hitting the campus to visit friends.",UNK
8366,More of a country style goodwill but its cool had what I need for cheap,UNK
8367,The drinks are amazing!! But the places so bad from smoking and being old... its kinda a trade off.... I would go back if a group of friends were going but I wouldn't make it a point to want to go there with just me and the hubby!,UNK

8373,poor service,UNK
8374,Room was clean but that's as positive as I can be.  Very little water pressure in the shower.  Tiny soap bars. Only 2 towels.  No tv channels to speak of.  The casino and midway smelled horrible.  Very out dated will definitely go back to our regular spots on Fremont Street!,UNK
8375,"This location has lower ceilings than the others and the neon lights make the place feel a little clubby instead of a serious gym, but at it's heart it's like any other location... classes are good, equipment is adequate, staff is present (not necessarily attentive).",UNK

8378,Horrible experience. Bacon...cold and old.  Pancakes dense and hard.  Potatoes deep fried and extremely salty. Please go somewhere else. Their food is NOT good.,UNK
8379,We usually come here for Sunday Brunch. Most of the times the food and service is pretty good. This time however the service was terrible and our food was cold and biscuits were burnt and hard. We sat for 5 minutes without a place setting and nothing to eat our food with.,UNK
8380,Very good food.  They just moved locations across the street to the old seesaw location. Good food can't really choose a bad item however the atmosphere is very ho hum.,UNK
8381,Food is really average....we ordered sausage shrimp rice fry and yes my dish comes with 2 shrimp.....if u have living social deal then worth a try otherwise go somewhere else,UNK
8382,Food took forever.\nPeople working there just seemed annoyed that people were there. Waitress making annoyed sounds and gestures to people behind their back. No good.,UNK
8383,This place has tanked. They half fix something and mess up something else so you go back to them a few days later.  Avoid like the plague. Never again.,UNK
8384,Not great. $20. for a med. 3 topping pizza that had a crust that was charred black on the bottom. Dominos would have been a better choice. MUCH BETTER!,UNK
8385,hour and 15 when it said 15-20. Pizza was old and not hot at all.,UNK

8390,Crowded. Overpriced. Men checking ID's in the front have literally denied my friends who are DEFINITELY older than 21.,UNK
8391,was a regular for a while. Over time found the friendliness from the staff to be a bit of an act. Zombie hipsters. Long wait.,UNK
8392,"Almost thought I walking into Pipers Pub at first, and the place sure looks like just that. Stopped by on a Thursday evening and place was somewhat busy. We got served right away. They have a decent draft beer selection,  and the subs we had were alright. Service was good!",UNK

8394,sushi was ok. the fish was decently fresh but the service was not that great.,UNK
8395,I am surprised I don't love this place. I love sweets but the cake bites are actually too sweet for me. The cookies are good but the stuff is overpriced. We have tried the cupcakes as well but I was underwhelmed. Not my favorite.,UNK

8402,"Got myself al pastor and tripas , and they were pretty good , but never compared to the tacos el gordo from Tijuas.....I will recommend still , but be prepared to spend above average",UNK
8403,"Great atmosphere and food, but our lunch (two salads and a roasted chicken sandwich) took almost two hours. They didn't seem to care either, I'm just sayin.",UNK
8404,I don't think you press some white processed substance into a 9 iron shape and call it shrimp. Can someone send this to a lab or something? I need to know what I ate!!,UNK
8405,"Food is good, always a wait even at 3am. Service is pretty friendly for being a place that busy. The only thing so far we don't like about this place is the calamari, it is to damn oily.",UNK

8407,"Eh, I have reviewed the one on Sahara and have gone there twice.  This one, I do not know why, left a lot to be desired. The staff is different, the food was not that good, and it definitely did not have the usual Hash House a Go-Go atmosphere.",UNK

8409,"The service was terrible. I could hear the servers in their service station all huddled together cussing loud enough for me to hear. Not very classy. Needless to say the food was good, but you can get great meals anywhere in this city. Service is what sets it apart. Not a fan",UNK

8414,"I am not sure why this theater is still open.  It requires a total overhaul.  I went for a show and I was turned off.  The place was very dirty, my shoe stuck to the floor, it smelled and I was bitten by a mosquito.  I do not recommend this place.",UNK
8415,"Pretty bad service. We were rushed through the entire meal, yet had to forage around other tables for napkins and silverware.",UNK

8425,These people were so rude! No regard for patient confidentiality whatsoever. I was treated as if I were a second-class citizen. I walked out.,UNK
8426,This was a good family show. And for the price I would recommend it. My 4 year old loved all the animals. Although the pets weren't trained very well it was overall a good show to see if you have kids,UNK
8427,"I was really excited to see the show but walked out of the theater underwhelmed.   So far, this is my least favorite show; even the guy next to me fell asleep during the show.  I felt the performers were holding back and afraid to go all out.",UNK

8436,This place was so dirty it made me sick.  If I would have stayed more than ten minutes I would have needed a shower.  Has a health inspector actually signed off on this retched place?,UNK
8437,The food was great! A tad bit pricy! I have never felt so rushed to dine though! Glasses were taken away before drinks were finished and rolls came out at the same time as cocktails! Also really loud that we could hardly hear our server speak!,UNK

8446,"Good, clean pizza/bar place.  Numero Uno pizza is the way to go and they have a decent amount of beers on tap.  Wait staff is nice and friendly.  \n\nThis is a chain, so you know exactly what to expect every time.  Good consistency.",UNK
8447,"Its ok. I've visited at least 10 times. Service has been slow every time, no matter time of day. Food is mediocre at best, and I can get beer any where. There are very good alternatives very close by that suit my tastes better.",UNK

8461,I've eaten here twice now.  Both times food was very good but service lacked a little.  Very young staff and not knowledgable of the menu or timing.  It's a good place to go if you are with people who aren't huge sushi fans.,UNK
8462,Nothing Special!,UNK
8463,"Good place. I think all the meat products are from humane or organic farms...guess they make all their own sauces. Not as good as Shake Shack but seems like \""cleaner\"" burgers and dogs.",UNK

8466,Worst goodwill In south Charlotte!!!  Store is smaller than most. Trashy....always a mess. Employees have nonchalant attitude.,UNK
8467,Was not all the impressed by their dishes.  The one dish that stood out was the fried oysters. The XO string bean and fried rice were mediocre. Their seafood looked very good unfortunately they had run out of rock fish cod.,UNK
8468,It's seriously just a grass field. Surrounded by homeless people. Not a fan at all. Plus in the summer there is zero shade anywhere. Not on the field or parking.,UNK
8469,"The other location off I-17 & Happy Valley is WAY better. This one was blah. I had ribs, they were ok. They were out of mashed potatoes......If you want better service and better quality go to the other location.",UNK
8470,"was good for the price, quiet...  poor service",UNK
8471,The show wasn't worth the money I paid for. It had it's moments but again it was the lousiest show I went to in Vegas so far and I've been to 4. Also they overcharged me and did not want to refund my money.,UNK
8472,Nasty,UNK
8473,"Very disappointed with amount they assigned to goods was so shocked I literally did not refuse payment but went back to make sure they had given full credit ,still don't believe they did check all items. Will never consign there again.",UNK
8474,"Low quality ingredients, terrible powder hot chocolate, lukewarm coffee, and all overpriced. Not worth it. This isn't the same Sugar Factory from three-four years ago.",UNK
8475,"Pretty decent food, popular with the older community. Service is hit and miss. Not a fan of the salsa, very tomatoey not enough kick.",UNK
8476,We haven't been impressed with the donuts here. They are much more doughy than we like and the maple icing on the maple bar doesn't have much flavor. We've definitely had better donuts elsewhere.,UNK
8477,"Not good at all!  Two beer selections on tap, and only one bottle of the beer I decided on in the entire place.  The meal was fatty and not tender.  We overheard a server mention that it was under new management, but that was over a year ago.  This place needs help.",UNK
8478,So disappointed NoRTH closed.,UNK
8479,Terrible service.  Decent appetizers.  Main courses were mediocre.,UNK
8480,If you are doing business with Mansions on Fifth you must make sure you get paid in advance.  They will stiff you.  They do not pay their bills.,UNK
8481,I didn't eat here. The rating is because of the rudeness of the staff. I guess they figure if they're busy that night they don't need to be polite to other potential customers. Just average politeness would be appreciated.,UNK
8482,"Lights were nice, we liked the walk with the Christmas trees. But $11 admission + $3 rides was pretty steep. I guess it was nice to see but I won't come back next year.",UNK
8483,"Food is good, but portions are small, and it is ridiculously priced",UNK
8484,Went there several times for buffet. They only have maybe 10 selections of fried dishes and some desserts that look old. \nHaven't tried anythin else there.,UNK
8485,Wanted to try this place since it's around the corner from where my boyfriend lives. The quality and service was on par with Denny's. In other words I've had better.,UNK
8486,Instead of asking how he can make my experience better ...the manager just belittles my post and says I was advertising his competition...I was just being honest DO NOT BUY FROM THESE GUYS!,UNK
8487,Nope. Went for dinner tonight. The place was dirty. The sushi was very poor quality and now my husband has food poisoning. The sushi was on par with what you buy from a grocery store. Oh and there was a hair on our menu. Gross. Go to Yen's!,UNK
8488,The place present itself has a Japanese pub and I did enjoy my meal there. Having been to a few authentic ones in Japan I felt a bit underwhelm... still a nice addition to the restaurant scene in Montreal.,UNK
8489,The wait time for an appointment is ridiculous. Been waiting over an hour and a half for my scheduled appointment time. These people do not value patients time,UNK
8490,"It was good but nothing spectacular. I ordered Pho noodles with beef and meat balls. Also, shrimp spring roll. The food came out really quick!",UNK
8491,"While I will continue to eat at this establishment, I will only do so because it is the closet Chicago food place near my work, otherwise I would completely avoid this place due to its outrageous pricing. There are better tasting and cheaper options all over the valley.",UNK
8492,"I think if I had to pick between overpriced Nathan's and overpriced Bonanno's, Bonanno's wins. I couldn't go to McDonald's next door out of principle, but I was sorely tempted.",UNK
8493,Overpriced food and just OK service. They have a denny's downstairs..maybe a better bet..,UNK
8494,"The Brussell spouts side dish was to die for. Everything else was just \""okay\"". I don't think I would go here again. Too many other amazing restaurants at The Bellagio to enjoy an expensive meal.",UNK
8495,Good food and great ambiance.  Quaint little place.  Great spot to stop at when you are done walking around the capitol for the Farmers Market.  Madison excels at breakfast so I can't say this is the best place but its worth a try.,UNK
8496,"The place was dead, but the dining area was a mess.  The few staff members I saw were clearly not interested in their jobs.",UNK
8497,I had the special (a chicken sandwich) and it was okay.  I've only been once and it seemed a little pricey...but I could be wrong.  I will probably head back sometime though.  Good place to play Trivia on Tuesday.,UNK
8498,We had a $75 food and beverage credit during our stay at the Signature so we ate here twice.  The sandwich was pricey considering they were more bread than anything else and did not taste that good.  Earl of Sandwich is a million times better.,UNK
8499,"Doesn't this place know the medical office is only as good as it's front office. How can you charge someone a $ 40 copay if the insurance plan doesn't have a copay even though you accept the insurance plan. That's fraud, waste and abuse.",UNK
8500,"Poor service, bad menu, and worse food. It's no wonder the UK is not known for their food. A disappointing dinner experience. Never again!",UNK
8501,You pay 5 bucks for a cup of coffee you are expecting a certain level of quality.  It's coffee not to complicated.  Over the last 3 days this place has proven it makes crap coffee. It's very dirty.,UNK
8502,Food quality has diminished. Need to make a small investment & purchase some new table place mats to replace the worn/ratty ones.,UNK
8503,worst experience in vegas. i was robbed there. waitress charge you way more than they should and strippers lie to you. i used my card to buy drinks there and they charged me 3 different values for that. dont recommend this place to anyone,UNK
8504,Why is the service so slow? We never had so much wait with any other rentals in any other place. This was my first and last time renting a car with them. Still waiting :(,UNK
8505,"Met up with friends on a Saturday night, so it was packed. Later in the night the number of children dropped. For something out of the ordinary, it's a good time but a but a bit expensive.",UNK
8506,The food was not all that.  The customer service was just okay. Don't get what all the rave is about??,UNK
8507,"Great potential, could have been a 4 star, the food was good, the deviled egg appetizer was excellent, the wait for food and drinks was sooooooooooo loooooooooong, oh yeah and they were out of soco",UNK
8508,"Don't let the name fool you, this place is definitely more tex-mex than Mexican. The margaritas are strong and the food is tasty (regardless of its authenticity). Our waiter was really friendly and was on top of our empty glasses throughout lunch.",UNK
8509,"I agree. They are very very slow. I went there one time and I shall not return. I waited in line for about 20 minutes, and this was the drive thru. Not sure what the problem was, but it needs to be rectified.",UNK
8510,"The buns of the burgers where cold, burger had no taste. The fries tasted like crap. The lady in the front got my sisters order wrong. You are better off going to McDonalds",UNK
8511,"Went there once and will not ever go back again since they don't have a lot of food selections.  One good thing about the buffet is that you get to choose your own ice creams by scooping it yourself, but other than that, I think I'll pass.",UNK
8512,Terrible service. The water tastes like dirt.,UNK
8513,"I'll be back for the view and a drink. Unfortunately, the entrees were average and the service was awful! A good place to go when you are looking for a fun time! But, definitely don't attend when you want to impress with good food and drinks, choose else where!",UNK
8514,Dirty dishes and cold food......awful I would neve visit again...the whole staff need to be Re-trained. ..,UNK
8515,Wish I'd read some previous reviews before I went here. If there isn't an event in the area go someplace else. Food was OK. If you want dinner in an empty warehouse this is the place to go. Service was OK but not great.,UNK
8516,While the desk guy Peter in Santa Barbara was amazingly helpful the rest of the experience sucked. Flights late on the way in. Flight canceled on the way out and I had to find my own way to a different airport to get home.,UNK
8517,Was not impressed with the menu... Closer to overpriced bar food. Was not at all what I expected. Service was good and I was able to make reservations online.,UNK
8518,"We sat on the 200's section.\nThere was a roof blocking part of the show.\nNo close up big screens.\nNothing special about the stage decoration. \nWast of money, and I am a Britney Spears fan.",UNK
8519,"I've been 2 times here and both had a good ending. I enjoy what I order, which is mainly sushi and some of their pasta dishes. Good service and nice environment.",UNK
8520,Same great food. Same unimpressive service.,UNK
8521,"Wow. Completely disappointed. I had the commuter. When did English muffins lose their crispness, holes and flavor. Not impressed at all.",UNK
8522,"Our I pad was stolen out of our room by a staff member! Nice place, but we are out a 400 dollar iPad!",UNK
8523,Disorganized. They do kit seat people as they come in. Rude. Better to go to Mcdonalds.,UNK
8524,Bad and old food. The service has gone down in the past 6 months and it's almost better to just go to a sit down restaurant with their prices.,UNK
8525,Used to be a regular at this bar.  They fired Dawn the bartender who was the best worker this bar had.  Will return when she is rehired.,UNK
8526,"It was my first time at this establishment but not my first Japanese experience.  The server was great. However, the food was overcooked.",UNK
8527,"The DMV.... never fun... Bring a book and be prepared to wait. Very small parking lot. This is the \""best\"" DMV in town, but thats like saying getting the flu is preferable to malaria :\\",UNK
8528,"Drinks expensive. Music not for anyone over 18 (maybe 16). Compared to similar clubs in NY or LA, well below par. Will NOT return.",UNK
8529,The prices at the gas station used to be almost better than anywhere else.  Not anymore.  Now I only purchase gas when I'm running on fumes and I am at the gym.  Otherwise I rather use the station in the corner of Tatum and Union Hills.  Seems to have the best prices.,UNK
8530,The food is just ok nothing special. I had the fish and chips I would rather them be battered and not Panko crusted. The service is just ok too. I did enjoy the cold beer.,UNK
8531,"On the same level as Taco Bell.  Everything is covered in some-excuse-for-grated-cheddar cheese.\n\nGreasy, too salty, and downright mediocre at best.\n\nGo elsewhere if you want a good meal.",UNK
8532,"Great yogurt and open later for thay craving\nThe girl that works on Sunday is not the friendliest person in the world.  I was the only one in there, so I tried to say hello etc. She looked and really said nothing.  BLANK STARE",UNK
8533,"Place was clean. The food and service was fine. If you're in the mood for some Ruby Tuesday, you found it.",UNK
8534,This places is nasty the rice is always over cooked and the teriyaki sauce is just to salty the only good thing there is the side salad,UNK
8535,"I reviewed this once and yelp removed it because, they said, it didn't include a first hand experience.  so, here's my review with a first-hand experience.  I went there...and it was a filthy dump.",UNK
8536,"Guess I got there on a bad day or it was the cook's day off. Server recommended the classic Primanti. The food was undercooked, cold and greasy. This is the first time I ever remember leaving a restaurant with gut-ache.",UNK
8537,"Seems to be going downhill. Staff not cheerful or helpful. Have stayed here before, but will go elsewhere. South Point is cleaner and better value for example.",UNK
8538,The service here is disgusting! Spent over an hour waiting for my food. Just to find out the cashier never placed my order to the cooks! All they did for me was give me a cheap apology. I will never come back!,UNK
8539,I've been here twice and not impressed - seems highly overrated. The view is nice from the patio and it is right next to the canal - also the barking bar is cute. I would go back after biking along the canal for a quick beer but that's about it.,UNK
8540,"The dim sum here was pretty good,  and the service was relatively friendly.  The location is right in the center of Chinatown.",UNK
8541,I finally found a good soul food place Thanks to Angie and Mama I'll definitely be back,UNK
8542,Le nouveau bar ''in'' d'HoMa ! /// The newest bar in Hochelaga-Maisonneuve ! On y sert de la bouffe du terroir + bi\u00e8res / cocktails !,UNK
8543,"Instead of gagging on CPK fare, I gagged on Ruby's egg muffin instead. At the height of the breakfast hour, I was served a rubbery egg sandwich with coagulated cheese and cold bacon. How dare they charge almost $7 for that crap!",UNK
8544,Not what I thought it would be at all. Very greasy and staff not friendly. They DO give you a lot of food.,UNK
8545,"Food was okay, my rice was good but my flautas were super greasy and not very flavorful... The best thing about the experience was probably the bean dip and chips. But I've still had better",UNK
8546,"third visit and the owner was so beyond rude and arrogant, it killed whatever good things may have happened. weird because his wife was lovely, staff was great, but he literally ruined it for our whole family. even our young daughters were blown away with how rude he was. never going back, cannot recommend.",UNK
8547,Nice for breakfast,UNK
8548,Not really a fan of anything they offered food and service was not even worth writing a full review!!,UNK
8549,"The problem with Sport Books is that they mostly need to cater to the Horse Race gamblers, so when it comes to sports, they don't have the room to accommodate those gamblers especially during March Madness.  Having said that, this is one of the better ones.  Many screens are available.",UNK
8550,"Pretty much what I expected from a chain restaurant.  Came here with my inlaws.  The potato soup was good.  The sliders were pretty good.  The service was good.  Nothing really special, but quite satisfactory.",UNK
8551,Not a great selection and always messy. I like their chocolate stand but that is more because of its novelty in a small department store. I think here as opposed to other macys is overpriced. The clearance rack isnt very clearancee.,UNK
8552,Stopped by for a coffee and I felt as if I was intruding even though the place was empty. Not one word was uttered by the proprietor and was totally unfriendly. I guess you have to be a local to get a hi. Coffee was mediocre at best.,UNK
8553,"It's what you would expect.  A good turkey sandwich, side salad, and a cookie.  Not rocket science.  It's clean and pretty fast.  A convenient place for a quick lunch.",UNK
8554,"Kinda a love/hate relationship with McCarran.  You love it when you land, but you might also love it or hate it when you leave!!",UNK
8555,Ok but not fabulous-decor in room was bland.  Quiet with all the things a business traveler could want including business center where you can print out your boarding pass for free.  Great view of uptown and very comfortable beds.,UNK
8556,"Living social, Exotic Excapes, Plaza casino did us good. Boycott this casino at all cost.",UNK
8557,High end shopping mall. Bought a pair of Skechers at the Skechers store for my aching feet.,UNK
8558,"Incompetent and rude staff in the office. They do not even acknowledge maintenance requests within a reasonable amount of time, let alone perform the repairs. People are breaking rules e.g. parking, noise, satellite dishes, chairs and garbage out on the landing, which makes it unpleasant.",UNK
8559,Not real Italian gelato ! Too bad! Without tasty! They sell many products made in Canada or different places but not from Italy !!! Really really bad!!,UNK
8560,I have lived in the area for 7 years and the service is the same. Short of not opening the doors. Rude and unprofessional staff. Customer service training for management staff is required.,UNK
8561,"The special Pho is not really special. Even when we asked for the right combination for the four of us, they brought out two small bowls that can only feed two of us.",UNK
8562,Disgusting calzone. Cost 20 bucks. Delivery 20 minutes late. Pizza just okay.,UNK
8563,"Way overpriced! My husband paid $7 for one Pacifico! Yikes!! The guacamole and chips were ok, but the one star is becasue my husband was sick all night after having their steak tacos.",UNK
8564,worst Pho I ever had. the meats were frozen. in fact it was so frozen that it stillnjad frost on them. not to mention that I wanted to dine in and they bagged everything to go.  Who doest that?,UNK
8565,I ordered chile rellenos and beans and what I got was chile relleno soup and watered down beans.  you could literally drink the chile rellenos.  worst worst WORST mex in all the valley.,UNK
8566,"The grand cafe food is wonderful - the service is very poor.  We waited in line longer to give them our money than we did sitting and eating our food!  I wish we could give you folks four stars, but service is a great deal apart of eating!!!",UNK
8567,The restaurant was nice but the  food was nothing special ...every disappointed we were a big group ...service was excellent but we'll not go back,UNK
8568,"I had to throw my food away it smelled so rancid from the Greece. The staff was not helpful, and when I went to cash into my bonus points they said I spent it . What a rip off. Never again!",UNK
8569,"Over priced By the time I got my tickets and paid there \""fees\"" I could have bought it at regular cost from the show and saved money\n\nThese dudes are not worth the time waiting in a line",UNK
8570,another irish pub for your next crawl...,UNK
8571,"Yeah, I wasn't crazy about their pizza, either. It was a typical doughy type pizza. I didn't have any of Darren's sub. The cannoli was decent. Delivery was pretty fast, though.",UNK
8572,"The waterfall is gorgeous, the dancers are hot, but the crowd leaves much to be desired.",UNK
8573,Very blah. The cesear dressing tasted like mayonnaise. The food didn't haven't much flavor. I would highly recommend Olive Garden over Bravo.,UNK
8574,"I attempted to return a faulty vape fluid here once and they called to have my car towed. Not exactly the must adult response to a customer service request, methinks.",UNK
8575,It was overly priced for food that looked like it sat there all day! Dry meat and not a lot of choices! I couldn't even make a decent salad! Worried about even trying the fish and the deserts looked gross!,UNK
8576,"Rockaberry is the place to go when you want a cheap, giant serving of dessert. Great for sugarholics.",UNK
8577,"I adore McQueen.  The story is roomy, good selection of merchandise.  The salespeople, huh? do they even know who Alexander McQueen was?????  Very poor customer service and lack of product knowledge.  Lee would be mortified.",UNK
8578,"It's not quick never quick, in the beginning the staff are rude and don't care but after awhile of seeing your face they open up and even recognize your voice over the phone. The place is too small and they need more works, beds, and equipment.",UNK
8579,"Worst service ever! We waited more than 40 minutes to get WATER! I went to get a pitcher myself. Eventually we walked out and I don't think the \""manager\"" even noticed. Funny thing the restaurant was half empty. Stay away from here!!",UNK
8580,The food was ok. Alissa was awesome and energetic. She noticed we were cold and offered us a hot tea when we walked in.,UNK
8581,The food is so-so. Widmer on tap. No line. Comfy seating. It does the job.,UNK
8582,Good Burger but on the pricy side for what you get. I work nearby and was hoping for a lunch deal but they aren't open for lunch. Pleasant staff and service was good but no lunch no return trips.,UNK
8583,"Had the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict and it was very good, but the service was flat out horrible.  40 minutes to get our food and the beer that i ordered when i sat down.  The place wasnt all that busy either.",UNK
8584,"The service is getting slower, especially during lunch time drive-thru wait time.  Drive-thru is suppose to be faster, yet I'm waiting in line longer than people going into the branch.  Need to fix time or you'll drive people away to another banks.",UNK
8585,"The food is really, really good but the service is horrifically slow.  If you are golfing or live in the community it is well worth the wait if you have a few days to spare.",UNK
8586,"Overcharged on insurance not looked after by there so called \"" customer service \"" make sure to rent somewhere else and save yourself the troubles of dealing with them and there total lack of customer care",UNK
8587,Don't rent here. There are so many unsolved issues here. You become a number when you move in here. .,UNK
8588,Can you say SUPER EXPENSIVE! $20 for 2 drinks! Yeah no I rather walk my @$$ to CVS across the street and buy my own bottle of whiskey. It's way CHEAPER!,UNK
8589,"Service was good, sushi was fresh but for an AYCE restaurant, Sushi Freak can't compare to House of Goyemon.  The selection at Sushi Freak is limited and they only allow one dessert per person? C'mon!",UNK
8590,Taco Bell and Dell Taco are way better at 1/4 of the cost. Worst excuse for a burrito I've ever had. They also use cheap mixer for their drinks which make cocktails not taste as good as they should.,UNK
8591,Never go there on a game day. They cater to people parking for games and don't care about their actual customers. Oh and they charge for parking just to shop on a game day.,UNK
8592,"Gnocchi was delicious, service was good. Need to eat here again to give a better, full review.  Will be back at some point.",UNK
8593,"Good show..... Good talent. Only one suggestion, and that is that they find a better way to admit people to the theater. Definitely  have drinks before you get here it's pricey!!!",UNK
8594,Absolutely the worst sushi my husband and I have ever had.  It was Gross!!! I don't know why they use so much rice or why the fish wasn't cold.  You couldn't pay me to go back to this place!,UNK
8595,It's crappy.,UNK
8596,"They raised their prices again bah hah.  And when they send coupons out now they are only for 6\"" inch sandwich and still give less meat then port of subs.",UNK
8597,Still have popcorn ceilings. Room was nice and clean.,UNK
8598,Worst Cab Service ever. Ronda was the RUDEST person ever on the phone. Please someone just put them out of service already.,UNK
8599,Amazing food yet horrible service. They simply gave us a bottle opener to open the wine ourselves. When we asked for a doggy bag they gave us a stack of stirofoam bowls to fill ourselves. Butter chicken was one of the best I've had. Will probably go back anyways.,UNK
8600,"View was awesome, the cost was unbelievable high, you pay to park,ride,walk on walk, look off walk, take picture, I would suggest looking from the most southern rim",UNK
8601,"31 Flavors, \n5 (or so) tables, \n4 loud teenagers, \n3 other ice cream choices within,\n2 blocks.\n1 customer who probably won't be back.",UNK
8602,"Great food. We were there around 9 on the Sunday of a long weekend. They closed the kitchen while we were there. Also, the place is nice enough but I would not call it fancy. It's more of a family restaurant or a good weeknight option for couples.",UNK
8603,business has now closed.,UNK
8604,I was blown away by the rude behavior! Very poor customer service. We went through the drive thru for the first time based on the reviews the other night. The girl working at the window was extremely rude! She slammed the window shut before I could even get her name.,UNK
8605,Very limited hours.,UNK
8606,"Dirty, old fitness equipment that always has one or more pieces a visit that is out of order.\n\nI am actually canceling my membership today. \n\nMy wife really enjoys body pump classes. She would rate it a 4.",UNK
8607,Typical chain.,UNK
8608,"Maybe because I have lived in New York, but I was really not impressed with the pizza. The crust was gluey and not crispy enough. The place itself was fine but I would not come here for the pizza again.",UNK
8609,"Good coffee, decent environment. Great for on the way to work. Right next to the 101.\n\nHowever Parking SUCKS!!!!!  Sorry, but its true.",UNK
8610,"The burgers are excellent. Milkshakes were ok, but not worth the price",UNK
8611,"Nasty , dont waist your money.  Tried the carmel chocolate chip blonde .. the frosting was was too sweet and the cupcake was so dry.  Save your 4 bucks and walk down to Ritas!",UNK
8612,"Went there last week. While the food was good, I was hungry less tha 2 hours later. Will not be back.",UNK
8613,Service sucks.  Not follow up or communication.  Spent almost 3.5 hours waiting for a New Car Purchase  3 month/3000 mile check up.,UNK
8614,"Good happy hour, if you are craving margaritas. They have different flavors and you can't go wrong with any of them. The food is good, but nothing special.. oh and did I mention free chips???",UNK
8615,Ordered but then she kept telling me all their different specials. Finally said ok to 3 roast beefs. Just got home. Order totally wrong. Not going back.,UNK
8616,This place is good if the weather permits. If it is super hot or super cold dont go. Its all out doors. I like the south one more because it is indoors.,UNK
8617,Expect the slowest service you have ever seen.  3 hours for a meal on a Sunday night.,UNK
8618,The tortilla was good but everything else was forgettable. I am from San Diego and this food is nowhere near the standards that I am use to. It's too bad some people don't get to try real mexican food.,UNK
8619,"Came here just to return cable boxes. It was obvious what we we doing, since we were standing there holding them. John could clearly see it. He chose to wait till we were next in line to tell us that the procedure was to check in first. Rude. Annoying.",UNK
8620,Pretty good little shop. I have checked several of them out on the strip. Their accessories are a favorite of mine. Lots of sparkly and fun ones to choose from and not very expensive prices. \n\nI check this place out from time to time when I'm in the area.,UNK
8621,The service was very friendly. The food was terrible. Burger and fries tasted old and were cold.,UNK
8622,The staff was polite on the phone and delivery was fast but the food was horrible. Had the family dinner a and everything in the order tasted old. Nothing was fresh the crab ra goons were hard as a rock. Won't order from here again.,UNK
8623,Raaannnndom facade but I was hopeful as I entered shared art space / cafe. Unfortunately no fresh juice and no acai available.. And very hesitant service. Hopefully it just hit it on a slow morning,UNK
8624,"Sadly, the West Washington store closed :-(",UNK
8625,I only ate here once but it was expensive and unremarkable. Generic American food. I would rather grab a burger at In-and-Out.,UNK
8626,False advertisement and shitty customer service = dumb.,UNK
8627,I've been to this Starbucks before and it is always a little slow but the coffee is wonderful...however I've been sitting in the drive thru for now 20mins..don't come here if ur on break from work..really ridiculous!,UNK
8628,"I had the Calzone, tasted like garlic cheesy bread. YUMMY :) they have great beer selection too!!",UNK
8629,The hot water in the shower took 30 mins. It was so bad. I complained about that and they still didn't do anything,UNK
8630,They were 25 minutes late. I called and was told they were only 5 minutes away.  Ten minutes late I called and told they would be there in 5 minutes.  Would not recommend.,UNK
8631,"This one was the second five guys I've ever been to. The quality and taste were good, but I prefer the location on Lake Mead & Tenaya for cleanliness and friendliness.",UNK
8632,"Do not request your order for delivery. Took us almost 2 hours to get our food and we are still waiting. Very disappointing! We called to find out what's going on, someone picked up, then hung up on us. Never eating here again.",UNK
8633,Crooked haircut. Had to go elsewhere to have fixed,UNK
8634,Nothings changed. no Boarshead. 2nd rate products. A meat counter that lies about their products.  Kiddies are still in charge. Bring back Bill. I'll stick to Fry's Superstore.,UNK
8635,"This location is terrible. They did nothing but screw up multiple cars of mine. Now it's two years later, and the compressor they broke and replaced is broken again. \n\nDO NOT GO THERE!",UNK
8636,"Very disappointing. Ordered delivery and Kabob was overcooked, appetizers were bland, pita was cheap, store bought kind.",UNK
8637,the store and company does not care about customers that are unemployed.  They will not help with making arrangements to make\npayments every month.  They are awful.,UNK
8638,It would be a great place to watch a game if the jukebox music wasn't up so loud. There are tvs at the booths with sound so it would be awesome if I could actually hear it. Too bad - wont be back.,UNK
8639,I was not impressed. Mainly because the fruit toppings were lack luster. What can I say? I'm a topping snob. The amount of variety doesn't make up for the mediocrity of texture and flavor. Boo.,UNK
8640,From a scale from 1 to 10  I  give this place 1...,UNK
8641,Really overpriced and the worst coffee I have ever had. I am a coffee grower and I was just amazed at how bad the coffee was.,UNK
8642,"I had the Fuku Burger. The sauce was quite tasty,but a little too much salt on the burger.\nThe garlic fries were so-so; not much difference from regular fries",UNK
8643,"Been awhile, used to go quite often because my friends liked it. Food is not very good, bar side is fun though.",UNK
8644,Horrible food   Service was ok but to our shock the food was horrible,UNK
8645,I like the location and room rates for the TI ....the hotel and rooms are in need of some major updating ......,UNK
8646,Place have a very poor customer service. Rushed as to pay and workers complained right in front of us. Workers are rude placing plates without saying anything. Too pricey and food not that good. Not coming back here.,UNK
8647,I didn't like the food and i normally will eat everything. It was just not as good as it looked.,UNK
8648,I'm not a coffe drinker... Their hot chocolate is ok. The environment is very laid back.,UNK
8649,Overpriced food. Foodies might like it but it's not for me.,UNK
8650,I think the all you can eat is too expensive for what they offer. I've had better and less expensive in Korea Town in LA,UNK
8651,Really aweful place.  The food sucks and you can't win anything here.  Kinda run down too.  A better place is Main Street across the street.,UNK
8652,"I was only here briefly, but after seeing how one of the employees was totally dressed down by her boss, in front of a customer, I don't think I'll be shopping here.",UNK
8653,"Nice comic books store, not very friendly but have a variety of back issues.",UNK
8654,There is really nothing special about this place. There's a wide selection of burgers and drinks but I think even In-N-Out is better and they have less variety. Service was ok. My food wasn't even hot when I got it.,UNK
8655,No flavor. food tastes like the Chinese buffet places. Ordered a sesame chicken expecting a heavy dark sauce. In return I got a honey flavored chicken plate.,UNK
8656,One of the worst places I have been to since I have moved here. Our bartender paid attension to the TV than to her customers. The atmosphere was like being at a old folks home. Will never go back there.,UNK
8657,Great casino and good food. I still prefer Bellagio.,UNK
8658,Employees more worried about gossiping than serving customers. Almost 5 am and I waited 8 minutes for 2 breakfaat  sandwiches. This place is a joke.,UNK
8659,Not a good experience. Fruit was not fresh. Turkey sandwich was dry and had no flavor. Sandwich fell apart as I ate it. Customer service below average. I rarely complain but this was not enjoyable. Will not come back.,UNK
8660,"Clean & nice facility , they do a good job here :-)",UNK
8661,"Suprisingly decent, nothing spectacular but prices were ok and they have hookah on Friday and Saturday. Pretty cute girls that work there and a good place to meetup if you are up north for some reason.",UNK
8662,They quit selling fried oysters! Couldn't tell me why either. The fried oysters were my favorite too....Dam!!!,UNK
8663,"Fresh oysters were creamy and not brine tasting- yum. Clam chowder was thick and hearty, crab cakes were tasty as well. Excellent service and well taken care of.",UNK
8664,"To bad this place closed it was interesting yet yummy, big variety of Peanut Butters and Sandwiches, I was not a fan of all the flavors...",UNK
8665,Was like any other typical bbq place. Unsure why there was so much hype. Service was slow. Food was tepid.,UNK
8666,"If you like SMALL no meat wings. (I call them pigeon wings.) And like to pay to much, You'll love this place....",UNK
8667,"OMG staff super slow and rude, food is disgusting. I will never step a foot in here again and wouldn't recommend you do either.",UNK
8668,Good old school sports bar! Great place to watch all the games. Food is bar food but the atmosphere is cool,UNK
8669,"the quality has gone down since i started shopping there years ago. \n\nstill some great finds! i love their apartment stuff, and the clearances are always fun!",UNK
8670,Muy mal y lento servicio.. LA comida sin savor no pidan el ceviche De pescado save asquerozo. Las micheladas ni se diga ..,UNK
8671,"Over priced and the food isnt anything special. With all of the amazing food in Vegas, this isnt worth it.",UNK
8672,"Ordered delivery and I would have to say this is not a recommended place for Asian food. Did not mind the 45 minute for delivery, but the food from the rice to garlic chicken to the soup was disgusting.  More vegetables then meat. Paid $33 and barely ate anything.",UNK
8673,"I've been here about 4 times. Tonight service was subpar, but other times excellent. The same goes for the food tonight. Mondays :(",UNK
8674,I really liked the atmosphere here and the beer is great.  Happy hour food was pretty good.  At another visit we had a hamburger and fries.  It would have been perfect except for THAT BUN!  OM-Gosh what a horrible bun.,UNK
8675,"The food was good, and it was a fun experience to share with friends, but I have to say, it's WAY overpriced.  We spent $120 for two people, and we were not full.  In our opinion, it's not worth the money.",UNK
8676,Not bad for fast food. The fish was good the chicken was just ok the shrimp  was not what we was looking for if I visit Ny Ny again I will pass up on this spot and try one of the other places,UNK
8677,Worst clinic I have ever been to we arrived at 930 appt was at 10 its now after 12 and were still waiting staff doesnt seem to care we were 2nd in the room 5 people showed up after and are called before us this place is ran horribly,UNK
8678,"used our luxor coupon. both chinese entrees were pretty unimaginative.. exact same red/green peppers, onions and pretty undercooked.",UNK
8679,This place is a total rip-off! Crappy music and false advertisement to boot!  Avoid it like the plague! We had a better time at Rain on Saturday and there was no cover!,UNK
8680,They have suspended service in Nevada!  Only two stars cause they still list Las Vegas as served on their website and it took me 20 minutes to find out that is BA.,UNK
8681,"Bad customer service, only go here of you have to. Buyer beware.",UNK
8682,I give it 3 stars because a- i used the atm outside and didn't get to experience the bulletproof teller windows inside b- there were no robberies while I was there.,UNK
8683,Too many ticky tack changes.  Wings on special but you have to pay for ranch dressing! Service wasn't that good. Not coming back.,UNK
8684,"Had one great experience, one terrible and a lot of so so in between. It would help if they didn't  change the entire staff every week.",UNK
8685,Now a 24-hour cafe.,UNK
8686,"worst ever.  you get less than what you pay for.  Rooms are a mess.  Can't even get a coffee in the morning that does not take forever to get.  Gross - depressing, awful.  Let's make a deal - run!",UNK
8687,Service is terrible at this location. We saw several people leave because their food was taking to long. Took forever for a server to take our order and had to wait to check out. Won't come back to this location.,UNK
8688,It was pretty dead when we were there but the pizza was not to bad and cheap eats. The decoration was so nasty tho.,UNK
8689,"Pretty good Chinese food, more affordable than the other restaurants at MGM. I had wok fried noodles with beef and the shrimp tempura roll. Both were decent. My boyfriend had the Orange Chicken, which was more like sweet and sour chicken, but it was still pretty good.",UNK
8690,The worst wait staff I have experienced in a long time. Felt compelled to write a review. Need new management!  Hurry!  Not worth visiting. A shame - my experience with this chain had been good...,UNK
8691,"The caf\u00e9  is terrible, the entire store looks run-down and disorganized.  I absolutely love buying a coffee and reading a magazine at Barnes & Noble.  But not at this one.  They need a serious remodeling and to clean this mess up.",UNK
8692,"I came here one evening for dinner with a friend. Their souvlakis were great, especially the fries. However, other dishes were mediocre at best. There is nothing special about the place.",UNK
8693,This place has closed down,UNK
8694,"I tried it three time, they used Asian flavor which is delicious and not that much salty. It has different options of huge dishes. The place was nice and warm, it is perfect in cold weather.",UNK
8695,"Convenient location. It's right across the street from where I work, so when I'm in need of caffeine I come here. Staff has always been pleasant.",UNK
8696,I went to the new location awhile back and it is okay.  If you like bbq then this place has to be on your list to try in Las Vegas.,UNK
8697,Price good. Food bad. Shouldn't be too difficult for anyone else to reach those same conclusions.,UNK
8698,"Burgers are decent,  Fries very inconsistent.  They have a great pesto chicken sandwich.  Best sandwich in the joint..  Otherwise pretty mediocre",UNK
8699,"This place is gross. The food was bland, not hot when brought out, super greesy and horrible service. Typical chinese restaurant.",UNK
8700,I can't believe how wrong I was ... wtf?,UNK
8701,"Good pizza, cheap grub when in Aria complex, when you want to save money for lunch or whatever. On the 3rd floor, above the Chadelier, right in front of you as come out of the escalator",UNK
8702,Good breakfast\nClean\nBut add stingy on towels and bathroom supplies.\n\nOkay kind of breakfast\nCoolers and room a.c. worked,UNK
8703,"They are SO stingy with cream cheese on their bagels. I opened it up to find half the bagel covered in a minute layer of cream cheese. Not worth the $6 I payed to go home and waste my own cream cheese. Screw you, Einstein bros.",UNK
8704,Coffee was good. The service sucked. Rude and very condescending. Maybe she was having a bad day. But man was she rude.,UNK
8705,Worst pasta ive ever experienced in my life. 20+ bucks and it was dried up pasta with tomato sauce. Garlic bread was decent so i gave it 2 stars.,UNK
8706,"This hotel has seen better days. Definitely due for a complete remodel! With that being said, the R steakhouse is awesome. One of the best in Las Vegas.",UNK
8707,"Terrible! These employees are useless, everytime there's something wrong with my order. Avoid this location at all cost.",UNK
8708,"1 star just because I ate, the food did its job and I am no longer hungry. If the service was any slower I would've gone back in time. The food was satisfactory other than the fact that it was somewhat cold. Wouldn't come back or recommend this location.",UNK
8709,We eat a lot of Thai food in town and our friends said they loved this place. Tried it out and thought everything was really good. I LOVED the coconut ice cream.The service was great too! Will definitely be back.,UNK
8710,"Overpriced, average Italian in a hyped-up wise guy environment supposedly reminiscing of the old days of Phili lore.  Italian food should never cost this much.  I tried it twice, twice too many.",UNK
8711,I am a big time fan of the Russian honey cake and this place was a disappointment.  The cake had too much shortening added to it and the cake was really dry.  I will not buy honey cake from them again if they will cut out fresh quality ingredients to lower costs.,UNK
8712,"Did eyebrows with Meena. She was nice, but went way to thin.",UNK
8713,"Our driver was on time, but the inside of the cab reeked of cigarettes and was filthy. :(\n\nI probably will not use them again next time I'm in the area.",UNK
8714,Good enough for a lunch break where you want something different but nothing mind blowing.  Dinner service might be more interesting than lunch.,UNK
8715,course was in good shape.the only problem i had was my 6 month old clubs fell off the cart 3 times and scratched some of them.didnt hurt my score.,UNK
8716,This Aldo location has the worst sales associate I think I have ever dealt with.  If shopping here avoid the tall girl with long dark hair.  HORRIBLE is an understatement!,UNK
8717,Had the gnocchi delivered. Absolutely terrible. Gnocci's had to have been 2 years old. Delivery guy was shady too.,UNK
8718,5 year warranty with watch battery (with receipt). But I think it might be expensive. I was in a rush so didn't have time to comparison shop.,UNK
8719,The waitress MARIA ROSANNA was horrible come on now? She act like she don't care about her job and I don't recommend her to anybody. MARIA ROSANNA find a different job because you SUCK,UNK
8720,I was not pleased at all! I was disappointed,UNK
8721,"Very pushy! I went with my mother who is fighting cancer , I was shocked at how pushy they were with her. They are taking advantage of cancer patients.",UNK
8722,Went for lunch.\n\nFrozen hot chocolate not as good as NY location.\n\nCrabcake salad decent... but not good enough for a return visit.,UNK
8723,"Been here twice but still don't know why people were raving about this place. Burgers here taste like any other burgers. Maybe there's a special sauce there that I don't know about? Overall, can't differentiate this burger from Burger King. Waste of money.",UNK
8724,Meat was very hard like rubbery. Ordered large but it seems like small portion...just in a big bowl. Ordered egg rolls and they came out all burned. Don't go here.  Not worth the money.,UNK
8725,Bone in ribeye very poor quality and overcooked     Poor example of a Flemings \nServer did a good job   Manager was poor at his job \n\nI Would recommend any other steak house,UNK
8726,"Regardless of the day or time, it's the slowest Starbucks in town. Nice people but terribly disorganized.",UNK
8727,"I ordered chef's special, grilled salmon.\nsalmon was like flakes, rice was crispy: may be it was from the bottom of pan.\nfurthermore, their computer was down, I couldn't redeem my birthday points.",UNK
8728,Very reasonable in price. A lot of kids stuff. And they have the nice arena. A lot of machines that pay out. And great cafe open late. A lot of low limit tables as well.,UNK
8729,Very slow service. Had to ask twice for water. Food was good but very slow.  Server disappeared.,UNK
8730,"Apparently, the tailor in the store is not associated with Stitched; they are - separate company. But either way, still horrible.",UNK
8731,"Freakin sucked. Wait staff sucked food sucked, I wish the pirate ship would sail right thru. It only gets a star cause it won't let me post my comment without it!",UNK
8732,"Got in line with my daughter when we observed the lady in front of us returning a few donuts. Expecting the donuts to go in the trash per food regulation, I walked out after seeing them being placed back with the other donuts to be sold (again).",UNK
8733,"It was quite an event. we enjoyed it a lot .for the summer time its was a show. would like for it to be more music, a little lava would be good.",UNK
8734,"If you want to drive from Los Angeles to spend time in a Section 8 property, good luck to you. Front Desk told me that the rooms are going to be remodeled\nDon't rent this room out then!!!",UNK
8735,"Not bad for the price you pay. Spacious rooms, beds, clean, quick service. I just hate that all their toiletries smell like men's cologne.",UNK
8736,ok if u like green chile its its not that bad its actually good. the service is so so and omg the prices are ridiculous there is nothing under 10 dollars if u want lunch on the weekend.,UNK
8737,The staff was so precious and helpful and the sushi was Great. Especially for the price! I only have to change rating to 3 stars because after my initial review I came back and found 3 hairs in the same sushi roll.,UNK
8738,"I have been standing in line for over 60 minutes. Paid 30 minutes in waiting another 30 after i pay is complerely rude. They are apso letring literally 100 \""vip\"" Members in front of the uncool people never again will i eat here",UNK
8739,Can't see prices on line and can't get a login for 24 hours what a joke,UNK
8740,don't go without appointment,UNK
8741,"Played this course on May 17th, 2014.  Good layout but the greens were like concrete and the sand traps had almost no sand in them.  Got a good deal on Tee Off but won't play this again even if it were free.  They must cut back on maintenance during the summer.",UNK
8742,"It was good, big portions, with tasty biscuits.",UNK
8743,"Have to bring this down.  Place was cool, but the staff became really sh*tty.  I so like the food, but geez, it's smile or something.",UNK
8744,"Pretty much blows since they changed from a New York pizza joint to an Applebee's wannabe. Service downhill, food is eh, we're done going here.",UNK
8745,"Not bad for the price. The show was entertaining enough. I don't like the seating arrangement and prefer an more theater arrangement. Also, the place and the casino in general was very run down and smoky.",UNK
8746,"Had brunch today here, the pastas seemed all crusted and stale. They ran out of straws..are you serious? I had to wait 30 minutes to get a straw so I could sip on my juice. Im mad.",UNK
8747,I expected an energetic friendly staff when I visited this restaurant as it is new.  Instead the staff was rude and lazy.  I will not go back!!!,UNK
8748,This place is an absolute joke! They served me a beer but then carded me for my players card. The bartender had about 5 brain cells,UNK
8749,I have always enjoyed the food here since they opened but am thoroughly disgusted with the over the top high prices. These prices are not inline with other Mexican restaurants of equal or higher quality food. Don't think I will be going back exclusively because of the high prices.,UNK
8750,"There is a shuffle board table and pool table, but that is about all this place has going for it.  The bar staff is friendly, but this is a dive bar.",UNK
8751,Great place for specials anytime although lunch is cheaper.  I usually go there when working in the Peoria area and have never been disappointed.  The price is always good too.,UNK
8752,The teller was inefficient and unprofessional. The store manager just stood back and watch. I will never return to this branch.,UNK
8753,"Please check your bill for overcharging. Another time they did not give correct change. Sauce is bland. It is OK pizza for Arizona. Not impressed. I don't even think the owners Italian. Some weird accents. Nice try, I guess.",UNK
8754,Stopped for the Happy Hour specials. The food was only OK- greasy appetizers barely better than bar food. Drinks were weak and watery and an issue over the buy one get one was only handled after a discussion with the manager.,UNK
8755,"Sorry to say that this location closed yesterday (11/05/2013). Not sure of the reason, it seemed busy when ever I went, which was not often.  It had a good $5.00 lunch.",UNK
8756,This place opened too early. They have almost nothing in there. I would give them that but I bought milk that was pull date 5 days after I bought it. I got it home and it was so sour it was in CHUNKS! Clearly not caring for their products properly if that is happening.,UNK
8757,Worst experience I've ever had! From Roaches to terrible customer service. No house cleaning. This place is crap. Already waited and hour and a half to speak with a manager!,UNK
8758,Food sucks for vegetarians (and its overpriced) but the atmosphere was fun. Probably wouldnt go back though....they need more veggie options!!,UNK
8759,"Not the same as it used to be.... Smaller portions .... Like Drake says, nothing was the same ....",UNK
8760,"We ordered the \""hospitalized hot\"" chicken wings they we're mild at best so we were very disappointed. The pizza was mediocre nothing special and the place was hard to find. It just said PIZZA on the building.",UNK
8761,"Had muffler service here (almost changed the whole thing that got quite rusty), the price was very good, but the work needed fix just after 2 months (and the new mechanic was surprised at the low quality of the work), and with the current fix, the price is no longer good.",UNK
8762,$$$,UNK
8763,Everything in A stirafoam container. Deep fried greasy fast food. Not healthy. Not nice. Clean restrooms.,UNK
8764,"This airport has a part that was recently redone and that section is beautiful. The older part of the airport is, well, old. And it's noticeable. Lousy restaurants and not much else that's exciting.",UNK
8765,Called to ask about product availability (just wanted to check if the online information was up to date) 8 minutes later I was still on hold. Absolutely ridiculous.,UNK
8766,"They served my dinner, after a long wait, to another table!!!! The other table didn't even order but had no problem eating my dinner!!!",UNK
8767,Horrible service and inaccuracy. Nowhere near the standard of other restaurants in the chain. It seemed like it was all trainees working. Will avoid this location for sure,UNK
8768,2 times in 2 days. Must be good food. Once for lunch. Once for dinner. Gyros were terrific. Salads are enormous. \n\nGoing to come back.,UNK
8769,Average pizza at best and sub-par appetizers. Decent beer specials are only upside. Walk across the street and eat at Fuel for some real pizza.,UNK
8770,"In general, I do not like eating at buffets but this one was pretty enjoyable.",UNK
8771,"Typical bar food. Good burgers. \n\nIt gets extremely crowded on Wednesday evenings for half-price wine night. Be wary. If you're going for food on a Wed, show up by 6:30. Otherwise you'll never get a table.",UNK
8772,"This is a nice place to hang out and have a Burger or chicken dinner.  The pizza is so-so, but they have a lot more on the menu.  They have local entertainment that is surprisingly good.  The bar has added a lot to this community staple. A nice addition to the local food offerings.",UNK
8773,"I ask to see \""deep couches, ornate wood, dark fabrics\"" I'm shown blue couches and I literally just walked away from the sales associate. Huge selection of lame styles.",UNK
8774,Typical Indian casino. Piece of crap with horrible service and extra smoke!!!! Great people watching though.,UNK
8775,Beautiful place. Hour to get our food after watching people come in-eat-and go...  Lame,UNK
8776,"Grande conf\u00e9rence, service OK mais pas sp\u00e9cial",UNK
8777,"Happy hour, happy hour, happy hour! They have amazing drink specials from 4-7pm. And some tasty appetizers too.",UNK
8778,Good atmoshpere.  Prices were a little high considering it's mexican.  But the enchiladas were too salty and the guacamole was flavorless.  You guys ever heard of LIME?  Its not just for tequila shots!,UNK
8779,Meh.....  always a anted to try it out since I pass it so often going to Dutch Bros. Today I realized that I'm not missing out on much.,UNK
8780,"I love the new flavors including salted carmel, butter finger, and cookies and creme. But they no longer take American Express? What a small minded business Blunder...",UNK
8781,Expensive drinks and you feel like your sitting in the carpark. 8 bucks for a small jar of Guinness and auto gratuity on a table of 10 of us and we're just drinking. Rip off.,UNK
8782,"To begin with, The Sugar Factory at Town Square has a great staff and an amazing experience. The only minus is that the food comes from a very select menu and is not all that great. Also, it doesn't even compare to The Sugar Factory on the Strip!",UNK
8783,"Only for Buffet. Worse ever, don't go here unless you're a vegetarian.",UNK
8784,"There's probably better places with faster service and steaks ordered medium, which are actually well done. \n\nThe upsides are the graveyard prices and close proximity. \n\nOr I just went on a really bad night. :/",UNK
8785,"Stopped by to try the famous Sprinkles. We got a Pumpin, a Triple Cinnamon and two doggie cupcakes. The dogs lives their cupcakes. The Human cupcakes were dry. It was worth a one time stop.",UNK
8786,Been to one been to them all. It's not really my scene but don't get me wrong if you're with a group of guys and want to watch the games it will suit your needs.,UNK
8787,Over priced. Too much room. I'd rather go to tokyo discount.,UNK
8788,This place is okay nothing really good to talk about.,UNK
8789,"I don't understand why the off strip \""local\""casinos do not have any deals for locals. Its $ 10 per person if you at not staying at the hotel to enter the pool. Last summer we got in free on several occasions so I'm not sure what changed. Too bad",UNK
8790,"They do have some good chicken fingers but other than that they are over-rated and over priced.  Their lemonade is excellent but they charge for refills.  Cane sauce was good.\n\nOverall, I will not be a repeat customer.",UNK
8791,"The food was great ! However one of the front hosts was quite rude and unaccommodating .  We asked if we could order for our little one while we waited , and were told we could only pre-order if it was stuffed crust or pan but not off the kids menu . Huh??!",UNK
8792,"Service is a hit or miss, as is their seafood. Fortunately its a BYOW and their pizza is delicious (real pizza oven).",UNK
8793,This place is a rip-off. Don't bother coming here. They will gouge you for a henna tattoo they claim lasts 3-4 weeks...5 days later it disappears like magic. Along with your money.,UNK
8794,"I have only gotten delivery.... pizza isn't bad, isn't great either....its hard to get good pizza in Las Vegas.\nThe hot chicken fingers are my fav, and the wings are pretty good too.",UNK
8795,"We came here recently for lunch, and it just took too damn long. We didn't order anything wild, and the food was just ok. The appetizers came after the food, but the waitress tried to make up for it with a smile.",UNK
8796,"This place reminded me of eating in a thrift store. If you can get over that, you'll probably enjoy it. I believe that their menu is 100% vegetarian.  I just couldn't get over the fact that I was eating amongst people's old possessions.",UNK
8797,"I visited around lunch time and the food was not that good. I was expecting it to be a lot tastier. The entree was a  dry. I's a good thing I had sauce. I am sorry, but I won't be back.",UNK
8798,3 words - s car go\n\none of the few places that serves it and they do a bang up job\nthrow in a Manhattan and I'm happy,UNK
8799,"Food is fair to \""OK\"" but that's not why you come here.\nIt's filled with TV's and music, sorta of like a wild college restaurant in Mexico, Spring Break vibe.",UNK
8800,"Went there last night, great concept, good looking food ... Tasteless and bland.",UNK
8801,"The food was delicious and my kids loved it. I did not love the service, though.  The waitress was weird & rude. When she took my order she didn't even look at me... She just walked by, wrote what we wanted, and left with a face of ignorance.",UNK
8802,"Service was quick, but quality wasn't great. It's a fusion place, the pho may be OK but the thai food was a little off base. The lady was nice, has a lot of people going here. I wish I knew what their expertise is.",UNK
8803,"I love the cheesecakes here - my favorite is the Dulce de Leche!! The food is okay. I just wish there were more vegetarian options, so I can join my friends when they eat here.",UNK
8804,"This restaurant is okay. The food is good, but not fabulous. And it's very expensive for only a so-so dining experience. I went there once, that was enough.",UNK
8805,Bad experience at this place.. Receptionist is poorly trained and office is way overpriced..  I feel as if I have been scammed,UNK
8806,"I've only visited this thrift store once, but it's really quite nice. The prices are much higher than others in the area, but it seems a bit more selective in what it offers. I do plan to return.",UNK
8807,We went here for an escape from the heat- but unfortunately they barely had any A/C on and we only realized this after we had purchased the tickets.  I'd go to any other theatre if your goal is to have a nice cool break from the AZ Summer heat.,UNK
8808,Food was good but the pork was a little dry on the Del Ray. I would like to try something else next time.,UNK
8809,"This is for a certain type of crowd: college, too broke, and too high to care.",UNK
8810,"I feel bad giving these guys two stars and will go back a second time. My visit was possibly on a busy night for the staff and the slices may have sat for a bit...they were okay, but not great. I'll come back again...",UNK
8811,"Decent Italian in a suburban strip mall. Decent wine selection, meal sizes were generous. \n\nBathroom was built for Phoenix Sun players, I had to tiptoe to use the urinal. Seriously.",UNK
8812,"This place is dirty.  The plate my food was served on was dirty, our waitress's apron was dirty, and the booth we sat in was dirty; it left a huge grease stain on my daughter's pants.   This place is disgusting.",UNK
8813,Cookies were delicious. Food okay.,UNK
8814,"This place is the definition of OK. Not great and not bad either. Good for a family, but not really a date place. If you want something hot, quick, low key and moderately tastey, then this is the place for you.",UNK
8815,"This place has the potential to be very good, but it's very inconsistent when it comes to their product.  In the past I've found the taste a bit bland, and today the pizza was overcooked.",UNK
8816,This place is bad. The staff is so unfriendly and the food is mediocre. It thrives simply because if its location. Egg Works is a much better choice.,UNK
8817,"Average meat. TGI Fridays offers dipping sauce for their steaks too. High pressure wait staff, attempting to push us into everything on the menu. Blatant, not suggestive and working to boost the cheque. Go elsewhere, there are many choices on and around the strip.",UNK
8818,The knuckle draggers working in the lot itself failed to meet even the most modest expectations. Apparently there is a don't talk to the customers rule in place. You are just supposed to guess if this is your car at pickup time and guess again if they are done with the  paperwork on the return.,UNK
8819,"Messed up my whole order, the drink they gave me was watered down they also never gave me my receipt! Never going to this location ever again.",UNK
8820,"place is dirty, workers are rude, and, there was a bug in my coffee.  Coffee mugs are not clean, and, they keeps their tables, chairs and areas dirty, you always have to ask to have them clean.  Bathrooms are gross.",UNK
8821,This location is closed.\nThis location is permanently close as in out of business.,UNK
8822,Chaos...bad food...nothing special about it...not worth paying!!!,UNK
8823,Had a good experience. I had the hot and sour soup an the mapo tofu. They were great for the price just a bit to oily. Other than that It was ok. Good for the price.,UNK
8824,"I wish the service was better, I like the environment",UNK
8825,Recently went to eat at restaurant and the service was horrible!!!! Wait staff continued to walk past our table (for 10 mins). We finally received some service after running down one of the hostesses.  Waiter Javier was rude! Will not recommend this place to travelers.,UNK
8826,Great Pizza! Horrible Service!!!!,UNK
8827,"Service was mediocre at best. The food was below average. I suppose if you've been out drinking all night and had a case of the munchies then food quality wouldn't be an issue. However, if you're sober and care then lower expectations immensely.",UNK
8828,"We ordered pizza to be delivered at our home at 11:30 at night. How busy could they be, right?!?! It took an hour for them to deliver the pizza to our house and there was bad service from the employees.",UNK
8829,Pho is average and the staff are jerks. Avoid this place like the plague and head a few doors to to Pho Bang New York. There's a reason why this place is empty and Pho Bang is full!,UNK
8830,This place closed down and now I think it is some sort of biker themed bar/grill.  Haven't been to the new place yet.,UNK
8831,"Would of given it Four stars but couldn't believe no free wifi...they charge you $11.99 per day for wifi, come on in this day and age not to provide free wifi that's a good reason to go elsewhere.",UNK
8832,The food is ok.  I like the ambiance....it's a little expensive,UNK
8833,There is nothing wrong with the food here.  The service is probably above average.  I've had lunch here a few times.  But somehow I have always left here feeling as though I did not get good value.,UNK
8834,Went there on a thursday... I was surprised it was so lame. there were a few ppl there but no one was dancing... the music sucked. We went around 11 and stayed for like a half hour and left.,UNK
8835,"Called them up snd he was to busy to talk, said he would call back and never did.... I have alot of carpeting and need to stretch some area, they're loss.",UNK
8836,The service is horrible and the food is way over priced for what it is (its only ok). I will never go back.,UNK
8837,Slush Puppy machine is AWOL and my cappuccino was made with off milk. Sad times indeed.,UNK
8838,Terrible service! The cashier was rude and not as friendly as other Starbucks employees. My drink was completely forgotten about; I had to go up and remind them after 30 minutes of waiting. These girls need to be retrained.,UNK
8839,Went in at 8:55 and the girl said they closed at 8:45 and the machines were already turned off. \nWent to walgreens and picked up some pints for my kids instead.,UNK
8840,Still waiting on resolution on an issue had back in 2012/2013. Will update my review if the manager comes through as promised.,UNK
8841,Been awhile since our last visit. Just got reminded why.. Blizzards are like eating cups of plain ice cream. Very skimpy on toppings. Value for your money is what any customer is looking for. Shame on you for cheating your customers out of what they pay for.,UNK
8842,The Famous Burritos on rainbow is gone.  New owners different name and different food.  We are very sorry they are gone.,UNK
8843,"over price !  Ca Kho To never taste the same ,  sometimes salty , sometimes no flavor at all ! never go there again.",UNK
8844,"Food is ok . It has nice patio and decor, friendly stuff. I do not understand  why it's so busy all the time......",UNK

8847,"Awful, service is awful\nfood not cooked all the way through\nwill not recommend it at all.\n\nTHIS IS NOT FOR KIDS AT ALL OR BABIES.",UNK
8848,"Gave this place another chance and again it was severely understaffed (on the biggest AZ Cardinals game of the year). Major disappointment with horrible service. Hire more staff, Lou and quit being so cheap.",UNK
8849,"I thought it was pretty good - I wished that I had known that the chicken was light and dark meat - I would've chosen something different, had I known....",UNK
8850,Get the salt-baked fried octopus! This the the best dish there.\n\nAvoid the short ribs in black pepper sauce; 'twas quite rubbery and bland.,UNK
8851,"Food is uninspired, dry, tasteless and bland.  Not worth the effort, not just because of the food, but because it is always busy for some reason.",UNK
8852,Subway is better any day!,UNK
8853,Got the daily special (Eggs Benedict) with a coffee. Nothing special but service was fast and friendly and it was a clean place. We sat at the window looking into the garage with the creepy stereotypical Native which was odd.,UNK
8854,"What kind of service is that? When I walked in this place there were almost no customers, but I had to wait for 25 minutes for my simple order. When I finally got my sandwich, it was barely worm. I'm not going there again!",UNK
8855,it is goodwill.. u know what to expect =),UNK
8856,Used to be a serviceable record store but has become a shell of its former self.  OVERPRICED lps and the selection is almost the same as it was 10 years ago.  I am an avid collector and really find no reason to go here anymore.,UNK
8857,Food was bland. Horchata was really spicy.\nI would recommend going to a different pupusa place.,UNK
8858,"Southern Bell was the best but the cupcakes were kind of dry... Won't go back again. Cute but not very good, unfortunately.",UNK
8859,"If you don't like your food... do not send it back to the kitchen... The \""Chef\"" will come out and scream at you... Stay away from this place.",UNK
8860,horrible horrible horribe customer service.  They also sit on packages way to long and in some instances loose a package all together.  I wish they would just destroy this location and allow the other locations to properly handle mail.,UNK
8861,"Good lox and bagels, dirty dinning room and staff that needs a little more pep in their step. All in all if you have 20 minutes to kill and you don't mind sitting outside then I would recommend the traditonal.",UNK
8862,This bar is a beautiful mess. Absolutely hilarious and a must-hit spot on any bar crawl. I would recommend making this your last stop - it's always better at that point when you have no idea what you're doing anymore.,UNK
8863,the lady that works there was not helpful at all.  Very poor customer service.,UNK
8864,OMG!  The worst Chinese take out in town.  I ordered Sun Devil Chicken & Chicken lo mien.  Well the chicken was chewy.  Icky.v In fact I gagged.  Its was liked rubber.  My daughters also thought the chicken was nasty.  Never again.  Eww!,UNK
8865,I was expecting more meat on my pho ut it ends up can't fill me at all.,UNK
8866,Would never go back,UNK
8867,This place is a staple lunch spot for us. I have rated this place highly before. Today an order mix up became a very uncomfortable situation. Really too bad.,UNK
8868,"This McDonalds. We hate going to this one because no matter what time of the day we go, they always mess up our orders. We have a big family, and every time, there are a few things always missing.",UNK
8869,"I split the roasted turkey with a friend one morning after a long night of drinking. It was a little sandwich for $10... Yeah it's Vegas but no, I'm not down. It was okay. I only came here because I was staying at the Signature.",UNK
8870,Nobody greeted me when I entered the bank. There was a black girl who just looked at me and say nothing. The employees are not friendly and helpful.,UNK
8871,If you like small portions and indifferent service this is your spot.  Yawn.  I was very disappointed and expected so much more from chef Keller.,UNK
8872,So-so pizza.  There's definitely better pies in town.,UNK
8873,Poor service and lack luster items..nothing special about the food since everything was just basic Italian food. It's all right as a basic place to eat after jersey boys!,UNK
8874,Cheesy fun. The games r excellent and the hosts are lively. Price is right live is mostly successful and worth the relatively cheap price.,UNK
8875,I had a nice time celebrating at the club. My only issue it that the well drinks are very strong with cheap liquor. If you use less liquor you can afford to buy a better grade of liquor.,UNK
8876,"Gets too damn crowded, im pretty sure hepatitis is in that pool\n\nHowever, before the pool there are others. Looks great!  I dont think i would go back, it was not bad\n\nAlot of tities",UNK
8877,This place is suppose to contact my Medicare & they threatened to put a restraining order against us now I can't even use my medical.,UNK
8878,This was a cute place to grab something quick. Good hotdogs and cheese fries. Gotta love there drinks in the pink souvenir cups!,UNK
8879,The only thing worse than the store manager's attitude was perhaps his hygiene. Rude as all hell. I'm done with this place. I'm off to Fry's.  Update: radio shack price: 10.48. Fry's 3.22,UNK
8880,It seems that everytime i go there tables are not wiped down. There always leftovers from previews custumers.  The one in 36st and mcdwell much better one. They even have free wifi!,UNK
8881,"Sweet potato fries are ok. Five Guys aross the street has a much better burger. I wasnt really impressed with the burger at BTs. If you are going to do one thing, do it well.",UNK
8882,"The food is still great. The service is going to pot. Orders never happen or you get the wrong item. Once I complete my stamp card, Kaya is coming off my list.",UNK
8883,Service was very good. Food was expensive for what it was. Not a great value in my opinion.,UNK
8884,Worst service. The cashier was trying to make the mcflurry and knew it was running out of mix. Instead of just telling me we are low on mix she gave me half a cup! Never again.,UNK
8885,"Food was just okay. Definitely not worth their prices when there are so many other delicious options in the area.  Heard so many good things, but just didn't live up to the hype.",UNK
8886,The fish tacos are good but must eat them there. Rice was great. Everything else was just okay.,UNK
8887,Didn't eat here for the all you can eat! Place is alright! Next time I'll have to do all you can eat! Just went here for soup.,UNK
8888,"They did an OK job on my car. We got it detailed. But it took almost 2.5 hours when we were originally told 1, and they still left some stuff dirty. But I could tell they were working hard.",UNK
8889,1&1/2 hours waiting in line to get to the counter . Unacceptable will rent with one of the other companies next trip to Las Vegas,UNK
8890,I thought the sandwich was somewhat overpriced for the amount of turkey and condiments added. The turkey appeared  processed and slices were not fresh cut. That's my opinion anyway I probably will find a different deli instead next time!,UNK
8891,it was okay ..not sure i'd go again with all the other Mexican options out there.,UNK
8892,"Nothing special here. The \""latest shinny object\"" in the world of restaurants.  Three stars for effort!",UNK
8893,"I tried the pomegranate yogurt and it tasted pretty good :) but even though the place is wide and nicely decorated, it's pretty dirty, it would be nice if they wipe and sweep the place.  They have 2 computers with internet too.",UNK
8894,"The cashier Khong needs to be bitch slapped... If she wants to be in the service industry, she NEEDS a total attitude adjustment. One star for the guy who made the drinks. Keep the nasty attitude up and you will see more reviews like this...shaking head!",UNK
8895,"Dirty, Dirty, Dirty.....will not be returning.",UNK
8896,"This place is closed, and for good reason.",UNK
8897,"Its yogurt, about 12 flavors. Nice and clean place.",UNK
8898,worst service experience! I ever had  owner was rude and food was LATE cold pizza is no good,UNK
8899,Once again delish!  The breakfast burrito with a fruit side...perfect for late lunch!\nLove love love you guys!,UNK
8900,Giving this place only 2 stars only because this is the 2nd time we have tried to come for dinner and they were closed! Hours of operation are till 10:00pm! It's only 7:30pm. The food is really good but this is a good way to lose business.,UNK
8901,"i just finished eating a burrito from this spot. i dumped out nearly all of the chicken... if the saying, 'you are what you eat' is true then i am so fuckckin nasty.",UNK
8902,"Pretty good lunch. I ordered two enchiladas and tortilla soup. I filled my enchiladas with bison and pork and chose the \""hybrid\"" tortilla. Everything was good, but nothing to write home about.",UNK
8903,"been going here for many years.  seems a bit hit or miss with what they have in stock that morning/afternoon, and the quality, but it's always eatable :)\n\nMy favorite is the Devil Dogs and the Rainbow Cookies!!!",UNK
8904,Is there a dress code for the post office psi test? I dont know if im supposed to come in dress to impress or not.,UNK
8905,I had teriyaki wings...sauce very salty.  Hubby had steak burrito with green sauce - sauce had way too much flour cause that was all you could taste.  Service OK.  Probably won't go back.  My favorite wing place closed :(,UNK
8906,"Soggy Texas Toast.  Tough ribs.  Poured on BBQ sauce.  WAY overpriced.  I would pay these prices at Lucilles, but definitely not here.  Will not return.",UNK
8907,"I'm a fan but it used to be better before the renovation. They used to have the best ribs I've ever had, no longer.  Marginally worth it now.",UNK
8908,"Went back for another lunch a week ago and the quality had dropped so far down that we will not be back. The server was good and attentive, but the food was not tasty or attractive.",UNK
8909,"Needless to say, this hotel is one of the older buildings on the block. If you have stayed anywhere else on the Strip, STAY THERE. The only props I gave was the poolside band, King B. They are off the chain. But that may be the alcohol talking.",UNK
8910,This is the most expensive goodwill I have ever been to. Prices are double that of other Goodwills.,UNK
8911,Tasted like a frozen dinner. Tiny portions. $100+ per person. Awful. Service was confrontational and rude.,UNK
8912,"Not very good costumer service, came in and got the wrong hookah e-liquid and came back for exchange and they will not accept it. It's a simple mistake and easy fix but they will not help out, not recommended.",UNK
8913,"Cupcakes were good. Nothing special though. They are very dry, and this is at least after trying them several times. A box of Duncan Hines delivers a better cupcake!",UNK
8914,"i asked them to please wipe down my back seat, a simple request, i was told sure, was not done.  they didn't empty my trash bag that i have hanging near the glovebox, my windshield was still not clean.  not the best place just convenient.",UNK
8915,"I think Fresh & easy should go to Trader Joes and learn how to set up a little market. They have very little to offer and use their space terribly. No wonder they are closing so many stores. Besides from there sales they are also overpriced, but the employees are very nice.",UNK
8916,Update: now its colder and the songs are shittier but i keep going.,UNK
8917,Just called for reservations was told to call back they were busy. Wow really that's how you treat customers? Thank goodness there are soo many other great options -restaurants who understand what good customer service is,UNK
8918,"Wow u ppl please never ever go and shop at this plc ever! They lied to me and were the rudest any plc can be,  I can not even go over the story with u frieands but please do u a fav and DO NOT SHOP there!",UNK
8919,"Goodness gracious get a server that understands English! Wrong seating, wrong drinks, and last straw.. Wrong order!!! Ridiculous how oblivious they are as to why they are going out of business!",UNK
8920,"It's Vegas, so it's expensive, but this was something way below par. Great selection on paper but in person, very bland.",UNK
8921,Beer wasn't great and the menu was pretty lame... I expected a much better menu. Very disapointing. Gordon beirsch looks like fine dinning in comparison... I won't be back.,UNK
8922,"In my opinion, Duke is destroying the environment in North Carolina as well as other states it operates in. The Dan River will never be the same and due to owning several politicians, they only cleaned up a fraction of the coal ash they spilled into the River.",UNK
8923,Rude owners and overpriced food.  $35 for two very ordinary salads and drinks at lunchtime???,UNK
8924,food was good but the service needs to be more polish. I know its a good restaurant but the servers need training. Food is good and always ask for fresh salsa..,UNK
8925,"Overrated. I prefer the buffet at Aria, plus they have better desserts.",UNK
8926,Really great food but poor staff female manager if that's what you want to call her was very rude and male manager at bar drinking how professional is that but if I was to go back it be for the food only!,UNK
8927,"service was very slow and it wasn't that busy. I had an omelette it was ok but the single piece of toast was dry and over toasted, my friend had pancakes and loved them.\nGroupon made it better",UNK
8928,"This place is hit or miss for me.  Good location, great looking women working there but food is never outstanding.  But if you want to have fun and be seen then this a place to go.",UNK
8929,"Horrible!!! Waited over an hour just to check in.The forgot my wake-up call, the staff was rude. Would NOT recommend.",UNK
8930,"Good brunch fare, nice atmosphere, and trendy decor. Service was friendly and attentive, food was good, lacked a little seasoning. Will return.",UNK
8931,Nice people.  Quick service.  Okay subs.,UNK
8932,"On a subsequent visit, the shakes arrived promptly, the food also.  The waitress was also nicer/better then our first visit.  I had the wisconsin buttery, which was yummy.",UNK
8933,Not very personable. Food was the same price as a full restaurant but all you get is a few tables and hard chairs. Don't eat in! Food was good but the price was a bit on the high side,UNK
8934,Relatively good Autozone located conveniently to my home. They have ok service and are pretty well stocked in all the regular merchandise necessary. The parking is nice as well. There are plenty of spots. Easy access too.,UNK
8935,"The only thing ive ordered here is a ruben sandwich and it was okay, I guess they have better things than this so I will try something else next time.",UNK
8936,"Same thing as Dennys at almost twice the price. Marginally decent food and service.  It was clean and food was pretty quick, even with a nearly full restaurant. Parking is horrendous when all the places there are busy.",UNK
8937,"This place was good, but just good. Happy hour sucks bad and the sushi rolls could be bigger for the price you are paying but over all the sushi was very good .",UNK
8938,Service was terrible the management was rude and not worth the wait or the bad experience,UNK
8939,"Ugly exterior. Nicer than expected interior. Stay here as cheaper get away experience, does the job I suppose. Didn't stay here, visited a friend. That's pretty it.",UNK
8940,Sat at the pool for an hour without a server coming by. Had to go to the bar and order food and drinks. Oscar...the Spa Manager...was not helpful at all with a problem we had at the spa. Terrible customer service.,UNK
8941,Retracted,UNK
8942,"Went here with some friends and was not familiar with the menu.  The order counter seemed confusing to me too. Got a turkey sandwich,  but think they used miracle whip not mayo.  Not a fan though.",UNK
8943,"you get what you pay for, beef and broccoli was good but pho barely had any meat.\nStill good for being a small place, very clean!",UNK
8944,Had this for lunch one day before work - bad move. I was totally useless all afternoon as I felt like I had a brick of acid eating away at my stomach lining.,UNK
8945,Doesn't rate one star. To say food was horrible is being kind. We ate there after ironman to celebrate  and this was ruined by the disgusting food. Made us sick. Never again. Other maycayos were good.,UNK
8946,Great location. Okay food. Kinda overpriced.,UNK
8947,Popular cafe well situated and offering a good spot for people watching on George IV Bridge. Only consumed a pot of tea and a Danish pastry but it was pretty chilled and the service was prompt despite that fact that it was practically full. On this evidence I'd visit again.,UNK
8948,"They stop making decaf at 12. So I was told, that's odd since you would figure a lot of people don't want caffeine later in the day. Oh well. It is what it is.",UNK
8949,Not all you can eat. Sushi was ok.,UNK
8950,Wanted to like this place. Staff very friendly. Reasonable prices. Quick service. \nBut plates were dirty. Table dirty. Food just OK.,UNK
8951,Food is good and they have an abundance.  A little pricey though.,UNK
8952,Took way too long for delivery.  Food was decent.  Crab Ragoons were delicious.,UNK
8953,"Food and service are average quality. Dining in offers very little ambiance, but it works for decent take out.",UNK
8954,"I didn't eat here, just walked in and tried to sit down at lunch time. The people were nasty so we walked out. Plus there's a $50 minimum per person. Gotta give it to 'em - they went all the way with the ridiculous minimum.",UNK
8955,"Atmosphere is nice, food is over priced for the quality. The customer service is really good. Fresh squeezed orange juice.",UNK
8956,Not impressed. Too many ghetto people flock to this location. Felt like I was partying with the Bridge and Tunnel crowd,UNK
8957,Really cool atmosphere but the food was just ok and borderline bland.  While I won't go out of my way to eat here again I wouldn't be opposed to give it a second chance.  I will definitely be back for drinks.,UNK
8958,"like all the other reviewers said, only go there for the drive thru car wash.  Everything else is a scam.",UNK
8959,Unfortunately the last two of the five times I've ordered food from here there has been a hair in my food. After the second time I can't bring myself to go back!,UNK
8960,I'm not impressed. Service was slow. I got the new sweet potato fries they were under cooked & overly salty. The new sweet corn cake was just ok. The chicken was the only semi-decent part of the meal. I won't be coming back.,UNK
8961,"Mushrooms on the pizza was so burned.  It turned off my appetite. I mentioned to the waitress and all she said was \"" oh, really? \"" not even a sorry.\nThat pizza ruined my last meal of vacation in Phoenix.",UNK
8962,"unreliable delivery, one time pizza is great, next tme its cold and wilted.  Not sure I will ever order from here again.  I called to complain, and the manager asked, \"" is that it?\"" lol",UNK
8963,"No sushi menu, no back support at table, place is small. Food was good and service quick, will not be returning because of no sushi and back hurt 5 min into dinner",UNK
8964,Went in for a perm and the people were very rude. It is in a hidden out of the way location. Maybe the chain headquarters put it there on purpose. Hide the worst people in an area where no one will visit!,UNK
8965,"Disappointed. ordered the recommended spicy fish head, however it's smelly.. The owner denied it ...And even got charged for the dish... Overpriced!!!",UNK
8966,Boo... This place is not here anymore.,UNK
8967,"Cool place to stop in and check out. Grab a beer and relax. However it took over a hour for cheeseburger sliders... Seems way to long to wait! Hope they get the kitchen speed faster, otherwise it's a good place",UNK
8968,"slow service, even after told server we had a time constraint, salad was soggy, enchiladas were hastily thrown together.  Ugh.  A sandwich from the cooler would have been a better choice.",UNK
8969,"after a few beers at the mason lounge, we stopped into falbo bros. and ordered a pizza for carry out. there were only three of us in the store but for some reason it took forever to get our order. their pizza is decent, but they need to speed it up.",UNK
8970,"Good sandwiches, good deli meats, but very overpriced.",UNK
8971,The food was okay nothing really special on the buffet menu. Fast and friendly service though is nice.,UNK
8972,Took this firm four tries to fix my air conditioner last July.  Wouldn't have cared except for the 115 degree temperatures at that time.  Would recommend avoiding this firm at all costs.,UNK
8973,Horrible the waiter frank made us feel so uncomfortable with his comments. He was obviously drunk and was embarrassed us trying to get pretty girls to take pics. Creepy! We will never return,UNK
8974,"We drive by this strip mall frequently so thought we'd try Tosinos.  Completely forgettable, average food that tastes like it might have been frozen.  We won't be back.  I recommend you drive up Power to McKillips and eat at Senior Tacos instead.",UNK
8975,Decent food. They add a $2 restaurant fee which I've never heard of at a sit down restaurant like that. Waiter was really nice and the beers were cold. Very pricey.,UNK
8976,"This place was decent but crazy busy!  Interesting with the J.K. Rowling history... we just happened to be walking by and hungry.  If you're going at a peak time, get ready for a wait.",UNK
8977,We only come here for two reasons.\n1. To pregame \n2. To play Buck Hunt.,UNK
8978,Zumanity burger\nCajun salmon burger\nLong wait for food\nSoggy fries\nBurgers were good\nPickle is good,UNK
8979,Super greasy. Sadly I prefer dominoes. Over priced in my opinion as well.,UNK
8980,It's one of those weird stores that has a little bit of everything that you need.  I needed beef jerky and a sewing kit.  I got both.,UNK
8981,"I went from saying \""Thank god it's Friday\"" to saying \""this is the worst diarrhea I've ever had\"" on Saturday.",UNK
8982,"Interior design is nice. Had the pho and so far this is the best place for pho, except for at home.",UNK
8983,Fish was decent a little warm for my taste. Service is good. I feel with the business they do that they can upgrade some of their products such as buying better soy sauce then higher quality of fish.,UNK
8984,"Decent food, it reminded us of wedding catering and the interior was pretty generic.  It's not terrible, but not really worth the price or trip.",UNK
8985,"The best fast food I know of. Maybe Chipotle, as well. Staff is always friendly. I'm not from here but this place is very Wisconsin-y to me, in a food way.\n\nGood chili.",UNK
8986,Took these people 5 hours to put 2 rear brake pads on my car. Could've shown my child how to do it faster. Only good part was family feud was on the TV the whole time. Never again,UNK
8987,I walked in and the workers walked past me and never greeted our party. I had to finally ask to get help. Then I find out the all you can eat is limited to one hr. Not worth my time.,UNK
8988,The pho was good but I had better. The workers are nice and attentive.,UNK
8989,"These people are rude sometimes they gets things done, but horrible customer service !! Never go here!\n\nThey charge hefty fees without telling you anything.\n\nDo not ever go here!",UNK
8990,"The coffee is terrible, I was really hoping this place would be a little gem. Not the case. I love supporting local coffee shops, but my latte was poorly made and tasted like warm milk more than espresso. My girlfriend ordered a cold brew coffee, her experience was the same.",UNK
8991,I came here once and my experience was just like the rest of the reviewers; my car came out clean but it was a barrage of up-sell nightmares. These guys must be awful at bars with the way get rejected over and over and never get the hint. Not coming back.,UNK
8992,Tried using the online order store pickup with the hopes of increased efficiency.  fail.,UNK
8993,"Went here because my father n law wanted Mexican food. We were in the area, so why not try it. Food was great but way over priced. Don't think I'll be going here again.",UNK
8994,"I came by this location right before closing time to order a bunch of fried chicken for my friends.  They were out of a lot of stuff, but the guy was nice enough to throw in what he could.  Chicken was delicious, though.  Worth the drive over the KFC that was around the corner.",UNK
8995,"My new favorite off the strip casino. Has it all, good food, bowling, movies...",UNK

9006,By far the worst food I have ever had!!!!,UNK
9007,All the sandwiches taste the same to me which is strange. Unlikely I'll go back. If you're in the area and are looking for a quick bite this place is fine other than that... keep on moving.,UNK

9014,I came here when I first moved to Vegas needing a quick haircut. You get what you paid for is the lesson I learned. Service sucked the entire time. The hairdresser had this glub attitude about him. Avoid at all costs.,UNK
9015,"Not acceptable for a place that specializes in burgers to fry them.  I don't think they use the best beef either.  However, their turkey burger is really good.  Only burger I will eat there.",UNK
9016,Hostess process sucked. They were very rude this morning. How many times do I have to give my name?  How much longer do I have to wait for my reservation?,UNK
9017,Not the best service in town!!,UNK
9018,"this place was okay, not as good as miami.  the crabs were definitely frozen and stuff, i can get that in queens, no need to get in vegas.  if u want the stonecrabs, just go to miami for the real thing.",UNK

9022,"Avoid this company, they will rip you off!  I had a horrible experience and when I tried to report this I was continuously ignored.  They care very little about customer serivce, their prices are high, and their products are average at best.  You can do better elsewhere!",UNK
9023,I was disappointed.   My shrimp showed signs of freezer burn.  Not up to the standard i expect from Bubba Gump.,UNK
9024,Average McDonald's chain.,UNK
9025,115 for 1st offenders... Talking and driving. Good thing it wasn't me LOL\n\nOH just a heads up. The law enforcement people near the x-ray area are not very nice people,UNK
9026,"Always love the all-you-can-eat from 2pm-9pm. We just visit this place for this reason, had they not have this kind of promo, we're not going to waffle house. Staff are generally accommodating.",UNK
9027,Don't plan on being treated very well. The hostess staff could care less about you when you arrive. They are just there to have poor attitudes and here cattle. Save yourself the trip and go somewhere else.,UNK
9028,Completely tasteless broth... maybe it was water.\n\nGo to Lemongrass down the street.\n\nVery dissapointing.,UNK
9029,Not that great of a job and took forever!,UNK
9030,Ended up here when other nearby places had a long wait and we were quite hungry. Should have taken into account that there was nobody eating in this place. Food was just kind of blah and the service was lacking both inspiration and perspiration.,UNK

9035,"I think this is the most expensive in Wickenburg for breakfast.  2 people normal meal; eggs, bacon, hash browns and toast $25.  Go to Cowboy Cafe - service is slow as molasses but same food for $15.",UNK

9041,took awhile. must explore the rest of the menu. cool vibe. zucchini bread was spicier than i was expecting.,UNK
9042,We went with high hopes. We were seated and waited 20 minutes (no exaggeration) without anyone coming to our table. We tried to get the attention of the waitress as she passed and she actually looked the other way. I We ended up leaving without even being able to try it.,UNK
9043,"Ugh the sushi is terrible here!! There is no flavor and its dry! I have had tons of experience with sushi...the good, the bad, the food poisoning!!",UNK

9048,"I try to avoid this particular store unless I can run in and get what I need and go through the self check out.  The lines are always incredibly long, the customer service is nonexistent and there is a general attitude of apathy.  Shelves in the grocery section often have gaping holes.",UNK
9049,Panda Express quality food at 4 times the price.,UNK
9050,"I just don't get this place.  The atmosphere is trying to be upscale, the desserts look upscale, but they simply don't taste all that great to me.  Totally not worth the money.",UNK
9051,Love the waffle house but the one baseline sucks.  We waited suck a long time ended up leaving and went to Denny's.   I would recommend not going to the one on baseline.,UNK

9053,"Sesame Salmon was ok and so were the mashed potatoes but the side of fried spinach was completely pointless, tasteless and very oily. Will come back to try other items though",UNK
9054,"Hit or miss. They carry great designer brands, large shoe sizes, large selection of women's denim, but my only complaint is I rarely can find a top or blouse that suits me. I also like that there are plenty of fitting rooms with friendly attendants.",UNK
9055,"I got the three fish and three shrimp the last week. (Fired)  Shrimp was ok, fish was really good. Today we got two of the three fish meals, was over cooked. Not sure if we will go again. Both times the meals were take out.",UNK
9056,Meh. I've experienced better. Honestly this place is overpriced. At 18 dollars a person I felt I had been ripped off! Seriously took less than 30 minutes to walk the whole thing!  I d rather walk the aquarium aisle at Walmart then come to this place again.,UNK
9057,Nothing to write home about. Ok service. Ok food.,UNK

9059,The paella is just fine but the steak is good.,UNK
9060,"They were ok at first but when I went in for a very personal screening after I found out some things about my spouse, my doctor came off very judgmental and I felt very uncomfortable. Turned out everything was fine..but I never went back and never will.",UNK

9065,"What a waste of money! Had the Classic Steampot, the shrimp were small and just wasn't worth the money. Service was good",UNK
9066,Food is OK but not quality and quality could be better. My biggest complaint is no one ever answers the phone when trying to order take out.  Not worth the money.,UNK

9069,Service was very poor. Food was not that great,UNK
9070,"Restaurant looked clean, staff was friendly, and price was pretty good. That being said the sesame chicken was so-so.  It was somewhat spongy for my taste and the fried rice was not what I expected.  I would probably not come here again for that item.",UNK
9071,"Finally found something I liked! But only one thing.  This store is super crammed, to get by someone, you both literally have to smash up against the clothing racks. Very annoying.",UNK
9072,The service was not any good but the pizza was delicious! Just get it to go!,UNK
9073,"I have been here one time before, when they first opened. It was pretty decent tho  rather expensive for breakfast. This particular time my food was very very salty and my biscuits and gravy were lukewarm at best. A bit of a bummer.",UNK
9074,"Extremely disappointing!!! We were a table of four and it took well over an hour after we placed our order. What's worse is it was not worth the wait. Portions are small, price ridiculous, flavor bland. It was a complete bust.",UNK
9075,"Good margarita, but left due to the awful (really awful), music.",UNK
9076,The door says it closes at 9:00.  But it is closed at 8:30.  Must be in a different time zone....,UNK

9083,I have made 5 calls - left three messages. No response and no one was able to help me until i demanded a manager.,UNK
9084,Its aight.  Nothing interesting about it.  No one was in line = bad food.  It's your average wrap fast food chain.,UNK
9085,"Not even going to have a chance to try it.  I can understand having a small menu, but to not even offer ground beef tacos, rules out a lot of people.  No thanks.  You can keep your small menu, and I'll stick with Tacos n More.",UNK
9086,Yummy! I liked the buffalo chicken wrap with spicy ranch dressing you get it on the side...!,UNK
9087,"This  one  star  is  meant  to  be  a  negative  one:   I   made  an  appointment  with this  company  and  they  gave  me  a  3  hour  window.  Drove  to  the  property,  waited  for  over  4  hours,  nobody  showed  up,  nobody  even  called  to  explain  why  or  to  apologize.  This  company  sucks.",UNK

9092,Good eats and decent prices,UNK
9093,"This place is absolutely terrible. We ordered yam fries and the yam was RAW. Salad is stale and burger is way too salty. Not just their kitchen doesn't know how to cook,  they also have no fresh ingredient. Will never come back.",UNK
9094,Terrible customer service-We come here for lunch for protein shakes and today they will not take our money and let us get a drink.  They should at least be consistent. And another reason we are not members here-too crowded and not much training going on. It's like a nightclub.,UNK
9095,Great happy hour and decent food.  Always a fun crowd.,UNK
9096,"Food is good but do not come if you are in a rush. The staff are nice but cannot multitask or are drastically under staffed. The walk from the Rio, sober, is a lot longer than it seems.",UNK
9097,I thought the brunch was just okay. The french toast was overcooked and the sausage patties were dry. I was starving so I ate it all anyway. I'd give it less stars if it weren't for the great outside dining area.,UNK
9098,"Poor service ask for water 3 times and never got it.they charge extra for ranch dressing 60 cents so be careful. had 3 different types of wings Ultra one in one basket and could not tell which was which. they need a lot more staff training , would not return for at least 6 months.",UNK
9099,I was delayed at this airport and I must say I was really happy to see a spa there. I got a 20 minute massage for $30 and it was worth every minute.,UNK
9100,"I ordered the fish tacos, and they were VERY bland. It was like eating air, accept that I paid for it. The waiter was super friend and on top of things though!",UNK

9102,"Ick, Sorry, I did give you 2 stars for politeness.  Food was awful!!",UNK
9103,Ordered a pepperoni pizza.  The crust is thicker and the sauce was a little sweet.,UNK
9104,"This place is pretty great.  A Pittsburgh staple.  However, I would definitely recommend the Market Square location.  More beers on tap, nice outdoor seating, better atmosphere overall.",UNK
9105,Slow service and the $10 bowl of tomato soup may as well been Campbell's :( disappointing!,UNK
9106,The ramen is okay (not as good as I thought it would be). The fried rice is better than the noodles.,UNK
9107,"Poor selection with overpriced hair products. I could name a million other phx hair stores that blow this one out of the water when it comes to selection and pricing. Cute decor, but that's about it.",UNK
9108,"Way too crowded. Extremely expensive. Nothing special here, just like any other club on the Vegas strip",UNK
9109,"Good basic American food. The prime rib is tasty, tender and juicy. They serve it with a horseradish sauce upon request.",UNK

9115,"The food is pretty good. I got the greek salad with grilled chicken, which is $10.50. Its just too expensive for fast food.",UNK
9116,Target corp needs to take a look at this location. It's way past its prime. Feels more like a Walmart. I suggest you Yelp for another Target in your area and stay away from this one.,UNK
9117,Service was horrible our waitress was jackie food is good everything took forever to get to the table and people sat down after us and ordered more food and got the food and drinks before us,UNK
9118,Horrible customer service had a receipt and wanted to exchange something like I was told I could they told me they needed the complete original packaging which was a piece of cardboard way overpriced also,UNK

9120,There was a  cockroach crawling inside the glass where the candy and shell are.   French vanilla was stale and just nasty.   Do not know if this is locally owned or not but they need to do something.  Bad all around,UNK

9126,"I'm giving three stars because the treadmill in the fitness center did not work nor did the high speed internet in my room. But, thanks for having a sleep mask and ear plugs. My roommates were serious snorers! The lavender sheet spray was also a plus.",UNK
9127,Possibly the worst Starbucks i have ever been too..  Manager speaks over costumer and has about zero knowledge of customer service ...,UNK
9128,"The waitress we had here was horrible.  The bus boy gave us more attention than she did.  I say give him her job!  The food was OK nothing spectacular, a little over priced, but you are paying for the ambiance I guess.",UNK
9129,A show you can count on for some great laughs.  Carrot Top has tons of funny props and sound effects.  I would recommend it.,UNK
9130,I don't always feel safe coming here but it's pretty big and there's a lot of electronic stuff.  They usually have pretty good deals but I would still shop around for the big ticket stuff.,UNK
9131,Their side dishes have very little flavor.,UNK

9143,"Great place to hang out especially on the weekends, but sometimes it's very hard to get into if you don't either live/stay there or have a table reserved.  Have fun waiting in line if neither of those applies to you.",UNK

9150,"We tried calling to make reservations this past Saturday, there were no greetings and the mailbox was full. So we got in the car and drove down there to find the place was all locked up at 6:00 PM. Didn't see any notices posted. \nWe were saddened.",UNK
9151,"This was a no frills cheap buffet, with surprisingly decent food and quality.  You wont find anything special here but it was better than eating in the food court. Prices are pretty low as well.",UNK

9160,"This restaurant is very nice on the inside but the Mexican food is definitely not the best I've had.  I don't think I would call this place bad, but there is nothing special or desirable about it.  I would avoid weekends because it gets busy and the food is not as good.",UNK
9161,Stopped in for a pint.  Had some pizza (was OK) and hit another place.,UNK

9170,Rude and careless staff. No sense of urgency or customer service. Little attention to detail. Do yourself a favor and drive a few extra miles to save a lot of time and aggravation.,UNK
9171,Everything has gone downhill at this location. Most recently we ordered a kids cheese crisp which was clearly microwaved. The worst part was watching the bus boy sweeping the floor and then the seats of the booths. I don't even want to checkin for my last visit.,UNK
9172,"Used to be a good neighborhood spot.  They've changed the menu, got rid of mini pitchers, and brought in a line of terrible local brews.  Service is bad now too.   Won't be back.",UNK

9176,It's good pizza but I think it's totally overrated and over priced.,UNK
9177,"It's pointless to post photos of your menu in lieu oftyping out the full menu, when the pics are blurry and unreadable. I wanted to order some food in my New neighborhood but I can't see your menu:(",UNK
9178,Food was good. Margaritas were weak. Service was absolutely terrible - perhaps the worst service I have ever experienced at any restaurant. The party at the next table appeared to agree - they got up and left after ordering their dinner. I would never recommend this restaurant and will never go again.,UNK
9179,Lieu un peu trop bruyant \u00e0 mon gout mais excellente poutine ! Les cocktails ont l'air top !,UNK
9180,Love your pizza but the service is BAD.  Management needs to keep an eye on the service.  There are a thousand pizza places in the valley and when dining in service is important.,UNK
9181,"Poor service, food is overpriced and not good at all. Don't waste your money in this joint",UNK
9182,"Love the clothes, but refuse to shop there due to the horribly snotty service I receive....",UNK
9183,This restaurant is closed. It has reopened under new owners with a new name.,UNK
9184,"This concept makes a lot of sense.  A quick pizza at a reasonable price.  Choose a pizza off their menu or create your own.  My creation had sausage, olives and basil and it was delicious if I do say so myself.",UNK
9185,"Cupcakes were dry and low on flavor. I prefer at least \""natural\"" food, so the bright colors pretty much scared me. You'd think that even with all the artificiality these would be high on flavor, but lacked it.",UNK
9186,The bar was crammed but clean and the waitresses were super friendly and accommodating.  I'm sure we will be back next year. The bloody mary's are super great!,UNK
9187,"The gyro pita was ok. Not a lot of flavor, though. We also had the chicken pita which my girl said was pretty good. The fries were super and the babaganoush was interesting. Great service.",UNK
9188,Pretty cool sushi just slightly expensive.,UNK
9189,"As of 7/23/08 this location is closed.  It is being turned into a new business, a Korean fusion style restaurant.  According to the new owner, the business shut down about 6 months ago.",UNK
9190,"Tried to over charge us for dental work that is not necessary! Beware of this if you go there. Nice staff but after a second opinion, our child does not need $1800 worth of dental work. It may be worth getting a second opinion.",UNK
9191,"We were a group of 6 for lunch.  3 had burgers, 1 calamari, and 2 had pizza.  Total bill was $117 without alcohol .  Food was very good, just over priced.  I did not like that the server added a 18% tip automatically.  Would have given 20%.",UNK
9192,Just had fathers day lunch and everything was great. Kids meals came quick to keep them occupied and the server gave my husband a BJs pint glass as a fathers day gift. Great food and a nice family atmosphere.,UNK
9193,"I got crazy bread from this stupid place and they didnt give me any sauce! What a waste of my time, gas, and money. Im hungry and cant even eat these dry ass bread sticks without sauce. Dumb.",UNK
9194,"Food is just good, not great. Vanilla custard French toast is good. Omelets are a little bland. Corn beef hash was sweet and spicy...it is made in house.",UNK
9195,Worst customer service..!! If you plan to open an account don't believe it will take 15 minutes to be helped. It's actually more like an hour..!!,UNK
9196,"This location does not match my previous experience on quality. Meatballs were full of filler. Tomato sauce was bland. Buca's is a place I use to rave about, Italian like Mom makes, but no more and not in las Vegas. Very disappointed.",UNK
9197,"Don't waste your money on here, go somewhere else.",UNK
9198,My second visit here hamburg is ok  my fries probable fry twice feel grease and old . I went 3pm no rush hour. I don't recommend,UNK
9199,The W is nice but the rooms are tiny and every time you open the patio door the AC turns off.  The staff was ok.  It's simply ok.,UNK
9200,Food was good .. Service was terrible. We waited almost an hour for our food then another 20 for our check. Will not be back .,UNK
9201,Joe's is a great spot for late night pizza.  It is about the closest to NY style you can find in Vegas.  I would not recommend the fried brownies.,UNK
9202,When you ask for HOT it means hot. Not take it home and add more hot sauce and sriracha... WTH?,UNK
9203,"It was fine, but it isn't the kind of place I normally go for lunch.  The food was a little out there for my taste.",UNK
9204,"I was not impressed. We went for an oil change because it was close by, but the oil change took 2 hours. The man working inside was nice, but gave us no explanation as to what was taking so long. Will not be returning.",UNK
9205,"First time ordering from here.  Looking for a good Chinese restaurant.  Food was good but delivery took an hour and a half!  If I order from here again, I'll just pick it up.",UNK
9206,Great beer specials but it's always over crowded and very noisy. It would be an awesome place if they could somehow do better crowd control. Pretty sure the fire marshal wouldn't be thrilled to see the sea of humanity within.,UNK
9207,It's closed at 7 am now .... So don't count on it to be open that early any more.\n\nThree stars are for whole foods' being amazing.,UNK
9208,"Five Guys is Five Guys.  Simple, friendly, delicious, inexpensive.  Perfect for a quick burger and fries, and the staff is always friendly.",UNK
9209,Friday at 11:45am ... out of Regular Salted Pretzels.\n\n... I cried a little.,UNK
9210,"For the price, too many interruptions during the meal. But hey, that's their claim to fame, right?  And the food's not that good.",UNK
9211,I was a little disappointed. My room kind of sucked and the hotel service was a little off. We had fun gambling here and there is a really fun bar to get the night started but all in all I don't plan in stating here again.,UNK
9212,"Cozy and dim lighting. Food is okay - large quantities for take-out, watch out!",UNK
9213,"The food is pretty good, but honestly feels like your a burden to the staff. Drinks were empty the entire meal. Had to flag server down for service.",UNK
9214,There is a restroom butler! Really! Is that necessary in an airport? With a tip jar? Or was this the high end VIP lounge? Huge distances between gates. For a connecting airport this is a tight race. Short notice on change of gate notifications.,UNK
9215,This place isn't all that but there food is OK.  There are better Chinese options for the price (try Chinese Cultural Center restaurants).  The restaurant itself is well furnished and clean but I can't get over the fact that people rave about this place.,UNK
9216,"The pool is by far the best on the strip , unfortunately the location of the hotel is far from everything , the do have the tram but I prefer walking .",UNK
9217,Definitely worth a visit. A lot like Efes in food style. I wish the bread was more pita-esque. Personal preference of mine. A little disconcerting at the bottom of the plate when everyone's bare-knuckling it into the grub.,UNK
9218,"Wasn't a fan of their signature sauces. We had a little bit of everything., the ribs were tender, brisket tasted overstocked. The food was just okay to me. I liked the environment and the hospitality.",UNK
9219,"Pho tasted blain, no flavor . Not good at all. \nYou can't split the bill, ok I can accept that but the service was horrible.",UNK
9220,"Folding chairs, actual metal folding chairs, like from the 80's. Some sections have the typical chairs, but a few (including section J, for example) are made up entirely of folding chairs.",UNK
9221,"Surprised by how dirty the place is today. The floor looks a mess, the trash needs changed out. It isn't like the same place I come to when the owner is here. So can't wait to get my washer and dryer for the house.",UNK
9222,Not crazy about this place.,UNK
9223,"Perfectly fine dim sum.  I arrived at the end of the dim sum service, but everything I ate was fine.  Unfortunately there are limited lunch options at the Bellagio at 2:30, so I decided to try Noodles.  Will try it again for the regular menu.",UNK
9224,"For as expensive as it is, I expected something better.  \nIt's very pretty and it's in a great location on the strip but for the price you pay for a room, I expected to be IMPRESSED and I wasn't.",UNK
9225,Nice place to have a quick lunch before hanging out at the pool.  The chinese chopped salad was very nice.,UNK
9226,"Like Ians, I just don't get this place. The service at times is surly and confusing.  The pizza is extremely cheap and quite good. They have a wide selection of after-bar fried foods.  Otherwise there isn't anything very exciting about Pizza Di Roma.",UNK
9227,"Food was good but not great.  For the prices, the food should be amazing.  However, they did have tasty pretzel bread.  But def not planning to go back.",UNK
9228,"went to this buffet tonight and it was not good at all.  Options were very limited, and there were no premium items other than prime rib.  I will not return.",UNK
9229,Service is great! But we went home hungry after spending almost $60! Very expensive and very small portions! Nothing special.,UNK
9230,A bit pricey for overcooked eggs and undercooked bacon.,UNK
9231,Usually I love this place but I ordered ahead & told the time I would be in. Not sure when they put my burger on the bar but it was all cold & very disappointing. Ah well.,UNK
9232,We visited Verona Chophouse on Valentines Day. The food was good. That was all that was good. That is all.,UNK
9233,"Solid, inexpensive pizza. It's our go-to when we're looking for something quick and tasty. The chicken parmesan is made with frozen store-bought chicken patties... obviously not as good as fresh (or worth 4 stars), but still delicious.",UNK
9234,I really liked the lighting in this place really wasn't a fan of the music which was main stream rap not to mention this club was really small it was like a club in a living room.,UNK
9235,"A lot of people around here love this place.  Its not bad,  I just think there is better out there.  I think some additional sauce options would help.",UNK
9236,"Pretty basic. The food isn't amazing and it's not horrible either. If you're looking for nourishment, GO. One plus is the atmosphere. If you eat in the back part of the restaurant, you're surrounded by windows so that's pretty cool.",UNK
9237,"In terms of fast food pizza, Howie's is probably my drug of choice. Their prices are fair and the flavored crusts are pretty good. I also like the sandwiches or maybe a greek salad if I'm feeling lazy but want something a bit more green.",UNK
9238,Business switched names.  Now Five R Cha Thai.  Will do update review under their new name.,UNK
9239,In town for the weekend and trying to adjust my schedule from EST. Decided to get the Vietnamese Coffee to wake me up. It woke me up but very disappointed with the portion. I finished my coffee and 3/4 of the cup full with ice.,UNK
9240,"If I could eat the pepper jack mac and cheese all day long, I would. I get it every time I go. The sandwiches are pretty good too. It's got a great, laid back atmosphere where you can get pretty decent bar food and a have a beer or two.",UNK
9241,Iced coffee was okay. Service was terrible.,UNK
9242,My wife had the tuna sandwich and I had a roast beef sandwich.  They both tasted awful.  They go out of their way to be distinctive with different ingredients but we prefer the basic sandwiches and didn't care for these at all.  Left without eating most of them.,UNK
9243,Good cut.  Took her time.,UNK
9244,Not much to say. They got me on a Groupon.  The waitress was nice.,UNK
9245,"Cheap, feels dirty, and quality is just not there. The only plus side is that it's on the strip and really connected to the surrounding area, and the stores on the second level.",UNK
9246,Not bad for a chain.,UNK
9247,Lots and lots of furniture. didn't see anything I liked my first visit some items are a little highly priced for the condition but there is at least one of everything there so worth stopping by and checking out!,UNK
9248,"This an average tasting, smaller portion and higher price chinese place.  Disappointed as it is in a nice location and we really don't have very good chinese places in the area but the search continues.",UNK
9249,Pizza was good. Long wait. Would definitely come back again!,UNK
9250,"Yuck!\nTypical and dirty, rude and greasy. If you want takeout go to Hong Kong Kitchen a mile down the street. They have lunch specials too with only half the grease and about the same price.",UNK
9251,Great price !! & Clean .. lil noisy AC but a great spot to use for a night n Scottsdale when you had a few drinks.,UNK
9252,"The kids, magazine and non-fiction sections are normal sized but there's hardly any room for fiction since they've turned a bookstore into a toy and useless crap store. Will I still visit this location? Sure but not if I'm browsing for a book.",UNK
9253,"tried it, not impressed.  There's much better local choices.",UNK
9254,I really like their roasted root veggie hash.  I get it with eggs over easy and a side of bacon (for a bit more protein).  Yummy!  Carl's Cakes is based in the same place so you can always walk out with goodies after your meal.,UNK
9255,For AZ this is as good as Korean food gets!!  Go if you need your Korean fix and have some Japanese rolls or food if you are craving both.,UNK
9256,I had high expectations but I was let down . The chicken was dry and could have used a bit more flavor. Price wasn't bad though.,UNK
9257,Not at all worth it. Front of the car was not clean at all. Paid an extra $5 to have the wheels cleaned and the brake dust still remained on the rims. Will not be going back,UNK
9258,"This review's for some take out food - wings, meh...honestly the flavor level's between fast food and chain restaurant.. \n\nFruit punch drink , A-ok",UNK
9259,"The burger patty looked like the ones in my school cafeteria. I was pretty annoyed to get home to such a disappointing burger. At least the bun was soft, but very very greasy.",UNK
9260,Very middle of the road or even a little under.. Sports book is probably the nicest nook. I upgraded to a suite & honestly it looked like a regular room. I give this two stars.,UNK
9261,Big selection!,UNK
9262,Food was good and full of exciting flavors. Would put 3 $$$ for price.,UNK
9263,I go here every time I am in Vegas - had a fabulous turkey burger.  Highly recommended.,UNK
9264,Decent sandwiches.  Fresh ingredients.  Not wowed.  M'eh.  Just okay.,UNK
9265,Ghetto biker bar. Okay place to hang out if that's what you are looking for.  I don't like how the shower curtains they use for bathroom doors in the lady's room touch my knees when I sit on the toilet.  Gross.,UNK
9266,"Never crowded, service is quick and efficient. Food is typical Roberto's. Love their enchaladas and rellanos.",UNK
9267,"For me, this place is more function over form.  Wait staff is ifey, food is overly complex which results in a muddled taste.  \n\nBetter restaurants in the immediate area, so for me - it is a pass..",UNK
9268,Breakfast for 8 on 5/11/13. Most of us ended up with the Central or English breakfast special and we were pleased. Drinks were a little weak. Good service!,UNK
9269,"Bad service, ok pizza. Other locations are better.",UNK
9270,"The facilities at WestWorld are nice, but the parking lot attendants/security guys were complete ***holes during the Barrett Jackson.",UNK
9271,"The great: atmosphere, service\nThe not so great: food and drinks are hit n miss and can be an expensive disappointment.",UNK
9272,"Fun Ride, something to try when you're in Vegas (and you're not 21) =D\nbut yeah, took the girlfriend here during the day to kill sometime before the night life and had to say it was not a bad experience.",UNK
9273,"Good food, poor (attitude), but speedy customer service. Try it, but don't expect the help to be too friendly.",UNK
9274,Basic breakfast. Large portions; would be nice to be able to order smaller portions at a lower price.,UNK
9275,Love 2.99 Tuesdays... good food!!,UNK
9276,This place looks much better on the inside than out!  Good pizza (they offer pizza by the slice at lunch) but the menu is a bit over priced.   Pretty good TV coverage so it could be a decent watering hole in South Charlotte!  I'll be back...,UNK
9277,"The food tastes good and the themed decor is fun. The Italian beef each time I've gotten it has been super soggy though and I really don't like that. Its messy, it feels gross and is just generally unappealing.",UNK
9278,Good food! Kinda loud with the table TVs though.Garlic knots are awesome!,UNK
9279,"Mediocre at best. I ate here only because some coworkers liked this place. Nothing special, diner quality food.",UNK
9280,"Burgers were good,  but the fries were cold and not good at all food was a bit over priced. The khalua vodka shake was bomb! Love bobby but this dont seem like his best..",UNK
9281,Food is ok but service sucks. Dont bother.,UNK
9282,"This was the perfect place for the family after a day at the resort.  The food was good, especially the barbeque chicken.  The kids menu was wonderful.  My only complaint was that the server really could not answer questions about the menu.",UNK
9283,"This is a decent place to eat late at night and the price was good for cafe.   I had the american breakfast with eggs, hash brown and ham.",UNK
9284,"Fun with paint and wine, what more do you really need.",UNK
9285,"Visiting from out of state....average mani/pedi.  Nice clean shop, friendly technicians; way overpriced!.",UNK
9286,Meh was ok\nfood is nothing special and the prices were average\n\nguess I have to continue my search for good mexican food in arizona,UNK
9287,"Good food, but they're way too skimpy on the toppings. I had two pieces of basil on my margarita pizza. Two. I'd go back for a cheese pizza but not much more.",UNK
9288,"This restaurant has closed, only a few months after it opened.  Too bad. I ate there twice and enjoyed it both times.",UNK
9289,This place is more about the scene than the sushi.  I just don't think that the sushi is anything to write home about.,UNK
9290,"Food has good flavor, but I would have preferred a bigger portion of meat and hotter food. They really aren't out to impress, only to fill your belly.",UNK
9291,"This place has a lot to change, the decor is bad. The food and drinks are bad, especially for Vegas and The Venetian. Small servings, plain dishes, nothing memorable about Valentino. Save your time and money.",UNK
9292,"Not very good food. Too much $$ for not a very good quality. Biscuits were hard, Caesar dressing watered down and sour. Not very exciting BBQ either. Despite all of that, Elizabeth \""Lizzy\"" was an excellent waitress.",UNK
9293,"Had high hopes for this place, but honestly have had better.  The atmosphere is nice; the service is a little show and we felt neglected at times.",UNK
9294,We liked coming here for breakfasts but now its like they down graded. Soggy bacon sitting in oil & the Portuguese sausage in oil not that much selection now. I'll have to give it a 2 1/2 stars... Will have to stick to the main street buffet,UNK
9295,Still this Starbuck does not understand that their music is VERY LOUD it should not be as loud that you cannot to hear your conversation with someone.\n\nAGAIN IT'S LOUD,UNK
9296,"Had a lovely stay at the Mirage. Decent rooms, good food and restaurants, relaxing spa with an Amazing massage, Fun Times!",UNK
9297,"We went for breakfast and it was good, just not great. Bacon was excellent and my omelet was prepared as it should have been but nothing was outstanding. Service was outstanding however.",UNK
9298,Be prepared to wait atleast an hour even after a reservation.\n\nSame experience for two days in a row.\n\nWe are vegeterian and they have good options for us and so we came in for dinner for two consecutive days.,UNK
9299,The people are super friendly but understaffed!! 1 person for the morning rush.. Not cool.. We are all trying to get to work on time. And the ceiling fans are filthy..,UNK
9300,"Not awful, but I have had much better. I just can't help but compare to Chinatown LA. I must give them credit for having chow fun... or as they call it chow ho. Good service a well.",UNK
9301,The food is good. Would give 4 starts except  I guess somewhere along the line I became an old man.. But something about 10am shoulder to shoulder with tons of people and techno from the DJ.. If you have a hangover avoid!,UNK
9302,"Work nearby good service, very close by to me. The food is really greasy. Not a bad place to go to one a month every day I don't think so.",UNK
9303,"This theatre is very interesting. The staff is very nice and helpful, but I only can give the establishment 3 stars due to the layout, as well as the outdated decor.\n\nThis theatre could use a bit of a facelift.",UNK
9304,"Not the best Starbucks by any stretch. Used to have only three parking spots, which have since been increased to maybe 8. Service is always lacking, both ordering and making drinks. Wouldn't go unless I had a free drink on my card and was dying of thirst at the very moment.",UNK
9305,"Needed a new spot to get my spa pedicures and my nails looks fantastic, and now I have one, really reasonable, got an amazing massage and my nails look fantastic. \nStaff was very friendly,",UNK
9306,"Not at all what was expected. The website leads you to believe bit is a gourmet bakery and breakfast place, when in reality it is a run of the mill mediocre sandwich shop.",UNK
9307,"A Montreal classic that is worth a visit at least once. Orange Julep is definitely the star, but hotdog with poutine wasn't bad.",UNK
9308,"A frat bar with the novelty of a midget that pours shots.  You go in, get your shot from a little person, and leave.  This place is only ideal for the quick stop, or once you're already too intoxicated to care.",UNK
9309,Slow service. Prime rib arrived cold and too rare. Would not come back.,UNK
9310,The food was average - but service and dessert were great. Would go again but nothing to rave about!,UNK
9311,"Took my mother here for her birthday. I had a burger, fiance had some pasta and mom had a pizza. All the food was very good. Service is slow and un-attendng though.",UNK
9312,"This is nothing more than a cantine for students. Food is decent but don't expect anything \""wouah\"" but be prepared to wait, be unconfortable and finaly leave because you can't cope with the chaos anymore.",UNK
9313,The wings are good and sweet and the strawberry margaritas are excellent!  The service was very good but it has a limited menu.,UNK
9314,"I was starving after a crazy drive to Arizona and waiting another two hours for my friend's aunt, but the pizza was fast, cheesy and delicious, but INCREDIBLE crispy texture, but the sauce was thumbs down not good but I was completely filled and happy.",UNK
9315,"Disappointing. They spend all their money on the major travelling exhibits (Body Worlds, Narnia), so the rest of the exhibits look a little old and uninspired.",UNK
9316,The only thing I enjoyed was the Mongolian gril & my beer. I don't think I'll be going back unless I'm really in the for the Mongolian BBQ.,UNK
9317,Typical Asian fare in a Vegas casino.\nIt was good but nothing special.,UNK
9318,they sold me a power drill RIGID a refurbished which actually was used and used heavily,UNK
9319,I would never buy clothes here but I did try to bring 25 new jerseys here and they said they couldnt take them because they would just get stolen. I paid $100 each and they offered $0. They have one knock-off for $35 on the rack. Not my cup of tea.,UNK
9320,Huge selection of beer. The hambugers are really good and the nachos were outstanding. Service is good. The club type atmosphere doesn't go well with a burger and a beer.,UNK
9321,"it is ok for \""fast\"" food. although they bring your meal to the table, service is hit or miss on if they check back. The food quantity is good, but taste is that of cafeteria food.",UNK
9322,"Been here a couple of times only because of MYVEGAS and resort credit. 2-1 lunch/dinner. It's ok. Not much selection, but it'll do when you don't have to pay full price.",UNK
9323,I don't often go with my boys to the strip clubs nearer downtown and this place is why! Horrible and smelled really bad. There was one nice girl there n wish I could remember her name. The 2 stars are for her!,UNK
9324,I was very disappointed in the food. Portions were quite small and monochromatic in tasty. We had to ask for bread. The dessert was very dry. All around skimpiness and not worth the money. There are many restaurants for tha same money around.,UNK
9325,"Probably my least favorite major west coast Airport because of its lack of amenities, long waits on the runway, always using US Airways here and I feel like this place has the most planes being shut down with service problems than any other airport around. (I understand heat is an issue)",UNK
9326,My wife got her nails done here and they really messed them up. She went back to get it fixed and the woman doing them still couldn't get it right. One of her fake nails was even crocked.,UNK
9327,The food was good but I would like more for the price I paid. Service was not that great,UNK
9328,"Lox and bagel with breakfast was pretty good, but not traditional. Schmears, no!  lox and scrambled eggs; okay. Lots of food, but I was hoping for deli-style lox and bagle. Still, pretty good breakfast.",UNK
9329,It's just Ice Cream... 4 bucks for a 12 oz blizzard is crazy.. For that money I should have gone to a creamery and had something higher quality...,UNK
9330,"Vegetable salad with grilled chicken was very good, fresh and tasty!  Our server kept getting confused who ordered what.  Not too many healthy choices, but the greasy choices looked awfully good.",UNK
9331,Truffle parmesan fries were so good I almost ate the paper wrapper that it was held in. As for the burger I had I wasn't impressed.  The prices were thankfully decent.,UNK
9332,I have this place another shot after a year hiatus and was very pleased. Food was great and service was awesome. Only reason I'm giving it 3 stars is because one of the sushi chefs repeatedly coughed and sneezed. Ha,UNK
9333,"Great location, ok service when you sit outside, horrible food. Good for outside seating and beer...",UNK
9334,"The front desk lady is not full of energy. She has no impression what so ever. Although they do have  variety of food , some of the food looks as if it's been trying to be used yesterday as well. Other than that the waitresses were great!",UNK
9335,"Dive Bar Nuff Said! No AC, just swamp cooler. Uhhhh Stuffed animal claw machine is full of Pornos??? Alrighty then!",UNK
9336,My girlfriends and I had the lunch buffet during our stay in Vegas. There wasn't much visual appeal to the place and the buffet was  also mediocre. Not as great as I thought it would be. There's definitely better brunch options out here in Vegas!,UNK
9337,Earl of sandwich an ok decent sandwich not super great not terrible. Decent and edible.,UNK
9338,"Burgers are ok. The ribeye and mashed potatoes were flavorless. Stay in the restaurant area, your clothes will smell like smoke in the bar. The waitstaff and bartenders are cool. I probably won't be back.",UNK
9339,"Easy in, easy out. Friendly staff that got the drinks out quickly. Lounge was clean. Seems a little odd that there is a Starbucks nearly right next door, just across the parking lot, in the grocery store. Plenty of parking.",UNK
9340,"good steak, good portions, good option for vegas.",UNK
9341,"Great interactions, very friendly workers and customers (most of the time). Don't waste your time on the wifi though, it's horrible!",UNK
9342,"Have you been to Seaworld or that Aquarium in the city?\n\nThis is smaller.\n\nThe decor & jellyfish are pretty, though.",UNK
9343,I had okay service and an overall okay experience. They do not really have anything to remember them by. I might go back someday.,UNK
9344,Total Packer Bar!\n\nThis place has become the default Phoenix bar for cheering on the Packers.\n\nEvery TV (and there are many) is tuned to the Pack on Sundays!,UNK
9345,"One of my favorite places, open until 4 am good food always on time and great staff... #1 with the Days Inn",UNK
9346,The place smells and the restrooms were in awful condition.  The sanitation score is a mere 91.  Just saying....,UNK
9347,"Slow service, but the food is ok. Nothing to write home about though.  The seasoned potatoes are better than other breakfast places in town.",UNK
9348,The food is good. Margarita is good but a bit weak. Getting something better than the house may be different. All together a good experience.,UNK
9349,Chicken was hard but biscuits and tea are the best in the world.,UNK
9350,Good for a fast health food alternative than burger king. Busy with people and got my food out fast.,UNK
9351,"Food just okay nothing special. As a lunch that is okay, for dinner NOT.\nThe staff customer service is mixed. Been there twice and the hostess in the front was terrific, the bartender was cool, the waitress - oh no!",UNK
9352,Overpriced and just ok quality! I think most of these positive reviews are from people who have little experience with authentic Indian food...,UNK
9353,"First time trying this place out, and I must say it's pretty good :)",UNK
9354,Crepe shop in New York New York. They serve sweet and savory crepes to order.  The breakfast Crepe was  a bit too bland. The cannoli Crepe was sweet heaven. Good for a quick stop for a bite while gambling.,UNK
9355,Dirty location. I ordered a sweet tea for them to tell me they are out after I paid for my order. And refused to refund me. I don't drink soda.,UNK
9356,Wonderful service.  However their signature tri tip sandwich was dry and closer to leather than beef.  The full rack of St. Louis ribs was a fairly meager portion for the price.  The shoestring fries were great. Eat in the bar.  It's much more relaxed and less of a circus.,UNK
9357,Best thing about the place was the giant TV screen so I could watch the Eagles while in Vegas.  Food was very fair and overpriced.  Maybe the food tastes better if you're drinking a lot.  Wouldn't recommend the place.,UNK
9358,Only good dish is Singapore noodle.,UNK
9359,Overrated happy hour. It's not overrated in price but taste. The tostadas though. I could go crazy on those.,UNK
9360,Food was ok. Large portions. Employees there were rude and everyone in line felt very rushed to order (Wasn't even busy). Also place didn't seem very clean.,UNK
9361,This restaurant is expensive for the little amount of food you receive.  Environment is quaint and the service was good. The bread was very delectable. I most likely will not return because of the price. Look for coupons online before you head over to the restaurant.,UNK
9362,"They have a wide selection of salad bar. And of course, all kinds of meat. \nHowever, it's just too much for me. Some people like it best, but I am okay. \nNot to mention, it's too pricey :)",UNK
9363,We came here on a Friday for lunch and wanted to sit on the rooftop because the weather was beautiful. Unfortunately the rooftop isn't open durning the week until dinner time. Food is good but would have been nice to enjoy the nice weather and beautiful scenery the restaurant can but didn't offer.,UNK
9364,"Not much to say, not a bargain.  If I were in the HRH and hungry, I'd swing around the corner and hit Pink Taco.  Better meal, same hotel.",UNK
9365,I've been going here for the past 9+ years and it's pretty much the basic local circle-K. Not much to say past that. I do dig the walk-in beer cooler but also wonder who in the hell buys the bags of bananas?,UNK
9366,"Very small \""large\"" sundaes in my opinion. Food is very mediocre.",UNK
9367,"Lots of potential but ultimately does not live up to what it could have been. Simpson, X-Men, 4 player PACMAN and mediocre beer on draft. Food is absolutely atrocious though. All the games are free though",UNK
9368,Ah. Disappointing. Small portions. Boring poorly seasoned Japanese chow from 1995. Same old. Will not return.,UNK
9369,Goofy owner/manager.,UNK
9370,"The owners a a bit snarky, but you can't beat the location.",UNK
9371,"If a mixture of boiled meats in one pot is your thing, this is the place for you. I did not like the lack of options, would have liked some grilled meat options",UNK
9372,its was ok. not really worth all the hype\n\nPrice: a lot\nPresentation: good\nTaste: okay\nservice: okay,UNK
9373,Food was not as great as I read on the reviews. I went to have a nice dinner with my wife and the waiter was hitting on me. Gross.\n\nfood was overpriced and restaurant not that nice.,UNK
9374,Used to be our favorite family restaurant. Haven't been for a while. The service has gone downhill. Food is still delicious. Had to get our own small plates and refills took a while. Hoping they were just short staffed today.,UNK
9375,The cupcakes were ok. Not something I would go back and buy. The frosting was overly sweet  and in one of them the frosting tasting wrong. ...and the cupcakes seemed like they were made from box cake mix. Not going back,UNK
9376,"Stopped at ms during a badger game.   The staff was attentive and the beer selection was pretty good.  The interior was plain and the place had zero energy.   I cannot say it was bad, just not a place i want to revisit.",UNK
9377,Kind of a dump. Lots of homeless hanging around. People inside using the computers talking to themselves and in desperate need of some serious personal hygiene. I think I will make the drive to another branch from now on. This one's not for me.,UNK
9378,"Brought five pairs of dress/work shoes in to be shined and cleaned up, the finished product was satisfactory.  Price was very competitive but it was cash only which wasn't very convenient.",UNK
9379,Favorite spot was the pool. Okay casino.,UNK
9380,It was just ok. Clearly workers didn't want to be there at 9am on Sunday. Very funky.  Tons of toys for little kids which would be nice if I had em. Got ET bagel with cream cheese. Not impressed.,UNK
9381,Food is decent but service is ridiculously bad. Our order was given away to the table next to us and we know for a fact that we ordered first. We've been here for over 50 minutes and our first order still isn't complete WTF!,UNK
9382,I'm not trying to be a jerk. I'm just a bit confused why this place is closed on a holiday weekend on Forth of July at Midnight. I think,UNK
9383,The sushi is good but they pack on too much rice.  Service is always excellent.  My favorite Chef is MOON!,UNK
9384,The food had a nice flavor to it. And I enjoy the fact that they serve breakfast all day. On the negative side of things; the wait to be sat was way too long. The server was mediocre at best and the food was cold by the time that it got to us!,UNK
9385,Had the Bonzai and Cajun rolls..both had a weird taste and the rice was mushy. It tasted and looked as if it was pounded and them rolled up. The spicy sweet sauce on the Bonzai was clear and slimy. Never coming back.,UNK
9386,Another place closed for a while now. This place closed years ago. There is one at the marketplace if your craving the creamery.,UNK
9387,This store is very quiet....quite small if you ask me....there is limited selection in several items....other then that it's a typical office max,UNK
9388,Food was decent. The nachos were great but the tacos were just ok. Atmosphere was fun but not the greatest meal in Vegas.,UNK
9389,"This location is ALWAYS out of stock on items. It's disorganized, messy, and frankly...behind on the times. I love Target, but I'm really starting to get burnt out on this spot.",UNK
9390,"Small portions compared to the rest of the asian places on green st, especially when the price is almost the same. The food is good though.",UNK
9391,I thought this place was pretty cool old school arcade games and a bar. Its a pretty good combination.,UNK
9392,Drive thru is super slow. No one in front of us had an order more than 2 drinks. They need to get it together. Go to the Starbucks down the street inside the smiths on windmill and rainbow.,UNK
9393,"It was alright.  I've had much better Thai food. It had good decore, but that was pretty much the only thing that was memorable.",UNK
9394,"Quality, value, selection. All of the Indian cuisine staples. The dessert, particularly the ice cream (which was old) was not impressive.",UNK
9395,Slow service but overall quality of sushi was decent. I would have had a better experience if the five other waiters on the other side of the restaurant helped the one person serving our party of 11. Service needs some work,UNK
9396,This dog park is just okay. Lots of room for the dogs to run and play however it seems that there are people there who do not watch their dogs thus creating some chaos. Would be better if the owners were more aware and responsible for their own animal!  My dogs seem to enjoy playing there though!,UNK
9397,We love Barnes and Noble but this store does not deserve to carry the name.  It's a terrible representation and if Barnes and Noble cares anything about their brand reputation they should get to this story immediately and clean it up!  Please start in the bathrooms!  Horrendous!,UNK
9398,Went there for lunch and had the burger.  Service was very slow.  The bread was very good but the rest of the food was nothing special,UNK
9399,The outside and the inside is clean and looks like a Caribbean cafe but the food doesn't taste like it.,UNK
9400,"The hotel is not GREAT but it's not bad either. It's a 3 out of 5---\nThe rooms are slightly run down, no Internet access in 2013???",UNK
9401,Like the atmosphere and set up of the place. The staff was friendly and attentive. The food is ok but nothing to brag about. Ordered a bunch of rolls and they were done right. Wont hurry back here but would eat here again considering the lack of great options in the area.,UNK
9402,"The food is just okay, never horrible but never all that great. It is a fun place for a group but it is a tad gimmicky if you ask me.",UNK
9403,This was the first time seeing this art and I was so impressed. The display of the art and very soothing to walk in after being pushed around the mall area with all the noise and jostling.,UNK
9404,"A lot of food, but I wasn't thrilled.  Just not my taste.",UNK
9405,"First time back to this place in several years.  Also one of the first times I've had a beer that was essentially undrinkable.  Fun environment, but I wouldn't go back again for the beer alone.",UNK
9406,This place was alright if it wasn't for the claustrophobic feeling I got. This place made me feel as though I was in a little cave due to the treatment on the already low ceilings and crowded areas. The outside was pretty impressive though. I think I prefer places with higher ceilings.,UNK
9407,"An average Subway restaurant, the people were nice and quick.  Smells like wonderful fresh baked bread and the facility was clean.",UNK
9408,Fresh nigiri was good. The baked rolls had way too much cream cheese; it was overpowering. The rice was overcooked and burnt. The wait was too long and there were not enough sushi chefs working.,UNK
9409,"Not much in clothes but did find a couple of board games, 1/2 off.",UNK
9410,Ordered the prime rib special an hour after the doors opened and they were already out. Found crab shell in the sweet tortellini. The service was great though and the manager did end up giving us the apps for free.,UNK
9411,quite a nice bar/restaurant! prices are ok and the taste of the food is simple but good. the ambience in the inside is what it makes it more comfortable to hang out and have a drink or two!,UNK
9412,Personally love the food however it take forever! I will generally call in my orders early and even when I get their I have to wait another 10-15 minutes.,UNK
9413,"One time the food was really good, another time it was questionable.  Has the ambience of a cheap bar.  Not really my thing.",UNK
9414,"I expected more from a ritz. Don't get me wrong, it was nice. But the night before I stayed at the Renaissance, and the night after I stayed at marriott at McDowell mountain, and they were both better. Pool is to small.",UNK
9415,Took my fianc\u00e9 here and was a little disappointed with the level of service. Receptionist was nice. Doctor was not nice. Had heard good things but was not impressed. Will give her one more shot and re review.,UNK
9416,Solid Americanized Chinese take out.  They are a little pricey but the food tastes fresh and take out orders are made fast.,UNK
9417,The food is great. But I find the waiters to be stuck up and greedy.A bit over priced.,UNK
9418,"The service here is good, but thats as good as it gets. The salsa is disgusting the food is bland and unidentifiable and its just generally annoying",UNK
9419,Atmosphere was good. Fixed menu was pretty good. Lots of food and large quantity. Lots of options. Table wait for small parties is better than big. Good location.,UNK
9420,Service was very slow and bordered on surly.  Plenty of other options in Vegas - take them.,UNK
9421,Service here is going down hill fast at this store!,UNK
9422,The drinks and the service at Tavern were just fine.  They had a decent drink special.  But I couldn't really stay too long because it was so freakin hot in there.  We stayed for a little while and moved on to the next place.,UNK
9423,Love their lunch specials! Especially the curry!,UNK
9424,I really like their food. I recommend the calzones and the pizza bagels. Pretty good price for one person and its very filling. \nI would have given this four stars but the service is kind of iffy. Sometimes the service is really good and sometimes it's eh.,UNK
9425,"Used to be the best seafood buffet in Vegas.  Years ago, you pay $29.99 for all u can eat lobsters.  Well, those days are over, and so is the 5 stars rating.  I gave a 3 stars for the best dessert buffet in the desert.",UNK
9426,"We love coming here for happy hour. The service staff is very attentive the sushi is great and the \""rock n roll\"" music on the patio is fun. We always have a good time at the location in Kieland. Try the shishisto peppers. Excellent!",UNK
9427,The burgers available here are very greasy. The price is reasonable however the taste is not.,UNK
9428,"Lots of great beers on tap(Modelo Especial, Negro Modelo, Delerium Tremens, etc).  Great concept with the nachos.  Service could have been better.  Try the Flortentine Nachos!",UNK
9429,"Good, but watch the coffee if you order decaf.  The girl gave tried to give me regular 2x now. Didn't seem to care or concerned at all.",UNK
9430,"Service was friendly... food tasted like it had been sitting for a while. My shrimp walnut was mushy, not crunchy like it usually is.",UNK
9431,Ok. Not amazing but my girlfriend really likes it.,UNK
9432,"I think all the hype about this place is for the dreamers.  I thought the cashier was inattentive, and was way too busy talking to his friends to pay any attention to us the customer's. The ice cream was alright but nothing to make me come back for more.",UNK
9433,"Terrible service, very pretentious place. Waited for my coffee for 20 min once and in the end it turned out they forgot ! Sold me a day old pastry...",UNK
9434,"The best I can say about Two Hippies is that it's cheap, and the founders are good marketers. Unfortunately, the dining room is small and uninviting, and the food is just okay. I won't be returning.",UNK
9435,"After a couple of frustrating days, my problem with DaVinci Green has been resolved.  I have decided to keep them on for granite counters and I hope to be able to give them 5 stars after the work.  Bottom line, they did step up and do what they could to satisfy me.",UNK
9436,"My beer was watery and service was not good. Our server obviously forgot to enter our food order into the computer, and never even apologized for her oversight. We prefer to grab a beer and watch sports at House of Brews right down the street.",UNK
9437,"I am sure there are better gyms out there, but this is where I'm at for now.",UNK
9438,"Solid restaurant :)\n\nGood service, nice location, food is tasty & nicely presented. \n\nI had a Paradise roll & an order of Edamame & I was stuffed!",UNK
9439,"Great value, vibe and vegetarian choices. Skip pad Thai and go for the tacos. Great start although still working out the kinks with a big creative menu.",UNK
9440,"Good atmosphere, once you get inside. Knowledgeable/helpful staff. Lamb was tough, but vegetarian picks were good.",UNK
9441,"Owner Paula, contacted me and said she would send me a gift certificate to come back or give to a friend, but I never received it and have not heard from her since. It is well over 1/2 a year now.",UNK
9442,Shrimp few in shrimp low mein and was not very tasty. Disappointing.,UNK
9443,Patties were good. I didn't have room in my stomach to try anything else. Small place. I'd go again.,UNK
9444,"The drinks (milk tea, slushies, flavored teas, etc) tasted pretty good and their boba were the best consistency: chewy and soft, in town. My only problem is that customer service was always slow.",UNK
9445,There are many better places than this for anything. Poor hours not very good don't eat here unless you have to even than maybe just wait,UNK
9446,Decent food and wait times but I really live Freddys for their French fries and sauce.,UNK
9447,"Simple clean , friendly staff but the selection is not  that great",UNK
9448,Overpriced for what you get. I had the ostrich here sometime ago and was very dissatisfied.,UNK
9449,Overpriced for the type of food.,UNK
9450,"If you want to be ignored, listen to your bartenders complain about their lives, enjoy a marginal selection of draft beers, and have that true crap Southside experience, this is the place to be.",UNK
9451,The service was excellent.  It was very busy so we opted to sit outside. It's byob so that was disappointing. The food was ok. It was certainly edible and the presentation was nice. It just wasn't awesome.,UNK
9452,"I have had lunch there many times and have always been happy with the food and service, but today everything was just OK at best.  The fish and chips had no taste!  It needed a ton of salt and tarter just to eat it.",UNK
9453,Good pancakes. Eggs and breakfast burrito I would say are just ok. Not sure why all the rave reviews.,UNK
9454,Feeeeh.\n\nThe flavors here taste too artificial for my liking. Location is good. Seating is meant to be unpleasant to make you leave asap.\n\nPass,UNK
9455,"Typical Vegas bar: Beautiful girls serving expensive drinks.  Happily, however, they don't torture you too much with Beatles music.  It is VERY small and located behind the casino - so don't waste your time if you aren't staying here.",UNK
9456,I honestly was looking forward to trying Pedros and was extremely disappointed. Horribly slow service and cold food was about all I took away from this place.,UNK
9457,"Poor service, not servers fault store needs more wait staff for the guests. Food is always good. Ended up wet from the misters and had to move due to my table was soaked and me as we'll.",UNK
9458,The Capital Tap Haus is an average burger place with a limited selection of beer. They only serve Capital Brewery beers which is just okay. The food is nothing special and I would try other places around the square before I stopped back here.,UNK
9459,Hehehe... it cracks me up to see these snobby Asian women flashing their labels and shopping at the full priced stores on the strip when the outlet at 30% off is only a short drive away...,UNK
9460,Service was good but probably the worse pizza I've ever had.  We couldn't eat it.,UNK
9461,"Tried the orange General Tso chicken entree and found the flavor...confusing. Maybe it should either be General Tso or orange chicken, not both? Also on the expensive side for what you get. \n\nOtherwise convenient location and easy take out option.",UNK
9462,"A good spot to go for \"" in a hurry \"" situation Hawaiian food. Was my favorite in town but I feel like they are starting to go cheap in ingredients and you can really taste it in the food..",UNK
9463,"The best thing here is the Frozen Hot Chocolate (a 4 star). Desserts are the same price or more then entrees. If you're not coming here for their famous Frozen Hot Chocolate, you can get their food or desserts any where else.",UNK
9464,I always hear from everyone and their mamas how good earls is and I honestly didn't experience the magic of these sandwiches that every is mystified about. They're nice and warm and that's about it. My favorite part of the sandwich - the bread.,UNK
9465,"I got the Mexican Pizza because Abby D. said it was good, it tasted like freezer burn. I would give 1 star buuuuuut they give away free samples of their party burros and taquitos, and those were good!",UNK
9466,I ordered a thin crust pizza for carry out from this location.  The staff was very friendly and the pizza was pretty good.  I look forward to trying their pasta in the near future.,UNK
9467,The only joint to eat 24 hrs at the Luxor. Breakfast chefs are on it. Expect to eat like you are at Dennys and you won't be disappointed.,UNK
9468,"This bar is pretty interesting! The bartenders dance on the bar every so often, which is pretty funny to watch. The bartenders are very cool to talk to and they make some very good strong drinks. This is a pretty good place to go for a drink or two but not much more than that.",UNK
9469,I didn't see what the hype was about with this place.  Food was ok.  Service wasn't the best.  The waiter was upset we asked for separate checks... Not very friendly and he could not add everything properly.  This place is ok but not the best.,UNK
9470,Food was excellent.\n\nBut....\n\nNo plates?\nNo plates after I asked three times?\nGratuity added on for a party of two?\nNot cool.,UNK
9471,Don't believe the hype!! The service time is ridiculously SLOW!!! First time here and not that impressed. Food is good but as good as you can get for COLD food.,UNK
9472,Nails came out a little sloppy. I agreed to $25 full set and they charged me for $35. Customer service sucks! They make no conversation and are not friendly.,UNK
9473,"Nice and clean, expected for a 4 stars hotel",UNK
9474,Good service and meals- have eaten here multiple times,UNK
9475,"Croissant wasn't that good. I like bouchon bakery croissant better. The red velvet taste like chocolate, but the presentation decor of each cupcake is amazing. \nMy fave is the fruit tart.",UNK
9476,"Oh, it started out so good which seems to be the pattern with handymen.  \n\nSince our first terrific experience, my husband has sent several emails and voicemails with  no return communication.  Disappointing.",UNK
9477,"Bad service, no knowledge of the menu, and the meat on the pizza had freezer burn. Good for a chain, but not the gourmet experience they strive for.",UNK
9478,"i like to buy their sugar donut, reminds me of HI's malasadas, it's so good, and their rich tres leche cake----oh so good....",UNK
9479,They don't have Jameson Black Barrel here :/ no accents... The Irish pub in Mandalay Bay is leaps and bounds better. Heading there after this first drink is done.,UNK
9480,"Good Mexican Food, but a little on the pricey side for a taco shop.",UNK
9481,I honestly dont understand what all the rave is about. Chicken sandwich was good. The omelet my husband got was average and pricey. The waitress barely checked on our table and her shorts were so short her butt cheeks were hanging out.,UNK
9482,Random crazy crackheads wander throughout this place. The staff isn't incredibly helpful and this place makes me miss the awesomeness that is Freddy's in Portland. Need more natural foods! Damn you red state AZ!!!!,UNK
9483,I went there once with a friend for her birthday.  She was head-over-heels for the place.  I was unenthused.,UNK
9484,"Quite an interesting menu, good service and ambiance, but mediocre execution in the kitchen.  If they could get the kitchen to deliver on the promise of the menu, it would be a five-star breakfast joint for me.  I look forward to giving it another try at some point.",UNK
9485,"Mediocre food at best. The staff is pretty emotionless. They don't offer regular sushi anymore, and the fried rolls they do have aren't that great. There's plenty of much better places to go to.",UNK
9486,The pork was dry to me but my husband loved it when i brought it home as a left over...,UNK
9487,very small hidden bar. Would be fun with a group of friends if you went early and snagged a game or bar seat. Cute decor normal prices.,UNK
9488,"Was not impressed at all with the Red enchiladas. The food was cold, highly upset with this place. Never coming back to this restaurant",UNK
9489,"Was there on a Saturday night with a group of friends. Service was extremely slow and our waiter kept getting our order wrong..it shouldn't take 30 min to get a drink...\nDrinks are good though, but I don't think I would go back",UNK
9490,"Waffle was made as good good as a waffle iron can make it. Coffee was brewed as good as an expresso maker can make it. If u like self service, generic food,  and overpriced coffee this is the spot. Get there early to avoid lines.",UNK
9491,"The burgers are Meh, the fries are awesome. Maybe they should be called SmashFries? But the staff is nice and place is clean.",UNK
9492,Watch out for the short black dude in the white shirt ladies. Too big of a flirt! Teeters on the edge of uncomfortable and scary!,UNK
9493,"Nice location, great service, clean, reasonably priced great sushi & dessert!  We want to try lunch specials.",UNK
9494,Food was great! Service not really friendly. Bathrooms were horrid. The stars is based on the overall. I would just order take out from here.,UNK
9495,"Very slow service, 15 minutes for first glass of water, down hill from there, Food was so/so. Will not be going back here with all the other options. Maybe just a bad night was a Sunday but was not busy for the slow service.",UNK
9496,Boring but kids love it!  DONT GO ON THE WEEKEND and bundle up!!!  Lots of fun rides and lights and even a Choo Choo Train!!!,UNK
9497,"I'm sorry, but...well...\nYou're wearing pasties.  PAS-TIES!\nI'M HERE FOR TIT-TIES!!!",UNK
9498,When I signed my son up for classes they told me over the phone $50 a month then after that month was over they jacked the price to $72 a month. He did the same thing in all 4 of his lessons he didn't learn anything.,UNK
9499,"Food was great, but the service was horrible! Took the waiter about 30 to 45 minutes to come back to the table after delivering our food.",UNK
9500,So so yogurt and with one on every corner you really have to make yourself stand out. I thought the kid behind the counter was friendly and helpful. The toppings and yogurt selections are once again so so. Does anyone else find it odd this business is categorized under Ethiopian food?,UNK
9501,Get the pesto drizzled on your pizza. Yummmm!,UNK
9502,"A-OK barber shop.  Typical old school shop with 3 chairs.  My kids and I go here and they do good job including shaving the neck.  Depending on the clientele, it can be fun to listen and partake in the conversation.",UNK
9503,I like the pho and I especially like the chicken bun. Although $10 for bun is a bit steep for the area and the spring rolls were very strange.,UNK
9504,"Ate here one night, about two or three weeks ago, because a friend recommended it and said was better than Grimaldi's. I disagree. Pizza was meh. Crust was burned and had too much sauce but not enough cheese. Not sure if we'll be back...",UNK
9505,i liked  the food but after a hangover who won't eat anything! great place for hangover not have when sober. great place to people watch that's for sure!,UNK
9506,Took forever to be seen by waitress. Not busy. Didn't ask me for anything to drink. Food was not bad but not good either. Got my order wrong. Nothing to write home about. I will not be coming back here.,UNK
9507,"It was a small stinky casino. You have to bet high. Even penny's, I couldn't find anything cheaper than 40cents a spin. I came out smelling like smoke bad my hair and clothes. I ended up Going down the street to Lone Butte and it was better.",UNK
9508,Super slow service compared to other EBs. IlI go to the one on Sahara even though its 10 minutes out of the way next time.,UNK
9509,"Mediocre at best. No real creativity in their rolls and it didn't seem like there was much effort to be creative. Atmosphere was just okay. I wanted to like this place, but it just didn't work.",UNK
9510,Amazing drink prices especially noted is the $5 Patron. However the food is horrible. The burger meat has made me horribly sick. I still come here for the bar though. Great day drinking spot.,UNK
9511,"It's decent and service is good, but the rooms are just outdated and the AC is noisy. There are many better options in the area as I found later.",UNK
9512,"More expensive than walmart, menards....\nNot really a \""Farm\"" person. Went there when I got a coupon in the mail.",UNK
9513,Pools too crowded.Too long of line to check in. Its ok if they take my money at the tables but it was not right the maid stole $100 that we hid in closet. I will not stay there again.,UNK
9514,the space is weird and is in desperate need of some tlc.  the food is not my style.  it lacks flavor and the menu choices are just not interesting.,UNK
9515,Buffalo tenders were good.  Bartender was an absolute douche 6/20.  He was too worried about doing shots with his wanker buddies.,UNK
9516,"Food looks really pretty but it tastes terrible. Some are dry and some are just really salty. \nIf you are looking for pretty food go here.  If you are looking decent taste, avoid this place.",UNK
9517,"Veg burrito was ok, needed more cheese and flavor. Service was meh. Don't expect them to get your order right if you want it different than what's on the menu. I.E. no guac etc. I had higher hopes. :(",UNK
9518,Ive been there several time for menu selection. There have a lot of good menu to choose from  But the service is not good whenever I go there and the cleanness is bad even though they have open kitchen,UNK
9519,"They've remodeled but now there's less food and it's still all bland and cold. Even though it's cheap $6.99 for dinner. It still sucks, Never anything new and the service is iffy at best. Holidays are really bad.",UNK
9520,Tao reminds me of how much I love to dance and how much I'm so over clubbing.,UNK
9521,Went to get new tires on van price was right fast and speedy but their customer services sucks. I had to chace some one down to see if my van was ready. They just ignore you. I won't be back.,UNK
9522,"Eight bucks for \""natural water\""? Need I say more? The service was all right. The food, ok, but tiny portions. I'm not a big eater at all and I went and got a snack right after we ate.",UNK
9523,I ordered the Chicago dog the way I usually do like other Chicago dog places.  The Chicago dog here is looks good but is not tasty as Sonic's for $1.99 + tax.,UNK
9524,Decent. They have pretty good food. but it isn't anything to get excited about,UNK
9525,Food is okay for a sports bar.  Not the best and not the worst.  The place tends to be really loud so having a conversation can be a challenge.  Nice selection of sporting events on the tv.,UNK
9526,"I was really unimpressed by the quality of the food, especially for the price! It wasn't bad, but not somewhere I'll be going again.",UNK
9527,"Meh...had the green eggs and ham. Hubs had the big breakfast. Was okay--how can you go wrong with breakfast, though.  But I gotta admit that the fresh squeezed orange juice was awesome.  For the overall price, however , considered this restaurant overrated.",UNK
9528,Too expensive and they NEVER answer their phone so you cant make an appointment!,UNK
9529,Service is decent but food is highly overpriced for what it is. Will not eat here again.,UNK
9530,Make sure you check your order because they messed mine up. And because of that our plans for the night didn't happen because we had to wait for our food. Thanks a lot to the wonderful people of this establishment to ruin the only night we had in Vegas that was planned out ahead of time.,UNK
9531,"The sushi is great, but I am not a sushi fan.\n\nI ordered their Chicken Teriyaki bowl. Not good at all. Bleh.",UNK
9532,"Pretty good food, agreed on by party of three, but not so great service, even with only four booths occupied on a Saturday afternoon.",UNK
9533,Food is expensive for serving size.,UNK
9534,"The italian noodle with rib eye is great but the sauce which taste too light , and the noodle with shrimp and wonton, the soup almost no favor in it, no recommend the two dishes!!! anyway , it is nice place for low price !",UNK
9535,Been there 8 -10 times! Good quality sushi for all-you-can-eat but extremely rude waiters!,UNK
9536,Staff seemed overwhelmed. Service was nonexistent at times,UNK
9537,Food was terrible - service was good - prices have been raised twice in the past 6 months - now over priced -  no happy hour  but love the golf course -,UNK
9538,Drive thru is soooo sloooowww...  you would think I would just learn to go inside....,UNK
9539,"Not happy with the pharmacy here. Waited forever just to give them my prescription.  After them giving me an estimated time to come back ,which was one hour, I came back 2 hours later and my prescription was still not ready. Bad customer service.",UNK
9540,"Just really uninteresting and bland. Yes, very VERY boring. Wish we gone elsewhere.",UNK
9541,You had better like either pork or beef.  I don't.,UNK
9542,Sandi the waitress is terrible. food was ok.,UNK
9543,"Its basically fruit slushies and ice cream, prices are ok, but the flavors are really watered down. Over all, wasn't impressed in the times I've gone.",UNK
9544,$7.99 with a players card.\n Hamburgers made to order are okay. Roast beef carving station not enough to justify regular price of 10.99. Main St. Better value.,UNK
9545,"The Smokehouse Turkey Panini was good, but my Tortellini Alfredo was far too salty.  The French onion soup was too sweet. Ten dollars for a small serving of pasta and half a sandwich seems rather expensive. I don't see what all the fuss is about.",UNK
9546,I don't know if people have really eaten here or not but it isn't all that great. The salsa is bland and the meats are not seasoned at all. I don't think we will be back.,UNK
9547,They were nice but there was some Health inspector there and it didn't seem to be some routine check...and the staff seemed nervous and were doing a lot of whispering.,UNK
9548,Service has become slow and poor. Food still ok. We had to ask for water 5 times by walking up to waitress. Took a long time for bill. They need more service help now.,UNK
9549,"The 'burlesque' in the show was pretty limited. I was actually disappointed. The girls were attractive and talented dancers, but I really was anticipating at least a taste of Burlesque as the name implies.",UNK
9550,"Not horrible, but you could have the same food in the coffee shop. Nothing special, not worth any wait.",UNK
9551,"The club was alright, but I have a serious problem with the servers helping themselves to a 40 percent tip on the bottle service.  Use CAUTION when signing for anything as the servers cannot be trusted.",UNK
9552,"Just to echo the other reviewers: inattentive staff and unimpressive markdowns. There's not much else to add to that.  They're conveniently located, for what it's worth.",UNK
9553,I was not impressed with anything I have had here and probably will not return. The sushi rolls were small and left a sort of weird aftertaste in my mouth. Everything was just okay.,UNK
9554,"I guess you can't expect much from airport dining. If you HAVE to eat, this place is fine, I guess. Certainly nothing to brag about. It wasn't enjoyable or satisfying; it was just ... there.",UNK
9555,"I went there on Halloween night.  Very crowded, difficult to have a chance to actually have a good time.  Will try come back here on a regular night to actually check it out.",UNK
9556,Got my phone repaired here and was stoked with the price. About a month later (after the warranty expired) I dropped my phone on my bed and the screen shattered. Tape sticking out all over. Just didn't look as professional as I thought.,UNK
9557,Overpriced and my muffin was stale.  Not worth the $7 I spent on the muffin and coffee.  Will not go again.  Believe it is overpriced due to the area...,UNK
9558,"Food was bland and cold. Coffee was decaf . Mest up the orders, staff wasn't attentive.",UNK
9559,"Small pool, inconsistent service, overpriced under quality spa, and watch your bill for incorrect charges.\n\nI got a full set of gel acrylics at the spa. They were all peeling or broken off within 2 days.  Waste of money and time.",UNK
9560,Service advisor that greeted me was showing little interest of my LS issue.  They were running around in crisis trying to locate loaner car for someone else.  Not what I am use to by a Lexus dealership.  I drove away.,UNK
9561,"Pass\u00e9.  Used to be great but would not go back again.  This place used to be a happening, but now...not so much.  Needs a new concept and re-launch.  That's Las Vegas!",UNK
9562,"I got a good deal on Priceline, but was disappointed that it cost extra to use the pool, internet and park. Ridiculous!\n\nBtw, The room was nice.",UNK
9563,I wanted to like this place because it's close to my house and the owner was nice but my tan was really streaky the next day.,UNK
9564,Super smokey inside. The day bartender has real attitude. Not all good. Friendly crowd.,UNK
9565,The food was only decent and overpriced. The main reason I wouldn't go back is the uncomfortable atmosphere - something is just off.,UNK
9566,"It is a greasey burger, their onions are strong even when cooked which usually carmelizes and mellow them out.  I enjoyed Smashburger a bit more",UNK
9567,"Upon further reflection, I have realized: It's JUST A HOTDOG.",UNK
9568,Server was the best part of this place she had great customer service. The cups our waters came is were dirty with food particles. I ordered scrambled eggs with cheese but they only gave me scrambled eggs. The kitchen claimed it had cheese but it didn't. Kitchen staff was rude yelling out loud about it.,UNK
9569,Walnut shrimp was good. Sesame chicken was over-fried orange chicken with sesame seeds sprinkled over them. Noodles were too dry with not enough gravy & too salty. Don't recommend eating there.,UNK
9570,This is a standard coffee shop.  We had a long line and a bit of a wait. Cinnamon roll french toast was good. Salmon cream cheese spinach omelet  had  lots of good salmon. The cream cheese was a bit odd - it was in chunks. Service was good.,UNK
9571,"Eh.  Just eh.  The papusas are decent.  The chips and salsa have to have been store bought....and who the hell puts a \""cell phone store\"" inside of a restaurant?  Hello, ghetto!",UNK
9572,"Pros- Located in a good location by the Boardwalk, beautiful and great for a night out or date night.\n\nCons-Sushi rolls are tiny and not worth the price you pay for! If you want quality sushi; this isn't the place to go.",UNK
9573,"My husband and I used to go here a lot, but under new management and different workers, the food just isn't that great anymore.",UNK
9574,"for reals, don't do it.  You can find cheap tables here but I wouldn't stay at the hotel unless you got a super good deal and you don't mind a lot of noise.",UNK
9575,Atmosphere is great! Food is not. Had the pasta w meatballs which consisted of a bowl of gummy flavorless pasta w 2 small meatballs for $15.00. I left hungry and went home and ate a PB&J sandwich.,UNK
9576,Food was not good at all. Eggplant park tasted frozen. Only thing good about this place was the singer and the secret entrance.,UNK
9577,"Really slow service at lunch time. Seemed completely confused, unprepared and understaffed for the volume of customers which didn't appear to be excessive considering the time of day. Get a second star for good food but the service is sub-par at best.",UNK
9578,Service was horrible! There were tours going on and we had a 20 minutes to get my food order!  Food is usually good here. The manager was very kind.,UNK
9579,Went back for round 2 and again chicken was burnt.,UNK
9580,"This place is OK, nothing special and if you come mid afternoon there is not much dim sum to choose from.  There are better places to get dim sum.",UNK
9581,"The $5 lunch special is a burger and fries.  Not the best burger I've ever had, but the fries were very good and for that price they are cheaper than McDonald's.",UNK
9582,The service was good but the food was not. Even my kids wouldn't eat their Mac and cheese. It was totally tasteless. Won't be going back.,UNK
9583,Too bad the coffee is so so.  I've been wanting a coffee shop in the hood.,UNK
9584,"Slow service, mediocre food. The only reason we went was because we had a gift card and I probably won't be back.",UNK
9585,There is one thing I get here and it is awesome...THE PANANG CURRY.\n\nEverything else is a drop off ...but the Panang is fantastic.,UNK
9586,Everytime I come here I always tell myself ill never come back. After a while I forget and then I go and am reminded of why I didn't like it in the first place. Their smoothies are too thick and are pricey. Not for me.,UNK
9587,FYI... This place is no longer at The RIO,UNK
9588,Pink's seems to be undergoing three changes as time goes on.\n1)Price increase\n2)Lower quality\n3)More customers,UNK
9589,"Fast, friendly, but flavorless. Beef and broccoli was tender but had the flavor of water",UNK
9590,"loved the swedish fish cocktail - not a huge fan of the fried chicken and waffles.. enjoyed the fried mac and cheese balls... not a priority to go back, wouldn't recommend",UNK
9591,I had the peach margarita which was recommended as the best marg on the menu by the bartender. It was not very good. I would not go to this restaurant again. I would go back to Blanco!!!,UNK
9592,Cool Sports Bar but the food was sub-par and Bland. Loved the Bloody Mary Bar but would not eat there again.,UNK
9593,Warm beer mugs and warm beer...not a good combination if you are a brewery.\n\nPlease get some frosted mugs in that place!,UNK
9594,"Had a bad experience here with an unfriendly staff about 4 months ago, came here recently with a friend for drinks and the experience was much improved. Still can't kick that bitter first impression taste.",UNK
9595,"We drove all the way from Tempe because of the 4 stars rating.\nI don't know if it's because of Monday, not many customers,\nMost of the dishes are cold.",UNK
9596,"The food was way overpriced in my opinion.  But, it reminded me of Hawaii karaoke bars and we had a good time.",UNK
9597,Great steak!  Poor service.   \n\nPeople go where they're invited... They come back where they're appreciated.  \n\nNot sure if I'll be back.,UNK
9598,"it seems strange, but there doesn't seem to be anyone around....??? this seems like an empty mall parking lot.......is it for real?",UNK
9599,So the waiter brought a me cheese enchilada and chicken taco even though I ordered a beef enchilada and chicken taco I informed him of this and he looked at me in the face and asked me if I wanted a side of beef.  I will not be back,UNK
9600,"We were so excited to try this place out for our anniversary,  only to be disappointed and ready to go after 20 minutes!  Service was okay, Food was okay,  kind of bland and the music was too loud to hear ourselves talk. Probably a first and last for us!",UNK
9601,The people up front are nice but my pickup order was cold and the food was HIGHLY mediocre.  I wish I could say it was better but its really just  not good.,UNK
9602,Did not like the pizza puffs or the garlic bread. Too much cheese in the puffs and the bread was bland.  Prices are average as well as the service. Not worth a try... foodwise,UNK
9603,Friendly staff and great options for sauce. But quality of food of comparable to cafeteria food. Feel like Im eating at high school again.,UNK
9604,Slowest delivery ever! Not worth it,UNK
9605,"Not that any Filiberto's location is high-class, but this Filiberto's is the kind of place where it doesn't matter whether or not the employees spit in my food because either way I'm going to eat my burrito under the assumption that they did.",UNK
9606,"Just wasn't impressed.  Pad Thai was really gummy.  The Panang chicken curry wasn't that good.  Eggrolls, were just eh.  The papaya salad was delicious though.  The server was very nice.    Maybe I was there on an off day?",UNK
9607,"Another ridiculous Friday nite wait at LGO for Curbside. Couldn't even park. And, the order was incomplete. They gave me a $50 gift card. But that only means I have to go back to use it. Is it worth it?",UNK
9608,"Out of steak on a Monday, before the real dinner crowd gets here. Who runs out of steak in Las Vegas?? Love Guy on TV, but probably won't be back here.",UNK
9609,"The place has good wings, but only if you order them at the restaurant, they are far worse when you order takeout (I've ordered in both at the location and takeout more than once, so I feel this is consistent). All of the rest of the food is very average.",UNK
9610,"Low quality, tasteless hot dog.  Definitely NOT worth the drive from East Mesa.",UNK
9611,I miss the ciabatta bun burger that had that awesome sauce. Please bring it back.,UNK
9612,"Wide selection, but customer service wasn't all that great",UNK
9613,"keep hearing mixed reviews about this place so I got myself a chicken burrito there today.  It was ok, nothing special, they charge extra for the veggies, hot sauce was not spicy at all and the rice was meh.  Chipotle is way better, imo",UNK
9614,As a follow up to my previous review - the practice manager called me to apologize for the bad experience and remedy the issue.  I appreciate that they took the effort to reach to me after the fact and let me know that they would address the bad experience I had.,UNK
9615,"When you click the stars for two stars its says \""Meh. I've experienced better.\"" \n\nthat pretty much says it all.",UNK
9616,"Not much meat selection,  really slow,  even though,I wasn't crowded.  The meat was really some poor cuts. Ie sirloin.   The salad bar was boring. I have to say I came Here about a year ago and was really impressed.",UNK
9617,Poor representation of a BBQ place.  Food was at best so-so.  Lots of places much better nearby.,UNK
9618,Messy long lines of course makes me craaaazy,UNK
9619,There's almost always a line out the door at this post office.  It is what it is.  Only go here if you absolutely have to.  Otherwise try the Automated Postal Center at Albertson's.... you can get most things done without waiting for slow humans.,UNK
9620,"You definitely get your money's worth..only $14. I in a hurry is say its worth it, but if you want a real massage and your nails to really get taken care of..I'd go somewhere else.",UNK
9621,"It was ok.  Maybe I just ordered the wrong items, but I was not impressed with the quality, on the other hand the quantity was very impressive.",UNK
9622,"It was over priced, the food was poor, and the atmosphere was nothing special.  They have a good amount of beer to choose from, but that doesn't make up for the other short comings.",UNK
9623,"First time, last time. I could tolerate the obnoxious staff if the food was good, but it wasn't. The foods not terrible, it's average. I'll just go to Roberto's where the food is better and the people actually seem to care about the client.",UNK
9624,"I thought people at the dmv are friendly but my guess is wrong. The lady who helped me was being sarcastic and being rude coz maybe I was the last person she was going to help. But still, they need better training and they need to show better customer service.",UNK
9625,"Great poker room, entitled poker dealers, Meh service, Meh food that is severely overpriced,",UNK
9626,"The rooms are very so so and the hospitality was non existent, I will not be going back!,",UNK
9627,"\""overpriced and kinda lame. not sure why everyone raves about it\""",UNK
9628,"Friendly girl taking the order, boss in back asking her questions while she was trying to make my order. I guess he is more concerned about his work then his customers... Coffee was good but I was looking for a drive thru and there was none.",UNK
9629,"For all the hype, I wasn't impressed. The food was good, but I thought the prices were high for what you get. I would try it again though, to see if my mind changes.",UNK
9630,Slow unfriendly service. Desert area of buffet was never stocked and was dirty.  I ordered the wings and the wings were TINY.,UNK
9631,"So so, bar food.",UNK
9632,Terrible service. Mediocre food.,UNK
9633,"The food is OK and the service is consistent -- consistently irritating. Why do servers look right at you, see you waving at them, then proceed to lazily wipe a vacant table when no one is waiting, rather than take the orders of the people who are???",UNK
9634,The residential apartments above Maharani have serious cockroach problems.,UNK
9635,"While pho  is within price range of other places, I can not say the same for their appetizer and rice dish.  Their rice dish is at $14 plate.  I think this place is trying to come off as an expensive Vietnamese restaurant but the location and ugly sign says otherwise.",UNK
9636,"Free entrance, free drinks, still only two stars. The place was kind of empty, even at midnight, and only a few people were dancing.",UNK
9637,Guy was talking on his cellphone while making my smoothie. He was nice but still was not following health codes.,UNK
9638,"Good bean dip, OK chips. OK green chile, although they need a medium green option.  I don't understand why when going from CO closer to Mexico I can't find anywhere with mole sauce?",UNK
9639,Wild menu..huge portions .. Just ok.,UNK
9640,Well service sucked I had a group of people took 10min for some one to get to are table I had to get management to get involved not a good experience,UNK
9641,Why is it Airline staff always seem so unmotived to help?,UNK
9642,"This particular Goodwill store is always a mess.  Rarely can I find what I'm looking for, with decent quality, but I have found a few things worth while.  If I have the chance to go to a Goodwill farther away I will, even though this is the closest to me.",UNK
9643,Not fans. The restaurant wasn't even busy and we waited way too long. Pizza wasn't flavorful and ingredients weren't fresh.,UNK
9644,I went there for Lunch. The portion of it is too small and pricy. the taste is just okay. We cant really read the waiter's writing on the check (only numbers). Really need an improvement,UNK
9645,"I had breakfast, and didn't eat much. Enough said. I thought this was a high end casino, but it falls short big time in this joint!",UNK
9646,"Worst bbq I have ever had. The meat was tough, fatty, and their rub was bland as hell! The only reason I gave them 2 stars instead of 1 was because the mac n cheese I got was fairly decent",UNK
9647,Thrift store items at department store prices. Pricing is based upon the brand of  clothing/item so there really isn't a such thing as a good deal here.,UNK
9648,I wanted to get a Kim kardashian lollipop but it costs freaken $25 Wtf!!! I would pay 5 dollars for that. So sad I couldn't get the lollipop wahhh that's all.,UNK
9649,This review is  for the salon only i found it extrimely over price for a blowout and some curls that took about 35 minutes the charged the ridiculous amount of $ 150.00 dlls\n\nThe hair stylist was professional but i will never get the service again.,UNK
9650,Some friends took us here to eat.  Everything was OK.   The pepperoni pizza was average.  There was not very much pepperoni.  The hot wings were nothing special but the honey wings were very good.  Service and atmosphere was good.,UNK
9651,1.8/5 stars - Only reason to get this pizza is if you are a college student and only have 5 bucks. But let's face it even crappy pizza tastes good.,UNK
9652,please change your hours on your yelp page they do not match the hours posted on the front door...,UNK
9653,Over-rated!!!!!!!!! My steak was overly seasoned. It was way too salty for my liking. Everyone else at my table was completely disappointed with their order as well. Not worth wasting your time here.,UNK
9654,"For what it is, it's fine.  It is birthday party hell all the time.  But I'm not a fan of kids parties and unsupervised children running my kid over.",UNK
9655,Customer service was good.\n\nThe portions were large but not so tasty. I wanted hot tea to drink and I was given a Linton tea bag with hot water which was tasteless.,UNK
9656,"Yeah,I'm going to have to agree with everyone that this place is all hype...only good thing was that I didn't have to wait in line..the first time I tried it was more than an hour wait so I left...",UNK
9657,Terribly expensive for a sandwich you could have at another restaurant with better atmosphere. Just an expensive Subway.  Shocking that they are still in business with the better options out there.,UNK
9658,"This place has a good rep, I just don't like it. The pizza is way too oily or greasy however you want to call it. Not for me. I hate any food that's covered in oil.",UNK
9659,"Gut bomb.\n\nFilled with more rice and beans than anything else, so not even really worth the price.",UNK
9660,"I took my parents here because it's one of their favorite places, but I wasn't that impressed.  The service was impeccable, but the food - not much different than Outback or Texas Roadhouse.",UNK
9661,"The food is not up to par, nothing seems fresh. Something tells me the microwave is working overtime in the back. Went to just drink one night with my husband and the bartender was less than attentive. Would really recommend a whole menu overhaul.",UNK
9662,"I've tried their pasta and, more recently, their pizza, and both were very unremarkable, which has been quite disappointing considering what I had heard from others. The pizza in particular seemed bland and tiresome.",UNK
9663,This spot just doesn't do it for me.  Flavors fall short.  Vegetables are over cooked and soggy.  \n\nThe service is fine. The location is nice. Overall the food was mediocre.,UNK
9664,It's not one of my fave haunts. I heard about their shake from a friend. I thought it was just OK. I prefer McDonald's or In & Out's Milkshakes.,UNK
9665,Long wait for the food and the food didn't taste very good.  The only good thing about the restaurant is the huge United States art that is displayed in the dining room.  The kids enjoyed looked at the states.,UNK
9666,Overall I just wasn't impressed. Our waitress didn't seem to know the menu and it took her forever to get anything done. My main dish was decent but I have no plans to return.,UNK
9667,"Monday night, $56 for 2 just because it was Crab night? Neither me nor my dinner date are into seafood and the rest of the selections were terrible. Mediocre at best. Never again.",UNK
9668,"Just checked in and found out that there's no wifi in the room, no HDTV and you'd think they'd offer a discount or credit to us disabled veterans on Veteran's Day Weekend. .... never stay here again.",UNK
9669,Location is good but this place is major dump.  Many of the casinos charge the same amoint but u get a lot more like carpets that are not cakef im filth because they havnt been replaced since the 80s.,UNK
9670,"Burger was too rare for \""medium\"". Very mediocre food. The bartender argued about it being rare. She was slow in taking my drink order",UNK
9671,"So disappointed. Used to be fabulous. Great ambiance and service, but food is mediocre at best and way too expensive. Hope it gets back to where it was. Very $ for quality.",UNK
9672,Food OK... poor service... margaritas are much smaller than they are in locations outside of airport,UNK
9673,Wings are small and WAY overpriced.,UNK
9674,Nice decor. Food tasteless. Taste sooooo chain resturants. Totally not worth the price.,UNK
9675,Place needs an update big time. Room and beds are decent. Elevator and hallways are run down. Neighborhood is under construction but overall it's ok. Lots of bars and night life. Would give it another star but not for the price I paid.,UNK
9676,I had a bad experience with customer service.,UNK
9677,ordered sliders... the inside was purple. the Caesar salad was nothing to write home about. but the pretzel sticks were yummy.,UNK
9678,"Barro's has been our Go-To take-out for years. Last night we got a large cheese and noticed the crust has changed and not for the better. I hope it was a fluke, maybe someone forgot a key ingredient.",UNK
9679,"I don't know what it was but when I ordered and my food brought to me everything was good but as I continued with my meal I became more and more unimpressed, and kinda grossed out...the flavour just was not for me.",UNK
9680,I ve been twice and haven't liked it either time. The lines are crazy long and by the time you get the food it's not good! The hummus come like water and the meat has been undercooked both times! Won't be back sorry to say!!,UNK
9681,"I have to agree with other reviews here. Love the merchandise, but most of the employees are not very friendly or helpful.",UNK
9682,"This is NOT the best galatto in the valley. Although the view of the fountain is nice, it was way over priced for the lack of flavor. It wasn't bad, but is there such a thing as bad galatto?",UNK
9683,"It was alright.. I've had better pizza elsewhere. The staff seemed too bust to \""deal with me\"", but hey, maybe I just went on a busy night.",UNK
9684,"This place started out being great, but it seems that every time I go there the food gets more expensive and the margaritas get weaker. It's a really popular place but I am not on the bandwagon.",UNK
9685,For those of you who don't Pho-know any better; this is pretentious Pho.  You're paying for the modern orange walls and acrylic chairs.  Stick to Pho Chandler.,UNK
9686,The place was not hard to find at all just follow the smell once on the third floor. The pizza quality was average at best. I would not go back there is average pizza on the strip.,UNK
9687,"I really liked the staff here, but the facility is substandard (cramped, bad seating, no bathroom inside), and it seems to attract unnerving customers.",UNK
9688,"Touriest trap pure and simple. Nice staff, but always so over crowed hard to get service and look at guns. Better options in town. Try sportsmans or Bass Pro.",UNK
9689,Below average. So many other places to go. Don't waste your monry,UNK
9690,"Portions are massive, prices are high and the taste...well I've had better. Now I am speaking of breakfast, I haven't had lunch there yet. I don't even like the bagels they sell in the grocery store, the store brand tastes better.",UNK
9691,"Welcome to Verizon. Have a seat.\n\nCustmer service waits are extremely long even at off times,  \n\nThe two stars are earned SOLELY by the staff who, while overworked and likely underpaid were quite attentive and polite.",UNK
9692,They have a nice dining area but I have to say their food isn't up to par. I recommend The Big Fat Greek restraunt on tatum & shea,UNK
9693,It was so crowded and the line was so long. There was barely any room to dance on the dance floor.,UNK
9694,Not great,UNK
9695,Overpriced bar relying on a captive audience from the hostel upstairs. Nothing special.,UNK
9696,Service was below average\n\nThe steak I had was just okay\n\nThe scallops appetizer was great\n\nThere are better places to eat in Vegas imo.,UNK
9697,"I don't understand why people love it so much, I think they're just like a sandwich you could make in 2 minutes at your house.  I guess it's cheap semi-healthy fastfood, just not for me.",UNK
9698,"the service is absolutely horrible, took 15 minutes to get the wrong beer. the server clearly hate serving the customers and is completely oblivious to us. hope the food is better.",UNK
9699,"Good but not great, and overpriced. I don't understand what all the hype is about.",UNK
9700,"Only because I know the food is good that I give it 2 stars, but otherwise the service is absolutely horrendous.  I won't be coming back, cause the food isn't good enough to excuse the poor service",UNK
9701,Food came out cold! \nAlso the taste was off on the wing sauce and they wouldn't exchange it for another sauce so I wasted money. The management seems rude! I recommend not going here.,UNK
9702,"Drove by, saw the line and how small the place was and just kept on driving!",UNK
9703,"I like the free WiFi and easy security lines, but otherwise this airport is completely unremarkable. It's Vegas, right, so the airport is basically a means to an end. Blah food options and low-end airport amenities make McCarran a bore.",UNK
9704,"This location is always out of glazed donuts??? Then the girl gives me attitude.  Get a clue, you're a donut shop.  P.s you still have Halloween marketing signs on your counter too.  Obviously not very well run.",UNK
9705,Two words. Smoke everywhere. . The rooms smell like smoke. They leave ash trays everywhere for anyone to smoke.  Everyone smokes outside their rooms. My son who has asthma could hardly play in the pool because everyone smoked right in the pool. . It was  disgusting!,UNK
9706,Formerly Pharoah's Pheast.  Definately spacious dining area.  But the food was just OK.,UNK
9707,"Good food, reasonable prices, ok atmosphere, but very rude employees who act like they are doing you a favor....except for the one guy at the register.",UNK
9708,"We needed a quick dinner in order catch a show or something. My memory is a bit fuzzy. BUT, I do remember paying $10 for two slices of pizza and a soda. The slices were small, greasy and had obviously been sitting in the glass heat locker a long while.",UNK
9709,Wanted to try because of all the great reviews but sadly a little disappointed. Service was really great but unfortunately the food was mediocre.,UNK
9710,Not a bad place but it seems small and very limited on what they carry. The store is neat and clean but there is just lack of choices.,UNK
9711,The food tastes amazing but the portions are tiny and the price is ridiculously high!,UNK
9712,"Food is good,but service is awful. The server even rolled her eyes to me . I don't want to come back again.",UNK
9713,SUPER SLOW!!!! If you are in any kind of hurry don't go here.,UNK
9714,Overrated.   Plus they are so full of it that they don't think they need a sign on Chandler Avenue.  And because if no sign I forget its tucked away in the corner.    Anyways been there twice in the last 6 months and not impressed - more of a novelty for me than anything.,UNK
9715,"I ordered Dante burger and parmesan fries. For a joint called \""I love Burgers\"" I felt that the name of the place spoke more than the burger ever could. Bobby's Burger Palace definitely has a better blue cheese burger than here.",UNK
9716,2 stars because of terrible customer service.. EILEEN rolled her eyes at me for adding on to my order at the window.,UNK
9717,"I don't know, maybe I am spoiled by Old Mexico, but this place didn't do it for me.  The seasoning was non existent in the beef taco, and enchiladas, I couldn't even finish.  I won't be going back!",UNK
9718,two words:\n\nYogurt\nLand\n\nsuck it mojo!,UNK
9719,"Service is slow, even when it's not crowded. Food is bland. I've been here a few times, and I always leave wondering how I spent so much money with such little satisfaction.",UNK
9720,"Won't be back.  Food was bland, coke was flat, & 3 shrimp on the salad.  $50.00 lunch with tip.  Service was excellent.  Typical bar joint...nothing special.",UNK
9721,"Average bar food and incredibly over-priced for what you get. The menu items are not as described. Great atmosphere, stay away from the food, go for drinks only.",UNK
9722,"The food here is okay.  Wings, BBQ, Bar foods. The floor here is always super slippery.  It doesn't matter if I am wearing heels or sneakers.  I just don't get why the floor is like and ice skating rink.",UNK
9723,Cheap tequila? Decent deal for a restaurant....except the waitress spilled a bunch of shots all over our table and didn't apologize.\n\nAlso service was very slow for an empty restaurant.,UNK
9724,"Meh. I've experienced better. Food is typical bar food... Not much \""hawaiian\"" unless you count the scantily dressed girls..It's great if you're a dude and you wanna catch a sports game on their big screens..",UNK
9725,The bouncers are dickheads for no reasons. There are plenty of better places to go on Mill.,UNK
9726,To sum it up: I sat down where President Bush sat. The food was as awful as his tenure as president. Loved the ambiance though.,UNK
9727,Note says it will re-open March 1st but when we went to location it was now Charlie's Bar.,UNK
9728,Food is great! Service sucks!,UNK
9729,Do not go to this location on your lunch break. I have been here twice in the last month and have waited in the drive-through line over 20 minutes each time. The food is good and hot but the wait time is horrible.,UNK
9730,Food is good when you can get it. The service is atrocious. Tried it twice and the first time service was ok and the second time I wanted to end my life or the servers,UNK
9731,"Overrated brunch. I shared 2 dishes: the scotch eggs and the full monty, which is a combination of all the options for breakfast. It wasn't really tasty or that memorable.",UNK
9732,"Overpriced and slightly biased. Didn't allow certain people to go in because of their no jeans dress code, yet allowed others. Makes no sense to me.",UNK
9733,"I am not impressed with their food, Taco Bell is far better.",UNK
9734,"Not a fan !!! Just another company with a fancy slogan and web page !! If u have little projects it's kind of a waste of their time , is exactaly how they made me feel ! We will see if they pay attention enough to get the job done right .....",UNK
9735,Went there this past Saturday for Big Petes new CD release.  Always fun.  Waiting 15 minutes for a drink however is too long.  Older female bartender strategically ignores you unless she is bored.   Door guys were cool.,UNK
9736,A real let down after all the hype about it.\nNothing particuarly special and i have seen as good in pretty much any museums science corners.\nThe building is also rather vile/blatent in sticking out in its surroundings.,UNK
9737,Really disappointed with their selection this year and the only really cute styles they had were in size 5 in women's pretty much a waste of time unless you're getting the standard solid colors,UNK
9738,"Nice Pub for a quiet Drink,",UNK
9739,"This place is pretty trashy, I'd rather smoke my hookah at home.",UNK
9740,"Don't like it. The coffee is weird tasting. I tried again, and again, unimpressed.",UNK
9741,"If anyone says this place is decent or good obviously has not had good pita sandwiches. The prices were ridiculous regardless of location, skimpy portions and seriously lacks in flavor. Had the Gyro and Falafel. Will never return.",UNK
9742,"Long waits (2+ hours at dinner time weekends)\n\nNo reservations\n\nGood food, not great.",UNK
9743,Not a huge fan. It wasn't super flavorful and I felt it was a bit too greasy. I think there are def. better options. I also saw this microwave as previously mentioned..?!?,UNK
9744,"I have gone to this Starbucks many times over the last 4 years because it is the closest one to my house.  They have friendly staff and prompt service, however, they are frequently out of most of the non-drink items on their menu unless you get there before 8am.",UNK
9745,Slow service at Lons tonight. Great atmosphere.,UNK
9746,No wonder blockbuster is going out of business. They arent very observant when i was needing help. they were very rude and didnt care to tell me all of the information i was looking for from them. its very dirty and not well organized.,UNK
9747,"Not very happy on this visit tonight. Food seemed to be cold and not very fresh. I guess the best time to go is when they open for lunch and the food is hot and fresh, plus no kids have contaminated anything yet with their dirty hands! Ew.",UNK
9748,Too expensive for a burger without fries. The service is good but definitly not worthed.,UNK
9749,"The food is ridiculously poor, except for the chicken wings which I could eat pound after pound. A good place for afterwork drinkage though.",UNK
9750,Great fish. Everything else pretty much a disaster. Service juvenile. Hours for follow up on simple asks. Ran out of unfiltered saki at 7:30pm. Give them a year to pull it together.,UNK
9751,"Went for lunch on 3/21/2014 thinking I just found an awesome new gluten-free, vegetarian place and I walk up to a locked door. No sign, nothing on customer voice mail. Left highly disappointed and hungry.",UNK
9752,"The pizza is overpriced, as is everything else. Also, the food isn't good. The salads weren't fresh and the pizza lacks taste. Fortunately for you, Sorento's is nearby as are several other better pizza places. Service and atmosphere however, are excellent.",UNK
9753,"Had lunch there 10/13.  The place was packed.  Good service. Food was ok, not bad but not memorable in any way.  Fair price.  Too many other and better places nearby to go back.",UNK
9754,"They weren't serving dinner when I was ready to eat, so I just had the happy hour sushi. It was a bit too nouveau fusion for my taste. I just wanted normal sushi. I would try it again, but not for the sushi.",UNK
9755,The screens are small here compared to other movie theaters,UNK
9756,This place has good cheap eats. But the service and clientele have gone way down. This is a played out garbage place.,UNK
9757,"Cheap and terrible, oh god if it wasnt for poker i wonder what this place would be like...terrible layout to the hotel, too much traffic around it...but go ahead stay here save some bucks to gamble with!\n\n\nTFR",UNK
9758,Waitress (jen) was nice but we waited very long for the food. Food also not too tasty. Ordered the chicken crepes and were cold when they came out.,UNK
9759,"It's inexpensive, but it's really small. I didn't find anything special about it.",UNK
9760,"I ultimately thought that this was a good breakfast, but the service was slow (albeit, friendly), especially when it came to restocking the buffet. The price is high and comparable to other continental type breakfasts at other hotels. For $20, I would expect much more.",UNK
9761,We came here the day after New Years for their brunch special and waited an hour for our food...and then food came out cold. I will not be back,UNK
9762,"I never actually got to eat at this place, as they put a flier on my front door. I called to have some food delivered, during their hours of operation... No one ever answered the phone. Guess they must not need the business.",UNK
9763,20 Minute wait per dish. Never coming here again. Food is decent but if it takes this long who is going to wait. I got sick of waiting I left in the middle and went to a different restaurant. You CANNOT make people wait this long and expect people to be happy.,UNK
9764,"I had a carne asada taco and carnitas taco. Both were pretty bland. Don't know what they were marinated in, but not much flavor. The red and green salsas are also mediocre. Would not go back and wouldn't recommend.",UNK
9765,"Good dessert, but not worth the hype or the price. Plus this was the 3rd time we had tried to go, but got held up the other two due to crowds and horrible hosts at the door...this time we were finally able to get in. Overall not a fan.",UNK
9766,"This is like 80's decor LVAC, probably the worst of the chain I have been to.  The equipment is a bit old but they have most of the same amenities as other locations.",UNK
9767,"The food wasn't very good.\nThe enchiladas were more like microwave food and he fish tacos were dry :(\nThe location isn't very nice too, right of the casino lobby.\nI wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.",UNK
9768,"Wow,  i send a lot of guest here.  Lately they been coming back complaining about the quality of the food.  I personally went to shop it.  Wow what happened.",UNK
9769,Just not a big fan of this place. I never liked the hamburgers so I tried the fish. Overcooked and dry. Ended up not eating the fish and filling up on the fries. Thanks for nothing. Won't be back,UNK
9770,"Food was either bland or overpowered with salt. Get ready for microwaved dinner. \n\nMediocre service, food came late.",UNK
9771,Nice place to have a drink and watch sports. Not ideal if you want quality food. Ribs were bone dry and barely edible. Crab legs were decent and there were plenty of them. Prices aren't bad.,UNK
9772,Tried scheduling a dinner for a group of people. James the manager said he had another call coming in an hung up on me. With this kind of service I will not bring my group!,UNK
9773,"Vegas, your facade of exclusivity evades me. I'm not waiting in line dressed in 4\""+ heels to dance to crap music while sweat drips down the walls.",UNK
9774,Great music,UNK
9775,Management or lack thereof have ruined this place - zero service and food has become completely mediocre..,UNK
9776,"No idea how this place gets such high ratings. Service is terrible, slow, uninformative, no follow up, not good.  Food was average.",UNK
9777,I have tasted better Filipino food.,UNK
9778,"Eh, always okay nothing to write home about. They never have good DJs in general, but the place is nice overall. Good service in general.",UNK
9779,Below average Italian food and miserable service on the night we were there. I was back on a second occasion with a group and had only a slightly better experience. 2 stars for a nice patio.,UNK
9780,"Really not that good. Strong doesn't equal Perfect (Margarita).  Jambalaya okay, not great.  Wait staff going through motions.  Spend your Vegas dollars elsewhere .",UNK
9781,"Terrible hostess, doesn't have communication with guests, isn't respectful or friendly and ignore customers",UNK
9782,"This place looks very dirty. I don't know if it is, but I didn't feel very comfortable eating there. I did eat there, though, and the food was pretty mediocre. Nothing had much flavor or spice. I would not come here again.",UNK
9783,"Since it was cold outside, I ordered a hot chocolate. When I got it, it was warm (closer to the cold side). Very disappointed.",UNK
9784,"Food is just as good as it was a few years back, but service is just terrible. If you want slow service this is the place to go. Used to be a regular here but no more!",UNK
9785,The employees definitely needs more customer service training and problem solving to better serve customers,UNK
9786,Food was good but not having a corkage fee was ridiculous. Drank water. Manager claimed it was against Nevada law... Not so. Never coming back.,UNK
9787,Makeup staff is rude.,UNK
9788,"Terrible employees. They mumble inaudibly when speaking, don't listen to your order and are all around unfriendly. I have never felt to uncomfortable while ordering food.",UNK
9789,Not worth the wait. From the reviews I was expecting more.  Pasta over cooked not much sauce and really just not worth it.....sorry!,UNK
9790,"The appetizers are small potions but have flavor. The pasta was interesting and seasoned well. The service was horrible, bring your own food for snacks while you are waiting for your waiter.",UNK
9791,I was just disappointed in the food and the price.\n\nBut then again they do serve beer,UNK
9792,"The burgers were alright, but not worth the price to me, and one of the managers was really rude to my mom when we went. Probably wont be going back any time soon.",UNK
9793,I've had lunch here a few times but have never really been impressed. My last experience was probably just that. The food is nothing special and the service seems to always be worse. Not sure the servers like walking up the stairs to the top dining area.,UNK
9794,First time here. ..3 bites in here and I pull a half red half white hair out of my mouth. Utterly disgusted. Ugh. What a waste. AND they don't have regular cones. Ugh. Disappointment,UNK
9795,I am very glad there is a sonic finally close to my home. I really just like to come here for the beverages. Why is the service so slow every single time I come?,UNK
9796,"Decent local pub.  Food is mediocre...beer selection is not substantial.  Can get noisy and tight.  Beantown Tavern accross the parking lot is better, but only marginally.",UNK
9797,"Not a huge fan, but my husband whats his burger with egg...YUCK!  Although now he doesn't eat meat, so he opted for the patty melt with the meat patty substitute....defeats the purpose of going their at all.",UNK
9798,"I don't normally mind the Hard Rock Cafe at all, but this location was bad.\n\nFood was blah.  Service was slow.  Food took FOREVER to come out.\n\nVery overpriced and this place should be skipped.",UNK
9799,Okay. Went for round 2. Took 15 minutes for anyone to even acknowledge I was even there.  Even after I saw one of the owners sitting a few feet from me. Lesson learned will not be back for round 3.,UNK
9800,Went Way downhill in last few yrs I guess.  Crappy server...mediocre food and beverages for too much money.   Too bad...we need more decent restaurants on the west side,UNK
9801,The food is nothing spectacular. The only reason to go is because kids eat free on tuesday.,UNK
9802,"Bon, c'est pas le meilleur Ramen que je connaisse.",UNK
9803,"I had the California Burger. It was good but not excellent, and certainly not the best burger in Madison. I went with three other people and they agreed. We should have went to Five Guys.",UNK
9804,"Food was great, service was beyond slow. Took 45 mins to get entr\u00e9e and the place was dead. I'll get takeout if there is a next time.",UNK
9805,"Although the pizza is super big, it's cold. Not very good. Maybe that's why it's cheap.",UNK
9806,Service was okay. Nothing special. Tasted like standard take-out. Not impressed.,UNK
9807,Went to a gala here. It was very disappointing. I wouldn't buy a plate with my own money.,UNK
9808,Very small and crowded compared to other whole foods. Selection smaller but still very nice.,UNK
9809,The buns were pasty and not toasted enough and the meat was overcooked and dry.  Just a notch above Carl's Jr.,UNK
9810,It's as if they used an oatmeal base to form a selection of Deli item imposters to create one of the blandest sandwiches that I have ever eaten. \nHeed the warnings and go to Phillips or Sbarro.,UNK
9811,After eating at the Flavor Buffet we decided that we liked it the food was good and the lines were not bad. My only complaint is there is no locals special. So no incentive to drive to the strip for ok food.,UNK
9812,Flys everyywhere while im trying to eat! Its soo gross!!!!! Food is average! Its nothing special! I wouldnt go back,UNK
9813,Decent food and service. The place was all hipped up by a friend so I was a little let down. I'm pretty sure I would not go there again.,UNK
9814,"I was not impressed with their Buffalo Burger at all.  The service at our table was so/so, however, at the bar, they were pretty efficient and friendly.  I may be back for drinks, but not for food.",UNK
9815,"Rude staff, messy place, dirty floors, but it gets the job done and is very convenient!",UNK
9816,"Having grown up in the South, the food does not compare well with the BBQ I grew up with.  TeX Mex was marginal at best.  Ridiculous price for a tiny pour of bourbon.  Will not return.",UNK
9817,"It was OK, nothing special.  The portions were pretty good, but overall, I felt it was on the pricey side for what was offered.",UNK
9818,"Food quality seems to vary quite a bit.  On my last visit, the chicken was dry at best, and the egg rolls were left in oil for too long.  There are better places to go in the area for Chinese food.",UNK
9819,"Mediocre in nearly every way. The food is bland and unmemorable, the pricing is a little high for what you get. The service is generally pretty good. There are better breakfast options not too far away.",UNK
9820,"Not even as good as the hot dogs at IKEA, which are 50 cents.",UNK
9821,It was a long wait for breakfast and club sandwich....but when the food did come out the hashbrowns looked like they had not been on the grill at all?  They fixed it slowly upon request.,UNK
9822,"Tiny portions and overpriced. But, then, everything else on the Strip is. $15 for a tiny plate of chow mein and two tiny entrees + bottled water.",UNK
9823,I can't decide whether this place is more overrated or Steak 9 at The Palms.  I'd rather go to Outback.,UNK
9824,expected more ...,UNK
9825,Long wait. Over priced. Under served. So many better places to go.,UNK
9826,"It's cheap and gets the job done. Honestly if you want better pasta make it yourself, it really might be better.",UNK
9827,I came.  I tried to use the Automated Postage Center.  It failed.  The line was 20 deep.  I left.  I'll head back to Rose Garden next time.,UNK
9828,"My family was very sad to see the shape the animals were in.  If I could post pictures here I would,  spent $22 and got 5 upset animal lovers.  I hope Christmas time will be better.",UNK
9829,food is ok. but if your getting take out be prepared to be waiting by entrance until it's ready 10 min usually. for some reason they don't allow you to sit and wait inside if your getting take out.,UNK
9830,"Very pricey for what you get, but it's tasty. Service is slow, partly due to the fact that the customers in front of you are drunk.",UNK
9831,Another dive.\n\nI don't remember anything standing out about this place.  Just a dive.\nHad a draft and moved on.,UNK
9832,"It's a dive bar. Went here with friends to watch the packers game and the tv in the other room was lagging, so the cheers or boos happened at different times, which was weird. They had great service!",UNK
9833,"ok mexican food, but the best chili relleno w/ cheese!",UNK
9834,I normally love Dairy Queen but these last 2 time that I've gone there's been long hairs in are bananas split including today I'm not sure If we want to come back.,UNK
9835,"The portobello mushroom chicken was surprisingly good, sweet potato was delicious. The service however was terrible. Good thing we enjoyed our food, not once did the server ask how the food was, in fact we didn't see her once after giving our order. Do not come here expecting above average service.",UNK
9836,Linda would groom both my dogs. I enjoyed her service but unfortunately left that place because she no longer works there and the two lady's that took over are horrible groomers and the prices went up.,UNK
9837,"My boyfriend and I went here for his sister's birthday. The place is just okay in my opinion, but he was not a fan and said the bathrooms were gross. Overall, not impressed and we probably won't be going back.",UNK
9838,"We visited the location on Alma School, pizza was OK, The Tempe location is definitely better in both food and service.",UNK
9839,"Portion sizes are extremely small, which is weird for an indo-pak restaurant. Food is alright. The owners were nice so they get 2 stars for that. Probably won't be coming back here.",UNK
9840,Not great. I probably won't go back.,UNK
9841,"Yep, they have wings... Their flavors are bland, the meat was dry, the fries were OK. I probably won't go back because there are so many other wing places that are better.",UNK
9842,"Too much of ingredients. Either it is tooooo sweet or toooo sour. Compare to LA veggie restaurant, this is far more expensive and food are too much of ingredient.",UNK
9843,The service part person was rude and had a bad attitude.  We will go to the Internet for parts next time rather than making the drive. The two stars was for the nice selection of things in the store.,UNK
9844,"Mediocre food.  Absurd wait times.  Cilantro in every pore of the meal.  REALLY REALLY LOUD.\nCabo, I'm just not that into you.",UNK
9845,"The food was not good. The ribs were dry and the meat did not fall off the bone. I was not impressed at all. The servers were friendly, it didn't make up for the food.",UNK
9846,"We headed here on Saturday night.  I like the concept and the food sounded tasty.  I was also excited based on the reviews.  Unfortunately, the food for our large group trickled out  slowly, and it was only mediocre.  The server was kind, but overall not a good experience.",UNK
9847,"A friend recommended this to me, and I can't figure out why.  The food was underwhelming and pricey.  The service was fine, and the place looked nice, but I can barely remember what I ate there it was so forgettable.",UNK
9848,Pretty pricey and the food is just o.k. I have eaten there a few times and every time I came away thinking it wasn't worth the money. There are way better options in Pittsburgh,UNK
9849,Pappadeaux is overpriced and overrated.  There are so few choices in seafood restaurants in the Phoenix area.  It's a shame.  Franchise.  The food is ok.  One step up from Red Lobster.,UNK
9850,Very poor.  Bavarian cream tasted like old oil. Cinnamon roll was ok.  3.25 for two items is way too high.,UNK
9851,rotten strawberries on sale is not much of a sale =(,UNK
9852,"Just ok bbq. The place is nothing special, portions are weak. If you're in the neighborhood, do yourself a favor and go to pork on a fork.",UNK
9853,Wings were OK. Liked the Yella Pilsner draft special. Decent dive bar. Real good ranch!,UNK
9854,The dessert bar was amazing and our waiter was great.  The rest of the buffet was below the quality of the Golden Coral.  We had a coupon and at $20 wasn't a bad deal overall.  They had crab legs but they were cold and not steamed.,UNK
9855,"Had the godfather. Crisp bread but salami is inexpensive type. Hubby had firemen. Bread and bacon crisp, hamburger patty premade/prebought. Would have been better with fresh patty. Curly fries are good. Great and fast service.",UNK
9856,"Service very slow and inconsistent. Not a big variety of food. Tacos and brisket were just all fat, little meat. \nFlavored good but low quality prep on meat. \nBoo.",UNK
9857,"Drinks was good, entertainment was fun but wings were undercooked and chewy:(",UNK
9858,Food is bland and overpriced. \n\nAMAZING view but doesn't redeem the boring food.,UNK
9859,"This review is for the crepes. I tried both the dessert and savory crepes during my visit in vegas. While both were decent, it was definitely not worth the $12. If you are coming here I suggest getting the gelato",UNK
9860,This store is down the street from my house so it's somewhat convenient but I can never find any workers! It drives me crazy. I never come here on the weekends or around holidays anymore it's too crazy!,UNK
9861,"Not great...lobster bisque tasted fishy, dirty martini was way too salty. Better than other airport options, but don't count on a great meal.",UNK
9862,"the gado gado sauce was great but the chicken was overly fried. the sauce in the mixed veggies was just way too thick, way too salty and probably loaded with msg.",UNK
9863,Great food but service is awful. Wasn't even crowded and waited 20 min before someone even acknowledged our presence at our table and that's after we had to ask for a server.,UNK
9864,"Rudest hostesses...ever. Waitress was great, but the food was pretty standard diner fare. We tried one of the pot o' bread, two different benedict dishes and the kiddos split the french toast. Overall disappointing and not at all worth the wait.",UNK
9865,"Came here again Thursday night. Service was poor, again. Hope they fix these problems soon!",UNK
9866,Lots of people ordering the two slice with salad and drink for $3.50.  I opted for a sandwich.  I tried the philly.  I am not a fan.  Meat was chewy and bread wasn't anything exciting.,UNK
9867,"It's Chili's which means it tips out at three stars, but in this ones case it is small with slow service. Better to wait in line at Burgatory...",UNK
9868,Nothing special. Precooked meals that taste microwaved.,UNK
9869,Rooms were nice folks were friendly but for all of the stuff they DONT offer i could have stayed at the MGM -_-,UNK
9870,"Went to Fez as part of the lightrail pub crawl.\n\nDoubtful I'll go back.\n\nDecent place I suppose, but not really my style.",UNK
9871,Heard a lot of people raving about this place so I had to try it.,UNK
9872,Went last weekend with 10 friends that came from overseas and they were not allow to drink alcohol because they only have a passport and not American ID!,UNK
9873,Extremely over rated. Avg buffet and way over priced. Waited in line for over 1 hour. Not worth the wait or the price.,UNK
9874,Went with my boyfriend for a few after dinner drinks and was a bit disappointed. The place was packed but the 2 bartenders were more concerned about talking to their friend or the regulars. The service was extremely slow.,UNK
9875,"Rooms small (apart from one or two fantastic suites). All a bit tired now.\nFull of american coach parties.\nOh.. and they play \""highland music\"" over breakfast.  I think that says everything that needs to be said.",UNK
9876,"Over priced, burger was good, not great. Average. Soda selection was poor, probably never go back",UNK
9877,"Nice looking place, clean other then that a bit pricey for the food quality. Chips were cold and the salsas were watery and flavorless. Customer service can improve. It has potential, restaurant look but fast food service. Dissapointed.",UNK
9878,Love the selection. Been shopping here for years. The employees however are always rude and shouldn't even work in the public. Normally I grab what I need and get out of there fast as possible.,UNK
9879,This location I will only go to if I have to its close to my house but tonight was my first time at this location the girl working had no idea how to do anything everything was filthy I like the location on Charleston and rampart way better,UNK
9880,Do you have any idea how frustrating it is to cut a $50 ribeye with a dull steak knife?  My only memory of this place is having to saw my steak.,UNK
9881,I read the reviews. Heard good things. Was excited to try it. It was just ok. Wouldn't return. Pretty limited menu. Disappointing selections. Split the chopped salad and Reuben. Meat was very fatty and huge chunks. Hard to eat.,UNK
9882,Just followed a friend in here while walking down the strip.  We only had one drink and played a slot for a little bit.  Weak drinks and not really my scene.  I'll probably keep walking next time instead of following my friend.,UNK
9883,"Cheap and decent, but your towers are too far away from each other.",UNK
9884,"Dry meat, mediocre sweet tea, 75 cents a slice for bread, run of the mill sauce, vinegar sauce that is just vinegar.\n\ni think i've had better bbq sandwiches at KFC",UNK
9885,"We had two pictures framed and the quality of the final product is really bad. In both, one of the corners has indentations (no idea what caused it) and in one the frame is not assembled flush. We had a 30% discount and that was probably due to the low quality.",UNK
9886,Not that big a fan. Chicken and waffles loaded with grease and syrup.made me sick,UNK
9887,The hotel itself is nice but the rooms were so loud! Paper thin walls and loud maintenance crew really detracted from the quality of the stay.,UNK
9888,It's good for breakfast though the rest of the menu stinks. And it's quite pricey. I would not recommend this place for food.,UNK
9889,"Go elsewhere- the quality, service, price, and variety are nothing special (with exception to the Middle Eastern Food).  The buffet at the Rio is much better!!!",UNK
9890,"Food was Ok... Service not very good , No napkin, fork, or offered Ketchup for fries..",UNK
9891,Been here a month ago and decided to try a few things. Ramen was ok at best. Gyoza was forgettable. And there teriyaki steak was some of the worst I had in a long time.  Overall cool concept but they really need to revamp their food to survive.,UNK
9892,"A huge selection, if and only if you're right handed.  If you're a lefty like me, you're completely out of luck.",UNK
9893,"Dirty rooms, old dirty hotel.  Pool was ok.  Shitty elevators, just a cheap all around hotel.  The low price per night and great location give it 2 stars instead of zero.",UNK
9894,"I think we need to go back and try the desserts on display. I was craving a chocolate chip cookie, and they had them wrapped in plastic. It was okay, but nothing special. Not really worth the $2.",UNK
9895,"Was really good but lost it goodness. Still friendly but breakfast went downhill. Potatoes really greasy, fruits dry, servers getting order wrong...what happened! Used to be great,",UNK
9896,worst drive thru design ever,UNK
9897,"I am from LA and I was Visiting a business client. they suggested this place stating that it had good Italian food. the place is worse than olive garden. The food is below average and tastes nothing like Italian. Definitely not \""Home maid\""",UNK
9898,Service wasnt friendly. \nFood not that great. \nThey dont have carne asada.\nNo street tacos. \n\nThey are catering to the more American palate.,UNK
9899,"This place wasn't terrible, but the line looked short, but looks are deceiving.so many open tables but they never sat anyone.  Very bad if you are hungry.  Long wait after waiting in le village line.  Had eggs Benedict, ok, the potatoes had a unexpected cajun seasoning.",UNK
9900,"Service wasn't great. Food was ok, but not worth coming back. They did have a variety which was nice, but again my first and last time, bonito michoacan is much better.",UNK
9901,"Big area, okay music, crowd was okay.. bouncers were blah! you got to show girls love, if you want your business to run smoothly.",UNK
9902,"Eh, I was hungry, nothing else was open at 3am.",UNK
9903,Way too salty! It was too salty to point that you could barely eat it. The meat slice was good though but the overly salty soup base defeated everything. \nI might go back just to give it another shot. Maybe...,UNK
9904,"It was alright. But for the prices they have, I had expected something a little better. \nTomato cream soup was good! The steak is so-so. \nOverall impression: not too bad but could be better.",UNK
9905,Terrible service!  Menu was okay but my tenderloin came out undercooked.  Won't be returning.,UNK
9906,"Meh. Not too impressed. Ordered the asiago chicken pasty and garlic oven fries - they were nothing to write home about. This place is also not very kid friendly, in my opinion. Probably won't go back.",UNK
9907,"eh...not terrible, but not worth spending money on either. I tried 3 different snacks and a pistachio cake. The cake wasn't good at all.\n\nvery friendly service.",UNK
9908,"Go for breakfast, they have very good pancakes and omlet. Never very go their for lunch.",UNK
9909,"Had a chicken sandwich with 'supposedly' large fries last week. Bland sandwich tasteless, fries were said to be large but they were so less that I cud count them on my fingers! I don't think I wil ever visit them again.",UNK
9910,"Horrible salsa and awful, stale chips. Mediocre fish tacos and they don't have black beans! Seriously?",UNK
9911,"Takes \""sprawl\"" to a whole new level.  By the time we walked all the way to our \""in terminal\"" rental car, I had lost 5 pounds.",UNK
9912,Terrible.  shrimp small and not peeled or de headed. I came to eat not to catch and clean.   Drinks are small and way over priced.   Food did come out fast and restaurant looks nice,UNK
9913,"Not worth the extra bucks. Seafood was good, fresh snow crabs & oysters. But asian food section sucked big time.",UNK
9914,"Great food, horrible service.  For the 3rd time in 5 visits my pick up order was 10 minutes late.  No apologies no drink no discount t",UNK
9915,"Sushi is decent but very spendy. I don't care for the loud music or bad lighting. We've been there approx. 4 different times, staff not so friendly. Of all the places to choose from in the E. Valley now, this would not be our first choice.",UNK
9916,This place is just okay.  Food isn't that great.  It's kind of dark & dingy.  Lots of TV's though.  I prefer Cain's Saloon...just right down the road.,UNK
9917,"Subway. It is what it is. My sandwich artist prepared my sandwiches as requested, didn't hassle me when I didn't want the combo and gave me my change accurately.",UNK
9918,Way over priced. Bartender is cute in the face but clearly miserable. Beer tap selection is far & wide though!,UNK
9919,Really good tacos.\nGeneric beer selection.\nHad a slow/rude/lazy Bartender.,UNK
9920,I love the prices here but the employees need customer service training.. especially the ladies wording at the jewelry department.  Rude! No hellos or Thank You after i purchased a necklace.,UNK
9921,Smh city out here.   They literally cheapened the whole menu at carnegie... this is not the pastrami sandwich I remember.  Its dry now.,UNK
9922,"Poor service by the wait staff is my biggest complaint. We were there at 5:00 (and it wasn't busy yet), and it took probably 15 minutes to place our order. \n\nFinally, $16.95 for a fish fry. Yowzers!",UNK
9923,No breakfast out of nowhere. Closest Wendys for breakfast is 59th and Thunderbird,UNK
9924,The staff is composed of 80 year old ladies that are beyond annoying. Place is nice though \nService: 1/5\nPlace:5/5,UNK
9925,"So, I was really enjoying my spicy cashew chicken take out until I found a black hair, about 4 or 5 inches in my food. Gross. Hair net. Paid for food I'm not going to eat. Bummer.",UNK
9926,"I can only speak of the location at the M casino.\n\nPortions are too big, prices too high and the food is not great.\n\nStay away from the meatloaf... horrible.",UNK
9927,"Food was great, though the servings were small and price expensive for what it was.  I guess that can be expected from a place like this.  What drew the negative review was the really rude server we got.  I dont think i'll come back just because of him.",UNK
9928,"C-P Que???\n\nI thought this place was supposed to be fantastic. I had a personal steak, pesto and onion pizza that was just average. $13 a pizza is not average though. \n\nNot that good, and too expensive.",UNK
9929,"Service wasn't good, wasn't bad.  \n\nThe chefs are really nice and helpful.  \n\nNot the best sushi in town and their portions are really small for the price.",UNK
9930,"Seriously underwhelmed.  Great location on the strip but goes downhill fast.  Bad margaritas.  Very bland food.  Overpriced because of the location.  With all the Vegas food options, avoid this place.",UNK
9931,"Very nice lady. Bad haircut, I shaved it off and went bald after I went home. Hot towel and shampoo was pretty good though",UNK
9932,"Nice atmosphere and good service but the food is not so great.  Had wings, fries and ribs, all not good.",UNK
9933,"Yucky tasting food. You must be quite \""mellow\"" to enjoy their food...if you know what I mean.",UNK
9934,"Very disappointing.  Love the original location but service and qaulity of food were below par at this location.  Not onlt did they not put in my husnabds order, but the food that did come out was luke warm in some places and HOT in others.  Overall not impressed.",UNK
9935,"The burgers are always dry and flavorless. The employees are nice here, but the food just isn't worth the price.",UNK
9936,Service was not bad. Food was pretty bad. The fennel mint soup was really good. It was extremely busy so maybe that played into it.  Wouldn't return,UNK
9937,"Its OK, nothing special better than some other mom and pop places to eat. I would like to see more variety of food. I think Panda Express is a better quality, however if you want quick, nearby 51st Ave location, then I would prefer this based soley on location.",UNK
9938,"It tempted us with unconventional, sunny Mexican style architecture, but amount of time we had to spend inside to get regular coffee added up to about 20 min. And we were almost only ones there! Worst sbux ever.",UNK
9939,In dire need of renovation!,UNK
9940,"I wasn't overly impressed with DSW this time. Not sure if they just didn't have a good selection at this time or if it was just the location. Also, I was in the store for about 30 minutes and nobody asked if I needed any help.",UNK
9941,"Meh. Waiters are hot, service is slow, food is rather bland. Atmosphere is great but that's only ever an added bonus.",UNK
9942,The food wasn't very good and neither was the service. Also the Groupon gave us a limit of $17.95 per entree and the most expensive thing was only $9. We won't be going back.,UNK
9943,"Decent food but a little over priced. They do have an OK lunch menu. My first trip there took over 2 hours for a business lunch. There are 3 Thai places I go on a regular basis, this is not one of them",UNK
9944,"I've been here twice and I just don't think it's any good. For the money there are much better sandwich shops. The customer service was fine, the store was clean and nicely decorated but the food was just average to a little below average.",UNK
9945,It was an ok joint. Servers was polite and professional. The burger was alright. I love the truffle fries and spicy edamame.,UNK
9946,The place smells weird and the pizza was burnt.  Salad was swimming in dressing and the girls behind the counter are snacking on the gelato while we look at the menu.,UNK
9947,Very cute locale and pleasant waitresses.   Food was mediocre.,UNK
9948,"Being in Charlotte on business for two weeks, I gave Mimi's a try three times.  After three times I decided not to go back.  The food is just ok.  Don't go expecting a WOW experience.  Food presentation is not bad, but taste and price could be much better...",UNK
9949,Sorry 2 stars i dont know the area and im into kayak fishing anyone knows of thats allowed in the park or anyother place that i can use my kayaks???thanksvin advance,UNK
9950,"Grabbed a bite on our way to the park. Got a mushroom and spinach pizza and chicken tenders covered in hot sauce.\n\nThe hot sauce was good, but the pizza was just ok...",UNK
9951,Not thrilled. Use to like this place but service has gone downhill. Salsa isn't the same freshness and nothing special with the food. Seemed bland.,UNK
9952,Worst service that I've had in a long time. Food was average at best and way over priced.,UNK
9953,Outdated!  I felt like I was in the 70s!!! Get some new machines that we can figure out.,UNK
9954,I enjoyed the Mickey D's just outside the hotel over the buffet.  It's just THAT bad.,UNK
9955,It's like they're not even trying anymore. The ticket guys have attitude and the finish guys leave my car unfinished and sloppy.,UNK
9956,It's fine. I think Ghengis Grill has a better variety and better flavors.,UNK
9957,"This is an okay place if you want to grab a quick bite but not anything more than that.  I was very disappointed by their holiday turkey sandwich.  I was thinking it would be like Capriotti's \""The Bobby\"" but that's what I get for thinking!  :)",UNK
9958,I give it a Meh. The food is predictable and the ambience includes loud kitchen noises and people yelling keno numbers. Good fresh squeezed orange juice.,UNK
9959,Food was ok.Tried the frozen hot chocolate wasn't very impressed. Everything is overpriced and over rated,UNK
9960,"I've had better sushi from New York City delis. Even supermarkets. The rice was smushy, with no texture. Jiro would be sorely disappointed. A little under mediocre.",UNK
9961,The 2 stars is for the view. You can see the Bellagio waterfall. The food was ridiculous. Overpriced panda express. Ordered the General Taos chicken and it tasted like they put heinz ketchup in there.,UNK
9962,The cap was delish. the barista who made my drink was a rude bitch. If I was an asshole I'd taker dollar back.,UNK
9963,"We caught quite a few fish, but the guide was pretty rude and full of himself.   Acted like it was a privilege for us to be fishing with him.\nWon't be going back.   Don't need an attitude on what should be a relaxing fish trip.",UNK
9964,"Crowded, did not have enough seating or parking. Qdoba down the street has way more menu options and much nicer staff. Over all not impressed with Chipotle.",UNK
9965,Music way too loud. Cannot have conversation without almost yelling,UNK
9966,"The food was great, but the service was bad. There were maybe 5 couples in front of us & it took over 30 minutes to get our food.",UNK
9967,"i oredered take out the other night, and they forgot to include the ranch and celery. Thanksfully i had some at home, but it's not the point. Over the years, BWW has gone downhill, and this location is no exception.",UNK
9968,"Really gotta take the Westin name off this place.  It feels like a Days Inn.  At least upgrade the TV's to flatscreens.  It's 2011, a 32\"" lcd is like $400.",UNK
9969,Ordered pollo fundido.. it was unedible.  Cut into the burrito and water drained out leaving the burro in a puddle.  Chicken appeared canned.  Hot sauce is good.  Posting a pic to show how the chicken looks.,UNK
9970,"maybe the pastries are good but the service is shit, the coffee sucks and the service is shit. and its in the middle of nowhere.",UNK
9971,I still hate this place but am cursed as my husband loves it..I tried to hide the fact they opened one in Matthews but can't ooooh noooooooo I,UNK
9972,The food has really gone downhill.  I used to go here all the time when I lived on that side of town but the last few times I've gone the sushi was horrible.  Maybe it was an off day? I might venture back to see if this was the case.,UNK
9973,"The store is always stinky. It smells like death and cinnamon. They are coupon friendly, so if you're used to being around dead people who loved to chew Big Red gum, please do shop here.",UNK
9974,I've been here twice now and I'm not impressed. The food isn't bad but there is nothing special about it either. I definitely won't be back unless someone makes me.,UNK
9975,Update: Got some food to go for my wife and myself on Sunday. And it was horrible! My wife got a french dip and it was just fat and the rest of the meat was tough and disgusting. Very unhappy with my experience. So i will not eat there again.,UNK
9976,"Horrible mismatch decor, food was so-so, salty stale chips, flavorless salsa, doughy chile relleno. Blech.",UNK
9977,"Although the environment outside under a beautiful tree was ideal.... The food selection and portions were very small. Presentation, taste and service was very disappointing.  I would not suggest it!!!!",UNK
9978,Great selection on beers!!! Too bad I can't say the same for the service or the food.,UNK
9979,"My father ordered a salad. First the lettuce was wilted, then there was no chicken. When the chicken finally arrived it was spoiled and smelt terrible. They were very mindful of the whole situation and took the salad off our bill. Just don't order a salad.",UNK
9980,"Average food,  Overpriced.\nTheir pizza is more like a flat bread",UNK
9981,"Walk through review: Really small casino, really trashy feeling and a lot of smoke. The best thing about this place, Gordon Ramsay's BurGr.",UNK
9982,"The steak was burnt on the edges, the salad lacked freshness and the baked potatoe was a little salty. The service wasn't too bad.",UNK
9983,I went here this am and its was ridiculously overpriced because it's 4th of july weekend! ($40) Expect a regular buffet nothing special.,UNK
9984,"Not a bad spot, but it tries to be too \""California\"" chic. Food isnt bad, but overpriced.",UNK
9985,Went with a Groupon for the Buffet. At least half the dishes were too salty to eat. I mentioned this to the Owner(?) and she said that everyone's taste is different. The mango lassi was too sweet too.,UNK
9986,So the drive thru avg during rush hour but what pissed me off I get my dollar large tea dude it was all ice. Come on you guys make too much to cheep me out of 4oz of tea thanks for the ice.,UNK
9987,"Old, smells, and not enough signs. Not a fan.",UNK
9988,Not a fan. Service was slow and mistakes made with order. The food was not great considering all the hype I had read about it. I did like the decor but not enough to return for ho hum food and bad service.,UNK
9989,This restaurant is no longer a Buffet.,UNK
9990,"Nothing I had here stood out. Mediocre, or worse.\nWe had some apps, and the Ramen, in particular, was bad.\nWill not be going back.",UNK
9991,"Understaffed. Checkout lines almost always long, staff rarely available to help. Not super clean. Will see if that improves at the new location...",UNK
9992,I would normally give this restaurant 4-stars but the service that me and my friend reviewed was not the greatest. She was just chit chatting for about 10 minutes with a coworker while we were waiting for our checks. The wings were very good though.,UNK
9993,Boyfriend and I wasn't impressed \nPho was decent \nBut the bun bo hue was very bland. I also had ask for a hot tea Togo and the guy said they don't do Togo hot teas? How interesting,UNK
9994,"Unfortunately, when I came by to drop off some shoes to get new heels, the store was empty with a sign that said the space was for lease. Michael's is no more - at least in this location. I had a good experience with them before, it's too bad.",UNK
9995,"I went there once, nothing special. I think Soup and Noodles across the street really kills their business.",UNK
9996,"Good not great about sums this place up.\nNo ambiance, no alcohol and OK food at pretty high prices.\nThai place by the Lakes is still best around in my opinion. \nHad the Duck and the Catfish choo chee curry",UNK
9997,Great China Super Buffet was an adventure.  There were some inedible items on that buffet.  I didn't spit out my food like my dinner guest.  I will not be back sad to say because I like a good buffet.,UNK
9998,"I don't understand why this place is so popular.  I've been there 4 times and each time the food was pretty gross.  Most recently, I ordered a Del Monico sandwich and the thing was dripping with oil.  The beer list is decent.",UNK
9999,"In a town with a surprising amount of Asian food, it's best to avoid Noodle's take on Thai and Japanese cuisine.  Stick to the simple things like the Mac & Cheese and you'll be much better off.",UNK
