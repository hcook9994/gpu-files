0,Awesome awesome service Mindi greeted us and took our order and of course she got me with the Garlic fries which were amazing! Super sweet girl. Ryan was amazing as well He was very attentive and called us by name before our order was even up! Good service you guys!!!!,UNK
1,potential to shine. went for lunch beer was cold. wings were good. pizza could have baked longer cuz center was too thin to pull and just floppy. got stomboli to go and it was good. the nite life is what i think this will most designed for with nice open air bar to patio.,UNK
2,trop cher pour ce que c'est...10 dollars le verre de ros\u00e9 de provence..service tr\u00e9s long alors qu'il n'y a que quelques clients,UNK
3,I love this Pizza place!!!!!I had the white pizza and it is amazing!!!The only set back is its kinda pricey compared to other pizza joints but it is worth it for the quality of the pizza!!!,UNK
4,I finally decided to try this place after many times of just passing by and dismissing it. I was not disappointed and as I walked in the staff was very friendly. I ordered the pigs in a blanket and it was very good. I liked the pancakes a lot better than any other breakfast place.  I look forward to trying it again.,UNK
5,"Karen Wong is crazy, but her food right on the money! I was there for a stag night in a back function room and the staff were friendly and the service very quick. Pretty basic inside decor wise but at least prices reflect this.",UNK
6,"I never expected these kind of breakfast to be any more special than other breakfast shop, but their food is just extraordinarily tasty. I like their egg work newspaper. Very creative and cute, Remember to order their omelet, super awesome!",UNK
7,Yuk! Clean your store! Clean your bathroom you filthy pigs. I'm from California as I'm sure a lot of people in Vegas are. This type of filth would not be acceptable in a Orange County store.,UNK
8,This place is definitely great. Any entree I have had has been excellent.. The service is great too. Bartender is very friendly and the atmosphere is very nice ! I'm going to be a regular for sure!,UNK
9,"Service and food are excellent! No fluff, just straight up, great quality. Every plate that was being served looked and smelled great. \nI will most definitely be returning to sample the rest of the menu!",UNK
10,"Honestly not worth the price. The fpod we purchased was worse then a microwaved meal, also the seating is just like an office chair, no matter where you sit. Not worth the ticket price. Also, every single one of the employees were extremely rude and no one seemed happy to be there. Overall, i will never go back there.",UNK
11,PLEASE AVOID THIS PLACE.\nstupid dude cant count. stupid manager can't accomodate. \nI swear this place is owned and operated by retardes with scalding cases of derpes.,UNK
12,"love this place! excellent staff. very informative as far as the whole menu goes. absolutely amazing drink menu! great inventive appetizers! and two out of the 3 times i've been there, they had a wonderful guitar / singer playing during happy hour in the bar!",UNK
13,"Some of the dishes are ok, some are below average. Service is just ok. The kitchen looks very unsanitary and the dining room floor was dirty. I will no be going back. There are much better options for Indian food in the area.",UNK
14,"The staff had worked with my friends to get their money returned to them and we were told that thief of a waiter was terminated.\n\nI would possibly come back here when in Vegas again, but otherwise I think I can find similar dishes at Wolfgang's other restaurants in LA.",UNK
15,"Worst store ever!  I understand how it to be poor but being poor doesn't mean you don't need to have respect.  People pushing, kids screaming & workers lined up washing your car down.  It is dirty and the workers are rude.",UNK
16,"Been here many times and since they opened service is going downhill.. Kids yelling and screaming, service very slow.. Not sure I'll be back!",UNK
17,"I have been a customer since the Meat House opened and there is a reason why.  First, the meat is great quality; second, the service is top notch!  When you need something cut or trimmed, they are always willing to oblige; third, they have a great wine and beer selection!!",UNK
18,"The room I had was nice especially for the price.  Casino was nice as well.  Couple of things that were not great was the distance from the garage to reception and wifi is not free.  If you are a motorcycle rider,  lock up your bags and empty your bike completely.  Bags got broken into, thankfully nothing was in them.",UNK
19,"Great steak with very reasonable prices. I had the filet with prawns and 2 sides for $26 what a great value.  Comes with homemade breads and pesto garlic dip, and bacon corn bread.  The only downside is very small restaurant and you can hear the casino slots ringing during your whole meal.  Will be back soon.",UNK
20,"yum!! $1.00 kids scoop on tuesdays at night from 5:30 to close yay. $1.50 for a normal scoops, they also keep updating their flavors! yum! lots of parking and open till 10pm :)",UNK
21,"Vegas + Buffet = Lots of food. Good solid buffet at Bellagio. We happened to have some credits and gave it a shot. Good, nothing special, nothing overly below average either.",UNK
22,"Yes, yes, yes\nI am so happy I was recommended this place\nIt is a lot cheaper and I can always find good deals",UNK
23,Very cute store. Good selection for baby and a great staff. Talk to Sarah if you have questions about cribs! She was very knowledgeable.,UNK
24,Very disappointing!!\nLuckily we had a groupon.\nIt took over an hour between our salad and getting our steaks. Our waiter was like Casper. We would have had a bigger tab if we would have seen him more than once.\nFood was pretty good but not really anything special!,UNK
25,Thank you for what you do for this airport. I believe the Charlotte Douglas Airport is one of the finest in the country. All the things you have put in the choice of services the music in the lobby the rocking chairs the works. Thank you so much. Sincerely,UNK
26,"Always a favorite spot, last night the Cantina Laredo Fajita's for four were charged as if for 8 server couldn't fix the bill! Then the meat was reheated cold meat since it was late. It was a critically ill friends birthday - and I didnt not want to make a big deal? Boycott!",UNK
27,"The food served was pretty good. But the service took so long to arrive.\nOne of our orders was just forgotten. Overall , not a very good experience dining here. I won't recommend it to any one.",UNK
28,We shall never return. The worst place I have ever been for glasses. I hate being lied to and this place just made me mad. I went for contacts. They told me the price was the same all over madison. They lied. They charged double what other places in town do. I won't be back.,UNK
29,"Huge variety of fresh salads, fruits, soups and some other delicacies and all for only 8 bucks. Place is not really welcoming but it's clean and the service is OK. I'm not a fan of buffets but this one is recommendable!",UNK
30,Service isn't too slow but not quick either. Sucks that you can order one drink at a time  for happy hour but then it isn't a PTs pub. Huge and nice though.,UNK
31,"Welcome Hipsters, one and all. What can I say that hasn't already been said? I enjoy this place, it is open, busy, and when in Tempe it is one of the better places to go. Great beers and the food is actually damn good, go earlier if you are not trying to bump into the other patrons.",UNK
32,Misdiagnosed or tried to screw me.  That was over a year ago now.  It's good to get a second opinion.,UNK
33,Go glad to find Randy and this company! My work schedule changes and they are super flexible about coming to take my dog out on the days that my dog will be alone to long. \nI get photo messages from the park with my dog on a walk or playing with others. I recommend to anyone looking for a dog walker in Summerlin.,UNK
34,"This place blows Starbucks out of the water!  Please check it out and support a local business keeping the $ here in the community and hiring your neighbors as employees. Oh, did I mention the coffee and breakfast burritos are great!!??",UNK
35,OUTSTANDING drove for 45 min and will do it many times more great food the mac and cheese along with the baked beens best i've ever had...If getting Brisket get sandwich instead of plate much better.,UNK
36,"Favorite Chinese place in the world!\nPlaces in my top 5 restaurants of all time!\nDelicious food, very friendly staff!\nVery expensive though!",UNK
37,Dined here recently.  I have been here before but it has been years.  The place has been around for a while so I guess they are doing something right.  Food is decent.  No complaints there.  Service was good as well.  There are better options for Italian food but Ciro's is not a bad one.,UNK
38,The chicken salad is made with turkey.  If they lie about that what else are they lying about.  The food is good and fairly priced.  I also like the salad that they have.  If i am in the area and hungry I would probably visit this place again.,UNK
39,From a Chicagoan.....wow. Pretty damn good deep dish pizza.  They did forget my salad dressings for the salads. But fuck it. Didn't really want to waste good stomach real estate on salad anyway. Very very very good.  Will be going back for the Chicago dog and Italian beef sandwiches.,UNK
40,Deena is awesome! Took our kids in today and she gave them both the perfect cut! She was so patient with our 4 yr old. The salon prices are fantastic and her skills are definitely far beyond. Looking forward to our next visit!,UNK
41,"Very sad to discover that their signature bread and fries are now just like every other bar. I'm glad they were able to stay open, but, these were the things that made it unique. Bummer that they couldn't maintain that standard.",UNK
42,"Gotta love the Insurgents!  No matter the play, they put their all into it.  This group deserves to have an audience because they lay their hearts on the boards. There is a lot of talent hanging out in New Orleans Square, no doubt about it.",UNK
43,"Decent selection of various vintage items:  furniture, clothing, odds and ends, etc.  \n\nI take 2 stars off for the nasty salesperson who was rude and temperamental.  She didn't like being bothered.",UNK
44,"Came here for brunch. I thought it was super overpriced at $35. Good selection, but the food was pretty average overall.",UNK
45,My husband and I love this place.  Their pho is great and their chicken salad is spicy but so flavorful.  It is our go to Vietnamese restaurant,UNK
46,"Woohoo a close Jamba Juice! (And one without frequent lines!) Gasp. \n\nThe staff here recognizes me every time I walk in, so I feel welcome here. Other than that, it's just like all the other ones.",UNK
47,Great ambiance and really good live band the Friday night we went!  Food portions were super tiny and expensive for happy hour though so that was a little frustrating. It gets packed so get there early for HH.,UNK
48,"Not a fan.  The food was good, but it only had 9 bites total in my bowl.  I ate 4 rations of bread to fill up and used the sauce from my pasta.  Scottsdale prices, McDonald's dollar menu portions. Walk across the street and go to The Herb Box.",UNK
49,Good service and great food. The food seemed really authentic and was very enjoyable. I stopped in on a Thursday and the atmosphere was great. Would definitely go here again!,UNK
50,"Rude employee. I will not be back. It's bad enough that dunkin does not make their product in house anymore, but to put up with rude people at 5:00 am???  There are plenty of other donut shops to go to.",UNK
51,Another successful service done by Colburn ent. Toilets were fixed. I no longer have to hear them running. Appointment was quick and easy to make. And service was inexpensive.,UNK
52,"Breakfast, lunch and dinner are served here. Each of these meals are healthy, clean, and tasty. The prices are not cheap but definitely worth it.",UNK
53,As a first time patient here I was very pleased with my visit! Very friendly staff and knowledgable. My cleaning and examination went very smoothly and I felt comfortable.,UNK
54,"Make sure you ask at the counter & take the free cvs club card! They have lot of sales, like right now they are doing a buy one, get one free for so many items in the nutrients/ vitamins, etc section.",UNK
55,"Don't bother trying to go to the location at 500 N 56th St, Chandler, AZ 85226. This is not a physical \""store\"". However, you can call the number and someone will answer. They just don't sell to the public.",UNK
56,Stopped in this morning to get breakfast for my team and got a huge serving of bad attitude from the staff.  This is the first and last time I'll set foot in this place. I'll go up the street to Einstein's where I can get food without the 'tude.,UNK
57,Nice part of history...The drink menu is crafted by local bartender Billy Bessinger...try the specials...love the local feel...it's literally a house but dressed up and a great place to hang out.   You must stop by!,UNK
58,"It was thick with cigarette smoke, my order showed up late from the rest of my party, and the eggplant lasagna I ordered was seriously cold in the middle. :/",UNK
59,Corned beef hash was excellent. Pancakes were good. Good service. Sweet soul music playing in the background. Clean bathrooms. Very nice place off the strip to go eat breakfast. Thumbs up!,UNK
60,"Service ex\u00e9crable. J'ai attendu 20 minutes pour avoir un verre d'eau et formul\u00e9 la demande 3 fois. La nourriture est bonne, mais je n'y retournerai pas.",UNK
61,Came here based on the great yelp reviews. They weren't lying. Kevin D did a great job on a mani pedi. Thanks!!,UNK
62,"The best dessert I've ever had. I split the brownie and the brie with two girlfriends and we were shocked at how delicious they were. Every bite of the brownie is like, what is happening to my body- this is so amazing, type of experience.",UNK
63,Had one of my best dinners here at Botero! The atmosphere was perfect for me and my date and the food was amazing... 5 stars!,UNK
64,Burgers are all good. Stay away from fish sandwich. Parmigiana truffle oil fries we shared with 4 people. Expensive for burgers and fries.,UNK
65,"*really dang sub par to average quality of food\n*the shrimp/prawns are decent, also liked the custom omellete\n*spendy but what person can eat more than 40 bucks worth of buffet food (except Joey Chestnut)",UNK
66,Yelp'd for help after sitting down. Food ok. Drinks ok. Chipped glass. No tp in bathrooms at 8 pm? Waitress with untied long hair-ugh.,UNK
67,"I had the special at the servers suggestion.  It was a chicken with stuffing, mashed potatoes, and fresh vegetables.  The veggies were not fresh, the patatoes were undercooked and the chicken dry.",UNK
68,"I tried the meat raviloi's  and cheesy garlic bread. The cheesy garlic bread was crunchy and had a nice taste, but i feel it should have been complimentary. The ravioli sauce had a nice strong taste and the ravioli were cooked to a good texture. I will come back.",UNK
69,Quick delivery! I typically enjoy Beijing's Chinese comfort food but this particular time was kinda off. The food came really hot as if it were cooked at my door! That was great. The fried rice was slightly flavored with styrofoam and the Thai tea was awful. First time it happened but I may not repeat!,UNK
70,"went in for a smoothie, only to be told no bannanas . its like a hamburger joint without cheese. young girl working behind the counter. she lacks communication skills.",UNK
71,"Never had a better experience at a Dentist, I truly felt at home here. From the moment I walked in the door I felt comfortable and at home. The staff is so friendly and incredible I highly recommend them to everyone!!!!",UNK
72,Great place to grab a drink on the strip.  We went there on Friday night and it was Packed.  The crowd is 30+ and older.  The bartender was very friendly and the drinks are great.,UNK
73,Very nice hotel. Staff is attentive and helpful. I dont like paying $75 for a non cabana area but I like how its not to overcrowded like most the pools on the strip. No gambling in hotel is also a plus!,UNK
74,"This place is a Very good, affordable thai food right next to the Palms. When they say something is spicy they are not kidding. Everything we had was very good, intense flavor. Nice change of pace to the flood of higher end places all over Vegas",UNK
75,"Never brought the fries we ordered,  waitress finally showed up after we had finished our burgers to ask how everything was, told her we never received our order, had to ask for them removed from bill. No offer for dessert not even an apology for the mess up",UNK
76,Completely mediocre. I have eaten ALOT of sushi and this was a waste. Especially for the money. Service slow. Sushi not tasting to fresh and mucho $$$. Had 1 roll 2 beers and 5 orders of nigiri for $137... Ouch....,UNK
77,"Went for the champaign brunch.  Not much diversity here and nothing particularly creative.  Roast turkey was moist and tasted good but that was about the only thing that left any impression on me.  As far as Vegas buffets go, I would only recommend this one for lovers of the bland.",UNK
78,"You can almost shop for anything, always good deals, always honor my discounts.  Ill always shop here unless its for cool shirts.",UNK
79,"Fairly busy even on a weekday night.  Good food.  The green curry is quite spicy, but delicious.  I like that you can get brown rice instead of white rice.",UNK
80,"Love gyros!  This place is very good and quick service is a plus.  I've had the gyro salad, pita, hummus, and I was not disappointed!  I will be back for the falafel.  ;)",UNK
81,"I am a longtime shopper at buffalo exchange and I must say, this location is terrible. Staff is unfriendly, selection is awful & they never seem to buy any of the quality clothing that I bring in. I am done shopping here, completely over it.",UNK
82,Had breakfast here one time and it was very primitive. Coffee was really bad.  I took one drink and trashed it.   Have been told they survive on the burgers.  Will have to try one and update but breakfast is a Not Recommend.,UNK
83,My favorite Thai restaurant!!! My family & I have been coming here for over 10 years. The food is always good & served hot & quickly. We always order family style so it's huge portions that we just share. This is one of the only Thai restaurants that gives refills on Thai tea.,UNK
84,"I am liking this place more and more.  The food is really good, drinks are inventive and service is great.  \n\nDefinitely worth a visit!",UNK
85,"Went back in August and the place was pretty cool. Good beer selection, full bar, and old school video games as well as contemporary. Liked how they played a bunch of remixed video game music, too. Place was packed when I went around 2am, though, so the games and seats were all taken.",UNK
86,I also think their poppyseed hamentaschen are to die for. Sometimes I'll make a detour on my walk home just so I can peak in their window to see if they have any day-old hamentaschen left. They're sold @ a discount and they make my freakin' day.,UNK
87,"Back in Chapel Hill there was a Bojangles two miles from my house, I move to Charlotte and its the same story. Its amazing that I am not fat because I have been eating the same Chicken tender dinner with large fries and iced tea for years. Bojangles is without a doubt, wings down the best fast food chicken place around.",UNK
88,"The service is friendly and great, and the food is on the better side of average. Nothing to get excited over, but a perfectly decent meal.",UNK
89,Great staff! They always take time to talk to me and make sure all my questions are answered. I did a lot of research and I feel I chose very wisely. I highly recommend them if you ever need them.  (HOPEFULLY NOT),UNK
90,i can't be more explicit... literally the best tasting coffee beans in the valley. lux is great. village roastery is great... cartel is phenomenal!,UNK
91,"I've been here several times and the service is good and so is that atmosphere. The food is lack luster and is just ok mexican food. Nothing to write home about, we mostly just like to sit on the patio.",UNK
92,"Love love love this place. It is a unique spot in a not so likely area, just one the things That keeps me coming back. Not mention they also offer great food and friendly service.",UNK
93,"I considered lying and stating in my review that the dogs were awful solely to reduce the number of people waiting in line for them, but I realized that would be extremely selfish. I am astounded that the hot dog I ate was as good as it was. Everyone should try one of these dogs.",UNK
94,"Overpriced and over salted pasta. Don't expect any bread unless you want to pay an extra $.6.50, no salad. Anything added to the pasta will cost an extra $4 to $6 on to of the $11 dish . Service good but our first and last trip",UNK
95,"Had dinner here the other night. Husband had the fish and shrimp tacos. I had the cobb salad. Both were just ok. Nothing to write home about. It's very loud and dark in here. Not recommended for kids. The one thing that WAS fabulous, was the margaritas. Very tasty!!",UNK
96,"For fast food, their fish tacos and shrimp tacos combos are tasty. It comes with beans and chips. I love all their salsas too. Rubio's is my favorite Mexican fast food.",UNK
97,If this place had decent service I would rate it 5 stars. The food is amazing but the service so bad that you almost want to leave before finishing dinner!,UNK
98,"Nothing amazing generally about Joe (it's got pretty standard gift-y shop accessories), but it's the only place I've been able to find the plain sort of nose stud I like. 4 years on, when my old one suffered the fate of the sink drain, they still carry them. Hoorah!",UNK
99,Good eggs.\nGood french toast.\nGood chorizo n' egg scramble.\nGood cinnamon roll.\nGood service.\nGood patio shade.\nGood price.\nGood choice.,UNK
100,Not the best place to eat regularly. But if it's late at night and your drunk-- go here. They have a $3 hamburger special that comes with fries! Also a $6.99 steak and eggs special. This is the perfect place to go for the drunk munchies.,UNK
101,"I've seen 8 or more Cirque shows and, while the performers were good and the costumes & scenery were really interesting, the story line was really difficult to follow.  The show seemed shorter with few spotlight performances.  Still fun to see but I would probably recommend other Cirque shows before this one",UNK
102,Cute little neighborhood bar. Not my cup of tea- but seemed to the perfect place for the guy that just wants to watch the game -and not be distracted by any courtship rituals...There was a small percentage of women there- but looked like that is what they were there for too.,UNK
103,"My policy on Hotels of Health is if I'm not treated in one, no five stars. Scottsdale Healthcare's Emergency Room  well-equipped, the staff from Doctors and nurses to Case Managers attentive, professional and informative. \n\nParking? Needs a three story garage.",UNK
104,"kaneya rules. its pretty small, but never more than 2 tables being used in this place. i think it's owned by a husband and wife, husband is the sushi chef. pretty good menu, really good sushi, amazing prices. usually only spend around $30 with 2/3 people.",UNK
105,"Car would not start on a Friday afternoon and I took it in about an hour before close. They found the problem promptly the next day and didn't have the part but fixed it enough to get home- free of charge. These guys are quick, honest, and amazing. Highly recommended.",UNK
106,Very good steakhouse in Vegas. Very classy and all the food was awesome. We had the halibut and the filet and we were very pleased.,UNK
107,"Awesome location, clean and the workers are extra pleasant. Good idea to have dinner if you don't eat meat or do. I came in 10min before closing and they offered me the opportunity to sit in and eat. Talk about great customer service",UNK
108,This place has the best sushi hands down!!\nGet the hawain 5.0 and the primo!! They are life changing,UNK
109,"Run of the mill sushi. If you're staying at Manadalay Bay and want sushi but don't want to leave the hotel, then eat here. but don't expect it to be great. It's just ok.",UNK
110,"I called Carl's about 8:00PM on Thursday evening as my heating unit stopped working. I could smell something had burned out , figuring that it was probably the motor. David the service man called me back in about 5 minuntes and came over in about twenty minutes, replaced the motor  and the price was more than fair.",UNK
111,"Very small place, but very good food. The place was packed the whole time we were there. The atmosphere was really cool. Lots of kids there eating, but the staff had them move so we could sit down. Tacos were really good.",UNK
112,"Not only have I had great experiences with this dental office, but I've referred 3 friends here and they said they great things as well.  The Dentist & his staff are  knowledgeable, friendly and professional.",UNK
113,I love Volcano Tea. There is a place I think is better but volcano has the variety and right price. All of their drinks are good. They use some fresh ingredients and their boba is good. They take cards now.,UNK
114,"Oh man ... this is NOT good pizza ... it's CHEAP and they usually have an all you can eat lunch buffet but the 'za is about as good as Little Caesar's Pizza (i.e. \""not so much\"")",UNK
115,"Great place.  For the first timer, they let you sample everything on the menu, then teach you how to properly order.  Based off of the taste test, I knew what I wanted and thoroughly enjoyed the tasty fusion experience.  Great food, hope to get out there and visit it again sometime.  Jade Red Chicken is very tasty.",UNK
116,"Methinks not. \nI've been to this place two times now. Both times, same experience. \nRude staff, very dark and dim lighting and never a place to sit. The only nice thing I have to say about this place is it has live music.",UNK
117,Ordered the wonton soup..was nasty..the wontons were very starchy and filled with what looked like poop also had some old celery in it..fried rice was ok but felt gross after trying the soup.. Will not be going back.,UNK
118,"Love this west side Madison location! They are always friendly, a little slow but if you order the Chicago Style hot dog, you get an IBC root beer with your order - yum!",UNK
119,"Josh came and unlocked my car in 20 minutes. He was super nice and professional. If your in the downtown area, i would highly recommend!",UNK
120,"I have stopped here a few times for a quick dinner, it absolutely never disappoints, you're greeted by the nicest waiters and hostesses. The food is by far the best Scottsdale has to offer, I highly recommend the chicken if it's your first time visiting!",UNK
121,"D'Lisa is professional, personal and made the experience comfortable.  I am excited that I found aesthetician for my waxing and other services I desire...Her shop is as adorable as she is!",UNK
122,"If you go here for the muffins only,  it's 5 star. The food is never as good as I want it to be.  The cheese in the ham and cheese omelet seemed processed and the ham seemed canned.  The turkey is processed butterball. Stick with the bakery.",UNK
123,"I went there for a basic sushi dinner, and was very disappointed.  The sushi is very low quality and has no flavor at all.  A waste of money.  Cardboard on plate!",UNK
124,"It was fine.  Nothing fancy.  The buffet breakfast was nothing to be excited about, but then again I'm not a breakfast person and I am a waste of a buffet.",UNK
125,"Had the Jewish sliders. These were good, but they fall under the category \""food that makes you feel fat\"". You get a lot of food for your money here, so keep that in mind while ordering. My first time here I ordered waaay too much food.",UNK
126,There are two tram stops here. If you're coming from Mandalay Bay or Luxor the first stop gives you the impression that's the last stop...so that you will walk through the casino....however there is one more tram stop which is at the corner of the strip.,UNK
127,Very good pizza and salad. Looking forward to having a pizza at dinner time to see how the flavor is after a full day of heat in the oven...,UNK
128,Had the signature burger... It literally was like eating a pile of salt. I couldn't even down my first bite. The fries were good and shakes were too. The service was awesome but I'll stick to the ones in the Midwest...,UNK
129,"My friends were trying to use this service and were denied because they are a lesbian couple. In this state it is legal to get married regardless of your sexual preference and this is an outrage. Any company that doesn't value love and equality is not a company worthy of my dollar, and in my opinion shouldn't be worth yours.",UNK
130,Not as good as I though. The sausage is very bad. I thought they used great ingredients - not! I'll stick to my regular pizza guy. Big disappointment.,UNK
131,"The owner is amazing! Very friendly and always checking on the guests! The good is good, my favorite is the oxtail soup! big portions! and oh the chantilly cake is to die for!",UNK
132,"2 because the service was fine. So far worst buffet in Vegas on the strip. \""seafood buffet\"" $20 crappy. The omelet station was the best part",UNK
133,"I love this place! The people there are always so nice and my pizza is always perfect! Me and my bf love the Italian Garlic pizza. I like it without veggies and even ordered it half with and half without and it was perfect! I'm sorry, but this place is just too yummy. I loves it!",UNK
134,"A must-see in Pittsburgh. As a West Coast dude, I don't get to see many places like this. Just fantastic.\n\nTheir shipping operation is also exceptional.",UNK
135,"Rooms are too close to the roller coaster. If you travel for business, do not stay here. The price is good but not worth the loss of sleep. Rooms are meh. I would expect more from an MGM property.",UNK
136,Man... this place is great!  I did the Infusion Burger... Atmosphere is upscale without making you feel like dressing up!,UNK
137,Stopped in before a movie for a bite to eat.\n\nFood was meh and the service was the pits.  I really didn't need to hear the servers talk about bloody cuts and how they were in the hospital while I was eating.  Standing right in front of me!\n\nI'll be going elsewhere,UNK
138,"Perfect \""Charlotte\"" restaurant.    Everything on the menu is good and they have a menu that can please anyone.  Was on our regular date night rotation when we lived there.",UNK
139,The offer of free chips and salsa should not be what brings you here...aren't they usually free anyway?! Carlsbad Tavern should focus their attention on the quality of the food rather than the quantity. Not impressed.,UNK
140,"There pizza is really good have many sorts BUT for paying 26 something a person I wouldn't go back for it.\nThe food over all was eh, nothing was GREAT really the desserts were boring.. Not impressed.",UNK
141,This is my favorite chinese restaurant!  I go about twice and month and if I lived closer I would go more often.  Their mongolian beef is great!  Their lunch special is a great deal if you dine in.,UNK
142,"We had a large table of 8, and it was a very nice experience all around.  Typical Las Vegas steakhouse prices.  Also, in typical fashion, the room was rather loud.  Food, service, and ambience, were all very good.  We will return.",UNK
143,"the cashier is a douchebag here\n\na child costs the same as an adult\n\nplace is hyped, alot of the stuff seemed fancy but was just...false for some reason\n\nnot so great\n\nwynn is better, so much better",UNK
144,"The staff are always friendly, always helpful, and solve problems.  \n\nBe prepared to be patient as this is a very popular store.  Making an appointment first is a good idea if you are visiting for problem solving.\n\nParking at this location is not so convenient, but such is life in the big city.",UNK
145,"Yelp Hours say they are closed on Sundays but they are open. This place is a lot nicer than the original location on Main St in down town Mesa. The food is not as authentic, missing the orignal location.",UNK
146,"Yum.  so good.  Their seafood salad is excellent.  And of course the stone crabs.  Even the steak, scallop and king crab was good.",UNK
147,"I stopped in today since I was craving an Italian soda after my yoga workout.  The staff was super friendly, welcoming and quick to make the drinks.  I am a regular at the Gelato Spot and can't believe I never stopped in Hava Java before.  Great location, great selection and great staff!",UNK
148,"Way too pricey for what you get- EVERYTHING costs extra, you don't even get a towel unless you have the 'platinum' membership. And then you have to pay for parking!  Much better and more reasonably priced facilities not far away.",UNK
149,Drunk? \nNeed pizza?\nDon't mind if you poop your brains out in the morning? \nThen get Howie's. It always tastes so good going in that it's kind of worth it. I think?,UNK
150,"I dont understand why so many complain about this place. To me it was exactly what I expected. Many items you've seen on the show are here on display. I am glad I went and if you are a fan of the show you should absolutely go. I was there at 7:30 at night and walked right in, no line.",UNK
151,"The nachos are good but fyi dont order steak, ALWAYS really fatty for how expensive thy are, really not worth it!",UNK
152,Great food. Had the blueberry pancakes that aren't too sweet.  Also I tried a bite of huevos rancheros and they were quite good. Tip. This place is packed but no waiting if u ask to sit outside.,UNK
153,"The food was average, at best. Portions were large (THREE eggs benedict, really?). Staff was friendly but forgot to bring my side of bacon, not a good thing.",UNK
154,Fabulous! Where has this place been all my life. Everyone is so friendly and seem to really enjoy their jobs. Every drink I have ever had here is awesome. Definitely worth giving up Starbucks over.,UNK
155,"Not good, everyone on here is most likely related to the owners. I would rather heat up a Tostinos frozen pizza than eat at slices.",UNK
156,"We had a chance to go there during the restaurant week. I love the atmosphere. It look so cool with all seat and tables, and the staff are also part of good experience. They are so professional. The food are so delicious and tasty. However they are a bit too salty for me. With the experience, it was good.",UNK
157,"Average and overpriced, waitress didn't get our order correct. There was nothing exceptional about this dining experience, disappointing for location and price!",UNK
158,One Call Services did a great job with my water heater replacement. They came out on time and the plumbing tech was very courteous and knowledgeable. I would recommended to anyone.\nGeorge,UNK
159,I love this place. Just traveled from mt charleston and they were closed at 6:30!!! Hope they're not out of business,UNK
160,"Picked this on a whim.  Service, food, everything was awesome!  We had one breakfast crepe, one savory.  They do sweet too.  On weekends one employee helps manage seating which keeps the whole thing delightfully civilized.",UNK
161,Whoever is a male that works here on Sunday nights should be taken care of for his extreme poor customer service & attitude. Customer service can change your experience no matter how amazing your smoothie or food is. Keep your day job. You don't deserve to spread anymore negative vibes.,UNK
162,This was horrible. The service was really bad. We didn't have our meal. Ie never came because we left...took over two hours to get appetizer. Horrible.never go,UNK
163,I had a Great experience with this U-haul.  Picked up a 26' truck at 9:15 am Sunday and was out the door within 15 minutes.  Both Representatives were smiling and incredibly friendly.  They were busy but both helped customers very quickly.  My truck was clean and ran great.,UNK
164,It was okay... Nothing to get excited about. I love a good burger but this was just lacking in flavor for the price. The tempura onion rings were spot on though!,UNK
165,"It was over priced, the food was poor, and the atmosphere was nothing special.  They have a good amount of beer to choose from, but that doesn't make up for the other short comings.",UNK
166,OMG I cant say enough about the owners and employees of this place. They have gone above and beyond  to accommodate us and our needs. They even rescued my husband when he had a flat. They have stayed open late and never complained. Thank you for being so accommodating to my familys needs.,UNK
167,"Just went with my dad and sister.   Lots of fun and looks great!  Very friendly, helpful, staff!  And of course rocking music!  And best of all I won!",UNK
168,This was the worst subway experience. Amazingly skimpy with veggies.  They added 2 slices of each veggie for a foot long sandwich. Very sad,UNK
169,"Convenient, yes. Not the best deal in town. Seats were not very good and NOT as described when I purchased. Would seek other ticket sellers. And there are a lot.",UNK
170,Very nice looking huge place. Very sluggish food service though. Even though it was far from being packed it took 30 minutes for a salad and appetizer to arrive.,UNK
171,Awesome Red Velvet pancakes! I ordered homemade corned need hash with eggs n seasoned potatoes n added 'upgrade' of red velvet pancakes! Very good! Tiny place but loved the Aloha vibes n grinds! My husbands from Honolulu n is going to freak when he here's about this place!,UNK
172,The only reason why this is getting four stars is because they have a limited menu. But if you are looking for some out of this world fried chicken you should go! Make sure you get a side of pickled radishes and Takoyaki!,UNK
173,"We didn't have a hotel for Sunday as we waited for our flight. This place was a lifesaver and provided a safe haven from the 110 degree weather. Clean, empty and a convenient location on the strip. Winner!",UNK
174,"YUM! Finally good Cuban food in the Burgh. Between 2 people, we split the empanada platter, the congrie, lechon and fried plantains and everything was fresh and tasted just like home made food. Good service also. Definitely will be coming back to try the rest of the food.",UNK
175,"My wife really enjoys all the fancy drinks and things they have at a ridiculous price, and she even orders caffeine free drinks for our kids with some whip-cream  and chocolate.  If you can afford it this place is consistent, and delicious,offering a wide variety of coffees, teas, and combinations of them.",UNK
176,New place.  What a pleasant surprise!  Great chow and very friendly people.  Pasta and hot and cold sandwiches.  Licked my plate.  Try the pastrami with saut\u00e9ed onions on rye.  Guarantee will put a smile on your face.  My new favorite place.,UNK
177,"Awesome cold beers and mixed drinks! Priced right too!  Appetizers were excellent.  Service was wonderful.  Atmosphere and bar design is wonderful.  Loved our visit, and will return on next trip to LV.",UNK
178,"Very nasty, plain and bland food.  Very rude staff. The owner is the worse.   Not a family place at all.   It's all a bar atmosphere.  Loud, awful music and dim lighting.  If you're thinking Fuego, save your money and go to Frys and get some frozen Mexican food.  It will taste better.",UNK
179,"For an all you can eat sushi joint on the strip, this place is alright.  There are better places, but not walking distance from hotels at the convention center.  Prices are great, service is spotty.  But all in all a perfectly acceptable exoerience.",UNK
180,"Cigarette smoke and ashtray smells combined with mediocre coffee and subpar customer service are not my cup of tea, and I never even rank the tea here. Thank the Flying Spaghetti Monster that Biddle's Escape opened and now I have absolutely no reason to go to Katerbean.",UNK
181,Stopped here after a morning of drinking! The food is excellent and authentic Mexican! Not priced bad and the service is excellent!  very cool spot!!!,UNK
182,Great breakfasts and good prices. The entrees are big enough to share (and my husband and I eat a lot). The presentation is like no other! :) Also their bloody mary's are the best I've had off strip!,UNK
183,"The food was really good, though the customer service was severely lacking. I don't really need to be told how I should organize my group, what I should order, and how I should do everything about my meal by a waitress who was snotty and rude.",UNK
184,Was visiting from texas and this place is by far the best southern resturant I've been to. Everything here is great.,UNK
185,I love these people! They are very friendly and always ask about my life. They remember things I tell them then ask about it the next time I'm in. Patrick and lily are the best but everyone there is wonderful in their own ways!,UNK
186,Holy cow!!!! Best chorizo is right! Glad I checked the yelp reviews. I made fabulous breakfast burritos & killer burgers from the chorizo. This is my new jam 4 chorizo & tortillas,UNK
187,Fuck this place!!  Mother fucker said he can do an oil change on my car now if I use their oil but if they were to use my oil it would take a few hours. What kind of bullshit is that,UNK
188,What happened to hot and ready?? Theres a long line for it?? Theres non ready and the cashier is nowhere to be found!! I wouldn't get pizza from this place if it wasn't requested by my friend to get the pizza from here because she thought itll be fast!,UNK
189,I've been told several times they don't deliver to my address that's two blocks away...:yet I see jimmy johns deliver to several other apartments in my complex. Ridiculous.,UNK
190,The food was terrible I order shimp with bacon n cheese n they were hard n didn't have a good taste n to let you know they don't clean the shimp at all you could get sick from this is  so disgusting. I would never go back and the service is terrible.,UNK
191,"Mediocre.  Too much quantity over quality. And whats with the HUGE beverage glasses. Waitress didn't know much about the food. Have to say tho', had a better experience at their location near Las Vegas airport.",UNK
192,"Horrible service, whether busy or not.\nPizza is always limp, soggy or undercooked.\nBaked Tuna Sandwich is bitchin'.\nPizza Cookie is ok.\nGo to Scottsdale or Tempe location instead.",UNK
193,"The best of Scottsdale. Always great service, awesome talented staff, great prices and in a relaxing, clean and nicely decorated salon. Also must recommend Holly...she is a true nail artist.",UNK
194,I signed up because I like the location and facility but the customer service is not there. They try to upsale personal training and everything is an extra charge. The instructors don't even show up on time if at all. This place is still in the works.,UNK
195,Mediocre at best.  Gave it 3 tries. Won't come back. Most of the hot dish platters looked like they had been sitting there for ages.,UNK
196,My husband and I go here often.  Heather is just a sweet heart and takes very good care of us.  The food is GREAT!  Service is outstanding!  Love the patio.  \n\nWe will go back again and again and again... yummy stuff!,UNK
197,If you get lucky to snag on of the 4 or 5 tables out on the balcony overlooking Freemont Street you have scored.  $3.25 for a cocktail.  Great place to rest your weary feet for awhile.,UNK
198,This bar used to be awesome but after experiencing a bartender who was more interested in loudly and inappropriately (even by Vegas standards) relaying a story about his insane party weekend than taking our order we won't be back.,UNK
199,The food was OK and service was alright. I really like the ambiance and the interior decoration. I had the kimchi fried-rice and the portion was huge for a fair price.,UNK
200,"This is a really good pasta restaurant.  We had the pizza and the spaghetti; the spaghetti noodles were nice and firm, and very tasty!  The Pizza dough was thin, soft, and delicious!",UNK
201,"Great service and really yummy sushi. Other than that, similar to Buffet Asia.  \n\nCheck out the strawberry yogurt.",UNK
202,Today it took 90 minutes to get seated. They didn't have enough help.they 1st said it would take 40 minutes. The food is the same as Village Pubs around town with no wait.both have same ownership,UNK
203,Had the steak n lobster special!!!! Can I just say.... There's a reason they don't have salt n pepper on the tables cause the food is DELISH!!!!!!!,UNK
204,"What kind of restaurant closes in Las Vegas at 9:15 PM on a Friday night?  I tried to make reservations at 9:30 PM and they said they were closed.  Truly unreal, there are far better places open until 11 PM or as late as 24 hours to consider!  Wayne Gorsek",UNK
205,"Worst buffet downtown besides Golden Nugget. Everything out of a box and as low quality as you can get. Oysters were stuck to the shell. Very old and smelled. Don't eat them. Better yet, stay away. Go to Main Street Station and the 777 Brew Pub.",UNK
206,"Way over priced drinks n food. Nachos sucked and I would get drunk off 2 margaritas at home but here I'm sober after 2.... But, service was awesome. Our server was super cool and friendly... I am not sure if I would recommend it or not.",UNK
207,"Don't Rent! Rates are only few bucks cheaper than AirPort rental but they are not anywhere close to the air-port, you have to change two shuttles to get to them. staff is not helpfull and cars are not clean. i don't recomment renting from these guys.",UNK
208,"Food was good, just not great in my perspective .  Staff was nice, but they are all seem to be high school kids, so not real polished.   I probably wouldn't eat here again.",UNK
209,"Third stop on our Buffet of Buffets for lunch.   The main dishes were horrible.  It tasted almost stale, as if they were left overs from the dinner the night before.  The only saving grace was the dessert station, the cheesecake was my favoriate.",UNK
210,All of Old Chicago's food is good & their beer selection is great. \n\nI can tell this place is managed really well & the customer service is really good.,UNK
211,Absolutely the longest I've ever waited for a sandwich.  Not worth it. Skip this place. Its seriously like they start planting the grain when you order the bread.,UNK
212,"This Silver Mine was just awful. My sandwich was bread, bread, and more bread and a ton of mayo. Go to the Silver Mine off of Mill Ave in Tempe. Much better, and they won't jip you of your meat.",UNK
213,"Great venue!!! Saw Stevie Wonder there last night. The staff were professional, friendly, and uber generous. You can't always say that about large music venues in California...",UNK
214,"Always a good time when I come by.  I get my usual appetizer, toast and marrow.\n\nBut favorite on this visit, green tea martini.",UNK
215,"Paradise Bakeries going downhill. \nEach of the 4 locations that I have visited in the Phoenix area seem to be lowering their standards recently. Fewer personnel, less attention to customers, out of muffins at 7:10 in the morning, no coffee.  Seems like a regional management thing.",UNK
216,"Horrible service, servers feel that they are irritated when serving me and my friends. Didn't feel too comfortable with the server helping us out. When I asked the server to take a picture, she also felt irritated to do so. However, the food was good just not the service.",UNK
217,"This place is a good choice for Vietnamese. It's a fast, cheap, hole in the wall. Nothing fancy about it. Just good food. I may have had more flavorful broth at other Vietnamese restaurants like Ben Thanh next door and Vietnam Grille on South Blvd.",UNK
218,"I haven't had any work done here that was less than excellent. Fair prices, fast, and super friendly. A local business I am happy to support.",UNK
219,Just another average Italian restaurant for me. The meatballs were alright not spectacular. Everything else was just alright for me. The place is very nice and the decor is quite elegant. Service was better than average.,UNK
220,"Ordered their new Turkey Cranberry panini without bacon, and I got one spinach leaf, a dab of cranberry sauce and a mediocre turkey lunch meat slice for $8... Not worth it. Very disappointed. Good orange juice though.",UNK
221,The staff if very nice. I got a salad to go and was disappointed when I got home. There was spring mix with maybe one tomato 3 slices cucumber halved and one (yes that is correct) one piece of cheese. This salad was $10. It tasted nice but wasn't worth the money.,UNK
222,"We went there for lunch to celebrate my sons 5th birthday and by dinner time we were all sick with food poisoning. I don't know how a cheese pizza can have something so wring with it that we were all sooooo sick, but that worries me.",UNK
223,Drinks was alright. Lots of areas to sit in. Love the atmosphere but hate the DJs. They can't spin crap so I end up leaving the place earlier than I plan to.,UNK
224,I have drank margaritas around the world and never ever have I paid $22.00 a margarita.  Watch this restaurant they will over charge you given half the chance.,UNK
225,"It's ok. I don't really get the Warhol mystique, but the museum is well gone and it was interesting",UNK
226,"Whenever I'm in Madison I have to stop in to pick up some of the coffee here.  Were it socially acceptable, I'd probably grind up the beans and mainline them.  The beans are roasted to such as state of perfection that they're actually fun just to look at.  Great stuff.",UNK
227,The first time I have ever asked my server to get me the recipe for a dish! The Carolina coastal catch is hands down one of the best dishes I've ever had. Great place to celebrate our anniversary!,UNK
228,"Went today for father's it's one of my fave's spot but today my wife went to the restroom to take my daughter, she came back she had lost her appetite the restroom was disgusting.  They had just brought our food had to take to good. \nThey won't get my business no more.",UNK
229,"The atmosphere was nice, the inside, patio and bar area was fun but the prices were very high and the food was mediocre at best... they had a large beer selection but you can almost go anywhere for that.",UNK
230,Sat down and told the waiter we were only here for one shot. Was here for 40 minutes and the shot was half of a real one and in a cup,UNK
231,"The food is average americanized mexican but the service can be improved. Although the waiter was prompt, our order was incorrect and we did not receive any refills. There were only about 4 parties in the restaurant so it wasn't due to being busy.",UNK
232,My friend Leung's uncle own this place and that is not the reason I am biased! It is good food. It is small restaurant but they are fast!,UNK
233,"Great new SAQ. The 4th within walking distance to my house. Hey... if you're going to have a drinking problem, have it in the Plateau;)",UNK
234,I gave this store a bad review a couple weeks ago because of the service. I just looked on to see if they had answered my review and it was not there. It's a shame that they can fool people by only keeping the good ones. People will know how bad this store is when they experience it them self,UNK
235,"spring roll was 85% ice berg lettuce, sucked. Bahn Mi was even worse, big long stalks of cilantro, dry semi hard pork. I made a huge mistake by not going to Lee's Sandwich.",UNK
236,My husband and I ate dinner here tonight.  The sliders were great.....the onion rings were greasy and tasteless.   Service was excellent (but we arrived at the off-time of 4:30).  We would definitely stop here again for a quick bite to eat after work!,UNK
237,"Terrible bar,  they lied to you about how they do things and what goes on. I spoke with the manager and he told me \""fuck you\"". I've never been so insulted in all my life. I think I deserve better than this place.",UNK
238,"Im not here to comment state of the mall, I just think there is a shortfall in decent offerings at this center.\n\nWorth the drive to PV or Arrowhead in my opinion.",UNK
239,"Good luck getting their \""courtesy\"" shuttle to pick you up at night. Called them before I got on the plane - told me I had to call when I was outside of baggage claim. So I did that. Couldn't get a human on the phone for 20 minutes. Ended up taking a cab. Lame.",UNK
240,"Love this place! Fast service, awesome ambience and even better food! An awesome chain! Would eat here every time! Especially next to the olive tree inside",UNK
241,Food...ambiance...service...parking...price...EVERYTHING DOUBLE GREAT.  Loved it and can't wait to go back.,UNK
242,Probably the worst filli b's I have ever gone to. I live near by so I gave it a couple chances. This food taste like dog food and their service is even worse than their food. I like the chain and I will go to a different location but I won't EVER go back to this location!,UNK
243,This dude catered a gig I was jammin at. When I went to pay for a dog he said no way bro you're in the band. That was cool enough but the dog was stellar! My mama is from the burg and we are frequent lovers of this fine establishment!,UNK
244,"I can't speak for going through TSA, because this is always a transfer spot for me, but changing planes, and finding your next gate, is a breeze!! When given the option, I always choose Douglas when planning a flight with a layover.",UNK
245,"Went in for a diagnostic test on a check engine light. Was given an estimated time (15 minutes) until they could get to me, and when they did, the test took only a few minutes. Was told what the problem was as well as how to research further into it online. Friendly staff, prompt service, clean store.",UNK
246,If you don't care about quality Chinese food panda is the place...\nI don't mess with meat there,UNK
247,"I have purchased home d\u00e9cor fabric from Loom's online store several times, and am thrilled with the quality and price of the selections. They ship orders quickly, and their customer service is terrific.",UNK
248,"I've used plenty of car services all over the country and Ridesmart is the best.  Courteous, timely, nice vehicles, at a great price.  Won't use anyone else in the Phoenix area.",UNK
249,"Pricey, so get the restaurant.com certification to make it worth it. The steaks were good, but the star here are the duck fat fries....really good and probably great for hangovers! They went super fast.",UNK
250,Great date spot. We had the bruschetta and cheese with wine. It's a busy place but you're not easily distracted from who you're with. Staff is helpful with suggesting wines and it's $5 for a glass between 11a-5p. Not a bad deal.,UNK
251,"Absolutely beautiful basilica. It's $5 to get in, but it's a stunning structure. They have a light and music show in the evening, which just seems . . . weird.",UNK
252,"Zimbrick Honda is wonderful.  I did not purchase my 2007 Honda Odyssey EX-L from there but I take it there for service.  They are so friendly!  There service area is super clean and inviting.  It truly is the meaning of their \""Loving Care Service\"".",UNK
253,I went in the restaurant and took them a good 20min to get my chips that come with my meal along with that I ordered a large Jamaica and no ice like really to top it off I found hair inside my shrimp the food is good  customer service sucks they need to get it together,UNK
254,The customer service in this store is terrible. A Manager by the name if Justin was rude and sarcastic and needs a belt to hold his pants up. If Oreily thinks guys like Justin are good managers than corporate has a poor judge of character and customer service.,UNK
255,The hotel rooms and hallways are dark and depressing.  Even the elevators are dark and depressing.  The casino is great though. The buffet is awesome.  I think I will stay at the Paris and walk over to gamble and eat at the buffet.,UNK
256,I got no hate for Tim Hortons!  This place offered up fast and what tasted pretty healthy sammies.  Not bad when you're searching for a quick bite to eat.,UNK
257,Thus far I like the environment. It would be a good place to come hang out and chill after having dinner. There is a cover of $5 bucks which makes sense since there is live music. A good thing about this place is that they will give u a table.,UNK
258,I just came back from picking up my two poodles from being groomed. They look great! Alex took the time to discuss their cut and my expectations.  The facility was clean and quiet.  I came here based on the yelp reviews and look forward to taking them back next month.,UNK
259,"Came here for the happy hour....$3 beers all day. Good service, no to crowded, looks the same as the California locations. Relaxing atmosphere, everyone looked like they were enjoying themselves, maybe because they were all buzzed.",UNK
260,"This place made me wish I had a magic carpet and could at the exact moment I escalated in , teleport back to San Francisco. BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO",UNK
261,"The view was spectacular and the whole experience was amazing. I only give it 3 stars because I didn't think the food measured up to the price. however, I think what you're paying for is the experience. I'm glad I went once, but I probably wouldn't go back.",UNK
262,"Great rolled tacos and machaca burrito. But, the smell of pine sol was too strong. Wished there would haven been outdoor seating.",UNK
263,"Great food all around, I usually order the couch potato special which is amazing if having people over (fingers, wings, fries and large pizza). The only negative i have for them is that i feel like crap after eating it most of the time but that is because i eat way too much of it.",UNK
264,"This is the perfect atmosphere  to get in shape. Great studio, friendly instructors and the owners are very welcoming. Wide variety of classes so you won't get bored . I would definitely recommend.",UNK
265,"I had another fantastic meal at Durant's on Tuesday!  For me, Durant's the best steak house in Phoenix maybe in the South West! Excellent food and fantastic service, can't wait to go back!",UNK
266,"As someone who ordered a few times a month I was surprised at the nearly $5.00 delivery charge which does not go to the driver.  So,  ordering for me and my son,  with tip delivery cost me $9.00. For less than a mile!  Boo Jimmy Johns.  You got greedy.",UNK
267,Great margaritas and authentic Mexican Food. Not sure if he is there all the time but they have a guitarists playing Mexican favorites. \nPretty sure he's tired of playing 'La Bamba' FYI.,UNK
268,"I go here sometimes for work lunch, reluctantly.  The food is typical large restaurant American/Mexican - refried beans, rice, and iceberg lettuce and diced tomato \""salad\"" with everything.  Prices and portions are fine but, overall, just not impressed.",UNK
269,This was our first drinking stop on our last Vegas trip. It was a little quiet when we were there around 5pm but its looks like it has great potential. Ass Juice is the house mystery shot and for the over indulgent there is puke insurance.,UNK
270,I had to stop and check out the hype. I am not a fan of coffee shops that serve burnt coffee. DB's coffee is over roasted just like Char-bucks. Their only saving grace was their employees. They had music playing and seemed to be having a great time.,UNK
271,"Not very authentic. Or maybe because I'm not Chinese that I didn't get the real stuff, but it's typical Americanized Chinese takeout. And not very good at that. I ordered the house special with chicken and it didn't come with rice. Tasted like fried chicken in BBQ sauce.",UNK
272,Worst Chipotle in town... Slow service... 4 workers can't handle 10 people in 30 mins... And cashier asked what my order was three times!  Food was OK... there portions are smaller or the people don't know how to make can burrito,UNK
273,Excellent food! We came from Utah on vacation and saw it had been on triple D. And decided to try it! We were not disappointed! Good variety of meat and yummy Mac and cheese! A definite must if your visiting vegas and want to get away from the strip.,UNK
274,Love the setting and the fresh new way eggs and pancakes are presented.  Options galore... You won't be disappointed!,UNK
275,"One of our old standbys... friendly service, great food and not too pricey.  We always seem to get the spring rolls (Gai co cuan?) and beef with noodle bowls (Bun Bo Nuong) and I love the home-made lemonade",UNK
276,"My favorite chinese place in mesa! The service is great. The food presentation is impressing, and most importantly, it tastes amazing! The price is average for chinese. All in all a great place for your next chinese meal!",UNK
277,"I love Dr Gonzales. I've never had a female dentist however she is as good as any I've been to.The dental hygienist, Robert, is just awesomehe keeps my teeth looking good. I highly recommend this dentist office",UNK
278,"At $10 per adult, you can't really go wrong here. We spent probably a little over 2 hrs at the museum and felt it was well worth the price of admission. I enjoy American History, and this was no exception.",UNK
279,"Came here a second time. Had a breakfast burrito, it was great! No one here, so service wasn't going to be a problem. Workers here are a lot nicer than they were before. I still think their prices are more than they should. But overall they are getting better. Be back with another update!!",UNK
280,Ate here after arriving at the Mirage after a long flight.   We were tired but wanted something to eat.   Walked around the Strip for a bit and came back here. Had a hot pastrami sandwich and fries DELICIOUS!  You can also get food to take out.,UNK
281,"Visiting from the US we were glad t o find this place!\nIdeal to relax, nice ambience! staff young and friendly... \nlove the late hours...",UNK
282,Definitely a fan and will be making this a daily occurrence while in town.  Tried the Green Smoothie & Straight to the Heart both are great!,UNK
283,"Over staffed, but there is never anyone to help me look at something I am potentially going to buy. No bargaining whatsoever, not even if the item has been there forever.",UNK
284,Oh how I love in n out burger.  I try to rarely go due to the high health content of their food and the fact that I no longer live in a state without one.  I do enjoy animal style fries and animal style burgers though.  For a fast food burger place this is one of the best.,UNK
285,Not very good at all. 20 minutes wait for couple tasteless tacos and enchiladas. What the waste of time and money.,UNK
286,"My first date with my husband was at a Ricardo's location that no longer exists so I have a certain fondness for this restaurant.  A good feature is they are open late so swing shift employees can get a bite to eat after work.  However, I find the food to be middle of the road Mexican.  Not disgusting but certainly not great.",UNK
287,The food is pricey yet delicious. I recently went there for my birthday and though I accidentally made a reservation at the wrong location they still go the and my 11 friends seated in a  reasonable amount of time.\n\nMy only complaint: Its a busy place so you feel a little rushed to finish your food and get out of there.,UNK
288,"Delicious! The bread is buttery, soft in the center and a little crispy on the outside. The kale salad it fantastic as well as the potato salad. I had the turkey bacon sandwich. Very good!",UNK
289,"Company calls me nonstop after I've requested to be removed from their list. Sales associates are rude and call several times in a row on purpose. When I've asked for them not to call,  they then ask what time I would like my appointment for- just to be a smart ass. Would NEVER do business with them.",UNK
290,"The ladies actually taking care of my children are wonderful with them.  However, dealing with Crystal in the front has been a nightmare. She is rude and very unprofessional, often speaking to the other staff members condescendingly in front of parents.",UNK
291,Walked out if airport and bought a shuttle ticket - the lady was nice took time to explain everything - willie - not so friendly - looked bothered that I was interrupting his phone interactions - excuse me - driver was nice - a/c was working -,UNK
292,3 of us all ordered different items on the menu.  They were all terrible.  I think the only way this place is able to stay in business is that it is a front for something not quite legal in this state......,UNK
293,"Wings were great.  Flavorful, moist and greasy. Burger wasn't that good, and neither were the fries.  I would try to blame it on my hangover, but why were the wings so great, if I was too hung over to taste the food?",UNK
294,"I went around 2:30 am the other day and tried their cookies for the first time. I am still thinking about it...enough for me to write a review at 1:30 am. Try their white chocolate macadamia sooooo good, the chocolate chunk, not so much.",UNK
295,"Stopped in to pick up a quick burger and normally they are awesome, but tonight I have no clue what happened... Got home and the burger was cold including the fries... The onion rings were partially raw and soggy!! So disappointed! Need to change your cook!",UNK
296,"A nice place to have late night dinner. The funny thing we encounter is karaoke. We were laughing so loud we thought they will kick us out. The lady wasn't a good singer but she really tried. \nThe food was OK, nothing special we could remember.",UNK
297,"Stunning and expansive historic dining room.\n\nSecond tier restaurant overall, but certainly one of the better options downtown.\n\nService was fine, but each dish was just barely missing that extra little \""zing\"" that makes it unforgettable.",UNK
298,Worst Wendy's I been to. Its a very slow hr few cars in the drive tru & a couple in dinning room...\nThe dinning room was a mess while the whole staff in kitchen talking & laughing the restaurant looks messy never coming back to this Wendy's,UNK
299,"Love this hotel! Look forward our Vegas trips!\nLike the fact the balcony overlooked the Bellagio.\nThe place is classy and clean, which I love!",UNK
300,Pretty delicious -- very tasty sashimi platter. Loved the ambiance too -- a nice respite from the very toasty desert outside. :),UNK
301,If you're looking for chain Mexican food....stick with Macayos.  I've gotten nothing but bad food here and bad indigestion. Food quality is poor and is on par with Taco Bell.  Just drive a little further to somewhere else.,UNK
302,This place is over rated.food is good but when I ordered a steak which was highly recommended it had a lot of fat in it and the portions were very small for the dollar amount attached. Def a miss and have been back since. I'm not a drinker so the food was the only shot.,UNK
303,I have eaten here over 3 times now. The food has been consistently delicious. Have tried a new entree each time. The Italian Wedding soup is my favorite. I have ordered on each visit as my starter!,UNK
304,Starbucks are great. But the barista (Omar) was a dick. I'll stick to another Starbucks if he is behind the counter.,UNK
305,Phone number rings and rings....I think this place closed as we've stared at menus for hours and finally call to order and!  No answer.....FYI,UNK
306,This place is fantastic!\n\nYou can't go wrong. \n\nOwner seems like a great guy super friendly and thanks you for your business.\n\nChicken Parm sandwich best i have ever had.,UNK
307,I used to go here when I was a kid.  It now is awful. Very overpriced and the seafood tastes disgusting.,UNK
308,I have never stayed here but It is a good place to gamble.  Slots and video poker are pretty good.  The monorail stop makes it easy to go to and from the strip.,UNK
309,They always forget something or another for my order and then refuse to deliver it. First offense can be forgiven however it seems like a constant thing with this location. Manager Katy is rude and refused to help.,UNK
310,"Read some reviews and decided to try them out. Im very pleased with the haircut and even more pleased with the price. Walked right in, no wait, asked for what i wanted and they delivered. Will be returning!",UNK
311,"Keeping in mind that Sauce is a chain, the pizza is pretty good.  In my opinion a thinner crust is the only way to serve pizza.",UNK
312,"PLEASE!!! dnt waste your time here food NASTY service HOrrible. we came here because its right across the street from hm. if your looking for friendly go there, but good eats no! the mixed drinks are HORRIBLE!",UNK
313,"I despise Walmart in general, however, when I got a CVS quoted $80 prescription for $4 they won me over a little bit. Of course, waiting on it to be filled I spent the $76 I \""saved\""...",UNK
314,I love being a part of this church. There is a wonderful music program. Amazing outreach to the community and an incredible children's program!,UNK
315,"While this bar should appeal to me (given that it seems like a New Orleans dive bar transplanted to Las Vegas) I'm not a big fan. A lot of my friends really enjoy it, but I find myself liking it less every time I go there.",UNK
316,came on a monday night and it was pretty empty with a bunch of old guys being creepy sitting around. the bull riding was hilarious to watch though. we had one beer that took forever and then bounced. won't be coming back again. the food looked good though but we were there for the bar.,UNK
317,If five pieces is all you can eat for 19.95 then you are good. However with a limited selection for all you can eat and a smaller section of rolls this is not what is advertised. $1 charge for left over pieces too. Must be a tough market.,UNK
318,"THis is a new location, hasn't been open very long. Def gotta go. The servers and staff were all very nice and the food was great!",UNK
319,I've had excellent luck with the pizza from this place -- some of my favorite in Pittsburgh! Cheap beer on tap too.,UNK
320,"Watched the Broncos beat the Patriots here, and everyone was super friendly. Good drinks and good food. Prices are very typical for the Strip. Ask for Gabrielle (from Hawaii), she rocks.",UNK
321,"Wish it had been better when I made my one and only trip.  The menu was smallish and nothing quite appealed to me.  But I know others have enjoyed it very much, maybe I am an exception.  I like the wine suggestion it was top notch.  Staff was efficient and friendly.",UNK
322,"No wi-fi and the manager doesn't know the password to access it. If you need a spot with wireless Internet, this is not the place.",UNK
323,"A good restaurant, but well below my expectations. Delmonico is the better option for a steak in this hotel. \n\nThe food was fine, but expensive, and not better than Dolminicos, so the decision is easy for me.",UNK
324,"I am rating this based on the price of the hotel.  If I paid more per night I would probably expect more; however, I thought everything was great for the price.  The rooms were clean and almost always quiet.  The pool was awesome with a beautiful view.  I went to of the restaurants inside which were also good.",UNK
325,"Have been here three times and had chocolate, vanilla, and coconut.  Each time the flavor tasted fake after halfway through the regular portion,  Don't know exactly why.  \n\nService is good.  Lots of choices.",UNK
326,Not a fan of this place at all. The only thing that I can recommend is the crab stack salad. Delish! Stay away from the short ribs!!! Fish tacos just okay. My hubby liked it but it wasn't for me.,UNK
327,"Food and atmosphere was great, but our server Sarah was wonderful!  Thank you Sarah for great service; sadly, it's hard to find.",UNK
328,"This is one of the only attractions in Vegas that I can honestly say is worth the money.  I walked away with a lot of \""inside\"" knowledge of things that I had never seen or knew about in the human body.",UNK
329,First of all I wouldn't even give it a one star I would give it a - star.\nWhen approaching the restroom children had filled balloons with urine and threw them at people. When the child's parents are conforonted they denied responsibility and the group they were part of chased us from the park with threating language.,UNK
330,Went there for a horrible allergic reaction. Was given an article to read by the doctor and then a quiz on the article. Best part I even got his signature because he is so well known in the community! Oh and he did not even know what to do for me or help me!,UNK
331,"Okay, awesome theater...the very close seats arn't too close, and the price for what you get isn't bad since theres no other theater near us....just recomend as always bring your own food and drinks hide them! Prices for snacks are way too expensive now and days....",UNK
332,"Interesting... Within days after I mention on Yelp about all of the Pigeon Crap on their sign, they finally decided to clean it all up!  I guess their reading the reviews on here....",UNK
333,I'll make this short: best burger and milkshake I've had in Pittsburgh but use the NoWait app prior to going (it will save you a lot of time),UNK
334,"The people at these locations and the online customer support are useless, and rude.  I would not want to do business with any of these locations again.  Live and learn, and I won't be making the same mistake twice.",UNK
335,"Loved it.  Excellent steak salad and taquitos were superior.  Collaboration of Hobe Meats in partnership with Uncle Sals. Still finding their personality, but excellent chow and cocktails.  We'll be back for sure!",UNK
336,No call no show. I was so excited to get my house cleaned before vacation but my assigned professional never showed up or called. No one ever contacted me. I had to wait on the phone for 30 minutes to talk to live person to get a refund. So disappointed.,UNK
337,Total crap buffet says $15 we got here they tried charging us $86 for holiday weekend. Dude its on Monday Dec 29 not a holiday. Total scam !!!,UNK
338,"Excellent service, nice venue, delicious food. Only thumbs down was that each entree we ordered had only a few cubes of meet each. We used a groupon so not sure if that had anything to do with it. But other than that, pretty good food.",UNK
339,"Great atmosphere and beer selection! Located in uptown charlotte inside the 7th street public market.  Awesome place to have some casual pizza, have a beer, relax and enjoy the rest of the market.",UNK
340,"Place is awesome!  Tier 1 food.  Staff is great.  Megan was an amazing waitress.  Fast, funny, great smile and good recommendations.  Terrific ambience.  A little pricey so bring your wallets gentlemen.  It will be a good night.",UNK
341,"Finally Finally Finally. There is finally a decent coffee shop in this spot. I have watched so many incarnations fail here, it's exciting to see this place doing well!",UNK
342,Mediocre at best.   Eaten there 2x and was not impressed to say the least the food is bland and have left disappointed both times.,UNK
343,"this is a pretty decent buffet...went for bfast & lunch...plenty of variety...banana chips, cereal, blueberries, raspberries, omelet station (long line), meat, seafood, breads, salmon etc.",UNK
344,"i like this place, but not the hordes of pigeons that live on the roof, signage, and ledges of this plaza. i dunno if i want to come here to eat anymore. theres so much pigeon shit its overflowing to the sidewalk in some areas. isnt there a health code violation for this somewhere?",UNK
345,Pretty good - it's cheap...it's close...and they have some good chinese food for the area. They don't deliver though.,UNK
346,"dinner was fantastic...all four of us were extremely happy with the food, service was get. Overall this place is a great local restaurant",UNK
347,"They are fast, friendly, and they even have a dog treat for my pup when we drive through. Have never had any problems. They have never messed up our orders (a rarity in this area). That alone merits four stars!",UNK
348,Was sat and once our waitress was reminded about us she admitted she forgot about us. Food quality poor. Hash browns were crunchy not crispy. Will not return,UNK
349,"This is a good, not great place for dim sum. Steamed pork buns are good, shrimp shu mai is good but nothing to write home about.",UNK
350,Good Italian fare served in a lively Bistro setting.  Delicious pasta dishes were served well.\nIt was a bit expensive and the background music was terrible.\nWe'll come back.,UNK
351,"Had done a few go sees at other collision centers, and kept going. \n\nThis place? Clean. Energetic neat staff. Up to date. Fast. Professional. \n\nYou can't go wrong here.",UNK
352,"West side hidden treasure! A hole in a wall that if you can get past the less than desirable store front you will be treated to fresh prepared authentic Vietnamese cuisine. Noodle soup, spring rolls with peanut sauce an a monster pork stuffed soft pastry dumpling that was just D-lisous!!!!",UNK
353,Pho broth tends to be watered down in flavor. It's acceptable but not great. The Grilled Chicken Vermicelli bowl's are heaping healthy servings compared to most places in town. Thumbs up in that respect.,UNK
354,"I ordered the Bourbon chicken and shrimp. It tasted super good. I was disappointed a little, because it comes with saut\u00e9ed onions and \""mushrooms\"". I got no mushrooms",UNK
355,This place gets me every time.. its so soft and fluffy.. with just the right amount of sweetness.. I always have to make a stop here whenever i'm in Vegas! :) :) :),UNK
356,Frequently out of basic ingredients (e.g. waffle mix) and the staff is hit or miss. Lots of potential but they take casual to a new low.,UNK
357,"Slllllllllllllllllllllllllloooooooooooooowwwwwww.\n\nService is generally friendly, but is it worth the wasted gas idling in the drive thru and the potential that they will mess your order up 25 percent of the time?",UNK
358,"Grove Coffee.  Always friendly service, laid back atmosphere and golden coffee. Grove Coffee Shop is where people are free to connect and get lost in conversation.  Looking for a great spot where people treat you like family, come to Grove Coffee!",UNK
359,"I come here often for lunch and dinner, and love all the vegan options. The Crazy Pita salad and Mediterranean Salad are both great, and their hummus with whole wheat pita is delish. Crazy Pita is great!",UNK
360,"I drive from DC Ranch area to see the staff at Artistic Dental. They are super friendly, professional, punctual, and don't push extra products on me. I've referred numerous new-Arizonians to this place.",UNK
361,"Honestly, I don't get it. Over priced and kind of bland. Also, I ordered the Rumba Salad and some of the lettuce was brown. I really do not understand the high reviews for this place, this is not Mexican food.",UNK
362,LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE!! I have eaten there 3 times and love it.  Can't wait to go back.  All the crepes are awesome.  The 4 Cheese is to die for. Oh and the Crepe Suzette is amazing!!,UNK
363,"Really cool things for kids and family to do. If you live in this neighborhood then you already now this. The rock wall and giant pool place are definitely the main attractions, but there is also a game room, gym, boxing ring, and gym equipment. Definitely worth checking out even if it's a little out of the way.",UNK
364,"Expensive, but what do you expect from a lounge in North Scottsdale. The staff is all these pretty little fake looking girls(and guys) who are snobby as hell. I don't recommend going here",UNK
365,My favorite pizza in Gilbert. The margherita pizza is my absolute favorite. A lot of people shy away of review negatively because their pizza is NOT like commercial pizza chains. It is fresh and delicious. They have pretty good specials as well. Definitely my go-to pizza place!,UNK
366,I love chipotle. \nTheir food is so fresh and tasty. \n\nThe only thing I dislike are the peppers ... They're always dry and taste metallic.  I just avoid them but the rest if their food is epic.,UNK
367,Nothing special about the place really. I feel like it was built for the lunch hour crowd. Always loved Sam's Cafe but not sure since it changed names if it's any good.,UNK
368,"A true comic book shop. Always has a wide selection of both mainstream and underground comic titles, but always of the best of quality. No gimmicks and first rate selection and service. The fellow who runs it has always been wonderful when we drop off flyers and we hope he stays around for a long time to come!",UNK
369,"I really like this place. It has a really great vibe and I love supporting the community while getting great food! I highly recommend the friend flounder, collard greens & mac & cheese. delish!",UNK
370,"We have been here several times and love the atmosphere and how clean it is, the kids also love the arcade. We have recently discovered that they offer $1 games on Sundays so it is all the more reason to go get our bowl on. Although I am still a fan of the old school bowling alleys this place isn't too bad ; )",UNK
371,"Glorious combination of the flesh of a cow and the flesh of a fish.  Everything is delicious!  I'd highly recommend getting a combo in which you experience both types of cuisine.  Also, definitely go for the sweet potato fries.  They are the bomb.com!",UNK
372,"Palms poker room has been closed. It was closed last week. No tables, nothing. The employee I talked to sounded surprised.\n\nI was somewhat surprised, but I guess the hotel is under a new general manager and they feel like they can make more money with a different product.",UNK
373,No cage kennel. Awesome for balanced dogs that can get along with all breeds in a pack environment. Staff is incredible.  My female boxer loves it there so that makes me happy.,UNK
374,They make drinks fast and correctly for how busy it is. I just don't really like the environment. It is really loud and always packed. There are people scattered all around waiting for drinks.,UNK
375,"Ordering delivery again. Their food is just as good in the restaurant as it is delivered . Their Cheef sandwich is de-lish!! Fried chicken meal also good, comes with fries & salad! Don't pay too much attention to recent bad reviews...try it for yourself!!",UNK
376,They took off my original review because I told the truth they did a horrible job and took forever and still didn't get the order right. Sad Mexican food.,UNK
377,Thanks for not being Starbucks or Panera. Starbucks brew too strong Panera makes watery coffee. This place has choices.  I prefer light roast an really fresh!\n\nyummy treats and healthy food choices.  \n\nGlad I found it. Will come here whenever I visit the area.,UNK
378,"Don't use coupon!  You ate looked down upon and treated poorly. Waiters are not pleasant, choices are spaghetti dishes and chicken dishes without spaghetti! Food was tasty, however, not worth the abusive attitudes. Will not return.",UNK
379,"Brian (owner) was super professional, thorough and thoughtful and might be the nicest guy ever.  Highly recommend him and will definitely use his services again!",UNK
380,"Yum! Tempting selection of breads, pastries, savory sandwiches, and more!  So glad we stopped here.",UNK
381,Place is overly crowded every time I come on the weekends. People are constantly pushing and the bouncers don't seem to care. I have had my credit card stolen from the bar and my phone stolen out of my purse.,UNK
382,Great brunch spot! Loved the potato that came with the brunch entrees' and the French toast was delicious! The only down fall were the mimosas tasted a little funny with the orange juice or champagne weren't good. Other than that had a great experience!,UNK
383,"I absolutely love San Carlos Bay!\nI tried almost all of their menu and my favorites are the culichi, devil shrimp,  shrimp, octopus and scallops cocktail and the crab meat tostadas! Yumm \n\nFresh fresh seafood! Real taste of Mexico",UNK
384,"Ok, so the parking is cutthroat at times...but other than that, it's a decent little grocery store. It's close to the house, and their service is friendly enough. They have all the things I need, and I like that they are near a PetSmart.",UNK
385,Best place I've found to kill an hour or two at CLT. Just sit back and relax with a nice local brew and a BBQ sandwich. Also got good service from the cheerful bartenders.,UNK
386,"This is a great bakery located Ballantyne. I'm a huge fan of their white cake with vanilla mousse filling.  I know, vanilla, but trust me - it's not easy to get white cake right.  The crumb is tender and moist.  The simplicity in this cake is what makes is great!",UNK
387,ALERT\n\nThey changed their burgers in June 2012!\n\nReviews prior to that date are not the burger you will be served!,UNK
388,"NOT impressed. The company talks a good game about being community and family friendly. NOT TRUE.  Have not even tried the food here thanks to their rude staff and arrogant posturing that they are better than others. Don't know about the other locations, but this one on Happy Valley is one I will not be giving any money to.",UNK
389,"One of the best cupcakes I've ever tried and since I write a cupcake bakery mystery series, I eat a lot of cupcakes (research, you know).  They have the best frosting I've ever tasted and an excellent frosting to cake ratio.  I am not at all surprised that they won on Cupcake Wars.  Excellent!",UNK
390,"Pretty awesome Globe, AZ inspired Mexican food. It's not as fancy as a corporate joint but the food there in delicious. And they always have country music on. Which I appreciate! Order the #1 combo. Tamales are great",UNK
391,"Got the  imperial seafood and it was horrible, cost me 17.00 to have it delivered across the road to my work, veggies where from a bag and the seafood was really , really chewy. I am not feeling so well after eating just a small plate. Dodge this place!",UNK
392,The company I used was bought by them.  Everything about Terminix is horrible.  The only way to get them to stop charging my credit card was to let it expire.  Horrible all around.,UNK
393,Dr. Philips is gotta be one of the best pediatricians my son has ever seen!!! Clean environment and great service!!,UNK
394,I just got a carnitas rice bowl with a small drink for a tad less than $10.  The food was good enough.  I'm glad that I stopped here instead of at one of the California Pizza Kitchen outlets in this terminal.  Now on to the next flight...,UNK
395,"On multiple occasions they were not able to remove stains from the dresses, pants, etc but they charged me for the items. Not happy. I've decided that im not coming back to this place.",UNK
396,"I like Umami Burger but not this location.\n\nThe quality standard at this location was poor and what the heck, why it has to be inside a sports book? We decided to take a seat outside but even there TVs hanged on the walls and people were watching them without paying attention to the food.",UNK
397,"Had one great experience, one terrible and a lot of so so in between. It would help if they didn't  change the entire staff every week.",UNK
398,"Other than the long wait this place bis awesome.  Always good salad, pizza and pasta.  Make sure to follow it up with a pizzoookie.",UNK
399,"Wings and appetizers are always good, fun environment for the most part. Service is never outstanding, tonight in particular but bc everything else is generally good I'm sure we'll still continue to go back.",UNK
400,"Super fast service. They have different services from fingerprinting, notary, passport photos. There are different prices for fingerprinting, I'm not sure how the prices are figured out, guess it just depends on what you're getting them for. Anyways, I was in and out in ten minutes. Will send people here for sure.",UNK
401,"If you miss April we found her!! Come to this location it wonderful! It's clean, friendly and A-mazing! Food was on point! Service was perfect!",UNK
402,"Wow.  Excellent food.  Great local, place to eat.  Unique flavor. My first yelp review.  Support local business! :)",UNK
403,"The metro line is the worst I have seen of any major US cities in terms of availability and customer service.  It stops running at 11pm at the airport and only runs every 30 mins off peak hours.  Drivers never wait when they see you running towards the metro.  On the contrary, they grin and close the door right in front of you.",UNK
404,Daniel is a restaurant that expresses the pinnacle in gourmet dining.It is not to be missed.The food service and ambience say it all.,UNK
405,"The most greedy person ever.. She doesn't keep what she says, she doesn't do ANYTHING to help you.. All she wants is your money",UNK
406,"Amazing pizza! They have the best lunch special a slice of pizza, salad and soda. Great price and great food. Staff very nice and the restaurant very clean. Can't wait to go back. Delivery service also great and speedy service and have used that many times.",UNK
407,This review is based on my pool experience.  The pool is beautiful but the service lacks. The worst of my experience is my 2 year old hearing a male bartender swearing then repeating what she heard. I don't think I will be returning and I recommend not bringing young kids unless you're ok with your kids hearing swear words.,UNK
408,The view is AMAZING! Worth it if only to snap a selfie overlooking the whole strip. Wasn't a fan of the music...average...great for the twenties age range...drinks were pricy but the outside seating overlooking the strip made up for everything!,UNK
409,The locations are limited. So far so good and unable to create an online profile. I do NOT like having to call to set anything up. It's frustrating for those who work.,UNK
410,"I don't get the excitement over these darn biscuits, they aren't good at all. I've been here a few times, food it OK, and prices are OK, but I'm not impressed.",UNK
411,"The burgers are always dry and flavorless. The employees are nice here, but the food just isn't worth the price.",UNK
412,This is a great store for all pet owners who live in the area. Glad I found this store as they sell the brand of food my doggies eat. Make sure to check out this store.,UNK
413,Clean store. Bigger than most. Well organized. BUT the lines killed me!  Guy ahead of me gave up and left. I was # 5 in line.,UNK
414,This is really good Chinese food for being a small little hole in the wall with just 4 tables.  They even have real egg rolls not just spring rolls like most others out here in the valley.,UNK
415,"Delicious and savory burgers and unique mixture of ingredients. The service was warm, honest and genuine.  I would recommend to anyone.",UNK
416,"Really mixed feelings about this place.  My green chili burrito was great (spicy as promised) but it was $10 with a small drink.  It felt dingy and dirty inside, not kept up at all.\n\nI've rated it a 3 because of the good food, maybe a bit generous.",UNK
417,"I couldn't be happier with the job these guys did on my tile! Not only was it quality work, but it was also quality customer service. After getting bad customer service it truly makes you appreciate the good ones. They were so friendly and quick. Thanks for making my tile and grout look beautiful and thank you for just being nice people.",UNK
418,Been in three airports on our trip to North Carolina. I know it's summer. What happen to the air conditioning. They've lied if its about being GREEN. It's about the other green!!!,UNK
419,"Though we got off  to a bumpy start I must say that my most recent visit to the center was a pleasant surprise.  I found the staff to be warm, caring and knowledgeable.\n\nI was shown a great deal of respect and compassion  and for that I am appreciative.",UNK
420,Do not try to split the check on 2 credit cards that seems to be an impossible task for the staff of this IHOP to accomplish. It took about 30 min and I ended up having to pay in cash because they could not figure it out. No compensation or discount was offered.,UNK
421,"Worst place to eat. Go somewhere else. They even Charged me extra for my 10 year because he was taller than 5ft. Terrible service, dirty and smelly. Never coming back again.!",UNK
422,"The best pizza ever ate, crust and cheese and yum!  Delicious!  2year old says yum yum too as we eat!!",UNK
423,"Absolutely best sushi and service ever!...i love, I love sushi...favorite rolls are: jackpot roll, kiss of fire, and screaming orgasm....i just love this place! If u haven't been here yet, u've got to give it a try.",UNK
424,I was pleasantly surprised. I'm Indian and so I'm always skeptical of places like this. I thought it was really good. Seriously. Just don't expect an Indian experience it's adapted for a wider audience.,UNK
425,"Unfortunately, when I came by to drop off some shoes to get new heels, the store was empty with a sign that said the space was for lease. Michael's is no more - at least in this location. I had a good experience with them before, it's too bad.",UNK
426,"I enjoy this place for their pancakes and their eggs which they always cook just the way I like them, crispy on the outside and the yoke still a little bit runny\n\nSome of their waffle and omelette combinations are interesting and my kids seem to enjoy the waffles with fruit on top",UNK
427,"Not good, the stuff looks great but very dry and lacking in the flavor department. The only reason we stopped there was because our favorite bakery was closed and we wanted sweets. \nThe place is dirty as well, I didn't expect that from a shop in Summerlin.",UNK
428,Friday night I went home and got extremely sick. I can only think it was some kind of bad food eaten at Malabar. We will not be back.,UNK
429,I ordered Chicken Piccata and Caesar Salad and my boyfriend order Chicken Parm. Both meals were delicious although the chicken on mine was a little thick. I prefer thinner cutlets. \n\nStaff was friendly and personable and atmosphere was cozy. I will definitely be back!,UNK
430,Greedy when it comes to Wi-Fi. Spent 19 dollars between two people and got a 4-7 dollar time allot for one hour. Drinks are expensive and super sweet.,UNK
431,Hot and sour soup is very bitter. It is almost like it is made of pure sour. Food is decent. My husband enjoyed the rice. It was mediocre Chinese food.,UNK
432,Excellent service!  I brought my truck in for tire repair and the wait was longer than expected so I had to leave. I brought in back a few days later and I was not charged for the repair because of the wait.,UNK
433,"Great breakfast, really enjoyed the breakfast potatoes, that are typically a miss for me, and the biscuit was tender and flaky. I am in the area all the time and never realized this little gem was there. Definitely can easily become a new breakfast fav!!!",UNK
434,BEWARE le thai has been operating with a C grade from the health district for the last month. I am highly upset with their lack of cleanliness & will no longer be returning,UNK
435,It's a hidden treasure.  Great food with great prices and a spicy owner.  What a mixture- you won't regret the visit.,UNK
436,What? No flat screens in the room? \n\nThe Gold Coast has flat screen TV's (and a quicker check-in).,UNK
437,"Knowledgeable, courteous staff that go above and beyond on the job. They have done my TV's, Security Cameras and additional wiring. A local company that is based in Las Vegas, highly recommend.",UNK
438,I've been disappointed lately with the daily flavors....they don't have enough flavor to them anymore.   The staff is great but they need to LOWER the prices and add more flavoring to the daily soft serve flavors.,UNK
439,"Really didnt like how this place looked from the outside, totally ate my words when I tried the food. I would say this is the best Thai place to eat in Vegas or at least one of the top 3. Its a hidden treasure.",UNK
440,Basic fast food style crepe place. I had a mushroom and cheese crepe which was entirely decent but really nothing exceptional. The have a $10 credit card minimum.,UNK
441,This place rules.  Spend your money here!!!!!  Everything is cooked to perfection.  Lobster melt just changed my life.  Thank you past reviewers for bringing me here!,UNK
442,"Total Con artists.  I support Discount Tires, but these guys specifically tried to scam me more in ways then one.  The Discount tire on Thomas around 35th street are much more honest.",UNK
443,"The product is good, but Brandon added extra upsell items onto my bill and then was a jerk when I asked for a refund. I will NEVER return.",UNK
444,"Great authentic Mexican food, friendly service, tasty drinks and excellent mexican beer selection. Never crowded hopefully business picks up soon because it would be sad to see such a great place close.",UNK
445,This is by far the worse KFC I have ever been to. No matter what I have ordered it takes for ever. The food taste old! We need corporate to come revamp the staff and retrain on the cooking or they won't stay be in business much longer.,UNK
446,A $10 meal is a fair trade to finally be rid of Babystacks in my restaurant wheelhouse. My family and friends have suckered me into eating here so many times. Simply an epic fail on making over medium or poached medium eggs. Service is always polite and personable even when missing the mark on attention to detail.,UNK
447,"Omg, this is the most expensive buffet ever! Two people for $116.73?!! We enjoyed their strawberry juice the most. It is the most expensive juice bar ever and the loud music gives you indigestion. Server Maryam was very good and nice!",UNK
448,One of the worst BBQ I've ever had! Old and very dry! Service was okay. Wouldnt go back if you payed me $100!,UNK
449,"Not great. I don't get the four and five star reviews for this place, I really don't. And the food wasn't terrible.  Just severely overrated and overpriced.  After a few dishes, completely un-wowed, we moved on to greener pastures.",UNK
450,"Dr. Halmi is such a good doctor. He has helped me with some serious, and some, not so serious skin problems. He has made me look better and feel better about my appearance. His staff is very professional and friendly. They are all caring and optimistic people.",UNK
451,I live out of state but have family in Phoenix and every time I visit I make sure to make an appointment  for a visit to the salon. Such a friendly and professional staff. You always feel comfortable and at ease. The stylists are all top notch. Have enjoyed every appointment I have ever had there and always leave feeling refreshed.,UNK
452,Wasn't really ready to be put on the spot here BUT Little Chicago's may just be the best pizza ever. The service is awesome too and our delivery driver Travis was super friendly. I think I've said enough at this point! Thanks LCP!,UNK
453,Still serves the best full Scottish breakfast I've ever enjoyed... I miss Edinburgh! There's usually a copy of the List hanging around for you to peruse whilst waiting for your breakfast. I wish more coffee shops would offer a free copy of the List to flick through rather than acting as a magazine retailer.,UNK
454,"I'm a fan. I'm a tourist. I'm also a frequent visitor, and shopping here never gets old. \n\n$$ Have fun! $$",UNK
455,"I had my birthday party there with 30+ people and it was the best birthday ever!\nThey have awesome staff and the manager is very helpful and accomodating. Plus, they have really good discounts on the rooms and alcohol. \nI give them two thumbs up!!",UNK
456,"Thanks Jack! The food was good, service was fast. It was Jack In The Box. We do not have this in Florida, so it was a nice treat on this trip. Jack In The Box tacos and curly fries are still my favorite.\n\nThis place was particularly clean.",UNK
457,WORST card ever!!! Don't fall in their trap. WORST customer service. Unfortunately they have nooooooo idea about customer service. Don't fall in their trap. Rip off!!!!!!!!,UNK
458,"You should come here for the pizza, but if you don't get some homemade dessert...... you are missing out!",UNK
459,"Frustrating place. The clothes and prices are good, but the staff is rude. I often wonder why since they're selling used clothes and shoes.",UNK
460,"Didn't even get a chance to try this place. Tried calling in to make sure they were open before we ventured out, but the clerk that answered the phone was incredibly rude. I didn't hear him the first time and his response was \""DID I STUTTER?\"" Cool service, bro",UNK
461,"This is not Fine Art photography.  Having money and friends to comment and say it is, does not make it so.  I have seen better pictures on tablets and phones.  The video is laughable and so amateur its pathetic.  Look at some real photographers and artists before launching this joke of a gallery.",UNK
462,"Dear Manager,\nIt is a bad idea to argue in the foyer with a customer who is complaining about how long it took for their to go order. In addition, I suggest you find the source of the vomit-like smell that was the ultimate reason we didn't even wait to be seated.",UNK
463,Love Einsteins but do not love this location.  Employees are a bit scary and the food prep area appears dirty.  Won't come back.  Wish they could get some help.,UNK
464,"Horrible...the \""fresh vegies\"" were freezer burned ... The Steak was over cooked and dry..will never be back...ooh and the price was high the food should have been free",UNK
465,"The staff is so friendly and the food was very, very good. Greeted with a smile and served quickly. Once i went in for just a drink and the lady taking care of the bar was very busy so TK waited on me. Everyone around me seemed relaxed and comfortable being there.",UNK
466,"Used to come here frequently when I was younger and remember how busy it was. Now, it seems like the mall  has more vacant spaces than stores. It's depressing really.  Seems like it's just a matter of time before the entire mall goes bankrupt. I can't imagine they're making much money remaining open.",UNK
467,"Gilbert just got the kind of place that will make their whole downtown area that much nicer. This is a destination spot, and it doesn't disappoint. Amazing selection of wines. Bruschetta that makes your mouth water. The atmosphere is super comfortable and relaxing. You could spend hours here and not even know it",UNK
468,Called her office to try and get in to see her after I think I miscarried over Labor Day weekend and they couldn't get me in for 4 days!  They didn't care about me as a patient or my situation which I consider to be a pretty high priority.  Thanks a lot to that office!,UNK
469,Great happy hour specials! It's nice to get a drink close to home and watch a game and not spend too much money. I had the chips and queso as well and those were pretty good to snack on. Service has always been great as we,UNK
470,I really enjoyed the food at this place however the service could use a little work. The oysters and mussels were excellent and the filet melts in your mouth. Having to wait a really long time for our server to bring a bottle of wine and take our order knocked this place down to 4 out of 5 stars.,UNK
471,Was highly average.    Burgers were greasy and nothing special.  Wouldn't take a special trip for it.   \nI agree.  In &Out way better!,UNK
472,"Soooo not worth $60 a night. Rooms were so so. Beds hard, pillows gave me a headache and bathroom falling apart. Continental breakfast sucked. Only consisted of a box of croissants, some mini muffins, yogurt and coffee. So walked to McDonalds to eat :/",UNK
473,"The pizza is GOOD. The prices are GOOD. The people who run the place are friendly, and it's locally owned. If you don't like this place, you're probably spoiled and used to going to lame places to eat. Never disappointed here. You get your food fast and it tastes great.",UNK
474,Gotta love open signs but doors locked. There were still cars in the drive thru. Pulled on the door assuming they were still open since it was 5 minutes to closing and got flipped off by the employee inside. NEVER GOING BACK.,UNK
475,"When I first saw their hours of operation I thought it was a mistake and they meant to write p.m., instead of a.m., but now that I have eaten there twice it makes more sense. When nothing else is open, and you're wasted, I'm sure this place ROCKS!",UNK
476,This is a wonderful family owned restaurant with amazing service. Bagels are the best! Both the breakfast and lunch menus are extensive and the kitchen is very willing to make any dietary exceptions you have.,UNK
477,"I don't recommend at all. It was cheap- $20 for gel removal and a regular mani- but crappy. Unfriendly workers and the polish was very unevenly applied. No point at all to the massage, it sucked. Chipped within a few days. Also, parking sucks.",UNK
478,"Baggage, security and check-in were a breeze. I flew out at night so crowds were low. When I flew in during the day, it was busy, but not crazy.",UNK
479,"Hot wings and burgers sounded great after a night out, but I was really disappointed.  The bartender took all of our orders correctly (i could tell by the receipt) but every single order came out of the kitchen wrong! Not gonna come back again for a late night snack.",UNK
480,"Amazing, not only do they make awesome crepes, but their other desserts just will blow you away.  You need to make sure you go and try the future of street vendors here in Phoenix",UNK
481,I visited Meatballz several weeks ago before a night at the movies. All I can say is that the Calzone crust was obviously made out of Pillsbury's Hot Roll Mix and dry out of the box tortellini is not what I expected for nearly $9 for a small bowl. Never returning.,UNK
482,"Great service, great selection, great price!  Everyone here is so friendly and helpful and be sure to check out their clearance section! It is easy to see how someone could have a hard time deciding what to buy, but it is well worth the time!",UNK
483,Service was slow as heck. And trust me I've been to heck before. Took about 20 min after ordering to get food and all I ordered were two beef tacos. Food quality was sorta redeeming though. Also closed half the restaurant because they wanted to leave early so it was impossible to find seating.,UNK
484,The service was good but I can't say the same about the food.  My food was super greasy and it just did not taste good.  The prices are kind of high too.,UNK
485,"So this place suffers the same issue that all buffets do: average quality food for $10. If you want some Indian food, then it's fairly good. The choices don't seem many compared with other buffets. The coconut soup had a piquant spicy taste to it that I suggest anyone try.",UNK
486,"Love coming here for there happy hour every week. It has great appetizers. I highly recommend the beef empanadas, so good.",UNK
487,"I dont know how this place stayed open. The last thing I ordered was horrible it was something simple that I figured couldn't be messed up: Chicken Fried Rice... the chicken was dark and hard, the taste was horrible. I tried the place again hoping for a better visit... not impressed.",UNK
488,"Service was slow and it was like the waitress didn't want to be there. Food came out quickly. I recommend the buffalo wings and house ranch sauce, but the fried fish and chicken fingers were completely absent of any flavor. No seasoning at all! Also, expensive so not quite 3 stars.",UNK
489,"Pros: Large selection\nCons: High prices, dusty & unorganized warehouse, matching tiles are impossible to find in different ends of the store, horrible customer service, vending machines don't work and management doesn't care on a 112F degree day",UNK
490,"Oak's is the greatest breakfast place in Arizona. I will never get tired of the questions pankcakes or toast on the side. Pancakes always wins, always. Stay hungry my friends.",UNK
491,"I'll keep it simple. You are missing out if you don't try this place. It has the best Indian food with amazing service. \n\nAll I can say is the next time you want to grab food, come here and you will leave happy and stuffed.\n\nWe cannot wait to go back!",UNK
492,Best place to relax after a long drive. They have so many different rooms to explore. Definitely will be back on my next trip to Vegas!,UNK
493,"I love Bobby Flay! But his food is disappointing. We had lunch there and got the chicken salad and sandwich. It's good, but not great. I expected more from the iron chef. Maybe dinner is better.",UNK
494,Fish n chip special was good. Nice range of happy hour discount drinking. Kathy was an excellent server but disappeared after round two. Or was it three?,UNK
495,"Still loving this place!  If you like yogurt and granola, try theirs it's exceptional.  BLT's are great too (FYI, they put a fried egg on their BLT).",UNK
496,"Meehh...this place is aiight. Came here for happy hour only to be disappointed by their limited selection. Even the beers are are scarce. If I were you, I would walk across the lot and go to Fridays. At least they have IPA there.",UNK
497,The hotel is in an excellent location near the Capitol and State Street. It's about a mile from the main campus. I found the room to be very dated and the walls thin. The concierge was just okay. The shuttle driver from the airport arrived promptly and was very friendly. The lobby is beautiful and spacious.,UNK
498,"My younger sister suggested Archi's for lunch and I enjoyed the place, however I prefer Thai BBQ better.  Archi's ambiance is pretty, service is good but food is not the most delicious.  Overall experience is fair.",UNK
499,This store rocks the one stop cell phone shop for all your needs.  They helped me unlock my phone and I didn't have to pay all this crazy money to attend no more! Good job wireless toyz,UNK
500,"Food good, service horrendous.  Sitting at the bar, by myself with servers and a bartender more interested in gossiping than any awareness of service.  I had to ask for, \""can I order\"", \""refill\"", \""pay\"", etc., virtually ignored.  Won't be back.",UNK
501,No credit cards here.  Be prepared for some embarrassment. The address is wrong here. It's in gilbert not chandler,UNK
502,"Great breakfast spot.  I prefer the other location on Ironwood, as the acoustics kinda suck here and it gets noisy.  But same good grub.  Portions are generous, prices reasonable, service friendly.",UNK
503,"The food is pretty great diner food.  However, the last time I was here the waitress whistled along to the song \""Pumped up Kicks\"".  I now hope it gets struck by a meteorite.",UNK
504,"I have been here twice and both times they have messed up on the orders and messed up on the bill. Service is super slow, I think they dont have enough people working. I got my salad 30 minutes before I got the dressing. Dressing doesn't equal dessert.",UNK
505,"Best part is ordering online, picking it up after work and eating good grub while relaxing at home. I like that while it's a busy location, we don't have long waits for a table when we do decide to dine in.",UNK
506,Only one pool that's always dirty. No fitness area. Crappy maintenance and upkeep of the apartments. Can't wait to move out!!,UNK
507,This church is great.  The message is something I can relate to and the music is fantastic.  The Peoria campus is huge!!  If you are looking for a smaller experience you may want to visit one of the other locations.  Message is via video for most services.,UNK
508,"Expensive for breakfast but worth it. Friendly cute staff, plenty of creative menu items and free wifi. The protein pancakes are gonna make you smile and if you are trying to hydrate this is your place. They serve every table with an iced and lemoned pitcher of aqua. The mural of America was fun to study.",UNK
509,"Best teriyaki chicken I've found since I moved to Arizona from Seattle, where you can find delicious teriyaki on every corner. I will definitely return.",UNK
510,I ate here for the first time today and I was very impressed! The food was very fresh and full of flavor! This place is very clean and the employees are very nice. I was also impressed with the price. I'll be returning often!,UNK
511,"Don't judge a book by its cover. Inside is clean and roomy and the food is great. Very fresh and delicious. The people there are friendly too. So glad I checked yelp for a place to eat here in Madison, WI. \nMy steak tacos were terrific. Muy Bueno!",UNK
512,This place is off the Hook! All of the food was excellent. Service was perfect and the beer was cold. Great atmosphere with the music from the Carnival Court. Good price and great portions.,UNK
513,Today was my first visit to CCV and I loved it! Everyone was extremely friendly and welcoming. I really like how modern it is compared to the church I went to where I used to live. I will definitely return!,UNK
514,Ambiance was incredible the food was at best underwhelming. For the price the food should have been MUCH better. Lacking flavor and skimpy ingredients.,UNK
515,"I think I prefer Fat Tuesday. The drinks weren't strong, the \""cola\"" flavored drink tasted like flat RC cola, and it was pricey. \n\nThree stars just because the server was sweet. One star for the drink and price and five stars for the server equals three.",UNK
516,"Tried to have dinner here on a Sunday at around 7pm, it was closed.  Although it did say that they were open till 11.  BOOOOOO",UNK
517,"I loved the decor of this restaurant since itself is a historical building. The food was not bad but I would say the biggest selling point of this place is the ambiance. I had the oysters, calamari, and blue crab and they were pretty good. They have good wine selections as well.",UNK
518,"Love the fruits! Great prices as well! Open 24 hours (if I'm not mistaken).\n\nFyi, during the winter time, it turns to a Christmas tree place",UNK
519,"Went here on a Friday night with a party of 7. Food is very good and reasonably priced for Vegas however service was terrible. More than 40 mins to get our food, plus our bill was wrong and management was rude and refused to credit us.",UNK
520,This place has GREAT Philly Cheesesteaks!  Fat Tire on tap.  Video Poker.  What's not to love??  I'll tell you.  They're closing on 12/19/13 at 8 pm.  Sad.  Go get a cheesesteak before you can't.,UNK
521,I have up and down run in with this place. It's too often down. This time was too much. I was not help by Bob. I asked a few questions and he acted as if I requested a personal loan from him. Very rude. If I can avoid SW I will. Thanks Bob you really made sure to ruin my experience.,UNK
522,"Cheesecake Factory is yummy. They have the most amazing veggie burger that is actually handmade, and I love their french fries. Plus, of course, the cheesecake is fantastic. Try the cookie dough cheesecake!\n\nOh, and the asian salad is enormous. fyi.",UNK
523,"Good for sports, local music, food, and drinks! Weeknight entertainment like trivia, karaoke, and Bingo can't be beat.",UNK
524,"Been here for about 10 mins & no one has acknowledged that I'm here, not even a \""Hello\"". Wow!",UNK
525,"so far so good, staff wont give out the gate code to residents, they dont seem very helpful. The apartment itself is really nice and the price is good for its location. Hopefully it will get better.",UNK
526,I have not been super impressed lately with service.  One deposit at the window - now takes 10 minutes.  When the last bank manager was there - it was NOT this way.  They have not hired appropriate personnel.,UNK
527,"We Never had potatoes in enchiladas before, not good. Asked for more salsa and chips, they never came, marguerites were lousy. Service was very poor. With all the Mexican choices this doesn't cut it.",UNK
528,This is a great breakfast stop. Super at getting people seated & orders taken. Coffee refills are quick! The food is very good...the only reason for 4 stars is that the gravy is so typically Arizona bland! Are there any good biscuit and yummy sausage gravy places in Phoenix?,UNK
529,The food was OK at best. We want on Monday in the after-noon and it looks like they were serving food left over from the past weekend.,UNK
530,Had my first blow out today at the new spot. Very friendly and my stylist did a great job. They use top of the line Aveda products and my hair smells fabulous. I enjoyed a tasty cup of coffee and chocolates. I'll be back again,UNK
531,"Food is mediocre.  Service is terrible.  They do have Negra Modelo on tap, but nothing else is worthwhile.  They also won't split checks for groups bigger than 3.  That's just lazy.  Go somewhere else.",UNK
532,One word SLOW appointments are worthless. You arrive 15 minutes early and get in 45 minutes late. They say 45 minutes to an hour it takes 2 hours.,UNK
533,I really love Lumberjacks. My husband and I used to go every Monday as a day date. I can't believe it's the same place after reading the reviews. We've never had anything less than exemplary service with incredible food.The portions are huge and the service is fast.,UNK
534,This is the best Mimi storage that I have ever used.  Very honest and trust worthy.\n Very friendly and they will bend over backwards to help you out.  Month to month rental.  Much better than my last Mini Storage.,UNK
535,"just, well, gross.  \n\nThe food was just downright awful.  I got a chicken burrito & the chicken was weird & disgusting & I got sick halfway through eating.  \n\nThere are plenty of Mexican & pseudo Mexican restaurants in Charlotte to go to, choose them instead.",UNK
536,Not a fan.  We had a breakfast buffet for a meeting there and the food was... not much of a buffet.  Potatoes were cold and greasy and the rest of the food was just not very good.  Have not had lunch or dinner here.,UNK
537,"I had a 1 day notice to have a birthday party for 20 people. Called Red devil at 8:30pm and made a reservation for 20 the next day. The food was great, the service was great Thanks so much!",UNK
538,"I'm not a big club person, so I heard there was an Irish pub in Vegas, I was there on my first night. Good selection of Irish beer. We had HUGE chicken pot pies served in a pail. Soooo good.",UNK
539,Everything was a mess. The plates the salt and pepper shakers were all gross. The baked potato was covered in dirt then cooked. Great almost 30$ (for two) for nothing. I had to ask for a fork because there was none in there place. The inside is a huge mess. Ugh what a waste.,UNK
540,"Expensive and you will leave hungry.  We spent over 50 $ on dinner and it felt like an appetizer.  The waitress was attentive, to our neighbors, but could care less about our table.  She spoke very little english which made it hard to communicate with her.  Save your money on the sushi and hit somewhere else.",UNK
541,"CHEF H IS CLOSED\n\nWe went when it first opened.  Echo similar comments -- not cheap, but good mediterranean food (only one close).  It was good, not great.  Too bad to see it go though.",UNK
542,Good burgers and shakes...need new fries though. There are too many competitors in the area with burgers and fries within the same price point that  they need to step up the fries to entice people to choose them.,UNK
543,Overpriced. I mean the food was o.k but it is something I can make at home. The food took too long to get to my table.The staff acted weird with me.I am not going back.Very nice decor though.,UNK
544,"Ugh. Waste of my time. Unlike the other shows in quality.\nI couldn't wait for it to be over. Go see mystere, O,The Beatles \nI have loved all the rest.. This was a really sad show in comparison !",UNK
545,"yeah, the kids ain't lying, this place blows. one extra star for the late nite nature of it.\n\nwe can only hope it gets replaced by a 24 hr chipotle's.",UNK
546,"DELICIOUS! Amazing service; I felt welcomed from the moment I walked in the door. Excellent Pinot Noir paired with my meal. \nRestrooms are a little tricky, right by the kitchen, got bumped by fellow patrons and staff; none the less did not detract from my experience!",UNK
547,"Absolutely not worth it!! The food is not good and the meat is tasteless. Service is so, so but definitely not worth the price.",UNK
548,"Short and simple, this buffet was decent, but didnt live up to the hype, and seemed like just your average buffet.  The food variety was decent, but quality was lack-luster, the only thing I really liked was the prime rib and the plethora of desserts.",UNK
549,"Never had a bad meal here, breakfast lunch or dinner.  Prices are very reasonable and the people are very welcoming.  One thing that needs improvement is the coffee.  I think they let the hot water wink at the grounds.  Way to weak.",UNK
550,Great food HORRIBLE service and service sets you apart. Fix the staff you are only as good as your WORST employee so that is bad.,UNK
551,I like the food.  Love the thai iced tea.  I can inhale those.  The pad thai is very good and I love the pineapple curry.  I did order some egg rolls for the kids one time and the meat was bad but they replaced it so all is well but a tiny bit scared to go back.,UNK
552,Hey were awesome. I was supposed to get a ride home on a Saturday night in Scottsdale at 2am and needs to go 10 miles from there. All the other companies were trying to charge me over $30 but Great value taxi can was able to beat their prices and got me home safely! Thanks so much guys!,UNK
553,"Huge beer selection, you won't be disappointed!\n\nBasically where all the Computer Science students hang out. And that's pretty awesome.",UNK
554,"I went there for drinks with friends who were visiting from out of town.  Being new to Arizona myself wanted to explore what old town had to offer.  If you are not a regular they ignore you completely.  Bar staff was not friendly, manager was not very professional.  We left before finishing drinks and had an excellent time some of,the other places nearby.",UNK
555,"Visited the PT's on Tropicana two nights in a row during my recent Vegas misadventures.  Really enjoyed the huge mugs of Stone IPA, the tasty food from chef Sonia Lima -- and most of all the outstanding service from bartender Liz Brainard.  I'll be back!",UNK
556,"If you are looking for a place of worship on the North side of Las Vegas, this is a great place to come!! They have a place for your children while you enjoy the worship and receive the Word of God!! The youth have their own services on Sunday nights. It's a great place for them too.",UNK
557,Ok. Recap two months later. My wife and I revisited. Service and employee attitudes have greatly improved. We will come back.,UNK
558,Nice shop. Good music. They were able to take me as a walk in. Perfect price. This is now where I will be getting my hair cut from now on.,UNK
559,"Best best best!!!  Everything a former NY Gal could ask for!!  The heroes are awesome. The pizza is awesome. The canolis and zeppolis are to die for!!! If you are looking for authentic and I mean authentic NY Italian, this is it!!",UNK
560,"Overpriced and slow. \nIf you order the seafood tasting, they will ask you if you want one of them to come out first. This is a trick. They charged me for a crab cake appetizer, instead of just bringing the crab cake out that comes with the entree.",UNK
561,I can't believe I've never stop by here and it's right around the corner from my house.  Found my new coffee spot.  Got the buttermilk vanilla doughnut and a regular coffee with steamed almond milk and they where both delicious.,UNK
562,"Wow. What bad customer service! Not even a hello when we came in. Nobody had a smile on his or her face,  from waiter to owner/cashier. The ph was less than decent. My cousin could not finish his bowl. When we paid,  the change was thrown onto the counter instead of handing it to us.",UNK
563,Very disappointed with the effort to put on a festival at Henderson Pavillion.  Is there no one in charge that knows what is going on?  Good luck at having a second one. The line was longer to get an entrance refund than the one for those hoping for crawfish.,UNK
564,"I love their hibachi shrimp & seaweed salad!  Good & fast.  I can't say anything about the sushi.  The staff is attentive, but the ambiance leaves something to be desired!",UNK
565,stopped in for drinks and a bite to eat had the angus sliders... just ok... dry buns and the burgers looked like half dollars on the bun; small... drinks were ok and can't mess up a beer so maybe next time...,UNK
566,Very poor customer service there staff has an attitude I won't ever step foot in their store again because of the amount of disrespect they gave me!,UNK
567,"Had the waffle with cinnamon ice cream. It was good, but not $6 good. It's somewhat of a trap bc if you really want a waffle that's the only option nearby. \nIf you really want a waffle and price is no option then this is the place to go.",UNK
568,They produce their own beer that is good and with nice prices. The food was OK. I loved the Apfelstrudel.\nThe restaurant is a good choice for big groups.,UNK
569,"Everything here is cheap. Cheap food, cheap drinks and cheap tables. If you happen to stumble into this place, try their steaks.",UNK
570,"Soggy french fries, an okay burger and that's about it. Oh, and it will cost about 10 bucks.",UNK
571,Have to say out of All the Chicago Deep Dish Pizza's in AZ they do it better.  \nJust wished they had the Stuffed Crust version like Giordianos.  \n\nVery Good.,UNK
572,"This review is based on one shopping trip where I scored three great finds: a Banana Republic shawl, almost new black cardigan, and a cute oversized checked knit cardigan - all for $10. The cashier was great and knocked a couple of bucks off for me.",UNK
573,"Ok, so it's Panda Express, just like every other Panda, but without the express part. I have never come here and not waited for them to have to make food. Forget about eating here is there is more than a couple of people in front of you.",UNK
574,One of the last old school Tiki bars in America.  Whenever I am playing tour guide in Vegas I always take my friends to Frankie's.  The drinks and atmosphere are absolutely awesome.  A nice break from the glitz and noise of the strip.  Like everything in Vegas it won't be here forever so see it while you can.,UNK
575,Love this gym. Everyone's so nice n helpful. No weird-o's stareing at you making you feel uncomfortable. Great equipment. Always go early in a.m. for best workouts,UNK
576,"I never could have pulled of my photo shoot in my mothers dress without Jaime! She is just simply amazing! I loved her so much, I am having her do my makeup for wedding and my entire bridal party! Hire her! She rocks!",UNK
577,"Best greek cafe in town! Best gyros, best baklava! the garlic fries were unique (never had them before or anywhere else) loved them! Its hidden behind the Pho 87! the owners Nicole and Buddy are really nice and committed to excellent service and getting to know the neighborhood customers! Please tell them Alex sent you!",UNK
578,John did my nails ..I love this place..I was a walk in and they got me right in.!!! the staff is awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!! I would recommend this place to everyone.,UNK
579,Always good food.  Great food wish we made it to this part of town more.  Have had problems with service in the past but they seem to be much better.  Will be back for more....cheesecake.,UNK
580,"No place settings - had to steal from empty table.  Dough wasn't cooked all the way, cold and doughy in spots with hot toppings? Frozen pizza kinda quality. Salads were drenched in dressing to the point of soggy lettuce.",UNK
581,Really been wanting to try this place out. I'm glad did. I got a croissant sandwich. It came with chips and a pickle. The croissant was very flaky and light. The price was fairly reasonable for what you get. I will definitely come here again.,UNK
582,Udupi used to be better a couple of years ago.  I'm pretty sure ownership changed and it is not as good any more.  I agree with the other user that the lunch buffet  does not seem fresh and often cold during peak lunch hour.  The bread is fresh and hot and service is good as well.,UNK
583,Awful. I was shocked. Long wait and sub par food at the very best. I wish I had taken a picture of our food... Chicken Caesar salad was the most pitiful thing I've ever seen... smh,UNK
584,I loved it. The bodies look so realistic and they definitely have a lot of interesting fact everyone should know. It took us about an hour to go through the exposition,UNK
585,"I have a 24 Hr Fitness membership and even though they do have a basketball court, LVAC is still my favorite gym. The Flamingo, Eastern, and N Rainbow gyms are very high quality and the classes are very high quality. My favorite gym.",UNK
586,Very cheap everybody comes here because it was the Imperial Palace beforehand and it's the best location for everything but not great rooms in horrible service and I lived in Las Vegas.  there is 1 foreign maid that is nice.  find her for your help on cleaning.  I stayed here till i left to move to Seattle.,UNK
587,This is a pretty cool bar to have drinks before or after dinner.   The chandelier is 3 stories high and there's a bar at each level.  The drinks are pretty pricey but its great for people watching and relaxing.,UNK
588,Good food.  Enjoyed my collard greens and biscuit the most!  Definitely a good place to go if you are looking for comfort food!,UNK
589,"Overall, the food was mediocre. I've had much better  bun at many other restaurants. Spring rolls were quite tasty however. The pho was acceptable, but light on veggies and herbs. Service on the other hand was absolutely terrible! Very rude waiter and waitress! Would not go back again just because of that!",UNK
590,I have taken my vehicle here for several months. The quality has gone down hill to the point that I won't be going back.,UNK
591,Highly recommend Stylist Jessica Aquino! She is amazing and takes the time to get to know her clients. She always makes me feel extra special and I always leave with fabulous hair!,UNK
592,My favorite store!\nVery pricey even with a student discount\nI've learned 2 pretend 2 be a AI student and get my Windsors there @ the AI student store along with prismas. AI student store is cheap on culinary kits as well & Aaron brothers has better quality brushes,UNK
593,This place was Horrid.  We sent our food back it was so bad.  We got fried rice that was a bit of steamed rice with cabbage.  Nasty.  Do not go here - also very overpriced with no value !!!  Sodas are $5.00 - ridiculous!!!,UNK
594,I ate here on dec 12 2013 and got FOOD POISONING . I was sick for 2 days . Friendly service and good sandwiches do not make up for serving bad product to guests.,UNK
595,"Mac and cheese was okay, but nothing special as I'd been led to believe. Fennel bisque was also just okay. Service was good, and I liked the atmosphere, but it's gotta be about the food. I'll give them another try at some point.",UNK
596,"One of the few places in vegas with some real character and REAL food !!!! Nightly events and the best Happy Hour !!!!\nIf you want a place for Happy Hour , this is IT !!!!!",UNK
597,"Got a 12 Oz prime rib for lunch and flavor wise it was meh it arrived cold needed salt and 1/4 of my steak was just a chunk of fat took a nice photo, not a fan.",UNK
598,"This place was ok until I went in the other day. The cook didn't wear gloves when grabbing my bacon from the fridge. When I complained n walked out he had the nerve to shrug his nasty shoulders and say \""oh well.\"" Stay away from this location.",UNK
599,We ordered the basil pesto chicken pizza. Flavor wise it was okay. The main turn off how how greasy the base was. My hands were coated with grease and afterwards my mouth felt all greasy.,UNK
600,"Great time! Laughed the whole time, great comedians. Drinks were delicious,  psychotic episode was my favorite. Howard- whom runs the place is friendly and funny as well.",UNK
601,"Had read in the Post-Gazette that Gaucho was now open on Sundays. Looked at their website, and it does, in fact, list hours on Sunday from 11am-4pm. Drove about 30 minutes into town today to check it out. Sign on door read closed. FAIL!!!",UNK
602,I was foolish to be hungry for something here!\n\nMy water had some pinkish creature or whatever it may be that happened to be swimming around. Disgusting!\n\nForks are definitely not spotless. Thank goodness I had a sandwich so I just used my hands.,UNK
603,"Been there many times and had a chance to visit again this week.  Great service, nice beer selection, yummy food.  Only complaint, not a fan of seating so close that you can hear your neighbor's conversation...Overall, a great \""go to\"" you can trust to take customers or have a nice dinner with friends.",UNK
604,the view is as breathtaking as it looks and the food is XXXquisite!!! the soy glazed snapper was on point like acupuncture and their chzcake is almost as good as mine. very cool date place she was amazed and your girl will be too!!!!,UNK
605,"I was staying right by this place and then wlakwd by it on my way to the ces. The place is mellow w good music, and the food was good.  Had somosas roasted duck and satay, then fried rice and tom yum soup !!\nAll great stuff. Decent price.",UNK
606,"Kudos for having a separate vegetarian menu -- it made it really easy to order. The chopped salad I had was decent, though more like a poor man's version of Burmese tea leaf salad. Minus one star for charging four bucks for chips & salsa.",UNK
607,Terrible service! Half of the servers cannot understand English. Half of the plates are dirty and unclean. Half of the food is missing on the buffet line. Sorry to say I will not be returning to this location nor recommending it to anyone.,UNK
608,"Will not return!,,   The service is a joke around 15 min. To get our drinks food was so so. Watch when they bring your bill had to be sent back three times until they had the right total on it. Saved several dollars doing this have a feeling this happens often, just saying",UNK
609,Huge H&M in the middle of downtown. Very happy it finally came downtown after being in Rockland for so long. H&M has gorgeous stuff and they change their stock fairly often because every time I go I seem to find something else to buy. The beauty of the whole thing is that prices are great for the quality of things they have.,UNK
610,"Typical Hooters... Great wings and fries. Wings were excellent. We tried the honey wings. The burgers were dressed well but really bland. No season at all. Overall, a typical Hooters experience.",UNK
611,"Not enough employees at this location. Had to wait 30,min for an employee to assist me in the fabric department, if Hobby Lobby was open on Sundays I would have went there. Not my normal location.",UNK
612,"i will never go there again, terrible service that seems to avoid you or dread going to your table.was there with a couple of friends who are also around my age(18) and to be honest i dont always expect my standards to be exceeded but at least met.",UNK
613,"Large Portions, B+ Service. Clean.  Extensive Menu but ultimately underwhelming hotel  food.   Good if you are staying at the hotel but not a destination.",UNK
614,good beer selection- both on tap and in the beer cave. located in a nice neighborhood.  the chili cheese dog is fantastic and so are the fries!!,UNK
615,"Love squaw peak, 4 star rooms with a 5 star experience! good for a staycation, they'll bring you drinks while you float the lazy river. Plenty to keep the kids entertained as well.",UNK
616,wow has this place went down hill. the service and wait staff is an absolute joke. the food has went down hill. just horrible... horrible,UNK
617,"pretty good, service was great, but the food tasted different from the bennihannas in the bayarea becuase they dont have garlic butter???",UNK
618,"Clean Japanese place in KW. Great place to go with friends and get some decent sushi or meals when nearby downtown Kitchener. The place is a bit isolated from the rest of the downtown area, but I presume things will improve with recent developments in the area.",UNK
619,"Run...don't walk to these guys.  The service was over and above what I was expecting.  I am very thankful that I found Tech Mail.  Great service, great people and great prices.",UNK
620,We liked the food and thought the service was very good. It was also full of happy Asian people eating with their families. Usually a good sign at a Asian buffet.,UNK
621,"A very nice pizza.  I haven't made up my mind which is more authentic, NYPD or Ray's.  Both, have the thin NY style crust, but NYPD makes me feel like I'm waiting for an E train to Queens; whereas Ray's feels more upper east side-ish.",UNK
622,"I've been here several times since my first review, but just wanted to comment on the service. Mr. Silva is top notch, and was very accommodating. Food of course was excellent.",UNK
623,"This is one of my regular stops for breakfast. Normally a great breakfast joint but not today. The greeter wasn't friendly and the food was average. This place has been around for a long time with a good reputation. The kitchen needs to try harder and they need a friendly, happy greeter. It will be a while before I go back.",UNK
624,"I can't say I got to actually try the food or drinks. Came here with a group of friends. Apparently they are too cheap to hire a hostess to seat you. So we stood there with no service. Granted it was a busy time, but not a single employee walking by offered us anything.",UNK
625,The Wax Genie is my new waxer!  My Brazilian was so thorough yet surprisingly less painful than any waxing I have done before.  Definitely go and see her!,UNK
626,This place has really good Greek Food! I had the gyro w/ fries and started with the spinach artichoke dip. Everything is fresh and you can definitely tell in every bite!,UNK
627,"( I think I'm the last customer)  The tacos al pastor are loaded, I think they need a tad bit more seasoning,  tripas between soft and crunchy .... too bad they close at 1am",UNK
628,"Origin India is one of my favorite places to eat in Las Vegas!!! I always come back for the great food and the great service:) I can never remember what I order, but they always remember me and what I love to eat!!! Thanks guys!!!",UNK
629,"Great location, just a block from the strip.  I like that this is a more laid back hotel.  Love the beds and the room was clean and did not break the bank",UNK
630,"flavor less food.............\n\nif you just broke from playing around vegas, this is for you\n\nNOT FOR ME.........",UNK
631,This place is perfect for a quick bite while at the speedway. The brownie shakes & new french fries are delicious. Can be a bit pricey for lunch.,UNK
632,"Ok. Super good Wisconsin fair here. 150 local brews and great local food. Try the Gorgonzola salad with grilled salmon, the grilled cheese sandwich with bacon, or why grass feed beer burger. Best here. Add some Wisconsin fried cheese curds and we're in business!p",UNK
633,"Really poor service, really long waits, incredibly average food at a pretty absurd price. No free refills on soft drinks is always something that irks me as well.",UNK
634,Don't plan on drinking at drink and drag!   It's the slowest bar staff in the city!!!   30 minutes plus just to get a beer and it's not like they are even close to being busy! These bar queens are really a drag!   Just be prepared for a sober night if u go!!!!,UNK
635,So good!! So worth the value. Will be back here again for sure! Finally found the best kbbq in vegas! Wooohoo!,UNK
636,"Delicious Polish food, just like Grandma used to make (if at slightly higher prices)! Extensive meat/grocery selection, as well as frozen pierogis, homemade sauerkraut, and cute Polish tchotchkes to take home. Whenever I'm craving comfort food in Pittsburgh, I'll know where to come.",UNK
637,Menu was confusing. probably will try the other ramen spot next just to compare. Spicy options are limited. Gyoza's weren't that good. Ramen was mediocre at best.,UNK
638,Neighborhood delivery and takeout great....certainly a step higher than the other chains in this level.\nThey don't biast 30,UNK
639,This is your standard Mexican restaurant serving a standard American audience. It is extremely cheap given it is in an off the strip casino.\n\nThere really isn't any reason to eat here unless you are at the Tuscany and do not want to travel anywhere else for food.,UNK
640,"As far as Cirque shows go, this one wasn't that great. See Love instead. I found this stage very boring since it was not in the middle of the room like others.",UNK
641,"Though the name sounds healthy, about 99.5% of the stuff on the menu is near or more than 1000 calories. Sodium is very high so beware.",UNK
642,"Their seafood salad is really good. Guiltless and  yummy! Can't go wrong with that. I wish they used the extra room more, its so needlessly congested and cramped in there.",UNK
643,"a great alternative when u get tired of being gouged for price. we typically don't eat chan restaurants but outback is our only exception. as usual food quality was great. service is always good however, Douglas was one the best of the various outbacks that we have experienced. great Job Douglas!",UNK
644,"This scenic and well-kempt oasis amid the sprawling Phoenix metro is a great venue for an early morning jog or a leisurely hike. I'm not a cyclist, but the bike trails looked like they'd be a lot of fun too. Plus it's just a short climb to a great panorama of downtown Phoenix.",UNK
645,It's is the place for sushi in Tempe and south Phoenix. It's priced fair and the fish is so fresh. This is the only place I suggest for sushi in this corner of phoenix.,UNK
646,"Went here thinking we could get cheap yummy mexican. The only thing that was cheap was the quality of the food. Same prices as the other Mexican restaurants I like much better. Drive to Ajo Als,or El Encanto instead.",UNK
647,I am not impressed with the slow service... Forgot my order... I ordered the breakfast burrito. Not a lot of flavors. Diablo salsa just ok.,UNK
648,"The windy city at it's most austere. No traveller who alights here could feel \""welcome to Edinburgh\"". Those who can would be better to stay on the train until Waverley.",UNK
649,"Overpriced,small portions, and bland.  Need I say more?\n\nI have eaten at much better sushi restaurants for much less!  Stay away! Do yourself a favor .",UNK
650,"Nice airport. Easy navigating. I like their set up. Clean and friendly. Slot machines, incase you can't get started soon enough or maybe you didn't get enough, either way they are there. Very large duty free store. Nice selections inside. Restaurant selection is okay. Nothing to rave about.",UNK
651,Do not go here if you want quick service.  I dropped my dry cleaning off on a Wednesday and was told it would be done by Friday.  When I went in on Friday morning he said it was not done yet and wouldn't be done until after 2pm.  Also very over priced.,UNK
652,"This place is saved by the salsas for the chips. Again lame tacos in the traditional non-mexican style. Nice patio to sit and relax, but they should train better their waitress.",UNK
653,"my wife was not feeling well so we ordered to take out. They were so accomodating and friendly and willing to help me order.\nThe food was memorable and I go back often. Priced right, not flashy...give this one a try",UNK
654,Placed my order 52 minutes ago and still waiting.  I called and they said they got behind and it was on the way.  That was 10 minutes ago.  This is freaky fast?!?,UNK
655,The only good thing about this place is that it's open later then usually places and there's happy hour. Don't eat their food or expect good customer service.,UNK
656,"This is a nice little cozy place just off the side of some craps tables near the cashier.\n\nThere was one waitress for the whole area, and she did a great job, but its really nothing more than a little outcrop.",UNK
657,definitely overpriced! chicken noodle soup was $8 and it was all broth..da burger wit little fries was $15. da only reason we ate here was because its close to our room since we stayed @ bellagio and it was 5 am and we wer drunk & hungry.,UNK
658,Had a cheesesteak from here over the weekend and although it could have had a little more meat it was pretty tasty. I am particular about my cheesesteaks and the fact that I loved it made me want to leave my first review ever. Disappointed by the bad reviews.,UNK
659,I went for UK Thursdays and had a blast.  If there hadn't been a shooting and stabbing at PHX (stay classy people) we could have partied here all night.,UNK
660,"Love this place - it's perfect in what it is trying to be - a place that has fresh food with a Mediterranean flair - husband and I have this on our list of answers when the question \""what are you in the mood for\"" hits and we don't have plans - fast, great ingredients and delicious -",UNK
661,"I got the three fish and three shrimp the last week. (Fired)  Shrimp was ok, fish was really good. Today we got two of the three fish meals, was over cooked. Not sure if we will go again. Both times the meals were take out.",UNK
662,They dont care unless u order some over priced shit. Cheesy place.. waited 45 mins for couple sashimi to start.,UNK
663,"First time here and I am really happy about this find. The shop is small, only one chair, but she is efficient and did a great job on my hair. Not your wham bam hack job barber shop... This lady is legit. Good value too! \n\nI will defiantly be back.",UNK
664,"Large selection of menswear certainly. Hard to look through it all but great brands including Belk's own ProTour and Cam Newton's made. Belk days sale is a great value with lots of buy one get two free. Rewards program, flyer, text offers all can add discounts. Terrific value here.",UNK
665,Nice 'n clean! Great air conditioning! They have Eggs Benedict! ...but sadly...the poached eggs were a little overcooked!,UNK
666,Went to BWW this weekend since we had a gift card. While the service was great the food was not. Flatbread was awful and the wings were just ok.,UNK
667,This is a great all spot for food at happy hour ( 12am) that's the one I go  to. Don't know when it ends though. Service is iffy sometimes. But when its half off everything. But steak and fish. You can't really go wrong.,UNK
668,"Reasonable decent, nothing bad, but nothing that was outstanding. I used a Groupon so really hard to complain about the price.  Normal price $43.95 is a reasonable value if you are hungry. Nice location for those staying central strip. There at least two other Portuguese Radizio places in town which I think are better",UNK
669,"Wanted to try this place but the whole restaurant and wait line is very disorganized.  The front door is the back door, there's a line for take out, not to mention the hostess is very rude!   So many other places to go so moving on...",UNK
670,"Me and my buds come to Freddy's often and are NEVER disappointed! We love the service and the burgers! I got to recommend the California Burger. I really stress that you give Freddy's a try, it is probably the best chain restaurant in Surprise!",UNK
671,An absolute gem of a place! I'm glad I stopped by after walking past it so many times. If you like fish then this is the place to visit. Lovely good and lovely staff! Highly recommend it.\n\nhttp://smgdesigns.co.uk,UNK
672,1. A worker in the food court tried pulling a fast one by keeping my credit card and giving me another plastic card.                                                              2. Blood on my clean towel\n3. No cofee in our room.                            4. No refrigerator in room.,UNK
673,Wow does this place suck. The menu is solo mixed its hardly even a Greek restauraunt. I ate 4 chicken wings and some gyros and got the craps and the worst stomach ache I've ever had.,UNK
674,"This place is great for events and big groups, within walking distance to ASU, their Margs are some of the best in AZ, food is great, and because of the size you can normally get in without a wait.  Very good place pre and post football games and to watch sports.",UNK
675,Horrible experience. Bacon...cold and old.  Pancakes dense and hard.  Potatoes deep fried and extremely salty. Please go somewhere else. Their food is NOT good.,UNK
676,"I used to love the Mirage pool, but lately there seem to be an overabundance of fat slobs hanging out there.  Their cocktail pool girls used to be HOT, sadly no longer.  I'm not sure how you freshen up a pool and re-invent it, but it's time!",UNK
677,"We went during spring break on Monday and found out that it was dollar games and dollar shoe rentals, (GREAT DEAL), This place was clean, Mason was awesome.  And for a bowling alley, it wasn't too loud.  The only downfall was the lane servers weren't the friendliest and took forever to come by.",UNK
678,"If you like mussels, this place will do ;) 3 pages of different mussel dishes, a full beer menu + it's been around for long enough that you know no one has ever been poisoned here (which is the first thing I look for in a mussel restaurant).",UNK
679,"meh..the food was okay - I had grilled Mahi Mahi.  I didn't sit in the party bar section, so I may have been more entertained if I was there, but I didn't find anything to get excited over at Kahunaville...More like a 2.5 stars.",UNK
680,"This is hands down the worst sushi I have eaten. The selection is poor, and at any given time half the dishes are empty. I felt ill the rest of the day after eating here. Needless to say, my husband and I will not return. There are many other options in Vegas, do yourself a favor and skip this place!",UNK
681,"I've been through here a few times, but not in a few years aside from a recent connection. All was well for the most part, although there is inadequate seating in many of the gate areas, so lots of people end up on the floor or standing. There are also tons of slot machines in the airport, which is a unique touch.",UNK
682,Some of the Best Gyros around town. I have been coming here for 2 years now. They have good customer service and it doesn't take long to get your food. Chick it out!!!,UNK
683,"Built web site, mobile app and some social media.  Very helpful and professional.  Getting good traffic with the SEO package and some new business conversions for us already.  Feels good to be making money again. Thanks",UNK
684,Eh.   Ok.  The actual restaurant is very loud and service is mediocre at best.  \n\nI was looking forward to this place because of the great menu but once I was there it was underwhelming.  \n\nSkip it and eat somewhere else.,UNK
685,"Unfortunately, I only realized near the end of our meal that this place was horribly filthy. I most definitely will never go back.",UNK
686,"I love IKEA!  I love that you get decent quality items for a low cost.  I love that you can park your butt in the cafe and have a decent or sometimes really good meal for a little money.  I love the furniture and textiles offered.  I love the organizational items.  Heck, I just love every moment that I am there.",UNK
687,"It's cheap, it's clean but slow as molasses. I've been waiting for 40 minutes to leave the airport and our driver is outside speaking to a colleague. I wish they could figure out their issues some other time.\n\n(This is based on an experience in January 2013, during CES)",UNK
688,Very bland food with hardly any seasoning. The waitress was very rude to us and it took ages for someone to take our order. Beer was good.,UNK
689,"Keep hearing great stuff about this place.  So, today I am going.   I will see if I have to change by review after I eat there,\n\nMade it there and it was worth it.  Great fish and chips and peppersauce burger for the son.  We will be back.",UNK
690,"The breakfast here sucks and is freaking nasty so i will give it 1 star. On the other hand i do enjoy their lunch and dinner. This is a upscale version of hometown buffet and that is what you should expect. 3 stars for lunch/dinner so overall, 2 stars.",UNK
691,Ok I admit their burgers are very good. But is it really really worth waiting 45 mins for a table for a $11.00 burger not including fries or drinks? oh I forgot the tips too. I think I'll stick to In-and-Out.,UNK
692,"Above avg quick cafe. We usually stay at the Bellagio and end up eating here twice a trip. I haven't had anything that I absolutely love and never had anything that I hated. What you see is what you get. Nothing great, everything avg and above. Take a look at the menu before you go in.",UNK
693,Enjoyed dinner for the taste and ambience. Small and cozy. Enjoyed watching chef and helpers prepare the dishes. Brie tart was great!,UNK
694,"Talk about deja vu. This place reminds me so much of the Nugget in Reno. It's old, has bad services and there's not a lot of games or slots in the casino. Definitely not going to stay here again. Two thumbs down.",UNK
695,"One of the best local places, they serve big and juicy pieces! And not to mention their fries! They might be a bit thin but they're really good and taste fresh.",UNK
696,Pizza ok on it's own nothing great . Definitely not worth the restaurant price.  definitely not like pizzeria UNO in Chicago. Are they even related   or are they just using their name and trademark.,UNK
697,I was stocked when this place first opened.  Yeah at first they had a few things to sort out but for this far off the strip its very consistent.  Fridays and Saturdays are always the busiest!  \n  My favorite is the ribs and brisket.  The sides are good and off course there is always room for desert.,UNK
698,Chicken and Waffles to die for. The food takes a while to come out but it's cooked to order and well worth the wait.,UNK
699,We had a positive experience at Michael Mina. We were looking for a good place that had great food and atmosphere and Michaels was the perfect find. The service was excellent and the food was great. Thank you.,UNK
700,"Tasty fresh bread, friendly people, and cupcakes -- what could be better? The rye bread I got here was especially delicious. Be aware that they tend to run out of most things by the end of the day.",UNK
701,"Not a great place. Food wasn't good and service kind of sucked! Told the waiter that the food was horrible and all he said was, \""So You're Done?\"". Will not go back!",UNK
702,Came in here after a long night on the strip. I lost me cell phone and needed a replacement. The staff was very knowlegable and helped me call Sprint to get a discount on my lost phone.\n\nDefinite find.,UNK
703,Southern scramble was very tasty! I'll be doing this at home now. Grits were buttery. Great service!,UNK
704,"5 stars for sure!, this place has the best 'char siew' in town.  It's lean and just enough sauce without drowning it like most other places make the mistake of doing.",UNK
705,Seriously my new favorite coffee spot. Got a growler of the Toddy and I almost drank it all in one day. Very affordable and the atmosphere is amazing.,UNK
706,"Best sandwiches anywhere! Everything is made fresh and is outstanding. My favorite is the Turkey, Bacon, Avocado ....amazing! Even the sides are made fresh daily. The potatoes salad is out of this world good!\nYou got to try this place!",UNK
707,"Good donuts, definitely not the best donuts around. They hit the spot in the morning for sure!\n\nstay away from the coffee, it's wack",UNK
708,"Not bad.  A little disappointed with portion sizes.  Great chagrin over the final tab - paid more than we felt it was worth.  Service was pretty good if you can get past this waitress's really shrill voice.  Again, not bad, but far from great.  Wouldn't hurry back.",UNK
709,"Disgusting! Do not stay here!\n\nIt was very clear the room they put us in was not clean. The sheets were filthy and stained. \n\nIf everything else in the area is booked, do yourself a favor, go somewhere else.",UNK
710,"Nice employees, Salad Bar is good Deserts are ok but damn for almost $12.00 I could have had a better meal at Denny's which is where I will go next time I think I want to eat here.",UNK
711,"Avoid!  Like the other reviews stated, food is so so at best.  The staff was slow, and didn't ask us why we only ate a few bites out of each of our meals.  Really sad to be quite honest.",UNK
712,"I have been going here for 10+ years! This place keeps on changing, but its always the first mall I go to when visiting the area!",UNK
713,"We are very pleased with our new patio security door. We now only wish we had done it sooner. The entire process was professional, including the installation.",UNK
714,"First off, the waiter we had was hands down one of the best servers I've ever had! We were seated fairly quickly and the food was good, pretty much on par with your average Red Lobster. The restaraunt could have been a little cleaner, which is why it gets 4 stars instead of 5.",UNK
715,"After amazing sushi we met the owner/sushi chef Richard, best I've had in Arizona!  Looking forward to Blu opening in North Scottsdale....best wishes to your new venture!",UNK
716,"My husband and I clearly ordered incorrectly here.  We had the cheese fondue, not particularly hot or very tasty.  The salad that came with it was mediocre.  However, service was personable and the crepes did LOOK wonderful!",UNK
717,"Good food, tastes close enough to the real Filipino cooking at home.  The staff lacks warmth and charisma, specially the lady at the cash register who seems to be annoyed that her dinner was interrupted by a paying clientele.  This attitude will certainly not create good will towards repeat customers.   Will not visit the place again even though the fare is fantastic.",UNK
718,We had a work function here in September. The food was pretty good and the service was friendly but it was SLOOOOOOW. I know we had a party of around 20-25 people but don't you guys plan for that? Some of our people had to leave prior to dessert because it was getting so late.,UNK
719,"Love this store!  Don't always have much luck with the sales, but I always find something I like here.  This isn't your average Marshall's or TJ Max.  I think the green dress I'm wearing is from Filene's!",UNK
720,One of my favorite places to eat in Uptown. My go to dishes are the London broil entree and the what it is. Tried out most of the menu and can't say I've had anything bad. The daily specials are usually pretty great as well.,UNK
721,"They don't even tell you that it's your responsibility to take a bag of chips with your take out order, so people walk out all the time paying for chips they don't get? No more of this place.",UNK
722,I definitely recommend this place to everyone. Food is great (big portions) and good prices. Very clean. Staff is very friendly. I will go back...soon!!,UNK
723,"I found this salon online prior to coming to Vegas and my girlfriend and I decided to come here based on the reviews we had read. This was our first stop as soon as we arrived in Vegas. We LOVED this place. The salon was clean, staff was friendly and the services were phenomenal! Highly recommend this salon.",UNK
724,"I ordered chicken shawarma and was cold, and without seasoning.  I told the server that the Shawarma was so could and she microwaved it!!!!  The place was noisy. The owner was singing!!",UNK
725,Service sucks!\nFood inedible!\nWorst\nBuffet \nEver!!!,UNK
726,Love the VIg! Great food and atmosphere! Its a great mixed crowd and I love the live bands on Sundays! Awesome patio!,UNK
727,We went in for some breakfast after a late night. Waited for ten minutes for anyone to talk to us. Walked around the corner to find the waitress asleep. Take a nap before you come to work!,UNK
728,Best sushi/sashimi we have had in recent years.  Very fresh!  It was a nice day so we chose to sit outside.  Street noise wasn't a problem and couldn't have asked for better service.  We will definitely be back.,UNK
729,"For a cheaper price, they have a larger selection than many other asian buffet places but the quality in some of their food isn't there.  I found hair in the food.  On the plus side, they have good char sui.",UNK
730,"This 7-Eleven is on my way to work. I have stopped in a couple of times to get a Red Bull or other convenience item. It's in a pretty bad neighborhood, and I always feel kinda scared going in.",UNK
731,"A good place for fastfood type of Japanese food. They are friendly and helpful. Even the owners are not Japanese, they do know how to make you feel like eating in a Japanese place.",UNK
732,"Very good Indian food, with lots of veg options.  Absolutely delicious naan and their paneer is some of the best I've had.  Yummy mango lassi, though more sour than I'm used to.\n\nSolidly recommended!",UNK
733,"Very disappointed after a recent visit.  From the get go, the woman who waited on me was totally rude.  Then to top it all off she went off on a group of women who had their children with them.  Guess it is not a child friendly place like I had hoped!",UNK
734,Cool local brewry and beer joint.  Makes a great wheat beer.  Food is good and atmosphere is what you would expect in a pub/bar.,UNK
735,The food is slightly above average. The perceived value is poor. $10.00 for 3 mini tacos and undercooked steak fries. I won't be back.,UNK
736,"Had my very first hard wax brazillian here. Practically painless compared to the soft wax i am used to getting. However, i did feel like the hair grew back faster and i had few that was left unnoticed. boo.. But overall, Great price and great service!",UNK
737,I really think this place should be more like 4 1/2 stars. Your horchata is delicious as  is the watermelon lemonade. I really enjoyed the burger and the beef taco but a few of the other tacos were only ok. The place was very small! Be warned don't take a massive group!,UNK
738,"Went through the car wash and asked the guy to take care of a one detail (behind the rearview glass) and he declined to do so. Note that I was also standing there asking him with a \""tip\"" in hand. \n\nI can now see why this place has a plethora or 1 or 2 stars.",UNK
739,"This used to be our go to spot for dining when we had people in from out of town. Cute atmosphere, outdoor seating when weather permits, free valet parking, great menu with something for everyone, seasonal menus and affordable prices. I miss it . . .",UNK
740,"Mediocre. Had 3 tacos for lunch...Paco, Country Fried and Fish. I've been mouthfarting ever since. Hopefully it stops soon. In all fairness, it's my fault for ordering fish, country fried steak and taco meat. Who does that?!",UNK
741,Server wasn't good. Dropped a sushi plate and didn't refill our water.  But the sushi was good.  Get the ultimate shrimp tempura and ask for the tuna raw instead of seared.  By far the best one we ordered between 8 rolls and everyone agreed.,UNK
742,"Best gym in Las Vegas! A bit pricey but with all the amenities and loads of free classes that come along with the membership the price quickly becomes very understanding. If your looking for an elite gym, look no more. Lifetime has created a facility which is second to none. Come down and talk to Bobby, tell him TJ sent you",UNK
743,"Great happy hour food, good atmosphere and if you get the bug to play the ponies, just mosey on over.  I was disappointed that since my last visit they got rid of two of my favorite beers",UNK
744,"The cream Italian ice is amazing. I love the chocolate chip cookie dough and mint chocolate chip. It tastes like ice cream but lighter, seriously amazing. I normally get the gelati which is layered custard, Italian ice & custard.",UNK
745,"Sometime the bum is not crunchy and the spicy flavor is not enough. i am not sure if it is because of different people making it or the equipments were not stable. So i got some surprises once in a while, not a big deal.",UNK
746,My boyfriend and I come here all the time and sometimes we get good service we had Taylor she is by far the best server we have had there I love their breakfast here their dinner menu is ok they changed some stuff like instead of fresh veggies they use canned I was disappointed when I ordered the lemon chicken.,UNK
747,Amended review... I still love their food but kind of annoyed by how many employees the have standing around doing nothing while they only have one person taking orders. Every time. Dear manager: you have two registers... Please use them.  Sincerely yours... The customer.,UNK
748,"Had a great Valentine's dinner during our stay in Phoenix. This is a favorite of our friends' who live in Phoenix and they were right on! Great margaritas, salmon tacos, and swordfish entree. Very attentive staff.",UNK

750,"Very, very busy & crowded but fun.  Had an absolutely perfect meal, best Friday night fish fry dinner of my life.  Be prepared to wait for a table, it will be worth your time!",UNK
751,"This is a nice little lunch place in Kierland.  I had a mixed greens salad with chopped dates, nice touch.  I need to try several more dishes to make a more accurate review.  I will be back.",UNK
752,Was looking for a great steak dinner with all the fixings and I found it.  Would have given 5 stars but the plate my steak came out on was so HOT I burned my finger..left a mark. So unnecessary!!!,UNK
753,Awesome place! Very clean! I had a mani and pedi with a complimentary neck and shoulder rub! Unexpected but I loved it! Friendly and accommodating staff. We have been here 7 years and never have I received excellent service like this in Vegas before. I wish I came here sooner.,UNK
754,Great happy hour place with a friendly staff and live music.  The salsa was pretty decent  (remember this is a Texas girl reviewing) and the nachos were fully customizable.  Drinks were served cold and quickly.,UNK
755,"There truly are no words to describe the awesome navigational reading I received from Jim.  He was spot on with everything he told me, especially regarding my life path and where it has been leading me.\n\nBeyond Jim's great talents, he is a sincere and caring person with a real heart for helping others along their journeys.",UNK
756,i've been to several Changs.  Left my work credit card here by mistake.  Manager said she would Fedex it to me on Monday.  \n\nIf it arrives - going to a 5 star!,UNK
757,The food is legit.  Probably the best non chain Chinese restaurant in Gilbert. Garlic green beans are great. Service is good but is real laid back.,UNK
758,I Really dont understand why some people are so crazy about this place..its pretty eek if you ask me...Im a teriyak fan so I gave it a try...and umm..yeah no. I per fer Teriyaki Stop,UNK
759,"Food tastes alright but it's certainly not authentic. Dishes were drenched in sauce, egg rolls taste frozen. Only positive note is that it is a very clean establishment with polite service.",UNK
760,"Tried this location a few times now and they seem to be well staffed, which I really appreciate - food served pretty quickly. Plus, we were happy to find that not only are the subs great but salads are also good, especially for a sub place. Would give it a 5 but they messed up one of our orders.",UNK
761,Going on day 3 of my poisoning from this dump. I haven't eaten anything since my cold watery fire grilled steak tacos Tuesday.  No answer or ability to get calls returned from corporate.  Worst restaurant experience ever. Never eating Cafe Rio again.,UNK
762,I love this place!  So not a fan of their pizza but they have the best salads and awesome iced tea. Love sitting outside here. Great lunch spot!!  Great for take out. Oregano's is yummy.,UNK
763,"Overall, the place is nice. Much, MUCH bigger than you think and it's a LONG tour - wear comfortable shoes. But it's a very thorough presentation and it's very, very good. Lots of interactive kiosks and tons of videos help break up the wall/mural style presentations.",UNK
764,"A standard Petco, this shop has most of your pet's needs. They have a wide selection of supplies to choose from. But they are just a bit on the messy side especially during weekends. It gets crowded and there are lines to pay, but it tends to move pretty fast.",UNK
765,"Waited almost two hours for delivery on a Sunday night for an undercooked calzone paired with cold marinara sauce (must have just come out of the refrigerator). If you're going to take two hours, I expect good food.",UNK
766,"Worst service ever. Kept me waiting in the drive thru for 10 minutes when there were no customers, then no napkins in the bag, and an extra charge just to use a debit card. Worst KFC I've ever been to in my life.\n\n\nAVOID.",UNK
767,Atmosphere is great. Food is good. Especially the fried chicken. Service is horrible. Takes forever to get a drink and some of the waitresses seem to hate their job. Snobby attitudes and all around bad service. I will spend my money elsewhere until they retrain their staff.,UNK
768,This place was too hyped up for me. Not perfect. I had better barbecue elsewhere but it's as good as gets in Illinois. I would recommend the pulled pork and briskets. Get there early for the burnt tips and to avoid the lines! The line does form quickly in this small place.,UNK
769,"Nami goodness for $5.  Chai tsunami, O ginger snap, rocky road and Coffee Coco Loco are all pretty phenomenal. Great for those that are lactose intolerant. Tastes light. These treats are tasty even when melted from the summer heat. Parking is limited.",UNK
770,Ordered to go and our food was ready in no time! I love their wings and onion rings! Had the left overs the next morning. Tasted so good that I wanted more for lunch. Plus they are open 24/7. Awesome!,UNK
771,I love this movie. Clean. Friendly. Management is always on their employees about customer service. They are a bit pricey but worth it. I always go an hour early because the theatre gets busy quick. Love the shopping and food around it. Always clean and on time. Awesome experience,UNK
772,24 hour Korean food! Oh yeah!\n\nMuch better service and food than nearby Kimchi Restaurant. Yukgaejang hits the spot after a long day of drinking. Wife really likes the dolsot bibimbap too. \n\nWe stop by this place every time we're in Vegas.,UNK
773,Love this place! Best chocolate shakes ever! Very friendly staff and great food ! I love supporting small businesses and this couple does it right!,UNK
774,"This place is ok, could be a lot better.  But they did give me a ton of Boba, they aren't chincy with the ingredients.  Just my slushy was way to watery, not much slush.",UNK
775,Had a restaurant.com coupon so did not pay full price as others.  My wife and I really enjoyed our burgers.  I had the bleu cheese and my wife had just a cheeseburger.  Both were cooked perfectly to order and extremely tasty.  Fries were the only reason to lose a star as they were ho-hum.,UNK
776,Francisco is awesome! Best mixologist:) all tapas and entrees are delist! Try chicken lollipops & bacon okra.,UNK
777,"The food was great.  So was the service.  The building is cool, as is the bar.  We won't go back. The music ruins it.  Bad call guys.",UNK
778,Got tricked into coming here. Good thing I didn't pay a penny to get in because if I did I would be pretty mad. Place was dead. No one. Prob won't come back here. I got free entry tho!!! Yay me...,UNK
779,"Very small parking area! It get's super busy on the weekend and because the parking isn't great, it become a war zone :-(",UNK
780,Really original and delicious sushi. I was blown away by all the delicious and imaginative flavors and textures. Definitely not your average sushi bar. Highly recommended!!!,UNK
781,Had a very disappointing breakfast. The french toast actually comes with toast. Really? The French toast and bacon came out cold. This is more of a coffee place is a breakfast place.,UNK
782,"Absolutely love the vibrant colors and art at this hotel. Our room was clean and comfortable, not to mention fun! I just found a new favorite place to stay in Scottsdale.",UNK
783,"Love the pizza, pasta and yummy desserts!  Service is always fantastic!! Great lunch specials make this an easy pick over a drive through and a number 3!!",UNK
784,"If you like beige, off-white, oyster, etc.  then you're just going to love the changes Restoration Hardware have done to their stores.  UGH!\n\nI know the human eye can discern several shades of gray, but this is ridiculous!",UNK
785,Dont go for the food.  There are so many good places to eat in Pittsburgh.  Had the burger...awful and the coleslaw was warm and tasteless,UNK
786,"I sent my 18 year old college student daughter here for a procedure.  The doctors and nurses were mean, and insulting.  I would not recommend this facility.  He denegrated ASU'S academic reputation and made inappropriate comments to her.",UNK
787,"Average burger, old fries, and a sad excuse of a milkshake. \n\nAlthough the restaurant was super slow, the store was very dirty and the employees didn't even bother with it as they preferred to help themselves to free drinks as they conversed amongst themselves.",UNK
788,Good sushi. Great atmosphere and attention to detail with everything from the cups to soy sauce bottles. One of my new favorite spots on Green St!\n\nThe one issue is that it's tiny so there may be a wait.,UNK
789,"It's a chain, so I know the food is decent. I'm mostly turned off by the fact that I couldn't come here to watch a baseball game. No sports package at a popular burger place? I'll be going elsewhere for dinner.",UNK
790,My wife and I are regulars at Chez Vous and we had another 5-star experience at this wonderful French Creperie today.  The cusine is wonderful the owners and staff are always very hospitable and friendly. We enjoy supporting them and have always had a 5 star experience.,UNK
791,The food is great! I can eat at this place over and over again. Great Pad Thai and Cashew Chicken! Consistently very good.,UNK
792,"Denny's.....slow service, ok food....expensive prices....but cheaper than a fine dining experience.....I won't be back.....I'm a foodie, and I prefer to spoil myself on places like N9NE",UNK
793,"Our server,  Katrina,  made our Sunday Funday better than expected! ! We had such a good time!\n And then, shift changed,  and the new bartender was totally rude, and we are leaving. (Asian Chic, Sunday afternoon).",UNK

795,"This was our first stay at Treasure Island. The room was nice, bed comfy. Casino was nice not too large. Staff was great and they checked your room key before you can take the elevator to your rooms. Food was good and the two for one buffet coupons were awesome.",UNK
796,A favorite restaurant with the same quality as the Mt. Lebanon location. Great pizza and wine bar. One of the best restaurants in downtown.,UNK
797,"this location is Not closed..i dont know why it says it is, you also cannot check in here..but go anyways, you really cant beat the pollo here.",UNK
798,"I went here to get a pair jeans shortened.  Not the biggest of tasks.  Not only was the woman working there not very polite, but they took a week for the alterations.  That seems like a pretty long time just to alter one pair of jeans.",UNK
799,"We had exceptional food, great ambiance, a wonderful waitress, and all for super reasonable prices! Their beer list is as extensive as you would think, and they seem knowledgeable about it, which is an extra plus. It was a simply excellent experience!",UNK
800,"Do you enjoy being treated like sh!t?  Do you like it when a greasy illiterate \""maitre 'd\"" insults you?  If so the Italian Ghetto is for you.",UNK
801,"Food was amazing portions were great,  waiters were awesome only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the hostesses were very rude it's a very busy place so you'd expect them to be able to be professional and nice to there customers no matter what is going on",UNK
802,Friendly service. They were spot on with the special requests I asked with my order. They made sure to offer sauces and did no ice in my drink per my request. The food came out quick. What more could I ask from Taco Bell,UNK
803,I ordered the crispy salmon dish on a blended pea sauce.  The blended pea sauce was actually refreshing.  The salmon on the other hand was nothing to rave about.,UNK
804,Excellent efficient service!  Love the fact that I didn't have to go anywhere to get my cars to look so amazing.  Thanks Cloud 9 for the an awesome job.,UNK
805,Had a lot of fun! place was packed with some kind of cheerleading thing. Only waited 5 mins for a lane. That was cool with the amount of people that was there. A lot of the kids are unsupervised so ... you know how kids can get.,UNK
806,"Meh.  Overpriced, mediocre food and drinks. Staff is rude.  Many rave about this place.  Why?  The one star for the outdoor decor.",UNK
807,Wow. Food is great. Service was great. I really enjoyed dinner here. My only complaint I the smoke from the bar next door blows into the dining area.,UNK
808,"More like an 2.7. Service was a bit slow but there was a large party eating when I got there. It was kind of warm inside, bordering on uncomfortable. \nI had the falafel plate and an order of fries. The hummus was good, fries limp and falafel bland.",UNK
809,Orchids serves dim sum all day. It was a disappointment. We were there around 8 pm.  Everything we had was cold and old. They should just stick with dim sum in the afternoon just like other dim sum restaurants.,UNK
810,"No customer service. There was one employee handling the ink department/register, one person handling the print shop/register, and two employee wanderers. I and a young lady behind me took turns waiting in both lines hoping to be helped. Everyone managed to effectively ignore us for 15 minutes before I gave up. No one teaches customer service anymore!",UNK
811,"The food is okay, though pricey. They know they are one of few choices for a resort, and the service reflects it. They wait staff could really care less.",UNK
812,All I can say is that this place is terrible. Service was horrendous to the point of our waiter making fun of our friend who had a receading hairline. Food was mediocre at best. Only good thing about this place is cheap beer you can get for cheaper at a supermarket.,UNK
813,"Cool atmosphere, great service, okay food...\n\nI had the Sonoran Dog.  The flavor wasn't outstanding, just okay.  I would definitely go here again because they had some other interesting things on the menu.",UNK
814,"Total disappointment!!  Expensive, stale and a long wait.\nDon't waste your time and money!!",UNK
815,Two words. Smoke everywhere. . The rooms smell like smoke. They leave ash trays everywhere for anyone to smoke.  Everyone smokes outside their rooms. My son who has asthma could hardly play in the pool because everyone smoked right in the pool. . It was  disgusting!,UNK
816,"This place can't get an order right. They gave me another free meal for screwing thing up and then screwed that meal up again. Big Mac meal.... no pickle, no center bun. How hard is that?",UNK
817,Came out of a show hungry it wasn't crowed on the patio so seemed like a good place who could mess up Mexican food.  Worst over priced dinner I have ever had. Canned beans chicken was tasteless and dry. My friends order was dry meat with awful sauce. TERRIBLE so bad I couldn't eat my food.,UNK
818,Had a business dinner at this place and it under whelmed.  My wife had spines in her fish (many).  Joe and Mario need to overhaul this place.,UNK
819,Worst hotel. TV in my room is from the 90's and makes a radiating noise. They call this room a suite....,UNK
820,"Rosewood was decent. Decor is very cool, location is great, but the food was quite simple. Yes, prices were equivalent, but when you order a salad, you expect more than 5% of toppings over romaine lettuce.",UNK
821,"This company came highly recommended, and lived up to their reputation. They were prompt in arriving and their technicians were experienced, courteous and thorough. Their prices for repair and service are very reasonable. \nThank you",UNK
822,"My husband absolutely loved the veal that they serve here.  I had the Tortellini Portabello . It was decent , but nothing out of this world. The crusted goat cheese salad was very tasty. The service was really good too. Not a bad spot to go, just not top of the list.",UNK
823,Service was good. It took over 40 minutes to get the food.  The salmon was not very good and the talapia was very plain. One and only time we will go here.,UNK
824,Love this place! Took my daughter to get her first hair cut. Super cute shop. Had toys and movies for the kids to watch. Not to mention the awesome cars they get to sit in while getting their hair cut! Friendly staff as well:) we will be back!,UNK
825,"Food is good, cookies are great. Buy one cookie and get one free. Bargain. I love the half sandwich and soup. The chicken posole is delicious and a favorite of mine. A great plus is there is free wireless internet service.",UNK
826,Pho is ok. Fried rice was dry. Spring rolls was great! Don't order extra lime they charge $1 and don't tell u.,UNK
827,"Perfectly fine for a 5a7 (happy hour), but nothing that special about it. Typical pub range of beer and liquor.",UNK
828,"Non-stop trivia weekend in Vegas necessitates lots of caffeine. Luckily we found this Starbucks near the suites where we were doing the quiz bowl rounds, rather than having to walk all the way back to the food court.",UNK
829,"I took my wife to Sea Saw for Valentines day.  There is absolutely NO ambiance, the food was mediocre, and the prices was exorbitant.  The service, was, however acceptable.\nAll in all it was a very very disappointing experience.",UNK
830,"You can't go wrong with this place. Anything you order will melt your heart and have you wishing you lived near this bakery. Sometimes there is a line and nowhere to sit but who cares. Learn to be patient , walk to the nearest park and enjoy bliss.",UNK
831,"My bf recommended this place cause he used to go here back when he was in high school, he remembered it being good. \nWe came here and I got the milk tea and him the Choco slush. Unfortunately, the bf and I were fairly disappointed because both of them had an incredible powder taste.",UNK

834,"benny eggs... sauce was ok but it was missing the \""umph\""\n\npotatos were yummy",UNK
835,Disappointed.  I was expecting better tasting food.  Calamari was chewy.  Seafood linguine lacked flavor.  Short ribs were good but a little salty.  Great service though.,UNK

837,"Out favorite breakfast place in Las Vegas. Wait for an outside table, get a Bellini, some coffee and the ham and cheese crepes. We always eat here when we come to Vegas.",UNK
838,"Absolutely love this place. The burger with peanut butter is my favorite burger anywhere, and the beer selection speaks to me. The bike-theme is icing on the cake. \n\nWish we had something exactly like this in Los Angeles...",UNK
839,"A decent hot dog joint. a meal with 2 hot dogs and fries is 5 bucks. Atmosphere is almost nonexistent. The hot dogs were good, the fries weren't bad. I will probably  not go back.",UNK
840,"While staying at the Monte Carlo I ate here at least 3 times. The food was fast, fresh and delicious. I didn't realize it was a chain. I wish there were some in Houston!",UNK
841,"It was nice to see something open in the storefront that has been vacant for years, but the store was so disappointing.  We went twice since it opened and didn't even feel tempted by anything in the whole store.",UNK
842,24 hours and walking distance from our room at the Palazzo. We went there multiple times to stock up on water and other necessities. Great place to go anytime. Beware- it is like NYC prices but I guess everything is in Vegas.,UNK

847,Good burgers and not cooked how you want but still taste good and good drinks at a decent price. Beware it's not a place meant for young people,UNK
848,"Not worth the $50. Sure is unlimited lobster, but the lobster doesn't even taste good. The meat was tough, and tasteless.  I actually had to throw one away because it smelled terrible, and old. The two star is for the desserts,  their tiramisu and gelato are  very good!",UNK
849,"Decided to venture into a new Pittsburgh neighborhood on this lovely Sunday. Ended up in Mt. Washington, a great little hood and home of Shiloh Grill. Had a Po' boy crab sandwich that was delicious. Friendly staff and cool vibe in a cool neck of the woods.",UNK

851,The best Pho soup we have had!!! People are very nice and friendly. Delicious fresh fruit smoothies. Awesome chicken wings!!!!!! Everybody who reads this must go to this place. Very delicious!!!,UNK
852,Food is decent. Serving time is mediocre at best. Bibimbap sauce literally redeemed my meal. Price is somewhat higher than expected.,UNK
853,Cool fast and not crowded. They don't like their job so they want to deal with you as little as possible but get you out the door quick.,UNK
854,"What's the problem? I love this place. Every time I come here, its never packed... employees are nice... and  there is always a place to sit and relax with your coffee.",UNK

858,"It's a fast food resturaunt.  The fact that the order taking process is confusing is not the fault of the store, but of the corporation.  Maybe they could fix that???\n\nOtherwise, they did a good job, got our order right, served in a good time.",UNK
859,"Hands down the best Nutritional Shop in Vegas! I just threw my GNC Card away after visiting these guys today. I found a new place, its like a kid being in a candy shop! Unbelievable prices!!!!",UNK
860,"Worst service ever! Don't waste your time at this location it sucks and the servers act like they are too cool and emo to serve with any sort of personality.. Food is always good but it's not even worth it , just go to a different location",UNK
861,Located inside Miracle Mile this place offers friendly service and the beer comes to you quick...the beer however is not the best...I'd say try a different brewery,UNK
862,Love this place! The food is to die for....my favs are lomo saltado and arroz mariscos...yummmm! I go to this restaurant every time I'm in town. During my last visit...I tried the Sangria..delicious!,UNK
863,"SOOOOO YUMMY. wings & pizza to go? YES, please!!!! I'll eat here every time I stay in vegas.",UNK
864,Delicious!!!!! They have the best Falafels in town and the hummus is great too! The services is great despite it being packed all the time. Seating is limited so I would recommend getting your food to go. I think they should expand!!!!!!,UNK
865,Nice atmosphere. Good food. I had the buffalo on some fluffy fantastic foccacia bread. It was awesome. A combo with a drink and chips came to $9. They have free wi-fi which makes working or using your iPhone a pleasure.,UNK
866,Never go to Just Brakes. Such bait and switch people. Ask them who comes in and gets a $99 brake job. Almost no one.,UNK
867,"The food and service is awful here!  Do not eat here if you want good food.  Go to Taco Bell, it is better food.",UNK
868,"Went for happy hour. The margaritas were large and well made. The nachos were ok, the bbq pork sandwich was good! Service was pretty good.",UNK
869,"Honestly I was not impressed. Pizza and salad were ok, but not delicious like you expect from a pizza place. Salad was pre-made and I had hoped for more.",UNK
870,Very cool atmosphere and good drinks. Only complaint is how PACKED it gets and it is a very small place. Definitely worth checking out though.,UNK
871,They kick ppls out of the line becoz we don't have enough ppls at the middle of the line. The servants have very bad attitude too.,UNK
872,"Went there late last night, probably some of the worst food I've ever had. On second thought, it was the worst. The only way it would have been worse is if the waiter came over and punched me in the face. The pizza was dough, the soup didn't have any flavor other than the thick starchy consistency. Very disappointed",UNK
873,Hmmm .... Actually I forget about this room.  Loved the ballys casino. It's got a good feel. Like the clubs here too.  But the room .... Forgetable.  This is the old Mgm grand where the fire happened!! Kinda cool if you dig Vegas history.,UNK
874,"Perfume in the ventilation system?! Oh god it is so horrific here.  My eyes started to water and I developed a mild headache after 30 minutes or so.  Some of the shopping is good for selection and uniquness of items, but oh dear it was expensive.",UNK
875,"These people are awesome.\nTip - if you're a GOLD member, go downstairs.  You'll wait upstairs for an hour!!!\nClean cars ready to go!",UNK
876,This location is horrible!  The Grind off of Camelback is a much better experience.  Quality of food AND customer service.  We will never go back!,UNK
877,"Brand new as of October 2014. Ideal location, easy walking distance to State street, the Capitol, and two scenic lake shores.  Service at the was outstanding. Complimentary breakfast was excellent. Spacious room and bathroom . Would stay there again.",UNK
878,Food sucks. We had the special. Took 1 hour to put some vegies on a plate and bring it out. Extremely overpriced. Not original at all. Aux Vivres or Panthere Verte in the plateau are much better options to try.,UNK
879,Not as good as it used to be... For the price range I'd go elsewhere. But not being a guest and just walking around is great! Inside is pretty,UNK
880,"Went here on the back of seeing this on the food network. went for brunch, I had the french onion burger and it was very good. I wouldn't be fan of seating upstairs as it was like been on a bouncing castle. All in all it was a very positive experience",UNK
881,Only reason for 2 stars is service. Food is over priced - even for Vegas. The cocktails are good but the descriptions are a little exaggerated. The portions are pretty small. Pork tacos were good but otherwise not with the money. Servers were good tho.,UNK
882,"Yummy Pan Roast! I came here after a late night of hitting the Vegas Clubs. And boy there was a wait. Ending up waiting an hour here but it was worth it. You sit the bar area and order your food. Honestly, the Pan Roast is all you need. The sauce was perfect.",UNK
883,"LOVE this place!!  They have everything authentic Italian you could want without being in Italy!  Got some Gouda, sopressata and olives. Always love visiting here when in town!",UNK
884,"The room was not real clean, I only slept there and showered, then left in the morning so it was a good place to crash. They gave free water which was nice of them.",UNK
885,"Check the expiration dates! This location is notorious for having expired stock. It's poorly staffed & the few times I've brought expired items up front, I've been confronted with staff that were not the least bit interested. I avoid shopping here.",UNK
886,"This place is disgusting, raw.fish sits for more than 30 mins. Terrible service. Will not be back. Please save your time and go to SUSHI YUKI on 83rd and Thunderbird.",UNK
887,A very nice store. the usual cashiers and bag boy  that ignore you and and make you feel like you are interupeding them.,UNK
888,"We ate lunch at Galianos and really enjoyed the experience. \n\nService was prompt, the setting was nice with the doors and windows open to the street.\n\nI enjoyed the lasagna and the bread was fresh.",UNK
889,This was my first time visitng Vegas and I have so much fun.  It was so hot to really enjoy yourself but the staff and hotel was great.  The rooms were comfortable and we had relaxing time.  I highly recommend staying here.,UNK
890,I met a friend for lunch today here for the first time. What an awesome lunch! The chicken pot pie is DELICIOUS!! Homemade everything!!,UNK
891,"I love my western Bacon cheeseburger but it has gone up in price. Also the drive thru is very slow and all the staff can hardly speak English. I once got 3 wbc with no burgers on them! Used to be a great place, but has gone downhill.",UNK
892,Macarons here are good but I've had better. They lack the chewiness in the middle (for some flavors) but maybe it was because I popped in so late in the afternoon. The one flavor I will consider coming back for are the vanilla bean macarons. The others weren't to die for.,UNK
893,This is a nice place to go after work. Its right off the highway and the food and the prices are reasonable. I would recommend... especially if your stuck in traffic around  77 and 485,UNK
894,This spot pails in comparison to the one in Garden Grove. The exterior and interior areas are DIRTY! It turned me off that I wasn't even willing to eat a Banh Mi Sandwich from this place. My nickname for this spot is Dakaka!,UNK
895,AMAZING food! The Lunasagna is my favorite. I really dig the new layout as well. A must try even if you are not Vegan or Vegetarian. You will not be disappointed. I'm a carnivore and I love this place.,UNK
896,"Customer service!  Someone still has it this day in age!  After waiting for several minutes for someone to help me over at Dillard's, I simply gave up, walked into Nordstrom, and purchased the same pair of shoes in no time flat!  To the employee who helped me:  Hats off to you good sir!",UNK
897,Greenwalt was a kook. I wasted a half hour with him.  He did crack my neck which felt better but he is into kniesiology and acted like he was psychic. It was just bizarre.  You'll spend more time talking about nonsense than him actually doing something.,UNK
898,"This place is just disgusting. Usually I can suffer through bad sushi but this was awful!  Old rubbery seaweed wraps, warm slimy sashimi, mushy rice. Just disgusting.",UNK
899,"Absolutely loved the service here! \nWe brought our truck here after getting hit by another driver, and they were so nice from start, Robert kept in touch to tell us about our truck's progress, they called Hertz for us to get a rental, I will definitely be coming back for future repairs.",UNK
900,"Groves Bar & Grill has a cool concept, that's the only reason it gets 2 stars. Overall I thought the wine was mediocre for what you get for the price. And the place was wayyyy to hot and crowded with no place to sit. They just need a bigger place with a better wine selection.",UNK
901,Extremely dissatisfied.\n\nWe ordered 5 different sandwiches and only enjoyed 1. \n\nTomato soup was the most disgusting soup I've ever had. It tasted and smelled like vomit. We literally had to pour it down the toilet because it was so horrible.,UNK
902,Simply the best tea around. Great customer service when it comes to product knowledge and demonstration. The only knock for this place is that it is expensive for a fairly inexpensive product,UNK
903,"Best Gyros, hands down.  And reasonably priced too.  Good chicken sandwiches.  And their mediteranian entrees are delicious as well.  As for the donuts, they are above average but not amazing.  The owners are so kind.  I like going here.",UNK
904,Although the food was average this place was filthy. It looked as the the floors weren't cleaned for days and the tables weren't clean. What's worse was that the wait staff stepped over the dirty floors time and time again not noticing or caring it was disgusting. Bad experience.,UNK
905,Dont go there early in morn. They dont serve chicken till 10:30.  Good donuts.  Maybe will try again but its long drive to find that out especially in rush hour,UNK
906,Kim is just the best. Whatever design whatever color you ask she will do she always does her best to have her costumers satisfied. Trust me Kim does a GREAT job my nails last up to 3 weeks looking great...,UNK
907,Plus 1 for switching to self serve drinks and the choose your flavor Coke machine.  Minus 1 for switch from Gelato to soft serve/self serve.ice cream.,UNK
908,"No matter which location I go to, I am never disappointed with Ruth's Chris.  I would live here if I could...  Feeling hungry?  Try the Porterhouse...AWESOME!",UNK
909,Friendly and neighborly service and the best pretzel bun I've ever had. \n\nA nice stiff drink to top it off and good classic music. There was literally nothing I didn't like about this place! Will be back again :),UNK
910,This 3 star rating is for the food.  The food is OK here but when you combine it with the cheap price it is worth going.  I probably eat here a couple times a month.  Its good cheap eats!,UNK
911,"Excellent strong English cheddar \""Coastal\"" Highly recommend it. Great place for bulk buys of items you use a lot provided you are familiar with prices - Johnsonville brats for example are an excellent price in large packs, just seperate and freeze. Awesome home brand (Kirkland) smoked salmon.",UNK
912,Barbecue sampler was fantastic. They served it with coleslaw and two types of sauce. Highly recommend you try this plate. \n3 choices of meats.,UNK
913,James has saved my life multiple times and got me out of some REAL binds I thought I was for sure screwed with. He's also a super cool dude and very reassuring throughout the whole process. Wouldn't go anywhere else!,UNK
914,"Kids: 5 stars\nNot too busy, lots of things to do for the kids and 99% of things were up and running.  Staff was very friendly and helpful.  I was concerned after reading the other comments, but can say my experience was pleasant and we purchased a membership as a result.",UNK
915,Wow I'm from southern Arizona and I must say I'm picky about my tacos. This place would take on some of the best!  Very pleasant surprise if your in the area and love street tacos you must stop by!!,UNK
916,Prefer QDub over Chipotle. They are a little weak on the meat portion and 'very little' cheese ends up being a mountain full. One of my favorite for fast food tacos.,UNK
917,I will never ever order another pizza form this place for delivery. The order is always wrong.Never thought I would say it order form Dominos at least the order is always right.,UNK
918,Nice coffee. Great chilling place locating just below Penhaligon's. Go check this place out if you are around. The place is tiny so be patient to get seated. Always full of customers.,UNK
919,"This course is awful. Greens have weeds all over them. Sand traps are nonexistent, they have more weeds, leaves, and pine comes more than they do sand.\n\nOn the 15th green there was a huge skid and didn't even bother to play the last 3 holes.",UNK
920,"This is definitely my kind of hotel: modern, hip, great service, great bars and restaurants, and architecturally sexy. \n\nIt's the little details that make this place awesome. Especially their location in the heart of old town.",UNK
921,It is what it is: Walmart. There is a sonic inside which is nice but they never have enough checkers and the self serve line is not open 24/7.,UNK
922,"Great overall dining experience on all three visits. Our server was very knowledgable and attentive. The Beer selection is awesome!! Grilled cheese, pork belly bites and the butterscotch pudding are must orders!! Can't wait  to go back again and again!",UNK
923,Best coffee in town!! Plus they offer almond milk! And they are a small local business which I will support any day! John the owner and his crew are friendly also they donate so much toward charity's in our community I will from now on only drink grouchy johns coffee :),UNK
924,I'm very disappointed with this visit. Their happy hour is great but the dinner was not. I ordered the Santa Fe chicken enchiladas. The chicken was very dry and and the flavor was just ok. Not much else to say...,UNK
925,"They are great, they're quicker than Fry's or Safeway and have an amazing range of items.  Plus, 3.99 beer that is usually pretty good.",UNK
926,"Great food, better service and I definetly a great place to enjoy a relaxing view of the fountains in the early morning. Can be a bit touristy later but definetly worth trying out.",UNK
927,Left a review under my name as well. Just thinking about that Gyro and wanting to give you another five stars! Absolutely delicious!,UNK
928,"Dont waste your time, I got my meal free on a comp, but I would NOT pay for the food.  Drinks are good, and the ribs are NOT BAD, but dont order anything else if you go.",UNK
929,"Worst Brazilian wax I have ever gotten. Extremely Painful and inefficient, still had a red welt 3 days later. She also used the same stick the entire time which is not sanitary. Eyebrow waxing is significantly overpriced at $18. Do not go here for waxing!",UNK
930,"Used this service over fight weekend, they were right out of the Southwest door at the Las Vegas airport.  Guy who helped me was busy but very friendly, and my driver was professional and let me stop to buy beer prior to getting to my hotel.  Would use them again!",UNK
931,No good customer service even when restaurant is almost empty!!! Left after 10 min waiting in the bar area and it's not the 1st time!!!!,UNK
932,This place is awesome! The ice cream is sooooooooooooo good! I love all the people there! They are so nice! The owner is great too. I definitely recommend this place!,UNK
933,Wouldn't you know their out of business. I had a Tec come out last summer and he charged me under the table. Half of what the company had quoted me. Plus he still charge me a trip charge only to install $75.00 dollars in parts. Thank God there out of business.,UNK
934,"Sweet reply, from the swapmeet employee but think about this- charging a 10$ minimum is still extortion. (An excessive or exorbitant charge.)",UNK
935,R.I.P. Pats Pizza. So sad we have lost our neighborhood eatery to self demise. After eating from Pats for years with an occasional disappointment my last 3 delivery orders have been inedible. Good Bye and RIP.,UNK
936,"My family of six ate at Network's after traveling. The waitress was very friendly and patient. We shared meals and she split them up for us without asking. Food was alright. The sweet potato friends were amazing. It was a little pricey, which is why we split, but that's not any different than any other hotel grills.",UNK
937,I actually find this place to be better than Hot N' Juicy. The shrimp seemed fresher and larger and the ambience is definitely nicer. The side-dish portions are larger too so you don't feel as robbed for ordering a cup of rice.,UNK
938,"This is okay. I mean, you have to pay for Wifi?? They need to get up to speed with the rest of the airport and offer free Wifi. It's about time. Especially being a business oriented city.",UNK
939,The menu has so much more potential beyond sandwiches and old fashioneds. Sit at the bar to avoid the wait and to get the best service.,UNK
940,This is a standard coffee shop.  We had a long line and a bit of a wait. Cinnamon roll french toast was good. Salmon cream cheese spinach omelet  had  lots of good salmon. The cream cheese was a bit odd - it was in chunks. Service was good.,UNK
941,"The casual buffet at Cafe Lago in Caesar's Place is nothing special. For $22 you can get a variety of mediocre food. The desserts are decent, but everything else is disappointing or at best unremarkable. At least the decor is decent, and the live piano was a nice touch.",UNK
942,they may have good deals and sometimes but their customer service sucks they could use all new employees as far as cashiers. because of them I only go there when I absolutely have to,UNK
943,"I enjoy this place. Authentic, inexpensive Hawaiian food. It's run by some nice people. The store itself is a bit on the low end side, but I don't think it's meant to be fine dining. Great for a quick Chicken Katsu fix.",UNK
944,I had the chorizo breakfast burrito\n\nWas the saving grace that could cover some of the stink from past experiences.\nHowever their combo plates are pretty average as in Filiberto's in a dining hall setting average.,UNK
945,"I guess they don't season the Hula Burger because they use the same patty for the Cajun burger and that burger would be salty.  So heads up - get the Cajun burger if you're gonna try one.  And they also said they leave the fat content high for flavor, fyi.",UNK
946,This store has done a complete turnaround. It has taken a year but they finally have prices on almost everything!!!! Tons more stuff in the store and much better customer service. If you sign up you get a monthly coupon for 40% off one item each month so sign on up!,UNK
947,"It's what you would expect.  A good turkey sandwich, side salad, and a cookie.  Not rocket science.  It's clean and pretty fast.  A convenient place for a quick lunch.",UNK
948,Food is awful and recently got busted for gambling in restaurant where they were gambling on where a pigeon would poop in the restaurant. Stay away,UNK
949,Miss good TexMex places like this from Texas. Any place that makes their own tortillas in house automatically gets a 5-star review from me (unless there's something significantly wrong).\n\nNacho/Queso bar from 4-7pm for happy hour definitely makes it a bonus for an early dinner.,UNK
950,"Every time we visit Vegas we come here for a boba milk tea as a special treat. The ladies at this store are always nice and the teas come out very quickly, even if there's a line.",UNK
951,This is really cute and awesome place for my daughter and myself. I'd love to come back soon!! Thank you all staff and Rainey!! Rainey!! You're an awesome artist!!!,UNK
952,"First time to this place, it was just okay. Probably good for thai food if you downtown and don't want to leave. Not authentic enough for me.",UNK
953,I sat at the outdoor bar under a straw rooftop and the March breeze cooled down the Phoenix 90-degree March heat and I truly felt like I was in Hawaii. The margaritas were S-T-R-O-N-G and the crowd was lively and fun!,UNK
954,Good service nice staff. But the food is over priced. My steak was cold in the middle. In my opinion you would be better off going to someplace else for a good steak.,UNK
955,Save your money.  28.00 for a salad and a burger with 15% off for military discount.  We asked for sweet potato fries and half of them were cold.  We were charged 3.00 for a small bottle of water.  Horrible!!!!!,UNK
956,The pizza is dripping with grease so avoid it.  The freshly made wraps from the sandwich station however are a different matter entirely.  Good food if you stick to the good stuff.  \n\nThis place helps you avoid having to look hard for food and lets you stay in the casino.  : ),UNK
957,"The sushi was fresh, the service was great, it felt like a genuine restaurant from Japan. Whenever I went, there was always a bit of a wait, but the wait is worth it.",UNK
958,"Their butternut squash and kale salad is to die for.  I love that they serve their other stuff on beds of lettuce, as we all need more greens in our diet.  The only real drawback is the long lines.",UNK
959,"Casual bar atmosphere, good food reasonable prices, friendly helpful wait staff (Katie).\nTry the fish tacos, perhaps the best I've EVER had.  Great place, nice bar that tolerates kids well.",UNK
960,I'm a big mexican food buff.  I continue on on my struggles to find at least one really good mexican food place in vegas.....  the search continues...,UNK
961,"Had carry out twice now. Both times the food was very good. The people are extremely nice. Very clean and quiet also. As I sat and waited for my to go order, they brought me water to the table. I plan on going and dining in soon.",UNK
962,No. No. No. This is not good pizza. Have been to this establishment twice and both times I was disappointed. The crust was burnt. The sauce tasted canned and the service(what service?) was below par.,UNK
963,"The Studio Cafe pretty much rocks in my opinion... it's decent food at a decent price, open 24/7.  I've had a couple of very late night dinners there and it really is a calm in the storm of hotel.",UNK
964,"We walked in, sat down and then walked right out. Not family friendly as YELP and other sites suggest. Don't bring the kids!",UNK
965,"Average sushi at best.  We ordered yellowtail appetizer, Kai roll, Salmon killer, and Kiss of Fire rolls.  Good but not remarkable.\n\nService was basic.  Recommendations were not anything more than pointing to a menu.\n\nEven the recommended Chocolate truffle dessert was average.",UNK
966,"Great ambiance and music for our Bachelorettes Party. The only downfall, it gets pretty crowded and hard to maneuver through the thick crowd of people.",UNK
967,"Solid joint, distinctly console-centric, lots of experienced fighting game players. Decent selection of board games, MAME machines galore (looked like). Cool if you want to play some old retro console games although tables can be challenging to find. Nice!",UNK
968,I heard the music from the sidewalk and wouldn't even walk in. What a basic and lame name. I did not see any reason to go in there. I would rather walk around and listen to Andre Nickatina.,UNK
969,It should be a 3.5. The bento box is tasty and they offered 10% off until the end of the year. But we were there around 2:00 pm. There were not a lot of selections for bento boxes. Maybe we should go earlier next time.,UNK
970,Went here for breakfast one day. No issues with the food it was standard diner fare but the slow was not even the word for the service. Needless to say we wound up walking the few extra minutes to Starbucks every other morning for the remainder of the trip and grabbed breakfast there instead.,UNK
971,This is a cool place with an interesting history behind it. Unfortunately the food left both my girlfriend and me with intestinal distress. She had the bland pot roast and I had the meatloaf. We were both sick within 12 hours. I'm sure they must do better with the easy stuff like bacon and eggs.,UNK
972,Went here 3 times and all 3 times I enjoyed it. Very good doner. I usually go to the other village on Jean Talon which is also amazing but I like the decor of this restaurant better. Keep in mind that they're not the same owner.,UNK
973,"BEST Burgers in the Valley!! Great people that work there, and they always have great beers on draft. The spicy beef sandwich is superb, as well - Full of flavor! Happy Hour is always fun and full of fun people! One of the BEST places to eat in the entire valley!",UNK
974,Food is good and love the ordering process. Employees are so nice! Love the organic choices. I think about going here everyday!,UNK
975,"Well.. Apparently this restaurant is not serving the authentic italian food.\nThe food was bit heavy and too much seasoned. Service was good though. On the weekend, there are too many people to get in there, so the tables were jammed.. it feels like I am having dinner with the people sit on the next table.",UNK
976,$50 for 3 burgers and a shake. Are you kidding me!!! Shake was not real. Very disappointing when most Ruby's are pretty good.,UNK
977,Delicious pizzas. I ordered a large pizza to-go. It was so big and tasty that the whole family was enjoying it for 2 days.,UNK
978,"stopped in the minute I spotted the place. fake chicken burger was fabulous. Fish tacos were a bit over baring  .  Salad was a waste of time. cucumber, mint water was very good. However there were no prices so the total was a shock! Not sure I'll go back",UNK
979,"This is a very respectable deli with a sound business model. The one on Franklin St is a Carolina staple, and this one is pretty good too. I recommend their grilled sandwiches, particularly their southwest chicken panini! It was cheesy, spicy, and rich.",UNK
980,"Wings are ok but overall I hate Zipps. Like a lot. All of food other than the wings suck. My friends nachos were just a giant clump of chips, cheese, and melted together to point that we needed a fork and knife to break apart the clump. I also I feel the beer should be cheaper.",UNK
981,I was not impressed at all! The staff was not friendly the food was sub par and over priced! I had cheesesteak the husband had pastrami neither was anything to brag on def wont be going back,UNK
982,This store was great with great customer service! The employee recommended good phones and features and was very knowledgeable. I recommend this store to anyone!,UNK
983,"I have seen Phantom in London, New York and Los Angeles and this production is by far the best!  The chandelier alone is worth the price of admission!  I recommend sitting in the Golden Circle, Rows M through P and be prepared to look up when the Phantom drops the Chandelier!",UNK
984,"their lattes SCALDING hot, to the point that if some drips on your hand it will turn red and be sore for a while. request either iced or a few ice cubes be put in their drinks if you don't want to wait an hour to enjoy your beverage.",UNK
985,"Waffles were pretty good, but I thought the chicken was great. Cooked tender with a lightly crispy and flavorful breading. They were packed on the Saturday afternoon I went so it took some time to get seated, but the service was friendly and expedient for the rest of our meal. I will be heading back soon.",UNK
986,"Yea it's bland crust and a few toppings.\n\nThe hype for this place is ridiculous. \n\nIt is NOTHING special at all, and it is not worth the high price.",UNK
987,"Good quality New York style pizza, which is hard to find in this state.\n\nThey have a huge party size pizza that is great for a lot of people.",UNK
988,The sushi is okay. The speciality rolls are good but it's not the best sushi I've had by far. The bento box for lunch came with a ton of food and it was all really good.,UNK
989,I ordered the Jasmine green milk tea with boba. It was very thick and had way too much milk. I wouldn't recommend getting their milk tea drinks.,UNK
990,"One of my favorite charlotte restaurants. Food is always good, service is always decent.\n\nJust wish they would add more options/change the menu every once in a while!",UNK
991,North Scottsdale Animal Hospital is the best!  Dr Josh was really kind to my pet  Peetie and diagnosed his problem quickly and gave us an easy solution.,UNK
992,Ordered salad with goat cheese; sun flowers and etc plus grilled chicken.  The grilled chicken was too salty.  Sweet potato fries were awesome.,UNK
993,I ordered the Margherita pizza. it was just ok I have never had one made like I have tasted in New York with fresh balls of mozzarella fresh bail and tomato's. I still will order but maybe ill try something different.,UNK
994,"I love this place, and the wait is well worth it. If you are not a fan of waits, crowds or good nosh or novelty food, then La Grande Orange is not for you. But those among you with a versatile and educated palate will enjoy all they have to offer!",UNK
995,"This is a great place recently remodeled and great service for get the fast food i think best fast fast food. always they give you all the necessary items without asking. Manager lady is super nice and, she knows how to keep the place busy and clean..",UNK
996,"Went there last night and loved it! I had the goat curry with the beans and rice, it had a very nice flavor. I can't wait to go there on Saturday to try their jerk chicken.",UNK
997,"This place is nice, really dim lighting, waitresses are in little booby dresses(group of guys would like to eat here). I liked the table we had was right on the edge near walkways & slots so you could do some good pleople watching while you ate. Food was ok, but portions very small.",UNK
998,"Chicken kabobs were tasty, however the spinach wraps clearly tasted of freezer funk, so I ordered the orzo soup and hummus instead. The hummus was great but my soup had about three grains of orzo in it!! Won't be coming back.",UNK
999,"The list of wines by the bottle is really outstanding for a typical tavern. I've been here several times for take out and just recently dined in for the first time--each time the service has been great but the food just mediocre at best.  Not horrible, but just not something that would bring me back.",UNK
1000,"Love the mixed vegetables with the chicken! Nice eating area! Sometimes seems like a little of a language barrier, but worth it for the food!",UNK
1001,"This shop is such an excellent place to go to hang out and talk- the atmosphere is so great! The workers are very courteous and were very helpful in helping us choose a drink. I am planning on going again, and introducing it to many other friends! Finding this place was a real blessing!",UNK
1002,We go here because my husband can use the free wi-fi. We like the friendly people that work here as well.\nDebbie H,UNK
1003,Could use a lot of help. Customer service isn't the greatest. Place could look better. Drive thru takes a while. Playground could use a good cleaning.,UNK
1004,We love this store! They have lots of cool fun things for your home. I love going in there to buy gifts for family members because you can definitely find some unique items. The employees are always so nice and helpful.,UNK
1005,"I order for Papa Johns all too frequently, and am almost always greeted by friendly delivery staff in less than my quoted time. If you use the PJ app or order online you can earn points towards free pizza. Got to love that!",UNK
1006,After waiting 1hour for a table... we finally sat down and ordered a fresh cocktail!\nThe food was really good and the restroom spectacular! \nDon't forget to check them out!!,UNK
1007,"We were shopping while on a visit to Montreal, and were delighted to see a traditional bar without astronomical prices. The open air seating was great for people watching, and the staff was very friendly. The only disappointment was the lack of food - if you don't count the grilled cheeses they make on a small hot plate behind the bar.",UNK
1008,WARNING!!!  Do not do business with them!!!  The are total frauds!!!  They charged me twice as much as the normal amount for a small repair at my home.   I would never use them again unless I want to get ripped off again!!!!,UNK
1009,The food was so bland!! The chicken was bad. Your better off buying a whole chicken at SAMs club or Costco! Don't order the kare kare. It dosent even taste close the to the traditional diSh. This place is a shame! Go eat at seafood city down the block,UNK
1010,What a great place!!  Let me just say the service was exceptional.  The food delicious we tried so many different ones it was great would definitely recommend it to everyone and try everything we just about did!!,UNK
1011,Wife wanted some flip flops while on vacation so Old Navy here we come.\nOf course we get those and a few other things.\nThe security guard hiding behind all the racks was a little weird.,UNK
1012,"I can only talk gyros and Greek salads.....the platter rocks. Forget the fries and go extra large salad for same price. Get dressing on side. Always is if you order out. Atmosphere is not anything to talk about, but gyro platter with extra large salad is!",UNK
1013,"Oh Chipotle how I love you...\n\nExcellent fresh food, quick made to order, friendly people. What's not to like? Oh and their motto is Food with Integrity, meaning hormone free meats and locally grown veggies whenever possible. Fast food you can feel good about.",UNK
1014,"1st time here and I must say the turkey bacon avacado was really good since it was my 1st time I had to order another sub so I got roast beef , that was fresh n tasty as well. Ive now added this to my list of fav sub shops",UNK
1015,"I had the carnitas with a side of mac and cheese.  I had a Dogfish Irish stout to wash it all down.  The food is seriously good and affordable. It was probably the best carnitas sandwich I have had, and the mac was out of this world.  Go here, you won't regret it!",UNK
1016,"I have been here for regular stuff like oil change, buyer's check etc. The people here seem trustworthy. I am giving a 4 star only because I have been going here for the past 3 months only.",UNK
1017,The service wasn't bad. Had to ask twice for a receipt. The ladies room was horrendous! Had not been cleaned for some time. No toilet tissue or paper towels. Had to dry hands on the seat covers. The floor needs to be power washed. Obvious no one has really given it the attention it needs.,UNK
1018,"Seriously a kick ass place to eat. I'd ask for Luciana the waitress, she offers excellent service with a smile!! Amazing food and pretty good price.",UNK
1019,We were last here two years ago and were pleasantly surprised.   We'll be there again this Sunday and I'll give a re-review shortly.  \n\nThe one on the strip is NOT as good as the one off the strip.,UNK
1020,Worst Chinese Chicken Salad I ever had! It had 3 small pieces of chicken and was more like a garden salad! Will never go back!,UNK
1021,Their drive thru intercom is broken. I'm waiting 15 minutes so far with a car in front and in back blocking me from fixing my mistake. I haven't even put my order in. Tell my wife and kid I love them. For the love of god stay away if you want to live life outside this drive thru.,UNK
1022,"I recently tried the lunch buffet there, and it was alright.  You could tell some dishes weren't freshly made and the chicken was also bit dry.  I also felt there weren't enough selection also.  Service was great though.",UNK
1023,Expensive.  Lady smirked at me for leaving a $2 tip.  I would have given more but $20 for 30 minutes is ridiculous.   I would go back just so I don't leave a tip.,UNK
1024,Over the years I have dined at many cheap low end Chinese buffets. This is easily the worst.  \n\nTheir sign says they have something like 150 (I don't remember exactly) items. I don't see the point of having so many items when stray dogs wouldn't even eat this food.,UNK
1025,"I always like to try something twice to make sure I was right. Again I must say, this has to be the best buffet in Vegas. This is a must try for everyone. Think of it as gourmet food, buffet style.",UNK
1026,Love this place for lunch!  Fun Italian atmosphere with great food and service.  If you work around the Valley View/Russell area I would suggest going there for a panini.,UNK
1027,This visit I had a Loco Moco.  Gravy was a bit on the salty side.  This Loco Moco was not even close to the best I've ever had. Quite honestly I was disappointed. This is coming from a Hawaii local who got fat from eating Loco Mocos everyday! Lol,UNK
1028,"Great service, great pizza, great specials, great coffee, and great dessert.  Piazetta delivered at this location, as it delivers consistently in each of their locations around Montreal, perfectly cooked pizza and fantastic service along side all the other amenities.  The only criticism I have is the beer selection is seriously lacking.",UNK
1029,I have seen SO MANY shows in VEGAS and this is BY FAR the best one. You will love it!!! has everyhing!!!\n\nMake sure to go a little early b/c the line for food gets busy!,UNK
1030,Won't go to this shop again in my life. Customer service thumb down\nI have to give 1 star. I really want to give them 0 star,UNK
1031,"Casino is a dump. Old, smokey, small. By far the worst casino in the east valley. Hotel rates are ridiculous.Not what you would expect from Harrahs",UNK
1032,Food's decent albeit overpriced (welcome to FRC). Service is mediocre. High staff turnover. Vibe is ok. But a bit pretentious,UNK
1033,I love the pizza but there is always atleast a 45min wait for a table. But I have learned that you can pre-order your pizza so it will be ready close to the time you get seated. But their salads and deep dish is really good.,UNK
1034,This is absolutely abysmal. I'm sitting at the table trying to figure out how to get my money back...,UNK
1035,GET MORE HELP!!!! Takes 10mins to wait for your drink!! Hire more people i use to love this store till now..,UNK
1036,"Small portions, at least the take out is. Dine in was better, but could use more noodles. Broth is clear and clean, good flavor. Negative on limited veggies offered with pho and cash only. Nice clean restaurant.",UNK
1037,Can't complain.  Asked for a shot of espresso and it's served as expected.  Nice interior and their prices are very reasonable.  Nice addition to that area.,UNK
1038,"Good family fun!! Great deals n food!!! The prizes for kids r cool too!! Staff is friendly n the customer service is great! We come here often, u should too!!!",UNK
1039,Bartender George is awesome! Really like the staff here and have had really decent breakfast here a couple of times. Always hot and fresh food. George never lets my beer hit empty before I have another ice cold Fat Tire sitting in front of me. What more could you ask for?,UNK
1040,I used to go here a lot... But then the staff changed and the bartenders just suck now. I still like the waitresses. Its a shame they have to deal wit slow bartenders now.,UNK
1041,"My wife and I ate here over the weekend. \n\nWe had a great experience with the food, and the service. The hostess was very cordial, and our server was friendly and helped us decide on what to order. \n\nWe got a spicy chicken dish that was delicious, and plentiful.",UNK
1042,Awful and over priced!  Water spilled all over me and my new coach purse and snobby staff all expect for our waiter. Hated everything about it. I knew we should of went to the BBQ place across the street.,UNK
1043,"Stayed here for a short weekend holiday.  Rooms were good size, easy to get to and clean.  I did not like having to leave my room for coffee, no coffee makers in the room.  It is located right across from the MGM Grand which was the site for our concert, so in that regard the location was great.",UNK
1044,Went there for dinner during happy hour.  Fantastic service by Michael and his manager Francesco came over to chat with us as well. We had them running for drinks and appetizers.  Been there 5+ times and never had a bad meal!,UNK
1045,"Located in D terminal. Has a limited Chili's menu which only includes, sandwiches, burgers and soups.  Service was quick and I was only slightly ripped off. Was expecting to pay more considering its located in an airport terminal!",UNK
1046,Called to place a catering order and they rudely asked me to call back in 20 minutes b/c they were busy. WTF? How about I'll call one of the other 20 Qdoba's in town to give my money to.,UNK
1047,Met the family for pizza and beer last night and had a great experience. Is our second time meeting there and both times the service was great as well as the pizza. I recommend this place to anybody.,UNK
1048,"Maybe it was because it was late, or it just wasn't a good night. I wasn't really a fan of the barrito I got, and the seating area was cheap plywood tables that need to be sanded down. The employees were very nice and talkative.",UNK
1049,"I go out of my way to find a Fry's. Great customer service, excellent quality in food, great prices, clean stores & fuel points. I buy my gift cards for work and what ever I want to spend money on then turn around and get the discount at the pump. Good call! you'll always find me shopping at Fry's",UNK
1050,All very nice equipment but all very pricey better to find what you want online or at a department store if your serious enough to want something for your kitchen the smaller tools you could find cheaper at a restaurant supply store or a department store that sells kitchen gadgets and dishes.,UNK
1051,Never had a bad dish at Babbo. The prices are fair and the staff is nice. It can get very busy at peak times. It is best to go on off nights or off hours to avoid the crowd.,UNK
1052,I order from Beijing about once a week. The delivery is very quick and the food is always hot! Ask for the spicy chicken soup if you have a cold! Food is great! And I've seen the owner at Sprouts getting fresh produce.,UNK
1053,I thought Crossroads Farm lessons were good enough until I went to a different stable. The group lessons are not very effective and the tack is not in good shape. One lady actually fell off her horse because the stirrup strap broke.  \nHopefully they have improved since I was there which was about a year ago.,UNK
1054,"The lamb gyros were excellent and the side of soup was delicious. The prices were reasonable. The employees were very friendly and the restaurant was very clean. Finally, a good Greek restaurant that's not too far from the house.",UNK
1055,"I came here just for the $1 oysters and was completely disappointed.  Tiny, grainy. so not worth it in a city with so much delicious food!",UNK
1056,"Tom's really went downhill when it merged with Folino's. Now the food is way overpriced, and the ambience of the former location is gone. It's still the go-to place for food on the south side at 4 a.m., but it will never be the same as it once was.",UNK
1057,This is not Cafe Lalibela or even close. I was so excited to have Ethiopian food so close. I Grabbed a take out sampler to go. No one was in there and when I got home I threw away most of it because of a bad smell. I am no stranger to Ethiopian food and this was really not good.,UNK
1058,"Having a craving for Latin food, I thought I would give it a try. It was just ok. Chicken was ok. The Pisco was ok. The fried plantains were great. \nThe service was strained and seemed like this place has seen better days.",UNK
1059,"Oyshi's AYCE sushi experience is kind of, well, meh.  It is neither exciting nor disappointing.  I felt that the fish to rice ratio on the nigiri was a little rice-happy.  The rolls were not too exciting.  I would go back, but only if someone else insisted.",UNK
1060,"I'm just putting in my quick 2 cents. This buffett is one of the best on the strip, and you won't be disappointed with it.  Yes, its a bit expensive, but it's 10x better than the Bellagio one.  \n\nDerek",UNK
1061,"I have tried almost all dishes there, and those taste great! Really recommend if you like spicy food, but you can choose no spicy flavor though.",UNK
1062,Love this place! Staff is so friendly and they have the tastiest coffee!!! They have a drive thru and also do band nights!! Check them out!,UNK
1063,"A fantastic workout and even better instructors. After going to several fitness studios in Charlotte, Carolina Barre and Core stands above the rest. Every class is like a personal session -- they keep you accountable and keep going to achieve your best workout! A must-try... and I promise you'll be HOOKED!",UNK
1064,This is a great juice stop! Recipes are amazing! Place is clean!! . If you are looking for healthy juice this is the place! I highly recommend.,UNK
1065,"Now I am not one to dismiss a good burger joint, one of my favorite foods. This place is cool looking with lots of ice cream options, however I found the burgers to be quite greasy. \n\nI'll pass from eating here again!",UNK
1066,"Menu isn't extensive, yet the food is a step or two above Olive Garden, and the atmosphere is pleasant. Food & service are usually pretty good; we have tried various dishes. We like it on Christmas Eve as it is one of the few restaurants open that evening, and late.",UNK
1067,"Although the repair work was fine, the customer service was terrible!  No communication and very difficult to talk to someone.  I called them on day promised and they said the work was done and give them another hour so they could wash the car and double check work.  I picked up rhe car and it was not washed!  Would not use them again.",UNK
1068,Is this place closing down?  Hardly anyone there at all on a Saturday night at 8pm. I guess its good if you prefer light crowds. \nThe concession stands are practically bare and the display screens at the box office are turned off.  Guess that Harkibs is taking over the area.,UNK
1069,"saw that it was open under a new name and owner, and thought i would give them a try\nboy was i glad i did! I had a pastrami, it was the best i ever had.\nthe place was very clean and bright\ni will be back for sure.",UNK
1070,"The best fast food I know of. Maybe Chipotle, as well. Staff is always friendly. I'm not from here but this place is very Wisconsin-y to me, in a food way.\n\nGood chili.",UNK
1071,"Had the NY  strip, green beans, Mac & cheese and key lime pie. Out of a group of four that shared the same side dishes, I ended up getting food poisoning! Three days later and I'm still feeling the effects and lost six pounds too! I will not be going back... Diner beware!",UNK
1072,menu set up was great!!! lots of options!! my burger ( Vesuvius volcano) was a little undercooked but they fixed it and comped second round of drinks!,UNK
1073,My favourite place for a mussel pot in Scotland. As an added bonus they also serve some of the best chips I've ever enjoyed - just make sure to get the ones cooked in roast beef drippings!,UNK
1074,"I'm not the hugest fan of food/gaming joints, but their breakfast is pretty good, especially if you're drunk/hung over..",UNK
1075,Had dinner with friends service was\nGood but Slow even with an almost empty restaurant had the filet mignon which was perfectly cooked but seriously over seasoned...tip to chef less is more! Best part of the meal the baked potato soup stupendous that and the Cardinals winning the World Series!!,UNK
1076,"This place is great. Wow. I love meat and burgers and hearty food. Got the bacon cheese burger and man was I impressed. The bacon was circular and flat instead of strips, it was a nice touch. Try it for yourself.",UNK
1077,We saw Gilbert Gottfried at the Shimmer Showroom at the Hilton.  Very small venue which was very nice.  I loved the show and the experience.  We bought his dvd and he signed the front of the case.  Gilbert let us take pictures.  I enjoyed the show along with the hospitality of the staff and Mr. Gottfried.,UNK
1078,"I have only shopped here for hot pot ingredients, don't expect help though, (you won't really need it, i found everything i needed on my own) it is just that the isle arrangements don't exactly have much sense to them.  Also the veggies are nice and cheap, which is always a plus.",UNK
1079,Best breakfast in Vegas and the long lines prove it. Pancakes are super huge and delicious.  Banana french toast is the bomb... definitely a must go if your close by.,UNK
1080,This isn't my usual Capriotti's location but I was driving by and decided to stop.  I ordered my usual turkey sandwich with extra pickles.  The guys working here were very friendly.  I recommend this place to anyone.,UNK
1081,"Best spot ever. Fresh food, fast service and cheap. If your a soup lover it's the place to be. I usually have the chicken soup, huge bowl for $ 6.50.",UNK
1082,Its a sport bars.  Great venue with a bunch of TVs so you always have a view.  \n\nIt is pub food and well priced.,UNK
1083,Pretty cool spot.  Reminds me of a silver diner and for that I enjoyed the place.  I didn't get the memo about the big shakes but we got our food and was plenty shocked.  Fries were disapointing as we just wanted to get fries and a shake.  Overall we had a great experience and would return.,UNK
1084,Stumbled upon Sunrise Coffee while driving down Sunset. So happy that I stopped since they made one of the best mochas that I have ever had. Reminded me of the coffee in Seattle. Not too sweet and made by a real barista.,UNK
1085,"Stopped here on our way to Sedona.  Pancakes are thick,  fluffy,  amazing.  Glad we didn't go to dennys as planned.  Only reason didn't do 5-star, took a little long for the food to come out.  But great anyway.",UNK
1086,WAY OVERRATED....It is HUGE but I found a hair in my food and I have been burping up what I did eat all day...It was $45.00 plus tip for 2 adults and 2 children....I WILL NEVER GO BACK!,UNK
1087,Really dirty and mediocre food.  These guys need to go back up north and learn the trade.  Nothing to offer and crabby attitudes as well\nVery sketchy people,UNK
1088,"It doesn't match the layout of the other Barriques and the seating area is a little cramped and sparse.  Still serves the great coffee that I have come to know and love but unlike their other cafe's, the staff is a little surly and indifferent at times.",UNK
1089,"When here for lunch great food and very friendly staff :)...gave us free egg rolls,cheese wontons & a soda...I it's the small things that really count! Thanks for the great service and food!!!",UNK
1090,I read the previous reviews and was hesitant to stop in when we were at the mall this past weekend but I was pleasantly surprised at how quickly I was greeted. A girl by the name of Gia was great help and quickly got me what I needed. So glad too because it was total chaos with all the last minute holiday shopping going on.,UNK
1091,"This is a great little divey pub in the Freemont street area. It can get a little packed on the weekend, but it's gaming free, so it automatically gets a little love from me as a place to have a non-traditional Las Vegas experience.",UNK
1092,This place used to be a solid sushi choice however the last two times we have ordered take-out it has been a disappointment.  The fish has been sliced ultra-thin served over excessive rice.  It comes off as they are struggling and trying to cut costs.,UNK
1093,Used House of Sound to add after market Ipod connector to stock radio. They did a great job. Every person I dealt with was friendly and professional. I would highly recommend that company (at least for car audio needs. They offer other services but I have no feedback on that). I would definitely use them again. A++,UNK
1094,Some sections seem to be plagued at not being able to be kept up. Items can't be kept stocked. Shelves can't be kept straightened up. It's like they don't have pride in that department. This has been a ongoing issue in the shoe department for sometime.,UNK
1095,"Was close by for a doctor's appointment and yelp introduced me to this place & I fell in love with the place. Exceptional food and service, one of the best meals I have ever had in my life.",UNK
1096,"Mon genre de resto de HOMA: cr\u00e9atif sans forcer, bonne carte des vins, service pro et sympa,  client\u00e8le bigar\u00e9e",UNK
1097,By far my favorite Target in the valley! They really upgraded the store with their new produce/grocery section. I've never been that big into Target until I moved closer and realized that Walmart just doesn't cut it with customer service and cleanliness.,UNK
1098,Called a couple hours ahead to schedule a pick up and dispatch said I was all set.  Then I get a call 1 minute before my scheduled pick up time to let me know that they can't make it in time and they don't know how long it would be.  Missed my appointment and will NEVER be calling them again.,UNK
1099,Went for lunch. Great vibe! Fresh flavors! Honored gluten and dairy free needs. Awesome view!,UNK
1100,Terribly overpriced.  15 bucks for internet?  20 bucks for a fridge?  Two bucks extra for lettuce and tomato?\n\nDefinitely not staying here again.  Theres a massive lack in value.,UNK
1101,"Make sure you go earlier in the day, when the cupcakes are fresh.  If you go to late in the afternoon they tend to get a little dry...but either way they are SCORES better than cupcakery and freed's bakery's cupcakes.  The peanut butter cup cupcake rocks.",UNK
1102,This is a comfortable dive. I come here for the strong drinks. There is this tea-flavored vodka that they mix with a squirt of lemonade... you tend to forget that there's booze in it. And then you try to stand up and walk and you fail. Dude.,UNK
1103,"Lets see, you say your store is open until 6pm your sign is lit up that says open. I show up at 5 for a quick watch adjustment and you say you are closing....way to not want customers. So rude!",UNK
1104,They get zero stars we have had our suite now booked for 5+ months we go to check in and they tell us SORRY you have been down graded!!! WTF what Hotel does this???!!! NEVER book here you don't know what you till you check in!!,UNK
1105,I was in there this morning and the girls were very friendly! I spilt my smoothie all over and unfortunately didnt have time to wait for another one. But the other girl had already made me another one! \nI left a happy customer! :D,UNK
1106,This place is overly trendy and the sushi isn't very good at all. Two stars for the sake bomber happy hour specials.,UNK
1107,"We tried the place out before our flight on Sept 23, 2009 for brunch.  The food selection was okay, the drinks were better.  The server was very friendly and helpful.  \n\nThe deco of the resturant was very cozy.  The place had TV screens with sports and news.",UNK
1108,"Top notch all the way!!! We have had several events here now and everytime it is clean and set up exactly  as requested! The staff is awesome and friendly and makes sure we are always taken care of. We will be renting the facilities here again several times in the future as so far, thay have been exceptional in all they do.",UNK
1109,For one thing when you ask for medium rear it should not be medium well and the shoe string fries tasted like crap the service was not great it is the worst 120 I spent for two never again,UNK
1110,Been here several times and love it every single time! Food and service has always been good. Love the outdoor seating area and just the atmosphere feels authentic.,UNK
1111,"The tortilla soup is good. The carne asada burros are good. Overall the food is good, but a bit pricey for what you get.",UNK
1112,"was on this side of town and called in to grab some famous brown bread and grab a nice juicy outback special steak. \n\nShawn D made our experience excellent he made us feel at home and was speedy with everything, I was impressed to hear him roll everything off the menu without a pause to think. Well recommended.",UNK
1113,"This poutine thing is a real death trap, but so good! I tried the Poutine Dan Dan : Regular Poutine with Onion & Bacon. The cheese burger was nice and cheap. They have good taste in music too!",UNK
1114,"Why does it ALWAYS seem as tho the cashier's are bordered by the fact that a customer wants to check out. You do not enjoy your job, find another! \nJust awful! !!!!!!!!",UNK
1115,"can anyone say \""garbage, from the service, drinks, food, people, environment, eeeeeeeeeeeeewwwwwwwwwww!!!!1 your actually spending your hard earned money on this place??? lmao",UNK
1116,They move you from chair to chair as you have services done.  They did not have enough staff and Lannie was working on two customers at the same time.\n\nWhen I went to wash my hands the sinks were dirty especially around the faucets.\n\nNot impressed.,UNK
1117,"My only visits to McCarran are due to layovers from and to the East Coast. I've never ventured far from my terminal for the next flight. Whatever I need is nearby -- a quick snack, magazines, Tylenol for a raging headache. The Southwest terminal offers great specimens for people watching. I never get bored.",UNK
1118,"Can't say enough great things about this place.  The ambiance, the service, the food.  All GREAT.  Definitely deserves 5 stars.",UNK
1119,"According to my boyfriend, this local bar type place rocks.  Food is always good, it's cheap, atmosphere is great and had a good conversation.  They grill the burgers right in view of you as you're ordering.  They also cook your burgers over charcoal so it gets real flavor in them!",UNK
1120,No longer go there.  Big issue over a coupon.....not worth my time. Not big on customer service.   I buy my yogurt in Chandler on the way home.,UNK
1121,"Le Peep is your typical but delicious diner! I had the Hen Pen which was two eggs, three strips of bacon, potatoes and an english muffin. We were served our food quickly and devoured it just as quickly! I recommend Le Peep for a quick and simple breakfast",UNK
1122,"This place has been around for years! it is family owned by the Casella's family. They make the best sandwiches in the valley in my opinion. The turkey sub is awesome as well as the Italian beef which is to die for. The only pitfall to this place is that they do not accept debit cards, cash only.",UNK
1123,"Ok place.  Not enough cheese on the pizza, crust is ok, but I like the sauce a lot.  I rather have Pizzeria Bianco",UNK
1124,"Don't expect to be full once you leave.  The portions are small and the prices are high.  But, the quality of food and the good service made up for it. We tried most of the recommendations here on Yelp and it did not disappoint.",UNK
1125,Fresh Vanilla and Cassis soft-serve swirl. \n\nThe perfect pick me up after a long day of walking up and down the streets of Montreal.,UNK
1126,"Satisfied my husband's cigar craving on a Friday night. Will say if you blink, you'll miss it! Not actually in the plaza, but a stand-alone building next to Main St.",UNK
1127,"Really good sushi And generly love the salmon teriyaki but tonite tried the shrimp teriyaki and it was not so good, the staff claims pre cooked shrimp is the normal  preparation but I would  not order it ever again if that is so",UNK
1128,Came 3 days ago and still waiting for the food!!!!!!!!!!!!! The food wasn't that great and just spend whole lot of money for no reason.. After waiting for the food which took almost 30 mins..,UNK
1129,"Best fish & Chips ever!  Crunchy batter, very fresh cod & the yummiest thin fries.  Great coleslaw & tartar sauce too.  Love this place.  Shrimp Louie is also terrific.  Very fresh,",UNK
1130,This place was pretty good.  Much better than the average mall location restaurant.  I found my self using the dinner roll to wipe out the last bits of tomato sauce from the bowl of pasta.,UNK
1131,"My dad ordered pizza while visiting him.  They had a one topping special.  It was good.  What I liked best was the size of their slices - huge.  Did not care for the sausage, sliced like pepperoni.",UNK
1132,"Meh, this place is OK. Pittsburgh Chinese sucks so there aren't many options, it's pretty much here or Mandarin. I usually go Mandarin if they are open. This is a decent back up when they are closed-- delivery on weekends is weird.... just saying'.",UNK
1133,Very disappointed in this place both times we went. I don't mind paying a decent price for good food but I have to say $18 for fish & chips that are less than mediocre is a bit much. 1st time we thought they must just be off their game. 2nd time proved they are not worth our time and money.,UNK
1134,Really terrific Indonesian cuisine. The beef rendang and satay was absolutely delicious. The laksa lacked a little something-I can't quite put my finger on what.,UNK
1135,Food is good\nBut services is shit\nOnwer is changed? employees very\u00a0unkindly and something is different then before. . (About atmospheres not interiors),UNK
1136,"Very disappointed with amount they assigned to goods was so shocked I literally did not refuse payment but went back to make sure they had given full credit ,still don't believe they did check all items. Will never consign there again.",UNK
1137,You could also see bad comments for the @ waterfront bar as well. The harbor patrol guys that roll around are useless.. Boat ramps can be a crazy place with control from harbor patrol they can make it better.,UNK
1138,I really like this place. The atmosphere is nice and the good is really good. My girlfriend doesn't like their sushi. I think it's good for inexpensive sushi and a sake for lunch. There's a calamari salad that's very good. Recommended.,UNK
1139,highly recommended to eat a burger. i bet everything is good... this was my first time but for sure will go back and try the rest in their menu. ronin burger was extraordinary... fries was great and the dipping sauce!,UNK
1140,"The salads here are absolutely delicious and there is so many choices to choose from! The service was so nice and I enjoyed that the hosts and servers were all wearing their normal attire. The building was so unique and I loved the decor in the place. \n\nI got the Greek Salad, I highly recommend it!",UNK
1141,"Excellent New York style pizza! I never expected to find this good of pizza in Phoenix, but maybe I should. The entire city is an oven!",UNK
1142,"Our very energetic Irish Terrier has been coming to Dogs All Day since he was 4 months old ( now 4 1/2 years old).  The staff and owner are wonderful, and I feel like they really take care of him.  He absolutely loves going to daycare and being boarded at Dogs All Day.",UNK
1143,"Nice local diner. Serves breakfast all day, which is what we had. Nice sized portions. The link sausages are much larger than normal restaurants serve.\n\nServed mixture of Italian and Greek style dishes.\n\n(My price vote is for breakfast. didn't look at the lunch/supper prices.)",UNK
1144,This place was awesome when I was a kid but not its trash.  They really need to renovate.  This is the hotel that all us broke people stay at when we go to Vegas.,UNK
1145,"This is my favorite mexican restaurant.  It is in a very small space so it gets hot inside the restaurant during the summer.  You may want to bring a towel to wipe the sweat off your face during dinner.  But, it is worth it.  The food is that good.",UNK
1146,If Costco pulls Dinesh D'Souza's books off the shelf I will never shop at Costco again. I will also return the tv I purchased recently from there and I will never spend money there again!!!,UNK
1147,"On arrival, wow, what a walk from the gates to your contact with customs and then baggage.  On departure US customs was quick.  There are very few food choices though for those of us wanting to eat while we await our flight out.  Would have thought that an international airport at a major city would have a nicer airport with more choices.",UNK
1148,I want it all. Give it to me NOW. It's the enchilada's version of Chipotle. I need one of these where I live.,UNK
1149,"If you don't like Jimmy Buffet or anything Caribbean, stay far away from this tumor on the Flamingo. There's nothing special about the tables and there's no welcoming presence beckoning you to gamble.",UNK
1150,Sports book terrible.  College opening saturday.  One waitress.  Lines long to place bets.  They are not what they used to be.  I brought 4 out of towners claiming this is the best.  Gonna leave to another spirtsbook.,UNK
1151,Stopped here for a sweet treat and did not regret it! The ice cream was amazing. The staff was distracted by some friends in the store but were attentive enough...,UNK
1152,Great food in a not-too-stuffy atmosphere. Moderately priced for steakhouse of that caliber and they offer great specials. I could become a regular!,UNK
1153,"Im only giving this bar all stars, because their pina coladas ROCK your freaking butt off! that is if you like that stuff. Which I do!\nThe barpeople are so much fun as well and you can pick up your nightly high class hooker there too :)",UNK
1154,"True quality. True taste. True pizzas. Truly amazing service. There is nothing else I need to say, please eat here!",UNK
1155,Love this place for the food and atmosphere! Service sometimes seems a little slow but then again I am typically there with 10 plus people. Always a good place to start your sunday funday!,UNK
1156,"Our service here was so slow, we thought we'd never eat. There was also confusion on the waiter's part about our orders. At least we sat somewhere away from the crowds.",UNK
1157,"After waiting an hour, we left. They seated several groups from the bar ahead of us. When I asked why she said they had been waiting, but their names weren't on the list?  Won't try again.",UNK
1158,Visiting town w work.\nWanted a good meal.\nFood and atmosphere were excellent.\nI will visit again when back in town,UNK
1159,Our favorite local Asian style food!  We have huge battles over the leftover Chow Mai Gun/ Singapore noodles.  Not cheap but a good value at lunch.   No delivery :(,UNK
1160,Could the staff here hate life a little more? Smiling doesn't hurt. Not to mention I got bulldozed by several high schoolers.,UNK
1161,"After a pleasant first impression (decor, great chairs), the food quality was mostly boring (Moh-rockin' salmon is surprisingly bland), the service unacceptable (got my entree order wrong, got the check wrong).  Considering their prices, I expected better.",UNK
1162,"Lunch menu isn't great. Dinner is decent. Would avoid coming for lunch. Dinner it is ok to be here. And if you go a little late for dinner, the person asks if its take out :P ? Haha! New way to say to customers, go away! Avoid lunch for sure.. Not worth at all.",UNK
1163,Food: Exceptional. A more refined take on traditional Thai cuisine.\n\nService: Nothing to write home about.\n\nAmbience: Feels a bit crowded. Waiting area is tiny.,UNK
1164,12/15/12 Worst lunch I have eaten in years. Won't be back.  $43.00 RIP OFF.  Food was bad and uneatable.,UNK
1165,"Terrible service!  I ordered three bagels, two were wrong. Ordered an iced coffee with cream,  it was ALL cream and sugar. Disgusting. I called and they asked me to bring al the food back in and they could remake it...no. They weren't even nice about it.",UNK
1166,Didn't try the food but the restaurant was very upscale and cozy. 5 dollar margaritas which aren't too weak. They even played Morrissey and Depeche Mode! All in all not a bad place to grab a drink or two.  The service was nice and friendly.,UNK
1167,I read the Yelp reviews online and decided to give them a try. I was very impressed by their professionalism. My car was delivered as promised and they kept me informed the entire time. I highly recommend them! You can't even tell I had work done!! Whoot Whoot!!!,UNK
1168,"Great brew pub!  Hoppy beers, friendly service, interesting crowd and atmosphere.  If you are looking for a great beer, go.",UNK
1169,"Hotel is dirty... Ceiling falling apart, mold on the tiles, dated... I've seen better quality at less reputable brands. Save your money. Management also sucks! The health department should be contacted. This is my 11th time here and the filth I find never seems to amaze me",UNK
1170,We ordered the Spinach salad and Greek salad. We ordered the large portion ($10 vs $8). It was barely enough. The taste was good. Overall the place didn't seem too clean. I might give it a second chance.,UNK
1171,"Though the food was good the service was extremely slow. Took 20 min to order, 40 min for food, 35 min to get our check after we completed eating and the waitress asked if we wanted dessert.  \nService was poor for Red Lobster",UNK
1172,"Same food and drinks, but older population compared to the tempe location. The atmosphere is more of a sports bar than a brewery.",UNK
1173,"The best pizza ! This place is right across the street from me and it's dangerous. I am always craving rosatis, which in my opinion is the best pizza in az !!!",UNK
1174,"Fun blast from the past with my first Singapore Sling in many, many years!  Hit this place early in the day so I have no idea what the primetime scene is like.  But I can say it was a comfortable place sit at the bar, talk music with the bartender and while away an hour.",UNK
1175,Came across this place while at Duckworths Taphouse. Being the competitive people that we are we had to go. Park lanes is the best! Cornhole outside! 2 fully stocked bars! And the prices for the games were reasonable. The music was chill. Get ready for a fun time!,UNK
1176,Not impressed. Sales staff talked trash about other VW dealers and were somewhat unprofessional. This was the manger too. Did not even want to work with me to figure a good price. We just ended up walking out and will never come back. Just typical scummy car sale people.,UNK
1177,The food is just ok. I had the cheeseburger and my friend had the pulled pork burger.  Not the most happening place.  Had dificulty getting a reservation but the place was empty.,UNK
1178,The absolute worst power company in the US. They are constantly spilling coal ash or some other toxic chemicals in our waterways and then refusing to take responsibility for it and raising rates so the consumer pays for it. They have a monopoly on power in Charlotte and they are horrible!,UNK
1179,"The food is great here.  Lots of unique salad choices and great sandwiches.  Prices are reasonable.  The only problem I have with this place is it only opens for like 9-5 or 6 and closed on sundays and maybe saturdays.  Otherwise great food, salad, drink selection at a hell of a price.",UNK
1180,Completely enjoyed this place. We had a party of 15 and the service and food was fantastic. I had the Oscar Filet and it was delicious. The sides are truly special...I loved all the potato sides. The advice they gave us on wine was great as well. Fully satisfied with our meal here.,UNK
1181,Best food and view in Vegas hands down! Short review: Wine list-great\nIce wine list-BETTER\nFood- Is now my top restaurant (Used to be Per Se in NYC)\nBottom line-Been to Vegas too many times to count and this was by far my favorite experience.,UNK
1182,My wife and I think eating is fun and a privilege. So when we eat out and have the worst so called traditional  Philly cheese steak sandwich ever. All I have to say is Wow ! That sucked.  plus we ate our sandwiches by the time our fries got to the table. So I will never eat at  Geno's again,UNK
1183,My family likes to come here to walk around and bounce from shop to shop.  I pretty much just come for the food.  It's a nice shopping center though.  Always clean and the grounds are maintained well.  The fountains and Christmas lights are a nice touch.,UNK
1184,"Good burgers, fries, and hot dogs. Fed my family for $20 CAD and no complaints. Not a tourist place but good fun. Local joint. Walked down the street for gelato later.",UNK
1185,"I am a cookie monster, and this place is awesome.  It's just a matter of getting past the cupcakes which isn't easy.  Everyday they have good sales on several items.",UNK
1186,I usually go just for the salad bar which I think is totally worth it. I decided to order a sandwich and was completely disappointed because it was soaked and soggie. It was a hot sandwich so it probably sat on the plate for a while before they sent it to our table.,UNK
1187,"I thought the food and service were excellent. A little pricy on the regular menu,  but they have good happy hour deals and specials.",UNK
1188,"Nailbarllc is the best in town. They do an excellent job and the team is great.  Lana, Hieu,  Ivy, Katie. ...love them all! I highly recommend and would not go anywhere.  I am a client for life:-)",UNK
1189,"This place is SLOW AS MOLASSES! \n\nbut they will give you free smoothies to make up for it. Apparently this is a \""trainee store\"" so expect just that.",UNK
1190,This place is clean and has a nice staff. They have a pretty decent selection of toppings but the yogurt flavors are pretty poor.,UNK
1191,"We went here with a large group for a birthday party and the service was pretty good but the food left a lot to be desired. It was edible but far from good. My raviolis tasted like chef boyarde raviolis from a can, which I happen to like but not for the price they were charging.",UNK
1192,Convenience store is located right by the casino so the prices are jacked up.  I glanced into the bar and it looked like a glimpse into the flotsam of humanity.    They sell liquor and convenience.   Sliding to the darker side of humanity.,UNK
1193,Always find great sales and when you add your Macy's coupon it makes it even better.   I have walked out of the store sometimes when everything is said and done with items 80% and up off. Sales staff has always been curtious and helpful.,UNK
1194,Food is quite nice and not overpriced. Recommend Haggis and seafood! The lunch set is great value,UNK
1195,Old and ugly rooms. Paid $20 for an upgrade..felt like I was staying in a dungeon. My view looks like I'm looking at a prison. Boooooooo!!!,UNK
1196,Their Old World Classic salad is the best! They make their own house dressing which is a creamy tomato italian that is great as a dressing or marinade.,UNK
1197,"Very inconsistent food and service. First time awesome, loved it. A week later, horrible! Steak was mostly fat, did nothing to rectify it. Hot veggies- cold, 20 minutes to get our drinks after being seated, requests were slow and at times had to be reminded. Repeats are a flip of the coin.",UNK
1198,This buffet is not bad it is just incredibly average. The quality and selection you would expect anywhere. The high point was the complimentary beer and wine. The service was very nice.,UNK
1199,"I bought a new battery here two days ago after they told me that the one in my phone was water damaged. Two days later my phone's still not fixed, and I had to upgrade early. They wouldn't refund the money despite buying an expensive new phone. After being a customer 10 years, that's ridiculous.",UNK
1200,"lunch: i like the multi national spread but nothing was stand out awesome and definitely NOT worth the cross-trek of the strip that nearly gave me heat stroke. \n\nclean, fresh, good service. worthwhile but probably only if it was in your hotel or nearby.",UNK
1201,"Great for breakfast! The salmon dish, the Lorraine quiche and the croquet Monsieur are the best!!! The cashiers are a tad rude though.",UNK
1202,Gym is great if you go early in the a.m. before 11 or you will be stared at by a bunch of old pimps hanging out like their in on prison break the TV series. Other than that LOVE IT,UNK
1203,"Ignoring such negative comments below.  They just don't know what they're talking about.  But the others, just like myself... We love love love the food at Kathy's  It's great food, plain and simple.  Go check it out for yourself!  Easy as that!  I guarantee you'll love it!",UNK
1204,Always get an extra shot.  If you are a raging alcoholic this is pretty much just a slurpee.  Pace yourself cuz this stuff is full of sugar.  Its a good drink to become bigger than Tuesday.  Hence Fatty Tuesday.,UNK
1205,"Great beer selection but extremely overpriced. Weird atmosphere, some nights it is hopping, other nights the bartender kind of pushes you out because it's so slow. I will say that the smoke free environment is nice, but I don't know if that can make up for the steep prices.",UNK
1206,"This is a brunch review only: it has a great atmosphere here, BUT the brunch food is so overpriced for very average quality. It was slow to arrive and portions weren't great. Nothing unique. I will admit the dinners are much better.",UNK
1207,Honestly this is REAL GOOD food but it was hyped up to me as the best Mexican food around. It is good and the place is real friendly. Bottom line SOLID FOOD and GOOD ATMOSPHERE. It did not rock my world though.,UNK
1208,Great food. We love the Family Pack - 4 great burgers with fries and comes with a nice big drink! Affordable and good tasting.,UNK
1209,"Went by today to get ready for the holidays and they were closed? Don't know if this is permenant or something else, tomorrow I try their other location near the mall, the phone number goes to voice mail and website is just Califorina info! Hope I find them available tomorrow!",UNK
1210,Wednesday's is bike night.  And also wet t-shirt contests start at 10 if you're into that apalling nonsense.  Drink prices were good.  $11 for a bucket of Coors Lights.,UNK
1211,LGO contacted me shortly after writing my last review. They offered a sincere apology and gave me a certificate as compensation for my poor service during my last visit. They also informed me that LGO coupons should always be accepted even if they are expired.,UNK
1212,"Just to let everyone know what happened, their customer support rep called me once, we had a very nice and constructive conversation, and they told me they'd get back to me with either good or bad news.\n\nI never heard back. So. The one star stays relevant.",UNK
1213,"New menu this week- price changes and gone are the great chicken wing specials on Thursdays! I went for lunch, ordered my wings and was surprised by the check...no more wing discounts on Thursdays...of course my bartender failed to mention the changes....she just shrugged and said I'm sorry...",UNK
1214,"I.enjoyed the experience at this place, and was determined to go back but after 3 days my \""rockstar gel\"" nails started lifting, and a week after I had them done they all peeled off.  The people and service were great, but I probably won't return.",UNK
1215,"It took me 50 minutes for an exterior wash. As my daughter and I got into the car, my antenna was siting in the passenger seat and half my front windshield window was not wiped down. I live right around the corner and am very disappointed .",UNK
1216,Awesome. These guys play with food and flavors that others don't dare experiment with. And they kick ass.  Eat here. I would recommend something but their menu changes a lot.  It's a little fancy so  be prepared to spend a little. It's worth it.,UNK
1217,"Worst calamari I ever  had, the carne asada had no flavor.  For being right on the vegas strip I would expect better quality than this place I'm sure the drinks and atmosphere is great but food can't say the same",UNK
1218,"What a great place to sit and eat where portion sizes are big, prices are reasonable and service was out of this world. I liked being off the strip away from the chaos for a while. Gave me a feeling of home!! Thank you!!",UNK
1219,My experience here isn't that great. The meals that my friends and I had could have been better. The price is a bit high for the quality.,UNK
1220,"A little pricey for my taste. Food is good. Nothing really stands out tho, besides their BBQ sauce. Great environment. Wouldn't recommend going during peak business hours because the place gets packed. Long wait times and poor service.",UNK
1221,Great customer service with no BS. I went in for an oil change on my Nissan Versa and they didn't try to sell me anything else. Prices are much better than what it costs at the dealer for equal if not better service. I highly recommend these guys and will definitely be going there again.,UNK
1222,"The price is right & friendly desk lady. Fun place to shop in and located in Pittsburgh's Little Italy is a plus.  I got lots of great new pieces.  I might rate it higher, but the parking is a total pain.",UNK
1223,still building the shops. For what is there it is decent - they even got a Superdry!\nthe foodcourt however is abismal.,UNK
1224,Food was good. Sauces were nice but needed a little temperment. Definitely going back though. Service is on point. Could go a little slower perhaps.,UNK
1225,I found the food great and the staff was awesome and attentive. I just dropped in with 10 other friends at the heart of lunch rush and they did not bat an eye. But foremost the food (Philly Cheese Pita) was incredible!,UNK
1226,"The custard was very good, but I could not believe how little you get for $3.  My husband had a gelati (custard and italian ice combo) and it was really good especially in the Phoenix heat.",UNK
1227,"Meh...overrated. i'll stick with yo rita's for my chef sousa fix. food combinations are much  better in the smaller, bite-size taco portions.",UNK
1228,"I ate here a few days ago for lunch, I got a carne asada taco and a chili reillno. The meat in the taco was dry and had little flavor but the chili reillno was amazing! It had tons of flavor, I was really impressed with it.",UNK
1229,"Good place to watch a sports game.  Beer specials were good. Food is very overpriced though.  The wings are about the worst I've ever had... and I've had alot of wings growing up in Buffalo, NY.",UNK
1230,"Most Targets have a Starbucks and/or Pizza Hut attached them, this one does not.  Primarily, it serve Hot Dogs, sausages and chicken nuggets -- that said the food isn't bad -- but, it is only tube steaks.",UNK
1231,"a favorite place to bring out-of-towners, this (bar-first, distillery-second) locale has a laid back vibe, delicious bevs and great service.  the menu is limited, but full of delightful options to enjoy.  and, the strong local focus of the establishment is a definite plus.",UNK
1232,Daniel does an awesome job of delivering great food and outstanding service. \nThe wine list is not your usual suspects but a wonderful offering of affordable reds and whites.\nThis is a great place to celebrate and even better place to just enjoy great food.,UNK
1233,"Ones ive tried: health nut (blueberry/soy), peanut paradise (PB/whey), get up & goji (berry/yogurt). All excellent, I prefer this place over Jamba any day!\nEven the banana/chocolate for kids is yummy!",UNK
1234,If I could choose no stars i would. Frozen vegetables and flavorless food- that's what authentic is all about.  I applaud the effort but this restaurant should contact Gordon Ramsay. AVOID! Florindinos is more authentic,UNK
1235,found this place and glad I did. I have gone back a few times and the pizza and sandwiches are good. I would highly recommend this place.,UNK
1236,Don't go to this pet salon.  They completely destroyed my dogs private parts and blamed it on my dog that he was too fidgety. My poor dog is still a puppy and now his private area is not healing properly!!,UNK
1237,Nice prices and a clear niche. Just go here and get a nice big icecream. But to be picky I have had better ice cream hence only a 3,UNK
1238,It's all good here.  Great comfort food and enough for a second meal at home. The thick tater chips are great with the different sauces.,UNK
1239,"Best all-you-can-eat in Las Vegas. Sit at the sushi bar and enjoy.\n\nI do not need to make a long, drawn out review. This place is yummy.",UNK
1240,"I have had dinner at this restaurant several times and did not find it particularly noteworthy. The pizza is not far above average, and the salads are pretty bland and common. I also do not find the service anywhere above ordinary. The atmosphere is pleasant and and it is near my home, so I continue to go there.",UNK
1241,I have introduced many people to Sushi Bomb and all leave saying the same thing. 'That was some of the best sushi I have had in awhile!' I go as often as I can. Fabulous!!,UNK
1242,Very clean and delicious food!! Very helpful service. I felt the price of the meal was comparable to value. I would definately return..,UNK
1243,"Weird.... unlike your sister company in SF, you do not have grilled artichokes everyday but you have key lime pie everyday!  Complete opposite of SF!",UNK
1244,"I have to agree with you Sarah. I question why I still go here even after everytime I leave my car is scratched up. Sure it's cleaner than when I brought it in, but not as clean as it should be. \nI'm too lazy to wash my own car too.",UNK
1245,Brunch Buffet was less than ok.  All the food tastes like it looks OLD!!!  Server was really nice and helpfull.  Wish they spent as much time on the food as they did the help.,UNK
1246,Great Sunday breakfast after church.  The staff is friendly and was great with my daughter.  Croissants are yummy and my daughter loved the cookies after the meal.,UNK
1247,"Not good. Red curry had lots of spice and no flavor. Chow mein was a thin ramen looking noodle. Tons of MSG! Made us sick. Very overpriced! Cloth table cloths were covered in glass, but the part that hangs over my lap was VERY dirty!",UNK
1248,"Great ambience, excellent service. Food is OK, not great, not amazing, but ok. Very accomodating to substitutions on the menu. The beer menu is not very extensive and our bill was more expensive than I would like for a neighborhood chinese restaurant.",UNK
1249,"I really want to like this place, because this is the only decent eatery for government employees in that area. But I am still not warmed up to its subs after 8 months. I like the Chicken Wild Rice Soup (Wed only) though.",UNK
1250,"Man, what a hidden gem! Like everyone has posted on here, you have to try their burgers! Some of the best I've had in the burgh. It's hard to locate if you don't have the exact address. It's worth the wait, but I recommend going in early because it gets packed.",UNK
1251,"This restaurant is a family favorite. Whenever we descend upon Vegas, we always make a point to have dinner from Buon Gusto! My favorite (and always will be) is the Penne alla Vodka. But honestly, every item that we have ordered has been amazing!",UNK
1252,"J'arrivais probablement avec de grosses attentes. La bouffe est correcte mais sans plus, le service est par ailleurs excellent et attentif.",UNK
1253,Never a disappointment. Best wings. Fuck BWW. Mon & Tues. 50 Cent wings. Best flavors are Original Hot and BBQ. Damn good !,UNK
1254,"Fun place for a girls evening. We shared appetizers, enjoyed oversized booths and fun crowd. \nFood was amazing and we shared most of it among the girls!",UNK
1255,"Horrible, this is the most unorganized theatre show ever! I wouldn't waste $10 on an event like this. Put it this way a high school production has a better set up and organization than this.",UNK
1256,"Better than you average burger place, and a real blast from the midwest.  If you are in surprise, you have a choice that is off the beaten path now!  Enjoy!\n\nGood burgers, good shakes, fresh fries.  Yeah, it's good for a repeat visit!",UNK
1257,"This is a great place to cool down on a scorching day in Vegas. This mall is huge with tons of stores (high-end is mostly on the top floor). Walking distance if you're staying at Treasure Island, Wynn, or Encore.",UNK
1258,"We have eaten at Fleming's a number of times.The food is pretty good , but the service has sucked each time. We mentioned to the manager, whom was not very sincere with his response. Next time Eddie V's",UNK
1259,"So we have had an ant in our drink, watched bartenders touch people's food and a bouncer refused to kick out a guy who showed His junk to girls. Classiest place ever.",UNK
1260,"Worst manicure ever!  She filed the gel off of my nails so roughly they burned.  I don't like my cuticles cut and after telling the nail tech this she attempted to cut them anyway.  No massage, no lotion, and a crappy paint job.  I will not return!",UNK
1261,"So awesome!!! Same day alterations, very reasonable prices, and super excellent customer service. Maria is wonderful! I highly recommend her and I will definitely be back again :D",UNK
1262,"Waited over 40 minutes for an omelette. Food was good,  but not worth the price. And definitely not worth the wait.",UNK
1263,"Just heard the young lady working state \""those were our last patients. Their appointment was at 6:10.\"" So, show up 2 hours early for your appointment, and bump everyone else out of theirs!? Unacceptable!",UNK
1264,$$BEER$$...Just so so. I guess the price of beer made it expensive. Nothing to write home about.,UNK
1265,"Close to home. Drive through. Yeah it's starbucks, but you get what you pay for. Coffee - Caps are always yummy!",UNK
1266,"Absolutely my most favorite restaurant ever. I reserve it for special occasions, but when I do go, the service is 5 out of 5. The entrees are portioned just right and the presentation is wonderful. The overall atmosphere is calm, cool, and collected. There is not too much excitement that is distracting nor is it quiet as a library.",UNK
1267,Still a nice property to visit. The gardens never disappoint. The fountain show is still great. Every visitor that I host always enjoys the Bellagio stop.,UNK
1268,"Great laid back place to hang out. Encourages you to look away from your phone and interact with people. Very friendly staff and great service! Love the \""Downtown Dog\"" at the grill but you have to get it as a wrap!",UNK
1269,"I've seen this restaurant change its face several times. This time I hope it stays this way. Both times we ordered carry-out, the servers were wonderful. Our orders were ready, hot and accurate. \n\nThe 10% discount from ASU students doesn't suck either.\n\n I highly recommend this place.",UNK
1270,"The performers are amazingly talented. The songs made my body shake with excitment. I notice that there were a total of about 6 people under the age of 55. Price is reasonable, teather is small and intimate which makes it for a good view from pretty much anywhere you seat. \nSandra -",UNK
1271,"Best selection of raw and dehydrated food around.  Very helpful personnel, friendly.  Will shop here each time I vacation here with my dog.",UNK
1272,"The server was terrible here.  She got the orders all wrong, try to save us money by including my meal with someone elses when that person clearly wanted all four of the things in the deal he was getting. Clean location, but bad service.",UNK
1273,"The owners are extremely friendly and nice. They explain everything and answer all questions. Their crepes are delicious. As I was eating, they offered a free sample of their chocolate covered bananas. Definitely a place worth going to for sweets.",UNK
1274,Super fast service even when it is really busy. I go here all the time and the staff is awesome but its not the same without the old manager Heather. I hope things pick back up soon.,UNK
1275,"We have enjoyed mixteca on several occasions.  There is a bit of a line, but it is always worth the wait. Salsa bar and chips are awesome and I absolutely love their beef tacos.",UNK
1276,"Just OK.  OK service, OK food.  Kind of bland everything and the meats were all pretty dry & boring.  Only 2 beef items, flank & sirloin.  The best thing was the oversized Brazilian Punch cocktail.  Overall, it's just too much $ for just OK.",UNK
1277,I believe the cronuts are the best product they have.  The apple fritter I had was not very impressive.  They were also out of milk.  I had been to this store on other occasions when I'm in Vegas.  Very disappointed.  Go to Ron's or the Donut Hut for quality donuts.,UNK
1278,Came here for some sangria and 99 cent (!!!) tacos! Great meal on the cheap in Vegas. The service was friendly and fast as well.,UNK
1279,"After reading the reviews I can't wait to try it. It's my first time, the employees were very helpful and courteous. The place is clean.... I'm very impressed with the Steak & Cheese and will definitely et it again. My husband had the Thai Chili Pork, he said it was satisfactory",UNK
1280,"I love the Clinque counter at this Macy's!  The selection is wonderful and the customer service is A+   I go to this location frequently for make overs, they have some talented people (I go to Hannah and she always make me beautiful and makes give me helpful make up tips!).  Best Clinque I've ever been too!",UNK
1281,"If you on a date or want that a little fancy  italian atmosphere , this is not the one you want to go to. Out dated ugly dining room. The dishes were decent, but nothing special about the place. There are so many other better choices out there.",UNK
1282,"This is the only spot I trust to get my ride a bath, even though I drive a beater, the staff here treat it as if its an expensive European car. \n\nAttention to detail not only comes from the car wash staff but also from Gene who meticulously maintains the gloss and shine of all my Italian kicks.",UNK
1283,Always call for the limo service free cover! just tip the driver...\nalso happy hour was from 1pm-8pm...$3-4 drinks...\nother than that...the rest is up for u to decide if u like it or not...,UNK
1284,These are the best Gyros in town or anywhere for that matter. I have been to Greece and I think they are better at Gyros Express.  I don't know how they are so good but they just are. And I honestly think their baklava is the best I've had.,UNK
1285,"I had an appointment with Molly. I arrived about five minutes early, and was told she'd be right out. It has now been forty, and she hasn't come out to say anything! At this point, I'm going to go someplace else. Terrible customer service.",UNK
1286,These guys rock.  Very talented and great music as well.  Super dudes.  This is a must see the next time in Vegas.  Definitely worth seeing again.,UNK
1287,"great food, great appetizers, especially their chicken wings, nothing like it.  The fried\nwon ton desert is out of this world, the staff is amazing.  A MUST TO GO TO.",UNK
1288,"I have been in a number of times for the pho tai now. The last time I was in, it was simply the best I have ever had. Whatever tweaks they made to the dish has, based on my palette, perfected it! Can't wait for pho night next week!",UNK
1289,I typically use the drive-thru and can expect to wait about 5-10 minutes before I get my burger combo and go. The food has always been good and worth the wait.,UNK
1290,One of my favorite places for breakfast. The chicken fried chicken is amazing! Try it with the hash browns. Your taste buds will be thanking you all day! Really!\n\nAlso note worthy are the breakfast burrito with chorizo and the champion pancake!,UNK
1291,"They are saving money by doing the first coat of polish with some crappy off brand in a similar color. The polish looks really bad, the impurities in the crappy polish are showing. Not recommended.",UNK
1292,"Sub-par at best. We had the Eggs Benedict and the hash and neither were impressive, in fact both were very bland.  We also had to wait for 20 minutes to get a table. This place is not worth what they are charging for the food or the service.",UNK
1293,"Home of a surprisingly good fish fry on Friday nights. No wait, cheap prices and attentive staff. \n\nOther than Friday's? There's better bar food.",UNK
1294,Order was prepared quickly and accurately and tasted fine. Could have used more dipping sauce. Fast food in Las Vegas. It is what it is.,UNK
1295,"I was super excited to see the show. I wish I didn't see the Youtube videos thouygh because I feel like I ruined the show, BUT seeing people do the silliest things is just plain hilarious.",UNK
1296,"You will be surrounded by everything that is M&Ms! Yes, they might charge higher prices for their candy as opposed to your typical CVS Pharmacy or Target, but they do feature a lot of cool merchandise and even have a free 3D movie on the top level. Plus, opportunities to get photos with the characters.",UNK
1297,"I haven't been to Cowfish recently but I just want to say that they continue to do a great job. I visited tonight and had a very good experience. Great service, very nice sushi, somewhat OK wine but overall a very good experience. Cowfish will continue to be my Southpark area go-to restaurant.",UNK
1298,"Avoid Presido. \nThe hostess was completely disoriented.  She could care less. We sat at the table (banquettes are too short) for 10 min without any service.  Bartender served the table next to us twice.  Walked out and went to the staple of Henderson, Lucille's.",UNK
1299,"Meh. I feel like maintenance just puts a band aid on everything and doesn't truly fix problems. Community is no longer gated, which was one reason we were willing to live here.",UNK
1300,We had a great time here celebrating a friends bday- they brought us all a round of champagne to celebrate (and it was good champagne :-)) food was good- the noodles weren't my favorite- but the salmon was incredible. The staff was the best part and so accommodating- we will be back!,UNK
1301,"Great little hang out spot. Full bar, excellent coffee & tea, and great food. Definitely trendy. Good location, right off the light rail. If you're in the phoenix area and in the mood for something different, it's worth it!",UNK
1302,"Good atmosphere and clean. If you are looking for authentic pho this is not the place.  Veg was not as fresh as it should be, soup had very little flavor for the broth and combo bowl was very small (disappointing).",UNK
1303,This place is legit. Order was pork fried rice and wor wonton soup. Had to wait for my to go order quite some time and I had cream cheese wontons included on the house. Better cuisine than the rest out here in LV.,UNK
1304,"Everytime I attempt to go in here to get my nails done they are unable to do them. I strongly suggest you make an appointment if you want to get your nails done here, because walk-in appointments seem to be out of the question.",UNK
1305,Anytime you see pictures on the menu figure a chain. The food is slightly worse than mediocre. The service is OK. There are much better places in the area and this place is ok if you can't get into the other places.,UNK
1306,Love this place the way the girls promote it definitely caught our eye and the rock wall is a big plus! Would like to try their food next time. The atmosphere was definitely fun though!,UNK
1307,"Five stars for the red velvet pancakes alone. Plus we were served quickly even though the place was packed when we came in, which I took as a good sign. I will definitely be back here next time I'm in Vegas!",UNK
1308,What are the meatballs made of?  My husband and I decided it is mostly bread.  We were disappointed in the food and very disappointed in the price.,UNK
1309,I've been to better Sheratons and what hotel sends staff to knock on the door at 8:30pm telling me that I'm playing my banjo too loudly.  Never happened before and I'm in the thick of bluegrass country.,UNK
1310,"We brought our five-year-old son for a visit and were very impressed by the warm, welcoming staff.  We all had a great time playing with the farm dog, petting and holding animals at the petting zoo, drinking flavored milk, learning about the cows on a tractor ride, exploring the gardens, and enjoying some delicious ice cream.",UNK
1311,It's a really good steakhouse and the food is good. But for the price you pay there are better ones to choose from. The wait staff is friendly the ambiance is good. I would recommend try this restaurant once.,UNK
1312,"First timer. Staff was pretty friendly, & the place inside looked great. I got the Mocha madness. It lacked flavor and was overpriced, $8.64 for a protein shake... I might be back to try the food.",UNK
1313,"I've been here twice now, and have not been disappointed. Their juice bar is fantastic and both times I've been blow away by their juice selection and flavors and ending up buying three 15 ml's.",UNK
1314,Forget this place! There are too many other choices in Charlotte to pay for bad food and bad service. It's a typical 'mall restaurant.',UNK
1315,"We went here for dinner a few weeks ago with another couple and everything from the time we get their was poor--they sat us 20 minutes late, everything that all of us ordered wasn't good, the atmosphere feels like a chain and there are many other places on DT Summerlin to eat at.",UNK
1316,Homeology has a lot of great and interesting items. Ryan and Chris are great people. They are very friendly and knowledgeable about the different products that they sell. I really recommend this location.,UNK
1317,The fish and chips taste pretty good.  But the service is the pits and I don't think they turn on the heat in there. It's always freezing. Save your money and skip this place.,UNK
1318,I had a great server Trent that was very attentive.  The food was cooked to perfection.  Even the manager Abby came by to check on everyone.  \nThanks for the great service.,UNK
1319,This is a nice cozy spot. The customer service is awesome and the coffee is reasonably priced. They also have good deli sandwiches and you can order wine what's not to love !!,UNK
1320,"Great rates, excellent customer service! Would recommend to everyone.  What else needs to be said?\n\nTook the time to go through the proper coverages and saved me money.\n\nThanks a lot!",UNK
1321,Although the server is nice the service is HORRIBLE.  Lost or forgotten orders from both the kitchen and bar.  For how over priced it is I expect better service.,UNK
1322,"Since my last review I've eliminated dairy from my diet..boo hoo. But no worries, they have at least 4 vegan options all the time! Coconut sorbet and chocolate sorbet are amazing!",UNK
1323,"One of the nicest Nail Shops been to! The inside is clean, modern and very chic. The girls are adorable & customer service is top notch! I am from California... but will return my next visit to Vegas. I suggest calling to make an appointment because they were extremely busy. Save yourself the wait (:",UNK
1324,You can't go wrong with Italian ice....fast friendly service with a smile is always appreciated! It's a great daddy and daughter hang out!,UNK
1325,Sorry this isn't good nor authentic thai food. Tried the beef salad. Not very good at all and they use low quality beef. I suppose some of the westernized type dishes that aren't real thai are ok. But this place is a joke,UNK
1326,All I have to say is... You had a nice run but it's time to quite.  I go about once a year and each year they go down hill a little more.  I don't think I'll go back.,UNK
1327,The Worst CLUB I had ever been too. To many stairs to get to each room. By the time you get up to the Library room you are too tired and the party energy is gone!! I wouldn't recommend going here if you want to experience the Vegas nightclub  scene.,UNK
1328,Great customer service! Every worker I came across greeted me and they were also very helpful despite whatever tasks they had to do. It made my shopping experience so much easier.,UNK
1329,"I do NOT like this place.  I think it is way too salty...especially the sausage.  The pizza is just so so to me.  I will not return because for the money, there are better places in the area.",UNK
1330,The family really likes this place. Service is consistent and the food delicious. My only complaint is i think there marinara is a little spicy. However i am the only one in the family feels this way.,UNK
1331,I was tired of buffets and wanted a great burger! It was juicy and tasty! I had the medium and hubby had the large burger! This place never close on Vegas strip. Nice meal  after hours!,UNK
1332,"Food is good as always, but I am left wondering why the praise music is only instrumental versions when I sat down to have my lunch.. I was to hear lyrics, it's one of the reasons I dine there, helps me find my center.",UNK
1333,I am not sure what the big deal is. The food is good but nothing was spectacular. If you have to wait more than 15 minutes I would go somewhere else.,UNK
1334,Still doing a decent job and much less crowded than the 8th street location. Wish they would have their own food as the food trucks are getting a little old.,UNK
1335,"The Egg's Benedict Florentine is a great breakfast to start your day with. They have several TV's on during the morning, with the volume turned down and closed captioning turned on so you can still catch the news.",UNK
1336,This was a great hike. I'm not a hiker at all so it was somewhat difficult for me. Getting up wasn't the problem. Getting down a whole different story lol. Has great views of the valley. If your an avid hiker should be easy.,UNK
1337,"A gem in Stonecrest. Fresh ingredients, friendly service and a great value. Finally an establishment in this specific store location that adds color to the area and a simple beer/wine pizza option before a movie. This one could last.",UNK
1338,"Overall good experience. I was disappointed that after I had called ahead and reserved a trailer for my specific vehicle model that they never asked if I had electrical ready for the trailer lights. However, they did install a wiring kit for me the next day for $100. It cost me a day, but they were professional and helpful.",UNK
1339,"TERRIBLE service from beginning to end. Bad hosts, bad server. It sucks. But the food is ALWAYS amazing. I would deal with shitty service for their awesome food.",UNK
1340,This restaurant is one of the few that serves Ahi (you can only call tuna Ahi if it comes from the Hawaiian Island waters - flown in 3 times a week).  It is a favorite for we locals as well as tourists.  Views are some of the best in Sedona.  Wait-staff always friendly and efficient.,UNK
1341,"A bit hard to find, but these folks are professionals!  If you don't know what your doing, or what you need, they will help.  \n\nMy deduction of two stars is due to the fact the workers were irritable and annoyed.  The fact they take limited forms of payment takes a star back too.",UNK
1342,"When I see a restaurant with a 4 star rating on Yelp, I expect the food to be good. The food at Alberto's was mediocre at best. To make matters worse, my wife found a hair on her plate. Eat here at your own risk.",UNK
1343,They are closed!\n Was bummed because I saw all the positive reviews!\n\n\nEnded up next door at Skewer's and had a great meal.,UNK
1344,"Sorry to say, but it was a very disappointing evening.\nThe restaurant is very impressive, old Vegas. However the server was in a cranky mood and the food was not worth $190 bill.\nI would never ever return.",UNK
1345,"A very nice, and big mall. Some of the stores are pricey - but keep in mind, you are in a tourist area. This place can get crowded at times, therefore be patient when you're trying to venture your way through here.\n\nThe fashion shows here are really cool.",UNK
1346,"Didn't give it 5 stars because service was slow but the food was amazing . Tried the marathon flatbread , very good. The beers are great . Kids portions are large and everything is made fresh . Will definitely return !",UNK
1347,"Best taboulee ever! But for some reason, I hate their hummos. Amazing, fresh pita bread baked in house!\n\nThis used to be one of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas but the last few times I've been, the only things that haven't disappointed is the bread and taboulee.",UNK
1348,Not very good at all. The seafood and sushi is sitting out for a while. All of us got diarrhea right afterwards. The serving staff was so sweet and helpful I wish they worked some where else because they really deserve higher tips.,UNK
1349,"Avoid sitting at the bar because the bartender was less than friendly, BUT the Bornem Triple Abbey Ale was simply the best beer ever and the Kobe burger was outstanding.  Soccer on the big screen and NHL on the little screen? Come on, man!",UNK
1350,Very good and fast seating! Me and a friend couldn't stop talking how good the food was while we were eatting it!\n I usually can finish a big meal but this one was very hard and I failed. That is a good fail though because they gave you a lot for a good price!,UNK
1351,"Great place to go to especially on the weekends, Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays.  Line can be long, but if you know people, you can pretty much just get in before other people.",UNK
1352,called the customer service to close my lost secured credit card because also I was charged an undisclosed fee of 25 bucks annually. Neither the branch or cust service was able to help me and now they're sending me a new card so I can come to branch and close it. What ?,UNK
1353,"I wish the good ole days of Steve Wynn and the Mirage Reorts were still around.  The Mirage was the most sought after property right after Caesars.  The shows are cool, the landscaping is beautiful and the rooms are very nice.  The downside is that MGM owns them now....",UNK
1354,We have stopped by this location quite a few times and it is usually pretty good. The service has always been great. I surprised by the bad reviews. It is SO much better than McDonald's!,UNK
1355,"Walked in to Waldo's today and was seated. Waitress brought out the wrapped silverware and placed it on the table,  and a roach comes flying out of one of the wrapped utensils.... Not a good 1st impression.",UNK
1356,As with anyone were big fans of guy and couldn't wait to eat his food. We came we ate we left happier than ever. Huge portions. Good flavor. Just loved our time there.,UNK
1357,"The food was definitely fresh and delicious!  Very Pricey but you pay for the freshness, personalize service and ambiance. Great experience! Master Chef Miguel gave us his best menu for the night! A definite yes to Las Vegas nightlife and opulence!",UNK
1358,"Beautiful, but drinks were expensive and weak, and the speaker system couldn't handle the beats of Alesso, the main DJ attraction - pole dancers were incredible, though -",UNK
1359,Use to be real good but they can't even get my order right it's the 6th time there's a Juliabertos right up the street on 75th and cactus much better service and good Quality and will replace  messed up orders,UNK
1360,"Pros: closer to my house than china town\n\nCons: a little salty, only one type of noodle(thin), kind of expensive for the portion, and they don't have gyoza!",UNK
1361,"Cheap drinks, friendly bartenders, all in all a great neighborhood bar. They have a pool table, Golden Tee, a jukebox, Big Buck, and they've started serving food again! A nice little place to grab a quick drink solo, or get together with friends for a chill night.",UNK
1362,"The service was ok, no complaints. I haven't had any issues with it yet. I got it done on my Nexus 4. The wait time was about 30 minutes. Which I didn't like, because I hate the Desert Sky Mall.",UNK
1363,"Barely a meal. I ordered pepper steak BBQ sauce with white rice (forgot exact name). Those \""steak\"" are far more like chicken rather than steak. I know that I shouldn't expect great food in an airport, but this restaurant is purely wasting my money and appetite.",UNK
1364,This place looks like its not even a restaurant but after eating the food I was pleasantly surprised.  Their burgers are delicious and so was the different flavored lemonades!  The service was great and I will definitely go back.,UNK
1365,"3.5 stars\n\nCame to watch football on a Sunday afternoon. The taco pizza was good and wings were decent. The beer selection wasn't bad and prices were overall not bad. My only complaint was the lazy server we had. She was nice, but she kept forgetting things and would just hang out in a corner.",UNK
1366,"We came specifically for the games.  \n\nI came in empty-handed and I walked out w/ a pink skunk.\n\n\""Thank you, brother for winning this for me.\""  \n\nIf you are wondering, the boyfriend lost to his brother at the game (haha).",UNK
1367,Cute little place. Don't mistake this for the cheap stiff with shrimp powder. They offer a decent menu and fair.  From ramen to teriyaki and even sliders.  Love the ambience. Food is cheap deliscious and in good portion size.   Staff is friendly polite.,UNK
1368,"I've been to a lot of vegan restaurants and seriously pura vida is one of the best vegan spots I've been to. The gluten free options are delicious. they are so accommodating, thank you chef mayra! the best best best!!",UNK
1369,The inventory here is sparse unless you own an iphone. Didn't find what i was looking for. They only have 3 items in the whole store for the droid x. They claim to be the top in cell phones and accessories. I just don't see it.,UNK
1370,Highly recommended... Great service.. Reasonable price.. Buffet selection is perfect.. Will definitely coming back..,UNK
1371,Amazing show! We were seated at Olives for lunch and had the best view... It is entertaining and gives you sorta the wow factor...,UNK
1372,I have been to the one in Washington D.C. and was already a big fan.  I have also been to some of his other restaurants.  Go...you will not be disappointed...,UNK
1373,Excellent service.  Tonkotsu shoyu ramen is my favorite.  Love this place I know it's super busy but its worth the wait. I've never had a bad experience there and I at least go there twice a month. I love it when the manager is the cook she is best!!!,UNK
1374,"This place is great. Great atmosphere, great food and an Amazing sommelier Alex(complete with cool French accent). My favorites were the Steak Heirloom Tomato salad, the fried prawns and frites, and the cheeses(huge variety to many to name). Lunch on the patio was my favorite.",UNK
1375,Nothing better than a bunch of pizza to ease a night of debauchery. Decent cheap pizza by the slice in New York or Sicilian styles and a decent cannolli.,UNK
1376,KA was good. Not as good as O by a long shot. I don't really get the story but the effects and stage set up's were amazing. Very expensive for tickets. We had amazing seats 6 rows from the front but $165.00 a ticket was just too much $$$$ for a 1.5 hour show.,UNK
1377,Rudest staff ever. Don't bother asking questions because god forbid they do their job. I'd rather drive another location than give this one business.,UNK
1378,It's hidden between the laundry place and sprouts literally on the corner of the plaza. It's delicious!!! Healthy close to home!! The owner is super polite Alex lol my kids talked his ear off!,UNK
1379,"Nice, upscale atmosphere with great views of the fountains and strip.  I had the sea bass which was such a small portion and not very good (may be my fault for ordering fish at an Italian restaurant)",UNK
1380,"The yogurt is good, but on more than one occasion I've walked there over my lunch break to find out they were closed (during normal business hours, no sign on the door).  I'd give them more stars if they had reliable hours.",UNK
1381,"The flavors are awesome. This is coming from a person who makes Indian food, so i know flavors and spices a lot.\nI am coming here next time too. I had catfish (Kari Lele) and it was tooo good.",UNK
1382,"Amazing staff, friendly people, great facility! What's not too like? \n\nWell the only negative about his club is that the swimming lap pool isn't on the same level as the gym. It's small and not always clean, a lot of leave and fogy water on some days.",UNK
1383,Went to Vegas a bit TOO much but I wanted to take my brother there (family trip this time) and it was CLOSED! M&M world is 24 hours (or pretty much 24 hours) but this place was closed by like 4PM...boo!,UNK
1384,"The worst! All the staff (manager included) were just standing around talking, the floors were so slick and dirty it was hard to walk, and the bathroom was horrible. And to add a cherry on top the health score was a 92.... avoid at all cost!",UNK
1385,This museum is a must if you are interested in history. It is truly top notch. Dozens of perfectly restored wagons and engines from the last 3 centuries of fire fighting. The descriptions on the walls and in the binder they give you are well written and interesting. This museum is a labor of love and it shows in all the attention to detail.,UNK
1386,They seem a bit disorganized here tonight. I  ordered 30 minutes ago and my order still isn't ready for carryout. They were also out of the original pan pizza that I ordered so they substituted it on their own. I think I will use another location next time even though this was the most convenient.,UNK
1387,"The pineapple and the strawberry gelato a are fantastic! However, I had to downgrade my overall rating as they do not take AMEX.",UNK
1388,"lovely lunch spot for a meeting right in the hotel.  loved my choice of the tacos but there are other just as good.  Atmosphere good and the wait staff is fabulous!  Don't ask for sweet tea, just saying if you are from Georgia.",UNK
1389,"Eaten here a few times. It's not bad by any means but nowhere as good as the SF location in both food quality, service and overall experience. \n\nLobster pot pie was a little runny and watery at this location but they do have Fois Gras here.",UNK
1390,Had an old review but I've moved on. Going to find other places to shop with more atmosphere and good vibes. Not feeling it here anymore.,UNK
1391,I had a pastrami bagel and the meat was dry and unappetizing. I'm not incentivized to go back. My BF also had a bagel and hasn't suggested we go again even though we live right there...\n\nEating area seemed clean and service was average.,UNK
1392,"hmm undefeated is weakkk in vegas. Selection is average. I think Suite 160 in mandalay bay has a better line up.  Air yezzy , ato matsumo's, AJ fusion's, nike LDV,  ive got them so im looking for exclusivity.",UNK
1393,"I think this restaurant deserves more than 3 stars. My girlfriend and I did the groupon and saved 10 dollar on our bill.\n\nFood was pretty good; will admit that the Strip pricing was a little hard to swallow, but the quality of service was great.\nI will be going back.",UNK
1394,"Had lunch with my wife, the food was okay but the service was HORRIBLE! will never go back! Girl was so so rude! Threw our check on the table without acknowledging us or even thanking us.",UNK
1395,"The subs are tasty -- I like the Turkey Bacon Ranch -- however, if you take it with you, expect it to be a bit soggy from condensation or whatever.",UNK
1396,"Two Scottish breakfasts for 10 pounds!\n\nThat's the selling point here. Simple food (great bacon), decent coffee, and friendly service. This was the perfect place for a late breakfast on a grey, rainy morning.",UNK
1397,"Eaten here a couple of times and everytime I feel like I\""m walking into something from the Sopranos.  Good steaks, attentive wait staff",UNK
1398,Service is very good! Lots better than the Henderson location.. Our server was very knowledgable about the food! The black and green burger is a must try item as well as the pan fried edamame!,UNK
1399,"Liked the place..had the type of fabric i was looking for, just not the color.  must have patience to go through the fabrics since its some what orgazined.",UNK
1400,"Great atmosphere, but double charged my card and its been 3 weeks and no refund... no manager in house.. never answers phone",UNK
1401,"definitely one of my favorite steakhouses, next to mastros. the steak was cooked perfectly and the sides were delicious. the decor and ambience were perfect too.",UNK
1402,"I ordered for delivery, they did not include cheese on my sandwich, the pizza was stone cold, but the worst part was how rude the worker was when I called.  I will never do business with them again even if they gave me everything for free, HORRIBLE",UNK
1403,"went here with a friend- the food was exceptionally mediocre. I am not sure who is giving the 5 stars, since it was over priced and quality was just ok. Need to have Persian food in LA to know how good it can get.",UNK
1404,Only thing good is the garlic parm  wings. There's not a lot of meat on them and all the other flavors are disgusting,UNK
1405,"Great familiy owned middle eastern restaurant.  The food is great, serivce is fantastic, and everyone is very friendly.",UNK
1406,Great sandwiches.  Cool spot.  Very chill.\n\nI went to the grand opening last week and he served little roasted pork toasties that were awesome.  \n\nI've been back a couple of times.  Glad to support a local business and talented chef.,UNK
1407,Came here for the Catfish Sloppy Joe recommended by Oprah. It was good but not mind blowing as Oprah has exaggerated. The clam chowder was good enough for seconds.,UNK
1408,maybe the big portion of food really scares me! It is too oily for me and four ppl only finished a quarter of the whole portion.,UNK
1409,"A well organized Half Price Books. They have a nice selection of modern and classic books, comics, with a special selection of rare/first-edition books too. There is a small selection of games, and some CDs, DVDs, and records for sale as well.",UNK
1410,Wow so delicious! We've been here about 5 times and the quality and service remains top notch. We will continue to visit as it's so good.,UNK
1411,So far so good. Nothing that is a wow factor right now.  I would suggest Hershey world. It is a cool place to visit.,UNK
1412,"I love the food but their service is SO BAD.  Like you've got to be kidding me bad.  I've stopping in here due to that reason.  And if you call an order in, tell them a pickup time about 10 minutes earlier than you actually need it - otherwise expect to wait.",UNK
1413,"Fairly expensive for the food they provide. Service is so so. Only got drinks when asked. Sashimi is sliced too thick, feels like you are eating raw fish fillet than sashimi.",UNK
1414,"Seriously great ball park.We had great seats 3 rows back halfway between home & 1st, but i dont think there is a bad seat in this park. Amazing view over the river & the downtown area of Pittsburgh.......... & of course the Red Sox won!!",UNK
1415,The food here is mediocre. I can probably make the same thing I've had here at home. It's also way over priced. Don't waste your money on an easy Mac Alfredo pasta or a Las Vegas steak strip hard rock bread sandwich!,UNK
1416,"The drinks were tasty and the atmosphere is great. Some of our dishes were great, but you couldn't help but notice salt as a major player in most of the dishes. Over-salted food is never fun.",UNK
1417,Pretty decent location for a nice target store.\nWhen I lived in the area I would frequent this target location and was happy with the service and product selection.\nLocated in the surprise town center shopping district alongside many great shops.,UNK
1418,The pizza is like a better little Caesars. Nothing special. I just went here because Mama Mia's was closed due to plumbing issues.,UNK
1419,"The Best Gelato in the West, by fare. The Chicken Panini is very addictive, a great sandwhich that you must try. They only make so many every day so pre-ordering by phone is a good idea.",UNK
1420,Sexy...Naked...Lesbian...Man Lovin!\n\nAgree with others: humor is dorky. But the acts themselves are amazing.,UNK
1421,"Friendly staff, nice open seating and good burger choices. Build your own or pick one the specialty combos. Drink refills at your leisure as well.\nBurgers are done well as are the sides so a semi-gourmet burger with all you can drink for under 10.00.",UNK
1422,can i admit something to you?\n\ni was more impressed with their build-your-own salad than their famous mac-n-cheese pizza.\n\ndo you still love me?\n\n\n\n\nbut i am still definitely eager to try their other weird specialty slices.,UNK
1423,"Not bad... \n\n\nNot in love with the salsas.. they are kind of too sweet. Chicken was spicy and the burrito was good.  \n\nJust another burrito place. Not bad, just nothing great. Nothing to me that really makes it stand out.",UNK
1424,"I had the Lobster Burger! Yes, I said Lobster Burger. It was PHENOMENAL! OMG! I have never had anything like it. THE best thing I have ever put in my mouth!\nThe service was impeccable! This place rocks! Open 24/7 too!",UNK
1425,"I tried a take out order, it still took way too long to get the food, but at least it's good and it's the really the only Chinese place in the area",UNK

1427,I come back here many times for the yummy quality of food and the dessert bar.  Wow..everything was so yummy and what can go wrong with all you can eat Gelato.,UNK
1428,Food was great as confirmed by reviews.  However service was extremely slow!  We probably had a new waitress because not once did she apologize for our food taking so long or forgetting my son's beer TWICE. Might try it again just to give the service another chance.,UNK
1429,This review is for the buffet only!   The pasta is what has kept me from  coming back every time I am in Las Vegas!  Keep up with all the good works...Chefs....,UNK
1430,Only good coffee around.  Thank god for this little gem while traveling.  Was not prepared to gain 10lbs from Starbucks type SUGAR Coffee!!!!  Great food and service to boot!!!!!,UNK
1431,winder farms is the biggest rip-off ever!! \noverpriced food. \nhidden fees.\nautomatically enroll you in weekly deliveries. \n$50+ cancellation fee if you cancel before 40 deliveries.,UNK
1432,Ugh. Never again. This is by far the WORST Chinese food I have EVER had. Trust me on this one! STAY AWAY!,UNK

1436,Tried this place when killing some time before an appointment. Did a happy hour glass of wine and chips. Nice place with friendly staff.,UNK
1437,"Best fucking park in baseball. Tickets are reasonably priced and the view is awesome of the downtown skyline. I try to go to visit other parks every year, and this was my first time to PNC. This is just an all around awesome park and it puts my Nationals Park to shame.",UNK
1438,"Excellent hotel, great attention to detail, polite staff and helpful dealers. \n\nSushi joint on the 3rd floor has an amazing vibe. \n\nRooms on the North side with a view of the Bellagio water show are amazing.",UNK
1439,"Food was pretty good. Coffee was awful. Service was pitiful. We waited 15 minutes for our coffee before breakfast. Waitress disappeared for that whole time. The food came and -- oops-- she forgot about the coffee, water and OJ. Breakfast over, and she was nowhere to be found again. Will not go back.",UNK
1440,"The burgers are fresh and hearty, but the lettuce provided kept falling out of my burger. But overall the guacamole bacon cheeseburger was fantastic! The fries could've used a little less salt.",UNK
1441,Service was so-so not sure who our waiter was and we sat without drinks for long periods of time. It wasn't very busy. Don't order any water it tasted like it came out if a dusty garden hose. They told me from the last storm it started tasting that way,UNK
1442,"Everything we got was amazing, the cheese curds were perfect. I can honestly say this was the best burger I have had in Madison. The Prime Rib was delicious as well. Great atmosphere. Best bar",UNK
1443,"Nothing I had here stood out. Mediocre, or worse.\nWe had some apps, and the Ramen, in particular, was bad.\nWill not be going back.",UNK
1444,"Stay away.  I've eaten at the Pink Taco three times and got food poisoning twice.  I should have known better, but I thought the first food poisoning event was a fluke and decided to go back.  What a mistake.",UNK
1445,Had lunch here today. The salad I had was crisp and fresh. The chicken had a great taste. The portions were very good. \nThe place was clean. The service was fine. \nFor fast food and selection we will be back.,UNK
1446,"Worst I have ever had. Waited more than an hour in line. Line is not so long. It just doesn't really move. Looks like it will need another 20 minutes to get to desk. Will never rent with them again.\nUsed several other rental companies before. Budget, etc. They are so much better.",UNK
1447,McCarran airport is the worst.  It's 4:30 am with only 3 lanes open at the security check point. Unacceptable!  TSA truly stands for Thousands Standing Around!  They Also love to Take S#1+ Away.,UNK
1448,"As an 8-year vet here its obviously a good enough spot to stay a member, but unfortunately the facility ins constantly deteriorating at a faster rate than its being fixed.  With the constant new members, you would think the sign-up fees could help pay for some remodeling!",UNK
1449,regular donuts=75 cents\napple burrito=1.10\ndozen donut holes=1.00\nbring cash for what may be the best donuts in Vegas.,UNK
1450,"Two visits...would have been a 3 star but on the second---and for the second time, they were just CLOSED with no reason why. (yes the hours on the window said they were to be open)...\n\nFood was good but pricey. Service does not match the food.",UNK
1451,Great place to grab a few unique pieces that'll step up your style game. While you're there you can take a gander at the avant guard art on display too.,UNK
1452,"this is place is the best!! great sevice and a place to smoke cigars in phoenix. Come check this place out, not to be missed",UNK
1453,Julie will not take time to go over the itemized deductions with you. She charges way too much too. I suggest you do it yourself through turbotax instead.,UNK
1454,"Best place to have your taxi cab driver or DD drive through to pick up monster tacos and an oreo shake that you will greatly enjoy while still inebriated, but completely regret the next morning! Yeah, buddy!",UNK
1455,"Not too big of a fan of this Best Buy, but they still generally always have what I want. I hate being hassled when I'm looking at computers, but at least the staff is knowledgeable.",UNK
1456,Paco's is a nice place to hang out and have some decent American style Tex-Mex in a convenient location. Nice atmosphere and you can certainly tell this is a Cantina sibling. For authentic food go to Tacqueria Mexico....,UNK
1457,"Great crust ,Good sauce but very cheap with the sausage.So if your'e like me and want more than a half of link for an 18\"" pizza, order 3 times the sausage.Only other complaint, they will not cook them well done unless you stand there and repeatedly ask them to put it back in the oven.",UNK
1458,"Great customer service. Got me in very quickly, which is always nice. Every customer that came in while I was there seemed to be handled the same way I was.",UNK
1459,"I walked in and noticed a cashier counting money from the cash register. I asked her for a pie. Without washing her hands from counting dirty dollars and coins, she picks up a pie from a bakers rack full of other pies and places my pie in a pie box. Disgusting.",UNK
1460,"I can't count how many times I have eaten here. I left Vegas a few years ago and every time I visit, I make sure I eat here at least once during my stay. You can't go wrong with a capistrami or a bobbie. Both are delicious.",UNK
1461,Everything tastes soooo good and comes in very generous proportions.. good for small groups. not alot of seating. long lines on saturday and sunday morning.,UNK
1462,Tasted the MTL a table menu and was very disappointed. Expected more from the main dish (carrots and porc) -- the burger was not special either \nAlthough the service and ambience are friendly and cosy the food is under-par,UNK
1463,"I've had the opportunity to sample a few of the gourmet thin-crust pizza offerings here, all have been fantastic - and that's a big compliment coming from a native of the Land Of Pizza (Chicago)!  The wine bar next door is a pleasant place to relax while waiting for your table.",UNK
1464,"My favorite movie theater hands down! Never packed, great employees, good snacks and don't forget $6 Tuesday's with $2 hot dogs and $2 small popcorn. We try to get to this theater as often as we can.",UNK
1465,"Very nice atmosphere if you like walking around looking at casino and shops.\n\nHowever, this place is way overpriced, with $10 cocktails.",UNK
1466,"Over sold with the 9.99 a month membership, trainers are rude and need to workout more themselves ( a female trainer was enjoying her latte while working with a client ) equipment is crappy ( tears in the bench coverings ) definitely will be finding another gym....",UNK
1467,"Great spa... If you don't mind spending a few bucks, this is the place for you. Neat water fall room, roof top pool, and eucalyptus room! I've had multiple massages here & they were exceptional. Outstanding customer service too.",UNK
1468,"Entertaining and Tasty\n\nThe chefs are a blast, they are really well trained and entertaining, especially Daniel...that guy is a blast. Great steak, great shrimp, all around good food. It's Benihana, the place has been around since the 60's for a reason.",UNK
1469,"Really a great lounge to enjoy a drink. Minus one star because the two drinks I ordered they were out of the components. At our waitresses suggestion, I tried another cocktail and did not enjoy it. I would have sent it back but she never returned.",UNK
1470,"Great pizza! No complaints at all on the food!  So-so service :( Waitress forgot our order, didn't acknowledge it, didn't offer to recover the service in any way.  Improve the service and you would have a lifetime customer...",UNK
1471,I came to visit from the west coast & was looking for a place to find unique souvenirs and someone recommended this place and I came across a lot of neat art work and other stuff. I really liked the items that they had.,UNK
1472,"Good donuts, fresh, always a treat to pick up a dozen or so to share with co-workers.  We first moved to Vegas, it was fun trying the different donut shops, now that we have been here a while, Krispy Kreme has stayed fresh.",UNK
1473,"Meh... I am not a fan. I went here for happy hour one time, and I was beyond disappointed. They must've had their D list chefs working... Cuz my food was GROSS. I couldn't even finish it. Kinda sucks spending that much money on nasty sushi.",UNK
1474,"As in the name, a pub type atmosphere.  Food was way overpriced for pub food. $10 for a wedge salad and $12 for a burger.  Service was mediocre, waitress seemed more interested in helping out some friends than customers.",UNK
1475,Best Resort in AZ\n\nGot Married here May of 2012 and it was amazing. \n\nHighly recommend for\n\nWeddings\nPool side party\nbusiness meetings,UNK

1477,"Sat down with my fiance at the main bar and was greeted within 5 seconds by \""Jordan\"" male who said the other Jordan female would be right over. After about 10 minutes we got passed by 5 times by a Barback and 2 other bartenders. I left thirsty and went to blue martini. Much happier here!",UNK
1478,"Food is ok and owner is a jerk, go to Jose Roux if you want a good burrito and great service.  Sad because I normally eat here when passing through.",UNK
1479,Happy hour review.\n\nTheir portobello happy hour app is awesome.  We weren't crazy about antyhing else.,UNK
1480,"Do not go here, they charge too much for what you get and rip you off with the ion foot detox, which is a total hoax, these guys should be put out of business.",UNK
1481,"Food was good, service was below average, empty booths and you make sit at a small table. Drinks need to come out faster. Average at best!",UNK
1482,Came here a few months back and thought to try again after pretty bad customer service.  we stood in the line with no one ahead of us while two employees carried on with their  conversation.  Food was good but service left me a bad taste for this restaurant.,UNK
1483,"Five stars for the breakfast skillets. The one with bacon/sausage/eggs is delicious and the best of its kind that I've had anywhere.\n\nThe place is in one of the oldest buildings in downtown Gilbert, with adobe walls that lean 5-10 degrees but have not fallen down.",UNK
1484,I love this place. They are hardcore Korean chefs and owner.\nYou probably get better deal just order off the happy hour menu over the all you can-eat. The quality of food is great here and it's a little gem I am so glad to discover !,UNK
1485,"I feel like the interior of \""Herb 'n Flavors\"" is still developing, but the food and service is wonderful!  The menu offers selections for any dietary restriction you can throw at it.  I look forward to frequenting this establishment.",UNK
1486,Gimmick - they say no enrollment fee but they want 69 admin fee.  Whatever. The other lifetime fitness is only 69 enrollment. \nBullshit,UNK
1487,"I will never spend a single cent in this establishment because they use the extortioners \""Wheel Blockers\"" - do not park and enter this establishment if you do not want your car booted and to be treated terribly by shady characters.",UNK
1488,Our favorite restaurant in the Valley!  Best filet mignon in town!  Lobster mashed potatoes are delicious.  Dungeness crab cocktail is amazing!  \nAll sides are wonderful.  Service is top-drawer,UNK
1489,Michael catered our meeting and the food was very tasty. I am very picky of what I eat in public. I was very impressed. I will have him cater my next function at my office. His pricing is dang cheap for what ypu get for your money. I highly suggest you try him.,UNK
1490,"Ate brunch here and I liked their selection of food.. not normally a fan of buffets but after eating at MGM buffet, it made this place look good.",UNK
1491,Love Baker Wee!  They did a fantastic job on our wedding cake.  The delivery was on time and the cake was delicious.  They even offer an anniversary cake for the one year anniversary.  We were not able to take them up on the offer because we moved.  I miss their yummy desserts!,UNK
1492,Maybe it is just this particular In-N-Out but the burgers were blah and boring.  I seem to recall having better ones at the In-N-Out in California. Not worth the hype or the calories.,UNK
1493,"This is a great place for all occasions. Great prices, great food, and great ambiance. Try the Kung Pao spaghetti, it's BOMB!!!!!",UNK
1494,"Bad attitude. When I ask for Mindy, she said yes I am, then she just went to out side. Few mins later when she is back. She just ignore us. Come on! we just wanna ask some info! Is this how they take care their clients? \u51f8*_*",UNK
1495,This place has the hands down best uni i have ever tasted in my life!! + sushi melts in your mouth. So fresh at the perfect temperature. I fell in love with their sushi so much that i still cant forget the taste.. the first place i am headed when i goto vegas :),UNK
1496,Beautiful garden's with crazy amazing views of Edinburgh.  There is a gorgeous fountain towards the end where you can get a great shot of Edinburgh castle in the background.  When I was there it was all decked out for the Olympics.  A nice change of pace from the hustle and bustle on the streets of Edinburgh.,UNK
1497,"Not very good. Dried out food. Some things cold, when they should be hot. Disappoined overall. Not clean, either. 11.99 per person not worth it.",UNK
1498,"I love everything Arizona, this place brings that love and the love of good beer together. I stuck with the Wabayuma Wit, an easy Belgian style beer brewed with a local tea.",UNK
1499,What is all the fuss about?  The pizza was mediocre with minimal cheese and sauce and the crust was so chewy it was too much work.  Have to stay with my regular place though the cannoli's were excellent and the antipasto salad looked beautiful.,UNK
1500,Fantastic pedicure!!! Came here with my wife and had a very relaxing wonderful treatment.\n\nThis is the first salon I've been in that I'd seen other guys at. Four men in the shop at the same time.,UNK
1501,"Nothin' really special about this place. It's clean and host sporting events. Staff is always friendly and available if you need assistance. Does the job but like Sun Devil Stadium, it could use a makeover.",UNK
1502,"Great food, good prices and LOTS of it. Had pork and the chicken and waffles (you have to do that if you visit here). Be prepared for huge amounts of goodness. Good service too. Located inside the Plaza Hotel on Fremont and Main. Open way late.",UNK
1503,"This nightclub is way over hyped. I just keep going back because they have the best DJs perform (Tiesto, Calvin Harris, etc). The club itself is way too small. By midnight on a weekend, you will not be able to move at all.",UNK
1504,2 the food was meh (i had the appetizers combo) but the music was good. There was no line which was also a big perk. Apparently the pulled pork sandwich was good and the burgers looked really good as well. I wouldn't recommend the appetizers platter or the bbq platter though.,UNK
1505,"My go to mainstream cinema in Charlotte. Being in a nice area and I have never had to deal with annoying teenagers, I know it sounds bad seeing how I am only 23 but I do not want to hear you talk/text in the cinema. It is also kept up nicely, Regal always seems to be much better kept than AMC.",UNK
1506,Found this little gem of a restaurant last time I was driving through Wickenburg.  The food was amazing and the decor was the perfect western shabby chic mix.,UNK
1507,"We had hopes for this place when it re-opened, but it didn't really change much. Skip it. Mediocre Chinese and bad Thai. Keep driving if you want Asian food, nothing in Boulder City. We need a good Thai place!!!",UNK
1508,"This place is a lifesaver,  the gentlemen inside was very helpful and helped us with a custom size box just what we needed.  They have every kind of box in there,  for guitars, dishes, big and small and custom!   Great prices, and easy to find.  I can highly recommend.",UNK
1509,"I thought that the burritos here are ok, but nothing special. Not too similar to Chipotle in my opinion, except for that they both serve the same type of food. The chicken quesadilla is by far the best thing on the menu, but other than that I have nothing to add to the previous review.",UNK
1510,I live in abq and my mom lives in Vegas.  I called Rhonda to place an order for mother day because it's near where my mom's house.  Their service is extraordinary and very friendly. I Highly recommended.,UNK
1511,"Great service!  Can't wait to go back.  It's hard to find a LFS that you can trust,  but this one you sure can!  Thanks,  and good job.",UNK
1512,"OK food. Nothing great, mall food\n Good food a hold lunch if you happen to be at the mall. Rain forest cafe has much better food but does cost more. Staff friendly and looked clean. I would go back.  I had the Phily finest cheese steak meal.",UNK
1513,Not my favorite place for Pho. I think Panda Express has better fried rice and their was a bug in my egg roll sauce. Egg rolls were over fried. They may have a good location but I will definitely go somewhere else for Pho,UNK
1514,Love this place! I've gotten my nails done by jack two times and I love them! I used to go to diamond nails on rainbow but the last couple of times... I've had to wait over 30 mins even though they told me it would only be 5 or 10. Would definitely recommend angels nail and spa!,UNK
1515,that didn't take long to close! \n\nThis place was way overrated the service was terrible.   I shouldn't spend $16.00 for just a burger ala cart and still leave the place hungry.   It wont be missed!,UNK
1516,This was my second visit to fuego bistro. Had apps and sangria the 1st time. Dinner last night was beyond spectacular ..... All 3 of us can't say enough good things about how amazing all their food is.  This is a must go place  You won't be disappointed!,UNK
1517,The food is bland. There is nothing bout this place that would make me want to come back. The service is crap and the cashier tried to convince me that they didn't remodel a few months ago. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. Unless u want to spend your money on mediocre food.,UNK
1518,"bunky provides something unique downtown that i desire. \n\nthere is a small selection, hence boutique, but it is all amazing. my first visit was at least an hour, going through each item of clothing, each with its own personality. the accessories are amazing.",UNK
1519,This review isn't directed at this specific store but at CenturyLink as a whole.  This is by far the worst company I have ever dealt with for any type of service.  I have had them for residential and dropped them due to their terrible customer service and horrific internet service.,UNK
1520,"Excellent food, service, and atmosphere.  We had dumplings, soup, entrees served family style.  Every dish was delicious and expertly prepared.  The service was flawless and well-paced.  Can't go wrong eating here.",UNK
1521,I love this place! They have an outdoor band and inside DJ! For a night out of dancing this is where we go with our friends!,UNK
1522,"This is the most inconsistent restaurant I've ever been to. Sometimes it's very good and others, it's average -- and at this price point average quality and service isn't acceptable.\n\nIf you have an issue with anything here, be prepared to explain yourself. #customerservicefail",UNK
1523,This La Canasta is very close to me so unfortunately I go here for my green burrito cravings. The staff is very friendly but the food is not fresh Im assuming because they dont have a real kitchen and the portions are a lot smaller than you get at the other chains. The menu is also a lot smaller.,UNK
1524,They need better beer if I will ever get my husband to go back. The best they had was kilt lifter. No IPA.,UNK
1525,"Typical Vegas nightclub.\nIf you like spending hella money on drinks and getting pushed and shoved on the dancefloor and even in your vip area... go here.  Music is also typical mainstream, mash-up, dougie, booty poppin stuff.  Not really my steez.",UNK
1526,"It's a HUGE slice and a fair price but, other than that, I don't share the enthusiasm for Mamma Mia's. It's just \""OK.\""",UNK
1527,"If you ever have no idea where to eat, head to The Palazzo. They have so many different and delicious restaurants under one roof. You may be overwhelmed.\nThen there's the shopping and the shows! \nI've never had the pleasure of staying here, but we find ourselves heading to the Palazzo for one reason or another.",UNK
1528,"We really like this place and come frequently for lunch.  The \""bun\"" (salad with noodles, letttuce and grilled items) is great.  Service is also good and friendly.  The main waitress always knows us and remembers what we order.",UNK
1529,"Hosted a part of 20 no problem. Issue - we all ordered margaritas and mojitos. Everyone complained that the drinks were watered down. My Fresa Mojito definitely was a $12 minty strawberry club soda. \n\nIf you come here, it's safe to get the beer.",UNK
1530,Lunch in Las Vegas does not have the power element like most other cities as everyone is on vacation! Milo's on the other hand has become my favorite new lunch restaurant to eat and be seen. With an amazing prefix menu this is the spot to be.,UNK
1531,"$7.99 for a sandwich, chips & a drink. I had the brisket & it was so so tasty! Can't wait to go back.",UNK
1532,"awful, they do not wear gloves when preparing foods\nthey put aluminum foil on the sandwiches when you cut the sandwich\nthe aluminum foil gets in the sandwich\n\nTHEY DO NOT WEAR GLOVES, GROSS AND UNHEALTHY.",UNK
1533,This place is adorable! \n\nDelicious Thai Food made legit style. \n\nWalked in the middle of a work trip and got a delicious meal made to order. \n\nOh yea.,UNK
1534,"My Mom changed from a grass lawn to desert landscape.  Mike, the owner was very difficult to work with and unwilling to make \""satisfaction\"" his guarantee as he states in his company policy!  End result is satisfactory, however incomplete.  We will not recommend this company to anyone.",UNK
1535,"ISolution came out to my home in Chandler and repaired 2 IPad screens, one that I thought was beyond repair.  Not only were they able to repair, they were able to fix corners and make it look almost brand new.  I will be using them to install my tempered screen when I get my new Phones and tablets!",UNK
1536,Absolutely outstanding dinner last night. We did the $100 chefs tasting menu and it was well worth the price. The fish was incredible in taste and quality and the meat was beautifully marbled. Highly recommend for anyone who appreciates top notch sushi.,UNK
1537,"Top notch customer service, great quality and turnaround time! I was happy to find Danna through a friend's recommendation and they did a great job with wonderful customer service! \n\nCouldn't be happier! We will be back!",UNK
1538,"The music is great here and the atmosphere is pretty cool, too. However Blue Moon by the bottle is $4.25. pretty pricey if you ask me. Very casual dress, but I'll be back if I'm in town.",UNK
1539,"A staple on state street. White brat, red brat and cheese curds all very good. Fun atmosphere to chill and have some drinks.",UNK
1540,really good! I love the turkey cranberry sandwich! it was awesome! the cookies are to die for! only downfall is there are alil to pricey for a sandwich!,UNK
1541,"I did not feel safe here. When you arrive, there are signs in the parking lot that say \""don't keep valuables in car\"".....or something like that. I ended up checking out early so that none of my things would be stolen by the gangta staff.",UNK
1542,Very tasty.  Great beer selection.  Lots of vegetarian selections.  Family friendly but also solid for a date night or random dinner out.   Pretzel appetizer is great; cosmic karma pizza can't go wrong.,UNK
1543,Nothing spectacular but not bad either. If you are going to shop or check out the forum shops then it is worth a stop but choose the patio area over the interior dining area. Selections are better and less pricey. All in all it is a decent place for a light bite while shopping. Get the chicken wing lollipops.,UNK
1544,Best Greek food in the city. \n\nSmall and intimate restaurant with lots of character and atmosphere. Staff are warm and friendly and the food is top notch.\n\nAlso great for families with children.\n\nOne of my favorite restaurants to visit.,UNK
1545,"Excellent food and service.   Busy Friday night, and waters were regularly filled and our server was alway near by.  \n\nThe BBQ spring rolls, grilled cheese and fried chicken sliders were amazing.  The fried s'more was simply over the top.  A must order!",UNK
1546,"Immer nette Berater und eine super Stimmung. Ich bekomm immer genau das, was ich brauche.",UNK
1547,"Picked up a small trailer for a one week rental...took a little while b/c they were busy (a good sign in my book), and the service was very friendly. No issues dropping it off, and they were gracious when I was a little past their normal rental time. I'll def use them again",UNK
1548,"Didn't live up to the hype.  My steak was OK, but all the accompaniments were over salted and the potatoes were underdone.  We tried the arugula salad, heirloom tomatoes, asparagus along with the filet and chicken.  Steak was well crusted but not enough to carry the meal.",UNK
1549,"For those that loves to drink beer, this is the place for you! It is located on the 2nd floor of New York New York Hotel, a very casual place to enjoy lots of different drinks. \n\nIf you want a fast drink or just to relax, you might enjoy this hang out",UNK
1550,"I got the Carne Asada taco dinner. Pretty good. Was still kind of hungry though. The house margarita was below average. Service was good. I'd go back to drink, but thought the food was pricey for the amount you get.",UNK
1551,"The food is fresh (except the meat, which is frozen, which is what knocked the place down a star) and the service is good. For around $9 you can have a bowl full of food, white or brown rice, soup, fried noodles and a drink. The place is clean and you can make your dish however you like.",UNK
1552,"great decor, selection, \""wine flights\"", location was in a nice mall, food was nice, but expensive for what you got.  I probably would not go back.",UNK
1553,"Nice roomy bathrooms, good for families, absolutely no AT&T service here but I didn't mind. It gets old quickly constantly being asked for your trump card to get to your room. Nice place. Will stay he again. Service of th people here is great.",UNK
1554,This place is disgusting! I've tried it multiple times over the past 10 years and still it is truly awful. I keep hoping they'll figure something out for the better.,UNK
1555,"This was our first visit and we will be back. Margaritas were excellent, food great, and fast, friendly service! Overall extremely happy with our experience!",UNK
1556,What can I say....great food and crappy service. The food outweighs the service I. This case. Very rare for me.,UNK
1557,Have the new iPhone 6 with tap n pay? Don't use it here. A gentleman who works here says they are not allowed. Nonsense.,UNK
1558,"I told myself a few years ago I wouldn't go back. I gave you one more shot. Never again! \nMeatball sandwich had two, two meatballs cut in half to make a sandwich. Cheap Fu*cks! All for $8.0.",UNK
1559,The cleaning ladies are very nice and professional. I feel at ease having them in my home. They also are very dependable and punctual!,UNK
1560,One of the best in the city.  BUT!!!!  DO NOT GO THERE IN A CAB!!!!   They will charge you up the arse!,UNK
1561,This was great.  Went in on a Sunday without an appointment and just over 2hours later walked out with an eye exam and new glasses.  All the staff was great and very helpful,UNK
1562,"Too bad that management doesn't know that the high school employees are running this place into the ground while they play on their i-phones and provide second rate customer service. My wife and I love the food especially the sandwiches but don't go simply because of the lousy service.\nSincerely,\nlocal resident",UNK
1563,"A nice venue with overly zealous ushers running up and down the aisles every time someone discretely took a picture with their cellphone, no flashes, not disturbing a soul.   Train your ushers better.  Our concert experience was interrupted numerous times by ushers accosting people nearby who weren't bothering anyone.",UNK
1564,Agree with all previous reviews. This company is one of the worst I have ever dealt with...period. It was literally so bad I felt like I was on some blooper punked show. Avoid them or suffer.,UNK
1565,"The food here is poor. Very poor. The food is also very pricey, adding to the dissappointment. I am only giving it two stars because of the nice ambiance and the friendly staff. I wish I would have looked into this place before I went and I would have stayed away. Please avoid this restaurant.",UNK
1566,Best SPA ever. I and my wife had the best massages and then enjoyed hours of jacuzzi and sauna time. The place is simply phenomenal.,UNK
1567,"What can I say that hasn't been already said? Its good but not great, its priced reasonable but not super cheap, the rooms are clean the bed is comfortable and not too noisy. The layout can be slightly confusing and the parking is a bi..h but its a decent place to stay in mid strip.",UNK
1568,"This place sucked balls !!!! Couldn't find 1 thing I liked . I should've listened to my bro , he told right after he ate here he shit his pants literally !! I have a feeling it might happen to me ... It's worse than hometown buffet I recommend going anywhere else..",UNK
1569,"Best BBQ in Phoenix. No question about it. In fact, I travel a lot for work and it could top any BBQ I've been to on the road. And yes, I've been to the South and Kansas City!",UNK
1570,Elephant day at the zoo yesterday was amazing!!! good day at the zoo. Highly recommended specially now that we are getting a good weather to spend the day outside,UNK

1572,"College kids infatuated with Tommy Chong and the whole pot culture aren't the most discerning food enthusiasts.  This place fits them well.  For the rest of us, it is a decent sandwich in a very cramped space.",UNK
1573,My husband and I are from out of town and walked in here and the guy in there was helpful. I would recommend this place. Thanks guys.,UNK
1574,I have been bringing my cars to Allen for a number of years and also send my customers from my tint shop to Allen! He does a great job and has been doing custom exhaust for over twenty years! My customers often call me and thank me for referring them to AAA Muffler I highly recommend him for all your custom exhaust needs!,UNK
1575,"Coffee is ok, but the place is way too small, stuffy, humid, with overwhelming smell of coffee (NOT in the good way).",UNK
1576,"This place is amazing, inexpensive, and fast!  The staff is also very thoughtful and friendly.  I would recommend it to anyone looking to alter their clothing.",UNK
1577,I have always loved this place and everyone I bring here loves it too. I go at least once a month and never had any problems. Really cool stuff to look and the merchandise is fun too.\n\nThe staff is usually friendly and the prices aren't too high. This is the only place I can find really good smoked meat!,UNK
1578,"This Target is situated in a \""ghost town\"" of a strip mall.  \n\nIf you don't like crowds or long lines, this is the Target for you.",UNK
1579,The food is okay but the service was on point.\n\nMichael was my server and asked for my name the first time he came to the table.  Every time he came back to the table he addressed me by my first name.  Great customer service!,UNK
1580,Wow wow wow! All the food we had here was too notch!! Bootleg burger was fantastic! Can't wait to come back !!,UNK
1581,Okay sandwiches but the To Go counter help needs to be trained better.  Really have no clue about their own restaurant..and when a bubbie is picking like a 1000 different cookies for passover..maybe get some help so orders can be taken.,UNK
1582,Looks western but doesn't feel it!  Cant imagine this as a local bar more a tourist bar.\n\nIt's an okay bar with some good live music.  Staff was nice.,UNK
1583,"It is lovely little theater that offers a great movie experience. Never a crowd, theater is clean and the snacks are what you would expect - popcorn, candy and soda. Stop by Wine Expression before or after and have a great afternoon",UNK
1584,"As stated in another post, I believe this has closed, and been replaced by Rivers American Grill, which i gave 4 star for good bar food.  Apparently they have pizza as well (guess they left the oven behind?).",UNK
1585,Great Mexican food!  I had the shredded beef burro enchilada style and my husband had the cheese and fajita chicken quesadilla.  Both very tasty!  Very big cold beers too for a very reasonable price.  Nice atmosphere in the bar and close to home.,UNK
1586,"My fiancee and I ate here last night and the food was outstanding but the service was shite.  If you are not a celebrity or do not have a large party of spenders, the staff has little time for you.  There are not a lot of vegetarian options and the menu is written all in Italian, just fyi.",UNK
1587,"They have a great beer selection, the food is good regular bar food, and the staff is great. They have a pool table and darts making it a fun place to hang. I'd rather come during the week because it gets crazy busy on the weekend nights.",UNK
1588,"3 rooms. 1 Main dance area w/ hip-top, top-40. Other one was house. and last was also hip-hop, or oldschool, I forgot. Pretty popular spot. Guys paid $30-40, depending...I think ur room key helps u get a discount.",UNK
1589,I was here in 2008 with my gfs and remembered the bar.  I went back this October and made (a different) girlfriend go.  Great beer and whiskey selection.  I love the ambiance and culture of the pub.  The pub was packed for the Irish band.  I just love this place.,UNK
1590,"Very friendly, warm atmosphere at this location.. The skill level of the therapists is A One. the laser hair removal is PAIN free.  Massage and facials could,t get better.  It is a must to try.",UNK
1591,"Large number and wide variety of butterflies and moths.  Excellent customer service, especially Max who goes out of his way to help everyone have a great experience (texting people to let them know when their favorite butterflies and moths are in the pavilion; lending bright vests to kids to increase chances that a butterfly will land on them).",UNK
1592,Its cheap but yoy 100% get what you paying for . I went there first time today I jad to wait to get in when it was no line in front of me . They put my car through washing and it needed little finishes guys who supposed to do that done terrible job my car was still dirty 9 $ to the trash .,UNK
1593,"every time i go here the food is good but they always mess up one thing.  But it is small like, no Sour cream or add rice to my burritto.  So i have to wait for them to make it over again.",UNK
1594,"Really great lunch place located within Planet Hollywood.  Sandwiches are delicious and very fresh- think of it like a much (and I mean much) better high scale Panera.  Compared to other lunch places, Earl wins for their great sandwich selection and low prices.  This is my quick, go to lunch place on the strip.",UNK
1595,"Seems like a good bar atmosphere if that's what you're after, but the pizza is just ok. The other food is pretty good, but portions are not satisfying at all.",UNK
1596,Awesome place great sushi and drinks. Happy hour is awesome. Can't beat 50% off. My wife and I come here at least three times a month or more.,UNK
1597,Been to a few Hard Rocks and they are pretty much the same. Had the Mac and Cheese. Still not as good as Rock Bottom's Mac/Cheese. Great service but had to walk around the building to go into the casino.,UNK
1598,Nasty! I felt like I was at 8th and market in san francisco back in the days when they had all those open-air video arcades. If I was back in college I'd be in the middle of it.,UNK
1599,I dont know what happened here.  The quality and choice of food seems to have gone down in years.  The wait & price for this is NOT worth it anymore.  Rio and Paris are WAY better.,UNK
1600,This was the worst tasting Mexican food I've ever eaten! I tried the chicken in mole and beef tongue in green sauce. My daughter and I left the food there and paid our bill. We will not go back. Ick!,UNK
1601,I get a small pesto pizza and side salad- (and the cheesecake is always great too )- one of my all time fav meals. They are always nice at Pestos. It is a great neighborhood restaurant - and the wine bar is great too.,UNK
1602,"awful place, there are bugs, and the food is not the same and the staff not the same, does not know how to cook kosher, this is not a good jewish deli anymore.",UNK
1603,This place is infamous for having a rude cashier and not having things in stock. Complaints to management here go on deaf ears. I go out of my way to go to the one on Durango cause of so many bad experiences here- this location really gives the brand a bad name!,UNK
1604,THE ABSOLUTE WORST burger I have ever had! The meat patty was so thin I almost missed it. American cheese IS NOT REAL CHEESE and who puts thousand island dressing on anything these days.  All in all just 100% AWFUL. NEVER EVER Again.,UNK
1605,This is the best Mexican food in the area.  It does serve alcohol and has an outside bar even though it is family friendly.  I recommend the fajitas and chi-mi's.,UNK
1606,Wish the store was a little bigger but had a great selection and very nice staff! Store is clean and easy to get through! One of the few stores I've been in that also have a Star Wars selection too!,UNK
1607,Great little sports bar to lounge in and relax.  Plenty of flat screens everywhere with ESPN and all the games.  The bar tenders here are friendly and are heavy handed with their pours!\n\nI also have to say that I think PH has hottest cocktail waitresses in town!,UNK
1608,I was completely creeped out by the host.  He had an attitude from the minute I walked up!!   Very strange and unwelcoming.. I chose not to eat there..  They don't care about customers..,UNK
1609,Great tacos. I had 2 fish and a side of chips and salsa. They are street taco sized but filling nonetheless. Super friendly folks at the counter. I'd go again.,UNK
1610,Conveniently located next door to my work. I come here during my lunch break from time to time. Service is quick and efficient. Sushi is good. Lots of lunch specials to choose from. Nice calm ambience inside.,UNK
1611,First time at a Serendipity. Last time I was in NY I wanted to check it out but it didn't happen so I finally got to try out the one in LV. The frozen hot chocolate is a MUST! The food was okay but overpriced. Probably would only return for dessert.,UNK
1612,1. Bacon wrapped jalapenos\n2. The little crunchy pieces of ice\n3. Awesome local brews on tap\n\nDo you really need to know more??,UNK
1613,"Yummy!  Had the funghi pizza and it was delicious.  Lower stars because husband hated,I mean really hated his lamb sandwich.  Whinged all the way home about having to brush and floss his teeth to get the horrible taste out of his mouth.",UNK
1614,"yucky!\n\nfeels like an establish basement party.  Although its cheap and the drinks are stiff, if I was going to get that atmosphere I'd prefer to pay $5 for all I could drink beer & dollar shots in a college kids house.",UNK
1615,Over rated went there. For breakfast nothing special save a few dollars and go to the regular cafe in Paris for breakfast same type of food but cheaper,UNK
1616,Good spot to sit and watch sports. As far as the food...  it's so-so overall.   Brisket is ok. Fried apps are ok. Nothing to write home about. Great for the convenience if you live nearby.,UNK
1617,"Not \""Chinese food\"".\nJust same things fried in same sauce.\nWill never go unless Iam stuck in the mall and hungry",UNK
1618,"Came here for a work luncheon.  Nice staff.  OK food.  I had the \""under 600\"" meal so maybe that's why the flavor wasn't all there but it was still OK.",UNK
1619,"Ate there @ 430pm, today food was ok, the two waitress shouldn't speak so loud about the customers, \u8033\u8bed\u5546\u8c08.",UNK
1620,This place is amazing! Their pizza and their service is just excellent! I highly recommend the Humble Pie! You just can't go wrong with it!,UNK
1621,"Unfortunately, this establishment is the worst Panda I have been to. They had only one server/cashier at 6pm for the dinner rush. On top of that, the guy barely spoke English and had several issues when ordering. :( sad.",UNK
1622,We tried to order for delivery because we are 4 miles away. On their menu it says $15 minimum. We called to place the order and we were told today it's a $75 minimum. We found that insane so never ordered.,UNK
1623,"Food decent, but don't ever leave your camera there and call to see if they found it.  I was told I must have left it somewhere else.  I insisted I left it there because I remembered just that. I got hung up on.  Twice. Management and owner are total d-bags!",UNK
1624,"If I had a choice between the Wynn and Encore I'd select the latter. I've stayed at the Wynn and wasn't impressed at all. During my recent trip to Vegas, I walked through the Encore and it had a much better vibe...more light and happier staff.",UNK
1625,"When going from Tempe to Old Town, the big orange bus is definitely the way to go.  Get a group of at least 5 people together and it's only $3 per person.  The drivers are usually very friendly (and attractive) and arrive on time!",UNK
1626,Great little bar.  I had the hard wood cocktail which is made with Jamesons and was very good.  Scored a great seat on one of the couches which was really nice.,UNK
1627,"Not great at all!  If I could give this place a zero I would!  I ordered one thing and was given another and not even asked if they could replace with what I ordered when I took it back.  The chips are not even chips, they are like cinnamon pita chips.  I would not recommend this place at all!",UNK
1628,"3 stars for the hotel\n-1 because it doesn't live up to a Sheraton standard...\n\nThis is an old run down Sheraton.  Still a nice place to stay, but it needs an update.  \n\nNice pool btw...",UNK
1629,"This place is amazing.  It's a bit expensive, but the food is delicious - fresh and unique.  I'm looking forward to going back, though at the price it'll be more of a special-occasion excursion.",UNK
1630,"The food over all was good, but it's pretty ordinary.  It's not super expensive, but it's not cheap either.  I have to say that with the food like this, the price should be a bit lower.  I liked the carpaccio though.",UNK
1631,"One of my Cali friends kept telling me about this place and I'm glad she did! I tried the chili dog, which was very tasty and kept me full for a long time! Only thing is if you eat outside... WATCH OUT FOR THE HUNGRY BIRDS!",UNK
1632,"Shop here, shop here now.\nShop here, shop here, shop here now.\nNOW NOW NOW NOW NOW.",UNK
1633,"I have always wanted to try this place we don't have any in Florida. My thoughts is jack can stay I the box. It only got a star cause you have to do something. The food was awful, nasty just no!!",UNK
1634,This place has good food.  They were better when they operated out of a truck but I go there from time to time.  I've had their steak tacos and enchilladas platter.  It's pretty good.,UNK
1635,All you can eat sushi\nSome fish smelled little fishy\nSoft Shell crab was great\nPrices is reasonable for quality,UNK
1636,"The 'burlesque' in the show was pretty limited. I was actually disappointed. The girls were attractive and talented dancers, but I really was anticipating at least a taste of Burlesque as the name implies.",UNK
1637,"BEST mac and cheese EVER.  BEST Pomme Frites EVER.  A place that gets a visit every time were in Scottsdale.  Always crowded, but great european atmosphere (and \""backyard\"" patio seating).  Come for the excellent side dishes and a few drinks!",UNK
1638,I only came here to grab a glass of red wine but I was very impressed by how friendly the bartenders were.  I wish I had had a chance to eat here because I heard from some industry friends that they had good meals here.  Thank you to the bartenders for probably being the best in the Wynn. :),UNK
1639,"Holy second-hand smoke, Batman!  I think I contracted lung cancer during my 4 hour visit.\n\nThat's all.",UNK
1640,"Driver arrived early and beat me to the train station. Car was clean and comfy. The driver was friendly throughout the ride but also let me just chill out when I stopped talking. He even added the nice touch of handing me a bottle of Fiji water for the ride. \n\nAll in all, great service! I recommend it.",UNK
1641,Great steak experience! We had an awesome experience with the server last year; this year he's average but the food is a. Ma. Zing as always!,UNK
1642,"Not my favorite at all, it was just ok. I would like to try the buffet though. I just did not think the flavors were all there.",UNK
1643,"Good prices, but terrible customer service. The people that work there were not friendly at all. I wouldn't go back, I don't care how much cheaper they are. Would it hurt them to smile and say please and thank you?",UNK
1644,"Excellent service! Kind, friendly, compassionate employees, techs and docs. Large waiting room with free wifi. X-rays done on site. VERY CLEAN! Wish they were 24hrs... I was able to get my daughter in and out quickly and made it to work on time!",UNK
1645,"The food was okay, the chicken parmigiana was decent, but not worth a return trip.  The sauce on the pasta tasted like chef boyardee.  Over all not impressed and I won't be trying it again.",UNK
1646,Great deal and great food. Especially breakfast. Its not the fanciest place. But i come here everytime i'm in LV.,UNK
1647,"Decent food mostly. Nothing spectacular. Scallops were gritty which is pretty off-putting . Service was not good, the waitress seemed to take issue with just about any request and forgot items on several occasions. If the service were better I'd consider returning since the location is nice, but I can spent my money better elsewhere.",UNK
1648,Waited 10 minutes to be seated at a time with plenty of open tables.  It's now 25 minutes after I ordered and still no food. Last time for this guy!,UNK
1649,This place has certainly gone down hill!\nWe were rushed through our meal....the waitress asked us if we wanted dessert while I was eating my meal...literally had just gotten it.\nBread isn't fresh and hot like it used to be....sauce for pastas were bland.,UNK
1650,I brought in one of my collector cars a 1999 Cadillac Fleetwood Limited. I saw my usual service advisor Jeff Hathcock who I absolutely appreciate for his professionalism and he is just overall-WONDERFUL to deal with. It completely makes the whole experience of paying to have the cars serviced at the dealership more than worth it.,UNK
1651,"If the price sounds too good to be true, it is because it is.  I have gotten good results with laser hair removal elsewhere.  When I didn't get any results at simplicity, I complained and they wouldn't give me the time a day.",UNK
1652,"We have enjoyed the food and the beer selection. Just make sure you check your bill. After a bad experience, we will likely not go back.",UNK
1653,"Although this is a Pho place (for soup), I always order B\u00fan bi ch gi\u00f2 and it is amazing.  Yes, #81 was delicious.  What a concept, going out to eat to then cook your own food.  Definitely, one of the better Vietnamese Restaurants in Vegas.",UNK
1654,"Make sure you read the \""Filtered\"" review to get the REAL truth about this \""dentist\""... Ain't censorship grand? You write a review to warn people about some thieving fraud, and the review gets \""filtered\""....",UNK
1655,I want to eat here everyday! We had a great dining experience and enjoyed our meals. I had the ahi tuna and the boyfriend had the kobe steak. They have a nice wine list and I though the service was great!,UNK
1656,Food is really good and very nice waitress...Restaurant is very spacious  and try Lassi...Sambar is very tasty.,UNK
1657,Service is always warm and friendly here. Who says you need to pay a load of money to eat great tasting food? just $10 is good enough at this spot. try it out!,UNK
1658,"Horrible food.  Whoever came up with this menu should be, and probably is, ashamed.  And those among us who are rating this place as anything other than \""pitiful,\"" must eat frozen TV dinners at home.  The food is truly as bad as I've ever had--anywhere.",UNK
1659,"Great food low prices, what more could you ask for?! everything is excellent and authentic. We always get the duck fried rice and chicken pad se-eu.",UNK
1660,"I love this place, it is so good! If you want good fry bread that tastes almost homemade this is the place to go.",UNK
1661,We were here on KY Derby day and while the betting was fun the service bordered on discriminatory. We were walked by at least 7 times without being acknowledged that we were there at our table. This while the table beside us got service and backslaps every 5 minutes. We walked out. Do not go here.,UNK
1662,"This used to be one of my favorite places as a child b/c of the Knights of Excalibur show.  Then 10 years later, I realized how tacky this place was but it's a good, cheap option.",UNK
1663,The last 3 times I had lunch here has been bad. 1 time what we ordered and what we got were not even close.  Ok chalk it up to a mistake the next time chicken fingers that had so much grease it dripped off of it just holding it up.,UNK
1664,"Had high hopes, perhaps that was the problem. \n\n- nice atmosphere\n- awful wines\n- sub par escargot\n- great steak with merlot reduction \n- skate wing (sting ray) was decent\n- trout was over salted\n- mussels were decent",UNK
1665,"Found this place on Yelp, figured we would try today after Church. Had the Pulled Pork, rib tips, potato salad and greens. Plus sweet tea, others had the pulled pork Sammie's. We loves this place, better than Famous Dave & Dickies!",UNK
1666,"This was the worst show I have ever seen,  it is just awfull, do not waste your money, I saw at least a dozen people walk out, many other shows in Vegas to see that are worth the money.",UNK
1667,I have been going here since this location opened. They have new equipment and I never have to wait for a treadmill or elliptical machine since they have so many.  Also you can't beat $10 a month with no contract.,UNK
1668,"I love Yogurtland, and this location is pretty good. They have lots of flavors and toppings. It can get crowded at night and they seem to run out of some flavors which can be sort of annoying. If you use your frequent buyer card or whatever though you can get your froyo for a super good price.",UNK
1669,"The pizza itself is not very impressive, but they do put pretty good ingredients into their weird concoctions.  Its just that I don't really see the point of eating steak and fries on top of a piece of cardboard.  But it is good sometimes (i.e., when you're hammed).",UNK
1670,"I'm not so sure why this place gets voted best of Madison all the time.  I think people have a hard time distinguishing between something that's great, and something that they've just heard about.\n\nLaredo's is totally average.  The service is good, the food is just okay.  End of story.",UNK
1671,Both the breakfast and lunch buffets were very good there. The price is right. The service is pretty good. I definitely would go back there.,UNK
1672,It's a small cute little place. Decorations are warm and welcoming. The food is absolutely delicious. They have freshly squeezed orange juice! Their chicken and waffles are to die for! The service is really friendly and attentive. The table in the center are too close together.,UNK
1673,"Nicole was just awesome,  she was patient, great advise and did an wonderful job on my first tattoo ever. Great place with friendly staff and atmosphere. Definitely going back to her for my next one!",UNK
1674,This Costco is our local.  Sometimes the weekends can be really busy but if you go on Thursday or Friday night it can be a quick trip.\nGas station on site is cheap (of course) but always busy.,UNK
1675,"I used to like Anna's but the last time I went there, they did an absolutely awful job.  2 pair of yoga pants had one pant leg longer than the other and they shortened my sweat pants so short I donated them to Goodwill.",UNK
1676,every time i go to this salon i leave disappointed. i will not be returning. for $150 i expect to be able to notice i did something to my hair.. find somewhere better.,UNK
1677,Best buffet I have ever eaten. I have been here several times and make it part of my plans each time I go to Vegas.,UNK
1678,"The worst coffee I have ever had! Poured from a pitcher sitting in the fridge, watered down and coffee grounds?! I had to throw it away after gagging. This should not be served to the public. WARNING don't waste your money!",UNK
1679,"It is certainly vegan and you pay extra for that - which is more than reasonable if you want  a place with multiple options with absolutely no animal products. I would eat here again but prices are a bit high for my blood, especially since there are a number of other options - bottom line - good food, just a bit high relative to the surrounding area.",UNK
1680,This was awesome! It is so easy to drive the cars and the scenery was fantastic! The guide was great and we will so do this again when we are in vegas!\n\nIf your bald - take a hat! You can burn fast in that sun.,UNK
1681,"I went here as part of my quest for the best croissant in the city. It's pretty darn good. I have yet to find any croissant in this city that blows my mind. So considering that, Mamie Clafoutis may be the front runner.",UNK
1682,"I know a lot of people who love this place; from a flavor perspective, I mostly get grease and toppings. But the texture is good, and the prices are reasonable. Hard to deny, and open very late.",UNK
1683,"The lunch special is awesome! $13.00 for 2 rolls, soup, salad and 4 pieces. Not a thousand things to choose from but you can't beat $12.95!  The fish tasted fresh and the place was clean which is all good news for me! Good experience and will be coming back for sure",UNK
1684,"Good tea, yummy hot chocolate. My guess is that it is set up for the vegetarian as I ordered cream of brocolli soup and noticed right away that it did not have a chicken stock base. Disappointing. My daughter's food took forever and we ate outside as it was very small indoors.",UNK
1685,"At a corporate park. Said 15-20, after 25 min I call and they the some number car is on the way. 20 minutes later still no cab and hitched ride from a client. Thankfully made it to the airport on time.",UNK

1688,"This place is for Jazz lover more than foodies .... \nbut for those who have been there before, their food and wine collection has been significantly improved.",UNK
1689,The food is normal nothing splendid that you can not get anywhere else. The wait for seating and food is just not worth it.\nI'm not going back.\nFYI they don't take  reservations.,UNK
1690,"Who needs oversized \""security guards\"" harassing people at an upscale establishment?  This place has a really strange vibe!!!  Will not be going back.",UNK
1691,THis restaurant is terrible my family and I were seated after waiting 15 min and was never waited on. We sat at our table for over 30 minutes and no one came to take our drink order much less food. IT was like we were not even there. This place has terrible service. Stay away,UNK
1692,Love this place.  All the work is done on site and they have the machines to dry clean large items like comforters.  They also do on site alterations.,UNK
1693,"Service is amazing, food is consistently delicious, and the atmosphere is cozy, fun, and relaxing. \nLunch, dinner, drinks with friends... I love this adorable new spot.",UNK
1694,Had new tires put on and an oil change done. They got me the best price I could find and had me in and out in under an hour. The customer service was great and they didn't try to sell me on anything I did not need.,UNK
1695,"Was on the couch with a heating pad for four days, Advil every four hours, no help.  Went to Dr Lok, and after just one treatment I was walking straight without pain.  Amazing!",UNK
1696,"Food was good, nothing extraordinary, but good enough to scratch a dim sum itch. Service was a bit slow, but very friendly.\n\nNote: this is located in a very run-down mall, with a very worn out parking lot - if those are factors for you.",UNK
1697,"Absolutely loved it! Smelled clean--not like cigarette smoke!!  Immaculate !!  Friendly staff! Couldn't ask for more! Went here for our 10th wedding anniversary!  Romantic!- considering it was Vegas!   There is not one thing I did not like--wait, there was, that I did not win!!",UNK
1698,Crepes station is top notch. Seafood was okay.  Kind of worn down in the last 5 years. A deep cleaning would be great for this whole seating area. Probibly backstage too.,UNK
1699,"Me & My wife really enjoyed the food. Specially, my wife is a vegetarian and very picky. Even she enjoyed the food. Their fresh orange juice is the best one. Basically\nhealthy food. \nFriendly and courteous service. We will recommend to any one.",UNK
1700,Met my husband here and 3 years later we had our wedding reception here! Great food (got a lot of compliments from our guests) and very accommodating to our 100 guest party! \nThanks so much for helping make our special day even better!,UNK
1701,"Chose to order JJ delivery for lunch in the park with the kids. Order went in before noon, it's 1:40 and no JJ. Manager says new driver...",UNK
1702,"Great little Australian themed cafe on St.Laurent, the two guys running it are friendly and more than happy to have a chat. They bake their own muffins and the jaffles were a nice reminder of home. Most importantly the few times I've been in the coffee has not disappointed,  well made espresso and lattes",UNK
1703,"Go there to grab a drink but skip the food, much better choices to feed yourself in the area.\nI you think of Madison's as a bar you'll be fine: friendly staff, good choices of beer on tap, plenty of TVs to watch local sports.",UNK
1704,"I just went to smash burger for the first time and I'm completely disappointed.. I order an Oreo milkshake for over $4 and the dude behind the counter keeps half of it in his own cup! Not cool.. After that display of total disrespect, I won't be back",UNK
1705,"Lasalle college provides an opportunity for students who can not get into other colleges for various reasons an education. They are not highly regarded by universities, they are extremely disorganized, there is no standard of education, this is clearly a business more than an educational institution. The bottom dollar is what is of importance to this school",UNK
1706,My family has been coming here for years.  I called at 3 p.m. today to make a reservation for dinner and was treated so rudely on the phone I'll never come back.,UNK
1707,Only giving it four stars because I didn't order any coffee or snacks. But loved it. I learned the world championship of pin balling is held in Pittsburgh. My favorite machine is the Indiana Jones one. Bring dollar bills and coins. Only put tokens in the pin ball machine. No coins.,UNK
1708,Terrible. It took 1 1/2 hours to get a shuttle and go 4 miles to The Palazzo. Save yourself and get a taxi.,UNK
1709,My husband & I used to love this place until we had takeout one night & found a dead roach @ the bottom of his briyani - can't eat there again!,UNK
1710,We took our family here for dinner because the restaurant was recommended by a friend.  Having never eaten Ethiopian food before it was a good cultural experience.  The food and the atmosphere were both very nice.  The restaurant was clean.  We enjoyed it.,UNK
1711,Yummy....everything was solid...I was surprised about their quality.  I was expecting mediocre food and was pleased.  Dinner is 22.99 which is totally a steal.  they didnt have crab legs though but they made it up with the cotton candy in the dessert area..lol\nloved it :),UNK
1712,"It was ok nothing special... One guy for the whole place it took a while to get the guy to our order! The food was ok but it didn't \""wow\"" me... Tasted lower than my expectations....",UNK
1713,How could Fatburger even justify charging $12 for a half pound hamburger combo.\nI walked in looked at the menu and walked out. I'll give it another year before it's out of business,UNK
1714,Service was pretty good. Food was decent. Ambiance was nice...kind of a contemporary lounge feel. Pretty nice drink list.,UNK
1715,Exactly what I was thinking. MEH...... For the price I've had MUCH better. Went for Sunday brunch was not too impressed. I won't be back on my own free will.,UNK
1716,"I was disappointed by Nobu in that the decor is aging and the food was good but definitely not worth the price. I eat sushi almost every day, and I could have paid 1/4 of the price for the same product. Combing that with the up selling from the waiter I was left completely unimpressed.",UNK
1717,"I still love them, but this time when I went in I asked for a blended Thai tea boba drink and was told \""we don't do Thai tea blended.\"" Funny because when I was here Saturday I got a blended Thai tea...hmmm",UNK
1718,I love the cherry dipped cones!\n\nStill sad they got rid of the cotton candy blizzard- was my absolute favorite!,UNK
1719,"I love Applebee's Food but this place disappoints me.. Lack of staff, slow service.. /sigh",UNK
1720,Love how you can get your favorite flavors in different sizes for a good price. When my family & I crave we buy quarts & keep them in our freezer. Circus animal cookie is my favorite!,UNK
1721,You need to try this place! The veal scallopini was the best my husband has ever has and the sole was to die for! Love this place!,UNK
1722,"Friendly staff but the food was very bland tasting.  It tasted like they didn't add any salt, pepper, or any other seasoning.   My brother and I had to pour hot sauce on our food so it had some flavor.   Disappointing when you go out to eat and could have made something better at home.",UNK
1723,"Price was def reasonable!  Food -- great quality!  Not just a typical burger!  Nice bar with plenty of TVs. Scalloped potatoes were awesome!  Michael, the bartender bought us the doughnuts!! Very nice sweet treat to end our experience!  We will be back!",UNK
1724,"Gas prices are a little competitive, and the cooler is stocked well with what little space they have, and the coffee is always available. This is a very old site, and grungy, but the people are nice. I do not know why this gas station charges above market for gas.",UNK
1725,cheesy but fun... i saw them friday at rocks lounge so i dont know what the ravello lounge is. pretty good for no cover charge,UNK
1726,"Service was very slow and not really attentive at all. Food was average at best, definitely seemed to be lacking flavor. The upside is the view, you just can't beat it. Margaritas were probably the best part of the meal.",UNK
1727,"can't say much about the candy and sweets portion of this place, but the restaurant was good.\n\nthe french onion soup was a little disappointing, but the appetizers and salads are great. i would return.\n\nawesome drinks too!",UNK
1728,I have been to this place recently. I was highly disappointed. The food took 30 minutes to get. When we finally got our food it was cold. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone in the Chandler area.,UNK
1729,"I'd been wanting a tattoo detailing a concept from my favorite all time book series, The Wheel of Time. I knew Tone's work from a friend of mine and he did an absolutely beautiful job with freehand detailing that is incredible. I couldn't have asked for a better outcome!!",UNK
1730,"Mediocre burgers - if you are in the area and want a fast food burger, Fatburger is  a better bet than Wendy's. But it is nothing to go out of your way for.",UNK
1731,Overpriced ... Rude service... Bad food... Cappuccino? I know it was international coffee from a tin,UNK
1732,"I ate here for lunch a saturday,  the food was good and fresh. For $15 all youu can eat the price was just right. I like the deco, it was like a chic restaurant less like a buffet. I give it  3 stars in comparison to the 5 star seafood village buffet at Rio",UNK
1733,"The coffee is pretty good and the place is always busy. There are always pretty girls here, but it can have the pretentious vibe too. The food isnt bad either, but i can only speak for breakfast.",UNK
1734,If you like seafood this is a must place to eat when your in Arizona going back before I leave here We ate well  and you won't break the bank Dang this shit is Real Good,UNK
1735,"I've been to this Jason's a few times, and it's been good every time, but tonight I had their Nutty Mixed up Salad and they went from good to amazing. The chicken was fresh grilled and the balsamic vinaigrette dressing is superb. Highly recommended.",UNK
1736,Really just not that great. It beats subway but I'd rather just go to Quizno's or a local pizza/sub shop,UNK
1737,"Food tasted terrible. Guacamole was a light minty green color, not very appetizing.  The tacos fried way too long. The tortillas used in the mini tacos were super dry. We regret dining at this place. Would probably have had better food at the place we originally wanted to try.",UNK
1738,"We had a great time and service was awsome! I had the Capellini with Scallops, the scallops rocked!\n\nThe sauce was lite and tasted great. Try this one out, our party of 6 had a great time.",UNK
1739,"I don't come to this Walmart often, I usually go to the one in El Mirage. This one seems a lot more crowded, but I do my shopping here when I need to go to Desert Schools for something.",UNK
1740,"That place is horrible. We never get served and we got ignored from servers and bartender. They did not bring the  menus and didn't even ask us for drinks  for about 10 mins. So we just walked out. Again, that's terrible place to go.",UNK
1741,"Place is pretty outdated and yet in a perpetual state of construction. People are nice and the Jeff Civillico show is awesome, but the facilities are just in shambles. \n\nHowever, the location is killer. When the place is upgraded, it could be a good value depending on how they price it out.",UNK
1742,One word will do Overrated. Expensive and very cramped too.  Will not be coming back i've had way better tasting ice cream and shakes at other local spots.  Save your money and go sowhere else.,UNK
1743,"I liked it.\ni was not allowed to use chest mount gopro camera, but all other people were using handheld phones!!!!  during the ride!!!, very unfair and stupid.",UNK
1744,This particular SB is the weakest in the area.  The space is small and during winter it is freezing as every time someone enters they bring the outside climate in with them. There's also a small group of loud obnoxious old guys who dominate the soft chairs every morning doing their crosswords  and screaming about inane facts and new stories.,UNK
1745,"I won't say too much about the show because it's better to see it for yourself, but I will say that your mind WILL be blown haha",UNK
1746,"Awesome dinner on August 8, 2011.  Steamed miso cod = delicious! Jade dumplings = outstanding!  Chicken curry was terrific too!  We will definitely return on our next trip.  Flavorful and interesting food, wonderful service - - Wazuzu rocks!",UNK
1747,Korean Food; perfect setting for all the ones that are too drunk to know what is good. Absolute garbage; not worth the trip!,UNK
1748,Do not eat here any place that has bugs climbing in its dinning room means bugs in the kitchen. Will never ever eat the food here!,UNK
1749,Not worth the money- better value at Sprouts even though Whole Foods is a bigger store.  I used to love the take-out section but it seems to have less variety and nothing that really stood  out.,UNK
1750,"Long wait, and service is good, depending on the waiter's mood. They have really good appetizers, and the mixed paella was worth the 40 min wait.",UNK
1751,"I love getting my eyebrows waxed here. Jeannie does an amazing job, and takes her time with you even when they are busy outside doing nails. I wouldn't go with anyone else besides her.",UNK
1752,"This Jewelry store is Great!  They are always so helpful, and take time to find out exactly what you want, great place to have something different designed! Will clean jewelry, and also buy Gold, and diamonds !",UNK
1753,The best Jamaican food outside of Jamaica. I picked up both the oxtail meal and the curried goat meal. It's just me so my plan was to make it a Jamaican food weekend. Yesterday I had the curried goat and loved it. I can hardly wait to dive into the oxtails for dinner today.,UNK
1754,All kids meals are fried except the pasta marinara. No substitutions. Plan on buying an adult meal for your kids if you want to give them something a little healthier.,UNK
1755,"Complete disappointment...service was terrible, no music playing and food was just ok. Only positive thing was their Mac & Cheese balls.",UNK
1756,"The Bakery at Safeway on Glendale and 7th Street rocks.\nTheir \""artisan\"" loafs really kick ass.\n\nBut sell out early.",UNK
1757,"If you are looking for food of a different type,  this is definitely the place for you.  The food I ordered was entirely not what I thought and it included onions,  even though it was not supposed to logically have onions. Though the staff was nice and friendly I was extremely unhappy with my food, as was my date.",UNK
1758,"My favorite for Pt. Breeze/Pittsburgh East End. Flat New York style, not greasy, timely delivery, they know my orders!",UNK
1759,"This was a nice place! We stopped by here on recommendation of my in-laws to look at seeds. They had a wide variety of seeds (including mustards which is what I wanted) and they have a nice, expansive nursery area.",UNK
1760,Came back for a 2nd hot stone massage.  It was better than the first one!  I was so relaxed and Janelle really listened to what I wanted for my massage.  She went the extra mile and I felt very pampered.  I love this place!,UNK
1761,"Not bad, but nothing special.  If you are going to specialize in only 1 item it should be GREAT!  The chicken fingers are average... Not bad but wouldn't go back.  The Texas toast was good",UNK
1762,We ate there on Friday night and both my husband and I ended up with food poisoning from the scallops. Not sure I would ever eat there again!,UNK
1763,"I had some kind of grilled chicken sandwich with arugula on fococcia bread. It seemed bland. If I went back, I'd try a burger or rueben. Atmosphere and service were good, though.",UNK
1764,"absolutely fantastic little spot. innovative, unpretentious.  ricotta crepe with raisins over a spiced vegetable ragout was a highlight. hope to return\ncall ahead on a weeknight, sometimes they close early.\nd",UNK
1765,"Such a great atmosphere, friendly staff and a wide variety of sushi/non sushi. Such a great surprise, can't wait to go back again!",UNK
1766,Im always bringing everyone here!! I love it so much I highly recommend rainbow roll and crunchy rolls\nHappy hour is a great time to try new things and great deals\nThey have more than just sushi,UNK
1767,"Great facility! Awesome friendly, knowledgable, and most of all FRIENDLY staff that explained everything and helped us pick the package that suited us best!!! Will come back an recommend to ANYONE!!",UNK
1768,"I love giant clam, this place always has it fresh and crunchy,\nDon't let them seat you in the front area where you walk in, sit in the back by the windows , the view is great !. \nI, minus 1 star for the price here . Even with my local discount.",UNK
1769,"Cool atmosphere, good scene.  Food is very good, but not off the charts.  Our server was only fair, and didn't seem terribly interested in serving us right from the start.  Wine list is impressive, but the wine is grossly overpriced.",UNK
1770,"Over priced and just an ok beer selection.  $14 for a fajita that can feed a small child. Burger is ok, frys are cooked not all the way through.",UNK
1771,"Since the place and service are excellent, there are no words to describe the food.  Try the Seared Ahi Tuna Tacos and the Pozole, the best by far!",UNK
1772,Went here on a Thursday or Friday (can't quite remember) and cashier told me to run next door to Albertsons to buy a soda and get a receipt so it would save me 25% off my purchase! Great customer care and service! My kind of place! Prices are a little higher than Deseret Industries though.,UNK
1773,"Not worth the hassle.  Too small and crowded for my group of friends to be able to chat or even sit next to each other.  Not nearly as large a selection as I expected for a wine bar - it seemed like they had one Riesling, no Moscato, maybe only one or two of most varieties.",UNK
1774,"You have to love their samosas, just go get a batch and chow down. Just don't forget those samosas pack quite a few calories.",UNK
1775,Delicious and very affordable! This place is well worth the short walk from Freemont street to treat the family to delicious ice cream. Limited seating so eat your cone fast before it melts!,UNK
1776,I do agree that the customer service inside is completely lacking. This is why I don't bother going in anymore. I just get gas and that's it. Usually the gas prices are competitive with the others in the area. The area is very tight near the pumps..where sometimes it's hard to access the ones in the middle.,UNK
1777,I was lucky enough to not have to wait in a huge line for the buffet.  Saturday night at 8pm and we were let almost right in.  I loved how they displayed the food and it was yummy as well.  The desserts were amazing and our waiter kept the drinking flowing.  Great experience and would love to return.,UNK
1778,"Can I give a 0 star? The customer service is horrible, slow and they were not being respectful at all, waste of time.  I'd rather pay more and go somewhere else.  Worst service ever.",UNK
1779,"Lovely location, we have stayed several times.  However, beware of room 722A, washer overflowed several times, maintenance repair performed badly and machine continued to flood the bathroom. Card key access was cancelled each day at Noon of our 4 day stay, very disappointing and inconvenient.  Hope they get it together.",UNK
1780,We went to BB Kings Blues Club hoping to .....hear blues or jazz.  Instead we watched playoff games.  Yippeee?? THe band started to warm up as we were getting ready to leave. Very disappointed but our waitress was GREAT!!,UNK
1781,"my chili cheese dog was cold. the hot dog itself. the chili, everything.  had mozzerella sticks they were hot. they were good.  but i was there for the hotdog and dont think i will be back.",UNK
1782,I like the staff and they have a solid burger and chocolate shake.  Their grilled chicken sandwhich and chicken strips are okay.  I have tried almost everything else on the menue and didn't really like anything else.  Stick with the Burger.  I go with Thousand Island as the sauce.  The place could use a face lift.,UNK
1783,"THIS LOCATION HAS CLOSED.\n\nGood luck finding that out otherwise, seeing that the company doesn't have a website with all location info...",UNK
1784,Went here for lunch with some friends. I had never been here before. Ordered a shrimp dish that the server recommended. I thought it was subpar. The service was not good and the food definitely didn't make up for it.  Maybe it was just the dish I tried but I didn't like it.,UNK
1785,"went to Texas de Brasil on Tuesday evening, had the best time. food is always amazing. Our server was Kristen, who was extremely friendly, pleasant and attentive, but was also very professional. the entire staff was great. but if you go, ask for Kristen, she is the best!!",UNK
1786,"A nasty dive.  Smokey, dirty floors and the restrooms (both) were disgusting.  My wife went in and right back out refusing to use the facilities.  And the food. The french fries tasted like fish.  I could say more but will leave it at that.\n\nNot worth wasting your money or time.",UNK
1787,"Rude staff, rude manager, and slow service.  We have given it three separate tries and it is the same every time. Perhaps I am overly critical of the rudeness because I work in hospitality. However, we will not be returning.",UNK
1788,"Ordered the organic burger. It was good,  but not 7 dollars good. \nI also hate the fact that you HAVE to get fries.\n\nThe service was quite curt, and we got our food in 15-20.\nAll in all, a decent alternative to In N Out.",UNK
1789,It is what it is. Peanut shells everywhere. This around I enjoyed myself with peeps. Beer selection is okay.....at least they have hepeweizen. Though they do have an outside sitting area.,UNK
1790,"I was nervous about trying someone new for a brow wax, but D'Lisa was awesome!  I highly recommend her to any guy looking for a clean, natural look at a cool, convenient location.  Thanks D'Lisa!",UNK
1791,"A good buffet, it's not worth the money like it used to be. To cost almost $50 a person and what they have available you can get much more bang for your buck around vegas.",UNK
1792,"I found a lot to do in this airport while waiting for a flight to San Antonio. \n\nThe wifi is fast, if you're into that kinda stuff.",UNK
1793,"Stayed here for business. Walking distance to the strip, full gym, and you can't beat the washer and dryer in the room!",UNK
1794,"Good sushi! Jason is a great sushi chef and always prepares amazing sushi. However, dont be surprised if you are asked to move seats after you have paid. This is money city, and they have no problem clearing you out if others are waiting. Even if you are still finishing your last drink. Be prepared for rude.",UNK
1795,The Mint was an awesome place and great party atmosphere. Theres a bunch of older people than younger. The bartenders were friendly and attentive! I would go back.,UNK
1796,Ok I went there for dinner a few nights ago and I can honestly say this place is over priced and lacking quality food. I had the wagyu skirt steak that's a special and I can honestly say there's no way it's real wagyu beef. I also had the buffalo,UNK
1797,This place is awesome. Friendly atmosphere.  Only gave 4 stars bc 2 times I went they were out of the beer that I was hoping for and on weekends there is no way you are getting a table without waiting 30-35 mins.,UNK
1798,I really don't want to give this place any stars... This is the slowest and rudest place in town. I was so disgusted by the rude service that I asked to speak to the manager and sadly enough she responded that she was the manager..  I will never never go to this location again..,UNK
1799,nice location. food prices high for portion sizes. swordfish strip was alright and the potato was undercooked. management was less than friendly. Didn't want to deal with what I had to say and it seemed like it was just brushing me off.,UNK
1800,"Thanks for the great pizza tonight. I burned our Costco pizza and the kids cried.   So we picked up the phone and bam, pizza and ice cream where in minutes.   Now I know better.  Big Boys Pizza from now on",UNK
1801,"Large resort in the desert. Great pool area, with the chairs that have flags to raise to get service. Plus it's pet friendly.",UNK
1802,"Great beer selection.  Ever changing.  Rivals most of the spots in Pittsburgh for great selection of craft beers.  Hamburger selection is diverse, unique twist on dinner menu and a good sandwich and salad options.  A generous wine selection that will not break the bank and cocktail creations for everyone.  I say yes and give it a shot.",UNK
1803,"So glad Vegas has this place. Its really fun to spend sometime in here and play all the different machines plus its next to a $2 movie theater, cant get a cheaper better date than that. Very fun!",UNK
1804,Awesome food and great service the waiter Ollie was amazing and super nice and we never had to ask for a refill for are drinks and food super fast I had the diablo wings and the chicken nachos they were awesome!,UNK
1805,Our beer was cold and so was the food the wait was way to long and the  service was slow not a place to take the kids the wait for there food was so long they fell a sleep,UNK
1806,This place was fun and very tasty. We shared the best onion rings I've ever had. They come with a spicy ketchup and are seasoned and crispy. I ordered a sandwich which was also good too. I would definitely come here again.,UNK
1807,Clearly the best shop in Phoenix! I couldn't be happier with my work!\nAward winning.. Thank you so much!,UNK
1808,"Came here for lunch with a friend.  AYCE for $20.00 for lunch...good results.  Great lunch time variety of selections, especially for lunch.  We sat at the bar so the cook was quick on making what we wanted.  Tasted great, would definitely go back!",UNK
1809,"I couldn't pick a casino I'd rather have in my backyard than GVR. The cinema feels very private, i enjoy the atmosphere.",UNK
1810,"My daughter, mom and I all preferred the Wynn buffet over the Bacchanal however my husband begged to differ....",UNK
1811,Absolutely love the food at this place.  Can't go wrong with the whole shabang mild mix.  We always end up ordering the shrimp and corn. The king crab is also awesome. It's a great place for the whole family!,UNK
1812,Love this place.... One of the best in Vegas !!\n\nI get the Omelet almost every Tuesday morning.... this place is a Las Vegas Institution!!!,UNK
1813,"A nice, grand park that's perfect for meandering or enjoying a nice picnic.  Portions of it have dense trees and it's nice to feel as if you are in a forest and far away from a city.  This place is worth the visit.",UNK
1814,"I don't visit Souvia often, but each time I go the employees are completely inconvenienced and annoyed to answer questions. With that said, their tea is delicious, my favorites are angels kiss and tropical green.",UNK
1815,"You have a choice here. Jack in the Box or Del Taco. Del Taco is great for breakfast, when you need something quick, or when there are 5 cars in Jacks drive thru.",UNK
1816,How do you mess up a sandwich?  Make the customer wait 20 minutes for it.  Since when should it take 3 people 20 minutes to make a sandwich!,UNK
1817,Best part about this place is the fact that Mandalay is at the end of the strip and the balcony @ Foundation Room gives a gorgeous view of the entire strip making a great photo-op.,UNK
1818,"It's Panda.  Got exactly what I expected. It isn't gourmet,  it isn't even cheap really.  Sometimes I ask myself why I stop here.",UNK
1819,Went in today because of the reviews here. Was not disappointed. Danny helped me he was very knowledgable answered all my questions and got me hooked up.,UNK
1820,The food was ok but was charged 10.00 a piece for 2 margaritas on the rocks because they used patron without asking if I even wanted to shelf!!! $20.00\nFor two watered down drinks is a rip off!!,UNK
1821,Love me some fresh fruit smoothies especially before work and for breakfast!  I can't help being a fan of this place and the location in the epicenter is great.  Yup I'm a fan!,UNK
1822,I was relaly looking forward to this place but was disappointed upon arrival to find out that they are only serving a buffet. The spice level on the buffet was low. I did enjoy the variety of food but would have preferred to have ordered off the menu.,UNK
1823,"Their garlic bread with mozzarella is so delicious! The spaghetti calzone and the super six pizza are amazing as well! Service was great and the atmosphere was cute and intimate. It can be hard to choose from the menu full of great options, but it doesn't look like you can go wrong with any of them!",UNK
1824,Great food and great prices...been a regular here for a few months.  Really nice it's 24hrs since I work nights.  And I always hit them up for the $5 for 5 mini tacos!,UNK
1825,I have been to RB&R quite a few times and have tried most of the items on the menu.  I have yet to be disappointed.  The quality of the ingredients is very clearly superior to what you will find in a typical deli. The prices are reasonable relative to the quality and the service is fast and friendly. Highly recommended.,UNK
1826,"Crab and artichoke dip, garlic fries, fried mushrooms, steak and black bean chili, nachos, wings, SUSHI and OYSTERS, STEAKS and home-brewed tap beers. Yes!!",UNK
1827,I have had better sushi and at more affordable price. I just wanted to try something near my house. But the food is good and if you have the view its good.,UNK
1828,Need fat? Need carbs? Come here. I usually get a steak grinder (or sub I guess) and jalapeno poppers. They do the steak just how it is at home (the East Coast). I trust a place full of construction guys on lunch break. They also have good fried fish.,UNK
1829,Love this place!! Great bagels! Great service! Turkey bacon club with swiss on a bagel is the best clubs I've ever had and I worked at a sandwich place before. I can't want to go back again and eat more yummy food.,UNK
1830,"Above average in many ways, no big weaknesses.  This is a good play to go if you want hardware upgrades, they have a lot of parts and components for PCs that will help you out if you are working on your machine at home compared to a box store that usually only has the three most popular cord converters/PSUs.",UNK
1831,"Some things on the menu are good. Other things not so much. Definitely overpriced, but nice for kids.",UNK
1832,"Had a okay experience the first time. The food was about a 6 out of 10. The second time it was awful we asked to be seated in a both and the guy just wouldn't do it. He was very rude, guess he didn't want our business.",UNK
1833,This place is awesome soon ask we enter the door we were greeted and sat right away. We sat down and immediately was serve Chips and Salsa delicious! And fajitas were the best i ever had seriously will be back.,UNK
1834,This is a smaller Harris Teeter for sure but I've never had a problem with their parking or anything. It's also the only Harris Teeter with a kosher deli. No doubt that's due to this Harris Teeter's proximity to the Dell Jewish Community Center.,UNK
1835,"Yummy and great!   Awesome rolls.   The Salmon Bomber is probably one of the best rolls I have ever had, at any sushi joint, but watch out, it's spicy!",UNK
1836,"I go here weekly, and while the food is very rich (heavy for lunch) it is consistent and great.  I also think the food is value priced, but the drinks are expensive.",UNK
1837,"High quality coffee and friendly/helpful/hipster staff, but soo overpriced. Barrier to entry is high, and for that reason, you lose a star. Sorry, Cartel, but be more affordable to the average folk.",UNK
1838,"Pros- amoroso bread, size and franks soda.\nCons-  meat can be too salty, sometimes skimpy on the cheese and last visit out of black cherry soda.",UNK
1839,"we are a repeat customer-- best service - Thx Tom!!! Best NY steak, Ribeye---unbelievable flavor. Great Kir Royale.  Unbelievable Banana Cream Pie.  This has to be best restaurant in vegas",UNK
1840,"dated, kind of shabby 70s feel in the non-remodeled portion of the hotel, nice soaps/lotion",UNK
1841,"I though it was overpriced, the steak was good, but not great. There are plenty of great steakhouses in Vegas that are better for half the price.",UNK
1842,I will not stay there again.  The train is a deal breaker for me.  The rooms are really nice and the staff is friendly and professional.,UNK
1843,"Funny story. The service was weak and the drink I had was horrible and was forced to pay 10$ for it.  Unhappy I tipped that waiter 10% and he had the audacity to come and complain that I didn't give him 15% WOW!  Food was ok, but I won't go back.",UNK
1844,"Great quality with great price.  Their dishes are more fusion Japanese than traditional, but I enjoyed it.  Sashimi grades are excellent.  Server did excellent job too.",UNK
1845,"Honestly, one of the rudest companies to deal with. Visited store with my brother, somewhat of a variety. Staff very rude and unfreindly, better options in town.",UNK
1846,"This place just rocks, awesome authentic Malaysian/Thai food and great service, super friendly staff, always smiling, LOVE IT! Not on the strip either, so its not as crazy :-) I even have a loyalty card with them!",UNK

1848,Got sat outside and never received service. Moved inside.... No service. Finally went to the bar where we continued the no service saga ... FINALLY got drinks that were not even served in the cool mason jars they advertised.   There Are way better places in Vegas to go and get crappy drinks with better service,UNK
1849,Very fun festival on the west side of town. Only a 4 star because it gets so compact. VIP is worth it for the food alone. Suncoast across the street and good place to crash. Motley Brews does a fine job,UNK
1850,I bought three things a Conn's on three separate occasions. I paid one off and the other two are on time every time. I tried to get credit again and they tell me no because I have a blemish on my credit record that has been there for a long time. They know about it the first time!!,UNK
1851,"Naked Sushi Event:\n\nNEGATIVE 100,000,000 stars.  I should have given my $$ to some homeless guy.  \n\nThe naked models had good plastic surgeons though. Very interesting... but don't waste your money.",UNK
1852,"Scott said everything that needs to be said, except that yes, I can find clothes in my size, the men's department is ALWAYS neat and orderly (in fact the whole store is like that!) unlike the other place I recently commented on, and prices are at least \""not outrageous\"".",UNK
1853,"Amelie's was filthy and it makes it uncomfortable to imagine eating there when everything in the building looks so unclean, including the pastry case where they store the food.",UNK
1854,"I hope they bring one to san Diego, we orders the pizza king pizza BOMB. we ordered the Creamy pesto fettuccini and the best caprese salad for under ten bucks I've ever had. Delivered with paper plates and condiments in a very timely manner. They Rock",UNK
1855,"I love this place. Been there many time and loved every time. But this last time my friend found a hair in her sno. We understood that happens somtimes, so we left. I kept eating mine and later found 8 hairs in mine. Short black hairs. This is disgusting and I'm skeptical about going back again now",UNK
1856,Im from California and I can't seem to find any really good thai restaurants out here but Thai Paradise is pretty okay :) I like the crying tiger! It's the best dish ever yummm. They unfortunately stopped delivering so now I have to go in an eat. ): still 4 star worthy to me!,UNK
1857,"Miserable people with no souls work here. I never thought changing a name on a license would be such an ordeal. Make sure you show up EARLY, before 8 or you will be waiting for hours. I will be going to a different mvd in the future.",UNK
1858,"I decided on this location because it is very close to my house. The ladies were friendly and the service was fast. Ask for Anita. I have never had my eyebrows threaded before and heard it was painful. However, with Anita, it wasn't. I will definitely go back.",UNK
1859,"This was my last boss's favorite restaurant in Las Vegas, and he took me there to show me why: great wine selection and delicious food.  Don't be fooled by the french name of the restaurant -- you can get an amazing steak here as well.",UNK
1860,Went there and the food was decent but the service was aweful. My girlfriend and I were the only ones in there and they took forever to come back to our table or even bring the check. We just wanted to leave,UNK
1861,"More than anything, I love the ambience here.  The food, in particular the pasties and shepherd's pies are also delicious.",UNK
1862,"It's not really meant to be a negative review.  BUT--I happened to wander by today on my way to the grocery store, and they are no longer in business.",UNK

1864,They have MADELEINES!!!!! I love these things and have not been get them at the 4 other Starbucks I go to. Until now.,UNK
1865,"Great guy, great business! I've never met someone more competent with catering services. Organized, honest, and experienced. Can't go wrong with Classic Catering.",UNK
1866,"Quite an interesting menu, good service and ambiance, but mediocre execution in the kitchen.  If they could get the kitchen to deliver on the promise of the menu, it would be a five-star breakfast joint for me.  I look forward to giving it another try at some point.",UNK
1867,"Enjoyed a fantastic Swedish massage at the Spa! Highly recommend this beautiful, peaceful, modern spa. Top-class staff made the experience a trip highlight!",UNK
1868,"We come here all the time because its close to home and there's somthing on the menu for everyone - healthminded or not, kids or adults - and it offers outdoor seating and a decent wine list. The servers have been there for years and are very warm toward us. Overall, its a solid choice for the family.",UNK
1869,"Great food and great people. You wouldn't know this place was there unless you were looking for it. Give it a try, you won't regret it! Oh and the sweet iced tea is perfectly made!",UNK

1872,I've enjoyed many a 'last minute' out to dinner at Harvest Cafe in the past 3 years. The Tilapia dinner is always tasty as are the Steak or Chicken Caesar salads.,UNK
1873,I like this place til I got a piece of metal in my food... I haven't been in over 2 yrs but craving it a little... I loved the lunch specials!!,UNK
1874,"Meh. We had the Groupon, couldn't use it on the lunch special so we ended up paying $19 for a mediocre large pizza. They did have a good cookie though.",UNK
1875,"We stopped in to Copper Blues on Friday night after a Mercury game at the US Airways Center.  Fantastic place!  Unbelievable beer selection, great views of downtown and an excellent band the night that we were there made for a really great downtown experience.  Will definitely be back again soon!",UNK
1876,Pool was awesome. Sportsbook great. Rooms on point. Best craps tables. Turned 100 into 5100 dollars in 4 hours. Insanity.  Couldn't have had a better trip. Got rooms comped and rooms comped for next month,UNK
1877,"Life saver! My wife and I need sun tan lotion, water, and some meds for the our headache. Got them all at a reasonable price. Get your things here instead of a the shops in the casinos. It's way cheaper.",UNK
1878,"We had a GREAT breakfast at ZZ.  Patio is wonderful and food was equally good.  Apple pancakes, French toast, breakfast sandwich and the Mexican dish were all great.  Service was a little slow but it was lovely morning so who really cares?!?  Go and enjoy!",UNK
1879,Awesome food. the Garlic fries were amazing as well as a special philly for the week with fontana cheese on it. Cant wait to come back and try some of their HUGE beer selection!,UNK

1881,The fresh made cookies here are excellent. The owner is always here making all sorts of bakery delights. We ordered a wedding cake here when we got married 6 years ago and come back at least twice a month.,UNK
1882,"I love Javier's.  Great chips, salsa, and guacamole.  The spinach enchilada is wonderful.  Great service with friendly staff.  The music is a bit loud.",UNK
1883,The sushi was very tasty but the portions were very small for the price. \nService was good. Restaurant was loud as to be expected in a Vegas restaurant.,UNK
1884,"Have eaten several meals here in the last 3 years. All have been great, fresh and tasted amazing. Never had a single issue w service, food prep or anything else.\nI would highly recommend this place to everyone.",UNK
1885,"Higley and Baseline location is the only one I've tried. I'm underwhelmed. Ordered a large pepperoni, it came about with 13 pepperonis, kind of a ripoff.",UNK
1886,"No one wears gloves at all when preparing any food, they touch everything.  Will not\ngo there again, and, it is too small and too noisy",UNK
1887,This place was only ordinary. My burger was over cooked and dry. I wanted juicy. Server was great. Disappointed with the experience.,UNK
1888,"Better than most fast Mexican food, with a huge serving. Had beef burrito enchilada style.  (I know, not my usual attempt at healthy eating.) I am reminded why I don't eat this way anymore.   Bland and not a good feeling afterwards.  It was a moment of weakness.  One and done.",UNK
1889,"probably was the highlight of the trip to vegas for us, mostly for its amazing stab at authenticity. but that's vegas... yes, even more touristy than the munich version, but the beer and sausage is straight from bavaria.",UNK
1890,Wonderful place for a drink. Four ciders on tap. If you wear your scrubs on Wednesday you get a first free beer and discounts.,UNK
1891,Dare I say it and commit heresy?  Yes!  JJ's is better than Kashman's was.  Which is a high compliment indeed.,UNK
1892,"I am from out of town, and yelped for a florist and the reviews were good and accurate. Special thanks to Erin for a beautiful arrangement! My customer enjoyed and it made their day! Thanks again and ALWAYS support the locals!",UNK
1893,"Friendly and comfortable with a decent enough beer selection, I just wish the food was better. Onion rings, chicken wings and French fries with a cold frosty tap brew makes this place worth coming back to in a pinch.",UNK
1894,"This was the worst experience I've had at a nail salon.   I left with gel color that didn't match the chip, jagged nails, and a stressed feeling since they overbooked appointments. I'm not a high maintenance human being but I expected that a manicurist do better than I could myself.",UNK
1895,"I stop by here everytime I'm in town. I've found some hidden treasures, for example a grey/ silvery dressy trench coat with ruffles at the bottom and a cute pair of jeans. This place has a lot of sports gifts. It's a very weird combination but is a cute store nonetheless.",UNK
1896,It's ok... very cheap at $20 for two entrees at lunchtime but ingredients clearly not fresh or best quality. Also a bad smell in men's toilets.,UNK
1897,Love the Somosas here! I have tried many from all over and this is the best here in this area! Trust me well worth ever penny and calorie! All things on menu that we have tried have been GREAT! It is a place that for such a tiny place they sure can cook!,UNK
1898,For being about pizza the selection is slim and the service was not that great.  Took a little bit longer to get food due to they were out of things and had to re-order.,UNK
1899,Fantastic Turkish food! Order Iskender Kebab with Ayran to drink. Then have Kunefe and Turkish tea for dessert.,UNK
1900,"Out of steak on a Monday, before the real dinner crowd gets here. Who runs out of steak in Las Vegas?? Love Guy on TV, but probably won't be back here.",UNK
1901,"Decent place, understandably busy on a Saturday night but patient with hungry customers. Vegetarian yet satisfying menu, and reasonable prices.",UNK
1902,"Boarded my dog there and the staff was nothing but extra nice and caring. Price was unbeliveable, and they made sure we knew the dog was in good hands. Good experience.",UNK
1903,"I liked this place, we had lunch here on the terrasse, which is fabulous on a sunny afternoon! I thought the quality/ food ratio was excellent, and the portions werent huge! Perfect place to enjoy a nice sunny afternoon!",UNK
1904,"Bummed!  Sounded so great, but for whatever reason, this pizza place was \""sold out of dough!\""  What pizza place does that?!",UNK
1905,"The cashier person is so impatient, unfriendly and rude. The pasta itself is not fully cooked (it is still too hard). The taste is standard.",UNK
1906,"Food was OK, but service was awesome! Our original group of 10 ballooned to a group of 20, and they didn't blink an eye and accommodated our group's last minute changes.",UNK
1907,SOOO Delicious!! Visiting Vegas from San Diego and I'll be back for sure. Brisket is delicious and the corn nuggets so good. Definitely check it out! Friendly staff as well.,UNK

1910,"Of the list of restaurants in the Food Fight Corporation, the one is one of the worst.  Service was slow.  Food quality suffers.  We used to go to buy gluten free pies there but they discontinued that.",UNK
1911,Found this dog park 3 months ago & it's great. There appears to be a very conscientious group of regulars that help make it very pleasant experience.  I believe my dog got an eye infection there but I guess that's an expected possibility just like taking your kids to the park where they may catch something from other children.,UNK
1912,"well the owner contacted me, apologized, and offered for me to come in and give it another try on him.....I declined because I knew it wouldn't be a real second chance for his staff to treat me as a valued customer, they would know to expect me. I may return some time again, will report back then.",UNK
1913,Came back again but the noodles in the pho were overcooked this time\nThe thai tea also had a bad batch of boba\n\nHowever their gui cuon and the peanut sauce were pretty terrific,UNK
1914,Weekend brunch was great; service was very very good and buffet options were varied and very good quality. Line to get it was quite long though; about 45 mins - worth going at off hours.,UNK
1915,"It's consistently pretty good.  It's chain food, and I am a little against big corporate restaurants as they are all pretty vanilla.  That said there is nothing run of the mill about their chambord margarita.",UNK
1916,"Yay! for AZ Massage Spa.  Hands down (no pun intended) Jesse James Ferrell provides the best massage and body work I've experienced.  The smoothies are awesome, too.  Highly recommended!!!",UNK
1917,"Truffle fries and a unique take on burGR's make it a fun, accessible Ramsey establishment. Not to downplay BurGR, but I thought the burger au poivre at Mon Ami Gabi was definitely superior.",UNK
1918,"nothing to rave about this place.\nservice was poor and the food was bad.\nI know, I shouldn't expect much on cajun food in phoenix. but I'm always up for an adventure.",UNK
1919,"Yoni helped my family and I take leadership and gain confidence with our pit bull. He taught us how to help him interact with people, horses, and our indoor cats. We now happily take him places we couldn't before all with Yoni's help and guidance. Thanks again Balancing Paws!\n\n-The Petty's",UNK
1920,"We had dinner there last night and the food was amazing! Our server Andy was great very knowledgeable and friendly. We talked with Paul the manager and he was a really nice guy. We ate the ribs, Kobe burger and enchiladas all excellent choices! Will go back for sure.",UNK
1921,"Fresh, tasty, and creative in presentation. The sushi is really good, probably some of the best in AZ. The house sake and the rice vodka drink they do is pretty good. I'll go again.",UNK
1922,I love Noa! I have been here for dinner twice and lunch twice. I love the menu and the cocktails. I am new to the area and this is the first place that I really enjoyed.,UNK
1923,"Brandon and his crew were excellent!!! They loaded our truck up in half the expected time. They were prompt, professional and very friendly! I would recommend Smooth Moves to anyone!!",UNK
1924,"Kind of hard to find. Definitely not much seating. But the food is amazing! That's what matters most, right? The service when I was there was really good too. This is a great place to eat!",UNK
1925,"Greasy bar food.  Stale bitter air -- even when first opening.  Ridiculously over-worked waitstaff.  The Sports were broadcast over the PA, but only half of the TVs were showing that channel, and they almost all were obscured by some damage to the screen.  Avoid it if at all possible.",UNK
1926,This is some of the best BBQ I've ever had. Pulled pork is incredible. Big portions of food at great prices. Fast service. A great place to hang out and have some drinks as well.,UNK
1927,"No longer my favorite as they limit their wifi on weekends! The two stars are for the wifi, not for the coffee. While everything else stays the same, their service for providing a cozy study spot is no longer excellent! Two stars for the wifi, as they still provides wifi started at 2 PM.",UNK
1928,"It's not much different from most other McDonald's. Even if they are really busy, I still get my food fast and accurate. Customer service is average.",UNK
1929,"Selection was poor. The customer service was ok as the woman in the shop was helpful and wanted to please, but the few gowns they did have were old and outdated.",UNK
1930,"Do they have to have frites with every entree? And the frites, pretty standard. Cheap by vegas standards for food .Decent view of Bellagio fountain show. You will be sorely disappointed if you expect this place to be a decent French bistro.",UNK
1931,"Funny how the \""hosts\"" think there sooooo cool and ignore you when u have a table inside.... On industry night when you work in the industry no wonder why Tao group is dying lol...",UNK
1932,"Who has two thumbs and loves Fatmans? THIS GUY! Hours are a bit odd, but waiting for those doors to open is worth every delicious bite of that menu.",UNK
1933,"We got a chocolate pizza and a chocolate chip cookie after reading the reviews, what a disappointment! I would give no stars but we did get them at their hallway window place so not sure how long they were sitting under the warming lights. We wanted to throw them away but for the price we were eating those suckers.",UNK
1934,After 9 days I realized the cut I received was a horrendous disaster! And the haircolor used bled off onto my pillow EVERY night since!! \nIn a pinch I wouldn't ever use this place for my hair ever again!\nBoo!!,UNK

1936,"This place use to have a good food selection with their AYCE menu, but they took their super white tuna n another good stuff out ! It's not the same!",UNK
1937,"Smelly and old interior, their Clarion which is attacked to the same building is newer and better! I requested a wake up call, they didn't set one for me, luckily i had back up, otherwise i would had missed my flight out of this dump",UNK
1938,"Idk, but I feel this place is more hype than legit. Curds were avg as was the burger I had. Not bad but not great. Idk if it is worth the wait.",UNK
1939,"The. cheesecake. The girls are local sweethearts and their passion comes out in every detail. They have cheesecake, cupcakes, cookies, brownies, gelato, coffee, tea and fresh baked bread!! Perfect for a small treat or event!",UNK
1940,Felt at home finally found a rock and roll place. I will return people were friendly a helpful. If you want a good time with good music and good atmosphere try it out.,UNK
1941,"Hated it. Dirty, nasty, things left in fridge & bathroom from prior guest. Smells like cigarettes all in hallway & room. Will never stay here again!",UNK
1942,"Ordered the republic ramen with tofu and it tasted bland.  My husband got the republic ramen with spam and it tasted much better than mine.  His had a nice sweet flavor, which is what I would recommend.",UNK
1943,"There's about 50 people in line, and we are all being told there are no cars left--reservation or not. The customer service person is saying he has no solution. No cars. No service. You make your decision. Everyone is pi$$ed!!! I wouldn't come here. Ever. Again.",UNK
1944,Great restaurant pretty large portions got three very stuffed tacos for about $14. We also ordered the table guacamole where some guy made guacamole right in front of our table! The service was fast also. And the tacos Tasted good.,UNK
1945,"Not worth of celebration if u want vegetarian option, and the chicken dumpling I ordered was super salty, they come back after 5 min to check , when I complained the waiter got me again a salty chicken and dumpling and the worst part was the waiter in charge for water did not come for 15min",UNK
1946,"OK- yes its expensive, but OH-so worth it!  Amazing service, food, & atmosphere. Great everything breakfast right down to the best jelly ever.",UNK
1947,Carne Asada Fries!!!!That's all you need to order lol This seriously is the best dish aside from the carne asada burrito! I moved from Las Vegas to the South and I'll tell you what i miss this place!!,UNK
1948,We went here for the first time on Saturday and were pleasantly surprised. There is a lot of stuff in here and the range is huge. I was expecting to see the usual junk which they had and so much more...I will be back to see how frequently new inventory is added...,UNK
1949,"Appetizer was garlic toast.  It was overlooked and dried out. The Cobb salad was ordinary and tasteless. Tasted as if it had been made a couple days ago.  The waitress was nice and attentive.  As many restaurants as there are here, there must be a COUPLE better!",UNK
1950,"OMG!  So I call this restaurant for delivery and they pick up and hang up...Ordinarily I would say it was an accident but after the 5th call and they hung up, of course I just kept doing it until i got a fast busy....awful",UNK
1951,Nothing fancy except the prices. My food was kind of gross too. Gf seemed to like it so I am giving this place an extra star otherwise they would have gotten a one.,UNK
1952,Messed up my order the told me it was what I ordered. What I ordered was not even a soup but that's what I got. Then I had to pay for it? Won't be going back!,UNK

1954,Love love this place! The burgers are incredible and you can build your own with so many delicious toppings and seasonings! My favorite though are the incredible milk shakes and the truffle fries! Sometimes I just go and eat those two things! Sooo good!,UNK
1955,"Nice hotel but false advertising with the offer of wifi (part of 'resort fee'). No wifi available... Get with the times Paris.. Don't pay that fee if u come here... Get with it, Paris!",UNK
1956,"Meh...had the green eggs and ham. Hubs had the big breakfast. Was okay--how can you go wrong with breakfast, though.  But I gotta admit that the fresh squeezed orange juice was awesome.  For the overall price, however , considered this restaurant overrated.",UNK
1957,Loved the trainers but unfortunately I had to move and they made me pay 25% of my remaining contract to get out of it.  If I were just being lazy and not going that would be one thing but I'm moving out of state and feel penalized.  Nothing personal against the gym but this contract thing is ridiculous!!!,UNK
1958,We finally tried the Red Rock location and we liked it.  There were big portions and I couldn't even finish my meal. We tried the Fried Dill pickles.  It was pretty good.,UNK
1959,Food is amazing! Service could be friendly and the wait was really long but that is just because they are so popular that they are really busy on the weekends.,UNK
1960,"Good selection, terrible prices. Honestly, anyone who purchases beer here must not know it's less expensive literally anywhere else in he valley.\n\nThe 5 cent wine sale is awesome, so are the craft beer glasses, but that's about it. Their hours suck.",UNK
1961,Clean rooms\nVery nice customer service\nmain pool is beautiful\nshuttle service is limited to one stop\nrooms looked better in the pictures but were still nice\nand hands down most comfortable bed i have ever slept on in a hotel room\n over all it was nice and affordable.,UNK

1963,Great food! The balls are great. Staff is nice. The curry chicken was bomb. Was a nice treat from out of town. The drinks are different too. A+++,UNK
1964,"This gyms okay, lots of machines friendly staff, parking isn't a big issue but it tends to get packed.... Most likely because it's the new year. You can't go wrong with there pricing. I guess if your gonna work out go really early in the morning or late at night",UNK
1965,"I love this resort, grounds are beautiful. I love the pool areas and the service is always amazing. They treat you like royalty here.",UNK
1966,Their chicken smell bad and so does their fatty pork and beef.  All roberts tacos need to improve their recipe.... they all smell bad.,UNK
1967,Wow amazing TACOS!!! I crave them all the time. The sauce is the best... I had the beef ones with chiptole sauce.. I wish they could be every where all the time. And they have the best customer service. Oh and i just tried the dumpling those are really good too.,UNK
1968,Came here because of the reviews. Had high expectation and we waited about 20 mins to be seated. But honestly the red lobster cooked better seafood. The grilled shrimps were very dry. Our server disappeared after we got our food. Took FOREVER to ask for our bill.,UNK
1969,Service was wonderful !!!! But the food is not on point at all;/ don't order the pad thai or pepper steak . The meat were all fatty . Ahhhhhh,UNK
1970,Slots are very tight but blackjack tables are plentiful. Beautiful place lots of parking with shuttle. The buffet has a wonderful selection and most of what I tried was good. Drink service very slow if at all in slots. Like lone butte better.,UNK
1971,"Yes, believe it or not. sometimes I like to do my own nails.( sorry Misti) And this little gem I discovered on a trip to china town a few years back. \nThe prices here are rock bottom, and the help speaks English. \nThe selection is amazing !,",UNK
1972,Classic breakfast place. The staff is great and friendly.  It's like going home cause they make you feel like family.  I like the pancakes. So many choice you can have a different flavor every day.  I went on a weekday so i dont know about the long waits,UNK
1973,This place is gone but it was a decent rest stop before getting to Primm.  cheap penny arcade and slots that still paid with change not slips.  Not sure if there are plans to build a new Nevada Landing but it would be a good idea.,UNK
1974,The location is mid strip which I'd ideal for staying on the strip.  The room was just decent nothing horrible nothing great.. The casino has nothing special pretty below average actually.,UNK
1975,"Go to brunch place in Montreal.  Don't know if it's worth the wait though.  Go during the week if you can when it's less busy.  We did and we ended up running into Georges St. Pierre!!  Eggs Benedict and GSP, what more can you ask for.",UNK
1976,Great hotel with great service. The rooms are my favorite in Las Vegas.\nI have stayed there 9 times so far since it has opened. I doubt I will stay any where else for a while!,UNK
1977,"Why didn't I go to Kmart?  Filthy bathroom, already been hit up for money.  Total lack of customer service.  In fact I like to call their customer service department, Lack of Customer Service.  The works always looked over worked and annoyed to have to answer a question or help.  I mean the nerve of me!",UNK

1981,"Fresh food is always in the recipe. I thought there would be more vegetarian fare but I was mistaken; most menu items had meat. While the portions were small, the taste was very large. I would go back but only if my vegetarian choices were expanded.",UNK
1982,Nice restaurant with a Bar-ish feel. I love all the booths along the wall. Great tofu soup.\n\nI also ordered the kimchi pancake which was too greasy!! All in all it was good and I will come back.,UNK
1983,"We go to Sakana on a regular basis. We usually only order sushi. For the price, location, and quality and quantity of the sushi, we really like Sakana.",UNK
1984,3 of the 5 steak meals were not cooked correctly and others tasted mediocre. If you are going to spend $100 per person go somewhere else!!!!!!,UNK

1989,"Great food, great service. I'm guessing it was the manager who took my order two days in a row and he was very cool, and polite. Thanks!",UNK
1990,I used to live next to this park when it was first built (2008ish?) anyways its gone wayyyy down hill! Trash everywhere!!! Even older parks like desert breeze or even angel park are kept up better than this!,UNK
1991,Happy hour gets crazy busy! Must be the fantastic chambord margaritas (limit 3) and appetizers! I'm a huge fan of the Tejas trio dips and the pecan crusted chicken salad.,UNK
1992,the burgers and hot dogs are great here. a quick good solid place to go to if you dont have or want to spend the time to go to a sitdown place.,UNK

1995,"I still like this company; however, if you're going for the flavor of the month, don't go at the end of the month (last 2-3 days). They probably won't have it. Disappointing!",UNK
1996,"I've tried Red Devil twice and have really enjoyed it. Their pizza is a bit different than what you would find at the average Arizona pizza place. I was very pleased with their pepperoni and tried some of their sausage pizza too. The prices are a little high, but I am still looking forward to my next visit.",UNK

1998,"Order your burger \""Carolina Style\"" and get the onion rings. Shakes ain't too shabby either.",UNK
1999,"Have been coming here since they opened. They Have slowly cut back on lots of things,But now the Buffett is not the same in the am it is served out of 5-7 warming plates in the coffee shop , smaller options for food but price did not go down!!!!! Will not be going back to the m.",UNK
2000,"Expensive here, why?  Food takes a long time too, even when you're the only patron in the place.  Feels like a sketchy area too.  More Chicago-themed than many other Gyro places in this part of town.",UNK
2001,"AWFUL! STAY AWAY FROM THESE PEOPLE, they service a yard in my neighborhood and told me they do not landscape in my zipcode but only service north scottsdale and north phx.",UNK
2002,Nice place with a good atmosphere. I had the soup and salad. The salad bar is good. There is a good selection of toppings and they keep it clean. The tortilla soup was fantastic. The staff was very friendly. Definitely a place I will visit again!!,UNK
2003,Love this place everything is usually always great. Its in my home town so when I am home visiting I make sure I eat here at least once. \nMy only complaint is the decor is tacky and outdated. But then again who cares the foods great.,UNK
2004,Bad customer sevice compounded by  a manager with zero peaple skills\nAKA: Melanie.......Won't Be back...........!,UNK

2008,"i went here to get my tooth extracted, and i was scared and frightened like crazy. This dentist has to be the best dentist i've ever experienced. i didnt feel any pain and he made me feel at ease, before i knew it the tooth was out. I will definetly refer him my family members.",UNK
2009,"The food was average at best. I spent three days here and had 3 lunches and 3 breakfasts here. Something, likely one if their salads did not agree with me and I was reminded about it for about 18-24 hours.",UNK
2010,"The food was good. I will start with that. However, everything else is...odd. From everyone and their mother being able to manhandle your food at the counter, to the lack of space to just stand without being in someone's way, to the absolute suckfest that is parking, LGO is okay. Nothing more.",UNK
2011,We have several pieces from the Land of Ahhs in our home and every time I walk in I see something that I can easily use to accessorize without breaking the bank. I love this store!,UNK

2014,Root beer is delicious.  Service is very good.  It's hidden waay in the back of a strip of stores so you won't see it driving by.  Enjoyed or meals.,UNK
2015,This is my third time using Amazing Carpet and Tile Cleaning. Rick as always was great. Him and his assistant cleaned both my carpet and tile. They both came out AMAZING! Rick was particularly accommodating. He helped remove many stains that I thought would never come clean! I could not recommend this service more!,UNK
2016,"Filthy!  There is no reason a \""hole in the wall\"" restaurant needs to be dirty... The floors, the tables, the walls, the stained ceiling!   I DON'T want to see the kitchen!  We ate the food but I might regret it!",UNK

2020,My husband and I had a bad experience renting a car in La Vegas. They tried to charge us for gas even though we filled up before we returned the car.  We had a receipt so we were able to get it removed. Why should we have to go through the hassle.,UNK
2021,These gentlemen are amazing.   My son loves barber shops and when we moved I was worried I would have a hard time finding a new place.   This place is perfect and my son came home very happy with his haircut.,UNK

2023,"For starters, the chairs are so comfortable, you feel like you could sit there forever.  The food was amazing and we shared 5 things including the Peking Duck.  If I had it to do over, we would have ordered 5 ducks....it was that good.  A nice break from the glitz and steaks of the strip.",UNK
2024,Nails looked like I did them myself at home. \nStaff was very nice and friendly. But I asked if it was possible to do a design and they should have said no. They tried and it looked so bad people made fun of them and I went to another salon to have them fixed.,UNK
2025,"The Red Velvette Waffle is on the \""Secret Menu\"" so you have to ask for it. It is definitely worth is. Really rich but oh so delicious.",UNK
2026,"Came here for my birthday. Expecting to eat something rather tasty, but turned out to be pretty disappointing expereince. The ambiance, and the service was really good, however the food was not up to par. Not very authentic.",UNK
2027,"These guys are the most annoying people on the strip! They flick their cards in your face even if you are walking with your wife, kids, parents or what not. Best advice is to just keep walking because they are better protected then you so if you wanted to touch them you go to jail.",UNK
2028,"BEST BURGER I HAVE EVER HAD! Staff is great, place is super clean, and the view doesnt hurt. F'ing amazing!",UNK
2029,Haven't had a bad thing on the menu yet.  And surprisingly authentic!  Must try for the phoenix area.  I'm a regular.,UNK
2030,"The parking lot is the worst, be careful! Seems like alot of items are no longer carried at this store, also the cashiers can be kinda mean. I think Sprouts is a better option and it's right up the street. Plus you won't almost die in the parking lot.",UNK
2031,"I don't know why this place is called \""sky harbor.\"" I imagine a high rise airport for space ships. It's alright. Not bad, not extraordinary. Lot's of walkways. If you have a connecting flight, move faster!",UNK
2032,"Always consistent, always fantastic. Steak prepared like Ruth's Chris, best sides of any steakhouse, excellent atmosphere and service. Absolutely nothing ever bad to say about this establishment after 4 or 5 visits.",UNK
2033,"Not so happy about the fact that our plain's AC system was not working and we had already board the flight, they took as back to the gate and we waited for 3 hours...",UNK
2034,The girls working here are very young. I blame management for not properly supervising them. Watching one of them holding my sundae with one hand and lick the fingers of her other hand was more than I could handle. This was done within sight of another employee who was working on my husband's sundae. They obviously have no clue.,UNK
2035,Had a large group and they accommodated us very well ... Great service and food !!! Horchata is a must try !!!,UNK
2036,"Opening seating, so don't wait around to be seat.  I had the spicy chicken wrap, and it was well worth the price!",UNK

2038,"I've never ate at the restaurant but have ordered for delivery quite a few times.  The lady taking my order is well understood compared to other chinese restaurants.  The broccoli beef, combination chowmein, and shrimp in lobster sauce are our faves here.  Very delicious.  Delivery is quick too.",UNK

2043,"A beautiful little bar with an exciting \""martini\"" list - do step outside your comfort zone and try one of the crafted drinks.",UNK
2044,"The service here was deplorable. I heard several complaints of the lack of service, and I experienced it firsthand. It took 10 minutes to get a menu, and another 20 to get the coke I ordered. How do you forget rice with an entree at an Indian restaurant. I hope the food is excellent, but I doubt it.",UNK
2045,We ate lunch there and ordered club sandwich and soup of the day. Must say we were disappointed in the quality of the meal eating at a high rated resort. The sandwich was cold. The open kitchen area was also noisy with a lot of clanging setting up. But service was good. The food was better at their Flats quick serve take out restaurant.,UNK
2046,"Manager was far from happy to be at work today.  Sewage smell very strong when you walk in and in restroom. General cleanliness issues.  Trashcans smelled horrible. While waiting for a fryer to be available, frozen chicken was placed on fryer shelf which had grease buildup on it.",UNK
2047,Burgers were nice an thick and juicy.  Didn't take advantage of the bottomless fries.  They were ok.  I preferred the red robin steak fries which aren't as hard. \n\nThis place does have a lot more than burgers though.,UNK
2048,"It has been very beneficial to me having been a patient of Dr. Miller for the past twenty years. From the first visit I have always received the finest service. Due to the professional,courteous doctor and his staff I have all my teeth and they feel great, don't forget to floss",UNK
2049,Theresa is amazing.....her customer service.and professionalism is the best. My eyelashes have NEVER LOOKED BETTER! I highly recommend her services.,UNK
2050,Gave us a room that was completely uncleaned then made us wait 30 mins for new room. No one came to apologize or offered to comp us or upgrade us. Not what you expect for a high end hotel on the strip.,UNK
2051,I waited 20 minutes for my asiago bagel and I was the only one in the dining area  but they forgot about it and burned my bagel. Service is terrible.,UNK
2052,I love this place. Had a great lunch and watch Sex in the City here. It was a really good experience. I look forward to going back!,UNK
2053,"Good coffee, employees were nice, but not somewhere I'd go to sit and drink it.  I went to the patio to do some work on my laptop, and couldn't concentrate with the bad music played too loudly through low quality speakers.\n\nFor me, it's definitely a takeout, not a hangout.",UNK
2054,"I love coming here on weeknights or early evenings on the weekends when it isn't too crowded. I also find that the nights there is live music it can get overwhelming but depending on who is playing, can make or break it.",UNK
2055,"Glad to see this place open.   Beer and wine for $2.00, how can you go wrong.\nThe service was good.  The waitress was on the spot.   I had the Philly Steak Pita.\nTaste was good.  Good size portions...   We will be back!!!",UNK

I feel completely satisfied with the service I received and spent my hard earned money on.",UNK
2060,"Got an estimate with Andy Good. Hes super friendly and attentive. Knows the answer to every question and   also gives his professional opinion when needed, then later had a repair done and felt the work was on point and the cost was very fair and reasonable :) great family business!",UNK
2061,i love that there are official rules when it comes to drinking a boot.\n\ni.e. these people are my kind of people.,UNK

2066,Yummy! Loved the bartender. Loved the food (chef trained at French Laundry). Great ambiance. If your looking for history this is your spot house built in '37.,UNK

2068,Curds....\nButter burgers.....\nMilkshakes....\n\nI might be coerced into committing a crime at around 2am if it meant that a bag filled with these beauties was presented to me afterwards....,UNK
2069,"First time take out.    Ribs overlooked and dry.  Brisket was like jerky.    Beans had weird taste, but that is probably their recipe.    Chicken fingers for our son were pretty bad as well.      Can't see this place sticking around long with better barbecue places close by.",UNK
2070,"Went for some Menudo and was very disappointed with what we got.\n1. No \""granitos\"" \n2. Kind of cold.\n3. No Handmade tortillas\nWe order coffee \nNasty cheap coffee",UNK
2071,"I wouldn't expect these prices at a place like the epicenter.  It's definitely a great value, especially with the amount of food you get.  The service was good and the food came out quick.  I ordered the teriyaki shrimp and it was delicious. Great place to hit up after AA5.",UNK

Sorry, but for those prices, we want to be treated like A List celebrities.  We'll shop at the more friendlier Mid Century shops in town, thank you very much.",UNK
2075,One of the few remaining REAL sandwich shops in America... this one in particular has a great staff that's fast & friendly. I think I may be clinically addicted to their sausage sandwiches!,UNK
2076,Went with my girl here before heading to the strip.  Burgers were both Juicy and flavorfull.  We both Especially liked the bulgogi.  Garlic parm frys were good too.  Nice and crispy and were cooked in fresh oil.  I would come here again.,UNK

2079,"I love Harold's. I have never been able to go there at night because I have two small children. So, all I can comment on is the food quality. I LOVE it! Everything has been good. From the pizza to the roast beef. Its a great place to go, especially with a child in their terrible twos.",UNK

2081,"The food was good but, for the price, there are a lot better steak houses.  For this price point, I would suggest Donovan's or Mastro's.",UNK
2082,Fitzgerald's is a solid Pub to grab a drink before going to an event/game uptown. The beer list isn't extensive but they have some decent options. Their food and service are both average.,UNK

2084,"I always love a trip to the neighborhood Applebee's in South Phoenix when I'm in town. The recent remodel looks great. Service, drinks, and food were excellent tonight!!!",UNK

2087,"Good service, easy to get a hold of, and good quality equipment. I got the 2gig system which was recommended for me, and it makes having a security system so convenient. I can ARM it accross the country, if I wanted to! Highly recommended!",UNK
2088,"Wow, I was disappointed. I rolled in for dinner at 7:00 pm looking for a couple slices and a soda. They only had some cheese left and the the slices were really small. I mean like half the size of anybody elses regular slice. The pizza tasted OK, nothing spectacular.",UNK
2089,"I enjoyed this hotel. Great gym if your want to workout, room was well done with a super comfortable bed. \n\nI would have given it 4 stars if it didn't have a resort fee. (I just don't care for them)",UNK

2091,Just your basic burger joint..  They do have a few other interesting things on the menu which I have not tried.  For the money I would rather go to Smashburger if it were closer.  I would eat here again because it is the best burger nearby for sure.,UNK
2092,I thought Joyce did a fantastic job with my wedding dress.  It was significantly large when I brought it to her and it fit perfect when I picked it up.  I got more than one comment that it fit like a glove.  She was timely and friendly.,UNK

2097,We made the mistake buying a expensive deal voucher expecting a high end Chinese meal. The food was bland. But worse was the miserable staff. Not a smile among them with the exception of our waitress. I'm beyond upset that I spent as much as I did for 10$ Chinese deal.,UNK
2098,"Starbucks at the student union is a continuous disappointment. Their cup stock is often low, they only have Grande size. Not to mention, they don't post a sign to tell you this, so after waiting in line for 15 minutes, the cashier gladly informs you that you have wasted your valuable time.",UNK
2099,"So many great choices at this place, it's sometimes a hard decision when ordering but my favorite is La Fiesta pizza. It has such a fun mix of flavors",UNK
2100,"We only came here because of the girls....I mean they needed to blow off some steam so we let them run wild to play games, ride roller coasters, and other rides. I would not stay here at this hotel for a night, but that was never our intention anyways!",UNK
2101,"Justin was just out today to clean my home windows and screens.  Wow, what a difference!

2104,"Food was good, but, the service was horrid. Staff was more interested in spending time socializing with their friends who were also there.",UNK
2105,"Food was excellent and our server was exceptional.  He was friendly, checked back with us often, and made sure we had a great meal.  I would go back for the food, but the server we had put it over the top for me.",UNK

2107,It's not one of my fave haunts. I heard about their shake from a friend. I thought it was just OK. I prefer McDonald's or In & Out's Milkshakes.,UNK

2110,"The food was really good, even my daughter liked it.  The service was ok, i was with a big group so that might have lessened the service. It took kind of awhile to get our order.  I will most likely eat here again.",UNK
2111,5 star service my butt! I literally saw 3 people come in and just stand in the lobby. No greeting from the owner...nothing! I left. Will never come back or recommend.,UNK
2112,It's just like every other Chili's. Nothing special but I have NOTHING to complain about. I wouldn't tell anyone they HAVE to go here because who seriously hasn't been to a Chili's before. We always get the 2 for $20.,UNK

2115,Dr. Andriola is the only reason we go here. The wait is usually long and I notice that those without an appointment usually get seen quicker then those that do.,UNK
2116,Way overrated burger. Hard to believe when paying 21$. The service was good it's a shame the food didn't match.,UNK
2117,Had some honey BBQ chicken fingers and fries. They were a bit over cooked which made them very dry. The fries here are good but fries alone are not going to make me return.,UNK
2118,I can't believe this place closed down.  The food here was consistantly good and the Green Tea Creme Brulee was to die for.  Damn.,UNK
2119,These people are at it again.  Seems like they kept a low profile for awhile and now they are back calling thinking we all forgot about the reports on CNN.  The phone number is 925 271-2244.  The only thing to do is block the phone # since they are a so-called charity.,UNK
2120,burgers were cold .....i was not impresed ...18 % gratuity for our party of six and the service was just ok ....i will never go back,UNK
2121,"Service was horrible. Waitress brought out 2 meals, then forgot the other 2 dishes. Not to mention she never put in 1 dish which was a calzone for my daughter.  Chicken parm dinner was over peppered. Never will return.",UNK
2122,"The folks running this place remain enthusiastic and friendly, but the food has become a bit too sweet, even the savory dishes are much too sweet. It is too bad as I really liked the food the first few times we went.",UNK
2123,Had a ton of Oatmeal delivered to our office (catered). Everything was delivered ontime. Easy to order and super nice deliver. Oatmeal was perfect.,UNK
2124,I love this place. It's clean and cute but small. Can get busy at lunch times but worth the wait. I always get the Kalbi plate or the dumping rice cake soup. And always gotta start with their mandu which is potstickers. They are crispy golden deliciousness of goodness paired with a perfect sauce.,UNK
2125,"Love these guys, my husband and I missed our flight by 6 minutes, but the woman at the counter got us on the next flight out for no additional charge.  This is why I fly them, their people are great and there's no bullshit fees.",UNK

2127,"Clean, great menu.  Kids get frozen custard included with a kids meal which is a nice touch.\n\n4 stars instead of 5 because the staff is not as friendly as other Culvers I have been at.  Maybe something to do with the location of the restaurant.",UNK
2128,"Good food, good drinks.  Free Bacon, fishbowls.  What could be better.  The Wando burger is always good and the specials are always pretty good.  Its at least worth a stop.  Tons of parking in the lot next door is cheap also.  Its big enough for Kohl center events.",UNK
2129,Excellent food  excellent service.  It was a bit more expensive than their online menu shows. But it was already pricey. Good portions of food but we were not overstuffed. Had the chateaubriand. Yum!!!   Really lovely interior,UNK
2130,"Great food.  I had the lamb shank and it was fall off the bone super delic.  It was not too gamey, well cooked with great flavor.   They have a good selection of food and I hear the Gyro's are amazing.  I would repeat and try the gyro's next time.  Great service also.",UNK
2131,They have lost clothing on me twice and I still have not received a call or follow up on an article of clothing they lost.  Should have come on here first!,UNK

2133,My father really likes the fried rice and my mother likes the evil jungle princess. The soup is plenty for three people so Id recommend ordering smaller portion. The evil jungle princess curry is not as thick as the other curry. It is more like a soup.,UNK
2134,"The facility is lovely and evry time you go i. You see the magnitude of it.  The tour I didi showed the new locker room, practice room and workout equipment.   It is a nice arena for the games and a good  concert venue.",UNK
2135,Quality pizza all the way. The cheese crust and sauce were of such high quality this easily is the best pizza I have had in Las Vegas. I have ordered from them several times and they are consistently amazing. Great job guys!,UNK
2136,"I love their hummus! I also ordered the steak kebab plate and was overwhelmed and really happy! The rice smelled so good, the steak was so soft, juicy and tasty! Top this off with onions and tomatoes. Plus place looks clean and comfortable to eat at, and staff are nice.",UNK
2137,"Lobster truffle Mac n Cheese is where it's at!!! I was dissapointed when it came out in sucha  small bowl but I couldn't finish, it was so rich and creamy!! yummm!! the shakes...eh I can do without",UNK
2138,"Seriously amazing! I came here with a friend a few weeks ago. We shared the NY cheese sandwich, bruschetta: fresh mozzarella with tomato and basil, prosciutto with figs and mascarpone, and of course, a few glasses of wine. Everything was delicious and so fresh!",UNK
2139,Exellent service at the best price.  I will highly highly recommend the company. They went above and beyond to accommodate my request. Each department of theirs is awesome .. Right from marketing to the execution.. Thanks a lot Travis!!,UNK
2140,"Service is more on the rude side... We found a hair in our water and when we asked the waitress for new water and glasses the she acted upset and inconvenience and did not apologized. The establishment over all is dirty. The food was good, not good enough to come back.",UNK
2141,"Fun place!  The service is great, the outside patio is awesome, and the drinks are strong.  They have a coed bathroom which is a bit odd but a surprisingly good place to meet people, no specific dance floor (so people just dance anywhere) and their drinks are pretty expensive, but overall, a very fun night out.",UNK
2142,"This place is amazing! Reuel is very helpful and knows what he's doing. It feels like everyone here genuinely cares about you, which is what any patient should feel with their physician.\n\nI highly recommend this facility and Reuel Aspacio to anyone else seeking this type of service.",UNK
2143,The area surrounding this mall looks a little scary and so are the people.  I wouldn't really spend my time shopping in the area unless I had a security guard following me and I consider myself a tough dude... haha.  They do have a variety of shops but there are also a few areas that are empty.,UNK
2144,"Eh, was somewhat disappointed at the food really. It seemed like the chef over tried when dishes came out. Sometimes less IS more and that wasn't a part of the restaurant that day. \nI'll go again for another chance though :)",UNK
2145,"Fantastic dinner for the family.  Great Gluten Free section of menu, and they knew how to handle the food correctly to prevent cross contamination. \n\nJust do it!",UNK
2146,Service and the Guinness were great. Corned beef sandwich was very good. The bluegill and the calamari were very saltly. The breading on the bluegill was too salty to eat. The waitress and Manager both sincerely apologized and took money off the bill. Stick with the Irish food and it should be good,UNK
2147,There are many better places than this for anything. Poor hours not very good don't eat here unless you have to even than maybe just wait,UNK
2148,"As far as \""airport\"" Gelato - it was good and I would eat it again. I ordered tiramisu and vanilla bean - great choices.",UNK
2149,These tools want to charge $3 to enter just grab lunch and place a bet on the horses. I would avoid it just on that principal alone.,UNK
2150,"I had a frozen hot chocolate and immediately felt ripped off. It was the white chocolate, and shouldn't be hyped or cost more than something from Starbucks or a boba shop.",UNK
2151,Soon to be famous deep fried cheese burger--OMG!!! Need I say more? Of course there are other items available on the menu.  It's always crowded on game days so I would recommend going on a non-game day if you want better service.,UNK
2152,One of my favorite places.  Prices are cheap and the food is great.  I have traveled a lot and this place had the best gyro than anywhere!  I highly reccommend this place!,UNK
2153,"I don't see it.  Order the beer battered chicken for take out.  was two pieces, thigh and drum. It was ok, I had better.  The mac salad was so-so.  All for $9+.  3 stars is being kind.",UNK
2154,Place needs an update big time. Room and beds are decent. Elevator and hallways are run down. Neighborhood is under construction but overall it's ok. Lots of bars and night life. Would give it another star but not for the price I paid.,UNK
2155,"The atmosphere was cool and the food was pretty good, although the service was terrible. Messed up our order and the wait time to get our drinks, food, bill, etc was ridiculous.",UNK
2156,"DO NOT go here. Have been going here for 3 years and quality has gone way done. Now, my diamond ring has been \""lost\"" under some questionable circumstances, and they are refusing to help me or look or do anything. Don't let this happen to you.",UNK
2157,"First time here and it's so loud you have to yell across the table if you want to talk also you can't hear the waitress and they can't hear you very poor atmosphere, probably will not come back I don't like that I have to yell just to talk at dinner. Very disappointed for my first time here.",UNK
2158,Food is average. Make sure you take all your valuables with you. Their parking lot is known for multiple break-ins a week.,UNK
2159,"I LOVE this Petsmart! I shop here, adopted my cat and my dog here, use the grooming salon (well, not personally) and just really like everything about it and its employees! They really go above and beyond to help you figure out and find what you need.",UNK
2160,very cool place.. great music.. good beer..did not eat here so i cant tell you about that..but it is like walking into a different world when you go into this place,UNK
2161,The service was very slow. Took forever for drinks. The breakfast buffet was limited but the food was good. Service workers were cold and appeared to want you in and out. Probably wouldn't go back.,UNK
2162,Absolutely awesome experience. Traveling through on business and decided I needed a new tattoo. Anthony managed to work me in and did a fantastic job. Nice atmosphere with some amazing artwork on display too. I'll be back.,UNK
2163,"This is a great place in vegas to have a romantic dinner, right across the Bellagio fountains. The service was great. I have been here a few times and the food was always delicious, steak cooked just like we wanted it. Very decent prices for the quality of the food and the set up.",UNK
2164,Pizza isn't bad but they could be friendlier. Also it would be nice to know that ranch is additional when you pay-it is inconvenient to pay extra what you use credit. Service was okay.,UNK
2165,This place just had 6 health code violations this past week...made the dirty dining list.  One item was a filthy soda machine....will be removing this place off my list!  Check it out on Dirty Dining Channel 5 in AZ.,UNK
2166,They have the BEST wings...not fried! They now offer grass fed and hormone free burger...YUM!,UNK
2167,"Great service and great food.  The bread they used for the subs was so good.  If you eat here get the fresh cut fries, they're also amazing.  Nice lunch environment!",UNK
2168,Another great massage. The one hour reflexology is the way to go! John and Amy were great.  I love that I can get a couple's massage and have a place open late enough to accommodate mine and the s.o's busy schedule.  We will be back regularly!,UNK
2169,"Really, better sauce comes in a jar!  No basil on caprese salad, and swimming in dressing.  But what do I know.  Never had caprese salad with dressing.",UNK
2170,This was an incredible opportunity to spend $68.00 and 3 hours for 4 beers. It was impossible to get food with the 2 hour long lines at each of the 25 trucks. The trucks didn't anticipate the massive crowd and ran out of food. \nThe event was completely overbooked!!,UNK
2171,"You get what you pay for.\n\nThe buffet was like 6 bucks.  The lady was nice enough to hook me up with a coupon  to make it like 4 bucks.\n\nSmall buffet.  Not very good.  \n\nI was fed, and full.  Mission accomplished!",UNK
2172,"Been here a few times and as of last weekend, I won't be coming back. The Pho doesn't taste THAT great anymore (or maybe I just have to be drunk to enjoy it) and the service was rude and rushed. .. Would rather pay $20 for a bowl of Pho on the strip.",UNK
2173,It's old and smells off!  Always have to wait in long lines to check out AND NO SELF CHECK OUT!  Never been impressed with Basha but this is one of their low end stores.,UNK
2174,"This is truly a luxury hotel at an affordable price. The rooms are spacious, unique and stylish. This is a hotel youd expect to be on the strip. The buffet is beyond good and has a selection size you will never find anywhere else. This hotel is a true success!",UNK
2175,"Jose, Naira, and Kiyanna are always so welcoming.  Naira remembers me buying my house all the way back in 2010 and asked how it was and Jose was quickly to say hi how are you!  I only frequent the bank once a monthly maybe and for them to remember was pretty surprising and appreciated.",UNK
2176,Wasnt the cleanest place any time ive gone. Prices of the drinks were always changing. Only decent thing was the music.,UNK
2177,"Good cheap lunch after a long poker tournament. $10 bucks for a chili cheese dog, fries and a coke. Adequate, not something you can get everywhere and didn't feel price gouged.",UNK
2178,"We stopped in for dinner at about 7:30 one evening. wo other tables of customers, yet it took almost 10 minutes for the waitress to get to us. Then another 10 minute wait to get our drinks, then more waiting to order our food. Seems to have taken forever to get our food, which was mediocre at best.",UNK
2179,"Worst. Bar. Ever. Find someone to buy you a pint of crappy Canadian whiskey, and then take your money to Espresso Royale and give them the business whilst drinking on the sly. Now.",UNK
2180,"No impressed.  While the All You Can Eat Sushi lunch special sounds appealing, it is less than that.  I'd be willing to try this place out for dinner but I won't be back for lunch.",UNK
2181,"In a city like Montreal, you have to have great food to survive.  Unfortunately, this place focuses all energy on appearance and being trendy, with the food taking second stage.  Unless you're the type of person who just wants to be seen, it's not worth the long line.",UNK
2182,"Best Authentic Mexican Food in town around. I would typically travel the ways to Don Ponchos for some bomb.com type of food. I found their replacement. Must try spot. Tacos on point along with their Menudo and burritos. The Pastor has flavor like no other, that alone has me coming back for more.",UNK
2183,Worst nightclub ever. I was trying to leave when in dark stairwell was attacked by a bouncer. I fought to get free from him. Very scary experience. Did police report all night & nobody cared. Had bruises all over arms & chest. Never heard from nightclub or police again.,UNK
2184,"Horrible service, they keep delaying the delivery of our order, they say they arrived and called with no answer to buy more time, when called to complain got hang up on, DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE \nPS: I'm not an ex-employee",UNK
2185,"The food was ok! Prices were reasonable. I got the almond French toast. It was simple, came with a side of fruits. Coffee was really strong and just what I needed for the morning. My boy friend got the steak hash. It was alright for the price, nothing special! Would I come back for breakfast? Nope!",UNK
2186,"If you are looking to start your day with a cold shower (in a super small bathroom) and a dark room, this is the place to stay. The staff actually was very nice, the property is just a total disappointment.",UNK
2187,"Nice, clean restaurant with a really friendly environment! The staff are really friendly and the chefs quirky!\n\nThey always cook my steak to perfection!",UNK
2188,"I just used Epic to clean several rooms in my home as well as 2 sofas.  They were fantastic!  The workers were professional and they made sure I got an exact quote before they started cleaning, so I didn't have any surprises.  The carpets turned out great, as did the sofas.  I would definitely use this company again!",UNK
2189,Not good unless you are over the age of 45 and looking for a guy over the age of 50 haha... can't believe people wait for hours and might not even get in sometimes for this place... worst place ever.,UNK
2190,"I will reiterate what many others have said. Food is above average. Service is poor. We've been there half a dozen times and besides waiting a long time for our food, they almost always forget something or bring us the wrong food. With better servers/server training, this place could be 4 stars easy.",UNK
2191,"The best happy hour tacos! They won at the taco festival in Scottsdale. They not only have a great menu but also a cool vibe. You have got to check it out! Go in and ask for Larry, he will take great care of you. Enjoy!",UNK
2192,"With Sweet treats a-plenty, this is a great place to grab a quick yummy on your way back to your room. \n\nI went with the gelato and couldn't have made a better choice. With lots of flavors it hit the spot on pretty much any hot Vegas day.",UNK
2193,"Gnocchi was delicious, service was good. Need to eat here again to give a better, full review.  Will be back at some point.",UNK
2194,"China A Go Go is a China A No No. Over thirty minutes late. Half the order was wrong. I had to call three times, and the quality of mediocre. Very disappointing.",UNK
2195,"This place is now US Egg's.  Food wasn't bad, just not a lot of flavor and im a guy that likes a lot of spice.  Service was adequate as well.",UNK
2196,"I enjoy this bar sometimes.  THey have pretty cheap drinks, but it can get packed very quickly which can be annoying.  They have games going on in the back and on one side of the bar so there is plenty to do if they aren't taken by everyone.",UNK
2197,"Meh. After all the rave I thought it would be amazing but not really. We ordered the cookie sundae and it was good, but not spectacular. To be honest I was really disappointed that there wasn't more chocolate options. The cookie one was the best we could do.  I'll pass next time.",UNK
2198,"I go back and forth with this one.  Sometimes the service rocks and the food is great. Other times the food stinks and the service is not so good.  I guess it depends on what is happening at this place when you visit, new staff, etc.  But always pricy.",UNK
2199,"Too many great places to go, would NOT recommend. Food wasn't anything great, very pricey.  Meatball was ok, wait staff was off and on. Disappointed. And wish I would have gone elsewhere. Don't think this restaurant has the class for this hotel!!",UNK
2200,"Great price, super filling. The steak tacos (tacos de asada) were the best ones I ever had, paired with rice, beans and Pico de gallo.",UNK
2201,"Overpriced.  At these prices the food quality should be better. The food isn't bad   but not great either, not good enough to justify the prices.",UNK
2202,"Their boba is delicious but service could really improve. Not quite attentive or friendly, especially when it gets a little crowded. \n\nI suggest the Matcha Green Tea w/ Boba. Comes with a generous amount of green tea ice cream on top of your actual drink.",UNK
2203,"Honestly, I hate to be the hater but the food here was awful and the wait staff was extremely slow.\n\nHowever, I do feel sightly bad because the wait staff, even though slow, were extremely friendly people.  I will not say to avoid this place because they are nice people, just proceed with extreme caution.",UNK
2204,"The fish tacos were delish.   The lobster bisque was awful.   It had a poor after taste, too sweet, and was missing any noticeable lobster.  We splurged on the diets with the sourdough bread and while I feel guilty on one hand the other was happy because the bread was yummy.",UNK
2205,"I miss Fusion Burritos, dang construction. I love the ideas they have an d the concept. Keep up the awesome work and brainstorming, change is good.",UNK
2206,"Food was greasy and gross, couldn't eat the grease-soaked potato cakes, sandwich had dry bread and hardly any beef-the employees don't seem to care, this place blows!",UNK
2207,"Some friends and I decided to check this place out due to the good ratings. We ordered chicken larb, green curry, and 2 noodle bowls. The prices are great, and the food we had was too. I loved my beef noodle bowl, just the right amount of spice i asked for. Worth checking out.",UNK
2208,They were so extremely helpful. I had a million questions about my hair and wigs  vs my hair and extensions and she was very informative!,UNK
2209,Worth the wait! This place is gloriously decorated and the staff is wonderful. I wish the patio was available for reservations. Each and every plate was beautifully executed and delicious. This place lives up to its reputation.,UNK
2210,"Had the wonton soup and pork chop with egg and rice. Not bad, but nothing to rave about either. Good cost-performance at 10 dollars for what I have got.",UNK
2211,"Because there is no ZERO.\nWhat a hyped up joke and the view is terrible, JFC, The Mix is right around the corner if you want a view.\nWith all there is to do in FLV, going to the airport home is better than going here.",UNK
2212,AKA - PHX Sky Harbor International Airport. The airport is the primary regional hub and gateway for Mexican and Hawaiian departures for Tempe-based US Airways and is the third-largest focus city for Southwest Airlines. US Airways and Southwest are the airport's two largest carriers.,UNK
2213,"I was very impressed. Food was excellent, service was the best, and very affordable. They were able to accommodate a big group of us (17 people) with ease.",UNK
2214,"The usual coffee-based beverages, brought to you by some very nice people.  The veggie wrap is the best I've ever had.  There is a drive-thru if you are especially lazy.  And it's in an old oil change place!  How fun is that?!",UNK
2215,"Great staff, yummy burgers. Not a place to go to if you're in a rush, there was a wait to be seated when I went.",UNK
2216,"The fried beet falafel was by far the best falafel I had ever tasted. Grilled chicken wings were also delicious. I wasn't really sure if we had a designated waitress, as two different servers kept checking in with us. Both servers were very friendly and attentive.",UNK
2217,"This tiny scary building is hiding something, kick a** food! Greasy, fast, cheap and flavor to spare. You got to love it. My personal fav. is the Super Nachos!",UNK
2218,"Olive Garden, never awful but never good. The mediocrity of cheap Italian dining.\n\nThe staff were nice. The food average. The meal uneventful.",UNK
2219,food was delish and the place was a nice change from the large supersized celebrity chef restaurants on the strip!  I have to say though...it is a small space and don't be put off by the hotel it's located in.,UNK
2220,"Don't waste your money. Food wasn't bad, but it wasn't great and at $40-$50 a person not worth it. Meat was tough and tasteless. Salad/side bar was nice, but again nothing memorable. Honestly, I've had this good of food at golden coral.",UNK
2221,"Good breakfast place. Good service. Can't say I'm a fan of the baked goods though, the muffins I had were a bit dry",UNK
2222,"This is generally a very good burger/bar food joint on the strip. The food tastes great and the atmosphere is fun, but service is very slow and the prices are fairly high. The jalapeno poppers looked incredible though.",UNK
2223,Hands down the best sushi in Scottsdale!  No need to ever go to Stingray again!  Especially since it is walking distance from my home!,UNK
2224,"Allie was great! She was quick, organized and was a \""chatty Cathy\"", but in a good way. She has the best colors and gives the best color advice for your nails. Looking forward to going back just to visit her!",UNK
2225,"they have good craft beers on tap. that is literally all they have going for them. it was hardly busy, and it took the bartender nearly 10 minutes just to look at us. the whole concept is great, but this place is disorganized, and the staff are unprofessional and inhospitable. will not return.",UNK
2226,"If you want an upscale atmosphere and like martinis you should check it out.  Some might consider it to be \""pricey\"", but like everything in life you get what you pay for.  I recommend the Butterfingertini.",UNK
2227,I surprised my dad with this Marvel Experience.  He was like a kid playing with all of the activities.  We stayed and played for almost two and a half hours. The lines were short and we didn't wait long to participate.  I was a little hesitant going with the bad reviews but am glad we went. We made our own experience a good one.,UNK
2228,HORRIBLE experience. OVER PRICED- do not waste your money. I had an overlay with polish and they were so bumpy... They looked like a 3 year old polished them. I had to go back three days later to get a nail fixed and they still look BAD! Never again.,UNK
2229,"Best. Vietnamese. Egg rolls. Ever!!!! Vietnamese egg rolls are my favorite things and I've tried many!!  These were perfectly crisp on the outside, with the filling perfectly flavored. I ordered take-out and they were still perfect 20 minutes later!!  I highly recommend this restaurant!!",UNK
2230,"I wasn't impressed with this place. The menu sounds really great& the waitress suggested I get the chicken bacon Mac & cheese, but it was disappointing to say the least.",UNK
2231,"Friendly staff, and great upstairs. Good views of the high street. They still don't get iced lattes quite right, but that's seemingly true for most Starbucks outside the states.",UNK
2232,"Great place for horseback riding!  Debbie and Mike are awesome, nice gentle horses and beautiful ride!  Definitely would highly recommend this stable for a great time!",UNK
2233,"Earnest help who want to please. I eat meat occasionally, but only hormone free. Would go to this convenient place if they had a healthy hamburger; either grass fed and/or hormone free.",UNK
2234,"I have been eating at Avina's since it was located on Bell rd.  The owners are friendly and always remember you.  I love the Bun (Rice Vermicelli with salad and fish sauce), the sweet potato cake and the spring rolls.",UNK
2235,"I was interested in their services, but got stonewalled by their website. Their website sucks. No prices listed anywhere, and the 'contact us' form doesn't work. (\""Submit\"" button constantly grayed out)",UNK
2236,I brought my 8 year old daughter to Salon Ambiance and she walked out of there feeling beautiful and confident. She was treated like royalty and the whole time there I kept seeing nothing but smiles and giggles coming from her little face. I highly recommend Salon Ambiance.,UNK
2237,"Great place to have some wine and cheese. Yesterday they had a live jazz band, great touch. Had a great time with my wifey.",UNK
2238,"I love Ross! This one is super nice and always has new stuff coming in! The clothes are kind of a packed together like sardines but I guess it depends on what your looking for! Overall, its nice for a day of shopping, even if you don't know what your looking for you'll leave with something!",UNK
2239,"Real quick update. They now offer sweet potato fries as a free alternative to their regular fries. I decided to go with them today to accompany my teriyaki burger instead of the norm, and they were amazing.",UNK
2240,"This cupcake place simply sucks. You have to wait to get in, but once you taste the cupcakes they are horrible. The cake has no flavor and lacks something.  The toppings make it appealing until you taste the whole cupcake.  I tossed the cupcake I bought for lack of flavor, my kids also got rid of theirs.",UNK
2241,Here for a conference.  Toilet plugged. Put on hold to talk to someone about.  Room bathroom smells like mildew.\n\nWent to get a bagel 6 people behind counter. No one would take my order for 5 minutes.\n\nAm told conference won't be here again,UNK
2242,LOVE THIS PLACE!  I have not had a single thing that I did not enjoy and the portions are big enough for sharing.  Leftovers are great the next day.,UNK
2243,Thank you Pablo for the wonderful experience you provided to Emilio & I. We were both very pleased with the service. We'll be back!,UNK
2244,Food is.decent. karoake is the best I've gone to in a long time. The place is super small.though. that is the biggest disadvantage and why I give it 3 stars. You are practically sitting on top of people.,UNK
2245,"Great spot!! loved their food, and great location. The restaurant is beautiful inside, and really enjoy dining in. Give it a try, you will love it.",UNK
2246,"Loved this!!   Had some humor, excellent music and these actors made it a perfect show to see.  This show is a must for your Vegas itinerary.  Don't miss it!",UNK
2247,This restaurant is horrible.  The waitress was rude and tried to rush us.  The only oyster on the menu is a terrible patty of some kind.  How can you call yourself an Oyster House and not serve either fried oysters or raw???  The food overall was ok.  I would never go or eat there again!,UNK
2248,"I love Lawry's Prime Rib, the best Prime rib in the world.  When I visti Las Vegas this is my first stop.  You won't be disappointed in your food.",UNK
2249,"I had my birthday dinner here Friday and it was one of the best meals of my life! The steak tartare, the onion bread, the whisky flights...literally everything was spectacular, including the service. We can't wait to make reservations on our next trip to Vegas!",UNK
2250,I had the pleasure of servicing a referral from Nate's office....An amazing experience for the out of town client....he coached and prepared them so that we were the successful bidder in a multiple offer situation...I highly recommend Nate and his Team.....,UNK
2251,Its a good japanese restuarant. It is not a sushi bar. It only provides sushi rolls and sashami.\n\nIts Good but not great. It is run by Japanese staff. Which is a sign of quality.,UNK
2252,"They told me they could fix my car, but when they were done, they found more wrong with it.  A fifth grader could have done better.",UNK
2253,Overpriced \nStuffy \nNo service our room was left dirty \nRoom service cold and awful gaming . Love Louis Vuitton but I can get that anywhere else in Vegas !! Stay elsewhere this place is a joke .the casino is silent no winning here move on lol,UNK
2254,I believe the name has changed to Cous Cous.  I think they have new owners & chefs.  the lamb burger spices have changed for the lesser .  doubt I will return.  I don't like the last 2 new cashiers I've delt with.,UNK
2255,"Food was mediocre. What will forever keep me away again - the service. Sure, they were fast. Basically stood beside our booth, waiting for us to clear a plate. No time to even swallow. Staff looked absolutely miserable! No one was able to answer any questions we had. No refill on coffee. Brutal!",UNK
2256,Bitter&twisted lies.   Ross you where selective with guest.  After you rudely treated us and now give us excuses.  We watched you question nobody after us.   Weak!!!!!!! No help to downtown! !!!,UNK
2257,"- Friendly but very slow service - cook's fault, not the waitress'\n- Small portions and overcooked, dry meat\n- More bland than I expected. Not terrible though",UNK
2258,"If your looking for quick, cheap pizza then by all means come here!  Meat lovers pizza was saturated with grease. Mariners sauce was from a can, just opened 15 minutes ago!   If you have even the slightest palate, this is NOT Italian food!",UNK
2259,Stopped by craving breakfast at 1PM. Service was awesome. Very good food and the prices were reasonable considering where we were. Definitely left feeling good.,UNK

2261,"Didn't have to make an appointment, service was fast called when the car was done. customer service is good. I would recommend Sun auto.",UNK
2262,"Appetizers never got made, brought wrong bowls to the table, they didn't explain how things worked... Very disappointing for a first visit, will not be back!",UNK
2263,The food is very tasty. The restaurant is clean. The beer is priced very well and includes local brews.\nThe radio station IS THE BEST!!!!\nIts good for groups in a semi private room with a scary clown ride!,UNK
2264,"Never got the special promotion that they  promised to give us at the end of my 2 year contract. \nDuring 26 months of membership 2 times charged late fee although money was in account , and my bank said that from their end everything was OK for LVAC to take money for membership. \n\nAlso, to crowded.",UNK
2265,"Nice hotel. Friendly staff. Very nice rooms in HRH Tower.\n\nNice hotel, friendly staff. Clean and quality service. Didn't think the casino was amazing though, fairly average.",UNK
2266,Arrived very late and immediately taken with the ambiance and the VERY cool kitchen that you can watch. Had an incredible meal that I am still thinking about 2 years later all the way here in Chicago.....  I would go back to Vegas just to eat here!,UNK
2267,Great beer selection and food.  The service can be a little slow but you may not mind that since it is a great place to sit around the bar and try some different beers.  One of my favorite places in Vegas.,UNK
2268,"The dresses are wonderful and they range from xs to 3x. \n\nHowever, it is a painful experience every-time I shop there. The sales clerks are just too cool to help me.",UNK
2269,food is soooo good\n\nService is soooo terrible\n\nBut since the food is so delicious we will be back,UNK
2270,Brakes were squealing so stopped by because of the great yelp reviews.  Friendly service and they discussed what they had to do and showed me what was wrong with my car. Family run business made it feel comfortable unlike other places I go for my automotive repairs.,UNK
2271,This place has the worst customer service ever! It's amazing they are still in business. Gives Baskin Robbins a bad name.,UNK
2272,This time we waited 50 mins for our food to come out. We came dring lunch time on Sat. People came after us got their food and we are still waiting. NOT HAPPY.,UNK
2273,My place to go for some good soul food. Always enjoy the food. Meatloaf and Mac and cheese are my go to plates for good eaten,UNK
2274,Great place. Only one other couple there. Impressive table chef ! It's like Benihana only..... without the crowd and all the noise. Great fresh food. I'll go back next time I'm in Vegas!,UNK
2275,"My favorite pizza place!!! omg it is the best!! homemade ranch dressing for the pizza, some hot sauce and chizonas and I am the happiest girl in the world! its this lil whole in the wall but the most amazing food ever! good prices and I always come back!",UNK
2276,"Good full service, international airport. \n\nThe security lines are horrible here but with Pre TSA I am a happy camper when flying out. I think that this airport could use a little face lift however as it seems to look nearly the same as it did 10 years ago. It could also use some more upscale eateries.",UNK
2277,"This is a perfectly reasonable place to go to get a quick bite.  I had the egg croissant, about 5 bucks, came with egg and a big piece of ham.  It isn't the best food but it is filling and less expensive compared to other options in the Venetian.   Service was quick and friendly.",UNK
2278,"I ordered the hummus appetizer which was delicious.   For my entree I ordered the Moroccan chicken.   For my taste it was a little too aweet ,",UNK
2279,"I wasn't all-too pleased with this restaurant. Their coleslaw was good, but their fish, scallops and shrimp came wayyy too overcooked for my taste. I won't be back anytime soon.",UNK
2280,Had a great super quick lunch in the main restaurant! Service was great everyone really friendly and food order was out to the table so fast I was amazed. My cheese enchilada was excellent. The decor is dated just like I remember when I was a kid but that's what makes it the Original. Its a keeper.,UNK
2281,I don't think Gordon has tried his onion rings. To heavy and thick with a very hard batter.  The hog burger is not something I would order again however the sweet potato fries were very good,UNK
2282,"Went for a business lunch, the decor is nice, servers were attentive.  I got a my fish broiled and it was a bit soggy, but tasted alright.  Want to give this place another try as this time wasn't spectacular, but wasn't bad.",UNK
2283,"The food and the staff here are gross, but........  I do believe they have the best salsa in the city.  I come here for rice and salsa only!",UNK
2284,"The ribs are awesome but the service is just ok, people are really nice but you may not see your waiter/waitress for long periods of time. The atmosphere is cool if you like live music and something different. I have been 3 times and will probably go again!",UNK
2285,"I didnt want to be a contrarian, but I did not have a positive experience here, as others have. I ordered a giant pizza well done, and it was anything but. It was soft and mushy and disgusting. Worse still, I emailed them directly but never heard back!",UNK
2286,"This place is in my \""circle of trust\"" when it come to good food and good staff. I suggest trying the shrimp rolls and civeche... AMAZING!",UNK
2287,"Great place to sleep while on vacation, soft pillows and beds. The bathroom is modern and spacious with more than enough room for two people to be at the same time. The food options you have at the ARIA are great but can be pricey depending on where you eat.",UNK
2288,"I love Jamba Juice.  Wish i had access to one locally.  This is a typical airport deal.  Higher prices, mediocre service, and some wait.  out side of that, it certainly has the quality you would expect from this very good smoothie brand.",UNK
2289,"The bacon is phenomenal! It was literally the best bacon I've ever had. I also ordered a Belgian waffle, which was fluffy and flavorful. I think they sprinkle pumpkin pie spices on top as well. Everything was really good but I can't get over how amazing the Apple smoked bacon was.",UNK
2290,Love coming here for the seaweed salad and sweet potato tempura roll. Great happy hour prices and close to campus. The wait is never long for a table and its definitely worth checking out.,UNK
2291,Ordered the Italian sandwich and a coke 17 bucks! Sandwich was just A-okay but I was super hungry so oh well probably would not go back for real food but ice cream looked good.,UNK
2292,"We took the ride inside the grand canal we are staying at the Venetain and recieved 50% off  the ride and it was very nice and relaxing, we got to sing that's Amore with out Gandola driver. You must be 52 inches or taller to ride and wear seat belts.",UNK
2293,There once was a chick who was sure\nShe would dig this new club at Encore.\nThough the guest list was free\nThe dudes were FUG-ly\nAnd the best part was just the d\u00e9cor. \n\n:),UNK
2294,"We were at the New York New York for the Manhattan Express roller coaster... and after walking around so much, we were hungry. \n\nWe shared a hot dog and some fries. Both were edible/decent.. nothing special here.",UNK
2295,"You want Italian? You're no where near New York? Go to grimaldis. NY pizza at its  finest. Great service, great food, great venue. Thank you!!",UNK
2296,"Sadly this restaurant doesn't live up to the name. I dinned with a party of 4, we shared many dishes and not one stood out as fantastic a few were actually bland and not at all what you would expect from a restaurant of this caliber.",UNK
2297,"This place is unreal...i am addicted to the mozzarella, tomato, and basil sandwich.  the bread is so fresh, just try this place out and you wont regret it.",UNK
2298,Another success from yelp!:-)  Ron came out right away and cleared our clogged sewer line. Price couldn't be beat. Won't hesitate to use him again if needed,UNK
2299,First time eating there tonight........ By far out of all the places for good comfort food I just had the best Country fried chicken I have ever had! 5 stars easily. I am absolutely going back!,UNK
2300,"Putting lamb in your burger is not my idea of 'gourmet' burger. Sure it tastes unique, but there are better ways to skin the cat. Good, but after a couple of times I got VERY tired of the 'unique flavor' of their meat.",UNK
2301,"We had a lot of fun on this course.  We played the South course.  Pretty good price, course was in good shape, nice cart people, beer cart girls, and rangers.  Another plus is the food was really good back in the clubhouse when we finished.",UNK
2302,Had a great experience with this company today. They came out quickly and had the work done by the end of the day. It looks great and the price was better than I had expected.,UNK
2303,"We'll done!!! Great craft selection on tap, always new beers on deck. Reverse happy hour worked out great, got a flight and the wings were really good! The bar staff has it dialed in, and know there beers.",UNK
2304,"I came here for the red'd out decor. By any definition, fucking haute. I had the Mahi Mahi tacos. They didn't taste like Mahi Mahi tacos.",UNK
2305,"Good sandwiches. Particularly, the pastrami, corned beef, and beef/cheddar. We always make a stop or two here, when we're in town. Been coming here for 5 years now and sure will come back next time.",UNK
2306,"I don't understand the super low reviews on here, eat here quite often, it's delicious, and fresh, they cook to order.  For mall Asian-style food, you can't beat it!",UNK
2307,"I can knit...fixing mistakes- not so much!  Visiting friends in Scottsdale and needed help.....stopped in and they were gracious, and helpful although I was not a customer. That's good business!  Thank you Jessica(-:",UNK
2308,Never again! Car towed after a 45 minute wait!!! The food is very good. Great menu mix...its just that you really need to devote an hour and a half of your life to enjoy it. Not very conducive in a fast paced place like ASU/ Tempe.,UNK
2309,Seattle Mariners and San Diego Padres Spring Training Home. Beautiful State of the art stadium. Large new shopping mall across the street with lots of restaurants for you after game enjoyment. Parking fee is $5. Be sure to bring your sunscreen.,UNK
2310,"May 03/14:\n\nI do love this place! Avocado Salad, Red Dragon Roll and assorted makis.\n\nThanx again, Watami.",UNK
2311,Their voices are truly amazing.  However the show itself is not good and drags on entirely to long.  These are very talented people but producers and/ or directors they are not.  We got the tickets for free.  I would have been very upset if we had paid money for this.,UNK
2312,Nan's and non veg curry was good....loved the custard fruit salad......biryani was not up to expectation......god knows about veg food....lamb curry was good....,UNK
2313,"I'm from southern Cali and I feel I know really good Mexican food. The only thing that was good was the chips and that's about it. For a place called fajitas, the fajitas were terrible. The price for what you got was bad. The service was below average. I will not be going back.",UNK
2314,"Love it everytime we visit Las Vegas. \nGood music, bikini bull riding, good food/drink prices, good karaoke nights, line dancing. Basically everything a country club should be.",UNK
2315,"This is your one-stop Chinese takeout shop!  Hunan park never disappoints, and they always have your order ready super quick.  I highly recommend the general tsao's chicken.  If you order takeout for dinner be sure to ask for utensils or have your own. Overall, solid across the board!",UNK
2316,"The cute guy is gone.....the new male employee is not cute but he's friendly to the customers, which is important.",UNK
2317,"has recently changed hands and the new owners will not honor the coupons the old owners sold.\n\nDespite the far from warm service in the past, the quality and quantity of the food justified being a regular customer, since the take over the quality and quantity has diminished and we no longer frequent this establishment.",UNK
2318,"Oops ... Wrote this review, but just drove up and they are closed. Disappointing. \n\nWe've been a few times, there is minimal wait, and the chefs are very entertaining.  Quality and quantity of the meal is great.",UNK
2319,"I live right upstairs and come in almost every day, but this weekend seemed to stand out. What a great staff, they always remember you. And food is phenomenal There's a market attached too that delivers to tenants, could use better advertising.",UNK
2320,We went here on a Sunday only because our fave place was closed.  It was an enjoyable evening but nothing special and in my eyes overpriced.,UNK
2321,"I was at the mall, \nGot my nails done on the spot, \nDidn't need to call to make a reservation, and it was fast \nNice People,good service\nWill use again",UNK
2322,"Best theater in the North Valley, clean, spacious, good parking and a great selection of first-run movies. Could use a few more independent films, but overall a great choice.",UNK
2323,CLOSED DUE TO LANDLORD LEASE FORECLOSURE SITUATION\n\nThey're looking to reopen in new space somewhere soon.,UNK
2324,"I really like the bar area, and the bartender was really cool. All of the ketchups were really good. Good fries, good burger. Cool cool place. Prices are really not bad given its location. Wouldn't mind going to the miracle mile shops again for this place alone.",UNK
2325,"Simply put service was horrible food was ok nothing special and finally price was high for quality of service, atmosphere and food...I will not be back and you should stay cleare of this place.",UNK
2326,Had tacos and a Buritto hear last night I must say bomb. I had pastor and a chicken burrito nice size had made tortillas. I went out of my comfort zone to try tripes it was so good I'm going to get some more tonight.,UNK
2327,This buffet is a classic case of you get what you pay for. I went there after playing some poker downstairs. I won so I was in a good mood. Unfortunately the food was just average at best. I give it an extra star because the ice cream was good.,UNK
2328,"Great place to grab lunch.  The pizza (like most pizza joints in the QC) is ok, but their sandwiches are top notch and enormous.  The all you can eat pizza buffet is a nice touch for lunch but a little pricey.  Definitely worth a visit.",UNK
2329,"Not so good experience there. They made us wait a lot without even asking for the drinks. The salad bar was too small for the place and with no variety at all. At one point someone that looked as the owner started arguing with one of the waiters in front of the customers, not a nice experience. The food was good, but not remarkable.",UNK
2330,One of the best places in town to get a meatball sandwich. The place has a cool decor with all Sergio Leone movie posters and the staff is real friendly to everyone that walks in. I always like to support local businesses especially when it comes to good food. Check it out!,UNK
2331,"I've been here a few times, trying something different each time and I've NEVER been disappointed. My boyfriend and I split a California roll out of the case and it was some of the best sushi we've had. The open-faced Croque Madame is a must try as well!",UNK
2332,Great Show ..... went there 3 times ..... only thing is we order drinks and there was mix with water and you know that makes it taste like shit...... for show 5 stars for food 4 for drinks 1.........,UNK
2333,"Good store, but not found alot yet.  Great cleanliness, and I totally agree about the pleasant employees (and that starts at the top, so I assume the manager here is a peach!).  \nBought a few things, but still seeking that big item for less on my hunt.",UNK
2334,The food is always fresh and the owners are nice people. The kalbi short ribs are a must. The beef and chicken bulgogi are always on point.,UNK
2335,Best food ever.    Love the chicken parm and meatballs to die for. \nEverything authentic and made fresh.  Wow.  Can't wait to come back.  My wide had the caprese salad and the balsamic is fresh and homemade.   You gotta eat here.,UNK
2336,My wife and I went over here with some friends for their karaoke night. They had a great promotion for dollar drinks for girls and we had a blast everybody there was great the bartenders were awesome great selection and drinks and karaoke was off the hook!!! They do karaoke every other week Friday and Saturday nights!,UNK
2337,"Good Beer and Good Pirogies, what else could a connoisseur want? Having this all in an old church makes it that much better. Whenever I'm in da Burgh I make it a point to stop here. \n\nJust go there, you won't be disappointed.",UNK
2338,"service was extremely slow, 40minutes to receive our happy hour order of pretzel sticks{very good}, widow burger{not juicy and luke warm & fries cold}, chicken pot pie{luke warm, salty, and tough chicken meat}. I would not go back even for the happy hour menu.",UNK
2339,"Management was super rude. I addressed a concern and the response was, \""That's how it is...\""\n\nYou're better off going to Pizza Hut.",UNK
2340,"Great prices, nice salsa/condiment bar inside, great daily specials like 99 cent taco Monday and Tuesday, as well as $1.99 burritos those same days. Drive thru consistently slow, go inside if more than 3 cars.",UNK
2341,I ate everything on the menus and the one I love the most is the fat brisket the best I have eaten in phoenix ..,UNK
2342,That Cajun Chicken Biscuit was the saltiest thing I've ever eaten...and I've eaten pure salt.,UNK
2343,"Harper's. Great place. Good food. Knowledgeable staff. Had the Cajun omelet for lunch on Mother's Day Big crowd, but staff did a wonderful job. I will return.",UNK
2344,"Food was acceptable for the price, being cheap in vegas is a plus at times.  would be 3 stars but had to give it 2 with how long we had to wait during our lunch for another drink and then for the check.",UNK
2345,Very disappointed that they would NOT sell their lobster and shrimp Mac and cheese separately at ANY price. Comes only with two selections! Food was good service good.,UNK
2346,Beautiful lighting....But verrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrry overpriced. I don't mind donating at all but geesh!!!,UNK
2347,Update: Called and it turns out that this IS the same company. So they're overpriced AND bullies. Never again.,UNK
2348,"I purchased the honey chipotle chicken and it was very good and well done. My dining experience was decent, the appetizer (chips and dip) took a while to be delivered, but everything else was just fine.",UNK
2349,Far Superior to Pizza Bianca! Great food at a great price and service.  Would recommend this place to anyone who loves real Italian food made with love and care!,UNK
2350,I really enjoy this little bakery! The ladies at the front are always so cheerful and helpful!  They really do care about their customers and I appreciate that. \n\nSupport the local business!,UNK
2351,Absolutely worst car wash. Didn't even attempt to clean.  Barely wiped down inside. Didn't vacuum.  Waste of money.,UNK
2352,"I always only use the ATM here!! \n\nSuper easy and quick! I always forget I have no cash and pop over here from the nearby stores. Its quick, easy, and always open!",UNK
2353,"Beds hard as pavement, but for the price I can't complain. The areas a little rough, so lock doors and look out the window often.",UNK
2354,"Lunch today was, as usual, great!! The Cobbler was great and the lemon tea ice cream was wonderful. This is one of the best eats in Pittsburgh and the old cars are a bonus",UNK
2355,"Came here Friday night and the place was pretty empty. We felt that the menu was rather pricey and ordered the vegetable egg rolls and the chicken salad. Both were just OK. Maybe if we ordered one of the specialty dishes our opinion might have changed. The server was nice and helpful. But honestly, we probably won't be back.",UNK
2356,The food was excellent! Service was friendly. The restaurant itself has a welcoming aura and the music is not overwhelming and rather soothing. The food came out in a timely fashion but we did go in early around opening time. They take open table reservation on the site. Another plus side is they do substitute white rice for brown rice!;-),UNK
2357,We tried this place a couple of times and really like the food.  Drinks are okay and small though.\nRecommendations: Guacamole and Fajitas - we found these to be really good dishes,UNK
2358,"As far as casino coffee shops go, Cafe Vettro is a cut above. The design is quite interesting. The food is decent, though I did think that the bread (in the basket and their buns) needed much improvement. The staff is incredibly friendly. Prices seem about right for a casino restaurant. The view is quite good.",UNK
2359,"Listened to our wishes, submitted a plan, worked with us as we revised the plan both in cost and design, did the work and we have enjoyed the results for two years now.  I have referred this company to my neighbors, friends and acquaintances--I'm that happy with the results.",UNK
2360,"awesome food. some say a little pricey, but with the quality ku noodle puts into their food, it's worth it. ALEX, u r wonderful! thanks for the awesome and attentive service!",UNK
2361,Exploring my new neighborhood and this is the closest liquor store. Immediately I go to the cooler: Angry Orchard? CHECK! It's a done deal. I know where to go for my liquor needs.,UNK
2362,"I wouldn't have thought to come in here if I weren't staying in the hotel, but extremely glad I did. Jackie burger was awesome, cooked to perfection, very juicy and tasty. Exceptional food for the low price.",UNK
2363,Tried a different Chinese Restaurant in the area and wish I did not. Got shrimp with mixed vegetables. The shrimp were small and very overcooked (very mussy). Also got the Teriyaki beef which  was like shoe leather (very tough). Will not be going back.,UNK
2364,"The hotel is beautiful, but just visit do not stay there. They have many high fees. They charge a lot for everything, $30 per day to workout, $20 for an art museum with 15 paintings, $12 minute for calls. The hotel manager feels they should every last dollar out of your wallet.",UNK
2365,My boyfriend suggested going here and I'm glad we did.  The food was really good!  I keep asking to go again but alas we have not.  It's kind of a long drive from where he lives so...,UNK
2366,"I love Postino Winecafe!  Although the central location is closest to me, I do love the atmosphere and outdoor seating that the 40th st/Campbell location offers.\n\nIf you are looking for GREAT wine, AMAZING bruschetta, and a relaxing evening out, Postino is the place!",UNK
2367,"Big sign saying gluten free, but when asked they have no idea what this means. Fryers are shared with flour and corn and so is everything else. They are obviously trying to jump on the GF bandwagon without regard to who gets sick.   Oh well, back to Chipotle!",UNK
2368,"The waitress and/or the kitchen screwed up both our orders on a slow Saturday afternoon. When I said I just wanted to pay my check and go, they were telling me they had a corrected order ready for me. How do you cook a new burger in 5 minutes? Never going back.",UNK
2369,"This concept makes a lot of sense.  A quick pizza at a reasonable price.  Choose a pizza off their menu or create your own.  My creation had sausage, olives and basil and it was delicious if I do say so myself.",UNK
2370,"I had to run an errand during my lunch break that brought me over to this area, so I decided to pop into Subway for a quick sandwich. \n\nMy food was just fine (although the sandwich 'artist' was pretty heavy handed with the mustard) but the cashier could have been a lot friendlier.",UNK
2371,Burgers are on par with 5 Guys. \nExcept thicker patties and not over-cooked (5 guys overcook and their burgers are thin)\nTheir shakes are good if you like vanilla ice cream.,UNK
2372,"Love Zen Life , every person that walks through the door is treated with great respect .every teacher teaches differently but all teachers teach with love, always giving great advice . Always welcoming , Linda and Bob has added love to QC",UNK
2373,"Splurge an extra ten dollars and get Frankie's, Venezia's, or one of the other amazing pizza places in the area. If I could go back in time and un-eat this pizza, I would.",UNK
2374,Great food and they now take cards so those of you waiting because you hate cash. They are now ready. I want a to go menu which they don't have yet.,UNK
2375,We had a bad experience at Legacy. 8 golfers ahead of us decided to play together and the marshall did little to help the situation. We ended up leaving. Tourist trap.,UNK
2376,"Awful pizza. Comparable to Sbarro's. Save yourself the time, money, and calories and go somewhere good.",UNK
2377,Hubs and I ate here alot when we first moved to vegas since it was just down the road from our hotel. We never got tired of it. Food was actually pretty good. Staff are always nice so thats a plus.,UNK
2378,"This place is a good staple, I wouldn't go out of my way to go here, but if you are staying in or near the Hard Rock than after a night of gambling and drinking this place is great. The tacos are tasty and the staff is friendly.",UNK
2379,"Food is awesome . Employees are amazing. But sometimes the seafood isn't always cooked, and the chicken sits out uncovered. Management is disrespectful which makes me think bad of the business. They have had a failed business in the past which speaks volumes.",UNK
2380,"Sorry, not a fan. The best thing I ate this night was at Old Dixie's THE BEST FRIED CHICKEN. $17 for lobster roll and it just wasn't all that.",UNK
2381,"This airport is in serious need of an update. Info kiosks/facility maps are hard to find (I assume they have them but I couldn't find one). Also, there are 2 wings per terminal which is quite confusing. One of the B terminal wings doesn't have a restaurant with a bar.",UNK
2382,"So sad, so sad...  Another Sweet Tomatoes has changed over to a disaster-case \""Field Kitchen\"".\n\nEEK!     :-O",UNK
2383,"Seriously folks, they are closed. Shame they did not post that on their web site before I went to try to use a just pay half deal.  A bartender at a nearby place told me they have been closed for weeks.",UNK
2384,"Traditional homestyle diners with valley girl waitresses like this place are hard to come by these days. The food is great if you're looking for a simple brunch meal, and the service is quaint, and worth the price.",UNK
2385,"Why oh why am I here again?  Oh right.  Getting to the airport three hours early doesn't leave a whole lot of options for a place to sit down and have a drink in this part of the terminal.  Actually, this is it for alcohol, and yeah, the service is still surly.",UNK
2386,"I liked that they gave us complimentary bread and fries.  I liked that they kept filing my glass with water.  And I like that my food came out quickly.  I had my ahi tuna, which came out as a filet. Nice and plump.  However, everything here was just decent for me.  Nothing spectacular.",UNK
2387,"I see Dr.  Batchelor as my regular dentist. He is awesome. He's gentle, competent, and very caring. I have gotten first rate service from everyone I've dealt with at his office. I wouldn't go anywhere else!",UNK
2388,Will NEVER go there again! !!!! They over charge my gift card n they said it was the cards fault! !!! They have stole money from me before!!!! Who ever did my nails did a rush job cause it was crowded n it was a horrible job!,UNK
2389,Awesome coffee and breakfast. They have a great system for reoccurring costumers and the vibe is awesome. Some days you can listen to live music on the patio or just enjoy the awesome vibes and atmosphere.,UNK
2390,"I love Lenny's! The decor is awesome, it's local, burgers and fries are great, and they have really inexpensive ice cream cones and root beer floats. If I'm craving a burger, I head to Lenny's.",UNK
2391,"This place has great sushi and I have been coming here for years. Unfortunately today when choosing what to eat, I realized that every price on the menu has been increased by $2. It's unfortunate that they've priced me out of returning because you can get AYCE anywhere else for less than the price of 2 rolls here.",UNK
2392,I had the works car wash yesterday. They did such a good job it was like a mini detail. The inside of my car was really dirty and needed help. I thought they spent the right amount of time to do a thorough job. I'll definitely return.,UNK
2393,"Our experience was not as we had anticipated.  The food was average, the price was  high.  The entrance (door) to the place was very hard to find, we had to walk around the building a couple of times before we could discover an entry way.  Also, neither the ambience, nor the view were as romantic as we had heard.",UNK
2394,Have ordered delivery there numerous times and they always mess something up these people need to learn how to read orders how you get a calzone confused with a pizza like come now,UNK
2395,I heard great things about these burgers so when I went to a Pens game I gave it a shot. Way overrated & overpriced. I've had better burgers at my house. Don't see the big deal.,UNK
2396,"Quality of the sushi is generally good (Nobu it's not).  However, the Uni I had gave me food poisoning.  It looked old when I was served it and I still stupidly ate it.  Any sushi chef that serves a questionable product should cause everyone to think about eating there.",UNK
2397,Stopped here for lunch with my wife at about 11:30 - food steam trays were cold - asked if there was a problem - was told steam trays were not working right - they would give nothing off the bill even though we ate only a couple of spoonsful. Should have called the health dept. Will not eat here again.,UNK
2398,"Long line, slow service. Coffee was cold - not fresh. Like many other reviewers... I am  from NY, the bagel was just okay. I won't be back.",UNK
2399,"I felt like I was staying in a \""crack house\"".  Would never stay there with my kids.  The mattress was so loud and creaky, I couldn't even get any sleep.",UNK
2400,"Very convenient when staying at the Signature, especially when you do not want to take the journey to any of the eateries the hotel has to offer. Fairly priced for Vegas standards and the overall quality was there. Stopped for a brunch and felt satisfied with the veggie omelet, white chocolate French toast and tuna melt sandwich.",UNK
2401,"The food was all right, nothing too outstanding about it and nothing too bad about it. The service was all right. I find that the price was a bit much. I can understand paying extra if they were including their hot pot in the price, but they don't; they charge extra.",UNK
2402,"pretty standard fro-yo place. the yogurt was a little on the watery side but still good. lots of toppings, lots of different fro-yo flavors, and lots of places to sit. =)",UNK
2403,"We venture here often, as it's walking distance from our house. Fine fish fry and good other offerings. Really kid friendly before 7 (seriously, the dining area is almost like a day care sometimes), adult friendly after. Decent beer selection most of the time. Thumbs up.",UNK
2404,Again a disappointment at Chuck E Cheese. 9 machines down. Management waits till CLOSING to put game out of order notes up!  All these poor kids :(,UNK
2405,"Great customer service with friendly employees.\n\nSometimes things can get backed-up, but remember this seems to be a training location for new local CJs.\n\nThey are very flexible with allowing customers ask for food \""their way\"".",UNK
2406,The Coffee Bean has great coffee! Of course it costs a fortune as it's inside a hotel but the flavor is good and beats Starbucks for sure. They have lots of options and are happy to accomodate any of your crazy requests. The morning and evening staff here is friendly.,UNK
2407,Service sucks.  So slow.  Waitress didn't come by once.  Took ten minutes just to come by. I could see her messing up other people's orders.  I won't ever come back,UNK
2408,This place is fantastic. I came here for me and my wife's  sister's wedding and the service is very good and I would highly recommend this place. I had a very enjoyable experience. The whole process took only about an hour and the they provide everything you need to make your day the most unforgettable day of your life :),UNK
2409,Our shuttle arrived over 45 minutes late. I'm just glad I wasn't the girls next to us who waited almost 2 hours because their bus never showed up.,UNK
2410,"This place sucks, service sucks, music sucks, mixed drink was ok, but not worth a return visit. Why in the hell would you put a country themed bar right across from another one?",UNK
2411,"This place is horrible!!! If you're the only client there they take their time. As soon as someone walks in they start to rush to get to the next client. The last time I was there, the lady was trying to push back my cuticles with an instrument that wasn't a cuticle pusher!! IT HURT",UNK
2412,1st pizza was a salt mine.  The 2ed had no cheese or sauce and needed a steak knife to cut.  Chicken parm was so-so.  Five stars for the staff who tried to make up for the kitchens's shortcomings.  Maybe 2.5 at best.  Also small pours of wine.,UNK
2413,"Just heard this place closed as of 7/31/2014. Why am I not surprised? Such a disappointment.  Guess I won't get the chance to give it another chance. Can we have Blue Burrito back now, please?",UNK
2414,"Tom Ka Gai soup was absolutely fantastic! I could have just ate that and been good! Ordered the curry chicken skewer appetizers. Very tender, I should have gone up a spice level. Ordered medium. Not spicy at all. Great lunch. Great atmosphere. Ate outdoors.",UNK
2415,they were out of ham so no Cuban sandwich....\nbummer.  good customer service however in that the manager adjusted the price of the sandwich I did get,UNK
2416,"I went today and they had some great beer at some great prices. It was happy hour so they had $3 pints. Lots of fun stuff to do like darts, pool, video games. The staff was very friendly and they had an awesome dog.",UNK
2417,"Super nice bartenders! Food menu is good, creative, moderately priced, and my Greek Burger was delish! Draft selection is only modest, but...the view! To hang out anywhere else on a beautiful sunny 'Burgh day would be a waste!",UNK
2418,This location is closed down. It was in between Whole Foods and Jos A. Bank.  After wasting time driving to that location I found the shopping center I was originally at had a Sprint store nearby. My fault for assuming Yelp was accurate. :-(,UNK
2419,"for what it is, it gets a 3 star. the food is satisfying for the price, just stay away from the cheap sushi and some questionable looking items. i was surprised to see some authentic chinese dishes like fish tails in soy sauce and braise pigs feet. the staff were attentive enough.",UNK
2420,I called the restaurant at noon on Labor Day and was told that they would be open till 8 PM. I arranged to have some east valley family members meet there at 4 o'clock for Tortas. WHAT!!! They were closed. No sign. Nothing. Very bad form.,UNK
2421,"Service great and food was super, made my own bowl, price is reasonable, not to busy for just opening, but then again it's HOT outside. Will go back again.",UNK
2422,"I just happened to grab a quick bite here with a girlfriend and honestly, I'm glad we stopped by. The sushi was SUPER fresh, the prices were VERY reasonable and everything was very tasty. I would go back in a heart beat!",UNK
2423,Fresh and good but the actual hot dog on the Chicago dog tastes like one from the grocery store. Meets the craving for Chicago but not completely.,UNK
2424,"The atmosphere here is really good! Fun place and have a lot of drink choices to choose from! The service is lacking though, been here several times and it always takes forever to get drinks or someone to greet the table. The food and drinks are really good though, if you get a good server this place could be really good!",UNK
2425,The best chile relleno(spl?) in Las Vegas! Their red sauce is soooo good.  It's a bit hot but so good.  Their beans and rice are very good too!  They throw in a free soda with any combo meal making it even better.,UNK
2426,"This place is a good spot for happy hour.  Tuesdays are taco Tuesdays, so you can eat for a reasonable price for the entire family.  Service isn't the greatest, but overall, it is a place that we would return to.",UNK
2427,I'm writing this as a warning to anyone who is thinking of staying at Planet Hollywood.. Don't do it! A friend of mine contracted SCABIES after three days of staying there. Good luck.,UNK
2428,I came here around midnight and they were out of pizza. The cashier/chef has never been very nice and always seems very disengaged.,UNK
2429,pho noodle is good but it is on the pricy side. Other Chinese/Asian dishes are fine but they are very pricy. Don't think that we will be back again.,UNK
2430,Very Happy! \nIt's been years since we've been to outback.  They've completely remodeled the place looks great. The servers were on top of there game!  Food was excellent.  All this with a party of 12.. I must say I Was impressed.. Good Job outback crew!!,UNK
2431,The selection of toddler clothes left a little something to be desired. I was able to find something that worked but wished I had better choices.,UNK
2432,Good design for workday lunch - in and out in a few minutes. Food is okay.\n\nNo place to sit inside. Don't take American Express. Menu online is not 100% accurate to what they serve (maybe they rotate dishes).,UNK
2433,"Decent but not great. Pizza wasn't spectacular, but it was different, and the atmosphere was all right. I would consider watching sports there next time over steiners or roadrunner. Lots of TVs, but I would be concerned they only watch detroit.",UNK
2434,"Pretty amazing beer selection. Food is good. Our waitress was a bit rude, missing most of the time, and pretentious.  The food and drinks are overpriced, much better places in the area.  Skip it.",UNK
2435,I've been coming to this Danny's for years and it's absolutely ridiculous how long they take now. No sense of urgency from anyone! I need to find another car wash....,UNK
2436,"this place is deeelicious. my boyfriend and I just went to vegas from LA and we ordered almost everything that was recommended by previous yelpers (thanks for the photos). Our favorites were yellowtail tartar, honey toast, chicken gizzard, beef tongue, and the ramen wasn't too shabby either.",UNK
2437,Kilwins rocks.  The ice cream is excellent and their caramel apples are great too.  I would strongly encourage you to give them a try if you are in downtown Madison looking for a fix to a sweet tooth.,UNK
2438,I consigned furniture here and stopped in a few weeks later to check on it. I was shocked to find that the owner opened a coffee shop on the property and customers were eating and drinking coffee while sitting on my furniture !!!! The owners are totally unethical !!,UNK
2439,"Stick with beer.  Their red wine selection over-priced.  Calamari was amazing!  Ordered the Fried Chicken and Braised Short-Rib to split.  While the short-rib was just okay, chicken was wonderful!  Won't split the chicken next time!",UNK
2440,"Very quick! I love the kiosk at Alamo locations. Great choice of cars here. My luxury rental was a Chrysler 300C with 22k miles and numerous scratches and dings, but drove great. Pickup and return was very easy.  I've had good success with Alamo in different  states and will stick with them.",UNK
2441,"The service was great but the food was just ok.  The freshly baked bran muffin was bitter.  The lorraine quiche was bland but the potatoes was very good.  The freshly squeezed OJ was super bitter, after adding 1 packet of sugar still no go.",UNK
2442,Good burger but they don't do the best on getting orders correct.  There were 3 of us and only one person had their order correct.,UNK
2443,I came in for the first time looking for maintenance as I was at the Giants game and was told midgets worker Vanessa the waitress was so rude to me I left after 60 seconds and will never return again.\n\nDo not go to this place it's a joke I'm so sad I wasted my Driving there,UNK
2444,My first time at a Cirque show but it won't be my last. Excellent show!! Would definitely see it again! Highly recommend,UNK
2445,"Love this family place. The owner is friendly and remembers his customers. Great food, coffee and nice atmosphere. Dog friendly patio. Great alternative to the chain coffee houses.",UNK
2446,Good craft beers. The seasonal brews can be excellent. \n\nNice cozy atmosphere.\n\nI didn't try the food.,UNK
2447,I got the groupon. The food was great. I was way full and satisfied. The dancers were fun. The waiter was rude but I could overlook that because everything else was perfect.,UNK
2448,I grew up in Madison and Sai-Bai Thong was the only Thai restaurant I'd ever been to until college.  Because of that I thought I hated Thai food.  \n\nIt wasn't Thai food's fault.  It was Sai-Bai Thong's fault.,UNK
2449,Had a restaurant.com coupon and they indicated we couldn't use it for to go food. The coupon does NOT read this way. AWFUL service.  Bartender used foul language with guests.  Food OK.  Will never return.  BAD BAD BAD.,UNK
2450,"The grilled artichokes, Guac and  crab cakes are a must. Decent sized glasses of wine and good service.",UNK
2451,"Wait way too long for mediocre food and moderate service to iffy service.  Not to mention LOUD.  I get that it's Vegas in a casino, but c'mon.  Too loud to even talk normally.  Not worth a special trip.",UNK
2452,Sandwiches are good. The chili was not what I was expecting though... Not good. And it takes forever to get your food.,UNK
2453,"Endroit int\u00e9ressant, caf\u00e9 tr\u00e8s bon et dans les prix.  Table dans le milieu, int\u00e9ressant pour les \u00e9tudiants.",UNK
2454,Great food!! Great bar!!!  Friendly wait staff and bartenders. Love the ambiance I recommend you try everything on the menu. I my favorite is the three cheese quesadilla.,UNK
2455,The sushi is always good every time we come here.   I love the seared tuna and albacore! The service is good for the most part.  Gave it 4 stars because the hostess that was working today was kind of rude. Other than that.. I'll definitely be back!,UNK
2456,NICE sports bar!  There were lots of tv's for your viewing pleasure.  I had the Greek salad with chicken and my companion had the southwest salad.  Both were bountiful and the chicken was nice and tender!,UNK
2457,Terrible customer service. I just dealt with Lois and she did not say one word to me. So rude! There are plenty of people out there looking for a job to replace you!,UNK
2458,This is my go to breakfast joint in the area. I give this place 3 stars only because there isn't a wow factor and parking sucks on Saturdays or maybe it's because I am from the south and we have a different standard for breakfast. They have a solid biscuit and gravy. Overall good.,UNK
2459,This place is amazing. Wish it was open more days out of the week. Try the cottage cheese pancakes and the omelets. The cottage cheese is mixed into the batter and topped with boysenberries.,UNK
2460,"Placed order and never delivered. Waited 2.5 hours and Pizza Romano stopped answering the phone? Sometimes, could hear girls talking on other end, unaware that they had answered. \n\nOnly successful because it's in a city; terrible business and quality.",UNK
2461,"Not even going to have a chance to try it.  I can understand having a small menu, but to not even offer ground beef tacos, rules out a lot of people.  No thanks.  You can keep your small menu, and I'll stick with Tacos n More.",UNK
2462,"The only thing redeeming about this place is that it's open 24 hrs. If you are staying at the flamingo and are to hungover to make it across the street to Caesars, then it works. Otherwise don't bother.",UNK
2463,Great place to watch the hockey game.  Plenty of TV's with great staff.  \n\nI recommend the Poutine and any of the burgers.  This is pun food so I would try to get fancy.,UNK
2464,"Decided to tryout local BBQ place based on positive reviews. Got pork dinner, Mac and cheese, and BBQ slaw. Not a very good meal at all. Pork was sticky and slimy. Mac and cheese tasted processed and BBQ slaw had no flavor.",UNK
2465,Love the neighborhood feel and location of this restaurant.  Every dish we ordered was outstanding.  Can't wait to try the Grab and Go options!,UNK
2466,Burgers are pricey and nothing special and the fries have been both hot and cold depending upon the batch. Service isn't great either.,UNK
2467,Love the girls at Wicked Pixie Salon... Janette is so creative and really listens to what you want and makes awesome recommendations. The salon is super cute and well stocked with everything you need to make you the most beautiful when you walk out the door. They are always available when you need them. Love this place!!,UNK
2468,"So good! Simple, fast, good food! They have a huge variety of items in addition to pizza. Salads, chicken fingers, fries, hoagies, stromboli, etc,. \n\nPlus they have online ordering!",UNK
2469,I tried giving this location a chance but their pickup service was always worse than the time before. I wouldn't recommend this location to anyone. The eye rolls I received from the persons manning the pickup counter are deadly.,UNK
2470,AMAZING! Awesome staff. Food was fresh and delicious and fast. I am right up the street from this place and I am happy that I can walk here and get good foods. Mediterranean pita and Greek fries! Do it!,UNK
2471,"Service is good but a very old/bad glass of wine, prices are up and portion was down on the Butterfish dish.  Very disappointed, don't think I will return again.",UNK
2472,"Wow. I am truly blown away right now. In fact I am sitting in the parking lot writing this review. Friendly, fast, very courteous service. Will come again when feeling under the weather.",UNK
2473,"It's Las Vegas, can't expect too much.  They have your most typical dim sum.  Sweet tofu was the best.",UNK
2474,"Had the veggie pan pizza. Bottom of crust was a bit greasy, but that's just how pizza hut bakes the crust.  Otherwise, pretty good.",UNK
2475,"The service here is very mediocre. so is the food. The only good thing about this buffet is the price its a lot cheaper than the buffets on the strip, but you get what you pay for.",UNK
2476,"I knew I didn't want to eat there when my family said they wanted to...\nTook forever to get our meal and 2 of us ordered medium rare.  when they came out the were well ,,, told the Mgr and he didnt to a thing about it,,, Fries were cold",UNK
2477,"Pleasantly surprised...thought this was just another delicatessen, but this place had a really extensive menu offering something for everyone.  I just stopped in for a snack, but would like to go back and eat a full meal.",UNK
2478,I'm not sure what the hype is about this place. I was so excited to try it but everything from the waiter to the food was awful. Waited over 40 minutes for our food and our food was so cold :( not coming back here. I would give zero stars if I could ! What a waste of $40.,UNK
2479,"We didnt feel like going out and decided to order in.  Compared to most delivery restaurants of this style, we were happy not to get a salt bomb for a meal.  Only quibbles were ordering two larges and only getting one rice and their online menu not being accurate with regards to pricing.  Good flavor on the Kung pao.",UNK
2480,I went here while on vacation and had a wonderful experience here! The atmosphere is great and the dining was fantastic! I definitely recommend it!,UNK
2481,Oh Ya!!!! The most incredible bodies on the planet. Performance is impeccable and who knew the best pop-locking I've seen in a long time!! What a great surprise! True Cabaret!,UNK
2482,"Wonderful food choice for an airport.\nTakes a little longer than fast food but in under 10 minutes you are on your way with a delicious meal. I have not heard anyone complain, but i like the fried rice special the most.",UNK
2483,"I expected really terrible downtown lunch food, but it wasn't half bad. I wouldn't go out of my way to return but I would avoid it either.",UNK
2484,"I've had a lot of spectacular meals, but the Filet Mignon topped with Foie Gras topped with black truffles was honestly one of the best things I've ever tasted in my life. Then put that on top of an amazing location at the top of THE Hotel looking over the whole Vegas strip makes it amazing!",UNK
2485,Don't pay for a bar.... that's all it is... one bar with a small circular seating area and that's it... I had more fun chatting it up with the woman in mine than going inside,UNK
2486,"MAC cosmetics department:  Not impressed.  I was making a large purchase and I was completely rushed by the associate \""helping me\"".  It was not busy at all, so I don't see why I was rushed.  Unfortunately, this is the closest MAC to me.  Bummer.",UNK
2487,"Stay away from this rip of place, store manager lady is one of the worst manager I ever met, customer service zero, no common sense, and be aware, prices are high its even better to buy new furniture then used one here.",UNK
2488,"thats it, I am fed up with this fucked up theatre not having any air conditioning when it is 104 degress outside. ...I go to a movie for the cool air conditioning . What gives with the mgmt? ????",UNK
2489,Great appetizers with outstanding flavors.Pricing very reasonable during Happy hour .Staff can be very attentive at times but other times not so much.A.c. wasn't at 100% when we were there recently even the staff was fanning themselves ; (,UNK
2490,"The security guard who works at the front desk is rude, unfriendly and offensive as can be.  He seems to think he owns the place and bosses people around.",UNK
2491,Server asked if cust wanted table or bar customer asked table and he said well there only two of you go to bar.  What the hell???? I can tell service will.suck!!!!!!,UNK
2492,"Never again. \nWaitress needs to leave the bad attitude at the door, pretend that you love your job.  Remember bad service no tip.  Make sure your cook uses fresh bread, I got the moldy one.  One star for you because I am in a good mood.",UNK
2493,"My husband had been buying me jewelry here for a few years.  They went back on their word about a return.  We were there to exchange and buy more, now they have lost our business for good.",UNK
2494,"So glad we a local take us here. Those red velvet pancakes were the business! Also had the Spinach and Mushroom Eggs Benedict--a great damn way to start off Vegas!\n\nGreat service, too!",UNK
2495,The worst company EVER!  Didn't even show up.  Booked on Tuesday for a Saturday cleaning and waited around for hours but NOTHING!  When I tried to call the office the number was disconnected.  So disappointing.  So unprofessional.,UNK
2496,"My fish was excellent once it was cooked after being sent back twice.   I like sushi, but not when it is still transparent in the middle.   Little disappointed with the menu as well.  I guess had I gone only to drink I may have been happier",UNK
2497,"Very friendly, professional service! My father's Rolex band broke and they fixed it like new in about 15 min. Great store! I would definitely recommend this store to others!",UNK
2498,Yaaay!! watch out for the droves of stinky sticky children everywhere!! This place is good for cheap family vacations otherwise stay away. Old run down lots of low scale patrons,UNK
2499,"Stood in tower 1, needs to updated badly. Spent over $100 a night on the room, not worth it. The only good things about hotel is one, the location. It's right on the strip. The 2nd thing is the casino is never dead",UNK
2500,"Yummy!  I just love this place, its been dubbed my \"" first date spot\"" comfortable, relaxed and great atmosphere especially for the east valley. I am a fan!",UNK
2501,Fun for groups. Prices are ok. Been a few times and the crowd its hit or miss.  Drinks average price for the area. Dark and smells like stale beer.,UNK
2502,Leur pain est parfait pour les sandwichs. Mes clients ont adopt\u00e9 le pain berb\u00e8re ! Un d\u00e9lice de pain et toujours frais !,UNK
2503,Okay so I wrote out the long detailed review about my experience here but then I deleted it all.  Words do not do this place justice.  This is by far the coolest store I have ever been in anywhere.  Go see for yourself!,UNK
2504,"Loved the fries! I ordered the kimchi fries and I also had a hot dog. I'm looking foward to trying something new next time. Friendly people and great food, I'll be going back :)",UNK
2505,Best Japanese fried rice I've ever had. Everything I had there is amazing. Very clean and modern inside. Fen fen and eddy are the best.,UNK
2506,"If you don't mind old smelly, out dated room with poor customer service and very limited parking then this is your place....  Bartenders changing prices on the same drinks from 1 min to the next....  Over all price is cheap for the stay but you do get what you pay for here",UNK
2507,"Run away, run far far away.  Not sure about purchasing with them but went in for service and had the worst customer service treatment I've ever received.  My car was returned with several new scratches and the service manager basically confirmed that they didn't believe me and wouldn't do anything to fix the problem.",UNK
2508,"Ate dinner here the other night and got the bone in ribeye and wollensky salad.  The salad was good, but ribeye had way too much fat and little taste.  You are much better off for the same money at delmonicos.  Overall, not impressive, won't be back.",UNK
2509,"Came across after visiting the Castle. The waffle with bacon was amazing!  Friendly service and delicious food. Little pricy, but par for Royal Mile.",UNK
2510,Very good place.  Definitely the best diner food I've ever had.  Very attentive wait staff without feeling like they are trying ot push you out the door.  They have a HUGE HUGE HUGE breakfast menu.  Their biscuits and gravy is incredible,UNK
2511,Love this market.  They have a great selection of healthy foods at affordable prices.  The staff is always friendly and never rude.  Make sure you check out the daily clearance section where you can find great deals. The best market in town.,UNK
2512,"It was all right but it wasn't faaabulous. Be prepared for pretty long waits for the rollercoasters, and skip some of the old school rides which I'd hoped would have a nostalgic charm but instead were really disappointing (especially the laser-gun haunted house ride. Blah.)",UNK
2513,Great place to visit and get acquainted with the Arizona desert.  The trails are easily walkable with enough to see so even the two teenagers I was with didn't get to crisis complain mode (which is a minor victory in itself).  The luminarias are beautiful and it is equally as nice to visit during the day and night.,UNK
2514,"Tr\u00e8s bons burgers et bonne localisation avec une belle terrasse, surtout en ce moment avec le festival de Jazz !",UNK
2515,"Haven't had the wings yet, I will post review for that shortly, however I just place my carry out order and I must say the gentleman on the phone was great! Very polite and perfect customer service! Excited to finally try the wings!",UNK
2516,"My pasta came drenched in Oil, and it was cold, I saw a few reviews mention that also. Soup was pretty good, only reason I gave it a 2 instead of a 1. I just feel for the price you can go down the street to olive garden for better food for 1/2 the cost.",UNK
2517,Not too impressed but again I'm not used to north Carolina BBQ.  Service was great best fried pickles I've ever had,UNK
2518,Love this place.  They have Frank's favorite spaghetti and clams. For all the lounge lizards this is the spot for food and atmosphere.,UNK
2519,"I paid for the exterior AND interior to be washed/wiped and my seats were dusty, radio was still dusty, and my rims still had dirt all inside them. NEVER AGAIN WILL I GO HERE - THEY SUCK.",UNK
2520,"Life changing. Had a wonderful dinner a few weeks ago with the phenomenal bison, piglet & foie risotto and Youppi. That was a test for a 30 person wedding rehearsal dinner that was a 7 course thing of beauty in the bar area. My favorite restaurant of all time. I will travel back to go again.",UNK
2521,I Went in to look at a few pistols and the staff was excellent. Had great knowledge of their inventory and was very pleasant to talk to. I did buy a pistol from them and am very happy. I will go back for my next firearm and highly recommend this gun store for anyone.,UNK
2522,"Quick and easy take out with friendly service. The food is the same as other Applebee's, this location was just more convenient than driving further downtown.",UNK
2523,"You know that scene in Steel Magnolias, when Shelby gets her hair cut, and then bursts into tears when she sees it? That's how I felt after I got my hair cut here.",UNK
2524,WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!! I have never felt so mistreated in all of my life.  I will never return to Lowes AGAIN!,UNK
2525,"Not your father's mini golf. Very edgey, very cool and choc full of Kiss memorabilia. Visually over the top, just like a Kiss concert and loud rock  playing over the sound system, this place has much more to experience than just putting. Admission price is fair too.",UNK
2526,"LOVE Dr. Shelly!!! I highly recommend her, especially if you are expecting! I started going to ABLE after two different chiropractors dislocated one of my ribs during my third trimester. Dr. Shelly fixed me right up and now I couldn't imagine seeing anyone else!",UNK
2527,"We stayed on the 4th floor, the same floor as the pool, spa and the Rio Beach Club. There is a corridor to the Palazzo and all the great restaurants. Best of all, no kids running around, all the guests on our floor were adults.",UNK
2528,I've been taking my doxies here since both were very young. Aside from being a little expensive this is a good place. Then again who wouldn't pay more to make sure a beloved family member got the care they needed.,UNK
2529,"This was my 3rd time here. I was pretty disappointed with the food this time. Maybe it was due to off-season, but thats not a reason to make bad food. Chicken biryani tasted like Pulao. Rice were un-cooked and appetizers are not that great as well.",UNK
2530,I am giving the 2 stars because the food is ok to either Take Out or have delivered.\nBut do not go there to eat in.\nService is very slow and poor.\nI was there in the summertime and the AC was not working. We had to eventually give up and eat in the car.,UNK
2531,"About every 3-4 weeks I get a burrito here. I have no complaints at all. The food is good quality, and the price is just right for the big burrito with fresh queso and chips! Definitely recommend this place.",UNK
2532,"Small but cozy location, had a chicken wrap and onion rings along with a chocolate shake. All the employees were super nice, place was clean and even the manager came out during our meal and asked if we needed anything and checked on the food taste and quality. That kind of service means a repeat customer!",UNK
2533,Letting a boring girl like Lindsay have her own show it just prrof that no one listens to this station. It has to be years since I stuck with this boring channel. I wish they would sell theimselves like 103.9. Even 80's music is better than being bored to death.,UNK
2534,Amazing beer and wine selection. 16 on draft and a lot more in 12 oz and bomber bottles. With a chill patio and nice staff. Worth hanging out at for a couple of drinks and a bite to eat with friends,UNK
2535,"Our first time to the Outback for a family dinner, and it was great.  The food was excellent and the service outstanding.  Best baby-back ribs I have ever had!  Everyone was extremely pleased with the meal.  Best of the year for us!",UNK
2536,It seems like whenever I go in to this store what should only take 5 minutes to do ends up taking 20. It doesn't help that this company has the worst customer service year after year.,UNK
2537,"Best burger i had in months.try the thai , apple cider and barbeque sauces next time you go there!",UNK
2538,"Love this place.  The food is amazing, ambience is really nice, and the manager (Luke) is fantastic.  My friends and I come here often and we love it.",UNK
2539,I ordered a 17 dollar burger and asked for bacon.  When I'm paying 17 bucks I expect the order to be correct.  There was no bacon!  Where's the bacon?  Not on my burger.   Get it together people.,UNK
2540,Might be good for the over 40 crowd but was a little lame for me. Tried the sriracha wings & they were pretty tasty but other then that this place just isn't worth another visit,UNK
2541,"Pastry Review only:\n\nInside the Planet hollywood hotel- Decent. Had croissants, apple danish, muffin. Sandwiches and cakes looked ok. Didn't try their gelato, but compared to my favorite dessert shops in vegas, A-ok.",UNK
2542,"Great food, not super heavy like most Italian foods,. There are plenty of healthy options as well as traditional items. Service was great, and they have a great happy hour with 1/2 price apps and low priced drinks. San Tan beers available too.",UNK
2543,Really good stuff. Authentic. Wide variety of food on offer. The staff is small so sometimes they can get really busy and you see the staff working really hard right there. The restaurant makes the knefah dessert right there so it's fresh (and good) - very few restaurants make their own.,UNK
2544,"Let me start with the service, it was great. My wife's steak was also wonderful, my steak was at best horrible, it had a bone in it and was 50% gristle. I visit Sullivan's quite a bit and understand that both are owned by the same company, however I will not return to this Del Frisco's",UNK
2545,Cool spot to come and chill. We came right before they closed and they still let us come in and smoke a bowl. Go in and see Sabrina! She's the best!!,UNK
2546,"Not really crowded (except for grand opening  had a 1hr wait)\n\nHas Keurig pods with the same price as everywhere else but with less line, hassle, & can take & go\n\nGreat sales on copy paper or other things in circular / ad flyer",UNK
2547,"Not bad. Typical beer and wings sports bar. Good for a large group and kids.  They do support the community sports, so for that I would go back.",UNK
2548,"A very comfortable, simple place to crash for a night.  You access the rooms from the building interior, so it's more secure.  The mattresses and pillows are fairly hard, so they seem pretty up to date.  Not right near campus, but you can get there in about 15 minutes.  Best bang for the buck.",UNK
2549,5 stars for unlimited $10 mimosas on Sundays with fresh orange juice. 5 stars for great service. \n\nOne star for the food. Great place to sit for a few drinks with friends. But don't plan to eat here. Too many other good choices in this complex.,UNK
2550,"Our in-laws suggested Dr. Battle and company when our dog, Levi, suddenly got ill.  The staff was very kind and caring even when the diagnosis was not positive.  They gave us as much time as we needed to stay with Levi and were sympathetic.",UNK
2551,"Had breakfast there.  The menu wasn't impressive.  The coffee was awful.  Service was prompt but lacking any warmth.  Had a skillet.  The food was unremarkable but not bad.  I wouldn't say not to go here to eat, just go with modest expectations.",UNK
2552,Love this place's food!!! Not my favorite place but good when I don't feel like driving too far for good Chinese food!! Best of all; they deliver!!!,UNK
2553,Service is always solid. Above and beyond. Food has occasionally been a bit salty... Love the fresh squeezed juice from bar for cocktails.,UNK
2554,Went on Tuesday and found out they are closed Tuesdays and Wednesdays. Would it have killed the Hard Rock to update the website? Would it have killed J. Smalls to post their new hours of operation at the door? I had to ask a security guard he knew the deal.  I will try on Thursday,UNK
2555,"Pretty good haircut. More of a salon vs barber shop. They only shave the back of your neck and not trim anything past there. \nV's gives you the whole hot towel wrap, straight razor your neck, beard and behind your ears.",UNK
2556,"This place is very professional. My wife needed an oil change and they came running right out to great her.  She was helped by a guy named Chris. He was great, got it done quickly.  We've since returned and got a good deal on new brakes as well as a replacement coolant hose.",UNK
2557,"It's lovely, comfortable and, like sushi in the Biltmore has always been, ever so slow. Our waitress was so obviously not interested in the tasks at hand that our mood was eventually affected by it too.",UNK
2558,"Great experience! \nInexpensive, good quality good, friendly staff, and quick. Great for a work meal!\nI enjoyed this meal greatly!",UNK
2559,"What a disappointment, Service was horrendous I took 45 minutes to get drinks to the table.  Steaks were poorly prepared and my NY was tough. Sides how ever were very tasty.  \n\nDo Not Go Here unless you only want potatoes.",UNK
2560,As previously stated. We're never there when they said they would be. Never returned phone calls. Went days without showing up. Will not use them again.,UNK
2561,Treating the customer horribly.  No phone manner at all. Said only deal with companies. I AM A BUILDER!!!,UNK
2562,"Gourmet House of Hong Kong has rolled out a Thai menu. I'm not sure what this means yet, but I'm going to find out.",UNK
2563,this pho place is probably the prettiest I've seen and super clean =] and the food is great! i love the bun bo hue and vietnamese coffee!,UNK
2564,"Really good Thai food.  Very friendly service and management.  Food is prepared promptly and is consistently good.  I wish that they DELIVERED!!  We eat their food often.  The decor leaves a lot to be desired, though.",UNK
2565,"I may have come at a bad time but the food and drinks were bad.  I've had a good experience before but this time was really bad, but I will still give them 3 stars because I know this is not the standard.",UNK
2566,"Ok.  I had lunch at the Scottsdale quarter location on my birthday and I guess I was just underwhelmed.  Service was so-so, food wasn't special and they forgot to bring out the cake my mom called ahead for.  The outside patio is beautiful though especially by the bathrooms",UNK
2567,"Terrible service, a waiter who didn't care and the wrong eggs. Didn't remove the disgusting scrambled eggs off my plate...just brought the new ones and I had to transfer everything else off the plate... Now cold by the way.",UNK
2568,Super helpful on the phone. Gave us directions and looked for the top we were looking for to make sure it was in stock. Even with the big mall scene we were in and out in no time! Thanks ladies!,UNK
2569,"The berry mojito is perfect, the fig and pig flatbread is epic, and it's a short hop over to the movie theater. I mean, it's no Dave and Buster's (it doesn't smell like teenage feet at ALL) but it'll do in a pinch.",UNK
2570,Driving by and tried it for lunch.  The staff tried hard to accommodate me because I was in a hurry and illegally parked outside.  Pizza was pretty good and service excellent.,UNK
2571,"Save your money.  I grew up with Michael Jackson's music and this show was awful! It was so boring and kiddish we walked out after 20 min's!  And, the seats where not high enough to look over the person in front of you.",UNK
2572,"Disappointing. First visit, the place was extremely busy so I overlooked the quality of the food. Second visit was fairly slow, but the quality was equally as poor. Ahi was overcooked, burger overcooked, fries too salty, onion rings too greasy.",UNK
2573,"Awesome bar and grill! The beer app, while not always working, is a great touch. Everything I have ordered has always been excellent especially the unique hot dog dishes and the quesadilla.",UNK
2574,The customer service here  is terrible. Employees make false accusations and their membership is a rip off. You don't save money here if you know how to shop savvy! What a load of crap!,UNK
2575,"I am a HUGE fan of QT. I wish they had them were I live (in the Seattle area). They have friendly employees, lots and lots and lots of choices in regard to food and drink, and clean bathrooms. Love this place!",UNK
2576,We went on a special event day when they were roasting a hog on the patio so the food we had wasn't part of their regular menu. The crab bisque was amazing and the roasted special was cooked to perfection. We will go back.,UNK
2577,Since buying a home in the North Valley we have come to Claim Jumpers on several occasions;  the service has mixed but the food has been worth the trip.   The managers have always addressed the service issues;  (wrong item or not cooked right).  The deserts are very good.,UNK
2578,I love their pizza and the spicy marinara is delicious. The calzones were delicious as well and I am very sad to learn about this location closing,UNK
2579,"Hotel: stayed in a small room as we were trying to save money and it wasn't bad at all. Bed was so-so but room was clean and cozy. Casino: best roulette in LV, slots are usually pretty generous. Drinks are fairly stiff. Staff is friendly.",UNK
2580,"-Wannabe In-n-Out- My burger was dry, and not very tasty. I can't figure out why this place was so packed. The next time I feel like dropping 8 bones on a burger, I will go to Delux. MMmmmm..Delux.",UNK
2581,If I didn't have to make a star on here I wouldn't! Worst place ever! He spent most of his time talking about remodeling his office with some guy instead of getting people in! \nI was there for 30 minutes and decided to leave. \n\nI would never recommend anyone to come here.,UNK
2582,"Had a reservation yet had to wait 30 min for our table, then once sat 45 min for drinks, food came out before drinks. Small plates but the menu did not state that was expecting full portion.",UNK
2583,"Mario Batali...is a master.\n\nHad Linguine with shrimp, it was awesome.  Had fried green beans, they were awesome.  Had the roasted cauliflower, it was awesome.\n\nThis is worth paying a little extra.",UNK
2584,Little disappointed. Saw Rachael Ray (apparently older episode) raving about the place. For the cost of a slice of cake was expecting a little more. Unfortunately it was just okay. The staff was friendly and helpful and the place was bright and clean.,UNK
2585,I tried them again.  Hash towns were better but I specifically asked for fresh.  Unfortunately there was a long hair that came out of my mouth after the second bite.  Just prior yo that my links were cold.  I'm done.,UNK
2586,"Went here for lunch and had the chicken salad sandwich, it was fantastic. I will never have another chicken salad sandwich anywhere else as I'll only be disappointed. Great atmosphere as well.",UNK
2587,Absolutely horrible. The food is frozen and warmed to order and there just isn't anything that tastes fresh. Avoid at all costs.,UNK
2588,Flancer's is awesome. Their bread is fresh baked daily. The Philly cheese steak and We must meat I ain't lion are amazing! I have heard great things about the prickly pear chicken sandwich too. The only drawback is the the place is a little small.,UNK
2589,excellent food and the waiter was outstanding.\nwas my wife's birthday July 4th and he had a great dessert with a sparkler candle in it\n\nrecommend to anyone,UNK
2590,What???! They have items that are not for sale..... The clothing on the mannequins are not for sale..... This place is so gross.,UNK
2591,One of the worst buffets I've been to in Vegas. Would not have eaten here if the hotel hadn't comped us. Do yourself a favor and go to Wicked Spoon at the \nCosmo or Studio B at the M instead.,UNK
2592,Only need 1 form of ID for cashing non-member checks. Greeting was weak but overall friendly service for non-members.,UNK
2593,"The type of shoe store that you've seen 100 of before, and will likely see 100 of again before long, Sole sells middle to upper prices shoes, to people of the middle or upper range of trendiness and earnings.\n\nI'm actually boring myself writing this...",UNK
2594,"No frills sign outside to let you know you've reached the place you've been looking for. Large warehouse full of pinball machines and arcade games from the past.  Not fancy but, something to do. Good decent priced fun for kids :) as well as adults!",UNK

2596,"Had our friend's 50th Birthday party at Hofbrauhaus and it was great.  Service was really good and the food was delicious!  I've been to the original Hofbrauhaus  in Germany without the TV's, which we enjoyed.",UNK
2597,"A place that needs no introduction. 24 hours service, hot good food and cheap prices. Cant ask for much more. Once they added a few tapatio bottles around the restaurant it became perfect.\nWhat they lack in high quality they more than make up in quantity and price. I would recommend this place to anyone at anytime.",UNK
2598,"Been back 2 more times and we really like the food!  Very tasty, full of flavor and tender meats!  Pat (owner) really nice guy who really does care about the food he is serving!\n\nCome try the brisket, very tender!",UNK
2599,Our server Ben was awesome and personable. The food was a little too salty but the great service and conversation Ben provided made up for that!,UNK
2600,Very nice intimate music club! The open mic is a well attended event and it was actually the best I have ever attended or played. \nI would imagine I would not want to see a band larger than 3 people there as the  previous reviewer mentioned.,UNK
2601,"Just had lunch there.\nTeriyaki Chicken with Spicy sauce, oh yea.\nA lil $$, but everything is going up now-a-days except my paycheck...",UNK
2602,"Overpriced and nothing to write home about. The place was amazing when it opened (in the 80s or 90s) but like many places that have become staples they no longer try. And there's nothing worse than cynical, overpriced food.",UNK
2603,Definitely do not miss this on a trip to Vegas!! This is one of the most amazing things we were lucky enough to get to see on our short trip! And its free!!,UNK
2604,great vibe in general throughout the restaurant. only problem is the food. fries were soggy. onion rings were terrible. probably could've gone to a different sports bar on mill with better food.,UNK
2605,One of our favorite places to order lunch from for pick up.  We will go out of our way to get their sandwiches and salads.  The food is consistently tasty and the employees are always very nice.  We haven't tried anything on the menu yet that we didn't like!,UNK
2606,"I stayed here for 3 nights. One morning at around 5:20, we were rudely awaken to a fire alarm. The good thing about it is that they gave us a free night stay because of it. They did not have free internet access, and their Seasons Buffet Restaurant's food was quite cold.",UNK
2607,I've seen quite a lot of cirque shows now and this one was just amazing. The music alone was incredible. Performers were very talented. This is a must do when in Vegas!!,UNK
2608,Had my hair cut by Rachael!  She is an amazing hair desinger.  Wonderful experience everytime I go to this salon.   I will be back.,UNK
2609,"Late night spot. The different variety of fries are really worth trying. Everything else on the menu is good, not great. Avg pricing",UNK
2610,"I just am in love with this store! Associates are awesome and their sportswear is the best there is out there!\nI always love to pick thru their great markdowns, because it Is somewhat pricey.although you do get what you pay for....and quality lasts!",UNK
2611,Awful food and service. We won't be returning. Not to mention over priced. You have to pay an extra dollar if you. Want fries with a sandwich and a 1.29 if you want mushrooms and another 1.29 if you want peppers on a Philly cheesesteak!,UNK
2612,"Greeted with a warm welcome, sat very quickly! This place is a well oiled machine. Great pancakes, and the eggs were cooked perfectly.. The sour dough toast was sooo good. Really nice staff too!",UNK
2613,"Amazingly delicious Irish food! The wait staff is incredibly helpful in making decisions. My partner loved the cottage pie and I had the fish and chips. Everything was very flavorful (more than other \""Irish\"" bars for sure). Totally recommend this place.",UNK
2614,"Always slow. The cream is always empty. Believe it or not, they have run out of Pike more than a few times! How does a coffee place run out of coffee? I drive an extra 3 miles to avoid this place.",UNK
2615,"We've gone in a few times either for dinner or lunch, we always seem to miss half price happy hour though... maybe next time........ I like the crab cakes and calamari, we had great service, Im sure we'll be back for more.........",UNK
2616,Terrible. I will never go again. Ever!! Lunch special is cheap because the every shrimp dish has only 3 pieces of shrimp. They are skimping and food is overly greasy and way too salty. Plus the people are rude.,UNK
2617,We love this place!! Amazing food. Great coffee. Reasonable prices. What more can you ask for we will never go to ihop again.,UNK
2618,"Their food is okay, maybe its cause i expected too much from what my friends had said. SHOYU RAMEN was bomb , but when i got their tom yum soup, EEK! not the best .. not too good either. best desert was the honey toast but i still like Ichiza's honey toast better.",UNK
2619,My fav eating spot in Charlotte..Have tried most of their items in the menu..you can't go wrong with anything...let it be the appetizers or their entrees along with yellow rice pilaf and garlic dips..they are the best you can get!!!!!,UNK
2620,"5-STAR Brunch!! We've taken all our out of town guests here, and they've loved it. Worth the $30pp.\n\nCame here for happy hour bar bites, which was okay. \n\nNever been here for dinner.",UNK
2621,"10-508 suit. The MOST uncomfortable bathroom/WC that I've ever seen!! The \""view\"" is disappointing too. Don't take it.",UNK
2622,"I really like this place, I eat there 3 times a week. The food is much better than Lemongrass, the broth for Pho is better too. Only complaint I have is the servers don't fill your water often enough, you have to ask sometimes.",UNK
2623,"Had to file a BBB complaint, but they are giving me a full refund on my application.  Kudos to Travis at cityscape residences.\n\nI ended up at 44 Monroe for a bit cheaper and seemingly just as nice.",UNK
2624,"I love the products!  Especially the buffy scrub, the facial masks and bath bombs.  I have to admit I almost dread walking in there sometimes because the employees can be a bit overzealous and annoying.  But I'll suck it up to get my fix.",UNK
2625,"Arizona Air Services did an excellent job of cleaning the air ducts and dryer vent in my home.  They are experts and their process conforms to NADCA specs.  They were very thorough, pleasant and customer focused.  They will continue to be my first choice for service!",UNK
2626,"We loved this place so much,  we came back three times on vacation.  Love the indoor and outdoor bar.  We enjoyed chatting with different staff each time and also the outdoor fireplace (sorta object).  Also,  drinks are average in price,  but 2 out of 3 times we had the special cocktail of the day and it was delightful and reasonable.",UNK
2627,Best momos and momochas I have ever had................this place is a bit of an institution on State Street. \n\nWorth the visit.,UNK
2628,Waited an hour and was disappointed by the food.. I had banana pancakes and a breakfast skillet.  The pancakes were chewy.  The skillet had no flavor.,UNK
2629,"Super overrated...  Yes, the pastrami's good, but not THAT good.  It's also not worth $15 a pop.  Yeah, I know it's Vegas, but please... not that good...",UNK
2630,You get what you pay for... My experience was okay. The place does look a little creepy but the lady inside was nice. My dog looked pretty good when I picked him up and seemed fine. The prices are very good so I will probably try this place again.,UNK
2631,This place is incredible! Service is great and the food you'll crave all week! Especially the spinich enchiladas! We are there at least twice a week if not more,UNK
2632,"This place and service are pretty decent , but the food is kind of expensive for small portion. The food is typical Chinese food average tasty , not super surprising , so the price is kind of higher.",UNK
2633,"gotta say , the food was good and it came out really fast for not being a fine dining restaurant neither a fast food chain it has the best of both , congrats to Stephano for being the best it can be in your weight division .",UNK
2634,Nice mom and pop restaurant with friendly service. The frybread with grilled chicken mojito was delicious -- the topics did not take away from the flavor or texture of the frybread.\n\nIt was a nice find.,UNK
2635,I just moved to Ballantyne and was looking for a new nail salon.  The salon is modern and comfortable.  They gave me a great gel mani and pedi!  I'll be back for sure.,UNK
2636,Great prices for the amount of food that you get area is a little sketchy but besides that its a great after hours spot to grab a burrito.,UNK
2637,"Overpriced for okay food.  I don't get it.  Slow service--not the food, but placing your order takes forever.  Also, don't be fooled by the two sizes--you'll want the bigger one for a normal meal.",UNK
2638,"a little pricey for a sandwich shop, very loud and non-atmospheric, I don't see the appeal of waiting to cram myself in a small box for overpriced sandwiches...and some very odd ones at that.  I love unique, but this is too unique for me.",UNK
2639,"Very pricey, but very good.  I suggest having a welcoming stomach, your hangover may prevent you from enjoying it to the extent that it costs.",UNK
2640,Everything you could want from a small Mexican restaurant. No frills and amazing food prepared quickly and for a good price. Love it!,UNK
2641,"Poor Customer Service..Poor alteration service..,.bad experience...stay away from  Men's Warehouse #3217 at 9310 CENTER LAKE DR, CHARLOTTE, NC",UNK
2642,The hummus is very tasty and the fruit and cheese platter is huge! We asked for cucumber slices and tomato for our hummus and we were brought 3 slices of cucumber and maybe 4 tomato wedges. I would have preferred more. The overall service is not very attentive but they are very nice.,UNK
2643,"I really like it here! They've got just about every store you want to shop in, including that Forever 21 that is 2 stories and gives you a panic attack when you walk in, because of that lol.",UNK
2644,"I love the indoor track, but the gym is always packed and it's hard to find parking. Also, the staff Isn't very friendly or willing to help.",UNK
2645,"A bit pricey but other than that very high quality. Let us off the hook with a bit of leftovers. Also caught one of the sushi chefs handling cash with his gloves which I thought he would take off before handling sushi again but I was wrong, he kept the gloves on.",UNK
2646,"Tasty selection of mac and cheese.  Got the smokehouse mac and the pepper jack mac...the smokehouse was definitely smokey and slightly sweet.  I think I actually liked the pepper jack mac slightly better, just for the savoriness.  All in all, short menu and quality food for what they do have.",UNK
2647,The past office itself is okay but some of the employees there are morons. I hate having to interact with them.  Why after 6 years would you ask a regular customer whom you know by name for id and make you sign back of your cc? It makes no sense and is irritating.,UNK
2648,They need to train the cooks!  Nothing is cooked.  Pizza is chewy and The dough is not cooked enough. We tried a calzone tonight same thing rubbery dough just terrible!,UNK
2649,This place is good.  \nMy absolute fave: the stuffed calamari salad!!  I love vermicelli noodle bowls however I don't recommend that dish here because most of the meat was pure fat.,UNK
2650,Great nail salon in downtown. I stopped in for a pedicure with no appointment and they were able to take me right away. Overall the staff was friendly and knowledgable.,UNK
2651,"Yes .. just tried this place . The corn nuggets are great. the cheese steak with the works , better than I have had ellsewhere \ngood crispy sweet potato fries ,, just wish the order was a but larger\n\ntry it ,, I think you will like it",UNK
2652,Thai Mix (red curry) I dont know what this is but it's not Thai.  Bland and not even similar to Thai red curry.  If you want Thai food hit Royal Thai Grill or Thai Rama.  I would have been better off going to Panda Express which makes me cry a little on the inside.,UNK
2653,"Stopped in for a quick dinner. Had the Sushi Combo 2 for $18, with a spicy tuna roll.\nFelt it was just alright, nothing terrible but I wouldn't want to order it again. service was great though.",UNK
2654,"Agreeing with the other review,  I do not get how this place is still in business or why people keep going.  I have been a few times, usually dragged there by friends.  The services is poor, the food is inconsistent, i have managed to have a passable meal there once, but I am usually disappointed.",UNK
2655,Spent $140 on a mediocre meal.  My steak was not done right and was very tough on the outside.  Service was so-so.  I've had better steaks at Texas Roadhouse.,UNK
2656,Worse service ever... Waited over an hour n half for pizza.. Manager argued and was unconcerned with my order. Only thing missing from being the worst services possible is spit in my food and not putting that past them.,UNK
2657,Earl's please come to Nor Cal. Your chipotle chicken makes me want to mission all the way back to Vegas so that I can just have the littlest taste of its awesomeness. Love that there wasn't a line at 4 in the morning. Until we meet again Earl of all sandwiches!,UNK
2658,"My husband and I have eaten Chinese food all over Phoenix, and hands down, Big Wa has been the best.  The BBQ pork with fresh spicy mustard is A-Mazing!!  We have ordered about 6 different dishes from here, sometimes totally blind and the food is always great!",UNK

2660,"gotta say that this place failed on the majority. service was slow and rude. the hummus was almost all tahini, no lemon juice, and no seasoning. lentil soup was like chef boyardie chili gone bad.\n\ni dont recommend this place at all. lots of choices in the area.",UNK
2661,"Excellent ciabatta, great Italian takeout sandwiches.  Excellent fresh and frozen pastas and sauces - brilliant cannelloni!  Catering or takeout.",UNK
2662,I quite like the place....their entrance is through a quaint-looking garden which sets a romantic mood. The ambiance inside is pretty nice. The food is good. Try the stuffed mushrooms. They can be pretty busy at times so I would call ahead.,UNK
2663,I like the burgers and the options on the soda machine. It is worth the little more you pay over a comparable burger somewhere else.,UNK
2664,"Blah, worst coffee ever. Had this place 2 weeks ago and I will never come back. Their drip coffee tasted watered down, overpriced and it was by far the shittiest coffee I have ever had. I would much rather get my coffee from AM/PM then ever walk into this place again. Horrible.",UNK
2665,The best cheese steak and pastrami sandwich in Vegas. this is a place for take out. They have a sitting area but its small and not to comfortable. But the sandwiches are great!!!,UNK

2667,"The food is great !! Service sucks, they sit you down, get your drinks and then forget about you. Tip order take out...food is ready when they say it is.",UNK
2668,I read all the positive reviews and I went to this place.... they did not make me feel welcome ....no customer service skills....I don't feel like going back there again. ...totally displeased with the techs approach.,UNK
2669,"I'll keep it short.  A waste of money, mainly because it's extremely overpriced.  It's a decent show, but dissapointing compared to Le Reve or Ka.  Over rated too.  The two clowns were hilarious, but I found nothing special in the show except the costumes.",UNK
2670,"General manager, Adam Stanchina, broke contract with Econcerts Live, canceling the Arizona 420 Festival. A presenter, I flew in from Denver to discover what this jerk had done. Thousands of festival-goers were left without an event. Let him know how you feel about this: 602-331-9325.",UNK
2671,Had the filet with foire gras......i still think about it today. \n\nIt's a good place for large parties and smaller romantic dates so long as you're not pinned next to them. \n\nA fan!,UNK
2672,I booked on Priceline for $39/ night and am very impressed.  The room is clean and as nice as any other room I've stayed at on the strip.  The beds are comfy and I have a great view.  Kristi at the activities desk is amazing and went above and beyond to make sure I had a great stay.,UNK
2673,.Horrible service. It was  if they were doing us a favor\nDon't  they understand we are paying their salary.,UNK
2674,"I second the opinion of best Starbucks in town.  Drinks are always great, service is fantastic (Sharon is the best) and they always remember people's drinks.  Gets busy between 8:30 and 9:30 am because it's right next to the Howard Hughes offices but they always handle it well.  Love this place.",UNK
2675,Not worth it unless you don't know mexican food. Everything taste fresh out of a can. Too pricey for the lack of quality. Maybe because you're paying for the decor.,UNK
2676,"I really should give this place a zero.  Im going to give it one star only due to the fact that if you walk out of the bar and you're hungry this place is available.  Other than that I have tried this pizza sober and it is disgusting.  Never go here, it's bad.",UNK
2677,"I used to frequent this location several times a week for lunch, but I will never go back here again. The service is beyond bad and the when I spoke to the manager he walked away from me while I was talking. My recommendation is spend your money anywhere else.",UNK
2678,"I love this salon!! It is my favorite salon I have been to in the country. They are professional and clean, and the prices are fair. Lexi does amazing nail art! \n\nTip: you have to book your appointments in advance.\n\nHighly recommend.",UNK
2679,"I LOVE chipotle but when comparing this locations to others, I get about half as my food in my burrito bowl. Seriously, at home I get enough for an entire second meal after I'm full. It would be great if the employees would just add a little more to the burrito bowls.",UNK
2680,"Excellent people to do business with. We were referred to them from another Boulder City business and they did everything they said they would!  We needed work on a boat trailer and they were very helpful and knew what they were talking about, which can be rare these days. Would have no problem going back to them.",UNK
2681,"I have been to Jim and Nick's a couple of times. Always great service. The food is good and resonably priced. I have tried their turkey, chicken and their ribs. All were great tasting. I would recommend it if you wanted Bar-B-Que. Great flavor, Great Venue, Great atmosphere.",UNK

2684,"I recommend eating here. They even offer brown rice as a substitution to the white rice! Service is friendly here, and the foods great too. I came with my GF and we order a chicken/beef plate, and a need rib plate. They even cook in the front of house so you know it's fresh! Will be coming back",UNK
2685,"Would be fun if the staff weren't so over bearing.  Took a fun activity and made it lame.  Entire business model is around selling you pictures, so be ready to pay out or be kicked out.",UNK
2686,"The Pizza was very decent, my grilfriend really enjoyed her Red Snapper.\nWas impressed at the amount of dinners that they could turn out. So all in all very decent dinner, with a great location, not your run of the mill tourist restaurant in the Old Port.",UNK
2687,"Slow service, weak food, im not sure the beers we ordered had any alcohol in them they tasted watered down.  The place looks promising but I was dissapointed.",UNK
2688,This joint looked like it was good but unless you wanna wait 45 minutes to get a seat and 30 more for your food by all means this is your kinda place it's smelled like burn grease in there when I left I smelled like I've been working over a hot stove for 12 hours straight but that's just my opinion,UNK
2689,Must be the only coffee place that never has coffee\n3 visits in 2 weeks and never have coffee\nUnless u drink decaf or vanilla,UNK
2690,"Alright but not great. DO NOT GET THE \""whose your daddy\"" ROLL!  It tasted like ammonia. It was the worst sushi I have vet had. Try happy endings or something else.",UNK
2691,The fountain show at night is a must see!! It comes on once every fifteen minutes and it's quite a sight! \nWe sat across the street at mon ami gabi and had an amazing view!,UNK
2692,"Service is OK.  Food is quite tasty, though a touch on the oily side.  We went on a Saturday for dinner and were happy to go back for Sunday lunch.  I plan on going back.",UNK
2693,Came in and decided that this is going to be my hangout at least once a week. Tricky to find but the guy is so charming.the food is yummy.the atmosphere is comfy and it wasn't busy. AND he gave me a free muffin! Made my day :],UNK
2694,Im a regular here. Good food. Although the boom box blaring on the counter might explain the errors of omitted ingredients of my orders lately.,UNK
2695,Amazing! Great atmosphere different from a typical night out \nin Vegas.Staff is friendly and can carry on a conversation. Cocktails are smart and food is even smarter! Love the watermelon and the fris\u00e9e salad. Squash Couscous was excellent. Definitely coming back!,UNK
2696,Poor service. Waited too long for waitress ( Kim) to take our order.  not happy. Will very likely eat somewhere else next time.,UNK
2697,The service was prompt and the food was tasty. It was my first time ever eating Indian food so I can't say I knew what to expect. I will certainly eat here again if the opportunity presents itself. \n\nI went in July 2013. Amex was not accepted at that time. Perhaps things have changed?,UNK
2698,Was looking forward to an awesome vietnamese sandwich.  They claimed the bread was made every 45 mins but mine was definitely hard and old.  Still... The sandwich itself was good and the spices were sharper than Lees Sandwiches which made up in part for the stale bread.\nService could also be better.,UNK
2699,"Good quality corned beef sandwich at a good price. However, I asked for my rye toasted and was greeted with \""we don't toast here.\"" How do you not toast a corned beef on rye???",UNK
2700,Great place if you love beer. The food is so so however The service was great. Had a good atmosphere to go out with friends would not recommend for a date.,UNK
2701,"I avoid Pizzeria Bianco because of its notorious wait list. Small brick building in a historical neighborhood, limited indoor and outdoor seating. Parking space is also limited. They really need additional locations. If you drive downtown to Pizzeria Bianco, expect delays and some very popular, tasty pizza.",UNK
2702,"Terrible service, actually I am pretty sure our waiter got canned during the time we were there. Forgot to bring drinks, coffee, have to ask for everything. No offer to give us any compensation. Not going back... Would not recommend.",UNK
2703,Tried Spicy noodle and Drunken noodle and both the dishes were just okay! I live in DC metro region and have had much much better. Service was good.,UNK
2704,"The only thing irish about this \""irish pub\"" is they sever Guiness and have Jameson Whiskey. Otherwise there isn't anything irish on the menu and no irish ambiance at all. Boooring.",UNK
2705,Wonton soup is terrible. I don't know what I expected for mall food but yuck. Broth tasted gamey and the wontons themself just looked bad. Couldn't even bring myself to try one.,UNK
2706,"Good food but horrible service. They're slow and unorganized. I rate it a 2 because the food is good otherwise it'd be a 1 at best.  But the service is not about the customer. We saw what seemed to be a manager poke their head out, see its busy and disappear please.",UNK
2707,Terrible hotel. The whole hotel might as we'll be for smokers. Drink people walking around yelling. No shampoo in the bathroom.\n\nI thought I was being Punk'd. Left and stayed at the Holiday Inn.,UNK
2708,"This place has some really unique guitars that you will not find anywhere else... They also have a really great tech named Doug, who does amazing work and is very easy to work with. I highly recommend checking it out.",UNK
2709,"Been here twice so I'm guessing that means I like it..  But it is the only decent pho joint on the east side that I've come across..  Til I eat somewhere better, it'll stay at 4 stars..",UNK
2710,I have used Full Circle Auto Body many many times both in my business and personal repairs.\nTop notch shop! Tony and Lisa are 100% honest people to work with.\nIf you live in central phoenix and looking for a great honest body shop I highly recommend them :-)\nA+,UNK
2711,The price and location were ok. But the room's walls are too thin. I didn't get a good night's rest because the people in the next room were so loud. If the walls were thicker I wouldn't be able to hear them. My tip is to bring ear plugs.,UNK
2712,"yeah not bad.  very Haight/Ashbury-ish, every corner to this place has got something interesting to look at and observe.  a lot of colorful characters, if you don't mind that sort of crowd.  the guys behind the counter are very cool, the tea was excellent, but the coffee was so-so.",UNK
2713,"Great pizza and really great Garlic Knots. Big and garlicky, took some home. The beer is so good. Try sampler, every beer was great. They also make their own Rootbeer.",UNK
2714,"Unfortunately this business is under new ownership and I have not been as impressed with the quality of my eyebrow waxing. The new owner left one of my brows uneven and thinner than the other, leaving me to have to grow out my brows longer than usual between waxings. I will most likely not be returning.",UNK
2715,Very long wait for a mediocre pizza. \nNot worth the hype. Definitely had better pizzas elsewhere including Phoenix. Grimaldi's in Scottsdale have way better Margarita pizzas.,UNK
2716,If you want cheap pizza that tastes good go to Little Caesars 5 Bucks and your out the door! Unfortunately when I order here I get cold pizza looks like crap and comes with no peppers and cheese!  But ya I suppose you get what you pay for =),UNK
2717,"Have eaten here in the past and the food was good, not so much tonight. The chips tasted stale and the food was flavorless. Don't know if it was an off night or not, but I will try another place before returning.",UNK
2718,"I purchased the Yelp deal and wasn't able to use it; none of the staff even knew about it. It wasn't a huge deal at the time (though it really would have been nice to use!), but I will be pretty upset if it expires.",UNK
2719,"This place sucks they showed up 2 hours late, never called me to say they would be late , the plummer stunk of bad body odor and gave me a price that was crazy. They are dad news, Do yourself a favor don't deal with them. Also scroll down and look at previous reviews they are right this place is horrible",UNK
2720,"Long wait, and bland burgers. Decided to check this places out after passing by it 12 dozen times. I was not really impressed with the service, the food, or the atmosphere. The prices were a bit on the high side for a fast food joint as well.",UNK
2721,I came for the signature tamales and left wishing I would have gone to el sombrero.  the food was shlockely prepared and lacked flavor.  it was also lukewarm.  service was equally thoughtless.,UNK
2722,"This is a keeper. Wine tasting, wine by glass, lovely small dishes for cleansing the pallet. Comfortable, friendly. Great meeting place with a friend to catch up, chat, and enjoy great wines.",UNK
2723,"Resonably priced and very convenient, City Tavern always pleases.  Try the Coconut Shrimp Martini, the meatloaf (with buffalo, pork, and veal), and the Blackened Seafood (sea bass, shrimp, and scallops). Full service bar makes up some good martinis.",UNK
2724,Worst service I have received ever at a restaurant. We just finished paying $20 for ice cream and my daughter accidentally dropped her $1.30 ice cream cone. And they  insisted we pay if we wanted another. Obviously not run by the brightest business owner when that will be that last $1.30 they ever get from me.,UNK
2725,"These guys always do a FANTASTIC, thorough, and professional job. They were recommended to us and we happily recommend them to others. We use them for all of our nasty AZ bug needs! Highly recommended! Thanks for keeping my two babies safe! :)",UNK
2726,They have boba milk teas here in North Las vegas. \n\nEddie was excellent cashier. Bogo on milk teas and smoothies (:,UNK
2727,"Went for the first time today! Was so excited until i tried the Cannoli. The number one rule is that the WHOLE thing is filled with creme. When i got into the middle of mine there was a big gap. Not ok and your staff needs to be a little mature, maybe higher older people!",UNK
2728,I know a lot of people like their donuts but I just haven't had one I thought was better than an average donut like Dunkin.  You can tell they are fresh but it's just not the amazing donut place I hoped for.,UNK
2729,Have eaten breakfast and lunch here many times- always well done- but the item(s) that consistently blows me away are the baked goods- especially the baguette's-absolutely killer...better than any I had in Paris or Oklahoma for that matter! (apologies to Three Dog Night),UNK
2730,"It's a quick fix with pretty healthy options. Flavor was OK, but given the focus the put on the Piri sauces I was expecting more.\n\nDecent change of pace place, not a lot of comparable alternatives.",UNK
2731,Best Japanesse curry in las vegas. I am no expert. I have had Japanesse curry about a dozen times. This place is the best one in Vegas. Great staff to boot!,UNK
2732,"Conveniently located near Energie and Miss Sixty, this store draws in a lot of the hip young folks.  The store is nicely decorated, and the staff is friendly and knows how to dress.  However, most of the employees don't know much about the products and also different sales processes.",UNK
2733,"Love the never ending pasta bowl, and Mark was a great waiter.\nHad the Moscato with lunch and it was great.  Peach undertone favor, and again, you can never go wrong with the OG!! LOL",UNK
2734,"Great place, great food.  There are some slight drawbacks.  The parking spots here during lunch and dinner time are a bit hard to find.  The lighting inside is too dark at times.  The staff and service are exceptional though.",UNK
2735,Sandwiches are pre-made and put in a microwave to warm up. Even after that my sandwich came out cold and had to go back to ask them to microwave again. The iced tea tasted like it was brew several days earlier. Overpriced.,UNK
2736,"Would never go back to this place. Food was simply average at best, with a pricetag that was waaayyy above average. Peter Luger vs The Palm???? An absolute blowout with the clear winner residing in brooklyn!",UNK
2737,"A bit salty for my taste. The curly noodles are a bit thick, but I liked the chewiness.  \n\nService was friendly and attentive as we visited after the lunch crowd.\n\nI prefer the ramen at the Sawtelle district in Los Angeles J-town.",UNK
2738,The food was awful.  The salad bar had wilted lettuce. The steak had absolutely no taste. There is a Texas Roadhouse around the corner. Go there!,UNK
2739,"The classic \""sticks in your gut\"", \""makes you want to take an afternoon nap\"", guilt inducing pizza that everyone should indulge in every now and again.  \n\nAlso, great value.",UNK
2740,"Pleasant little Irish-style place, with a patio and two stories and the usual Irish brews on tap.   But, as other reviewers have said, the lack of food means that the place should not claim to be a pub.",UNK
2741,So happy that Viva Mercado's is back!!! Went this past Saturday and it was awesome! The service was excellent and food amazing! I'm glad that the quality is still there and I really enjoyed the new location. Welcome back!,UNK
2742,We ordered for our office and five people ate and no one thought the food was all that wonderful.  I know that none of us will go back.,UNK
2743,"While the view alone might be reason enough to dine here, I would recommend just having drinks and enjoying the vista because the food here is not good.  It's expensive, yes, but most things on the strip in Las Vegas are.  If it were expensive and quality it would be well worth it, but it is expensive and lacks quality.",UNK
2744,Fast & friendly service - was told by a friend to order the drink with the edible flower.... It did not disappoint!  Lovely refreshing ginger cocktail that is served with a tiny edible flower that makes your mouth tingle. Loved it.,UNK
2745,"Dropped in for a quick bite on Sunday evening. Sat at the bar. After 10 min and the bartender being busy doing other things, we walked out. Won't be back!!",UNK
2746,Very disappointed in the exhibits...too many exhibits that require you to read or watch videos.  I expected more exhibits that had historical items on display. Admission was $20 or $17 for military. Plenty of other ways to spend $20 on Fremont st.,UNK
2747,Excellent food...made while you are here. Yucca root fries were fabulous. A little pricey but worth. Nice east side gem that is off the beaten path.,UNK
2748,"mussels Ok, frites soggy and greasy.  Clearly part of tourist trap central.  Sangria was decent though, and the outside seating on a perfect afternoon helped.",UNK
2749,zero stars because went there today for the first time and had awful service from female bartender.(yelp requires at least one star. sorry but they don't receive one from my experience today.),UNK
2750,"Mediocre food and service with 'no smile'.  Price was pretty low for the subs, but there isn't much to say for the flavor.",UNK
2751,"Too much oil, chicken is covered in batter, you couldn't even taste the chicken.. It's like a regular Chinese food.",UNK
2752,"I have been the Le Village Buffet for brunch several times.\n\nThis time I tried their dinner menu. I was very impressed! The duck meat, ribs, and creme brulee were to die for.",UNK
2753,"This location is a joke.   10:30am on a Saturday and out of all decent savory bagels to make a sandwich, line nearly to the door and barely moving, fountain machine not working, and less than friendly service.   I will make sure to choose a different location next time!",UNK
2754,That place had great food especially great burgers! Too bad it closed! Not sure if they were going to to re-open some where else???,UNK
2755,Would have given them 5 stars if I could have gotten my Fudgey the Whale cake...nope...they are out of business.,UNK
2756,"The burgers are tasty, but they're much more expensive than other fast food burger joints. It's definitely worth trying at least once if you're into burgers.",UNK
2757,"I came here with a great expectation. I ordered a wagyu beef short rib, and it turned out to be \na deep boiled chopped beef. The wagyu beef is known for its quality. what a waste for boiling it!!!!",UNK
2758,"Sorry but the cronetto doesn't make justice to the original cronut, still good though. In the other hand, I had a delicious gluten free lemon pie which was to die for!",UNK
2759,Went there for lunch and the food was fantastic! There is a free valet which helps as there seems to be limited parking. Their ice tea is a black/passionfruit blend that was very refreshing. Very trendy decor and I would definitely go back!,UNK
2760,"I also love coming here for the ambiance.  I have to say that this has the slowest food service, we waited an hour and 15 minutes for our food.  It was good but not worth the wait.",UNK
2761,"I wouldn't recommend going for the food. The drinks on the other hand were pretty good. Had i not had the \""Casa Rita\"" to save my dinning experience i would have ranked this place a two star. \n\nGo for the drinks, skip the food.",UNK
2762,I am a local wedding photographer in town and have had several opportunities to see the beautiful work that comes from this floral provider.  Her bouquets are gorgeous and she is a extremely sweet lady as well.,UNK
2763,"I have been eating here for about 3 years now. Best teriyaki bowl by far and the teriyaki sauce is really good. I have tried other things on the menu, but I come here for the bowls, I go 50/50 half beef and chicken.",UNK
2764,We had a back room for 15 of us and the room was comfortable.  The food was good but I thought it was expensive for a buffet.  There was a huge selection of food and there were ample crab legs to take.  They kept refilling the hot food selections.  The waitress was friendly too.,UNK
2765,This company is family owned and well operated. They will be there when you need it. Today out shower broke and got stuck with water running. His tech got here in time to fix the issue right away. Thanks for the great service!,UNK
2766,"Friendly Service. Fresh Veggies! At only 1 dollar a person for BYOB and no corkage this place is a steal! The price is right too! \n\nIf you are a veggie, curry, wine lover who loves family style friendly service, then this place is for you!",UNK
2767,"Mall l, but I desperately need a beer break from school shopping. And since I was there, I had to have a burger. Not the best burger in town, but an acceptable alternative when out shopping",UNK
2768,Good chicken pesto sandwich.\n\nSuch a tiny kitchen!  Felt strange having to walk through it to get to the broom closet of a bathroom.,UNK
2769,"Pathetic service, employes put very little toppings on so you have to repeatedly tell them for more. Got charged 5.75$ for a spicy Italian. They need to learn their shit or this place is destined for failure. Would never recommend this location to anyone.",UNK
2770,"Great concept, great service! I had the luah pork sandwich...ok but not great. My friend had the tacos that were delicious.",UNK
2771,"Food was tastey for sure, but i don't think the quality is worth the price.  Factoring in that everyone shares, you often aren't filled up for a $40 meal.  \n\nBut the food is good, maybe this place is more suited for parties of 2-6 rather than 12.",UNK
2772,"Great food, friendly service. We both had the Stromboli and they were huge! The food did take a while to come out but it was worth the wait.",UNK
2773,"Buy me chipotle and get chipotlaid~ \n\nJk. My food was great tonight, and I now have lunch for tomorrow. Chips and guacamole from here are my favorite.",UNK
2774,"Great service and awesome breakfast burrito. Everything was really fresh! The atmosphere was very diner-ish but prices were a little higher than expected. However, worth the visit!",UNK
2775,I go here for the lunch and get the lunch special. It's good most of the time but real watery. I ate some bad sushi and regretted it. I probably won't come here again.,UNK
2776,The tacos are top notch.  I have had most of them and can't pick just one to say it is the best! I do like the fish taco. \nThe avocado margarita is fantastic as well!  I doubt you can find these in many places.,UNK
2777,"I really like this place. There is a lot to look through, and there are a lot of cool vendors. Like any antique store, there are some great prices and some inflated prices. There are lots of treasures to be found, so be sure to give yourself adequate time to find them!",UNK
2778,"Lots of good beers on tap; good food menu.  Try the bread pudding, it's delicious!\n\nI hate the atmosphere here, though.",UNK
2779,"I liked the vibe of this place. It reminded me of a few coffee houses I visited in Seattle. The service was friendly and the coffee was great. Be careful with the \""toddy\"" though - it's fantastic but will get you wired really quick!",UNK
2780,"I love charelstons! 5 star service and food at 3 star price. Its all about the ribs and chicken, its amazing. Also the lobster soup is a banger as well.",UNK
2781,I wish I could give this place zero stars. We waited for half an hour just to get our edamame. After another half an hour our spicy tuna roll came with spoiled cucumbers. The sushi from the grocery store taste better than these. The service was horrible too. Do not come here.,UNK
2782,"Was going to order online.. The entire process was such a hassle and in the end I was told I cannot order online.. I guess I can take my business and money elsewhere.. If there was a way to rate with negative stars, I certainly would!!",UNK
2783,"I have been under the care of a chiropractor since age 12.  Dr. Usher is definitely the best that I treated with.  I look forward to seeing Dr, Usher and his staff.  I highly recommend BAC!",UNK
2784,"My first reaction was that the food was kind of expensive.  There were recognizable barbecued meats, but it seemed more liked they were cooked on the kitchen grill than one of the barbecue variety.  There was a good variety of Barbecue sauces from around the country.",UNK
2785,"lovely new owners and delicious food. Fresh bagels made daily, excellent breakfast burritos and bagel sandwiches. small simple menu but everything hits the spot.. We are glad that we gave the new owners a chance to earn our business. Can't wait to go back!",UNK
2786,"This is our quick go to.  i love the variety of single slice choices.  All of the food is always consistent and good.  I have had better Italian, however it's reasonably priced.  It is always busy and sometime hectic.  I would definitely recommend.  Much better than the other choices in the area.",UNK
2787,"I am from New York where pizza is king.  Joe's pizza is the closest to NY style pizza west of the Mississippi.   Crust and cheese is excellent.   Staff us as long friendly,  attentive and fin.  They have TVs so you can watch football too.  Worth the drive off the strip.",UNK
2788,Why do people like this place?  Aside from Christopher's and Cole Haan I cannot think of a single reason to visit the Biltmore.  Pottery Barn?  Ralph Lauren?  A bunch of overpriced ladies boutiques?  Yawn.  Completely unnecessary in a city with so many other quality shopping centers.,UNK
2789,Dump! Dump! Dump! Everyone was rude and totally ignored us. Couldn't get a drink at the bar and couldn't get a table at the Buffett. I guess because we weren't locals...,UNK
2790,"You can't beat $40 a night on a weekday with a stick.  The room was clean and attractive, the exercise room is sufficient.  The buffet is an awesome deal, $14 for dinner (cheaper if you join the club) and the food was decent enough.",UNK
2791,"I have given this panera multiple chances and every time I come here I am disappointed and feel it was a waste of money. The outside patio tables are always filthy with dirty dishes, the lettuce is always wilted, they don't even dress the sandwiches correctly and never fail to mess up my order.",UNK
2792,Excellent!\nHad a bunch of different beers and the pulled pork nachos.\nEverything was very good and all the girls who work there are hot.,UNK
2793,"As promised, Steve hooked it up. I went back and he made sure everything was on point. They washed my car and even got some of the tar spots off-free of charge. I'm a fan! Thanks, Steve!   :)",UNK
2794,"Oh my....Amo questo luogo! We had a  pepperoni pizza and another with spinach,  feta, & sliced tomatoes.  Both were great.  The sauce, the cheese, the crust....delicious! Also, we've tried the Italian calzone. Huge and heavy! So good.",UNK
2795,Nice place.. very posh and trendy... but if you take a Date here... she better be putting out for the Money you will spend.... ijs,UNK
2796,"I travel to Pittsburgh pretty often, and the owner who cooks the crepes recognizes my wife and me every single time we're there.\n\nThe crepes are excellent, the prices are more than reasonable, and as long as you don't go there during a peak period, it's never too crowded.",UNK
2797,Been awhile since I had some fish and chips. This place has been my stopover for some good ol' fish and chips craving. The sauce here really compliments the chips. A fine place for satisfying yourself with good food from Pete's fish & chips.,UNK
2798,Great show for all ages.  Mike was very on the ball and quick-witted.  His tricks were fun and interactive.  He's a charming and talented performer.  This is a must if you're spending a day at the Fremont Experience.,UNK
2799,"As much as I love dining at BLT Steak DC, I had to try BLT Burger in Vegas. A little disappointed. The meat and toppings were real tasty despite an average supermarket quality bun. The skinny fries were just average too.",UNK
2800,Ugh the mussels verde were disgusting. Small portion with three mussels and even delivered with one closed! Good service though. It was comped but very fishy,UNK
2801,"Well priced with a decent range of dishes. Pretty swift service. The restaurant is a bit draughty though, as noted by earlier reviewers. Could also do with having the extractor fan in the gents fitted back into the plasterboard. A good place to go with a group of mates though so I'd be happy to make a return visit.",UNK
2802,"i really enjoy this place the last few times ive been here. the food is good, i do however wish the sides were bigger. the steak is good. however, what probably has to be my favorite, is there staff. i really cant speak any higher of them. \nthere really wonderful and attentive.",UNK
2803,"Absolutely terrible service, after nearly an hour of waiting for the employee to come out of the back with my new phone he told me that I had to buy it at retail price even though it clearly stated online that I could buy it at the discounted price.",UNK
2804,Worst experience my sienna van had a wrap around warranty I bought thru them and they said they would repair my van and got me a rental car then the next day they said they would not honor their word. After back and forth they fixed it and when I drove a block the problem was worsen. I called no call back.,UNK
2805,"Great coffee served up, fairly quick.  I got a peppermint Mocha and Cafe Vienna.  The latter has cinnamon and honey.  Neither coffee drink was too sweet.  Thinking about the pizza.....",UNK
2806,i liked  the food but after a hangover who won't eat anything! great place for hangover not have when sober. great place to people watch that's for sure!,UNK
2807,"Pros: they serve alcohol, and thats about it. No thrills here and recently they have started charging to go downstairs to their 'dancefloor'. This place is not a club and never will be a club so how you decide to charge people to go to your frat house basement is beyond me.",UNK
2808,Do not be fooled by the outside appearance of this hamburger joint! This is the new place to eat! Burgers are huge and tasty. I love this place and will definitely be coming back for more. The inside looks a little empty like it needs some decoration or a special touch of some thing but the food is what counts.,UNK
2809,"They only have one burger on the menu, but when you make a burger this good, you only need one.  \n\nI went there with a few friends and we couldn't decide on which sides to get, so we got all of them.  I would go again just for the sides.",UNK
2810,"Every time I come to Wickenburg I have to eat at Anita's. I dream about the hot salsa, it is so good.  This weekend I had the 1/2 size chicken quesadilla and was not disappointed.  Great service and reasonable prices.  I highly recommend you trying this restaurant.",UNK
2811,"Staff is always super friendly, and the food is the same quality you get at every Denny's. We like to come here when kids eat free every Tuesdays and Thursdays! Lol",UNK
2812,The food came out pretty quick not to mention it was in Vegas! We got seated pretty fast and i definitely enjoyed my food ! Would come back here it was a taste of the normal in Vegas!,UNK
2813,Ridiculously high prices. $75 dollars a person to look over the west rim of the Grand Canyon. Not paying those prices. What a rip off.,UNK
2814,"Was a wicked spoon fan but this place has become my #1 buffet in vegas. Everything was good and could'nt find a glaring misstep, sure some things are better than others but overall this buffet was awesome.",UNK
2815,"Pizza was terrible! Came burnt, which was clearly visible and they still delivered it.  Crust was hard as a rock, too bad, was hoping to find a good pizza place in the area we just moved into!",UNK
2816,My bed was crunchy. \n\nLast time I slept in a crunchy bed was in Rosarito on Spring Break. I also wore flip flops in the shower.\n\nEnough said.,UNK
2817,"Man, you probably seen this place on Man v Food and it's the real deal. The Del Ray is legit. It's like a dang kitchen sink full of sandwich stuffs to feed your face. You should come here if you want some real deal Mexican sandwiches.",UNK
2818,From games to food I agree with all the four and five stars Bill's is getting. I never stayed in the hotel part some people type its small and still giving it four stars it must be good.,UNK
2819,"Using yelp, I got a great deal here. But the food took forever and the man behind the counter couldn't even crack a smile. No doubt it was good pizza though!",UNK
2820,"I used to love this course, but I don't know what is going on there anymore. The greens are just horrible! You can not putt straight there are dead spots and it looks like disease, the ball zig zags all over the place.",UNK
2821,"Good burger and fries, if that is what you are craving.  Nice place in Scottsdale Quarter, friendly staff and good food.",UNK
2822,"I drank a red-stripe and got my hair done by an artist - Sonia.  Why not give it a 5? Hair shampooed, cut, washed w/ conditioner and then styled.",UNK
2823,Always great!  Makes you feel like you could be in an Artisan town!  Great selection of beverages and fresh food!  Best kept secret in AJ!  Shhhhhh....,UNK
2824,New to this area and tried Gecko Grill out because I always see a line outside!  We've gone for breakfast and dinner; both were delicious.  The place is very small and very busy so get there early and expect a wait.  The wait is worth it though!,UNK
2825,Casa Grande I salute you!!  What a great pizza & beer joint!!  On our visit the only bad thing was the Poly-Drug Lord holding court with his Homies right next to us.  The bartender was awesome and the pizza was Shazaam!  Go there......and feast!!,UNK
2826,The best ice cream establishment any of our family has ever been to.  All of the floats are incredibly good.  You never run out of soda.  Nothing compares.  Plus they have very cool antiques to check out while your waiting.  I will be back soon.  Very cool to find a place like this one in AZ!,UNK
2827,The food here is amazing. I have tried more then half of it and it's all great. The staff is fun and the customers new and old mike you feel at home. This is a great place to relax and have a blast.,UNK
2828,Definitely hit up this place of your looking  for a cool atmosphere and great happy hour. Steer clear if you're not looking for a singles meat market...,UNK
2829,They the one mess up my order but she is like it my faul. after she need to make new one she said I have to make sure my order and she give me bad attitude.,UNK
2830,"Easy-to-use online ordering and fast delivery, but not a fan of their sandwiches. Tried the tuna, and it was mediocre.",UNK
2831,Not even at the hotel yet and it's looking grim. Waiting over 30 minutes for my shuttle and no sight of a driver. I've tried calling the hotel numerous times and no answer ... Or ringtone for that matter. \n\nMore to come. If I ever get there.,UNK
2832,"Lived across the street from the place for a year and decided to try it on a whim.  Had a Gyro and it was just what I needed.  The staff was nice, the place was clean and the food was good.  I'll be going back again.",UNK
2833,"Food was good... but service was horrible.   Waited and waited and then waited some more while everyone around us was served almost immediately.  I just wanted some good noodles while visiting.  If I lived here, I would never go back because of the service.",UNK
2834,Their bloody marys don't have celery in them and their food is too expensive when you add it up.  Good coleslaw though.,UNK
2835,"This place is quite outdated.  It feels like I've traveled back in time 20 years.  It certainly wouldn't be my first choice for a place to stay but if you're going to a big event with 100s of people, they can accommodate the seating.  Plus, parking is fairly easy.",UNK
2836,"Great little sushi place worth trying. I'm vegetarian so I can only speak for the vegetarian dishes but its tasty, fresh, and easy.",UNK
2837,"Stopped in while driving through town. The 4 star rating is wrong.... Service was excellent, biscuits and gravy...and toast were good but overall the meal wasn't worth 4 stars. Greasy sausage and the hash browns were dry, powdery, and flavorless.",UNK
2838,Didn't like the uncooked chicken and oily curry.  The roast duck curry was mainly fatty peice a and hardly enjoyable.  I did enjoy the yummy potstickers and iced Thai tea.  I wish I didn't have to feel concerned about getting sick.  Not coming back.,UNK
2839,"The food is very average - the restaurant appears unclean; doesn't go with the fresh vibe you want to feel when going for something like a pita. although the staff is nice, I could never recommend someone to eat here.",UNK
2840,The website says open Sunday's!! We drove 30 minutes to meet friends here.  Update your website!! You lost our business before we even tried your restaurant.,UNK
2841,"The restaurant GM has contacted me based on my review here on Yelp & me posting on Twitter about my experience. \n\nAlthough she was kind and has assured me that these unsanitary conditions will be rectified, I will still not be dining at this establishment. I do however appreciate her phone call.",UNK
2842,"Ordered to go two times so far and have been thoroughly satisfied both times. I've visited a few other Thai places in the valley and have yet to found one worthwhile. Sadly I think this is the first place I've been to that had somewhat fresh vegetables. I think Archi's is \""the one\""!",UNK
2843,"Yuck. The food was terrible. The fries were cold, then microwaved. The waitress was nice enough but not very attentive. The atmosphere isn't very comfortable. I don't see a reason to go back.",UNK
2844,"food was great. I had the crunch roll, dragon roll, and salmon roll. It was amazing and happy hour was decent too. Overall great atmosphere. I have been to many sushi places in the valley and this one is near the top of the list.",UNK
2845,Great store...Mark was just rude!!!  Really like some of the stuff..a little pricey.  Some great deals ..just have to look hard..all the other clerks are wonderful..except for that ONE...,UNK
2846,We waited forever for our food when we were the only ones in the place eating. We could barely understand our what our waitress was saying. My friends burger had a footlong hair in it. We will NEVER eat here again. TERRIBLE.,UNK
2847,"I have a dozen maintenance requests. None get any response. When I call about it, they send a guy that doesn't know what to do. I'm moving out. I've had it. Beware of this place, it's a hell hole!",UNK
2848,"I'm fairly certain that I've puked in the bathroom here at least once.\n\nAnd yes, that's a compliment.",UNK
2849,"I love this place!!!! It was a little harder to find and on the expensive side but it is worth every penny. GREAT steak and seafood too, you know it's good when everyone at the table loves their food and you can't pick out a favorite.",UNK
2850,"I must admit, one of the best burgers i've had! Also a must try, pork belly steamed bun! Everything was amazing... Truffle fries & oxtail chili fries! Added plus was the great service we had from Ashley. Definitely stop by this place!",UNK
2851,Adobo rice was just ok. No haupia and cash only gives this place three stars. Spam musubi was decent tho.,UNK
2852,Wonderful Pizza.  Sclafani's provided pizza for the Desert Canyon Health Screenings last week and it was a wonderful introduction to this new local business.  Thanks so much Sclafani's for contributing to our volunteer event.  The pizza was amazing and I'm looking forward to ordering for my family in the future!!,UNK
2853,"I have not stayed here, but I have done a fashion photoshoot at this resort. I had a great experience. The staff is unbelievably friendly and the views are jaw dropping. The details and design of the overall resort are beautiful and very unique. I would love to come back and stay at this resort.",UNK
2854,"Average food, average service, average prices. Nothing to complain about, just nothing to make it stand out from the many other taquerias.",UNK
2855,"Regardless of all the negatives shown on Yelp we went anyway for a party. The hotel room was clean, bathrooms clean and the entire stay was perfect. Would definitely stay again. The rates cannot be beat. The smoke in the casino was well removed and the food in house was great. Do not believe all that you read.",UNK
2856,"Have purchased two firearms here and recent years and visited multiple other times. Staff is very knowledgable and sociable. Have never felt uncomfortable or unwanted here, as you might at other gun shops. Will definitely continue coming here to purchase my firearms even though its a good 1/2 hr from my home. Definitely recommend.",UNK
2857,"The KimChee bowl...please take off menu.  As a half Korean I was sorely disappointed...and the shrimp \""etouffe\"" was no where close. I dropped $80 here and expected much more.",UNK
2858,Rats ..i buy a $670.22 glove meat ground. But une time using. Was over and the grease come over mi food. I make complain but they dont help mi ..i lose mi money. Dont buy at standard restaurant supply,UNK

2860,"Atmospehere was good, service was fine food wad good but over priced and I have had way better for less... Not a repeat",UNK
2861,"Definitely my favorite room for a tournament on the strip.  So quiet, secluded and smoke free.  Now if my 2 pair could hold up one friggin time.....",UNK
2862,Called to schedule an appoint and the lady who answered said they were closed. She took my phone number and said someone would call me in the morning to put me on the schedule. No one called and when i called them late in the afternoon the following day no one answered the phone.,UNK
2863,"Omg pad kee mau is great here. Affordable, small but plenty of seats. The server may have forgotten I existed but nothing was late or wrong. There was just no fawning. For the price and quality of the food, who cares?\n\nXLNT",UNK
2864,See all the legends on one night! Had a fab time. Good value for money and a very moving finish. The host is amazing!!!,UNK
2865,They have really good iced teas and smoothies! They have a lot more choices to choose from. The people that work there are awesome! They know how to make your day 10x better. Try the mango peach smoothie! It's the bomb like tick tick BOOM!,UNK
2866,"This is another great local spot for lunch.  I love their fresh/healthy approach to their meals.  The portion size is large, but delicious.  Also great covered patio seating and cute interior decoration.",UNK
2867,"I really like this Mimi's, it seems nicer than the one we used to frequent in/near Summerlin. Very friendly staff, clean amenities, and the food is about what I would expect for the prices. My husband hates the coffee here, other than that, it's all good!",UNK
2868,Pizza is good. Pretty normal flavor for this type of place.  The charging for refills annoys me and the service is subpar but they have a cheap lunch special.\n\nThey do have an outstanding ranch though.  I don't know what the secret is but it's the bomb.,UNK
2869,"Their quality has gotten better and this is a run of the mill average buffet. Neither good nor bad, and they often have coupons that come in the mail.",UNK
2870,As a New Yorker I'm am particular about my pizza. But this is pretty close. The people are friendly the service is good. Great food the chicken Parm is one of my favorite I recommend you try it...,UNK
2871,"Just back home. sign up only for this nissan dealer. If u r not insane, DON'T GO!!!!!",UNK
2872,"Stopped in for the first time Friday night. Good music, great sound system, plenty of nice quality screens stiff drinks and cold beers with brand specific glasses. Food was ample and of very good quality. \n\nI understand they have a rotation of 5 live bands. This is my new favorite place.",UNK
2873,"I popped in one night with a date to have a drink and check the place out and was majorly underwhelmed...high drink prices ($5.00 for a coke) and the \""talent\"" left a lot top be desired. Save the time and trouble and go elsewhere.",UNK
2874,"This is a great, family run business with yummy pho! You should definitely try them out! Spring rolls and phone dac biet are d'lish!!",UNK
2875,Took a few of the family for my wife's b-day for brunch. She was not impressed. My daughter and I liked the sushi and the sushi chef was very nice and accommodating. The view and atmosphere was much better than the food. The food was good but it was pricey for the quality.,UNK
2876,Thank You Thank You!  Finally good food and it's Gluten Free!  My first pizza in a year! Fresh salad AND Carrot cupcakes are to die for!,UNK
2877,This place is the bees knees and beyond the cats pajamas! Marlon the bartender is amazing and needs a raise ASAP! And Angela?! Hubba hubba ;)))\n\nHappy Hour specials is hard to beat here and the yogurts soju Is super yummy with good portions!,UNK
2878,"If you're looking for a casual place to hang out with a relaxing patio, this spot is it. Great prices and the fish tacos are yummy. So is the fish n chips and the ice cream sandwich for dessert. My daughter gives this place two thumbs up and she is not easy to please!",UNK
2879,This is so far from Mexican in my opinion. I will never eat here again or recommend this place. I ordered a fish taco that was served with a sweet sauce on it.  Fish and sugar?  Really. The guacamole was runny like pureed peas. Very disappointing.,UNK
2880,"I love an airport that feels like a casino.  If they had free cocktails and waitresses in little skirts, I'd give 'em the full five stars.  There is good people watching here if you run outta quarters.",UNK
2881,This is the only post office in town that is open after 6 pm. \n\nThank you! All the others close at 5:30ish or before that.,UNK
2882,"Food is really bad.. Quantity is very less. Very less options. On top of it, wayyyyyyyyyy pricy. Waiters won't even smile. If I had a chance to go back in time, I will change my decision to eat here.",UNK
2883,"I just had the most amazing maple bacon and chicken on flatbread pizza, and also the hatch green chile and loaded potato pizza.  The ingredients were so fresh and the favors were doing a happy dance in my mouth!  I can't wait until my next visit to this truck.",UNK
2884,"Fresh tasty donuts at any hour, and awesome boba slushes; easily one of the best snack places in town...",UNK
2885,"Nice hotel situated close to old Port. Rooms are comfortable, and service is amazing.......\nNice beds and the shower is pretty nice for a Westin, yo? \n\nRoom service is fast and amazing....",UNK
2886,Horrendous customer service. I've seen the sales associates behaving very rudely to customers. And don't even think about using them for passport photos. Every attempt was rejected by the passport office.,UNK
2887,"Get steak burrito!!! Coz I like spicy, so just have to add hot sauce..\nYum!!\n\nNote: don't have chance to try other stuffs tho.. can't get away from their steak..",UNK
2888,"worst show ever. \n\nMy friends and I got free tickets, and we left in the middle of the show because it was so lame. In the beginning a guy tossed bottles for 10 minutes, and came back again later to toss hats for another 10 minutes.... you got to be kidding me.",UNK
2889,"Reman was ok, but the sashimi I ordered was terrible... It doesn't look fresh, the cut is not clear,  and it even has some chewy stuff in my tuna and another kind of fish. Never know sashimi can be this bad. Worst sashimi experience ever.",UNK
2890,"Great ambiance, very nice upscale thai food. I was comfortable having a late night bite there by myself at the bar. \n\n As a single female business traveler, that's always a plus.",UNK
2891,"The most memorable thing about this restaurant is its interior design, which is apparently one of the best in Montreal. \n\nThe charcuterie was average and the wine was decent, the main course wasn't satisfying either. All in all it was not a great experience.",UNK
2892,Fantastic food and ambiance ... the bartenders are fun and personable.  Great place to unwind after a work week.  Definitely try the wings!,UNK
2893,First you get rid of Raoul and now you've dumped Jaime?!?!?!?!?\n\nYOU GUYS SUCK.,UNK
2894,"poor service, took 10 minutes to get water. Never got refilled. Food was slightly more interesting than IHOP or Denny's but about the same quality. Great place to go after a night of drinking I suppose. We won't be back, just wasn't impressed.",UNK
2895,"Just went here for the first time, Jake helped us out. It was the best service I have ever had at an ice cream parlor or gelato spot! They gave us amazing recommendations. We sat outside and they brought us cold waters and extra cookies! Thank you Frost & Jake! I recommend this place to all my friends and family!",UNK
2896,"Love this place. Local beer list is awesome. Nachos were delish, spouse and toddler loved the garlic knot bread sticks. The sauce here rules...it tastes fresh. Both the nachos and the pizza we selected had chorizo on board. Glad to have a good beer bar and food spot locally for when I visit.",UNK
2897,"Haven't been to a best buy in years because I always had poor customer service. Today was sadly no different. The store was mostly empty and there were plenty of employees around, but nobody came by and offered to help us find what we were looking for while we wondered aisle to aisle.",UNK
2898,"Not really impressed with this spot. I felt like I was in Seattle which isn't really a bad thing but they were trying too hard. The coffee was okay, nothing special. The service was rather poor. I waited for 12 mins for my coffee and they still messed up my order.",UNK
2899,"Not amused. It's an okay show, but actually, I was quite bored. I've seen other Cirque shows and this has to be at the bottom of my list along with Zumanity.",UNK
2900,I thought being in squirrel hill this place would be right on.  More like way off.  The waiter was not very friendly. My food came out 10 minutes after my friends meal did and we were the only ones in there.  I won't be going back there. However the receptionist was very very nice.,UNK
2901,You know there's a problem when you walk into the club and they're playing music that doesnt consist of lyrics.... NOOOOPE!,UNK
2902,I have eaten at Applebee's many times and am rarely disappointed. The service was great and the food was quick and good. Our server kept our drinks filled and our tummy's happy.,UNK
2903,"The food is always great here, but every empty table in the dining room was dirty and it wasn't that busy.  The bathrooms were clean though.  Overall it was a good experience.",UNK
2904,"Ok coffee, retro mug and the benedicts were good, but the potatoes were banal. Staff was cool, service was on point and the window needs some cleaning.",UNK
2905,Really top quality Mexican fare and fairly priced. Great location with lots of seating and very nice Happy Hour with a really nice bartender. Get the peel and eat shrimp!,UNK
2906,My favorite Roberto's in town. It's very clean and the employees are very polite. My favorite is the carnitas plate aka #10. Very juicy and tender. The classics are very good too like carne asada fries/nachos and burritos are great too!!,UNK
2907,"The iced tea is amazing, as are the baked goods. I have been known to eat an entire maple scone before even getting back to my office.  I don't drink coffee but I hear it's amazing.  Pass by the Starbucks on the corner and head to Cartel!",UNK
2908,Best service and customer satisfaction. Got my phone fixed super quick. This company is reliable and legit. Hit em up for any phone services. Prices are fare too.,UNK
2909,"Had reservations for 9:30, still have not gotten a table yet and its 10 now. This is amateur hour......bbye",UNK
2910,no press shirts came back with wrinkles! how do you do that? these are work shirts that you don't even have to press....these guys sent them back to me with wrinkles in them....run away....,UNK
2911,Lukewarm pho - i think our soups had been sitting out in the kitchen for awhile. Really bad and slow service. Won't be back.\nThe table next to us remained dirty the whole time we were there. It was really gross.,UNK
2912,"Service was horrible, waited ten minutes at the drive up window for a person to acknowledge we were waiting for our drinks. There were no cars in the drive thru when we arrived, and no reason for it to take so long. Drinks were wrong when we finally got them. Will not be returning to this location.",UNK
2913,"I'm never disappointed picking up a slice at Desert Ridge slices - the kids love  it, and I'm a fan of the NYC triangle slice too. Plus, I pick up all my weekly magazine reads in their shop as well.",UNK
2914,Peter and I breakfasting after our sunny side up desert ride at the good egg. Our eggspectations were exceeded by our eggstra special attention and service from Candace and Julie.,UNK
2915,Support local chocolatiers! Davidson chocolate has great truffles and EXCELLENT icecream. Their custom truffle boxes are a great idea for a housewarming gift or birthday gift for a co-worker. You have to check it out!,UNK
2916,Food is awesome!!!!...service two thumbs down! Sat ourselves after about 10 minutes got up to look for a server. Then had to ask for our check. They can not communicate with the customers. They are speaking amongst each other as they are in their own world. No personality!!,UNK
2917,This is a must visit. The staff is happy and bubbly. The decor is earthy yet classy and the food is outstanding and to top it off they serve breakfast til 3pm!!!  There omletes are amazing and who doesn't luv sweet potato fries.,UNK
2918,Peanut shells at your feet. Loce this type of bar feel. Darts. Billiards and golden tee. YES !,UNK
2919,"Cheap, Fast Chinese food. Food isn't that great, but the price over takes it. I love going here for quick food. It is a good complement for my busy schedule from CMU.",UNK
2920,The food is amazing in all aspects!! The kabobs .. gyros.. pita.. and GARLIC SAUCE!!  Not to mention an amazing staff.. we will be coming back on a regular basis.,UNK
2921,"A very friendly, true Frenchman. A very proud owner. Curbside appeal is non existent. The interior is inviting & charming. The pastry display is disappointing & a bit unkept, but makes up in true cultural flavor. Although only three stars, hoping to see this business supported.",UNK
2922,"Great hukkah lounge uptown. You need a reservation, don't ruin your night thinking you can walk in or sit at the bar, chances are very slim. The desserts are outsourced, so that's all I will say about that.",UNK
2923,Good theaters - but all the theaters should have AVX seating instead of just one.\n\nService is decent.\n\nI frickin HATE the herding method of getting people to by tickets.\n\nIMAX theaters are awesome :D,UNK
2924,"This was the first time i had a gentlemen do my hair and he was great! He gave me lots of advice on my hair and was extremly friendly, definitley will be back. My hair looking amazing is just a bonus!",UNK
2925,Pretty cool place. A different variety of people here. Everyone kind of minds their own business. Nobody seemed too judgmental. Pretty kickback. Definitely dive-y but it's got it's own style. I would come here again. The live bands they had were pretty good.,UNK
2926,"This is a must see!   I knew iit would be cool, but it was beyond neat.  Seeing the old signs and learning the history of them was well worth the $15.  You must make reservations, but it is well worth it.",UNK
2927,"Just ok. The cheese curds are delicious. The beer is just average. The pretzel is  not a pretzel, it's bread with salt on it, shaped like a pretzel.",UNK
2928,This is a nice quant restaurant with beautiful chandeliers. I was able to try several dishes and all time favorite was the crusted salmon!,UNK
2929,I stopped in to check this place out. I needed shirts and hats. After talking with them I decided to let them design my logo. They did a great job and I got to see in person instead of ordering something off the web. \n I will continue to use Caveman in the future.,UNK
2930,I had the most fantasic dinner there. The service was perfect. The food blew me away. And the wine pairing suggested by the Sommerlier we so enjoyable. I can't wait to go back. This is fine dining!,UNK
2931,"Great selection of candy, but really sad they no longer sell Baskin-Robbins sugar-free candy. If you're looking for Arizona cactus candy, scorpion lollipops, etc. they have those here!",UNK
2932,"So tell me, why would you own a self serve dog wash and not let people with hairy dogs use your services! Makes no sense to me. I think Principessa pets, Poochy Kleen, or The Soggy Dog would be much better choices!",UNK
2933,"Sad came here at 9:30 and they said they were closed. Totally will never be back! Sad as the food was good, but in Vegas you got one time to screw up in customer service. I never got an apology!",UNK
2934,I didnt get a chance to eat here because they close between lunch and dinner which was pretty disappointing. The hostes could have cared less also which doesnt make me inclined to try again...... :o(,UNK
2935,"the only problem that we had was it seems that parts and labor prices were on the high side. This is a used car and our first VW. Service wise other than the prices. This is a very friendly and attentive place for service. work was done in a very quick and professional manner. Great job guys, just not sure on pricing.",UNK
2936,We tried this place a few months ago while hanging out on Mill. It was incredible! Great food and the price is right. Got an appetizer and two meals for $25 so not bad for Mill Ave. \n\nWe both got gyros with Greek fries. Super rich food but worth it.,UNK
2937,No wait at 2pm on a Tuesday. Lunch rush was over. Pho was decent... Broth flavor was alittle blend had to add a lot of hoisin sauce and sriracha but love the noodles strain... Thin and soft. Their shrimp spring rolls was on point. Clean and inviting environment. :),UNK
2938,They are all super friendly. The service is fast! And the good is amazing. Their tacos are fantastic! This place is great.,UNK
2939,Had their slider burgers with truffle fries.  Very good.  Would have rated 5 star but was seated at the bar and due to some poorly placed beer taps couldn't see past them to watch the NCAA tourney games on TVs behind  the bar.,UNK
2940,Very much disappointed for a five star hotel to serve such a crappy food and for the price they charge.  Nothing special woth regards to the quality of the food and the variety of the food.  Will never  recommend this place and will never go back.  The only plus side is our waiter was a totally nice guy and the dessert is also fine.,UNK
2941,Great drink menu! I could honestly go either way on the food. Way overpriced for the taste if you ask me lol! Love the mac and cheese though! But besides the mac and chee......stick with drinks! 6 pack sampler is nice if you like a variety and want to try something new.,UNK
2942,Man I forgot how good the pizza was. It was thick crunch yet soft. My wife and I will definitely go back. And the service was good. I think our server was over sat with customers but he did his best to make it pleasant.,UNK
2943,Came here for a light dinner. Great Pad Thai noodles!  Just the right amount of spice.  Chicken satay and spring rolls were good too.  Service was terrific.  We'll be back.,UNK
2944,"Went back today 12-12-12 ordered combination teriyaki bowl beef and chicken, about 5 pcs beef and 5 pcs chicken dark meat.what a rip off.don't think will be going back there again.was better before, don't know what happened.",UNK
2945,"The \""jumbo\"" chicken wings must have come off of a pigeon, because they were tiny! The five cheese pizza was not very good, the crust was very chewy, and the pizza wasn't very cheesy at all. The Philly steak pizza on the other hand was pretty good..",UNK
2946,I have since found out that Bob Evans sold this off and they have gone to a more French menu.  This explains the reduction of choices.  I am not impressed and will likely never go to Mimi's again unless there is a change in the menu.,UNK
2947,"Here for karaoke. The server couldnt care less about her section...the decor here is dusty and old, makes me fearful to even order food.",UNK
2948,"Great place, whether it's lunch or dinner time. Hummus is to die for! Just a warning though - the kebabs are a bit spicy for those who don't tolerate any spice at all. Really recommend to check this place out.",UNK
2949,Great lunch menu. Food here is always good but the service can be kind of hit or miss. They had one waitress named Jamie that was probably responsible for drawing in half of their business.,UNK
2950,Amazing place to be with both family and friends with so many interesting things to learn about desert life and many fun filled ways to learn them.,UNK
2951,"This place doesn't exist!!! They refer you to \""Sunset & Vines\"" and they are horrible! Avoid at all costs!!!",UNK
2952,"Good and affordable sushi buffet; for $14.99 on lunch time you have a wide selection of items to choose from, and vetegetarian options as well. The food tastes fresh and is salty but good. Service was fairly quick on a weekday at lunch time. A buffet I will go back to, certainly.",UNK
2953,"Staff at this location is a bit rude and condescending. Gym is ok, no real free wights , no bench, this is not for serious body builders. As a plus there are a lot of quality cardio machines",UNK
2954,"Awesome place, friendly people and a veterinarian that actually listens to an owner and decides a plan of care together instead of assuming he knows best. Don't have a single negative thing to say about this place and so happy I read the reviews and went!!",UNK
2955,"Nice store. Super busy. A lot of variety will good prices, but they don't bag your groceries. So beware if you are doing major shopping.",UNK
2956,"There are definitely better Italian restaurants on the strip with cheaper prices. Also, service on a good day is just OK. So that should tell you something. I would advise that  you to try somewhere else. Don't waste your time. Especially since I can't remember how the food tasted. Yeah, this is one of those places.",UNK
2957,So disappointing. Food wasn't even 'just ok'. In a city of great restaurants this one isn't even acceptable. Don't waste your time on bad food at three times the cost of much better places.,UNK
2958,"My new favorite restaurant in Scottsdale!!  Awesome service, amazing food, great atmosphere.  Watching Chef Chris maneuver about the kitchen and tables is like watching theatre...  I haven't posted to Yelp in quite some time, but this place made me get on here same day!!",UNK
2959,This place was pretty cool.  What I liked most was the atmosphere.  Completely open to the strip.  It was a little expensive but great appetizers and beer.  The nachos were delicious. Walked by later on and a girl was dancing on the bar.  Missed that show for my meal.,UNK
2960,"They have everything you need here!  From Designer to chain stores!  You name it!  Love the architecture of the building!  It definately stands out from the strip and a must place to visit, if you love shopping.",UNK
2961,I wanted to like it more but left me feeling unsatisfied. All the food seemed salty. For a place called the Spaghetti Factory it better have some killer sauce...but not so.\nService was good. Food not so much.,UNK
2962,Hand down the BEST BBQ I've had in Las Vegas!  Beats the pants off those chain places and Big Mike is down home good people!  Stop in and git ya some BBQ and homemade cobbler ... you won't leave hungry.,UNK
2963,I have been here several times and have had no issues. The staff is very friendly and professional. The food is great (especially the burgers) and I will keep going back as long as they'll have me.,UNK
2964,"seiously... service is great, food is totally not worth it...gez  poor waiter had to serve garbage to me =.= i felt sorry for him... it really lets me down, i had a pretty high hope for it....do not go there...for any occasion",UNK
2965,All I wanted was to see if my insurance was accepted. I was on hold FOREVER and when they finally came on the line they asked for my name and number because their call volume was too high. Way to make me feel like a valued customer :( 30 minutes wasted....,UNK
2966,"Good food,  big portions for the price.  Guacamole tasted fine. Closer to Mexican food than taco bell. I'd eat here again.  We had the super nachos and a chimichanga plate. They served more than we could eat.",UNK
2967,"Great place.  Went here a couple of times.  Not overcrowded with too many tourists, although I am considered one myself when I do go out to Vegas.  I like it when it's not overcrowded too, so you can actually dance.  Nice outdoor patio area as well.",UNK
2968,"Being that I travel for a living and my overwhelming enjoyment of prerty much all things sushi, I like to try as many places as possible when it comes to sushi bars. This one is amongst the best and is my favorite!  Not exactly cheap mind you. For the best deals come in Sunday through Thursday and select from the Happy Day rolls.",UNK
2969,"I'm here almost every Saturday and I always bring friends. The barista are great, the regulars are relaxed, the drinks are carefully made (and delicious) and the atmosphere is *perfect.*",UNK
2970,Great sushi! Everything is fresh and delicious. The staff is nice and polite. Every time I come here I enjoy the food. I highly recommend it if you like classic sushi. If the southside is too far go to the original spot on Mt. Lebanon.,UNK
2971,Tacos are ok. Just as good as tacos el gordo. I think I like the pecos location a little more.,UNK
2972,"Great food, okay coffee, nice staff still working out some of the bumps.  A bit high priced for a place calling itself a neighborhood restaurant. Will be back!",UNK
2973,Based on the reviews I was excited to try it however based on the tip I can verify its closed. There is now graffiti on the building.,UNK
2974,"I went to the San Diego location and the Scottsdale location and both were clean, coutious staff and fast service..I got my bikini area and underarms done! Thanks Laser Away !! :)",UNK
2975,"I can't believe we'd never been here.  We enjoyed the drive, the walks, the views and the shelters.  I little difficult for our elderly father but he still enjoyed it.  The path to the benches was rough but we made it assisting him on his walker.",UNK
2976,The filet mignon was amazing and banana nut martini hit the spot..the service is good..they know what's up,UNK
2977,This is the worst location starbucks I've ever been to in my life- and I've been using starbucks almost daily for 10 years- 90% of the workers there have the worst attitudes- specially the older ladies- the young ones are very nice-,UNK
2978,"Love the atmosphere and food, my favprite is the cobb salad. usually has okay service but could definitely be better! Won't stop me from coming back.",UNK
2979,Umm NO! It's like a Mexican Chilis. However the arepa appetizer was alright and that's about it.,UNK
2980,"We were out shopping and a clerk at the store suggested this place.  Its an old Pizza Hut and our expectations were low bases on the exterior.  Delicious, fresh chinese food.  Friendly staff and amazingly clean!  Highly reccomend.",UNK
2981,"I mean it's Denny's, the \""McDonalds of breakfast.\"" Can't really be mad that the food quality was poor and the service was mediocre. Our waitress simply provided piss poor service because we asked her to do her job. Won't be back to this place.",UNK
2982,"From the service to the burgers everything is top-notch! The Fatboy shake was the best of the four we had. The burgers were cooked perfectly, and tasted awesome!",UNK
2983,"This is Fish n Chips with a Mexican flair.  Not sure what all the hype is about, though, if you like Fish n Chips, it's decent.  I just prefer the British version better.",UNK
2984,"Although they seem to care about dogs, and appear to take good care of them, this place is quite disorganized.   If you have patience regarding errors with billing, record keeping, and things that you specify and they did not remember to do, this place is just okay.",UNK
2985,"Pros- Located in a good location by the Boardwalk, beautiful and great for a night out or date night.\n\nCons-Sushi rolls are tiny and not worth the price you pay for! If you want quality sushi; this isn't the place to go.",UNK
2986,Its an expensive burger/pasta place. Probably wont go there again. The food we ordered was good but just way to expensive for my taste. I only got a salad and soup and it was WAY over priced. Its a good date place if you are trying to impress but not really a place you would visit regularly.,UNK
2987,Well I can't grade the staff we really didn't use them. There is so much cool stuff here from cooking toys to kids toys. We spent a good 45 min there and just poked around. Interesting creative and teaching crafts for kids that could enhance any B-day party.,UNK
2988,Bar is amazing.  The Restaurant was sub par for the prices.  I ordered the peppercorn filet and it was encrusted with WHOLE peppercorns which made it inedible.  It should have been stellar for that price point.,UNK
2989,We found this gem and my boyfriend who grew up on Bul go ki beef from his Tae Kwon do instructor loved this place! The sushi is also fantastic.,UNK
2990,I love this place. I have been taking my friends and they love it too. I have only ever ordered breakfast but it is amazing!!! The staff is also great! Im starting to get to know the entire family. Nicest people ever.,UNK
2991,Grade: D+\n\nI'm not sure how this place has been in business so long. Maybe people in Madison just like bad Italian food.,UNK
2992,"I have Gibsons back on this one, the spring rolls are rank. Like moldy, frozen veg  buried alive in a papery pastry. Just tasted like soggy cardboard. My Special Fried Rice was pretty good though.\n\nNot the best, but it'll do.",UNK
2993,"Standard hooters, if you plan on watching a game or event get there way early.  Check that, this hooters is no longer here.",UNK
2994,Service is always horrible. A female server was training a new guy and she was very rude. Still tipped her good regardless of her rudeness. Food is always well prepared and tasty but the service could be much better.,UNK
2995,Made a reservation with my fiance. When we got there 5 minutes early they said they overbooked and could wait an hour or eat at the bar. No apology,UNK
2996,"Great friendly customer service, also a variety of pretzel products at a reasonable price! Definitely a place to stop at if your in Brookline :)",UNK
2997,"Not a huge fan.\nNot a lot of flavor and while it comes out hot.. Doesn't seem fresh. With other options in the area, I don't plan on returning.",UNK
2998,"Very crowded, food is just ok, bartenders are outstanding, great location, but here's my issue, why on earth do they charge a cover to go in? This is a drinking/eating establishment and they charge a cover when there is no band playing? Seems ridiculous and all about $$$$$$$$!",UNK
2999,"Called in morning on Thursday July 3, left a message. Answering machine didn't say anything about being closed for holiday, today is Monday July 7th, still haven't received a return call. Called another pool service on 3rd, they answered right away & sent someone out that day.",UNK
3000,I love Lucilles . Their chicken is wonderful. The bed pudding is great and the service and atomosphere are also great. I would go there over and over.,UNK
3001,Great food and good service as well. Happy hour daily from 3-6! Definitely put it on your sushi list.  Recently tried additional items and will be sticking with the Sushi only...,UNK
3002,Prolly one of the best Indian restaurants in Las Vegas area.. A variety of cuisines made in the most authentic manner. The service is just wonderful and food quality is just amazing ... Every time I go to Vegas I go to this place without fail...,UNK
3003,The happy hour here between 4-6 is pretty bomb... plus all the attention since we were basically the only ones there....\n\nDon't judge me!  :O,UNK
3004,"Pretty much met my expectations, which was quite low. The best thing was the bbq beef ribs, but I expect better quality and selection if I'm paying 20 bucks for dinner at a vegas buffet.",UNK
3005,"I think this is a great shop so felt i needed to highlight somewhere that seems really good at what they do, honest and good value.\nIts definately a bit more old fashioned and not slick like the 'trendy' jewellers but i think its all the better for it and their workmanship is first rate and prices very reasonable.",UNK
3006,"The food is always pretty good, but the cupcakes are always mediocre. My coworker once again bought some for employees for Valentine's Day, and the one I just ate isn't something I'd recommend.",UNK
3007,"Food is ok, the view is amazing. You pay a high price for the view because there are much better restaurants as far as food goes.  Atmosphere is ok, waiters are not very friendly. The souffle was great!",UNK
3008,"Food was tasty and prices were reasonable. There's just a lot of competition in the family run, homemade style mexican food catergory. This one is great place to go if it's in your neighborhood, but there are others out there just as good.",UNK
3009,Delicious food. Friendly service. Best breakfast on our end of town.  So glad this restaurant is here - we go every weekend it is so good!,UNK
3010,"Best male only shop in vegas, the girls give you massages on your head, parafin dips, back massages, a killer haircut and they are all very sweet and nice.   Give it a try, I will not go anywhere else.   5 Star Service, 5 Star Value",UNK
3011,Stayed at the Mandalay Bay for the weekend came to Starbucks 3 times and all 3 times they're was some kind of drama.  These ladies don't give a shit.  Prepare to have a coffee with a side of drama.,UNK
3012,"Good to have this restaurant nearby! Mostly Vietnamese, with a twist of fusion.\n\nWe had Fish Taco, Steak & Egg, Mekong River Style Noodle Soup and everything was tasty! The ambience was good too.",UNK
3013,Great local steakhouse. Went on a Saturday night and had a complete prime rib dinner for $9.99. Huge cut of meat and very little fat but lots of flavor cooked perfectly.  Note: they have changed their name back to New River Station as of May 2010.,UNK
3014,I love shanghai-nese food since I am shanghai-nese.  The staff was helpful in ordering stuff.  Food was quite good so no complaints.  I would come back when I am in town.,UNK
3015,"Enjoyed a delicious lunch during their happy hour. Ordered their sashimi sampler and a few sushi rolls. The food was excellent and prepared very quickly. The service was great, especially since we were a picky bunch. Overall the ambiance, food and service was impeccable.",UNK
3016,Are you serious? !! First time here visiting from Cali and they don't have ketchup?? -___- disappointed,UNK
3017,Found out today the owner has banned me from going back because of the bad review. Free poker is played there but what a joke owner and bad business practices.,UNK
3018,Ooohhhhhh..... Mmmmmyyyyy.... Gggooosssshhhhh!!!!!! Need I say more?,UNK
3019,"Everything here is extra salty and doughy.  We ordered a strombolie which was very salty, An order of garlic knots which was extremely doughy,  a pizza and meatball sliders which was super salty. The saltiness of everything overpowers the flavor.",UNK
3020,"Meh.  That sums up the pizza.  I've had better and worse.  Location is good, comfortable interior.  Only had the slices, nothing else.",UNK
3021,"Excellent Portion of ribs on Half rack dinner, Coleslaw was decent could have been Costco. Corn bread was ok. I would go back. I am still looking for the BBQ joint to go to.",UNK
3022,On a road trip and the Thule rack started to lean. These guys tightened it up (w/o charge) and sent us on our way much relieved. Thanks.,UNK
3023,"Steak is good. Wine list decent. Ambiance is pleasant and well suited to business luncheons/dinners. I thought the muted TV showing live sports in one corner brought it down a notch but this is an American chain, after all. No draft beer but only bottled? Oh dear... that's an oversight.",UNK
3024,Had a massage for a set time and they did not have a therapist for me when it came time.  They did not know what to do and had no options for me.  Very disappointed.,UNK
3025,They are the god damn worst. They keep you waiting for 2 hra just to tell you that compacity is full. Worse Club Ever!! Do not go here,UNK
3026,This place is such a joke. The only reason I'm not giving it zero stars is because the Steakhouse here is the best in the city. The best thing about it is that practically nobody but the most in-the-know foodies and locals know about this place. Come here and wow all your friends on your next trip.,UNK
3027,So sooo good! 16.00 bucks a piece and my friend and I ate like queens. Delicious meat and rice and salad. Recommend it for sure.,UNK
3028,"It was 11am and I was near-death, needing coffee. I saw a little hand-painted sign advertising and was greeted with a blast of cigar smoke when I walked in.\n\nI can't say I've ever been to a cigar bar-meets-coffee shop, but I thought highly of this very eclectic place.",UNK
3029,"Service is the worst, food is alright, the general manager Amanda Osborne is ungodly awful. If you go there, pray that she isn't there and John isn't your waiter and you might be alright. Save your money for Joe's or Ruth Chris.",UNK
3030,"Had a groupon, but still not worth it.  Service was bad, fly in the margherita, and the food was cold and tasteless.",UNK
3031,"\""I'm STARVING! waited 34 mins AFTER gettin seated just to flag a different waiter to take our All You Can Eat sushi order. This place used to be my favorite sushi spot but the service sticks out the most (above the food) and this place really went to the gutter.\""",UNK
3032,The employees seem to hate their lives. We waited 15 minutes before the server even acknowledged us! They need some vitamin D in their lives!,UNK
3033,Legit club in Vegas.  It was a friday night but it wasn't overly crowded.  We stayed for a few good hours and were burnt out.\n\nLots of tools in the club though.  Eddy Hardy types.  You know what I'm talking about.,UNK
3034,"Food was good, however the service was absolutely horrible.  Not attentive at all.  Three tables of customers and after food was delivered it's like the staff vanished. I am rating only three based solely on service. It was the worst.  I don't think the servers understand that tips are earned.",UNK
3035,"This place has descent breakfast.  I especially liked the healthy breakfast selection which included omelets made with egg whites. \n\nFriendly staff, descent prices, kid friendly, clean, casual setting.",UNK
3036,"The smells from the kitchen are just amazing, great quality steak selection, intimate wine room for a group, and the BEST dessert in all of Phoenix. The service is a little fast for my taste at this price range, but the butter cake...you just can't say no to...",UNK
3037,"Good downtown casino with good atmosphere; friendly and centrally located. Try the breakfast buffet (which I reviewed already), but cool casino. Hot out today, but A/C cool in Main Street Station :)",UNK
3038,Nice looking resort on the outside lots to do outside. Great water slide kid friendly not overly expensive. Aged interior rooms. Lockout rooms are small quarters. Was a one night stay so I got by if I was going to stay I would recommend a suite. Nice gym spa.,UNK
3039,"I really was not impressed. I didn't like the service or the food. Plus, it said it was casual and definately was not...",UNK
3040,Food was average to below average. I had better at major Italian chains for half the host. You pay for the location. Me and my wife got two salads and two simple pasta dishes for $70 no wine no dessert.,UNK
3041,I had a handtossed pepperoni pizza which was great but the bone less chicken was pathetic 8 dry tiny pieces in a big ass box 15 $ for both now thats rediculous u don't think I will get any chicken again!,UNK
3042,"Decided to try a newer foot massage place close to home. Had a 1 hour session $40.00. Very good staff, clean environment. If your on the southwest side of Vegas I recommend! Nice lobby / waiting area. Was given a complimentary bottle of water upon my leaving.",UNK
3043,Called 15 minutes ahead for a walkin. Anthony tatted Me for an outline of Tennessee that filled my inner bicep. 70 bucks took about 45 minutes in all.,UNK
3044,"CLOSED - This was a nice comfortable place with good coffee, and I wish they had succeeded.\n\nClosed shop this past Wednesday (7/27) and the signage was down the next day - the fastest anything has ever happened in the Phoenix area... ever.",UNK
3045,Interesting museum in uptown. From California so it is always interesting to learn about the history of the south. Great family location for an outing to make the day also educational. Brought my daughter who enjoyed the interaction displays that made the experience more fun.,UNK
3046,"The food here is amazing, and the service is lightening fast!  The food was out within 10 minutes of us ordering, and it tasted fresh.  The prices are very reasonable, but be sure to bring cash!",UNK
3047,"This placed closed a while ago!\nWhen they were open, they had great happy hour hurricanes and deep fried pickles!  Regular menu seemed overly pricey.  Oh well...gone now!",UNK
3048,"$30 for a burger and milkshake (tax and tip included). My burger came out cooked incorrectly, which is sucks considering how much my burger cost, but mistakes happen and I'm not holding that against them. The food was just bland even with an egg and bacon.",UNK
3049,"Not as good as local pubs, food is pretty bad, and they got our drink menu mixed up last time.. asked for a Stella.. got a Guinness. Friend asked for hot tea, got ice tea.\n\nThey really need to work on their food quality. They leave a lot to ask for.",UNK
3050,"Street Tacos are good, Happy Hour Corona's for $2.50, great for Happy Hour or a laid back evening. Nothing like the Dos in Scottsdale, but if you're feeling in the mood for steak nachos and a beer with no fuss, this is a good spot.",UNK
3051,they are LUCKY to get even this 1 star ...if possible i would of given them -5.....EXTREMELY RUDE....I will never walk into this location again.....AVOID at all costs this location!!!!,UNK
3052,many amazing nights at the tumble inn.\nthe only place i could and can get a ice cold woodchuck.\n\ni miss the tumble inn....was good to be back in for a visit recently.,UNK
3053,"Always good avacado eggrolls, ice tea, and chicken teryaki. A good choice everytime. This location is busy but you can walk around after a meal.which is a plus.",UNK
3054,Basically a freindly staff.  Food was good.  Drinks were average.  They had no problem putting on whatever NFL game we wanted.,UNK
3055,It's close to our home and the food is generally pretty good. I like the sushi and the orange chicken the best. the only thing I don't like about the place is most of the staff is not very friendly and the prices seem to be going up a little more each time we go in.,UNK
3056,First visit I saw the Doctor in 30 minutes.  The second visit was about an hour.  Staff was friendly and knowledgeable.  All questions I had were answered.,UNK
3057,"Pretty solid pizza joint, ny style, big slices, a bit pricey as my slice of pepperoni was $5. Located on third floor beside sushi rest. Worth a trip tho.",UNK
3058,"I thought I'd give State Street Brats a lower rating, until I realized that \""Flip Night\"" and the fact that they have stadium white brats is amazing.\n\nIf you're not going for one of those two things, avoid it like the plague.",UNK
3059,"Store, not bad. But STAY AWAY FROM THE PHARMACY. I've taken prescriptions here around 10 times, and all 10 have either been misplaced or screwed up. They are the worst pharmacy I've ever been to, bar none!",UNK
3060,Eye Priority is a fantastic business - quality and professional eye exams by caring optometrists - fashionable and large selection of frames to choose from coupled with a extremely helpful staff. No better place for prescription eyewear in Ahwatukee!,UNK
3061,"This is not a well run Wal-Mart. Usually out of at least one item we go for. Have stopped shopping here and go to the one in SC, a much much better experience. \n\nHave spoke with management about their inability to keep the basics on the shelves. Always excuses, no accountability. Go elsewhere.",UNK
3062,"Honestly I thought this place was pretty average. They serve your typical Chinese cuisine. It's edible, but nothing out of this world. Then again, I am Chinese so I could end up having higher standards for Asian cuisine than your average consumer. It is nice that they have pho but it's really quite ordinary.",UNK
3063,Seriously! On my top 10 restaurants in the world. I still dream about the lobster pasta! I would drive four hours into Montreal brave the border patrol just to eat at this restaurant again then go home.,UNK
3064,"Nice buffet but nothing special. There are, for example, not a large selection of seafood.\nSome courts simply did not taste. I had expected that otherwise. \nThere are definitely better buffets in Las Vegas",UNK
3065,"A simple request, salt. Never got. Waiter never came back to check on us after the food was serverd. A simple courteous long time practice. This place is too busy for me. I felt like an orphan. In thier defense, food was excellent.",UNK
3066,"Not only is this the best pizza in Phoenix, it's among the best I've ever had (and I have spent a few weeks in Italy). And we got free lemoncello!",UNK
3067,"My small business has used Kleen Geeks for over a year.  We are very pleased with their service, their flexibility, and their value.  If we need to adjust the schedule or ask for special services, they are easy to get hold of and very accommodating.",UNK
3068,"Really enjoyed the food and service. Delicious ribs and brisket. Mac & cheese was different, but very tasty. The owners were extremely attentive and friendly. Very reasonable prices...four of us ate for less than $40. Go try it out and support a local business",UNK
3069,Really great food and atmosphere! The cocktails are right on target! Fun and comfortable place to hang out with friends. Great service and friendly staff. I will definitely be back!,UNK
3070,My wife & I are from Canada and went to see Jim because of all the excellent reviews he has and I must say that he is the best man for the job and he sure knows how to make you feel better. When we come back to Vegas we will be sure to stop in for another massage!!!!!,UNK
3071,"My parents love this place.  How they found it I'll never know.  The food didn't blow me away, but it was good. I would return if invited by someone, but would go there again on my own.\n\nBit of a scary neighborhood though - lock your car doors!",UNK
3072,This was a pleasant dining experience. Wanted some Mexican and we found it!\nReasonable prices for 2 and it was very TASTY! Very casual and the wall was painted wonderfully with a mural that was very interesting!! Fast walk up service and clean inside! Definately goint to go back!,UNK
3073,Worst service I have ever recived in my life. Ordered food for my toddler to come out first and it came out last. Waitress was awefull and tried making excuses why a table that was seated and ordered after us had there food before us.,UNK
3074,"This place is amazing! They have amazing food.. Love the Bruschetta plate. It's very filling and great for 2! Make it an evening, enjoy some wine, very cool place to hang out!",UNK
3075,"I've gone to the other fat willys locations and the vibe is usually great and thought I'd come here for lunch. This is a golf bar and grill so it's mostly old people, but compared to the other fat willys this place has way better food. I recommend the philly. Was delicious.",UNK
3076,"Hot and fresh donuts made to order. They offer total customized donut, glazed with your choice of 19 glazes and 14 toppings. Didn't realize that I was missing this in my life. Fantastic donuts.",UNK
3077,was a little hesitant with the low ratings i saw but i liked it.  the decor was great!  surprised with the pond and geese with the authentic mexican blankets and tile.  i ordered the meatball soup and liked them both.  the price was reasonable.  would go back.,UNK
3078,Hubby and I love this place and a regular haunt for us.  My Hubby's fav: adobo fried rice and spam musubi.  My favorite: pinakbet and Thelma's special.  This is a must try for anyone craving Filipino food.,UNK
3079,I had the chicken curry bun. In a word...it was DELICIOUS! I also liked the healthy portions of basil and sprouts that came out with it. Too bad they don't cater to vegetarian diets more.,UNK
3080,"Food was ok and service was great.  Definitely overpriced.  I am checking off this restaurant from my list of been-there, done-that places.\n\nThe bento box for dessert was the only thing memorable.",UNK
3081,"Fabric is priced cheap but you have to inspect it for imperfections/stains. I get frustrated with how messy it is. Also don't like that there is no restrooms, I have to take my kid cross the street.",UNK
3082,"Great sushi.  I've been coming here for the past 5 years.  Their service can be a little slow at times, especially weekend nights.  However the rolls & sushimi are top notch.",UNK
3083,"The server was not friendly at all, the manager was rude when I asked him Bout the turkey dinner. I had ordered the turkey dinner the turkey was processed the manager insisted it was not however i know the taste of processed turkey as I had bought it from the grocery store... Definitely not worth the money!!!!!",UNK
3084,These people are the rudest ever! My publicist calls to make an appointment. The guy on the other end does not give him any info in regards to Management contacts or email to send him info. Wow..... It takes 2 seconds to be kind..... Definitely not promoting my book there.,UNK
3085,"I just did not have a great experience.  I didn't like the flavor of the hot dog (good snap, though) or chili.  The onion rings were pretty good.  The prices were crazy-high.",UNK
3086,"Nice little Japanese restaurant. Has a good selection of sushi, sashimi, noodle dishes and drinks (full bar!).  It is not top notch sushi, but fair quality and very tasty. Dinner for four with a drink ran me about $60.  Not too shabby.",UNK
3087,"My husband and I went for what we were told was a \""traditional Thanksgiving dinner\"" the food was awful, service was not welcoming.  I would not recommend this resturant for food!",UNK
3088,"3 visit - first 2 were great / last visit, 3 plates had to be returned ---cold food / might be new cooks / mgmt. did take care of issue . . . .will return . . . .for better results . . .",UNK
3089,Aloo Gobi on the mild side real good flavor &  the chicken Tikka masala I asked to be on the mild side was very good will be coming back!,UNK
3090,"I like inventive and new dining experiences.\n\nWhile Aureole did surprise me with some new and inventive dishes, it just feel short of being spectacular. I expected this restaurant to deliver much more. \n\nService is great but food is so-so.",UNK
3091,"Good sushi.\n\nWe go there once in a while.  What I don't like is once the kitchen is quiet, the chef goes in the back door of the restaurant to have a smoke or two and the fumes gets in the restaurant....therefore like a smoking area.",UNK
3092,"Thank you for creating such a relaxing environment. \nThe whole staff was so friendly and helpful and the massage was just wonderful. When I come back to Montreal, I will definitely be back here. Thank you so much.",UNK
3093,"The best! if your in the area, you got to stop by carolina's. you won't be disappointed in any of the food! definitely a fast reliable, and reasonable place to regularly go to",UNK
3094,"The best buffet in Las Vegas, and the rest of the buffets in the state, excellent selection of high quality foods, I recommend it to you any time you're in Vegas.",UNK
3095,"This place is useless as a car wash. Got the car washed on a Monday when they weren't even busy. The back window was in no way washed and the front dashboard, whatever their armor all product was, they only took it down 3/4 of the dash.",UNK
3096,It has been too long since I was here.   I no longer live in the neighborhood.  I really like the food here.  Quite a large selection.  I have only tried the Vietnamese food there but the Chinese food looks good too.,UNK
3097,"As the saying goes, \""You can never go wrong with a W.\"" I don't know if that's truly a saying, but it should be.  It's very trendy with lots of beautiful people and a good representation of the W brand.",UNK
3098,"I wanted to like this place because of the convenient location, but I found the yogurt to be too icy and lacking flavor. It was a perfect weather night but I had to endure blaring radio ads while I sat on their sidewalk. Not the right place for middle aged adults.",UNK
3099,Brad was the best server ever! ****We are from SF California and were not expecting an exceptional server on a Thursday night in LAS VEGAS. He went above and beyond our expectations. Not only did he cater to our specific needs but maintained an upbeat spirit throughout the process. Thank you BRAD! You rocked!,UNK

3103,"Went here on a Sat. night week after opening.  Place was jammed and packed.  Sat at the bar for about 20 minutes and was never even approached by a bartender.  Was going to have a few beers and order some food, but that never happened.  So I just left.  Maybe I will try again on a slow night.",UNK
3104,Amazing food!!! Cooked fresh. Little hole in the wall style. I go several times a month. You will not be disappointed.,UNK
3105,Way over priced for the quality and taste of the food. I'm happy to pay a lot of money for any exceptional meal but our anniversary dinner was mediocre at best. The service was so-so too. Luckily we were able to sit were we could watch the Bellagio fountains.,UNK

3108,"Great for the drive-thru, bad for finding a place to study during times when one would think they would be busy (i.e. 2 pm on a weekday). If you sit there for long enough you will also reek of coffee when you leave.\n\nAt least during the summer they have outdoor seating.",UNK
3109,"Chipotle is dependable. I can always count on them to give me a great, delicious and fulfilling meal at a good price.",UNK
3110,the owner is kind and sweet just like her store. amazing art in the back the clothes and vintage handmade items are rare definitely  give this place a shot if not just a simple walk in to feel what the place is about support LOCAL businesses..,UNK

3112,Steak was ok...Double-Baked Potato with Truffle Cream was wonderful. \n\nOur waiter was nice and bought truffles out to us to show how it looked liked.  He also brought us ice cream sandwiches that I loved.,UNK
3113,"Only tried the walk up frozen drink part, but she made them strong and refill prices were very fair. It got me drunk since I was tired of drinking beers so girly frozen drinks hit the spot. I would return.",UNK
3114,The hostesses are great! So is a busser named Pablo. But when you go ask to not have Danielle as a server. She is a bitch & sassy for no reason.,UNK
3115,Let's say all the hype of the line is not worth the food and the small atmosphere as well as the cramped seating area it is not worth the time at all. Save the money and go somewhere else,UNK
3116,"For 30 bucks a month, this is a pretty rad spot. I've climbed all over the US and Canada, but I'm happy to call this my home gym.",UNK
3117,"Hip but not pretentious. Amazing eggs no matter how you like them.  Creative cuisine.  Huge portions.  No extras for baguette bread, free coffee refills, fresh fruits and friendly staff.  A bit loud on the w-e but perfect for drowning that ringing in the ears from partying the night before.",UNK
3118,"Good prices, fast service. great option if you're hungry past 10 or want to eat before a movie at Sam's town. Desert menu is really good too. Try and sit by the bar instead of a table so you can take advantage of the happy hour prices on drinks and appetizers",UNK
3119,Disappointed. Went yesterday with my son for the first time. Started in the shoe section. Within a few minutes I had been shoved twice. Wow. Manners people.  I did find a Michael Kors shrug for a great price but I will probably not go back.,UNK
3120,You can skip this place. .too many pretend cowboy wannabees..if you don't look the part they won't dance with you. .you will have more fun across the street at What the Hell bar and grill. ..,UNK
3121,"This place is closed as of September 12'th 2014, sign on the door says they were closed by order of the Nevada courts. ??",UNK
3122,The service was horible and so was the food. I'll never go back to this place. Plain sucks and the are very cheap about the food. I was told I can have anythin on the menu and then told that I can on have 2 peices of mussels,UNK
3123,"Super cute little coffee shop tucked away in Downtown Mesa. Coffee is good and the baked goods are even better. I love how nice the staff is, I definitely felt at home.",UNK
3124,"I have been there several times in the past two months.   Never a regret!!   The service is fast and friendly, and the food is always great.  I have been there for breakfast, lunch and dinner and have tried several menu and daily specials.   This past Saturday's Frittata was especially delicious.   We plan on returning again this week.",UNK
3125,Been here a couple of times and the food's been good each time.  Have had a couple of breakfast entrees and also had the Chicken Sandwich on a wheat bagel that was good.  The service I've received hasn't been very good and the wait staff aren't very friendly.,UNK
3126,"I've been a customer of Ultimate auto works for 15 years, and they have maintained 6 different BMW's for us. I refer every Bimmer owner I know to them, because they are honest, do great work and are great people.  They get the work done correctly and promptly, at a very reasonable cost.",UNK
3127,"The food was good, but the customer service was horrible. Maybe in Thailand you could treat people this way, but we are in the USA. Would of given a two or one but food was good.",UNK
3128,"The food was excellent, and the service was great.  The place was crowded and reservations are a definite must, at least for a Saturday night.  I loved the decor, on a personal note.  I haven't had Italian food this good since Staten Island.",UNK
3129,Omg. Is this really a drive through?  More like a stop and wait and wait and wait. 11 min wait to be precise!  All that wait and the food sucks and was cold.  What exactly did I wait for?  Certainly not for you to cook hot food. Never again.,UNK
3130,My wife and myself have been here a couple times and have not had a bad experience with anything we have ordered.\n\nOverall great food & good atmosphere make for some good Mexican food.\n\nThis is an edit after realizing I reviewed the wrong place and wanted to make sure this review was accurate to the location.,UNK
3131,A house of cheesy wonders.  Well-located and not afraid to offer samples.  We raided the basket of lonely cheese chunks - odds and ends for sale.  The staff arranged them in a cute little box.  It made a great gift for our petsitter.,UNK
3132,Today's meal was fantastic. I had the Kung Pao chicken. The wife had Sweet and Sour chicken. Very fresh and flavorful! We always have a good meal here. \nThe remodel of the dining room is great. \nfour stars!,UNK
3133,Our breakfast buffet was disappointing on a number of levels including the absence of ripe fruit and no Chinese or Italian food. My huevos rancheros suffered from stale tortillas and overcooked eggs.,UNK
3134,"Always come here for the night special. Salmon kama, black sausage, fried rice, spicy tuna, Kalbi sticks, Lisa Lisa role, kamikaze, lasagna roll n top off with tempura ice cream.",UNK
3135,Cost-effective! Nice steak! Strongly Recommend courses. And the waitress is very nice. The smoked salmon is too salty. I can't handle it.,UNK
3136,I don't understand why people rave about this place.  The burgers are so so.  The burgers and fries here taste more of salt than anything else. My gf loves this place but I can't understand why.  I'll eat a whopper any day over this.,UNK
3137,"Its the little things that keep a customer from coming back! Ordered $26.00 worth of carry-out, Asked for a cup of ICE, Her reply was I'll have to charge you for that!   WHAT  \""Go out of Business\"" and I still tipped her $2.00 anyway. This is why",UNK
3138,"Really good Mexican restaurant. Watch portions: they are huge. I had machaca con huevos and it was delicious. They have great freshly squeezed orange juice. Watch for dirty Old Mexicans grabbing waitresses asses. If you stalk it out patiently it will happen. Also, be ready to wait on Saturday mornings.",UNK
3139,Nice and simple but effici\u00ebnt layout. Tons of food and drink options. The only downer are the hopelessly outdated furniture and floor carpeting in the waiting areas..,UNK
3140,"Your typical French fare, which is always delicious. Service was top notch. Only eaten here for breakfast. Had steak frittes and french onion soup. Was delish.",UNK
3141,"Quaint and friendly Brackin's is always a great option for kicking off your evening and/or wrapping it up.  You are sure to meet an interesting character, maybe your next best friend.",UNK
3142,"New favorite dim sum in Phoenix area!!  We even went back at night and had meals off the menu and it was very good as well.  The place is always busy and service is good. Prices are great, too.",UNK
3143,"This place ranks better than most sub places.  It has great flavors. Hot, toasted sub's.  And good prices. \n\nJust wish they would add another soda fountain machine.  Have to stand in line to access the only one, usually behind children that cannot make up their mind and want to play with it.!!",UNK
3144,"Wow this place is gross. Outdated. Dirty. Reminds me of a bad dream. I was on the 10th floor and could still hear the music. I don't know where I will be staying tonight, but it won't be at the 4 queens.",UNK
3145,"I ordered a very yummy salad and even with the restaurant being super busy at lunch, we didn't have to wait long at all.",UNK
3146,This is my top 3 favorite buffet at Vegas... My friend introduce this place to me 4years ago and I have came here more than 20 times ...... Great place with lots of selecting on sushi sashimi and cut roll. Oyster is always good and uni sushi is excellent!,UNK
3147,Amazing! Good quick service. Our waitress  Amanda was especially helpful. Thank you Kings Fish House for pissing us off and making us come here.,UNK
3148,The staff is very nice but compared to other Harris Teeters in Charlotte they literally over price everything from $1-4 extra! Sandwich meat - chicken - eggs- even a Gallon of milk! Just bc were in Btyne doesn't mean to over charge!,UNK
3149,"Hands down the BEST place to be in Scottsdale morning, noon and night! \n\nFlat bread pizza is to die for, the Mediterranean salad is delicious and the wine takes the cake!\n\nI love Olive & Ivy!",UNK
3150,"Terrible service. I went several times as a student at CMU and the employees are clearly unhappy about working there.\n\nOverall, I really grew to hate this place the more I went. The food is way over-priced and the manager doesn't appear to really care about whether customers are happy.",UNK
3151,"Love that we don't have to drive to Asheville anymore to get some of the best Southern food around. Unique flavors, excellent sides, top notch sweet tea, and great service. My only wish was that they allowed reservations for parties smaller than 8",UNK
3152,"ehh,,, the food wasn't that great seemed old and the show was pretty boring... I wouldn't choose to do it again.\n\nbut they did make great drinks!",UNK
3153,"I really am disappointed in this place now. I use to come all the time but now its not as good as it was before. Plus, the waiter gave us an extra sushi we didn't order and charged us for it. Out of 5-Service 2, food quality 1, business flow 3, menu 3, and price 2.",UNK
3154,It looks like this Dickies Store is CLOSED!!!  Not in the Outlets South location any more.  Bummed!,UNK
3155,Had a great time last Thursday!  Very nice service & manager made a point of coming over and checking in. Great food - the ribs were wonderful!  Thank you.,UNK
3156,"Best broth I have tasted in town, the staff was very friendly. I had the combination Pho and it was heaven. This will be my go to spot in town from now on.",UNK
3157,As a retail customer I strictly find the location convenient. For the most part pricing is not compareble with big discounters. Being a small store I know what they have which simplifies things. If something is truly a low price I would get a one to four year supply.,UNK
3158,"Burgers were pretty good, lots of beers on tap and there were tons of TV's!  Came here once for football and once for UFC.  Enjoyed it and I'm sure I'll be back.",UNK
3159,Recently moved here from east coast. First time eating here. We had great service and the food was extremely good. Loved the tortillas and salsa. Could barely finish our meals. Will definitely bring our east coasts guests here when they visit. \nWe will be eating here more and sitting outside as the weather gets warmer.,UNK
3160,Good classic rock house band.  Decent drinks but found it a bit smoky.  It's Vegas though and it's allowed.,UNK
3161,This place cost me $35 for two small sized margarita's (came with the collectable plastic glass). The margarita's were watered down and gave me a headache from all the sugar & salt in them. Out of all the margarita's I have downed in the last few years this was the worst.,UNK
3162,Ok place but I think it's more geared to teens and adults. Not that great for kids. The games they have are also privately owned so if the machine eats your money than not their responsibility to refund you. The snacks are ok but really would sugest to eat else where.,UNK
3163,I had a blast. This was my first yelp event. I will think twice before missing another one.  It was well organized.  The food was awesome.  And the music was phenomenal.,UNK
3164,"Gorgeous place.. As far as the shopping, it overwhelmed me.. I'm more of a small boutique type of person. But I did love the H&M there, huge and clean! I love the artwork and could not keep my eyes off them.",UNK
3165,Kim did a great job!  I found my new nail salon in Arizona.  She was very polite and told me about some things in the area since I was new here.  Thanks Kim!,UNK
3166,"I was always a fan of Carrabba's, but lately the food is so disappointing.  Much much to salty, and I love salt.  The food has been over cooked and not properly cooked either.  The wait staff has been great, too bad the kitchen cannot keep up.",UNK
3167,"This little corner place is terrific--manages to be hip and homey at the same time. The soups, salads, smoothies are fresh and tasty, and the owners and staff are warm and friendly. Highly recommended.",UNK
3168,The remodel is on point. Favorite hotel by far. Loved the staff and that free cookie was the bees knees. I can't wait to stay again.,UNK
3169,"Dr Gamett is the best Chiropractor.  I've been seeing him for over a year and I look forward each appointment, as he is the only chiropractor that has been able to adjust my neck.  Dr Gamett has a wonderful staff and I  highly recommend him, knowing he is \""THE BEST\""!",UNK
3170,We love it here. Staff is friendly and food is good. The pesto pasta with sausage is very delicious. Portions are big so bring your appetite.,UNK
3171,"Got sick 3 times. Should have learned the first....maybe the second time but was hoping it was an isolated incident, maybe just me.....as much as I used to love this place Im not risking that again. Dont know what happened and can only speculate....",UNK
3172,"I've only had the sushi at Enso and it is very good. Interesting rolls and everything seems fresh. The service is good, but rushed. Late night is a little too hip for me but not a big deal.",UNK
3173,"Delicious Cuban food and great salsa music. If you are looking for a Latin night when visiting Las Vegas, call them, it's great. Nice place and friendly people.",UNK
3174,"It's not a good sign when you're looking at your watch during the performance. I must admit I enjoyed the inverted stage scene, but that was the only part that kept my interest.   I wouldn't pay full price.",UNK
3175,"short menu, which is cool if ya want a burger or brat and a brew. Thought the brat was good and the beer cold. YOUNG crowd, thought the female bartender was a bit rude that being said had a good time watching the Bama / LSU game.",UNK
3176,"The owner at N9ne Steakhouse walked the whole gang into Rain. Thanks for hooking it up. Rain was as spacious as I remembered it. I am not really into the trance scene, so we bounced after 20 mins.",UNK
3177,"Quest is a niche little drug testing office.  Recently went to get tested for a new job.  It's not exactly the easiest place to find, however, the staff was nice and very fast.  If you have the opportunity between this place or another Quest location I strongly recommend you try them out.",UNK
3178,"As expected, it's 4 floors of M&M's merchandise.  Fun for families, I'm sure. YAWN for a group of adult women. The place smells good.",UNK
3179,Excellent and friendly service and best breakfast burrito and salsa ever. Humongous. Nice atmosphere too. Love this place.,UNK
3180,It not to crowded which is great though it is a little dirty & the parking lot sucks! \n\nFor a Harkins I did expect more out of the theater than what they provided.  In the end it does the job & I can still watch movies in somewhat of a comfort.,UNK
3181,I loved their fresh OJ. They top it off with a bit of regular OJ and it gives it the best flavor. \nMy bf and I had the regular poutine and it wasn't anything out of the ordinary but it was still pretty tasty.,UNK
3182,"It's comparable to all other local bars, but gave 3 stars because it isn't as popular. Less people, less energy.",UNK
3183,"Banana toasted coconut pancake are pretty much the only reason to get out of bed on Sunday. Add to this the fact that Merchant doesn't have a Sunday brunch, this really is the only reason to be on that block.",UNK
3184,My wife got a bannana mocha and she really didnt like it but she did finish it over the 5 hour drive home.,UNK
3185,"Meh. Service is decent. Food selection is mediocre. Food is okay. This place is pricey, hence the two star rating. Actually, this place is not worth the money in all honesty. That being said, it's open late, choices are rather limited",UNK
3186,Have had several great burgers here and the wine list is amazing however the reds by the glass are too warm. Visited this week and not only were the burgers sub-standard the server added $1 tip to BOTH our checks and after almost 24 hours they are not responding to email complaint.,UNK
3187,"fantastic, unique clothes are overshadowed by the snotty attitudes of the staff (not Carine or Randall).  Shopped there for the last time yesterday.  Not worth it.  Will spend my time and money at Elan or Mina's.",UNK
3188,Tried to have dimmer here. 5:12 and still closed. No note or sign for explanation.  Unfortunate because I would have enjoyed trying it!,UNK
3189,"i'd rather go to amado's!\n\nthe only thing that's good here is the bean dip, and i'm only saying that so that i have something nice to say.",UNK
3190,"Generic subway. Fresh ingredients, quick-ish service. Nothing that special. The sandwich artists seem miserable and not terribly friendly but when you're in a rush and need a five dollar foot long this is a great place to get a mediocre sandwich.",UNK
3191,"This restaurant is a master of understatement. From the outside and Upon entering, it doesn't look like much. \nAs it should be, the truth is in the food  food....best beef and broccoli I've ever had.  We are regulars now.  Simply outstanding",UNK
3192,"Slowest service ever, sitting in drive through for ten minutes now :( \n\nNot very good, drink was watery...",UNK
3193,"Fast service and consistent Starbucks taste but the exterior needs some work and not too pleased with some of the people who hang out in the parking lot so best to go in, get your drink, and leave.  Not a location I'd spend any time hanging out at.",UNK
3194,Coffe and donuts are good but avoid going in at all costs. Drive thru is main concern and you will wait a considerable amount if time as cars fly through!,UNK
3195,"Our experience today was very disappointing.   The server was so disinterested in her job it was more than apparent.   The food was cold, and the \""brisket\"" was burned...  so disappointed. .",UNK
3196,Seriously WAY to expensive for fast food. I could eat a Chilis 2 for 20. Seriously $25 for three sandwiches. Get a grip!!! And it wasnt even that good.,UNK
3197,"If I were 20 years younger and single, i probably would have had a better time. But I loved the music and eye candy! Staff wasn't all that. International crowd, apparently the dollar is weak and they all come to Vegas.",UNK
3198,"No service. No rating. Ignored three separate times 10 minutes after I sat down. I travel out of Terminal C once a week. Now, folks who came in after me served fine.  Maybe I looked like a poor tipper......  Although I'm thirsty and hungry, willl not bother with this joint again.",UNK
3199,Chris was terrific..hostess beautiful and skilled as quickly recognized I did care for the table and chairs me another. ise roll definitely recommended..miso soup was just good enough...\n\nAmbiance is good deep inside ..not on the outside...prices: consistent w vegas,UNK
3200,The food was at best mediocre and the service was slow even though it was completely empty.  Not recommended.  Masala Bay on Regina and Erb has much better Indian food.,UNK
3201,"I have seen several Cirque shows, and was excited to Ka.  I had high expectations, and Ka exceeded them! The wall used during the show was the most amazing thing I've seen in a Cirque show - very cool! As always, the performances music are fantastic- loved it!!!!",UNK
3202,Overpriced Chinese food that you could honestly get better quality stuff at your average takeout. I'm kind of confused why they think since its in Golden Nugget they can charge the prices. Whatever- never again!,UNK
3203,"Taste not good, only few selection, there are plenty asian buffet with more tasteful at similar price or cheaper price.... Many people come here with their tour package...",UNK
3204,Sat over 20 mins waiting for a server. It was slow at 2:30p and they had 2 servers. Asked the manager what was up with the long wait and we were told we hadn't been waiting long. He was rude and we decided to leave based on his response.,UNK
3205,This place is Closed as of November 28 or something.   Upsetting BC of the drive to get down here and paid for parking.  Fuck...,UNK
3206,Great bang for the buck.. all you can eat fresh sushi and yummy rolls for less than $25. What could be better than that?,UNK
3207,"I danced on a pole and now my friends have incriminating pictures of me.\n\nOther than that, beeeeautiful venu and fun fun times.",UNK
3208,This place doesn't even deserve any stars. The manager that owns this place is a total asshole and talks shit about his customers. Not worth giving them money to keep them in business.,UNK
3209,Had the pulled pork and Mac/cheese. Very yummy. \n\nStrawberry lemonade very tasty too. Nice decor/ambiance and very friendly service.\n\nMy first official food consumed in Arizona - it was a fine choice!!!\n\nI'll be back!,UNK
3210,I dropped off three jackets to get them ready for the cooler weather ahead. They did a good job and the jackets were ready the next day. I will definately use them again.,UNK
3211,It's okay. I know it's not the freshest but it's chewy at times and I do mean the seaweed around the rolls.,UNK
3212,"I received a $50 Groupon from a friend for this place and I was hoping for it to be good but I feel like if we hadn't had the Groupon, I wouldn't have eaten here since the prices were high and the food wasn't that great. I most likely won't eat here again.",UNK
3213,Good authentic Mexican food. I was a little worried when I pulled up because of how small the place is but it was good. Thank you Yelp for leading me here.,UNK
3214,"So cute. The food is phenomenal, great meeting or planning space. Huge menu. Significantly better than Panera or Paradise Bakery.",UNK
3215,"Been going there for years.  If you can find someone else I say go there, horrible office staff no one gets back to you on tests results.  Will hope to find someone new in 2012.  Waiting time is terrible usually an hour and half no matter what time I get there.  Looking for someone on the southwest  \n\nLaura",UNK
3216,"Its my local gym, its not usually too crowded, could be cleaner. $30 a month works for me. There is a lap pool, basketball court, and all other standard gym stuff.",UNK
3217,"Update and bad news: BEDBUGS! I was all bitten after coming home. Called them and they were very unapologetic, saying \""oh, there is bedbugs in all of Montreal!\""",UNK
3218,"The food is ok for 1am food. I've had better but it is definitely edible.\n\nHowever I waited over 30 minutes despite nudging twice to pay. They are massively understaffed, at least at night.",UNK
3219,"I like this place mainly for 2 reasons:\n\n1. Aweosme view of the strip\n2. Good, laidback lounge feel with a bit of a club atmosphere\n\nIf you need a break from the big clubs but still want a nice, fun place (not ghetto) go here.",UNK
3220,Absolutely best Mexican in Charlotte! The service was prompt. The margarita was amazing! Best wings in Charlotte! The area are large and price is fair. Absolutely love the deck atmosphere. Must eat here frequently!,UNK
3221,We loved our experience here! I haven't eaten Momos in ages! Thank you so much Prakash for the delicious food and beautiful hospitality!,UNK
3222,Spend a little more and take a taxi. Just rude. Tried to tell us that even though we paid for hotel pick up that we had to walk 3 hotels away. We knew more about the events going on than they did. No accountability.,UNK
3223,"I've purchased a basket several times and it's kind of hit-or-miss. However, the 9-grain bread is absolutely delicious. I always leave 1-2 loaves out and throw the rest in the freezer (no preservatives, so it will go bad quickly).",UNK
3224,I have had the avocado smoothie here twice ... It is very healthy and tastes out of the world. Must try ...,UNK
3225,"I've dined here twice now - excellent food, great service and it seems to offer a menu that isn't common in Charlotte.  I will definitely be a repeat customer and recommend to friends.",UNK
3226,"What a horrible horrible place. They make you wait in line when nobody is inside the bar. Meanwhile, they let dozens of people in the front with no issue. They're trying to be LA or Vegas. Complete failure.",UNK
3227,Super expensive and not necessarily Fair Trade!  A dirty chai will set you back about $5 for a 12 oz. mug and their baked goods resemble Costco or some other cheap amalgamation of mass produced croissants.  I used to study here in the winter but I'll take the extra bike ride down to Indie or Barriques.,UNK
3228,"I've been a few times.  The table top grilling is fun, but things are kind of expensive for what you get.  I still miss 56 East.",UNK
3229,"I was very pleasantly surprised at how nice this pub is. It's roomy, the seating is set out nice for relaxing and chatting. Relaxed atmosphere with a mixed crowd in it. Leith prices with an uptown feel. The bar staff were excellent, polite and attentive. I would definitely go back.",UNK
3230,"Pizza is so-so, good hang out place just next door. Weird service.\n\nWent there today, had pear and walnut salad, that was good! The Lime Chicken sandwich was ok.",UNK
3231,"Overpriced, and not that great.  This restaurant is located in the lobby of the hotel and is therefore very busy and loud. The service was average and my food was too salty (had the fish and chips).  The portion sizes are large which is a plus.",UNK
3232,These people are amazing! I consider myself a difficult customer and they always go above and beyond. I always leave happy! They are especially helpful about scheduling they are so accommodating. This is my third time here and ingot Christmas nails. So cute! I always go to Mimi! Such a sweetheart.,UNK
3233,"Customer service was pretty bad. Staff was too loud to make an order and the food was sub par. I was hoping for a nice fresh lunch and was very disappointed. The lettuce was brown, patties were rubbery and cold. .",UNK
3234,"We made a trip from the other end of the strip to go here, but guess what?  Sat and sat in the bar and couldn't get waited on!  We finally just left.  How many other customers and how much money are they losing because of poor service?",UNK
3235,"Four stalls in the ladies' room and two had out-of-order signs on them, one had a shower curtain in place of a door, and the one remaining in working order with a door had no t.p. at 8:00 pm.",UNK
3236,"If you have the money and want to spend it on a great steak dinner, this challenges any steakhouse I've been in.   Enjoy the great scotches, steaks, and atmosphere.   Just a fun place for good food and elegant surrounding.",UNK

3239,"I have been going here for many years, and every time I go it's a great personable experience. When you go to most salons there is always one person (nail tech) you prefer, but at this salon they're all amazing.",UNK
3240,Nice room very clean and big the food I had breakfast the food was not very good \nStarbucks was over priced the pool was great,UNK
3241,"What a disappointment. $9 for 10 dumplings and they were barely lukewarm. Not to mention skins practically as thick as the filling. Honestly, you'd be better off buying frozen dumplings from Asian Midway Foods on Park Street or the Garden Asian Market in Middleton and cooking them yourself.",UNK
3242,"Third visit. Good food. Cllean. Staff polite and efficient   food quite good, economical and filling on all occasions.  Exceptional soup and sandwich shop and the no extra charge soft serve ice cream is a bonus.",UNK
3243,"Weirdest veggie burger ever, also frozen fries for $5 yuck! To top it off $7 for a Bass that's more expensive than Boston!! \n\nSkip this place!",UNK
3244,"Our first time there, and it was really good! We tried all 6 varieties of the bruschetta, and loved them all. Also split their chicken pot pie. The crust was delicious! Filling was good, although not much chicken inside; lots of good gravy and veggies.\nWe will definitely be back!",UNK
3245,Worst car wash I ever got. The inside of my car is still dirty and dusty doesn't even look like I got a car wash. Should of gone to octopus what a waste of 20 dollars,UNK
3246,Stayed at the Wynn for 4 days and came here 4 days in a row. Don't know why my parents like this place so much. Maybe its convenient? I think its way too overpriced. \n\nAlso probably had the worst milk tea here. Boba was hard and the tea was watery.,UNK
3247,I should have gotten a discount for the $3.19 for a bottle of water since I waited for the young staff of five behind the counter to stop talking smack about their so-called friends before I was acknowledged. Just passing through...,UNK
3248,Service staff was a mess. Food presentation was poor. Food quality was poor - B.A.L.T. was soggy and oozing all over.,UNK
3249,This place is a dump and the only good thing in there is the carve steakhouse. The buffet is disgusting and nasty. The clientele are lowlifes. The staff is terrible and so is the gaming. Avoid this place!!,UNK
3250,AWESOME BREAKFAST AND GREAT PRICE!!!  Every dishes that came out was  huge. Make sure to don't over order and always share. If you want more you can always order again.,UNK
3251,Went for breakfest and as soon as we walked in the place had a foul odor.. The food was cold and disgusting.. The food I had at the hospital was better than this buffet... will never go back even if they offered me to go in for free!,UNK
3252,Did not make me want to go to Indonesia.\nSorry this is so brief but there was nothing extraordinary about any part of our meal.\nService was so so.\nProbably will not return.\nVery pricey.,UNK
3253,The worst place I've ever ate the manager be Littles the employees why you're trying to eat thank God there's an in and out burger right across the street,UNK
3254,"This restaurant is amazing.  The food is excellent as well as the service. The wait staff was very friendly and we didn't have to ask for anything.   The Chef  Damon came to our table and made sure that everything was made to perfection,   I highly suggest eating here if you visit or live in Las Vegas.",UNK
3255,"The one thing I always get at this place are the shrimp tacos!! they're the bomb!! Soooo good! I was a bit skeptic about shrimp and tortilla together, but oh boy were they good! Ths the inky thing i've tried in here and I always go back for more!!!",UNK
3256,"Not the absolute best Italian food, but pretty darn good. My favorites are garlic cheese knots, pizza, and pasta dishes! The Hero's are not so good though. All the dishes are huge -- definitely big enough to share! Great take out food!",UNK
3257,"The sushi is great! Not expensive & good quality.  My favorite rolles are the Vegas, Dragon, and the baked scallops :)",UNK
3258,"Hidden gem! Great location, ambiance and food. Prices are very reasonable. I was disappointed to find not very many guests there this Sunday afternoon. Folks must not realize what they are missing...but we will be back , perhaps to enjoy a view of the Strip at night :)",UNK
3259,"Way overpriced, stay away during breakfast. Omelets are $11-$14 and they come with no bread or potatoes (which add for $2 each).\nFood was good but we found the same quality for half the price at other nearby places.",UNK
3260,Love their spaghetti & meat balls ! Their four cheese raviole is also good. I also tried their Philly cheesesteak. All good!,UNK
3261,I got the slow roasted jerk chicken (yes I know at the fish market!) and it was very very good.  For dessert I split the 'doughnut' with ice cream which was very tasty.,UNK
3262,Food was tasty but the service sux!  I visited @ 3pm on a tuesday ... My server was also handling host ane bartender duties.  Long long long long wait for condiments and extra biscuits.  Tick tick tick down went the tip!  Service is poor to say the least,UNK
3263,"We lived in our house for 2 years and it was time to get our carpet clean, especially having two dogs.Roman did a fabulous job.He was very professional, efficient and fast. Our carpets look like brand new. We definitely will use his services again. I am very happy with the result. Thank you, Roman!",UNK
3264,"Have eaten there twice now. Lunch took over an hour to be served food. Breakfast this weekend was fast, but the omelets were dry, as if they were precooked, microwaved or reheated. Clean patio upstairs, just poor food.",UNK
3265,"Stayed here 3 weeks ago for nieces graduation with entire family 15 people,  3 rooms. Had a great time with their pool and onsite activities. Mini golf, basketball tennis and a good number of smaller pools that are right outside each set of rooms.",UNK
3266,"Reading some of the other reviews, I feel like I must have eaten at a different restaurant. I order two spicy tuna rolls with brown rice. Both had zero flavor and could have been molded from Elmer's paste instead of fish. \n\nMaybe I ordered the wrong thing. Seems like a good concept.",UNK
3267,Heres my tip...dont order the philly sandwich.  The ratio of chicken filling to the bread was like 10% and the bread 90%  and they should be ashamed to even call it a philly cause they used cheddar sliced cheese.,UNK
3268,Sen is some of the best sushi I've had in Las Vegas. I highly recommend the spicy edamame too!,UNK
3269,"Came for dinner with a party of 12. Lots of mistakes in getting our order right. Pizzas showed up 10 minutes after the other entrees. To top it off, the pizzas weren't good,  unless you like room temperature nearly liquid cheese. Frozen pizza is better.\n\nI won't be coming back.",UNK
3270,"A disaster!! Limited unattractive items on the menu... Don't even lose any time going there! They have an identity crisis: are they upscale or not? Service was good, so was the music!",UNK
3271,"Great, great coffee. I haven't tried the crepes but from what I've heard they are good. My hesitancy with giving it 4 or 5 stars is the cleanliness or lack there of. I like the local charm , but the owner should look to spruce things up  bit",UNK
3272,First time here and already off to a bad start. 5 min without any greeting from anyone. No hostess up in front and I believe only one guy runnin the whole show. The food is what pretty much saved this review. The food was good but service and experience is also the big part of a restaurant,UNK
3273,Amazing food! Super fresh and incredibly welcoming staff. Sheila was our waitress and one of the best I've ever had in my lifetime. Every single item we ordered was absolutely delicious.  Will definitely come back again soon!,UNK
3274,"This is my favorite restaurant at Tempe in Phoenix. Baked potatoe is a must. For a medium rare meat, New york stake will made your day. Place is  cozy. Very elegants waitresses.",UNK
3275,"I LOVE Arizona Avenue Animal Clinic!!!!  I have boarded, groomed, and seen doctors there.  My dogs are both difficult to handle and Dr. Kristi loves them anyway!! I will NEVER EVER use another vet.  I LOVE THEM!!!!!!",UNK
3276,"Ok, I have tried this place one too many time with same bad result.\nFOOD good.\nSERVICE slow.\nSEATING break your wide hips uncomfortable\nGet booth and have plenty of time.",UNK
3277,"Spent more than I would have liked, but the service wasn't bad at all. Quite friendly and accommodating. Although I'm no sushi-connoisseur, I ordered a couple rolls of sushi and thought they were both delicious.",UNK
3278,They are the best!! They are all nice and courteous. Their prices are better than H&M and Allied flooring and they always have what you are looking for. Try them!,UNK
3279,"Great little barber shop, I've been to the flashy flat screen on every chair type of place but found I keep coming back to Beasley's. The  classic barber shop chairs and straight razor shaves remind you of what a barber shop should be.",UNK
3280,GROSS. i will NEVER EVER come back here again!! go back to Hometown Buffet people seriously & i don't even like Hometown that much!,UNK
3281,Ambiance is wonderful for weekend brunch. There's plenty of outdoor patio seating fully equipped with umbrellas that catch rain and heaters / fans. Unfortunately the food was nothing to write home about. It was okay but nothing great compared to all the wonderful choices in Montreal. Come here for drinks and the ambiance.,UNK
3282,"Very pleasant place with an amazing appeal. The service was fantastic, food was quality, and again the patio on a beautiful March day was perfect. Will have to come back for dinner sometime.",UNK
3283,"Closed. The food must have been great.... no... couldn't have been... they are CLOSED! That's French for \""the food sucked!\""",UNK
3284,I was delightfully surprised by the southern comfort food and hospitality. I especially devoured the BBQ pork chop. The staff is friendly and foodie savvy. Get extra napkins... Or just lick your fingers. It's that delicious. Seriously addictive!,UNK
3285,Cheap. Totally get what you pay for. Buffet was your standard cheap buffet. And it's definitely in the ghetto.,UNK
3286,Everytime I go here I'm impressed by the students! I've had Mindy (who recently graduated) and Tatum and both were excellent and did an outstanding job on my haircut! During holidays men's cuts range from $5-10!,UNK
3287,"My friend and I came here for St. Paddy's Day, and we thought it was nicely-appointed decor-wise and that the bartenders were nice, but I thought the corned beef we had was disgusting and too fatty. \""Not much to write home about\"" is what I'm thinking.",UNK
3288,"Wow; what a great Italian place off the strip!  Fantastic food, great entertainment; very fun! The bread and cannoli's are to die for. You must check this place out!",UNK
3289,Went up there in the evening one night for drinks only... The view is amazing but after that nothing too great about it.  Very comparable to Ghost Bar.,UNK
3290,One of my all time favorite restaurants but today's delivery girl was a little ray of sunshine! Such a refreshing change from most delivery people! Thank you spinatos for being a cut Above!,UNK
3291,Great! Staff at the bar is super friendly. Went for lunch and there were LOTS of options. I love different kinds of cuisine was organized and the food just kept on coming! It was also GOOD. So that's always nice :),UNK
3292,The best sushi in Phoenix.  My favorite this side of town. Very clean. Lots of space. User friendly. Clean restrooms.,UNK
3293,Great service. They really worked with my husband to create a one-of-a-kind gift for his siblings. They turned out great and were such high quality.\n\nHighly recommend!,UNK
3294,"Not nearly as good as chipotle. The vegetables were not fresh, salsa was mediocre. Guacamole was blackened due to age, lousy iced tea . Big disappointment.",UNK
3295,Can't beat the 99 cent Bloody Mary's in the morning. We had a super bar tender that made ours extra spicy. The mexican breakfast was delicious.,UNK
3296,"Why was I charged $12 for a bowl of soup at lunch time even if there is it 1 dollar sign for affordability? It was great soup,  but I haven't back since.",UNK
3297,"Worst Poutine i've had  in a long time.  If you are a poutine noob, don't go there.  1st, it is a tourist trap.  2nd, they are using the wrong kind of cheese.  Go to La Banquise.  Do yourself a favor",UNK
3298,I have to say the food is really delicious!  but a bit pricey on the seafood for my taste. I love the atmosphere service is great I will be coming back!,UNK
3299,"This place is off the hook good!  We've visited many times and every single time, everything we order is awesome.  Their soups are great, the salads are awesome.  Pad Thai noodle is perfect, curries are great.  This is one excellent place to visit if you are craving good thai food in Vegas.",UNK
3300,I always drive to this UPS store. The 2 guys always working (one was named josh) are so nice and helpful every time I come in the store. They are quick and I am right in and out the store with no worries. They get my packages delivered on time and provide peace of mind. Go to them !,UNK
3301,I don't normally write reviews but this place is awesome! I broken screen last night on my iPhone and thought it was going to cost me $200 to get it replaced at the Apple store. Instead I kept googling and found this place. $100 and 10 minutes later it's good as new! Thank you for saving me $100!,UNK
3302,"I had the chicken and biscuit with eggs. The chicken was dry, service was without a smile and the prices were high.  You basically pay for large portions without a lot flavor. I also felt guilty eating here because of the all that waste this restaurant produces.",UNK
3303,I love this place a lot. I always try and come here whenever I am in the area. The machaca is awesome and the tortillas are amazing.  I haven't found anything on the menu I didn't enjoy.,UNK
3304,"Came here looking for specific tires for a NSX, and they got them quick for me. I had them install it, and when I drove the car with the new tires it drove like a exotic car. They were probably the only company that could get me the tires as quick as they did. Thanks again tire works.",UNK
3305,"Horrible music they play 20 seconds of a crappy song and then play 20 seconds of another crappy song...my first time it was lame and since I was staying at the luxor decided to give it another try, but was lame again!",UNK
3306,"I went with my servers choice while visiting this restaurant, I ended up having the soy salmon. It was definitely a great choice and was delicious to the last bite but was kind of on the expensive side. The interior of this restaurant is gorgeous, the staff was a little bit on the slow side though.",UNK
3307,Excellent care and service!\nHighly recommend this place and the staff!\nI have been coming here for 10 + years.,UNK
3308,Still fantastic buffet!  They have a great way of blending the spices & food was delicious. They now serve Mango Lassi which is a perfect addition to the palate. Good service & comfortable surroundings. The food is excellent!,UNK
3309,"The drive through customer service at Chase Bank in Aliante Parkway is horrible. BEWARE do not utilize the drive through around 5:00pm they do not acknowledge you and when they do they act as if you are bothering them! Horrible drive through service. However, great personal bankers....",UNK
3310,"I went to this Starbucks because I had time to kill before meeting a client nearby. I don't like this as much as the other Starbucks because there's no drive thru, so you have to walk into Albertsons and the ones located in a grocery store usually don't use the phone app (not convenient).",UNK
3311,My 11 year old son took part in 'Kids fun run'. Everything was organized very well. He loved the experience and is all hooked up for his next runs. He loved the medal too.,UNK
3312,Go yard or go home! The strawberry and mango flavor is refreshing. I usually like pina coladas but the miami vice didn't have the same kick of the strawberry and mango. If you could put fun in a bottle...it would come in a yard size.,UNK
3313,"Amazing food, service and management. \nBest place downtown to grab a pint and a bite. Will come back for sure!",UNK
3314,"With a name like theirs, the pulled pork sandwich is the more-than-obvious choice. I got mine outside the Just for Laughs festival, and it was really, really good. Nice portion size and very tasty. My only problem is that I want another one - but first I have to check out the food truck competition..",UNK
3315,This was a fantastic show that displayed not only thier talent but thier ability to entertain with a positive message. Would recommend for sure.,UNK
3316,"Such a bad place... hella msg, bad service, everthing was self but charged 18% wth????",UNK
3317,I live behind this complex. If you are considering moving and looking for a quiet place keep looking.  The traffic in the parking lot is a combination of cars without mufflers and Harleys. The noise goes on all hours of the night.  Even atv races in the parking lot. Trailers parked in the back.  Management must not be concerned.,UNK
3318,"Nice place, but in a professional environment I don't really want to see employees who wear their pants below their ass. I won't be going back there.",UNK
3319,"The \""Dillo\"" is where it's at if you want a good meal and drink.  Plenty of TVs for sports and horse racing if that is your thing.  Excellent sports bar, friendly staff, good food, and did I mention the drinks?",UNK
3320,My 6 and 3 year old love this place!  They are excited to go and sad to leave.  I never have to worry about last minute daycare.  The staff is also great!  I like buying the minutes in bulk for a great deal!,UNK
3321,"It's a good, honest burger.  I don't have much beyond that.  The place has a very un-corporate atmosphere.  Not retro for the sake of fooling you into thinking it's retro.  Just classic, all on its own.",UNK
3322,The flavor was pretty bland and excruciatingly dry. The sushi tasted off. The one good thing is the dessert counter.  Mini doughnuts had me at hello.,UNK
3323,"Pretty good, I really liked the chicken salad, a lot if flavor, but the service isn't too great. They aren't that friendly, but the service isn't too great.",UNK
3324,"Service sucks, way to overpriced, and food honestly is not that amazing.. I tried it a few times when i stayed at planet hollywood.. And i wasn't to pleased.",UNK
3325,"Sweet temptations (see my review of it.), this is good! Blue gill is awesome. I tried this first a while back in 2011, I think. It lives up to its upscale-casual reputation. Rosemary chicken was good. Come if you get the chance.",UNK
3326,"As a design professional, I work with UBC on a constant basis. They are always able to find me any product that I need and they get it to me at the best price. They are great to work with and extremely helpful. Their mosaic and travertine selection and pricing can't be beat.",UNK
3327,"Yum yum yum!! Love this buffet. I personally loved it because of the amount of seafood they had. We were VIP customers so we had extra comps ;) but other than that really nice buffet, sanitary and delicious! Definitely recommend this place",UNK
3328,"Sorry but a one star is all this place deserves. Overall was not a good experience. Sad to walk out of a place paying for services that you would have rather done yourself. Worst blow out I have ever had, who lets someone leave the salon with partially wet hair??",UNK
3329,"Definitely a value hotel. They even upgraded us to a suite (totally awesome) but the hotel really looked like it could use some solid maintenance. \n\nStill, for the price not bad at all... and do NOT forget to check out the spa!",UNK
3330,"Best Italian I've had in a LONG time. Veal Carciofini was fabulous. Chef Moreno has done a great job. Spinato's, eat your heart out!!",UNK
3331,Many flavors and great choice of toppings\nOnly 39 cents/oz\nStaff was kind and helpful as well\nDefinitely recommend this place for a good yogurt,UNK
3332,Worst service I have ever experienced. It took two hours plus to get my food. The only good thing was that there is no way to get over served. The food once it came was marginal at best.,UNK
3333,"I can't stop coming here. Hands down my favorite place for Pho. I always order the 1b, and 48b. An extra large bowl of pho, and bbq pork spring roll. I would eat here everyday if I could. Friendly place, fantastic food, and very inexpensive.",UNK
3334,"Disappointed. As a sneakerhead I was expecting more heat. All I saw was general releases-no size 14, smh. No urban account or Tier 0 stuff?! Small and disappointing. Love the branding and logo, I own several new era fitteds. If you are looking for serious heat, NOT the place.",UNK
3335,It'd been a while since I'd been here and I was pleased with my return.  I came during happy hour (4-7p) and had several of the $5 apps.  The Stack and the carne adovada quesadilla were great.  The service was good and I look forward to coming back.,UNK
3336,Decent beer selection. Above average barbecue for a restaurant in Pittsburgh. The Rueben Rolls are really good but I wish they gave you more than three. Great outdoor seating area. There isn't anything awful about this place but there is also nothing exceptional.,UNK
3337,Hands down the best fast food burger chain in the world.  In-N-Out always delivers the goods. Tip: Do it animal style.,UNK
3338,The drive thru is supper Dirty and the ppl there are Rude ! They don't even say thanxs or a smile . There are also tons of flys there !!!,UNK
3339,Absolutely awesome on every level. The nicest hotel I've ever stayed at. Can't say enough great things about it. Will be coming back.,UNK
3340,Tourist trap comes to mind.  No one was friendly.  We left within 15 min do not waste your time.  I was truly disappointed.,UNK
3341,they make a decent sandwich for the price.. the bread is excellent.. but it's really not worth coming here if you're sober as there are plenty of better dining options nearby,UNK
3342,"That was the most poorly spent money I have ever given a restaurant. It took two hours to deliver. Once it arrived, the food was cold and soggy. I couldn't eat any of it. I don't think there's any reason for anyone to ever order delivery from here, I should have heeded the warnings.",UNK
3343,"This place is pretty good. I've been here several times ans would visit often if I lived closer. They serve traditional mexican mariscos. The food is fresh, good and the service is pretty good as well!",UNK
3344,My brother and I stumbled into this place randomly and it was amazing fresh pizza. They havr so many toppings and truly let you customize to make it your perfect pie. The pizza was amazing and I plan on going back soon for sure.,UNK
3345,"Tasty fro-yo, nice amount of toppings--they even have coffee in case you get the sleeps after eating too much yogurt. The interior is very clean and well designed (a l\u00e1 Pinkberry). It's a little surprising to find something this nice in the area. Well done!",UNK
3346,Food and service excellence.  MM never disappoints us on our trips to Vegas.  The beet salad was extraordinary.  The foie gras exquisite.  The Ahi tuna steak cooked perfectly.  There is something to be said for a limited menu executed brilliantly and consistently well every time.,UNK
3347,I visited for the very first time and for the very last time today. I left without ordering anything because the owner snapped at me for asking him too many questions. I was only there for a few minutes. The owner needs to learn better customer service skills.,UNK
3348,"Food was good,but seriously I pay $10 for pancake,eggs,and only 2 slice of bacon.not worth $10:(",UNK
3349,Best fries I have had in awhile. Everyone enjoyed their meal and the cocktails were good as well. Loved the lively atmosphere and will be back soon- for sure.,UNK
3350,"Send Gordon Ramsay to this place, it a kitchen night mare!\nNasty food, slow service and cheap decor. So many better all you can eat sushi in MTL.",UNK
3351,"Service was terrible, completely oblivious attitude.  food quality not great, cheap ingredients and you can taste the difference plus they play annoying teenybopper music with douchey clientele",UNK
3352,I have been here three times. One of my favorite pizza joints in Las Vegas. I always get the pepperoni pizza and the calzone. Either the meat lovers or italian calzone. Love this place.,UNK
3353,Come here all the time. Not like the rest of the mexican resturants around i only rely on when im drunk. Quality  food i reccomend. I would eat here everyday if i wouldnt get fat,UNK
3354,"Very authentic mediterranean food. Falafel was outstanding. Gyro sandwiches are very good too and big. Make sure you request the hot sauce that's not on the table made with sweet red peppers and something else that's both sweet and spicy - not real hot but very, very, very tasty.",UNK
3355,Its really good. Bread is soft. Chipotle chicken avocado is bomb. Salad fresh. Great value in vegas,UNK
3356,Just in Vegas for vacation and found the place on Yelp and was pleased with the food and service. I would definitely recommend and come back.,UNK
3357,"i stayed in one of the suites and i can only say good things about my stay! housekeeping was amazing and attentive! concierge actually picked up the phone. i did have a little problem with the valet attendant though, he was extremely rude but i was living in luxury that weekend for me to really let it get to me.",UNK
3358,Cold food again. I live in the neighborhood so I've eaten here many times over the years.  Used to be a great place but the quality of the food and service has really gone down a lot over the last few months. I won't be back.,UNK
3359,"It's an ok casino.  However it is not on the strip, so it will be quieter. Generally will see more locals than tourists here.  Always have seen friendly staff, and food has been good.",UNK
3360,"Food's mediocre (I usually get Pad Thai or Pad Kee Mao and it's not the best obviously, but it's not bad either), but plus 1 star for being sooo cheap and sooo fast and sooo close to everything on campus!",UNK
3361,"Excellent \""fastaurant\"" food, and courteous staff. They bring you your order, and will offer free refills on your fountain drinks. I had a Club Sandwich, a Cheesesteak, and a Turkey Melt, all delicious, and all served with yummy steak fries.",UNK
3362,Do not go here! Douchebag staff lost my credit card and didn't care. Drinks are subpar. DJ plays eighties dance music. Dancer came out once every 45 minutes. Waste of time.,UNK
3363,I had a haircut with Nicole today and it went perfect!!!  I have had long hair for some time now and was a little nervous but she listened to what I wanted and did a wonderful job.  Price is fair for the type of service and expertise that you get.  Thanks Flict and especially Nicole.,UNK
3364,"Great atmosphere me and my boyfriend comes here every now and then..love their music, and it just so comfortable to have a glass of wine at the end of day... and sitting outside enjoying sunset in summer time.. perfect place for small party too!!!",UNK
3365,"Kid friendly and great food items.  They have all the bar regulars plus a nice foodie touch to their menu.  Dishes come out looking great and tasting better.  Wait staff handled special orders easily and cheerfully.  Check this place out, keep it busy, don't let tempe lose a nice local spot!!",UNK
3366,Everyone is so nice and food is amazing. I always crave for the ahi poke and this place is simply the best for satisfying it!,UNK
3367,"It was decent. If I'm in the mood for an Italian beef sandwich (which isn't often), I'd go back.",UNK
3368,Best Happy hour 3-7 Mon-Sat and get the 22oz Kirin and small sake for $7.75. Salmon carpaccio was nice and Vegas roll. Can't go wrong with the tuna Tataki and rainbow roll for $7.75 each during HH.,UNK
3369,"Clean restaurant, great service, great noodles....what more can you ask for from a Noodles & Company?  We enjoyed our meals and would visit again.",UNK
3370,Service effroyable alors que le restaurant \u00e9tait vide! Bouffe ok pour ce genre d'endroit! Prix raisonnable! D\u00e9finitivement tres moyen!,UNK
3371,"This place is unique... the cuisine is similar to Japanese Tapas. Try the bacon wrapped asparagus, beef tongue skewer (trust me), Pork wrapped Gobo, tempura asparagus and some sake bombs. \n\nWhat's even more amazing is the price!",UNK
3372,Been there 2x both times tacos were delicious! Servers need a lil more help getting the drinks out faster but the food is great! Can't wait to go again!,UNK
3373,"Love this place - the food, the ambiance, the SERVICE and the food again! Just perfect. Ask for Devynn if you go! She's fantastic. \n\nThis is an upscale place where you can either dress a little nicer for a great date night or a little more casual.",UNK
3374,Jason is wonderful.  Always makes you feel welcome and is such a great bartender. A very fun place.His strawberry ice teas are the best.,UNK
3375,"OMG I had the stuffed pizza and chicken wings from this place. If crack was in the form of food, this would be it. What more can you expect from the 6 year Zagat rated best pizza joint.",UNK
3376,This place has everything i need.  They have awesome prices that you can't beat and the customer service is top notch.  Ask for Darrel and he will take care of you.  Thanks vapor house will come back again!,UNK
3377,The Chuck Box has fresh and delicious burgers and chicken sandwiches.  They grill  your food right in front of you and they have a great condiment bar so you can get just the right amount of toppings.,UNK
3378,"I just had the best hair cut.  Gena took the time to ask me what I wanted and also gave me suggestions.  I got the best hair wash, and style.  I would recommend Gena to anyone who wants a real pro.  Thanks, JH",UNK
3379,Really nice hotel. I stayed one nite and while they are still getting the kinks out it is a beautiful modern hotel.  The rooms are terrific and the beds are particularly comfortable. I am looking forward to going back!!,UNK
3380,it's an okay starbucks. they didn't accept my card so i wasn't able to take advantage of the discounts.,UNK
3381,"Stayed here on a four day trip, horrible customer service, said our rooms would be ready by two, and they were not.  Rooms were okay. Buffet was gross, bugs on the food. Only positive was the pretty cool circus they had. But I guess that's what you get for the price. Oh well.",UNK
3382,Great food and service. We have been to all of their locations in AZ and we love the chicken parm pizza. A must try!,UNK
3383,"Completely different from what I've read or expected. Experience was weird for us. Vibe was a little off, and the bar area was too crowded. The back where the lounge is was empty and creepy.",UNK
3384,This is our favorite place in Vegas hands down. I have been coming here for 10 years now and it is the only place we party when in Vegas. The band is awesome! The crowds are always fun. I just can't say enough great things about Nine Fine. Anyone who has been a regular knows what I mean!,UNK
3385,"I wish I could give this place 0 stars.  Don't waste your money. This pizza is nasty. I posted a picture of the greasy, disgusting pizza they delivered. It's gross.",UNK
3386,"Every was great, I got a free upgrade. My one gripe is I was charged 2 gallons of gas at $5/gallon. I wish the attendant would've let me know I was off by 2 gallons :(",UNK
3387,Do not go on Sundays. We got Amy as a waitress. She was rude since we ordered our drinks. After we finished our dinner she never picked up the empty plates. Our table was a mess full of empty glasses and plates. Don't think we will go back.,UNK
3388,"This is the best show I have seen in Vegas! (penn & teller, zumanity, criss angel, and other shows)\n\nIt is a unique and entertaining experience unlike anything else.",UNK
3389,The Fried Pickles and Chili Cheese Fries were amazing and my burger was great.  I would totally recommend this place to a friend.,UNK
3390,"This place was the worst of worst never have I tasted such gross food, found a hair in my food, vegetable rolls were just so nasty . We ended up throwing away 98. % of the food. This place needs closed down.",UNK
3391,"Good hotel set next to the Zoo so great if your planning going there , easy to get bus into town as on main bus route. Good food although quite expensive for what you get.",UNK
3392,"There was a time when this place was decent even if never great, but it was cheap and the vibe was cool.  But now the dinner menu prices are what you might pay at much nicer Chinese restaurants, and the TV on in the dining area only reinforces the impression that some bad decisions have been made.",UNK
3393,"Went on a sunday with the family, there were a couple other families. the staff was great and friendly. it is super fun for adults and kids. everyone got to go four times, the fourth time being caught and leaving your bar. the whole family had a great time.",UNK
3394,"Great for Charm City fans! The wings were great..add some Old Bay! There was a dude across the way enjoying some crabs. Service was kinda slow, if you're a drinker I suggest getting a pitcher unless seated at the bar. Full of life and a friendly atmosphere with multiple flat screens to enjoy the game!",UNK
3395,Seriously the best shaved ice I have ever had.... the flavors are fabulous and the ice is shaved to perfection. The owners of it are super friendly and you can tell they work really hard to please their customers. 10 out of 10.,UNK
3396,"Ate lunch there today. My husband and I shared the turkey sandwich and the pecan crusted chicken salad. Both lacked flavor and no oopmh. For the price I was expecting something more gourmet. However, they did guess I was drinking an Arnold Palmer and refill it correctly.",UNK
3397,60 day trail membership! Free! I tried Bj's out and it is great! I still like Costco better. Bj's doesn't have a big produce section. It is nice that they let you use manufacturers coupons!,UNK
3398,"Always a bad attitude at the window and my order is always wrong. Yesterday's salad was very dirty. The extra dressing I asked for, was \""one\"" good size container, but it was only half filled. I will not return.",UNK
3399,"The ears to hear our order not so great. Latte not so great. Scones were okay. \n\nPerhaps my expectations, and only visit, got the best of me.",UNK
3400,"I had the BBQ pork ramen, which was OK. There's nothing really special about the ramen here. The decor is nice, but the ambience feels a bit dead. I won't be coming back.",UNK
3401,"THEY FREEZE THE TEQUILA!  margaritas a great, and they have yummy snacks.  good for happy hour.",UNK
3402,"Love the food and the service. . I don't know why someone complained about the owner , she is really nice and a good lady .",UNK
3403,"This place sucks, the food taste like medicine.  Way too salty. The guy at the register is sooooo rude, I should of went to Mcdonald instead. Yuckkkk. For all the people who gave bad reviews,  belive it or not but its true.",UNK
3404,"We went to the location to purchase a bow tie and the store was closed early, which was less than ideal because we specifically hurried over there for an urgent need. We ended up going back the next day, and the attendant was very helpful. But closing the store earlier than posted hours leaves me to leave only two stars on this review.",UNK
3405,"the most disgusting, repulsive, filthy, dishonest, poorly run hotel on the face of the earth. I would not stay here again if I were paid $10000.",UNK
3406,I love shopping at Costco. Great prices and the best bakery. Only down side is when I went to get something to eat there the woman behind the counter was yelling at us and rolled her eyes when we said we needed a minute. There was nobody behind us in line. No need for the attitude,UNK
3407,"Very nice rooms are great ,but the had the kids soccer there.Them were very load forget sleeping pass 7 in morning to load. Bouncing balls ,throwing back and forth.it would had been great .Next time i will check to see ig anything like this is going on",UNK
3408,"Super late review but this place does get a 4. I loved the food and the service was great, especially since it was for my mom's birthday. Cool place to stop and get some filipino food inVegas.",UNK
3409,The sales here are incredible. I can't wait till California comes out with a Topshop/Topman. I like this place because they always have small sizes/frames for thin men like me. I guess because its a British thing.,UNK
3410,"Again, uninspired Indian in Vegas.  The service was poor during the Sunday dinner rush, and the naan I ordered was burnt to the point that it was almost inedible.  The greasy pakora and dry curry were not helped by my continuously empty water glass.  Pass.",UNK
3411,"Long wait but once you get in it is an experience, the food is great and the beer is as authentic as you can get out of the alps",UNK
3412,the peppered steak is delicious! i'm not much of a meat person so that says a lot. the service is wonderful and entertaining. well worth the wait!\n\ndon't forget to leave room for dessert!,UNK
3413,"This place sucks. I have had consistently poor service from snobby, shitty bartenders who would rather stand around talking shit than help a thirsty and hungry patron. Avoid this place.",UNK
3414,"If I could eat the pepper jack mac and cheese all day long, I would. I get it every time I go. The sandwiches are pretty good too. It's got a great, laid back atmosphere where you can get pretty decent bar food and a have a beer or two.",UNK
3415,"I definitely like the Chez Jose chicken sandwich with avocado, hot sauce and a cup of coffee as an option in the area. This is a quick, tasty, cheap lunch on pretty Duluth that's not a chain, uses fresh ingredients, and has always in my experience offered friendly, if lowkey, service.",UNK
3416,"This is a great pizza or it's your fault for not choosing the right toppings.\nAs I like the fresh topoig flavors , the taste and texture of the crust, not a heavy sauce or buttery , overly cheese topped pizza.",UNK
3417,"Madison's great historic small concert venue.  Lot's of great bands play here.  I saw Weezer on their Pinkerton Tour with Nerf Herder (remember them? The Van Halen Song? Yes, I'm that old).",UNK
3418,"Not bad.  Prices are fairly negotiable... especially for detail work, or more than one vehicle (the husband and I went at the same time).  They did a pretty good job cleaning up the interior of my toddler-invaded car.  Thank goodness... I thought those juice stains would be there forever!",UNK
3419,"I go here like at least every week and their beer selection and hotdogs are awesome. One of my favorites places to just relax. However, I feel like lately the freshness of the ingredients hasn't been the best. So just watch for that. Other than that I love this place.",UNK
3420,"Mordechai and his son, Benny, are so nice and hospitable. They great you with a smile and do whatever they can to make you happy. I feel completely satisfied when I leave. Thank you",UNK
3421,"It's a great place to pop in for a quick lunch, but have an even better dinner menu. I generally get one of the curry lunch dishes and love the soup and spring rolls they serve. Delicious! I'd highly recommend trying this place out if you're in the area.",UNK
3422,"Really???? I have been craving coconut shrimp taco Tuesday night....!  Get there at 8:30, and they ran out!???? What a bust!",UNK
3423,"We enjoy La Tolteca's comfortable atmosphere and friendly staff. The free chips  and salsa are delicious; enchiladas are great. Yes, the cheese sauce is yummy, as is the fresh guacamole. Oh, and the oversized margaritas are a definite plus.",UNK
3424,"Looonnngg wait, suppose it's worth it to some, but definitely not one of my fave brunch places.  Great OJ, however.",UNK
3425,"Grab & go? Paid for then stood around ten minutes waiting for a dark brown, crunchy crusted pie that was about 30 seconds from being burned. Good quantity of ingredients though. I'll probably give them another shot.",UNK
3426,"Its a nice castle and all...but for that price I've definitely seen better castles. Free tour when you go in, and this lasts about 20 minutes. You can then wander around on your own and see the war memorial, crown, and war museum. Beautiful castle, but not someone on a budgets best friend.",UNK
3427,"As a Tier 0 account, the store has a dope collection. That being said, the owner/management do not give a shit about a customer service as they know products will move.  Will not recommend this store.",UNK
3428,It's by no means a Japanese restaurant. The only thing I think real is the instant miso soup. Don't ever order Sukiyaki Udon! I am so disappointed by it.,UNK
3429,It was a great experience. Would go back there again. Bc of there are cheaper places around i didn't give them the 5*.,UNK
3430,Our party of 4 enjoyed a very nice table with Sean as our waiter. The warm olives and potato chips were excellent appetizers. I enjoyed my recommended filet mignon au poivre. Two others enjoyed the bolognaise. Overall a good choice for dinner.,UNK
3431,Upscale small place located on the capitol square.  Usual upscale seafood song and dance.  Friends took me here for my birthday and I loved it.  \n\nDefinitely fancy!,UNK
3432,Half chicken was good and the mash potatoes were delish!\n\nChicken soup was good too.\n\nExcellent customer service.\n\nPricey.,UNK
3433,"very frequent guest of this location and have never left upset of the food or service.  all the staff is friendly from the busboys on up to management.  their food is good and reasonable and large servings.  I have eaten here for all meals the only thing I would not reorder is the Cadillac meatloaf, everything else has been superb!",UNK
3434,"I took my mother to dinner here for her birthday. Even though it was a busy Friday night, the hostess was very helpful in trying to push my mother and I up in line for waiting. We were even surprised with a little gift for her birthday. The menu has many options, and the food is delicious. I definitely will be visiting again.",UNK
3435,"The thing that I have tried in this restaurant that I really liked was the pear dessert with ice cream and the goat cheese fondue. Everything else has been either too salty for me: the salmon ceviche, the meat with chimichurri, or lacking flavor like the shrimp ceviche.",UNK
3436,"Recession of '08 has another victim.  Cafe Wasabi is closed.  This is the second time in a month that I've gone to a restaurant with good yelp reviews, only to find that the restaurant is gone, kaput, out of business.",UNK
3437,They have fantastic macaroni salad and rice. The kalbi short ribs and the teriyaki chicken are both favorites. Fast and very friendly service as well as great lunch prices!,UNK
3438,"I had food delivered. The man on the phone was nice, but barley understood me. The food was bland. sauce was runny. Lots of food, but not worth the money.",UNK
3439,"We had high expectations, as the food at Rivertowne in Verona is great. We tried the beer special, $3 for Anchor Brewing beer that was great. The fish sandwich was excellent but the fries were disappointing. The mushroom burger was very good, too.",UNK
3440,"Seriously, Brandi is amazing! She is fast and gets everything in one shot. I've tried several places and will NEVER go to anyone else. It's already uncomfortable baring all with bright lights all around but she makes it seem like no big deal. Super comfortable and always happy :)",UNK
3441,"Amazing food and service!  The black cod lettuce cups and the yellowtail sashimi were awesome.  And, at the end of our meal, the chef came out to see how we liked it.  I highly recommend it.",UNK
3442,"UUUMMMM!!!  That one word sums it up.  I don't live downtown anymore, but this is still my treat place.  Best gyros, good fries & even better: GREAT hours.  The trick is to go at bar time, the meat is the freshest:-)",UNK
3443,"This place is alright. It's got the basics for sure, but ya know.. all the lingerie pieces have a stale cigarette smell to them, since there's a movie theatre in the joint that allows patrons to smoke.\nStaff is always good. They have a great selection of lube.",UNK
3444,Me & my boyfriend love this place! We eat here at least once a week!!! The sushi chefs are awesome & so nice. We recommend everyone to eat here. Especially for late night cravings!!,UNK
3445,Just spent $30 on a drink and the staff was rude and not helpful. They acted like we were bothering them. Go to fat Tuesdays this place is a total rip off,UNK
3446,"The service and the environment are both pretty good, but the food is rather normal. The portion is decent, but the quality (both the material used and the cooking skills) is as common as it can be...i.e. my husband would say I can cook better.",UNK
3447,"Really enjoyed food was very surprised by the amount of people that were at the location. Great taco Tuesday idea, felt warm and friendly. Had two $1 tacos and 2 carne asada. I will def be going back to dine in and request hotter salsa! Lots of flavor and felt like home",UNK
3448,definitely one of my favorite pizza spots ever! and it tastes even better when you are drunk borderline blacked out-- the line may be intimidating... but trust me it's worth it!,UNK
3449,"Said they lost my card, but still were able to charge it..with a 20% tip. Menu is a culinary abortion. Service is constantly bad with an attitude. This place won't last another summer.",UNK
3450,"Awesome food, great service, good value, great selection, and super fast delivery (granted I live less than two miles away). Nothing to complain about.",UNK
3451,I wish I could give this place zero stars.  I had the NY steak and cheese on  ciabatta and I'm pretty sure that dog food would have tasted better.  It honestly tasted like old meat.  You couldn't even taste the cheese.  Eww...just thinking about it is making me nauseous.,UNK
3452,This is the first off the strip place that has TORO on the menu and on the specials board. Totally legit!!!,UNK
3453,"We tried this place because we hears Obama likes five guys burgers, this place is horrible, now I know why the economy is the way it is.",UNK
3454,Very nice.  Very dark.  Table side guacomole is good.  The 4 of us had small plates instead of meals.  Pricey but worth it. Pork belly was my favorite. Two liked the mushroom tacos. Service was good. John helped us out. Would return and do small plates again.,UNK
3455,More management!!!!!!!!! Horrible service. Crappy DJ. Bathrooms are disgusting!!! Sound quality is poor. Unfriendly. I would give this place a big fat ZERO!!,UNK
3456,"I truly wanted to like these cupcakes, but I have to agree with other reviews in that the cake was sort of dry, and the icing was greasy, and not buttercream.  I have had better frosting from grocery stores and Costco!",UNK
3457,"So so.  It was the smaller things that SHOUTED \""cheap & low quality\""\nCrappy hair dryer.  Holes burned in comforter.  Ratty toilet seat.  Stayed one night in 2 bedroom unit.  Liked the layout - 2 bedrooms - each with a bathroom.  Living room and kitchen between.",UNK
3458,Ive had good experience from this place once. I came back with a friend and was very disappointed. There was hair on one of the side dishes. Service was horrible and the place wasn't even packed.,UNK
3459,Slowest fast food I've ever had. I've been waiting so long I'm writing this review before I even get the food,UNK
3460,"You get what you pay for, I've stayed in a lot worse. Beds are hard, towels and bedding need a good bleaching, and it's overall a little run down. It kind of gets you thinking when you see signs posted on every door \""No Weapons Allowed In Building\"".",UNK
3461,"Third time here and enjoyed every trip.  Pizzas are top notch with all the toppings you could ask for .. chopped salad was excellent and Calzone was, if not the best, one of the best I ever had. Helpful and polite service. Thoroughly enjoyed!",UNK
3462,I waited 1 for my can pick up and never arrived. Called them back and they said it was on its way and again another hour later no cab. Worst cab company to rely on,UNK
3463,"Average food with sub-par service. Ordered Italian dressing on my salad, got blue cheese. Ok. Ordered chicken, got shredded beef. Whatever.  Ordered the guacamole, it was simple and fresh, but all in all, nothing to bring me back.",UNK
3464,Awesome place for happy hour specials. A great place to have a Fat Tire beer and enjoy a game and a visit with an old friend. Will be back,UNK
3465,"We went on a Friday night around 6pm. There were no other patrons there, but decided to give it a try based on a recommendation. The service was friendly.\n\nOrdered two dishes. Took awhile to get out, but they tasted pretty good.",UNK
3466,"Carne Asada Torta topped with two fried eggs and sliced avocado. Good lord, what a great and tasty idea. Tried it, loved it, would do it again.",UNK
3467,The food is better than most standard Vietnamese.....the fish sauce needs more flavor.  Service was good.  The ambience was definitely better than most Asian restaurants.,UNK
3468,"I love this place, generous portions of food that taste great, the service was exceptionally fast and friendly, would recommend this place to friends and family with small or large parties.... the miso black cod was excellent !!!",UNK
3469,"Yikes.\n\nWell, there goes an hour we'll never get back.\n\nIf it wasn't free, bf and I would've raised hell. It was free, and we still complained about it for hours afterward, and we still do, months after.",UNK
3470,"The chips, salsa and guac are good.  I think the ambiance is nice and the service is pretty fast...check out the open kitchen production line.  Overall, not the best food but their overall package matches up well for Las Vegas.",UNK
3471,I work in the industry; needed to get nose pad replacements for expensive wire frames I wear everyday; they charged me 24 dollars with tax;  I could get them for free at most optical shops;  enough said.,UNK
3472,"There is not a bad item on the menu.  Tonite tried the gorditas de camarones very good, loaded with baby shrimp.  Mariachi band was great!",UNK
3473,"I just had a great lunch at the Bamboo Club.  Everything was wonderful.  The food, the service and the atmosphere.  I had not been there in a while and it reminded of what a great place it is and how close it is to my home.  I am a placing on my list of favorites.",UNK
3474,I've been going here for years and always pleased with everything.  The fact that this place has been in business for as many years as it has speaks volumes that they are doing it right.,UNK
3475,Ended up here when other nearby places had a long wait and we were quite hungry. Should have taken into account that there was nobody eating in this place. Food was just kind of blah and the service was lacking both inspiration and perspiration.,UNK
3476,"Good place to bring my kids who love cooked sushi, but my fiance n I will prob stick to sushi style. Thats amazing raw sushi. But this place is very quick",UNK
3477,"My friend and I went here to grab a drink and appetizer before the LOVE show.  The drinks were great, the scene was cool, and the service was good, but the food was not.  It wasn't terrible, but for the price of the food there wasn't much flavor or much there.",UNK
3478,"A Green St staple that doesn't deserve the hype.  The food is greasy, the cheese is plastic-y, dishes oversalted etc.  Nonetheless you can get a lot of food (calories) for a pretty low price, so starving students have an excuse.",UNK
3479,"Justin and team are always coming up with new creations but we love the large salumi plate, which contains violet mustard orange fennel chorizo lardo duck pate, pickled onions and about 18 other things that I lose track of in the swirling mouthfuls of goodness.",UNK
3480,Some of the best Mexican food I've had (& my grandmas from Mexico.) The area's rundown so it looks sketchy but it was clean. We had about 4 servers/busers frequently asking us if we were ok. Great chips & salsa.,UNK
3481,"I stay here @ least 2 to 3 times a year. Always good service, plus I get discounts with them now :-) Rooms are cozy & clean & they have mini refrigerators in the rooms!",UNK
3482,Awesome local treasure. Food is basic but with unique twists. Always right on the mark. Very friendly staff. Cute little place come early cause it gets busy. Try the Napa salad and the Miss Jules sandwich the pinot noir onions are too die for.,UNK
3483,"This is a great place when you are just looking for a good salad.  They make it right in front of you, and they have every ingredient you could imagine.  What they have off the grill is delicious too.  I really enjoy the AZ Tri-Tip Sandwich. Yum!",UNK
3484,"Leaves much to be desired. Overpriced. Better Jamaican food in the valley! After getting reheated stake red beans and rice brought it to the owners attention, he did nothing about it and had the audacity to charge me for the meal. This restaurant may be good for folks who don't really know authentic West Indian cuisine.",UNK
3485,Good was good.  Had a party of 20 for a birthday. Service was good.  But they ran out of Prime rib......  Kind of a let down right there. That was the main thing I wanted to try.  Other than that the steak was good.  Cooked it exactly how I wanted it to be.,UNK
3486,"This can't be too common of a complaint, but if you're hanging out w/ foreigners, be aware they refuse to take passports as valid IDs (but also don't take foreign driver's licenses...so I guess they only serve Americans?)\n\nOther than that, nice, cool chill place.",UNK
3487,"How could any Joel Robuchon restaurants disappoint you. Needless to say,  this was my best dining experience ever, from food to service to ambiance,  everything was superb.",UNK
3488,"Never knew how big the place was. Seems like an awesome place for sporting events. I didn't get any drinks, but the specials appear good. It was freaking dead in there, but I want to try and go on a busy night for further review.",UNK
3489,"The drinks are pricey, the hoes are raggedy and ratchet assedy, and the music is loud even for a club.\n\nI'd rather sit on a patio and drink reasonably priced beer. Guess I'm getting old.",UNK
3490,This place would have some potential but there is some severe organization issues. When I arrived for pickup there were several angry people in the lobby.,UNK
3491,Awesome Pho!  One of the best in the valley.  Probably the BEST bang for the buck for Pho.,UNK
3492,Meh....not a huge fan of this place. Just another tex-mex style restaurant for tourists. I had the fish tacos and they came out cold. The chips and salsa were the best part of my experience. I will try out other places when I come back to Planet Hollywood.,UNK
3493,"Cheap, but in a shady spot. The food wasn't exactly mom's quality,  but the options are good.",UNK
3494,"Not so much on the menu, more of a biker bar & grill.  The most plain quesadilla I have ever had. The waitress hides alot hard to locate.  No avocados? WTH??? No salsa? WTH",UNK
3495,This may have been my first time here but it definitely won't be my last. \n\nHad the BBQ nachos (substituted brisket for chicken) and it was amazing. Great atmosphere and great service as well.,UNK
3496,"CRUMMY wait staff and service, very slow working sushi chefs, rolled their eyes at the sight of my 3 year old (who does very well in restaurants) we won't be returning.",UNK
3497,Nothing special. From the service to the food...just not that memorable. The pork chop w/ pork belly  was just too sweet. and not  as tender.  The halibut was slightly overcooked and not special. Overall there were tons of uneaten food on everyone's plate.,UNK
3498,The blue flame is probably one of their best rolls! They are to die for. Love this place. But I go to the one in Goodyear,UNK
3499,"I've seen several productions here and have enjoyed them.  Definately need to sit in the orchestra as the balcony is too high and far back to see well.  Hard to compare to the beautiful, older, historic theaters in NYC, but this will have to do.",UNK
3500,"I had the chicken lo mein and barbecue bao.\n\nI may have to give this place another shot, because both options were rather bland and nothing to write home about.",UNK
3501,"Best dining experience you could ask for, great service, awesome food and the managers come around to make sure you are enjoying yourself. Even had a sample of pizza while we were waiting.",UNK
3502,"Review is for rooftop bar (outdoor) only. Stunning view of Vegas, definitely a top 5. Nice ambiance, not as crowded as other bars.",UNK
3503,"Roohi is AMAZING, super inexpensive, will have you laughing like never before. She is a true Persian Princess. Love, Love, Love this woman. Tonight we did a full face and I feel like I had a lift my skin looks and feels amazing!!!",UNK
3504,"The wait was almost as bad at the food, I felt so cheated after waiting to be seated just to eat this well below standard dim sum.",UNK
3505,The pharmacy here is the WORST!  In the last several months the service has gone down the tubes.  Routinely get the wrong medicine (and sit in the store for 10 minutes and listen to how many others this happens to)!!  Service is the worst too!,UNK
3506,This place as CHANGES...... FOR THE BETTER..... Its AWESOME!!!!!,UNK
3507,"Wonderful . from front desk to adjustments to physical therapy. I recommend them. They accept blue cross blue shield, with my co pay. Open 5 days a week.",UNK
3508,"It is a good burger but its not worth the $$.  For 45 dollars for my wife and myself which included no drinks, 1 appetizer and 2 burgers its just too expensive for what you get.    Go to the oyster bar next door...now that place rocks it.",UNK
3509,Food was amazing. Service was awful. We barley saw our waiter and the bus boy took our waters from us when we had finished but were still talking.,UNK
3510,"4 of July Chipotle was closed so I decided to give this place a try. Workers were very un-friendly, the food was not good and the cost for a burrito bowl was over $14 that's with out a drink!",UNK
3511,"EW. Horrible horrible horrible service. I very rarely leave no tip, but this place got none. Especially in times as hard as these, I sympathize with the staff...but we got absolutely NO help here.\n\nGood chips and dip though.",UNK
3512,"One oft favorite joints in Charlotte. Between the jazz band, etoufee, and shrimp& grits this place takes the cake.",UNK
3513,"This location is one of the worst! All the way from managment down, they nickel and dime me all the way!  I recommend avoiding this hertz location",UNK
3514,Delicious sushi! Lots of variety. Good drinks. Great for lunch and dinner! Full bar. Also they have coupons time to time on GroupOn. Would recommend.,UNK
3515,I love Roy's - almost everything is delicious and the service is top notch.  \n\nThey no longer serve bread and butter?  What's up with that?,UNK
3516,"I like Subway, but this location is always packed! Every time I come here there is always a wait. Don't bother going during lunch, because the line is out the door. I've literally had to turn around and leave because the line/wait was too long.",UNK
3517,Couldnt tell you a thing about this airport except that right next to our gate for our connecting flight there was a gelato place that had some pretty great flavours.  I made the mistake of getting the coffee flavour which meant that I couldnt get to sleep until about 2am the next morning.  Oh but it was worth it.,UNK
3518,"What a complete rip-off for a \""cafe'\""  Holy Crapoli.  Had breakfast here one morning this week while staying at the MGM Grand and was too hungry to go hunting for options. but wow.  $26 for two eggs, two strips of bacon and potatoes.  \n\nRidiculous.  Pathetic.",UNK
3519,Every item that I tried was amazing. Owner made it a pleasant environment and he had a terrific voice. A must try in Central Phoenix.,UNK
3520,"Love love love love their Caramel Vanilla Latte. You gotta try it on Wednesday:)   $2 latte Wednesday, cannot beat it right ;D",UNK
3521,First time at Rio - check in at 5 took 20 minutes - now at taxi everyone trying leave Rio - this place suck & will never stay again - I stay cuz of friends - not worth my time or money!!! Stay away if u under 35,UNK
3522,Staff here is usually very nice and helpful and not overbearing. Everything is kept nice and tidy. I just feel that this location does lack in variety and sizes...,UNK
3523,"Cheap, questionable chicken and really, really overpriced considering the quality and amount that is given.  Not a ton of options but the only thing open in town on Easter.  Spend your money elsewhere.",UNK
3524,Walked in took a while for them to get my order they didn't greet me. They took forever to get the order ready. And when they repeated the order back they got it wrong. Would not come back here again. Everyone spoke Spanish no one spoke English really sucks.,UNK
3525,I went in here for the first time in around 12 years. It was ugly and cluttered and not well lit. I am also thoroughly disappointed that they do not do any discounts or donations for nonprofit organizations that are centered around kids.,UNK
3526,"Been ordering delivery from Marathons all my life. If they had a VIP badge, my family would have one. Love the food, quick delivery and great price. I order twice a week and only guilt stops me from ordering more. \n\nHighly recommended.",UNK
3527,"This place is near my house. I've gone twice before and it's been okay but not great. The second time, I ordered a hummus plate and was very unimpressed with the quality of the hummus. I much prefer the nearby Greek Pita off Thunderbird and the I-17.",UNK
3528,"If you're looking for a bar that serves beer, this place is exactly what you're looking for.  Everything else about it is mediocre.\n\nIn closing, there seems to be no time limit imposed on the ping-pong tables once a pair has claimed lordship.",UNK
3529,"This location doesn't have a drive-thru and it's quite small, so I don't frequent it often, but it's a Starbucks and it's consistent.",UNK
3530,My favorite hotel in Madison.  Especially if you upgrade to the governors club.\n\nRooms are great and the staff ate friendly.  Open bar at the governors club.,UNK
3531,"Very good Dutch apple pie. And friendly service. The prices are about what you'd pay at any other eating establishment that's fast food. However, you can enjoy your meal in a cozy sit down environment.",UNK
3532,I could eat at this place everyday and have something different each time and it would be delicious!\n\nI love this place.,UNK
3533,Come hungry because you get a lot. The food was delicious and the salsa tasted fresh. I think we found our new mexican restaurant home.,UNK
3534,"I'm a big fan of Fuddruckers but the Orleans Food Court falls short of the usual restaurant experience. It's good late-night or in a pinch, but otherwise it's worth the trip over to the Grand Canyon location near 215/Flamingo.",UNK
3535,"The best party store I've been to. Tons of supplies for different themes, plenty of nice people to help, quick balloon inflation, and chairs to sit and wait. Great place.",UNK
3536,"I used to love Bob & Sheri, but now they have more music and commercials during their chat room than actual callers.  It is hard to believe that people actually hold on the line for 15 minutes!  This is incredibly rude and having 60 minutes commercial and music free would make this show better.",UNK
3537,"Plenty of flavors, i think 63.\nFamily owned business \nClean business\nService is always great, they are pleasant and try to encourage you to come back.",UNK
3538,Definitely overrated. They screwed up our order. Overall their food is bland and disappointing. \n\nThe only positive is that their service was fast despite how understaffed they are.,UNK
3539,"Bien situ\u00e9e dans le quartier Grassmarket, bonne s\u00e9lection de bi\u00e8res.",UNK
3540,"Great locally owned spot!  Food is always fresh, spiced right and reasonably priced.  Not a bad item on the menu!  \nIt's in a strip mall... so, not the greatest location... small and about ready for an update.  But, the atmosphere inside is nice.  You've gotta try this place!",UNK
3541,"Molly's is a great place to come hang out with friends if you're looking to just chill. Whether you want to watch the game on TV, or take in the live music they often have, you'll enjoy yourself here.",UNK
3542,"A few excellent shops and some good food, movie theatre... It's a suburban commercial center!!! You should know these places as they are everywhere carbon copied in any city.... But this is a really nice one",UNK
3543,"With a gazillion omelet options, this place is a lot of fun.  They have pumpkin and banana nut bread! Very friendly, fast service.",UNK
3544,Two words...Olive Garden.  Exact same salad and bread sticks....unfortunately the simple spaghetti with marinara tasted like it was from Denny's.  Also the eggplant wasn't much better.  I would suggest going anywhere else for Italian.  On the bright side the service was good.,UNK
3545,Nice job on dry cleaned pants and cheap. but laundered shirts always come out wrinkiled.  I take pants there and shirts elsewhere and pay a bit more so i won't have to worry about touch up at home on the shirts.,UNK
3546,"Very nice hotel that puts an emphasis on customer service.  The staff was very friendly, helpful and went out of their way to make you feel at home.  The fitness room had a lot of equipment and wasn't crowded in the evening so it made it easy to work-out.  Would definitely stay here again.",UNK
3547,"Love, love this place! They have excellent service and food AND offer Lots of gluten, dairy free and organic options!!! They were super kid friendly.  Oh and awesome music too! Yay Scottsdale!",UNK
3548,The eye center is horrible. We took the guarantee on my son's glasses and it's over 4 weeeks since my son broke his glasses. We are still waiting for them to get repaired.,UNK
3549,"Real star of the place was the (locally imported) crack in a cup smoked salmon cream cheese spread.\n\nBagels were perfectly toasted and complemented well, but honestly I could've dipped a dried up piece of sponge in the salmon cream cheese and it would've tasted orgasmic.",UNK
3550,"This is one of the best bars in town! If you have out of town guests, bring them to the Dirty Dogg Saloon. This place is edgy and fun. You and your guests will have a blast watching the girls dance on the bar. They play great music, and a lot of great people hang out there.",UNK
3551,So Resto L'appartement sucks.  While the establishment tries to be uber trendy it turns off customers who are actually more interested in the food than the fake vibe.,UNK
3552,"first impressions were definitely cool, calm and collective. good vibes and a great atmosphere.  the pinot noir wine was very smooth bodied and full flavored. visiting from Sierra Vista I never heard of this place. Pizza is great! I recommend all to try it.",UNK
3553,"Great service. Knowledgable. Just remember though. It's pizza. Just pizza. If there's more than an hour wait, don't wait. Just go somewhere else. They'll be around next time.",UNK
3554,Meh....I could have lived without having to experiencing this place. Food was alright and the service wasn't the greatest.  (And not in the New York kind of way...just not available)  I could have spent $20 on breakfast somewhere else.,UNK
3555,"You have a pretty good menu over there. There's one inconvenient, the place is extremely small. However, the poutine over there is totally worth it. It's very good and probably the least greasy I've had the chance of eating so far.",UNK
3556,"Good place to just come drink and chill, music is way too loud, can't hear anything unless they shout at you.  I think I'll go somewhere else.",UNK
3557,The food was okay but not great; price is just like any other Chinese restaurants in that area but the waitress there was rude.\nThe plates and tea cup are dirty.\n\nI really cannot find a good reason to eat there!!!!,UNK
3558,Really good food and one of if not the best selection of beer between here and the next closest Yard House.  The Happy Hour prices are even better.,UNK
3559,Definitely a must go to restaurant. It has a nice chic look to it. Food is amazing and the prices are unbeatable. It's a little far out from the strip but worth the drive. My new favorite spot to eat at in Vegas. Looks like this place is here to stay :),UNK
3560,"Tacos were good but pricey for what you get. Service was friendly but slow and not attentive to our needs.  With other restaurants in area, there is little incentive to return.",UNK
3561,"Unimpressive.  I understand that this was only a two hour cleaning, so I did not expect perfection, but I was dissappointed in the kitchen particularly.  The company does guarantee their work, but I honestly can't be bothered to have someone else come back.  It should be done right the first time.",UNK
3562,I love this place. Get take out a couple times a month and dine in as well. The staff is so nice. Love the avocado roll and the noodle dishes are great too. Awesome happy hour and lunch special. Definitely recommend!,UNK
3563,I love macayos..have been going there for twenty years...totos will be the place I go for the next twent lol...great food,UNK
3564,I've only been here once and got the most americanized dish (orange chicken) but it was great. Chicken was cut in larger portions which I enjoy and the rice was very tasty. Definitely will be coming back. Their lunch deal for 2 is a good deal,UNK
3565,"Best Thai food for your dollar in the entire valley. I'm no Thai expert, but I have been to at least a dozen here in the valley. Keep in mind - this is NOT a fancy place - just a simple, inexpensive, casual dining experience. WOW!",UNK
3566,So disappointed in my stay. Every morning there was loud construction happening next door at 5:30am. The cable kept cutting out. Our room didn't get cleaned because housekeeping got behind. \n\nThe best thing? Aveda bath products.,UNK
3567,Food is actually have decent. Not bad at all. I really enjoyed the potatoes. But the service was horrible!! Took forever to get a waitress to come over and take down the order. Not to mention getting charged 2.95$ for 3 asparagus... I wouldn't go back.,UNK
3568,"Not a bad destination for resale, actually, but beware the dangers of being \""sold\"" on an item that clearly doesn't meet your needs, combined with a firm 'no return' policy.",UNK
3569,"Please, please do not park in front of the neighborhood houses.  It is getting really old and annoying asking, more often than not drunk, Yard patrons to use the valet parking instead of parking in front of our homes.  They provide free valet parking, use it!",UNK
3570,"The salesman, Johnny, did a fantastic job selling.  He was very knowledgeable on his furniture and helped us get the maximum discounts, however, delivery is a different story.  Inaccurate availability made us take our business elsewhere.",UNK
3571,"We came starving and the service is REALLY slow even though our friend was known by the server because she's somewhat of a regular. Super divey bar, no need to dress up...or wear clean clothes.",UNK
3572,"The food was pretty good here, but a bit pricey for what we got. My whole party had breakfast and it was quick, food was hot, but no real wow factor on flavor. I would recommend if you are in the area and just want a quick breakfast.",UNK
3573,"EXCELLANT ! Worth waiting for. Price is fine for the quality and quantity.  Everything is great, especially enchiladas and green corn tamales be sure to add cheese.  We are totally fans and will me back, a lot",UNK
3574,"The Signature is sheer class. Favorite hotel in Vegas thus far. Modern, cutting edge suites with roomy balconies and all the amenities. I would live at the Signature if I could.",UNK
3575,"I have been five times now. Not once have I had a decent meal. So if a friend suggests we go, I will send them on thier way while I go somewhere good.",UNK
3576,This place has the best chicken sandwich I have ever had! Every time I am in Vegas I go to this restaurant at least once to get my chicken sandwich fix. Service can be a little slow and seats can be limited but for the chicken sandwich it's worth the wait. Prices are also great for the strip and the Bellagio.,UNK
3577,Went to this restaurant with my wife and ordered a meal to share.  5 minutes after we started eating the manager came out and said we have to take the plates back because we put a full size meal on them.,UNK
3578,"I have been going to Red Rock Dental for 11 years so I am obviously a big fan :)  I love all the hygienists, Dr. Mcaffery, the ease of outside parking (something you really come to appreciate being from California:). Red Rock Dental is the best and I highly recommend it for teens and adults.",UNK
3579,Awesome fast amazing service! Mike came to my office to fix my 5s and it works perfectly!!! I will definitely call mike for all my iPhone screen needs.,UNK
3580,"We didn't have food here, just drinks, but this was my very favorite bar in all of Las Vegas the last time we were here. Our waitress was an absolute sweetheart and the drinks were amazing. I will make it a point to go back here every time I am in Vegas, no matter where I am staying.",UNK
3581,"The manager val was extremely rude, I arrived at 4:15 and he refused to serve me for a standard oil change, I'll be writing the BBB about this as well",UNK
3582,"I would not recommend this restaurant. We had bad service; it was very slow, and the restaurant wasn't even crowded. The food tasted like they took it out of the freezer and microwaved it. Mine was half cold; I couldn't even eat. Definitely wont be going here again.",UNK
3583,We waited an hour and half before we finally saw the dr. Dr Martinez was great but the wait was too long for a toddler who wants to get into everything\n\nThe waiting room was so tiny. 5 or 6 people had to stand around because there were no seats.,UNK
3584,"I really do not understand the hype. \n\nI mean, it is good....not great. Not worth standing in a line stretching down the sidewalk. \n\nA lot of choices, and super friendly. \n\nJust nothing special.",UNK
3585,"I won't buy coffee anywhere else as long as I live here. . . Try the Burundi or Bob-O-Link Brazil for truly great, fresh single-origin beans.  Great price for great product!  Kind employees and great service.",UNK
3586,"Gross.\n\nDesperate, I ate here and regretted it about 10 minutes after finishing and for the next 24 hours.",UNK
3587,"Chips stale... Bad start.\n\nGreen rice and beans with the combo plates flavorless and bland. Pulled pork tacos terrible tasting.\n\nWill never return to this overpriced, under flavored, faux Tex-mex restaurant.",UNK
3588,"It's one of the big bagel chains, so what do you expect? You're gonna get consistency, but you're not gonna get character or real eggs in your egg sandwich. Props for having a Challah bagel though.\n\nThis one seemed particularly disorganized from the ones I've been to.",UNK
3589,"Was referred by a friend.  I had Jason and my husband had Tyre,  they were very good, very strong but smooth and gentle strokes.  They also add warm stones, lots of stretches.  You get your money worth.  We will come back again.",UNK
3590,This place is he absolute worst car wash in the valley! Stay clear! You wait an hour to get your car or truck back dirty! All they do is try and pressure sell you on stuff. They are really bad! You have been warned!!,UNK
3591,"This place is over the top amazing food, but what do you expect, it's Spago.  Great wines, seafood, short ribs...everything was exceptional.  It's a great place to overly entertain your guests on the strip.",UNK
3592,"Every time we g to AZ, Phoenix Art Museum is on our list of things to go and see. The changing exhibits are wonderful. And, the price is right -- you only pay a nominal fee for parking.",UNK
3593,Called and found out Rob's gone!  So gave them another whirl and service on my bike couldn't have been better.,UNK
3594,Good food fat portions . Kool to have Chino food a phone call away. Delivery is quick . Ppl are nice I've eaten in and it's pretty clean and they seem to enjoy there jobs.,UNK
3595,I've had my hair cut here for 15 yrs & never a bad do.  It's like Cheers where everyone knows your name.,UNK
3596,"This place is my go to whenever I need a place to eat or drink. When it comes to having visitors, needing to celebrate, happy hours, or just cause this is the place to go. Food and drinks are amazing as well as the service. It's rare to have all those things come together in one location! LOVE this place!",UNK
3597,I am very disappointed with the wait to get into the buffet.  The line is not moving and the hostesses seem very confused.  I don't think we will be returning.  We are locals and  our next visit will be to Bachannal.   No system in tact.   Poor management,UNK
3598,"The windows and doors are boarded up. Apparently, it is closed!\n\nThere is no way to get any food. So, I would skip this one.",UNK
3599,"I am giving this 4-stars even though my cinnamon roll was 3-star because my husband and friend both demolished amazing omelet/egg dishes that they raved about! They had 4-5 selections for iced tea which was appreciated by our Texan friend, and the portions and pricing were excellent.",UNK
3600,I think this is the best place in Madison for Mexican food. I could be wrong but there really arent that many places and this one is pretty darn good.,UNK
3601,"I just think the staff here is wonderful!!!!\n\nWednesday hamburger is 50% off.....if you have never tried it....once you do, you will NEVER get it anywhere else!",UNK
3602,"Service at this location also leaves something to be desired!  And, the food, 'oh bf, please don't make me ever go there again!'",UNK
3603,This company is great!! Three pleasant and professional gentlemen arrived at our door less than an hour after we called. They efficiently removed our furniture and were on their way I would highly recommend this company!!,UNK
3604,I stopped in the Corner with a friend while walking around and watching the ice skating. The Corner is a great fun place in CityScape. It's next to the ice skating so I'd recommend you check this place out when you need a break.,UNK
3605,"If you are in Chinatown and want Filipino food, please go somewhere else this was probably the most bottom of the barrel Filipino food I've ever had in my life.  Disgusting and under seasoned.",UNK
3606,This was actually a very cool place with lots of not too overpriced product and a good sales section.  We especially liked the line of recycled product from Coke UK and the 'Coke Around the World' sampler (which we didn't try) was cool.  Much better than M & M world.,UNK
3607,"I love the blta wrap with spinach tortilla! Also the chocolate dipped cheesecake is super yummy. Bonus that they told me they'd deliver food to the hospital, because the hospital food sucks! Always friendly service here too. We really like it!",UNK
3608,I tried this place out because of a groupon deal and loved the varied classes and the warm instructors. Non-judgmental and friendly atmosphere.,UNK
3609,"New ownership, new vibe. Better service. A popular destination for those living in the Tukee Foothills. The food is good, the drinks are cold. The patio view is the best place in Ahwatukee to have a happy hour drink. $1 tacos on Tuesday can't be beat!!",UNK
3610,"Came thinking we could have a shake and frys, expecting to get refills on our fries was told they were franchise and they didn't Jane to follow the rules.",UNK
3611,"We have all had bad service before but this one tops all of our experiences combined. We will never recommend that anyone dine here, ever. We are all so shocked at the rude, snotty, dumb, slow, incompetent and careless service we received for my husbands birthday dinner.",UNK
3612,Glad to see you went back to counter ordering..  Like the matching shirts for servers..  Love the food and beer selection (croque madame is my favorite)..  Please please please do something about the flies.  they are ruining the place for me!,UNK
3613,I really want to like this place and have been here 6 or do times but food is very inconsistent and certain thing are expensive. Wish there were more options in the desert ridge area-,UNK
3614,I love this place. It's authentic. Excellent selection of Italian delicacies. It would be 5-star if they had Italian chefs in the kitchen--rather than cheap import chefs like the rest of AZ.,UNK
3615,"There was a wait at lunch, about 25 minutes give or take, definitely doable, though unnecessary because they had tons of tables. I guess they think that's acceptable to people so they don't pay for more waiters. The food was excellent and great quantity of choices. Very satisfied.",UNK
3616,"all dishes are kids size and expensive. they have great selection of dishes such as small bowl of talay soup for 18.00.our bill wa 140.00 for 2 person.ladies, don\""t take your men here if you want to save money",UNK
3617,I had a fabulous experience. I felt really taken care of and received a fantastic color and cut. They are having great deals right now ... Call and ask about them!,UNK
3618,this is the worst nail salon EVER. I sat in their chit for over 45 minutes and it wasn't until I was putting my shoes back on and getting my shit together that anyone bothered to attend me. terrible customer service,UNK
3619,"Stopped in on a Friday nite and was waited on by a terrific new bartender, Meredith. She was very prompt and personable. The broasted chicken is so good and you can't go wrong with their hamburgers either. This is a comfortable, friendly place to go.",UNK
3620,"Food wasn't bad, just wish their thai hot was actually hot. Excuse the criticism but this thai restaurant is definitely watered down in terms of authenticity.",UNK
3621,"I love Chipotle, but I am disappointed by this location. The first two times I went there with my husband in the past two months, my chicken in my bowl wasn't fully cooked and I finally took it back the second time. My husband's beef wasn't fully cooked either...not very appealing.",UNK
3622,"Fun atmosphere, great tasting small plates, nice selection of wine, friendly staff. The food is beautiful and delicious. We shared about 7 dishes between the three of us and were able to try a lot of yummy things plus have room for dessert.",UNK
3623,"Nice small little park, right beside some great restaurants. Grab some food to go and sit in the park, and enjoy your surrounds!\n\nGo Portugal!",UNK
3624,"the Kelly Warner law firm always delivers great results. They are surprisingly almost always available via Skype/phone/email. That is why I remain a client of theirs. Most of all, they speak tech/internet marketing and they got to work immediately on my case. These guys are the real deal.",UNK
3625,"Never ordering to go again! I tried the Cobb salad and received chunky old lettuce, turkey was gross and avocado was brown. I've eaten here years ago and recalled a pleasant experience. Definitely not ordering again!",UNK
3626,"Hidden gem that if forget about all to often for lunch. Two slices and a soda for 5.50, cheese or pepperoni anyway. No place to eat here so walk down the arcade or out to Bearden Park or across to the Plaza. Pretty close to NYC pie. Good enough for me anyway and I'm a Jersey guy.",UNK
3627,"Only go if your boss is paying for the bill!  Meat was great, aged 35 days, sides were hearty and the place was baller status!",UNK
3628,This is the BEST date place and just going out with friends place!! Food is yummo and the employees ROCK! I go as often as I'm able to get there.,UNK
3629,"Thought we'd give it a try but kind of regretting it now... The orange chicken was really dry, the broccoli and beef didn't taste very good, the fried rice tasted as if it was drenched in soy sauce... Will not do again.",UNK
3630,"Mmmm mmmm good!  The catfish was our favorite, but everything was soooo good.  Get the cornbread!",UNK
3631,I go here all the time. The spicy chicken parmesan sausages from the meat counter are awesome!\n\nWish they had a salad bar,UNK
3632,Good wine list ....all special imports !\n\nFood is tasty fresh and creative. \nClassics with a twist. \n\nGreat service and laid back.,UNK
3633,Food is good (from previous experience) but efficiency could be better. I waited outside for 20 minutes and ended up with nothing.  Too busy serving people on inside - why have an outside window if preference to those indoors?,UNK
3634,"Always you can count on tasty coal brick oven pizza. I like to add extra fresh Basil on thin crast pizza, great flavor!",UNK
3635,BEAUTIFUL! STUNNING! \nGood drinks. Good everything!\nSO PRETTY!!! Really amazing!,UNK
3636,Best bean dip. Best Mexican food on the west side as far as we are concerned. The prices were fantastic and the portions were huge. Our service was WONDERFUL! We will be making this one of our go to places.,UNK
3637,Great experience.  Best bang for your $$$$. I organized my brothers bachelor party of about 10 of us and everybody enjoyed it.  I would def do it again when I go back to Vegas.  Recommended to anyone looking to meet some new people or just have a good time in general.,UNK
3638,Me and a friend went here to get the Jack Daniels burger. The host was very quick and very nice. After being seated we looked over our menu and sat there and waited and waited and waited. After 10 mins of being ignored not one single staff member stopped and talked to us. What a shame and an embarrassment to have customers walk out.,UNK
3639,"Nice staff, really good coffee. A little sweet for my taste, but I'm sure I could ask for fewer pumps of flavor, they're super accommodating, and always make sure you like your drink. I'll be back for sure.",UNK
3640,I recently moved near Chizona and was excited to get a taste of Chicago. Being from Illinois I've had plenty of food from Chicago and was expecting the pizza to be deep dish but the thin crust style was still very good. I plan on trying more of their foods but as of right now I can say that the pizza is worth a try.,UNK
3641,"I work nearby so we eat at Giacomo's frequently. It is one of the best Italian restaurants that I have been to. From the Chicken Fettuccini alfredo to the HUGE individual slices of pizza, everything I have had from there is amazing! The staff is always so friendly. Highly recommend!!",UNK
3642,Was a pleased they had everything I needed and were very helpful when I needed help finding items only one register open but what do you expect at 1130 pm,UNK
3643,$600 for the 4 of us and I can't wait for the show to end so we could leave. Don't waste your money!!,UNK
3644,"The staff were really nice however our satay was very dry. The dipping sauce was good. We also ordered mixed meat with peanut sauce (which just tasted like melted peanut butter) and the yellow curry with beef (which ended up with a shrimp in it.) Not too bad, however not that great either.",UNK
3645,Great buffet especially for the price! We went to breakfast buffet for $7.99 with club card. OJ was good and great omelet bar. Several folks making omelets. We will be back! Short breakfast hours though M- Saturday (8-10am),UNK
3646,Terrible service for propane... Have tried three times  at different times over three weeks to  purchase and three times told to  wait 15 minutes! I keep trying just to see what the hell will happen next,UNK
3647,"Good sushi, tasted fresh both times I went\ndecent prices, (one price for lunch AYCE, one price for dinner) good service, and easy parking (in a shopping plaza) \noff the strip, but worth the drive. :)",UNK
3648,"Much prefer Ramiros!  Two times they have messed up my order.  :-(  This time, I order a side of rice (from 'sides' on the menu) & got a micro-side...like 2 tblspn.  Seriously!  They just don't seem to pay attention.",UNK
3649,"My husband and I were so disappointed in the tacos. Super plain and almost raw tortillas and the flavor was bland. We got the mahi and the grouper and both were not good. The price is affordable, but I would pay more for better flavor and quality somewhere else.",UNK
3650,"Such a fun place with great beer selections, and recently they've added liquor as well. The drinks are delicious and the service is amazing!",UNK
3651,Not cool waited forever the waitress threw the kitchen under the buss all through service. Food was ok but they need to space out the tables wait staff is overwhelmed,UNK
3652,"The OLD Planet Hollywood (as in formerly known as Aladdin) is just that - OLD.  I wouldn't stay here again.  \n\nNote: this is different from the newer PH Westgate Towers, which is actually nice.",UNK
3653,"Service was very good, food was ok--nothing memorable.  But I went with a large group and almost all of us got food poisoning, so that was kind of a bummer for the rest of the weekend.  I was in Vegas a month before and went to N9NE--way better.",UNK
3654,"This place was a little ghetto. Wait staff was trying to joke and be funny, but they came off as rude. Waitress smelled of smoke. Food was good and it came out quick.",UNK
3655,huge place lots of options like a pool. well really the pool is ok. lots of clases always lots of cars parked in parking lot. the tour was boring. dont think i would ever actually join them though even though the price is less.,UNK
3656,"Always have had friendly service here, both when we played Tuesday night Team Bingo (and it was busy) and when I stopped in for a Bills game (also busy).  Food is good, bathrooms and clean and they have an outdoor patio. Plus I can pay for my beer with my Bingo winnings! Can't  beat it.",UNK
3657,"I found my new waxing place! Clean (which is important!) friendly staff! 100% satisfied with my braziallian. I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND! Krys, my waxing lady was awesome!",UNK
3658,"Awesome, tasty Banh mi sandwiches, real deal Pho soups in a well decorated dining area. This is the prettiest pho place I have ever eaten where the taste of good food matches the decor! So worth it if you want wonderful Vietnamese food!",UNK
3659,This place is a oh ok nothing espectacular ! I will visit again when on this side of town love there wonton soup.,UNK
3660,My girlfriend took me here on our way through Charlotte during a recent vacation. Enjoyed it well enough although I can't say it was memorable. The atmosphere was very lively but it was a bit pricey. I'd go again though.,UNK
3661,Venue= 5 stars\nCrowd=Infested with Asians-1 star\nOverall=3 stars,UNK
3662,If you are looking for a dueling piano bar this is NOT the place. It is 1 musician at a time singing a song. How is that considered dueling?  There is no comedy in the show just basically someone singing an entire song. Will never come back.,UNK
3663,I bought an English garden and the design is such that each piece has to be taken out and watered individually; just plastic containers stuck in the basket.  One of the flowers died almost immediately.  Buy beware!,UNK
3664,"This place is always busy which is understandable since it is always good! We came on a sundayand we thought there would be a long wait but no we got in quick and our server Donna was awesome, attentive without being  a pest. The gumbalaya was ridiculously good! As always great job Egg Works!",UNK
3665,I was torn between this place and LGO but was at LGO for breakfast.  Pretty happy I picked Postino for lunch.  Sandwich selection was unique (Prosciutto with Brie) and the general ambiance during lunch was real nice.,UNK
3666,"This is my go to Costco.  I try to make it out of there with only diapers and baby wipes, but who are we kidding.  Costco is like Disneyland for adults.  So many items I have to have now!",UNK
3667,Food was fine.  Service was abysmal.  I thought we were on a hidden camera show it was so bad.  Aloof chick server who couldn't remember my order no matter how manny times I repeated.  Awful.,UNK
3668,"By far the best taxi service in Champaign. Friendly, punctual driver who didn't charge extra for all the additional stops we made! Definitely a refreshing change from the rude, hate-their-life taxi drivers in Chicago and New York. Would definitely recommend this service!",UNK
3669,"I go to Vegas buffets all the time, and this is the worst I've been to so far.  Just go across the street and go to Ceaser's palace and eat at the buffet there.  It's like 20 times better!  And it's like 10 bucks more -_-",UNK
3670,Great quick casual mexican chain that is consistently good no matter the time of day. I appreciate the brown rice option and the ability to always control exactly what goes in my burrito or bowl. The staff is always friendly and caters to all of the guests. Just wish that they had a whole wheat tortilla option!,UNK
3671,"It's fun to venture here on a Saturday afternoon or a weekday when you played hookie from work :x There are very interesting stores and restaurants to be found here. I'd name then, but there are so many I cannot remember the names of all of the little stores that i love. I'll update sometime.",UNK
3672,"Great gyros, especially the chicken gyro! I love their tzatziki too. Food is always up quick and the service is good. Their greek side salads are also very tasty.",UNK
3673,I only ordered pho there and wasn't impressed at all but I saw some other dishes other people were eating looked pretty good.  It gave me the feeling that it's a more Americanized joint comparing to the ones on spring mtn. I'm willing to try again.,UNK
3674,"Vanessa cut my hair on Sunday. It was the best haircut that I've ever had. To call her a mere barber would be an insult, she is a master at her profession. If you want a trully great experince while getting your hair cut, call Vanessa\n                             Vern Rettig",UNK
3675,Good steak because it is prime meat but not to a par....beautiful place.  Good service but not great service.....,UNK
3676,Katherine is a great resource for astrology readings and tarot readings.  I've had the pleasure of receiving both from her and have found the appointment fun and informative.  I continue to rely on Katherine when I feel that I need input to my life.,UNK
3677,"If you have a choice, stay at the one about one mile farther north. (14245 S 50th St) The rooms are nicer, and they have indoor corridors.  Might cost an extra $10/night, but it's worth it.",UNK
3678,"Great food, huge portions, waiter knowledgeable about ingredients. We'll enjoy this just as much as the takeaway as we did in the restaurant!",UNK
3679,"Perfect name, Terrible. So fitting. How many times are you going to turn down business you lazy creeps?... Again I say, as a business owner I feel sorry for this owner. He shouldn't be paying people to ruin his business.",UNK
3680,"The Fish Market, up until now, has been one of our favorite restaurants. They have a new chef as of the beginning of May and the difference is very apparent. Not so good any more.",UNK
3681,"Artsy place with a cool vibe. My wife and I went there for a nice lunch and that is exactly what we got.  I really like the contrast of flavors that we had in our sandwiches. Mango, cajun chicken, and avocado --MMM!! Delicous!",UNK
3682,Wish it was better. Wasn't sure the shuttle was going to show. It arrived 15 mins late. Guide did not top talking the entire trip. Spent to much time in lines.,UNK
3683,Ein alteingesessenes Haus am Platze mit leider eher mittelm\u00e4\u00dfigem Essen.,UNK
3684,"I was skeptical about this place, but I love it now. So many tasty options! I really like the veggie pita, they have a lot of good veggies for it.",UNK
3685,"It's an all you can eat sushi bar with an interesting marry go round of sushi available if you get the all you can eat. It's decent quality, for the price. The environment is nice, very spacious and fancy. I would recommend this restaurant for those looking for sushi in downtown mtl",UNK
3686,Parking is really bad. 30 min only one car moved. Never coming here again. Parking lot is very suffocating to be waiting for ever to get out.,UNK
3687,Excellent quality and value in a quaint setting.  Recommend the fish tacos and otro salad.  Will definitely return soon!,UNK
3688,"This was a truly terrible experience. There was a hair on my plate. They didn't explain the menu to us. The price was an outrageous hundred dollars for a brunch for two. And, to boot, the service was terrible. Never again.",UNK
3689,Been coming here since '06 and they still won't stock MGD. If it wasn't for the friendly staff and a few managers I would drink elsewhere .oh and the piped in music is horrible. Should of kept the juke box. Beer is over priced.,UNK
3690,Get the TLT with avocado - you won't be disappointed! I ate there once while visiting the area and it was great. I wish I had been able to try more offerings on the menu.,UNK
3691,"The owner made my spicy Italian sub, delicious! And \""he did build his business\"" too! Without Obamas help",UNK
3692,"Food is ok compared to some other pho establishments, customer service is great. The great perk is I don't have to drive all the way to China town.",UNK
3693,"In from DC and staying the Ballantyne Hotel, which is a mile away. \n\nAwesome sushi - sat at the Sushi bar where the chef provided a slightly spicy cucumber and crab salad, amazing!\n\nHighly recommend!!",UNK
3694,The food is money. The service is bankrupt! \n\nI love the food but our server was a joke she had no clue what was even on the menu. She moved slower that my 80 year old grandmother! Can you say airhead!,UNK
3695,"The food is great, portions are huge.  Our server left much to be desired (no eye contact), but that did not take away from the quality of the food.  And the bathrooms are unique.",UNK
3696,"The Gelato is nothing outrageous that calls for a $4 scoop range. The servers are great, the place has indoor and outdoor seating. If your grabbing grub from the pita place next door or getting out from the movies it's worth a visit. But don't come out of your way to visit this joint.",UNK
3697,This place is a gem for a local food lover... The plate lunches are awesome and the won ton min is huge!  The hotel it's located in is a dive but this is worth visiting.,UNK
3698,"Emily is Exceptional! We enjoyed spectacular service and fabulous food. The garlic fries were fresh-cut, delicious yummies. Enormous portions were highlighted by a grand selection of beers and hard ciders. Wished I had tried the pierogies for my first-time visit.",UNK
3699,Slow and expensive.  Told me 20 minutes for a new watch battery... took an hour.  And it was almost $100 for a watch battery replacement!  Way too expensive.  Wouldn't go back.,UNK
3700,"The price of bowling wasn't bad; the food was WAY over priced. They charged my organization $11/person for pizza and soda. It was a giant rip off. That was worth $6-7 tops. Overall, I wouldn't recommend them. Not worth the price we had to pay.",UNK
3701,Is it me or does the set up and decor remind you of a Soup Plantation? I'll leave it at that and let you come to your own conclusion about the food and service here.,UNK
3702,make sure you guard your belongings and valuables! there are many pickpockets lurking around Jean-Talon...I almost had my wallet taken out of my bag yesterday inside an epicerie,UNK
3703,"It was ok Italian food, but I've had better. The pasta was uninspiring. The family style dinner is a really good bargain, highly recommended for a group.",UNK
3704,Tierney is awesome! She was recommended to me from a friend and haven't been anywhere else. I get so many complements. I highly recommend her if you are look for the most professional lashes.,UNK
3705,Food pretty good and service not bad. Made a pretty good AMF that I enjoyed. \nFood portions are HUGE. You can order one thing and share it.,UNK
3706,"I agree, this place is awesome. I'm from Maryland and we don't really have any good seafood restaurants out here.  Anybody interested in live blue crabs and crawfish at lower prices should check out NVSeafood.com",UNK
3707,"Poor service, order was wrong ate half meal before found waitress to fix meal! Wasted 35$! Chicken was hard to cut with a knife!",UNK
3708,Fantastic brunch spot. Good coffee and great bloodies. Huevos rancheros are my favorite brunch dish here.\n\nPro tip: Mother's Day. Mom will flip her...stuff.,UNK
3709,The management of this restaurant treats it's employees like crap. The food is mediocre at best. The yogurt (or whatever it is) is no where near as good as Dairy Queen.,UNK
3710,"Small family business of true carrying his band and wife.  Quality is clear! We discussed ring designs, and it was clear they know what they were talking about and guided my unclear mind to what I truly wanted. \nOh, and they replaced my watch battery for free (first time)!",UNK
3711,I invented that awesome Brizza with the gravy and potato!  I love Scramble and their food is top notch.  I used to be a manager here and I can tell you that they use amazingly fresh food and they truly care about freshness and quality.  The food will be consistent and tasty every visit you have.,UNK
3712,"Food was out of this world!! We had a hard to please group, but everyone left more than satisfied. The wait-staff was also excellent!",UNK
3713,"Very impressed!  Learned a lot about how I run and which type of shoes will help my feet stay happy.  Very friendly and great customer service, also priced well!  Nice couple who are runners own the store, so go there and support a local small business!",UNK
3714,Read the reviews and was very excited to go there.....experience was nothing like the reviews.  Our one and only time there...,UNK
3715,My Tuna Melt was excellent as was the accompanying coleslaw.  The New England Clam chowder left much to be desired.,UNK
3716,"So good, so hip...I feel like I am not cool enough to eat/drink here but with food like that I can't/won't stay away. Love the tomato salad and the fez burger.",UNK
3717,"This place isn't too bad. If this restaurant were in California I would give it 2 stars, being that it's in Vegas I'm just glad there's a place for people who want healthier eats. The food was a bit bland but I'm sure I would visit again if I need something fast and healthy.",UNK
3718,"Dropped by here to watch This is The End.  The theater was huge, the screen was very clear and the seating was so comfortable.  I will definitely return here to watch a movie again if in the area.  Also, this place has bowling, pool and eateries.  Give this place a try if in the area.",UNK
3719,"What a horrible, nasty group that runs this little dive. They spend their time chasing away people who are seated at the gate - ie customers. Horrible.  Avoid.",UNK
3720,"Great food. Has a local feel, not quite dive-y but pleasantly local. Not unexpected based on the location. Went for the Bell's tap take-over for Mad-Craft-Beer-Week. Wife and I had the fish, right tastee.",UNK
3721,"Very cool place, like a fancy hotel room or something.  Many wines by the glass.  Excellent service.  Delicious food. Great romantic ambience.  Refreshing to see a restaurant go outside of the box for decorating. Ideal date night restaurant!  Get the baked alaskan banana dessert!",UNK
3722,I have visited this location many times and the food and service is always excellent. I have only ever ordered their Buffalo Chicken Pizza but the company I have visited with have ordered their salads and they said they were great! Plus you get plenty of food for your money. For an added bonus their pizookie's are awesome!,UNK
3723,"I went back this morning, same barista - different demeanor! :)  Friendly and helpful.  (She got me a drink carrier and the oatmeal the cashier forgot to give me).  Pleased and of course, I'll be there tomorrow. :)",UNK
3724,The sushi quality is really good! Depending on when you go it can be a bit busy but they are normally very quick with getting you in. The service is good and quick and I would recommend it for anyone looking for a good sushi place!,UNK
3725,I am dining with a long life long friend from New Jersey with a hip problem and he is being refused service because he cannot put his feet on the ground is like must be elevated. Gordon Ramsay I hope you're proud of the service you are providing,UNK
3726,The WORST delivery service ever!!! It was 1 hour and 50 mins before our order was delivered!! And YES it was cold!,UNK
3727,"This is really a locals type establishment. The owner, Dan is very talented and know pizzas. Everything I'd from scratch and tastes awesome. Oh, also if you're staying in a hotel on the las Vegas strip, yep he delivers there. Enjoy Seattle Dans. I sure did",UNK
3728,We LOVE LGO for breakfast! Their homemade English Muffin breakfast sandwiches are phenomenal. And their coffee is great. Perfect thing for my husband and I after an exhausting morning hike. We've also had some cupcakes and a red velvet cake from LGO and their desserts are to die for. Highly recommend.,UNK
3729,Love this place! Its very modernized. My husband and I always have a great time here and have attended several events at this place! Must go if you are in the Phoenix area,UNK
3730,"Great food, but service was ridiculously slow.  Three of us got our entr\u00e9es and the server went to get the fourth.  The three of us were nearly done eating by the time the fourth came.  But it tasted great!",UNK
3731,"Close at 3:00 on Wednesdays. WTF?  Driving there and back just took an hour out of my day. Yes, o suppose I should have.checked their hours before I left, but who closes early on a weekday?",UNK
3732,"I got the Club Mex and potato salad. It was tasty, but maybe a bit small for the price.  Service was reasonably quick.  I'll go back.",UNK
3733,"New bartender. Way better. Good specials for happy hour also. I'm going to keep trying this place. The mushrooms are good, but they NEED to be GREAT. They are a staple of the menu.\n\nLOVE that it is local and not a chain.",UNK
3734,Emylie Anders is awesome!!! Incredible colorist and hairstylist. She is the best stylist I've ever had and I drive 45 mins just to see her. Highly recommend,UNK
3735,"I was very disappointed tonight. I ordered through the drive through. Not only was my order incorrect, my burger was cold. I waited 25 minutes in line. There were 5 other cars behind me!",UNK
3736,"My favorite Starbucks in Mesa. It's not even the closest one to my home, but worth the experience. GREAT staff.",UNK
3737,"It's rare that you go to  out to eat with a group and everyone loved what they ordered. The clams were fresh, the shrimp were huge and even the simple spaghetti and meatballs was ta die for. I highly recommend this place.",UNK
3738,"Good pub faire in a decent setting. I had sliders with a fruit salad. All ingredients were fresh and tasty. My experience last week was good, with friendly and efficient service. Although, I was a single diner arriving at 2:20 pm on a quiet Saturday afternoon.",UNK
3739,The staff is extremely rude and the food is horrible. Do not come here! Tegian was supposed to put us in VIP but there is no such thing as VIP here. Horrible!!!!!! Said tbt need 10 people for a gift card but they would not include myself. I will never go back here,UNK
3740,"Worst experience ever with check-in at a hotel in Vegas. Everything is an extra charge and they hold $130.00 in advance for \""room incidentals or damage\"" and give you an attitude to top it off.",UNK
3741,"They will say anything to get your business. I was told it would take 2 hours for a detail job. Two hours later when I went to pick it up, it was at the end of the line waiting.  Now 4 hours later it still isn't done.",UNK
3742,"Usually pretty consistent however, took my mother in law and husband for lunch yesterday and they ordered the hot chicken sandwich on cibata bread. Bread was hard and to large for a sandwich and they had to remove it and eat without bread. Suggestion would be not to have that type of bread for a sandwich. Mine was good..",UNK
3743,"Excellent breakfast joint, Gaston and his crew are back. Service is exceptional and food is very good. Love the coffee thermos that they have for each table.  This place is clean and fresh. Same location as Chez Cora, but the food is better. Go and you be the judge.",UNK
3744,"AMAZING happy hour specials. We can get 2 pitchers of beer and eat all the food we want for about $20 on a Saturday afternoon. How can you beat that!? The food is simple and good, the staff is fast and friendly, and the patio is delightful.",UNK
3745,Food was bland and not very good.  Didnt even have any hot sauce.  Place could use an update on the decor as well...,UNK
3746,Very slow service and they weren't very busy. Decent food. Very loud inside.  Nice patio when it isn't hot.,UNK
3747,"Not very good overall, but pretty good for Tempe.  I do like the old house.  It reminds me of my grandmother's ranch house (a house on a real ranch, not a ranch-style house).  I don't like going to downtown Tempe.",UNK
3748,"i was considering giving this place 5 stars, but after trying out multiple flavors i have come to the conclusion that only their birthday cake flavor is really good so no. 4 stars only. not a must-go to place but probably the best ice cream there is around pittsburgh",UNK
3749,"Words cannot express how great Gals Walking Pals treated my dogs! I have the assurance that my dogs will be loved and cared for while I travel. Trustworthy,  professional, enthusiastic, and awesome girls,  great prices, and plenty of communication.",UNK
3750,Um scary...I live really close and only venture in for emergency sports bets..Super smokey and crap food. Skip it and drive to Aliante if in the area.,UNK
3751,"This is a very hit and miss kind of place. I once had the best haircut ever here and so I came back. I got a different stylist and I ended up getting the worst haircut ever. So, take your chances. The price is right and it is very convenient.",UNK
3752,Tip jar in the drive-thru window....real bad form! It's time the franchise management to make some changes.,UNK
3753,I been coming to XS for years and have never had issues getting in with pre sale tickets until lately. Seems like if you have pre sale tickets you will wait a long time. What's going on XS??,UNK
3754,"Pros \n- nice ambiance \n- delicious tacos, we all liked the chicken ones the most. \n- good salsa\n\nCon\n- only 1 waitress",UNK
3755,"It's a Nicholson's pub, so the food is only average. But the ambiance and location are fantastic, and really earn this place its stars. A great place to sit outside on a sunny afternoon and enjoy the passers-by.",UNK
3756,After going there every week since it reopened I was treated like dirt last week.  After being treated so poorly we were on our way and opened the bag to find an order that was wrong..... AGAIN!!!!,UNK
3757,"Not impressed. Maybe I came on a bad day, but the cookie I got was so doughy and just flavorless. Took a bite and tossed it. The brownie my friend got was okay-better than the cookie but still forgettable. Wouldn't come back here.",UNK
3758,"Fast service and literally portions so big you shouldn't be allowed to eat it. I've been there 5 or 6 times and have had something different each time and it's always pretty good. Awesome, amazing, 5 star salsa. I wish that was my meal.",UNK
3759,"Overpriced.  Went in duing happy hour and was charged full price, $11 margartia.  Food is OK.  There are a lot of other better places.",UNK
3760,This is a good lunch place...only been there twice and ordered a meatball sub both times but it was really good and too big for me to finish.  I'll definitely be back for that.,UNK
3761,Not bad.  Bagels were amazing and the only reason to really go.   The soup was okay but not that great.   The matzah balls were a bit hard.   Definitely a good bagel place.,UNK
3762,Their prices are pretty fair and the portions are huge. But it isn't really the best pizza in town and they have a few items that just tasted a bit bland (Pasta Pie).,UNK
3763,"This hospital is the best i have ever seen.  They are taking such good care of my mother. As well as all patients.  The oncology dept is the best, the friendliest ever.  Thank you",UNK
3764,"Awful! Rude employees, smokey as all get-up, and just because it's newer does NOT mean it's nice. Couldn't be further than a \""Vegas Casino\"". I will NEVER go back in a million years.",UNK
3765,everything we ordered was so good! and i called to place an order and it was so speedy for pick up on a saturday night..only 10 minutes!!!,UNK
3766,The owner was amazing! She was very sweet and gentle as possible since I am sensitive to pain. The atmosphere is very relaxing. She also showed me how to fill in my eyebrows to make them as smooth as possible! Great place to go!,UNK
3767,"After posting about the terrible service I received, today I received a check and a gift certificate.  Way to go Village Cleaners!  I feel better.  Could have been all avoided if they had just paid my cleaning bill, but this is nice.",UNK
3768,I read the reviews and tried the pulled pork and chicken with the hot n sweet bbq sauce and was impressed. I usually don't go to bbq joints because I leave feeling I could have had better at home.  Customer service was good too. Plus beer was $2. Ill definitely come back.,UNK
3769,"Great sales/finance staff! Smooth, easy car buying process. Horrible service department! Communication along with their customer service is terrible. Will not buy from again because of service department.",UNK
3770,I continue to get stellar attention and care- no matter the doctor or the day. So lucky to call this my healthcare provider- Mayo really IS a step above the rest!,UNK
3771,Own filed for bankruptcy. Locked the doors. No notice. Just left a note on the door. If you've preorder comics with Atomic Comics please contact Samurai Comics at (602) 265-8886 they have worked with Diamond to get your shipments.,UNK
3772,I have eaten here twice once for breakfast and once for lunch. And both times I have enjoyed the food that was made to order and the fast service. Big bonus is that Starbucks is next door. Yay!,UNK
3773,"Horribly slow here with food, and some items were just downright foul (eggs in the breakfast burrito).  Hot sauce in the plastic tube was good though, as well as the spicy tomatillo sauce.  No real drive-thru.  What the heck?",UNK
3774,"We had an event that HAD to look, feel and taste perfect . Denise not only delivered that but added her own special hands on help on site. Perfect!",UNK
3775,Loved the drinks but the service was horrible. We ordered an appetizer that never came (and was later put on the bill). I would rather just sit at the bar than deal with the server's attitude.,UNK
3776,Oh my gosh every time I come here there is always new stuff to look at.\nYou need to plan on staying for about 2 hours to finish look in at everything. \nI love this place. My mother couldn't believe all the stuff that was in here.,UNK
3777,Ordered the Hot n Ready Pepperoni Pizza.  It was not very good;  the pizza seemed to have been sitting in the warming oven for quite a while since the pizza was only lukewarm.  It wasn't piping hot like the ones we are usually used to getting in Henderson NV.  Service was very nice.,UNK
3778,One of my favs. The pizza is great and dessert pizzas are to die for. One of my go to spots for guests in town. Great cozy atmosphere for a date or just to catch up with friends.,UNK
3779,"This is one of the smaller Chipotle that I have been to. There aren't many indoor seating tables, and who really wants to eat outside in the Arizona summer? The staff is quick on the line so youre not stuck waiting too long.",UNK
3780,Restaurant is leftover over from the Old Days of Las Vegas. Server was pleasant but the over all service is completely disjointed. Service is below average for the price you are paying. Most of the items we ordered were very good.,UNK
3781,30 minutes for a burger that's not even cooked to the right temp? Waste of time and the burger had no flavor. Joke,UNK
3782,My wife and I have been going here for special occasions for MANY years now. The food and service here has always been wonderful. The Aloha hour is the best deal for an early meal.,UNK
3783,"We celebrated  my daughter birthday , we were promptly seated. Waitress was attentive at first . Our appetizers were mixed up the second order came 15 minutes late with no excuses the food was tasty, a little salty  .Our party liked the mac and  cheese however three persons were sick after  , portions were a little small",UNK
3784,Love this place. Flat fee of 60 for cash clients and an additional 15 for urine sample. Everyone was pleasantly nice and the drs assistant even gave me a couple samples for 3weeks. They were really fast too. 5 minute wait and 25 minutes with the staff. I would highly recommend this place. Great experience.,UNK
3785,"This is one of the better locations in my area.They're fast,efficient, and it beats the other alternatives in the area.",UNK
3786,"This place is a standard pub.  I love the green beer and the potato chips.  Murphy's Law is a place I go when I want some good happy hour prices and to watch some sporting events.  If you go wanting the same, you won't be disappointed!!!\n- Joey Pipes",UNK
3787,Don't go there in the afternoon. Apparently they stop brewing coffee hours before I got there because half of them were out and the other half cold. The sandwich may have been cooked that morning as well. So disappointed at this location.,UNK
3788,Went to watch a buddy play one night. I couldn't believe how clean the bathroom was. The place is set up pretty cool with a square bar in front of the stage with plenty of seating and a little dancing room in between. Cool little music venue.,UNK
3789,Room service again.. They said it would be delivered 45-1 hour ... It's been over 1 hour and 45 min.. And still no show. I called and said I didn't want to pay for the food and the manager only took off $6!,UNK
3790,I used to be a regular here... but not anymore.  I would say many locals place is better than here.  I can't believe some of the AYCE place's quality is better than here.  I think thats enough said..,UNK
3791,For a quick fast food healthy spot I like to head over tk this gem. Everything is so fresh and healthy! And the staff are super nice plus you can do a little shopping while your there ;),UNK
3792,Came for an early evening appetizer and a drink with friends.  Easily accommodated a party of 10 in the outside patio area.  Great server.  Fun atmosphere.  Great location actually.,UNK
3793,"I hated the tight squeeze of this place. It's small and annoying. The width of this place is like 8 feet, and the menu is boring. I did not enjoy my experience. It's too small to accommodate groups, or even small parties of 2 people.\n\nI would no bother considering this place.",UNK
3794,This place is great to hit the links for cheap. It is always fun to hit up Coronado for a twilight 9 in early summer. Course is on par with the fees but I still recommend it if you want to play on a budget.,UNK
3795,"Been in the neighboring stores and always saw a line running out of monta ramen. There are lots of ways you can do ramen, they have a limited selection.  The ramen choices they do have all delicious. But I'd have to say their fried race stood out the most to me",UNK
3796,"A fun sister date with my baby sister! You can upload photos from social media, your phone, email, whatever, and have them printed to look like polaroids while you check out the other gems the Linq offers.",UNK
3797,"Employees are very nice, but the toppings always seem low and the gummy bears are always hard. But one of the best yogurt shops in Chandler.",UNK
3798,"I have tried II Pizzaiolo twice now and I am not a fan. The food was very good but over priced and the atmosphere is stuffy and very loud. If you are looking for a relaxing night out, this is not the place to go.",UNK
3799,"Yep, it's a rock that has a hole in it. May have been more enjoyable except for the kids hanging out for a long smoke break. Plenty of other natural sights to spend time seeing.",UNK
3800,"I had one menu item... EVERYONE should have it... Frozen Hot Chocolate. YUM... I can't say anything else about this place ha. Cute atmosphere, staff was OKAY",UNK
3801,"Amber- I posted the review to the specific location, of course.  Jim at 1251 American Pacific Dr, Henderson, NV 89074.",UNK
3802,I just tried the Jersey Mike's in Salisbury and it makes these guys look like pikers. They should take a drive up there and see how they really should be doing things.,UNK
3803,"Terrible!! 2 star for this show is more than enouch, I don't understand why some people laugh  with the toilet paper at the end.",UNK
3804,What a cruddy airport. It's ugly and uncomfortable.  The food choices in the southwest terminal are awful.  At least it has free Internet.,UNK
3805,"Bill is the first person you want to call. After figuring out we had a problem with our pool, Bill was at our door within minutes. He worked efficiently to fix our problem and went above and beyond in terms of his service and hospitality - all at a great rate. I would definitely recommend Bill to anyone needing pool repair.",UNK
3806,"Had the Alligator sandwich with chow chow-AMAZING. When travelling into Cave Creek, skip the chain restaurant and eat where the locals go. You will not be disappointed with the menu.",UNK
3807,"Have like the tacos on previous visits. On 1 visit chicken mole, the mole sauce was burnt. Servers took off our bill. Service can be hit or miss. Nice place and large menu of tacos and more.",UNK
3808,"Great steak; great wine; great dessert.\nGreat post-Badger game experience!\nWaiter said they haven't had an open table since Wednesday, so make sure you have a reservation.",UNK
3809,"Food we ordered was good.  So much on the menu, it was overwhelming...felt rushed by the waitress to order.  We asked for 5 minutes to review the menu and she came back 3 times asking if we were ready.",UNK
3810,"Great little hobby shop.  Been going there for years.  Prices are competitive, can find stuff online a little cheaper but you get no support. Staff is friendly and helpful.  Some of the guys are not the most outgoing but they know their stuff.  I keep going back and will continue to.",UNK
3811,Great place to sit and drink wine on a Saturday afternoon where you have nothing better to do. Food's average. Lots of people watching which I  love. No indoor seating though so avoid when hot.,UNK
3812,"Todd at AP is great, brought a couple Chinese phones back to life for me. I never buy through the carrier, and with more and more device support overseas, it's nice to have walk-in, Apple Store-level service available for Androids at AP.",UNK
3813,I'm so happy you have come to Vegas Rita's! Just as awesome as I remember! None of the other places in town compare. Stay friendly and I will be returning very soon!!!\n\nAll you west coasters need to try out Rita's Italian Ice!\n\nDouble thumbs up!,UNK
3814,This buffet was pretty dreadful.... Im glad I had certificates from the Grandview next door because if I'd paid $30 to eat here I would have been peeved!,UNK
3815,"This is my first visit to this location, I have been to other locations and enjoyed the evening. The food was good , however the service was extremely rushed! The appetizer had barely been served when the entree followed. Not a very relaxing evening.",UNK
3816,"I have no real complaints about this buffet.  It was decent (way better than the buffet at the Luxor, even though the food was similar).  I wouldn't seek this one out, but if you are staying here, then it's worth the convenience for breakfast.",UNK
3817,"Great place to check out and stroll through all year round, especially in the Summer and Winter time when various festivals are taking place, the whole area just comes alive.",UNK
3818,"Cool spot in Central Phoenix to hang out and enjoy a tasty iced tea!  The inside living room was very comfortable and a great place to unwind and the outdoor seating is great for those cooler winter, spring and fall days.  Great service too!",UNK
3819,Excellent food! Rotisserie chicken and chicken sandwich were very delicious and quick to the table. Unfortunately the service was slow towards the end of the meal when we needed to jet. All in all this is great food to fill you up before or after a flight!,UNK
3820,"This In N Out location is one of the best i've ever been to! The lines are quite long, but the workers are quick in getting people's orders down and getting the food out fast!. The couple times i've been to vegas this is the in n out me and my friends go to before heading back to LA",UNK
3821,"We are locals, and this is the only buffet we will go to.  We like that they have small portions, so we are able to take a little of everything.  Very good food.",UNK
3822,We love this place!  Both here and the one on Paradise.  The prices can't be beat.  Every tapas we tried was absolutely delicious.  We try and come here every time we visit Vegas.,UNK
3823,"Sky Harbor is overrun with Burger Kings. Been to a few of them and they're all the same, pretty much. It's just like any other Burger King, which we all know is the king of burgers. But this one is in an airport. That makes it so much more exciting!",UNK
3824,"I have never ever had a bad meal at Chef Pucks places.  This was a great experience too.  Everything very fresh.  Had 3 apps- pizza, calamari, bruschetta and the pumpkin cannolis -  all I can say is wow-excellent and since I am a professional chef too, it should mean for something.",UNK
3825,"Doesn't get any better. Talk about a world-class Spa.\n\nBeautiful, relaxing and clean.",UNK
3826,I've been taking my car there for all major repairs and replacements. They do excellent work! \nThank you R&R,UNK
3827,I went here for a VI Peel and left feeling great.  My skin just kept feeling more and more firm each day after treatment.  I could not believe how competent and relaxing the medical estatician made me feel.  The price was right and I intend to go back again for another treatment soon.,UNK
3828,"I LOVE THIS HOTEL! \n\nThe rooms are so spacious and its a little ways down the strip but when you don't venture too far to go to the clubs like I do, it's perfect!  My favorite places are near this hotel so it works out.",UNK
3829,"I have been to the buffet twice the last time in June 2011, hated it both times. Friends say it is better now so I will give it one more try. Everything else about the HOTEL  is great.",UNK
3830,Pretty good dim sum. Hot and sour soup was just OK. Pot stickers were pretty good too. Nothing to write home about but WAY WAY better than Zine.(the atmosphere was much better at Zine but I will take food over atmosphere anytime!).,UNK
3831,"I really, really like it here. The staff is friendly, attentive, greets you as you walk in and the food/drinks are great! I think the old movies playing add a nice touch, too. I'll definitely be bringing all my out-of-town guests here.",UNK
3832,"Super nice staff! Helped us find a dinner reservation on a Friday night. Nice wine selection. Music is a tad loud, but still had a great time.",UNK
3833,"This place shouldn't be compared to Cold Stone and/or other establishments using heavy cream. It's a great place for vegans and they have a multitude of flavors that aren't so mainstream. Every place has there negatives, but this place has a lot of unique positives. Thank you for the great ice cream!",UNK
3834,"Excellent ambience, almost like being in Paris again.  Great food, loved our entrees and had a great chocolate mousse for dessert.  Wine selection was really superb.  Will definitely be returning in the near future.",UNK
3835,"The Venetian is extremely large and confusing to get around. You will need 2, maybe 3 elevators to get to your room. They charge alot of money and dont treat their guests well. I asked for ice and they never brought it up. I asked a second time and the woman said to get it myself.",UNK
3836,Called to get directions and ER told me to figure out myself. Was in an emergency situation. Asked for the manager she got on in 10 minutes. Didnt seem to care either. NEVER GO THERE.,UNK
3837,Had to call twice and sit on hold for 10 minutes for them to rudely tell me they don't have the item in stock. I will never visit this location based on that call.,UNK
3838,I don't know if the owner changed but the service was horrible. We had to keep asking for our hot tea. It didn't come until we were half way done with our meal.,UNK
3839,A SINCERE FIRSTHAND EXPERIENCE: SHORT PG ABRIDGED VERSION OF MY REVIEW:\n\nDiscrimination. You've ruined my weekend.,UNK
3840,LOVE this place. I love supporting local businesses. Delish coffee and great service...what more can you ask for?!,UNK
3841,A little cold in here. They used to have $9.99 lunch buffet all you can eat was a good deal and good food.  I love the stir fried squid dish and Kalbi dish and of course all the kimchi.  Staff is better than last time I was here.,UNK
3842,Grade A quality food as well as quantity. Always good service. Love the place.\n\nWhenever you step in they smile and make you feel welcome. \n\nMUST TRY: Spicy fried rice. You pick your level of spicy from 1-10.,UNK
3843,"What's up with the hype? I thought it was pretty good but not that good. I thought the price was too expensive for the quality of food there. I think it's because beer and wine are included in the price. But if you're not drinking alcohol, is this place worth the money and wait?",UNK
3844,It was  decent  However  I did get charged  incorrectly  each  month. I addressed the issue each month and nothing  was solved I was still being forced to pay the extra $25 dollars. Other then that the staff was half on the friendly side and the property was decent.,UNK
3845,"Ah one of the most consistent chains I've been to.  Always have to go to a Capriottis when i'm in Vegas.  No matter which location I go to, the sandwiches taste same.  Favorites are the Bobbie, and the Cheese steak with everything.",UNK
3846,"Same experience again today. I did a careful check of the interior before driving away and noticed a few areas they missed. Not just 'left a few spots,' but completely missed with the towel. I hate that they just don't get it right from the start.",UNK
3847,I guess I'm spoiled in CA since I have more options.  The yogurt was too icy and the flavored ones were not tart enough.  This is nothing compared to Pinkberry.,UNK
3848,Not my scene at all.  I think it's a former home that's now a bar/restaurant/lounge? Very crowded and limited street parking.  Heard that the food was good but there was literally nowhere to sit let alone eat.  Also there was a foul odor.,UNK
3849,OUTSTANDING!\n\nThe work done by Joel is exceeded only by his honesty. Great prices and you are always kept in the loop as far as what will/is/needs to be done.,UNK
3850,I went Saturday with my best friend and the food was very good but the service was fantastic. Fun and friendly employees. I will be going back.,UNK
3851,"I have eaten at this location a couple of time. The food is always fresh, hot and cooked the way I ask.  Service is excellent.  I will be back :)",UNK
3852,"It's awesome, lots of douchebags to choose from!  hahaha.\n\nMakes me miss the old school Korean clubs, that was fun.",UNK
3853,"I really enjoy this place.  It is in a romantic little house.  It has a great wine list and the pizza is really good.  I think the pizza compares to Bianco's pizza, but you don't have to wait several hours to eat.  Big plus in my book!",UNK
3854,Excellent service and delicious rolls! Haven't done the Teppanyaki yet but it looks and smells amazing...I may have to sneak a sit at the Tepp table on way out! Highly recommend!,UNK
3855,They have great flavors. Anything with hazelnut is really good. With a small size you get to choose two flavors. A lot of non dairy options too.,UNK
3856,"What is this place?? What happened to the good old days of the dive bar bowling alley???  I want to drink beer, swear and bowl.  This place is so expensive and too many damn kids running around.",UNK
3857,Great place for a great cause! Always have new and interesting items for super cheap! They even have deal days that certain items are discounted. I would say we go once a week just to check it out. I never find to many clothes options but for the rest of the house it's totally a great place!,UNK
3858,"Loved that everything was clearly very fresh and looked adorable. Not such a big fan that much needs to be ordered in advance and the brownie I bought was way too sweet. Good, but not overly impressed.",UNK
3859,So disappointing-  After two visits both times the chicken and shrimp were terrible.  Shrimp were overcooked and chewy while the chicken was overdone as well. The veggies and rice are fine as so are the sauces.  \n\nFriendly quick service but the quality isn't there.,UNK
3860,"If you're looking for a Real Estate agent who you can count on Dave's your man.  He's knowledgeable, honest, and VERY patient.  Buying a home can be stressful. Having someone who's truly in your corner watching out for your best interests is really important.  Dave's that someone.",UNK
3861,"The deep dish pizza was the best I have ever had. The chicken wings with the buffalo sauce were delicious. Good food, not bad prices, I'll be going back soon.",UNK
3862,"Quite the rudest little woman who runs this explained she couldn't sell me the Valentine card in the window because it was out of stock! I explained I could reach the one I wanted as she couldn't, I was then told nothing in the window is for sale it's all for display. Ridiculous ! Will not return",UNK
3863,I used to like this place until my friends cars starting getting broken into at this location. Ghetto!! Last time I went they charged me $4 for a tiny portion of uneaten rice off of halibut hamachi. I took it out of her tip and won't be returning here again.,UNK
3864,Yuk. Sorry but the food was awful. Tried Nicks three times now & won't be back. The service was really bad too. I really wanted to like this as it's so close to my house.,UNK
3865,"Went for lunch, the food was okay, chicken kabbob were salty and broiled. The pita had 4 medium pieces of chicken and lots of  lettuce, and pickle with the yogurt sauce. I had hoped for better flavor and more meat (protein). Back to Sabas or Persian Room for lunch.",UNK
3866,Im not sure how this was the best thing I ever ate On foodnetwork. Bland chicken. Overly salty greens and the mashed potatoes taste like a combo of powdered and fresh. So disappointed. .. So sad.... I looked forward to this.,UNK
3867,"We had fun, we found special rate online, which was great deal in strip.  Our room inside of the pyramid was OK but I was not comfortable the elevator moves side way...  We went pool, it was nothing special feature.",UNK
3868,This buffet sucks.\nBad food... Crappy selection...\nAwful! \nSave your cash for something that doesn't totally suck balls!,UNK
3869,"A basic burger, add overpriced because it is vegas.\n\nThen for good measure throw in some snobbish hostess types at the front of the restaurant and you have a recipe for annoyance.\n\nI have had just as good at Red Robin, so not a \""must visit\"" place.",UNK
3870,"well I think this place is ok. I come here every year for christmas eve and get drunk with my crazy family,the jacksons are somewhat famous in this place. the food is quite good! its a shame Nel J had such a bad experience!! drinks are too expensive though!",UNK
3871,"This place does not even deserve one star, pure filth.  If you like flys, dirt, grease, bad drinks and even worse food give this place a try.  Where is Chef Ramsey when you need him.",UNK
3872,"The people are fairly friendly, the gas is over priced. The car wash is absolutely terrible, it didn't take one piece of dirt off of my car, and I paid for the rainX wash. Very disappointed.",UNK
3873,"The food is outstanding. Their hours are wrong, they aren't open on Monday's right now.\n\nEdit: They are now open 7 days a week. Increased the rating to 5, I love the food but I was very unhappy to drive there when they were closed. Hoping it doesn't happen again.",UNK
3874,I really like this place.  They seriously need a bigger restaurant though.  It's so hard to get a group of people over 3 or  more in there.,UNK
3875,"one of my favorite restaurants for atmosphere.    great food, great service.....  love love love the pomegranate mojito!  Awesome happy hour.",UNK
3876,"Tourist spot only. Unless you're there for the deep fried twinkies/oreos.\n\nIf you're gunna stay overnight, I'd recommend the Golden Nugget. It looks awesome inside. & they've got a beautiful swimming pool for lounging & eating.",UNK
3877,They finally closed. I believe this was the first A.J.'s in Arizona......and the past few years it slowly went downhill.,UNK
3878,"I love this place!  The food is good and the portions are huge.  I always get the brown sugar banana pancake  and it is so sweet, you don't even need syrup.  There is a wait on weekends, but I think it is worth it.",UNK
3879,Amazing food and excellent service. It really made my getaway special. Recommend any pizza! Of course the chocolate cake to end the meal was a must and did not disappoint. Great portion sizes and the prices were extremely reasonable! Would recommend this place to anyone heading to Montreal!,UNK
3880,Came here for food and everything was pretty disappointing. Nothing exciting And nothing tasty. \n\nWouldn't come back for food but the desserts and goblet drinks looked pretty cool and elaborate!! \n\nMay come back for drinks only next time.,UNK
3881,"Very nice place, food looks good and also taste good but not great. It's a bit bland but prefer this healthier alternative  to the usual lunch spots around town.",UNK
3882,The wait staff needs an attitude adjustment. Hardly friendly or attentive. As if we were a bother. And all we needed was bottled beer. Hate to think what would happen if I ordered an app.,UNK
3883,"Hands-down, my favorite local brew. They have a really wide selection and a cool bar set-up. It is a great place for a weeknight pint or a weekend hang-out with friends. I will definitely be a regular!",UNK
3884,The SoHo Gourmet food cart is so yummy. The So Chick dumplings are my favorite. The salads compliment the dumplings very well. Love that new rice boxes are being offered this year. I had a sample of the rice today. It was really good. I knew I should gotten out earlier.,UNK
3885,Night crew sitting around too lazy to work. Why is the open sign on at midnight?  Why are posted hours till 1am. Bad franchise owner obviously doesn't care,UNK
3886,"Loved it!  The place is small, friendly, and unique.  Being from the south, this was a different kind of eatery than we normally frequent .  Very neat to be in such a wonderful city, with the taste of the city so evident.   Must try if in Pittsburgh.",UNK
3887,"I will never go back. The service advisor there James is rude, cocky and insulting! This guy is a money hungry shark who try's to sell unneeded repairs. He is the reason that automotive repair facilities have a bad reputation. The once good Hi-Tech Car Care name is now ruined in my opinion.",UNK
3888,The service here was great!  They had me in and out in no time and were so helpful.  I only had time for a hydro massage but going back next week for a real check up.  My co- worker went also and loved it and my step dad swears by them!  CHECK THEM OUT!,UNK
3889,"Food is alright. Service is garbage. You would expect a lot more from a place with the kind of prices they have. If anything, the food is what gave it the 2 stars...",UNK
3890,Saw Iron Man here and really liked....the movie!!  The theater is just ok.  Nothing great or terrible but I'd go to Rave at Town Square any day of the week over this place w/ Red Rock coming in 2nd.  BUT..gas is expensive and this was the closest place to home.,UNK
3891,Yum Yum Yum!!!  Service and food were wonderful!! Keep up the good work. We will be back!!!,UNK
3892,"Not nearly as good as Russian groceries in other cities.  Some bakery items are stale depending on turnover. Vegetables are hit or miss,  But some items worth the trip. Husband and wife owners could be friendlier. Speaking in Russian helps.",UNK
3893,"Middle eastern/arab friendly coffee shop, the guy behind the counter was rude, not respectful and unfriendly, I'm sorry, I'll go elsewhere on the Plateau spend my money or in the Mile-End with the hispters! My americano was good though. Free wifi here!",UNK
3894,"Amazing Breakfast, eggs were perfectly cooked, hash browns were delicious, and the French toast was amazing, crispy on the outside and soft in the inside. Yummy!!!",UNK
3895,"Small store, aquarium section has a very minimum number of salt water items.  If you need anything more than food, or extrememly basic items, you may want to consider another pet supply store",UNK
3896,"Two visits in one week (last week)! Big servings, quick and friendly staff, cozy atmosphere. The price is great, too.\n\nIf you like coconut dishes, check out the Red Thai Curry with Chicken.",UNK
3897,Loved their freshly made pizza. They make it right in front of you with all the ingredients you want. I had the Margharita Pizza with ricotta and olive oil.  Food was awesome and I really liked their Yelp check in deal. I got free dessert with my pizza.  Will be coming back for more.,UNK
3898,"We take the family here all the time. This restaurant is one of the best on this side of town. Usually crowded, fresh ingredients. Kids like the garlic noodles but I always get the filet mignon pho with lots of grandmas special peppers (you have to ask for them!).",UNK
3899,Good until about 12 hours later when you spend the next day blowing up from both ends from food poisoning.  PT noodles in Goodyear is much much better....,UNK
3900,"Very courteous service, very delicious cuisine, and a very phenomenal experience over all. I highly recommend if you're on this side of town and need pizza.",UNK
3901,This starbucks doesn't live up to the standard of the starbucks name. Each time I have been there my drink has either been made wrong or poorly. The location doesn't seem to be prepared for their morning rush. I make the extra drive down rural to go to another starbucks to get my coffee.,UNK
3902,"we checked in at 6am and it was clean\n\noh, and it cost $57 for two beds including taxes\n\nthe other things i dont think i could speak for",UNK
3903,Staff is kind of rude and ignorant. Eating here is definitely a last resort at the Bellagio but I just needed to grab a quick sandwich to go. I ordered a tuna sandwich and it actually was pretty good and I got it quickly so I did achieve my ultimate goal of healthy food to go in a hurry!,UNK
3904,"Not the cleanest place on Earth, but not the dirtiest either. The staff, from my experience, are ignorant, unfriendly, inattentive, unconcerned and sincerely useless at times. They will walk right through you if you let them. It's Walmart.",UNK
3905,Never go here!  They are rude and do a horrible job.  There are equally as cheap places that do a far better job and you might actually enjoy your time.,UNK
3906,"Be careful if they walk around with a pan of cupcakes offering them.\n\nyou may think it's a nice gesture from the restaurant, but if you take one, its $2\n\nTotally uncool.",UNK
3907,The burgers are not that great. The quality of meat used is not great. AJs off FLW & Pinnacle Peak has way better burgers. Salted Carmel milkshake was good. Definitely would not give this another chance.,UNK
3908,"Always come here with no expectations in my food and somehow it exceeds to be lowered when I receive my food.\nTip! Always ask for ketchup and ketchup cause they'll never throw any in the bag.\nBut, it's McDonald's and all are the same.",UNK
3909,I used to like this place but for the past 4 months I've gone in 3 different times for an eyebrow wax and was told to come back that they're too busy. Different times of days on different days. Absolutely ridiculous and I'll take my money down to the place by Safeway.,UNK
3910,"Good gym. Large, clean and plenty of classes. Everyone has a good attitude and are willing to help the recreational \""athlete\""",UNK
3911,Mama Gina's - well I will never come back here again ! We'll order honey hot wings ! No honey whatsoever ! Sent back to kitchen all they did was put more sauce on wings ! Pizza was grease as can be - it's not New York pizza ! Service was fine ! Food is very poor !,UNK
3912,"Place was hard to find, but the food was really good. I got the pepperoni-carne asada panini and was quite pleased.",UNK
3913,"READ THIS ONE!!!\n\nJust wanted to remind everyone how bad this place is.  It's like a beautiful woman with a sadistic streak and expensive taste.  Fun to watch from a distance, but unless you are a masochist who enjoys paying for abuse, avoid.",UNK
3914,"Love this place reminds me of Naples ! It is not your American pizza ( which I like too! Chicago,NY,and Boston style) but its like being back in Italy.Thank you!!!",UNK
3915,"Pretty darn good, odd ordering system but once you do it it works pretty good. A lot more options than a subway . They are open on Sundays even though yelp says they are closed",UNK
3916,"compared to the locations in missisauga and toronto, the waterloo Burriot Boyz was not up to par, maybe because its so new, it just seemed a lot less tasty then other locations.",UNK
3917,"Good things: free entrance for ladies on Saturday night and free drinks until 11pm. The DJ was good, though it was mostly 80s (Michael Jackson) and top 40 hits. Nothing too overly great about this place. Any other night, it's $20 for ladies to enter.",UNK
3918,My husband and I just stooped in real quick to pick up some fish to go. \n12-26-10 at 1:30 PM after some after Christmas shopping. The young lady did not add any condiments to our to go bag and when I asked she was rude to me. My husband now refuses to go back again.,UNK
3919,"Love this place. Very down to earth and friendly environment. Everyone greets you including the chefs. Food is amazing and super fresh. AYCE is the way to go! If I could, I'd eat there everyday!",UNK
3920,Came all the way from California to try her queso tacos.. DELICIOUS... would definitely come again.  Service was great.,UNK
3921,YummyTori is one of my fav places but was sadly let down last Friday evening through very very very slow service. Food as ever was yes yummy (bento box set meal is a great deal ) but c'mon you guys can do better!,UNK
3922,"the root beer is worth six stars, the food, worth four, the fact that they won't let me eat my lunch while sitting on the John Deere- one.  overall a nice four. let me sit on the tractor next time, and I'll bump it to five.",UNK
3923,"Super Sicilian and the Meatball subs are amazing, the only draw back is the burnt bread funk you'll sport the rest of the day.  Not recommended for folks that claims they don't go out for lunch. :)",UNK
3924,This quiznos is not good to go to. They are rude and the sandwich sucked...DO NOT GO HERE!,UNK
3925,"My experiences with this location is their service is usually really slow. Although, the pizza is always good, and they usually have some good deals.",UNK
3926,"The food is out of this world.  The cocktails are to die for.  The noise level is unacceptable.  I will only return if I get a table outside.  We were at the bar having dinner, we were screaming at each other.",UNK
3927,Love this shopping center and feel lucky to have it be so close to home. The selection of restaurants at all price levels is great! The shops have a nice variety. Movie theater is large and always playing something! Some of the stores have closed down but overall a perfect outdoor shopping center!,UNK
3928,"Everything about this place is brilliant. Wouldn't be surprised to see them pop up all over the country, it's that fun (and delicious too). Hope one comes to Dallas, Tx, because I won't be back in NC for a while.",UNK
3929,"Farmers market? Would have loved to go, but we didn't get into town until after noon and it was no where to be found. Was really looking forward to cheese curds squeaking in my mouth, now I just have a bad taste in my mouth about the entire thing. Update your website already!!",UNK
3930,Wowowowowowow really good fresh sushi get the deluxe sashimi dinner choices hand picked by sushi chef :),UNK
3931,"Fantastic meal, I had Scallopine Funghi e Creme (Veal with Mushrooms in a cream sauce) and my girlfriend had the Pollo Fungji e Creme (Chicken).   The service was very friendly.  Main course was amazing cannot fault it, will definitely go there again.",UNK
3932,LOVE the love cakes.... yummy.. I  have been back each time i come into town on business to eat here and have brought friends to enjoy them also...so delicious!,UNK
3933,"This review is only for the HOA.  The condos are quite nice.  It is dealing with the HOA that makes living here almost unbearable.  Arrogant, entitled, and dismissive does not even BEGIN to describe these people.  Do not even attempt to expect \""service\"" from these people.  Utterly awful.",UNK
3934,"Was just on dirty dining! So nasty! Las Vegas, NV (KTNV) -- One of the most famous Chinese restaurants in town was shut down after a strongly-worded health inspection.",UNK
3935,"One menu item...  Bob's (Organic) Bad Breath Burger...  You just HAVE to order this!!  Living up to its name, you will have bad breath for the rest of the night.  :)  But, it's definitely well worth it!!",UNK
3936,Kinda pricey at 30 a head to look at some wax statues. Sure they are realistic but it really wasn't our cup of tea! It's 2hrs of my life I wish I could get back!,UNK
3937,Got another mani/pedi today.  Mani was much better today.   Go see Kevin !   He is awesome!  He shaped up my nails very nicely. Much better than the person who did my mani last time. Love this place!! I will be back to see Kevin.,UNK
3938,Order the Taste of Italy Special pizza.  It is awesome!  We love this place and it is close to us. I was expecting to drive for miles for a decent pizza. This place rocks!!!  Great employees and a happy place for dinner or take out!,UNK
3939,"My favorite is their Stir-Fry rice noodles with chicken & vegetables, their Vegetarian Pho and the make-yourself-spring rolls. Absolutely delicious! Great service as well and their prices are pretty decent.  I've tried many Vietnamese places in Charlotte and this is by far one of my favorites.",UNK
3940,"Surprisingly good black bean burger - firm and decent flavor.  Served on a whole wheat bun by default, which was nice, and came with very good guacamole on top.  I was able to ask for no cheese to make it a vegan treat, and it was delicious.  My son loved his regular burger too.",UNK
3941,Cupcake sofficissimi si sciolgono in bocca! !!  Da provare il peanut butter chip!!! Ottimo modo per iniziare la giornata! !!,UNK
3942,"My wife had her iPod stolen from her car by the \""replacement\"" employees today. The manager had the nerve to tel her \"" how do we know you had one in the car?\""  \nWe are 21 year customers. We will never return and suggest no one do business with people without integrity or character.",UNK
3943,"horrible service the whole staff cares less the food  is not that good at all the signatures burgers are a joke, McDonalds have better burgers",UNK
3944,"Great food , priced very reasonable and we were in a bit of a rush to see a show so the staff was very accommodating. Great atmosphere and best of all an incredible selection of Italian beer on tap",UNK
3945,"Great place to see some movies.  They did mess-up one night and it took 45 minutes to decide they could not get it working.  Some screens have lights around them, that sucks a little.  Overall, can't beat it.  Much better than a theatre.",UNK
3946,"Nothing out of the ordinary - The burgers are pretty good. The service is a hit or miss depending on where you sit (inside or roof top). Yes, they have a nice roof top seating. If you haven't been here before - the place is the old Red Room - and basically the settings are exactly the same.",UNK
3947,"Great place, clean place. Last time stay there, bathroom kinda moldy..iu...not a great scenic. Still great place, awesome people. Eat @ their sushi restaurant, its ok food, price little high but u know its turist town...good time",UNK
3948,It's a nice venue but the music is played out and the girls are all stuck up.  Who goes to a club to just stand there with your over priced martini and stare down every girl you feel is your competition.  I showed them the Jersey attitude for sure!,UNK
3949,Went here 4/11/14 for a jazz show. Great location/nice showroom/plenty of parking/great crowd/good service and wow what a good show.   Drinks were reasonable and we'll poured.  We will definitely be back.,UNK
3950,"Everything was great until I saw our waitress sweep up a mess on the floor from another table then swept the seat of the chair.  Oh and she was having a conversation with her manager at the same time, and he didn't say a thing about it! Gross! Is that how they clean off the tables too!?",UNK
3951,"Ambience is great. Love the band and dj on Friday and Saturday nights. Food is ok. The service, however, is horrible. Been going there for a few years and the service keeps getting worse (with the exception of Mike).",UNK
3952,Luigi's pizza is amazing! The sicilian pizza takes me back to how my grandma used to make homemade pizza. I can't wait to go back - definitely worth the 45-minute trip there :),UNK
3953,Great Mexican food for the price. Esteban is a very courteous waiter. The gringo dip is a frat choice for an appetizer.,UNK
3954,This place has a different spin on doughnuts. We went one evening and they weren't busy but it took a good 20 minutes to get a dozen to go. The doughnuts were ok but nothing that I would have to go back for,UNK
3955,"Good just got better. We've been going to Jamms for years, as we love their large selection of yummy omelettes and their pot of bread. We went a couple of months ago and learned they now have cinnamon raisin pot of bread. Yum!",UNK
3956,Regular customers.  Like the food but went in tonight while it was busy and got horrible service- from the owner no less!  It's on thing to be busy but to be blown off like we were was very disappointing.  We probably wont go back.  Definitely won't recommend.,UNK
3957,"Best. Food. Ever. But only open until 4:30pm! And not Sundays either. \n\nRegardless, the Akin's plate has to be one of the premiere bang-for-your-buck meals on State Street.",UNK
3958,I enjoed the Gilbert Rd location and this 1 did not disappoint. Homemade bread and wraps cover fresh sandwiches.Try the mushroom phyllo appetizer. Sandwiches burgers and pizza but higher quality. Excellent healthy choices including a GREAT veggie wrap. Service very friendly,UNK
3959,"Good food, clean and friendly service. The prices are a little  high for what you get, but this is one place everyone in our family can agree on.",UNK
3960,"Born and raised in Japan, this place has great curry. !!!!!   tonkatsu was little bit under fried in my opinion(Tonkatsu kiyoshi does better off course).   If you love the curry, this place is the best in vegas.",UNK
3961,"The store is not very well kept and the employees aren't very attentive, you are kinda invisible there, even when checking out or asking a question, they don't look at you or act like they are paying attention.  Cute stuff and great clearance though.",UNK
3962,i love this locations of priscys she has been cutting my hair since i was a young adult and it grows so fast and pretty thank you,UNK
3963,They were renovating on the main floor so part of the hallway was taped off and there was a strong smell of paint. Room was fine. Bed was ok. My room had very low lighting which was annoying at night. The hot tub was great. Didn't try breakfast.,UNK
3964,"This shop is wonderful, it's a clean and fun environment. G does a great job. I let her get creative with my nail art....and as always they look gorgeous!  I am consistently getting compliments. She also waxes my eyebrows and they are always perfect!",UNK
3965,"This place has grown on me.  Delicious Fish and Chips, awesome drink specials, and their Waldorf salad is fantastic.  Service can still be  bit iffy, but overall, I have enjoyed my time spent here.  Worth a try for sure.",UNK
3966,"No real complaints. The room was nice and clean, had all the amenities you could ask for. Not sure if it was just this weekend but it was definitely a young and rowdy crowd. It seemed like everyone was here for a bachelor or bachelorette party and it was crowded even today on Monday. Would definitely stay here again.",UNK
3967,I love this Jack in the Box restaurant because it's not so busy all the time. They have polite employees & quick customer service.. It's also  very clean,UNK
3968,"Best Mediterranean food in the valley, the gyro's are the best.  Service is great, even when they are out the door with customers.",UNK
3969,"Very high prices, you can find prices 10 - 30% less online with free shipping and zero sales tax!  I cannot understand why anyone buys at these high price retailers unless they want to give away their money and charity would be a better cause helping homeless animals!\n\nWayne Gorsek",UNK
3970,"This place is ok. My food was adequate, service was pretty decent but nothing about it really blew me away. I don't think I'd eat here again with Satara right down the road though.",UNK
3971,Awesome dessert place... My and my husband couldn't think anywhere else beside this place when it comes to dessert. A must try one,UNK
3972,"Not sure what's going on, slow service many of their own beers out of stock on a slow Sunday evening.\nFood was so slow I cancelled my entr\u00e9e and left.",UNK
3973,"People that know me know that I am really not a huge fan of pizza so, I went to Grimaldi's not expecting much because it is always the same. Wow I was wrong here. Great thin crispy but not too crunchy crunch with great wood fired taste. Very good.",UNK
3974,"High Quality Service, I believe is the best.  David Biever, The owner of the company is honest, reliable, on time and most importantly GETS THE JOB DONE.  Old school methods that we don't see anymore here in Vegas.  He is now branching out on his own.  Call his company you will not be disappointed.",UNK
3975,Solid Polynesian fare that will leave you full and singing Don Ho.   The Kahlua pork is the reason to get you in the door but there are several other items that make a good meal.,UNK
3976,"Visiting from out of town and found this place on Yelp.  It is very quaint, comfortable, clean and the service was excellent.  We had the the tom kha soup and red curry with chicken and both were awesome!!! The ultimate comfort food. Definitely worth stopping by.",UNK
3977,i never thought i would say this but i hated this place they were disrespectful messed up my order and accused me of lying showed my receipt and got no apology or anything i almost hauled off and slapped her ass,UNK
3978,"Pros:\nGood and friendly service\nFree limo (I doubt otherwise the place would be popular - quite far from The Strip)\nNice, home-like atmosphere\n\nCons:\nFood. Poor presentation, very average taste, absolutely nothing memorable.",UNK
3979,I love this church b/c the pastor is biblically accurate and the worship is very moving and that God is moving in this church. Life groups are awesome and the people are very friendly. God has his hand on this church and seeing it grow the way it has in the past few years is the reason that God has blessed this church.,UNK
3980,"Went here for dinner during race weeks and I really wasn't impressed. I got a steak and my co-horts had chicken. Everyone's food was ok, but no one was really wowed and it was pretty pricey. Next time we'll try Tx Roadhouse across the street and hope thats better.",UNK
3981,"Sometimes things are old and charming, and sometimes they are just old.\n\nThe rooms have all the charm and amenities of a holiday Inn. The pool wasnt useable. They did apologize for that and tried to discount a future stay. But it is so uninteresting I cant see us staying there again.",UNK
3982,"Pavement is amazing! I wanted to try on everything in this little boutique, especially the shoes, and ultimately I had a hard time deciding what to buy. The carefully selected inventory appealed to my indie sensibilities without being overly precious or trendy. There's also a nice assortment of locally made jewelry. Love it.",UNK
3983,"Good pie, tried the coconut cream--rich with lots of real toasted, shredded coconut. Crust ..needs ..something...",UNK
3984,The Fez burger alone will make you go back for more. It has a cool atmosphere without being pretentious and when the weater is nice the padio can't be beat. We went there for my birthday last year and was treated to a classic car show on Central :),UNK
3985,Skyler is by far my favorite. Not sure how I feel about them measuring now though. I guess the owner felt like they were giving away the house. Still a solid place though!,UNK
3986,Do NOT eat here if you are gluten free.  I ordered a burger from the gluten free menu and they served it on a wheat bun.,UNK
3987,"We tried Masala Dosa , Grill Thali and Mango Lassi, the food was fresh and the taste was it should be, the quantity was very good. We will defienetly go to this restaurant again, I am from North India, but a big fan of South Indian food,",UNK
3988,Solo review- Ate at the bar and had an absolutely stunning filet. Great help from staff paring a wine with the meal. Found the service friendly and helpful. The restaurant is stunningly beautiful and superbly designed. Will be back for a full service.,UNK
3989,One of my students moms raved about this place so we tried it. Now their pizza is my favorite! It's sweet and a delightful change from the corporate pizza out there.,UNK
3990,I love this place. If you get the Salmon you have to tell them not to overcook it. The food id always good and most of all its an excellent value.,UNK
3991,"horrible service, quality, and food. they made the sandwhich my friend ordered twice and he finished eating before i even got my sandwhich. then they forgot to put mushrooms on the sandwhich that i payed extra for. then they grilled me mushrooms that smelled like male sperm.",UNK
3992,"LOVE  PAUL!  He called me back within the hour just like he said he would.  Made an appt for 10:30, arrived on time, fixed my washer.  Was courteous and knowledgeable.   Cleaned up after himself.  Will definitely use him again...and again!",UNK
3993,"Nothing new at this place, they continue to remove the expiration dates\noff their food products. Someone needs to alert the clark county health department!!!",UNK
3994,I usually come here for happy hour. Happy hour menu is pretty good. Place gets packed quickly. Gets loud once in a while. Outdoor seating is nice touch. They have misters in the summer and patio heaters in the winter. Service is good.,UNK
3995,"Pad Thai was on the gummy side, but not terrible. Crab puffs and spring rolls were good. Service was poor. Friendly enough, but there were three of us, all our dishes were delivered at different times, and two were incorrect.",UNK
3996,Good atmosphere but the food is overpriced and midiocre.  I had a collection of appetizers at the bar that were not large enough portions.  We were ignored by the bartender for quite a long time as well; and the place was almost empty.,UNK
3997,"These cupcakes are AMAZING and I don't even like cupcakes usually! Any caramel flavor is delicious, especially the caramel apple! The frosting is not sickly sweet like many cupcakes. Also the workers are extremely nice.",UNK
3998,"This place is over priced for a fast food joint Mac and cheese is bland can't taste cheese at all , mashed potato is ok,  BBQ ribs and chicken just average. I was hoping this place has something different to offer. Very Disappointed :(\nI wish I used my check-in for $10 off",UNK
3999,Avoid this place. Sushi was badly made every roll fell apart. Bad service very slow got our meal wrong twice. Stick with the Chinese menu if anything at all.,UNK
4000,"The Scramblerrrrr...........Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh\nThe buttermilk pancake........Ooohhhhhhhhhh\nThe prices......ummm, did I even pay?",UNK
4001,"My boyfriend was getting a haircut and I was just waiting around at the First Choice in UW plaza. After my boyfriend paid, I noticed some extra long pieces of hair... so I asked the barber to trim it again. She looked slightly annoyed and just quickly cut off an entire patch. It was cheap and fast but not worth it.",UNK
4002,"I fully agree with Amanda B. on this one. Overall, mediocre at best. Hopefully you have one of their little coupons too, because they are a little overpriced. JT Gyros has this place beat by a mile.",UNK
4003,Fish fry was over cooked and greasy. People seem to like it here so maybe I just had it on a bad day.,UNK
4004,Chicken Caesar Salad: hardly any dressing and a complete lack of flavor.  The chicken was a reheated slab of frozen chicken with soggy breading. You can save yourself the time and get a salad from McDonald's that's probably better.,UNK
4005,"Sesame Salmon was ok and so were the mashed potatoes but the side of fried spinach was completely pointless, tasteless and very oily. Will come back to try other items though",UNK
4006,"Matches up to the most of the reviews.  Drinks are good, Food is a simulacrum of the named dish. \n\nIt's a one time mistake:)",UNK
4007,"This is the best pizza in Phoenix.  I have only been to this location once, but I have been to the Bell/16th St. location numerous times.  Their canolies are amazing too.  They get extremely busy on weekend nights, so plan ahead.  I think they are closed on Sundays or Mondays too.",UNK
4008,"Surprised that I liked it.  Look, it's not a fancy restaurant.  It's a breakfast diner, and sometimes, you want a breakfast diner.",UNK
4009,Just brought my CRV back to the shop to get my A/C checked after it blew up on the freeway after they replaced it 2 years ago June. \nWith me luck,UNK
4010,"Beautiful & elegant!  Best drink of my whole trip was Jeffrey's cosmopolitan martini at The Chandelier bar, you will be one happy (and perhaps TIPSY) camper!  Remember, prices in Vegas run higher anyway, so....",UNK
4011,Service was awful my brothers and I went in to Starbucks today we weren't even line and were looking at the menu the older lady at the cashier kept rolling her eyes at us and seemed annoyed that we weren't ready to Order her nasty attitude and impatientness helped determine that we aren't coming here again,UNK
4012,"Queen Creek Olive Mill has delicious sandwiches, gelato, and of course, olive and balsamic vinegar products. I wouldn't come here for breakfast because it's pretty standard fare, but the sandwiches are great. It's a little bit pricey, but it's a nice experience.",UNK
4013,"Never been here before. They greeted me right away and offered to go thru the menu and gave recommendations. nice service. tried the steak and cheese sub, it was ok. next time I will try something else. overall I would go back. parking was hard to find during lunch time, nice day didn't mind walking.",UNK
4014,Terrible service and terrible food \nFor being located in this area we expected more from this restaurant. We had one waitress serving the entire half of the restaurant we were on and bussing her own tables while 4-5 other employees stood around. The food was horrible and couldn't even be consumed.,UNK
4015,"Small portions but good food, Very poor slow service for a Friday night and a party of four. The waitress made a comment to us about the tip, Be glad you got one",UNK
4016,"Jack is the best! Very professional and respects customers. The whole team at manolo blahnik are incredible, even their manager. Thank you jack for everything! Will definitely come back and buy more pairs!",UNK
4017,"Fresh Meat, Fresh Veggies and authentic Sauce.  I love Mongolian BBQ food and this is wonderful.  They do not use \""frozen meat\"" and boy can you tell.  They have Chicken, Beef, And Seafood to choose from. Most of the time service is good.",UNK
4018,"I'm a regular here but today I had the saltiest chicken Madeira.  Headache started to heat up.  Luckily their manager came and apologized.  Overall Great staff, great management.  I can forgive them for one mistake.  But usually the food  tastes great.",UNK
4019,"I've been staying at the Courtyard Marriott for a few days, and it's always great to be able to walk downstairs and get good coffee. There's a patio and dedicated parking.",UNK
4020,I am not the biggest fan of this type of art but this was a nice little detour. Check our the Robert Deyber artwork. It was pretty entertaining.,UNK
4021,"This is a staple for lunch for my office. The spicy tuna and pretty girl rolls are amazing. Highly recommend the Sneaky Pete sandwich.  Regretfully, for the first time, my office got food poisoning after our various orders of salmon sushi. Ugh",UNK
4022,"service and ambiance is great, but the food isn't. kobe tartare was okay, lamb was bland, and they served the lobster tail naked - no butter, no tail shell, no nothing, just the tail on and clean plate. not the kind of presentation you expect at a fancy place like this.",UNK
4023,"I was in the Strip last week and noticed that their sign is still just white grease pencil in the window.  You stay classy, guys.",UNK
4024,Quick and easy spot to grab a quick lunch. I have had their Broccoli and chicken pasta and their winter salad. Both were good. I love that they bring you a roll when you eat there. \n\nI absolutely love their triple chocolate chip cookie. It Caramelizes to a nice crisp.,UNK
4025,This is a local spot that my husband and I like to get take out from pretty often.  We love it!  I usually order the chicken kabob plate and my husband usually orders the combination plate and they are always delicious.  The rice is my favorite!  Great local greek food and friendly staff!,UNK
4026,Have been twice in past two weeks. Chicken enchiladas were good. Carnitas and Chili Verde were fantastic. Loved the chips and salsa. Some of the best I have had in quite awhile. Will be returning.,UNK
4027,I love this charming little place. So European and hip. Met a friend there for dinner. The service was fast and friendly. The food was great and presented well. They had live music which was a tad loud but still made for even better ambience.,UNK
4028,"I have frequented this Starbucks for five years, as it is the closest one to where I work.  They are always polite and fun and they deal well with the fact that my \""preferred\"" drink changes by the day.  I actually tip at this Starbucks!  (Wow, I sound like a cheap turd.)",UNK
4029,"Terrible service, and I ordered a items that were advertised as 8.99 but I was charged 11.99. Manager claimed that he was unable to change price in computer..what a joke. I will never go to that location again!",UNK
4030,"After a night out at the clubs, this place is awesome for brunch. Avoid the potato salad. Fries are super good here.",UNK
4031,Nasty ass restaurant. Burnt ass chicken nuggets and the dumbasses working didn't want to give me new ones.,UNK
4032,They made me wait for at least an hour to purchase an earring.  And failed to give the correct backing and stud. Shame.,UNK
4033,Appointment time 2:45. Saw optometrist at 4:00. Wait was way too long. Selection of frames was underwhelming. The doctor always seems to be selling you something instead of listening to you.,UNK
4034,"Hugely disappointing. Big fans & frequent customers of the Tatum/Shea location for years. This new concept is a bust. Small portions, limited food options, plastic ware everywhere. Sad to say - we won't be back.",UNK
4035,"We enjoyed a late lunch on the outdoor patio during the first week of June 2010.  The service was good, the food was excellent and the ambiance was nice.  As other reviewers have noted, it does have a European feel.  The salad with chicken livers was excellent as was the goat cheese salad.",UNK
4036,This place was okay. We stayed in a suite and had to request room service three times before they finally came at 11pm. I was sleeping. The staff is very nice and respectable.,UNK
4037,"Avoid Ipic unless you have super premium seats.  Food isn't very good and with just the premium seats you have to order, wait for food and then hustle to your table.  If you want food and a movie, go to the other Scottsdale food movie place - much better, less expensive and great service.",UNK
4038,"First and last time, I've ever been to a Houlihan's.  Nothing was memorable other than long wait for an empty restaurant and cold food.",UNK
4039,Walked in around 6 on Thursday.  There was one other guy sitting at the bar.  We waited for 5 min and never saw a server.  Walked out.,UNK
4040,"Meh... precisely. Nice location, outdoor seating, and friendly staff. Mediocre American food. Best thing, it serves breakfast till 3 or 4pm. Basic basic American food with no twist.",UNK
4041,"I had a bad experience here and wrote a review about it. The owners contacted me right away and brought me back for a 2nd facial. This was awesome. Audra is amazing, I felt relaxed and my skin looked great. This changed my entire perspective on the place and I am considering joining the spa club. thanks for your superb customer service!",UNK
4042,"Instead of giving me what I ordered, the guy behind the counter gave me a combo including more chicken tenders than I asked for. He also informed me that they were out of BBQ sauce. Plus, their soda fountain was all kinds of messed up. Not cool.",UNK
4043,"Not food related, but I just had one of the delivery drivers pull out right in front of me, after I swerved around him to not run into him, he gave me the finger! Wow, pretty professional...\nDriving a gold colored SUV with a bunch of flags on it.",UNK
4044,"In my eternal quest for the awesome San Francisco style super Burrito, I came here. I did not find it.\nThe burrito I had was good-just not what I was looking for.",UNK
4045,It's gross in here...cobwebs hanging off the lamps and tables r filthy..and how does a sandwich spot run out of wheat bread..and very wierd tht there r pictures of wierd looking kids everywhere...,UNK
4046,"I love this place!  The tiki drinks are delicious but strong, two five skull drinks is all you need.  Also, the decor is spot on, love the puffer fish lights!",UNK
4047,"Coming from the Bay Area where there are millions of great Chinese restaurants, I have to say that C-Fu is pretty good. Who would have though in AZ? Dim sum is good. I love the cheese wontons.",UNK
4048,"This club is full of shit \nThey promote guys are free with an even ratio of guys and girls but you get to the front and they will still charge guys the full price of over 100. Deceiving and just want all the hoopla outside and will never let you in for \""free\""",UNK
4049,"Average breakfast. The name said it all every plate contains egg in some form. I'm not a big fan of eggs, I know crazy, why did I come to this place. Well It was a group decision, apparently I didn't win.",UNK
4050,This jack in the box has made me sick on a few occasions. I just now discovered yelp otherwise I would have done this a long time ago,UNK
4051,bad service last night the  sever never came to the table after we were there  for about 15mn went to bar and got our drinks for us. bartender was very good,UNK
4052,Prices are definitely low.  Staff isn't too friendly though....and it was really crowded even at 1pm on a Monday!!! Produce guys were restocking and their push carts were really making it hard to get around.  Little too busy for me to want to go back.,UNK
4053,I personally love the happy hour here. They give you the drink and the shaker. It's fun :)\n\n\nHappy Hour: 4-8pm everyday\n\nMondays 8pm-12am when you show grindr or facebook invite at the door,UNK
4054,Islands is a great place for a quick burger. They have really good chicken sandwiches and salads. It is a great place for kids. They have a new kids menu that has a lot of healthy options. The desserts are pretty tasty too.,UNK
4055,Gallo Blanco is housed in a delightfully kitschy old hotel decorated with midcentury modern furniture and goofy art. We waited by the colorful pool and had drinks and very yummy guacamole while we waited for our table. We had chilaquiles and queso fundido and shrimp tacos--awesome!,UNK
4056,"I love this place! I wish they had them in California.  I go here very time I'm in AZ at least 2-3 times.  The food is always great, the place is clean and the staff is awesome and kind.",UNK
4057,Delicious food. High quality.  Power pancakes are amazing. Nice portions. They left a pitcher of tea for me. Packed even on a Monday.  Highly recommended.,UNK
4058,The food here is the bomb.  I mix up the rice and beans.  Then I dump red sauce on all of it.  Then I scoop the mixture onto my california carne asada burrito or my beef tacos.  Then I chug some horchata.  EXQUISITE!!!,UNK
4059,Horrible customer service.  In new towers 2 of 3 elevators didn't work.  Old towers run down.  NEEDS WORK,UNK
4060,"Yum!\nCute, cute place!!  Go for specialty groceries, pastries, or a quick lunch or breakfast.",UNK
4061,Great Prices. Clean and very well stocked. The one thing I dislike is the parking it's always full of shopping carts that obstruct parking.,UNK
4062,"I could not find the all you can eat lobster, unless they call crawfish lobster. Way overpriced, the best thing on the menu was the beef!",UNK
4063,"Stopped by for a quiet visit with friends on a Monday night. The place was nearly empty, which afforded us a great seat: the couch near the firepit. This is a great location for an evening chat with friends or loved one. The food was decent, not great, but the cozy outdoor atmosphere makes up for it.",UNK
4064,"Very mediocre. The rice was way overly sweet and reminded me of grocery store sushi. In addition, the sushi was served room-temperature rather then cold. Will not go back.",UNK
4065,"Fried rice had no egg. Egg rolls were soggy with little filling. They forgot my white rice with my meal. Take out comes in plastic, not white cardboard. Closest Chinese to us, but we will not be returning.",UNK
4066,Brewed coffee is no better than Charbucks; meh...might need to go for the crafted drinks to find the five star value,UNK
4067,"Great cupcakes but the staff isn't friendly. There was only a couple cupcakes left and I asked them if that's all they had and they said yes yet while I was paying, someone from the back came to put more freshly baked cupcakes in the front. A bit overpriced",UNK
4068,"Compared to the ones I've seen in Chicago, Naperville, IL, and Indianapolis, this one was nothing special. Nevertheless my kids, ages 5 & 8, who I thought might be too old for it, had a great time. They spent the most time in the Art Studio. After 3 hours I practically had to drag them out.",UNK
4069,"For some reason I think of buffets and steakhouses when in Vegas but hey it's always good to try something different, so this is my first Chinese restaurant in LV.\n\nService was okay, dim sum food was average, prices were cheaper than Mei Sum back home.",UNK
4070,First of all I have 3800 sq ft home with 7 bdrms and 4 full baths! Dina cleaned it from top to bottom! Every inch was clean! I can't say enough about  this cleaning service! Excellent service! Highly recommend!!!!!,UNK
4071,Meh.\nPork chop with eggs was dry. Bread had a very salty butter. Buddies steak was good. Don't care to go back.,UNK
4072,"Where it all began.\nAnd, when the end of the world comes, where it all will end.\nSome things seen here cannot be unseen.\nIf you must come, do so very, very early, unless you enjoy standing in a parking garage for hours.",UNK
4073,Never had the guts to eat here because it's always empty when I come around here. Finally ate here and I wasn't impressed. Sodas came by the can so you have to pay for refills obviously. The food was okay and the price is pretty good.,UNK
4074,"Best bar in Madison, especially if you don't want to be with a bunch of college kids AND you love delicious, local beer. I wish they served food!",UNK
4075,Do not order the fish. Greasy with a capital G and it wasn't cooked thoroughly. However I enjoyed the goat cheese Brie and chutney with crusty bread appetizer. My friend had the stew. She thought it was decent but wouldn't order it again. We think the fried chicken should be available every night.,UNK
4076,"Yum! We came here for breakfast this morning and it really hit the spot. There are plenty of places to sit, the service was quick and the food was delicious. Huz ordered a 'make your own omelette' and I had the pancakes. I feel silly for not ordering waffles, but there's always next time!",UNK
4077,"I wouldn't recommend going here. Apart from very poor service, the food wasn't really great. The only thing good on my plate were the fries. The lady who served us forgot a couple of our drink orders and when she finally did bring them to us, one of them had something floating in it.",UNK
4078,The only reason I liked this place was because of Maryanne. Maryanne moved to a beautiful salon on el captain And flamingo! Her number is 425 260 7973 ;),UNK
4079,We LOVE this place! Been here three times in the last two weeks! Great food and AMAZING service! My son and I love coming here to eat and play board games. It's our new favorite hang out spot!,UNK
4080,Service was lacking as we waited for our drinks to be filled for about 10 minutes food was ok nothing real special about it you can find better out there. We will not be going back.,UNK
4081,"Totally floored last night by the food and service at Blue Ribbon. We love sushi, but this was by far the best we've ever had. Never tasted anything fresher as it is in every day. Just spectacular! Fantastic experience and will definitely be back!",UNK
4082,"My friend and I met at The Pasta Shop for lunch, both of us trying it for the first time. The food was good but the prices were way too high for a lunch off the strip. I may give it another chance, but I'll try dinner instead.",UNK
4083,Great Mexican food. \nAuthentic street tacos plus a full menu of tasty dishes. \nHalibut tacos remind me of Ensenada\nMichelada with Pacifico beer is a perfect beverage for any dish.,UNK
4084,"Fast and friendly service. The Dim Sum are very tasty. May favorite was the Fried Meatball, i was caught by surprised that the outside of it was made with mochi mmmmm! The Thai tea was also delicious.",UNK
4085,"Glad to have this location near my home in the far NW valley, its new, its nice, good service, decent products, and a huge savings if you have stuff done yourself or if you have a great mechanic that is cheap and you just need parts.",UNK

4087,"Wonderful experience and very friendly staff. On my first visit, I got the \""aloha\"" pedicure. There are so many different pedicures and services to choose from. I will be back to try them all. The massage chairs and atmosphere are relaxing. I definitely recommend this place!",UNK
4088,very smokey.\npretty loud\ngood country line dancing. \ncheap drinks.\n\nTake what you want out of this review.,UNK
4089,"This is one of my favorite places to take guests visiting me.  The view of the capital at night is stunning, the cocktails are yummy and the food is always interesting (in a mouth watering way).  Oh, and a great lunch spot too. Enjoy!",UNK
4090,Very tasty food from vegetarian perspective.  Loved their home style tofu and egg plant.  Atmosphere was nice. The owner was very friendly.  I'm definitely coming back.,UNK
4091,Taco Tuesday is good time come. Several of their tacos are only $1. The food is delicious!  The Mexican music adds to the atmosphere.,UNK
4092,Terrible service. Indifferent towards customers and attitude of workers can be improve. This place can do a much better job with the customers that they have.,UNK
4093,"We had great service! The food was perfectly cooked, and presented. The ginger sake mojitos is a must!!!",UNK
4094,Worst experience ever! Food was dry and servers were rude! Too many people and not enough room . Their was no selection for food and everything was out! DONT COME HERE!!!! And I found a COCKROACH by the food! NEVER AGAIN!,UNK
4095,"Drive through is much more popular than walk in. Makes for perfect study location. I come here just for this purpose. Drinks are ... Starbucks quality, nothing new",UNK

4098,"Great atmosphere.. Lots of fun, .. Do not go for the food, not worth the money, or the disappointment on the palate..",UNK
4099,"Horrific chicken--do not order. Steak was average but not bad. Fries were frozen, limp and tasteless.",UNK
4100,My husband has a tattoo on his neck and chest and was not allowed into this establishment.  Very very upsetting and frustrating when the tattoos are not offensive and just represent Arizona.  Discrimination at its finest will never return!!!,UNK
4101,"Really people! Giving 5 an 4 stars. This place is garbage. Donuts were hard, and taste like box donuts. I am not going to kill them by giving 1 star, only because they are not the worst I had here in Vegas.",UNK
4102,I love the quickness and love the fresh food they use. Grilled onions mmm so good. Please come to Denver.,UNK
4103,"Very small portion relative to the price. \nthe food is salty, dry and taste alike!\nI am a REAL international traveler.",UNK
4104,"Dont expect anyone to greet you here. Not only will they not greet you, they will ignore you when you ask for help, EVEN WHEN THEY ARE NOT BUSY! go down the street to EZ PAWN, this place has the worst customer service in any industry in VEGAS.",UNK
4105,"Very friendly staff here! I spent about 30 minutes here today, and had interactions with the floor staff, cashier and manager, Ashleigh, who greeted me with a smile and great service.",UNK
4106,"I thought the ice cream was waaaayyyyyyy too sweet.  I can't remember the last time I tossed half an ice cream cone in the trash, but I just couldn't finish it!  My wife's chocolate milk shake was overwhelming, too.  And we LOVE sweets!",UNK
4107,I don't get the hype. It's just the lobby bar.  A friend and I grabbed a drink here on my most recent stay at the Cosmopolitan while we were waiting for others to get checked in.  I have never paid $12 for a Bloody Mary before and I hope I never will again.,UNK
4108,Great pizza! As good as any pizza you will get anywhere in town. Cute old house with an inviting patio when it cools off. Had a wonderful meatball sandwich at lunch (they only do pizza at night). They have delicious crepes for desert.  If you want a great meal go to Cibo.,UNK
4109,"I loved the food and beer selection.  I only wish there were more vegetarian options.  It won't keep me from going back, but I won't go as often as I might if there more veggie-friendly choices:)",UNK
4110,"It was my favourite Chinese restaurant in Edinburgh, until the change of ownership about two years ago. Service was fast and friendly but the dish just not as good as it was before.  Anyway still a good place to get a quick meal.",UNK
4111,"Horrible customer service. Spent about half an hour waiting for help while some guy stood in the back flirting, that is until his wife showed up to pick him up. Wouldn't go back to this location",UNK
4112,Fat burger makes a big fresh hamburger that is pretty good.\nKind of like steak n shake on roids type place.\n1. Portillo's.   \n2. Five Guys\n3. Fat burger\n4. Smashburger\n5. Steak n' Shake,UNK
4113,"The most smiley staff ever, really polite at the till, lovely and refreshing.\n\nHandy wee shop, especially for their \u00a33 meal deals for lunch.",UNK
4114,"Delicious food but long wait to get a table (I was here on a Saturday for brunch, of course) When we did sit, food came fast and service was good! Must have the pancakes!",UNK
4115,State-of-the-art facility with a wide range of  high quality firearms. Been a member since the day they opened and train at least twice a week.  Great group of folks work there.,UNK
4116,"SO FUN!!!! Nervous at first, then I had a GREAT time! Staff was helpful and knew what they were doing! Very inexpensive for such an experience! A MUST try if you are downtown at Fremont! The pictures cost more than the actual flight!",UNK

4118,"The WORST airline, they advertise low prices but they'll get on your luggage, a standard carry on item they will charge $50 one way and if you didn't check in luggage at check in desk they will charge $100 at the entrance of the airplane, what a rip off and airplanes are trashy !",UNK
4119,"Looooove this place! We came here for happy hour (drinks are strong, delicious and cheap) and decided to stay for the live music performance (awesome setup but no dancing). I guess you can't have everything you want in a bar but this definitely comes close. We'll be back and hopefully we can dance!",UNK
4120,Very disappointed in this place. Not very good food & no imagination ... a melt was extremely yucky!  Service sucked and the boy at the counter was very unenthusiastic & I felt didn't even want to help us.\n\nNever again.,UNK
4121,Didnt order anything super complicated just a cheese pie and a single salad but what it was simple and amazing!   The the salad was full of turkey and vegies the blue cheese tasted homemade!   The pizza rivaled east coast!  Way to bring it!  Sooooo good!,UNK
4122,The sushi was delicious. The other food didn't compare. If I go back here I would just stick with the sushi. The waitress and other employees were very attentive. Nice atmosphere.,UNK
4123,"Sadly, this place went ouf of business. Tried coming the first time before Christmas and they said they were closed for the holidays and tried again tonight and was told from the next door restaurant The Grind, they closed permanently a few weeks back .",UNK
4124,"Shopping center is nice. As far as shopping goes its mostly women's stores. They do have some stores for men but very limited. I mostly come here for the restaurants. Kona Grill, Cheesecake Factory, and many more.",UNK
4125,"Server was on his game but bartender needs to resign. Her standards and attitude need some additional adjustments or maybe she needs some refresher training on how to clean glasses and how to serve wine. My glass was dirty and had not been dried. Also, lots of drama within the staff...females. The guys were staying busy.",UNK
4126,"This place was so dirty, I couldn't wait to get  out of there. The shampoo station was so gross. I won't be going back!",UNK

4130,"Excellent service, perfect steak have to have aged bone in prime rib...not to mention appetizers sheared pork and crab cakes melt in your mouth",UNK
4131,What isn't to love about Thomas Street? They have the best patio ever out back. The food is really good actually. But I love going there for the awesome drink specials and corn hole.,UNK
4132,The Supermarket aisles doesnt seem to be to organized. The Employees are friendly. I miss the Ice Cream shop that was inside. The Gas Station is a big conveniece. The prices are good.,UNK
4133,"Muffins from heaven! Not too sweet and amazingly huge and fresh. Great tea selection. Nothing fancy inside, but warm and inviting. Great place to meet up for a leisurely afternoon chat or alone with good book in hand.",UNK
4134,"Our stay at the Luxor was fantastic! Cozy beds, clean bathroom...pretty much all you need for a weekend in Vegas. Only wish our room had a fridge!",UNK
4135,"Horrible service. Just awful. Five to-go orders came in after us, ordered, and got there food before the Waitress even put our order in. The place wasn't even busy. We ended up leaving after waiting for over a half hour. The place just serves sandwiches. I mean, really???",UNK
4136,"You can tell this place doesn't believe in the Hawaiian BBQ name, they don't use it when you call.  They use their franchise name #1 BBQ.  What a let down.",UNK
4137,Tonight was our first time dining at Rusconi's and the food was absolutely amazing. Our waiter Don was terrific and very attentive. We will definitely be eating here on a regular basis.,UNK
4138,"Came here for a late lunch and had their mussels and fries. It was really tasty, but the service wasn't that good even though it was not busy at all. It's a good location, but given the service, I'd probably look for another place for an afternoon beer.",UNK
4139,Way overrated! I honestly think people are impressed more by amount of food and the presentation of the food. They make it look pretty but actually tasting good is another thing,UNK
4140,"Excellent vegetarian pho and shrimp rolls. Found it unfortunate that they did not honor lunch prices on Sunday, but we had a great experience. Green curry was great too!",UNK
4141,I've taken my bike here numerous times and every time Dave has always been able to fix any issue I have had. \n\nThe customer service is great and the prices and labor are way better than dealer prices.,UNK
4142,"I've gotten two \""eh\"" cuts at Philip Pelusi.  I'd be satisfied with \""eh\"", I suppose, if I were paying less, but for the price I'd expect much more.  Neither cut was terrible, but neither was what I had in mind or asked for, either.",UNK
4143,Yes!!!!!!\n\n\n\n\nGreat service!\nGreat Food!\nLove the BYOB!!! ($5).,UNK
4144,"I love love love the steamed clams.  In fact I love everything I have ever tasted here.\n\nThe bar is a perfect date spot.  Candle lit and quiet, with great appetizers and stiff drinks.  I highly recommend the Salt Cellar for its outstanding seafood and excellent customer service.",UNK
4145,"Whoa. I got a $10 burrito that looked and tasted like a 99 cent bean and cheese burrito from del taco. Nice job, guys. At least the laughter kept my belly full.",UNK
4146,Buffet at the next level. Who would imagine Bone Marrow? Seriously? The individual mini metal pots with lids are worth the adventures they hold. ot one was a disapontmet. The portion size is smaller so your able to enjoy the variety with out getting too ful. But we still shared them. Do not miss!,UNK
4147,I always come here when in Vegas. I think it is so unique and the food is fresh. My only complaint is they need to sprain the water off the beans. Very good food.,UNK
4148,I live right down the street from this location.  We have been going there since Oct.  They have great staff!  Their rewards program is easy and worth it also.  The recently changed their menu and I would NOT recommend the waffles.  New item and they have not mastered the recipe or cooking temperature.,UNK
4149,"Good food, okay atmosphere. Ordered takeout for two, had a local beer at the bar while I waited. Has an older crowd feel. Bar looks outdated and a little messy.",UNK
4150,"Love, Love their burgers, fresh fries are awesome and the yellow peppers... My mouth is watering just writing this.",UNK
4151,"We went for a family birthday party and everyone in our group really enjoyed their meals. They printed a personalized \""happy birthday\"" message at the top of our menus which was a nice touch. The service took about 2.5 hours which was slow but not awful for a party of 9 people. We will definitely be back!",UNK
4152,"Love Dr. John!  He has been a blessing to me and my back.  Best Chiropractor I have ever had.  The New Address is actually  8525 S Eastern Ave # 120, Las Vegas, NV 89123 (Wigwam and Eastern).",UNK

4156,Good gas prices & staff is friendly but very very very dirty!  Half the coffee pots were empty & the got coco was not working.  I was left getting tea & that skieved me out.  GROSS!!!,UNK
4157,"The food is ok, drinks are good. Service is slooooooooooow. They forget about you in the patio, and you wait a while for the check. Been here twice, two different servers, both slow service. But the place is pretty cool. Too bad.",UNK
4158,We bought a deal from RJ Deals for the Halloween Spooktacular Hayride.\nDo Not waste your time or your money!\nI wish I would have checked this site before I purchased anything from these unorganized Hoosiers,UNK
4159,We got 24hours pass (Buffet of Buffets) and we used it 5 times in 24 hours. The Spice Market is a good buffet with too many options. But the quality of food is like all buffets. Good thing about this buffet is their seafood.,UNK
4160,The place is overpriced and the taste is underpriced. If your in Vegas and are constipated this is the right place for you!,UNK
4161,Okay drinks. Bad service. They gave me drinks 25 minutes later and even gave someone (who ordered after me) their drinks before me. What the hell!? Just go to Bomboba for great service and great drinks :)! I love them there!,UNK
4162,"Definitely not the best spot in town for hot yoga. It gets extremely packed, and hot, and very stinky because of the carpet that covers the classroom floor. Plus, a couple posture have led me to knee injuries - which had never happened over many years of hot and regular yoga.",UNK
4163,I liked that this place was packed full of stuff! But at those PRICES I don't know how they stay in business! I heard good things about what they give if you sell..was very sad they weren't accepting clothes.(but I see why!),UNK
4164,"This place has one of the best beer menus in Vegas, and its food is equally as good. We recently had the poutine, the lamb meatballs, and the pork belly sandwich, and all were fantastic. Highly recommended.",UNK
4165,"I went to this place just moving here from NC, I went up to the barber and said how you doing today my name is martin. the guy looked at me like I was on drugs. didn't say hi or talked at all. very rude, they give good haircuts but the barbers are rude.",UNK
4166,Over priced food that isn't any better than a taco bell. Drinks more expensive than the hockey arena next door. Do yourself a very big favor and stay far away from here or join the ever growing list of disappointed reviewers on yelp regarding this place,UNK
4167,"Considering what an average meal costs on the Strip, a burger, shake and fries combo for $19 is not so bad.  I don't think this meal would cost much less at the crappy casino coffee shop, anyway.  Go for a shake if nothing else.",UNK
4168,Drinks were awesome. Bartenders were very charming and nice. Elvis impersonator got the party started! Decore was lovely and old school! Cant wait to drink here again,UNK
4169,Solid ramen joint.  The spicy is great. Just try to go during the off peak hours.  The service is great and the food is total comfort food!  It is small so during the lunch break it gets super crammed.,UNK
4170,"The ice mocha is strong and full flavored without being acidic. The place has a great vibe, try it you'll like it!",UNK
4171,"I got the spicy basil with sliced beef & this is my new favorite thai place.. Good portions, Good price,  & Good Food.. I definitely will be back",UNK
4172,We went here for lunch. It wasn't the greatest sushi I have ever had. I would go here if someone else wanted too or for a lunch meeting requested by someone else. But I don't see myself personal ever coming back on my own desire. (Hopefully that explains my thoughts.),UNK
4173,"fortunate to have such authentic pizza in Henderson. Everything is good Quattro fromage is a favorite. Do not expect American pizza fare here, leave that abomination for dominoes. This is the real deal.",UNK
4174,This was a fun show to go see. If your a prude or a homophobe this show isn't for you. It was a blast coming to this show. The comedy and the acrobatics were impressive. I only wish the show lasted longer.,UNK
4175,"I don't know why some people say that Gigi's cupcakes are dry and the customer service is terrible. A must-get cupcake is the birthday cake and the wedding cake. It was my first time coming here and the gal at the counter helped me choose what to get. Overall, I would most definitely come here again.",UNK
4176,"Really come on people, I had a thin dry ass over cooked bland hamburger and some undercooked cold fries. Nasty. I won't be going back. Price was right taste was wrong. The biker atmosphere and poorly prepared burgers will make sure i wont be going back.",UNK
4177,"This place is a joke.  The girls that were handling the cover wouldn't give me my money back from being in that place for only 1 min...   They weren't apologetic at all... On top of that, no one was in there.",UNK
4178,The hot pot was a total disappointment.  Totally not what I expected.  It was more like a soup pre made. No variety to choose from.  I wouldn't recommend that dish if you already know what hot pot is suppose to be.,UNK
4179,"I'm sure I could save money going somewhere else but it is so convenient, clean, and the service is great.  Chris, who works there on the weekends is super friendly",UNK
4180,I found the Hotel nice and clean but I noticed the aircondition is not enough for the hot weather. I give it 3 star because the customer service is so helpful and and the pool was amazing,UNK
4181,"I absolutely loved this place.\n\nOur room was awesome, the beds were amazing, and there was a huge TV to watch football...\n\nAny place that has Bradley Nowell's report card gets 5 stars from me.\n\nI LOVE THIS PLACE.",UNK

4185,Greasy fish. It's A dive fast food restrant. This place is what gives fast food A bad name. The staff not nice. Dirty restrant.,UNK
4186,"We love coming here. It's close to home, low key, & the food is tasty. The staff is always friendly & the wait is never long. I like that I can bring my noisy, messy 11 month old.  I usually get the breakfast sandwich & a strawberry banana smoothie. Hits the spot!",UNK
4187,"Seen one seen them all. Big chain food, all frozen and defrosted on site. Bad service. And an owner who walks around like he's king tut, waiting for his shift to be done so he can go back to Chomedey.",UNK
4188,Typical Fremont old casino. Bad air ventilation (smoky!) and kinda depressing. 2 stars because there are worse casinos in Vegas.,UNK
4189,It's a small stall at the airport and they only have the basic Cinnabon size. There was no line so it was fast. We got the original and the pecan caramel. \n\nWe ate half of each and done.,UNK
4190,"Who doesn't love a park ?!? Great place to get a sun tan in the summer. Lots going on at the outdoors theatre (music, movies ect...). Bike lane, running lane, small lake, sitting area, everything you need to have a good time.",UNK
4191,"Not horrific , not the transcendental experience I expected based on their press , the fries were dry and floury in texture and the burger looked like it came out of a frozen pack although it was tasty.",UNK
4192,I went to Pro Nails by Julie for the first time today and was very pleased with the service and quality of work! Kimberly did an awesome job on my toes! I'll definitely be going back there!,UNK
4193,"Went here to get a a young man's haircut and the price was right, the haircut was exactly what was ordered.  Can't go wrong with that, especially considering he needs a haircut every 6 weeks.",UNK
4194,"This place is not good. I am sorry but the food is just blah, did ppl actually eat here before giving it 5stars?",UNK
4195,"Food is okay at best but the beer is AMAZING! My favorite is the All Nighter and the sampler (you get to try 9 of their beers, including specialty and seasonal ones ) Its also really cool to bring beer lovers here or friends out of town because they brew their own beer in house which makes for a great visual.",UNK
4196,"Completely remodeled inside in the last few weeks. Still has the odd way that you have to line up to order, and the same staff. It just looks newer/cleaner.\n\nAnd its still just Subway.",UNK
4197,This was a great experience.  With a group of people and did a tour through the brewery.  I like how they have cocktail tables in the brewery so you can enjoy the brewing environment.  I really enjoyed all their beers but the IPA was the best.  Good place to stop in for a craft beer.,UNK
4198,"Jabz is the best thing that has ever happened to me. U work every part of ur body, the staff is great n u dont get bored cause u don't do the same thing every day. I love it. Been going for a year and a half n will go for more years to come",UNK
4199,I waited for a pizza for 30 minutes because my name was never called. Employees were not very pleasant and the pizza was cold and falling apart.,UNK

4201,Took them half hour to get me pollo loco n las Vegas rolls. The couple that arrived after me received there food first. I did not appreciate it at all !,UNK
4202,The club experience is pretty fun.  The restroom is unisex and there's another mini  bar and bartender conveniently located next to the sinks.  Inside area has a cool set up.  Outside area is also nice if you get a table.,UNK
4203,"This is the place to go for a meal when you've had enough of the casinos.  Old school diner vibe, but with a splash of Vegas flash.  The food's decent as well.",UNK
4204,"This course would be considered a target golf course as the fairways dont offer alot of room...\n\nA challenging course to say the least but with the 4 tee boxes for any level of player, I'm confident that you will be pleased with the facilities...",UNK

4206,"Received a message from the owner saying they do have some sugar free syrups, so I'll give them another try next time I want some coffee!",UNK
4207,"This is a new downtown gem. The pizza is amazing, the asparagus appetizer is to die for, and the music is fantastic. They are open super late, so they cater to the night owls. Thumbs up!",UNK
4208,Always a bad sign when the waitress askes you to remove your dirty fork fron your dirty plate to put on your dirty table for second course. Would hate to trouble you after charging $18 for fried cheese tapas. Seriously? I think we have grown accustom to 20% and have totally stopped working for it.,UNK
4209,These guys are not fair with price..they markup the parts too much and charge labor rates similar to dealerships. Took it elsewhere and saved 30%,UNK
4210,I went there and I actually finished a plate of food. Hardly ever happens when I eat out. You can pick the degree of spiciness when you order. I can't wait to return!,UNK
4211,Service was atrocious tonight! Won't be back during dinner ever again. Not sure what is going on but this is ridiculous. Both waitresses we're rude and very inattentive. Had to wait for refills on drinks and about 20-30 minutes for them to pick up the check. Horrible experience.,UNK
4212,The weekend menudo was tasteless.  So did the birria de borrego.  not quite understand how Lindo Michoacan can serve meals that bad  Prices are outrageous comparing to other Mexican restaurants.,UNK
4213,"I loved the food, but thought the service was really awful.  Especially when they weren't very busy.  That really kills it for me.",UNK
4214,"Divine is an understatement,  Food was absolutely amazing. The employees are friendly & the chef is awesome. All fresh ingredients as this divine eatery does not even own a freezer. Take a drive and support this local business it will be worth every penny.",UNK
4215,Had my business cleaned Joel came in and did it for us and did a great job he even fixed the mistakes of a different company that cleaned our carpet,UNK
4216,"watermelon salad is blah. Romaine should be changed to arugula, romaine was added wet, thus the dressing was diluted.Maybe just a bad day",UNK
4217,"I've been here a few times, each time forgetting the slow service and rather bland Thai cuisine on offer here at not particularly impressive prices. Conveniently located close to Haymarket Station, but I'd wander further afield if you want some above average Thai cuisine at the same price level.",UNK
4218,"On Saturday March 16 ordered a pizza for delivery. Waited an hour and a half. Called 3 times, they kept saying it was on the way.  When it finally arrived it was ice cold. Called to complain. They said no worries, they'd give me a credit. Called today for pizza, said they never said that.  Go figure!",UNK
4219,Perfect. Cocktails in the bar. Room service for breakfast. The suite was beautiful. Romantic. NYE already booked. Great location and plenty of things to do without having to get in your auto. We could live at this hotel. 8-) This is not the typical chain hotel....That is a great thing.,UNK
4220,Pain in the butt. Slow service and rude employees. We did get a free day after complaining loudly or so we thought. The receipt still show the charge. We turn the car in today. After what we went through we deserve a discount. Go somewhere else!,UNK
4221,First time visit today to get my Lawrence a self wash. Super easy set up and very helpful friendly staff. I'll definitely be back.  This is my new 'go to' place for my pups needs :),UNK
4222,"It is so crowded and the prices are high. And if you think that's bad, wait til you go to checkout. They had two lanes open, that's it. Never going back.",UNK
4223,"Had a fantastic omelet with ham, mushroom and cheese.  You cannot beat the value that this place has to offer.  Probably one of the best values in town.  Only down side was the server was not very attentive--constantly had to ask for more water and/or coffee.  Given the price it was not an issue.",UNK
4224,"Sone of the best pizza in Arizona.  I'm from NY so I can't say best ever. .. Haha,  but very good and won't be disappointed.",UNK
4225,"Best haircut I have ever received, Pittsburgh or otherwise.  Ryan obviously has a love for what he does and an eye for style.   All this and the price is right.  Walk-ins only,so you might have to wait for someone to finish, but that was not my experience.",UNK
4226,"Best dog ever...\n\nSpicy polish dog, chicago style, with the caribbean sauce/spread = fire breathing hell in heavan",UNK
4227,"The crust was good & it pretty much stops there! There was so much sauce that it was squishing out everywhere! The beef tasted like it was drenched either in teriyaki sauce or soy sauce. The cheese was cheap, rubbery imitation cheese product. We will not be returning to Happy's Pizza as it made us very unhappy!",UNK
4228,"I'm not changing the rating, but I wanted to add that I called the hotel to inquire about my charges, and the manager Megan was very nice and helpful. We sorted out the charges in about five minutes and everything was taken care of.",UNK
4229,My husband and I had lunch here for the first time and it was excellent.  The patio view overlooking the golf course was gorgeous.  We shared a burger and it was cooked the way we wanted.  They even split the burger and fries for us.  The services are great and friendly.  The prices are reasonable.,UNK
4230,"Love this place, an old favorite of mine. Great sauce, meat has just the right amount of smokiness and who can resist a lemon shake up!",UNK
4231,i ordered the orange chicken and it was just gross.  im no expert on westernized chinese food but i dont think you are suppose to make orange chicken with black soy sauce.  how about a little sweet sauce? just a little? so gross,UNK
4232,"Such a cute ice cream shop! It has the very old fashion style to it. The ice cream was delicious! They had so many options to chose from as well. They also have brownies, kronuts-a croissant style doughnut and cookies. The staff is very nice and friendly. Clean and nice place!",UNK
4233,Been coming here for a year for my oil changes and always got a free car wash.  Today I drove all the way from Henderson to this location today and was told they no longer give away free car washes with oil change. I paid 80.00 just for my oil change. They have lost a loyal customer today.,UNK
4234,Horrible service! Dirty place!  There was 5 of us for breakfast and our food took so long to come out!  Don't eat here!,UNK
4235,"I recently visited 5th and wine for the first time.  I met a date there.  What a nice place.  The restaurant is very cozy, great place for a date.  The bartender was very sweet and friendly.  I would highly suggest this place for a date or a girls night!",UNK
4236,"Perfection at an affordable price. The best service, beautiful atmosphere & delicious food. We visit monthly & recently had a party for 20 which was outstanding. Need I say more?? Any negative comments by others are inaccurate..there are no negatives. Kiefer , Perry, & Pierre are the best professional waiters in vegas.",UNK
4237,"Great service, shocking food. So disappointed. $16 for a tiny mahi mahi fillet over cold rice with over cooked old green beans.",UNK
4238,It was a pleasure dealing with Banner Plus. They were very quick in processing my banner order and it looked great! There prices are very reasonable compared to other banner companies. I would use them again without a doubt!,UNK
4239,New fave spot to hit when I'm craving some good food with Asian flare. Their sauce bar is tasty! Loved every bite.,UNK
4240,Apparently my last review was censored. Waitress was extremely rude. Told us we were eating too many unlimited wings and the restaurant wasn't making money.,UNK
4241,"This is the least well run operation in all of Sonic's stores!  they lie, they play with customers shakes they do not observe health regulations for food handling.  DO NOT VISIT THIS LOCATION!",UNK
4242,"I was really hoping this was going to be great Mexican food, even if it was seafood.  My wife and I had it for lunch and we were not impressed.  Too bad.",UNK
4243,"Came in with my sister looking for a pair of pants and a pair of shoes. After buying the shoes I was already a bit tired and being pushy. Katie was helping me. Ultimately I did not end up finding the right pair, but I thought Katie was extremely patient and her customer service was top notch. -William B.",UNK
4244,"The place was busy the night we went and the service was terrible. They broke my cardinal rule of service and served others  behind us in line first, plus the food was average.",UNK
4245,"The food is basically what you or your parents could make at home, but I kind of like Cracker Barrel. I go there with my fiance and she really loves the store, which I also enjoy looking through. I really like the look and feel of the restaurant. Its kind of a cozy place to eat at.",UNK
4246,I'm giving it a full 5 stars for serving up one of the most delicious meals I've ever had. Mexican or otherwise. Bacon wrapped shrimp and Carne Asada steak with fresh sides. Good service and cool open kitchen. I will be back. Often.,UNK
4247,Super good !! We had the street tacos and we loved them and trust me I know good Mexican food. The tacos had a lot of flavor \nI would recommend coming here for lunch\n\nThe guacamole salsa was great!! It's inside of planet Hollywood,UNK
4248,This location is now closed and it looks like a Dunkin' Donuts drive thru is coming soon to take its place. I'm bummed I didn't get to try the Big Boy in time...but then again it's hard to argue with convenient donuts in the 'hood.,UNK
4249,They lost my appointment and left me waiting for a half an hour only to get my massage cut by 10 minutes. They have too much business and i mean nothing to them. Squeeze another cow into the trailer and make that profit.,UNK
4250,For once in my life I actually got great service. Keith Graham (teller) was very helpful and courteous. I have nothing bad to say about the service I received. It was excellent. Hire more tellers like him. \n\nUsually bofA always gives me problems but not today! \nThank you,UNK
4251,Omg... the absolute BEST waffles I have ever had.   Crisp. ..tender In the inside.   A lil maple syrup and it melts In your mouth.   Craving for it already,UNK
4252,Yum yum. Had a great wedge salad followed by the slider platter with sweet potato fries. All made me happy. I dined alone so I sat at the bar watching big screen tv's. It was all good!,UNK
4253,"My wife and I had the dinner all you can eat sushi last week. The sushi was bland and all the rolls seemed to taste the same. \nThe restaurant is full of ROACHES.... On the floor, on the walls , on the table top!!! Avoid this place please",UNK
4254,"What happen to the service ?  The staff at the old location was more friendly and responsive. I am always waiting to pick up my order. The pizza is a still great, but the service at the new location is poor. Management needs to get involved and improve the service.",UNK
4255,"Don't go there if you have other choice, they make you wait an hour when there are many tables availeble, food is really bad too",UNK
4256,"I was totally bored with everything in this place. The service was so so, the food was so so and unfortunately we didn't get a good view seat so the dining room was so so.",UNK
4257,First time there and seriously impressed. The server did not stop moving once. She was the bartender and server and the place was fairly busy. Great atmosphere and the food was delicious. I'm still full but already thinking about what I'll have the next time I'm there.,UNK
4258,"This place is terrible.\n\nThe food is very bland and the service is very slow. Also, the servers are dressed in lingerie, but it is by no means sexy. Spend you money, and your time, elsewhere.",UNK
4259,"Another sample of bad customer service.  What happen to this places they are beautiful but the people working here probe & scan you, it feel like you need to pay first to have some one ask you and take care of you.",UNK
4260,"I couldn't even eat my food it was really nasty. And all my  friends were in the same position. Not worth the money for crappy food, never going back.",UNK
4261,"Overrated. Boring sandwiches, meh...salads. Cookies are soft but made with way to much shortening. Overall very unsatisfactory.",UNK
4262,"Very good Pad Thai and the soup was awesome! The location is really good although the outdoor seating could be more abundant and well shaded. Service was a little lacking as well, but I have to say again.. the Pad Thai was really good!",UNK
4263,"Delicious food! Trendy but great food at a great price, reverse happy hour is a must! (10-12am) I think... YUM!!!",UNK
4264,"Great meeting place for a family dinner, friend get together or to use the big room upstairs for a party. Really good skinny margarita! Their salsa is a little watery. The street chicken tacos are really good!",UNK
4265,Great omelet and pancakes. I love their whipped cream!!! Whipped cream at this restaurant makes everything taste extra delicious.,UNK
4266,"Nice and friendly and clean.  Sorry, Grill not working so no grilled sandwiches.  Sorry, no spinach.  Very limited selection of what they do have.  Small place.  Seating outside is nice.  Sandwiches we had were really good.  Management could maybe use some improvement.",UNK
4267,Ended up going here 2 nights in a row during a bachelor party weekend during spring break. The line can get hectic as late as 3-4am. I was impressed that they had a DJ spinning 1) despite being a sandwich shop and 2) it was 4am!,UNK
4268,"Food was amazing. So crowded for a Sunday at two. We were just picking up goo and they forgot a taco, but quickly refunded us out money.",UNK
4269,Store is a complete mess like TJ MAX OR ROSS.  Prices wrong on several items or no prices at all. I went to counter & they told me price was different then the display shows & I showed them & they said oh sorry. It was a mistake. No price match or explanation for false prices.,UNK
4270,"It's much too much in my opinion.  Long lines, big crowds, so much merchandise you can't digest it all.",UNK
4271,"Great beer selection and reasonably priced menu all within the Whole Foods in the Biltmore neighborhood...who would have known?  We stopped in yesterday for a drink and to check out the cheese selection at Whole Foods.  We will definitely be back for happy hour and for some nibbles - edamame, egg rolls, potstickers etc.",UNK
4272,"First of all, this is a great place to eat at while in Vegas! Service was fast and patient since we wanted time to look at the menu. I ended up getting the rising sun burger with a fat boy shake. Oh man!! The burger was good and would definitely recommend it, but the shake was GREAT!",UNK
4273,Second time I've been first time I loved it this time it was still pretty good. Ribs were very good but most the stuff in the Mexican section was cold. Small desert section which didn't bother me. It's a steal for as far as lunch buffets go costing only $10 so can't complain to much.,UNK
4274,Expensive.  The deli needs a lot of work.  Their pastas and deserts are way too overpriced for the quality. Chocolate mousse tasted like whipped cream with hershey's syrup blended in. Overcooked cold large prawns were so bad I had to return the item.,UNK
4275,"Not the best beers I have ever had, but always a solid place to go off Mill.   I love the upstairs patio.  Their salads and apps are good, I was not a fan of the tacos.",UNK
4276,"This place has a pretty extensive menu for just $4.99 however, I ordered the Kung Pao Chicken and it was sooo flavorless!  The egg roll was way greasy and the fried rice was kind of hard.  I won't be back and that's for sure.",UNK
4277,The movie I wanted was list at this theater but didn't have. So I had pick a second choice. All in all theater seems fine.,UNK
4278,"Good place, good service.  The food's good too, but you better like chicken fingers.  Much in the style of In-N-Out burger, this place goes with a very minimalist menu - chicken fingers and fries.  The food was good but not having any choices bores me...",UNK
4279,"I really like my doctor here but the staff is awful. They are the slowest people ever, they don't return phone calls and if you need something outside of your appointment, you're S.O.L. The check-in/out staff is always super nice but the nurses are dreadful.",UNK
4280,"Very disappointing.  Kind of uncomfortable- he made fun of the audience-- crossed the line, and jest not really funny.  He is so talented and doesn't need to use shock value to entertain.",UNK
4281,"This is one of my go to places for business lunches on state street. Fairly standard pub and BBQ fare with a gourmet twist. The prices are slightly higher however and the quality of service has been variable. Overall, I recommend. Really good soups in the winter.",UNK
4282,This was a horrible meal.  I went with my brother and we both were sick afterwards.  The food is quantity not quality.  I don't want to ever go back.,UNK
4283,Nice look bathrooms where outside main doors which kind of sucked? The menu was great but small. They could use more stuff but I had an app for my main the mussels are excellent and my gf had the duck mouse  thing which was excellent. Overall very nice and if you got the bucks I would go.,UNK
4284,"the restaurant is a bit dark, most of the staff is blah. the food itself is okay... and overpriced.",UNK
4285,"Wait is long, but worth it usually! They put rosemary on everything, a little over bearing but that's ok. Dinner service gives free muffin bread thins, I could get 45 if they'd let me! I love the breakfast and the dinner. I wish they never closed!",UNK
4286,Nice place to buy books but I don't know if it's a nice place to hangout and study Just because it's connected to the mall but overall it's alright for buying books.,UNK
4287,"I had the pizza special, which is 2 slices and a medium soda for 6 bucks. Overall, the pizza was pretty good. The crust is not your typical crust, it is thick and doughy. But if you like double dough or double crust, then you will like it. The ingredients were fresh and delicious.",UNK
4288,"The best Mexican food in Chandler.  Our church group started having taco nights here a few years ago, and they are so nice.  El Presidente Burrito is the best thing on the menu!!",UNK
4289,"Just experienced You Dirty Dog on the highway! dirtydog2 license plate! this driver was rude , unprofessional , unsafe , if they take care of your dog like this beware !!!",UNK
4290,"Had a massage and it was fabulous.  I asked for deep tissue, and it definitely was.  David, the masseur, did a great job!  I've also had eyebrow wax and haircuts and everything has been great.  They have a membership for AZ residents too!",UNK
4291,"Shoe string french fries are da bomb!\n\nCustard is uh-may-zing. I recommend the fudge brownie concrete.\n\nPrices are fair, service is good. Place is clean. No complaints!\n\nP.S. They have free wi-fi!",UNK
4292,"If you visit Charlotte are live here you have to try it , its a famous spot. The chicken is good and services very fast. But I dont think its the best fried chicken in CHLT....that goes to the Chicken box",UNK
4293,Ok so that has to be the most amazng meal I have ever had! The tartar was amazing. The wellington was as good as it looks on tv. I don't know what else to say. Amazing!!,UNK
4294,"Vincent's market bistro is my usual weekday go to. Always pleased with there salads, soups, apps, mains and desserts! Scotty and the staff are the best. You know a place is good when there clientele have been going there for years and years.",UNK
4295,"The little place on 7th Avenue was far superior. This place is a dungeon. Cavernous, creepy, and terrible service. The food was similar with the same great green chili tacos and posole, but the ambience is like eating in a warehouse. Gangbangers all over outside. Go armed.",UNK
4296,Very disappointed. The hotel has a resort fee of $18 plus tax for every night and the pool isn't open. The resort fee only covers a newspaper and phone calls.  But who doesn't have their own phone.,UNK
4297,"Bon caf\u00e9, d\u00e9cor chaleureux et personnel sympathique. Les produits sont faits maison, plusieurs aliments bio et vegan friendly!",UNK
4298,A hidden gem! They give the same type of pedicures that I received at Bellagio Spa for less than a quarter of the price...... Hot stones and a 10 min massage and more. It was absolutely amazing. :-),UNK
4299,Negative stars---------------------\n\nThe worst hours 7-4 and No F------- Saturdays. Wow I guess they do not want business,UNK
4300,A kind of cool place to get a drink and a snack. Pay with cash to avoid awkwardness. Don't go there for customer service.,UNK
4301,"My crack. I eat here 4 days a week Rob, the owner, is very active in the community and I just love this concept.. Imagine tcby meets cold stone..",UNK
4302,"It's so beeeeyooootiful! I loved it here (and I really, really liked the sheer lotus curtains in our room) and loved how it was close enough to xs to just walk indoors there, but far away enough so you didn't have to hear all the noise if you didn't want to.",UNK
4303,This was the first Pinks I've been to and the food was good! The fries were awesome! The price was great for Vegas!,UNK
4304,Good atmosphere...wasnt crazy about the food...nor was anyone in my party. The area on mill st. was fun.,UNK
4305,"I live down the street and my boyfriend and I love coming to raising canes. The service is great! Aside from a few times of our order coming out wrong, still really good.",UNK
4306,"Only true ramen joint in this cultureless barren wasteland known as Phoenix metropolitan area.  Enjoy it while you can, places like this doesn't have long life expectancy.",UNK
4307,Been to this place over 20x and this place has really gone down hill in most areas. It was once a 4-5 star restaurant and the food was great but I have noticed the pattern...,UNK
4308,Lots of awesome stores! Expensive and normal price...it is an indoor mall.  Has Starbucks and a Tiffanys...my two favorites!,UNK
4309,"I got the pad kee mao and my noodles were a little hard and bland. My friend got pad thai style noodles with crab on top, and his noodles were delicious. Service was friendly albeit slow considering we were the only party there...",UNK
4310,Love this place. Never have had a bad experience here. The staff is great and the manager is a real friendly guy. Mile High nachos has to be my favorite appetizer and the wings...well they are pretty dang good.,UNK
4311,Just screwed up a simple order. Not busy or shorthanded but give me the wrong sandwich.  I don't have time to check my food on the go. So now ill take my business to in n out.,UNK
4312,I was needing pizza's for a customer as close to 11am as possible. I called around to 5 other pizza places who had no interest in helping me. I called them and told them my predicament and they were more than willing to help me. Not to mention their pizza was very good!!! Thank you!,UNK
4313,The service and food was amazing. They made me feel like I was part of a family. I recommend this place if you are wanting some great food. I had the tasting menu from Hells Kitchen it was amazing from the octopus said to the beef Wellington.,UNK
4314,Zine shouldn't be even considered asian food. The Pho is $18 and taste like dark Thai soup. Disgusting. Service was extremely slow and they would not get our order right either. We had a few dim sum items which were just ok and casino prices. I would not come here again for some decent chinese food.,UNK
4315,We have been customers for years and including take out. Never ever have we had a wrong order! Always so delicious and dependable! This place is the real deal!!! Outstanding in every way always.,UNK
4316,"Habib is the best when you want tailoring .. he is a qualified Master Tailor .... His memory is flawless ...  and he never misses a cut... he is the best in vegas.. Mayweather, News Anchor's ... not uncommon around his parts....",UNK
4317,Food was very dull. The fish was extremely salted and dry. If your trying to decide between this place or another..choose the other. Much better sushi down the street off Craig. Never going back again. -enough said,UNK
4318,"First time there and really enjoyed it.  Perfect burger, good cheese curds, lots of beer options.  The location gave me pause because of the undergraduate threat, but it was unfounded.  Good atmosphere.",UNK
4319,"If you go here you must get the Stetson salad. I'm not a crazy salad person, but this salad is unique, and delightful.\n\nI really like that everything is made in-house here, even down to the deserts and ice cream.",UNK
4320,"Only a 2 time customer so far, but im hooked. Each time I had a different barber, and both times i left happy with the haircut, service, wait time, and price.",UNK
4321,"If you are in Vegas stop in and order the corned beef hash, it is the best anywhere and they know how to poach eggs!",UNK
4322,To the barista that made my drink I saw you drop my cup and didn't give me a new one. Luckily I don't drink off of my rim that I wont complain and mess up your long line of drinks. Which btw wouldn't be so long if all your partners were actually working!!!,UNK
4323,Definitely worth a stop if you're in the area. With homemade ice cream and waffle cones you can't go wrong. We had the mint chocolate Chip and Reese's ice cream along with a waffle bowl and weren't disappointed.,UNK
4324,I go here several times a month when I'm craving sushi. It is always great and the prices are awesome too!,UNK
4325,Staff was very helpful.  This is the fourth time we've used them over the years and they have always been knowledgeable and willing to do whatever it took to satisfy the customer.,UNK
4326,"The crinkle cut fries were on point today! They were so fresh and hot. Yummy! My Del Combo Burrito was fine. It's what I usually order there, but it's nothing special really. I had a coupon for $1 off so it's nice to save a little money too.",UNK
4327,"Quick, easy, and thoroughly relaxing massage. I felt like I was in the hands of a professional. Great price at $35 for an hour.",UNK
4328,CLOSED!!!!!! Invalid number! No longer open! Website still up with no contact info. Google map links you to a strip mall and an Indian grocery. BS,UNK
4329,"Cute restaurant. The hummus is really flavorful and delicious, and the bread is super soft and nice. The pita chips are so good but I know they must be awful for you. The grilled eggplant is really good - nice and light and fairly healthy. Prices are reasonable. I'd go back.",UNK
4330,"Good burger but expensive. Very skimpy on the extra toppings, ordered grilled onions for extra $ and did not even get one tablespoon on burger. Chairs are VERY uncomfortable!!",UNK
4331,"If I could give them zero stars, I would! Absolute rude and unprofessional staff. Late, unorganized, and wreckless. Not worth the headache or money! Take a taxi or other shuttle service.",UNK
4332,Food was delicious however the portion is small and pricey for what you get. We ordered BBQ on Rice dishes. Their roast pork is awesome! Their roast duck is ok (taste is good but lack of meat). Service was just average.,UNK
4333,"This place is a blast.  I don't know how many pinball machines they have, maybe close to 100? and you can play them all.  No admission charge.  The only cost is the quarters you spend playing the games.  It's well worth stopping to see.",UNK
4334,"We went here on a saturday night, about an hour before close. I appreciated how the wait staff offered to make any dish we wanted fresh. They watched what we and other patrons were taking off the buffet and quickly made up small portions to replace. The selection is pretty good and varied.",UNK
4335,"The food was awesome, had the Chicken Tacos and the deCocktail DeCammorn!  The  was outstanding, our chip basket never got empty and our drinks were refilled continually !",UNK
4336,The Brioche french toast they're advertising now is amazing!\n\nService was quite good; I've been here before and it isn't always good.\n\nClean enough.  Decent prices.,UNK
4337,We can hardly avoid this place because of the kids. They know when we come to the drive thru sometimes twice on Saturdays. We get great service and the fries are always hot.,UNK
4338,Middle of the road. Large rooms. Good location for museums. So so breakfast. Uncomfortable tub. Liles the cotton sheets. So so pillows. Nice but inexperienced front desk. Problems with Mac laptop connecting in room this year and last year.,UNK
4339,"Once you've raised some Cane's you'll never go anywhere else again!  Amazingly fresh, authentic, and the sauce is terific!",UNK
4340,First time here and I have no complaints! Food was timely and delicious! Enjoyed to curry today and look forward to trying more things on their menu. Loved the iced tea too - it's different and I'll have to ask why next time I'm there. Very affordable,UNK
4341,Fantastic frozen yogurt. Great flavors including two tart flavors every day. Huge selection of toppings and the shop is spotless.  Indoor and shaded outdoor seating.  Lastly the owner is local and super friendly.,UNK
4342,"This was a super boring tourist trap.  \nNow that you can order any type of m + m on the internet with fancy messages and in any color, this place is overpriced and old news.",UNK
4343,Pricey. Carnitas were fantastic and the guacamole was exceptional. Margaritas were watered down and my girlfriends fish tacos were dry. Mexican restaurants should have better drinks than this.,UNK
4344,After reading the reviews I will NOT give this place a try! HAIR in food! That's the worst. It ruins the whole experience.,UNK
4345,Decent food. The pizza is really cheap and when I got it I realized why it was so cheap not that great. The reason I gave my mommas 3 stars is for there amazing homemade pies if you get a slice its huge looks like half of a pie. Would recommend it for the pie but you can better food around the valley.,UNK
4346,"Had the brunch and dinner buffets on separate days.  There was crossover of items between brunch and dinner which was a little disappointing, but I guess it would be next to impossible to do completely different options at every station.  It's good quality for a buffet.",UNK
4347,"Great vegetarian dishes; You can't go wrong with the veg hash. They have moved and expanded. Great outside seating and nice addition with the bar, menu extension and longer hours.",UNK
4348,Came here on a date (which sucked BTW)  but onto the food. Great atmosphere and friendly fast workers. The food is yummo however if you're into spicy spicy this isn't the place. Overall I'm giving it a 5. I recommend it,UNK
4349,By far my favorite bar in the area. Very relaxed atmosphere and live music some nights (not sure what the schedule is for that). Food was good for bar food.,UNK
4350,"Poor food quality. Ordered the burrito which was not rolled correctly so it fell apart almost as soon as I started to eat it. The guacamole tasted stale and had the wrong consistency. The food was fast though, which is really about all you can expect from an airport restaurant.",UNK
4351,Great service! Great food! Lots of selection at the buffet. Bbq chicken is excellent.\nFirst night opened. (for businesses in area.),UNK
4352,Absolutly amazing food and customer service!!! I highly recommend this place. Steak picana was perfect and the fried bananas were cooked to perfection. High quality food and service. A+,UNK
4353,"John at Service King on raintree in Scottsdale was exceptional. Not only did his team repair my brand new truck to \""new factory condition\"" but also aligned the tires and took time to ensure the truck was perfect! would definitely come back. They even text you and give updates on completion times, % done, etc!",UNK
4354,Stopped in for a quick lunch. Family style spaghetti and meatballs was great. I splurged and had a cocktail - Sinatra Tea - which was wonderful and incredibly strong. Unfortunately I did not realize this until I tried to walk through the mall.,UNK
4355,"Saw Calvin Harris at Hakkasan on May 4th.  I was expecting a lot, and I was not disappointed.  Lots of stairs and no free tap water (WTF???!) but overall it was an amazing night.  Would definitely recommend for anyone looking for an EDM club scene.",UNK
4356,"Went here last year late night.  Food was just ok, nothing special.  Deserts were better but not outstanding, overall ok, 3 stars",UNK
4357,Food was great! It is a cash only place so hit the ATM before you get there. They took a bit to take our order but it was busy.,UNK
4358,"Best dive bar in town, one of the best places to catch live music. Venus is your friendly neighborhood bartender. Plenty of old locals as well as college hipsters. Great beer selection and strong cocktails, video poker as well as shuffleboard, booths and plenty of room to dance.",UNK
4359,"Adult computer classes, children's programing, movies, CD's, books!   Free.  What's not to like.  Staff is helpful and usually a pretty quite place.  They do sometimes have programs that spill out into library but have to love the community participating so a little noise isn't going to hurt anyone.",UNK
4360,"Went here tonight with friends for trivia. I ordered an ice tea and a personal Vegetable Kaiser Pizza. The pizza was soggy, bland and greasy. The ice tea was horrible even with sweetener. I will continue attending for trivia, but will seek food elsewhere.",UNK
4361,Worst possible customer service experience at LV.  Terrible sales associates.  DO NOT waste your time.  Go to the  Scottsdale location.,UNK
4362,"its not the best but also not the worst. it gets a little pricey when you order by dish, but the lunch specials are reasonably priced. if you are expecting gourmet chinese then this is not the place for you. the rice is dry and the food is okay. nothing real special. customer service is good. very friendly family.",UNK
4363,This place has really amazing pizza and wings. The service can't be beat either. Mr. Biaggio works very hard to make sure that you have the best experience when you eat there. Love the homemade blue cheese and ranch too!,UNK
4364,"The pizza is great. I'm not usually a fan of thin crust, but the sauce is so tasty and they don't skimp on the toppings at all. It's definitely my new favorite pizza place.",UNK
4365,Terribly slow service.  Bad servers.  The queso tasted like beer.  Overpriced.  Was not happy and will not return.  Took over 20 minutes to bring us our salsa.,UNK
4366,"Love the atmosphere and decor. However, the service was slow, and the food was hit or miss. We had shrimp, steak, and chicken; the shrimp was good, but the steak and chicken were dry and bland. The winning dish was the garlic mashed potatoes; they were especially delicious.",UNK
4367,"Spent more than $45.00 with an out-of-town guest, who was shocked that we were charged for \""bread\"". She asked, \""How can that be?\""\n\nDisappointing... hope that changes...",UNK
4368,The icing is delicious and their cupcakes look pretty but  the 'cake' part of the cupcake was horribly dry and bland. It was as if they were made a week ago. Very disappointed!,UNK
4369,"Es la mejor comida India que he probado. Es un garito cutre llevado por una familia pero,la comida es absolutamente deliciosa y abundante. Vale la pena!",UNK
4370,Great food and awesome service! Would definatly recommend  to my friends! These people that gave bad reviews must be crazy. It's not a five star restaurant people.,UNK
4371,"We go to Jupes all the time! We love this place!!! Chris and Carrie are awesome, the beer is frosty and cheap and we love that its a neighborhood bar. The trivia night (Thursday) is so fun and they have a great juke box.",UNK
4372,"The foods are so bad!! I can't believe it! That's why the price is way too cheap! Not worth eating here honestly. If you like it, it's just that you have a bad taste",UNK
4373,"If you LOVE sushi, the sushi buffet isn't that great...and neither is the food on the menu. You do get a lot of food for the price so no complaints there. The authentic food on their special menu tastes better.",UNK
4374,"Horrible place $3.5 dollars to use the computer so I can print 1 single paper, because they don't have an email address or WiFi, who doesn't have WiFi or an email address at their business it is 2015. \n\nRip off. Don't go there.",UNK
4375,"Love the new options for lunch, it gives me more chances to try great sandwhiches from the king of meat...that is his new name. \n\nI cannot tell you how quality everything is from here... go try for yourself.",UNK
4376,"Sat on the patio, quiet and cozy @ 6pm on a Thursday. Great happy hour specials, on appetizers and beer. Great cocktail and beer list and unique items as well as staple items on menu. The goat cheese stuffed peppers were yummy!",UNK
4377,"Ok, folks this place is a true hidden gem.  Inside the old Gold Spike, is a great place for Breakfast and lunch.   Prices are good, food is great,  atmosphere is comfortable.   Staff  are friendly and a kick in the pants.",UNK
4378,"I enjoy their burger every once in a blue moon.  I love the shakes, and the animal fries are super good!  I'd much rather order animals fries with a hamburger patty on the side.",UNK
4379,I will need to try this place again.  Nothing so far of what I ordered has been a standout.  I didn't try their dessert either.  I will be back.  From what I have experienced a good place to have Italian.,UNK
4380,"I had a really good experience here. The staff was really friendly, they quoted me less than safelight and they got it done in an hour. I highly recommend this place!",UNK
4381,"Shame I can't give this place a lower review. The management was rude. The toilet in the room didn't stop running. Ancient tv's, and god only knows what dna was left in the room. I won't be staying here ever again.",UNK
4382,Great place to grab a glass of wine and sit and talk to friends. Very nice environment. I've been to one of their wine tastings and it was an awesome experience as well. This place is perfect if you want something a little off the beaten path that's not your usual overcrowded loud bar on a Saturday night.,UNK
4383,"Jackie works out of her basement, and is my tailor of choice in the Madison area. Look for the small sign on her house. It's not very easy to see.\n\nI've had a suit tailored, sleeves lengthened on a coat, and buttons. She did it all well.",UNK
4384,They use frozen fruit now. The mango (topping) and colored jellies tasted funky. Mochi is still too soft. Froyo melts quicker than normal still. Tasted like it was from a powdered mix. ICK. I don't plan on going back again.,UNK
4385,"Came her on my fist visit to Vegas in February and I gotta say I expected waaaay better. I got the salmon and it was he worst. My fiance at the time now my husband, got the something (i cant remember) that was just as bad. Bad choice and wont visit again.",UNK
4386,"Maybe not perfect, but pretty darn good.  Great food, service, drink selection, and prices.  What more do you want in a biker bar?",UNK
4387,I loved this place. The food was really great. I loved the decor. Order the corn...it's to die for. We ordered sushi as well...and it was good too. A little pricey but worth it.,UNK
4388,If you are getting a detail run away! They avoid giving price similar to when you buy a car. You can get a better job done for half the price.,UNK
4389,"Delicious food, menu is a touch overwhelming but our server was incredibly patient with us. Services was impeccable! Thanks Deena!",UNK
4390,"Food here is great. I was afraid first because the place was almost empty. Originally we were heading to another place and we couldn't get in. However, we don't regret it. Food was delicious. We tried the western omelette with fresh fruit and home fries. Also an old fashion french toast.",UNK
4391,Incredible restaurant. A little out of the way and the neighborhood looks sketchy but the most welcoming couple own the restaurant and they'll spend half an hour explaining the menue to you in detail.  We LOOOVED this place,UNK
4392,"Ordered pasta with clam sauce,one of my favorite foods. Was served pasta with yucky cream sauce that had already coagulated in the bowl, 2 bites,and pushed it away. Hubby had beef on weck, it was a wreck. Service very slow, and it was not busy. Will not return.",UNK
4393,The food was amazing! Great happy hour specials too. They just need to add more tables and more staff...then it will make the five star rating.,UNK
4394,One of our favorite hikes in the area. Sunrise is usually not too busy and the path is easy to follow but moderate. The peak has breathtaking views of the Estrella Mountains.,UNK
4395,"I have been enjoying their gelato since the week they first opened. Many years later they still offer the best gelato in the valley. Check out their pastry selection, add a cup of espresso and you will be sure you died and went to Italian heaven!",UNK
4396,"it's SO good! and i love the fact that it's a hidden gem in Cosmo (although everyone knows where it is)\n\nI wish there's more topping they could add to the pizza, other than that everything was yummyumm",UNK
4397,I found this place just by driving to my new job and feeling adventurous! I have tried a new thing each time. The green sauce is VERY spicy and I LOVE it! \nIt is worth a drive to the Sunnyslope area! :),UNK
4398,"Overpriced and nothing special.\nThey try hard, but the neighborhood is so ugly and the place is so quiet, when went for lunch it was awkward.",UNK
4399,"Dirty room, rude staff, overpriced. $20 was added to the price I was quoted, and I was given the runaround about it for 45 minutes. Stay away. Sleep in the park; it's cleaner.",UNK
4400,"Comfy bar tables, and almost every entree was excellent...The Filet was perfect, one of the best pieces of meat I have ever had, 5*+ but the NY Strip was average at best. All the sides were excellent and service was great too. Overall a great experience and I will be back for sure.",UNK
4401,We dined here with some friends!! It was great I had the rice! My boyfriend could not get enough of the sticky rice? I enjoyed the drinks a well all of the desserts are delish.,UNK
4402,"Seeing moving pictures is fun and relaxing, hence I never miss to see movies whenever I got spare time out of my busy agenda. I invite also my friends with me. I love here at Harkin because the place is clean compared to others. The sound is also a big thing to consider! Keep it up guys!",UNK
4403,They had me at cupcakes! Their vanilla cupcake is amazing as is their peanut butter & chocolate. The staff is great. Excellent guilty pleasure!!!,UNK
4404,Service sucks. Everyone who works here has an attitude and is not accommodating!!!! Olive Garden tastes better then the food they serve here. Deals are also misleading. Save your money and go elsewhere.,UNK
4405,"I have eaten here at least 6 times so far and have never had a bad experience. Food is good, staff is friendly and the biscuits alone are well worth the visit. I usually end up getting the chicken fried chicken with two eggs over hard and a bowl  of grits. Reminds me of good ol' southern  breakfast.",UNK
4406,Heard good things about this place. All I can say is that this is a perfect candidate for Kitchen Nightmares. Bad service. Bad food. Only order pizza if you must eat here. 93 rating.,UNK
4407,"Love Westbrook Animal Hospital. Open 7 days a week. Friendly staff, great vets who make follow up calls to check on how your pet is doing. Always caring and helpful. Usually can get in right away. Recommend to all my friends!",UNK
4408,"Found a great dress, but when I was trying it on, the fitting room attendant opened the door on me (without knocking) and I had to slam it shut. Mind you, it was the same attendant who let me in that room less than 5 minutes before. No apology, nothing. They definitely need customer service training here.",UNK
4409,"Good service, but we weren't impressed of the desserts. We got the souffle and nothing special. Recommended dessert was awful, I only ate 1 spoon. I forgot the name of it. The appetizer and entree was good, but not WOW.",UNK
4410,The choclates and pastries are surprisngly really good! And I thought it wouldn't live up to the hype.\n\nBut if it seems too pricey for just pastries then just go to at least see the chocolate display.,UNK
4411,Best burgers in Vegas must try their Double monster boyger with fat fries their onion rings and fried zucchinis are good. They have great customer service,UNK
4412,"We are frequent diners an have been for ten years.  For two people, try the \""feast\"" and split it -- a great way to sample all the good stuff.  The rice is always very satisfying -- but the shrimp is hit and miss, often over done.  Still, we keep going back.  Love the soups and salad.",UNK
4413,"Now I live in Philly and I want burnt ends for dinner tonight and I can't have them and it makes me want to cry.\n\nBlack Dog, I love you.",UNK
4414,"Michelle was great! Helped me and my girls get into XS nightclub, no problem. Very professional and responded back in a timely manner. I will be calling her next year when I go back to Sin City! \n\nMIchelle: 908-770-3570",UNK
4415,This place alright. I understand it known for bbq items but it wasnt that good. I ordered the beef brisket and it was dry. And I only got 3 pieces. They put more of my side items than the brisket itself. So it was alright for me. Not bad/not too good.,UNK
4416,"Had a decent club sandwich here, the service was friendly. Comfortable atmosphere. Usually busy.. The portions are big. Lots of menu items to choose from, good value. Located next to the St Jacobs Playhouse and Courtyard Marriott a few minutes from St Jacobs downtown",UNK
4417,"I had the pleasure of doing business with Greg for a baby shower I was hosting. He paid close attention to detail, to make sure my vision was created. Greg going above and beyond allowed me to worry about one less thing. Thank you the beautiful arrangements and amazing customer service!",UNK
4418,"Very clean store. It is very well organised. I often feel overwhelmed in these types of stores, by I was fine here. The associates were nice. I will be back to this location. I definitely bought more then I came in for!",UNK
4419,Waited waay too long at drive thru before even anyone helped. Customer service is HORRIBLE. Who trains these people? Emily was extremely rude..so left without my food. We ain't in da hood not going back.,UNK
4420,Please don't waste your time nor money. I did. The manager seems nice but screws you over. I left work for a 2 hour job and it's been over 4 hours now. And this is my second trip due to the techs not doing their job.,UNK
4421,What a great unique place! Great atmosphere! It's as authentic as it gets! After living in Ireland and traveling around Europe this has a divine find. English food is good..don't believe me try this place! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the service is OK at best.,UNK
4422,Bagels are great but the service really sucks.  Even the guy running the place seems to have an attitude when you walk in.  I'm from NY and I end up going to Einstein bagel because I don't want to deal with these people.   It's pretty sad!,UNK
4423,Worst sushi in the world  go to any grocery store for better sushi!  Not fresh I got sick!  No imagination amazing this place is still in business.  Save your money there was a reason they offered All You Can Eat.  Stay healthy don't go.,UNK
4424,Restaurant looks dull and old. Food tasted worse than expected and some dishes were not fresh. Service was ok. I do not recommend trying the dimsum menu,UNK
4425,Had such a great experience here today! Donna is a sweetheart! She was very knowledgeable and knew exactly how to provide excellent customer service! If i was a restaurant owner I would love to have her represent it!,UNK
4426,Never again will I go to camelback toyota  horrible customer service beyond rude and I felt belittled  when expressing my frustration  never again I don't recommend any one especially if female,UNK
4427,So this  is the first night my usual server isn't on. And all I have to say service is awful & excessively slow! As a regular I have to say this is a slap on the face with their lack of initiative.,UNK
4428,Called in tonight for take out. We were told our small order would take 50 minutes...huh? That's awhile! Then learned it would take 80 minutes. 80 minutes for take out! Sorry. There is better food elsewhere.,UNK
4429,"Starting using lowes, as customer services and stock is not up to par, If you must use a home depot - the one on Charleston is better run, and has more.",UNK
4430,Staff ignored me.  An older man was telling some story at the cashier and both of the employes were standing up their listening and looked right at me but refused to come over and help.  After 5 minutes of waiting I just left the store.  Their loss I guess,UNK
4431,"Service was great, food was awesome!!!  always a good time i've been here a few times and it's a similar story!",UNK
4432,Ok place for a lunchtime burger or breakfast.\n\nThe food is consistently okay but not great.\n\nThe staff are also ok. \n\nOverall the place is remarkably average in an area with places that are much much better.,UNK
4433,Boars Head meats and cheeses .... Salads are great and burgers are the best by far .... Yummy,UNK
4434,"Great caf\u00e9. Great prices. I am there every week. They just revamped the place. (New Look) The only down, would be leaving there with my clothes smelling like cigarette smoke. Check the picture of my chicken dinner that I have every week. Delicious.",UNK
4435,"Decent GC, just like the others I suppose.  Went into the Platinum room and looked at a $24K Telecaster...don't see that every day.  Friendly staff offered to plug in guitars for me multiple times.",UNK
4436,"I ordered the mole and the chicken was dry. Way to expensive for what we got... But then again, is all about presentation. I can say It might be called or look like Mexican food.. but no flavor.",UNK
4437,I have to thank brittney for her wonderful cupcakes.  I own a local catering company her in vegas and she did some cupcakes \nFor a client of mine. They were so impressed by her yummy desserts.  Thanks brittney for a job well done!!,UNK
4438,"Our favorite Chinese place in town! We love their pork fried rice, beef & broccoli (yum!!), and sesame chicken. The dumplings are also great. We really appreciate that they deliver to our house, and fairly quickly!",UNK
4439,"DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME. RUDE!!!!!! Dale was a shitty bartender/server. We complained and it got us no where. Its true its all about who you know, apparently Dale knows someone. Id ether cook popcorn in my room microwaze then deal with Dale.",UNK
4440,"$5 pizza, OK wings, awesome crazy bread... What more needs to be said. i will say this location is a bit cleaner than most but all-in-all it satisfies my craving for pizza with minimal damage to wallet.",UNK
4441,What can I say other than this is a great plaxe for CRAFT BEER. Tou should come here too!,UNK
4442,Trashy place. Rude bartenders. Weirdos and perverts overwhelm the place and it is more smokey than any other place.,UNK
4443,Some dishes better than others. The service was bad. Poor service! Our waiter thought it was more important to buss a table than to get our forks while our food was already at our table. Do you expect me to eat Meat with a spoon? Luckily the manager saved the day by bringing everything we asked for.,UNK
4444,"$35 non locals, $21 drinks (double shot though black label on the rocks) Lmfao was there and it was popping. Champagne showers all over the main dance floor. Free shots for some girls in front. Lots of classy only look no dance girls every where. This place could use another room with different music.",UNK
4445,"This store is the best!  I sold quite a bit of my gold there some time ago and they definitely gave me the best price...more than double offered by other establishments.  They are friendly and courteous and not only would I go back there, but I recommend them to others all of the time!",UNK
4446,We enjoyed the breakfast buffet - not too large and overwhelming like some can be.. Good atmosphere and nice music played at just the right level!,UNK
4447,"J's has had an exterior remodeling, the stores look brand new!  It is time to get some alterations done, I am off to J's in Scottsdale!",UNK
4448,Worst dentist ever!!! Too many giggly stupid girls working there and not knowing what they are doing ! Over charging customers and not caring about people in pain ! Place should be shut down ! Phone calls are not returned when promised - absolute disgrace !!!!!!!!,UNK
4449,"The orange juice was good, the service was friendly.  My husband got the chocolate chip raspberry pancakes, and I got the banana pecan French toast.  They were both ok.",UNK
4450,Salads are good - but everything is very expensive and the manager treats the employees like dirt.  I've seen it first hand multiple times.,UNK
4451,Got a white mocha frappaccino with caramel sauce blended in with an espresso shot!  It was amazing!,UNK
4452,I'm from Atlanta so I am used to frequenting the Vietnamese restaurants on Buford Highway north of the city. I had been trying to find good Pho in Charlotte and was told to try this place. The soup was pretty good not the best I'd had but definitely is worth trying.,UNK
4453,"I was charged $130 for a $60 tire, $20 for $10 tire tape, and $20 to put the tire on the rim. Outrageous",UNK
4454,They need to train the staff better on how to respond to clients.  They are not busy and the clerk could not take the time to tell me the different oatmeals they serve she just pointed at the board. That is just lazy.  I was the Only person inline.,UNK
4455,Added a 15% gratuity for bad service for 2 people. Each order put in takes 20 min. Food was decent but takes way too long!,UNK
4456,"I love this place! The store is clean and the people are friendly and professional.  They always make you feel welcome, and go out of their way to give great service.",UNK
4457,"Came here just to return cable boxes. It was obvious what we we doing, since we were standing there holding them. John could clearly see it. He chose to wait till we were next in line to tell us that the procedure was to check in first. Rude. Annoying.",UNK
4458,"EVERYTHING I ate here was superb. I bought the Travelzoo for this 1 too luckily I also bought 1 for LA as well! :) #score The appetizer spicy tuna, Cesar, seabass and desert were wonderful",UNK
4459,Best meal we ever had! No kidding. The bone-in rib eye was cooked to perfection with amazing flavor. The 2lb lobster was out of this world and the oysters were incredibly fresh and tasty. My husband and I couldn't stop talking about the meal days later.,UNK
4460,I went here on Tuesday witch was cool because it was taco Tuesday... however it took 50 minutes for the food to get to the table and the taco was made with a premade shells you would get at Safeway.,UNK
4461,"Not much flavor in The steak sandwitch, lots of meat but not a lot of taste, very expensive for lunch, we spent $20.00 for the 2 of us. Atmosphere not good for dinner. Just a lunch joint and not that good, probably won't go back",UNK
4462,"Well, once again I tried it for chance. Still the rude son of a bitch New Yorkers with extremely high prices for the shit they serve. Let me tell you, GO SOMEWHERE ELSE! YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT.",UNK
4463,"Great gluten free bakery. We asked about ordering a specific loaf, and she was very accommodating to our request. Even picked up our loaf the next morning, and it was warm and fresh baked. She gave us instruction on storing it to last longer too.",UNK
4464,"Cute and good spot downtown especially when you are trying to be good.  Had my first chocolate vegan cupcake here and it was amazing. \n\nCurrently doing the Daniel fast and have had the zucchini pasta which is good and getting the quinoa which I have had in the past, also very good!",UNK
4465,"Awesome!!! Great food, awesome chicken fingers and the etouffe is pretty good, probably a 4 out of 5. Great prices for what you get!!!",UNK
4466,Holy cow! $2 mimosas and bloodys til 3 every day. And many to choose from at that. Try the blue cheese Bacon burger!,UNK
4467,"Great little sushi place with respectable owners, chefs and waiters. The prices are really reasonable with over 50 different sushi options. The hours here are also perfect for people like me who are random. Overall great sushi shop!",UNK
4468,"My colleagues and I went to parsley for work today. We could not have been more satisfied with quick service, and the food was great! Love the chicken kabob salad it was very fresh and juicy!",UNK
4469,"Loved the show!!!! The best part about this particular show is the audience engagement. I absolutely loved the huge blanket covering the whole show. Who doesn't love the Beatles?! Great dancers, great costumes and best music.",UNK
4470,"I really love going to Pita Jungle, the wait staff is always very friendly, and the food is Great.  Im a big fan of the Salad made of fruit.  So big a fan in fact that i cant remember the name of it.....mmmm",UNK
4471,Bad bad service!! We just walked out because the hostess gave us attitude for wanting a booth. 8/12/12 12:45pm,UNK
4472,"Extremely disappointing. Waiter was the worst I have had in a long time. Appetizers were missing ingredients. Pizza was okay but did not meet expectations. Seriously, Sbarro's would have been a better choice. Not worth the $100 meal.",UNK
4473,We went there during happy hour. The food was very good. The place was so loud that it was an effort to talk to the rest of the party. I know that they think that loudness creates an ambience but it was painful to sit there we had to leave so we could have a conversation,UNK
4474,"Food is ok, but worst customer service ever. Employees standing idle and chatting while customers wait for service. No trays to put the food on. I felt like I was an imposition on their time not a customer. I've had better customer service at Taco Bell.",UNK
4475,"Excellent, sprawling beach house pub place that feels like a friend's house. Great atmosphere, good live music and jam sessions. Sadly they stop serving their \""light bites\"" menu after 3 pm but will try it again. A great pint and good craic to be found. Worth a visit.",UNK
4476,We come here when I don't feel like cooking Filipino food myself and have a hankering for Crispy Pata or Lechon Kawali.  They know us here.  They always speak to my husband in Tagalog and he answers right back in English. They always know our usual orders.  :),UNK
4477,"Nasty ! Just gave this Native one last try and again terrible food, 35$ for burnt cold food and poor service.  Do yourself a favor and save your money and your stomach. Enough said",UNK
4478,I had one of their Italian beef sandwiches on 3/8/13 with two co-workers who ordered the same sandwich and two hours later we all had similar intestinal problems. No extra charge for the colon cleanse.,UNK
4479,"Food is good and staff is friendly, including who I assume is the owner. Lots of tvs and they prioritize Cardinals games. My only problem is that sometimes if its really busy the staff gets backed up. Overall a great place to watch the game.",UNK
4480,"Recommend, ordered delivery from here when I was working late and the food was great.  Had orange chicken, egg foo young, egg rolls, and white and brown rice.",UNK
4481,"I just love getting my hair cut & colored by owner Victoria! Her professional/cutting edge style, fun personality, & passion for her work has made me a loyal client for 5 years! I can trust that my baby fine hair will always be handled with the upmost care. Thanks Victoria in making me feel beautiful!",UNK
4482,"A-OK, just like the rating is meant for.  Nothing special for what you're about to pay here.  It's not bad food either but it's just A-OK",UNK
4483,The worse service I've ever experienced. It too almost an hour to get our food and then my granddaughters pizza was cold. We sent it back and it took another 20 minutes.,UNK
4484,Omg. This place is the best. The milkshakes will cure any bad day. And  the staff is always very nice! I'm a regular....,UNK
4485,"Something different in the valley! You got to try this place.. Alligator and dirty rice, mmmm so good. Its kind of hidden though.",UNK
4486,"The service was outstanding. The food not so. My \""firecracker\"" (wontons fried with fillings) were so overcooked they were hard and like rubber, the burn taste ruined the meal. Good service and great coffee but I will stick with Macaroni Grill.",UNK
4487,"Healthy and satisfying. I had a rice bowl with \""chicken\"". It had tons of flavor. Also tried the BBQ sandwich was was yummy too. Great place",UNK
4488,"Great atmosphere but the food was not good at all. The brisket was undercooked and tough. They try to cover that fact with a ton of bbq sauce. It sucks for the staff there because they were pretty good. If you want a motorcycle atmosphere with cafeteria food and Harleydavidson prices, this place is for you.",UNK
4489,"Damn good superior quality food. What a gem this place is. The menu is small, sandwiches, salads, drinks. Everything they do is home made, the bread the cheese. The veggies are local and or organic. It has a very original twist, you can't find anything even close in the area. Love it!",UNK
4490,"The ice cream here is tasted excellent and each ball is too big. But Outstanding is the complete sales room. This is wonderfully made retro. Even the modern cash register is hidden behind an old wooden box. For example, the US must have felt and tasted in the 50s. Be sure to go.",UNK
4491,"Okay perhaps this is a poor analogy, but unlike MacArthur, I shall NOT return.  The only redeeming thing at this restaurant was the amazing flamenco music and dancers.  The lamb chop tapas were not very flavorful and overall the service was abysmal.",UNK
4492,"Amazingly friendly and jovial baristas, best iced coffee on Carson st, roomy sitting area, and a pretty large variety of drink choices. This is my go to place for meet ups and pick me ups!",UNK
4493,"Went back for another lunch a week ago and the quality had dropped so far down that we will not be back. The server was good and attentive, but the food was not tasty or attractive.",UNK
4494,"Love this place!  My babe and I always come here when we are in town.   Try the pitchers...real good.  Roxy is the best!  Ask for her, she will take care of your request.  THANKS ROXY!",UNK
4495,Food was alright. I couldn't help but over hear the staff complaining about work/customers. I won't be going back.,UNK
4496,Spotted in due to flight delay. The big comfy brown lawyer seats is what attracted me in. I figured I could get some work done. I ordered a non fat vanilla iced tea. It was pretty good. I noticed the prices were a lil bit more expensive.,UNK
4497,Peter and Kim are so talented!!! I never leave disappointed! They are my go to salon and I drive out from Galleria  area even when I need a nail fixed! Very clean and very professional.,UNK
4498,"Pizza was good but the service was awful, look if you don't want to work then just go home, they pay you to serve the customers, not to stand there and sigh because we want to order food. Pissed me off. No thanks, I'll spend my money elsewhere.",UNK
4499,"Lots of options for a very reasonable price ($23 for all you can eat), very tasty sushi and great service so would definitely recommend!\n\nCons:\n- Not on the strip, bit further out \n- Interior is basic",UNK
4500,"So sad, been going to this place regularly for the last 1.5 years.  They had the most amazing spaghetti sauce.  Then they changed, each week it seemed to get a little worse, until my last trip when it became obvious they've just given up and are using a jarred sauce.  They've lost this loyal customer.",UNK
4501,Only 15% goes to help the people they are raising money for.  Clearly they are in it for the wrong reasons. This makes me sick.,UNK
4502,This place is definitely awesome! Never have I seen a more organized and fancy Filipino Restaurant here in Vegas before! And they've got great lunch specials! I recommend the Dinuguan! :),UNK
4503,"Plane landed late after being held up in Denver waiting for a flight crew, Got here late, and hunger, this was next to the hotel we were in, so we headed over, and although it filled us up ( and did not feel right), we have not been back their since, and will not go go back.",UNK
4504,"Same 3 star food as any other location, but here they seem much happier when you are headed out the door than when you come in. Evidenced by their never asking but assuming your order is to go.",UNK
4505,"I'm not a vegan.  I'm not even a vegetarian.  But I would totally become a regular here if I lived nearby.  Cheap, fast, very tasty, and the live music is a nice touch!",UNK
4506,"Nice and cozy little restaurant. I ordered the fried catfish po boy and it was fried to perfection. Pretty much anything that is deep fried on their menu is bomb. Unfortunately the etouffe we ordered was under seasoned. Other than that, the service was good.",UNK
4507,"This is my favorite place for pizza delivery. They offer a nice thin crust that's not greasy and a sauce that tastes great. The jalapeno honey wings are excellent. Don't be scared of the \""jalapeno\"" part. They are not hot at all. Just sweet and sticky!",UNK
4508,"Two hours later, still waiting. Others checked in after me seen. Service has gone downhill in the past year. And new policy of holding debit card isn't the best. Harder to fight inaccurate charges",UNK
4509,"A good enough type of place, good enough to satisfy you but nothing that sticks out that would make you wanna come back.  If your in the area and just need a bite this would be a toss up between McDonalds, McDonalds is cheaper.",UNK
4510,"This place is just not my fave. Classes are so big that kids are not engaged as much as they ought to be. Dance instructors are inconsistent. My daughter had a different instructor every week. Decent prices, small location, friendly staff. S1 just didn't live up to my standards.",UNK
4511,"Friendly staff, nice decor for the area, prices are just \""ok\"",. The only complaint is\nNeither myself or my friend liked the coleslaw and couldn't finish eating it . \nNew place so it might take time to work out the kinks.",UNK
4512,"To-date, I have had no issues with Charlotte Douglas International Airport, lol. I've only had layovers here and can't comment on the check-in experience. However, the food court space has a decent selection of foods so I'm content.",UNK
4513,"Good produce for a good price!  Among the local grocery stores, Sprouts probably offers the best value.  And there are always good weekly deals!  The processed foods are a little pricy, but that's only because they are organic or specialty foods.",UNK
4514,"Ambience is perfect. Beautiful views and real country feel. The problem is the the food is marginal at best, actually the food sucks and it's way overpriced. $15 for a hamburger??? Are you freaking kidding me?!?",UNK
4515,"Great atmosphere, good service. Excellent food. I ordered the taco, enchilada, tostada combo. Very delicious. Loved the beans and rice.",UNK
4516,No assistance towards close to closing hour shopping. Feeling that they're more concerned about getting home than helping customers. Blonde woman cashier in 50s-60s with uppity attitude. This town needs a food co-op rather than another mega-corporate market pretending to be serving the interests of food-conscious people.,UNK
4517,"See photo of supposed \""half-sy fries\"". I mean, c'mon JITB. Even I could guess-timate what 50/50 looks like.",UNK
4518,"stopped here this weekend, late afternoon, and got some shriveled up donuts.... should have gone to Krispy Kreme!!!",UNK
4519,"The beer and music are so good that I can't give an honest assessment of the food.  I'm usually two litres and one huge pretzel in before I get any sausages, weinerschnitzel or other German delights.  I don't even know what I eat here...honestly.",UNK
4520,"Tried the \""All Lump\"" crab cake after being assured it was as stated on the menu, no surprise....no lump to be found !!",UNK
4521,Now this is what Phoenix has been needing. Green sustainable courier service! This company rocks downtown Phoenix and the valley! Well done indeed!!,UNK
4522,"No wifi in room even motel 8 has it,\nbig turn off, no shuttle,$ 20 per day extra charge  if u book via Priceline, poor customer service.There is no coffee or fridge in the room.I am not returning to this hotel.",UNK
4523,"This place has had awesome bread since day one. Whatever else you walk out with is just a bonus. Actually, I have to say that the produce selection is getting noticeably better each time I walk in. I still don't think it's quite suitable for everyday shopping, but it's coming along pretty well.",UNK
4524,The breakfast burritos are great.  Not cheap with the fixin's and the tortilla isn't all wet from the eggs 5 STARS\n\nThe chicken tacos are disgusting.  It tastes like awful chicken chow mein on a hard taco.  0 STARS,UNK
4525,"Can't go wrong at Ruth's.  Quick service, and you're going to get a damn solid haircut.  Great prices, too!",UNK
4526,Wow pizza was good didn't expect this in Sin city....pesto and lasagna pizza was great.. P.s the service is even better than the food Great people and great food what else can you ask for after vegas took all your money...,UNK
4527,The Henry has delicous food and great service. Stopped in for a quick bite and left extremely satisfied.  Can't beat the location and ambiance of The Henry.,UNK
4528,"This is by far and away the finest Greek food I have ever had!  Thank God I found this place as I will be eating there often.  Fantastic flavors, portions were plentiful and the service was wonderful.",UNK
4529,The pizza was pretty good. Greasy and cheesy which is important to me.\n\nThe only things I would change are the service and the pricing. A little too pricey for what they offer and the guys behind the counter have ZERO personality or social skills. They are literally a-holes to everyone.,UNK
4530,"On an adventure metro trip with the wee daughter, we happened upon this restaurant. What a great surprise! Fantastic food (we had the chicken & goat platters), nice ambiance and the owner/chef was super friendly. Absolutely recommend!",UNK
4531,"I've been here 4 times and it is always delicious! I get \""the great\"" sandwich. Yum! Fries are pretty awesome too. Make sure you use that dipping sauce they give you (it tastes pretty good on the sandwich too). Wish I lived closer or they had one in the Raleigh area!",UNK
4532,"Rooms are spacious and well appointed.  But the bathrooms are FANTASTIC!  Nice marble bathtubs, great amenities.  Love it.  Always want to stay here.",UNK
4533,"AWRS came to my home to repair my AMG alloy wheel and did a great job, I will definitely use them again if need be. thank-you",UNK
4534,I hate that MOST of the Roberto's cooks never wear gloves while cooking food ! They even sprinkle the cheese with their bare hands! Disgusting !!!!!!,UNK
4535,You would think they would turn the air conditioning on!! Everyone was sweating and hot inside our theater. It is July- we don't want to come in from the heat only to pay to be very uncomfortable while trying to enjoy a movie. It's too bad because the theater itself is nice and I would have liked to come back.,UNK
4536,This is why I like this Verizon location. It is more laid back than the other corporate Verizon locations. And being more laid back the customer service and waiting times are less than the other corporate Southeast metro Las Vegas stores that I know of.,UNK
4537,"We tried this place based on the reviews and were very disappointed. The staff was very friendly but the food was incredibly bland. Chicken was dry, beans were flavorless, as was the rice. The salsa must have been Pace mild. Maybe I caught them on an off day but won't take my chances.",UNK
4538,Is good hamburger!! But my low point is for the service. We wait during 10 minutes or more and never receive any waitress. We complaint with the manager a she was very good cuatomer service!!,UNK
4539,"I have to say this about the best pizza I have had to date. Compared to the rest of Vegas and the Wynn, the prices are pretty reasonable. I ordered two pizzas within 4 hours of each other and split a banana split while waiting for the second which was also tasty.",UNK
4540,The only shop we use in Vegas and we live in the far northwest. The guys are really knowledgable and they have great detox and smoke supplies.,UNK
4541,Big portions and reasonable prices do not make up for under seasoned bland food. It's hard to make breakfast undesirable but this place managed to do so. The service was excellent and the reason two stars were given but not worth visiting here again.,UNK
4542,Great experience at Rose Rabbit Lie.. felt like a scene in the Great Gatsby! The setup is definitely not your traditional nightclub. Starts off with dinner/show then turns into the club. It is a brand new club so some nights are hit or miss. But def see a lot of potential for this new club.,UNK
4543,"Good place to watch a game, the bartenders were fairly attentive but food service time was poor. After 30+ minutes waiting for an app, I canceled the order and asked for my check.",UNK
4544,This is one of the best steakhouses that i have ever been to. Everything that we had was amazing. The inside is a very dark modern style. If you in vegas looking for steakhouse this is the place to go.,UNK
4545,"Very generous portions.  Had a quesadilla for lunch and it was very good.  While they give refills for the ice tea, they only give a can when one orders a soda.  If were to order a drink, I would probably order the ice tea, which I have heard from the members I was with, was good.",UNK
4546,This place was AMAZING!!!  I ordered the pulled pork and it was soooo tender.  This is the best BBQ I have ever had.,UNK
4547,"Based purely on the collection and location, this store will not be on my list of places to return. The store is overall very small and a bit oddly set up, although it is in the process of opening I feel this places collection is rather small containing mainly new comics.",UNK
4548,"Consistently excellent and inexpensive food, especially the OL GAHT (eggplant puree), Samoosas, and Lemon Grass Beef. \n\nThe Ever-famous Pad Thai and the Green-Lipped Mussels are good but not musts.",UNK
4549,"Updated from my earlier review:\nYou're right, Edgar, the only thing you did wrong was to allow Gabriel Guel to represent himself as your business. Hopefully you've corrected that now.",UNK
4550,I had never heard about this place until one of my instructors mentioned it . When I walked in I was immediately greeted . The whole staff was very helpful and they had a big selection. The prices were good too ! I will definitely be back !!,UNK
4551,Started with fish cakes (pempek palembang) and beef rendang (rendang dating). Everything was very flavourful. Rice was sticky and cooked to perfection. Rendang was a moist curry not too spicy and beef was tender.,UNK
4552,I use to love this place but then I ordered a grilled cheese today and found the cheese wrapper cooked into sandwiched I'm done with them they never even apologized or sounded surprised,UNK
4553,Food is awesome for a bowling alley!! Nachos seem like they make their own chips and buffalo pizza is insane. Can't complain about $1 bowling on Monday retro night,UNK
4554,I have eaten here a few times. The first few times were good but the last two times my food order has been wrong. The staff don't seem to care. Crazy but service is really just as important as food quality when it comes to restaurants,UNK
4555,"Under duress from Chef Roy, I must say this is THE spot where I hangout!  Food to die for, great staff, and home away from home atmosphere!",UNK
4556,"I was in town on business and it was close to my hotel.  I was a solo diner, and my service was not very good, but the food was.  I'd go back, but bring a book again to keep myself busy while I waited to be taken care of.",UNK
4557,"it's already been said in every other review, but the Mattress Factory is pretty amazing.  They have installations that are extremely unique and orginal.  You won't find art like this anywhere else in the city.",UNK
4558,Horrible expirence on Black Friday! First off I had to use the restroom I go inside and there's blood on the walls & sink! Gross! Second it took 30 min just to pay cause there systems weren't showing the Black Friday deals they were advertising. Overall I would never go there again!,UNK
4559,The ku Munk was rich n full of flavor. The broth was seasoned to perfection. But I don't know how they sleep at night charging $16.88 for a bowl of ramen n veggies. Just seems a lil outrageous.,UNK
4560,Staff was rude. Hotel room was ice cold and I found a dead roach behind the toilet. No tables were open. Like 2 and they closed 1 hour early. Pass this one bye. I found all the other hotels in the area to be nicer with much better rooms and gambling options.,UNK
4561,"One of my favorite places to get sushi in Arizona.  Their prices are very reasonable and the sushi is very fresh.  The cooking table is fun too if you'd rather have some cooked stir-fry type food.  I'd recommend eating there before 7 pm, because it gets really crowded anytime after that.",UNK
4562,"Fun place; watched Jackass 3D here. It was pouring though! The downside of this place is the parking... Adding to the fact that it was raining, the way to the theaters were uncovered and therefore really let me wear-in my new manolies. Oh well. I love how there's no tourists, too.",UNK
4563,"You are my sweet sweet retreat from over processed Vegas-ites. Humble thanks to you ole D.D. \n\nSHUT UP AND DRINK, will ya'??!!",UNK
4564,"The breakfast buffet has been upgraded since our last visit and now includes a free Bloody Mary.  We each enjoyed an OJ and fresh fruit with strawberry yogurt.  The remainder of my meal included an odd, but tasty egg ranchero as well as a dollop of corned beef hash and some home fries.",UNK
4565,This is the worst shoe repairman that I've ever met in my whole life he charges way too much money and he doesn't do a good job his job on shoes is horrible you're going to pay overpriced for something that he doesn't even fix I don't recommend this man to anybody,UNK
4566,"We go to Joe's at least 2 times a week. Pizza by the slice is great, everyone has a different option, this is perfect if you eat with a group. \n\nI enjoy the pizza and the staff here, if you go at lunch time during the week you may run in to me.",UNK
4567,I used to go here all the time when I was living in summerlin. now I'm in henderson. not too far but I wish they made another one! best coffee and salads! their interior design is so cute reminds me of the city SF or NYC!,UNK
4568,"Best Pizza in all the valley! I'm from New Jersey and know what a good Pizza should taste like . Add a  friendly staff,  a cozy place for dinner and you have a perfect experience.",UNK
4569,Food is good but the portions are small.  Prices are on the expensive side considering how little you get.  I'm not saying that I would never go back...but Mimis won't be on my list to visit again anytime soon.,UNK
4570,Stopped by here for the first time and the food was the worst. Had the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich and there was a tiny strip of chicken on a hoagie bun covered in lettuce.  The waitress did not know the selection of beer. BTW the beer is the best this place has to offer.,UNK
4571,"Disappointed. Food was awful, not good at all. Tried it once and probably will not come back again. I will go else where for real quality food. Service was blah. Overall, not a good experience. No thank you!",UNK
4572,"Great sounding venue. Nice Monday open mic. Seems a little clique-ish, but there is some great talent that comes through from time to time. I played here with two bands too. The house sound guy kind of sucked for us because we weren't \""pro\"" enough for him. Dick.",UNK
4573,"Had a Burger and salad.   Bun was stale tasting.  Salad had more cabbage than lettuce and served in a tiny bowl.  I was not impressed.  I will have to try something else next time.   Very noisy inside, so if that bothers you...",UNK
4574,"Slices consistantly satisfies my cravings for pizza. I've been to different locations, but the Mill Ave location is by far my favorite of the bunch. It's not the best pizza out there, but I give them props for variety.",UNK
4575,"For the most part I like Yogurtology.  What I don't like is their somewhat tart, sour taste of some of their frozen yogurts.  I don't understand the manufacturing process, so I don't know why this happens, but it makes me wish they were a gelato place instead.  Sorry!",UNK
4576,We had my sisters grad party here and they entertained and served all 16 of us perfectly. Food was great & portions were big. \n\nWill def. be back,UNK
4577,"Way cool that is all I can say!!!  We also walked by and thought it was a strip club, but then peeked in and it was a very old school dining room..  Great service and food.. Had the Salmon and it was to die for..",UNK
4578,"Awesome sandwiches. The quality is great and they are consistent. The staff is friendly and helpful. But they are expensive, very expensive.",UNK
4579,Tofu Pad Thai yum. Some crazy good soup which I can't remember the name of Tom Thai Goon or something.  Chicken in the fried rice was a little dry.. maybe stay away from the chicken dishes. :),UNK
4580,The ambiance is awesome!! I love what they did with the church. The service and food was good as well. Nicely priced as well.,UNK
4581,"I just picked up 15 pieces of dry cleaning. It totaled $125. It would have been $140 without a coupon. \n\nThis is just ridiculous. I don't care what kind of service you claim to have, there is no reason for this.\n\nI will not be back.",UNK
4582,"If you want something quick and pretty good \""asian food\"" go for it.  I wasn't disappointed it was exactly what I expected.  The old Teriyaki Chicken Bowl from Jack is better.",UNK
4583,"after purchasing a groupon online i scheduled an appointment to get my photo-shoot, and day of I could not make it and Adam was very rude and told me that I was basically out the money payed for the shoot, very unprofessional and I would choose someone with more class.",UNK
4584,I will never come back to this restaurant again. The worst service I've ever experienced.  Watch out for being overcharged on your bill.,UNK
4585,"Everyone there is super friendly, always has my prescription ready when I call and never gives me any trouble. They take pride in their customers and it definitely shows in their customer service skills. I have never had a bad experience there.",UNK
4586,"Cheap prices, but it will cost you time.\nFirst, you need to take  a second shuttle from the car rental center off the Las Vegas airport. \nSecond, found a 1 hour line to rent the car when I arrived at the Fox Rent A Car location.",UNK
4587,"Harrah's has really got to do something about how hidden this place is, we were staying there and still didn't even know it existed until we went to the pool. Unique ice cream experience, to be sure; make sure you get everything with cheesecake in it for maximum enjoyment!",UNK
4588,"Shit service. One guy running the place that was cooking, taking drink orders, serving, washing dishes...etc.  The food was not that good IMO.",UNK
4589,"Went this afternoon with my husband baaad idea!  Both got the original cheesesteak my husband w/mozzarella sticks, I with chili fries.  His mozzarella sticks were still cold and my fries were hard.  Then we both have had stomach cramps and other issues the rest of the night.",UNK
4590,First time ordering from here and the food was great! The price was under 25 and the delivery guy was fast very polite. The family meal said five people..amazing.,UNK
4591,It's just Ice Cream... 4 bucks for a 12 oz blizzard is crazy.. For that money I should have gone to a creamery and had something higher quality...,UNK
4592,This is by far the best Greek food I have experienced to date! It will be insanely hard to top the freshness and quality that these guys provide.,UNK
4593,"It has been awhile since I have written a review for RedSeven, but they never amaze me with how helpful they are and explaining everything they are doing at a very reasonable price. Thanks and keep on doing a great job!!!",UNK
4594,"Slowest deli department in town. They have no sense of time so you know they don't value you yours. If they are attempting to push you to buy pre-packaged this is a novel and effective way to do so, by delivering the slowest and most impersonal service EVER! Fail BJ's",UNK
4595,OMG\nTerrible even my wife likes vegetarian and hated this \nQuick give me a real egg and meat!! Even sub par for veggie lovers \nThe first experience with a yelp recommendation I was totally turned off by,UNK
4596,"This is a ver new and very convenient place to get your grocery or grab a bite during an afternoon break. I don't feel it is as big or as crowded as Lee Lee's down the street on Dobson, but definitely worth checking out. Very clean.",UNK
4597,"Matt's is always really good. You won't be disappointed with anything you order. The quality of ingredients is above that of most places and the service is very attentive. If you're a fan of a really good breakfast, Matt's is one of he best in the country.",UNK
4598,This place is very unique.  Everything is fresh and the ahi tuna burger is the best thing ever.  The staff is attentive without being bothersome.  The decor is nice as well. \n\nBest airport restaurant I have ever been in and I fly all of the time.,UNK
4599,2 words...bath bombs which are great for gifts or yourself.  Great customer service and frequent demonstrations of products...I mean they will demonstrate on each and every customer...that's quite a few bath bombs a day.,UNK
4600,"The mini donuts are gone. I hear they are going to bring some other people in to try and do it, but forget it.\nThe family that ran it made them best.\nIts all downhill from here, Im afraid",UNK
4601,Been here a couple times. I liked the chicken burrito the first time but wasn't crazy about the enchiladas the second time. Nice atmosphere and location and good service. I will continue my search for a great Mexican restaurant in Montreal.,UNK
4602,The lobster quesadilla was not very good. And the other stuff was not good either. Quite disappointed due to the fact it was a 4 star.,UNK
4603,"We love this place! The service is great and the food even better. We really like their Meet the Meat Calzone! It's usually busy at dinner time and you could wait up to 40 minutes, but it is worth it!",UNK
4604,Service was fast and friendly.    Food was just mediocre and not a big selection of choices.  Not seasoned well.  Major complaint was we ask for sausage on the side and they refused.   Not good customer service.,UNK
4605,"Liked the ambiance. Lively music, pool tables.. Feeling young and fun. Chicken wings were great with all three dips. Service was great as well.",UNK
4606,"Like Denny's, but more overpriced. I enjoyed my carrot apple bundt-shaped muffin and had a nice waitress. No ambiance to speak of, unless Denny's is your game.",UNK
4607,I used to like this place - but the guy who picks the song is blatant about asking girls to flash him to move the song up. I can't give my money to a place that so overtly objectifies women. There are a lot of other fun karaoke places in town!,UNK
4608,"I went here about a week ago, and got a hair cut from Andrea. She was the sweetest person and made me feel very comfortable, she asked me questions on how I wanted my hair cut and styled to ensure me my end result would be satisfying and at the end of the session I was very pleased!",UNK
4609,"I'm from Mississippi and am here working for 2 months....\""love\"" this little restaurant! The waitress hasn't suggested anything that I didn't love! It's great food with even better service!",UNK
4610,Hannah is fantastic! She's updated the decor since we first started coming here 2 years ago. It's beautiful. She has a great sense of humor and always tries to accommodate everyone.,UNK
4611,Lots of food for the money! They are fast and food good...our favorite it the beef chimi and asada fries! Both are huge! Staff is always friendly.,UNK
4612,Always late!! Have never had an appt that I did not wait for over an hour. They have wasted my time for the last time.,UNK
4613,Such a wonderful relaxing evening. They have a nice little waiting room with champagne and different teas. My massage therapist was very quiet which was great because I just wanted to close my eyes and not think. I had the deep tissue- could have used a bit more pressure but it was basically perfect. Highly recommend!,UNK
4614,"I love this place.Great food,great drinks,and great service!! The apple butter is unforgettable. They have live music on saturdays and great ambiance.",UNK
4615,"This place was super cool! Never seen anything like it, but fair warning it gets HOT inside!!! Wearing comfy clothes that's breezy!",UNK
4616,"Despite being located in the Eureka, the food is really good! The pork belly buns are so delicious. The rice dishes we had were ok, but would definitely go back just for those buns.",UNK
4617,Wow another horrible pizza place on central - I thought fuel was mediocre so when pizza peel came I thought finally a good pizza place but their pizza is even worse. Someone told me their wings were good which I didn't try but shouldn't their pizza be good - I hate wasting money (and calories),UNK
4618,"They have a nice selection of stuff, but watch there food...I personally found several items past the expiration dates. I forgot to check the hostess donuts bag that I bought and found mold growing in it when I got home.",UNK
4619,"Very good food and service. Brugge frittes w basil mayo is a must. Even though the place is mainly famous for the mussles their meat plates are gorgeous as well. \n\nThe environment is very nice too. However, it is small abd might have a long waiting time in busy hours.",UNK
4620,"No one on the print staff could figure out how to print a PDF document 4-to-a-sheet. The employee turned the computer toward me and said, \""Here, be my guest, figure it out yourself,\"" and then walked away. Seriously???",UNK
4621,"Awesome! Super friendly staff. They talk to customer and not each other (picture classic Seinfeld episode). \n\nThey do a great job, spend tons of time on you and the prices are great!",UNK
4622,"There is nothing wrong with the place, except I think it belongs in rural America somewhere. Maybe an off night (Sunday) but wow, not much to see or do here. You will have a hard time talking to the locals.",UNK
4623,"Not bad sushi, quiet and relax atmosphere.\nThe service is good. The place is clean and the menu is reasonable in price.",UNK
4624,The food is just ok. Veggies didn't seem fresh and the taste was just weird. Probably would not go back. It didn't help to see staff in Packers gear. Go Bears!,UNK
4625,"2nd time here. Came for a dinner with the parents and wife.  Pretzel bites are amazing and reminded me of a childhood treat. The Beef Short Rib Stew was to die for, as long as you aren't scared of a little fried egg. All around an amazing dinner!!",UNK
4626,"this place reeks of fish when you walk in and there are fruit flies everywhere.  Good place to dine if you're on a diet since you will surely lose your appetite.\n\nIf you find yourself at Rolands, do yourself a favor and leave and dine anywhere else in the Strip District.  Seriously.",UNK
4627,One of the older hotels. Doesn't have the razzle dazzle of say the newer hotels. I didn't stay here so I can't comment on their living amenities.  But they have the million dollar free slot pool which I won a free buffet on. So I guess it's got that going for it.,UNK
4628,"Food was amazing !!! First restaurant we hit in Montreal .  guillaume was our server , he was great ! Always checked on us . I got the stroganoff and it was above and beyond delicious ! Check this spot out",UNK
4629,"Awesome yogurt shop!!! Wonderful flavors, awesome selection of toppings. Clean and inviting atmosphere. Sydney who works there is always so friendly and courteous to me and my family when we go there for froyo. I highly recommend this place!",UNK
4630,Lacking service.\n\nStopped here fully intending to have a late lunch and some beers on a hot afternoon. Got there ordered the beers which took a long time despite only 6 patrons being in the restaurant and sitting at the bar !! Wait for the attendant to take our order but finally decided to eat some where else.,UNK
4631,Let me just say I LOVE Chik-fil-A!  We went here to get a snack and got a 12 count for 3 of us and I am so glad we pulled into the parking lot to eat them. Apparently whomever made the package couldn't count and shorted us.,UNK
4632,"We are a true fan of the poke in Hawaii. We were so excited to get here LV and find the place. They have it all. Been there a number of times. Always fresh and friendly service. If you know what poke is , then it is definately worth the drive to the North LV for the great kine.",UNK
4633,"Yummy fajitas, but not so yummy Sunday night karaoke.\n\nSkip it and sit outside if you can.  The entertainment is much better!",UNK
4634,"I've been loyally eating brueggers bagels since I moved to Pittsburgh, but in the last few months service has plummeted. I wait for at least 15 min when there is one person in front of me, and nobody seems to know what is going on. I'm very disappointed and will likely be converting to Einstein",UNK
4635,"I was really disappointed. I would describe this establishment as frumpy, dated, and in desperate need of a facelift.  The atmosphere is dark and lost in the early 70's.  The food was below average.  Being from the Northeast, perhaps my expectations were too high, however nothing measured up to even average.  I would not recommend dining here.",UNK
4636,Yet another EXCELLENT dinner. The Parmesan crusted filet was like BUTTAH. I'm am addicted to the Heart of Italy combo. Very good service and The zucchini strips were divine! Chef Rod is Da BOMB!!!,UNK
4637,The barista made my frappuccino really watery and too sweet !!!!!!!! Also the whipped cream is melted ! Target sbux taste way better !,UNK
4638,"I love this place so much. When I plan to come here, it's literally the most anticipated part of my day. The beers are so Damn good and knowing the get the ingredients from Arizona as well makes it even cooler. The food is very limited with options but has always been great. Top notch craft beer",UNK
4639,"I just went and I've got nothing but good stuff to say. Great and friendly vibe, great tattoo by Ross, good music and clean and good setup. \n\nA fantastic place which I will return to when I'm in vegas next time!",UNK
4640,"The wait is so long that the guy sitting next to me in the waiting room... Is sleeping. My appointment was an hour ago, still haven't seen a doctor. HORRIBLE customer service. I'd give them 0 stars if I could.",UNK
4641,"Metropark is such a cool store...great clothes, really friendly staff, and a good variety of price points. An employee told me that there is a Metropark in San Francisco, and I can't wait to check it out!",UNK
4642,It was a first time I had to take one of my pups to the hospital and it was extremely serious. The staff and doc took great care of my little one and was awesome about communicating everything to us. The doc was great about personally calling and then also following up 2 weeks after. I would recommend taking your animal here.,UNK
4643,"It's 2015, what legit business only takes cash or checks? Who carries that with them anymore? I'll take my business elsewhere.",UNK
4644,"Got seated at the bar, menu etc. Another waiter told me to leave and the manager had no backbone to resolve the mess. The food is ok but the place is run poorly.",UNK
4645,We really enjoy the food here... the only draw back to me is that it is too loud to talk to others in the restaurant.  They play old Music Videos on like four TV's and that makes it too loud to talk to anyone beyond those right next to you.  But the food is always good and the prices are good!,UNK
4646,I have seen this show 3 times. If you sit on the floor level you see one show and when you sit in the balcony the show appears different. It is a must see show.,UNK
4647,Wow almost no Donuts. About 10 total. The ones most people dont eat. And when asked they are not making any more. It's 930 am your open till 8 pm.,UNK
4648,"Best gyro meat anywhere!  Not greasy, full of flavor ... just plain ole yummy!  Love that it is just down the road too!",UNK
4649,"A fantastic blend of eclectic atmosphere, inventive menu, and world-class execution--that's Liberty Market in a nut-shell. The line may be long, but it's absolutely worth the wait! By the way, don't forget your camera. The surrounding Gilbert historic district is full of great backgrounds...",UNK
4650,Good place.... we had fun there it was not packed which for our kind of night was not bad....... will be back there again....,UNK
4651,Atmosphere and staff are legit. I liked the beer enough and a lot of people we spoke to raved about it but from what I had it just wasn't for me. I like how connected to the community this place feels but will be snobby and continue to cling to my west coast brewery bias.,UNK
4652,"If you are looking for a great transportation company in LV, Elite will deliver! They are very easy to communicate with and their fleet is ridiculous! If you want the ride of your life though, ask for Inferno!",UNK
4653,"I'm always a fan of Cuisine Malaya!  The food is best at lunch because it's so cheap.  I always get the pan fried noodles... it's good.  Oh, but if you're not in the mood for noodles... the curry fried rice is amazing.",UNK
4654,How things have changed since our favorite server left more than a year ago. I used to swear by this place & told many how great it was but that was then. It has been almost a year since I've been back due to the last few times having been pretty bad. The food was just not the same & the service was shotty.,UNK
4655,"Very, very good donuts.  If you're on a diet have just one... and when you start to feel guilty about it have another to remind yourself why it was all worth it.",UNK
4656,Overrated.  Overpriced. Overcrowded despite half the restaurant being empty (they crowd you in one area to make the place appear full).  Part of a hotel although most customers were locals. Food deserves 3 stars but atmosphere lacked comfort and elegance.,UNK
4657,"Wow the turtle pie!!  And everything else I've ever had here.  Try to avoid the upstairs seating, it is disconcerting to feel the floor shake everytime someone walks by.",UNK
4658,"Cold unseasoned French fries, flavorless burgers, overly priced for what is being offered. No thanks. Never again. One and done. But the setup is a nice idea.",UNK
4659,"Tea....and Champagne never looked so good together.....while I don't drink either....the layout is phenomenal. If your every visiting the Scottsdale Quarter peep into this locale and you will be amazed. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!",UNK
4660,"Very expensive and steak was not very good.  If you are going to spend this kind of money go somewhere that knows how to make a steak and has natural grass fed, T-Bones blows this place away for about the same cost.  \nWayne Gorsek",UNK
4661,Great local country atmosphere. Very down home and simple. Food was good though they forgot the cheese on my eggs    . We'll be back if only because it is hard to find any family friendly breakfast joints in QC.,UNK
4662,My son-in-laws ONLY and favorite dollar store!   It appears there are lots of items to buy for the house and they even have a deli section in the grocery part of the store!,UNK
4663,Amazing customer service.  I got the teriyaki chicken w/rice lunch special.  They had it ready for me to pickup in 15 minutes.  It was great and high quality.  I'll definitely be returning.,UNK
4664,"This place is great if you want a mess of greasy, stringy meat soaked in way too much tzatziki. I wanted to take out my stomach and hose it off after eating here.",UNK
4665,"New York style pizza by the slice, with several options ready to be thrown into the oven. What else could you ask for...\n\nWtih the addition of  a friendly staff, comfortable environment and great location - two thumbs up.",UNK
4666,We tried the plain jane pep pie the other day. It was good but the speciality pizzas are the way to go. I sampled a slice with mushrooms and caramelized onion and OMG that was really good. \n\nThe service is still top notch and the Tuesday specials are great.,UNK
4667,The quality of the food on the happy hour menu has gone down. Ordered the calamari and it came out stale and mostly all batter.,UNK
4668,"Service was slow but friendly. Food was as expected (standard chili's fare, no better, no worse). The raspberry margarita is great.",UNK
4669,Love the popcorn here. Prices for movies are always high and going higher but I get good value here when I make a special trip for a big release on the XD screen,UNK
4670,Pretty classy joint for a decent weekend price. I think we've found a new regular spot for when the wifey and I bang vegas.,UNK
4671,The one lady that seems to be the only one up front there ever is very rude and unfriendly. She makes you feel stupid for asking questions and always seems put out,UNK
4672,"Super fast service. Waitress never came back for followup. She just dropped off the food. Food was alright, good if you're a local. Not a destination restaurant.",UNK
4673,"Great food, amazing service from our server Brent was superb!\n\nArrowhead Grill is the nicest place West of Central.",UNK
4674,"Good poker room and great structured tournaments. Some of the wait staff is a little ride. They carded my friend for a bottle of water. Yes, water.",UNK
4675,"Best experience ever! Bought my car here, everybody was extremely helpful and friendly! From the first person who talked to me, to the department manager Frank, down to Todd out in the service department. Next time I need to purchase a car I will come back! Thank you for the wonderful customer service!!!!",UNK
4676,"I will make this short. I love sushi and this was the worst, most flavorless sushi I have ever had. I guess I have been spoiled by Hana's Japanese Eatery and the freshness and quality there. I did enjoy the cocktail which was called the Ahsosuki.",UNK
4677,"The atmosphere was excellent, the food was an unpleasant experience on the pallet; there were too many complex elements in the food and could not finish any of the dishes I ordered.\nMaybe try it again when the menu changes",UNK
4678,If you're looking for over priced shoes in tiny sizes then this is the store for you! No slip resistant work shoes for under $70 or in larger sizes.,UNK
4679,"I had a blunt today. First time here. It was a good sandwich. I got in early so beat the lunch line. I liked the atmosphere, but the table was dirty from the previous customer. Problem was though that all the booth's were dirty (table or seat).",UNK
4680,"Loved it. The restaurant is small, minimally but tastefully decorated, and it's the closest restaurant to authentic Japanese food in Pittsburgh.",UNK
4681,I like this location. I have been 10+ times and I believe that the employees are generally upbeat and hard working. I have always gotten an even spray tan without complaints & the Versa has a heater in it to keep your warm despite the cold spray.,UNK
4682,"Truly below average Thai food. Service was lousy. We had to ask for water more than once. The server never greeted us, simply walked over and asked if we were ready to order. No Spring Rolls.",UNK
4683,"I've eaten a ton of Thai food...no, like a TON of a Thai food, there is a place to get Thai on every corner in Chicago. I have to say, the flavor was very bland. Nothing that made it memorable. The service was great but again, the dishes were just bland.",UNK
4684,"Mike @ magic bumper is a really honest guy. His work Is excellent and his prices are the LOWEST anyone could possibly find around Las Vegas.\nHe fixed my bumper just like nothing had ever happened to it., BRAND NEW !!!!\nCouldn't be any happier .",UNK
4685,"Fancy diner,  with plenty of choices.   My salad was a bit limp. The lobster tacos just so so, kind of boring on the sauce.  But overall fine.  Key lime pie and coffee,  were excellent.  With  ok service, a happy ending.",UNK
4686,"Super disappointed. The \""huge\"" nachos literally only had toppings on the  very top. Half down it was plain chips !?! Barely enough to share for two people unless you like eating plain chips. BUT the margaritas were great! That's it!",UNK
4687,"The pizza was good, drinks alright, but service was extremely lacking. It felt like we were a bother to the wait staff. I don't think I would return here.",UNK
4688,"The pizza is not bad full of cheese. Probably more cheese than anything else... Even bread. The poutine is average, was not a big fan of the fries. The service was great and delivery was very quick.",UNK
4689,Food was ok once we got it. Waited over 30 minutes for a burger at a burger place. Got there before the lunch rush and ordered right away. People seated after us were almost done eating when we got our food. Won't go back.,UNK
4690,Expensive for how plain the food was. I was pretty disappointed. Got the tomato basil scramble... Nothing special. Could have saved some $ and made it better at home,UNK
4691,"Terrible customer service. Unbelievably disappointing, I would walk an extra mile or five to avoid ever coming here again. Food was mediocre for being traditional.",UNK
4692,"I really wasn't thrilled with the prices, service, portion sizes, or decor.  I think this place needs to figure out what kind of bar/restuarant it really wants to be and make adjustments to reflect that.",UNK
4693,"Amazing!!! Everything is so good-- iced coffee, green tea, chicken salad, tuna salad, Italian baguette sandwich, snickerdoodles, inside out brownie cookie. Omg",UNK
4694,"As a copperfield fan since the 90s, I have three words to describe this show: Phoning. It. In. He could at least appear to gaf, instead of looking as if he would rather be in his special place than do a show.  Great illusions. Horrible showmanship.",UNK
4695,99% music and dance games with a couple old classic arcade games. Employees didn't even seem to acknowledge our existence. Felt more like a mortuary than an arcade.,UNK
4696,"This restaurant is definitely a step up from what use to be on campus.  It is a Mongolian bbq.  The price is ok, not too bad with the student discount.  The pomengrante lemondade was pretty good.  The food is good but it really depends on what you choose to put in the bowl.  I would come back.",UNK
4697,Good do it yourself yogurt. Good flavors and toppings. Biodegradable spoons are a nice touch and shows care for the environment.,UNK
4698,"I love this place. They have good food and a friendly staff.  It has that back home feel to it.  Good place to watch football too.  I just with they had more beers to choose form. Other then that, its amazing.",UNK
4699,"over priced. \nwatery coffee. \nnot strong at all. \n\nhowever, their frozen lemonade is amazing.",UNK
4700,"All make this short and sweet, eatable but nothing great.  Prices too much for this over-hyped place.  Had the Giuseppe sub for lunch, alright but was wanting more stuff on the inside. Sandwich was overpowered by the bread.",UNK
4701,"This is a fantastic ballpark!\nGreat views (especially at night games), excellent views of the field from most anywhere in the park, dirt cheap tickets, tons of tasty dining options, friendly staff everywhere, and the location right downtown is so accessible.",UNK
4702,Just in from a 7 hour ride and needed a cold one with a snack.  Saving room for a buffet later this evening.  Cold beer brought quickly followed by the standard hot wings and chicken strips.  No complaints!,UNK
4703,What? I don't get it.  Why the heck does this place have so many 5 star reviews?  The food was bland and meh.  No thanks.,UNK
4704,The crab hushpuppies are sooo delicious! You HAVE to get them! Their falafel is good too.,UNK
4705,I've only been here once and I had a torta. It wasn't bad...just okay. I'll probably go back sometime in the future,UNK
4706,"Awesome food, I would rate the taste of food as better than Thai basil. Staffs over weekend are not friendly. And I don't prefer this place for A-la-carte but best for the weekday lunch combos.",UNK
4707,Have been here for drinks a couple times. Finally decided to try the food. After asking for a food menu and getting attitude we left for somewhere else. Sorry if our business was too much of a hassle for you.,UNK
4708,Absolutely incredible flavors. Service and environment is wonderful and had no issues whatsoever. I am eternally grateful for a restaurant like this. There is not nearly enough island flavor in the city and I feel The Breadfruit certainly represents it. Thank you!,UNK
4709,It was juts ok but I'm picky with my pizza. The sauce had a weird after taste. The cheese was weird. The staff was kind of rude. Eh. Pizza Hut is better.,UNK
4710,My girlfriend and I have been here on multiple occasions and think it's definitely worth going. The menu has a lot of variety and there's lots of different sake and beer available as well. The atmosphere is pretty relaxing and it's never too loud or busy. The baked rolls are our favorites.,UNK
4711,"This is an old dirty hotel, if you want a cheap dirty room this is the place for you. Casino is the same smoky and not very pleasing.",UNK
4712,"Ordered the tiger prawn last night to accompany a salad & wine BUT I was brought shrimp tempura instead; without any questions or explanation of the substitution. Not sure if they thought I wouldn't notice, but I definitely do know the difference between a PRAWN and a factory farmed SHRIMP. lol",UNK
4713,"Food is tasty, but over priced. It's simple things put together. Service took long for one meal to go. A nice place to have a Sunday brunch though.",UNK
4714,Sweet and Spicy pork was good but overall food was average (Korean beef was like what I have had so many times before and the squid was over-cooked too chewy)... Good music and atmosphere though!,UNK
4715,Just watched Godsmack. I need to say...Godsmack rocks! But how sad we couldn't hear any of Sully's vocals over the instrumentals!!!  If I didn't already know the words I wouldn't have understood the songs.  Sad!,UNK
4716,"I have been here about 6 times. First 3 visits after opening the food and service was beyond excellent. Last visit was nothing short of ridiculous, we sat around 20 minutes before I had to get up and complain for lack of service. Food portions seemed to be skimmed down.",UNK
4717,I only go here for the late night menu and on the late night menu I only order the salmon sandwich and onion rings and it's love.,UNK
4718,Love their garlic fries and southwest egg rolls. Their beers are pretty tasty as well. I usually opt for whatever their seasonal is (right its the SummerBrau- nice and light).,UNK
4719,"Food is not that great, service is poor, weird atmosphere. Pretty dark inside and feels kinda gross. I wouldn't suggest dinner here. My friends enjoyed the Bahama Mama cocktail.",UNK
4720,"I had the burget and it was OK. Found it a bit dry, but still overall tasty. The calamari was good and a large portion.\n\nI do not recommend the poutine. The gravy ruined it.",UNK
4721,Great little location for a quick bite to eat.  Very casual and you order at the counter.  I got the Basil Mascarpone Burger that everyone has been talking about and it is fantastic.  I will definitely go back for more.,UNK
4722,These guys are rip off's!!! Will try and illegally tow you! Do not use them!!!!! Beware of this company,UNK
4723,"They upgraded us to a bigger suite and it was beautiful. Close to the clubs we wanted to go to, isnt as far off the strip as we expected, its actually practically on the strip. The only thing about Trump is that there arent any clubs inside the hotel nor are there pool parties here at their pool",UNK
4724,Great brunch deal! There will be a line if you arrive later than 11 am on Sunday because a 15-bucks buffet that has tons of wonderful food and one free coffee or juice or Bloody Mary just sounds so damn good! I love their waffles and egg Benny!,UNK
4725,I felt compelled to write an update on my latest visit.  The chicken was awful! It had a funny taste to it.  I can't seem to put my finger on it.  It did not taste like chicken nor did it look like chicken.  I felt it was way overpriced for what I got.  I will avoid from now on.,UNK
4726,"I don't know how Greek food could be made to be bland but uh, Shomars has managed to do it! Sure, the place was clean, service nice but the food was just food and by NC standards expensive! So, no we will not be returning.",UNK
4727,"Great simple bar. Servers have a heavy hand which is always welcomed. Food is better than decent for bar food. Cheap drinks, usually a good crowd. I hadn't been in almost a year and they all remembered how I took my drinks. 3.5 stars.",UNK
4728,"Sandwiches are good... but when I went to their nutrition facts I was appalled by how much sodium is in one of these! Maybe indulge here once a year but other than that, the sodium will kill ya.",UNK
4729,"Ate here with a group.  Everyone enjoyed their meal.  Can wait to return to Vegas to eat their again.  I had the brisket dog, so yummy!",UNK
4730,For a concert arena it was really big and I liked it. Afterwards it got very crowded and I felt a bit uncomfortable. Overall- nice place.,UNK
4731,Delightful! Delicious! Trund was our Chef.. ask for him. The food was excellent and theentertainment lightened our dining and made the dinner more fun!,UNK
4732,I went to the liquior store last night to pick up a few Coronas. Everything was fine until check out. There was only one clerk on and the self service area was not working. What should have been a 5 minute in and out took almost 20.,UNK
4733,"For a burger place they don't ask how you want it cooked, not many options and the service is mediocre.. Sorry and they is plastic cups for sodas instead of reusable .. Super wasteful not environmentally friendly",UNK
4734,"Jenny at Diamond Nails is a gem. My gel no chip manicure lasted three weeks and was worth every penny! She takes her time and never rushes and is just a really nice lady. Even though I live 30 minutes from this salon, the trip is well worth it.",UNK
4735,This place has the best pita sandwhiches i have ever had.  Their pickles and hot sauce are my favorite ingredients.  The only thing that sucks is I typically want to go on Saturday and they are not open.,UNK
4736,what beats friendly gas attendants PLUS mcdonald's? nothing! gas + food in the desolate southwest Las Vegas area before hitting the freeway and easy access down blue diamond road.,UNK
4737,Food is Delicious!!! Just went two days in a row.  The manager is very friendly and doesn't mind sharing her favorite dishes!!! My mom seemingly the pickiest eater ever....is able to find something she loves or at least put it together.,UNK
4738,Didn't think it was anything special. I actually have a headache from trying to eat \nthe hard baguette the sandwich was on.,UNK
4739,The line was a little long but the service was great and they had great selections! I got the asian salad for lunch and a coffee that was nice and fresh...good morning accomplished.,UNK
4740,They did a terrible job! I'm very disappointed. I never had a terrible job like this. I would never ever go back again!,UNK
4741,There is a REASON WHY the pizzas here are $5.  All it takes is one bite.  \n\nBut I kinda agree with the other review.  This would be a great meal if I were homeless.,UNK
4742,One of the best nights out I have ever had in Las Vegas. We did this for my boyfriend's 35th birthday and had such a great time that we're going to do it again for my birthday. The limo driver was 10 minutes early and was very flexible about whatever we wanted to do for the night.,UNK
4743,For a sit down Filipino restaurant I expect better. The food is blah I will only return to try breakfast but other than that I'll stick to my buffet style places or home for Filipino food.,UNK
4744,So far have waited an hour for one burger and one baked potato + one drink has been incorrect. Apparently the machine failed to register the order so discount ahoy,UNK
4745,Been here twice this week. Great quality and food selection. Clean and good ambiance. Love the crab legs and fresh oysters. Yum! Highly recommended.,UNK
4746,I ordered the handmade sausage and mushroom pizza and it was delicious. They were friendly and very fast. It's worth the money.,UNK
4747,"Weak margaritas, stale food all around. While the wait staff was very nice, the food and drinks were pretty terrible. Will not be back...",UNK
4748,"pricey but good.\n I have always really liked Chick-Fil-A, but don't eat there a whole lot because they are pricier than the other fast food options out there",UNK
4749,Easily some of the best Mexican food we have had in Charlotte. Had the enchilada mixtas and started with some guacamole. Really enjoyed it all. Solid service. Tuesday 1/2 price craft beers is an awesome special!!,UNK
4750,"We went to Joe's Diner after Denny's was packed. I recommend this cute local place. The service was pretty good, yummy food, no wait.",UNK
4751,The food taste fresh and is really good.  I always get the singapore style noodles and shrimp fried rice.  No silverware in my to go bag the last couple of times so I had to wait to get home to eat.,UNK
4752,The prices are very reasonable and the goods is excellent! I would definitely cine again! Try the San Francisco Style French Toast! The omelets are light and fluffy and the service staff is very attentive.,UNK
4753,"Love the VEGAN menu! Thank you so much for so many options. Atmosphere was fun and the food was quite yummy. They had tasty shot specials which made dinner even more fun. Their pesto cauliflower (yes, vegan) was just delicious, even for carnivores. Impressed overall.",UNK
4754,"One of the best hiking trails in Phoenix. Close to the 101 Freeway and convenient to grab a bite to eat after your workout. I've even seem MTN. Bikes on this trail system, so single-track or Sunday stroll, it's pretty much good for all skill levels.",UNK
4755,"Worst panda I've been to. little food and stale. they charged me a dollar for a shrimp item, just to find out there was only 3 shrimps and the rest vegetables and it was rubbery. disgusting.",UNK
4756,My expectations were higher. Is not that impressed by my meal. The service was good and friendly however they did not give us 15% discount even though they promised when I showed coupon from yelp. Prices also higher than $$. I would say it is $$$. So 3 stars from me. Overall disappointed.,UNK
4757,"Great atmosphere, delicious food, and excellent service. The sushi here was very good. I highly recommend trying Cowfish-Charlotte.",UNK
4758,Went there after seeing Man Vs Food. The sliders were wonderful. Most of the sanwiches were in the $12 range. The server was quick and attentive. We will definately be back!,UNK
4759,"I love the food here, and great great service.  I love to sit on the patio in the spring, it is a very nice atmosphere.  Plenty of good food to choose from on the menu and the portions and sides are generous for the prices.  Never had a margarita so can't judge that but the beer tastes good.",UNK
4760,rude service and no vegan options. they didn't even try to offer mediocre service. wow. maybe it was just a bad day.. but i'd never bother to go back or suggest the place to anyone.,UNK
4761,burger was okay. \n\nservice: bad. We were checked on once and that was so the rude waiter could take our order. He just wanted to fool around with his friends in the back. They were yelling and laughing.\n\nSave your money go to smashburger or fuddruckers.,UNK
4762,"This place is gorgeous. They had decent music, nice bartenders and plenty of seating. I went for a private party, so I didnt have to deal with it being cramped or meeting weird people. The pool area is beautiful! As far as ambiance, this is my favorite LV club!",UNK
4763,"one of the best chinese food here in phoenix. you have to tell them to use less salt. because often times, the food just a bit too salty. other than that. it has great selection for Szechwan style food.",UNK
4764,"An hour and a half later and cold, over priced for bad service. I used to really enjoy this establishment, however; I've been coming here for years and the service has been getting progressively worse, regrettably I will not likely be back, I wouldn't recommend this to anyone",UNK
4765,Daniel in target Mobil needs some serious training! Two hours to but an activate a cell phone is outrageous! Worst service I have ever received! I will NEVER be back,UNK
4766,"Being a fan of the $2.99 crispy chicken deluxe, which comes out to $3.87 when I upsize to medium, I made it a lunch stop. It served its purpose by filling me up at an inexpensive price.\n   On my visit here, the service was fine. The restaurant was also clean.",UNK
4767,This place is always out of beer they have such a great selection but never available and the food is terrible. It's only good for a beer or 2.,UNK
4768,"DONT BOOK A ROOM HERE. This place is disgusting, stains on the sheets, dirty bathroom, the floor in the room is stained and extremely dirty...just don't stay here!!!!!!",UNK
4769,What more can I say about Olimpico? Do you want the best coffee in Montreal? Come get it from Olimpico.,UNK
4770,Every stereotype of a mechanic shop taking advantage of an eighty year old woman was in play recently when my mother was able to spend more than her pension check after taking her car in for an coupon oil change!  DO NOT GO THERE!,UNK
4771,"This store is in a fun neighborhood. The idea is great, but the execution isnt. I don't like how they have their older books organized. they had them sorted by year when I was there instead of subject or author, which made them a pain to look through.",UNK
4772,"Once your inside ANYTHING GOES! So bring ur own chair and security guard for your flip flops. Total chaos. FYI kids have been arrested for \""flashing\"" there. bathrooms needed attention. I went 3 times and then SOLD MY season passes!",UNK
4773,I love this place! I had the Tiger Roll which was delicious and the Taiga Roll was very fresh and also delish. Will be coming back to try some of the Thai dishes. Love how I can have both of my favorite Asian cuisines in one place.,UNK
4774,"I ordered a cab online the evening before I needed it to get me to the Badger Bus. The cab never showed up. When I called,  the dispatcher was rude and unhelpful.",UNK
4775,Horrible Service and very average food. Blown away by all these reviews.\n\nThis is basically IHOP with a full bar.,UNK
4776,1 star for attitude! Yelp indicated it was open at 10:30 so we showed up excited to try this restaurant. The man at the front said they opened at 11am. He dismissed us and wasn't very friendly. It has great reviews but attitude matters!,UNK
4777,"In Vegas on business,  went with with 2 other guys. Service and wine were good, steaks were mediocre. Not done even close to how ordered. One medium was very rare, one medium was well done.  Same with sides.  Steak fries had strange taste.",UNK
4778,After hearing the commercial a 100th time on the radio I decided to finally try this place. First impression was the shitty attitude of the girl working the register. When I finally got my club sub I was really unimpressed. I won't be coming back anytime in the future. There's way better options in Tempe.,UNK
4779,"I don't think this place gets good credit. Ordered last night it was good. Sesame chicken was great, delish!",UNK
4780,This my favorite place to eat authentic mexican food. The workers are polite & friendly. The atmosphere is neighborhood friendly. I always  tell my friends about this place. Villa's Mexican Food is what makes Laveen an awesome place to live & eat.,UNK
4781,My bud and I have enjoyed the table for years. We had breakfast there today and whatever they have done to their corn beef hash is disappointing and one of the worst breakfast mealsI have ever had. The service is slow and unorganized.,UNK
4782,"Chicago style steakhouse with an exceptional wait staff.  Decor is (mostly) baseball memorabilia, jazz for the background music, food is wonderful steak house fare.  All ages, young, old, in-between were enjoying food and conversation.  Get reservations before you go.",UNK
4783,"Great good and service.  Way better then Tacos El Gordo.  The only problem is that they're way too far from my house, but worth the drive",UNK
4784,"I like it, I don't love it and I don't have to have it but once in a while its nice to please my sweet tooth.  There are so many different combos of cream you can mix and match.",UNK
4785,"Mediterranean Cafe is delicious, and it is cheap to boot!  The only downers are that they only take cash and there is always a line out the door for lunch.  However, if you want to be seated the line does move fairly quickly and they will start on your food before you're seated.",UNK
4786,"First time at restaurant. Big screen hard to see when seated right in front of it but the overall \""views\"" were nice.  Waitress was ok seemed a little busy and food was normal bar food.",UNK
4787,"Pizza wasn't that great and was ridiculously overpriced, almost laughable. \n\nBut hey, it was late and we were starving. \n\nThe hostess was dense, but our waitress was friendly enough. \n\nWon't be back.",UNK
4788,"Great Indian food.  Perfect amount of spice.  Quality of the food will make you forget about the price, until you get the check  :P\n\nMinus 1 star for price only.  Great food and service.",UNK
4789,Great friendly staff.  Awesome snack on these hot days especially for the kids.  I only dropped a start because they are a little heavy with the syrup.  The kids surely don't mind but I prefer a better ice / syrup ratio.,UNK
4790,"St Francis is hit and miss. Mid day - they just don't get customer service - they want to tell you all about their issues, we are changing shifts, the kitchen is changing over etc..\n\nBurger was average.. Come on St Francis you are better than this.. Step up.",UNK
4791,What a great place! Great service even better food!\n\nBeen to all the big name sushi places and this one is up there.\n\nWill definitely come back!,UNK
4792,"Drove by this place numerous times on my way to other pizza joint. Bad decision! We decided to give it a try and man I'm glad we did. Seriously the best pizza I've had hands down. Great bar selection and great Italian food aside from pizza. Give it a shot, you won't be disappointed",UNK
4793,We've been for brunch and the food was delicious.  We went for dinner to celebrate my sister & her husband's anniversary and the dinner was even better than breakfast.  Service was friendly and attentive.  The restaurant was a lot less busy too :),UNK
4794,Been here more times than I can count! Service really is not good but their happy hour prices and offerings make up for it. On sundays they have happy hour all day long in the bar area!,UNK
4795,"This was a very interesting place. It's full of sports memorabilia, nearly covering every wall and ceiling. The server was very professional and knowledgable. The prime rib was delicious but too fatty for my liking. Twice baked potato was excellent along with the cheesy toast app. I recommend it if you're a sports fan.",UNK
4796,Horrible! Service sucked. Had to ask hostess to get a waiter. Messed order up and 3 people got served before 4 order was put in. Worst food ever!,UNK
4797,"very busy and loud, tables are a little cramped.  Food was pretty good, not outstanding, service was very attentive and good.",UNK
4798,This place sucks really bad. It's in the ghetto and has a cafeteria feel the place and the food. It's dingy I would not recommend this place at all.,UNK
4799,"Poor service. Talk you into getting car vacuum, clean windows for extra. Car not vacuumed or windows cleaned. Shisters!  Don't go there.",UNK
4800,Extremely inconsistent to say the least.\nIve had decent food from there and also terrible food from here.\nIts pretty inexpensive but definitely not worth the chance.,UNK
4801,"Quick, friendly service. The Spinach Feta Omelet was delicious. Prices are reasonable at this nice little diner.  The decor is outdated, but the food and friendly wait staff make up for it!",UNK
4802,"I love Fez.. the food is fantastic, service is amazing, and the atmosphere is basically perfect.  Eat here... do it...",UNK
4803,Super mediocre .  Words added to met min word counts. This limit is dumb.  I hope you have a great day. Skip this place,UNK
4804,"For a first time \""tanner\"", I had a great experience!!! Never thought I'd see myself with an even tan!!!! Can't wait to go back for my next round!!!! I'll be summer ready before the summer even gets here!!! I luv it!",UNK
4805,"I caught you, older gentleman employee who stuck your hand in the food bin and helped yourself to a snack!!!! gross!!",UNK
4806,"Great margaritas, great beer selection, great home made salsa on the house, and home made Mexican. Nuff said.",UNK
4807,"My favorite chicken spot.  I would recommend calling a head.  Takes a minute to deep fry delicious chicken. On the one day a month with I need a fix, this is where you will find me.  They marinate their chicken overnight and even feed the less fortunate on Christmas Day.",UNK
4808,"My buddy turned me on to this place, and I'm so glad he did. I have no complaints at all... I like everything and anything about this place. Pastries, coffee, and it's a next to Pane Bianco  Ooooooo!",UNK
4809,I went here with a couple of co-workers and we all had the buffet.  The line was not too long and they had an ample selection of Indian food.  The Lamb Curry was rather tasty so I went back for seconds.,UNK
4810,I talked to the owner to request a 1 hour donation to deliver a cake for a 4 year old little girl in hospice. The owner was extremely rude and claimed that he gave to charity often and doubted the validity of my story. I would not recommend this place to anyone.,UNK
4811,"Best breakfast of our trip, thanks to the honest input of our server. After we ate, she took us on a tour of the performance area and VIP spots.",UNK
4812,"Its one of these places, where everybody tells you how cool it is and how good the food is. But the food is average, quite often cold (as calling the client names is very inefficient) and the food is far away from the supposedly organic/healthy image this place has.",UNK
4813,"They're quite lucky to have such a great location, and I imagine that explains much of the crowd inside. The sushi was mediocre-ish to bad, and the service was seriously lacking. It's a shame, as it sort of ruined my birthday to eat there...",UNK
4814,Expensive and not that good ..the food is kind of bland. Being Jamaican myself they could do so much better. Will not be going back unless it's for something they don't cook. I was not impressed at all.,UNK
4815,I hear there are usually long lines but lucky when I went it wasn't bad. I enjoyed my panini. I hear the breakfast is excellent.,UNK
4816,"I love this library! 5 floors, quiet study areas, plenty (except for finals week) of group study rooms and computers, and a coffee bean too! Im sold... open till 12 on school nights is a plus as well.",UNK
4817,I didn't eat here. The rating is because of the rudeness of the staff. I guess they figure if they're busy that night they don't need to be polite to other potential customers. Just average politeness would be appreciated.,UNK
4818,Found this place going from the strip to the mts.  Great chicken place. Chicken was fresh and crispy.  Everything tasted good and seamed reasonably priced.,UNK
4819,"We thought this buffet was at the California so upon arrival we followed the signs and ended up at Main Street Station.  It's an OK buffet, but nothing really stands out.  The service was ok, the food was average, but the parking was free and the Freemont experience was close.",UNK
4820,TERRIBLE!!!!! That's all I can say. We had to wait for  two and a half hours just to get in and it was not worth it at all. It was so crowded that we couldn't even move. We left in 5 minutes. Will not come back.,UNK
4821,Standard McDonald's mit sehr vielen Sitzpl\u00e4tzen und Bahnhofshallen-Flair!,UNK
4822,We looked to Yelp for dinner ideas while we were in Chandler during Spring Break. Best decision of the trip! The pizza was fantastic (love thin crust pizzas) and the salad was amazing. Everyone was happy and full when we left. So good!,UNK
4823,Good for corporate work functions - but not necessarily what you want at home on a Saturday night... I do admit that I continue to order it as the location is so darn convenient - perhaps I need to try more than just the pizza?,UNK
4824,Not a fan. They emailed me after receiving 650 worth of work to say I still needed 900 more. News to me. When I emailed them back I heard nothing. Hasn't fallen apart in the several months since so I guess it was a mistake.,UNK
4825,The best place in Vegas for gyros. I've had gyros in just about every place in town. Hands down this is the best.,UNK
4826,"UPDATE: They closed! \n\nPolite staff, clean tables. I enjoyed my catfish. A great place to go to just shut up and eat.",UNK
4827,Well. We are done trying them for pizza. Maybe we will go back eventually and try their actual food but the Pizza is very VERY bland. The White pizza (riccota) tasted like the least flavored pizza ive ever had.,UNK
4828,"Too bad the food was amazing, because the kitchen focused on getting 1 party's food out, 6 other tables had to wait for their food more than 45 minutes.",UNK
4829,"it's best buy....come here when you want to run your credit up some for good fun and electronics. No matter how slow it is, parking lot always full. Weird.",UNK
4830,"I love some of the people who gave this place 1 star just so they could be different and go against the grain.  I mean come on people, Phoenix has some of the worst restra",UNK
4831,Terrible Billing Dept!!!! They lost my lousy $6.58 payment and put me through Hell trying to prove it was paid - Total IDIOTS,UNK
4832,Went here expecting more variety! The name is sort of misleading! Very limited to Oriental food. Not that bad but too pricey.,UNK
4833,Had great service just like all the cold stones I've been to. But I don't come to cold stone very often because it's over priced.,UNK
4834,I like flip! I gotta be honest and say its name is what attracted me in the first place but I also love its concept and after a few naughty days of eating myself silly i decided to get a beef salad with hot chilli sauce! It was quit nice! They have lotf of nice healthy things to try so would probably come back.,UNK
4835,No margaritas. Just beer and wine :-/ what's a girl to do. Indulge in some dessert maybe :),UNK
4836,"Lots of beers from Wisconsin available, but only one cider.  Food was OK; we were directed here from a cheese shop because they offered fried cheese curds.  Pretty hopping place!",UNK
4837,"Looking for some Chinese buffet, came across this place. Wandering in it was not busy and the buffet was depleted of everything. Finally the kitchen staff started bringing out items and filled up the buffet, only good thing about this place. Pretty bland, not worth visiting!!!",UNK
4838,overpriced california/italian food.  Small portions.  Lunch service is slow.  Don't expect to be out of there in an hour.  Patio in the summer is a good place for a leisurely $20 lunch.   Decent place to take a visitor if you on an expense account.,UNK
4839,So good! The Sierra Nevada mustard is artisanal af!! Recommended to me by my awesome server Emily. Definitely ask for her,UNK
4840,"Good simple burgers. Made to order. No temps, enough fries on one order for two. And the fries are a bit soggy.",UNK
4841,"Had a couple of meals while RV camping nearby. Excellent food and a wonderful mom & pop restaurant. Staff is eager to please, and the fish tacos are grilled to perfection. There is a nice outside seating patio when the weather cooperates.",UNK
4842,"Their beer selection was super, but pricey!  I got a Yuengling and it cost $4.75.  Hmm?  The service was pretty good and the food was alright, it just seemed a little overpriced.",UNK
4843,"This was one of the worst Burritos we ever had.  Chicken meat had skin strips, beef was hard to chew, mashed pinto bean was tasteless, and to top it off, the waitress was mean and argumentative. \nWe won't ever go back!",UNK
4844,Maggie trimmed my bangs and I was very disappointed with the result. The bangs were cut too short and unevenly. I have to pin them up until they're long enough to trim again. I definitely would not recommend her!,UNK
4845,"I don't understand why it takes so long when they are not busy at all this morning, but 45 minutes is not acceptable.http://www.yelp.com/",UNK
4846,"This place is just an average Gyro joint. Flaming kabobs and haji baba are at better, but when in mesa and you need some gyros this place is alright",UNK
4847,"This place still has some of the best lunch specials in the Southpark area.  Before I spent two weeks in Thailand, I thought it was great.  Now I just think it is one of the best choices in Charlotte.",UNK
4848,I love their shrimp cocktail.  They also have great breakfasts at any time of the day.  The downside is it is small and the wait staff is hit and miss with service.  Go for a pie or shrimp cocktail during off time and you won't regret it.,UNK
4849,"I went there for Spring Traning 2012 and they had drinking fountains, YAY! Also, I paid $26 to sit a few rows behind the dugout whereas it would have cost me $20 to sit in the grass at Scottsdale Stadium. This is the best place to watch a ballgame in The Valley",UNK
4850,The bagels are good. The sandwiches leave something to be desired in the taste department and the coffee is over roasted. Everything is a bit over-priced for what you get. I have never had a problem with the customer service.,UNK
4851,By far some the best Thai food I've had while living in Las Vegas. Amazing food and the prices are amazing. Two people can eat here for less than 20 bucks in most cases.,UNK
4852,LOVE LOVE LOVE Chick-fil-a.\nSoap in the bathroom smells like nasty ass.,UNK
4853,"Just ordered from this restaurant , had it delivered \nThis was a Saturday evening they delivered within 20 min , (we were about. 1 mile away ) but still for a Saturday that was very good.\nThe food was very good and the crispy fried noodles were excellent \nNot disappointed at all !",UNK
4854,Its right next to Denny's so Im Just sayin...if you want better diner food come here to.... Get a order of Chicken Nachos and a beer  to stop that hangover chief.,UNK
4855,"LOVE the firefly but the extra drive to paradise will be much better served. The kids who staff this location are slow, uninterested, inefficient, and inattentive.  For tapas style dining especially, that kinda ruins the experience. Poor management sense; poorly run business.",UNK
4856,"we got married there one week ago and if I had the choice I would absolutely do it again. Kent the Elvis is wonderful, the photos and video we got were great and the whole experience was fun and still romantic!",UNK
4857,"I've now been 4 times and I know I'll keeping coming back.\n\nThe service is excellent, the food great & mom & I love the casual atmosphere. We've enjoyed everything we've ordered.",UNK
4858,I love a Yoga studio that has the flexibility that an accommodating a rotation of classes. They have two rooms here which makes it easy to fit into your schedule. Heat levels are adequate and the instructors rarely stray from the official Bikram dialog which is critical in my book.,UNK
4859,"Food was awful and so was the service. It took over an hour for the food to come out. The tacos and enchilada were gross, stale tortillas and burnt sauce. We sent everything back and just left.",UNK
4860,Soooooo sad this one has closed. Great staff awesome food! Loved to watch the UFC fights there. Really bummed it closed,UNK
4861,This gas station could use a major face lift. It's looks exactly how I remember it looked almost 15 years ago.  The entire the store is cramped but it's place to buy cigarette.,UNK
4862,Very entertaining and lots of fun. There is more to this show than sensuality/sex appeal - the acrobats were oozing with talent and performed to perfection. \n\nDon't sit in the upper balcony if you want a good view.,UNK
4863,Quick service with knowledgable staff.  Nice and clean facility.   I was happy with the care and service I received.   They take all insurance and even cash payment.   Will come back if I need urgent care service in the future.\n\nMG,UNK
4864,Awesome! Have never had anything that I didn't like!!! A hidden local gem! Service is always great and the food quick and served hot. All foods taste super fresh. Visit it at least twice monthly! Yum,UNK
4865,"I tried the Siopao, a pork one and a chicken one.  The chicken one was more interesting, but I liked the taste of the pork one better.  The sauce for them was unremarkable.  That about sums it up:  unremarkable overall.",UNK
4866,They don't realize they are in an airport an people are in a hurry. Our waitress was constantly distracted with having to whip up fresh guacamole instead of serving her customers. 20 minutes for $15 tacos that I have to shove down my face in order to make my flight was not enjoyable.,UNK
4867,Salad was pretty good.  Oven toasted flatbred wrap was excellent.  Good prices and they have some smaller portions if you're not too hungry.,UNK
4868,My wife and I walk down to this place sometimes.  It's a good neighborhood bar with good food and good prices  We went for their kareoke one night and had a fun time.  good hang out spot for good for watching  sports.,UNK
4869,"Tried this today I ordered the carne asada buro, the rice was OK beans were decent the burrito was good but the steak was dry so it killed the taste for a juicy burrito if it was more juicy it would of made the experience better",UNK
4870,Another great experience at this awesome restaurant. Tonight I got the privilege of a tasting (really a whole dinner) that was part of the Viva Las Vegan Fest. Chef Kenny impressed all with his wonderful all-vegetarian cuisine! What a great place! Can't wait to go back again.,UNK
4871,"Took the family here.  I liked it.  Food took awhile but it was great.  Very nice people.  Family run.  I will go here again.   Plus, harbor freight is right next door !!\nUpdate - Have been back 3 times.  Every time was good.",UNK
4872,I love this place for both food and atmosphere.  It's a great place to share dishes with friends.  The servings are generous so everyone can get a taste of something different.,UNK
4873,"Miso soup is loaded with mushrooms and tofu, it has a peppery taste. It was very good. Sushi was good! We had the Pokemon roll and a lunch combo.",UNK
4874,I'm being nice with 2 stars.  This place is overrated.  I heard this was the hot spot to hang out in Phoenix...NOT!  I was visiting from out of town and there is absolutely NOTHING special about this place.  The food was nothing to brag about and the place in general as well.,UNK
4875,"I am a big fan of Pho Minh, and I have eaten here more than a dozen times.  I love how the Pho is served with fresh Thai Basil and lime on the side.  The Pho is delicious, and perhaps the best in Pittsburgh.",UNK
4876,This is where I get my gas a lot because it is usually the cheapest. Best prices for propane also. Clean parking lot and store. Friendly staff. It also has an automotive service shop if you need something repaired or serviced on your vehicle.,UNK
4877,Mushroom quesadilla was quite good as far as airport food goes. Limited beer selection and it closes before 7:30! OK experience but I'm tempted try somewhere else next time.,UNK
4878,"I must say, this place rocks. Just moved into the area and this is now my favorite sandwich shop.  Fresh ingredients always make for a great sandwich. When it comes to restaurants, I'm huge on cleanliness and this place looks good. Can't forget their prices, those are great as well.",UNK
4879,"Great Korean in the valley of the sun! If you're looking for authentic Korean stews and BBQ Korean short ribs, this place is the place to be. I recommend the soon tofu soup with mixes seafood, so bomb!",UNK
4880,I ate here a few days ago with my son and his girlfriend; we were all pleased with the atmosphere and the food.  It was hard to decide what to order because it all sounded interesting and delicious.,UNK
4881,Excellent value for the price. Probably the best way to introduce Filipino food to people. The selection is big and the price can't be beat....,UNK
4882,Huge space and patio! Good check in special and a lot of beer on tap including my fave Left Hand Milk Stout! They featured live music on Saturday night and the bartender remembered us after only one prior stop in.  I like this space albeit a little removed; I'm definitely going back again!,UNK
4883,"My fianc\u00e9 and I eat here at least once a week. Beef yakisoba, short ribs, mountain roll, are just some of our faves.",UNK
4884,"Hired Duane to complete some work at our house. Both times he visited completed the job without any hassles, was extremely professional, courteous, and his prices were fair. Highly recommended.",UNK
4885,"The lady with curly dark hair, short, I think is the owner is soo rude. I was treated so bad when something rang up wrong and I went in for a refund. Your better off just going somewhere else.",UNK
4886,"This is a dumpling restaurant (there is not much else on the menu). They are very greasy and salty, even the steamed ones. I did not enjoy them at all.",UNK
4887,This company Primespeck was one of the bet experiences of my buying a home process.  From being professional to detailed reports.  Kevin went above and beyond he is experienced and knows is stuff.  The written report has been copied and my handiman knows exactly what needs to be done in priority listing.   very Highly recommended.  Thank you so much,UNK
4888,"I can't go beyond.... HOLY MOTHER THERESA!  They really treat you like royalty.  We had a suite overlooking the lake... you know, THE LAKE... and it was absolutely breathtaking.",UNK
4889,"This is, without a doubt, the best Italian food you might find in Arizona. Not only is the food and service great but it comes at a very low price.",UNK
4890,The food here was always on point! Loved the Mac n cheese and the salmon was cooked perfectly as well. So sorry to hear that they closed.,UNK
4891,The pancakes were very good have to say they are better than original pancake house. Although this cafe is very small but clean.. Staff very friendly and knowledgable.. I def recommend trying it.. Get there early due to limited space the wait could be very long but worth it..,UNK
4892,We just got back from a vacation and had the best time this hotel is not super fancy but it is FUN and clean and right on the strip. we will be back.,UNK
4893,"I wouldn't know they wouldn't let me in, pretty much discriminated against.  The door man is not the owner but believes he is.  Thanks for letting me not spend money at your joint.",UNK
4894,"Greg's BBQ used to be here. Greg retired and East 74, which was in Indian Trail, moved here. I had a burger and fries. Nothing fancy...and it wasn't. It tasted fine and service was average. I'd go back for a business lunch or breakfast, but not to impress anyone.",UNK
4895,"Good concept, good location, good service...but the fish is of the AYCE/supermarket variety and overpriced. Big thick cuts of rubbery fish...no thanks",UNK
4896,Walked right in. Bethel listened to me to understand exactly what I wanted and gave me a terrific haircut! Thanks Bethel!,UNK
4897,walking by on kind of a lame night and stumbled upon this place. not lame once inside! had the elk burger with sweet potato fries! goodY,UNK
4898,"Family friendly- good sized rooms, pool open until 10, but don't count on a roll- away bed - they have a self imposed limit of 2 beds to a room. Pillows are big and hard, but softer pillows are available if you ask for them.",UNK
4899,"I've been to Miro a few times now, and have quite enjoyed the paella and tapas.  I really want it to be more of a tapas bar, but their limited selection means that you couldn't enjoy a whole meal that way.",UNK
4900,"The breakfast burritos here are amazing. I always get the #12 with potatoes. The only reason I don't give this place 5 stars is because they charge you extra to substitute things, charge for extra salsa, etc...otherwise, my co-workers and I love this restaurant.",UNK
4901,Great little place for my kids.  Pricey unfortunately but definitely fun time for kids (for going through once).  Not difficult course at all which was good for my crowd...  Guess there is always both side of coin.,UNK
4902,"Very well done pizza...its like a pizza pillow, tasty, savory and rather doughy.\n\nThis is not my favorite style of pizza but nonetheless it was especially good pizza.  The service staff was top notch and the store is very warm and inviting.\n\nWe will be back!",UNK
4903,"I was at Hula for late night drinks on a Saturday. I had the Zombie, and it was delicious. I can't speak much to the quality of the food, but the menu was intriguing. I was satisfied and it was a lovely spot to end a restaurant/bar crawl.",UNK
4904,"About as boring a meal as you can get without dozing off into your plate. Bland, plain and tasteless. The only part of the meal with any flavor was the large piece of salty bread. Avoid.",UNK
4905,"went for lunch.  drab decor.  service was average.  food, i guess was above average.  i've tried the shepherd's pie and buffalo chicken wrap.  both ok though  nothing spectacular.",UNK
4906,"I think the museum was ok. I think the price was a little high for what they had. A few ok movies, a bunch of signs on the wall and a few interactive displays.\n\n  I thought the area 51 exhibition was an absolute joke. No value whatsoever, do not pay the $6.",UNK
4907,Very tasty curry. Amazing fries and naan. And I finally tried goat. I'd definitely make another trip when we are on that side of town!,UNK
4908,The customer service here is obtrusive. I called to make a simple large pizza order & the lady on the phone told me they only deliver to Southern Highlands.,UNK
4909,"This was my worst Las Vegas experience.  The Aria has to be the most overpriced, worst customer service hotel in Vegas!\n\nBad, overpriced food, rude service (lose use of reference) staff.  Stay somewhere else...please!",UNK
4910,New lunch menu looks like you're dining at Steak n Shake.  Prices way higher and portions way less. Dropped wonderful bread crisps and ricotta butter.  All of the southwestern items are gone.  They have dropped the ball on a good thing.  I will not be back until they see the folly of their new ways.,UNK
4911,All those people that claim Mike Ferry is hard ass about taking your money are right. He is old school flim flam man. Gets you to sign a contract and takes your blood. Stay away IMO.,UNK
4912,"The Pasties are fantastic. Deserts are great big enough to share. Definitely a college hangout, but I remembered the louder 70's 80's 90's rock music.",UNK
4913,"A nice little deli, if not a little over priced in some aspects.  \n\nThat said, the staff is very kind and if you're looking for fast comfort food then this place is definitely worth a look.",UNK
4914,Underwhelming and far from fresh sushi. I had the chef inspiration with the green envy roll. The nigiri was nothing special. There are much better places to eat sushi.,UNK
4915,"My husband and I are locals, we went here for our anniversary on a Saturday night. It was our first time and it was great. The waitress was so nice and the food was amazing. Great beer selection as well. We had a nice quaint table outside and loved being able to sit outside and eat!",UNK
4916,Love the chicken pita burger and greek salad. For the price the food is hard to beat and a healthy choice as well.,UNK
4917,I've been here about 10 times and am always pleased.  We always get great service and the food is always outstanding!  The chicken enchiladas are my favorite in the valley!,UNK
4918,"The service was like a Greek tragedy and you hoped the food contained poison so that the evening would end early.   I haven't complained to the manager about service in years, but that changed last night.  While GR's pub food is generally fine, the overall experience was horrible.",UNK
4919,"Went for Mystere, didn't stay at the hotel.  Confusing casino layout, though...just seemed cramped and odd.",UNK
4920,"Forget this place. Bought tires here\n3 and a half year ago, and they would not honor my 4 year warranty. Weather cracks were covered by the manufacturer warranty but the manager insisted that I would have had to buy the road hazard insurance. Shady and evil. Avoid. Their warranties mean nothing.",UNK
4921,"I don't see what the fuss is all about. The food isn't worth going here for, and every other bar in town serves the same beer.",UNK
4922,"Here for Pool League game.  Most tables are well groomed, balls are shiny and nick free.  Plenty of TVs to keep up with NFL Sunday games.  Food is a bit over priced and nothing to write home about.  Service is good, wait staff is very friendly.",UNK
4923,"Love this place! The sweet potato fries are bomb! The waiters are so nice and make the atmosphere even more fun! If you like blue cheese, definitely get the blue cheese burger",UNK
4924,"Waited 30 minutes for my \""fast food\"" when I did get it my hush puppies and fries were soggy.",UNK
4925,"One of my favorite hotels to stay in Vegas.  Be aware of the resort fees when you book, but you get lots of free stuff with the paid fee.\n\nRooms & Casino & extras all very nice",UNK
4926,I bring these donuts in to work quite a bit and always get rave reviews. They are so fresh and so much better than any store bought ones.\nThe service is always good. They also have a great selection.  I highly recommend them.,UNK
4927,Just ok\n\nUnderstaffed and service is very so-so.  Food is very average and typical of a Denny's.,UNK
4928,Love it here. Excellent food. Very good service. Cold beer. Wings are awesome. Tv's everywhere. Great for watching any sport. If you really care make a reservation.,UNK
4929,I frequent this place. Frequently. Enough said :) well... One more thing- shout out to sticky toffee dessert. Please don't ever go away sticky toffee!,UNK
4930,"Awesome Place! Cassie was a gem! All bartenders need to learn from her! We had a couple of appetizers & they were awesome! Can't wait to return in 2014, just hope Cassie still works there!",UNK
4931,"Another once legendary buffet in Vegas.  This buffet is in need of a makeover, once a jewel in Vegas it now looks outdated to me. There are still a few gems in the food selections kobe beef being one of them, but there are far better buffets to gorge your bellies at.",UNK
4932,"It is In-N-Out, so you should know what you are getting.  Company store is across the parking lot for you merchandise needs.  Fairly small location, given how busy it is.",UNK
4933,"I am a pho fan and theirs is more than fair! Flavorful spring rolls with peanut sauce, tender orange chicken, and a delicious house-made coconut water!\nGo and enjoy!",UNK
4934,"We walked in on a Sunday morning, we're seated immediately. The wait staff were excellent, as was the food.  We had 2 more join us and the waiter pulled over another table-no problem.  Some of the best service I have had in recent years in Vegas-sweet!",UNK
4935,"Excellent!  One of our favorite restaraunts in Vegas. Only down side, tad pricy but worth it.  Highly recommended.",UNK
4936,"I come here for the rice cakes and dessert!! I've tried their wonton noodle, and it was decent. There xlb is ok also! But I enjoy the simple casual atmosphere! The building is a stand alone and you can't miss it ! Service is good too!",UNK
4937,"The ribs might have been the worst ribs I've ever had.  Service was bad, I was a little surprised by how busy it was.  Maybe I missed something the first time and should give it another try",UNK
4938,I got spinach cucumber goat cheese with the smash fries the meat was burn and fries was to. Gracie but the was u making order and u getting the number u waiting in the table ur food that s nice u not waiting they bringing ur food,UNK
4939,Warm beer mugs and warm beer...not a good combination if you are a brewery.\n\nPlease get some frosted mugs in that place!,UNK
4940,"I've been eating at Los Dos since they had the little restaurant on Main and Alma School. There is no better New Mexican style anywhere. My favorite, especially when I have a cold (or it IS cold), is the green chile stew. Un-believ-ably good. Enjoy!",UNK
4941,"Once again Yelp..Update!!!! This location is not a current Weinerschnitzel, it's a Loan Mart.",UNK
4942,Fat Heads could be called go big or go home.  Portions are amazing.  I live the grilled wings are great beer selection.  Bloody Marys are spectacular.   Big ass sandwiches.  Yum. So sit back relax and enjoy the ride you can have it all at Fat Heads.,UNK
4943,Happy hour is 4-7. I had the Mr Personality burger with sweet potato fries..my FAV!!  Was good in da belly!,UNK
4944,"Nice place in Old Town. Had the breakfast burrito but was put off by the cheap sticker on the menu asking 25 cents for extra salsa. Good food, friendly staff, nice atmosphere.",UNK
4945,"Wonderful all around! We brought a group of about 20 people there on a Sunday and everything went perfectly. Our server, Chris, was super friendly and took care of our group of 20 people like he was born doing it. And although I hate to use this word, the food really was amazing.",UNK
4946,"Came here for a family gathering. Unfortunately, there are no real vegan options. Even the beans are made with dairy. The rest of the family seemed to enjoy the food, but vegans should come prepared to starve.",UNK
4947,"The food is decent, the happy hour prices are excellent. Amy seems to be very good with the customers she chooses to engage. Unfortunately that didn't include us. \nAlbert is very good. We have been here several times this was the first time we left dissatisfied and the first time Amy was our bartender.",UNK
4948,I ate here on last weekend and thought the burgers were really good. Although... A friend and myself became deathly ill that night. If you ever had food poisoning it is not fun. I know for a fact it was from there.,UNK
4949,"Recently moved to Baseline and was always a customer of the Original Long Wongs on McDowell and 28th street....but I have to say the wings here are better.  These wings had a lot of meat on em, service was friendly and the place is a bit of a dive..but the food is great!!",UNK
4950,I had green chicken curry that was Thai hot and it was pretty good as was the soup.  It was nearly as hot as I wanted it.  The owners are very friendly and want to make sure you enjoy the food.,UNK
4951,"Super Yummy, fast and very friendly service. Large portions, enough that we took some home and the kiddos ate it for lunch. My sons french toast was even good leftover",UNK
4952,"The food here is absolutely delicious, lots of variety and quality, however, the service is pretty horrible! The manager is fantastic, but I really wish I didn't need to call him over every time I go because I'm waiting 20-30 minutes for a drink.",UNK
4953,Food was decent. The nachos were great but the tacos were just ok. Atmosphere was fun but not the greatest meal in Vegas.,UNK
4954,"Waffle nachos were good.  That's where it ends.  Service was slow, ran out of iced tea twice, took 10 full minutes for my kids' shake, and the burgers were bland.  Skip it altogether.",UNK
4955,Took our 2 and 4yr old with us.. the chicken skewers were perfect for the.. tom khai gai soup very good too.  Their website has some coupons and specials so chck it out before you go.,UNK
4956,"Thanks to Rollie & crew, I can now cross this item off my bucket list! Had a great time touring the Arizona countryside and experiencing the ride. They even got me involved with the setup of the balloon which also added another level of interest to the whole experience. Would very much recommend this company to anyone in the Phoenix/Glendale area!!",UNK
4957,"This is probably the best one around. It's nice to hit after the bars close. I always get a cheese crisp and rolled tacos. Surprisingly, they are never greasy like other berto's. On the weekends the menudo at breakfast is good too.",UNK
4958,"Great service, great price!!! I love this place!! Hidden treasure!! The prime rib sandwich was the best I ever had!!! The biscuits and gravy was the best and greatest taste!! I love the fun, friendly atmosphere!!!",UNK
4959,Got the soy mint chocolate chip. Couldn't taste the mint. Overpriced. Slimy. Tiny portions. Lacks finesse. Would NOT recommend. Disappointed.,UNK
4960,Love it here. \n\nSo many designer stores and amazing restaurants. \n\n\n\nThe clothing stores are always having some good deals especially near the holidays.,UNK
4961,"Blah, this place used to be a ton of fun, but then they shut down the tour and everything that was fun about it.  Now it's just a big random bottle and some shops - like we need more shops on the Strip, right?  $7 to go to the tasting floor?  That stuff used to be free, man!",UNK
4962,3.5 stars actually but I rounded up.\nI've come to Cibo a few times for client lunches and I always order the pizza. The patio is beautiful and the food is good too... But I wouldn't say it's the best pizza in Phoenix.,UNK
4963,"This is a great spot for lunch if you are downtown. They have vegan and vegetarian options. I had the vegan stew which was delicious. The menu is seasonal so everything tastes fresh. Everyone really enjoyed what they ordered, with the ultimate favorite being the baklava so save room for it!",UNK
4964,"Friendly, easy going, they didn't have room in the plane but let me try to stuff it above my head, people were obv a lot nicer then at the NYC airport, they were effcient.\nFree wifi always makes my day too. :)",UNK
4965,"The service was a little off tonight, the food was wrongly cooked too, but they promptly replaced it with perfect food and even gave a discount....  We will be back!",UNK
4966,"You don't go here for the food, you go here because it gives the kids something to do inside.  I love to come on a weekday, first thing in the morning with a good book. I order pizza and let the kids play while I read. Perfect for the last days of summer when its 115* out.",UNK
4967,Not much to see here.  Mostly jewelry and crazy expensive stuff.  Nothing for an average person to buy except a $26 t shirt.  Must expensive cotton T shirt in Vegas.,UNK
4968,"Wow wow wow! This is by far the best experience I've had attending a mass! So we attended the Sunday 5:30 mass which is the teen mass, very lively indeed! You have to experience it for yourself. If I lived here, this would be my parish. A W E S O M E !!!",UNK
4969,On the woman's side of the spa the attendants  were lacking and food and drink service was near non existent. They have no cafe or assigned pool waitress. If you want great service see Eugene and he will make sure you are taken care of.,UNK
4970,It's unfortunate that they don't charge a dollar or two. The quality if this theater is in par with dollar theaters. Goodyear needs a quality theater!  Both dirty and poor quality sound.,UNK
4971,What's all the buzz ?! We simply thought this place was okay.The wow factor for us was simply the variety of food offered and nothing we ate knocked our socks off ..... I will say the dim sum was pretty good ..as good as the spots we have here in the bay area but that was it.,UNK
4972,"Just arrived nice place not overly friendly server in the bar this wendsday   more concerned with texting , next up food ????? I ordered the burger 2 paddies  with a couple slices of cheese  and the sweet potato tots the food was 4 stars the  server 1 star ...you know what if your crabby go home",UNK
4973,I love the interior... very relaxed vibe. Everyone makes you feel right at home. My brother and I look forward to our next Moonshine sampling adventure!,UNK
4974,"Never get shit face when asking a girl out, not a good idea.hahah\nNice club only with reserve table! \nGet a table I promise you the girls will come! \nI was surprise I met a few people that live near my area.",UNK
4975,"Very yummy ice cream. 3 main types - Asian, regular ice cream, and vegan. Had the regular chocolate/peanut butter, and the regular banana chocolate chip.",UNK
4976,Doc was great! Very friendly and super informative. I have been to a few doctors in town and he was by far the best.,UNK
4977,"Typical chinese food, nothing to overwelm. We ate just before rush dinner hour on Sunday before labour day. Some vegetables did not seem that fresh. The restrooms could definitely use some cleanup and refresh!",UNK
4978,"If you're not getting pastries, this place seems to just be ordinary. I was expecting a lot more, especially since Bouchon has the Thomas Keller name behind it. Brunch was a bit of a disappointment but hey maybe dinner is better?",UNK
4979,This bank is horrible I am so glad I am no longer a customer. This bank is like the Walmart of banks 30 people in line 2 tellers and 10 other employees walking around looking at the wall paper. If you are in a hurry avoid this location.,UNK
4980,"Strangest hours but great donuts!!! Hours were 10pm to 11am. Tried several donuts :) and found them all to be excellent, especially the lemon filled and Bavarian cream. Yummy !!!  A must if craving donuts late night in Las Vegas.",UNK
4981,Dont waste your time or money. Staff was great. Provider matt was a waste of time.  I obviously had sinus infection on new years day. After $50 copy I was told to take m ucinex. Refused to give prescription.  Said he had been to seminars about this...not even nice about it.,UNK
4982,Grab a bagel and head to a nearby park. Eat delicious bagel. Contemplate going back for another. \n\nHad the everything with salmon and cream cheese. Delicious!,UNK
4983,Ventured here sometime last month for the first time. The best part about this club is their interior. It was fun looking at all the memorabilia from the 80's and 90's since I'm a pop culture addict. Song choices were ok. Upstairs area can use better lighting.,UNK
4984,"Took my new GOLF TDI in and Stewart and Kris were professional, courteous and did an excellent job.  I would recommend anyone to bring their car here.  Great local business and I like to keep the money I pay out for services local.  Hat's off to you guys!",UNK
4985,Fucking worst restaurant I ever ate. Grand lux is the best tasting 24/7 cafe in Vegas and is only marginally more expensive than this shit hole. Service was decent but I hate places that jack up prices and are no better than a coco's restaurant.,UNK
4986,"I spent way too much money during my visit to Las Vegas over the weekend, but I can honestly say that this was the best $20 I spent.  Props to the ever-wonderful Guy C. for introducing me to this!",UNK
4987,"Average food that is way overpriced. For the price the portions were small the taste average and after sitting in the waiting room of a nearby hospital for days we were looking forward to some taste and comfort food. Not!!! old and dirty room, and not good home flavor.",UNK
4988,Pizza and wings are great. Service is good. Nice selection of beer and wine. Deep dish pizzas take a while but they are supposed to.,UNK
4989,I have lived in the area for 7 years and the service is the same. Short of not opening the doors. Rude and unprofessional staff. Customer service training for management staff is required.,UNK
4990,Thanks for the $7 bowl of chicken soup without a shred of chicken in it. Do you always do that to takeout orders since there is no way to complain in person or get what we actually paid for.,UNK
4991,Went there for the first time last night to meetup with some friends. Great atmosphere and friendly staff. I ordered the Chile Rellenos which was fantastic and different than I had ever had. I'll be back for more!,UNK
4992,"Looked a little busy but they got me in fast for a FREE tire air check! Our auto-mechanic was Alex and he was very knowledgable, helpful, and most importantly friendly. Great service! Quick and easy. He got a nice tip. :)",UNK
4993,"Fantastic brunch/breakfast. Any attempt to describe the sheer awesomeness of the Fried Chicken Benedict (\""Chicken Benny\"") would fail to do it justice, because the proper words don't exist. It was enough for two meals and just as good the next day.",UNK
4994,Spur of the moment choice - thanks Yelpers !  OMG the zucchini fries - you must try them.  Burger was awesome as well.  Cool place!  Meal was worth the price !,UNK
4995,"Great service, delicious noodles, and a fun atmosphere. The servers were very attentive and personable, and watching the cooks make the noodles was fun.",UNK
4996,"Only thing I have to say is I come from South Florida.  Both the Key West Fat Tuesdays and the Fort Lauderdale Fat Tuesdays have the amazingness that is the Fat Tuesdays Koozie Cup.  This place did not.  Thus, no business for them.  #fail #FatTuesdaysEpicFail",UNK
4997,I'm super picky when it comes to my acrylics but Steve did a PERFECT fill! Finally! Amazing!,UNK
4998,"The sushi here is good. Go during happy hour, because the prices are great! The service was really fantastic. The staff were friendly, helpful, and polite. My first experience here was a really good one. I'll be back whenever I'm back in town.",UNK
4999,Food excellent and staff very friendly and happy to explain and advise.. Amazing meal..  only thing is this kind of food.. it's great but I am always hungry again in a half an hour.. portions are small.. order a lot .,UNK
5000,"cool spot.  food is solid-not El Pulgarcito on Central or Copan over on Sharon Amity, but decent prices and great marguaritas.",UNK
5001,The service was horrible. The girlfriend and I decided to try this place since we were craving sushi and it was walking distance from our hotel. The food was mediocre. We will probably not try this place again.,UNK
5002,"The BEST italian food in Pgh hands down. As if that is not enough to get you to return, their customer service is superior! I love a good BYOB & this is by far my fav!!! Great experience on every level!",UNK
5003,"Simply put, I did not like this place. I came here for lunch on a weekday and while the service was good, do yourself a favor and try lunch elsewhere. The water tasted gross and the chicken was not tasty at all! I do not recommend this restaurant.",UNK
5004,Pretty good but felt like crawfish was lacking something. Maybe lack sweetness in the meat or not alot of meat. I dont know what though... good if youve never tried it.,UNK
5005,"This place is amazing! Very crafted cocktail that taste wonderful. They have a \""smash\"" of whatever type of liquor you like with whatever fruit you like muddled into it with some triple sec for sweetness... I chose strawberries and lemon with vodka and it was so fresh and delicious!",UNK
5006,This place specializes in down home cooking.  They are famous for their fried chicken and I definitely recommend trying it.  They also have a variety of other foods to choose from if you're more health conscious that myself.  Definitely one to try for your next long lunch hour.,UNK
5007,Excellent BBQ and great customer service. The manager (Stacy) did an amazing job helping us pick things out and let us try some samples for our party! Best BBQ I've had from a store!!,UNK
5008,"wasnt sure what to expect from this place being that it was in the Plaza hotel, but food was good, i had a poke bowl and the wife tried the seared ahi plate and both were very good. Still when it comes to poke, their sister location Poke Express up on Craig rd, is the place to go",UNK
5009,Bad customer service! My lady kept complaining and moving my fingers roughly.  I paid for a design and my 4yr old could of done a better job. Some nails were super thick others thin. Will not go back ever!,UNK
5010,Very good pizza. The tomatoes on the margarita were delicious! We also really liked the salad dressing on the salad we ordered. Will definitely return!,UNK
5011,Had the Pho dac biet here for lunch. It was ok. Was expecting a bit more since it had a 4 star average on Yelp. Not worth $8.75 a bowl.,UNK
5012,"Just stayed here, i loved the atmosphere, the beautiful rooms, yummy food, convenience, ill go back, the only thing is that its not that modern or renuvated but still cool!",UNK
5013,"Welcome back, Chef Bianco to Town & Country.\n\nPizza stays incredible.  \n\nYes, I almost ate my entire Wise Guy for lunch yesterday. Thanks for the neighborhood location.",UNK
5014,"Always a fun time! No real happy hour specials, but they do have a small free buffet. The food is pretty good. Weekend Nights usually have a live band. A decent selection of beer.",UNK
5015,All of us were sick a few hours after eating here. Proceed with caution. Service was slow and unfriendly. Best part of our meal was the bread. Very disappointing.,UNK
5016,"Really good food at a great price! The salad dressing is something to be admired, the sushi is always fresh and affordable. Try the curry chicken!",UNK
5017,"I like Sandra, she's really knowledgable. She's really friendly and goes out of her way to assist you. I normally don't drive this far but would rather go here than the post office.",UNK
5018,Found hair in my food. The manager blamed it on corn husk and offered free dessert. It clearly was human hair plus we had already bought dessert. Did not address the problem. VERY disappointed!,UNK
5019,Best Mexican restaurant I've ever been too. They have the best chicken enchiladas. Everything there tastes so fresh and you get a big portion. It has such a nice atmosphere and decor too. Their chips and salsa are also awesome :),UNK
5020,Based on the fact that I just walked around and ate at the buffet I can't say I am all that impressed. I feel bad for the Aria it must be hard to open a hotel/casino in the middle of the worst economy. It looks really good from the outside.,UNK
5021,"Six Penn has a great little rooftop lounge where you can eat, have drinks or just hangout.\n\nAwesome view of beautiful downtown Pittsburgh!",UNK
5022,Used to be a regular at this bar.  They fired Dawn the bartender who was the best worker this bar had.  Will return when she is rehired.,UNK
5023,"Wasnt impressed this time cheese burger overcooked and dry, fries cold. Said its a new cook and sorry paid full price for the dry half I ate didn't touch the fries.",UNK
5024,"Aaaaaaaaye Grimaldi! You like real pizza? Youll love this lil' traditional joint also in Old Town Scottsdale.  Sauce? Bomb. Crust? Bomb! If you don't like it you're probably from Sun Valley, NV or Apache Junction, AZ.",UNK
5025,Not very authentic Mexican food but very good. Baja sauce is unique and tasty!  They were very accommodating to my gluten free food needs,UNK
5026,Great!  Our favorite Chinese restaurant in Phoenix.  Staff is extremely courteous.  Try the jade chow mien and salt and pepper pork.,UNK
5027,First off the food is ok. The atmosphere is ok. The show you get while your food is being cooked is what you would expect from a place like this cheesy. But if your a local with an lvh players card and a Nevada Id you get 25% off your entire bill. So try it if your in the mood.,UNK
5028,"Usually good, however they now want to charge you double for a quesaritto?  $12.00 to melt the cheese on a burrito what a rip off and they don't tell you upon ordering only that there is an extra charge!  Chicken salty, going down fast I enjoy cafe rio much better!!",UNK
5029,"The staff are efficient and friendly. They could use an upgrade to their chairs and tables, not the most comfortable setting. Nice place to meet someone for a quick chat. In the winter - the place can be a little too cold to sit and enjoy a leisurely lunch. I don't drink coffee,but the sandwiches and soup are a-1.",UNK
5030,Been here about four times now.  I am less impressed every time I go. It's not bad but it really is just mediocre Mexican mixed with mediocre Chinese.  Nothing is really that great for either cuisine. Will I eat there if my friends want to go?  Yea but I won't go out of my way to go.,UNK
5031,"Have to agree with the other reviews. . . it's good, and I've been there several times, but not something I rave about to my friends or go out of my way for. I usually get the spicy beef or chicken noodle. Big portions, nice flavor and decent pricing.",UNK
5032,I'm a total fan of this place.   The people who work there (and at Atlas right next door) are awesome.  I love stealing away and trying some great wine with some A-mazing cheese (from Atlas) and I always meet some great people who are also enjoying this little treasure of a place.  Awesome - great job.,UNK
5033,"Best iced tea in town and unlike Starbucks, they don't burn their coffee. might be five-stars if you didn't get an attitude from the staff 2/3 of the time. They would be wise to invest in some pleasant and fun employees.",UNK
5034,They have miniature golf here it's really fun and informative. The staff was really nice here. It wasn't too expensive either. Although I didn't have a chance to taste the food because the caf\u00e9 was closed. I will be returning!,UNK
5035,Upgrade your stuff this place gave me cold chicken from the beginning I felt as if the atmosphere was off and after receiving the gruel in which I did I knew I should have followed my gut feeling. Please Roberto hear my words and refine this location.,UNK
5036,I've been to many nail shops in this town and I always find myself comparing their work to Cute Nails. Wonderful shop!,UNK
5037,"Three of our five meals, the beef wasn't cook completely. We asked the manger to come over and look. He said the red came from the juices the cooked meat sits in. The food didn't taste right. We will not return. Sorry that no one cares here anymore",UNK
5038,"Oh man! What a disappoint. The lunch buffet really needs a visit from Chris Angel because it's in need of a magic show, make this food disappear!",UNK
5039,Club looks great but takes a while to get in. Door guys dont have much customer service but they were busy. The girls had a great time,UNK
5040,I love going to the Chiropractor. I love the massage. I love how I feel better after the adjustment. Dr. Gunderman is great.,UNK
5041,Outstanding. My first time and gotta say I can't wait to come back and try other things. Notables the water comes with slice cucumber. Pasta homemade. Service is best in city. Cool vibe menu and music. Love this Place try it.,UNK
5042,Best pizza in town!!!!! Worth the 20min drive!!!!! Need to build more of them in town!!!!!,UNK
5043,"Erika was super professional, this was my first spray tan and I felt comfortable with her the entire time. The tan looked fantastic and incredibly natural. Absolutely recommend.",UNK
5044,I have to say that this place has the BEST PHO's which is a Vietnamese soup. If you haven't tried this place put it on your list to come try it out you won't regret it!,UNK
5045,"I live right down the street and this has become our favorite happy hour spot. Great patio, really great atmosphere. Most important, great wine (white on draft!) and the appetizers are delicious. I definitely recommend the bruschetta! Very friendly staff, great service.",UNK
5046,"The food is decent but the atmosphere is good. Lots of TVs and plenty of selection if you go there for sports. The service is usually quite good. If you are going there for an outstanding food experience, you might want to think twice.",UNK
5047,"Great place to pick up some last minute gifts for friends and family back home.  Friendly local staff.  Me and my friends showed up 5-10 minutes after closing and they stayed open for us.   Bagel chips are good but something you have to try is the \""sweet dried pork\"".",UNK
5048,Fish fry was excellent. Place has really cleaned up from when we had our wedding reception 10 years ago here.  Thanks for the dessert ;),UNK
5049,I have been back several times and still love it!  This is one of the only two places in the valley I will go to for a Philly cheese-steak.,UNK
5050,"Miso marinated cod.  If three words could ever tell a complete story, you just read them.  So rich, buttery and sweet, this 12 dollar plate is an amazing value.  Talk is cheap... Imadake is inexpensive.   Eat here, drink here.   Be happy.",UNK
5051,"This place replaced Arena Sports Grill. Not as good. Not terrible, but, I may try one more time before I would write then off. Some places come on strong to impress, other take a while to get their legs. I will wait a couple month and give them one more try.\n\nUp ur game people!",UNK
5052,"Their meats are fantastic! Not a big fan of the stuff they put on the sandwiches, it's called bug juice or something like that but you can skip it if you don't want it. The service is friendly too. I would go back more and more for sure.",UNK
5053,"Came for lunch. Ordered fried chicken and pork chops. Mac and cheese, apple sauce, and rice with gravy. Sweet tea and koolaid. We may as we'll have licked our plates. Everything was absolutely delicious. And everyone working was so friendly and welcoming. Thank you!!!",UNK
5054,Awesome! This little hole in the wall Mexican place is the best.  Love the blackened shrimp tacos and my husband always gets the chicken burrito.  So good!,UNK
5055,This place was ok.  We ordered sushi and the three lunch combo.  Spicy tuna roll was not as I expected but overall worth three stars.,UNK
5056,I ordered the steak wrap bowl from the hidden menu...it's so hidden that I'm still looking for it. I get more meat when I get samples at the deli. It's my third bad experience at this place. I should have learned by now.,UNK
5057,"I almost cried when I dropped my 7 day old iPhone 4S in water then I tried all the at home remedies with no success. Thanks to AZ iPhone repair it has been working perfect, even after the complete submersion. Don't wait they can fix it!!",UNK
5058,They are always out of powder. Who ever does the ordering should order more or be fired. Can't be that hard of a job! If you sell 20 a week you should order 40 come on high school grads.,UNK
5059,My family and I stayed at the Aria last night. The rooms was amazing.. The king size bed was to die for. And yes the 3 pools are lovely. We had a wonderful time and would stay again when in Vegas. Thank you Aria,UNK
5060,My sons and i love the place. something about the flavor of the ribs and chicken. been going there for years. look out for groupons & yelp special deals.,UNK
5061,"Disappointing, very inconsistent, appears there is no or very pour management, no systems...I was hoping this place would be a place to go. Oh yeah...there is casino gaming, poker tables...anything to make money...won't be eager to spend money here again.",UNK
5062,"Great location, awesome outdoor bar, but the clientele and I hate to say it, bar-staff, are pretty trashy. It's weird..",UNK
5063,Horrible place. We went there for vacation to Las Vegas. Took 30 min to get a drink. Last place in MGM i would recommend going to. Rude.,UNK
5064,Consistently delicious. Monday nights is a perfect date night $14.99 seafood buffet dinner and $5 movies! \n\nDesert is good and for the price you can't beat the cleanliness and quality!,UNK
5065,"Huge disappointment! Unfortunately this buffet did not satisfy. The seafood was far from fresh and other cuisines were very poor quality foods. At $30 per person, you're better off to save a few bucks and find a Golden Corral. So sad.",UNK
5066,"If you have patience, this place isn't too bad. Ramen is good. Be sure to order the honey toast for dessert. However, it took another 20 min to come out.",UNK
5067,Love Total Wine. Best booze selection I've ever seen. \n\nThe wine options are a bit confusing because I don't know wine very well. \n\nThe beer selections are phenomenal. \n\nI always spend more than I expect or want to but I always leave happy!,UNK
5068,Horrible. Don't buy the monthly pass. It's harder to cancel than a gym membership. Sometimes I use the free vacuums but I don't ever pay for a car wash.,UNK
5069,Joes is my favorite BBQ in the valley. I have catered my sons bday party from JRB the last 2 years and all my guests have raved about how good the food is. Feel lucky to have a such a great place close by to home!,UNK
5070,We decided to eat here last week after driving by. We thought we were going to get some delicious authentic Mexican food....oh were we wrong ! The food is terrible. However our server was really nice which is the only reason I am not giving this place 1 star.,UNK
5071,"Absolutely inedibly disgusting.  I expect mediocre food- but this was downright awful, putrid garbage.  Don't waste your money!  Go to Ventano's- similar pricing with actual food.  Never again.",UNK
5072,"This place is packed!!! Definitely worth the wait....best tacos I have ever had. Must haves are: adobada, cabeza and grilled onions & jalapenos. Will come back for another visit.",UNK
5073,"Thought I'd give this place another chance and wish I wouldn't have.  Once again bad service and the food is terrible.  It was dinner time only 4 tables with customers yet there were dirty tables, out of napkins and just dirty.  WILL NOT go back.",UNK
5074,I had a great dinner experience here. Food was excellent and our server Matt was awesome! He was super friendly and helpful with the menu. Best customer service ever!,UNK
5075,"Nothing Bundt Cakes are so moist and tender, they melt in your mouth! Try all the different flavors by ordering a dozen of the little cupcake sized ones. Those can only be ordered by the dozen. The medium and large sized cakes are also very delicious.",UNK
5076,My allergist recommended Dr. Weiner because I've had such severe issues with my sinuses.  He is very knowledgeable and has me on a regimen that is actually making a difference.  It's also easy to get an appointment with him and you can book with ZocDoc.  Win!,UNK
5077,I would have to say this is one of the best bars by the Air Force Base.  Good food drinks are well priced and it's a mellow environment.  I would really recommend this place.,UNK
5078,"This place is a poor representation of the Giant Eagle brand.  Small selection, small selection of frozen seafood, very odd layout, very small ethnic goods area.  Good place to people watch, though.",UNK
5079,"Delicious cupcakes made by the friendly Caketini girls! If you haven't tried the Creamy Coconut, Keylime, or Pumpkin cupcake then you're missing out!",UNK
5080,Dined here the other day for lunch.  I did all you can eat which probably wasn't worth it as it was happy hour and everything is so cheap.  The atmosphere isn't great and the quality is just ok but the service and the price are great.,UNK
5081,"This place tries to rip off customers. I came in with an item that weighed less than 4 pounds, plus I needed a box. They tried to charge me $63 for UPS Ground. I am not stupid! I took my item to a different UPS Store and was only charged $26 for the shipping and the box.",UNK
5082,"I visited this location for boba. Compared to other asian boba places, this location is very clean, professional, and organized. I really like the interior of the establishment and the professional business feel. Other boba shops even nearby are very poorly designed and not very professional.",UNK
5083,It's been around for 30 years-There is a reason. Relaxed and good food that is not expensive. True food from New Mexico.,UNK
5084,My boyfriend and I have been looking for some amazing mexican food and we found it. Had to wait a little bit to get the food but it was well worth the wait! The nachos were out of this world and the burrito and quesadillas were amazing. Definitely will be back!!!,UNK
5085,"The Canopy, like many others have stated, is a decent place to see a live band in Urbana. It looks kind of old and grungy, but it's an okay place. Piano Man, a favorite event there, is one good reason to go. They also have other events throughout the year.",UNK
5086,"Came here to study - because of the music, this place was louder than Saturday night bar even though it was early afternoon on a weekday. It is also full of out-of-work hipsters. Headed for a more coffee-shop like coffee shop.",UNK
5087,Service is terrible at this location. My kids and I have been here an hour and we're still waiting on our food. It was 25 minutes before we got our drinks and an additional 10 minutes for our straws. It would be different if they were busy but there not. This is the last time I come to this location.,UNK
5088,"Not good. Ordered a spicy tuna roll; mostly rice, and cucumber. Quality was not good, sashimi was plain and presentation was terrible. I pulled up at noon, not one car in the lot, I was the only customer....",UNK
5089,"I like playing here, I normally do well. Folks there are always nice, clubhouse a little older but the course is in good shape. Plenty of challenges on the course make for interesting day if you're not careful.",UNK
5090,"We stopped by this afternoon to order a new phone, switch carriers,  etc   We were served by Fabian.  He explained everything well and didn't try to sell us extras we didn't want -- very good service.",UNK
5091,Best Soulfood I had since i've lived in Vegas and thats saying alot being that Vegas is deprived in the food catogory,UNK
5092,Getting ahold of him a little tough. His voice mail was full. Finally got ahold of him. So far so good. Will keep you posted.,UNK
5093,"It should not be called \""rainbow pho express\"", instead it should be called \""Pho Slow\"".\n\nThe service was horrible!  Very slow service and they bring food in your table that you did not order, and the food that we ordered took so long to arrive.",UNK
5094,"Great outside on the patio.  Pretty noisy inside if you want to have a conversation.  great value for the $30 special for restaurant week.  Great, attentive service without being intrusive.",UNK
5095,"This place has a bunch of already filled jobs they make you wait in line for 2-3 hours and give you up to 4 referrals for jobs that pay diddly or have all been filled. They do however let you use the computers,phones,fax and copier.",UNK
5096,Everything was burned and the samosas were a Joke I'm Indian and this was not good $13.00 for lunch buffet,UNK
5097,"Came here on my first trip to Vegas, this place has a great variety of food so plenty of choices and the prices are decent. If your in the Palazzo looking for a casual not ridiculously priced dinner this is the place...my spicy chicken flatbread was ok nothing special",UNK
5098,We were visiting from Ohio and a friend wanted to meet here for lunch. The food is Gross! Awful house salad and cheap ginger dressing. Sushi was bland the hibachi rice was tasteless. Will not be back-2 stars for good company,UNK
5099,Awsome place. Very good food. Everyone is nice and accomodating. Took a little while to sit as we had a bigger group but eric was very good server!!! Highly recommended!!,UNK
5100,AMAZING!!!!! No other crepes can beat these! The service is great. I just wish it was open longer,UNK
5101,"Love love love this place!! Great service, out of this world ice-cream & other treats.  The BEST thing on the menu...toffee banofi!!! Unbelievable & worth every calorie!",UNK
5102,"Overly Expensive. Not good, but edible food. They have really slow service even when they are not busy and really don't seem to care that they are slow.",UNK
5103,"Do Not Go to this store.  I purchased juice and a new atomizer. The atomizer lasted for one fill before the thing broke off spilling juice all over. Took it back and they would not replace it, instead tried to sell  me a glass one for $23. Poor customer service and just lost a new customer.",UNK
5104,"We walked out the door. \nThe hostess was not welcoming at all. Sat us down and then for about 15 minutes; nothing. No hello, no glass of water, no menus, nothing. Seriously? We only had an hour to eat so this was really unacceptable. We left and went next door",UNK
5105,"I will never go back to this establishment because all of the bouncers and wait staff are unfriendly, unprofessional and disrespectful.",UNK
5106,"Yeah, food looks to be ok.  But I didn't fly 2500 miles to eat loco moco and saimin.  Don't get me started on the oxtail soup at the Cal.",UNK
5107,"Whenever I go to Charlotte I want to stop here.  \nGood grocery choices and baked goods.  Very helpful staff.  Next time, I would like to try the cafe.",UNK
5108,"Super! Great addition to Las Vegas Entertainment, nightlife and music scene. The music sounds real great from any location inside. The bowling is great and food and bar service fantastic. Raising the bar in Las Vegas.",UNK
5109,"Came here for burger week since i am such a huge foodie. Presentation was pretty, fries were awesome and my hubby liked the salad dressing. The burger unfortunately, pulled pork, beef, gravy & cheese curds, was very bland needed seasoning. Def not a great start to burger week.",UNK
5110,"One of THEE best places to eat in Madison, for sure. It can be a bit loud inside, but who cares. The food and drinks are so delicious. The upstairs bar is very quaint and spacious. Support this bar, it is SO worth it!",UNK
5111,"Not good, prime rib was like steak and eggs at IHOP. Mac cheese tasted liked noodles w reduced milk! Someone needs to help this place out, the acoustics are that of a tunnel and you can't hear anything people two seats away are saying!",UNK
5112,They have great deals on Shampoos & Conditioners. I use Redken which is usually on sale either buy 1 get 1 free or buy 2 get 1 free I only wish they had good customer service.,UNK
5113,"Food and service were good.  Try the bulgogi, it's delicious!  I will definitely go back again next time I'm on the west side of town.",UNK
5114,"I had coupons and got a spicy Korean tofu and gluten free sweet and sour chicken, edamame, and a small fried rice all for $10.26. I just love how Pei Wei offers such great deals and I am always happy with the food and service tops!\nEat Here!",UNK
5115,"Just another average dim sum place, nothing too fancy or special. We came during a weekday so there was plenty of seats but I heard it gets insanely pack during the weekends. Service was quick but then again there wasn't too many patrons to serve. The dim sum was just average to me. I've had better.",UNK
5116,"Typical busy Friday night. Foodies won't appreciate a predictable classic meal from a chain but we sure did. Mmmmmm bread pudding.  That is all ;). Good stuff\n\nDean was great, and the wine list was too. See you next time.",UNK
5117,"Love Love Love this church........it's anything but traditional! The Pastor is Wonderful as well as the staff and the band!!!!! They have so many groups, activities and a amazing children's ministry!!!",UNK
5118,"Delicious! This restuarant is for the sandwich lovers and the salad lovers. I had the side salad and broccoli cheddar soup. The soup was surprisingly good due to the fact its expertise is sandwiches.\n\n Also, you MUST try the desserts!",UNK
5119,"Nice restaurant. Met both the husband and wife team. Very friendly. The food was good, and the service was great. I will eat there again.",UNK
5120,"Restaurant was half empty, with spaces at the bar, and the host says they're full. \n\nReally?  Too many better places in Madison.  Will not return.",UNK
5121,Cultured Pearl is a huge step up from Pearl. It is classy and cool. The staff is amazing and the food and drinks are the classics with a new twist. Love the live band.,UNK
5122,"I loved the sugar bowl! You can go in and order an old school root beer float, ice cream, or even a chocolate soda! Yum it's a must stop to cool off and check out the old 50's decor!",UNK
5123,"Great Pizza! The crust is just crispy enough and the pizza is not loaded with sauce. We ordered a 16 inch pepperoni pizza for 4 and it came out within 20 minutes. Server was nice and made sure our drinks were topped off. As the Cardinal season has begun, we will visit Gus's Pizza more often.",UNK
5124,"This is the closest you'll get to a real life Cheers bar where \""everybody knows your name\"".  The staff is great and super friendly.  Drink prices are reasonable.  If you are hungry get the grilled chicken wings.  My favorite.",UNK
5125,Sorry but if you have to pay extra $$$$ to get even semi decent service & a seat to sit down every once in awhile then I need to go to a place with class. Some fake people and overpriced everything here. I'm surprised I wasn't charged to use the toilet paper.,UNK
5126,"Great park, lots to do for the kids and places to have a party.  They do need to put a sun cover over the swings... they get too hot.",UNK
5127,I tried to buy a small snack and a soda there. I was told they don't accept debit or credit cards for purchases under $5. Guess I won't be a customer of yours. (and not in the future either),UNK
5128,"Wonderful Greek Food offered with Excellent Service in an authentic setting, unfortunately very overpriced.  Difficult to enjoy a proper meal for under $100 for two people.  We may be back, but only on special occasions.  We'd be regulars if prices were reasonable.",UNK
5129,This restaurant is terrible the taste of The foods are awful and they serve with lack of utensils and the worst is the drinks comes in a styro foam cup . I will never recommend this restaurant at all.,UNK
5130,This place made my wife have a orgasms in public. That's how good the sushi was. It's a must try to me & I'm not a sushi guy.,UNK
5131,It's no wonder they just went out of business. Food was boring and overpriced. I actually took my dog here once and they said I could buy a chicken patty for her. Very dissapointing.,UNK
5132,"I stop there every day for breakfast as it is open at 4AM and they dont mind I bring my bike in, which is cool. I have the breakfast burrito which is awesome.",UNK
5133,"Gamesworks is a large arcade and rock climbing place on the strip. \r\nPretty good sized, could spend a couple of hours being occupied.  You pay by a game card, not tokens.  A few fast food/grill type eateries.",UNK
5134,"During my last stay my room included:\n\n-an unpleasant odor\n-a drainage problem\n-a huge red stain on the carpeting\n\nI seriously had to wonder if I was in the Las Vegas Hilton, or Paris Hilton.",UNK
5135,"One of my fav local bars. Friendly staff, great food and cheap beer! The renovations are great. Great place to watch a game.",UNK
5136,The set up is ridiculous. You can only order food from the waitresses even if you're sitting at the bar. Service was terribly slow. The only good staff member was Lyndsie she definitely made up for the crappy service we received from the rest of the staff.,UNK
5137,The pastries were great!! Croque madame was much bigger than I thought it would be. Definitely a must-go. It's far from where I live but I'll be making special trips just to go here.,UNK
5138,Went on a Mon nite so the menu was limited and the place was dead. Good food but can't get on board with $20 drinks.,UNK
5139,I'm from CA and wish they had more of these theatres around. Great first experience! Bought a bunch of inexpensive food there and everything was pretty good! Definitely cheaper than regular theatres. Staff was pretty nice as well. This will be our main theater now in Vegas for the most part :).,UNK
5140,die Preise f\u00fcr Wurst und Fleisch f\u00fcr seine Supermarktqualit\u00e4t sind sehr \u00fcberzogen.,UNK
5141,"Should be number one on the list for any Edinburgh newcomers, you won't get a better bang for your buck (literally) anywhere else! Definitely plan to spend a good few hours, there's a lot to take in, the crown jewels and their history in particular is very interesting.",UNK
5142,"Not a fan of this place.\n\nNot only is it dingy, but the service is so so and the food is kinda gross.\n\nOnly good thing is that it's cheap, and that they have decent milkshakes....",UNK
5143,you wait 1/2 hour for no service. this is not the place to go on sundays! And the moronager is no better! Hey fatboy! People are waiting! Make yourself usefull. Do your job and service the customers or I go to triple B! Better Business Bureau! And CEO!,UNK
5144,Wish they had an option for no stars... Spent $19 and was served bad Denny's quality food... Nominated for worst buffet in Las Vegas.... Never again...,UNK
5145,Hands down one of the juiciest burgers I've ever had.  And who doesn't love a twist of pineapple on their beef patty?  This place is incredible.  Only thing not incredible is paying an extra $5 for fries.,UNK
5146,I don't get this place. The food os so mediocre and the rum drinks are so sweet. \nI guess it is just not my thing. Service was friendly and quick.,UNK
5147,From the street it looks like a nice place but the staff thinks they know exactly what you want and try to push it on you. I just wanted to find a different pair of frames from the bread and butter places. Look elsewhere first before you try them here.,UNK
5148,"The food was great, although my only complaint against this location is our server named Courtney was extremely rude and only showed any friendliness towards my friend and I because the manager was in the building. First time at a California Pizza Kitchen but the worst service I've had in my life from a waiter/waitress.",UNK
5149,"Wow the chicken parmesan is the best, its the best i ever tasted. for dessert i had the Newyork cheesecake, im a cheesecake lover so for sure they won my heart, Me and a bunch of my friends will be visiting again real soon, thanks Maggiano's",UNK
5150,Was just an overall great experience. The bar tender was very friendly and the food was great! Definitely worth stopping by and checking out!,UNK
5151,I went here with my dad and wife.  The food was okay; a bit pricy to get everyone full.  The only bad thing was the prawns; they were not deveined.,UNK
5152,"The cheesesteak meal is $11.24 after tax.  Like most airport food, it is overpriced , the taste is average, and the portions aren't great.  The soda in the \""meal\"" is a bottle rather than a refillable cup.",UNK
5153,"Stopped in for a bite and were disappointed by the food. Wings were on special at 25 cents each but they were dry and lacking flavor. Fries were terrible, even dipped in ranch. Service was fine.",UNK
5154,"The staff was very friendly was clean location easy to find , the food was very good beef chowmein combination fried rice thai tea :) good and affordable",UNK
5155,"Good pho with flavorful broth.  Crispy, delicious egg rolls.  Generous with bean sprouts, basil, mint, lime.  Fast, efficient service.  Would give 5 stars if restaurant had working A/C.",UNK
5156,"This place is a slice of Italy. The service is awesome and only second to the food. Small, elegant and better than mama's cooking. Affordable and a little hard to find but worth looking for. Ask for John.",UNK
5157,"When I got to this salon, I thought I stepped out of Madison and into California.  It was so beautiful and unique to anything I have seen in the midwest.  The owners said they studied in New York before coming back to Madison to open this salon.  My nails and toes are always done to perfection!",UNK
5158,Cool ambiance inside. The overpriced & known hamburgers fell apart in your hands. They are on small cheap buns. Greasy onion rings. Over-served 2 drunks at the bar...,UNK
5159,Some times life happens at you get more patrons than you can handle.  How you deal with it speaks volumes about your establishment.  Unfortuantely Floridino's just fails in dealing with a crowd.  If you have more than 4 people in your party look elsewhere.  \n\nThe food is however very good.,UNK
5160,Wednesday night is 1/2 priced appetizer night. This means half price chicken wings!!! These are the most delicious wings in town. Try the salt and pepper they are unreal!,UNK
5161,"Wonderful selection of food and deserts! The line is definitely long, so be prepared to wait. But once you are in, the selection and quality are definitely worth the price. You also get unlimited beaverages and one free alcoholic drink. You feel pampered and relaxed, although it's a buffet.",UNK
5162,"What's the deal? This Pizza is only ok...Angelos is better, but I still haven't found a favorite spot. Spak skimps on toppings, I like the divey decor and the workers I only wish the Pizza were as compelling.",UNK
5163,Ron is an honest car mechanic. I trust him completely. He is extremely competent. Never had a problem he couldn't fix. Works on both foreign and domestic cars.,UNK
5164,Love love love this place.... The all time question is what's better a Chicago dog with everything on it. Or the beef sandwich dipped with hot peppers. Order both lol and top it of with a cake milkshake if you can.  Oh gluttony I never knew you till I met you at portillos.,UNK
5165,"Meh.  Had the breakfast burrito, which was nothing special (eggs, bacon and cheese in a tortilla).  The pico de gallo on the side was the only thing that saved it from being totally bland.  Cute place, blah food.",UNK
5166,"Toi, moi et Cafe used to be my favourite breakfast place in Mile End but upon my most recent visit they changed the menu and took off my favorite dish and also stopped serving their delicious baked apples with breakfast. The cafe au lait's are always great though.",UNK
5167,"Dirty! Why I came back here today I have no idea.  What part of \""I WANT MY BAGEL TOASTED!\"" is not part of their language.  I just don't get why a simple request is never right at this place.",UNK
5168,"Its laughable the people they hire here. No customer service, people on phone while trying to assist you and no one seems to be knowledgeable of the speacial order items. Most lowes we go to are too knowledgeable, this one must have missed the memo.",UNK
5169,"Pretty good pastrami sandwich!  Stopped by for lunch, it was pretty busy so you might want to call in your order ahead of time!",UNK
5170,Just tried this place out. Absolutely amazing food and great service. They even gave me a free Thai tea when I was leaving because it was my first time there. I would come back in a heartbeat.,UNK
5171,"FYI, the prices listed on the menu linked to this profile are lower than what is on the menu at the restaurant. The burgers average about .50 and higher. The hickory loaded for example is really 9.79. Otherwise great food.",UNK
5172,"If I could zero stars I would have. It took 30 min to get our drinks, when we finally got our food it was like eating a leather belt and a belt would have been much better. Then to top it off our waitress disappeared never to return and took another 30-40 minutes to get our check. I wouldn't waste your time!",UNK
5173,Waste of time and money. My wheels are still dirty. Inside was barely wiped down and can tell no cleaner was used just a dry towel that left lint EVERYWHERE. I should've known a good job couldn't have been done in the 6 minutes I was there.,UNK
5174,My pups loved it (for boarding) ! they cam home exhausted and happy. Reasonably priced and the workers all seem enthusiatic abut their jobs!,UNK
5175,Used to be a 24 hour cafe.  Now it's limited hours.  Food is okay but it's on the strip and cheap.,UNK
5176,"We used a 'deal' from the internet and went for the wings but found out the pizza is awesome.  Went on a lazy Sunday and it was perfect.  The staff (ok, so it was one person) was terrific and we've gone back since.  The whole family loved it.",UNK
5177,Perfect hotel for Phoenix they are as  racist as Arizona is .\nGood job Westin keeping it real for AZ  .. \nYou should change your publicity  only white people allow ..,UNK
5178,"Pretty good with the usual \""local\"" food from the islands, but usually only during the day. Probably one of the better ones here in Las Vegas, during this time period. \n\nHowever, I went there a few times late evenings, and it seems like the quality suffers bit.",UNK
5179,"Would have loved to try out some juices in this shop, but wasn't able to get past the youngsters hanging out at the taste bar. \nMight want to consider making room for new customers!",UNK
5180,I was served dirty plates and the most awkward cup of green tea ever ( a plastic cup full of large leaves with a bit of hot water)...when I complained..of course no one spoke english. This place sucks..,UNK
5181,"So disappointed with the changes at Hilldale.  Why would you want to make a mall outside in Madison WI? I used to love being able to browse in small shops without worrying about the weather. Sadly, many of the small shops that I enjoyed have moved or gone out of business.  \nIt feels like a ghost town now.",UNK
5182,"Very friendly staff, great tasting \""American-Thai\"", and the signature Thai-Basil, is incredibly delicious. The management team even brought our table a slice of cake with a lit candle upon realizing we were celebrating a birthday, awesome!",UNK
5183,"I came here for the breakfast buffet and it was meh. There was a decent variety, but the quality was poor. It's cheap though, so I guess you get what you pay for.",UNK
5184,"I love the Sabana De Pollo, I've been ordering it since Pink Taco opened! Another favorite of friends' are the Chicken Enchiladas with Tomatillo (green) Sauce.",UNK
5185,New to the area.. Had to get a haircut and i hate getting new Barbers But JIMMY was great highly recommend this place!! Will go back again!!!,UNK
5186,Phenomenal service. Fresh salad and tasty soups made from scratch! I will definitely be back. They make it so easy to eat healthy.,UNK
5187,"im rating this on my history of going here when i grew up in phx, not on the dish i had tonight. the dish was good but it wasnt what i expected. my dad let me try his dish and i wish i ordered it. I cant remember the names though.",UNK
5188,Seriously people! I live in the Bay Area so I understand my benchmark is higher but this place was just ok. Super expensive. They can't cook Thai but they try. Good German wines tho.,UNK
5189,"3 words\n\nBacon Wrapped Jalape\u00f1os \n\nI discovered this place because the heath inspector told me it was the best barbecue in the city. So the guy that goes everywhere endorses your place, you listen",UNK
5190,"Loved this hotel! Stayed one night and it was cheap. Nice, modern, clean and friendly staff! Great restaurants around it also. Highly recommended! Table games were cheap, but I didn't win lol.",UNK
5191,Fun store with great ideas.  Museum is okay but the store seemed a little dirty.  Customer service was great and friendly.  Wanted to take a picture with their green screen for $1 but found out later you have to but a minimum of six pictures.,UNK
5192,If you're hungover: GO! \nIf you're sober: No.\n\nStraight up greasy spoon/ diner food. \nQuestionable quality. \nYou get the idea.,UNK
5193,"Remodeled a few years ago - nice job modernizing in bar area.\n\nBreakfast is classic dinner style food.  Pancakes are huge, country ham is salty (as it should be)....",UNK
5194,"The best espresso I have ever had, and I've had me a lot of espresso!\n\nThat Synesso really is something (and so are their baristas!).\n\nFor coffee, maybe try the Clover at 21st St.",UNK
5195,The Big Boy burger is one of the best burgers I've ever eaten. Big enough to split. And you have to try the Green Chile Pork Stew and lamb appetizer. Plan ahead with a reservation as they fill up on a regular basis.,UNK
5196,"This is the place for consuming mass quantities. None of it is really good, but none of it is bad. There's enough variety to make it interesting. There's a lot of space, but the tables get pretty close and it can be awkward moving around at crowded meal times.",UNK
5197,I had the carnitas omelet here the other day.  It really was more of a green chili omelet.  Nothing special; a decent place for a breakfast meal.,UNK
5198,"The best! We were very impressed with the customer service-seated quickly, and greeted by our server promptly.  We were even offered a free pancake for it being our first visit!  Definitely try the berry one.  Freakin fantastic. My new go to breakfast spot",UNK
5199,Fantastic pizza. Great to have them in town making authentic thin crust pizza. Tried four kinds all great.\nWithout a doubt the best pizza in town. Crust was cracker thin! Spectacular.,UNK
5200,I had been struggling with chronic back pain for over a year. This place gave me the diagnosis & treatment that I prayed for! The relief was almost instantaneous! Dr. Ryan & his staff are amazing!,UNK
5201,"If there was an option for no stars I would select it. This place is terrible. Lost a piece of my grandpa's suit the day before the wedding, ruined a dress of mine by putting clothes pins through a delicate material. Always have excuses... Terrible customer service.",UNK
5202,"I love their service, however they were just bought out & don't offer any new activations in Vegas. I tried to get my mom signed up yesterday & they couldn't do it. If anyone knows of unlimited internet service with no contract for 50$ let me know.",UNK
5203,"I was just about to place my order,  when I looked over the counter and saw how filthy it was.  The grill was black and food debris all over the counters. I immediately left and went to the Cappriotti's on Sunset and Annie Oakley. They are extremely clean. Thank God!",UNK
5204,"FYI... Although Yelp says its good for kids, it is not. There is a sign on the door at the hostess stand that says no children under the age of 6 are allowed.",UNK
5205,4 flights delayed today at the airport and this place is running out of chicken and turkey which is mostly all of there sandwiches    Unreal   This has happened numerous times ! Don't bother!,UNK
5206,"Wanted to like, close to home, didn't get a server for 10 minutes, just wasn't impressed with the food, maybe it was just a bad night.",UNK
5207,"Not as bad as 2 stars, but not great either.  I'd say it is passable.  Everything is just ok, not great, but not bad either.",UNK
5208,"Expensive food for the crappy service. Food was good but not great. The cheapest thing was a burger and chicken salad sandwich, which were $14. But the good thing was we got to sit outside in the sun on the patio with a view of the strip (second floor)",UNK
5209,"I was very impressed with the cleanliness and the huge airport, the decor is nice and overall a very pleasant experience.\n\nIf I could change one thing is the SHUTTLES.  First you catch a monorail to baggage then another shuttle  the rental cars. SUCKS in this hot weather!",UNK
5210,"Ugh, mediocre food, OVERWHELMED waitstaff. It's an airport. Not going to find much else than this if you want a sit-down.",UNK
5211,Ate there tonight. Don't love chinese but they have thai stuff. Can't say I loved the foodt. But its very clean. Food is very fresh. And you get the impression that they do their thing with more care than most places. If you like chinese you should be very happy.,UNK
5212,Had to drop my rating for the chocolate bars. I don't recommend buying because it tasted old. If your going to charge those prices I expect quality & freshness. Did not get that here. What a shame. Your better off going to Ethel Ms\n\nOverall assessment is 2 and a half stars.,UNK
5213,"Service sucks, food sucks, life sucks. If you come here, you will feel the same. Oh yeah, my friends chair is gonna fall apart. I will update with a photo if it does.",UNK
5214,Saw positive reviews for Sushi Avenue and decided to stop by and try Sushi Avenue.  The employees there are very nice and care about their customers.  The Food is the best!!  I had Octapus and fresh water eel sushi as well as their Teryaki Chicken plate.  I would deffinetly suggest going.,UNK
5215,This is the poor mans Paradise Bakery. Sandwiches are 95% bread and my Thai lobster curry soup was missing the lobster. It took all my energy not to ask for refund.,UNK
5216,"Tried to have breakfast here this morning. Couldnt  finish  our food after watching the manager walk into the area where the waitresses were plating the food and he sneezed several times all over the plates, counters, food, everything and never attempted to cover his mouth.  Hope the corporation does something to remedy this.  It was disgusting!",UNK
5217,"OK I ate here and the next day my Head was killing me. I'm not sure if it was the geese, the sodium or the combination of both but I will not be returning.",UNK
5218,"Decent enough staff and doctor, but I had to wait almost an hour for my daughter's morning appointment.  Not fun with a 5- and a 3-year-old.",UNK
5219,"This place is great. They were very friendly, made me awesome drinks & great food. I ate the ham and cheese panini and it was excellent. Can't go wrong here...",UNK
5220,"This place is fairly clean, but the service is very cold. We didn't feel welcomed at all. The quality of the food, including the baklava, was below average even for a quickie gyro place. We definitely will not be back.",UNK
5221,"This is a wonderful Thai restaurant.  We had a great lunch at a very reasonable price.  The salad was fresh and crisp with a well balanced dressing.  My ginger seafood combo was spectacular, with scallops done perfectly tender.  Julie's beef curry was very flavorful.  I plan on returning several times in the next week.",UNK
5222,This time I had their orange bread..... MMMMMMM like home made!! \n\nAnd again a latte! just like the way they know how to serve it!!,UNK
5223,"Used to love this place when it was small. Now that it's bigger, Prices up, servings reduced.  Daily specials gone. Taco Tuesday costs more per taco now.",UNK
5224,"\""I love the food here, but I would also really love to see a lunch menu with lunch pricing! My favorite is the cheese wrap. You can't go wrong here - everything is so good.\""",UNK
5225,"After being on hold for 10 minutes trying to place an order for pick up the employee just hung up the phone so I walk in and tell her I was the one she just hung up on and she said \""sorry we are busy\"" and rolled her eyes. I turn around and their is one customer in the restaurant. Won't be going back",UNK
5226,"Good place to see, but once seen then you are done.  No sense in going back.  Lines kinda of long, but moves fast.",UNK
5227,"Tr\u00e8s bonne cuisine italienne avec de bons produits, pour ceux qui en ont marre des pseudo resto italien qui vende des pizzas am\u00e9ricaine merdique. Bravo et merci !",UNK
5228,Overpriced burger and fries and slow service.  Can't expect much from the only food available at the hotel...,UNK
5229,The menu changed and the prices went way up. $50 for two for lunch! That was 2 beers and 2 Poor Boy's. A nice piece of catfish on the sandwich is now 'popcorn' catfish. The pieces kept falling off. Bummer.,UNK
5230,"Paris, France isn't what it used to be and neither is the \""Paris\"" hotel. Still, when I see the Arc de Triomphe replicate, my heart flutters as fondly as ducks on a pond. #poetry",UNK
5231,Excellent food.  Its a small mom and pop place.  So its  not a big fancy place like a pf chang .  Large menu and it changes every few months.  I have tried a few of their items on their menu and like everyone.  great place for Thai food.  I love it.,UNK
5232,"Great ride and stories for our one hour trail ride. We had ten people with nearly no experience, and everyone had fun.  Quick tip...pay cash for a discount.",UNK
5233,Wow. The good I awesome. BBQ chicken sandwich so good. I had no idea they served food. Really awesome my new favorite lunch spot.,UNK
5234,It's so ridiculous that a big company like Costco doesn't take credit cards unless it's American Express. Never again am I shopping at Costco. Fuck the bullshit,UNK
5235,"As their company name says, they are very careful movers. They moved a heavy piano with no difficulty, and no damage to walls or piano. I would highly recommend them.",UNK
5236,$15 Burger.  Taste was good but with Fries it's an additional $7.  $22 Burger too expensive for only 6oz meat.  Non memorable experience.  Like eating a $22 burger at a pancake house.,UNK
5237,"Favorite mom n pop coffee shop! The chai tea latte will change your life forever! This is a cool spot for hanging out with friends on a Saturday night while listening to cool local music, but also just as cool on a Tuesday afternoon for just chillin out with some coffee by yourself.",UNK
5238,Cold food and bad service .... Don't get the wagyu skewers served cold and no flavor... only the bread taste good here,UNK
5239,Great place to people watch (went on a Friday night). This place is connected to the bowling alley and tries to be a bar and a club combined into one. I don't think they did a very well job of it though.,UNK
5240,Thx guys.\nThe beer was tasty and the street tacos were awesome.  My lady says the salmon tacos were the best but I preferred the bison. Thx again and see you soon.,UNK
5241,I'm an older gentleman and like to grab a beer every once in a while. I went to firehouse this past week and was impressed but not going to be going there often because of the prices. THe ladies were also dressed gross and not lady-like.,UNK
5242,"Arepas, pan de queso, plantains, all kinds of sodas including many South American favorites. Service was friendly and quick. We ate at the bakery cause the main restaurant is closed Mondays but it's the same menu. Food was delicious!",UNK
5243,Below average service and food.  Don't waste your time at the Taco Mac in this location.  The Huntersville location is much better.,UNK
5244,"This is a hidden gem. Tucked away in a plaza, this place has very authentic food. The best part is-- they serve chinese and italian food! The pastas are delicious. They also have a sushi bar!\n\nNear midtown Phoenix, this place is great before a show or sports event.",UNK
5245,"3.5/5 it's aiite.\n\nplace already has a ton of reviews, but it's alright. i mean better than subway, but not the experience it sounded to be. or maybe i'm an SF food snob (likely).",UNK
5246,"Well. I am not sure what happened. We called to make reservations for 12 people on Saturday night. We showed up and the place was CLOSED?!?!?!? No lights on, no signs... nothing. The neighboring businesses did not seem to know why they were closed. Not cool.",UNK
5247,They are a bit pricey but i really like the location and interior. They have good food and very friendly staff. I don't frequent too often but it's worth going to.,UNK
5248,"So it smells a little funky when you walk in, kind of like when you cross the border(if ya know what I mean Vern). Don't think this store is that Smart and don't think it will be the final store I ever visit. But there are some things here definitely has some things!",UNK
5249,Food and service were good.  Prices are reasonable.  The decor/ambience doesn't help them at all.  Felt like I was sitting in a hotel lobby from the 80's.  Recommend that you sit outside and benefit from the hotel grounds.,UNK
5250,"After having read so many positive comments and reviews, I was really disappointed after my experience here. The food was underwhelming and the staff was not very accommodating. Sadly, I don't believe that I'll be returning anytime soon",UNK
5251,Nikki is an absolutely amazing colorist! I never have to tell her what to do...she does whatever she wants to my hair and it always turns out great. I have yet to have my hair colored when I didn't get at least 5 compliments from complete strangers.,UNK
5252,Awful!! $80 just to have a small bag checked in!! I will never fly with Spirit again. Ever!!!,UNK
5253,"I have been to this bar several times but have not been there recently.Today I ate a Meatball sandwich, and you can definitely tell that the food is prepared fresh and not from canned goods. This sandwich is highly recommended by me. The atmosphere and the service are also excellent!",UNK
5254,"It's a typical Target store. I like this location because it's close to Uptown and surrounded by other great stores. Not my favorite place to by food since it tends to be overpriced most of the time. Clothing and other necessities are reasonably priced, IMO though.",UNK
5255,"tried to get room on wed nite and they jerked us around by $20 on a \""better room\"" yet front desk says it basically the same. so we went to gold nugget instead.",UNK
5256,"Reviews were right on this one! I had some miso soup (amazing), a tiger roll and a rock n roll. Both rolls were awesome and I've never tasted anything like it! I will definitely visit this spot again when I come back!",UNK
5257,"So, so busy at all hours... It's hard to relax and enjoy the atmosphere with all the people crowding around.  Good food and decent coffee, though.",UNK
5258,"I'm a big fan of A Piece of Havana.  It's one of my favorite places.  The food is great and the staff is friendly and attentive.  The atmosphere is also very nice.  You can't go wrong with the Mojo Pork, and the fried plantains and black beans are also great.",UNK
5259,The food here is way below par.about the only edible things are the hot and sour soup and fried rice. Go another half mile south to Padma express,UNK
5260,"this place is a total hole in the wall, but I like it. the drinks are cheap and not many people hang here, that's what I like about it. I'm not much of a people person, but I do like to go out and I can sit at a booth or the bar and not be bothered by a crowd.",UNK
5261,"Not the best service. Burger was good but nothing I couldnt get at most restaurants. Not bad just nothing I would consider \""gourmet\"".",UNK
5262,Was at one of your Phoenix locations and witness the most disgusting thing!!! Food was brought for take out and fell over the counter the employee scrapped it back with the lid and put it back in the bowel and set it aside ready for the customer to pick up. Will never eat there again!!!,UNK
5263,"Nice location. I think this is where they hold the weekly Ultimate Douching Championships. I could be wrong though. 1 star because the people here douche way out of my league. Like, seriously, there's some hardcore douching going on here.",UNK
5264,I went here once and I don't think I would ever be back they sat us in the back and forgot about us we sat there for 35 minutes and never even got asked would we like a drink( They were not even busy) dont think i will be back,UNK
5265,"1st trip to the gold spike, they fixed it up nicely , from what I hear it was . Love that The same person that works the players club booth  had to hand pay all machines. Very old school",UNK
5266,Excellent service is the best thing I can say about this place.  The steaks were far from top quality and were not cooked as ordered.  Don't waste your time as The Keg is right down the street and far superior.,UNK
5267,"They came to my house for an estimate...... Conrad is nice enough , but never responded to my emails or sent me an estimate for my move. The customer service follow up was disappointing to say the least .....",UNK
5268,Glad to find decent food while I'm traveling for work.  Mac n cheese was really cheesy...if you like it super cheesy.  Mandarin salad was good...wish there was more lettuce than was given.,UNK
5269,"Terrible service. Very disappointed because I had heard great things. Made a reservation for 745 but still had to wait for 35 mins. Hostess was extremely rude, her name Christina. I was talking to her and she was purposely looking over me and not responding. Not a good start to dinner and not impressed with customer service.",UNK
5270,"Great Service. Great recommendations, food was excellent try the octopus sunomono. The Japanese lager was the best beer I had I long time. The ambiance is nice. Overall a great dinner experience.",UNK
5271,Pretty darn good overall. The garlic bread was AMAZING. The pasta was better than average. The decor was nice and comfortable. Looking forward to coming back soon.,UNK
5272,absolutely loved this place.  I had the brisket and my wife had the ribs.  bother were very good.  Desert came with the meal and was quite tasty.  Great place to eat.,UNK
5273,"Good food but horribly long wait that makes u wonder whether it's worth the pain. Kept us waiting for over an hour for sunday brunch, and then told us more than half of the specials were no longer available.",UNK
5274,"Shit...but even E. coli wouldn't eat here. Bad food, horrible service and lousy selection of mass-produced beer. Like I said --keep walkin' --nothin' to see here!!\n\n--TB",UNK
5275,I have worked with speedy glass for years. They have replaced my windshield twice over the last couple years - one of the joys of living in a rural area - and are always professional and respectful. Never had any problems with the work done and love that they use manufacturer glass. Thank you speedy!,UNK
5276,I really loved the portions. Huge slices make you feel like you're doing good by eating two slices which are more like four slices. The service was excellent. Cute atmosphere so my only complaint is the pizza is really pricey. They need to give out coupons or something.,UNK
5277,Been a few times. Amazing sushi. ;) Sushi Bar and restaurant. From Denver. Wish they had specials. Came for lunch. At least sake or drinks.,UNK
5278,This place is the worst.  It is super dirty not the best part of town.  It looks like they never wash any sheets the place smells!!  I notice some of the good reviews on this place is for the casino next door that is part of the Hotel so don't be fooled,UNK
5279,Food is good and service was good. Food is more expensive than IHOP.\nMe and my wife returned several weeks later and she finds hair in her food. We will NOT return.,UNK
5280,Love costco don't like the Henderson location. It is always busy and they never have enough lines open. I figured coming in the middle of the day and week I'd be golden I guess everyone else had the same idea.   I won't come back here any time soon.,UNK
5281,The food was good (had the Chick-A-Waff-A-Dopolis) but the place is smaller than I expected.  Be ready to throw some 'bows to get a table if its busy or you can just get your food to go.,UNK
5282,"Good wings, no gluten-free pizza (yet), and an unassuming salad bar.  The kids section is very helpful when trying to devour two dozen wings in under five minutes.",UNK
5283,"We thought it was a cool concept. However, the customer service needs work. A couple machines not in service, we lost tokens on one. Wish they served beer, it was BYOB though.",UNK
5284,"Brio has a great atmosphere.  The food is delicious and our server was fantastic.  It was very noisy, so it is extremely hard to hear anyone, even the server...that was the only minus..everthing else was wonderful.",UNK
5285,I tried this restaurant for the 1st time at lunch and was pleasantly surprised. It is very good and somewhat healthy. I liked the fact that you can choose exactly what you want for your stirfry and they will even bring you lettuce wraps which is a great alternative to tortillas or rice.,UNK
5286,"A pricey, date-oriented eatery with fantastic ambiance.  I only ate outside, and found the vibe to be great but the food a little short of what I would expect for what they're charging.  However, I can see it being an ideal place to bring a date and go through a bottle of wine or two.",UNK
5287,"I can't begin to explain the horrible treatment  received here.  Office staff and doctors not trained to treat women with a history of sexual abuse, and apparently without a bit of common sense.  I miss Dr. Brandon - she was the only good one here, but has unfortunately retired.",UNK
5288,"Great the last time I went. Hookah was nothing special, but the drinks were strong and the food was awesome. I over heard the servers saying they were closing and I just drove by and I don't see their sign up anymore. Also, the website redirects to NuSantucary in Town Square. Call before you go.",UNK
5289,Waiting in line no one here....3 employees standing around and no one says anything. Horrible service. Next time ill just order on amazon,UNK
5290,"This Apple store is the dog's bollocks!! We love coming here! It is an absolute must when visiting San Tall Mall! In fact it is the only store that I do attend when visiting. The staff are professional, courteous and hip at all times!",UNK
5291,"A good idea for lunch.  Food was decent, but $9.00 for a half of a sandwich and soup is too much for me.",UNK
5292,"Wait is always a bit long, but they just remodeled the dining area and it really looks a lot better. Polite staff that makes sure your satisfied.",UNK
5293,"The food is just fine; i had bibimbap. But the service is horrible! horrible! I was shock by how terrible their service was! and also they impose 18% of gratuity on the bill, which doesn't make sense at all. The environment just makes me not want to go again :(",UNK
5294,"Despite being nowhere near New Orleans, I Heart makes a solid Muffuletta. I'm usually the first person to hate on olives, but their olive salsa tapenade almost had me convinced otherwise.\n\nThey also make an UNBELIEVABLE iced latte. No sugar required.",UNK
5295,"From calling in to getting in the transaction was AWSOME !! Customer service was great , forgot the young kids name but helped me out completely , thanx",UNK
5296,"Very spacious and clean. They have two train that ride around the park. I think I like riding on it even more than my daughter! They also have a carousel, two playgrounds and two snack shops. I rate this the number 1 park in Phoenix!",UNK
5297,"Place is really nice and servers are really. Ordered some sushi and sashimi and fired rice. Rolls don't tastes good, sashimi and sushi are really good for this price. I would expect much tasty than other sushi restaurant.",UNK
5298,These guys rock!  My vintage mustang's heater box started leaking while I was in town for the Mustang 50th anniversary celebration.  They took me in on a moments notice and bypassed the heater core so I could make it home without dripping antifreeze all over my interior.  Did it in less than an hour and for a very fair price.,UNK
5299,"Artichoke Brie soup sounds weird but this was food to \""walk a mile for\"". Filet could be cut with a fork and service exceptional. Seriously expensive but IMHO worth it occasionally.",UNK
5300,"The manager recently reached out to me offering an apology and inviting my group back. It is appreciated, and I will update this review further if I ever get the chance to stop by.",UNK
5301,This was my first time going to the pop up market here in Charlotte and it was awesome. I was super impressed by the number of vendors and the amount of handmade goods there. \nThey had some food trucks and also local coffee shops set up making coffee which was awesome. \nI will look forward to this event every year!,UNK
5302,"Everything I've had from here has been great with one exception, the wings. The sauce was outstanding but the meat on the wings was meager and a little dry. \n\nTry the pizza (Sicilian or not, both styles are good) first, by the slice if you need to, then get a sandwich the next time.",UNK
5303,Fight broke out but thats to be expected. Played Giant Jenga and Corn Hole (or bags for you posers). Drinks were tasty and really enjoyed the inside. Love the patio as well.,UNK
5304,Been here a couple times and I enjoyed it. It is not the best burger I have ever had but it was good. Loved their onion rings. The meat is good quality and the service is always pretty quick.,UNK
5305,This was my first waxing EVER and Shannon was amazing! She gave me professional advice about how to protect my skin and keep it healthy. She has such a bubbly and warm personality with a gentle touch. You can tell that she genuinely cares and wants to give you the best service. Im hooked!,UNK
5306,This is great quality mexican food.  I've had two dishes from here.  The green chili enchiladas and the Torta...... Great food!,UNK
5307,Good music. Awesome decor and ambiance but had a small dance floor. Was really packed. Drinks were super expensive. Try and get on guest list to get free drinks for girls of you can. The line to get in wasn't bad either.,UNK
5308,"Chicken salad sandwich and strawberry -banana smoothie was delicious!  Quick, friendly service and a great, laid back atmosphere with knitting supplies and yarn in every color of the rainbow. \nOnly complaint: the soup was not hot enough. \nWorth coming for a coffee, lunch or knit!",UNK
5309,"I love this place, every time I come to Vegas this is a must locals joint to visit. It's tapas style food, and almost everything on the menu is excellent. The sangria here is also excellent and a must-have.",UNK
5310,"Found this place last Thursday and was so impressed I went yet again today. I tried the \""sweet thang roll\"" which was tasty as well as the coconut shrimp appetizer. I can already see myself coming here more often since its close to my one and work. Glad I found this place.",UNK
5311,Don't be put off by the name if you are not a wine fan -- there is plenty to drink.  Went there for lunch and was very impressed by the efficient and friendly staff as well as good food.,UNK
5312,Wow. Just love coming to this place when in town. Food & service is great. The morning cook is picture perfect great.\n   Only problem is I always eat to much. \n               You just can't help it.,UNK
5313,"Their food is amazing, your treated like family the minute you walk through the door, and I don't think anybody makes better hummus than Susan the food and customer service is great..",UNK
5314,"I had their gelato and thought it was good but nothing spectacular about it. I had better one before. Maybe I need to try out their pastry and sandwich the next time I am back. Overall, I will give this place another try.",UNK
5315,I give a three because the mermaid girl come out swims for like 10 min and most of the time she's at the top obviously getting oxygen . She does a little upside down dives and then it's over. I rwcconend sitting at the bar.,UNK
5316,"Very bad service. The guy wouldn't even look at me when he was \""helping\"" us. Will Never go there again. The only reason I was there because the Boca store was closed.",UNK
5317,"Very nice for their holiday menu!!! Excellent!!! Especially the snow crab legs, fresh and tasty. We took 5 dishes of them ! And they have Asian food their, the Chinese toasted pork buns are nice@@ I also strongly recommend their desserts, they are very cute and small so you can taste different flavors:)",UNK
5318,Bit slow. We went there when there was no one in line & no other orders being made and yet it still took a long time to get our 3 smoothies. I can only imagine what the wait time would be for when they actually do have a rush.,UNK
5319,100% Worst $40 I've ever spent. I can't believe any 5 star reviews aren't written by their staff.,UNK
5320,We stopped for a glass of wine and a beer. I enjoyed smoking a cigar on the patio. The staff was friendly.  But service was slow and prices were high.,UNK
5321,Will never go back.. The young lady at the counter was rude and unfriendly. She actually yelled at me for making a change in my order.. My co-workers would go here every now and again. We will not good back. DONT EAT HERE.,UNK
5322,"Wish I could give 4 1/2 stars! I usually don't like cuscus, but this place was awesome! The chicken and beef was tender. The appetizers were delicious. Really liked the belly dancing and pre-fixed menu.",UNK
5323,"Great PIE - I know it's a hamburger place - granted their burgers are awesome, but the pie is AMAZING! :) Grilled cheese is great... just like home. Good old fashion diner.",UNK
5324,"We went there becase the buffet has closed. \n\nThe menu is just like other normal restaurants, nothing special. Food is just fine, service is just ok. The creme brulee there is good.",UNK
5325,"$8 for a tiny sandwich with one egg, two greasy strips of bacon, and a stale muffin. They say it's pricy because they get it local? It has to have substance to be considered anything. So whack.",UNK
5326,Tried to give this best buy another chance but ran into a very consistent lack of customer service. Witnessed several others very frustrated with the lack of help!  The merchandise stocking is also very poor. Out of many items. I will continue to buy all electronics at Amazon.,UNK
5327,"FYI, they changed their policy and adults MUST also wear socks, no signs or anything to this affect, policy change without warning.  Fun place for kids though!",UNK
5328,The food is still great but the hostess rude. Poor customer service for the hostesses. Good servers. Food came out quick. Tastes great. Too bad the hostess put me off right from the start.,UNK
5329,"Sat at bar for 5 minutes while male bartender flirted with females... Worst \""kilt\"" in the valley!",UNK
5330,Awlful service. If you are planning on coming here better give yourself at least 2 hours of waiting time. Unbelievable. Even just to drop off equipment. There's about 2 to 3 people working at a time and about 15 people in line waiting usually. Other cox stores are not like this. Save your time and go to another store.,UNK
5331,We were very disappointed. Had the ribs and pulled pork sandwich with potato salad and Mac n cheese. None of the the food had any flavor except for the potato salad. That was the only thing we finished. Don't waste your time or money on this place.,UNK
5332,Ordered a choco malt shake..... tasted like someone put a pound of salt in it. No malt what so ever. Do not recommend.,UNK
5333,"Long drive thru line. Gingerbread Latte tasted so watery I thought they gave me tea. The Caramel Brulee Latte was so strong, tasted more like black coffee.",UNK
5334,"Of the vegeterian places I've tried in Montreal, this is one is definitely one of the ones on the top of my list - I'm especially in love with the hemp burger!\n\nSadly, that also means I have not wanted to order anything else yet :/",UNK
5335,I am definitely a fan. I like the layout of this one. I would like however if they could look at repairing the upholstery in a couple of the booths. clean old food off the walls of the booths. Love my sandwich and soup combination and yes I will return. Maybe this time sitting by the window. LOL,UNK
5336,"The food wasn't that great, and i loooovvveee filipino food. Service was great. They were fast... They have a lot of pork dishes, which I'm not a big fan of. Would I eat there again? Probably not or maybe - if someone else is paying. Lol",UNK
5337,"Everything is amazing except the wait. So if you're ever in downtown at an awkward time when no on else wants to eat this is the place, atleast for me.",UNK
5338,"The pizza tasted fine. But the cheese was extra rubbery. The people at the counter were exceptionally rude. No greeting, just a curt \""You got a order?!\"" and couldn't have cared less about us being customers.",UNK
5339,"I have been going to this location for about 4 years and recently the customer service and cleanliness have gone way down. I still love the food, but I will probably not be gong to this ocation anymore.",UNK
5340,The food is surprisingly good. The beer is ice cold. The place is immaculately clean. The servers Joy and Zira are excellent. There's two dozen flat screen TVs around the room. Prices are reasonable. This may have just become my new favorite bar.,UNK
5341,The soup was too salty and heavy and the panang chicken was kinda blend. I've had it better at a Chinese restaurant in CO.,UNK
5342,"Decent pizza and wings, not enough though to go back for a second time and deal with their award winning customer service. They nickel and dime you for any little request, I'm surprised he doesn't charge for the use of napkins.... Maybe that's next.",UNK
5343,"limited menu but everything is good. They cook from scratch, so don't be in a  hurry. Food  and service excellent , as other reviews that I read.  Love the chicken and catfish",UNK
5344,"I've been here quite a few times to see some really good performaces.  A lot of the shows don't really interest me, though.  But I was so, so excited when I was able to see the Good Body there a few years ago.  All of he women in the perfomance were AMAZING.",UNK
5345,"Horrible. Frozen veggies, prime rib was well done and dry. My best is spit out her taco after 1 bite. They do have a good price on craft beers. $2.25. I ordered a blonde beer and they were out. Not winning tonight.",UNK
5346,"you must visit this place. i live about three blocks and walk here on for dinner usually. but seriously, it is all worth it. i love the pizza. if you go there get the pizza! the eggplant is delicious! mozzarella are always my favorite.",UNK
5347,"Awesome, Awesome, Awesome! Great wines and always good company. The owners are usually the ones pouring their wines and most of their large family is involved in the business. I love to support local businesses and this is more than just a mom and pop shop!",UNK
5348,We were greeted and seated immediately. Our waitress was very knowledgable of the menu and all of the different beers. The food was very good as well! I will definitely be coming back next time I'm in Vegas!,UNK
5349,"They were out of shrimp, lobster, and most of the crab so I can't comment on the food but it would have been great to inform our party before seating us and taking our drink orders.",UNK
5350,Really nice selection of wines and tapas . It can be a little pricey so I usually take my dates to dinner first and then go here for the atmosphere and drinks. Most of the wait staff are knowledgeable and friendly. It's a nice place to take very nice date :),UNK
5351,"Lunch special is the shit!! 2 slices of petezer, and a salad for like 6 bucks, you can't go wrong.",UNK
5352,The absolute worst Mexican food I have ever had. Not only are the prices absurd but the food quality is low. I would rather eat from a vending machine.,UNK
5353,"I wanted to treat my out of town nieces to some great pedicures, as they don't have anything of the sort where they come from.  Everyone here was great and made it such an exceptional experience for them. Gals here are a blast!",UNK
5354,"The green chili sauce is super tasty. But the burrito only had sauce inside with maybe...five pieces of cubed beef.  The people who worked there were very nice, but definitely won't be going back.",UNK
5355,The absolute worst Arbys. They shorted me 2 deluxe sandwhiches and when i called after driving 10 minutes home. The manager pretended not speak english. Not worth driving back over there. Stay away!!!!!,UNK
5356,"Unremarkable, if not downright disagreeable, sushi and an odd atmosphere make this one of the dumpiest places I'll not return to.",UNK
5357,"I love Fox Concepts....this was no exception! Customer service was on point, delicious food...three words \""braised...short rib...gnocchi..\"" - that really says it all!",UNK
5358,Delicious! Great little place in squirrel hill. Food was great. Soup dumplings=delicious. It's really cool because you can see the chefs make the noodles and dumplings through a glass window-- very interesting process! Would definitely recommend the place.,UNK
5359,"If you are looking for really good rolls and sushi with a twist of creativity and exotic flavors, look no further than Tokyo in Old Montreal. Good service, decent prices and a variety of yummy rolls to enjoy!",UNK
5360,The hookah is the best in Vegas and the staff is very knowledgeable and friendly! I keep coming back here and I would recommend in to anyone who comes to Vegas or locals!,UNK
5361,Wife and I are big Mina fans.  Food and drink amazing.  Our server sadly gave us poor service.  The night prior we ate at American Fish amazing service.,UNK
5362,"Went there several times. Came away thoroughly satisfied every time. :) I usually don't like dim sum that much, mind you.",UNK
5363,"Chocolate everything? Ok, almost everything.  Food was great, fries amazing, chocolate displays were very creative.  My guests and I enjoyed the \""scientific serving decor\"" graph paper plates, flasks... It all made us \""nerds\"" smile.  This was definitely one of the more memorable restaurants we visited.",UNK
5364,"I totally agree with Paula L. we upgraded for $40 per night. (We were staying free on a company trip) so we got a Jr. Suite with large bedroom nice view...large living and dining room, bar and two baths. Very good deal...",UNK
5365,"Now my favorite manicurist is gone. Now when I go they don't even greet you, they just push you to a chair as fast as they can. I realize they were always that way, except for one But sadly he is not there anymore.",UNK
5366,Disappointed went back recently and clearly is under new management my tech no longer works there and this place is no longer customer friendly,UNK
5367,What started as a real Buffalo NY Wing experience has turned into mediocrity in less than a month. Little sauce. Few very tiny wings.  Not sure how to rate them. Depends who is working there I guess.,UNK
5368,Omgoodness 20 min wait in drive-thru and no apology! And then they got my sons drink wrong. I would have gone in if we hadn't had the baby w/ us.,UNK
5369,Rude Staff and bad billing issues. Will not go there and will not recommend this place to anyone. It's already annoying enough to have to go OBGYN every year that they should at least try to make it a pleasant experience.,UNK
5370,been coming here for years because I dream of some day completing a full beer tour.  completed some mini tours but not the big one yet.  this place is always giving me store credit for birthdays and other holidays which is just ducky in my book.  food ain't bad but seriously you're coming here for the beer tour.,UNK
5371,"Nice people inside, basically just a normal gas station/mart. Only thing thats lame is thats its on a corner so its more difficult to get out of with traffic! Loves it though!!",UNK
5372,"Excellent service! Very nice staff members, and the food is amazing! The pizza is unique, and the feel of the whole restaurant is very modern, yet comfortable! I love all of the wood incorporated at this spot, and I will come back soon to eat again!",UNK
5373,"Best coffee, mocha lattes EVER!!  Non-Profit coffee shop, excellent expresso machine, yummiest caffeine in the valley!!",UNK
5374,Wait staff was very attentive to our group.  The downfall of the visit there was all of the food that was ordered by our group was super salty.  To the point where you could taste each grain of salt in each bite.,UNK
5375,Lisa is great ! Very helpful with all breastfeeding concerns. She offers priceless support and breastpump rentals at a great price. Don't hesitate to call her if u are having issues..her support has kept me breastfeeding and my baby is now over a year old. Greatful for Lisa !,UNK
5376,Service was efficient and friendly. The omelette and hash browns  were amazing. We were disappointed with the pancakes. they were so dry and crumbly. Extra syrup didn't help much. Coffee was really good but no half and half milk only,UNK
5377,"Good strong coffee, very clean, nice staff. Location across from Sunset Park is great. \nAtmosphere is pleasant.\nI'll be back when I'm in the neighborhood.",UNK
5378,Need some iced love!  At least I can say Starbucks is consistent in making really bad coffee.  Add lots of sugar and milk and you'll never really notice.,UNK
5379,Why are they so slow? This is not working with my schedule....they need to get us in and out in the morning!,UNK
5380,"Despite it's location in a busy and often grubby part of a major city, I've always noticed the village store when I'm down Leith way, purely because the name of this little newsagent reminds me of Postman Pat.\n\nThat's all.",UNK
5381,Their new menu is ok but I prefer the old one.  I miss the old breads.  I will still come here when I can but not for breakfast anymore.  No more quiche muffins :(,UNK
5382,"Not sure why people actually eat here, although I do like the theme and decor.  However, the food is sub-standard.  Even eggs, which are difficult to cook badly, just aren't very good.  Greasy food in a neat atmosphere.",UNK
5383,"Simply the best burgers I've ever had!\nGet the app, order ahead, 7 minutes later you are in burger heaven!\n\nI have been to 5Gs around the country and have never been disappointed.",UNK
5384,"First casino I visited in PA. Convenient location, ample parking in the garage and security is great too. Layout of the casino is very good with a diverse choice of slots (I am pretty much a slot player - so I cannot say much abt table games here but they look well visited).",UNK
5385,"For Persian food it was pretty good.  Persian food is one of my favorites.  However the portion size of the kebabs was small.  Great rice, great mustomusir.  I will be back.",UNK
5386,"Very good quality & tasting North Indian food! Coming from NJ where good Indian Food is common every 3 miles, I have high standards. Unfortunately, the atmosphere needs a more polished, update. I would suggest playing some background music. The quietness, really hurt the atmosphere. Thankfully, the food and service measured up. We'd definitely return.",UNK
5387,So yummy! I get 1 gyro and order an extra pita. They put enough meat in 1 that you can split into 2!,UNK
5388,Beautiful!  I was so excited to find out this place was in the Palazzo. I could have eaten there every meal. The space looks beautiful and the food was almost as good as I remember it from NYC. The El Topo roll was my favorite but the happy hour taco's and deals were pretty good as well.,UNK
5389,"upon recieving our free entree coupon all surrounding tgif fridays restaurants closed, a nice jesture, now we cannot use the coupon terrible bussiness practice",UNK
5390,The food is great for fast food. The beef bowl is great and comes with veggies. It would stick to their beef bowl as their chicken wasn't spectacular.,UNK
5391,The brisket sandwich was unbelievably moist along with their homemade buns was unreal.  The chicken too is amazing.,UNK

5393,"Went because we had gotten coupons. We tried the cobb salad and mushroom cheeseburger. Both were really bad. The \""salad\"" was more of a cole slaw and the burgers at McDonald's are much better.",UNK
5394,"Can be helpful and are friendly! high priced and dread going there for animals well exams because they are very pushy about selling additional products and services, like a car salesman on commission!",UNK
5395,This location is part of a gas station and has not been updated in years. The food is alright but there are always flies flying around in the dinning room which is pretty unappetizing to say the least. You would think someone there would have noticed by now as I have seen the flies on several occasions.,UNK
5396,Pat Ruiloba rocks!  My tire had a nail in it on a Sunday and not a lot of places were open.  Pep Boys wanted 125 + for a basic tire.  Firestone.....not!  Quick and kind folks here.  Love!  I'll come back.,UNK

The beer selection is very good and the bar area is pleasant, and the juke box has some nice selections.",UNK
5399,Vegas Sports nutrition is a decent little shop in front of the LVAC shopping center.  They have competitive prices on most of their nutrition supplements but lack the business volume that a GNC or Vitamin Shoppe would have so you have to shop around and price match being most supplements are so over-priced to begin with,UNK
5400,The steak was good but way over priced. Could have gotten the same steak at Outback for $15.00. The 4-course meal they have for $40.00 seems well worth the price. I would not order off their regular menu again--based on prices.,UNK
5401,"Delicious fresh food, very authentically decorated. The Greek salad had a delicious fresh made dressing. Much better choice than a food chain. The waiter/owner was a very sweet man.",UNK

5403,"Sneaky liars, they charged my card a $50 \""enhancement fee\"" without warning. Just to update their new club. I already pay a ton to work out here, why do they need to charge  even more to enhance their club. That's what the monthly fee is for. I will be canceling my membership!",UNK

5405,This is a pretty crappy and old hotel. The room was dusty and had several missing items such as cups and laundry bags.  The bed sheet was dirty and had a huge bloodstain right in the middle of the bed. I had to ask housekeeping to come and replace the bed sheets.,UNK
5406,"Great staff. Great food. Great service.  Avoid East Tower facing the Boulevard.  Way too noisy with the Marquee pool right below.  We were on the 35th floor and we're disturbed each night with party goers up till 3:45 am.  Otherwise,outstanding hotel",UNK
5407,There are better in Vegas.Yes there are bargains!! However I will go out of my way to shop at other Walmart before i go there. Why ? There is a picket line there.,UNK
5408,The prices can't be beat. For 3 dollars you can enjoy almost any sub on the menu. The bread is baked fresh and so is the other baked goods.,UNK
5409,This place used to be okay but now it is awful. They must have had a change in management. Cashiers make constant mistakes and the drive-through took 40 minutes today. I will not go back.,UNK

5414,"I loved this show. It was entertaining, unique, and very interactive. I think it was cool that they had a weird personality spin on the show and they highlighted the overtake of technology. It is definitely a must see if you're in Vegas. But, get ready for an arm workout and a lotta' head bobbing.",UNK
5415,"Lox and bagel with breakfast was pretty good, but not traditional. Schmears, no!  lox and scrambled eggs; okay. Lots of food, but I was hoping for deli-style lox and bagle. Still, pretty good breakfast.",UNK
5416,My favorite Starbucks location.  Staff aways polite and friendly.  Clean with lots of space.  It's very convenient and easy to get in and out of parking lot.  Drive through gets me in and out in a hurry.,UNK
5417,Great authentic Italian food but not the greatest service. Mozzarella in the Caprese salad was fresh and delicious. Meatballs were great. Service was slow and not particularly attentive but maybe that is the authentic Italian way!,UNK
5418,Cheap but decent food.  Good place to eat after shopping(no I don't eat at every sample station multiple times).,UNK
5419,Waited 12 minutes after we were seated for a waiter to acknowledge us.  Never happened.    They lost long term customers tonight--after 4 years of regular visits.  This place is going downhill fast.,UNK
5420,Very expensive. Unfriendly staff. Why can't you just sell me what I need. I should have known better when no other customers where there. Avoid this place there are many other affordable places to take your vehicle to.,UNK
5421,This place is great!  I'm always 95% satisfied with the food here.   Service is very friendly and fast.  And you can't beat the prices!  Daily specials are very good!   I think everyone should give Mert's a try.,UNK

5428,"Friendly and efficient, what not to like? parking was good, i would give it a 5 star if exiting the parking lot was not confusing, hahaha",UNK
5429,Some of the worse service I have ever received! The wine tasted like it was cut with water and the food was very bland. We were sat near the kitchen and the smell coming out of the kitchen was that of seafood gone bad. I was embarrassed that I brought my wife there. Would not recommend.,UNK
5430,"Been there three times, twice dinner and once for coffee and dessert. This is the best restaurant within Mandalay Bay. The tatsing menu are terrific and best value on the strip. The staff goes out of their way to make you welcome. They even accomodate our twin infants and make them feel welcome.",UNK
5431,"The Jalapeno Margarita was good. I also had the spicy veggie tacos which were served cold, I wasn't expecting that but they were still good. I have to say that the salsa that comes with chips was so spicy I really couldn't taste anything else. Service was good too.",UNK

5434,Great peanut butter cookie and I am not even a peanut butter fan! Also loved the strawberry and butter pecan ice creams.,UNK
5435,Good food but really shity  service. The service was so bad I won't be back. I gave a 3 star rating based on food alone. Really sad because they could be a really busy place otherwise.,UNK
5436,I was hoping they would be better than the one on LV blvd. NOT. the peach cobbler was totally burned.  don't even know why they bothered to sell that to anybody. the mac and cheese as usual is over cooked. i tried. i can't.,UNK

5438,One of the smaller theaters in town. Every seat has a good view. I have been seated in just about every area of the theater and I have no complaints.

5442,"Great pizza. Good service. If you are looking for an intimate, quiet, romantic, cozy get-away pizza place.....don't come here. If you want the best pizza in a loud environment, then this is the place for you otherwise, stay away and stop making the place so crowded.",UNK

5452,"Very nice staff, great selection!! I love the framboise. The smaller of the two is a bit cramped for me, and they could be a bit cleaner but that's practically every bar in existence. Really great specials. The clientele is so-so.",UNK
5453,This is a great place for lunch.  The food is sooo yummy and prepared very quickly.  It's a nice cheap and healthy lunch option downtown.  My only complaint is that the dining room tends to be pretty messy - I would recommend taking your food to go.,UNK
5454,This is a very expensive steakhouse in Las Vegas that runs out of STEAK (as well as 4-5 other important menu items) & doesn't even apologize sincerely.  It was only 8pm and not even particularly busy. Epic Fail. There are plenty of great steakhouses in Las Vegas. Good luck!,UNK
5455,"Since I last posted my review, we have been coming here on Friday nights for Trivia.  Our waitress is very nice and we never have empty glasses.  It is almost a dive bar, but not quite.

5460,"Everyone seems to know everyone else. Italian being spoken by more than half the customers. Atmosphere is abundant, but the gelato is awesome. The waffle cones are fresh, and you get plenty for the price. My wife and I will be back often with the family in tow. Maybe we'll pick up a little Italian.",UNK

5470,"Great wine list and novelty wine \""fetching\"" but when the entrees arrived I remembered those old Wendy's commercials with the miniature servings.  The overall experience was overpriced.  It was probably one of the most expensive dinners I've had and walked away disappointed.",UNK
5471,"Food was average. You can tell its an American-Mexican restaurant.  The flavor is bland, their salsa is bland. Their burritos are big but as soon as you cut into it, everything falls out. And you end to eating a big plate of filling.",UNK

5474,Hartman and his staff are FRAUDS. I don't understand how they charge double then other eye doctors. Then they go and charge both mine and my spouse VSP insurance. When we specifically said charge only one. The worst experience ever. I don't understand how this place has such high reviews. It does not deserve it..,UNK
5475,Food was good but portions were small and expensive for what you got. $22 for a pot pie.  Thought it would be larger but about the same size as a frozen Swansons. Got five medium scallops and 3 out of the 5 clams had no clams in it. I know vegas is expensive but this was too much.,UNK
5476,My cousin took me here for dinner last night and I am hooked! The best curry I've ever tried. The portions are generous and the curry itself is very smooth. I got the pork tenderloin with a side of tofu katsu. Everythibg was delicious. The tofu salad was bomb too.,UNK
5477,"Worst drive thorough in the entire world. If it's busy people can't get in people can't get out, It causes traffic.",UNK
5478,Beautiful interior. The stone walls are stunning. Visit the restroom just to see the fab staircase. Perigees are a must. Also had the potato pancakes (perfectly done) and the cabbage stew (kind of one note). We would definitely go back.,UNK
5479,My second visit was hit it on the spot.  I feel SO good after dining here.....I mean.. Drinking here... the Juice is quick and filling.  It's high octane fuel for your body and cells.  JUICE GOOD.,UNK

I feel bad because it's such a waste!  I have gone about three times and each time I tried a different flavor.  The variety is great.",UNK
5486,"For some reason, I like this place.  They play some good throwback rock n roll   Located in a prime spot in the party district of Scottsdale. Good beer, good music, good location - life is good.  Happy hour specials are somewhat meager",UNK
5487,Very disappointed with one of the female employees. Very rude and just flat out nasty!

5492,My favorite place in the town. :-) I love their #24. We went there after a meeting on new year and we ran into a group of friends. Chinese people only pay for the good food. \n\nThe price is good and the food is great. I found take out gets a bigger portion than eat in.,UNK

5497,pretty cheap but prob bc they're off the strip at the end of it. the rooms are nice but so far from the strip. nothing to offer really for entertainment here unless you like old couples yelling at each other for spending their social security checks on the slots,UNK
5498,Not great. Won't be back. Bad service and just Ok food. Sushi was the best part. The Chinese all tasted the same and no noodles.,UNK
5499,i eat here very frequently  i don't know why  it's probably because it's nearby it's ok i like that they deliver and have a wide variety of  canned soda but they don't have shish kabobs they only have  kabobs there's a difference but i do like the gyros.,UNK

5506,"Very disappointing. Showed up at 11 am, expecting the market to close at 12, more than half of the market was packed up. The booths that were still open wouldn't even talk to me when I showed interest in their product due to them being too \""busy\"" packing up.",UNK

5508,Not my favorite brewery in town but it was a pleasant experience. The beer selection is very good and the brews go down smoothly. Food was decent. Better than traditional bar food but far from great. Huge place could definitely accommodate a big party. Also a very nice patio.,UNK

5511,"What I love about Pei Wei is that they cook the food to order.  It isn't steam table food.  Their Mongolian Beef is a real winner.  The meat is tender, not chewy, and because it is cooked fresh, the thicker pieces still have a faint pink inside.",UNK
5512,"Aquarium is totally NOT worth it, unless you never been to an acquiring before. I wouldn't waste money on it.",UNK

5514,What a nightmare. Do not use them. I scheduled a cleaning and no one showed up or called. My voicemail was never returned. I called later that week and allowed them to reschedule for the following Monday. I received an email 30 min before my appt canceling the appt. Ridiculous!,UNK

5523,Bartender was cool. One male Wait-staff have ridiculously crap attitude. To the point he wouldn't move out of my way to let me pass by him to my seat; just stared at me as I had to squeeze by him running into other patrons. \nI'd love to hear why personnel like this have jobs.,UNK
5524,Thanks to Yelp I picked this place out while passing through Phoenix.  Whoa I really loved it.  \n\nI had the pork loin with cornbread pudding.  What a meal to end my 2 week stay in Arizona.  I think this meal was my favorite on the whole trip.,UNK

5533,"Decent selection. I'm not a fan of the way they remodeled the store recently, though.  The health food aisles have been moved by the Pharmacy, and all the cereal is now with the produce. Makes no sense to me.",UNK
5534,"The meatball sandwich thingy, in a pizza dough bun is freakin AMAZING, the onion bread with olive oil and balsamic is freaking AMAZING! The pastas are not amazing :(.  The service is always so warm and friendly!",UNK
5535,"Overall, a really good from scratch burger! Fries were excellent... Think of Freddy's skinny fries with In-n-Out fries!  A little pricey... But what isn't in Vegas nowadays!  Haha!",UNK
5536,No beating around the bush on this one! Delicious and Affordable. It's around the corner of my house and I go often and have NEVER been disappointed!,UNK
5537,"Small and cozy, Debbie is all heart and twice the talent. She is a lot of fun \nAnd I enjoy the time I spend there as much as I enjoy my hair when I leave :)\nA place I'd recommend :)",UNK
5538,Russ is honest and reasonable.\nWe will not allow anyone else to work on our 2 Mercedes.\nWe have saved thousands of dollars through him and avoided the dreaded dealer drama and overcharging.\n\nHe is no-nonsense and extremely knowledgeable.,UNK
5539,My husband and I went here for valentines day. Our server was pleasant and there was no wait. I tried the Cajun seasoning with chicken and ginger citrus/honey soy sauce. The result was awesome! I wish there were a location in the university area.,UNK
5540,Pros: Bubble drinks are good. Wings and crab rangoon are crispy. Good service.\n\nCons: Noodles were overcooked and either drenched in too much sauce or too dry/bland. Definitely not authentic asian cuisine.,UNK
5541,I went to Mimi's for breakfast/brunch and was diappointed.  The food was ok and the prices were a bit on the high side.  Service was decent but my expectations for this place were high and I was disappointed.,UNK
5542,We were disappointed in the food and the service - not up to the caliber that we have had there in the past.   Service was slow and the food was really salty... I brought guests with us thinking we were getting the normal GREAT food - not so this visit!,UNK
5543,"Extremely tasty, nice ambiance, and good #customerservice. However, small rolls, can be a bit pricey, but a cute little date spot.",UNK
5544,$2 beers at the center bar. $1 craps and blackjack and super cheap food. The karaoke is a bit obnoxious but what can you expect from a locals dive casino. Service is a little slow but you can pass the time by watching the characters that frequent this dump.,UNK
5545,"Mediocre at best, the prime rib was tasteless and chewy. The fish was dry, the sourdough rolls were so hard that I one could be used as a weapon. The salad was the best part because I made it on my own.",UNK
5546,"As a small business owner, it is important to me to support other small businesses instead of corporate chains. The service is very good, the coffee is tasty and they have a nice variety of breakfast and lunch foods. It is nice to see the same people every time I go in and I appreciate the staff addressing me by my name and knowing my order.",UNK
5547,Excellent place. Can't beat BYOB with no corkage fee and fresh Italian food. Definitely recommend!!,UNK
5548,"OK restaurant, for a nice vietnamese breakfast, the food and soup was ok.\nThe servicewas ok.\nOverall, somewhat cheap, but good not excellent...",UNK
5549,Don't waste your time!!  There are so many better options in the area.  We ignored the Yelp reviews and ended up regretting eating here.,UNK
5550,The food was average with some dishes below average.  I had to return one dish because it really tasted bad and they seemed anoyed.  They tried to tell me that kimchi is garlicky - as if I had never tasted it before. The reality is that the food tasted spoiled.  I wouldn't go back.,UNK
5551,"Still alot of regular's at the bar and a decent crowd on Friday night. Bud Lights are only 3 bucks and bartenders were very nice on this visit. Good TV set outside and improved TV's at bar. Nachos looked crazy big, but I did not sample any food.",UNK
5552,"I had the Quinoa Salad today and it was great. Don't go if you are in a hurry. The service is relaxed like the atmosphere in the restaurant. I love finding fresh, gluten free food and was not disappointed.",UNK
5553,"This is a nice little crepe shop inside a hotel, though it has limited offerings. The crepes are tasty and fresh, but everything is cooked within the crepe, providing for only a few food options for breakfast or lunch. For the price, this is a good option.",UNK
5554,This place is incredible.  Amazing and super unique coffee. The owner has more passion for coffee than most people have for anything. Which is the recipe for the greatest coffee possible.,UNK
5555,We were here the first time ... Incredible food and lots of it .. We enjoyed it and I think we are going to have left overs would last another five meals,UNK
5556,Food is good if you stick to the core of their menu.  They also have a good beer selection.  Great atmosphere for kids because it is loud.  Biggest complaint is the hostesses; they always act like you are inconveniencing them when you ask for a table.,UNK
5557,Very Good.\nAll you can eat.  Meat of all kinds and lots of it. Cooked anyway you like it.\nSalad bar was also Great.  Service was also great.  If your a meat eater this place is a must when in Pittsburg.\nIt is Zuverman approved.,UNK
5558,I was very impressed with the speed at which I received my order.  The setup was very easy and the staff was very helpful.  They were able to answer every question I had.  I would definitely recommend Red Seven to any person interested in purchasing a computer... the most bang for your buck!,UNK
5559,My burger was salty and chared - I ordered medium. My soda was flat and they had no means of replacing it with something that wasn't. \n\nThe service was mediocre and it was very loud.,UNK
5560,"July 2011 - def. typical bar food - no option for side salad w my wrap...umm potato salad I guess? Limited menu and not much \""healthy\"" but it's not like I really thought there would be!",UNK
5561,"Stopped for dinner, not like the first time I went there!  Strips where small and dry, worst chicken strips ever!  Albertsons has Better chicken strips",UNK
5562,"One of our favorite Mexican places in town. The handmade guac at the table is delicious, entree portion size leaves you full and the Margarita's are tasty. Good service and very good family crowd. Lots of creepy clown type figurines prevents the 5 star review...",UNK
5563,We had a small family reunion here. Food and drinks were just great. I will return next \ntime I am in Las Vegas. P.Adams/California,UNK
5564,I have been going to Lee's Tailoring for about 2 years now. I've had all types of clothing altered from blazers to formal dresses and they do a fantastic job. I am particularly picky and their work is very professional and completed in adequate timing.  Great service!,UNK
5565,"Service was so-so. They were receiving a delivery so that might have to do with it. Food was hot and fresh, but we did not do AYCE. The shrimp tempura was good, but the zucchini was a bit oily.",UNK
5566,"Very modern design. Play area is great for older kids, very dirty though. Bathroom was filthy...urine on each toilet and the floor. No toilet paper. It was very crowded at 4pm.  Service was good and food fresh.",UNK
5567,"This place is so dope! They have crazy comfy chairs while you wait, no standing needed! You can just roll in like 10 minutes early for your appointment and be like \""oh you know I came to sit in those crazy comfy chairs!\""",UNK
5568,"I only had time for 1 drink and it was horrific! Do NOT order the sangria.  I couldn't taste the brandy nor the orange juice.  The red wine they used was just plain awful!  They should be ashamed to be serving that stuff, and calling it Sangria.  wasted $6 tonight.",UNK
5569,"I don't have much to say about this place.  We went here late on a Friday and got average food, slow service, and about a hundred red hatted ladies walking by.  Apparently, there was a convention or something.  I mention this because it was far more entertaining than anything in this restaurant.\n\nMeh.",UNK
5570,"Le Milsa is the place to go to have \""Meat on a Sword\"" and I am not kidding.\nThe meat is amazing, and tastes really good, the prices are reasonable, but the drinks (even soft drinks) are more expensive then usual. Great for a night out.",UNK
5571,Good place to watch sports. Tons of TV's. Good looking girls. Service is not exceptional or above average. Food is not that great and the menu is quit small. Better restaurants and place in Scottsdale to see good looking people and sports.,UNK
5572,"Place is alright. Better than most the other options here at the airport but nothing exceptional. Had chips, salsa, and fish tacos. A traditional dressing on the tacos would have been better than the salsa I think.",UNK
5573,My favorite place to eat pizza in Mesa! The other food here is okay. I've had the Italian beef a few times and sometimes it is good and other times just edible.\n\nWe usually have good service and the prices aren't too bad.,UNK
5574,Couldn't sit us..very unhappy with the customer service here. I wouldn't recommend this place they're very mean to there customers who have been waiting for a long time..,UNK
5575,"The thing that sets this place apart, I think, is the family atmosphere. The employees are nice, and make it an enjoyable place to eat.",UNK
5576,"Shit service! Shit....\nIt's too bad there is a lot if competition in the area, and the menu looked great..",UNK
5577,typical froyo place- their fruit flavors are better than a lot of places i've gone to. tuesdays is double punch day and that's always a plus,UNK
5578,"22 min wait, 2nd week of the month. Lane 1. Says 7min avg wait time.\nI realize NOW, that an ODB readable vehicle can choose ANY lane, whereas the older non-ODB read must be in Lane 2 or 3.\nSignage poorly designage.",UNK
5579,"Well, it's large.  \n\nI'll sum it up quickly:  I've been to a lot of Asian grocery stores, and this one gets the honor of being the only place where I've seen large cockroaches scurrying about in broad daylight.",UNK
5580,"As my nickname is Sugar, of course we had to stop here.  Now I've got Sugar Factory gear, just because.  Ha!\n\nWe had lunch here after luxuriating in the water midsts outside.  It wasn't a memorable experience, but the food and treats were good.",UNK
5581,"We got excellent customer service from a very nice lady,Mika.  She not only cleaned my engagement &wedding rings, she also offered to clean my husband's ring even we did not buy his from Tiffany.",UNK
5582,What can you say about a Casino. Pretty much what he name says. Not sure if you get free drinks I was here for about two hour and I was never offered one. They did have free sodas but you had to get them.,UNK
5583,Tiny portions. After receiving my pasta entree i had to order more food because it was as if they were feeding a 2 year old. The pasta was a little on the salty side. Took over 30 minutes for us to receive our food although the place was slow. Ther server was very nice though.,UNK
5584,Try eating at PF Changs yesterday evening but there was over an hour and 45 minute wait so we left. Came back tonight plenty of seats dinner was good but nothing over the top to write home about the Asian cuisine was comparable to most Asian restaurants. The atmosphere was nice and the wait staff was friendly.,UNK
5585,"If you're in the mood for a mediocre burrito as big as your leg, you're in the right place.",UNK
5586,Today at Flamingo was our first time to any of the Egg Works locations.  Blackened Prime Rib Benny and the chicken club sandwich and Works Chili all rocked.  So did our great server Amy.  We will be back. The muffin is a great starter or dessert!  No one left hungry!,UNK
5587,"Dub-step hipster bar - maybe I am getting too old for this stuff, but after a few drinks and some fun girl date company it wasn't so bad, especially since this is not my scene. The roof dance floor with projector screens of trippy colors made the whole thing as well as the hipster sightings.",UNK
5588,"I thought the service was HORRIBLE! It was rude, the wait was long nothing good to say about the service. The food was average. The atmosphere is great though.",UNK
5589,"Prices are high and sandwiches are not anything special.\n\nI ordered the BLT, but for some reason, it tasted really fishy...\n\nCome here around 5pm and you get to people watch those who just left Wet Republic.",UNK
5590,I love wingstop. I have always been a fan of wingstop and this is my favorite location. This location is at least 3 times as big as a normal location and I love the service too. My favorite flavor is the cajun. Spicy with good overall flavor.,UNK
5591,They recently made some changes and it stinks. They have different and less options than last time. The sizes and prices of their bowls are kind of a joke. Not sure if I will return. The staff is overwhelming.,UNK
5592,"Live bull riding night, bbq galore, indoor and outdoor bar. View of rodeo action can be crowded. At the front door an open barrel of salted peanuts in the shell. You can even toss the peanut shells on the floor.",UNK
5593,"OK food, nothing exceptional. Lunch buffet was about $15 per person on a Sunday, the waitress was friendly and brought our drink orders fairly quickly. Probably wouldn't go out of my way again to come back to this buffet.",UNK
5594,"Atmosphere feels pretty comfortable. Service is great, the food is decent, but this place could really need a better ventilation system. We sat pretty far away from the hibachi grill, but my clothes still stink.",UNK
5595,It was just okay. We came here for happy hour and were surprised by the lack of people inside. The happy hour menu was very limited and we were underwhelmed with everything that we ordered. It wasn't terrible just wasn't great and we were expecting great food based on reviews and articles written about the restaurant.,UNK
5596,Wonderful dentist! Gives out his cell in case you need anything. Spends time with each patient and is truly concerned about all the kids that go there. We went there for an emergency tooth problem when our regular dentist couldn't get us in and loved them so much we switched to them.,UNK
5597,Best steak I have ever had.   Place is awesome and the service is second to none.  I will coming here a lot more.  I have told all my friends about it and will continue to tell all,UNK
5598,I love love love this studio! It is overflowing with love and energy. The instructors are amazing! The yogis are friendly and it is a great location! Everyone makes you feel welcome. I HIGHLY recommend taking some yogalicious classes with the NoDa Yoga crew :D,UNK
5599,"Just ok. Staff was nice, but food was lackluster. I got the green chile omelette which could have used a little more seasoning. It did have plenty of green chiles though. Also got the French toast which was a little better.",UNK
5600,"Be prepared to wait in line for over an hour unless you want to pay \""VIP\"" and cut the line... just saying.",UNK
5601,"It's bar food. Who cares. The place is a lot of fun. I always walk out with a smile on my face. FANTASTIC Friday Happy Hour. 50\u00a2 beer and a free buffet of \""snack food.\""",UNK
5602,"Pizza is average - they use the \""sweet\"" sauce which I do not care for. Pomo is better. Service was very slow and not very nice.",UNK
5603,"This time lobster fettuccine seems to have had much of the lobster removed prior to the dish arriving at my table.  Worse, timing was poor despite relatively low volume.  Drink took forever...arriving after my soup!  Overall somewhat disappointing now.",UNK
5604,"Unique location and good food, the flags remind me at my original home (Bavaria), can recommend the pizza and the carrot cake :)",UNK
5605,Been waiting for 25 minutes and order not even called in yet! People that came in after us are already finishing up their meals. Jonquil came back strong through. Got the manager to comp our meal for the long delay. Tipped him handsomely for the recovery. Will definitely return when i am in the area next time.,UNK
5606,Great service. Broke phone at 9:45 pm at home. Found mike online and called at 10:15 pm. He answered and was at my house by 11:15 pm phone was better then new 30 mins later. Best company I have ever done business with. HIGHLY recommend iPro if you break you iPhone.,UNK
5607,ONLY FOR THEIR TAKEOUT BREAKFAST:\n\nbest potatoes ever.  yum.,UNK
5608,"Great protein pancakes!!!!  We had fantastic service from Taylor, came back the next morning for another helping.  Will get another fix next time I am in town!",UNK
5609,"This is easily one of the best sandwich shops in Arizona. I usually get the white widow, but I've never had a bad sandwich. Everyone here is great, as is the atmosphere.",UNK
5610,Great menu options for all eaters. Service is pretty slow so don't go on a time crunch because they are helping large groups. We spent a total of an hour there waiting mostly. Vegan menu is awesome service not so much. Had to flag somebody down to get our check. Waited over a half hour for the food.,UNK
5611,Customer service is a huge thing for us. They close at 10 PM but we went in at 9:45 and was told sorry everything is already closed down we can't make anything. Why in the world would you close your restaurant 15 minutes before your actual closing time and tell paying customers that you can't do anything for them.,UNK
5612,"First timer...I ordered a protein bowl w/tri-tip. Not much flavor at all and the carrots were so hard that I was unable to \""stab\"" them with their plastic forks. I really doubt that I'll be back.",UNK
5613,"Food good... Cool little place... One thing that bother me I was told they can't honor the promotion on Yelp, cause it doesn't work and they don't know how to use it. So you out of luck. It's confusing why it still on yelp false advertisement. Not cool ;(",UNK
5614,"Wanted to go to Lotus of Siam, but we went here instead as a random pick. The food wasn't bad, but not great. Service was slow (I'm writing this review as we're waiting), but atmosphere was alright. Nice guy at the karaoke though.",UNK
5615,Got in fairly quick. Order placed and meal delivered in a very speedy fashion. Omelette bigger than my head? Plus. Found this place accidently...pleasantly surprised. Will probably go back.,UNK
5616,"The Chipotle for salads. Every salad topping you can imagine, and there is no limit... Plus, they have kale & homemade dressings. Love how they chop everything up small & mix it up. Simple, genius, and healthy.",UNK
5617,Number 2 super sonic double cheeseburger with extra mustard. Tots and my favorite strawberry slush. This sonic never gets it wrong. Very friendly staff and quick service too.,UNK
5618,"Love this place. And they have coupons too. The bonus is definitely the amount of food, you get enough for delicious lunch leftovers!",UNK
5619,I eat there about 3 times a week!! The antipasto salad and bread are addicting and can't be beat!,UNK
5620,Great market feel with awesome food. Went here a few times and it was always packed although we wanted these dumplings that was sol there and they had sold out both times we went to taste them so that was disappointing.,UNK
5621,"The food is solid french bistro faire, but the view of the Bellagio fountains, the restaurant decor, exceptional service, and decent prices are what really make this place.  \n\nLoved the baked cheese app, the bread pudding dessert and our attentive and friendly server.",UNK
5622,Great first visit. We were looking for something simple but not your standard bar fare and this delivered. Pizza rolls were great but the true winner was the pulled pork flatbread. We will be back,UNK
5623,"I don't know how many years I have been going to SONY, and I have never been disappointed. Sandwiches, pizzas, beverages are all delicious, have a great appearance and the prices are right. Love the people working there.",UNK
5624,Great staff.  Overpriced food and beverages. Small portions for a premium $$$$ price. Wait staff friendly and accessible but could not compensate for the overpriced bar food. Wings were small and few in number for a excessive price,UNK
5625,"Well, I keep trying, beer is cold service good if you can get it!.  The food is dog shit, eat lots of free peanuts.  I spend my money elsewhere, BTW took my dog there and he would not eat my hamburger,",UNK
5626,Excellent place!! I used to come here all the time wen I lived nearby. I live pretty far from\nThis place now but still make the drive to done here. Love the food!,UNK
5627,"Not very good on greeting people when you walk in but, the Deluxe pedicure was AMAZING!! Def worth the $30.00",UNK
5628,Got a hassle every single time I've tried to check in. And it is because they value technology over customer relations. Today their front desk was particularly rude. Not going to tolerate it one more time. I'm done and gone.,UNK
5629,"This is my quick stop for busy days. Its filling, they are fast and always give out free samples. The place is clean and its not costly. Of all the fast food chicken chains they have the best biscuits!!!!",UNK
5630,"Great fast casual pizza experience. Menu has tons of options. The staff is friendly and helpful. \n\nI had the grilled pesto pizza. The crust was crispy and delicious, and the ingredients were fresh. \n\nThey also have a great little bar area as well with some local craft beer options.",UNK
5631,"Nosh at Bally s. The food was super tastey. Although it wasn't very cheap, but what is on the strip? I got the French dip on parmesan and want too interested in the menu at first. But I surely enjoyed eating it! Open 24 hours, gourmet food, tastey.",UNK
5632,"All I can say is, I wish I had gone somewhere else. If it weren't for some of the awesome professors then I wouldn't give this place any stars.",UNK
5633,"I fell in love with this place. Great Thai food, cheesy atmosphere and super friendly service. But I went again about two weeks ago and the management has changed. The food was the same, but I ate my Massaman sadly.  I hope it doesn't change too much.",UNK
5634,"My go to place for quick chinese food. The food is good, especially for quick service. The service is quick and the people are nice. Exactly what you can expect from a quick service chinese restaurant",UNK
5635,2nd only to Giordano's. Love the sweet pizza sauce. The waiter had me do the Mamas signature and i was pretty much blown away.,UNK
5636,this location sucks\nbad food\nshady restaurant\nthis place is falling apart more and more everyday\nthe drive thru speaker has been broken for years so what does that tell you\nstay away,UNK
5637,Where Walgreens at McDowell & Indian School on 107th Ave didn't have CVS did and great customer service and lower prices. Goodbye Walgreens & Hello CVS.,UNK
5638,Not happy! My nails are yellowing after 2 days. Called to see if they could refund since I was from out of town. They took my name and number and never called back. I spent 180 on my mom and mine pedi/mani ..they should of tried to rectify the problem.,UNK
5639,Every time I've been at this shop Ely hooks it up with a really nice cut!  Also make sure to go when it's not busy since he's the only barber.,UNK
5640,"Great food. Great service. This is a gluten free friendly place with a fusion of the Freemont vibe and Seattle coffeeshop service. Throw in the vegan options and you have just gone \""Wild\"".",UNK
5641,"I absolutely LOVE this place, so much so that I have a membership, which I highly suggest purchasing. Even if you only went 4 times a year for the season changes, it is well worth the money. It is peaceful, beautiful and relaxing. The Christmas show is amazing and I cannot wait to see it this year!",UNK
5642,I handed the dude at the register my credit card and he made a racist remark about my name out loud. Speechless. \n\nTake your business elsewhere.,UNK
5643,The Kona coffee is a personal favorite for my coffee for my hubby.  We love the banana crepes and Monte Cristo.  I also love the Chicken strip salad!,UNK
5644,"Even for the price I paid, which was $5, this place is still not worth eating at. It was like they unpackaged a crap load of frozen food and dumped it in warming trays. Don't eat here. Go eat Del Taco instead.",UNK
5645,Everybody should definitely believe the hype about this place!!! \nEvery single item on the entire menu is a decadent heart attack. \nTrying the classics like the poutine foie gras and the duck in a can are musts.,UNK
5646,It's not what I expected. The meat didn't taste that good and the guy who served me smashed the roasted hog and the apple sauce into my roll as if he hates food like this. Will never come back!,UNK
5647,"We were in the area looking for a place to eat, food was very good and we tried a lot of different things, Nachos, sandy's special, flautas, stuffed steak quesadilla.  All of it excellent. Service was hit or miss but I would certainly go back.",UNK
5648,"I had not been for quite awhile. The sandwiches are still very good but the \""small\"" is much smaller than it used to be and the price has gone up quite a bit. $10+ for a small sandwich and small drink. My vote is to go 2 miles north to AZ sandwich co, much better value.",UNK
5649,Jessica Lucero is who I normally see and am very pleased with the care and professionalism I receive each time I am there.  The wait time is long but she is never in a rush like most doctors I have seen.  The staff is great also,UNK
5650,I am positive no one who reviewed this place got water delivery. Worst customer service ever! Every month there was s new issue and no one knows what end is up when you call. Horrible.,UNK
5651,This place is terrible.  \n\nAwful beer selection.  Nice enough (if not braindead) servers.  Nauseating clientele.  \n\nWon't be going back.,UNK
5652,"If you like meat, then come here!!! You get so much meat in one sandwich that the meat is falling out left and right every bite you make!\n\nAlso the staff there are super nice!! \n\nGreat place, especially for the price!",UNK
5653,"Nice looking place inside. Terrible service, waited for over 2 hours even with a reservation! Would never come here again! Great food just really upset about the wait!",UNK
5654,The staff pushed us off from one to another. Their portions do not warrant their prices! $14 for a burrito and you can get one same size at Taco Bell for $4. The orders were not prepared as requested.  I will not be back. First impression means everything and they blew it!,UNK
5655,Don't know any other karaoke sushi place other than Geisha. No worries you won't have to feel awkward and sing in front of a crowd because Geisha has private rooms you can book and with a group of friends this place is such a blast!,UNK
5656,Man the service here is terrible! They act like they're doing you a favor by blessing you with their presence. AND their drinks are ridiculously overpriced. Makes me depressed that my best friend has to settle for their mediocre boba just because there's hardly any other places in Vegas.,UNK
5657,"Horrible eye exam! I would not choose this lens crafters for an eye exam...maybe frames but that is it. My eye exam with dilation was about 10 minutes total. There was absolutely nothing done, asked about or mentioned during the quick 10 minutes. \nI will never visit a place like this again for an exam.",UNK
5658,"Avoid this place!  Rip off, rude, incompetent.  If you do go here, look around at how there's no one else in the shop, and the empty garage.  Turn around and leave before they touch your vehicle.",UNK
5659,"Everything was bad. From the sticky Spanish rice, to the tap water, to the cold food (that was supposed to be hot), to the service.  Will not go again!",UNK
5660,"Interesting menu, great (contemporary) decor, and good food.  However, the prices are high and the service was slow.  We went for breakfast on a Thursday.  Place was one third full and we only saw our server once after he took the order.  Took forever to get a refill of coffee.",UNK
5661,This was my third time eating here and by far the best. Everything was perfectly prepared but the best of all was our waiter Sal. He was perfectly attentive without being invasive and made the evening the best ever! Thanks Sal,UNK
5662,Worst hotel in Vegas!  Thry don't stand behind the quoted prices and unreasonable front desk - they love to argue. Will never ever stay here again!!  With so many hotels in the area you would think they would value the business of frequent guests but I was wrong on that one.,UNK
5663,Love their pizzas!\nTry house special or seafood pizzas.\n\nThey do deliver and take-out as well.,UNK
5664,So thankful for Roadrunner Pharmacy.  They make prescription refills so easy.  Wonderful customer service and quick delivery.  My cat Libra loves the new toy she gets every month.  Very thoughtful!,UNK
5665,"I treat myself to the stand about once a week and always have the intention of only ordering 2 short rib tacos . Well, I end up with a cheeseburger, fries one of each taco and a milkshake. Hands down the best burger in the valley paired with great service.",UNK
5666,"We decided to try the buffet while staying at the cosmopolitan. Lack of carved meats, seafood, desserts and a variety of food stations. It was ok, but i would recommend the bachannal instead, its worth the xtra $10",UNK
5667,Very  disappointing lunch. Stale bread on a $13 sandwich? Had to send it back. Pickle was a pale shade of grey. Waitress never once checked on me. Maybe dinner is a better experience but lunch was a complete disappointment.,UNK
5668,"Stopped in for a coffee and they were cool enough to let us in despite closing for lunch. Tasty coffee, great spot facing the water. Would go there for a bite next time I'm in town.",UNK
5669,I've tried many pho places in vegas Pho Kihn Do is by far my favorite the special combo pho is as close to Cali pho as it gets here in vegas. I'm so happy I found this spot.,UNK
5670,This place is great for cheap grocery stocking. I've gone on several occasions when the pickings were slim but in general you get A LOT for your money here.  \n\nDefinitely recommended!,UNK
5671,My Second Cheba Hut visit....hit the other one in SD.\n\nWOW...another 5 star place.,UNK
5672,The lovely ladies that work here obviously know what they're doing. Great service and quality even during the lunch hour. Prices are great. Can't wait to go back and try more items.,UNK
5673,Here's yet another example of what's becoming almost a stereotype: Tasty Thai food smack dab in the middle of a non-descript strip mall. Nice decor and ambiance.,UNK
5674,Used to come under previous ownership and wanted to try again... What a disappointment. We walked in at 10 till 9 and were told that they closed at 10. We were treated like an inconvenience. The band was entertaining but service was unfriendly. The only reason I'm giving 2 stars in because I liked the wine selection.,UNK
5675,SCAM ARTISTS!!!  Classic upsale tactics and charging way too much.  Shitty work as well.  please avoid going here at all costs.  beware of their fake google review page which has 27 ridiculous fake reviews.,UNK
5676,This just in y'all your one pound bag is 50% off when you check in on Yelp. And that rocks my socks off right now considering I have an unhealthy relationship with their Eye Opener!,UNK
5677,It was huge and had a cool feel. They played REALLY awesome music and it wasn't too crowded. It did a bit crowded but I really like that it's connected to the Playboy club so that we are able to hang out there when we are tired of the larger crowd. It's a true Vegas experience.,UNK
5678,"Awesome alternative to Starbucks.  Great coffee, fun approach to customer service with enthusiastic and friendly staff, drive thru line can be a little tricky to maneuver though.",UNK
5679,All of the various cancer charities run by the Reynolds family are SCAMS. They pay themselves a fortune and give $0.02 for each dollar raised to people suffering from cancer. STAY AWAY!!!!!!!,UNK
5680,vanilla chai soy latte...not as thick as starbucks or coffee bean (for all you west coasters) but it did the job nicely and the price is def more affordable than its competition.,UNK
5681,"Thank you John for taking care of my taxes in a professional, efficient manner. My family and I have been using Conrado & Company for many years and will continue to be loyal customers. The staff is extremely friendly and very competent. This is by far the best place to get your taxes done, call them today!",UNK
5682,My review is not about the food. Came for drinks with friends. Bartenders were unbelievably rude. Also they had to look up in a drink book how to make a dirty martini. (which they ended up putting sweet vermouth in) Worst. Bar. Experience. Ever.,UNK
5683,Since new management has taken over this place sucks. It is a giant rip off to top off the insult to injury. Will charge you for a bunch of work not related to the actual problem.,UNK
5684,"Anthony @ the bar is amazing!!!  Gotta try his Milagro peno martini! Well that and everything else we tried.  Good vibes, good food food, great drinks, great service!!!  I'll be back.",UNK
5685,This is a great place. The employees are very friendly and very helpful. Kudos to Amy for all her help when I came in looking for a storage unit. I highly recommend this place!,UNK
5686,"the food wasnt that bad as far as mcdonalds goes, but they screwed up my drive thru order almost every time I went there. I'll go out of my way to go somewhere else.",UNK
5687,"went there last night..Terrible customer service, employees yelling and carrying on. Got my order wrong then acted like I was bothering them to correct it. Guess adding lettuce to an Enchirito is a task. Horrible infestation of flies in dining room.",UNK
5688,"Cute, hip atmosphere. Food was delish. Arrived 15 minutes before our reservation and unfortunately could not be seated but completely fine as it was a Saturday but was served a glass of sangria on the house which was very unexpected yet very appreciated! Will be returning. Service was great as well!",UNK
5689,"It's better than the dirty, meth-infested, crap-hole it used to be. Bands are way loud and no food sucks.",UNK
5690,WORST PLACE EVER! 3 workers and nome of them could help me. I will NEVER come here again. VERY UNSATISFIED with GSO. It shouldn't even get 1 star.,UNK
5691,"This Buffalo Wild Wings is laid out much more nicely than some of the others I've been to. TVs everywhere, including right over your tables, and good lighting so you can actually see your food. And the wings, of course, are delicious.",UNK
5692,"Oddly enough after using zerorez for a long time I was disappointed with my last appointment.  I had my carpets re-cleaned and the outcome was much better.  Additionally, the cost was half as much.  I'll be sticking with the new company.",UNK
5693,"Dear Lee,\n\nWhere the hell is the meat? Please fix.\n\nSincerely,\nAce.\n\nPS. Cash only....really?",UNK
5694,The best thing about this salon is the stylist Tayla Hart. She is amazing with color and cuts. I go in looking like crap and come out looking like a million bucks. I will never go to another stylist!,UNK
5695,"Saw a concert in the main portion of the Nile Theater in July.  People need to know there is no alcohol service in the theater, it is extremely hot with no air conditioning, and the sound quaility is very poor.  Go see the bands you like anywhere else.",UNK
5696,"Of the dozens of trendy yogurt shops that have popped up in Scottsdale and Tempe over the last year or so, I think Mojo has the best chance of staying in business. Lots of flavors and toppings, plus I like the punch-card where you can get one free after buying 10.",UNK
5697,"Decent fresh food. Try's a bit too hard to be different causing some dishes to not be so great or something different than what they are claiming to be, but, overall good and I appreciate the effort to be fresh and healthy.",UNK
5698,We have lived in this area for 4 years now and always wondered about this place. We stopped in and ordered a regular old sausage and onion pizza. We weren't very impressed. Maybe we'll go back and try a sub at some point but I wouldn't recommend the pizza.,UNK
5699,"I don't care about \""ambiance\"" or \""decor\"" anymore.  I hit 40 and it doesn't matter to me anymore.\n\nI am more concerned about food.\n\nThis food is awesome.\n\nGo, it is incredible.",UNK
5700,I had to wait about a two minutes in my car to get service while the salesman was busy texting. Salesman then became very rude when I declined a wax and tried to overcharge me. Floors were still dirty after vacuumed and dash was not completely clean. Would not return.,UNK
5701,"Stopped by this gallery during the March 2010 First Friday to see some work of some people I know (artists, architects, furniture designers, graphic designers, etc...)  Nice and simple little gallery/exhibition space in the Arts District - worth a visit, particularly during the First Friday art crawl.",UNK
5702,"Lovely - facing the Bellagio fountains, outdoor patio, full on french interior, good service, good food? Sooo glad we ate there instead of having Buffet of buffets. \n\nFood: A-\nAmbience: A\nService: A\nValue: B",UNK
5703,Never been disappointed by the food at the roasting company. I would say they use high quality ingredients and it's always super tasty. Prices are reasonable for the quality! We go whenever we're in the SouthPark area.,UNK
5704,"Love Rick and the job that they do. Always on time, do a great job and enjoyable to chat with. We have used Amazing Carpet & Tile for many years and will continue to do so!",UNK
5705,Tried to go there for breakfast this morning because we love the one near us in the Milwaukee area. We walked out before for even opening the second door for two reasons- 1) It smelled like vomit in the vestibule and 2) they take cash only. No debit or credit cards. Seemed very odd!,UNK
5706,"Stopped in for a beer.  Just awesome selection and superb service.  Would definitely recommend for foodies, beer snobs, and folks looking for a cool place downtown.  Check it out!!!",UNK
5707,Food and drink mediocre at best.   Tacos were served with raw tortillas.   Drink order was wrong twice.   Great atmosphere came on the first week of opening.  Need to improve basic execution of food.,UNK
5708,Great food and easy to order. I eat a lot of Greek food. This was authentic and tasty. Eat here. You will not be disappointed.,UNK
5709,"Nothing special about this buffet- I've been to worse.  Still, it's overpriced for what it serves (like a lot of buffets here) and I probably wouldn't come here again unless invited by a friend with a free coupon. The way I came here the first time.",UNK
5710,"The drinks were great! The lady that helped us was super nice and sadly told us that because of I-15 expansion, they are being forced to shut down.... another non-Starbucks bites the dust.",UNK
5711,"Very happy with service and selection. They always treat me and my pup great. My only complaint would be it tends to stay busy at this location so if ur in a hurry and will need help, plan to be a bit patient and wait or come back on a day u have more time.",UNK
5712,"The line moves fast in this Courtney Starbucks, the staff is relativity nice if not chatty. They remember all of there repeat faculty members, and standing in line with some of the professors is really Funny at times. But the line is crazy dinner times and they get on you if you take photos.",UNK
5713,Gyro ok but not great a little on the dry side and Swimming in greese\nChicken ok as well but agian on the dry side\nVeggies were great and potatoes were well season in lemon,UNK
5714,"The five course fixed menu on Valentine's day was delicious - well done Chef Stefan!  The atmosphere is very inviting and elegant.  Like many hotel restaurants, you need to walk through the contemporary lobby to get to the bathroom, but that is my only criticism.  This is a lovely, non-smoking restaurant for a business dinner, quiet date or group event.",UNK
5715,"This is the best show I've ever seen!!! Tickets are expensive, but worth every dime get the best seats possible, if not you will regret it.",UNK
5716,"Horrible the guy yelled at us for having to much luggage, almost ran over pedestrians and honked repeatedly at them while they had right away. Worst experience very upset that I paid for round trip. currently on shuttle that bad!",UNK
5717,So don't believe the guys in the street who give you the bracelet and tell you it's a free admission bracket you still have to pay but you get a free drink which isn't bad. They play good music. Two fights did break out with the first hour we were there though.,UNK
5718,"Not a big fan.   Granted, there isn't much competition in Florence, but this place really failed to offer much worthy of going out to eat.  Do check out the Greek Monastery nearby Florence though - very, very cool.",UNK
5719,"Would steer clear, went to the bar for drinks and out of 4 drinks we ordered, only one was correct.  Really lousy bartender!  Also we sat in lounge and there were several 'girlfriend experiences' going on...Ick!  I'll never go back.",UNK
5720,"I never understood the hype or the lines out of the door for this place. The food is very mediocre and the place smells. It's small and cramped. \n\nStaff is friendly enough though.\n\nYour pal,\nWalter",UNK
5721,I had the Fettuccini Cassanova. The description on the menu sounded wonderful be it lacked flavor. I rarely salt my food but had to go two rounds with the salt shaker service was a little hovering.,UNK
5722,"This is not my favorite mall, the escalator rails are usually sticky and overall it just has a weird feeling, plus there is no longer a Cinnabon.",UNK
5723,"This place blows more than Jenna Jamison. Horrible place, they think they're the shit and they clearly aren't. I wish I could give zero stars.",UNK
5724,"Scottsdale Mountainside has it down when it comes to customer service, towels and keys. Scottsdale also has a cabinet that keeps your keys by number at front desk, try it. Also, stuck up staff is not a good look.",UNK
5725,"Went here for dinner-the only veggie option is a falafel burger, which is meh. They make up for this with alcoholic milkshakes-and it's not just a little bit of booze in them-it's a booze-fused beverage with a hint of milk and ice cream.",UNK
5726,The rooms are dated.  Nice public spaces.  I would not stay here if I had to pay for the room.  Better choices on the strip.,UNK
5727,This was a good place to get a haircut -- all kinda basic --- and  a bit hit-and-miss with the stylists.  But it is close to campus and reasonably priced.   I found one person who I will return to ---,UNK
5728,Omg so good! I'm a vegan and I can't believe they haw vegan ice cream here... Also vegan fudge and brownies!!! They let you sample everything. It's tucked next to tropical smoothie on fort apache. Viva la vegan!,UNK
5729,This place has cockroaches.\nPeople throw up in the booths.\nPretty good white russian.\n\n(b),UNK
5730,Not much too say here.  You have to pay 15 bucks to get in and this was definitely not what I expected after most places I've been to don't charge.,UNK
5731,"What more could you want in a casual pizza place?!\n\nA variety of pizza's on the menu, other items as well.  A distinctive feeling and style.  A happy crew serving you deliciousness.  When I'm hanging around this area again, I'll be back!",UNK
5732,Have always loved Kona but really had a bad experience. Rude waitress and dirty glasses and silverware.  Waitress spilled a drink and didn't even apologize.,UNK
5733,"Pizza was ok, nothing exceptional.. salad was good.. I don't think I will order  a pizza next time from here.",UNK
5734,El Cortez is less than one block walking distance from Fremont Street. I used to valet my car there when I went to bars downtown. \nThe casino isn't big but they have penny slots! It's nice and cozy and I always feel welcome.,UNK
5735,"We had a very nice dinner at Nove - the food, service and ambiance were all very nice.  We had planned on eating at n9ne but it was as loud as a nightclub.",UNK
5736,This place is amazing!!  Best pizza in town!  Staff is super friendly and food comes out fast.  Owner is fantastic and makes sure everyone is happy.  Cannot say enough about this place.  Take-out is just as good as when I'm at the restaurant.,UNK
5737,"Aquarium is great and yes, there are seahorses! Noisy, but that's expected because it is located in the casino.",UNK
5738,"We got fooled by the rating of this restaurant. This is certainly not the best peruvian food we have had. In fact, it was below average. Never going back again!\n\nI have had so much better peruvian food in Jersey. This was not worth the money they charge you.",UNK
5739,Its awesome to finally find a 24 hr Mexican food joint! It did take a long time to get my food but it was well worth the wait.,UNK
5740,"We go here about 4-6 times a month. really awesome sushi at a really good value. The sushido peppers with truffle mushroom sauce is great, as are pretty much all the specialty rolls and nigiri.",UNK
5741,I love how they are quicker on the phones than wal-mart! Wal-mart can kiss it! and the woman in the bakery was the biggest sweetheart!,UNK
5742,Dining room is a little dingy for a chain. Ripped seat cushions and a messy condiment bar. Drive through does not get orders exact ( e.g. Ask to hold the cheese ensures a hamburger with cheese).,UNK
5743,"This Taco Bell serves sub par food! the ice water tastes like someone spit in it and the tacos look like someone stepped on them. I did like the doritos taco though and ordered it once, was very dissapointed when I got a regular hard taco instead that was crushed!! Ack!!",UNK
5744,"I Love Oasis Bagels.  Most importantly they have great bagels.  unlike anything else you will find.  Good omlettes, and the chicken sandwich for lunch is my favorite.  I have been many times and find the quality to be always good.  A great part of the community and neighborhood.  Friendly people and a great meeting place.",UNK
5745,Would not honor vendors 25% off discount sign and very rude and condescending . With this kind of service they wont last long.,UNK
5746,"Ordered a french dip sandwich with fries. The fries were excellent and crispy, but the sandwich could have been a little bigger. Overall, it had a nice atmosphere and the value was average.",UNK
5747,"Such a find...great food, perfect service, and a dozen different \""I'd like to try that next time\"" things coming out of the kitchen.\"" Would definitely repeat. \n\nThe appetizer platter for 4 is a great value.",UNK
5748,"Great deal! Know ahead of time that there's a hidden (ish) fee of $20 for a resort fee, but it's still a great deal. Parking was a little weird, but the valet was very convenient and efficient. I had a pleasant stay, and the hotel's restaurants were good.",UNK
5749,"First of all the Manager was not wearing professional clothes at all. The second thing is that we waiting a half an hour to rent our car.  Third and last thing is that the check engine light was on.  We did not realize that until we got home. :(  So,  we had to go back to the car rental and get a new car.",UNK
5750,"I tried the Chicago dog, was very disappointed. It was on the level of Sonic drive-thru. I understand I'm at a food truck and not Portillo's or Hot Doug's, but it didn't even taste right.",UNK
5751,"I am disappointed Barros does not have a direct contact link on their website. Last night I ordered pizza for takeout  from this new location. Unfortunately, I ordered a well-done pie, and the crust was soft and limp. This new staff needs to learn how to do it right, because everything else was good.",UNK
5752,Yummy.  The extra meat and boiled egg sides are a must.  I tried the pork ramen bowl.  Order the extra noodles if you're not full off the bowl.\n\nFriendly staff.\n\nGood portions.\n\nAffordable.,UNK
5753,"We really enjoy the food and the service at this cafe. Great portions, great price, great people. Did I mention they have the best baklava EVER! Yum yum yum! I can't wait for our next visit.",UNK
5754,"The grinders & custard are heavenly, but there's too many kids standing around behind he counter & the food is expensive for what you get.",UNK
5755,it's nice to have a BBQ place that serves beer in our area. and it's open late which is awesome. Mac and cheese is awesome and so is the cornbread. fast friendly service. the BBQ sauce was a bit salty but very good all-around.,UNK
5756,"I like the atmosphere here and the drink specials are pretty good, but if you're hungry definitely go somewhere else.  I have never been impressed with the food.  It's very mediocre at best.",UNK
5757,The fish is decent but the inside is very dirty and disgusting. When you come go drive thru and eat in the car it will be much better due to how dirty the place is. I will never eat inside again. Drive thru is the way to go.,UNK
5758,"Super super friendly staff.\n\nbut in a very odd area and the clientel....hmmmm all high school thugs.\n\nMight come back, I definitely don't feel uncomfortable there, just out of place maybe.",UNK
5759,"Bad service on a slow Sunday afternoon? Not professional! The food didn't hit the right spot too. At the end, we were also given the wrong bill! I am sure the French wouldnt have been pleased with your sloppy service. Avoid.",UNK
5760,Fantastic experience. The wait staff was incredibly attentive and knowledgeable. The food was high class enough for the price (we ordered 2 different fixed price meals). Good wine menu - options under $30. Fancy place for a fancy occasion. We would definitely go back if wealthy and so inclined...   :),UNK
5761,"Memories memories memories\n\nI have so much fond memories here.  The club is swanky and is really good with treating the girls =).  My favorite thing... playing on the pole.  Mental pictures, no cameras please =)",UNK
5762,Skip it. Unfriendly staff and food that is sub par. At least at the fast food spots you know what you're getting... They put cilantro on both our dishes too; on the fries and the chicken wings.,UNK
5763,Pretty good food. Ordered for delivery. Took over an hour for delivery on a sat night. Got chicken Parmesan and a calzone. The garlic knots are really good.  Maybe we'll try the pizza next time.,UNK
5764,"I would've wanted the Entire spa to myself.  That is usually how I like spas!  I love the Artic Spa....too many people...that means germs! \nI actually like Amadeus in Pasadena, CA better :)",UNK
5765,The barber is awesome at what he does and I will come back because of him but calling ahead is always a challenge I've tried 12 times over the last 3 hours and no answer......pretty ridiculous,UNK
5766,Love this place. We eat here here 3-5 times a month. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. They even took the time to talk to us about our special dietary needs and really fixed us up! Top notch from the food to the service to the atmosphere.,UNK
5767,Is this place someone's house?? This address took is into a neighborhood. I'm confused I can't give any stars really.,UNK
5768,"Had some really interesting dishes that were pretty good, and I really regret that we didn't order more mango w/ sticky rice for dessert. Gosh that was good. More later.",UNK
5769,Kenne das El Taquito schon Seit \u00fcber zehn Jahren. Es ist und bleibt der beste Mexikaner in der Gegend.,UNK
5770,"A pretty untypical spot for this neighborhood, but very welcomed. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable about the menu and the flavors.  Clean restaurant with colorful \""Austin\"" decor.  They slow cook their own beef and pork.  Very tasty!",UNK
5771,"First time here , Is very spacious, clean, services was great!!!\nThe Food was delicious I will be back for sure to try more... I will definitely  recommend to check it out...",UNK
5772,Recently used Lux Transportation while in town for Spring Training. They were very helpful in providing options for our logistics for the day. Friendly professional staff and great service! I would definitely recommend!,UNK
5773,"AWESOME dinner and service as usual at Bluewater Grill.  It is great to have fantastic service, food and atmosphere all in one. The Oyster bar is fantastic.",UNK
5774,"What more is there to say about Ikea? It's convenient and offers a ton of home deco ideas, which is really bad if you don't need anything :)\n\nThe food there is pretty good and inexpensive also.",UNK
5775,"I write this as I sit awaiting for my food.  I've been waiting for an hour now.  At a table with 10 other people, and the food is brought out 1 or 2 at a time.  This will be my last visit.",UNK
5776,Loved it!  I stopped in to check it out this week.  I felt very welcome and enjoyed my first Hot Yoga experience.  I hope to return soon!,UNK
5777,"Delightful!  Friendly staff who know their stock and appreciate fellow readers.  They invited us back to trade in our books on our next visit to Vegas.  We were able to fill in some holes in our collections and try out some new series.  This bookstore is well stocked with Sci/Fi, Horror and Mystery.",UNK
5778,"stopped here cause we had a gift card.  Next time, I'm giving the gift card away.  SLOWEST service ever!  Drive 5 more minutes & go to Grouchy Johns!!",UNK
5779,"Delicious dinner. Chilies rellenos with machaca. I'd never had that before & I loved every bite. My companion had delicious spinach enchiladas. Wish I lived in the area,  because I'd come back often for the food & friendly service.",UNK
5780,They charge an additional fee for credit cards AND DEBIT CARDS. That isn't cool. I really like the place and have been coming for years but didn't realize they were charging extra for debit cards. Uncool.,UNK
5781,"Still a decent stop anywhere for the whole coffe shop thing, but have been enjoying some of the other coffee shops in the area a bit more.",UNK
5782,"Got a case for my IPhone here that was usually $25, for @7.99..love a bargain !! And didn't have to even wait in line, hell yeah!",UNK
5783,Awesome! This is by far the best repair shop I have been to and I will not take anything any where else. They can repair anything and at a very reasonable price and with a very fast turn around!  I have brought Mike so many shoes in and he has made them all look brand new!,UNK
5784,"Ceaser seems to \""pick and choose\"" his clients.. So if you're not Cuban, this is not a place you wanna go.. Gets distracted by the tv... Seems to get annoyed if you ask for a hairstyle that isn't common and easy for him to do.",UNK
5785,Dinner was great. Service was exceptional. We lived in Vegas 37 years. We are Nov - May. This has become our favorite steak house,UNK
5786,"Atmosphere check... Service check... Pierogies excellent! Crostini with Goat Cheese and Pepper Jelly, excellent!  Waiting on my main dish, I'll let ya know... All smiles for now.....",UNK
5787,"I wholeheartedly agree with the 2 reviews before me, the staff here are insanely helpful, nice, and warm. I am in and out within 30 minutes for a regular dental appointment. Also they have a refrigerator full of free drinks!",UNK
5788,I did the detox sauna last week. I highly recommend it Kylee was awesome! She kept checking on me & gave me water and wiped down my forehead with a wash cloth. It was my first time and I was nervous They are all very knowledgeable\n . I will definitely go back.,UNK
5789,"So sad.  We live nearby and though we would throw some local business their way.  Wife is Thai and the food is bad.  It is edible but I can't tell if they are bad cooks or just adjusted so much for White folks that the food barely tastes like Thai food.  So, So sad.",UNK
5790,"Sushi is ok but rolls are small and service is really slow.  I ordered 3 rolls, it took 20 minutes to get the first one, and they served them one at a time. It wasn't crowded, I was the only one at the sushi bar.   Go to Ginbu 401 instead.",UNK
5791,Well they do deliver to your room!\nThey delivered a greasy sausage pizza with average fatty chicken wings and old fries. Edible though!!   Because it was all $14 I can't complain too much.,UNK
5792,"Extremely clean facilities. Management was seen doting on the facility's cleanliness and the patrons' well-being. Perhaps the tastiest Rubio's meal I've had, though I may have just been extra hungry. Basic shrimp taco is quite tasty.",UNK
5793,not really impressed.  We waited so long for our food.  I wish we went to Mimi's cafe located super close.  waste of time.,UNK
5794,The reason for five stars.....\n\nGreat service\nGreat prices \nSuper clean\nFood delicious\n\nIf I'm ever in the area I will for sure visit this place.,UNK
5795,Grapefruit served squeezed\nA very fluffy pancake\nWhat a great ham steak\n--\nQuality is guaranteed here.,UNK
5796,Music ok. Not what it used to be. Plus the dance floor is extremely sticky. Do they ever clean it? Feel like I am  at a bathhouse.  Cant move my feet.,UNK
5797,"We had great service on a Sunday night before going to Playboy Club.  My husband and I agree that this was the best Orange Chicken we've had in a long time-and we order it a lot!  We didn't get cocktails, and our bill was super reasonable for everything we ate-and I love the Buddha Bar music!",UNK
5798,"Pretty authentic Vietnamese place. Their pho is great and I'd go more often if there weren't other competing restaurants along the way that get my attention before getting to this one. If you're feeling like getting some good Vietnamese food around downtown, this probably is the place.",UNK
5799,Great place! We just discovered it and we are such big fans!! We love locally owned places that have great food and this place is exactly that! Right next door they have a cute ice cream shop called the Churn which is amazing! It's such a great hip place and great for date night!!,UNK
5800,Its definitely better than making my own sandwich...good soups that come in a bread bowl. Let's not get past the fact that its nothing fancy....average atmosphere with average service...I would recommend to anyone for a good sandwich and soup.,UNK
5801,"I tried this place based on other Yelp reviews and it did not disappoint. It's a family business with an excellent product, homemade gelato. The flavors are creative and the service is personalized. It's worth hunting for (very near the Stratosphere).",UNK
5802,Great service. Would definitely refer this contractor to others. Very professional and great work. Affordable and very friendly :) only person I will trust with my yard,UNK
5803,"That was a pretty outstanding Indian buffet. I'm not giving it a perfect five because it was a tad expensive and the quality of the chicken could've been better. The soups were superb. Nice attentive service is well. Garlic naan was a good choice, nice flavor.",UNK
5804,no matter what time you go to a trader joes there is always a pretty decent line to check out.  Just wish that the store had 2 more check out stands.,UNK
5805,Took this firm four tries to fix my air conditioner last July.  Wouldn't have cared except for the 115 degree temperatures at that time.  Would recommend avoiding this firm at all costs.,UNK
5806,"If you are going anywhere else - you are paying too much & not getting the service you deserve, these people do a great job.  Been coming here for years, if I have someting that needs a minor fix - they get it done, no charge - saves me time & hassle.  Thanks Park Ave - you rock.",UNK
5807,"Stayed 2 nights for spring training. Location is nice. Staff are super friendly, free breakfast and evening cocktails and snacks were nice. Unfortunately the non smoking room smelled gross, even after leaving the windows open for 2 days it still smelled gross. The carpets could do with cleaning.",UNK
5808,"I found this place while searching for Asian food on yelp. I absolutely LOVE this place! The food is excellent. I've tried at least 5 things I like here, which is very good considering I usually stick to one thing. I rave about their food to everyone I know. Nom nom nom mmmm",UNK
5809,Can't go wrong with soup if/when your drunk after a night at the club. A friend took me here once and I just could not believe the name. The pho is pretty good and their cooking time is pretty fast; but besides that the service was pretty horrible they practically forgot about us.,UNK
5810,It's good. It really is. But their vegetarian/pescatarian options  aren't great. In the end your enchilada is mushy with a weird menagerie of tastes. It's at least a one time visit.,UNK
5811,Prices are reasonable. Location hard to find unless you know where it is.  Food was typical bar fare.  When we went they were still finishing the build out so we hope things improve.,UNK
5812,"Had a great experience! Charlie did my nails, took his time , friendly, great job with the shaping and gel. Clean, lots of colors and cared about my business. I will be back!",UNK
5813,"I stopped here yesterday got the pineapple fresca, carne asada mini taco and a carne asada burrito. The good was fresh, delicious and I loved the mini taco. Tonight's? Nachos and watermelon fresca",UNK
5814,"good black currant lemonade (carbonated & sweet). the chicken strips weren't that good. fries looked good but were just average. The burger, however, was really juicy and tasty! fringe venue downstairs-sits quite a few people",UNK
5815,"Unfortunately, I didn't get to taste the food, as the overwhelming smell of sewage forced me to leave before I could order. We instead went next door to \""On the Grill\""",UNK
5816,Enjoyed a wonderful lunch at BC today. The food and service was wonderful. My guest who had never been there before could not stop commenting on how great the place was. It's always a joy to introduce people to a hidden gem like this.,UNK
5817,Really good breafast food items. Love the huevos rancheros and the gluten free pancakes. They even made my son a mickey mouse pancake. Its hard to find good gluten free food at restaurants.,UNK
5818,"Although there were open seats, the waiteress took forever to seat us. The table we sat at was not clean and the service was terrible",UNK
5819,It was okay. The guy behind the counter was rude when I asked to taste a few flavors. The ice cream was average. Nothing great and shiney about any of it. Eh,UNK
5820,This place is a rip off. I will never go back. They quoted me a price and I paid it. Now they are demanding more money.,UNK
5821,"I hate using the term local gem, but that's really what Frankies Tiki Room is. You will walk out smelling like a cigar, but the drink menu is fantastic and you can always find some great local characters at the bar.",UNK
5822,Lousy chicken wings. They were skinny flavorless and very greasy. Our stomachs were upset after the meal. We ordered d BBQ chicken pizza and it had NO hint of BBQ. Thanks for the groupon but we'd never go back there again.,UNK
5823,"Great place to grab dessert. Cookies are baked fresh, milkshakes are great, and a perfect location on Mill. Employees are always friendly.",UNK
5824,"DISCLAIMER: food is extra salty. \n7 of us ate here, all concur that the food is very salty! im appaled!",UNK
5825,Okay loved the French toast spin. Highly recommend. Wasn't a fan of their eggs Benedict version. It'd be a 3.5 for the food but 5 for  everything else!,UNK
5826,"Best freakin' cupcakes I've ever had!  An excellent selection of unique cupcakes, and really awesomely decorated cookies.  The Mufaleta sandwich is tasty as well.  The folks have always been pretty friendly.",UNK
5827,The sweetest staff who are completely professional and really take the time to make your nails perfect.  Shout out to Peter you are amazing!!,UNK
5828,"Found a worm when I ordered beef and broccolli. When I showed it to the server and told her that I wanted the pork chops instead, she wanted me to pay extra. I took photo of it. Not going back there anymore.",UNK
5829,I was so satisfied with their work . Not only was my car the shiniest I ever seen but they have great service overall . Love them they will be my go to detailers for as long as they want .,UNK
5830,I liked this better than Buffalo Wild Wings. I had the grilled chicken feather with Spicey Asian marinade. It was simply really good food . Great spot for lunch. Too bad the parking is limited.,UNK
5831,Had a very good time at this theater.  I visited while being a hotel guest at the Red Rock Hotel.  I loved the quality of the sound and the video of this theater and I appreciated the fact that it was not very crowded!,UNK
5832,The best food and huge portions. We even had a horrible server and the manager corrected it by sending us a gift card and apologizing. Always a very cool atmosphere.,UNK
5833,Not a fan of this Starbucks. Baristas are rude and stingy. There comfy chairs at this one which is nice but doesn't make up for the less than satisfactory service.,UNK
5834,We had our Christmas party at Revolution Alehouse. The appetizers were spectacular and the entr\u00e9es were wonderful. The service was great too .  We had a great time! I would recommend it to all.,UNK
5835,Found this place on Yelp. It filled me up but not w anything memorable. Chili was decent but very salty. Salad was ok. Was expensive for what I got. Friendly service. Near work so may be back if in a pinch. \n\nSeems to be there are many who rate mainly on quantity.,UNK
5836,"Decent food, overwhelmed staff, hip-ish vibe.  \n\nI'll admit I came with high expectations to Gallo Blanco given it's 4.5 star rating.  Unfortunately, we left underwhelmed. \n\nWe'll start with the good: it's located in t",UNK
5837,"Nuthin better after a few fun games of bowling down the street than a good Chinese meal at my favorite Chinese restaurant!   LOL  By the way, make sure to try their Chinese vegetables--they're authentic and delicious!",UNK
5838,"One of my favourite places to go for a quick bite to eat. They also make a large assortment of frozen pies which are great for taking home and eating later. I highly recommend this place. They have vegetarian pies and meat pies, and their desserts are also excellent.",UNK
5839,"Everything we've tried has been amazing, including the Blind Special. Friendly staff; great decor; one of our favorite places to brunch.",UNK
5840,Food is ok. Service is ok. Crab legs are just the same with crazy buffet. Dinner at 16/head adult. Quite pricey.,UNK
5841,"Really great neighborhood spot. Cool joint good home cooking food. Just get there early to get good seating or the pot of bread \""Yum\"" it gets pretty busy on the weekends! Must try plenary of options and ok price.",UNK
5842,"I always seem to end up here in Montreal, and I love it.  At the dirty far end of Ste. Catherine st. is this gem of a punk rock irish dive bar that serves chinese food.  Bizarre awesome.  I always fid new friends here and get ito adventures.",UNK
5843,This place was wonderful. There were four of us and everyone of our steak dinners were delcious! Place has a wonderful atmosphere! You definitely get what you pay for!,UNK
5844,Terrible food. I ordered a Buffalo Chicken wrap and they gave me lettuce and chicken and squirted some Buffalo sauce on it. Nothing that cannot be done at home in less than 5 mins. It's worse than subway and more expensive.,UNK
5845,"Went to check it out and it isn't there anymore.  There is another business in this location and I can't find if there is a new store.  Cherry on Top is the closest across from Red Rock station, and there is a U-Swirl and Yogurtland near Flamingo and Ft Apache.",UNK
5846,This place is awesome.  A true representation of an old Chicago style burger joint.  The food is great and service is good.  No complaints here.  The sliders are amazing and the dog is wonderful too.  You won' be disappointed with this place!,UNK
5847,Tried this place again for lunch during the week so I could order off the lunch menu and it was a better experieince. The Beef Bulgogi Bento Box was very good and the price was better than we paid eating here on a weekend.\n\nWill go again but only during the weekday lunch menu.,UNK
5848,I usually enjoy eating here. Tonight was suppose to be a special celebration dinner for my brother. Was sitting inside for 20 minutes (already had been seated) with my family and not one waiter came to our table.. inexcusable service. Especially when the restaurant is dead. We left.,UNK
5849,"THIS RESTAURANT IS CLOSED! The Pasta Shop took over the location, which is a huge upgrade.",UNK
5850,"I'm very glad I went off strip to this spa.  I wasn't that impressed with the decor, but the Pacific Paradise body scrub was great. My masseuse, Erica, gave an amazing deep tissue massage that was the perfect end to a busy weekend. I will definitely be returning!",UNK
5851,Loved the experience here.  Great location right next to the show we were going to.  Our server Karen was wonderful!  Food was very tasty!  It was fun to share the Frozen Hot chocolate with my sweetie!,UNK
5852,"I think their food is good and unique but they are WAY overpriced! And the smallest sub you can get is 8\"". I would like one half that size.",UNK
5853,"We came here after a movie next door. Took the young servers way too long to mix and serve ice cream. The ice cream is nothing to write home about and seem to be more expensive. With so many new and superior desert places around, don't think we will ever be back again for mediocre ice cream and slow service.",UNK
5854,"Prices are very reasonable, the staff are very nice, and kids can get their toes polished with a design for only $5! \n\nThey also play really good movies! Haha ... You never know what will be on when you pop in :)",UNK
5855,"Wow!\nReal good food at a real good price! \n(The buy 1 meal, get 1 free deal is awesome and has great choices)",UNK
5856,Always wanted to go to this show everytime I go to pick up my daughter in Vegas. Decided to go the other day when in Vegas to take the little one home. It was well worth the money! She had a blast &amp; thought it was neat being able to eat with her hands. Highly recommended!,UNK
5857,Had no idea they let blind people referee absolutely horrible reffing half the time they just talk to each other. And I'm not just being biased I know for sure they were bad refs because i myself clearly hit it out of bounds and they gave us possession of the ball.  Great place horrible refs.,UNK
5858,Below average food and service for the lunch buffet we tried.  I was hoping it would be good so i could enjoy some indian food closer to home but it wasn't good unfortunately.,UNK
5859,Great place if you're looking for over priced teriyaki entrees and crap service!! Waited almost 45 minutes for our meal on a Wednesday night with only 2 other tables occupied..very disappointing!!,UNK
5860,"Mon Ami Gabi is one of the few places in Vegas that I felt was good value for the price. I had breakfast here one morning and ordered the Blueberry French Toast, and I must say, it was delicious. Large slices of bread, fresh blueberries, whipped cream and blueberry syrup on top. Yum!",UNK
5861,This place is close to home however the customer service is horrible. And if you complain it only gets worse. They crank so many people through they don't care if you are happy. Some competition close by could make them reevaluate how they treat customers.,UNK
5862,Place looked appealing from the outside - Everyone was friendly - Service was fair - Food not the best - Seems like you get a lot of food but flavor was not there - Very Blah! - I'm not sure what to think about this place - May try it again but it wouldn't be my first choice.,UNK
5863,Mostly junk.  Shady sellers.  Overpriced ammo.  Less expensive at overpriced Cabela's.   Expensive to enter the event to look around.  Stay away.,UNK
5864,"This place is pretty good. Even though it is a fast food place, it doesn't taste like it. I couldn't believe how tender their steak was, and their miso soup was delicious. Everything is reasonably priced too. I will definitely be back!",UNK
5865,Had to drop off a Xbox to be shipped. Only one person working and long line. Felt bad for her. However her customer service skills were wearing down. Waited for about 30 minutes. Was hoping for a quick transaction with good customer service and got neither,UNK
5866,The food was ok but definitely not for the price. Extremely pricey. I ordered a Asian chicken salad with barely any chicken. Basically a $2 salad with 9x the price. Probably won't come back. Adjust the prices to reasonable prices and I may consider revisiting if I'm in the area.,UNK
5867,Hotel and casino were exceptionally clean. The room and views were great as well. Rooms were set up well to account for the views. The cost for the stay was very reasonable.,UNK
5868,The only reason I am giving this place 3 stars is because it's ideally located to people watch.\nThe drinks are okay too.\n\n\nThe service is downright pathetic.,UNK
5869,"Amazing Food, Great People. You will definitely enjoy your meal & your time here. You must try the carne asada, you'll enjoy every bite except the last (because that means it's all gone).",UNK
5870,Good luck trying to get a question answered by a pharmacist. My call was misdirected twice and when I finally did reach the pharmacy I was met with rudeness. I'll be taking my prescription elsewhere even though I live within blocks.,UNK
5871,Great food!  Anything you order you're going to be happy with.  While you're there have a drink and it makes for a good night.,UNK
5872,"Its OK, nothing special better than some other mom and pop places to eat. I would like to see more variety of food. I think Panda Express is a better quality, however if you want quick, nearby 51st Ave location, then I would prefer this based soley on location.",UNK
5873,"Exceptional service, creative and delicious menu choices, a fantastic wine menu with very knowledgeable staff. This restaurant is one of our favorite places. It's the type of place where everyone knows your name and remembers you and your favorite meal and wine choices.",UNK
5874,"Crappy Cleaners. I was very disappointed with the way my clothes came back. The shirt with pleats looked like they put it in the dryer, had to take it to a different place to get it done right .",UNK
5875,"uh, this place is HUGE\n\nAnd I met a SUPER hot guy here :)  I like this place!\n\n$4 pitchers of beers is nice too!\n\nNot big into country music personally, but the people were friendly here and I had a blast!",UNK
5876,My wife and I go for reflexology every year we come to the metro area. This place offers a good value for 2 people. the only thing that was different at Oriental Foot Spa was the masseuses would leave for several minutes between transitioning from your body massage to your foot massage. Kind of stops the flow that you want from a massage.,UNK
5877,"Taste a little like out of a box.  Sorry, just felt unimpressed and peeved that I bought this.  I'll continue on with my cupcake quest.",UNK
5878,From the looks of pics here this place must have been renovated. Slice of pepp and cheese was pretty good for a chain. My wife had the pepp boli and it seemed to me there wasn't enough cheese. There was plenty of staff on hand to move things along.,UNK
5879,"Fish tacos were bland and boring, but the guacamole and grilled romaine were very good! Wish it was warmer so we could have enjoyed the outdoor patio.",UNK
5880,"I took this cab service yesterday from my hotel to the Airport. The cab seemed a little old but was alright. The driver seemed liked a nice guy, but didn't really talk until I started a conversation.",UNK
5881,24 hr magic land.\n\norder the CHINA BURRITO with cheese... heaven. Fast service and it's so damn cheap!!!!!,UNK
5882,"I initially liked Tere's in the beginning, however, recently when I schedule any appointment with a specific nail tech it is always someone else I don't know. This has become more and more frequent. I hope I can change this behavior or I will look for a new place.",UNK
5883,"I have been to this particular McDonald's location twice now. Each time they have forgotten to give me my sauce for my McNuggets. Of course this was after I left that I noticed, and eating nuggets without any sauce just isn't the same.",UNK
5884,Everything we had was very well done. Very good fresh pasta. And the salads are excellent. Very friendly staff and great service. It is a very small restaurant (super cozy!) so be prepared for that.  Also no liquor for sale but it is bring your own wine!,UNK
5885,"Horrible horrible horrible. Ordered a couple of racks of ribs and took them home. Ribs were dry, sauce didn't even help them. Called to complain and was told there was no way the ribs were that bad.No offer to replace, was told to go elsewhere. Avoid this place.",UNK
5886,I've been there a couple of times. The service is good...the food is marginal...but what turned me off is when I saw this old guy drooling as he walked toward the food. I'll never be back!,UNK
5887,We wanted to try the polanisian buffet  there were a few good options but overall your typical buffet joint.One positive was that we got 2 buffets for free after signing up a players card.It will be a long time before I go to a buffet joint again!,UNK
5888,"This place is a freaking joke. Expect an overcrowded waiting room and at minimum an hour wait. They see children but there is nothing in the waiting room to entertain them so they are all screaming and crying. There's not even room for a stroller. Horrible, horrible experience!",UNK
5889,"Seems like a legit place, but it was expensive. The lady working there was nice enough, and my dad had ordered my daughter flowers for her birthday via the phone. They made it up and it was really nice, but $100 for a vase with flowers and cake pops seemed like a lot of money.",UNK
5890,"I have been here a few times now and I don't know how anyone could give more than one star.  The hot dogs are about as far from a Chicago dog as you can get, more to it than neon green relish, real Vienna beef would be nice.",UNK
5891,Overrated.   Plus they are so full of it that they don't think they need a sign on Chandler Avenue.  And because if no sign I forget its tucked away in the corner.    Anyways been there twice in the last 6 months and not impressed - more of a novelty for me than anything.,UNK
5892,"I've never been to the original in Miami but this one is definitely superb. The stone crab and king crab legs are delicious! This is a perfect spot for a great family meal, i think the next time I have parents in town, we will definitely want to take them here!",UNK
5893,Currently taking lessons from Nick O. And having a blast learning how to play guitar. Nick is great at determining how well I've progressed through the week and through practice. Very talented guitarist and very skilled instructor.,UNK
5894,"This is it.  Go here when you are in Madison.  The burgers are good, but its the fried food with their GARLIC DIP  that is the best part.  Cheese Curds are a requirement or you didn't actually go to DDD.",UNK
5895,"Very reasonably priced, friendly and fast. And the closest tasting to a \""New York bagel\"" that I've found in Arizona. Glad I live so close!",UNK
5896,"Great rates, friendly staff, clean room, spacious bathroom!  A bit noisy when folks arrived late at night and from the train horn in the morning and the bed is a bit too soft for my tastes.  I'd stay again if needed.",UNK
5897,Lucas from Proper guard came in to do install for my business. It took 40 minutes to do full instillation. Works flawlessly. We have already been attempted to break in and proper guard had contacted the authority for us super fast.,UNK
5898,Never a dull time at the DD. Never a cover. Favorite night is Tuesday nights. Punk Rock bingo is always a good time.,UNK
5899,"I don't know what people are buying here but the lines are always crazy long. I've found name brand clothes for cheaper where they originally sell their stuff at. A huge disappointment, skip it.",UNK
5900,What an amazing place finally came to the McCormick Ranch area of Scottsdale.\nGrassroots has an excellent menu of great dishes at reasonable prices. Great friendly atmosphere and terrific Happy Hour seven days a week. You can't go wrong with this choice.,UNK
5901,"the set up was pretty but watching tv without sound sucks. the lounge decoration was gorgeous. there is nothing to do here for nonsmokers. all the action is on the hopeless,lung cancer smokers at aria hotel",UNK
5902,"This place was awful! Food was horrible! The only thing good were the drinks, which we had to order to get the taste out of our mouths! Go to Tacos and Tequila if you want some Mexican Food.",UNK
5903,These guys know their beef!! Never had a better day at the butcher than I have here at The Butcher Block! Their deli sandwiches are DELISH and easy to pick up on the way out to mountains or the lake. Love it here!,UNK
5904,"Since ditching the pirate theme, TI is hotel with identity crisis.  Not impressed with the room which had broken fixtures & loud A/C.  spa is a joke which have to pay $17 extra.  Only plus is good location.  Stay at Rio for $50 Less and much better room",UNK
5905,This is the best bike shop hands down in the Phoenix area.  They are professional and I always get great customer service.  They stick to their word even when things come out slightly more expensive than they said.  They never pressure you.,UNK
5906,really good buffet. alot to choose from. our waitress was really attentive and taking good care of us. i will return next time i come to vegas!,UNK
5907,Great laid back place for lunch or a light dinner.  Their chicken pesto sandwich was excellent and love their hummus.  Perfectly fits in with the arts scene on Roosevelt.,UNK
5908,Love the store.  But the parking is a nightmare (but that is the fault of the patrons with more money than brains who can't drive or park there cars).,UNK
5909,"Always a great time a Tao.\nIt does get crowded sometimes, but i've never had a bad time there. It's my go-to club, plus the food at the restaurant is pretty good too",UNK
5910,Came here for happy hour during our recent trip to Vegas. They had a 2 for 1 special on mojitos and I must say they were pretty good. I also had a few appetizers but they weren't anything special. I would come back here for some drinks.,UNK
5911,When trying to think of where to go for a steak dinner The Greentree Inn came to mind. I had never been here in all the years of living so very close. I was glad I chose this establishment. Food was excellent and I loved the feel of the place,UNK
5912,Bad customer service. So ghetto. They have sorry ass set up here. Nobody can help you to find what you need. The cashiers look mad that you are shopping there. I really just don't like this frys. Never again.,UNK
5913,"I gave up on Monterrey several yrs ago but was in the neighborhood today. I felt like Mexican for lunch. Clean, great service and the food was very good. One of the best quesadillas I've had. And the Dos Equis draft wasn't bad either!",UNK
5914,"Super friendly! Went here to buy paint and magnets for my classroom.  There were lots of color options and many different shapes and strengths of magnets.  Also, if you are in the market for some good people watching, this place delivers!",UNK
5915,First time for us. Raves on chips & salsa were correct.  Wife tried tortilla soup then ordered seconds for tomorrow's lunch. Seafood enchiladas were top notch  as was chicken fajitas.  We'll be back..,UNK
5916,"Food is good, alot to choose from. Servings are really big. The place was on tv so it's usually crowded. Close to my house.",UNK
5917,"It could be nice, but it just wasnt.  The room tried to be modern, but it was cheesy.  The shower was open and built terribly, the room was small and the decorations seemed cheap. The only plus side is its location.",UNK
5918,"Coffee that will seduce you into a false sense of security and then elope with your taste buds. From specialty brews to the standard drip, good coffee all around. If you're into great coffee I'd recommend forking a buck for a specialty brew.",UNK
5919,"Absolutely scrumptious tonkatsu and a very unique grind your own sesame seeds fresh to make a fabulous dipping sauce experience. \n\nBasically, the food is delicious. If you try this restaurant out, you'll have a very enjoyable experience.",UNK
5920,"Completely fabulous ambiance. On the expensive side but worth it because the food is phenomenal and the service is awesome. Live music one night and it felt like a\nConcert, completely awesome talent. Very chic and food is perfect.",UNK
5921,The brothers run a nice UPS Store. Both are friendly and knowledgeable and will provide you competitors' rates -- which is something other UPS Stores don't do because they want your $$$. I highly recommend this store if you're on the East side.,UNK
5922,"Some the best Indian food in the valley. I am reluctant to give five star on any place, always being the explorer, but I would go 4 1/2 because there is not damn TV and the atmosphere is excellent",UNK
5923,"Never again!  Horrible work, went in for a quick manicure ($15) on Sunday, by Monday it was chipping.  Tech only spent like 5 mins on my nails before painting. Waste of money!\n\nPs. Only cash for tips",UNK
5924,A shady place. I went on a Saturday night and the place was empty. The food was horrible. I will not be going again nor do I recommend others to try... The dhaba down the street is much better.,UNK
5925,Terrible customer service-even witnessed rudeness to a woman in a wheel chair. We ordered one thing-bucket of GRILLED chicken. They gave us fried.   Little wonder why Chick Fil A dominates.   AVOID,UNK
5926,"Solid burgers here. Perhaps not a pinnacle of medium rare glory, but the taste is right and portions are filling. I'd opt for the sweet chili sauce as an extra topping; it combines with the default sauce in weird and interesting ways!",UNK
5927,"Tasty fries. Very bad cheeseburger. Claimed to be charbroiled, no charbroil flavor at all, no char marks on meat.  Meat had a livery, gamey flavor, and was dry. Took two bites and threw it out.",UNK
5928,Totally delicious pho in a very informal atmosphere. The combination spring roll was very good. Prices are excellent! I would go back!,UNK
5929,Pretty good. Attentive service and friendly staff. Food is good. But this is my fallback... only if I cant make it to Thai Taste on West Blvd. Great lunch prices.,UNK
5930,"Visit here several times a year. The food is always fresh and well stocked. They have sushi, and several seafood items for their dinner buffet. The staff is always efficient as well.",UNK
5931,"I was here about four years ago when a tall skinny man working there just blew up and started screaming at a customer.  I have no idea what happened, but it was one of the most terrifying bagel-related experiences of my life.",UNK
5932,Custom calzone was amazing... Great mozz sticks and chicken wings very good.  Got delivery to a local hotel. Fast fresh and awesome!!   Get a calzone w ricotta mozz parm salami and sausage. Unfknbelievable!!,UNK
5933,"The burger, pretzels, and brats are soo delicious! I love this place, the atmosphere is so fun and laid back. The have a bunch of games to play too.",UNK
5934,MMMMmmm good.  I enjoy their food and really like the salads. It is a fun place to pop in for a lunch.  I can go light or heavy with a meal and get a enjoyable glass of wine to go with it.,UNK
5935,"A friend and I decided to check this place out on Saturday afternoon, and all of the doors were locked. We were really excited to check it out! I'm not sure if it's even open for business. If it is, they need some store hours posted outside.",UNK
5936,"Best Cirque show I've seen yet. If you go get there early, the MC does many funny things with the crowd as they are being shown to their seats. The people that are picked to interact with the show are also picked from those that are early. Great show would see again.",UNK
5937,"Nice atmosphere, friendly and EXTREMELY fast service.  Sadly, I've gotten better food at a drive-thru.",UNK
5938,"Great job to the nail tech!!! She took her time and have attention to detail, which was very appreciated.   Great atmosphere, free hot stone massage, great prices.",UNK
5939,"It is a beautiful resort, with classy decor and relaxing music playing throughout, none of that cheesy pop music or rock they play at a lot of casinos at 7am when you just want to enjoy a glass of Merlot and feel like a high roller.",UNK
5940,Soooooo good!! The wait was a little long but well worth it!! 2 tacos and a mini quesadillas for under 5 bucks... I wish they would increase their hours though...,UNK
5941,If you can somehow overlook the price..\nJust know its worth it. Everything I tried was good!! Out of all the things my fav was the Thai basil rice with egg. Lol I'm Asian what can you say..,UNK
5942,"My orange chicken was dry like it had been sitting there for a while. My noodles were almost cold. Never going back. Yuck, I wish I had gone to firehouse subs instead.",UNK
5943,"Nice neat looking place with friendly staff. Food not great- steak and chicken had lower quality taste..  Not good texture. Cheese was typical shredded white non- Mexican type... For delicious authentic tacos, try shrimp at Sabor, or pork and more at Tres Amigos...",UNK
5944,Some of the sushi were ok... But the overall food was nasty :(\nSmoked salmon smelled fishy and chicken tasted almost out of date\nFried calamari and sushi were burned \nYou dont even get unlimited ice cream :/ \nNever coming back.,UNK
5945,"Simply put this place is outstanding.  Great food, great guys that run it, decent atmosphere if you eat in and always fast if you're getting take out.  Love it.",UNK
5946,I am very pleased to see more and more different places for me to choose from in my neighborhood. \n\nI love Popeyes and my favorite would have to be the spicy chicken and mashed potato & gravy.\n\nThe employees were super friendly and the place was very clean!,UNK
5947,The hot dogs here are always scrumptious and the fries aren't too shabby either. The chocolate shake however is soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo good. It is the best hot dog place in the Biltmore area hands down.,UNK
5948,"Okay so this place is a BINGO. Quick, interesting, relatively healthy meals! Awesome shakes and smoothie options. Price is decent, only downside is it is a bit small so lunch/dinner rush time can be a bit troublesome. Get the Neato Burrito!",UNK
5949,First eating here\nReese the bartender was really cool\nI loved the food\nHad steak and eggs\nI definitely will come back,UNK
5950,Price is just a $1 or $2 more than the regular cinemas but it's super worth it. Just make sure you buy the tickets and reserve your seats online 'cause they are limited.,UNK
5951,"Please pay attention when they make ur smoothies. they add hand sink tap water to the smoothies. When I ask why used in tap water. Their response were \""it's just water~\"" \n\nAt least use filter water...",UNK
5952,"I'll admit, there isn't much to choose from in terms of Indian in Phoenix.  The prices are reasonable here, but it makes me yearn for good Indian food.  This just isn't that.",UNK
5953,Good bang for your buck if you are staying in the hotel! The crust has a nice garlic flavor and the pizza was really fresh and hot,UNK
5954,Fish tacos wrapped in flour tortilla and sauce were terrible.   The volume on the TV was obnoxiously too loud.  There were 8 of us and you could only hear the person next to you.  Price for a pitcher of beer was reasonable.,UNK
5955,It was probably the worst Sushi place we had. The rolls where not rolled they fell apart .They did not have a lot of selections on rolls. No interactions with the  Sushi Chef. Way over priced. Would not recommend.,UNK
5956,"The show is just ok, the kids like it.     I have no idea why this place usually has a wait.\n\nThe food is overpriced for the quality.\nEverything just tastes like soy sauce.",UNK
5957,Big disappointment!  Have been there a few times and the service has been horrible.  I actually took a survey with corporate and the franchise owner called me and promised to make it right by sending some coupons.  He never sent them which just underscored to me how bad the service is at Smashburger.,UNK
5958,4 stars for the Tiger Shrimp and Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale.  Good but I didnt wow me.\n\n5 stars for the honey glazed salmon.  Best Salmon I had so far.  It was cooked perfectly!!!!,UNK
5959,"Awesome lunch deals! \nWaiters are SUPERB!!!!!\nfood fast, fresh and fantastic!\nits a hidden gem!!!",UNK
5960,Amazing sushi and great staff! I can not wait to go again. My 5 year old son loved everything we ordered and the sushi was fresh and delicious. I recommend this restaurant to anyone in the area!!,UNK
5961,Got a call from the General Manager John who was very nice and assured me they are not a homeless shelter. Perhaps I will go back and try them again.,UNK
5962,"just finishing up with a cabinet job. Dan and Chris were awesome, actually both showing up to do the initial meeting and to do the work. The finished result is awesome. We went from all white to walnut. Couldn't be happier. Thanks Dan and Chris!  Dave and Jan",UNK
5963,"Yes, Julia T's review may be boring.  But, it didn't stop me from heading over to someburros.  Good thing!  She was spot on!  \n\nNothing more I can say above what J said... Take a look at her review!",UNK
5964,"Out of all the Buffet in Las Vegas Cosmo had it all on their plates.. likewise, wayne had it all too. lol",UNK
5965,Authentic & formal dining but not strict dress code.  Aloo gobi was great & very hot. Great waitstaff.,UNK
5966,"They have a really great Sunday brunch with wonderful tasting food, and all you can drink mimosa's or bloody mary's. The atmosphere is laid back with board games and a pool table upstairs, however the service has been absolutely horrible. If Republic Kitchen fails this will be the reason.",UNK
5967,I like the atmosphere especially on the patio. It has semi-good rolls and staff is always friendly. The best part about this place is the good pours on the drinks. If you are unsure about what to order the staff is always able to recommend their favorite rolls or entree!\nPriced average for two!,UNK
5968,worst customer service I experience in a long time. The owner is a jerk. He uses the excuse that he's from Boston. I've been to Boston and people are very kind of open back there.\npizza was average at best. the pizza was burnt around the good part of the pizza.,UNK
5969,Only tried the hoagies because that's what we were able to afford that night but they were delicious. Can not complain there. The service was good but has room for improvement.,UNK
5970,Such a great vibe here!! Love the space. Good music. Warm people. Challenging classes. Mindful thoughts to take with you for later.,UNK
5971,I STILL LOVE YOU!  Even on a Sunday night this place makes my fat jiggle.  Best club in the veGAS.\n\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__2ABJjxzNo,UNK
5972,"Good for eat-in or takeout.  Fresh tasting fish, great presentation and friendly service.   A lot of other comments use the Wisconsin qualifier with Takara, but honestly in it's price range I think Takara could compete in larger cities like NYC.",UNK
5973,"Their pizza is slightly better than the stuff you get in the freezer section at Walmart. Wouldnt go back without a coupon. Did like the flavored crust, kinda neat that you can choose. Not worth the price, order dominos.",UNK
5974,"I have been to turn style a few times, and just feel like I can never find anything I really like here.  I have found a few cute kids clothes, but over all not impressed.",UNK
5975,I had fun when i went to this club last year!  Didn't have to wait in line at all.... fun times!,UNK
5976,"I setup an appointment for a non emergency repair. The appointment time came and went and no one showed up or called. I left a couple of messages stating if he had an emergency that was fine but please give me an ETA. No call back, no show.",UNK
5977,"This is a great spot for Vegas breakfast, which occurs around Noon, maybe 1pm. Coffee and some booze, a reasonably priced steak, and some delicious baked cheese.\n\nAlways a standard for our Vegas trips",UNK
5978,I ordered sweet and sour chicken along with sasame chicken to go. . The food was alright but nothing to brag about.\nThe crab puffs were pretty good. Spent over $33 for those three items. I expected more for the price.,UNK
5979,I hated the fact the texture of the gelato was so sticky and thick. I felt naucious and got a stomach ache from it. I feel like they put way too much sugar in their icecream creating such inconsistent texture. I'm going to baskin Robbins next time.,UNK
5980,"It's a cafe, it's in the Cortez. Average food, average service. Be prepared to wait awhile for your food. The breakfast is decent, diner style food.",UNK
5981,"Went for Labor Day weekend... and it was a great place to stay. No crazy.. check-ins or check-outs.  Spacious room, kitchens had all we needed. Parking is close convenient.",UNK
5982,So good! I come here whenever I can. I usually get chicken and cheese quesadilla. I will soon venture out and try something else! I could probably eat their chips and salsa everyday. The employees are very nice and welcoming also! Great service!,UNK
5983,I was pretty disappointed to find out that they do not carry any type of yard art or Talavera pottery... \nI'm always looking to add a little something.,UNK
5984,I love Bambino's. It is within walking distance from my place and they have a great $16 special-lg cheese pizza and wings. \n\nIt's not world's greatest pizza ever but it definitely gets the job done.Check them out.,UNK
5985,"The menu very Cali, get the California benedict- delicious and filling without the total guilt factor.  Owner came over to greet us, chatted for a bit and staff very friendly.  Discovered this place today via Yelp and can't thank you enough, look forward to becoming a regular.",UNK
5986,"I'm always in search of great coffee and this place has great coffee. It's a little place and if you blink, you might just miss it! The staff was knowledgable on their coffee and equipment.  It reminds me of the type of place you would find in Downtown Phoenix, but instead it's in Scottsdale.",UNK
5987,Always a good choice. Service is VERY slow but the corn chowder makes up for it. Good menu choices and staff seems to always be friendly. They also have good breads and muffins. Good place for any of the 3 meals.,UNK
5988,This place sucks for takeout.  This is the second time I have gotten to the restaurant and waited 30 min after calling the order in.  Never again.,UNK
5989,This is a great course. The fairways were green and very nicely manicured. However they are narrow and challenging! The staff is great and go out of their way to help you. I recommend this course to everyone.,UNK
5990,Great place! The interior is really causy and nice looking. It's the sort of place where you could spend hours talking and not noticing it. The staff is really nice and you can also go there to eat. You have a good selection of alcohols.,UNK
5991,"I have been here four or five times and it is the best high volume blowout I have had! My hair is very fine and they work miracles with volume that lasts for days.  Everyone is super friendly, professional and knowledgable, and the prices are so reasonable. Check it out! 5 stars for sure!",UNK
5992,Very disappointing to read such great reviews but experience such poor communication from Troy.  He returned one of several calls but did not call back again as promised to schedule an appointment.  Have left two messages since without reply.  Finally gave up and moved on to another handyman.,UNK
5993,Garbage...I would rate food 3 but service brought it down to one....Garbage...go to suri ayce...rate Suri 3 but service brings in to 4,UNK
5994,"Lovey food here and not as busy as Gordon Ramsay's burger joint. The fish and chips are fantastic and I highly recommend them. The steak ale mini pie was better then the larger version. Salmon was good, but not my favorite.",UNK
5995,Would have rated a 0 star but could not... Pathetic course conditions... Its April for petes sake... The staff was very rude and inconsiderate... No water at all in ball washers or even the ball washer on the cart... Will not recommend or play this course again...,UNK
5996,The photo I added explains it all. Poor service from a semi drunk bartender. Don't ask for a Manhattan unless you want grenadine and Jamison.,UNK
5997,Probably one of the worst Indian  food I have ever had in USA. Went there for Sunday buffet and the food was terrible. Serving is bad and avoid this restaurant.,UNK
5998,"Hotel was clean. Breakfast in the morning (cereal, eggs, sausage, bacon, waffles etc) Room was pretty big and clean. Only thing our sink kept clogging but they sent someone to fix it. Would stay again",UNK
5999,"Not too many tables, coffee is good of course.  Baristas know what they are doing and how to make a special request.  Very busy place because of the location.  Seating outside.  Drive-thur available.",UNK
6000,Seriously why are you here looking at the reviews and not there eating? Go.. now .. do not turn around and dont look for other places.. just go.,UNK
6001,"If you're staying at the JW Marriott, it's easy walking distance from the hotel for supplies for your stay, of both a food and beverage nature.  The separated liquor store has a decent selection of beer and wine, but it would have been nice to see a few higher quality Magnums of wine.",UNK
6002,"Great food, super quick service with a smile. Hard to beat their prices, especially the lunch specials! We've eaten here a dozen times this year and have been impressed with the food and speed of service each visit. Highly recommend you give them a try (especially for a quick lunch)!",UNK
6003,"Small Indian takeout spot in Latta Arcade with pretty good food, although my veggie entree was a bit watery.  The naan was fresh which is always important.  I'll probably go back and try something different just to make sure they're legit.",UNK
6004,"Overall Good Airport, lots of selections of restaurants.  Make sure you that you are in terminal d though because everything else is a bit old.  Also quick note, if you are connecting between A Gates and D Gates you have to leave the secured area! So you better be prepared to do an OJ through the airport if you have a tight connection!",UNK
6005,Love Elaine and her work! One of my first  and favorite stops when I head in to Vegas is with Elaine. She does my cousins nails. I have always been jealous of her fantastic nails! I live in El Paso Texas and am still looking for someone at home that can  compare to the talent Elaine has in her one pinky.,UNK
6006,Windy City Beefs-N-Dogs has the best dogs in town. The service is down home because the owners actually work the business which is hard to find these days! For an authentic Chicago Dog try Windy City I KNOW you'll love it.,UNK
6007,They left the carpets soaked and even though I paid extra for pet treatment it still stunk like pet waste.  They also didn't put any material to block the moisture in the carpet from ruining the wood legs and bases of the furniture.,UNK
6008,Me and my husband went there for a SIMPLE order... and tried and tried to explain to the cashier what we wanted about 5 times she still messed it up... ugh!! No bueno!,UNK
6009,Yum! Yogurtini is delicious! I like the suggested mixes on the board. I do not like the line of contemplating customers who feel the need to sample every single flavor but that comes with the territory when you frequent yogurt shops. I love the mint flavor with some dark chocolate chips and andes mint bits.,UNK
6010,"Ordered beef enchiladas, never had them with bell peppers and onions before.  Pretty nasty tasting.  Will not go back",UNK
6011,"Lots of really neat, unique stuff - but I kind of expected more.  Interesting location and good space and layout.  I've definitely bought a few cards there!",UNK
6012,"A Madison staple! Beer brewed on site, a large menu of of a mix of traditional pub fare and American. Sometimes the wait gets long as it is one of the more popular restaurants in town, but it is worth every minute!",UNK
6013,"Pretty good... Not as good as \""Wahoos\"" in California. Very friendly staff, fresh food. Awesome clam strips.",UNK
6014,This is my sbsolute favorite restaurant!  Their chips and salsa is incredible. I recommend requesting the smooth salsa and mixing it with their ranch. The salad and soup are both crazy good. I have never had anything that I did not love at this restraunt.,UNK
6015,"Outstanding service, Bing was amazingly sweet and a smiley face.  Our waiter, Alfonso,  was very humble and knowledgeable with menu ask for his table a great experience, thank you",UNK
6016,Great! You'll eat until you hurt. We go out of our way to eat here each time we are in Vegas. Get Ruben and chicken noodle soup.,UNK
6017,This is the slowest Starbucks drivethru ever. I don't know what they are doing differently than every other sbux but it's killing me. The coffee and food are always good but it takes forever.,UNK
6018,"Been here several times and it's a solid sports bar with good bar food.  Service is good and the staff is friendly.  Great place to catch a game on their many large screen TV's.  Close to work, so it's convenient and close.",UNK
6019,Someburros is Amazing if you are ever in a hurry and want fast but delicious and authentic Mexican food then look no further! The pollo fundido is huge and delicious the carne asada very authentic and the chorrizo is my personal favorite you can get it in almost anything!,UNK
6020,"Big Lots has anything you could need for your house at  discounted price. Indoor, outdoor, items for the kitchen, decor, it has it all. I often come here around the holidays to see what they have in stock. Not as well ranged as other stores, but if you are patient there are some decent finds.",UNK
6021,Ordered a few meal we where the only ones ordering food. The guy had to be reminded twice for my daughter shake which she never got til she was done eating cause he was too busy playing around with his co workers,UNK
6022,Found hair in my food and they didn't apologize or discount the meal... they just looked at me & said thats not hair... but then after examining it closer they said yeah its hair then took the plate. Unsanitary! No customer service!,UNK
6023,I am severly disappointed in the class and dishonesty of the staff. I regrettably forgot to grab my sunglasses off of my table after having a great dining experience with a dear friend. There is no where they could have gone but in an employee's possession. For this reason I will never recommend or repeat a visit to this establishment.,UNK
6024,"Watch it at night while you are strolling around the strip, the light makes it even more amazing. Free show but it so much more. It is like a ten minute water show choreographed with music. A must see when you are in vegas. Day or night!",UNK
6025,Best Mexican I have ever had short of mi abuela's food! :) and the staff is amazing! I love Mexican and I'm a tough critic so this is really a great place you must experience! Looks like fast food from the outside so I was skeptical but it is worth coming in!,UNK
6026,"Awesome, awesome, awesome! In & out in just under an hour (1st thing Sat morn). Kind & caring staff. Way faster than my PCP!",UNK
6027,"Waited in line for an hour. Then another 15-20 after placing order for 1 cookie and a red velvet cupcake. Cookie was average, cupcake was dry and bland. Lots of hype but did not deliver for us.",UNK
6028,Always very consistent Chinese food. A great variety of choices and all very good. I had the ginger lobster stir fried and it was good!  Had a very nice waiter and enjoyed my lunch very much. Moderately priced and a good bet when friends arrive from out of town. Great for groups.,UNK
6029,"First time customers. We were attracted by the patio and stopped for a late lunch. Food was very good. Not cheap but comparable and relevant to excellent location on Strip. Overall service was excellent and staff very friendly including Our hostess Elizabeth but especially our server, Andy!",UNK
6030,"What a ripoff! I got a crab soup togo, it was maybe 8 oz, the cup was not even filled up for $7. And, it was not very tasty, not even close to what I expected. The deli 100 ft down the concourse is priced at $4,  I'll go there from now on.",UNK
6031,"Price is a little bit on the high side, but the service is fast. I called them and they came within 2 days, and took about 15 minutes to replace my shower thread. Simple and fast service",UNK
6032,"Just moved here from Newport Beach and was wondering if I could find good Pho here because SoCal has some of the best. Well Jimmy (owner) is from Huntington Beach and he brought great Pho to Az. Thank you Jimmy, it was delicious!",UNK
6033,This place is amazing. Really only good public driving range. And they actually have a restaurant that serves great food. Gotta try one of there burgers. Jacob,UNK
6034,Top of heap for Madison restaurants.  Cocktails were fresh and innovative and food followed suit.  Rivals great restaurants in Chicago.  Interior designer should be shot though - eclectic design that's incredibly confused and close to distasteful.,UNK
6035,"Of course I'm a fan, it's become a bit pricier since I first came so we'll keep an out eye for the others around the area, especially when they're really busy.\n\nGreat variety, quick service and can't go wrong after a long night/morning on the strip.",UNK
6036,Saw this place on Man vs Food and had to try it.  It was great!  Crawfish and shrimp were excellent and the Cajun Fries were terrific too!  Service great also.,UNK
6037,Terrible service.  A very simple 3 item order had to be repeated 4 times and they still got it wrong.  And it took 20 minutes to get the food.  Never again.  The prices are high.,UNK
6038,This place isn't classy and has a Ross in it for crying out loud!! But...I am en love with Fredrick's of Hollywood!!! You won't find a Nordstrom in this mall.,UNK
6039,"Come to PT noodles if you are looking for an exotic experience. The menu is difficult to decipher. And the pronunciations of the Vietnamese words... forget about it. The food, well let's just say it's an exotic experience.",UNK
6040,Do not wash your car at this place. The owner Matt never answers his phone or returns calls.  He also will over charge your credit card and not make it right. This place is no good be warned.,UNK
6041,Good food they could get better on their service. took away a star because they forgot two items in my order so i didn't have fires or my cookie.,UNK
6042,Enjoyed great service and a delicious meal last evening. I was in the mood for egg drop soup and Mongolian beef. This was the best Mongolian beef i've ever had!  A nice cold Sapporo made it a perfect meal!,UNK
6043,"Came here to enjoy drinks and food... Nope ! Shit came out fucked up mayonnaise was so nasty it had to be at least 2 months expired!! So gross. Server was super nice and apologetic, manager had no nerve to talk w us.. Won't be back.",UNK
6044,"$50 breakfast for two. \n\nAverage food at best. Not worth the price, and the prices aren't even that high. \n\nHorrible service. \n\nNice decor, clean tables and good overall cleanliness.",UNK
6045,"This paddle sport supply store is stocked to the rafters with a staggering selection of everything you could possibly ever need to get your crazy paddle on.  Owners, Jeff and Darren, are friendly and quick to answer even silly newbie questions.",UNK
6046,"Have been to red devil on a number of occasions and have enjoyed each visit. If you are not a fan of waiting for a table or waiting for a while on your food, don't stop by Friday nights. The place is packed. It you like white pizza, this place is worth the stop.",UNK
6047,This is located in the Cosmopolitan Hotel on the strip.  You can go casual with pizzas and appetizers or for a full dinner with excellent pastas and steaks.  The desserts are amazing.  You have to try the SALTED CARAMEL BUDINO (pretzel toffee),UNK
6048,The worst customer service in Las Vegas.  My party was told 20 minutes for a table.  We waited 45 minutes without being called and watched groups that came after us get seated and groups come straight off the street and get seated before us.  I advise all not to try this!  We went to Serendipity 3 and had a great time!,UNK
6049,"I found these kebabs a little bit too seasoned. They were \""just ok\"". It wouldnt be my first choice in Montreal. \n\nThe waitress was very rude also.",UNK
6050,"Very nice cheap quick bus service to airport. (28X).  but i think i've found out what happens to all the old buses in Seattle, they are shipped to Pittsburgh, old polluting diesel buses seem to be the norm.\n\nthey also run the inclines, which are pretty cool if not old.",UNK
6051,"Fun place for hanging out with friends.  Excellent live music.  \nThe down side. $85 for a small bottle of verve clicquot.  And to top it off it wasn't even cold, 2nd cheap wine glasses for top prices on wine.  Manager rude.  From now on, I'll bring my own liquor.",UNK
6052,I love this place! I'm very picky about my sweets and they have the best treats. Brooke and Jade are so great too. Thank you for always making my day ladies!,UNK
6053,Not the best cupcake I've had. Cake is often dry and too much frosting is put on top. They taste pretty much like something you can buy at the Super Market. They do have a decent selection of flavors but that's about the only positive.,UNK
6054,It wasn't what I expected going in but I had fun.  An hour is more than enough...especially for someone that NEVER works out!  WHEW!,UNK
6055,Best cheese curds in Madison! Service is generally not very good they can be slow and don't seem to care if you need anything after food is dropped off.  Prices are a little high for bar food.  But poor service and slightly high prices wont keep me from going back for curds.,UNK
6056,this is a good place to get stuff like toys leashes and collars. they are more affordable than your small mom and pop shops. as far as dog food goes you are better off going to wag n wash they are at least 10 bucks cheaper if not more,UNK
6057,"not near good enough for what you pay.\npaid $400 for a basic room on a Sat night, plus the BS resort fee. Add in extra charges like cabana, and outrageous food bills and this comes close to being a total rip off. I've stayed at truly world class hotels that charge less.",UNK
6058,Yes! This Lowe's has a bathroom. The car ride from Cave Creek to Phoenix was pretty long. Hmm.. at least the bathroom was clean.,UNK
6059,Came here to watch a football game with some friends from out of town. We were all impressed with the delicious food and friendly service. We ordered the pork wings as an app and they were amazing! Will absolutely be returning for the good food and drinks!,UNK
6060,I came here for the pretty swaroski crystal decor that was calling out my name. The drinks here are a rip off. I got a mixed drink for $13 and it didn't taste like there was a single shot in it for how small the cup was. The bar gets crowded so good luck finding a seat here.,UNK
6061,Came here because the reviews looked great! I was very disappointed! Lets just say $50 not well spent. The only thing I enjoyed was the lentil soup that was on the house.,UNK
6062,My first time getting my nails done here and I loved it. The woman named Jen did a fabulous job and worked with me until I figured out what I wanted. She was meticulous and very friendly.,UNK
6063,"There is never anyone at the front when I come in. Finally when I get her attention by almost having to go behind the counter, the girl is pretty rude. I ask for suggestions and she's just like I don't know. I love that this place is so close but the customer service needs to be better.",UNK
6064,We come here every couple weeks when we want solid hotdogs or bowls. The staff is super friendly and the food is amazing. Try the Euro Fries for a delicious twist .,UNK
6065,"The Schiacciata Dolce Vita was awesome as well as the service, ambiance and conversation with the owner, being that were both from Jackson Heights, N.Y.! A must for anyone visiting Phoenix, Arizona.",UNK
6066,"Great food...great drinks...everything was perfect, our server and buser were the best we have had in a long time. Food was cooked perfect and everyone was friendly.",UNK
6067,"1 1/2 stars, Dunkin Donuts donut's are gross. They are dry. Sometime they are good..but not usually. If you want good donuts go to Krispy Kreme. You'll be satisfied. :)",UNK
6068,"They accommodated to me and my friends very generously! I ordered teriyaki chicken and he used some of it to make a roll he thought I would like. I love the service, atmosphere, food, and especially the staff! A must go if you're in Vegas or looking for a new sushi place!",UNK
6069,"Oh how I love you \""SIMON'! Cotton Candy for dessert! What perfection.  Way cool vibe and awesome, hip, charming and sexy, chef, Kerry cant be beat!  Home away from home in Vegas.  ;-)",UNK
6070,We had to try it after golf. Food was OK. Scenery was very nice and extremely young. Why do 18 year old girls think that tatoos on their bodies make them attractive??,UNK
6071,"Decent Italian in a suburban strip mall. Decent wine selection, meal sizes were generous. \n\nBathroom was built for Phoenix Sun players, I had to tiptoe to use the urinal. Seriously.",UNK
6072,"Umm, don't do it. Just don't do it. I've eaten Sbarro in other places and they are known for delicious lasagna and their cucumber salad...This place, not so much. I'll never do Sbarro's HERE again.",UNK
6073,"Serves its purpose in catering to mid-20s dudes and guys who wear baseball caps. The occasional belch and waft of stale cigarette odor notwithstanding, not a bad place to catch a game. Otherwise, completely unremarkable.",UNK
6074,Service was good but the rice tasted burnt and the red sauce taste like they put tomato soup on my burrito. Their red salsa also had a little of the soup taste as well. I wouldn't eat here again.,UNK
6075,"Stopped into Gigi's yesterday, won't be going back anytime soon.. \n\nCupcakes look and taste like they been on the display shelves for days as the cake and frosting appeared to be on the VERY dry side..",UNK
6076,i been going to this place for almost 3 years.. an i always get the steak an eggs.. soo good... a great place to bring ur family too... it gets pack on weekends but it worth waiting..,UNK
6077,Pretty awesome place. Garlic chips on raw fish?!? Yes. Yes please. The ladies are super nice here. The sushi guys are nice....a little slow but nice. Their all you can eat is pretty great.,UNK
6078,I wish I would have read the reviews before deciding to come here. That's what I get for poor planning :( I swear $20 AYCE sushi was that nasty stuff from Costco.,UNK
6079,"Its another Cold Stone...good ice cream, yummy mix-ins, pricey treats.  Sometimes the staff at this location lacks the pizzaz of other places, but I still like this place for the occasional sin.",UNK
6080,"In my experience, this LVAC location has the rudest members. Sadly, it's the closest one to where I live if I want a quick workout. I wouldn't recommend coming here.",UNK
6081,"great workout place! It is clean, doesn't smell like a gym, the staff is way friendly - and all the people there are welcoming and fun. Modern equipment, lots of machines and a supportive vibe. I live in Los Angeles and have great gyms to compare it with....super cool.",UNK
6082,"Very clean looking inside and it was a very relaxing environment. It looks like a normal fro to type of place but all if the workers are friendly and helpful for whatever you need. It's a good place to go with friends or kids, more of a teenage hang out spot though.",UNK
6083,"Not bad, but other nearby places offer better bang for the buck. Ugh- and the skinny white chair was extremely uncomfortable- not ideal for dining out. The seat of the chair had no padding and was too thin. A rethink of the chairs are a must and should be made an immediate priority.",UNK
6084,Floridino's has really good food! I usually enjoy the ravioli with Alfredo sauce and it is awesome. The owner used to be a customer of mine at my old job and was always so nice and friendly.,UNK
6085,The food is good (same menu as the other locations) but it does take a while for it to arrive. Admittedly it was lunchtime so I suppose the lesson to learn is if you are hungry it is better to come outside of the lunch rush.,UNK
6086,"Mmm. Solid burgers, good beer. A little overpriced and there's always a wait. Order the bison burger - it's mouth-meltingly good.",UNK
6087,"They did a fabulous job. I was seated quickly and given a list of services and prices to look at while I soaked. I picked the Spa Pedicure and got two \""extra\"" services for $7 instead of $10. The environment is clean and calm and the service was not rushed. I will be coming back here again!",UNK
6088,This place is alright.  I would only come here for people watching and margs during the day.  The food is blech worthy.,UNK
6089,"Finally there's a great lunch place in Oakland.  The food is good and reasonably priced.  There are a lot of vegetarian options.  They get super crowded for lunch during the school year, and there can sometimes be long waits and slower service during the rush. The pizza is fabulous!",UNK
6090,Worst Service! The waiters did not care to check back on our table. We had to speak to the manager and they all (including the manager) were rude and arrogant. We will never go back to this place again. Food was just average as well.,UNK
6091,"Great Venue!!! Very large, sound system is awesome! Security is present but not in the way. I had a great time!",UNK
6092,"I've been here multiple times and have never been disappointed. The foods been good and customer service has been decent. The food is very Americanized and not authentic, but I knew that before ever going. The margaritas are delish and they are good about keeping chips on the table.",UNK
6093,I took pictures while at this location last week. Its a ok store didn't care for the staff attitudes tho so I give it 2stars.,UNK
6094,"Tucked into a strip mall, a quick walk across the street from the Hard Rock Hotel. Unique sandwich choices, great quality food. Even the \""small\"" sandwich was filling. You order your sandwich & then pay for it at the register once they call your name.",UNK
6095,If you love soda than this is the place. I love the dif root beers they have there it's an amazing selection! one of the best stores in las vegas hand's down. I could go there veryday nad try something new and I would never ge tired of it at all,UNK
6096,"Go in, Talk to AJ or Jeff. They do good things for people. See my upcoming review of the metrocenter store for more.",UNK
6097,"Nice atmosphere, great drinks at the bar and the appetizers were good especially the calamari and lobster mac n cheese. Food was good, not terrific. I'd recommend this for a nice evening out.",UNK
6098,"I wanted to like this place - I miss good Chinese (or Taiwanese, I grew up with it all) food!  I am not as impressed with this restaurant as other people seem to be, but that may be because my mother cooks better food.  It's just ok.",UNK
6099,"still at this place...we asked for more rice at 9:18pm, the same waitress told us that they close at 10 so they stop making rice now. wow! I'm so displeased with this place. Don't come here!!",UNK
6100,"Mediocre sushi and god-awful service. My wife and I, both ex-servers from our college years, tried them three times. Every time the service was infuriating and the food bland. Save your money.",UNK
6101,"Avoid if u can. Very unpleasant experince, only one waitress and she is so unorganized. On a Tuesday night we waited for over an hour between getting the menu and someone took our order. The food is mediocre too. Worst dining experience ever.",UNK
6102,"Decent breakfast spot, but the service wasn't tip-top, I'm not rushing to go back.... Decently priced tho.",UNK
6103,I've been here a few times since the initial review and the food has been marginal.  Guess I'll avoid for a while.  Bummer.,UNK
6104,"I have sampled a few of their varities before and they are amazing. I love that they are from Charlotte, the wildflower is a great all purpose honey and is what my husband uses to put in his coffee. I have only ever been to the location in Atherton Market which is small but still has everything you need!",UNK
6105,"This place is great.  I got a huge sandwich and a drink for about 8 bucks.  Friendly staff, quick service.  I will definitely be back.",UNK
6106,Waited 2 hours to sing. Never got called! Could it be the Latino names? Yet Tyler and Miles got called like 2-3 times. Just saying... :(,UNK

6108,"Very spicy salsa , greasy chips, worst quesadilla I ever had. Food below average in quality and way over priced -will not be back",UNK
6109,Crappy service. Came in to order one sandwich. Told me 30 min wait because they are in middle of a big order.  Employees goofing off while making sandwiches. Should have one person working counter orders.,UNK

6111,"So happy this location is here!! I love coming in on Sundays and getting their lox and bagel. Great tasting coffee, too!",UNK
6112,"This is one of the worst time share places  I have ever  stayed at.    It needs better regular maintenance and some updating might help i.e. spend money on bathroom, some new TV's and paint.  If you dont want to hang out there you are in trouble because nothing of note is within walking distance.",UNK
6113,"Great, helpful staff! Lots of shoes, shirts and accessories to choose from.\n\nJust an FYI they only carry a couple in stock of each size & they're smaller sizes are usually displayed.\n\nOverall great brand / store!",UNK

6116,"The dudes who work here sort of assume you should know everything, and in doing so, are pretty rude. A customer just asked an employee for a cup of water, and the employee said, \""We're not a restaurant dude...\""",UNK
6117,Had a coupon in my circular & kids thought we should give them a try! Kids were right food was good! Fish was seasoned & so were the hushpuppies. French fries were ok but the prawns and fish were a big hit at our house. Will be coming back soon!,UNK
6118,Cheap Taco's and food. The walls are polka dots. The food isn't half bad for what you pay Service isn't stellar normally I'm reminding them what comes with the meal and to make sure I get what I ordered.,UNK
6119,"J'y vais pour le kokosh, une brioche roul\u00e9e au chocolat \u00e0 se rouler par terre",UNK
6120,All Port of Subs are not created equal. I've lived down the street from this place for about a year now and every time eat there they have fresh toppings and very friendly service. My girlfriend and I have made it one of our regular lunch spots.,UNK
6121,"i just love the customization of seafood you can make. how you want it cooked, what sauce, what rub, what sides..it's an amazing restaurant with fantastic environment and great service. top 5 restaurant in vegas to me..along with capriottis and secret pizza at cosmo.",UNK
6122,Service was good. Today I had the buffalo chicken salad. Great choice for a wedge salad with good portion and great varied tastes with the blue cheese and ranch.\nPrices are reasonable. Good lunch spot and can get breakfast anytime is great.,UNK

6124,"Stayed at the Vdara this past weekend and had a chance to have a 50 minute massage and organic mani pedi.  It was great.  Each time I visit Las Vegas, I have a massage and I will say that I thought the Vdara was the best yet!",UNK
6125,The margaritas and chicken wings are great.  The place is really loud sometimes and the rest of food is just OK.  The corn bread used to be better but somewhere a long the way they changed it and its not as good nowadays.,UNK
6126,Definitely one of the best barbers on the westside of town. Ely takes his time and makes sure you are satisfied. I have tried a few different barbers around town and this is the best spot by far! I recommend this spot if you're looking for a great and friendly barber!,UNK
6127,Was lied to by the person trying to sell us our phone. After we realized we were ripped off we had a TON of trouble trying to return the phone. All in all it's not worth the effort. Go somewhere else.,UNK
6128,This place is great. The sushi is always good and the place and people are very inviting. The white tuna nigiri and both climax rolls are always good choices.,UNK

6130,The Flat Tire is great! The staff is very knowledgable and friendly. I wouldn't go anywhere else ever again! Thank you guys for the great service!,UNK

6132,"Service is just so slow, especially in the drive thru.  A couple of bean burritos for the kiddos is going on 30 minutes...no one in front of us.  This is maybe my fifth time thru this location and it just keeps getting worse.",UNK
6133,$6 cover change but Yelp had a 50% discount available tonight.  Good music but classics more than modern stuff.   It's lots of fun.   I don't think they serve food so good thing we ate before coming.,UNK
6134,"Skyland is the best 24 hour diner in town.  This place is family owned and has the typical huge menu and 24 hour breakfast.  This place is also great for breakfast any day of the week, and unlike many 24 hour joints, it isn't creepy, so feel free to go with your family.  The service is fast and the prices are low.",UNK
6135,These folks are nice but the food is pretty bad. I had the meatloaf which didn't resemble any meatloaf I've ever had. It tasted (and had the texture) of soggy toast. My Bloody Mary was horrible and even the vinaigrette dressing was bad. And its overpriced to boot.,UNK
6136,"Dr. Mansfield is amazing. She listens and provides valuable feedback and resources. I just moved t the area, and I was worried about finding a new physician. I'm not worried anymore; in fact, I'm going to stick around even though I've moved to Tempe. Fabulous care.",UNK

6140,"Stopped by for dinner before seeing Penn & Teller at the Rio last week. It was my first visit to this location, so I was surprised to see such a small one in a food court. Great sandwiches as usual, though. Can't go wrong with their Ham & Swiss.",UNK
6141,"although they're known for their lovely teas, the coffee here is strong and edgy without being bitter. layers of savoury nuttiness came through well, finishing with a very slight burnt caramel flavour like on the top of creme brulee. the temperature was great and the milk texture soft and rich.",UNK
6142,This place is okay. I go here for Chinese food. They have good beef and chicken dishes. The Lobster and noodles was pretty good. The sizzling rice soup is not great. I have had much better. The rice is not crispy enough.,UNK
6143,Every time I go in that store I find something....I love when I receive my coupons in the mail. Save and spend,UNK
6144,Had a $13.... 16oz brew.  I guess nacho daddy thinks they are located in the aria?  What a joke... I thought it was a local bar,UNK
6145,"I am updating my review from April 2nd. After my review Scott , the owner reached out to me to make good. He sent Brian out to my rental for an inspection at their cost. I believe Brian was very qualified in his field and I am 100% satisfied with results of his inspection.",UNK
6146,Totally worth it if you're looking for a fancy/special dinner place.  The pork chop cost me a pretty penny and left me quite full -- but they brought a complimentary dessert shot of butterscotch pudding topped with pumpkin seeds.  It was just the right about of sweet to follow my entree.,UNK
6147,First time with my husband to get a massage!!! We loved it!!!! Great service and hands!!!! ;),UNK
6148,Good clean gym. They try to replace broken equipment. Sometimes it seems the air conditioner has been turned off as it gets very warm inside.,UNK
6149,I highly recommend this hotel for extended visits to the Madison area.  My room was very comfortable and had a kitchenette.  The Desk Clerk (Brian) was very helpful by providing information about the area and ensuring my stay was a pleasant experience.,UNK
6150,"Soggy bun, Overcooked patty, Frozen fries, Terrible service.  This was probably the worst lunch I've ever had.  Seriously you can get a better burger at McDonalds.",UNK
6151,Typical Target.  I do like how they have the added benefit of a starbucks and (I believe) a Pizza Hut express. They also have a grocery side that has a pretty good selection (produce even)!,UNK
6152,My husband and I loved this place. The staff was very helpful with ordering and allowed us to sample six of their most popular items. We had enough food for leftovers the next day for under $25. It was great to see everything from ties to tatoos having a good time. My only complaint is that the restaurant could be a little cleaner.,UNK
6153,tried to go today at lunchtime:  but didn't realize it doesn't open until 3:00pm...would have been nice had someone posted that critical bit of information...so I am - in the hopes that it saves someone else a trip and will be back another day...,UNK
6154,This place was NASTY! Had the half chicken and daughter had the baby back ribs. The sides are awful and look like they had been sitting out all day. The mash potatoes were disgusting. Food is very bland. Tasted worse than hospital cafeteria food! I do not recommend and will never go back!!,UNK
6155,"We came here for a drink and snack. It was pricey for small drinks and the nachos we ordered were huge but not very good. Atmosphere was kind of cool., they have a volcano that erupts inside the restaurant.",UNK
6156,"Ate here in may and june was ok then ate here in July and it was awful. will never go back. I should have noticed most of the bad reviews are in july, seems like its getting worse .Fish was not fresh rice was bad. Most of  the  staff just seems confused.",UNK

6158,"Tucked away in a non descript strip mall on Sandhill Road in Las Vegas, one will find the value priced Beijing Noodle Cafe.  Delicious noodles and vegan orange tofu and spring rolls allow for a non meat alternative meal.\n\nSimple decor and friendly service.",UNK
6159,I must start with the disclaimer that I'm from Massachusetts so by no means am I BBQ authority.  But... the brisket was delicious and the mac 'n cheese is divine.  Two thumbs up!,UNK
6160,"Good happy hour. steamed pork buns, oysters, and chicken wings. my favorite were the wings. can't wait to go back again and try other items",UNK
6161,"Food was Excellent, but my friend and I ending up talking for 15 minutes before any staff came to our table for ordering. The order time was also very long.  The all girl waitresses liked to huddle and hang out before heading to any of the tables, which I did not like. Again, the food is amazing though.",UNK
6162,"Horrible experience!! Service is slow and food is not properly cooked. I order fetuccini pasta with steak and they overcooked the meat and brought it cold. This restaurant does not provide fine dining, I do not recommend this restsurant to anyone.",UNK
6163,"Worst ice machine on the planet!  I wanted hot peppers on the side, not on my sandwich.  Was refused.  Corporate Policy. WTF!  Lost me as a customer.  No one dictates how I want my sandwich made.",UNK
6164,"How do you call yourself a sports bar and don't allow your patrons to cheer for their team? Really? Expecially when they are ready racked up a $70 tab and alk before half time! Good way to not get tipped, bartender! Rude Rude Rude!!",UNK
6165,"Very disappointed.  Loved this place when they opened but this time I was disappointed.   Tea had a bad flavor, tables were dirty, son said meatballs tasted funny and no sauce and my turkey coleslaw was bland.   Bread didn't seem like anything special.  Too expensive for below average food.",UNK
6166,if you like the taste of corn syrup & garbage then this is your place to eat fudge...\n\nthe company is a complete JOKE..!\n\nYIKES..,UNK

6168,So after rest frustration trying to GET here. This... Is not a DMV. It's a tag and title agency. Well at least it is now.,UNK
6169,We come here for mid-night snacks (yep! we eat a lot!)\nI must say their Prime Rib for $5.99-7.99 is really good.,UNK
6170,Most expensive Sam Woo that I've ever been to.  Easily 40% more them other places.  My noodle was extra salty too.  Cash only. Portions are way smaller than other Sam Woo.,UNK
6171,Decent thai food. I liked the pad see ew and the pad thai. Not the best thai food but it will do. If you feel like thai food and you want it fast this is where you should go.,UNK
6172,"This place is awesome.  Authentic, home-made German food that is extra delicious.  Really neat place too!  Potato Pancakes are delicious.  Can't wait to go back.  I would take out of town people here instead of Church Brew any day.",UNK
6173,Ordered Panang curry and it was so ridiculously hot nobody couldn eat it. I asked for it a little hit and it was so incredibly hot that anyone who looked at it could not eat it. Plus they are not open hours they claim to be,UNK
6174,"I really liked this hooters. i am visiting, and the hooters from my town isn't that great. Hot girls and decent priced beer. I plan to go back before I leave.",UNK

6177,"Cathy works miracles.  I started with her 20 years ago, and would never let anyone else touch my hair.  Love her!!!!!",UNK
6178,"Friendly homey neighborhood restaurant. Solid simple dishes. Good pasta. Reasonably priced.  Comparing to other neighborhood Italians, it edges out the nearby Girasole, and it eclipses Cucina Flegria in Squirrel Hill. 3.5 stars.",UNK
6179,Amazing food. Everything is cooked fresh. You will never have ceviche like this anywhere else. The squid is cooked so well. Unique dishes and amazing service. A hidden gem for sure!,UNK
6180,I played today on a Tuesday. Play was a little slow at first but picked up. Course was in good shape. Pro shop staff was friendly. I would play here again.,UNK
6181,"Jets is delicious. You will not find any pizza place in town that gives better pizza than Jets. As a frequent goer, I recommend the 8 corner pepperoni with cheese on the crust. Also, the barbecue chicken will not disappoint.",UNK
6182,"They took $60 for a dual-application fee, just to glance at the application and tell us that we were automatically disqualified because we hadn't been living together for two years. I wish I could make money that easily.",UNK

6187,"Went down to try this restaurant. Waited 15 minutes for service in an empty restaurant while the servers were bussing their tables. Finally got service and cold bread, waitress blamed the slow service on it being busy when the place was deserted. We decided to leave and try our luck elsewhere.",UNK

6196,"The valet service is good but flawed, Sunday wait for your car after checkout was around 30min(as I was told), I waited over an hour because they lost my car and brought it to a different tower",UNK
6197,"Pretty disappointed. We saw le reve and it was better. Heard that the final scene had a mishap in 2013, so they will not be resuming that scene until 2016? Which should of been a big finale, was a real downer this time. Wish we knew before we paid like 300$ for it.",UNK
6198,"Just a standard mall.  This mall could be in any city in the country.  You aren't going to find Louis Vuitton or Prada here! \n\nHowever, they have Disney Store and we have a little girl, so we are here with painful regularity.",UNK
6199,"I have been here several times and I must admit, it's amazing. I haven't been disappointed with one meal so far and the portions are very generous, I tend to bring food back home and have a nice lunch the next day. And the prices are great, I recommend this restaurant to many of my friends.",UNK

6206,Yesterday we checked out Chi-Town Hustler at the food truck smackdown. They served a meatball slider on garlic bread. I liked it a lot. I find that meatballs are a good test of a place's quality. The meatball was on spot. Definitely will check them out again.,UNK

6212,Very sad experience. NYE in the worst restaurant in vegas. the worst food I ever had. They had a terrible fix menu. I had to eat room service after I left the restaurant. No recommended at all.,UNK
6213,Excellent food. Definitely try out the curry dish! The service here is fantastic. We do takeout from this restaurant usually ordering the curry laksa. The food is always ready within 10 minutes of placing the order. The roti canai is to die for.,UNK
6214,Don't go buy with the guy name Dante!!! He's horrible he tried to sell me everything possible. My family buy me a car to study in US and we didn't understand much and  he ripped us off. Don't recommend this guy at all. The worst salesman I have ever met!!!,UNK

6219,I used Full Circle Auto Body after my daughter's car was in an accident. They were very knowledgable and helpful about insurance issues and got the car repaired quickly. They post progress of your vehicle with photos on their website which is so cool. I'll definitely use them again if the occassion arises.,UNK
6220,"I love the feel of this place. It's tiny and popular so you may have to wait, but I think it's worth it. The service is great and the food is good home style cooking. Try the whole wheat french bread toast with honey on it, it's pure amazingness!",UNK
6221,"Tried a lot of different dishes liking all. Very friendly people. Try it you might like it. Think of it as home cooking as opposed to restaurant chain. Perhaps not like your home but something your friends mother, who is a great cook put together.",UNK
6222,"Salmon was dry, falling apart... not fresh. Tuna was bad too. Veggie Garden roll is great -- but that's not what you go to a sushi restaurant for.",UNK

6226,The best thing about Wicked Spoon Buffet's offerings is their dessert but that doesn't make up for everything else that they lack. Everything else was pretty standard. Their dinner menu may be better but I'm not planning another visit.,UNK
6227,"Have been visiting Beano's for many years. The food is consistently delicious, the staff extremely friendly and welcoming, and the atmosphere very low key. Last visit was shrimp cocktail, shrimp scampi fettuccine and Chicken Parmesan sandwich. Everything was delicious, large portions, and reasonable prices.",UNK

6234,"Outstanding room, updated, new and modern.  Very clean.  Great service at the front desk.  Bistro was excellent. The treadmills were top notch.  My fan in my room sounded like a jet engine.  The shower hot and cold were backwards.   I will definitely stay here again.",UNK
6235,"This place has a cool urban vibe, and mixed crowd, the patio is lovely and bartender Monique is very attentive and accomodating, the menu looks good but we usually just stop by for drinks. Its the closest thing to the Abbey in Phx.",UNK

6237,"On the way to wherever I am going.\nNot excelent service, selection or anything, but easy to get in and out of.",UNK
6238,"I had a great chicken club sandwich and the price was a little bit pricey. I believe that it was because of the \""BRAND NAME\"" Hard Rock Caf\u00e9 and for their profits. I enjoyed the meal. It was short walk distance from the Conference Center.",UNK
6239,Food is just OK. Called the other day and I think the person on the other end must have been stupid because they answered my question with a question. Cooks in the back look really weird and the place is a mess. Don't think I will ever go back there again and save you money. Its not worth it.,UNK
6240,"Pretty disappointed. Although this place brought back found memories of my elementary school cafeteria... It was a far cry from the expectation set by Bellagio and Ceasars.  Save yourself the cash and play it on black. This place had great service, with cold, mediocre food at best.",UNK
6241,Great happy hour. I'm a vegetarian and they have delicious options for me. Sushi and egg rolls are my favorites!,UNK
6242,"Very good Indian food, quick service, great price. I eat mostly the vegetarian dishes from there, but have heard that the meat ones are just as good.",UNK
6243,"A comfortable, very well run, attractive place to obtain your medication. Knowledgeable staff has been very helpful.  I really appreciate the security escort.",UNK
6244,"Visited Sep 2014. Unfortunately we went on a rainy day so couldn't enjoy the patio. Happy hour menu had a variety of choices that pleased our group, namely the fried liver. \n\nPortions are large and food was good. No complaints. Didn't really blow me away but I will be back for happy hour.",UNK
6245,"Coming from good Minneapolis independent coffee and tea, Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf was mediocre at best.  Coffee was watery and bitter.  The tea selection was impressive, but the workers were very resistant to make any of it iced.  This business seemed to be very corporate flaunting itself as independent with board games, books to read and free water.",UNK
6246,A nice small place where the fish is extremely fresh and the chef takes pride in his creations and freshness. Extremely friendly staff that makes you want to come back. Is Def up there with the best sushi places in town and it has ayce,UNK
6247,"Slices is good for a East Coast pizza fix. Nice thin slices, heated to crunchy after you select from a bank of pre-made pizzas. Cheap, quick eats for lunch!",UNK
6248,"Ate here about 1:30 pm on Sun/21 Dec:\n- The gyro tacos for $10 were delicious.\n- Had the $14 trout(?), that was good.\n- Will be back to try some other items.",UNK
6249,"I have been going here for too many years to count, and it is hands down the most authentic Japanese restaurant that exsists here. This is not American Style Japanese this is REAL YUMMY JAPANESE FOOD!",UNK
6250,"Great food, horrible customer service. Always gives bad attitude everytime I come in and its only like twice a year. Wish they were more people friendly.",UNK
6251,"I love this place mainly because these guys take their pies very seriously. I love their white pie, but truly cant be disapointed with any pizza on the menu. This is the best pizza place for take out outside the strip. The owner is a very passionate man who appreciates a good quality product everytime.",UNK
6252,Super cheap but no alcohol :(.  The service was excellent and I still can't get over how cheap the prices were...I thought they were serving appetizers or something.  Excellent food and conveniently located off the strip.,UNK
6253,"This is our go-to Chinese restaurant. They are always quick to get our tasty order ready. My husband doesn't come in that often, but the owner somehow always remembers his order. Good service and a pleasant experience.",UNK
6254,"TERRIBLE customer service.  Absolutely terrible.  They do not care about the customer, treat their customers like they're burdens interrupting their workday, and this location in particular has a very poor inventory.  The store manager, Julie, is no better; she is no advocate for her consumer.  I'll never shop here again.",UNK
6255,"Though a little overpriced for \""Kanda Class\"" sushi the place was alright. Better decor and nice though very informal service. If you're looking for high end sushi this is not the place. passable sushi and bring you own wine? worth a try.",UNK
6256,"I love Bath & Body Works but this location is not the best. Lots of attitude and very little Customer Service, except for a few ladies but I can't remember their names.",UNK
6257,Awesome place. Only guy who answered his phone on the Monday after 4th of July. Had the work done in less than 24 hrs!,UNK
6258,A good place to catch a game or two. Also their nightly specials after 8 are pretty good. They are a great place to snag a slice of pizza and a cold beer. They have the basic selection. Also they do have some pretty good dessert choices.,UNK
6259,"Solid Pita Jungle. All our food was fresh, fast, and good. A little bit of a wait on a Friday night, but not bad. Staff was fast, friendly, and courteous. Will definitely be back.",UNK
6260,"Strictly a place for Seniors, they love the terrible food which is salty and high in fat typical bar food.  The service is terrible, and the bartender spends most of the time chatting with friends at the bar and ignoring the customers.  Go into Phoenix if your looking for good food.",UNK
6261,Portions were outrageous.....got 2 meals out of the flap jack combo (brown sugar bananas). Everything was delicious down to the homemade biscuits.  Reasonably priced for being on the strip as well.  Expect a wait in the morning hours but we'll worth it!,UNK
6262,The atmosphere is very relaxing here at Griddlecakes. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. They also have tasty Gluten Free options and are happy to help accommodate me with my food sensitivities. I will be back here again.,UNK
6263,Food was OK but I've had a lot better.  For some reason they served naan bread rather than lavash.  Worst of all the service was rude and unprofessional.  I'm sure there are better options in las vegas.  Will go elsewhere next time.,UNK
6264,"Best place to get traditional pizza and simple Italian-American food.  Good crust, sauce, etc.  Way better than any chain.  This is not where to go for more exotic specialty/gourmet pizza, but for traditional stuff it doesn't get any better.",UNK
6265,"I really enjoy Chase's for breakfast. The omelets are really tasty, the service is always great, and the vibe is casual and laid back. A favorite.",UNK
6266,For all things Nike this store is pretty nice. It's a bit pricey but the fact you can get club fitted here makes it nice. If you have chips in your pocket make a stop to get your Tiger on.,UNK
6267,"It's an older dq, kinda dirty, employees seem preoccupied, but I am able to get my ice cream fix so I can't complain too much.",UNK
6268,I never get service here when I go!!! I always end up having to leave the store. In the past 8 years since I've live in Charlotte I have attempted this about 5+ times!,UNK
6269,"Really good. But sorry, definitely not Pei Wei. Can taste the deep friedness. Greasy. Less chicken than bread. No fresh veggies. Cheaper tho.",UNK
6270,"Great food, service and setting. \n\nYou are sure to repeat the experience each time. \nWent to many locations, this one is like all the others.",UNK
6271,Hummus was freshly made and very nice. Chicken souvlaki was good too but my vegetarian colleague didn't have any choice but to order some spinach thing. He wasn't able to finish even half of it.,UNK
6272,"Wow. Expected so much more.  Decent number of taps, but I kid you not. I asked for a beer and it was out. 4 times in a row. Each beer I ordered out. We ordered nachos  to split. Bad liquid cheese and very small for 12 dollars. First and last time here. Bad first impression.",UNK
6273,This store is so gross that I was almost sick! Onions peeled and half-rotten. Squishy garlic. Dirt everywhere. I will NEVER step foot in this place again.,UNK
6274,"The actual restaurant is fine, the service is friendly and good.\n\nI am not going to go in to the food other than to say, no.\n\nOh well $340 bucks and all I can muster is a no.",UNK
6275,"What a nice hidden gem. Table 274 in Cotswold hidden behind the toy store, the large space is quite inviting with dim lighting and calming earth toned colors. The food was all very fresh and the restaurant strives to use locally grown food. The staff seem to take great pride in their food and service. My waiter was wonderful!",UNK
6276,Food is good but the portion size is outrageous! Please share! Service is a bit slow and the staff aren't overly friendly but perhaps they had too many pancakes and simply can't digest!,UNK
6277,"This Subway I went to recently wasn't bad. I ordered a footlong Black Forest Ham with sides and got my order correct. The service was alright, long line though, but they need to hire more employees. When I ate the sandwich, it was very delicious and was very happy. Would definitely come back to try other subs.",UNK
6278,"it takes a little while for them to make sandwiches.. sometimes 20 minutes. The wait is worth it. I just call ahead and get it to go. I highly recommend the southwestern chicken panini. Very friendly staff, and off the beaten path makes for a great lunch!",UNK
6279,I usually go to Joanna's at mill/southern in Tempe. Was I'm this part of town during lunch so stopped by.  Green chili burro was good. Taco was burnt. Taking my bean burro w me. Waitress brought my food and never came back but to give my togo. Very disappointed.,UNK
6280,"The service is ridiculously slow. The food is good if you can get them to bring it to you. We went on a Monday for all you can eat dosas, but the service was so slow, we could only get about 1 dosa in a lunch hour.",UNK
6281,The food is always great but I love ice tea and its never good I always have to get hot tea and 2 cups of ice and make my own ice tea. I hope the new one that's opening on flamingo knows how to make ice tea.,UNK
6282,"The food is good, price is reasonable but the menu is confusing. It is not clear which sides come with what kind of food. Make sure you check that before ordering extra sides.",UNK
6283,"Good food, fabulous service IF YOU ARE SERVED BY MARIA. If not the service is pretty lackluster and might just ruin your experience like it did mine today.",UNK
6284,Here for the brunch. It's not bad it's just not living up to the reviews. I would compare it to the rio buffet.,UNK
6285,Had a few that were great and some just okay. Crab mix was better than most buffet style sushi. Did not refill sections very quickly. Be prepared to take your time with lunch. Okay service. Would return but not immediately.,UNK
6286,White guilt told me this was some kind of racial slur against chinese people. Yelp told me it was actually a killer chinese restaurant. Yelp was right! So so so so good!,UNK
6287,"We went here because there were coupons for buy one get one free drinks, the food was okay, but it was a bit pricey. The party/bar area seemed to have a lot of people having fun, but for the quality of the food, and the price was not the greatest.",UNK
6288,Great food. Service sucks so bad its not worth ordering.. Just waited 2 hours for a delivery!!! Its always over an hour on delivery as well.. I hope your not to hungry,UNK
6289,"Tried the colatta, which was ok. Also got some doughnuts and bagels.  Not a great selection of bagels and the doughnuts were ok.   I prefer Starbucks for iced coffee drinks and Einstein for bagels, as for doughnuts I'll stick with krispy kreme.",UNK
6290,The name says everything. The sashimi portion are small and expensive. Not a fan of all u can eat sushi bars. Service for get it. Pass on this bomb.,UNK
6291,"This is my new favorite Pho place! Very beautiful decor, great menu and plenty of delicious drinks too. They also have different bowl sizes which a few other Pho places in the area don't offer.",UNK
6292,The Beehive is like a hip community center for the South Side.  This is a great place to have informal meetings since there is a lot of space and tables to sit around and talk.  There is a bookshelf with some board games in the middle room which I confess I have never actually played.,UNK
6293,"Good place to stop for lunch.  Nice menu and very friendly folks.  Ordered the BBQ sliders and they are really big and tasty!  I could only eat one after the complimentary chip, salsa and guac.  My son had several of the tacos and they were all great.",UNK
6294,WOW! I should have read these reviews before walking in to this Little Caesars. Appearantly the people running this store don't give a crap about the nasty customer service at this location.  They lost a customer for sure. Never again,UNK
6295,"This place was  fast, friendly and accommodating. They add the extra touches. They did not offer parfin wax, the hot towels were warm and the language barrier was difficult to work around but their service and attention to detail made this place worth recommending. We will be sure to come back.",UNK
6296,Had the grilled cheese sandwich and tomato soup for lunch.  Sandwich was crispy  and cheese -- really good.  Soup was also above average.\n\nDefinitely above average.,UNK
6297,"This iHop was ok. The food was alright, has small quantities and very expensive on breakfast items even though its dinner time. The staff was alright but slow.",UNK
6298,This is by far the worst Del taco on the planet. Order will be wrong about 90% of the time. They have a new clueless person every time I go back. Heed my warning and go anywhere else.,UNK
6299,Just not so great. The tacos were dried out with just meat and cheese. I didn't eat them but the server didn't ask if anything was wrong. Margarita was not great.,UNK
6300,"We've eaten here a few times, and the food was always good.  However, the last time we ate there, I found a BUG in my food.  When we complained to management, they still thought we should pay for 50% of the meal.  Never eating there again.",UNK
6301,"This place is One of the best chinese food/delivery. Their chinese chx salad is Da Bomb, especially the dressing it comes with. And their salt/pepper shrimp is phenominal :) ive been getting delivery from them for YearS now...awesome job guys :)",UNK
6302,"This has got to be the most ghetto post office I've ever been to. Employees are not very proffesional. The place is so dirty. Place needs a good paint job and scrub down. I understand its not in the best neighboorhood, but keep the place clean for your customers.",UNK
6303,I have had Dan do two of my cars now.  Dan does EXCELLENT work is very affordable and was accomodating with my schedule.  I would recommend him to anyone.  There is no one better!,UNK
6304,"We arrived at 9pm and the restaurant closes at 10pm.  They seated us and we had a party of 7 people.  We ordered a variety of different things.  The food was not good, edible, but not good and considering the price that I was paying,  so not worth it.  I will not be returning.",UNK
6305,Great atmosphere. Good draft selection. Their burgers are very good my favorite is their home made boneless wings. They would just melt in your mouth. I tried their Philly salad but it was ok. More on the greasy side,UNK
6306,Open bar isn't an open bar. They wouldn't let us drink fireball or Jim beam for the 30 dollar fee. Kinda lame,UNK
6307,"Great store. Clean, friendly service and good prices! Best part is free childcare! Gives you up to 90min to shop kid free! Video monitors are set up around the store so I can keep an eye on the kids.",UNK
6308,The ribs were excellent.  The brisket was just ok.  Their sides were good as welll.   This place was good and above average for a barbeque spot.,UNK
6309,There server sucks 100 degrees outside.she asked if we could sit outside.also they couldn't make my daughter a grilled cheese.I guess no cheese n white bread.your better off going to ihop!,UNK
6310,"Wow. Get the chef special. Whatever it is, get it. It's great. I eat sushi lots of places in the states and this is one of my new top picks. Great/fresh tasting fish.",UNK
6311,"fast & pro! if you are in a hurry and don't want to spend too much time in the hair salon then here's the right place! most importantly, their price is reasonable! they even have a price for just cutting the bangs! however, no fancy environment but family style with professional skills and services!",UNK
6312,Just got rolled by this cab company! Cab lady took us from the Stratosphere all the way South of town to the Airport. It cost $46.00 and took about 25 minutes!!! DO NOT DRIVE WITH THESE PEOPLE!!!!!,UNK
6313,EH. My burrito was cold and El Pastor was way under seasoned. Such a bummer for such pricey food.,UNK
6314,"Bonne bouffe, bon prix...\u00e9vitez le all you CAN eat. Allez-y \u00e0 la carte...miam",UNK
6315,Sure I was dragged here kicking and screaming to this place...A cover charge for some music that wasnt my liking...what the heck?!\n\nI demand a refund! The parking is horrendous!!!\n\nIts highly likely that I will not return to this place,UNK
6316,I feel that there customer service sucks. They don't have time to help some one with a simple issue. People don't have time to spend hours waiting to talk with some one. Will probably not get an apple phone next time I get a new phone because if it.,UNK
6317,"Some of the best Cajun/creole food I've had in LV!  Really a hidden gem and not dirty or greasy like many of the Creole places I've been.  You should call ahead tho if it's a weekend, they have limited seating.  That Grilled bread is the bomb!",UNK
6318,"I didnt mind the food I bought, Pad Thai and Sweet and Sour Chkn, but my dad and husband were not big fans.  Overall they were nice and service was quick, food had a different taste than what we were used to.",UNK
6319,Most of the place is closed right now. I was told it was remodeling but I am not sure.  What is there is good but there is not much to see right now at the cultural center.,UNK
6320,"This is NOT the best galatto in the valley. Although the view of the fountain is nice, it was way over priced for the lack of flavor. It wasn't bad, but is there such a thing as bad galatto?",UNK
6321,"We had a great time, food was perfect. Friendly and fast service. Easy parking. We shared a salad and they splitted it in separate dishes at kitchen for us, so kind.",UNK
6322,"Good music, cool bouncers, stupid entrance. Excellent bottle service experience. Gotta love overhearing them move a group to another table to make way for us! Don't hate, it's just the business =p",UNK
6323,Service lacking.  They were removing tables and chairs before food arrived. Waitress asked several times what we ordered.  Cool place but need basic customer service training.  Mgmt and team.,UNK
6324,Enjoyed a delicious lunch this afternoon. Started off with a shrimp garlicky appetizer with green hummus and crispy pita chips.  Recommend the Gyro with the side of the Greek salad instead of the green salad. Atmosphere is very open air and pleasurable to people watch.,UNK
6325,This place is a great dive bar. We love the drink prices and the people here are laid back and cool. (no need to worry about any fights that I could tell) Highly recommend if you like dive bars. Also they have pool tables and darts.,UNK
6326,"Had the Bianca flatbread, it was one of the most amazing things I've ever eaten. Our server was also super nice and very knowledgeable. Would definitely come back!",UNK
6327,"This place is now one of my favorite clubs in Vegas! It is absolutely beautiful, and I love the fact that I didn't have to sit in a sauna all night - the outdoor patio section is awesome.",UNK
6328,Delicious spot! My wife and me came here for our expensive dinner out for our trip to Vegas. Food was yummy! Prices were pretty expensive but my wife got to see water show at the Bellagio from our table so we were happy with that.,UNK

6332,Enormous beer selection. Chicken tortilla soup and bbq chicken salad are very very good. Service is fast and friendly.,UNK
6333,The donuts were fresh and delicious. The apple fritter was perfectly cooked. The cake donuts were a magical blend of crispy and moist. My kids approved of the chocolate frosting.,UNK
6334,"The food in this place is wonderful and the service was great! Besides them taking for ever to get me another drink. But the only thing that REALLY bothered me, was the bathroom . It was disgusting ! It was really weird. Kind of looked like a bathroom in the park. Please redo it, something.",UNK
6335,"Ummm, I went in there to have a bunch of keys made.  $16 worth.  Yes, nice and friendly people there, but that doesn't make up for incompetence. Not a SINGLE key worked.",UNK
6336,They put way to much tire dressing on the tires when you drive off it splatters all over the car..\nMade it at 20 after 5,UNK
6337,"First time bowling in a league here and will not be back. One night our lanes broke down 10x's before we were finally moved to another lane. Water leaking from the ceiling onto the lanes. Will not be back for another league. The lanes at sams town are older, but we never have a problem there.",UNK
6338,"Fast service; delicious food; and a wonderful patio. Plus, I got a free cinnamon roll for checking in on Foursquare. Their southwestern breakfast burrito was solid--chock full of super fresh avocado. I will definitely be returning.",UNK
6339,"Very professional, easy to work with, and CREATIVE!! I would not recommend to anyone in my field because that would decrease my competitive edge :)",UNK
6340,Went with friends last Fri night...pizza and greans n beans very good...main meals mediocre...waitress seemed in a hurry and not warranted since many tables were empty.  Bar area very nice...would not go out of my way to return.,UNK
6341,"decent pizza depending on when you head in (sometimes the pie has clearly been sitting there for awhile). \nThere isn't that much good pizza by the slice in Madison and this will do the trick in a pinch, but don't expect anything special",UNK
6342,"Sold me an Air Filter for $38.54. I said it's too expensive. Answer: It is a great price, filters are so expensive. I'm look today in the Internet. $10.36. It's a scam!!!",UNK
6343,"A lovely venue, and the food is fabulous, if somewhat overpriced at lunchtime. Be prepared to savour what you get, though - the service is s-l-o-w.",UNK
6344,"Update, received gift certificates through email. Will definitely try it out again.\n\nAn extra star, the owner saw my review and said she did send the gift certificate so it must've gotten lost in the mail. She says she will email it this time. Hopefully I get it this time.",UNK
6345,Compared to many Asian super market this one is pretty unorganized. But does carry a large selection food and sauces. Parking lot is very small as well.,UNK
6346,"Excellent job. Brandon was very responsive - called to confirm the day before, called when he was on his way. He and his helper packed up everything quickly and efficiently. All in all, very pleased. Made my move significantly easier.",UNK
6347,"Dean, the manager, is amazing!!!  I have rented from other storage places before, but this has been the best experience.  At the other places I was just a number, but Dean makes it a point to remember everyone's name.  The place is clean and kept up.  As for the prices, can't beat them.",UNK
6348,Great Philly cheese sandwich but I always add my seasoning salt to it when I get it home.. a little spendy but all in all great service and fresh food..,UNK
6349,"After reading all the great and good reviews, had to try this place. Unfortunately, I was a little disappointed. I thought it was just ok. Ok food, Ok service, Ok ambience. The food at Denny's, IHOP are about the same. I would give this place an average rating at best.",UNK
6350,"The market has many variety things needed for home cook meals, but the place is not all too clean. The fruit and vegetables are not fresh but I guess if you need dry products you can get it here. It use to be Phoenix Oriental Market but things hasn't change much. Just different name and owner I believe.",UNK
6351,"I was going here all the time, but the flavors started getting really bad, and they wont bring back the ones that are good!! Have been looking around for a new place due to this issue",UNK
6352,I love coming here drunk.\n\nDecor is 1990's strip club... which is a plus in my book.\n\nFood is good too. I like seing all the industry people here,UNK
6353,"Okay, I think I saw the alleged crackwhore twice. But maybe she just has Parkinson's.\n\n...from doing a shit ton of crack\n\nStill, she doesn't make me feel unsafe and she is typically dressed very well. Business-casual. Corduroy blazer.",UNK

6355,Where else can you get a side of black beans and egg Foo young with your hen grenade cheese quesedilla? Plate lickin good!,UNK
6356,"Institutional food at best. Sevice was great, but not enough to overcome the food quality. This is mac n cheese with powdered cheese, pudding from a can, cheesecake with a slight chemical taste?, etc. Sorry guys, your great but your food is not unfortunately.",UNK
6357,"Taco tuesday is awesome! It's a little off the beaten path in old town and the type of people that come here seem to be good people. One of my favorite spots in Scottsdale both because of the service, tacos, Shiner, and the very cool look of the place.",UNK
6358,"Nice atmosphere. Friendly staff. Fresh warm Russian donuts... Need I say more? Check this place out, worth the experience. Also try the cidre chaud! Delicious! The sovi\u00e9tique is worth a try too :)",UNK
6359,"My husbands favorite, I go for the frozen yogurt and the choice of one frozen yogurt choice and two or three sorbet choices has me feeling, left out but for all the many choices kudos I guess, the place is run by teenagers so customer service is spotty but they listen and never had any complaints on accuracy,.",UNK
6360,"My advice would be not to eat here if you value your life! I had a simple beef dip with fries,it tasted so old like they had to thaw it from deep freeze after 2 years,horrible!!!!!I was literally Ill for for days,wil never eat ther again",UNK

6362,"Flavorless cardboard and meat like substance..,   Unfit for human consumption !!!      I gave irvine last try and it's worse than ever",UNK
6363,"Hands down the best Thai food I have had in AZ.  I have ordered most things on the menu and have yet to be disappointed.   If you know your Thai food, this is the place.  We eat in or order it out at least once a week.",UNK
6364,Friend recommended me here. Over 400 restaurants in Japan. Amazing food. Customer service was phenomenal. Great job JJ. Made happy hour. Awesome drinks. Eat here people!,UNK
6365,This place is totally overated...way too expensive with small portions. Food is really not all that. Nice restaurant and very clean.,UNK
6366,Sushi was not bad. Wonderful service. Garlic edamame was delicious.  Thank you to Young for being so sweet and friendly even though we were a pain in the ass. She made me a custom spicy sauce and made no fuss when we had a disagreement on an order.  Thank you Young!,UNK
6367,"A friend was told that he had to leave the restaurant because he was speaking Spanish and it was an \""English Only dining area.\"" This place is foul. See the picture added above. It is so disappointing to know that when Arizona takes 2 steps forward an establishment like this brings it 5 steps back. Disgraceful.",UNK
6368,"My roommate has been coming here for years! It is nicely priced, and they do an Excellent job. I am super happy with how they dry cleaned my maxi skirt.. and got the stains out of it. Bravo! \nI really thought it was the end of my skirt. Thank you!",UNK
6369,"I normally don't like chain restaurants, but I do like eating at the Olive Garden in Greentree.  The food is pretty good here and the service is always excellent.  Although not my first choice, still quite okay.",UNK
6370,Stopped in for lunch when in buckeye ( not much options in buckeye) had the Philly cheese steak. sandwich was nothing special other than the price was in the double digits for it and a drink.,UNK
6371,"They seem to be in the middle of a transition, changing the menu to add special entrees and such.\nThe manager was walking around tonight offering patrons random FULL entrees for free, just to try ! That type of atmosphere is what will guarantee my return - goodonya GG.",UNK
6372,"This is more of a bar than a restaurant.  Do not go to eat, only go for drinks.  Happy hours prices are only given at the bar anyway.  \nThe wait staff was only interested in serving the drinkers and drunks.  \nTwo orders of fried shrimp took 45+ minutes to come out and was served cold.",UNK
6373,"Great place!  Fantastic stylists, very warm and welcoming owner, makes you feel appreciated for coming in.  We went in as a party of three before going on a trip and it was so much fun.  Everyone loved their hair!  Thank you Vanity Blowout Bar!",UNK
6374,"Was a lot of fun but one of the guns kept jamming and the manager handled the situation poorly.  The employees and management definitely could use some customer service training, wasn't impressed. They were also incredibly understaffed as we waited nearly 30 minutes to sign up and choose our guns. I won't be back to this place.",UNK
6375,Great place for Italian food. Very family friendly. Mellow atmosphere with friendly and knowledgeable staff. Never had a bad meal. My favorite is Sirloin Marsala and you can choose any pasta they have to go with it at no charge. Recommend to anyone who enjoys quality Italian for a good price.,UNK
6376,The customer service here is the worst. There usually isn't anyone around and when they are around they don't know what merchandise they carry or where to find it and they won't bother showing you the way or helping you find what you need. Last time I ever come to this location.,UNK
6377,All you people that give this place a low rating need to go eat the crap down the strip... This place is great... I love the chicken buffalo chicken dip thing lol and the meatball pizza. this place is way better then the shit they have down the strip.,UNK
6378,"Very interesting! Everybody in our group enjoyed this show very much' especially the price. With the ticket of Nathan Burton's show, it only cost $5/person for this show. Very much worth it!",UNK
6379,"Only one refill is offered and the receipt is needed. Usually, there is a line for ordering but getting the order is somewhat quick. Typically, if it is a busy, the ordering process takes a while. Plenty of seating around inside of the Luxor food court area. No WiFi offered from this location.",UNK
6380,A Winner!  Great Sushi and Sashimi served by an attentive waitstaff willing to make suggestions and work with chef on non-menu items. Tried 4 different Japanese beers.  A Great Spot.,UNK
6381,"The conference folks picked this place for the gay dinner. It's basically a step or two above Pizza Hut.  Waiter was nice and very cute.  They all seem to be very nice here in Montreal compared to the USA, I have to admit.",UNK
6382,"I had a spring salad and my friend had a welcoming breakfast. Both of them are great! If they can use a bigger bowl for salad , it will be better because it is hard to toss the salad in a small bowl.",UNK
6383,One of the Vegas spots to hit up after a night of heavy drinking. I ordered the pho combo and a sandwich. Everything was good.,UNK
6384,Best acai bowls.  Staff is friendly and knowledgable. They offered us samples before ordered. We ordered raspberry pecan and just acai. Both of them were awesome! We were really pleased and will be back again.,UNK
6385,"L-A-Z-Y!!!! I was ready to spend a good $50-$60 and they said I'm out of their delivery range. Looking at my gps, they're 4.4 miles away.",UNK
6386,Basic stuff. Would like the staff to speak better English so they can understand my order. Or (according to some dip$hits) i should learn Spanish and/or Chinese just to aid in my order.,UNK
6387,"I have eaten here once. Had great  customer service, endless options and food was SOOOOO good but WAY overpriced. 2 sandwiches for over $20 without a drink or side. No thanks. Probably won't come here again for a while which is a shame.",UNK
6388,"10.16.10\n\nCome early to snag a spot, if you can get up in time.\n\nCrowd with nice bods ready to party under the sun.\n\nCouldn't stay too long as I get claustrophobic, though...",UNK
6389,This is a cute little spot with above average food for the prices. I've been three times now and I have had a good experience each time. Service really seems to depend on which server is helping you. Try the bottle rockets and the pot stickers.,UNK
6390,"Excellent bar! We were staying in the area and checked it out on a whim. Attentive bartenders, yummy drinks and cheap cheap cheap! Please open in Raleigh!",UNK
6391,"Just ate here a few days ago. There food is made to near perfection. \n\n    Unlike most Asian food, that is most of the time lacking in flavor, this is full of flavor \n\n    They offer Thai and other Asian food. Each bite as tasty as the next.",UNK
6392,"Fresh, housemade, talented, totally yummy. Comfortable, casual, eclectic environment. I know good restaurants, go here!!!",UNK
6393,"Nice people and good service, it's just the food was subpar.  If you love airplane food, you'll love this place.  If you like good subs, this is probably not the best place for you.  Another negative is the pricing - it seems to be way higher than Subway, which has better subs than Blimpie.",UNK
6394,Right on scottsdale rd. waited very long even though we were the only customers. The meat for the burger was terrible with chunks of stuff in it. The skirt stake also had a very bad taste in it. Staff was nice and courteous. Would not go here again.,UNK
6395,I got a steak and potato burrito and they put freaking cheap French fries on my burrito to fill space. Del taco sucks big ones. The best part was the sauce that killed the flavor.,UNK
6396,"One notch up from ihop and others, as Butterfield is a breakfast chain also.  Pancakes are good, crepes are their specialty, and the OJ is fresh squeezed.  \n\nReasonably priced, except for crepes which seemed a little high to me.  Long waits during prime hours.",UNK
6397,This bar reminds me of an upscale PT's. It has gaming but also has pool tables and food. Drinks were kinda high,UNK
6398,"I was really looking forward to coming here with my friends on our trip, and I wasn't disappointed.  Sure, some of the figures didn't look exactly like the real celebrities, but it was a quirky place to take some fun pictures.  If you have some free time, you should check it out!",UNK
6399,"Really good service and atmosphere.  Food was good, but over-spiced and definitely pricy.  I would go back, just not very often.",UNK
6400,"Clean and beautiful interior and friendly staff. The food was very good and the woman (who I'm assuming is the manager or owner) was very attentive. Although there were a few problems with our food (my mother's order came out wrong) overall, I was pleased with the experience.",UNK
6401,stayed here once. hated it. wrong end of the strip. ended up spending $100 trying to get the strip all week.  pools are just ok. nothing else really going on here.,UNK
6402,Show up on Monday to place your order or Pasty's - pick up Tuesday. Very good and love the brown gravy that goes with it! Nice friendly people running this very busy establishment. We're going to try breakfast there soon.,UNK
6403,The atmosphere was great. The food and service was not so great. We had a really depressed waitress and food took for ever to come out. We also noticed the food to be bland and dry. I would not recommend this place to anyone looking for authentic Mexican food.,UNK
6404,"The guys from Smooth Move were great! Their pricing was more affordable than other companies, they were on time, fast, careful, just overall awesome!",UNK
6405,"good location, nice setup, but wasn't super impressed with the food. Excellent service and the Mechanical bull was calling my name... but think I'll save my bullride for next time, after a few jack n cokes!",UNK
6406,"This castle is truly fantastic, it seems as though the entire history of Scotland is contained behind the stone walls of this structure that will keep you occupied for several hours. Those with a particular interest in military history will be very happy with what the castle has in it's various museums.",UNK
6407,Great place for  burgers and shakes. Needed a place to dine while at the Cosmo. All of the other places didnt open till like 4pm. This was a great fix. Cant wait to go back. Many more shakes and burgers to try.  The service was great.,UNK
6408,"Solid, though not overly impressive. The spicy pork was my favorite. The brisket is just that- meat. There is no marinade on it at all. The sides were good. Definitely recommend lunch- cheaper prices, same menu.",UNK
6409,"I went for lunch, the specials were just okay. There was nothing special about their sushi and the customer service was terrible. We needed to flag the waitresses down just to get a drink refill. I haven't been back and since found much  better sushi places in terms of taste, service, and specials.",UNK
6410,Very very good \n\nOff the cuff breakfast sandwich \n\nHost chef waiter and a wealth of knowledge!!!,UNK
6411,"This place is embarrassing! The service was terrible, the management was rude and unorganized. The food was not good and way over priced. The setting is so fake classy... I have no idea how it has managed to keep up in Kierland Commons! Take your time and money elsewhere.",UNK
6412,"Great wee bar to meet locals , small inside but a great atmosphere , you may be lucky as sometimes the pipers come in and do their stuff , staff are friendly and handy position where it's located.",UNK
6413,Hawaiian BBQ is my favorite Hawaiian place in North Vegas. The thing that makes them just a step higher than 808 mixed plate is that they have fried rice and they deliver. They will even deliver to the Airforce base. The food is always good and I have never had bad service. The short ribs are my favorite!,UNK
6414,"Love the beer, the appetizers are good too.  Just a great place to hang out, can't wait until it cools down and can hang in the patio!",UNK
6415,The location and atmosphere are fun but the food is just mediocre to me. I'm not sure what all the buzz is about and why there is a line out the door almost constantly. Maybe I'm just ordering the wrong things but the food really doesn't seem to be something extra special that I couldn't make at home.,UNK
6416,Too bad Yelp doesn't allow me to write a review with zero stars. I'm sad to say although Kampai is open for business it might as well be closed down.,UNK
6417,Excellent calzone. Unreal. Take it into bar and enjoy with a beer. Even though Ellis island bartenders are the worst ever.,UNK
6418,"Fell in here on a Thursday night, they had live band Karaoke.  What a blast.\nGreat brew selection, try the pretzels, we had great service all night!",UNK
6419,For some reason locals love this place.  I am not one of those people.  I've eaten many a meals here and always wondered why it was so busy.  The one thing I do like is the live music.  If you long for old-school vegas stop by the bar and listen to the band.  Eat dinner somewhere else first.,UNK
6420,Saturday or Sunday it does not matter. Either is a great day for brunch here. Good options and the mimosas keep on coming.,UNK
6421,"First time here and my daughter LOVED IT! Great service, great food nice atmosphere.  Definitely will return anytime I am on that side of town.",UNK
6422,Censored art. The board  for this club wants dumbed down art that doesn't offend their sensibilities. But....just butt.,UNK
6423,"Regarding the long waits, it's because they take their time. One of the best haircuts I've had in awhile.",UNK
6424,"Worst place ever! Their nasty karaoke singer who is a regular, physically assaulted my brother-in-law and the bartenders did not care! There was no manager or owner on staff! This place is managed horribly and I do not recommend it to anyone!",UNK
6425,"The chicken is very good and different from the norm.. The beans always seem to be very salty thou. But, excellent chicken and taste good. Don't care for the onions they give you with meal. But as always good eats on the chicken,ha !!",UNK
6426,If anyone wants to know where Kevin is call me. I would like to build a case against him too. 702-624-9208,UNK
6427,We ordered a world map for our missionaries board at church. It was exactly as it looked on the web. Also very happy with the quick delivery! Would recommend this company! They have a lot of variety also!,UNK
6428,"My favorite bar throughout my entire visit to Montreal.  Kind of divey, but clean and unpretentious.  Great food too!  A kind waitstaff, fun location and great music rounds out the whole experience.",UNK
6429,We just moved here and needed to find a new OBGYN to continue my prenatal care. From my initial phone call to my first few appointments I can honestly say I love this place. Great customer service and the staff care about you. Dr. Newman is awesome. Highly recommend!!,UNK
6430,"Great little sandwich shop!  Smallish portions, but that's ok by me.  Good prices, nice variety.  Delicious cookies:)",UNK
6431,Rage Cycles is the best.  They have come through for me when other bike shops fail.  This is now the ONLY place I will take my bikes.  Their quality of service is excellent and they get the work done fast.  I recommend them to everyone!,UNK
6432,"I come here all the time because it's right by my job.  I have gotten lots of cute blouses, pillows for the home and shoes. Seems to be a much better quality than others, and of course great prices. I even find cool music there pretty often (Yazoo, The Specials, etc.)",UNK
6433,"Horrible service, loud & crummy ambience & mediocre food. It took 1 1/2 hours to get get an order of french toast, not worth it!",UNK
6434,The apps are awesome...\nThe menu is somewhat hard to read.\nBoth worth it...\n\nIt is very ... very hard to find to find.,UNK
6435,I been to the North outlet I like this one better because it is more like the mall indoor rather than out door...!\nI will be back...!,UNK
6436,The perfect non-fast food place to have lunch on our drive home from Vegas. The gyro meat was yummy and not too salty. I absolutely loved the tzatziki sauce which had chunks of cucumbers and pickles in it.  The side of rice that came with it was also good.,UNK
6437,"Honestly nothing special. People still eat there don't ask me. Food Is Bland Theye Skimp On Hummus, man dunk the stuff on my plate it's good for me I want more of it. This place give soo little hummus, nothing really memorable. ...",UNK
6438,Best pierogis in the city! And being in Pittsburgh that says a lot. Haluski is pretty awesome to with the bacon!,UNK
6439,"I like this place. It has a good feel and delicious margaritas. If I were back in Old Town, I might stop by. But I am sure every neighborhood has their own margarita spot that is quite similar. There is no reason to drive for miles to get here.",UNK
6440,Enjoyed the tapas at Mercadito.  Just the right about of portions.  Though I think many will find it pricey.  But its in Red Rock Casino...so would expect it to be.  Service was great.  After 7pm expect to wait for table.  Overall a good experience.,UNK
6441,"The atmosphere was beautiful and the staff members were amazing. The food was cook to perfection, but I've had better food especially in Vegas. The prices were very high but hey what do you expect it Chef Gordon Ramsay.",UNK
6442,"After living in Vegas for 5 years, I finally decided to check out Serendipity. Everything is so over priced. It was mediocre at best. For the price, I expected a lot more. Definitely the first and last time I'll ever go.",UNK
6443,"the three star yelp average review is correct.\n\npizza quality differs every time i go there. it's either very good or very bad and nothing in between.\n\nhipster servers somes care, sometimes don't. cross your fingers before you venture to brick.",UNK
6444,"Placed my order before I went to go pick up our order because usually at dinner time they get really busy.  Service was quick, easy and friendly, pizza is delicious and my mom LOVED the garlic parm wings!",UNK
6445,It's been a long time since I've been to a Wahoos. Cajun fish taco plate is tasty but too much watery salsa on the tacos. I had to use a fork because the tortilla fell apart.  But good healthy food!,UNK
6446,"This place is really great, has many kind of pastries and a lot of collections. I would recommend this place to all those who has good taste for pastries and coffee/ tea. I really like this place.",UNK
6447,"My wife and I live for sushi! We eat it everywhere. We ran into this place and tried it out. We enjoyed it. Everything we are was good! Plus, they have chopped wasabi! That it a huge plus to us!!",UNK
6448,"Best Chinese in chandler, potstickers are amazing!  Came in on a Saturday even though yelp says it's closed, glad I did.  We had the fried rice which honestly is better than most places around here.  The happy family and seafood here was delicious.\n\nWould definitely return.",UNK
6449,I love this place!! Price are very good!!! Great great job every time I com!! Every one please don't forget to TIP!!! Don't be that guy..!!,UNK
6450,"Worse experience I have had at a Cafe Rio!\nStood in line which moved about 3feet in 25 minutes.\nWe left, along with many other people who were frustrated.\nGet it together!",UNK
6451,"I had the Lamb burger, and my wife had I think the mushroom burger.  Our food was very prompt, tasty, and decently presented.  Definitely will be coming back here for a bite next time in in town!",UNK
6452,"The buffet is a little better than typical, but not enough for me to return. \nTheir specialty, asian, was plentiful, but not extraordinary.\nThe staff is very nice and the decor is modern.\nThe miso cod fish was the best.",UNK
6453,"Tons of food choices, but the taste was gross! Was given free buffett for a bday. Luckily....",UNK
6454,Place was empty and they made us wait 30 mins to be seated.  Ugh... People who walked in after us thought they were being punked.,UNK
6455,"After new management for this franchise, they have definitely decreased the portions and changed the menu for the worse.....not better.  Large sashimi platter looks like a \""small\"".  Never coming back!!  A waste of money!!",UNK
6456,"It was ok. I liked the atmosphere and the service was good but nothing else really impressed me. I split the BBQ Feast with my family which contained a little bit of everything. I will say this, the beans and the corn bread were really good.",UNK
6457,I come here at least once a week & the staff is always friendly. Cory is one of the nicest tellers I have ever come across. Very happy with this bank & lucky its only a minute away :),UNK
6458,"Walked in here on a pub crawl around Madison. Not impressed. The service was horrible, even at an almost empty bar. We finished our beer and moved on.",UNK
6459,"This is definitely the worse beach club I have been to. Yeah its fun on certain days when Party Rock makes an appearance... otherwise its just an overcrowded area with a small, dinky, and grimy pool!",UNK
6460,"Great subs,affordable price and good service.My only complaint would be the night club like volume of the music-difficult to place your order!",UNK
6461,"Echoing virtually everyone else's reviews, the outside space is very good, both due to the space itself and the amazing view.  Found it kind of odd though that dancing was actually prohibited, especially since there was DJ on the inside that was playing typical top 40 club music.",UNK
6462,"Man, do you have to get the pastrami! It is divine! Their desserts are good too. Lovely service and convenient downtown location. Recommended.",UNK
6463,I  have eaten and had drinks at Lappartement resto-lounge. The service and hosts and owner are all fabulous. Everything was amazing and the service was outstanding. The staff and crowd were friendly and fun. I have gone back regularly . I recommend the restaurant and the fun lounge. Five 5 Starts!! Excellent!!,UNK
6464,Bratalian has Italian food with a Brazilian flair.  The place has a great ambiance.  The servers are attentive.  The food is outstanding.  I have eaten there three times now.  Their meatballs are incredible.,UNK
6465,"The place was completely empty however the women working there had impeccable service and was very helpful. She did an excellent job with my brows. I'm not from Madison and I was looking for a place to walk in, but I will definitely come back next time I'm in town",UNK
6466,"Best(healthiest) chicken around!  The ribs are even better. Great sides friendly staff , very casual. I live in the neighborhood and can't resist, when I drive by. Check yelp for coupons and have twice as much!!",UNK
6467,This restaraunt has from line employers who have visible tattoos.  Disgusting.  They do not care about professionalism or cleanliness of the employees.,UNK
6468,"This place is the new Chop & Wok.  Good old fashioned, down and dirty chinese take out.  The owner is right out of a Seinfeld episode and it's worth eating there just to watch him run the show.",UNK
6469,Stopped by today to get a few things for work and it's no longer there..... I'm not sure on if it moved or went outta business. I hope it just moved.,UNK
6470,Omg!!! That's is the best sea food in las vegas... It is a must do when you come here,UNK
6471,Just OK. Had a great time here watching hockey - practically had the bar to ourselves. Bartender Steven was very nice and we had a great time chatting with him. However the drinks were only medium strong and really pricey!! Should have run up to our room and mixed our own.,UNK
6472,I don't like vegan food usually but you would seriously never know it wasn't meat. Its really tasty and well priced!,UNK
6473,"Very prompt and friendly delivery, but there was a large piece of mangled plastic wrap inside my italian sub. Gehh..",UNK
6474,Amazing food!  Prompt service!!  Comfortable atmosphere!!  Can't say enough good things about this place.  First visit here and DEFINITELY will be here again very soon!,UNK
6475,"Love this place...been for brunch and dinner several times since it opened, highly recommend the pancakes and bacon, the street tacos, the chicken mole and paella.  The otro salad is excellent, as are the mojitos..",UNK
6476,I've been to many gamestops and I always keep coming back to this one. The customer service is amazing everyone is really nice an helpful even though its constantly packed in there. I get great recommendations there and bob is awesome he knows his stuff!,UNK
6477,"We just recently discovered Mid City Kitchen, and I really wish we would have known about it sooner! They have great variety, so everyone in my lunch group can find something to eat. This is one of the places that everyone has agreed they would go back to - which is rare for the area!",UNK
6478,I came here for the first time about 4 months ago.  Juan cut my hair and did a fantastic job.  Everyone I know likes the hair cuts I get from here.  The only thing I wonder is what took me so long to go.\n\nAsk for Juan.  He's the one to go to here.,UNK
6479,Very good massage by Rex n coco.  Nice atmosphere.. But it could get noisy in the evenings when it gets busy.  Good service n clean environment.  Highly recommended!!!,UNK
6480,"Best bar, jukebox, people and the best place for Vegas souvenirs.  A no brainer place to go if you visit Vegas...if you like the strip casinos...stay there!",UNK
6481,"The prix fix is good deal app entr\u00e9e and glass of wine or other non alcoholic drink. Very clean place, good service.",UNK
6482,"Fun atmosphere - dark, mysterious, semi-loud live music.\n\nThe wine flights are fun and flatbreads were tasty.\n\nI would have expected a longer wine list from a world wine bar, but I have learned to lower my standards for AZ wine bars compared to wine bars in Chicago.",UNK
6483,"Wow, definitely the worst \""Thai\"" food I've ever tried to choke down. Completely flavorless, mushy and definitely not worth the $8.95.  You'd be better off gnawing on your sweaty sock....",UNK
6484,Not impressed by the dirty dining area. The 3 ladies working were busy discussing problem customers. Too pricey for a bad experience here. The new hot cookie was good but not great for the 6 dollar price.,UNK
6485,Great service and good choices!  The veggie omelet was yummy. Next time I'll be decadent and try the Cinnamon Bun French Toast.,UNK
6486,Predicting this place will be going out of business soon. Never been great but i have found some great buys here on Columbia pants and such. Now the store has limited stock it appears and is stretched out to fill the gaps which you usually see in stores struggling to stay open.,UNK
6487,"Clean place.  Pancakes a bit too buttery for my taste (and health!).  But the vibe was good, and people were enjoying themselves, so I'd go back again - just wouldn't order the pancakes!",UNK
6488,Bumbed out!!!! My daughter was visiting from CA and told her about the freaky fast delivery and what a shame. 45 min for delivery..... More like freaking slow delivery!!!,UNK
6489,"Meh at its best... For the level of good food places in Montreal, this place is pretty disappointing, expensive also... Din't waste your money here given the great number of choices and places in this city...",UNK
6490,I did enjoy the cupcakes. My daughter did love them and ate it up in seconds. I love the idea of being able to make your own creation. Just dnt think they're the best cupcakes in town.,UNK
6491,Service sucks. Place is dirty. We were supposed to have a table and never got one and had to seat ourselves. Took 30 mins to get a server. Drinks were awful. Paid to put bride on stage and it lasted a whole 3 mins. Will NEVER be back.,UNK
6492,Fantastic customer service at this location. I almost always find a great deal on some random item I needed when I casually stop in when in the area.,UNK
6493,I love this place since my Mcgill days! I misssss it! But whenever I m in the area I run straight back for my poutine and pita or altoburger or chicken ceasar salad with garlic bread or pizza or wings and things.....too bad they only deliver downtown!,UNK
6494,"Worst customer service ever!  Trying to redeem the check in deal was told that the special is expired and it's no good, when I just ordered $40 worth of food Togo.  The cashier was rude so was the manager..  Never coming back.",UNK
6495,"Lots of hype here, so i tried them on a sat afternoon...not the best time as they only had a couple trays of goods left. Tried a sugar twist and a yeast donut....both good but nothing to write home about. Will try again when they are more fresh and have more selection. Nice service.",UNK
6496,"Best prices in town yes,  but worst customer service.  Everyone I talked to there is extraordinarily rude! Don't believe me? Call them and ask a question.  ANY question will do.  I want to spend my money locally with local small businesses, just not with LWTC,  not any more.",UNK
6497,"The pizza is out-of-this-WORLD perfect. The crust is perfect. Slightly crispy on the bottom, and fluffy in the middle. The sauce was neither too salty, too thick, too thin, or too anything. It was a perfect compliment to the perfectly placed toppings and just the perfect amount of cheese.",UNK
6498,"I came here three Sundays ago. The reality didn't live up to my hopes. Coming from Los Angeles, where Mexican food is abundant, it left me wanting more. I ordered chicken fajitas, refried beans, rice and flour tortillas. It wasn't nasty, just not delicious as widely proclaimed.",UNK
6499,I mainly order the kebabs when I come here.  A little pricey but they are quite good.  If they had an option for more meat and less pita/rice I'd make this place my full time controlled carb eatery in Carnegie.,UNK
6500,Went in today as my headlight was out.  They came out to check and all it was is a loose connection. Thanks for being honest!!!,UNK
6501,"Clearly I'm not the only one who learned about Thai from the Y.  Now that I've had a lot more Thai food, I still fondly recall the pad thai from the Y.  Great food, wonderful prices, and always fresh.  It was so good, so close to home, and so worth the wait in line.",UNK
6502,"Great selection, friendly staff, clean and organized layout. I went in asking for a one-shot comic and the clerk helped me look through filing cabinets and shelves to find it. They do offer special orders.",UNK
6503,"I've been here quite a few times and always enjoy it. The lounges are very cozy and are great for a small group of friends to just hang out, smoke some shisha, drink some tea and eat some delicious baklava. Go for the set shisha menus as they're great value.",UNK
6504,It is close to the hotel and convenient.  It fulfills food needs and in a tasty fashion.  But compared to other sushi places it is ok.  Let's leave it at that.,UNK
6505,"Attended Mass last weekend.  It's held in a building that resembles a school meeting hall rather than a church.  It was a nice service.....friendly community.  I felt welcome here, however I prefer a more traditional church environment.\n\nReturn Factor - 50%",UNK
6506,I love burgers and when I get a craving I go to in-n-out the stroller you my number one spot to hit up late at night I haven't tried the one in California yet but I'm sure take just as good as they are,UNK
6507,"Too bad there isn't a zero star rating. Terrible service since I was not a regular! Was a walk in told it was an hour wait. Came back in an hour and was told some of their \""regular \"" customers changes their minds about services and we had to help them.",UNK
6508,Sorry! But Rio has bad buffets\nYes they may have a lot of selections but no floavor what so ever!\nI think it rank the bottom with The Vilage Seafood Buffet of the all the Buffet of Buffet!,UNK
6509,I've been using Automated for a few years now and they have provided us with great solutions and service.  If your looking to automate your digital lifestyle give them a try.,UNK
6510,Stay away from here. I spent $14.00 for a margarita in the rocks with salt because if a shot if gran mariner.  sucks very commercialized. 1 out of 5 stars,UNK
6511,"Thanks to the yelpers for reviews and tips.  This place is small but the food was beyond my expectation.  Duck fried rice was as good as they say, duck curry was thai as expected, and the pad thai was tasty and fresh.  For lunch and a bargin price, i will be back",UNK
6512,Living it up in Charlotte!\n\nGood dirty martini. Good olives. \n\nThanks for enabling me to enjoy a drink on the way to the airport with less than an hour to spare.\n\nCan you imagine this in manhattan? Nah,UNK
6513,Ordering food here is extremely difficult. ....they do not pay attention to detail! They have same ordering proplem at all locations on their machine...ive complained for years,UNK
6514,Great food. We had the scallops and the Tagliatelli with short ribs...and a nice Shiraz....yum. Perfect ending to the weekend!,UNK
6515,"This is a nice Fry's. The staff are all very friendly. Avoid going during the day if you want to avoid the old people (nothing against old people, but too many of them and you're gonna have a bad time).",UNK
6516,"I've had waaaay better sandwiches. It's perfect for the late night \""smokers\"" that don't care about what the food taste like as it is shoveled into their face eyes closed.",UNK
6517,"Typical British pub. The most memorable thing about this place was how BAD the steak and mushroom pie was - yuck! Perhaps it's just not my type of food but the flavor was so appalling I could barely eat it, I ended up leaving the pub hungry!",UNK
6518,Has to be the best fast food I have had!. Chicken is hand breaded to order and the fries are sooo fresh. Can definitely say that I wont be eating fast food anywhere else for a long time. Damn good deal!!!!!!,UNK
6519,"Great to see Danny back up and running! It's everything I'd except with a few culinary surprises that were great additions! Simple, fresh and absolutely tasty Mexican food!",UNK
6520,"Absolutely amazing food. Our server was Amanda, she was unbelievably attentive, especially for how busy they were, and extremely sweet to my children. It was our first time there and I already can't wait to go back!",UNK
6521,"Extremly Dissapointed, I came to this place thinking it was truly the best place in Vegas but its not even close to Good. Don't Waist your Money.",UNK
6522,Yeah I hate the window chip repair people that follow you. I am as rude to them as they are to me. \n\nThe key to get your money's worth is to go only when they are not busy!!!  The inside staff and the finish staff are very nice and helpful most of the time.,UNK
6523,After arriving in Vegas I was driving by and I had seen this hotel casino with a Dennys on Orbitz. Stopped in for breakfast. The food was decent but the waiter never refilled my coffee would have liked to have one more cup,UNK
6524,I ate here for lunch since I had a free coupon.   Seriously nasty.  Think Golden Corral.  EW!  Salad bar saved the day.,UNK
6525,"Walmart, what are you thinking?   You match everyone's price, it's a blast at the checkouts with all the ads from other stores.   This store is clean and quick to get in and out of.    All the cashiers are smiling and ready to help.",UNK
6526,"This place is quite close to the strip. Nice noodles and great new kinds of spring rolls! :) i always visit here for my vegas trip, especially in the morning after the crazy night",UNK
6527,I never bought before i usually walk though the store. I went in and worked with Jeremiah a new salesman as his store manager told me. A true customer orientated salesman/designer. We did make a purchase over the weekend & would again with him. New manager seemed nice too.,UNK
6528,I love Best Buy. Staff is knowledgable and friendly the only bad thing is you leave with your little heart broken.. So many gadgets and goodies.,UNK
6529,"Nice place. Met some new friends at the bar, and owner is very friendly. Meat and cheese plate is excellent. Beer list is hearty, although a bit mainstream for the craft beer aficionado. Happy hour is a great deal, and it's a welcome addition to the neighborhood.",UNK
6530,"The best around can't beat the prices,  friendly service, very clean, I go by whenever possible! If you want a sandwich or a snack, gas or even a car wash, go by,  they even have crushed ice for soft drinks!",UNK
6531,"Onolicious! Worth driving out to and waiting for!!  Love the concept, too! The freshness and made-to-order dishes were definitely noticeable!  Woke up my palate!",UNK
6532,"They are kind of hidden in Scottsdale Quarters upstairs next to Tanzy and iPic, so don't give up when looking for them!",UNK
6533,"they do all catering needs in this area...very professional and they are always on their \""A\"" game...great set-up and presentation...good selection of food...reasonable and competative pricing",UNK
6534,WOW! This place made me love Indian food.  I had three entrees with my husband and all were good.  I can't wait to go for the lunch buffet to try different things!  The staff was friendly and the place was clean and well pressed.,UNK
6535,"This is the place to go for some great atmosphere and drinks the size of your head. They cost a little extra, but just get the double, its worth the jar. Live band and dancers. Great time.",UNK
6536,WORST TACO PLACE !!!!! First off the cook told me to F off because they didn't serve beer. On top of  that they place was really dirty and the cashier kept talking to her friend while I was trying to order,UNK
6537,"Overall this place is pretty good! I usually walk down here to get a sandwich on my lunch break. The meatball sandwich is pretty good! Also the employees are super friendly, very laid back environment, and they talk to you like they've known you forever. Great atmosphere!",UNK
6538,"Where's the beef? Very little beef on the sandwich.  Got the Philly with Am. Cheese sandwich. The cheese was over-melted, you could not tell if it had cheese on it. No peppers and very little onions on this sandwich.",UNK
6539,Best comedy show we've seen in Vegas by far! There was a little of everything from awesome acrobatics to skits and audience interaction. VERY entertaining! We'd go again if the opportunity arises!,UNK
6540,"Tuvalu is just ok. \n\nThe positive: cool vibe, small child's play area, local artwork, live music.\n\nThe negative: Service is a bit off sometimes, food is good but not excellent.",UNK
6541,"Pros:comfortable bed, Great price 31per night, location, high energy casino, free parking. \n\nCons: dirty bathroom with leaking faucet, rooms on Fremont side very loud. AC is loud, our room was basic with no chair to sit in.",UNK
6542,"Mushroom & Gruyere Burger was very good tasting but that's all you got on the burger. No tomatoes, onion, lettuce, or sauce, etc.",UNK
6543,Dr. Dachs and everyone at Thompson Peak Family Dental rock!\n\nThey are top-notch.\n\nI give them an unconditional recommendation.,UNK
6544,"The people in front were extremely rude. They told me there was hip hop. My bathroom is literally bigger then their \""hip hop room\"" over priced drinks and shitty bartenders.",UNK
6545,"Food,staff & service all very very poor.interiors very depressing.u are better of cooking Indian food at home it will turn out better than anything served at this place",UNK
6546,"The Vdara valet damaged my friend's car, and they were not helpful at all. They didn't try to resolve the issue, and only did their best to fight against us. The customer service really needs a huge improvement before I would consider staying here again.",UNK
6547,My favorite Las Vegas sushi place! Their DD roll is awesome and so is their service! Only draw back is their prices... it's worth it for the quality though!,UNK
6548,"Tried a slice of strawberry cake. The whip cream frosting was nice and light with a dense vanilla cake. There was a very small selection of desserts to choose from. Overall the dessert was nice, not too sweet, but could have used more strawberries.",UNK
6549,"I have been here a bunch of times.\nEach time, I don't pay at all.\nI will only come back if I get dragged here again.\nRain is okay, but it is not one of my favorite clubs in Vegas.",UNK
6550,"I loved this place! If we go back to Vegas, we will definitely stop here. It's small, but the food was good. My fiance ordered the \""personal\"" pizza, but it could have easily fed three of us!",UNK
6551,"It's pricy, but really really good!! They do a great take out packaging and I'm so glad they're in ballantyne....",UNK
6552,"Best bras ever! Love all of their stuff. Not too much of a fan as far as their scents and makeup are concerned, but their underwear and bras are awesome!",UNK
6553,"Food is fantastic, service can be anywhere from good to horrible. If you're leery of hipster service, this place may reinforce that opinion.",UNK
6554,The food was good like always but the service was ridiculously slow. The Resturant was dead (not many customers) and our waitress took waaaaay too long to do everything,UNK
6555,By far best pita bread you will taste in this town. All of their meat plates are spectacular and the falafel is my personal favorite. Gyro meat will melt in your mouth. I highly suggest this to try.,UNK
6556,"When the food came to the table and It was freezing cold, and we were served by someone who clearly didn't want to be there. The Louisiana style fries were cold and dry, and the whole meal was just awful.",UNK
6557,"Lobsters are big, crabs are big, shrimps are spicy, what more can I say, I got the flavor lingering in my mouth for a couple of days. The only issue is the price! I may come next time at a better season for seafood!",UNK
6558,Man do I love Dennys!! A perfect cheep alternative breakfast instead of going to an expensive buffet or one of the Hotels restaurants. Located right on the strip by MGM and across from NY NY. \n\nIf you making the trip to Sin City and a breakfast lover on a budget. I suggest hitting up this spot.,UNK
6559,"Our driver was on time, but the inside of the cab reeked of cigarettes and was filthy. :(\n\nI probably will not use them again next time I'm in the area.",UNK
6560,Corned beef sandwich was good. The bread held up and the meat was tender and flavorful. Not too salty. Loved the pickles :D It was a little over $10 for a drink and sandwich.,UNK
6561,"Cool concept, but way too pricey and they take too long. It's like Panda Express, but instead of paying $5-$6 for a combo, I paid $20 and had to wait for a half hour. Keep walking by when you see this place and save yourself the money!",UNK
6562,No free refills on soda.  Rude employees.  Who doesnt have free refills on soda?  Sandwich meat dry.   Unremarkable.  Many other choices nearby....will stick to those.,UNK
6563,Not very good for lunch a couple weeks ago. Chicken was bone dry and the service was just 2 or 3 servers watching tv until they noticed my empty cup on the edge of the table.,UNK
6564,"Gluten-free, vegan pizza. Friendly, helpful staff. Exciting topping options like shiitake mushrooms and zucchini. Awesome. The crust was a little overcooked.",UNK
6565,"This place rocks! 50cent drafts an $1 bottled of pbr on Thursday nights! And their chicken is awesome. I usually get the half clucker with steak fries, that stuff's the bomb!",UNK
6566,"Laid back place (well, we were there for happy hour) with a good beer list. Some bartenders were especially nice, others just kinda talked to their friends at the bar. I'd come here again for happy hour!",UNK
6567,"I have always enjoyed coming to this casino.  However, on my last visit, I had a horrible time.  The show defending the caveman sucked and I lost 200 bones on the let it ride table.  On the table, the dealer was not shuffling the cards properly.....I cannot believe the management would allow this.",UNK
6568,They charge for ranch when you order fried zucchini's. Its about the principal not the money.there prices are high enough to give a lil side of ranch seriously. The original lenny on 1-17 and glendale does not charge if you order a special appetizer.,UNK
6569,"Awesome... I just had the home made cheese sticks, accompanied with the Stone Porter Beer, followed by the Baked Alaskan Halibut Oscar... Not only am I a pig tonight, but a very happy man.",UNK
6570,"Food is good, portion size is good, several good options for appetizers, main course and dessert, but can be pretty pricey.",UNK
6571,"I liked this place. If you want a place to sit, at all, you have to get a bottle.  We didn't as it was absurdly expensive.  But the patio was cool and the music was good.  It's a decent place to stop by before or after another place.",UNK
6572,"Got a living Social Deal and showed up, but it it CLOSED. Thanks to the owners not paying rent. The landlord put a sign on the door. Needless to say not impressed.",UNK
6573,"Its a great place to have AYCE, friendly staff and comfortable atmosphere. Sushi rolls are juicy enough to be drooling;)) the only reason not to give it 5 star is there nothing like special special about this place comparing to others. Anyways its a good place!!!",UNK
6574,Apparently Circus Circus is working on remodeling their hotel towers. Let's hope the updates and upgrades will improve the mediocrity they currently hold.,UNK
6575,"They have found themselves another regular customer!\n\nNot only is the customer service great at this place, but they know how to get the job done quick and professionally so that you can can get in, get out, and go on throughout your day with no problem. Hands down the auto maintenance service I have ever experienced!",UNK
6576,Great place!  I enjoy it every time I stop in.  The food and service have always been on par!  Thanks Tony Saccos!,UNK
6577,"I loved this place! Water is clean, the dogs loved it. They have hoses do you can wash off your dogs right there.",UNK
6578,"My mother and I have gone here regularly for years.  The service is nice, take out is convenient and the food has never disappointed us. This is a solid Chinese restaurant with comfortable, cozy seating in a small single room if you want to dine in too.",UNK
6579,Crust was doughy and where were the toppings??  Will never it Papa John's again.  YUCK!!!!,UNK
6580,The only reason to visit Cameron Toll is its Sainsbury's.\n\nOther than that it feels like it's dying on its feet.,UNK
6581,"Service was great but drinks and prices were horrible.  Mojito and margarita were served in plastic cups with more ice than drink, paid eleven each for lunch time.  Nachos were great but wasn't exactly how we ordered.  Probably wouldn't come to this one again..I'll stick with the locations I know and trust.",UNK
6582,"Slooooooow, and they are very very unorganized. Avoid like the black plague!!! You have been warned.",UNK
6583,"Not the best burger by any means, but passale   Horrendous setup by the drink machine almost impossible to get by because it is so crowded and tiny aisle to go past",UNK
6584,"My husband and I was walking around MGM and Signature looking for something besides Starbucks and we stumbled upon this place, The skillet breakfast with toast and fruit and a cup of coffee was just what we needed and very filling.",UNK
6585,"Facility OK.  Shipping is horrible.  Bring on the Brown.  While the place is OK for copies and such,  Fedex shipping is worse than the post office.  Slow and often laden with problems.  UPS from now own",UNK
6586,"Came here for a quick bite and beer.  Nachos were great, wings were pretty good, and the pizza was excellent.  Family friendly, lots of TVs, lots of sports.  I'll be back for sure.",UNK
6587,"After reading the reviews that the food was so food we ordered a pizza.  It was greasy, very salty and the order was wrong.  Will not go back.",UNK
6588,"Elegant cabin feel, great and friendly service, wonderful bar design, corn muffins, prime rib baked in salt, and countless number of specials who couldn't ask for a better place to dine!",UNK
6589,"I think they put crack in the guacamole, its so damn addicting. \n\nOther than that, its nothing special.",UNK
6590,"I wasn't overly impressed with DSW this time. Not sure if they just didn't have a good selection at this time or if it was just the location. Also, I was in the store for about 30 minutes and nobody asked if I needed any help.",UNK
6591,Meh... That definitely describes it and especially compared to some other EPL locations I've been to. Not too friendly and the food wasn't too hot along with an empty salsa bar.,UNK
6592,"Best hot dogs in town!  Disapointed in the new hours. They are only open Fri and Sat nights now and closed on Sunday. I think its a mistake, now there usually closed when I come to the movies there.",UNK
6593,"My tire was losing air so I decided to check this place out as it was close to home. I was greeted immediately and my car checked out within a few minutes. It turns out that I had a small nail and they promptly fixed it as a courtesy free of charge. Great service, friendly staff and nice, comfortable waiting area. Highly recommended.",UNK
6594,"Too much of a play and not enough circus. I've seen 2 traveling Cirque shows that blows this out of the water. Besides the peg wall and the end where the guy is running on the ball, this show is very boring. I fell asleep 2 different times and the other 3 people I was with were extremely disappointed.",UNK
6595,"Hey! This is pretty good stuff. Fast and tastes less greasy than the other \""Ricos\"". I love the grande nachos!!! A lot!!!",UNK
6596,Never waist you time going there the service is rude the woman on the front doesn't know how to talk to people she's very stupid she need to learn how to keep her conments to her self better places around town with better services and better food and prices,UNK
6597,I really like this particular Starbucks!\n\nStaff is very friendly and very efficient. \n\nVery busy store especially after 3:00 in the afternoon.,UNK
6598,- Reasonably priced eateries and shopping.  \n- Central location on the Strip.\n- Haven for NYE (New Year's Eve) to get in from the cold for a little.,UNK
6599,"We used our discount coupon that we bought at Homerun.com to try Bombay Spice Grill.  It was wonderful! Food was delicious, reasonably priced and healthy. The service was great...very friendly.  It was a great experience and we will definitely go back there.",UNK
6600,Waited 30 minutes for a burrito. With no lines and four people working. They forgot my order. Avoid this place at all cost if you want quality service,UNK
6601,"Clean tasting fish, nothing special. Don't really plan on going back. Very overrated. Last visit, they ran out of almost everything and it was only 2pm.",UNK
6602,I'm a fan of both of these locations. It is my special stop for gluten-free pizza pickup. Many healthy allergy-friendly food solutions. The salads are also delicious! The staff is courteous and the place is always buzzing lunch and dinner time.,UNK
6603,"I had the most wonderful meal tonight....highly recommend you try this place.  The staff was warm and friendly.  The prices are reasonable/fair.  I had the pate chaud, Golden vermicilli, cheese cake and a hot mumbai spirit.  I WILL be back for more!",UNK
6604,"This explains my disappointment...If they are busy -service, quality, & everything falls apart...\n\nhttp://www.jrn.com/ktnv/news/dirty-dining/Dirty-Dining-Kahunaville-278585471.html",UNK
6605,"All-you-can-eat sushi for $23.95.  \""Cozy\"" AKA cramped environment inside. Service a bit slow because it was so crowded. \n\nThe No Name roll is the best!!  The Mochi ice cream for dessert is highly recommended and delicious!!",UNK
6606,"Stumbled across this little place while looking for a quick place for breakfast on our way out of town.  Unexpectedly, they make the best cheesy grits I've had in the north! Seems like a busy local favorite.",UNK
6607,"they are not consistent with their serving , evry crew has its own way of making menu.. not going here anymore! the service is good but the quality of food is horrible!",UNK
6608,"I signed up for yelp just so I could leave this review.\n\nThis is the worst denny's i've ever been to.!service was poor and slow, and 4/7 of my groups orders were messed up in one way or another.",UNK
6609,"Rooms small (apart from one or two fantastic suites). All a bit tired now.\nFull of american coach parties.\nOh.. and they play \""highland music\"" over breakfast.  I think that says everything that needs to be said.",UNK
6610,"Never call them for an order.\nThe guy i called for order was rude and impolite .\nI am writing this review even before tasting the food, the guy on the phone go me really worked up. I am saying this even though i am an Indian, Staff at Indian restaurants can be a total ass!",UNK
6611,"Used to go from Sky Harbor to CJ when visiting PHX. Now that we live here, it has gone to quite mediocre. Still has big portions but the beef tastes more like your typical frozen fare",UNK
6612,"Easily put, a WAY better alternative to Filiberto's  when craving late night mexican food. They have a wide range of the typical mexican fast food and drinks.",UNK
6613,"Went three times. Wanted to like it but just couldn't. Pizza was bland. Pasta sauce was tasteless. Chicken Vesuvio sauce was way too oily, chicken was a little overcooked, and I just couldn't bring myself to like that it was served with smashed potatoes.",UNK
6614,"Great place for fresh seafood or at least many of the choices are fresh daily. We had a very attentive server. The swordfish was excellent as was my sea bass.  Easy to get to from the Casa Grande area, just about a 40 minute drive fro here.",UNK
6615,I have known Ally at Saskia Salon for many years. Ally recently did my hair and it was fabulous!! She is so talented and up to date on all the latest trends. They have a wonderful line of hair products which I highly recommend. Go enjoy a day of beauty by Ally or anyone on their team!,UNK
6616,So far. So good. I had a 12 appoint mention and they took me in right away. I just went to get a estimate of the damage and to see if I can get a check right away.,UNK
6617,It's popcorn how can you go wrong? Well you can....pricing and taste.  Oh well better luck next time.,UNK
6618,"I love coming here. Their all you can eat sushi and tapas is worth the price. They have amazing tapas like bulgogi, steam pork belly fish cake soup. Their sushi is fresh and you receive your food quick. They are sister restaurants with tofu hut.",UNK
6619,"This is the best deli sandwich in the Green Valley area.  Jan and Mr. Marino is genuine owners who do work the restaurant.  The portions are for the hungry man, the working man and my favorite is the Marino's Special cold sandwich.  The trick is Bob's is a luncheon and not open during the weekends.",UNK
6620,"This is one of the best places in Pittsburgh if you like East European food. I have been to Poland and this deli makes authentic delicious food.  Anything you order is good, but I prefer the cheese pierogies and sauerkraut pierogies. The halushkj is also great.  Take home some Wawel chocolate for dessert!",UNK
6621,"Nice small little theater conveniently located in Palms Casino. Strobe lights line up the theater halls, comfortable seats. Check in on yelp and get 2 tickets with popcorn and drinks for $22, which is a great bargain.",UNK
6622,"Had the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict. Delicious. Just don't try to eat one by yourself. If you can consume the whole thing w/o any help, you may have an eating disorder.",UNK
6623,"Great salsa, bean dip, and menu selection. The spinach enchilada was delicious. Didn't get to try there home brew. I would return",UNK
6624,"Great falafel! Hummus was absolutely delicious, service was great very clean place . We will be back to try more.",UNK
6625,"Went here with family. \nVery busy restaurant, the food was decent, nothing special.\nCustomer service was ok, some were rude.\nPineapple buns are bomb!\nThe parking sucked.",UNK
6626,"Food great, pricing a bit high with so much competition for ghetto mex I was expecting.  Food good, ambiance nice, service GREAT!  I guess the deal is the quality is better, thus the higher price.  I personally would go back if they had a bit better pricing.",UNK
6627,"Always a MUST before and during walking the malls.  ;-)\nGotta get the extra shots in the drinks or a little weak and some can be very sweet.\nUpdate:  The drinks seem less octane now and overly sweet, the extra shot tasted like rubbing alcohol.  :-(",UNK
6628,"Not too bad.   I had Rib Tips, Ribs, sliced Brisket & Links. Mac & Cheese Potato Salad & Beans  \nThe best part was the Ribs & Beans.  I got a lot if food for the price.  The staff was real courteous",UNK
6629,I do like the interior design of this place. But the crowd seem kind of old for my taste. The dance floor seems small but this place is good for dates I think.,UNK
6630,My gf sent me as a treat and it was the worst massage ever. I left before finishing the 90 minutes. I probably feel better massaging myself. So very disappointed.,UNK
6631,"This place is scary. Their portions are huge and the food looks scary. Look at my pictures, we ordered alien babies or something. I think its  ruben sandwich and an omelet. Yucky..and it tasted gross.",UNK
6632,"This hotel is very kid friendly with the \""fun dungeon\"" and jousting show\nThe arcade games are a bit pricy and the show is expensive. The room are ok they are very small and the beds aren't that comfortable this hotel is definitely just a place to sleep not to hang out it",UNK
6633,"Cheap wings on tues & thurs. That's basically what this place is good for. Wings are decent, many sauce options and everything else is typical bar food",UNK
6634,"It seems that others have had problems with deliveries, however I have only picked up orders here before. Pizzas have been quickly made and ready by the time I arrived. The quality and pizza prices are right-down-the-road average in my opinion. I would recommend trying it sometime.",UNK
6635,Not too bad. Got the meatball sub. Nothing really making me fiend to come back tho. Overall 3 stars for the complimentary soft serve.,UNK
6636,I just came here for sodas and water. My last trip was disappointing due to the advertisement for certain products and prices not matching the ads. Its a nice store and easy access from 7th St or the lights on Bell but the parking can get hectic.,UNK
6637,"Sushi good - but nothing special or creative. Appetizers and small plates are very good. Happy hour specials bring us in, although they aren't as good as they used to be. Mediocre to poor service. A lot of activity - people watching place.",UNK
6638,please please please get the breaded steak sandwich back..from Chicago and really miss Ricobenes..yours was actually better!!!Papa Geo's used to sell one and they went out of business...,UNK
6639,"I wanted to try this place for the all-you-can-eat sushi, but found you have to sit at the bar and there was limited seating.  At least the waiter mentioned that the undersized food was family style.  The service was all right, but I left feeling dissatisfied due to the overpriced food.",UNK
6640,"Holly Jackson is a fantastic stylist! Being new to Las Vegas, I feel so grateful to have found her. She cut and gave body to my fine, wavy hair.  She is personable, professional and very knowledgable about maintaining healthy hair. I highly recommend her.",UNK
6641,I was expecting it to be better. I got a brownie and a cream puff and both were average. I've had better at a supermarket. I love cake boss so I was hoping this would be good. I'll just stick to the cupcakery for my baked goods.,UNK
6642,Great steak!  Poor service.   \n\nPeople go where they're invited... They come back where they're appreciated.  \n\nNot sure if I'll be back.,UNK
6643,Came in to try on dresses for my daughters wedding. Had an appointment and the girl didn't even attend to me!! Poor customer service... And to think the Tucson location was 10x's better in helping out oh and the place was very dusty ... Very disappointed,UNK
6644,Hands down the best ramen in town! I go here at least once a week to get my ramen fix. And the prices can't be beat. One Sapporo and a bowl of ramen is always less than $15 (not including a well deserved tip). Fast and friendly service every time,UNK
6645,"Cash only. It's a bit pricey for crepes, but it's great to have the restaurant to fulfill crepe cravings :)",UNK
6646,"Do not rent from Avis! Charged for picking up car 29 minutes early at an hourly rate of 61.50. Wanted to turn car in one hour late and told I'd have to pay that rate. That's unacceptable, and customer service rep. unbendable even with extenuating circumstances.",UNK
6647,Great pizza! I had the Rocco's wild white buffalo chicken garlic sauce. The fried Mac and cheese bites were a great starter and super cheesy! Our server was great very friendly,UNK
6648,Place is cheap compared to the strip. I've had better thai but not bad for vegas.  Place is very small and not so clean.  50 / 50 on coming back.,UNK
6649,"My husband and I love The Mirage Spa.  We always enjoy our treatments, especially the mani/pedi.  Too bad they don't offer a \""Couples mani/pedi\"" with chocolate covered strawberries and champagne like other spots do, but hey, it's okay.",UNK
6650,This is the second time my husband and I have eaten here and it is fabulous.  It's very clean and the food is fresh and delicious.  We've come for breakfast burritos both times and can't wait to come back for dinner.  You've got to try it.,UNK
6651,Terrific experience! These guys were slammed and took not only our party of eight... But created a separate table for the kids and made them feel extra special. We had a wonderful time in the food and service was excellent!,UNK
6652,"I have eaten quite a few Italian meals around Charlotte, since I arrived in 1993.  Today I had lunch here for the first time.  It was without reservation the best Italian that I have had in town!  I am already planning my next visit, so that I can work my way through the complete menu.  See ya there!!",UNK
6653,"Had a great time with my beautiful wife. First date since our anniversary last year. Grandma watched the baby which allowed us to have some freedom and stay out late. Bottle of wine, sushi, perfect!\n\nA little cold and way too bright in the main dining area. Overall though a good night.",UNK
6654,"I was hesitant after seeing the reviews. I was pleasantly surprised however. Service was great. Food was very good. \n\nSara the waitress was very helpful. She made recommendations and helped with a custom request.\n\nBurger , rueben, honey chicken sandwich.",UNK
6655,"OVERPRICED for what you get on the plate...plus, Mexican food just tastes better when the place plays more \""cultural\"" music is decorated acoordingly",UNK
6656,"The bread they use at this place it out of this world. The meat on the sandwiches are super juicy and for being on the strip the price is Awesome. Also check out \""Fresh Grill and Bar\"" which is just a few shops down (also a greeaat deal)",UNK
6657,"Loved the ambiance. The calamari was delicious and the portion was huge for an appetizer, you must share it. The dinner portions were average, but delicious. You must order the seafood linguini.",UNK
6658,"Great place to go for a quick breakfast.  It's set up like Pei Wei, so easy to order and find a seat.  Food was really good and came out fast!  I'd recommend to anyone.",UNK
6659,Service was slow because of the crowd there to see the fight. Food was served lukewarm and it was difficult to get condiments or even napkins. Will have to give them another chance the next time I'm in Charlotte.,UNK
6660,This DQ sucks!!! Lazy teens working there. Went on Wednesday night and they are out of chocolate ice cream??? You sell ice cream how the hell do you run out? Or are you lazy and not want to make more. I hope this one closes down it's a waste of time and space.,UNK
6661,A new neighborhood gem! I shared a Glendale burger and the pulled pork sandwich with the significant other and both were amazing! Every sandwich/burger can be lettuce wrapped for a healthy alternative- which is super nice.,UNK
6662,BLT cooks their burgers MEDIUM unless otherwise requested.  If your server still asks how you want it cooked don't let this fool you stick with Medium you will not regret it.  If you really love crispy onion rings them order them here.,UNK
6663,"Second time at Cafe Monarch. First time GREAT. Second time: same atmosphere, good service, more tables, but of the two entre choices (veal chop or shrimp cake) the shrimp cake was not very tasty and the veal chop was sold out. Although we were pretty disappointed we will try it again.",UNK
6664,"Finally got a chance to eat here. Food is delish, like others have mentioned. I had the Furikake Chicken and hubby had the Bento B plate. Both tasty and tender.",UNK
6665,Very pricey.  Small amount of lobster in all the dishes we tried.  Large portions of bread  to make up for it.  The food is tasty just no where near enough lobster.  Cute gimmick just won't satisfy your need for shellfish,UNK
6666,"Most know Rosati's for pizza and take out, but they have so much more including an eat in dinning room.  There pizza is great, but you also need to try the ribs and fries, chicago hot dogs, and pastas.  They have dinning room specials every night that are an incredible deal!",UNK
6667,"It's a pool supply store.   I usually don't go to these places, but I was trying to get a solar blanket for my pool....I had all the blue prints, but still not enough info!  Really!   Dammmm it, I have to go back again!",UNK
6668,"Came here for company event where everything was free.  So my review is basically of the club layout.  I liked the tiered seating and standing layout.  The decor reminded of the Confetti nightclub in Sacramento circa 1986, which really isn't that cool in 2013.",UNK
6669,This place is my favorite place in Vegas.. I  go for the food and the drinks as the service is always fast and excellent. Sat most at the bar and drank electric lemonade and please try the Cornbread and maple butter as its just ACE..,UNK
6670,"Great lunch, brunch or \""go\u00fbter\"" option. Many combos including amazing fresh juices. Worth a visit! We need those type of business to stay in business!",UNK
6671,Got some ribs from here a few weeks ago and was very disappointed.  The place came highly recommended and did not come close to delivering.  Meal deals are priced way to high for the quality of the product.  Would not go back...,UNK
6672,What a bargain! The food is delicious and prices are outstanding. One of their specials today was Jalape\u00f1o Pork. That was outstanding. Staff very friendly and sweet. Thanks!,UNK
6673,"Absolutely incredible!  Not only does Garrett do great work, but his pricing is incredible too.  Never looked forward to getting my carpets done in the past, but now I have him on auto schedule lol.  Thanks so much for doing such a great job every time!  Oh and don't forget they do car upholstery and tile too!",UNK
6674,Ate here and saw the Dandy Warhols here. Dinning experience was mediocre. Venue for concert was pretty damm good!,UNK
6675,Oh now they've done it; added live music on select weekends! I didn't think it could get any better but it did (-:,UNK
6676,"Food is really authentic and tasty. The fried rice comes with so many veggies and meat, and the orange chicken is always hot and fresh, never dry. Staff is friendly and have quick service",UNK
6677,My favourite pizza delivery service - I love the pizzas and they are delivered usually within about 20 mins.  When you order online you also get a text letting you know that your pizza is on its way.,UNK
6678,"Irish Whiskey gelato, need I say more. Yum!!! However, I am only giving 3 stars because I was sold a bad gift card that didn't work and had to wait an excessive amount if time to get it fixed. My gelato was melting...booo!",UNK
6679,"the chips may well be the only thing worth going here for\n\nbut the salsa,\nnot so good\n\nperhaps the expensive booze and cheap women are a draw?",UNK
6680,The roboworld and the miniture railroad were the only exibits worth seeing... the rest of the building was pretty boring.  Everything is ratty and dirty... make sure you bring lots of hand sanitizer.,UNK
6681,"Good, not great.  If you want a good burger this is the place.  You want a better one go a little further west on Camelback ;  ). I live near by so I will go once a month.  Wings are excellent, I'd give them 4 stars just on their wings.",UNK
6682,Love the original owners. Use to go here every week but then stopped once they switched owners.....the food became so greasy. Not anymore!!!! The original owners are back and it's so yummy!!!! Made me and my hubby happy. Welcome back!,UNK
6683,"A very small place, only can fit about 16 people in their dinning room. Customer service isn't in their agenda. Had to wait about 15mins until someone eventually came up where I can get their attention to place an order BUT their food is amazing. Definitely made up for the lack of customer service.",UNK
6684,"This location is terrible. Poor management, slow service and young kids working that don't have a clue about customer service. Whoever hired the people here is to blame. Never coming back. Also, when your buying overpriced bagels, you shouldn't have to wait 10 minutes in line when there is nobody in the drivethru.",UNK
6685,"My favorite buffet in Vegas because of the best selection of gelato, well-seasoned Korean Kalbi, and medium rare sirloin steak. For $34 brunch not bad at all!",UNK
6686,Delicious!!! We were in vegas and Friends that live there took us here for breakfast I want sure about it by it's looks but I loved it the ham was delicious and the pancakes everything I will definetly go back,UNK
6687,"This is not authentic Chinese food, it's American food with Chinese sounding names. If you like Panda Express, you'll like Pei Wei",UNK
6688,Every time I go to this place it gets worse and worse. I remember going there a few years back and really liking the menu but these days they have changed a few things and the several items I have tried have all been mediocre at best. I will not be going back to Charleston's or recommending this restaurant to anyone.,UNK
6689,Sandwich is dry... I will stick to Jimmy Johns... Got fooled by the $4 lunch special...,UNK
6690,"Wow! Everything about e was amazing. From the service to the drinks to every delicious morsel of food I stuffed in my body. Great dining experience, very intimate and interesting. Highly recommend this to any \""foodie\"" out there who appreciates trying new foods and experiences!",UNK
6691,"No problems here. Car choice was pretty good, no lines, out in 8 minutes. \n\nOn return charges were EXACTLY as quoted online. To the penny.",UNK
6692,"Good place to go see a movie, only $7 matinee, not as good of a place to eat. The buffet is lackluster at best, something as simple as bread pudding lacks the flavor you would find in other buffets.",UNK
6693,"Bagels are wonderful if made properly, the girl with long brown hair is a B****\nthey don't wash or use gloves after working with money,i've already called the health district on them, nvr will go back",UNK
6694,"Have been there several times, one time after the oil change, I smelled out....  Opened the hood the oil cap was left off.   The last time noticed oil dripping from under my car, the oil filter was very loose after 300 miles.   Two strikes and your out.",UNK
6695,"Aside from the terrible coffee, everything else was pretty decent.  The manager hooked me up with a seat on new years eve.  I saw Kid Rock there -- I think he was scheduled to hang at Jet that night.",UNK
6696,"Nigiri tasting menu was excellent, price for fatty tuna is actually 1/4th what you would pay on the strip at 6-7$ each, and higher quality to boot!",UNK
6697,I love mushroom soup and this place did not let me down. We ended up getting a few small plates each to try a little of everything and they were all worthy of a 4-star rating.,UNK
6698,"Came on a Friday night and had a great time.  They had live music (free!) and the overall vibe was fun and relaxed.  They also have a lot of different local beers on tap, ranging from $5 to $10 each.",UNK
6699,I was NOT a fan of this place. At 1st I thought hey cool place but quickly changed my mind. The bowling sucks because you have to pay for the hour and then you get kicked off your lane. The drinks were terrible I guess the waitress said something was wrong with the lines. Nope nope not coming back here. Waste of money.,UNK
6700,"Like an Ihop or Denny's inside Monte Carlo, but not as good. Not expensive, but we should of went to the food court that was around the corner, better price and probably more appetizing.",UNK
6701,Best deal in the plateau. Get the half or quarter chicken plate. The chicken is juicy and they fill your box to the top with fries. I swear the woman who serves you is a saint. Call ahead to avoid the line. Also if you go before two it comes with free dessert.,UNK
6702,"This is the same format as the normal Kohl's, but the merchandise was set up a little messy especially in the accessories area.  =(",UNK
6703,Bob is great.  His wife Beth answers when you make appointments and she is very nice and helpful. They have installed outside lighting and run coax for me and did a terrific job.  They have reasonable rates and are very personable and professional. I highly recommend them if you need electrical work for your home.,UNK
6704,"Fuddruckers in the casino has better coffee. This place is Starbucks everything, but not called Starbucks possibly because the people don't care, the muffins are stale and the coffee is burnt.",UNK
6705,"Beware they do not sanitize their tools.  After they are done they put the tools back in the bag and \""seal\"" it again so when the next customer comes in they think the tools are clean and unused.  Never coming back here again!",UNK
6706,"Just o.k.  I am not sure if my expectations were outweighing the experience, but that was the way I felt.... calamari was good, the lobster was good.... didn't have dessert as we went over to jean phillip instead.",UNK
6707,"They've remodeled but now there's less food and it's still all bland and cold. Even though it's cheap $6.99 for dinner. It still sucks, Never anything new and the service is iffy at best. Holidays are really bad.",UNK
6708,"Small boutique shop near Southpark. Helpful staff. Small, but interesting selection. This is the kind of place where you can find a cool, one-of-a-kind piece of clothing for a casual night out. Jewelry, jeans, and other accessories.",UNK
6709,"This place is terrible.  Service took forever, manager was a jerk, and security was a bunch of meatheads that thought they were awesome for being 30 and working at a bar.  Cool story bro, get a real job.",UNK
6710,Subway is decent for a quick and easy nosh.  I always get a turkey with spinach on wheat (now without yoga mat!) and it's a good light dinner.  The food is fresher than most fast food which is good and the low price is even better.,UNK
6711,The hotel itself is very nice. but it is at the end of the strip. The service was really slow. had issues with room service twice.,UNK
6712,"Driving down Central the other day I got the munchies mid morning.  I got a croissant sandwich.  The palce was clean, the service was pleasant, and my sandwich was cooked fresh.",UNK
6713,"This is one of the few things that I enjoyed in Phoenix.  Actually, there is nothing else except the baseball stadium, and lots of spring training stadia...otherwise, Phoenix sucks...A city?   I think not...",UNK
6714,"Thought we would check this out, when we walked in our ears were assaulted by music that was not the best for a dining experience, not sure what they are going for, but they missed out on our business",UNK
6715,we had a great server but we came with a whole soccer team and apparently the other server helping them can't do her job and the manager didn't seem too concerned with the poor service.,UNK
6716,After paying  $800 plus my brakes still squeak!  Went back and the guy told me it only squeaked once. I had video of it and he agreed to look at it again.  I don't think they did. Now it's really squeaky.,UNK
6717,Awful service. The employees and supervisors just act like they don't want to be there. Stood In line then cashier just leaves and supervisors and other employees just ignore you.,UNK
6718,"I have been eating here for years, people are great and I've never had a less-than-excellent plate! Great amount of food in the bento box!",UNK
6719,"Boy how things have changed.  The staff and menu are the same, but the way the food is prepared is completely different (not in a good way) and the service has become very slow.\n\nI'm not sure what happened, by I hope they get their act together.",UNK
6720,"generally okay place, a little overpriced for the settings:(  noisy and place is too small, not looking very neat... food portion is below average. maybe not again.",UNK
6721,this hotel has been there for a while.. I do think the interior is pretty old. The rooms are pretty small. The whole place is not my style.,UNK
6722,Visited yesterday for the first time. The sesame chicken and fried rice weren't good compared to Fortune Cookie II. The sushi on the other hand was delicious! I had the tempura crab roll. I'll definitely be going back for the sushi but not for anything else.,UNK
6723,Went for lunch got seated at a micro table .since I am 6'6 I asked for a bigger table I was told I would have to wait fifteen minutes despite there being ample seating at the counter. I left and went to bronze cafe my go to spot downtown. Mto is possibly to hip for me.,UNK
6724,"Very good home made cookies tried peanut butter, chocolate chip w/walnuts, brownie and oatmeal. I love Thrifty ice cream.",UNK
6725,"Why would you put your corporate office on yelp?  This screwed up my morning, was supposed to pick up donuts for the meeting when I pulled up to this location.  Pointless.",UNK
6726,"Went here for the first time yesterday, and I must say, this is the best Vietnamese restaurant in Chandler. The Tofu veggie Pho' was divine. Broth was wonderful, not too much sodium or 5 spice. Portions are generous and priced to sell! This will definitely become a weekly stop for anyone who tries it!!",UNK
6727,Me myself I give this place 5 stars! I went today for my fiance's birthday and we had\nA great experience here :) we went around 10 pm. The service was great \nAnd so was the food :) very chill place.,UNK
6728,Drais is by far the best place in Vegas now!  10000 times better than the old venue and the most fun I've had in Vegas in years.  Does not disappoint.,UNK
6729,Very welcoming staff with great service. The refried beans here are among the very best restaurant beans I have ever had. The chili rellenos are good. Overall very satisfied and will be back.,UNK
6730,Decided to give this place another shot and the food seems to have gotten better.. Maybe they just got a bad shipment of beef that day.. Check your supplier guys..,UNK
6731,Don't let the bad reviews scare you as they are about opening night. This is one of the best venues las vegas has especially downtown :),UNK
6732,Crappy steak. Not worth the +$40 steak that I got. The steak was burnt and not juicy even after asking for medium. Definitely will not go back.,UNK
6733,I live across the street pretty much and love me some pb but hate the parking lot in that little strip and can't say I like this one the best the food at this one is just ok. Love the peach tea though could drink it all the time.,UNK
6734,"Nice change of pace from Native New Yorker, but the food just isn't as good.  WAY too many smokers on the patio, so you can't enjoy the nice weather unless you are breathing in cancer fumes.  Saw pregnant woman drinking here, and question bartender ethics (she was actually double fisting a beer and wine).",UNK
6735,Love that they serve the only veggie poutine in the city! Hate the service!  The staff rushed us out when it wasn't crowded and they were the only rude people we encountered in Montreal.,UNK
6736,"It's alright, nothing special.  We had the Phoenix dog, Classic Cheese steak and a Coney dog.  Phoenix dog was a poor attempt at the Arizona famous Sonoran Hot dog.  Coney dog, well, was a very small but tasty dog.  The Cheese steak was good but not over the top.",UNK
6737,I don't get the obsession with this place. The tortillas are fresh but other than that everything is literally dripping in grease but not much flavor. Service is also slow considering it is set up as fast food. Plus any place that closes on Sunday gets an automatic loss of a star from me.,UNK
6738,Wow. Can't believe this location is closed. I was not aware that it had and tried to stop by to grab some lunch to take back to the office. What a disappointment.,UNK
6739,"Food was great but our server was horrible. Didn't check on us at all. . As we wanted to order more food. . No water refill.. waited a good 10 to 15 for our check. As servers/managers ourselves in the business, This was not acceptable & very disappointing.",UNK
6740,"Some of the best tacos I've tasted for the pice, has a restaurant feel, the smell of fresh chicken cooking, nothing seems to be processed, burritos are fat  and in good portions. I really enjoyed eating there",UNK
6741,"Got the coupon, tried the resturant. Burger was grainy, frys were mediocre, service was great. Will not be back.",UNK
6742,"McKoys is great !!! My coworkers and myself rarely miss a Thursday night there. We love the 50 cent wings but everything else is fantastic too. Great  food, great atmosphere, fantastic wait staff, sometimes the only problem is finding a parking space!!",UNK
6743,Delicious food and truly delightful workers. One of the workers noticed I was almost out of their delicious sauce and offered to bring me another! Didn't even know I could get more. Love this place,UNK
6744,"Worst excuse for mexican food, ever.  Who messes up tacos??? Tacos were full of fatty meat and the avocado was brown. Yuck. Absolutely terrible service to boot. I'll never come here again",UNK
6745,"Best teriyaki in the area. The firecracker chicken is really good too; has a nice kick. Oh, and the have boba tea, which pretty much guarantees I'll be back.. Every day.. :P",UNK
6746,DO NOT go there. Worst service ever!!!! The waitress are so so so rude and we still have to pay tip 20% for them. DO NOT THIS PLACE!!!!!,UNK
6747,Cantina is a great place for  lunch while shopping in the centre of Edinburgh.\nSmall restaurant with simple decor and spicy food. Portions are very large so we usually share.,UNK
6748,"Been coming here for past 6 months.  And I have not looked for any other coffee joints.  Coffee is superb!  I love it here, the owner definitely has passion and great taste.",UNK
6749,Das Restaurant ist seit zwei Jahren nicht mehr unter der Leitung von Hr. Nerding und deshalb l\u00e4ngst nicht mehr so gut.,UNK
6750,My friends and I had such a great time here! The entertainment was catchy and fun and the waitress was always there when we needed her! I highly recommend visiting New York New York one night to sing along with the dueling pianos,UNK
6751,Constantly canceling appointments and offers no solutions.  They don't even try to call other locations.  Not worth the trouble...,UNK
6752,"This is the worst place, styrofoam , bowls, plastic everything and food is so bad. They somehow got my past review removed, be careful at this place!",UNK
6753,I called this company and they came out to fix my refrigerator ice maker the same day. I talked to the technician and he gave me the estimate on the phone. He arrived fixed my ice maker and charged me the same price he quoted me. I was very satisfied!! \nExcellent Service! Great customer service.,UNK
6754,Bought Groupon.  Product did not arrive.  Company did not answer phone.  Left several messages in voicemail.  No response.  The worst.,UNK
6755,"You wouldn't think brunch at this place, but you'd be so wrong. Great breakfast with inventive dishes including a unique spin on eggs Benedict and a great pastrami hash. Don't miss the Bloody Mary bar.",UNK
6756,"Best deli in town, I've tried almost everything on the menu. Today, something new and great: chicken enchiladas! Never thought a deli could make such good chicken enchiladas, but they are really good. Wednesday only special.",UNK
6757,"Always love popping in SomeBurros.  Staff is great, its always clean and i LOVE the chips and salsa. LOVE IT.",UNK
6758,Sushi was great. Loved the cucumber salad. All around a really good sushi place. Def going back sometime.,UNK
6759,We actually never even entered the place.  The person at the hostess stand was so rude and awful that we couldn't bear to enter.,UNK
6760,"Inexpensive food that is worth your money! The food is good, service is good; therefore, my tummy is always satisfied whenever I'm here. The portions are enough to fill you up and maybe more.",UNK
6761,"While I don't really get cut here anymore Sammy still is a good source if you need a dope design. Even though its right down the street from me, I'd prefer him over In Da Cut.",UNK
6762,So we tried this place once and ended up leaving after 45 minutes  when no one even took our order. We decided to try again...even worse! 1 hour and 20 minutes before our dinner arrived. Terrible service...food fine. Not worth it!!,UNK
6763,First time here and the guy at the register was unprofessional! (Daniel/Chef). And the food was decent. I think he was having a bad day -,UNK
6764,"Holy mother of God....this place is simply awesome. Beautiful people everywhere.  Drinks are great and the design/layout is incredible.  I must say, the Cosmopolitan is certainly a swanky-swanky place!",UNK
6765,Went and it was fine for breakfast. Service was nice food was eh. Nothing special.  Wish I had more to say about it.,UNK
6766,"Dates and bacon, pretty good. Cute venue, dark ambience. Pretty busy when we went. All the tapas were decent.",UNK
6767,"Phenomenal!!! My fianc\u00e9 and I are transplants from NJ, and we have lived here for over a year. We must've tried every pizza place for 50 miles, and this is by far the best. It tastes like home. We will it get our pizza from anywhere else.",UNK
6768,This place reminds me of Dirty Franks in Columbus. The way they put together a hot dog is creative and delicious..it's all about the right proportion and they did it well here. \n\nService was quick and the place wasn't crowded for lunch. Chill atmosphere and good food.,UNK
6769,I decided to try this place because I was looking for a good sandwich.   Looking at all the reviews everyone said to try the Bobbie.   I'm glad I listened to all the reviews because the Bobby was a great delicious sandwich.  I'm from San Diego and just found out they have a location near my house.   WOO-HOO,UNK
6770,One of the worst Vegas hotel diners that I've been to. Service was super slow and it felt like our food took forever. The menu is small and way overpriced. You're better off heading next door to the Fashion Show Mall food court.,UNK
6771,"I came at 840 pm on a Monday night and the employee working there said they were closed!  I was sad because I wanted my cherry lemonade, fries, and American cheese On a stick! I bet this location is not hitting sales because they close early!",UNK
6772,Worst breakfast I have ever had.  Ordered biscuits and gravy with sausage.  Gravy not hot and had to ask for more and still not enough to cover biscuits and sausage. Was not breakfast sausage but some dry beef stick. Never again.,UNK
6773,Nah! I'm sorry I don't see why everyone gives this place a high rating... I guess being from Cali-we know what sushi is supposed to taste like. Yes I know! Pinky in the air :),UNK
6774,This place has the worst service I have ever seen. Waited over a hour for simple sushi rolls and nigiri and the parties behind us got similar food. Had a dinner reservation at 9pm and waited 45mins to get seated. Hi stress got this terrible attitude - never coming back,UNK
6775,"Very nice restaurant, reasonable prices and delicious food. Also the waitress was really nice and attentive and happily explained anything on the menu I was unsure of.",UNK
6776,Not at all reliable.  Makes appointments and does not show up.  Installed shutters on a door and the frame was too small to allow the door knob to operate.  Promised to come back and did not show or call.  Then Jim is angry because you called him too many times (even though he does not answer his phone).,UNK
6777,"There is nothing quite like the pork soup dumplings. They are fantastic! My husband orders a batch alone for his meal. The hot and spicy wonton noodles are not for the heat weak minded. I love spicy food, and this satisfies every craving!",UNK
6778,Food was really good. Vibe in there was hip and cool. Definitely impressed enough to want to go back. Why the three stars you ask? The coffee was terrible. The chai latte was terrible. Other than this it was amazing.,UNK
6779,"This is the worst nail salon I've ever been to.  The techs are amateur and the male tech that did my pedicure was so lame, by day 2 after my pedi my toes looked awful!  I don't recommend this place at all!",UNK
6780,"Costco is simply the best wholesale retailer on the Planet, bar none. The quality of the merchandise and low prices should make you a lifetime customer. They will exceed your expectations, guaranteed.",UNK
6781,"Great cafe in downtown Las Vegas. Loved everything I had on my first visit & already planning on when I can return. I had the green juice, the Chile omelette, & tried the fried apple rings. So good!!! And love that the food is all fresh, much of it direct from the farmers market downtown.",UNK
6782,"Great store, great ife xream. My wife and i go here and its always worth the cost. Its also geat that they let me call in an order then pick it up for those quick stops on lunch break.",UNK
6783,"Bellagio and the Wynn Hotel buffets are two of the best in Vegas.  The quality, and culinary touch is far better than the other Vegas buffets.  Bellagio's interior decor is surprisingly a bit cafeteria styled for one of the better hotels.",UNK
6784,"Tao used to be number 1 on my list for the best nightclub ever, BUT that was 4 years ago. I was so disappointed that now this place is way out of control. It takes forever just to get in, over crowded, and just HORRIBLE.",UNK
6785,This was the worst sushi bar I have been too in the charlotte area. It's bad selection of sushi is matched with its service.  Please avoid if possible.  Nikko is better,UNK
6786,Was very disappointed the crab legs were very small and the most disgusting part is the prime rib ! Way way over cooked no taste what so ever ! If you think your gonna get your Money's worth because this is $$$  don't bother and go somewhere else.,UNK
6787,Love this place. The chicken chow mein and wonton soup are so yummy. They're always so nice and friendly when I come in. Never had a bad meal there.,UNK
6788,I really enjoy shopping at TJ Maxx. It is one of those places I can just wander around. You never know what you will find and that makes shopping fun. The store is clean and pretty organized. Staff seems pretty friendly overall.,UNK
6789,"Excellent Neighborhood ShitHole ! Consistently inconsistent, seldom open and catering to EVERY demographic in the PHX. \nCan't wait to pass on this place for years to come ! Owner must be proud. \nCheers & good luck",UNK
6790,We went there with a Groupon and were pleasantly surprised at how good the food and drinks were. Definitely will return. Ordered the shriracho burger and lavender lemon fizz. So delicious.,UNK
6791,"The employees at this location always seem to have a latte up their a**. The few times that I have been here, I have felt that I'm bothering the employees and interrupting their conversations.",UNK
6792,I just brought my son here for the second time to see Beverly. She is an amazing barber. My son just loves her & the video games he gets to play while she works her magic. It is well worth the price. I will only bring him to her from now on.,UNK
6793,Amaz-ZING! The chairs were very comfortable. Prob one of my top 5 restaurant chairs i've ever introduced my ass to. Will def come back just for the chairs next time I'm in Vegas. The food wasn't too shabby as well,UNK
6794,Gross... the only great thing about my meal was the chedder biscuits. I knew by the look of my meal when it came to the table I was going to get food poisoning. I WAS RIGHT.,UNK
6795,Pretty good fast food chain. They have a salsa bar with a half dozen things to add to your food; I had a Classic Chicken Burrito with a side of Tortilla Soup and it was all quite yummy.,UNK
6796,This place was really not that good. I was sad...I was hoping for something delicious and spicy and authentic - being that the decor was hip and the location convenient.\n\nThe price was good.,UNK
6797,"This place used to be my favorite sushi place when I first started going about 9 years ago. As the years go by, the quality, freshness, and taste of the food has failed to please. I used to recommend this place to friends and visitors, but now I can't even get myself to go in there for a meal.",UNK
6798,Both 7 and 8 have broken or missing locks and 7 has an entire corner missing plexiglass in the top of the bed. Not worth the price if it's not maintained.  \n\nAnd yes these things have been mentioned to the staff numerous times.,UNK
6799,Sales department is useless. I called prior to driving from CA to inquire about the availibity of a part and was told they had several on hand and that they always stock that part. However when I arrived at the store they had none I was told that I should have called first.  (If only I had thought of that),UNK
6800,I just llove Virgin America airlines. I like assign seating. Its not ghetto and their airlines always looks very clean. the flight attendants always service you with a smile. Book main cabin select and drink all the alcohol you want. get your own t.v. can't really ask for much more from an airline.,UNK
6801,Went last night for my birthday.  Has a wonderful meal as always.  The service was great and they gave me a free appetizer.   Will be going back soon.,UNK
6802,Great taxidermy. Awesome year round christmas decor. Cheap drinks. Even a free ping pong table. What's not to like?,UNK
6803,Same McDoonalds as everywhere. Cheap prices for non-healthy food but the service was UNBELIEVABLY slow. Not much room where to sit compared to other McDicks on top of it. The designer literally had no idea on how to take advantage of the room for a maximum of seating.,UNK
6804,Best chicken sandwich and red velvet cake are my favorites. Breakfast is good here too. Not many breakfast choices but they have all the basics.  I would eat here every day but it's a little spendy. Worth the money though.,UNK
6805,"THIS BUSINESS CLOSED IN JULY 2012 and it was sold to a new group, Centre Savanna. Centre Savanna went bankrupt in May 2014 and the space is currently up for rent.  This message is from the landlord",UNK
6806,I enjoy all of Cirque du Soleil shows and Mystere. I believe one of the older shows It was a good show you see threw a babies dream. I was impressed with dancers acrobatic acts strength acts and the baby was very funny and the host keeps it fun.,UNK
6807,"This location hates to do returns of their merchandise. Purchased from their online site, had original receipt. Customer service was terrible and they tried to refund less than what I actually paid for the merchandise.  Additionally they made me wait 30 minutes for a manager to try and help me out.",UNK
6808,Very slow service! Sushi was just average. A little pricey for the food/service/ambiance. Probably my first & last time here.,UNK
6809,"Great place, small, but good service and very delicious. Filet Mignon meatballs, and Veal Parm both fantastic!  Highly recommended, one of the best Italian places in Vegas.  Best of all, prices were incredibly reasonable.  Great value, great eats!",UNK
6810,"Stayed here last weekend for a girls trip.\nHorrible customer service.\nI will never stay again...\nBut I might eat at the beach bar restaurant, the only good thing in this hotel.\nFront desk lady Melenda, was rude.",UNK
6811,"In terms of cleanliness, this was one of the worst theaters i've ever been to. Considering that this theater was in the Palms Casino, I expected much much more. There's also no butter dispenser for your popcorn. You need to ask one of the people who work behind the counter to butter the popcorn for you.",UNK
6812,"Going to a movie after I play a few games. SP always has the latest, most fun games. I always win here then I eat some ice cream r ave a coffee. Love South Point because it's not touristy.",UNK
6813,"Great choices of poutine.\nWe have had the original and the vegeterian, the vegetarian is so savory and good that you want to have more.",UNK
6814,Great comfort food...absolutely love everything they bring to dining...food..vibe...service.\n\nThe best country fried steak I have ever eaten.,UNK
6815,"It's says on here they're open 24/7, and the hostess said they were open (at 10:30 on a Tuesday night) but our waiter refused us service and kicked us out. Needless to say we'll never go there again.",UNK
6816,Me and my wife went to the meatball spot the classic ball is bland and dry. The stuffed ball I had was empty the pesto was bland. The chef needs to be given salt and pepper. Neather me or my wife will be back.,UNK
6817,"Don't park here. My car was broken into and some items were stolen. With all the people and shuttles going around and monitoring the lot, this still happened. I'm very unsatisfied.",UNK
6818,"Hey, it's a bar. The food is good enough but nothing special. The service was good when I went. The highlight for me was the upstairs patio.",UNK
6819,Update # 3...OK we went for our 'great experience'. It was ok. Massages themselves were good-to-great. Nothing else was improved. No follow-up from the manager considering the situation. I promise you that you can find something better to do with $175.,UNK
6820,"Room was nice.  50 bucks per including Buffet o Buffet's which I used for two breakfast meals.  Hotel layout is not so great.  Service was fine to non-existent at times.  Stayed in Ipanima Tower, which was fine.  Poker room is very small considering they host the WSOP down the hall.",UNK
6821,"Definitely a fan of this place.  They had a great mix of good quality and tasty Latin American dishes (not just Mexican).   The drinks were good as well and decently priced for the quality.  Overall great somewhat upscale place to go, but gets loud in the evening time.",UNK
6822,"This place is one of those hidden treasures I stumbled upon. The best quiche I have ever tasted and I have a lot to compare with. You can tell the owner has a passion for food. Great dishes, amazing service, and over all great atmosphere for lunch dates.",UNK
6823,"Good Car Wash.  It was quick and clean.  The pre-sprayed the wheel wells and pressure washed some of the harder areas.  The cost was reasonable. Nothing broke on my car going through it, so it gets a A+",UNK
6824,"A Pittsburgh staple. Just try one. It is everything you know you shouldn't eat all on one sandwich. Although I can't say I would hands down eat one at any chance I could, its one of those things you must check off your bucket list.",UNK
6825,Never order steak here! It was tough and not good quality for its price.  Steak was also bland and it was almost well done :(,UNK
6826,"Okay food. Nothing new or different. Your regular American food, just double the price. The most interesting thing they have is a dessert cart that they push around. Cool idea.",UNK
6827,Disappointing - very odd configuration for a comedy club and the comedians were mediocre at best.  I wouldn't go back if the tickets were free,UNK
6828,YAY!  LOVE UO!!  I do like their clothes a lot but my favorite part are the quirky books and t-shirts they sell.  Got my boyfriend hooked on it now too.  We bought some fun stuff while in this shop the other day.  Friendly staff also.,UNK
6829,"Crowded store, with plenty of goods. Didn't find outlet pricing particularly compelling, esp. given Kate Spade is a frequent Gilt feature. Staff was so-so.",UNK
6830,Had lunch here today. First time. Pretty darn good. Large selection of the usual buffet items. All seemed fresh. Nothing looked like it had been sitting there long. Enjoyed it and will come back.,UNK
6831,Service is a major part in an Establishment. With that said this place needs to work on it. They HELLA SLOW........ last and only time I come here.,UNK
6832,"Man, every time I've gone to this place, the food looks a lot better than it tastes. I've found all the food to be incredibly bland. Disappointing because the atmosphere is pretty cool.",UNK
6833,Rude service and bad food. I don't get the love some of my friends have for this place. There are other places very close by that are much better.,UNK
6834,"One of my favorites. The food is average and the atmosphere is interesting but the price is unbeatable. If you want to eat sushi but dont want to feel the pain this is the place for you.\n\nI suggest the dragon rolls, very good!",UNK
6835,I love Roberto's and this happens to be right by my house so I come here all the time. The food always comes out fast and they always get my order right.\n\nThis location is old and the decor is dumpy ...but I don't go to Robertos for the ambiance.,UNK
6836,Lobster Queso Dip and the BLT Salad! Amazing!  Make sure you save a little bit of the fresh baked bread for the bottom of your dip bowl....yummmm!  Bravo Firebirds,UNK
6837,You have to try the autumn squash soup!!!\n\nNow....I hate squash! But for some reason I wanted to try this & I am glad I did!\n\nIt's excellent!!!!!!!,UNK
6838,"I love to eat here for breakfast and brunch. The service is consistently good service and consistently tastes the same from visit to visit. My favorites are Bunny Rancheros, Pancakes, and the Blazin' Saddles Omelette.  Get there early or be prepared to wait.",UNK
6839,I don't remember what the specific name of dessert but it was their version of bananas foster was $7 and worth it ... perfect amount of bananas ice cream and alcohol.,UNK
6840,I love Little Caesars but don't come to this location on Val Vista and Southern if you're starving or in a hurry. It requires patience. If their cheese bread weren't so addicting I'd probably just go somewhere else...,UNK
6841,I only frequent this place cuz my pobox is here. It's definitely not because the workers are worth bragging about. Oh ya & I love the bums asking for $$$$.,UNK
6842,"I love this place and look forward to grocery shopping here whenever I can.  Things I like:   Their prices, the produce, all of their Fresh and Easy brand products and other things I'm used to and love.   Great quality products that I love at the prices that I love.",UNK
6843,Come here and grab a sangwich before you pre-game and then again after hoeing around in the club! the original and the tuna melt... that's maaaah faaavorite!!! enjoy!,UNK
6844,Should be no star. They need more Doctors here. More than 3 hours and still no doctor have seen my wife. What a terrible provider.,UNK
6845,Great family owned business. Very responsive quick service. They are the only ones in Arizona for classic auto glass. They also have the cleanest shop I have ever seen. Keep up the great work.,UNK
6846,I am sitting here watching a very nice woman get taken advantage of by the windshield replacement sales vultures. M & M Auto glass should be ashamed and Classic Car Wash should kick these a-holes to the curb. Disgusting business ethics and straight up insurance fraud.,UNK
6847,Locals sent me to eat here while I was in town. The bad 1st: Out of onion rings and the soda fountain wasn't working. The Awesome: Pastrami sandwich & garlic fries. Try it out if you're in vegas.,UNK
6848,Ok so service was classic airport hub.... I am an IPA fan and had a Hop drop and roll on a layover. Mecklenburg brewery was a pleasant surprise. Good taste and body. Nice thick head on the brew as well. Nice way to take the edge of a hump day at the end of the day,UNK
6849,"Best Italian in Scottsdale mountain. Great staff, great food and amazing new place. I highly recommend the ribeye and the scallops.",UNK
6850,I had the ribs and pork and it was the best I've had in awhile. I could eat that barbecue sauce on anything.,UNK
6851,This place was ok.   There is no crab legs/Shrimps in the buffet at all.\nIt was over price for what they served...,UNK
6852,"I love Cheyenne west & I have taking my pets for years! I love all the doctors & assistants they are all great & treat my babies excellent! The receptionist(s) need to work on their people skills though, the past few times I have been there I have not been greeted they do not speak to me first, not even to pay my bill",UNK
6853,"Phenomenal experience, friendly staff (we speak no french), great service, great food, great ambiance. Would return on our next visit to Montreal.",UNK
6854,"Spent north of $1200 for simple food in one of their boxes last week. After charging me a %20 \""service fee\"" on the food, they ask for a %15 tip as well. Going to the ball park next time.",UNK
6855,This place really had potential.  They were out of almost all the Muffins and it took a LONG time to get our food.  I guess I expected a little bigger portions sizes.  They food was good.  Just some simples improvements would make this place very special indeed!  I'll be back to give them another chance.,UNK
6856,"D'Lisa is by far the best! Perfection! The salon is clean and simple, appealing to the eye and the art is great to look at. I was offered a beverage, which is nice and D'lisa just made me feel so comfortable and welcomed. I will be back for sure, this place and D'Lisa is a keeper!",UNK
6857,"Excellent pastries, cappuccino and decor. Perfect for a tete-a-tete. Service was courteous and it was lovely to see the kitchen working like a well-oiled machine. Definitely worth a return visit.",UNK
6858,Incredibly rude staff. I asked for help with a curtain pattern and two staff members bickered over who had to help me. Also when I went to check out another two staff members were arguing at the cash register. I will never be back!,UNK
6859,Always have fun here at the Luxor! Right near the airport and an easy trip around hotels! Staff is always friendly! And won big at the tables! Awesome!,UNK
6860,Sorry volcano your staff is very nice and polite but your buffet sucks I love seaweed salad but yours had a funky taste every dish I had that should have been warm to hot was cold.I went back for a second helping but every thing I choose was so mediocre I left almost a whole plate of food and left.,UNK
6861,"Yum! Another wonderful evening at Amano's. Great food, friendly staff and in case you didn't know, Tuesday is 1/2 off bottle wine night. We shared a fabulous Cabernet from their Great selection. Hmmm... See you next Tuesday!",UNK
6862,"I've been to three Roy's now, here and two in Hawaii.  I always try to check out a new one when I come across them.  Excellent and interesting food. I have never been disappointed.",UNK
6863,"An incredible place.  The food is wonderful, flavorful but not excessively spicy.  This is the cooking of New Mexico.\n\nI was visiting and out hosts took us there.\n\nA definite DON'T MISS!",UNK
6864,Helped me adjust my bike and gave me advice to reduce pain on my back and knees.  Invaluable help as I cross the country San Diego to Washington DC.  Great people and great service!,UNK
6865,We recently started going here when they offered take out happy hour prices. Their sushi is fresh and delicious and hostesses are really friendly. I recommend it to anyone who likes sushi and doesn't have a big bank to spend on it.,UNK
6866,"Someburro's is hands down the best fast Mexican food in Phoenix!  Friendly staff, great food and atmosphere. I love the chicken taco! The prices are acceptable and there are always dollar off and buy one get one coupons floating around. This is a must eat if your in the area!",UNK
6867,Always friendly and helpful.  One of the cleaner Circle K's.  I stop and get a soda here because of how clean they keep the soda fountain area,UNK
6868,Lunch was very good!  Service was exceptional!  Wonderful atmosphere!  We had the  fish and chips and the Reuben!  We will be trying it for the Prime Rib dinner some Wed. evening or the live music dining on Friday nights.  This is a special place.  There is indoor and outdoor dining in an area that overlooks the pond!,UNK
6869,Bomb as hell love the lobster burrito the tortilla chips are entirely legit. The Carne taco is also incredible.,UNK
6870,"Pasta tastes like it was re-heated in the microwave.   Not al dente at all.  Gnocchi is like paste.  Portions are tiny.  Salads are pricey and boring.   Artisan pizzas are dry and bland.  Ate there because we were staying at the hotel.  In this area, there are many better places.",UNK
6871,"This place is fast becoming my favorite AYCE spot here in Vegas - it has been more reliably good than any other.\n\nTasty appetizers (especially the garlic chicken), good quality fish and quick service make me want to keep coming back here.",UNK
6872,"Ghetto run,  dirty, unsanitary would be giving this place a compliment.  WE WILL NEVER BRING OUR CHILD THERE AGAIN. as soon as they take your over priced entrance fee, expect zero customer service  only one ride operator the whole miserable two hours there.  NO thank you",UNK
6873,Grooming service...very very no good service..\nI will never come beck...manager.very vey no good man,UNK
6874,The grilled chicken po boy was very tasty!  From the bread to how the chicken was seasoned.  I also tried the catfish with grits and it was amazing.  Not a fan of grits so my opinion on it would be very bias.  Next time I want to try the catfish po boy.,UNK
6875,"Grab my cheese Danish almost everyday here...fantastic...croissant ,crepes,quiche all different kind..oh la la yummmmm ....Pete's coffee too.....,",UNK
6876,The store was huge. It's much more expensive then what I'm used to seeing in Northern California. They did have some really nice clothes though. I got 2 100.00 miss me jeans for 40. Each that is a heck of a deal.,UNK
6877,"Solid, very solid, but not mind-blowing. Nicer and wider selection than in-n-out, and higher quality ingredients and bigger burgers in general, but also pricier. Nice patio for extra seating.",UNK
6878,Horrid! Worst Mexican food ever!! Don't order the fish tacos or chicken burritos! \nSoup was nasty too! \nDon't waist time here!!,UNK
6879,You'll wait to be seated. And you'll watch others who don't have reservations get seats before you. Then you'll ask for an explanation. You wanna hear it? Then go!\nP.s. Did not eat here,UNK
6880,"Wait staff is amazing, but their management is rude and disrespectful. Will not be back till their GM is no longer there. You can not ask him a question without him being condescending and rude. Can NOT believe he still has a job... Really sad because we love their wings....",UNK
6881,"Another day, another update.\n\nYeah....Lost Leaf is just not for me.  I don't wear skinny jeans, I don't own a Mac, I don't listen to indie rock, I don't drink beer.",UNK
6882,Great food. Definitely going back for more. \n*love that they give the kids a stuffed animal of their choice*.,UNK
6883,Seriously?  Only 2 stars?  You guys either haven't been out in AZ or are just idiots.  This place has good HH deals and decent food.  Best 'bar' in TMP btw.  Wait staff is always sweet and accommodating.,UNK
6884,This is the best Mexican food I've ever had! I literally have to drive across town to eat there! Great food and service!,UNK
6885,Don't bother\n\nNo alcohol in the drinks and lame diner type food that was not too good.\n\nBad choice considering all the choices in Las Vegas.,UNK
6886,Where else can you get Bowling and Authentic Italian food at a Decent price? The private rooms look kick ass. They are open late and dont mind stragglers past closing time. The tables are even heated and they offer free Pool lessons. I hope they are a fixture for years to come.,UNK
6887,Boo!  What happened to this location?  It used to be happy and fun!  It just feels depressing and nearly everyone there is just doing the bare minimum to get by?  So sad.,UNK
6888,I love this place. The servers are nice and always smiling and the Sushi is amazing!! Great atmosphere and great food. Their All You Can Eat Sushi is worth it specially since it includes Sake and beer! Food is always fresh and delicious. One of my favorite Sushi places in Vegas.,UNK
6889,"Hi everyone, i have a question! is this suitable for a 2 year old or is it more for older children? I'm hoping to take my niece tomorrow! thanks!",UNK
6890,"At it again here at Champagnes Cafe!  It's Darin's birthday and  we got the birthday deal! Free shot for the birthday boy or girl, 20 dollar tab and a tee shirt! Our bartender Messy Jessie is the best! Great drinks and PBR on tap!",UNK
6891,"When someone orders a veggie sub you may want to consider that they don't want meat. Placing my formerly vegetarian sub directly in between two roast beef subs, in total contact with meat on both sides is disgusting and rude. Which is why I walked out. Jersey mikes has been permanently ruined in my mind.",UNK
6892,Why aria????? Why?? You had so much potential!!! \n\nPlace is shit!!,UNK
6893,Cinnamon bun and apple fritters were great!  Looking forward to trying other items.  They've been in business 51 years!,UNK
6894,"One of the best Cobb salads I've had in quite awhile! A little pricey for lunch, but it was delicious. Love that they have honey mustard dressing too.",UNK
6895,"Visited for lunch last year.  Food quality is fantastic.  Great cocktail menu.  Would definitely try dinner when I have the chance.  Service was great, but restaurant was not busy when I was there.  The Beef Carpaccio as a starter is wicked!!  Big wine list also!!",UNK
6896,After reading the reviews my fiancee and i decided to step in there and I was impressed with the service and with crepes. They have a few but they are the bomb the coffee is also delicious.  Highly recommended it to anybody.,UNK
6897,Good food if you can get the staff to understand English and hear over the Spanish channel they have blasting in the back ground. I suggest taking your food to go.,UNK
6898,The studio is one of the best in town. Their teacher Paige Warthen without a doubt has the most advanced Ashtanga practice in Las Vegas. If you practice Ashtanga in Las Vegas you should know who she is.,UNK
6899,"Wow.  Absolutely the best sweet potato fries.  Went to Fez specifically for the fries.  I live in Redondo Beach, Calif but will be visiting Phx a lot more.......  Clifton, our server, was great.",UNK
6900,"I frequent this location it's conveniently located on my route to school, customer service is usually good, but today it was atrocious by the female that was working in the drive through window becoming argumentative, about my order that she took wrong.",UNK
6901,Love this place for a lazy Sunday. Great creative menu items and friendly staff. Usually order the half skillet and half stack of protein pancakes. But their benediction is excellent too,UNK
6902,My family are faithful customers to this business. They are generous with their portion sizes and are extremely prompt with their delivery.\n\nMy brothers always go for the usual Mongolian Chicken or Pork Fried Rice but my favorites are the house special beef and the Dragon and Phoenix.,UNK
6903,I'm superrrr picky about getting my nails done but Sasha is absolutely amazing!! I left with my nails perfectly shaped and the cutest design ever! Had the gel on for over two weeks and it didn't chip once!! She is such an amazing and creative nail artist! Highly recommended!!,UNK
6904,"The casino is always crowded as ass and hard to maneuver through.  Rooms nice enough, pool sucks.\n\nI generally don't like to kick it here.",UNK
6905,A favorite place of none.  All of there salads are great!   Can't go wrong at this place.  Sitting in the main dining room is awesome as the walls open to the outside!,UNK
6906,"If I could, I would give it negative stars!  Treated so terribly by the staff that we left without ordering!  Took our hard earned cash down the street to Bella Notte where they treated us wonderfully!!!!  I will NEVER eat at Luke Wholey!!",UNK
6907,"great food, the butternut squash ravioli was excellent! It's BYOB which is great, but it's on the small side, so expect a long wait on peak hours",UNK

6909,"The entire staff is friendly and courteous.  Food has it all...flavor, uniqueness and great presentation.  Drinks are made to perfection every time.  Whatever you do, do not pass on the rice, trust me.  Great comfortable patio areas.  I will become a regular for sure.\n\nCheers!",UNK

6911,"What a find! I had the Yum Woon Sen, and Spicy California Handroll. I eat a lot of Thai food, and Yum Woon Sen is my staple dish. This place ROCKED IT! Holy yum!!! (Pun intended)! Ate there twice in one week. Love that place!",UNK
6912,"Great place to smoke a cigar, have some yummy food and drinks and watch a football game.   Away from the hustle and bustle of the strip",UNK
6913,"It's so dumb that I paid $120.00 for 3 tickets and then the lifeguards and staff are rude I don't understand why people can't promise the service they did promise. The bathrooms are disgusting, the crowd is horrible, and the place smells like utter crap DON'T GO",UNK
6914,"I found a nice place for an afternoon lunch and drink. Linda the daytime bar maid is outstanding but i heard she was leaving. Can't find good help these days,",UNK
6915,Great frozen margaritas and make sure you order the Pollo Fundido.  It's worth the trip up to Cave Creek.,UNK
6916,"I was excited to try C2C, however it was pretty disappointing. My fries were undercooked, cold and I'm pretty sure I ordered waffle fries but received regular fries. I don't think I will trying C2C again. Not really impressed.",UNK
6917,This place was clean and the service was top notch! It is a cross between a Dairy Queen and a Carl's Jr. If you are hungry - get your hamburger with 2 patties - they are kinda slim. The fries were great and they have a ton of frozen custard desserts.,UNK
6918,"Love this place!  I've only been here twice, both for lunch and both times were excellent.  Great place to get a sandwich - hot or cold. Fresh products make this a nice lunch spot. I'll definitely be back.",UNK

6922,"Got there early. It was realy dead. I'm sure if the night were to continue on it may have gotten beter, but we left. Music was nothing really to remember. Might give it a second chance next time I'm out there.",UNK
6923,"I used to love coming here when I had a studio space on De Gaspe! It's such a beautiful space. My favorite dish was the tofu bowl with carrots, lentils, and rice. Such a simple dish, but so well done. The onigiri is great there, too.",UNK
6924,"The food was good, but the reason of the low stars was because of the slow service, we ordered food which came timely, but after dinner we wanted to order dessert, but the server paid no attention to us, and we waited for 30 minutes for the dessert menu. Nice food, but not sure if will come again due to service",UNK
6925,Great food..... Ridiculous prices.....i cant in my right mind fork over 30.00 for 2 adults to eat at a fast food joint.\nSorry 5 guys..... I'm out and eating elsewhere ..,UNK
6926,"Wonderful addition to downtown Tempe. Watched the AZ Cardinals game, they actually play game sound in the back bar. The menu is different from the Camelback location, but still fantastic. There is so much space for large groups and games. Will absolutely be returning - try the Shrimp & Pork Belly Ramen, delicious :)",UNK
6927,"Healthy, vegan, gluten free food options.  Atmosphere is a homely mom-and-pop restaurant nestled in the industrial downtown area.  Warning: Call ahead to RSVP & request sweet breakfast entrees in a gluten free option. The food is worth the wait.",UNK
6928,"nice remodel.....food not that great.....we had ribs, chicken and pork chops tonight....chicken undercooked...taken off bill.....mac and cheese side good",UNK
6929,Stop 5 on our buffet of buffets journey. This buffet was just okay. The crab legs were bigger than the Flamingo's and the Mac and cheese was good. The cookies on the dessert area looked dry. So-so overall selection.,UNK
6930,"Everything that we ordered, including rice and beans tasted like fish.  Even the red chili burrito that was covered is sauce tasted like fish.  They obviously don't clean surfaces or utensils after handling fish, let alone who knows what else.  Disgusting.  Would never go back.",UNK
6931,My husband and I enjoyed our anniversary lunch today. The food was great as well as the service. The dessert (crisp) came out a little late so the manager treated us even though we didn't complain. I had the sea bass tacos and my husband had the inside out quinoa burger. Both were great. Will definitely go back.,UNK
6932,"Gets better every time I go.\n\nLove the waiters, they are awesome!\n\nI got my own chop sticks also!!! WooooooooT!!! :)",UNK
6933,Great location for a Starbucks and very nice inside.  Staff is friendly.\nDrinks are def way more exp than Starbucks elsewhere. But what do you expect? It's vegas..,UNK
6934,"Chow Fun with white meat chicken is always delicious. Crab Ragoon is a nice side dish. It is fast food,  but better than panda.",UNK
6935,Lots of construction going on here. But the traffic is never heavy so its ok. they have decent places to grab food and have cool trinquet shops for souvenirs . I come here cause I don't think there is a choice.,UNK
6936,"Ewww, the food here is terrible.  Nothing I had tasted good.  It tasted like it had been sitting under the food warmers for hours.  The service is luke warm at best.  Just skip it.  There's so many other places out there for good italian food.",UNK
6937,"All the car wash in Scottsdale sane charge you a lot for very little \"" tried to help you\"" by selling detail bullshit. For f..ing 20.00 it should be a good job",UNK

6939,"Love this place each and every time I go.  The service is friendly, the food is better, and the sides and biscuits are absolutely amazing.  I am really surprised the average review is so low, try to ignore it and try this place. I promise you won't regret!",UNK

6942,"Ok train station:\n-30p for toilet. (Should be free)\n-good, free wifi. See photo of Speed test\n-not enough waiting room seating\n-good signage\n-Virgin ticket machines broken. Need more working automation for all services",UNK
6943,The rooms are extremely noisy. This is the second time i stayed at Venetian and everytime i got a room with lots of noise. The rooms are facing the pool and the noise of the cleaning pumps run all night. It sounds like somebody vacum clean your room all the time.,UNK
6944,Stopped in here on the way out of town and picked up some sage sprays and herbal remedies. A nice store with quite a few things to check out. Definitely worth a walk through.,UNK
6945,The get me my coffee AND it's a surprisingly clean restaurant. \n\nCan't be a $1.08 cup of joe.,UNK
6946,"The food was lousy.  The cheese pizza was greasy and bland.  It reminded me of pizza at the cafeteria when I was in college.  The lime chicken sandwich that my wife ordered was also less than stellar.  The service was slow, and they already had run out of several sandwiches on the menu, even though we ordered around 1pm.",UNK
6947,"Food was great, unfortunately the staff left much to be desired. \n\nGiven the rest of the choices in the area though, it's best to opt for good food and bad service.",UNK
6948,"Went there 6 in the morning. It's just like any McDonald's, you should know what they serve. The staff is very friendly and helpful.",UNK
6949,"The experience was great, smooth ride, great views and info, and tasty sandwich plus champagne - just as promised in the tour brochure. However there were 6 passengers in our helicopter, and  I felt crushed with hardly an inch to move.  I must add that we were all of average size. Otherwise I would have given this  5 stars.",UNK
6950,This front desk was way too small for the volume of people that were coming in and out on a Thursday afternoon. I couldn't imagine it on a weekend or evening. The facility was clean and very relaxing once you got into the waiting area.,UNK
6951,"This is a weekly place for  us. Same two servers (mother and daughter). This is more of a hang out. Don't go for a Parisian experience dressed in your Sunday best, it's more of a mom and pop shop to hang out and enjoy some quiet time.",UNK
6952,Great experiences at Donovan's. Friendly staff and bartenders. (ask for Jordan or Ken). One of best steak places in Phoenix.\nGood happy hour and wine list as well.,UNK
6953,"Nice place, not a fan of the sports bar. Bartenders very rude to all customers who aren't female.\nIf they could provide some decent service and not act so entitled could easily be one of the best on the strip.",UNK
6954,Monti's used to be so good... now it's awful.  The prices have gone up while the food quality has gone done.  Extremely dissapointed.  I wish they would bring back their old menu and food.,UNK
6955,My wife and I have been going to this place every Saturday for the last three months. This place is great. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly.,UNK
6956,It's the only place that I feel normal because I'm still up at 5am and everyone there is wide awake too lol!! I love the artisan but the drink prices are stupid.,UNK
6957,Crowded on their open skates but alot o fun.\nPrice is good. \nStaff is alot of young teenagers.\n\nIt is something fun to do with the family.,UNK
6958,"DO NOT CALL FOR DELIVERY!  We have always LOVED this place but after two deliveries in a row being screwed up and disclosing a food allergy they ignored we are done.  We call and they tell us, \""thank you???\""",UNK
6959,"Some of the best bagels and baked goods in town! Friendly staff behind the counter, the place is always clean, and they have yet to run out of my favorite bagels in the morning. I have no review for the waitstaff as I have yet to dine inside the deli, however, I do wish to change that soon.",UNK
6960,What a find!! They give samples so you can try before you buy but the chicken and rib eye is so amazing and their portions are a great size!,UNK
6961,"Decent place, good for a chain or mall restaurant but nothing amazing. Poor service but the Americanized Mexican food is pretty solid. My wife likes some of their fruity Margarita offerings but past that the place is a resounding \""meh.\""",UNK
6962,"Fun place with a good vibe.  My friends and I like the skee ball and the other games they have.  The bar staff always makes delicious drinks.  Overall, a good stop when bar hopping in Elizabeth.",UNK
6963,It was OK as Mexican food goes.  But the salsa tasted like it came from a jar.  Prices seemed a notch higher than most similar places like Frank & Fina's.\n\nI might try it again though.,UNK
6964,def not the worlds greatest hot sandwiches\ni had the turkey stuffing and super salty gravy sandwich\nit was meh,UNK
6965,"Find another place to stay than this hotel. You can find a less expensive, classier place to stay in Vegas. The rooms are tacky, the carpets are gross, the pool is a frat party on steroids, most of the staff is surly and unable to do their job correctly.",UNK
6966,Went there this past Saturday for Big Petes new CD release.  Always fun.  Waiting 15 minutes for a drink however is too long.  Older female bartender strategically ignores you unless she is bored.   Door guys were cool.,UNK
6967,"My flatmate and I go here sometimes three times a week because it's always guaranteed to be good. The toasted bagel sandwiches are the best and with soup for the lunch deal, it's quite a bargain!",UNK
6968,Good:\nBread\nAtmosphere\nMany authentic French menu items\nWine selection\n\nBad:\nSteak Frites - medium grade meat - weak sauces\nWeak cheeses,UNK
6969,The service guys at Camelback Subaru are great! Kyle and Robert are the best! Always helpful and honest and I never feel like I'm being ripped off.,UNK
6970,"Rien de mauvais, mais avec tous les restaurants indiens de qualit\u00e9 que Montr\u00e9al a \u00e0 offrir, on peut faire beaucoup mieux!",UNK
6971,"Ordered the Laksa and Chicken rice; both were good, although not 100% authentic. \nAlways good service, fairly fast and never super crowded.",UNK
6972,Awesome restaurant it's my favorite place in Vegas. They have New York strip to die for. They have a romantic atmosphere. Warning the restaurant has dim lighting perfect for a dinner date. They do offer a delicious lobster bisque. And they have the best creme brulee in town!,UNK
6973,Just wanted to write a note that this location is closing 6/16/2010.  I'm bummed out because I had my fantasy football draft here the last couple years and it was great both times.,UNK
6974,It's a romantic timewarp!  The firey pits (see photo) are really cool and the decor is 70's all the way.  It's a nice change of pace from the rest of the strip.,UNK
6975,"So far thr best crepes and green tea cake I ever tried in Las Vegas... good job Suzuya.. but need to make more cakes for me~ so I can try all flavors~ lol very nice decor, good service, and taste awesome!",UNK
6976,The Big Tony was delicious!!! Btw the fried pickles are a must. I'm excited to come back and try something different.,UNK
6977,"I was here for a conference at the Univ. of Madison, WI. Close to campus. Very modern hotel, comfortable, quiet, and clean. Friendly reception with great candy treats. It isn't close to downtown, however, other local businesses are within walking distance.",UNK
6978,50 minutes for a happy hour sandwich. Really??  Wednesday not Friday or Saturday. No standing. God was great and the wait staff was great but 50 minutes for a sandwich. Applebee's can do better.  Plus the small steak half medium and half well done.  Too bad.  Must be a management problem.,UNK
6979,Hands down the best place for tacos around. You got to check this place out. I've never had a bad experience. Really nice staff and great service.,UNK
6980,Dr. Steelman is in my opinion the very best veterinarian in Las Vegas. I'm fortunate to live as close as I do to her new cat hospital.,UNK
6981,"This was a no frills cheap buffet, with surprisingly decent food and quality.  You wont find anything special here but it was better than eating in the food court. Prices are pretty low as well.",UNK
6982,This was our first time here. Our waiter was great and the food was really good. The manager Nick showed us excellent customer service and made our dinner memorable. Highly recommend this place and applaud the staff for their attention. We'll be back with friends and family soon.,UNK
6983,"Decent pizza, but don't bother dining in.  The service is negligible, plastic forks and knives, paper plates, and self serve drinks.  The place is too small and carry out patrons are constantly standing around your table.  Not very relaxing.",UNK
6984,The picture shown is not the actual cafe. They mostly only had sandwiches. I saw very few pastries that did not look fresh. The sandwich I had was not great for the $9 I paid for it and a small bag of chips. I definitely will not be back.,UNK
6985,"The Challah Bread French Toast was unique.   A good menu with items that are not associated with the normal \""breakfast place.\""  \n\nBusy place but efficient and friendly.  I would love to go back again if I make it back in the area from Chicago.",UNK
6986,"I would not go here!!! I was referred by a friend and lets just say the cut/color i received here from supposedly one of their best \""stylist\"" was so bad. The color was supposed to be blonde but ended up being a muted yellow and the cut I cried about. The work here is below par!",UNK
6987,"Not your regular mex fare, super tasty, perfectly chilled beer and great service. The blackened shrimp enchilada was excellent. Highly recommended, we'll be returning soon.",UNK
6988,I love Target! This one always has a lot of registers open and and is super easy to find everything you need. Great deals and lovely people!,UNK
6989,Excellent Food and Service and very affordable.  Everything was very fresh and flavorful.  Best Egg Rolls had a long time.  Highly Recommended!\n\nTodd & Sandra,UNK
6990,"With about as much ethnic diversity in store as you'd find in the Nuremburg rallies, Jack Wills is the clothing you wear if you feel the need to proclaim to the world 'I am a complete, and utter, cock'.\n\nAlso it's expensive.",UNK
6991,"I love coming to crisp. Salads are awesome but they have to do something about their chicken. I have been here consistently for a year and every time the chicken is incredibly dry. Do yourself a favor, go to crisp and get the salmon or tofu. Well worth it.",UNK
6992,Had lunch here the last two days and very impressed.  Nothing fancy just a solid sandwich shop that blows away subway any day of the week.  The fresh bread and veggies really make the sandwiches stand out here.  Good pricing and highly recommend.,UNK
6993,"Not really great food or service. We went in, ordered a to-go, waited 20 min, got home and it was all wrong.",UNK
6994,"I have used Sergio's for years and have nothing but good to say. The price is fair you know what you are going to pay and they do a great job cleaning up the yard when they are done, including the weeds.",UNK
6995,"This is a small, cozy restaurant that is unique. The food is fresh and tasty. The sandwiches, salad, and spring rolls are very good. It is a little expensive for what it is but I will definitely go back and try dinner options.",UNK
6996,I was enjoying my vacation till I stopped by the burger bar Jessica our server was less then pleasant and Scott the manager would not honor the happy hour specials think twice before stopping by for happy hour. Food was great though!!,UNK
6997,"I've been going to this place for years It's definitely one of the best kept secrets in Sunrise Manor. Great atmosphere, great food, affordable drinks. It's not overcrowded and the employees and clientele are very cool. I'll continue to head to the \""Cas\"" whenever I get a chance!",UNK
6998,"The inside is very nice and clean, I will give them that. But there employees are not happy or nice. Food is hit or miss. Sometime they get it right sometimes they don't. The lines are usually long and take way too long.",UNK
6999,Vegas baby Vegas! Been coming to vegas for years. I still love all the lights and the glow of Vegas night life. They are constantly changing things and its only getting better as the years pass ...,UNK
7000,The hotel charges were much higher than our expectation.  When I booked I specifically said 3 adults (the rate shown online in their site was different for 2 adults versus 3 adults).  They charged an extra of $15 per day for the extra person.  In addition the room was very noisy due to people partying on the road and the heavy traffic.,UNK
7001,"this place is packed, drink lines are long but cheaper compared to others, its loud, and dancers are hot its a great place to go when your about 5 drinks in if your sober you will probably walk right on out but overall a pretty cool place.",UNK
7002,"Worst experience at Black Angus ever, steaks weren't cooked right and they were really thin, waitress wasn't attentive at all. She even forgot the next tables salads until they were done eating. We won't be back.",UNK
7003,"Good meal.  I had fried shrimp, crab cakes, greens, rice and peas.  I had intended to order grilled, but the fried shrimp were delicious - excellent quality shrimp and you could taste it.  The crab cakes were also delicious.",UNK
7004,Service was very good.  Pizza was just okay.  I came here three years ago and have been thinking about the tiramisu.  They don't have it any more.  Bring it back...thats the reason I came here.  The dessert menu seriously lacks.,UNK
7005,"The patio area is just beautiful anytime of the day! I would recommend sitting outside if possible. \n\nThe menu is fantastic! My favorite items are the french fries and the mac and cheese. I know those are pretty juvenile dishes, but they are to die for!",UNK
7006,Weak wanna be chipotle don't waste your money.  I got a chicken burrito it was about ten bucks maybe a Lil more and taste was not to good,UNK
7007,Takeout was a miserable experience here. We were told 20-25 minutes for our pizza and it took an hour and a half. We were charged a service and delivery fee online and it was not refunded when we picked our pizza up.,UNK
7008,We went there for breakfast. We knew it has been a local favorite for years and wanted to give it a try.  The food and service was adequate but nothing special. We prefer other local spots to this one and probably won't rush back.,UNK
7009,"Terrible food. All food was served in a plastic tub and clearly had just been sitting under a heat lamp for hours. Skip the breakfast all together. Pink berry, Jamba Juice and several other great breakfast spots near concourse C and D.",UNK
7010,"Overall an OK airport, some works are being done in the departure area and I am sure this will help a great deal to improve the experience.",UNK
7011,"Fantastic service, communication, and results. I was almost glad that some clown hit me. I'll use again but I hope that I don't have to!",UNK
7012,Super friendly staff and incredibly helpful. Every tank is labeled and you cannot miss the price or type of fish. Got everything I needed for my new buddy Nuke LaLoosh just on my lunchbreak.,UNK
7013,"After seeing my review, this company contacted me to try rectify the situation, which is commendable. It was my choice to not bring my vehicles back again, though, since I just would question if the work would be done correctly this time. I have increased my rating due to their efforts.",UNK
7014,It is a cheap thrill to go up the incline. There is so much history. It is a great experience that doesn't take too much time (unless to spend a lot of time at the top of Mt. Washington taking pictures). It's perfect for locals and tourists to see the Pittsburgh skyline. It is an amazing sight!,UNK
7015,"We stayed recently in a very nice suite. Beautiful decor -- especially the tile floors in the entry, bathroom & powder room. Really enjoyed the spa and pool here. Standard Marriott level of service.",UNK
7016,"Thanks to Tiffany I'm in love with my nails :-)\n\nBest nail quality in Vegas, So good that I don't want to share my secrets =-) If you go, ask for Tiffany and tell her Little Blonde Nikki sent you!!",UNK
7017,"Food is so so. Staffs were rude. Might as well just go across the street to Jason's Deli. To add insult to injury, they overcharged us and refuse to issue partial refund.",UNK
7018,This place is great. Just like when would juice at home. It makes you feel good and gets you going for the day. I hope you love it like I do.,UNK
7019,"Do not go here.  They run a scam where they charge members an upgrade fee and they not only do not upgrade the poor ass gym, but they turn around and sell it to a new buyer who they tell they can \""charge an annual upgrade fee\"" and make some quick dough.",UNK
7020,Absolutely the best BBQ I've ever had. The brisket and the ribs are incredible! Please don't forget the corn bread and coleslaw. I've lived in Virginia for a few year and loved the BBQ there but this place blows any place in VA out of the water.,UNK
7021,Chile Roast Beef tacos were excellent! Daughter loved that you could make a ton of different drinks. Suggest going on Taco Tuesday...taco's 1.00 off,UNK
7022,"Decided to stop in here for breakfast and was not happy with the omelet.  The pancakes were ok I guess but nothing spectacular.   It was all cooked ok, just not the best recipe.  It's funny because I have had much better food at other Perkins.   It may be that it comes down to the chef.",UNK
7023,"This place deserves its name. The pho was as good as any I had elsewhere and the springrolls, both fried and raw, were delightful. The employees seemed overworked and nonchalant, however. I almost gave this place 5 stars.",UNK
7024,Angels received two stars only because it has a great draft beer selection.  Poor ownership/management decision to have last call @ 10:30 on a Thursday night and crappy acoustics ruin this place.  Downtown Phoenix has been dying to have a place like this.  So extend the hours of operation and install acoustics please!,UNK
7025,"This place is very cool as it sells a lot of everyday needs for cheaper cost.  They have a lot of different locations through out the state, definitely a good place to shop if you don't want to break your bank.",UNK
7026,"After one bite of the NY Strip steak I got the wow factor. Perfect char on the outside, perfect medium on the inside. The best steak I've had. Service is excellent too. The front desk, meh, not so much, but the steak gives Mesa 5 stars.",UNK
7027,This is our first time purchasing a home. Kevin B. was great! He took his time to go through his report right then and there with us and explained everything. Answered our questions and even gave us a few pointers. Very happy with the service.,UNK
7028,"dont come! u are better off. going to the seven eleven .food sucks !  way over price,\nn service was ok! but the food dosent have flavor, condiments or anything. yeahhhhh jjst dont go , u will regret it",UNK
7029,Amazing white Mexican rice like grandma makes.\nBeautiful tequila menu and\nCrazy good price for a 3 hour lay over...\nJust do it...\nLyle Silicon Valley california,UNK
7030,"Got the call and asked them how they can help because my wife has been fighting breast cancer for a year and a half and we're broke, they hung up on me.",UNK
7031,"Service was amazing. Drinks were great. Food was bland, no spice or heat to anything and over priced for what we ordered. We were shocked because the place was packed.",UNK
7032,"We got a medium pepperoni and also a medium sausage and mushroom. I have to say I thought the customer service was friendly and just fine, the pizza was good and we found ourselves wanting more of the sausage/mushroom.",UNK
7033,"Cheap and greasy, that pretty much sums it up. I tried their carne asada quesadilla and burger, both were okay- just as I imagined. \n\nThe cashier girl was nice, but the food took forever- definitely on the slow side.",UNK
7034,First rate DJ's such as DJ Steel spin here often and the light up dance floor is pretty cool but this place is always empty and it's the same bar that whisper was. Boring.,UNK
7035,"This is a review from a wine lover. Went here for a bday party and this place does not serve wine / liquor, only a few beers. Just writing this as an FYI to anyone expecting a variety of drink choices. Not a beer person....? Go somewhere else.",UNK
7036,"Feels a slight bit pricey, but overall tasty food and very friendly service. That about sums it up I think. Not remarkable, but definitely good enough.",UNK
7037,"When we lived on Central ave. I think this is a restaurant we visited. I am not positive though. The food was great, but the yelling at the woman out front from tha back got to us. So we stopped going. But as I said, I am not sure this is the place, but it the right location.",UNK
7038,"Great prices, friendly staff. Nicely organized. Excellent, I mean, rock bottom prices on pet supplies. Large dog crates for $10 - 15. Great organization to support to boot!",UNK
7039,"Possibly the worst chinese I've ever had. Very slow service.kung pow chicken was bland and the beef with string beans was better, but not much. I give it one star because it was close to my house.",UNK
7040,what a waste of time... service was the worse I have had in ages.. food was so so.. there are so many better places to go that care about the costumer.. will not go back...,UNK
7041,"It was a wonderful experience here.  The service made us feel welcome and important, the atmosphere was romantic and the menu was impeccable.  I hadn't seen my boyfriend in over a month and we were really glad we made Flemming's our date night.",UNK
7042,"This restaurant is fantastic!  In historic Glendale, it truly stands out (in a good way).  They have amazing food, fun music, and a good selection of beer.  Remember though- a Liter of beer is definitely bigger than a Pint.  If you do forget, there's a park caty-corner for naps!",UNK
7043,"I must say the fried chicken was below expectation, it was dry, bland and over-fried.  The waffles were just ok.  The portion was big, too big in my opinion.  I think they should focus on the quality rather than the quantity.",UNK
7044,I love this place! When the weather turns a bit cooler Joe's is the perfect place to sit out with the kids and enjoy a burger and the cool night air. Not only is the staff friendly the food is awesome! My little girl loves the mini-corn dogs and we always have a great time.,UNK
7045,"So good! Had the special salad with corn cilantro tomato onion and rice crisps, the chicken curry and garlic naan. So fire trucking good!",UNK
7046,"Took the family there opening night and had some grub and beers. Can't really say much about the beers, but I will say there were some highlights.\n\nThe sliders were awesome, and they played decent skate/surf videos most of the time I was there. I couldn't really ask for much more!",UNK
7047,"This store sucks.  The merchandise, teams, everything is limited.  The store looks 1/2 empty.  The employees are friendly but they enjoy chatter with each other more.  I rather hit the mall or online.",UNK
7048,"The food was excellent, if nothing mind shattering.  The restaurant was clean and the staff was attentive.  Maybe cost a little bit more then other Vegas buffets, but the food was good so it's not much of a complaint.",UNK
7049,"Umm...so I just ordered Mongolian Beef, but instead I got an order of Mongolian Peppers and Onions. Boo this place and it's reluctancy to use the cheap slices of beef that I crave when ordering greasy Chinese food.",UNK
7050,This is a decent Mexican restaurant with great staff and a relaxed environment. We had some wonderful beef enchiladas and a nice dining exerience.,UNK
7051,"I had dinner last night in this location. I love the 4 course menu. The food is yummy, but the service is a little slow, but friendly. I definitely come back.",UNK
7052,"Service was ok, but the food isn't anything close to the quality of sushi I am used to in California. Can't expect much in the desert I guess. The fish has a fishy taste suggesting it's not super fresh",UNK
7053,"entertaining show,\nmy 2 8 year old girs were amazed and laughed the whole time\n\ngreat way to spend the afternoon.",UNK
7054,"Food is great. Love the fresh homemade tortillas. And all the sauces there are amazing!  Love the potatoes they offer too.  Definitely a great place for lunch, does get pretty busy so I would recommend calling in your order if you are in a hurry. I will be coming back again soon!",UNK
7055,"Nice spot, try to check it on half price wine night (forget what night that is, sorry.)  Has good live music, good djs and pretty good drink prices.  A good place to see and be seen...",UNK
7056,"For a $36/person meal, I expected better.  Crab still had ice in it and was bath in salt.  Kobe rib-eye steak was tough, everything else was just OK.  Only good thing  was the lamb.  Not much selected in the dessert menu.",UNK
7057,The best part is definitely the bread. I brought my friends to try something different and we left happy. The location and menu may seem intimidating at first but everything we had tasted amazing.,UNK
7058,This is a small bar in the middle of the casino. The drinks are really pricy and you reek of smoke when you leave.,UNK
7059,Grabbed a couple of dozen bagels and took to work.  Man they don't last long.  Bagels are good and the service is friendly.  They were real busy but make time to chat will working.,UNK
7060,My favorite store in the state! Any chance I get I love to stop by this amazing Scottsdale Boutique. Very unique accessories & clothing. Everytime I wear something from this boutique I receive compliments left and right. A customer for ever!!\n\nDonna D. from Scottsdale,UNK
7061,"Harold has taken family photos for a Christmas card and newborn photos for my son. He's easy to work with, patient and understanding when it comes to kids and the photos turned out amazing! I also appreciated the quick turn around time!",UNK
7062,"I go here regularly for their Pad Thai or their Chicken Lo Mein. The food is consistently pretty good. But aside from one nice person I know personally, their staff is often unfriendly. I usually just order take-out because of the vibe.",UNK
7063,"My favorite place for enchiladas\n\nI order the same thing every time I'm here, standing joke that I even look at the menu. Enchiladas! Paul loves the creme of poblano soup, winter only.",UNK
7064,"If you liked the the original SkinnyFats, you'll love this place!  Same amazzzzing food with way more space.  There is an incredible vibe and the staff was super helpful and friendly.   \n\nI'm very excited for them!  And for me!!! \nCongrats!",UNK
7065,"The place is cool if you don't feel like going to a big club where it gets overcrowded.. the dress code is casual no hats no sandals, but shirts are OK. the music is good, and decor is lively, Finally If you can get in for free or close to it, this place is the place to be.",UNK
7066,"Had the ramen, yellowtail tar tar, eel roll with tempura (forgot the name), spider roll & honey toast. Everything was great! Worth the wait & I'll definitely eat there again when I'm in Vegas!",UNK
7067,Went there for lunch with my partner. Both of us ordered Thali chicken. Dish had way too much salt! Couldn't taste anything but salt. Dosa was too oily and Thali chicken had zero chicken meat only chicken bones. Awful! won't be back.,UNK
7068,We have ordered from this place a few times now and they are always fast and our food is always good. Their fried rice is amazing and so is their sesame tofu. I would recommend this place to anyone.,UNK
7069,I'am sorry to report the food here at Salvatore's stinks.  Nothing tasted very good. Thanks for the great service.,UNK
7070,"I love this restaurant and default to visiting here when I want Gyro's.  It's not the fanciest place, and is pretty small but the food is great and it's fun to watch the music video's on the TV.",UNK
7071,Excellent food and service. I enjoyed the burnt tips + potato salad. My friend's sweet potato fries were tasty. Sauce has a good kick! Dine early -  minimum seating.,UNK
7072,"Not great...lobster bisque tasted fishy, dirty martini was way too salty. Better than other airport options, but don't count on a great meal.",UNK
7073,"They have a lot of supplies and gear, but they act like everyone is just coming in to steal. They have students on the floor just to watch you at every moment and you have to get your bag (handbag/backpack) searched before you walk in!!? It is sooo weird..",UNK
7074,"Where simple syrup knows no bounds!\n\nCan you add simple syrup to a Manhattan? To just any drink?  You'll find out here! (The answer is, sadly, yes).",UNK
7075,These place is incredible it will not disappoint they are very nice they were very helpful the place I nice small joint they only have one table there so just pick up or delivery decent in price,UNK
7076,"This is one of my favorite locations. It was 2011 since my last visit and Katie remembered me from previous visits, particularly how I rant about Atlanta!  There is more that I like about Charlotte, including this place! I digress.\n\nKatie and Jamie are great bartenders both of them made a good Tom Collins!",UNK
7077,Love everything about this outdoor mall. Everything from the shops to the park to the eateries. First time seeing their Christmas tree too. What a great place.,UNK
7078,So glad we found this place! Everything is fresh and tastes just like we get when we are in Germany! Walked out with some fresh warm pretzels last week too!  This is our number one place for authentic German meat.,UNK
7079,"Great authentic Taiwanese food, nice bubble tea, minus one point for hard to find parking and the place is usually very packed during dinner. Good for small groups!",UNK
7080,"Just finished our take out- ordered on line and was ready when we got there.  Food was great!  Ordered the family meal B and there was plenty of food.  Have been looking for a good Chinese take out, this is it!  Will go back soon.",UNK
7081,Lyndee is so great!! She loves our dogs and takes such good care of the. I love that she is so knowledgeable about dogs too. I feel more comfortable leaving my babies with Lyndee .,UNK
7082,Food is amazing. Pasta is definitely their specialty and really it is great value. \n\nThe district is a little different but worth it.,UNK
7083,Terrible food!  I've tried three different entrees and they were all bad.  But it's a good spot to hangout and drink   Drinks are cheap and there is a large seating area for large groups.  Eat before you come!!\n0 stars for food\n4 for bar\nAverage: 2,UNK
7084,"I'm Latina and recently moved to Charlotte. Tacos El Nevado has really good tacos.  The place isn't at all fancy and you'll only see a few people in there, but the tacos are delicious.  Try their horchata too!    La comida esta sabrosa!",UNK
7085,"Terrible food, cold bread and buns. Grill marks on cold dry bread. My friend asked for a sample of brisket before ordering a platter and was told no. You can tell they do not know BBQ or sauces. Nice bar.",UNK
7086,"I'm @ panera 5 days a week and its always five stars. All the staff and management are great. Nick, Luke and Angela are always more than helpful. When it comes to food it's hard finding a place that's consistent. I highly recommend the bagels they are soft and fresh and perfect to start the day.",UNK
7087,I had a very unpleasant exchange with the owner/manager today. I would not recommend this place to anyone- there are better options. Trust me.,UNK
7088,"The Super Burrito and Taco Salad were amazing. It's a nice small restaurant with a walk up counter. Even if you don't live in the neighborhood, it's worth the drive.",UNK
7089,"I've been playing for a few sessions now and love it here. I'm on a social league and the refs call the games as such, which is nice to see. They are fair and friendly. Turf is in good shape. Win or lose, my team is known to stay after for some delicious beer and popcorn.",UNK
7090,Solid mexican spot. They have quality food even though it may be too salty at times. Their drinks could be stronger. I've always had a good time here.,UNK
7091,Is this place serious?! The Manager here needs to be fired. I had to interject at the Manager making excuses at a nearby table. What a joke. This place should be happy it is so busy. Hire more help and quit complaining to your paying customers. Time for a new restaurant at LAS.,UNK
7092,This is a hotel for a couple night stay not for a long period of time. The bed was hard and the pillows too soft. The front desk clerk in the morning had a major attitude for what who knows. Like I said good for a 1-2 night stay only,UNK
7093,This is the closest to Waffle House in the south...THE PERFECT DRUNK FOOD!,UNK
7094,"This hotel is outdated. The floors and rooms look like a movie set for an 80's themed hotel. From the baby blue hallways to the grandma and grandpa styled wall paper, this room needs a serious over haul. Especially for the price.",UNK
7095,"Overpriced, tiny portions. sigh. My friends said that they loved the HH specials... so maybe I'd suggest giving that a try. The service was pretty awesome, but sadly, the food couldn't deliver. Just expect to spend a lot of money for sub-par food.",UNK
7096,"Tried their 3\"" breakfast wrap with white eggs and it was soooo delish! I chose the Sweet Onion dressing, which I think really \""made\"" the wrap unforgettable!",UNK
7097,One Barrel is still a cool spot in the Atwood neighborhood! Great beer and atmosphere. A pretty casual place and totally not pretentious.,UNK
7098,Don't go there total waste of time and money.  The door guys are rude liars. Ten dollar cover even after 1:30,UNK
7099,"Good froyo but this place does not offer some toppings that I'm used to like waffle cone pieces; otherwise, I like everything about this place!",UNK
7100,"Love/Hate relationship with this place. Love it when I arrive, hate it when I leave. They seemed to have spread out the airport a bit. Luckily, checking in and going through security has never been a problem for me. Have never tried the slots at the airport as I feel they are destined to eat your money.",UNK
7101,The lines for the shows were amazingly long and a real turn off.  This is a major hotel and entertainment venue and quite frankly they could do better.  There were many times while at The Mirage that it appeared they could use more staff and help.,UNK
7102,"After posting negative reviews all over the internet and threatening to dispute on my credit card, I got a replacement dryer! Yay! It works perfectly. Although I would still never buy anything else here. Way too much hassle.",UNK
7103,"Beware there is a significant resort charge hidden until checked in by which time it is too late. Be prepared to feel cheated and swindled! Otherwise it is a great hotel especially for the price. Also odd though is there is no self parking only valet which is free, but can take a while especially during checkout.",UNK
7104,Excellent cod fish fry! The cheesey hashbrowns and coleslaw was yummy as well.\nQuick service. Friendly staff. Fun atmosphere. Definitely one of my favorite Friday fish frys in Madison.,UNK
7105,Always love bringing folks here for the first time. Awesome selection of games. It seems they are going to outgrow this spot. Tonight had the most machines I've seen there.  I enjoy the older 50s and 60s games as well as the new. \nClean fun date night - any night. Highly recommend.,UNK
7106,"The Dr that saw me was awesome, I would recommend this place to anyone. When I first got there I was immediately greeted, got to filling out my paperwork, and before I knew it, I was ready for my appointment.",UNK
7107,Finally made it into this great restaurant after hearing good things about it. The food was all good for all four in our party but the prices seamed too high and the service was a little inattentive. I plan to give it another try. I'll also dress a little nicer to blend with all the clientele that frequent the establishment.,UNK
7108,Worst parking on the planet. \n\nThe parking spaces were meant for mini-coopers. If you are paranoid about dings park elsewhere. \n\nRobert Pfeifer,UNK
7109,All I have to say is KOBE BEEF!!!!\nEverything else is pretty much what you can expect from a high end joint.\nThe whole rotating thing is pretty awesome too.,UNK
7110,This place is great. I have had my daughters pictures done here several times. I gave it three stars though because it is a little pricey. You also have to get a great photographer. Some are better than most and are able to catch better expressions.,UNK
7111,I love this place! Food is good and all the bartenders are hilarious! Whenever I am in town now I always make sure to stop by and have some drinks and a bite to eat.  Love that there is always live music too!,UNK
7112,"This place is ok, but I think it is totally overrated.  The lack of spices on the food really brought down the level of taste. If it wasn't for the $20 coupon we got in the mail, we would not have come here.",UNK
7113,Came here around 2pm to take a lil dessert back to the hotel! This place was crowded and hot. Outside was cooler! I didnt like this place because of it being crowded and hot inside.,UNK
7114,Great for vegetarians and meat lovers. Yummy muffins were a highlight. We were a group of 5 and had to wait a bit but that was okay as we were seated within 10-15 minutes of arrival. \n\nEverything was made from scratch. The stuffed french toast is a must.,UNK
7115,"Tasty, but random.  Do not order a chocolate shake it is kinda cold watery chocolate milk...  the pizza is good though.",UNK
7116,thank you for delivering my pizza on time not thank you for delivering it to a wrong address... a great customer service is calling customer's if they received there orders... waited two hours...,UNK
7117,"Not really a sushi place. More like a sports bar. They are the kings of spicy imitation crab. It's everywhere, on everything. Even just laying around the plate for \""presentation\"". This is our last visit.",UNK
7118,"The breakfast sandwich is terrible, the donuts are terrible, the hot chocolate is not bad.  I came back a 2nd time (because i had a coupon).  Still terrible AND they would not accept the coupon.  Yes location was listed, expiration date valid, manager present, refused.",UNK
7119,"Matthew at the Genius Bar (English guy) was over the top helpful.  Super nice guy and fixed my problems with ease.  He helped me fix my iPhone last year, but I never got a chance to write about it until now.  If his manager reads this, give this guy a raise.....or your job lol.",UNK
7120,"Great atmosphere, great wine, GREAT service and great appetizers to share like the amazing cheese board. Their happy hour is a great deal too.",UNK
7121,Food was good but our waiter was horrible and our lunch (at 2 in the afternoon) took over 2 hours because the service was so slow.,UNK
7122,Ordered the chicken tender wrap tossed in signature Tilted Kilt's Sweet n Spicy sauce.  Just ok.  Not enough signature sauce.  Very good service.  Crowded and vibrant before Fri eve Suns game,UNK
7123,"first time there tonight,being from new york i know great italian food,i had the chicken parm with pene & soup. the owners & the people that work there are very nice.will definitely be back real soon for another great meal.",UNK
7124,"Overall is a good place to eat. It's a tasty sandwich for a cheap price, specially considering the location.\nI had the all American sandwich which I liked but didn't loved because it had cranberries on it. My boyfriend had the cannonball and loved it.",UNK
7125,This store is so suburban 1998.  Everything is embellished or bedazzled.  The woman who owns the place is probably one of the rudest people i have ever met in my life.  She is about 68 years old and dresses like she is 12.  The prices are very high.  Don't waste your money or time.,UNK
7126,I would give 3.5 BUT this region is starved of decent restaurants and this the only decent one I have eaten at in two trips (2 x 3 days)  to the area. I will go again if / when I am forced to stay out that way again.,UNK
7127,Nothing but noodles has a great selection of noodle dishes. Everything from Japanese to my Italian Favorites. I enjoy their spicy Japanese Noodles with Chicken. These guys also have bread sticks that are neck and neck with the Olive Garden.,UNK
7128,It's like Mexican food without being super greasy. Else everything is good here. Service is good as well.  Wish this place was bigger that's all.,UNK
7129,Do not go. Not open. Closed down took us ages to get to location. Even the food side of it seemed damp and dark. Unattractive and all over waste of time.,UNK
7130,I love the rooftop at Bar Smith especially as the weather gets nicer.  I went for a party last night and it was great.  Two different types of music one downstairs and one on the rooftop.  The drinks are not overpriced and usually there is a good crowd there.  The bar staff is great and always helpful unlike many Scottsdale clubs.,UNK
7131,"XGolf Scottsdale is a great place to learn, refine and enhance your golf game in a fun atmosphere. I look forward to my next trip to see Scott & Bruce, They are both very knowledgeable and experienced golf professionals. The XGolf simulator provides a realistic, accurate simulation experience.",UNK
7132,"jail sucks, worst food ever!  Plus the people there stink and are mean...dont go, its not fun.   Stay home instead, or take a taxi home, dont drink and drive!",UNK
7133,Great coffee and I am a home roasting person so I am very picky. Also they have pastries from La Brioche which are excellent. Highly recommended.,UNK
7134,"I moved to California ~2 years ago and miss Mardi Gras more than anything else. Richie and crew provided a home for all, the writers, designers, storytellers and more who found ourselves adrift and looking to share our story. Can't wait to get back one day.",UNK
7135,"Nice atmosphere outside, inside was very crowded. The food was missing something and the hot drinks were served cold. Liberty Market is a much better bet for brunch.",UNK
7136,last week had 3 different servers take my beer order....got beer 15 min later then never saw another server in next 45 min. complained. nothing happened and charged me for beer.  Good Management....not,UNK
7137,was here twice. was kinda 'meh' both times. food is okayyyyy.... bartender took a while before noticing we existed.,UNK
7138,"Ok, so perhaps in all fairness, this place just wasn't really my scene. We walked in and they had a live country band on stage with a stripper ....only in Vegas, right? We sat for about 10min waiting for the cocktailer, and then got up and left....the place was empty.",UNK
7139,"I didn't actually realize the type of restaurant that this was before I went, so that sure was a suprise.\n\nI didn't really care that much for the food though and doubt I would go back. This just wasn't what I had in mind when I was looking for an Irish restaurant.",UNK
7140,Purchased a Groupon for a Brazilian Wax with Sandra.  Very pleased with a meticulous and as pain free wax as you possibly can get!  Scale of 1-10 pain: 1.5!  Will be going back next month and excited to try some of her other skin care services as well!,UNK
7141,Must have ordered the wrong item. I ordered the chicken pho and the chicken was inedible - leathery. I complained to our server and he apologized but did not  offer to change my order. The egg roll was good though.,UNK
7142,Very nice! The hash browns and egg benedict are sooo great. I get soooooooo full. And the menu has so many choices that I am looking forward to try.,UNK
7143,"My grandma loves marzipan. My mother and grandmother went into The Chocolate Box to check and see if they sold any. When they asked the clerk they were told, \""I don't know. I just work here.\"" They turned around and walked out. We'll never be back.",UNK
7144,"Mediocre.... That's all I can say about this place. Limited drink option, ok sushi, ok service and ok price. No wait on Saturday night, I guess that was good. They have reverse happy hour from 9 pm daily with pretty limited selection.",UNK
7145,"Pizza always tastes good, and their fingers might even out weight their pizza. Great customer service. Not a big fan of their ranch dressing (i use it on everything). It left a bad after taste, not only with me, but with my wife as well.",UNK
7146,good awesome fresh food. we ate at this place all the 4 days we stayed in las vegas. Good portion and quality food. awesome paneer tikka masala and naan bread. They say best bread! i would recommend.,UNK
7147,I have been to this place about 6 times and counting! It's fast service and ALWAYS good food! I love the brownies and have to order it with my sandwiches. Price is perfect and it's open late!,UNK
7148,"This is a good Costco.  I do wish they had the hand scanners like the Chandler Costco.  But the store is clean and has all the Costco services (optical, pharmacy, bakery, etc).\n\nOf course, you will always spend more than you planned here.  It seems unavoidable.",UNK
7149,I had my hair done by Kim at the Salon in this Ulta.  She did a FANTASTIC job. I couldn't be more happy with the way it turned out.  I will definitely be going back to her for other services.,UNK
7150,"Great atmosphere, owners and employees extremely friendly. Great Happy Hour. If you want a really cool contemporary place to hang I suggest Republic Kitchen.",UNK
7151,"I was pretty nervous about going here because of some of the reviews, since I've never been there before. The fees definitely suck but it really wasn't that bad, I have been to venues that were much worse.",UNK
7152,"I just tried Crust for the first time today and I am in love!  True to the name, the crust is crispy and tastes like a breadstick (they use parm cheese and garlic butter).  Prices are reasonable I'll be back for more!",UNK
7153,Food is above average but the value is average. Wait times during lunch can be quite long. Good veg options is that is your thing.  Overall nothing that strongly makes me want to go back.,UNK
7154,Great meal EVERY time. We had Marianne as our server and she was fantastic!  Chile relleno omelet is amazing and not to be missed. They do half sizes as well. A must try in Las Vegas!,UNK
7155,"My favorite place.  I love their Tostada Salad lines so much. I love the salsa also.  I miss the caramel Fran, which is no longer available. Chicken is also good.  Sure I often visit there for.  One downside is I feel their Ice tea does not taste well to me.",UNK
7156,Worst service ever.  Waited at table for 15 min no service the went to bar and took order 90 people running around but no one carries,UNK
7157,"\""Under New Management\"" apparently this means \""Do it with less staff\"". Want your check? I wish you luck!  The wait staff is actually running to try to tend to customers.",UNK
7158,"Sometimes public transportation can be scary...but not here. At least 90% of the riders are tourists. In my opinion, you can't beat $7 for 24 hrs.",UNK
7159,It sucks!!! My room didnt have a trash can! The couch bed was full of springs and cover! But it was roomy and had alot of channels no elevator or handicapped equivalent.,UNK
7160,Based on the buffet\nFree if you sign up for a players card! If your in Vegas ride the deuce up here and have a free meal! The food was good considering it was free... Even the drink is included!,UNK
7161,"Awesome.  I was a bit skeptical, but the food was delicious, fresh and hot.  The crab legs were great, unfortunately, they never had enough out and people where waiting by the crab dish like they were starving.  They have a great selection of food.",UNK
7162,"Loved it.  Light and tasty soup and chewy noodles and Spam(!),what's not to like?  Price is not bad.  In Japan ramen runs about $10 so count your blessings.",UNK
7163,"I love Gail, the kids club childcare provider in this gym....she's awesome and my son loves it there...\nThe yoga classes are really challenging and this gym has stand up tanning booths and offers massage services as well.  Clean gym!",UNK
7164,Update : quality is still great but a bit pricy for the college pocket. Service was awesome and I love their fried calamari with the fried jalape\u00f1os .... yum yum,UNK
7165,So far so good.  Just signed a lease and started moving stuff in.  Staff is nice.  Havent really met many neighbors yet but so far so good!,UNK
7166,Why does your description  on bitesquad say Hawaiian  food? We ( the people of Hawaii) do not put teriyaki sauce on Kalua pork. Please fix your description  because your menu obviously has nothing to do with Hawaii.,UNK
7167,"We had dinner at Echo&Rig 2 weeks ago.The food was phenomenal! However, the restaurant was so loud I couldn't hear what was said at the table. It had the atmosphere of the sports bar not a sophisticated restaurant.",UNK
7168,"Bad service, not true about free drinks on cards, women pay $15 for open bar but men go in free.  However, simple drinks for men are $11 and up.",UNK
7169,"I love this little fruit stand. Their produce is delicious and very affordable. They also sell cheap plants for gardens, and little extras like Amish jam and honey. I highly recommend checking it out if it's not too far out of your way.",UNK
7170,"perfect early Thai dinner.... spicy Musscles ...  Tad Pad with Shrimp and Chicken , perfect fit for a early dinner., no RUSH crowd here if you arrive a week night early dinner    Good food, great price !",UNK
7171,This place is great. Makes a joke of Monterey bay. For less than half the price get twice the meal. Try the porgy.,UNK
7172,"Great food, but this location is always busy so it's not a good place to go if you don't have a couple hours to eat your meal. If they are busy, it could be difficult if you need extra accomodations. Not that they aren't willing to help, just a lack of space.",UNK
7173,"The Taurus team just finished helping us move almost our entire home in one trip. We had a heavy bar and a nice fridge which they babied like it was their own. Very quick and professional, we would absolutely call them for our next move!",UNK
7174,Hit the drive thru here with my husband about a month ago and came down with an awful round of food poisoning. Stay away from this Taco Bell like the plague.,UNK
7175,"This place was ridiculous. Not only were the \""Tuna tacos\"" literally one bite each (3 served on the entire plate) but it took 20 minutes and numerous mentions to our server that we needed our check. I was highly disappointed, I expected more from Hubert Keller :(",UNK
7176,Needed to have my phone repaired today...checked in at 3:30...wasn't helped until 5:03.  This is the same case scenario everytime I have to go in...which is a lot because my phone blows!!!  :/,UNK
7177,"Fantastic experience all around! My husband made reservations here and the food was great, service was stellar, just a wonderful experience. Definitely different than most restaurants but the change was awesome.",UNK
7178,If I could live here I would! The service is second to none and each room is unique.\nThey just added a B-cycle bike share kiosk and that's a major bonus. My wife and I have stayed here 3 times already and hope to get back soon for a 2 night stay.,UNK
7179,Went after seeing the place on triple D. The food was very good but the portions sucked. The chicken tika and korma were both boned when should be boneless. No buffet for lunch and prices were good. I will give it another try in the future,UNK
7180,"Ordered delivery from these idiots, 1.5 hours later I call them and they haven't even started making it and are actually out of half the stuff I ordered. Sooo, you were just sitting there waiting for me to call you to tell me that? Zero stars.",UNK
7181,Food was great and was a nice change from the standard Mexican joint. Atmosphere was kinda like a cafeteria and lighting was way too bright. That said the food was a solid 3.5 stars. Atmosphere 2 with an average of 3.,UNK
7182,Lunch w/my best friend and we both loved our selections!! I had the Fish Taco's and she had the Wild Mushroom Enchilada. So much flavor and colorful presentation!  Try the hand squeezed Limonade!!!,UNK
7183,"Average Mexican food, chips and salsa. Fast on lunch menu service. Chicken Chimichanga was decent, added red sauce.",UNK
7184,"I like the Cheesecake Factory menu, but the portions, calories, and sodium and fat counts are really too much. I like their happy hour, however.",UNK
7185,Ordered Pad Thai with level 4 spiciness. It is not that spicy but I think it is a bit too oily for me. Pad Thai from Thai Caf\u00e9 is much better.,UNK
7186,"Do not come here if you do not have at least an hour to wait for your order. It took them forever to get a pasta, and when asked they said it takes time to cook. \nSTAY AWAY!",UNK
7187,Our meal looked nothing like the pictures people have posted. The service was terrible and I wasn't impressed the the food. Definitely won't go back.,UNK
7188,"I can't fathom why this place doesn't have a solid 5 stars. Best custard I've had out here, hands down.",UNK
7189,"Great service !!!\nFood was good, not spectacular, but very good.\nThey had some crative rolls and a few really good appetizers.\n\nCool little spot that kinda hides in a non descript spot ,\nI will certainly be back if I get a chance before leaving town",UNK
7190,"Not so fresh, taste bland and generally sea food away from the ocean is a bad idea.  This has just confirmed my belief.  Atmosphere is nice though.",UNK
7191,THis place is going out of business - it was nice b/c they had some pretty cool pre-cooked meals. I used my reward card to get some pretty nice free stuff.  I have to say that it was way more affordable than most of the other stores and I'm going to miss them.,UNK
7192,"Read carefully!! The food was great!! My food was awesome!! Again, Food gets 5 stars!!!! However, the service SUCKED!!\nOur waitress was just not good. She tried to do nothing but upgrade us. No drink refills. After we got our food she was gone!!",UNK
7193,"What a great pub!  Tim's has a great atmosphere, a good selection of beers and amazing food.  Every time we go we've always had great service.",UNK
7194,Everyone knows Target - cool stuff and needed items all in one place at an OK price.  I also get my pharmacy items here as well.  I'll be back.,UNK
7195,Sonoran Dogs-Yum! Horchata.... Bottled Mexican sodas....this place makes me miss trips to mexico,UNK
7196,"Poor service and over priced for small portions. The first item I asked for on their menu they informed me could not be made as it was too difficult to get correct. Waiter was gruff and formal, to the point of being rude. Would not eat here again. The small portion of salmon I received was decent but way overpriced.",UNK
7197,"I have to say, Armando was fantastic!!! I truly had one of the best massages I have EVER had, and I have had a lot in my time. I will definitely be going back to see him as well as recommend him to all my friends and family.",UNK
7198,"I love this QT!  I usually don't eat the roller dogs but the spicy chicken are the bomb. The heat then up so hot and they always keep plenty on the rollers.  I guess a guilty pleasure. \n\nOutside of that, clean & fast...just the way I need it.",UNK
7199,"Excellent salads! You can't beat this level of quality, and service for these prices and convenience. They were even nice to our dog that they saw in the car. They are restaurant quality.",UNK
7200,"Love love love this place! It is my favorite restaurant in Phoenix. Charleen amazes me every time I eat there. She is so talented. The service is always great, Pavle and Chantelle are amazing!",UNK
7201,"People Listen ~ Please, Please, just like everyone else posting there rating, do NOT use this service or you too will be a VICTIM. Horrible customer service, called for over a week left repeated messages and got no response!",UNK
7202,"Pedestrian and boring Thai food for the masses. If your idea of exotic is Pad Thai, then this is the place for you. No heat, no flavour, no imagination.\n\nServer lacked enthusiasm, obviously a common trend here throughout the restaurant.",UNK
7203,"gross food, sticky floor, dirty bathrooms, chicken like jerky. For desert a COCKROACH crawled across our table! We told an employee and she laughed. We will never return.",UNK
7204,"Truly one of the best experiences I have had upon check in!!! Both Jay, the shuttle driver and bellman and Walt, the front desk representative were friendly, professional and very courteous! They both made my late night arrival much more pleasant!!! Exceptional service all around!! Thank you!",UNK
7205,This place just doesn't feel very comfortable.  I get a very odd feeling when I am in the restaurant.  It is like eating in a fishbowl.  Everyone seems to have an air of snottiness.  Food is kind of pricey.,UNK
7206,This place is packed on a Friday night!  The service is so so so slow.  The food on the menu is interesting- soft pretzels with mustard and so on.  My drink was good and I enjoyed the outside bar.,UNK
7207,its ok pinoy food it will never beat your mom or your tita's food but if you have an itch its not the worse fast food pinoy stuff in the world but certainly not something im not going to write home about...,UNK
7208,"First time in. Looks great inside. Sign said seat yourself. Not too busy, plenty of seats. Sat for 15 minutes, no acknowledgement, so we left. I'm sure no one noticed. Bummer.",UNK
7209,"dirty, too many flies, the staff does not wear gloves, it is gross, and the food is awful,\nand, not good, the utensils are never clean, tables are dirty all the time, flies everywhere.  IT IS THE WORST PLACE TO EAT.",UNK
7210,"Great food, great music, apps are amazing.  Best \""party\"" steakhouse in town...you will not have a better time anywhere.",UNK
7211,"This is a fun little taco shop; prices are good and food is good. A great late night munchies spot. I enjoy their salsa bar, they have all the traditional fixings for you to help yourself to. It's a bit on the cheaper side but pretty good overall.",UNK
7212,AG always offers a great dining experience and once again that was the case. Steaks are amazing but the Sea Bass is my wifes go-to dinner there.,UNK
7213,Starting to slip. Went in for dinner at 5:00 on a Thursday. Not crowded but took 15 mins for food to arrive. The two parties before us had to return to the counter for missing items which backed up things further.  Wonder what things will be like when the snowbirds return.,UNK
7214,"Ya.  It's Hooters.  Cleaner than most.  Often slightly better than McDonalds.  Loaded Tater Tots are made to go with beer.  Ya... umm...  definitely a fan of the service staff.  I mean... that's the point, right?",UNK
7215,"I was a little shocked at the appearance of the pizza. Granted, I got it to go. But it had white cheese and was super thin. It tasted \""ok.\"" I'm sure I'll go back bc the have a great pino...but I'll probably order the wings.",UNK
7216,i still miss Zen 32!  i really like the vibe insides but everytime i go for sushi at stingray my pocket book is much lighter and i leave wanting more and better.  \n\nthe deck that they put in is freaking amazing and they have a pretty good HH.,UNK
7217,"Service was a bit slow today and they ran out of the French vanilla creamer,  But my French Toast was right on.  The food is still worth the wait here.",UNK
7218,"Got repetitive, real quick. Too many things going on. I feel that every motion should be meaningful. This was not the case, it felt that half the times performers were waiting for their queue. One great thing about this is the stage. Anywhere you sit is a good seat.\nVerdict: Go watch the O show instead.",UNK
7219,"Spent a morning here working and connecting with a few friends and loved it. Coffee is great, service was friendly.\n\nI think the place could use a little TLC as far as the furniture is concerned but nothing that would keep me away in the future. Looking forward to working here again in the future.",UNK
7220,"I wish NoVa had a venue like this! There was a $10 cover to see Fuel, but was well worth it! We enjoyed sitting on the patio of the saloon and watching them play! Awesome place!",UNK
7221,"They ran out of soup and didn't make more. \n\nNo apology or caring attitude. Just, 'No more soup for you.'\n\nNow I have to find another subway and drive further from home.",UNK
7222,"Joe's service is fast and friendly, entertaining atmosphere and lots of food for a decent price.  Wish they would give you more sides, the platter is full of fish though.",UNK
7223,This is my new favorite Thai place. I have tried a number of dishes and all are delicious. The pumpkin tofu curry is only great and I have recommended this dish and this place tomany people. I was disappointed at the amount I was served at dinner time. I may just stick to take out and lunch. Fabulous.,UNK
7224,Waiting room is not very comfortable. Too busy on a Friday be prepared for lots of upgrades. Good luck with just an oil change.  They are good and fast just keep at an oil change only.,UNK
7225,"First  time at this jersey mike I wasn't disappointed. The staff was very friendly and the cheese steak was off the chain. When ever I'm in the area THIS jersey mike will be on my \""TO DO\"" list",UNK
7226,"I paid $55 for a glass of wine, watered down \""gin cooler\"" and suckey fried rice. Parking not included",UNK
7227,Decent food. We ordered cod fish tacos and salmon with quinoa which was listed as lifestyle menu. My entree side was kale salad which was not my favorite. Drinks were good and service was nice but slow.,UNK
7228,"This is quickly becoming my favorite place to eat out! Everything I have had here has been excellent. The shrimp po boy is wonderful and the gumbo, wow! I tried the catfish for the first time today and it was perfect. Every time I leave this place I'm planning the next time I'm going to come back.",UNK
7229,"Been going here for a while.  Continues to get better.  There are quite a few regulars from the neighborhood and I would say that business is improving.  Maybe the economy is getting better.  Anyway, I think it is the best place I have found to watch a game outside of Chicago and the patio is second to none.",UNK
7230,"My 4- year old likes this place. He was disappointed that they stopped giving out balloons. The food is Ok and they have a respectable beer and cocktail selection.  As far as the food, it is predictable and decent.",UNK
7231,We went for the Kansas concert. The venue was a little on the small size but it worked very well. It sounded a. Amazing but did not go overboard on how loud it is.,UNK
7232,Expect for a loooooong(Over 1hr) wait even if you pick up at midnight. There were only four peolpe in front of me.,UNK
7233,Great burger and wings as always! But customer service could have been better.. I had to wait a while for the food and my beer but otherwise than that good,UNK
7234,"It's a pretty good place. It's open late and is very close to campus. The food is good, but the people working there are usually pretty rude.",UNK
7235,"I guess it's not fair for me to review this place while I didn't get there until the last minute of lunch buffet... I was actually surprised they let us in. Food was old and dried by then, but they sure tasted great. Next time, I'll come earlier.",UNK
7236,Nice but to small for the price. Walk through is to short. They should take out some of the jungle trees and put more tanks in. And more interactive things for kids.,UNK
7237,"Staff was very friendly. Salad was fresh. Pizza was good, about a 3 star rating, but the thing that pushed the rating to a 4 star was the cinnamon rolls - wow, they are good. I wish I could get them in the morning with my Starbucks.",UNK
7238,"Everything about this place was nice, the atmosphere, the waiter, the salad, awesome bread, my husbands steak... sadly my steak was well done and dry instead of meium rare like I requested. I could have sent it back but I didn't feel like waiting for another to cook.",UNK
7239,My toddler found a dead mouse under one of the seats. Prior to that it was overpriced and underwhelming. Avoid!,UNK
7240,Can I give zero stars? Guess not. Stay away. Not a good value unless you get what you expect from a nationally known brand. Dirty towels. DIRTY TOWELS found instead of clean. How can you trust them?! And zero customer service.\nGood luck if you try them.,UNK
7241,"Great Far Eastern menu, large portion sizes, and very tasty.  Servers were attentive, cordial, and accomodating.  The ambiance lends to private and quiet conversation.  I would recommend this restaurant and plan on visiting it regularly.",UNK
7242,"I went to comfort hotel,  and they give me room number 177 and it has bed bugs!!!! And it Bite us....and I do have the pics for it! that's so terrible!!",UNK
7243,"Very unhappy with the sales person. I wanted click flooring, got home and it needed to be glued. Lost some money and a lot of time. Will never go back!",UNK
7244,"We been waiting for about 20 minutes,  went inside to check out the place,  big surprise... place has plenty of available tables,  I guess they do this so they can force you to buy the DIAMOND pass,  another $20.00 extra, and you don't have to wait in line... food is ok",UNK
7245,Nice theatre. Service was great food was good. Doors opened late staff at the door has MAJOR attitude. How about some smiles and friendly greetings to welcome your paying guests?,UNK
7246,I returned to remiix and the food was even more amazing that I remember than the first time. I had Steak and frites and it was delicious. I love the chimy churry!!! Fantastic meal and great value. Will be back with my new friends soon!!,UNK
7247,"I was so disappointed when I had my favorite \""salads rolls\"" and the sauce came out tasting like snot! Very friendly though.",UNK
7248,"Excellent service, good ambiance. The sushi here was above average with decent size rolls and nigiri. I gave 4 stars because the price was very reasonable",UNK
7249,The best Jalape\u00f1o burger in town!  Deep fried Jalape\u00f1os a half pound burger that is cooked to perfection!\n\nI have had it three times and each time it was awesome!,UNK
7250,Atmosphere is great! Food is not. Had the pasta w meatballs which consisted of a bowl of gummy flavorless pasta w 2 small meatballs for $15.00. I left hungry and went home and ate a PB&J sandwich.,UNK
7251,Making our reservation with Rick was very easy and efficient. Our driver Glen was prompt and very friendly. He picked us up both ways on time and made our night complete not having to worry about driving. Can't wait to use the service again.,UNK
7252,"Walked in and the waitress was sitting watching a cooking show, slow to get up. Beer was flat and she never offered a menu. She then got her laptop and set it up next to us and stayed on that till we were ready for the check for our flat beer.",UNK
7253,"tried to sell services I didn't need!  Only place in the area to take your car too and they know it, so they stick it you on the prices!  Buyer beware!",UNK
7254,"We happened upon this jewel will traveling in the Madison area.  You have to stop if you are nearby.  They give samples of their fruits, salsas, cheeses and dips.  You won't go away empty handed.  They also have a great selection of micro-brewery beers.  Everything was good.",UNK
7255,"I really did like this place.  The food is very good.  I really liked the French onion soup & their burgers are great, as is the steak.  The prices are a good value and I will be going back.",UNK
7256,Had a couple drinks here while in Vegas. I guess it's the largest chandelier in the world. Pretty cool. The bar is set up inside the chandelier. It's a very quiet bar. Good place to chat with friends or whatever.,UNK
7257,"Said I wouldn't go back and I should have listened to my own advice.  Once again service slow, food not what i ordered and the meal definitely not worth the money.  Great concept but the food on the menu looks way better than what you actually receive.  I am definitely never going back!",UNK
7258,Staff was terrible they broke our burrito 3 times they were extremely stingy with salsa and cheese. They were also very rude. They could use some manners,UNK
7259,Went here for Cinco De Mayo for a a margarita. They were pretty good and not over priced. Very cool looking building! Service was pleasant but overall the restaurant wasn't overly impressive but I would still go back agian!,UNK
7260,"Jennifer North is way better. However unlike Justine, I do like the Bestey Johnson, the Theory, and most importantly the Eileen Fischer line. How can you not love comfort and sleekness all in one? Anyway, I will check back here whenever I stop by Cafe Kopi because after all they're attached.",UNK
7261,"I prefer Ghengis Grill.  YC's menu was confusing.  Staff is plenty helpful, but I just did not enjoy the restaurant.",UNK
7262,Very disappointed and confused the hours are listed as 11am to 11pm called at 10:35 and JENNIFER claims the kitchen is closed and refused to take my order.  What kind if restaurant says they are open until 11 but refuses to take an order at 10:35???,UNK
7263,"Had a great experience at this spa. Had a body scrub and a massage done by Joanne, both were great. Definitely will come back next time I'm in Vegas.",UNK
7264,Great and tasty meat! Superb place off the touristic LV strip. The ribs and the Brisket were perfectly cooked. The outlaw burger was huge but had all the flavours it needed. We will for sure visit this place again on our next visit in Sin City :-),UNK
7265,"I was thinking about a particular camera, and Edward walked me through every feature of that camera as well as the highlights of similar models.  He also told me to come back in a week with all my questions.  Biggs is not only a retailer, but they give crash courses in photography for novices like me!",UNK
7266,STUNNING!!!!!!!!!!!!! this casino was SO beautiful. just go walk around. thats all I did. maybe next time we will stay there - perfect location!,UNK
7267,"The food is not the reason to go. The place is glam, and it predominately used for Essex lookalikes.",UNK
7268,Had the bucatini & meatballs. The bucatini & sauce were delicious but did not like the meatballs. They had raisins mixed in. I had the large portion & for the price it was way overpriced.,UNK
7269,"Sandwich was ruined by my getting it \""grilled\"" sandwich was soggy with butter...most disgusting thing ever. Insanely greasy. A napkin didn't even help!!",UNK
7270,This place was just ok.  Way too busy with no where to sit or stand to wait without being in the way and they really seemed to rush through my pedicure.,UNK
7271,"Just dropped off a pre-paid label package.  A young lady was on duty.  Very cheerful.  This was a dead-easy transaction.  Drop off package, get receipt.  Other than having to wait in line (there was one person ahead of me), it was quick and easy.",UNK
7272,"The special (one of them anyway) was a slice with meatball, pepperoni and sausage. Really tasty and on great crust, light and crispy with a bit of chew. I'll be back. Great outdoor seating spot that is on the shade at lunch!",UNK
7273,As malls go this one is pretty decent. Large and modern with lot's of popular brands/stores. I like the movie theater here plus they have several good restaurants in/near the mall.,UNK
7274,"Amazing performers...top notch. These swimmers knew exactly what they were doing, and boy, did they know how to put on a show. Can't wait to see them again.",UNK
7275,My biggest pet peeve is I'm trying to find property within a certain area only to find out that PRS is representing the client.  What makes it massively inconvenient is that they do not allow cats - not one potential property is available to me and I'm not giving up my friends.,UNK
7276,"Be careful about buying any large items like hotel stays. When I complained the hotel did not honor my purchase, they pulled my membership and made threats to me when I said I would report them for ripping people off. Beware! Use groupon, entertainment book or anything else. Poor customer service.",UNK
7277,"Came here for dinner and almost solely for the crab legs.  And roast beef and bbq ribs.  And desserts.  and fruits.\n\nIt was pretty empty during a mid-December, mid-week exploration so wife and I practically had clear sights to the food and friendly and attentive wait staff.",UNK
7278,Super huge it's wall to wall goodies. Call me simple but I found pink salt. Ha. How unique is that! I enjoyed the employees because they are super friendly.  I will return soon. Please check out my PICTURES. THIS target rocks.,UNK
7279,The food is very good. Try the Migo Burrito. Very good. The fish tacos were great. Price is competitive. Friendly staff and nice and cool AC. I will be back soon.,UNK
7280,"Tacos were good the soup was not tasty. i will say, the place does have an island feel even the high prices are genuine to HI",UNK
7281,"I finally had to call in another exterminator, and surprise, surprise. No bugs. Won't be calling this place again. Don't waste your money.",UNK
7282,Nachos are huge and delicious but wish they had during game specials.  Also the tv's fur watching a game are crap. You're at Westgate they should have better Moore impressive tv's to watch football. I'd recommend other sports places over here.,UNK
7283,"Enjoyed the outside, next to the street that goes from the parking lot to the garage, patio. Entree I ordered had very fatty steak.",UNK
7284,"A iced caffe mocha no whip extra shot made here is just the same as it is at the Starbucks down the street, or across town. 3 stars for the homogenized experience.",UNK
7285,"Great view, but you can get that elsewhere in town. The service was good, so I give one star for that. The entire experience as a whole was not so good. The drinks were not a good pour and the food was subpar. It didn't sit well with me afterwards either.",UNK
7286,Amazing time!  Posh was great as usual.  We will always make it back for any special occasion.  If you haven't been yet you need to make it out!  Nothing else like the improvisational cuisine in AZ!,UNK
7287,"Went here for the first time yesterday.  Nice, casual place.  Lobster bisque and Cream of Crab soup were absolutely delish!  Also had the two-item entree:  clam and shrimp.  They were alright.  Service was quick and friendly.",UNK
7288,"Worst customer service I have ever experienced. Even though this Jiffy Smog is conveniently located right next to the DMV!!! I will never return, nor will I ever suggest that anyone spend money here. The long haired dimwit has zero customer service skills. . .",UNK
7289,"HUGE PORTIONS....like for real....HUGE!  \n\nI love the downhome comfort food , with a twist, served up by HH.  This is a regular stop on all my trips to Vegas.",UNK
7290,"This is my favorite Farmer's Market in Las Vegas.  Located in Tivoli Village, vendors sell produce, ready to eat, beauty and services.  Plus, its open on the weekend when I think most people actually have time to shop :)",UNK
7291,"This place has gotten progressively worse since we came here years ago.  Nachos were huge, but tasteless.  The margaritas are a joke.  I make better ones at home!",UNK
7292,Good hotel. Nothing out of the ordinary but with a great location. Smart and newer rooms.\nNo nightlife options except for a couple of sleepy lounges. Good options for dining inside the facility. Will be back mainly because of the location.,UNK
7293,"Grade: Pure Evil\n\nThe blood or mysterious \""red crust\"" on the beer bottles was a real bad sign...",UNK
7294,AH- mazing!! Dont even think about it- GO!! He is so extremely talented and will leave you talking about it long after the show.,UNK
7295,Great food. It's my first time trying kobebeef. I compared it with regular beef. Both were great. I look forward to trying more. Tofu noodle was very tasty. I love sukiyaki without any sauces.,UNK
7296,"This was my first time in a Sammy's location.  I informed the guy who sat me and then he went over the menu with me and was very helpful.  I had the New York pizza and iced tea.  The pizza was very good, had more meat on it than I expected!  Great service and food, I will be back soon!",UNK
7297,"Pretty awful entrees, sushi wasn't bad and decent service.  The chicken they used in the pad Thai was so horrible I couldn't even eat it.  I finished half my plate and didn't get a to go box",UNK
7298,The old imperial Palace is getting a face lift. It is still under construction. Seem as though it will be a nice place once finished. Did not gamble much here. Was in just to check out the progress. If nothing else check out the house of hash and go go wonderful food.,UNK
7299,Best Nail Salon in Vegas! Affordable and great quality! I go to Le and she's so sweet and does an amazing job! My gel manicure lasts for three weeks! And I just go change it because I get bored with the color! No chipping or peeling like other places! Best price in town!,UNK
7300,It exceeded my expectations by a mile. I had the pastrami boyger with chencho fries. Best part about it is the fact that you dont feel a disgusting greasy after-effect. Service was on point as well...absolutely a return spot!,UNK
7301,"So disappointed to see that max brenner closed.  I am glad I got to try it before it closed, the chocolate fondu was so good, just didn't have enough chocolate to dip everything in :(",UNK
7302,"This place lives up to its reviews and stars on yelp! Me and the hubby checked this place out - sashimi platter: to die for ! Uni was bomb- wrapped with salmon and topped with egg, butter at tits finest! We will be back to try more high quality items at this gem!",UNK
7303,"Ehh- The pizza was very good. Not better than Cibo or Harley's though. The wait was crazy and the service suuucked! At the afore mentioned restaurants, you get a better vibe, better prices and I've always had awesome service!",UNK
7304,Lobster Tacos...hands down amazing; it comes with 2 and I had to get a second helping of it because it was that good! Try it!,UNK
7305,": short wait, fast service, parking accessible at the back of Dennys,  gets crowded, food alright but cheap, fast service crew, along las vegas blvd next to Walgreens.  Place get packed though so, the earlier you go the better.",UNK
7306,"Nice decor, excellent service. Apps were ok, but no knives to cut the dumplings. Food was average or below. Yellow curry was flat and ke mao  had zero spice...like they forgot how to make it.",UNK
7307,The staff here is very nice there is just never enough of them. This is not a single occurrence. I was third in line this morning and from the time I walked in until I walked out it was 13 minutes.,UNK
7308,Absolutely delicious. Best wings around. Great prices and very tasty food. We have been twice and will be going back for sure. Our new favorite.,UNK
7309,The sushi smelled and tasted fishy. But we went mid week at three so its posable the fish was a bit old. We are planning on trying it again to see if the sushi gets better. The place was great and the staff is nice,UNK
7310,This is the most awesome place if you are a meat loving carnivore like me!  The luscious cuts of meat just keep on coming be careful not to put yourself in a meat coma!,UNK
7311,BJ's is a great spot to grab a bite or even catch a game.  The parmesan crusted chicken is so yummy and they brew their own root beer!,UNK
7312,Literally 3 cars in the whole facility and I waited about an hour for the car to be cleaned.  Decent car wash though. Speed it up guys.,UNK
7313,Not very happy with the pizza or thier service. Its just pretty plain and lacks flavor. The staff appears more interested in making you aware of thier tip jar then actually servicing the client. Made me very uncomfortable.,UNK
7314,"Food was great and give you plenty to eat. Menu on wall didn't have a lot of selection. If there was another menu I was never offered one so not sure if there is more to offer. Food came out quick so didn't have to wait long. Would  come back here again, just hope  there is more of a variety.",UNK
7315,"Love the Pappadeuax delux platter.  Enough food to feed two easily with extra to take home...great value!  Love the environment, and the desserts are awesome!",UNK
7316,"That's a lot of money for a b urger. but the wine was ok.\n\ntime for sleep. \n\nnight\n\nand oh, it was for charity right?",UNK
7317,This place is seriously ridiculous. Poorly thought out drive thru line and parking. Always slammed. I feel bad for the employees. They need to open another one near by.,UNK
7318,"Pesto chicken salad sandwich meal.  Plenty of pesto smothered on with a lightly seasoned taste.  The chicken salad itself was well balanced and had a fun taste with the white raisins.  It works out well as a cold sandwich.  Recommended if you want a cold sandwich, but not a hot one.",UNK
7319,"I had the pastrami reuben, it was super delicious. The Nachos are definitely a must have as well!  It has a great atmosphere and the service was perfect! Can't wait to go again!",UNK
7320,Not only are the staff friendly... the donuts are great!  This is the type of small business that will succeed !!! Right beside my gym.... is the only bad thing..for my waist line that is....,UNK
7321,"It is pretty good and everything is fresh.  But don't get a panini or gyros because they use the same oil and it leave brownish thickish stuff on your sandwich.  There is this really, really, really, really, really,(+100 reallys) nice guy called alberto and he is really friendly and funny.",UNK
7322,"Very nice inventory, as others have said. The company has been, however, very slow in resizing jewelry items purchased at the store, and failed to meet promised deadlines in performing resizing.",UNK
7323,"I have had bad service at this Enterprise.  I always have to wait,  When sent over to this enterprise from dodge service center was told I had to take a dodge or Chrysler for a rental.  Even after I call Chrysler they stated that I could take any thing they had on the lot.  Very bad service..",UNK
7324,This place is far the worst place to get your nails done.  It burned my nail while he was filing it down.  Usually my fills are smooth but when you rub over the nail its bumpy as hell.  I RECOMMENED neverrr go to this place.  This place sucks,UNK
7325,This place is so good I have never had bad food or service. The owner Kevin makes sure you leave happy. The pizza and wings are the best any were.,UNK
7326,"I love the layout of The Compound. The food is good, but the service is slow. I love that there is a nice live music venue in our neighborhood. Well done John, just beef up the service.",UNK
7327,We arrived with 14 people and were greeted with smiles and treated very well even though the workload was enormous for this small Waffle House staff.  The service was excellent.  Good Job!,UNK
7328,"This Starbucks is by far the most disorganized that I've been to, especially when going through the drive thru. They regularly make my drink orders incorrectly and are always out stock of bakery and sandwiches. I regrettably keep coming back because of the convenient location.",UNK
7329,"I like the food, the attitudes of the staff, the d\u00e9cor and the prices.\nTheir crepes are light and fluffy and the fact that they serve fontina cheese is a plus for me.\nThank you very much.",UNK
7330,This cafe was suggested by the concierge of our hotel. My husband and I decided to eat breakfast here the first morning we were in Montreal. The coffee was very good as was the food. We shared an omelette and a bagel with cream cheese. The overall space was small but it was not busy when we went on a Sunday morning.,UNK
7331,Everytime I come here I'm met with a super duper extra long line...I swear on a stack of bibles they slow as honey in the winter time...no they are not very polite.,UNK
7332,"Cin a bitz. ...do yummy!\nSo is the Pepperoni pretzels!  The line was long, and I just needed something to eat!\nI can't remember the service, but what I got was good!",UNK
7333,"I haven't actually eaten my pizza yet but I'm giving this place a 1 start because it is utterly disgusting that when I pull up there are 4 employees standing directly outside the door smoking, with their apron and uniforms on. The owner of this franchise should be embarrassed.....",UNK
7334,"Yum... Kobe burger cooked perfect (can add any topping, for $) Fries hot and crispy. Pitcher of beer ice cold. \nWent on a Satuday afternoon. It was crowded but not over packed.The wait was less than 5 mins. Staff was friendly.",UNK
7335,Must try the mushroom appetizer - stuffed with Parmesan cheese and a horseradish sauce. We ordered ahi tuna salad - too much banana (props for their creativity though) & seared scallops with risotto. Quality of food was great and they had a good cocktail menu. Beer selection was ok.,UNK
7336,"This place was so busy when we walked in that we ended up waiting an hour and a half before we got helped.  Besides the waiting, though....the staff was very friendly and helped with any questions we had.  \nThey might want to staff a little better, but in all, my Verizon experience was ok.",UNK
7337,"Service is sub par. Took 35 minutes to get a cheese pizza slice. Confused orders, and was late when the food did finally deliver. You could literally do better by microwaving ramen noodles.",UNK
7338,"This place has the best grilled chicken, greek salad, and sauce. I haven't found a better greek restaurant in Phoenix. Give it a try and you'll see how good it is! I've been there 6 times and each time the food earned 5 stars. It's that good...",UNK
7339,"Steve could use some more CSR training. Decent PSL, clean bathrooms, good parking but focus definitely seemed to be on their drive thru and not the walk in customers.",UNK
7340,I called ahead for my chicken fingers and when I got there they hadn't started it at all. I asked the cashier if they had the vegan donuts and she didn't know what I was talking about. They were also out of ranch :(,UNK
7341,The room had BED BUGS!!!! and they would not pay for cleaning of my clothes or give back out money! We checked out early. I will never stay there again!,UNK
7342,Great fried rice -brown rice! A craving of mine for this cheat day dinner of mine! Yummy!! Call ahead of time --,UNK
7343,"Noisy, dirty, depressing, and certainly not worth the price after they add the \""resort\"" fee.  Though I originally went for the bingo and unbeatable promotional price, I will not return after reading the sixty-four unrecommended reviews, which I recommend you do.",UNK
7344,"Loved the in-theater dining. The coconut chicken tenders and sweet potato fries were great! Seats were very comfortable. However the bar sucked. Only two bartenders on a very busy night made service extremely slow, and their drink selection was mediocre.  Something as simple as a strawberry daiquiri was unavailable. Terrible!",UNK
7345,Great service and some of the best food I have ever had. I still remember the first pita jungle in Tempe. To this day one of my top 5 restaurants!,UNK
7346,"Worst bar ever! I came with a group, and after my girlfriend ordered two sets of drinks for the group two low lifes (the employees) approached her and told her she was ordering too much and had to leave. They lost all of our business. Honestly the rudest thing I've ever witnessed.",UNK
7347,We got the free edamame with the Yelp check-in.  They have a lot of inventive rolls.  Sushi was fresh and delicious.  I would definitely return.,UNK
7348,The Rigatoni Bolognese is amazing! It's my favorite dish is in this place. (Meant to post in 2012. Way delayed post.),UNK
7349,Had a burrito with carne asada it was good. But when I put the salsa on it it was superb! Had just the right portion to fill me up! Great,UNK
7350,Again no Sunday paper!  3 out of the last 7 weeks they have missed Sunday delivery not to mention the numerous times during the week.  I'm done with this terrible joke of a newspaper and company.,UNK
7351,Bus takes a long time in the morning at flamingo rd going east. Just out here in the early heat and no bus yet very late and it should of been left at 8:42am but nothing,UNK
7352,"Me and the wife stayed a night, the room was nice and appeared to be clean, \nhowever my wife woke up with Three BED BUG BITES on her leg!",UNK
7353,"We had dinner @ their restaurant in Scottsdale last night, and this place may be better!  We are @ the bar and the service was awesome! \n\nHayley had the chop salad (they offer chicken here too, instead of salmon) and I had the testosterone salad...really good.",UNK
7354,My favorite local sushi spot! Food is delicious and roll are unique. The service is really good and the sushi chefs treat you like a rockstar!,UNK
7355,Shop here. Don't donate here. Attendant today was unhelpful and rude. Ended up donating down the street.,UNK
7356,"I think they did a really nice job with the remodel and expansion, not long ago. It is a Walmart that doesn't feel a  like a slum.",UNK
7357,"Nothing special here. The food was par, the service was par, the atmosphere was sub par. It was clean. I wouldn't return, only because I appreciate unique and original concepts to which this is not.",UNK
7358,"Howzit!?\n\nVery average Dim Sum. \n\nDecent service.\n\nNotable dishes: Sauteed Chicken Feet, Mini Custard Tarts.",UNK
7359,"Portions are much too large, that may explain why everything on the menu seems a little overpriced.  The environment is cool, ir reminds of of a lodge inside.  I didn't think the food was as great as I expected for the price.  Average food ....",UNK
7360,A good place to take kids and mother if they aren't sacred of the animals. Prices I think are little high but the food is good.,UNK
7361,An ok place for a Mexican meal.  The food was ok.  Store bought chips.  Interesting Rico Burrito with the usual ingredients and mushrooms and pablano peppers.  There was a wait on a Wednesday night.  Ok bar.,UNK
7362,"Waxing your eyebrows here is just terrible. I'm pretty sure they only know one eyebrow shape and will wax until your eyebrows are thin, no matter what looks good on the customer.\nI've learned it's much more with it to go somewhere else for twice the price than here.",UNK
7363,"I love, love, love this sushi! I can't always dine in so it is good to know you can call in an order and pick it up, easy peesy! The food is fresh, the service is fantastic, and it is a great place to take people visiting Vegas!",UNK
7364,"Good burgers, good quality ingredients, slightly expensive in some cases I think.  Their milkshakes are the bomb though, wicked awesome.\n\nMy main problem is that I can find a burger just as good elsewhere for way cheaper.  Ergo only 3 stars.",UNK
7365,"I have eaten at most taco places in vegas, and i order the marinated pork at each one. This guy nails it!  Im so happy i found it. The bad thing, too far from my house. I am going to try everything on the menu!\nVery happy",UNK
7366,"Very nice experience. Good gelato BUT small portions for top prices. Also, a must is homemade cones, they only offer cups. I sense it's a new business and I'm hopeful that those changes will be made. Also, they need more outside seating.",UNK
7367,"The food, service, and atmosphere were impeccable! Even the water was exceptional! My husband had lobster tails that were the best I'd ever tasted. The crab fried rice is a must-try!",UNK
7368,Had the skirt steak and 50/50 tacos.  Very tasty.  The horchata (sp?) drink with nuts was delicious. I especially liked the very hot habanero based green salsa.  Plus it's only 5 min from home.  Definitely will come again.,UNK
7369,"Ate here while staying at The Cosmopolitan. I ordered the Benedict's Florentine. They used canned spinach, I don't recommend that entree. Potato pancake was pretty good. Other entrees looked better, latte was great and service was great as well.",UNK
7370,Took the girls here for dinner. Contrary to recent reviews on this site the Alaskan cod is still the same wonderful flakey fish it's always been. The price seems a little high to some but is worth it for the quality. It comes with tasty hand cut fries. Yum.,UNK
7371,"Okay, they have the cronuts. But it was so greasy that I was unable to finish it. Bummer.",UNK
7372,Got my diamond ring re-sized to my finger.\nThey did it for $40. \nI went there just half an hour before their closing time. They were able to do it for me. They actually took longer than their closing hours but they went on just fine.\nThe quality of work was good too.,UNK
7373,"CLOSED. \nDon't kill the messenger ! \n\nI did not get to try Udipi.\n\nUnfortunately, looks as if all these four star fans will be sad to learn this place has closed. \n\nEconomy ?",UNK
7374,Best place everrrrrr!!! Great tacos and very very fresh!! Since I found this place I go at least 2 times a week. Great lunch service!! Keep up the great work guys!!!,UNK
7375,"Maybe good by Vegas standards, but LA has spoiled me.  The sandwiches are adequate, but nothing WoWed me.  I'll try once more perhaps, before I render my final verdict.\n\nI'll say its good in a pinch, when you're looking for something other than a burger.",UNK
7376,"Worst breakfast place!!! Cold hash browns, not cooked eggs(how can someone messed up these?) bad service. Waited for half an hour for our food! This is our first and last in this stupid place!",UNK
7377,"The staff! The beers! The wings! Need I say more? Mortys is my go to after sports pub. You will always see a familiar face, always served a cold beer, and always greeted by the welcoming staff. The atmosphere can do no wrong.",UNK
7378,food is ok. but if your getting take out be prepared to be waiting by entrance until it's ready 10 min usually. for some reason they don't allow you to sit and wait inside if your getting take out.,UNK
7379,"Never again, I had to request them to reheat my Pad Thai, and they actually did. Asking to Reheat my food relates to GIVE ME A NEW ONE. All my food was Room Temperature or colder...",UNK
7380,It was a long wait for breakfast and club sandwich....but when the food did come out the hashbrowns looked like they had not been on the grill at all?  They fixed it slowly upon request.,UNK
7381,"For a flatlander like myself, the ride on this funicular is its own adventure. Add 3 flatlander babes and climbing up a mountain while watching Heinz Field shrink is even more exciting (or terrifying, depending on your outlook).",UNK
7382,"Tried the hand made beef noodles.  Good portions and tasty.  Not much variety on side dishes, but they were all very delicious.",UNK
7383,"Great hotel.\n\nStaff was all super friendly and/or helpful. Upgraded to an executive room. The price was very far, and the room was big and clean.\n\nAlso, continental breakfast was included with the room.",UNK
7384,Went to dinner here w my wife for her bday.  Nice decor.  Food was pretty good.  Calamari was great.  Waitress was a little slow in service.  Overall... I'd go again.,UNK
7385,"Great beef but a bit pricey for what you get. For my wife, 8 year old daughter and myself it was $29. I was definitely stuffed but for the money, I didn't even get fries, it was a bit much for fast food. I recommend trying it but I definitely won't see myself becoming a regular.",UNK
7386,Nice icecreams with a huge amount of alternatives. Nice place to grab an icecream when in the mall. Had the donought - one. Overall good place,UNK
7387,Absolute favorite sushi restaurant. Me and my boyfriend really enjoy going here. Great atmosphere and yummy sushi! Rolls are big and leaves us full and satisfied!,UNK
7388,This place is awesome!!!! Highly recommend! The chicken chili appetizer at an 8 with the garlic naan - unbelieveable! Thanks yelp for recommending this place!,UNK
7389,"Authentic Chinese spicy food. when I say spicy, I mean it. The heat here is not for the faint of heart. Everything is very good. I would recommend bringing a Chinese friend to help navigate the menu.",UNK
7390,"Unique, delicious food. Great beer selection. Quick and friendly service. Definitely coming back next time I'm in Phoenix.",UNK
7391,Had the Bonzai and Cajun rolls..both had a weird taste and the rice was mushy. It tasted and looked as if it was pounded and them rolled up. The spicy sweet sauce on the Bonzai was clear and slimy. Never coming back.,UNK
7392,"Luciano's Ristorante Italiano food is amazing, their service is top of the line, and the market is full of delicious choices! Try them for catering too, you won't be disappointed!",UNK
7393,I went to the movies and had a great time and the young lady in the snack area named Gaby was very nice and friendly and made the experience way better... I appreciate great customer service and she executed it very well,UNK
7394,This is a TOTAL waste of money. Thank god ours was comped and even then the food was horrible. If I had paid 16 bucks a person for breakfast I would have definitely requested a refund!,UNK
7395,"What can I say? It's fresh, it's delicious and it's cheap. I love the convenience of being able to order in-home delivery too. They're also very quick. I usually get the #8, Italian sub. It's pretty gigantic, (you can save half for a second lunch later).",UNK
7396,Love this place. I have been going  here for years and it is consistently great. Sit at the bar for best service.  Talk to Tyrone he is awesome.,UNK
7397,I called ahead of time to ask how late they were opened and they said 10pm. I got a cab from the strip and got there at 9:50pm and no one was there anymore. They should stick to their own hours of operation. Almost $60 on cab fair,UNK
7398,Food is fine. Was handed a scorching hot plate that burned me pretty good. So that was not fun. Have you ever been burned? It hurts. Makes your burger not taste as good.,UNK
7399,"upon entry it is immediately evident this is a 'pee anywhere' establishment, complete w/ pee pee scented pint glasses. stay away from the black & yellow.",UNK
7400,It was ok. The guacamole at your table thing takes way too long and I just sat there staring at my waiter mashing an avocado at someone else's table wishing they would just finish and come back to me because I needed to order something. Way to stuffy and I won't be back.,UNK
7401,"Fantastic burgers! Not good, but fantastic. The menu is avante-garde and a sports at to boot. Definitely try the jukebox app!\nAm going back again today to try the stuffed Pasillia!",UNK
7402,"This is the closest sushi place to my house and it is not good. Iv'e given it about three tries, each time there is a issue with service and the fish just isn't good. I drive down to my old stomping grounds near Sahara to Sushi Fever when I want decent sushi.",UNK
7403,Can't remember when we have laughed so much! This was one of the best shows I have ever seen. Came to Vegas to celebrate turning 50 this year and this show was a must. Can't recommend this show enough!!!,UNK
7404,"A total disappointment.  Food was bland and small.  expect to need at least 3 dishes per person for a minimum of $30/person for an eh meal.  The concept was a good idea, but backless chairs, very small tapas style cuisine, and mediocre food I would skip.",UNK
7405,Last weekend my brother scored some tickets for UFC 100.  Road trip!  I am never disappointed when I watch any fight here.  I always have a decent view.  Beer and water are still over priced but I didn't come for that.,UNK
7406,"A lot of people around here love this place.  Its not bad,  I just think there is better out there.  I think some additional sauce options would help.",UNK
7407,I stopped by last week for the free Tangy Jumbo Shrimp with an internet coupon.  The restaurant was located in the Meadows Mall in Las Vegas.  I got 3 shrimp with the tails on mixed with red bell peppers and green beans.  I would not pay for the Tangy Jumbo Shrimp.,UNK
7408,No a bad place. Their barbacoa is good and so are their margaritas. I love their tortilla soup.,UNK
7409,Have been here about 10 or so times and food is good.  Would give 4 stars but service tends to be very inconsistent which is a an important part of the experience.  Would say overall just seems the service staff could be a little more friendly and welcoming.  And sometimes a little more knowledgeable about the wine and beer as well as the food menu.,UNK
7410,"Sorry folks, Chuy's is no longer open at this location. It is now a restaurant called \""Bisquits\""' serving breakfast and lunch.",UNK
7411,Super casual French Bistro on a great street.  Our server was incredible.  In a city with great french bistro's it's hard to give it more stars.  3 1/2 stars if it was possible.,UNK
7412,"After four days of going to restaurants, it was nice getting a quick straightforward breakfast without having to be waited upon.  The omelet  was good, fresh made and a big portion size.  Will definitely stop back here if I'm staying at the Venetian and need a quick breakfast without all the wait.",UNK
7413,I love this place! I have been going here since I moved to Gilbert 8 years ago! They are ALWAYS friendly and CLEAN!! They have the best massage chairs!,UNK
7414,This restaurant had delicious food at reasonable prices. You can bring your own wine and enjoy their many appetizers while sitting in the terraced area. Great neighbourhood family restaurant.,UNK
7415,This place is an old school steakhouse. Absolutely delicious!! Hidden gem. This type of place is a dying breed. If I lived here it would be a regular spot. Ask for Chip!,UNK
7416,"Great place! The food, service, and atmosphere is top notch. Dining outside here is my favorite ... Especially since they are DOG friendly. When they seated us they brought out a bowl of water for our dog too! Our favorite is the omelet and Belgian waffles!",UNK
7417,Went in to get a headlight replaced was was quoted 80.00 went to pep boys and job was done for 33.79 1/3 the price. After speaking to a few of the neighbors one of them also had a similar situation with over pricing. do your homework people and shop around.....,UNK
7418,"Best food for the value I've ever had. Croissant used to make the sandwich was warm, flaky and luscious. Fast, friendly service, with a chill atmosphere. Definitely try this out!",UNK
7419,"Friendly staff, great coffee... The only drawback is even when it is slow there is always a wait for coffee. Other than that if you have a couple extra minutes stop in for a great cup of coffee of three...",UNK
7420,This is the worst place to live. Management can give you false information about your lease and it is held up by corporate. Do not move here!!!,UNK
7421,"I like this place because of it's like a tranquil haven for me. I find peace and solemnity with this hotel and it's architectural design is great, too. Superb customer service and food's quite impressing.",UNK
7422,"it's port of subs, what else can I say. If your looking for a good sandwich that is better than subway then this is a good option. The bread tastes better and the quality of the meats and cheeses are superior. The price is similar to subway maybe a few cents more but worth it.",UNK
7423,"This is based on a sandwich I had today.\n\nHad the chicken parm sandwich.  This was horrible.  The chicken was like chicken nuggets.  Only four small nuggets on a 12\"" sandwich.  Bread was good but was very disappointed.  Maybe the pizza is good but don't get the chicken parm.",UNK
7424,Delivery went off without any problems. The man who delivered was extremely professional and efficient. We were extremely pleased with the service from start to finish and will definitely be using them again for our next party. The bouncy was clean and they brought their own tarp to put under in our dirt yard. Thank you!,UNK
7425,"This place is cool, but it pales in comparison to the Foundation Room, which sits at the top of the same hotel.  The music here was okay and the atmosphere here is kinda cool, but get yourself on the list for the Foundation Room to check out the cool club at Mandalay Bay.",UNK
7426,"This place is okay its not great but its not bad. The pros about this place is that the sushi comes on a conveyor belt, but not a big selection. It is really cheap for what you get, so if you are looking for a cheap place, most definitely go here. Otherwise there are better sushi places than this .",UNK
7427,Good coffee and nice staff!  A nice place to and have a cup of coffee after have a poor dinner at the Sushi place next store!,UNK
7428,Good sushi and low prices. Food is consistent and always tastes great. And I couldn't forget the service. They never fail to take care of my myself or my family.,UNK
7429,Great place with lots of options and big portions.  Good choices for kids and not expensive. Even washrooms are clean.  You should give it a try.,UNK
7430,Just had lunch here today! What an awesome new place on east blvd. I got a Greek chicken salad pita and broccoli salad side and both were amazing! I cannot wait to go back and try something else. The patio is also a great spot to hang out. I highly recommend this place if u like chicken.,UNK
7431,"i absolutely love this place. ive been there many times and its never disappointed. \n\ni highly recommend the pink lady roll.. delicious! their hibachi is great as well, the chef is always funny and entertaining.\n\ngreat service. customer for life.",UNK
7432,"I would actually rate this more at a 3.5 and rounded up. Had the veggie burger, it was good. Not spectacular but a very good one. Cheers,",UNK
7433,It's been awhile since I last wrote a review for the mission but my love still remains. My two favorite things about the mission are their fresh guacamole and the patio atmosphere. The entire restaurant has this charming old world feel to it and the food and drinks flow with it.,UNK
7434,Un-be-freakingly good steak. Incredible! Service was a tad slow but I'm American so maybe I'm just not used to French service. I'd definitely go back next time I visit.,UNK
7435,Food was good but nothing special. Portions are small. For what you pay you are better off going somewhere else. Will never go here again.,UNK
7436,Such a love hate with this place. \nIt's always cheap place to shop. \nIt is a bit unorganized inside.,UNK
7437,"I would strongly suggest NOT going here.  The place looks amazing and is in a great location....all the while serving mediocre diner food.  Don't waste your time...or just go to the French Cafe \""Au Petit Four\"" right next door.",UNK
7438,Underwhelming uninspired food. Inattentive service. Loud and inappropriate music. Cheap experience at premium prices. I expected much better from Keller. Oh well...,UNK
7439,"i've had better burgers & other foods from food trucks (i.e. Kogi, Grill Em All) than Fukuburger.",UNK
7440,"Friendly, personable staff, good food and large portions.  I'll be going back again to see what else they have.  The California burrito is huge, but a bit on the dry side because we believe missing the guac and sour cream.",UNK
7441,I've never set foot into the Anvil or even back in its Mason Jar days but; a friend of mine in Tucson has some good memories of the (late) CellBlock down E Indian School.,UNK
7442,Great place to watch a game. Friendly staff went out of their way to get my game on even though the Steelers were on at the same time.,UNK
7443,"Its always nice with new cycle stores, but I think this store can do much better if they want to show planet X.\n\nI was relly bored walkong through the store.",UNK
7444,"Tried it out tonight. \nHonestly, It's good, but not as good as what I have imagined. Maybe an average good Mexican grill restaurant. Still I would recommend it.",UNK
7445,Are you kidding? The food was below average and overpriced and there were flies buzzing around the salsa bar.  You have got to go to Carolina's on Cactus Rd. and Cave Creek.,UNK
7446,I've stopped by Yosi every time I've been in town! Every time they acknowledged me and helped me with all my needs. More than I can say from a few shops I've been to in Vegas. The juice bar is always changing which is great for experiencing new & different flavors.,UNK
7447,1st timer there & the food was amazing. Tried the angry burger (very fulfilling) & kimchi fries! Not only that but Cesar was truly kind & provided excellent service!,UNK
7448,"Food delicious!\n\nService... friendly, but slow.  Little things like receiving that bread you are supposed to get in the beginning...when we were almost done with our meal.",UNK
7449,I had a kitchen sink leak and another leak in my yard; Bret and the crew came to my rescue again. I even got a repeat customer discount. This company is trustworthy and does great work.,UNK
7450,"The show was OK, not boner quality. The girls were nice to look at but the routines were pretty lame. Best part was the comedian dude, that alone makes the show worth watching. 3 stars for the comedian one for the tits and none for the rest. Save the 40 bucks and go to Deja Vu. :)",UNK
7451,Good was excellent. No grease and not oily made the meal enjoyable w/o a mess. Serves was good and a good feel environment I'm definitely going back for more,UNK
7452,"Everything I have tried has been good, even the broccoli.  My wife had the salmon today, we are kind of snobs when it comes to fish and this passed the test.  My friend loves the black and blue coleslaw.  \n\nI wish there were some bigger personalities on the staff but they are all nice and helpful.",UNK
7453,"Waited over 30 minutes because they kept on taking their friends that walked in after us, finally walked out. This has happened several times. We no longer go there.",UNK
7454,"The original shows like Alegria, O, mystre etc had clear distinction in their theme. With Zarkana Cirque du Soleil seems to be going after its street circus roots. I could not figure out if there was a storyline in Zarkana, but it is packed with lot of average street circus with no wow factor.",UNK
7455,Good atmosphere but poor TV placement and slow unattentive service made this first visit to Blue 32 disappointing.  Probably won't be back.,UNK
7456,Me and my family went here today and it was horrible! Burger and fries were cold. We got are son some mac and cheese....well it was cold also. This as are first and last time going to this establishment. There was nothing that was yumm about it.,UNK
7457,"Asked for salmon cream cheese got plain; asked for a blueberry muffin, got banana, and told them we were eating there and got it to go. Rediculous.",UNK
7458,"Mediocre. Chicken nachos were cold chips with a cheese sauce poured on top. Carnitas quesadilla was decent, but had little to no flavor.",UNK
7459,"Had the Romaine Salad, which was very good..skip the up charge for the chicken..$4.00 for 4 small chunks of chicken...Won't do that again. The table next to us had ask if they had a Server...",UNK
7460,The kids love the milkshakes...but the onions rings look much better then they taste. If I could have returned them for my money back I would have the tasted like burnt oil. they prices are a little high too.,UNK
7461,"Good god, I wish I could afford anything in here. Gorgeous mid-century modern furniture in pristine condition. Not full of tchotchkes, just full of the sexiest furniture in town. And a giant Santa. (Clearly I love this style).",UNK
7462,"Decent and not memorable. Way overpriced even for Vegas standards. Beef noodle bowl was ok. Funny, they give you two slices of meat and two big chunks of fat.",UNK
7463,The staff there was very friendly and theres a nice little table you can sit a t to enjoy your food. Enjoy....,UNK
7464,"Check in on facebook, twitter, or yelp and get 20% - don't forget to show your server love and tip on what your total would have been..tell them you checked in too!",UNK
7465,"Rudest hostesses...ever. Waitress was great, but the food was pretty standard diner fare. We tried one of the pot o' bread, two different benedict dishes and the kiddos split the french toast. Overall disappointing and not at all worth the wait.",UNK
7466,nevada family service is on the corner of sahara and eastern. sus amigo income tax is located about 100 yards down from the northeast corner. do not go to nevada family service. (wrong picture)  make sure you ask for carmelo montti,UNK
7467,It's decent. The food is okay and they have that free PBR chug thing. Get the lobster rolls for sure and try out the PBR challenge. It's essentially a free beer.,UNK
7468,I went here to get a birthday book for a friend and walked out with 2 huge stacks of books for less than $100!  I got mostly cookbooks and the quality was great as was the prices.  I have a book addiction and am running out of space on my bookshelves but I will be back!,UNK
7469,Lake Las Vegas is a secret little hideaway from the strip.  The wine walk was fun and relaxing.  This is definitely a must try if you see the groupon/living social deal floating around.,UNK
7470,Frys is the place to go for electronics. Sometimes they are cheaper than online pricing. But I feel like the customer service is poor. If you don't buy something expensive seems like no one wants to help you. That has happened to me a few times. If I could wait I would rather shop online.,UNK
7471,"took my dog in for a simple spay but walked out paying over $450. The young woman  was horribly insensitive, rude and was being so mean and rough to my dog. My other dogs never were this messed up with my other vet, I don't think they are nice to the animals at all.",UNK
7472,The steak served here tastes so fine that it made me feel like I am eating inside Buckingham Palace with the Queen of England as my host. The wine served here made me feel like I am drinking with King Louis XIII from France.This place made me feel like the Duke of Edinburgh for two fine hours.,UNK
7473,"Felt like it was only right to submit an update since apparently delivery has resumed to my neighborhood in Mountains Edge (or maybe it was never canceled and previous cashier was misinformed.) Food still the same and really wish they would stop overcooking their chicken and steak, hopefully they read this review and make some changes.",UNK
7474,"Passing through Madison and our family decided to let Yelp find a place to eat dinner. As usual, we were not disappointed! We especially enjoyed the Rompe Colchon and the Arepo de Pabellon, but everything was delicious and authentic!",UNK
7475,Tried to have Jimmy John's delivered tonight. Their delivery radius is so small that even being 1.34 miles away is too far for them. That must be how they have such fast delivery. They also lose customers quickly since they won't expand their delivery area. I'm sure another place will appreciate the business.,UNK
7476,"I am sorry to say, but I did like Jesse and Urias, but they decided to diss me after requesting service.  They scheduled an appointment today and failed to show up, no call. I tried to call them to reschedule, but they did not return my phone call. Its a shame, because I liked them.",UNK
7477,"I LOVE COSTCO! they always have such great things at pretty good prices. You need to make sure you know your prices before you go (it's not always a bargain). But besides that, I love it!",UNK
7478,Green & mean smoothie was good but really? $10 for 1 regular sized cup of pur\u00e9ed lettuce? Overpriced and It didn't make me feel magical. Make it $5.73 a-holes!,UNK
7479,"This place is pretty good for a chain, and it's very easy to find something for everyone here. The staff has always been friendly, and the menu is huge! The food is just okay though. Would return with friends or for convenience, but we would not go on our own.",UNK
7480,"The workers aren't nice and it smells like burnt hair inside. Everything is pretty cheap and readily available. They carry a lot of hair dye that no other place does and it's cheap, which I love. Other than their prices, though, it's not too great of a store. The employees need to learn how to say hello.",UNK
7481,I get my nails done here .. But olny thing about \nThis they don't do super cool nails like they do in LA\nno cool design or nothing .. I wish this shop would \nGet all the cool shit for nails.. Not just for old lady's,UNK
7482,"I love his show so I was very excited to try his restaurant. What a huge let down. The service was horrid, the music so loud it was hard to carry on a conversation and the food bland at best. If you are looking for boring and flavorless food that the English are known for this is the place for you.",UNK
7483,"I love Luke's! Originally, I was referred to them by my girlfriend's parents who swear by this place. I have had their Italian hot beef, their burgers, and hot dogs and I am always completely satisfied. A little greasy, but well worth the money!",UNK
7484,"First time there...food was decent but the portions were very small for the price. Also, sides like rice and beans were extra. It is very nice inside and the service was good. However, I really wasn't impressed with the overall experience. Probably will go back and give it another try though.",UNK
7485,"This is the best thin crust pizza I've had.  The balance of crust, sauce, and is cheese perfect.  The crust is nice and crispy, almost buttery.",UNK
7486,"I didn't think the food was anything special but it's a great choice for a larger group, very middle-ground. \n\nIt's a nice restuarant but not uber-fancy and the prices are reasonable. \n\nHave a shot of tequilla and relax.",UNK
7487,"I like this adidas store because unlike the Chicago store they always have my favorite shoe in stock, the ZX700, and they have flat laces that I can't find anywhere else called \""skater laces\"" not hip hop thick but not as thin as the stock laces.",UNK
7488,"No, no, no, no no!!!\n\nNo water except on jug on each nine. Saw cart girl once in four hours. Greens are terrible. Bumpy, no grass, poorly maintained. I'd never play this course again",UNK
7489,"I give it five stars for the service alone. Seriously, the best service I've received at a restaurant in a very long time. The salsa and bean dip is fantastic and our food was very good.",UNK
7490,"The banh mi here is good, not great like places in OC. The bread and vegetables are fresh. They load too much meat in the sandwiches, which maybe some people will like, but it really should be a balance to be a great sandwich.",UNK
7491,"fun place to stop for a treat if you're trecking across campus.  perfectly located just off the quad on wright st.  pretty good flavor and rather fresh.  they stopped making my favorite  piece in their collection; the earl grey truffle, so minus one star for creating a love affair with an unavailable partner.",UNK
7492,This chipotle doesn't mess around! They are so nice and I was in and out today in what seemed like seconds. SO GOOD! They are my go to Chipotle here in Chandler,UNK
7493,"Since my last review, Devil's Diner has undergone a change in ownership and a change in cook.  Preparation of the food is much, much better.  Tasty and at a good price.  The atmosphere is far friendlier as well.  :)",UNK
7494,"The pizza was decent but the appetizers and service left a lot to be desired. The server's attitude bordered on downright rude.\nNext time I'll skip the trip and get delivery! Better yet, try out a different local pizza place.",UNK
7495,Used to be a great place to visit.  Unitl you have one bartender that gets away with cussing out customers that request Diamondbacks games on the TV's. Guess being in the family means more than the customers.,UNK
7496,I just purchased a Glock 42 which the shop installed tritium sights on for free in about 10 Minutes. This is the second gun I have purchased from this shop and both experiences have been great. It is awesome to finally have a good gun store in this part of town.,UNK
7497,"Chips come w/ salsa and beans. Dont be deceived - the beans are spicier than the salsa. Mix them on your plate = delish. Good, local start Mexican joint.",UNK
7498,This place was soo much fun. The food was delicious. Bobby the singer was wonderful and made my girlfriends night. Definitely will come back,UNK
7499,"\""meh\""\n\ngave it three stars for the great ambiance and nice service, but food was a little lack luster.",UNK
7500,"Pretty disappointed.  Over crowded,  omelet was dry, and waitress not very attentive.  Most of the people I was with were not very happy with their meals.  Portions were very substantial, that is a plus.",UNK
7501,Wow no spots on street. Must park in garage. Such full. Very paradox. No parking available. Definitely not wow. Must avoid. Stay away from towne.,UNK
7502,Super yummy and non fast food! Fast service and excellent quality! Mexican fusion! Love love love!! Service is super friendly too!,UNK
7503,Decent french bistro.  The Parmesan truffle fries are delicious the Monte Cristo is excellent.  Great place to have a nice lunch outside and people watch.,UNK
7504,"Just ordered my sub and asked for my hot peppers on the side.  Was told they couldn't and the reason is \""it's against company policy\"".  What?? They done me wrong and won't go back.",UNK
7505,Excellent service and always very helpful.  They have fixed up a number of shoes for me and my purse.  I wouldn't take my high heels or boots anywhere else.  They are THE best.,UNK
7506,So-so. It didn't stand out from other sub places. I wasn't impressed. I might return if there is absolutely no where else to go.,UNK
7507,Too smoky and not very many table games open. The dealers were not very friendly and made several mistakes. On the positive the food must be good since the line to get into the buffet was always very long.,UNK
7508,"I ordered the 5 fried tacos. The filling was a little bland, at first I couldn't tell if it was shredded chicken or beef. It was OK. If I go back I'd would try a different dish. That's a big IF.",UNK
7509,"Subpar service which resulted in an ordered item that was never delivered. Breakfast food was good, with the potential to be great. The breakfast sandwich was a bit on the greasy side and breakfast potatoes served just barely warm. Would give them another shot for happy hour and what looked to be an inventive evening menu.",UNK
7510,"Very good food, reasonably priced. One of the better sushi restaurants on the west side. Inside of the restaurant has a great feel to it. My only complaint is that the restroom leaves a lot to be desired. Overall, though, very good restaurant.",UNK
7511,"Bad experience! I would rather drink from the allegheny river than their coffee! Long wait, unprofessional staff and their oatmeal is sticky like chewing gum! Yuk! I would walk a but further to go to Pamelas diner!",UNK
7512,What a great place! Everything is fresh including the bread. The soup was good and the place is clean and welcoming. Will definitely be a regular as long as I'm in town!,UNK
7513,Never had a bad visit. Food is always fresh. Only complaint is its a little pricey for a salad buffet especially when you can go to station casino and eat all the salad you want for cheaper and just as good. Wish they would price it better for what you are getting. Other wise its an awesome place to eat.,UNK
7514,"I only go for the ice cream cakes, which they always have a nice selection of in their store. Im in and out within a few minutes and the store is always clean.",UNK
7515,"We ordered spicy papaya salad, pork larb and Khan Gai Soup and it was alright.  The soup was probably the best here.",UNK
7516,"I watched staff handle a disgruntled customer flawlessly! Super impressed! Also, they have great chili cheese dogs!",UNK
7517,We called an order in for take out. I was asked to hold while the in-store customers were handled. The food was cold and sloppy. The buns were soggy from the condiments and assembled half heartedly. We were disappointed,UNK
7518,"Clean, Classy and Lucky!!\nAte at their Sushi restaurant and it was amazing! This was the 1st time I tried this place in the many years I've visited Vegas and I would definitely go back!!",UNK
7519,J'adore ce restaurant. J'y vais souvent et je suis toujours satisfait de ce que je prends. Le poulet aux arachides est d\u00e9licieux !,UNK
7520,Very overrated for the price.  Decor is good but tables are packed closed together.  I found the food to be mediocre - my friend & I had the chef's choice menu and found it quite lacking.,UNK
7521,"Beer great, Oktoberfest. Service great. Chicken wings not so good. Also I think $9.50 for the amount of wings to be expensive. Very loud on a night with a football game. Would stop by again if in the neighborhood, but not worth a drive.",UNK
7522,late night overpriced chinese food in vegas...must have it. Congee was good with the thousand year egg and pork. Service was fast and they didn't care if we bummed around there.,UNK
7523,I ordered the crab fried rice and my friend had the kim chee fried rice. They were both good but the price wasn't. I thought it was a little too high.,UNK
7524,"Dog parks are funny places, and this one is no exception. Physically it seemed well cared for and much better than some of the other small dog parks around town. I am sure I will go back.",UNK
7525,Awesome atmosphere and design.  Unfortunately the food doesn't keep up with the ambiance.  Prices were high for pre-made food.  Throw a chef in here and it could be an amazing spot.,UNK
7526,I love mexican food and I have been to a Ton of Mexican restaurants.   The service was great but the food was not what I was hoping it would be.  The food was a Big Disappointment.,UNK
7527,I love this spot. Every bartender here will make sure you have the proper beer in hand and make sure you have a great time. Craft beers;=yes Mike is awesome!,UNK
7528,"Worst customer service ever. Love seeing employees wandering around, doing nothing while many people stand in line. I also love seeing employees on their cell phones on company time. Must be nice to have a job where you can do nothing and get paid for it.  As a manager of a retail store, I was pretty disappointed in what I saw. Never going back.",UNK
7529,Super low rates get you in the door.  Hidden fees and long lines explain the low price tag.  Please shell out another 25-50 bucks for one of the other big names.,UNK
7530,"Welcome addition to that end of Vegas.  I got there pretty late, so most of the businesses were closed but it seemed like a quaint little area with shopping, eating, and a great area for the kids to play.",UNK
7531,"I love their Taro milk tea with boba! It's one of my favorite places for boba in town. I haven't tried many of their flavors since I really enjoy the Taro, but I plan on venturing out and trying something different when I go again.",UNK
7532,"Excellent!  If I lived in Phoenix, I would consider driving here for dinner.   The sauce bin the carnitas had great flavor and texture.",UNK

7534,"Checked out arcade and ice cream shop. place is high tech no doubt. movie theater is another story. both times i've attended movie has started late, there was long lines in concession stand and box office because they only had one cashier in each of them. I think ill stick to harkins even though its a 20 minute drive.",UNK
7535,"I would give it no stars if I could . The movie theater was freezing I couldn't even concentrate on the movie. The seats are too close together, they squeaked every time you would move, and they are not comfortable at all. I wouldn't recommend going to this theater.",UNK
7536,"Was looking forward to brunch at Bouchon, but was disappointed this time because all of the bread was slightly stale.  BOOO!",UNK
7537,The waitress was overwhelmed. Other servers were not. Food took forever & was luke warm. I sent the fried perch back in hopes of getting something Hot. Didn't really make a difference.,UNK
7538,"Delish BBQ most of everything you get has a \""kick\"" to it.. Great lunch specials.  Love the pickles.  I did try the mini bread pudding for dessert it was delish.",UNK
7539,"Pleasantly surprised when me and my friends found this place while visiting Phoenix from LA for the weekend. \n\nGood prices, good food, and I absolutely love the vibe there!",UNK
7540,"Fantastic nova lox bagel! Certainly carb breakfast of choice- nova lox sandwich on a toasted everything bagel. Sometimes bagel comes out a little burnt, and sometimes the staff taking the order can be a little short and flustered. The food keeps us coming back again!",UNK
7541,"Clean, spacious and a very good value for the money. Not too much more to add here. The menu was a little bit limited and the bar was not very spacious but all things considered, I would stay here again for sure.",UNK
7542,"Rustic Sage Massage Therapy in 5th Avenue area of Scottsdale, AZ\n\nIncredibly beautiful and tranquil space for yoga, massages, and other healing activities.  My mother swears it is the best massage she has ever had.  I loved it and will go back next time I am in town.",UNK
7543,OMG this is the slowest AIRPORT i have been to in the last 12 months.\n\nI have been in to 15 different Airports in the US in the last 12 months.,UNK
7544,I stopped in on my way home from work not only did they not have my Johnnie  walker scotch but the stake sandwich I ate made me sick for two days! Needless to say I'll never go back and if you know what's good for you should ad void going here at all costs!,UNK
7545,"Lousy and kind of expensive for the quality of the food.  But it's on State Street, so you can sit outside during the summer and experience some semblance of actual life.",UNK
7546,My boyfriend and I always come here this past time we went we had mentioned we were in a rush and they had our food out within minutes of placing the order. Favorite all you can eat,UNK
7547,"I love this place 4am-9am haha\nSo I tried it for dinner one night, and I was pleasantly surprised. It was delicious and really good quality. \n\n\nStill a great after hours dive feel",UNK
7548,I was in LV for my sisters wedding and decided to check this place out by myself and had a blast to say the least lol. People seem to be so much nicer when youre out of town on vacation. Will definitely be coming back.,UNK
7549,The steak and eggs is now 8.99 and it sucks it used to be 3.99 they raised the price but not the quality of the food don't eat here go to Orleans or the Cal,UNK
7550,"I've lived in many apartment complexes, and this is definitely the best.  Great location, nice apartments and friendly staff for a reasonable price - I'd recommend it to anyone.",UNK
7551,"Special today was salt and pepper shrimp.  Lightly dusted with corn starch and magic then deep fried and topped with jalapenos. all gone, tails and all =9",UNK
7552,Amazing food at a super price. Had Maise salad and stuffed grilled cheese with cous cous salad side.  Everything was super delicious. Fast service. Friendly environment. Super airbnb host recommendation. Would highly recommend to all. Just bring cash:),UNK
7553,I have been here about half a dozen times now and it's a fun place to be with a group. Spacious inside with games and a patio outside. Think you can have your dog out there too. Cold beer that you can order inside and out and a walk up food window that has killer soft pretzels!,UNK
7554,The jalapeno yellow tail sashimi is one of the best things I've ever eaten. Order the Bento box for dessert (which they finally added to the LV menu) to share and it's just about as good as it gets.,UNK
7555,"I have given this restaurant several tries and it continues to disappoint. On multiple occasions they have been out of bread. They are a bakery, how do they run out of bread??? Their soups are too salty and the ditched all of the menu items I liked when they were Paradise Bakery.",UNK
7556,Be prepared for a long wait time. I realize they opened about a week ago but you would think business would be running smoothly by now.,UNK
7557,Bought chicken skewers from the butcher section and when I got home they looked and tasted like charcoal. Seriously ?!The person that burned it should be ashamed of himself after all that money that cost. I'll post the picture so hopefully they will see it and do something about it. Never had such bad food in there,UNK
7558,"Everything was just ok, nothing spectacular.  We frequent Ruth's Chris and was expecting something similar for steak quality but no where close.  It took a long time to get drinks and food.  We will not choose this place over Ruth's Chris again.",UNK
7559,"I agree with shane k. This place is nothing special. And their dim sum is alright. My boyfriend ordered the lemon chicken lunch special and I ordered some dim sum. His order came out pretty quick, however, I had to wait about 15 minutes for some of my dim sum to arrive. He was practically done eating by that point.",UNK
7560,"Not impressed by this place at all. I love a good Philly and especially from a hole in the wall kind of place. I was so disappointed by everything.  Not sure how they are still in business. But oh well...to each is own. Try it, but don't say I didn't warn you.",UNK
7561,The food was average for a bar-restaurant type of place. Beer selection was ok. Plenty of TVs if you want to watch the game or can be distracting of you're not.,UNK
7562,The food is amazing here. The service is pretty good as well. I love eating here. I generally eat the curry dishes and catfish delight.,UNK
7563,The place is cute and convenient and it's nice to be able to sit in the nearby lounge area. However the prices are high for mediocre coffee. They serve the coffee scorching hot and it lacks fullness/body. The pastries and gelato are ok but it's so much better at the Bellagio.,UNK
7564,"We used to be regulars here. As of a few months ago, their sushi has become a joke. Extremelly small! The rolls have barely any fish in them, they don't even fill it up rice! They used to be good, but after several more tries, we are done.",UNK
7565,"I hope the sanitary conditions have been resolved because I love the Pad Thai at Wild Thaiger. By far the best around (at least that I have had)! My only complaint is that sometimes the servers are a bit slow. Other than that, I love it!",UNK
7566,"The French Dip was the best I ever had... The Prime Rib the previous night, one of the worst Iv'e had.. I'm going back again today just for the french dip!! AMAZING",UNK
7567,"Totally good experience, for non over seasoned and salty food. Great layout and good customer service. Obviously they have been making changes because the other reviews do not do proper justice. Worth the time for a quick cheap meal.",UNK
7568,"Great service, took the time to check my car battery and inform that it could be recharged, unlike O'Riellys who wanted to sell me a $120 battery",UNK
7569,"we loved our suite!!! gorgeous and clean.\nnoise level---none, but maybe its because we came in the winter season.\nwill definitely stay here again...\nbtw, out suite with separate living room was 45bucks/night----awesome deal!!!!",UNK
7570,"I don't even know where to start. But I do know that this spa is a must. The environment and decor is really beautiful and on top of that, the service was impeccable! Highly recommend this to locals and anybody who is out of town. its a little off the strip but definitely worth it!!",UNK
7571,"Be sure to call before driving there...the website claims they are open until 5pm but there wasn't a sign of life when I showed up at 4:30 :( I'm sure the cookies are delicious, but I did not get the opportunity to make a purchase.",UNK
7572,"A bit pricey but very good pizza. If you live in the Upper St.Clair/Mt Lebo/Scott/Bridgeville area and you like Fiori's in Dormont, you'll love this place, as Folino's Bros pizza taste pretty similar to theirs.",UNK
7573,"Had the breakfast the day we flew home and hoped it would fill us up , it certainly did and $13.99 including coffee is value for money .",UNK
7574,"If I could give less than one star I would. BEWARE!!! The staff is super aggressive with their supposed advice, the dentist walks around with her head held high, but doesn't actually do anything. It appears they are just after your money. Stay far, far away.",UNK
7575,"Blah! Crappy food, small wings, over priced! Rip off. Complained to corporate and never heard back. Waste of money. Only good thing was our server was nice... Except for tricking us into buying like 5 ranches that ended up costing .99 a piece.",UNK
7576,"Another crappy casino along with Paris. Doesn't pay enough to give you time to have a beer. Slots don't pay crap, even when you play minimum. Don't waste your time or money there.",UNK
7577,You won't find a better breakfast joint anywhere in Las Vegas. Period. Service Excellent. Food Incredible. Pricier than Denny's but wayyyyyy worth it. Go early...and go often,UNK
7578,They upgraded their WiFi since my last post. It's much more reliable now.  Appreciate that management takes member feedback seriously!,UNK
7579,"Always a great time. Enjoyed 1/2 price games on Wednesday. Lots of new games. Cut the rope, mario brothers and fish tank. Spent about 5 hours of fun and dining on rainy Fall break day. Good food and cocktails. Highly recommend teriyaki steak and mashed taters.",UNK
7580,Turning up at my girlfriend's with a bag full of the merchandise on sale here would result in a sore face and would be sleeping on the floor for months.\n\nMaybe if I keep trying she'll eventually see the light.,UNK
7581,"It's sad to say, but the place  smelled!  It was full of clothes and not the greatest trends of any era.  The personnel were totally awesome, and made the place personable.",UNK
7582,My boyfriend and I ate here for the first time late last night. The sushi rolls were delicious and we felt the service was pretty nice as well. I love the happy hour prices! We will be back again!,UNK
7583,this is a small buffet.\nfor lunch we had a 2 for 1 deal for $20.\nit was totally worth it in that case.\n\nthey have limited selection of food and its definitely not as good as the buffets at the nice hotels.\nthey have cotton candy.,UNK
7584,Don't go here..other than one lady_mai- they are all catty gossipy and talk in their language  to each other the entire time,UNK
7585,"Attempted to order a pizza from here.  Driver apparently delivered it to the wrong address.  Driver then went back without making  any further attempt to contact us .  Calling the store we were told that they would not deliver the pizza, but they kept our money.  Do not order from this store for delivery.  I would give them 0 stars  if I could.",UNK
7586,"We stumbled on to this place during a business trip. glad we did , clean, Reasonably priced & food was awesome.  We had the steak salad and a shrimp pho.\nWill definitely will return here . great atmosphere. Staff was very friendly  but a little slow.",UNK
7587,"Like many others, I came here after the positive reviews on yelp and it's close to where I live. Jorge did a great job. I've received so many compliments. Thank you Jorge!",UNK
7588,"Such a disappointment.   For the prices, I don't want to eat on plastic plates and drink expensive wine out of plastic glasses.    My husband got a steam burn when the dim sum waitress dashed by at top speed.  Our waiter didn't check on us once during dinner. Boo.",UNK
7589,"While the service could be dramatically improved, the food here is hands down the best!! The burgers are amazing!  The homemade onion rings are their best kept secret.  I have been here several times already!",UNK
7590,"The TSA videos are funny. The lines suck. But lucky for Laurielynn and I, being TSA employees ourselves (although from San Jose), we were able to bypass the 30 minute security line and go though the employee line. Cool beans!\n\nI just wish the slots were looser...",UNK
7591,"Perfect place for a pre or post work out. The workers are very nice and the food is real, and organic. You can notice the difference compared to most places. Good work.",UNK
7592,"Steve Ramsthel\nScottsdale, AZ.\n\n\nBest BBQ I have ever had!",UNK
7593,There's a lady named Mari who's too unfriendly for  customer service that has worked the past couple of times we have eaten here.,UNK
7594,"Tourist trap in every sense of the word. Restaurant and gift shop are overpriced and the ice cream isn't anything special. Come to the area for the beautiful views, not for the food or souvenirs.\n\nVisit Date: 11/20/09",UNK
7595,"This is a great place.  They have outstanding beers on tap and the food is super.  If you're into live regional and local music, the upstairs has shows several nights a week with a variety of styles.  Get the sweet and spicy pulled pork sliders.  They're phenomenal.",UNK
7596,"This place was really good back when David was around to take care of it. Now, its just in shambles. Red tapes and temporarily closed was bad enough but all you can eat sushi?! What happened to this fine, prospective restaurant that used to be here???",UNK
7597,Service is good. It's in a great location connected to west mount square. My only complaint is parking lot direction to the Hyatt but maybe that's because I wasn't pay much attention to where I was going.,UNK
7598,"Worst food I've had from and IHOP ever. I got half the amount of toast, the hash browns weren't even remotely the size in the picture and the eggs were over cooked. I've gotten better food at a Waffle House on a bad day.",UNK
7599,Food was Good. Service was horrible.  When we asked to speak with the manager to confirm something he proceeded to shout from where he was. Didn't even bother to come to the table. Incredibly rude.  \n\nWill not be a returning customer.,UNK
7600,Awful service. Bartender outside adds alcohol to slushy drink. Inside more expensive and doesn't add alcohol. Pours straight from machine which has virtually no alcohol. Rip off!!!!!,UNK
7601,"Ehh this place is very clean and the food LOOKS good. However, as I ate the food, the tastes seemed to get worse and worse as I tasted different foods. You can try it for yourself but ehh not really something to look forward to. Lesson from all this, looks can be deceiving.",UNK
7602,"Hey, it's Starbucks, what can I say?  Decent location - not too big, not too small.  Friendly service in my experience.  I'm surprised this location was missing from yelp!",UNK
7603,"If you cannot find something to read here....well you must have read every book on the planet!\n\nThe staff is great.  The inventory is mind-blowing, and it is locally-owned!",UNK
7604,"Best grilled lamb sanwich on the face of the earth, awesome grape leaves!! don't forget the hummus",UNK
7605,"Satisfied with food! The stuffed mushroom is a no-no. However, tandoori chicken, chicken makhani, and fish n yogurt sauce are delicious. The portions are generous and service is prompt! I recommend this place",UNK
7606,Excellent service always at this location. Enjoyed a beautiful birthday dinner tonight with an amazing server. Great atmosphere. This is always by far my FAVORITE sushi place. EVER.,UNK
7607,"First business Ive ever had to look up the owner to make sure this wasn't a complete joke.   Way overpriced, rude service, I am disappointed I wasted my time.  \nJoke's on me, you got me - never again though.",UNK
7608,"I had breakfast, and didn't eat much. Enough said. I thought this was a high end casino, but it falls short big time in this joint!",UNK
7609,"Food and beer is adequate and underwhelming.  However, it is kid friendly and the best place to watch a major sporting event thanks to numerous tv screens and spaciousness. Jessie (server 001) is courteous and efficient.",UNK
7610,"I was able to get a quiche at 1 AM so I appreciate that. My friend said the pizza was delicious. They get a fail on presentation of the quiche but again, 1 AM.",UNK
7611,Not really worth the price to be honest. It's only so expensive because of the prime location.\n\nFood was okay. Nothing is very outstanding in my opinion.,UNK
7612,Don't do it I switched from Cox cause century link was cheaper but they charged me a activation fee a Internet installation fee and phone  installation fee so my first bill came out to $250. Don't waste your time or money on century link they are a rip off on hidden fees. Very angry with them.,UNK
7613,Love this place...It is where I have breakfast when I visit Vegas....The food is not like the best food I have ever had ...but seriously they never disappoint if you need breakfast or some late night eats...,UNK
7614,"Was there for 20 minutes, people ate, drank and left and the bartender never wiped off the bar surface! The tap beer was cloudy, that makes it questionable in my opinion. So I left never t return.",UNK
7615,The sporting environment and TVs are nice and the outside seating area. That is all! Drinks are overpriced unless you like beer. I came to watch a football game and they don't have happy hour for the games. Beer only. Burgers are overpriced and average.,UNK
7616,"Great selection of food to choose from. Staff was very friendly and helpful.  Price was good, quality and quantity of food was excellent. Will go back there again. Thank you Yelp for helping me find this place.",UNK
7617,"Lots of books but the prices are not that good for used books. Good CD selection,  but again, over priced, way over priced for used, you can get some of them new for less. I did find 4 books to get, but I had to stand in a line of 3 people for about 10 min as they went looking for some DVDs.",UNK
7618,Such a beautiful hotel & the fact that they're connected to Encore makes it super easy for you to get your clubbin' on! The view of their golf course is absolutely amazing. A huge patch of green in the middle of the dessert.,UNK
7619,"Very Friendly Staff, over priced, poorly prepared italian food. Bottom line is that it is simply not worth the effort. My meal was so bad that I sent it back and left.",UNK
7620,Everyone here is so talented! My hair was hideous and in need of some major over haul...They listened to my woes and my desires and in no time I had a stinking awesome hair cut! The products they use smell so yummy and work so well!,UNK
7621,"CLOSED\n\nLast service was 8/28.\nPity - they had a limited, but well executed menu. I guess Chambana just has a hard time sustaining good restaurants.",UNK
7622,Absolutely horrible service on the sandwich side. Avoid if you're even a little worried about time. I sure hope the food is good.,UNK
7623,"I would have loved to try the pizza.  The guy saw me there waiting at the counter to take my order but made me wait a few minutes and never acknowledged me, or took my order.  Empty restaurant....not as if they were busy.",UNK
7624,It's just like any other location but I do have to add that the staff was very nice and helpful.  It's only downfall was that the only cash wrap area is located in the fragrance area which I'm very sensitive and allergic to.  :(,UNK
7625,Saw this on food network and decided to try it.  The cashier was extremely rude and condescending - and the wait for the order was really long.  The food was ok- but after experiencing such a negative and unhappy person at the register - the whole experience was already ruined. The place was also not very clean. Will never go back.,UNK
7626,Great food and ambiance. Had filet mignon and lobster. Wine - min $50 so a bit pricey.,UNK
7627,"As most fellow reviewers pointed out, if you do not have bottled service, prepare to stand the entire time.\n\nApart from that, there was a lot of room to dance, and the music was good too.\n\nCoat check is ridiculously mismanaged.",UNK
7628,Food is just perfect...tasty..excellent service chef answered all question with intelligent food answers...I will be back again...Me And My girl like this place...,UNK
7629,Food is Luke warm when served. The manager is a hood rat and her English is no better than a second grader. Place needs to be shut down. What a dump!!,UNK
7630,"Best place to get drunk quick. Any one of their specialty $9 cocktails is enough for me for the night, but they are so tasty! Add pufferfish lights, vintage hula and Hawaiian movies in the background and the most bamboo in one place, and you have the ingredients for a fantastic evening.",UNK
7631,"Good prices for happy hour, appetizers and drinks.  Service is average, food is average as well.  Good spot if just want something to eat and you are in the area.",UNK
7632,"The patty is decent, but tomato was the orange color of a candy Hallowe'en pumpkin and the iced tea is not brewed but reconstituted - blech! The fries are innocuous enough. \n\nMeh.",UNK
7633,vegas is my playground and this continues to be one of my favorite places to go to when I'm there. super fun to come to in the summer when it's crowded and the weather is nice. obviously the view is AMAZING. a major landmark in vegas!,UNK
7634,"I was happy to see a sushi place that I haven't tried, but was sad after I tried Osaka last night. My standard sushi rolls were simply flavorless and the wasabi was not spicy. The place has a cozy layout and seems to be getting decent reviews, so I plan on giving it another chance.",UNK
7635,They messed up my bacon egg cheese bagel and gave me a sausage egg and cheese bagel. They flipped the cooked egg in the plastic container on to the plastic table the place where all the other food Is prepared. That added a Some new taste.,UNK
7636,"can't speak to any of the other services, but I just got a brazillian and brow wax from Myranda and I highly recommend it. she used a combo of hard and soft wax. very well done and kept the pain minimal",UNK
7637,One of my favorite coffee shops in the area. Too bad they are now closed :(\n\n\nRIP Jolta Java you're going to be missed. :(,UNK
7638,"Food was just ok....I would rather have had Panda Express.  We ordered Kung Pao Chicken, Buddha's Delight and lemon chicken....nothing like California Chinese food",UNK
7639,"AWESOME Beer selection!!! Awesome Food... Great place! I would say that it is like a gem in the valley, especially on the West side.",UNK
7640,"This place was just eh. . .we ordered 2 meals and a dessert. One of the meals was pretty good, but the other meal wasn't so much. The dessert, creme brulee, was awful! Not the worst place I've eaten at, but I definitely won't be returning.",UNK
7641,The pizza reminds me of a cheap peter piper pizza which is bland. Didnt like the way you have to order feels like a fast food place. Plus dont make the mistake of sitting at the high top tables after ordering at the front you will be relocated immediately.,UNK
7642,Only been here once on a romantic night out with my wife.\n\nRestaurant is a little cramped making it tough to enjoy a private meal without occasionally looking over at the folks seated next table and smiling back. Waiting staff is excellent and explained the menu very well. Food was OK.,UNK
7643,Great customer service !!!! The lady that works here is such a sweetheart !!!! Muy amable Ella.... I had a adobada burrito it was  good! They serve aloot of food... Big meal !!! Good taste!!!!,UNK
7644,I came in for a cleaning and was very impressed by Dr. O and staff!!! Will me returning for my next cleaning. Professional and clean.,UNK
7645,"I really love the food here. Just have to say. The fish tacos are the best in town, and the beans are yummy. \n\nHappy hour special - beware - they are only available at the bar. But the margaritas are top notch and the food is worth it.",UNK
7646,"Food was mediocre and very over priced. Worse of all, there was no friendly diner atmosphere. Customers, staff and owners ignored my husband and I, even when we told them we were new to the area. We will never go back.\n.",UNK
7647,Great selection of beers. There poutine was delicious. Laila was awesome. She makes a pretty darn good Old Fashioned with a twist. The Apple Pie drink was good too.,UNK
7648,I like the pizza and it is not terribly expensive. The convenience of the location  is wonderful because it is in walking distance from our house.  Over all I give it 5 stars.,UNK
7649,Just had dinner there last night and the food was very good. Try the enchiladas and pizza!\nAnd the chai no cheese cheese cake was great!,UNK
7650,worst experience ever!  The limo ride is bummier than a four wheel drive.  the driver is rude and the scenery route he took us on was horrible.  they quoted  me a price and ended up charging me double amount.  do not use AWG!,UNK
7651,"Called to ask which good to exit and was told there was a driver waiting. 30 seconds later, I walked out as the driver left me standing.  Called again and was told another driver was on the way.  15 minutes later, thy arrives.  Not happy at 1:25am.",UNK
7652,LVCC is your typical big city convention center and two of us were there for Lightfair 2012.  We had several meals inside and they were tolerable.  Getting to/from the place isn't hard but I wish the monorail went into the building.,UNK
7653,This place is great! Love the menu and the food quality was amazing. Small place with lots of people but I'm heading there again for lunch!,UNK
7654,"My Wife and I were at a nice resort in Mesa, AZ last week and were looking for a a great massage.  We found a team that came into our room, set up two tables and provided one of the best massages that we both had.  With back problems, it is important to get exceptional massage. This team is the best!!",UNK
7655,"The tiramisu is great a little sweet but not too over the top. Came in during my lunch and there wasn't a line or anything. The place is cute and comfy, just take a seat and enjoy. Oh and the peach black tea is good!!",UNK
7656,Meh. I got the Mexican Chopped Salad and added grilled shrimp for $6...I received FOUR SHRIMP! The salad tasted not very fresh. The best thing about this place is the location and the outdoor seating right on the strip. That's about it.,UNK
7657,Called this company to get a new key for my vehicle. They quoted me a higher cost than going through the dealership by $50. I thought the dealership was high but this company was even higher.,UNK
7658,Have a bunch of messages with people's story's of their problems with this store. Please keep messaging me so we can bring this fraudulent company down.,UNK
7659,"Ross is my favorite clothing store EVER, the prices are crazy-low! Compared to others in the chain, this store is a bit emptier in stock than most, but it's also not busy, there's almost never a wait to check out.",UNK
7660,"Food is overpriced, which is not a big deal since we were in Vegas, but the quality was ridiculous.  Poor taste, no flavor, worst asian fusion I have ever had.  Would not recommend.  More of a place to grab a light appetizer before a club, not good for a decent meal.",UNK
7661,"Love this Casino but I have not met one friendly bartender or had any great service from them.  As a bartender for 11 years myself, I do not understand the arrogance some of them portray.  Very sad but maybe there's a job opening for me!  I wish those bartenders happiness in other parts of their lives...",UNK
7662,MEH...its a mall....I wasn't impressed by much of it...it was like any other mall out there.,UNK
7663,"Went to buy a guinea pig, and saw that there were six of them crammed into a tiny and dirty fish tank. One of them was laying on his side, and was clearly sick. Very horrified.",UNK
7664,There's not a lot of choices on Apache Trail.  It could be much worse!  The burger was burnt and stay away from the chicken tacos.  The draft beer was cold and that was the singular redeeming fact.,UNK
7665,"Inoffensive sushi. Nothing too exciting, but not bad. Hamachi roll was nice, but some of the fancy rolls feel like they are trying too hard.",UNK
7666,"Although she tries to relate to the men in the crowd, her jokes play best with the 50 and over female crowd.  For me, she was not laugh out loud funny, but her marital observations and gender differences remarks were right on target justifying the four star rating.",UNK
7667,"convient on the strip. Staff was very friendly. But most importantly, the micheladas were def on POINT. Perfect for the \""day after\"" in vegas",UNK
7668,"I ordered the gnocchi and it was very good. The reason for only 4 stars was the price.  The staff was good too, very accommodating to our needs.",UNK
7669,"Very entertaining.  Lots of audience engagement.  Get 2 free tix by going to mentalist.com and clicking on \""las vegas\"" link and signing up for his newsletter",UNK
7670,This is our go to breakfast place in Vegas. Mexican skillet is fantastic. Pancakes are on point. Also they make some great coffee. Sometimes on the weekend the service is lacking but the food more then makes up for it.,UNK
7671,"I have had things tailored and dry cleaned here. Dry cleaning is fast and cheap, but everything smells like old people when they are done. \n\nThe tailoring was cheap, but one of the stitches fell out after about a week :(\n\nI've had better, but not really cheaper.",UNK
7672,"Inconsiderate patrons, I've witnessed them harassing people who live nearby. Have seen customers walk out with drinks no employees stop them then proceed to throw them in homeowner' yard's. Very surprised this place hasn't been shut down yet.",UNK
7673,"I just had to drop a note to say just how nice it was to have fast, clear and strong Wi-Fi in my room.\nWhomever handles that for your place is doing great work.",UNK
7674,"I'm a Mclover, and I had no problem\nwith the workers. But I have a problem waiting more than 30 minutes for my cheeseburger. They weren't even busy! This was my first and last time at this location.",UNK
7675,"Car wash takes too long, and they're not even busy. We've been here an hour and our car is just sitting in the front lot with no one working on it. \n\nDon't come, unless you really have nothing going on and don't care about wasting a lot of time.",UNK
7676,"Not for the location but Sprint over all.  HATE IT, HATE IT, HATE IT!  Lots of dropped calls and just plain bad reception.  And this is in the heart of the city too.  Central Corridor.  I wish I could change!",UNK
7677,Always drop by here when I am in the area. The food tastes great and is filling. They have a combo lunch deal for $10 that tastes great and isn't all greasy.,UNK
7678,"To start off, I got food poisoning . I was up all night puking all of my food up. I mean the food might be disgusting but the service was devastating, it took hours order. That night I saw vermon in the restaurant and threw up violently that night. It was the worst and I will never dine at firefly again.",UNK
7679,The best sports book in town.  Great staff lead by Mike P. that is patient and knowledgable.  Good viewing and great bar drinks and cocktail service.,UNK
7680,I am done with Lowes and Home Depot plants and flowers after shopping here.  We worked with the manager who was very soft spoken but VERY helpful in proper plant selection.  I now have the prettiest and healthiest flowers in the neighborhood.,UNK
7681,we went there on a sunday night . wow shrimp way over priced!!! who ever heard of butterfly shrimp wrapped in bacon!!!  oh my god!!! should have said it on the menu!!!glad we had a groupon !!!save your money and try somewhere  other than this dive!!!,UNK
7682,Do not go to this location on your lunch break. I have been here twice in the last month and have waited in the drive-through line over 20 minutes each time. The food is good and hot but the wait time is horrible.,UNK
7683,"Decent Mexican place in a great location along the future streetcar line. Food was adequate, margaritas better than average. There are better places in Charlotte for Mexican, though.",UNK
7684,Wow.  I'm impressed.  The food and service we're all that.  Next time I'm in Vegas I will be back.,UNK
7685,"The Sushi is good but the service is atrocious -- 40 minutes to get a bowl of miso soup. Worse, there is no soap and not even a dispenser in their restroom. Makes me wonder what their employees are using to wash their hand and what God awful disease I am going to catch after eating there.",UNK
7686,"My wife and I recenlty visited the Anthem Golf Course as a part of the Clubcorp Signature Gold Program. We found the attentiveness and supurb attitude of Walter, Larry and Steve to be beyond what anyone could expect for visitors from out of state. \nMason Grigsby",UNK
7687,The staff here are great but the problem is the company are not sending blood work results to dr offices in a timely manner anymore.  My dr has had to chase down results many times now.  Looks like its time to find a new lab.,UNK
7688,Place ok. last time went there. they doing construction..ugh..put us on the bad loud noise...wasn't pleasant time,UNK
7689,Always happy coming here and we do a few times a month lol it's a guilt free kinda lunch/dinner and so happy we now have one in mesa! :D,UNK
7690,Really great little bar with amazing food.  Nice outdoor patio and lots of tv's for sporting event viewing.  You can also reserve the patio for private parties.,UNK
7691,"This place is nasty. What are they serving?!  I'm still sick from the \""chicken\"" I ate 2 days ago. Gross!!",UNK
7692,Worst car wash in the world they steal your valuables from inside your car and the managers deny that any of their employees did it even though you know you had your stuff inside right before the wash never going back who ever you are that stole my watch karma is a b**ch,UNK
7693,"It was quite an event. we enjoyed it a lot .for the summer time its was a show. would like for it to be more music, a little lava would be good.",UNK
7694,So shocked this place has an average 4 star rating. Real simple the food was bad and the waitress made us feel like we we're annoying her. Maybe the cook was off and she doesn't work there anymore.....,UNK
7695,i thought it was good and it's cheap mexican. just dont expect anything fancy-don't know that i would actually eat inside.,UNK
7696,I've only been here once but the waiter was awesome and the yakisoba was the bomb. The one roll I ordered was excellent too. Wish this wasn't so far from home.,UNK
7697,What a nice treat and affordable too. The ice is fluffy just like the snow back home up north. The flavors range from classic to contemporary. The owner is a great guy and has a LSU banner up despite the fact he is from ASU BUSTED.,UNK
7698,"Pho is good,but the place is not cleaned..good price,it's the best pho in Chinatown ,but it's not the best in montreal..",UNK
7699,The place is pretty clean but had to wait over  30 min just for a cup of expresso when nobody else is in front of me? Ridiculous!,UNK
7700,"Simply the best!  Service was first rate, the amenities were to die for and the rooftop pool/2nd floor grato are unparalled.  It was relaxing, rejuvenating and sublime.  I would recommend WIllow Stream every time as a first choice for spa decadence.",UNK
7701,Nothing special at all. Prices were steep for the quality. Even the salsa they give at the beginning w/ the chips was just mediocre.  I wouldn't go again.,UNK
7702,"This is the second tapas place I've tried , and it did exceed my expectations . Portions are small of course but the flavors will leave you wanting more to taste. I've come here twice and enjoyed myself immensely . The atmosphere is quaint and cozy. Wines compliment the food. Service is great.",UNK
7703,"Nice place but a little confusing finding the entrance as it is in the back. The service is very slow, it took 25 minutes just to get a beer. The nachos were sub-par, but given it was only their 2nd week open I'm sure they will work out the flaws.",UNK
7704,"Great atmosphere and food, but our lunch (two salads and a roasted chicken sandwich) took almost two hours. They didn't seem to care either, I'm just sayin.",UNK
7705,"Food was good, but I had the MOST horrible stomach aches the past couple times i've been here . Never going again !!!!!!",UNK
7706,"be careful when you want to quit-----they will keep charging your credit card for another three month. Check their BBB review. Do not sign any paper work when you decide to quit, just call your credit card company and told them to dispute any charge from lifetime fitness, this way is much easier.....",UNK
7707,"If you're going to close early and leave all your lights on, including the drive thru light,  at least pay attention when people are sitting at the sign waiting to order. Is that not common sense?",UNK
7708,We ordered the Chicken panin and Tuna. What a waste of money. Awful! Will never return.  Paradise is 1000 times better.,UNK
7709,"I like this place as a bar, but I haven't been impressed with any of the food I've tried here....\n\nWill probably skip this place if I'm hungry",UNK
7710,sandwich is ok. substandard ingredients. Lots of turnover of staff and limited in numbers. They beat Jimmy Johns but not Portillos.,UNK
7711,"Driver #511 was erratic and almost rear ended another vehicle twice while speeding and following too close going to the Phoenix, AZ airport. Not too mention doing so while talking on his cell phone.",UNK
7712,"The Hainanese chicken was ok, but I'm very biased because I had REALLY good Hainanese chicken in Canada.  Wasn't too impressed with the soy sauce chicken.  The salt and pepper chicken wings were really good! That's what pulled it to 3 stars along with the lady taking my order was super nice!",UNK
7713,We came here one night for pizza and had an unpleasant surprise.  The pizza we had was so incredibly salty that after a piece I just couldn't eat anymore.  My mouth felt saturated with salt the entire evening.\n\nThe waitress was very nice.,UNK
7714,I hated everything about my meal. We were a group of 10 and each person had a complaint. We addressed out complaints to the manager who didn't seem to care. Needless to say I would never go back. It was overpriced and the portions were like for a tasting menu.,UNK
7715,"Overrated and flat-out nasty.  \n\nMy stomach is still turning from the blandest, most boring, luke warm bacon cheeseburger I've ever had.  Anyone who gives this joint a positive review should be slapped and banned from yelp.  Absolutely gross, go somewhere else.",UNK
7716,Bobby Flay I was not impressed. Poor quality of meat on the ribeye.. Your dress coast says business casual but a hobo could walk off the street and get a table.   And they pack them in like an In and Out Burger at lunch rush . Very cramped and loud atmosphere.   :(,UNK
7717,"dee-skusting!  ate here once, the food was horrible, portions were microscopic.\n\ntry it if you don't believe.\n\ndon't tell me i didn't warn you\n\nsave your hard earned cash for another place and time",UNK
7718,"As mentioned before, the girls who work here are overwhelmed.slow service, drinks kinda crappy.food was ok and tables are run down and shoddy.",UNK
7719,These guys do not know what customer service means. I had my windshield replaced there even though they were not on my insurance company's preferred list. Well the joke's on me because now I have bubbles in my windshield and the manager won't fix it.,UNK
7720,Sure you get what you pay for.  It is probably the best value in Vegas -- if fanciness is not high on your priorities.  It feels like a family place.  Casino is fine.  Buffet is a little lame but we always go to the Peppermill anyway.,UNK
7721,"A bar that charges you $15-$45 to get in and won't allow you to take pictures, but then charges you $20 a photo? FAIL",UNK
7722,"Went there on a Friday night in March and had a blast. The band playing retro German music was the highlight. Good beer selection and kitchy waitstaff in \""lederhosen\"" (used loosely here) were fun. Go for the atmosphere, not so much for the food...",UNK
7723,"Decent spot in the mall for coffee that isn't overly dark (Starbucks downstairs), cookies that are tasty, and some soup/sandwich options that are much better than the offerings at merchants there in the food court.",UNK
7724,"Arrived to MGM at 9 pm and randomly walked by Shibuya, went in with a couple of my friends and ordered their oysters and Australian Wagyu skirt steak. Oysters are fresh and sauces on them are great. Wagyu kobe beef is also delicious. Definitely will visit again next time around.",UNK
7725,Crowded as always.  People need to have a permit to drive those carts!  Always clean store and helpful staff.  This parking lot is always a bit scary getting in and out and today there happened to be a very bad accident that closed the street near the gas pump exit.,UNK
7726,Haircut was basically just a fade and a lil trim here and there.. Took less than ten minutes for 12 dollars... And a pretty crappy job.. Wont be going there again,UNK
7727,"Two stars and well deserved. The food is straight from the freezer to the fryer to the plate. Everything here is obviously prepared or processed offsite, assembled or heated up in the kitchen and sent out. \n\nThe front house staff is efficient and friendly. The product they are asked to serve is poor.",UNK
7728,"I'm so glad that my first facial was from Patricia.  She is professional, kind, and very accommodating to her clients.  I left my first appointment feeling (and I personally feel looking) five years younger.  I am officially hooked.",UNK
7729,"The pork belly sushi was weird, I don't think it worked. Marrow; I'm also not that into it but  I'm sure if you like it, it was amazing, steak was great. Bread Pudding was great. Expected.",UNK
7730,"Buffet Is very bad .. Vada , gulab jamun is not cooked .. Rotis came so late .. Chicken briyani is not cooked . Noodles was soggy .. Papad chat was not fresh .. Dosa without chutney .. Jamun was in irregular shape n not cooked .",UNK
7731,Food is great. But service is horrible!!! I used to come here all the time but it seems like the staff just went down the drian.,UNK
7732,"Very good sandwiches. It seemed like the ladies making the sandwiches were passionate about their food, and that makes a nice change over so many of the chains. Nice location in old town Scottsdale. I ate at the sidewalk tables, and early spring weather made it great.",UNK
7733,"The absolute worst service I have ever had at any bar or restaraunt.  And, in looking at other reviews, I am not the first.  There are many options at the Waterfront, and I would suggest you try any of them; but stay far away from this place!",UNK
7734,Love the padthai! Also the shrimp rolls.. So much food and very inexpensive. The service is also fantastic. My favorite Thai spot yet!,UNK
7735,"This is a massive park with a lot of people when the weather is nice, as it was today. It's clean and well manicured. I will come back, but I'll get there earlier so I can bogart the basketball courts. :-p",UNK
7736,Salsa was old and fermented...made me sick to my stomach (seriously).\n\nLunch portions were very skimpy.  Food was nothing better than average. \n\nWas very let down by this place.  How it gets such good reviews blows my mind.,UNK
7737,Awesome experience. Price point was great. They offered a free checked bag and wine and a snack on the flight. Who could ask for anything more.,UNK
7738,"Had a great breakfast.  Bagel was good, too, and I'm not a bagel fan. Impressive bakery selection.",UNK
7739,the worst gentlemens club ive ever been to! i was charged $240 for a 15 minute dance! my bar tab was $100 for 4 drinks! they will steal your money! avoid at all costs!,UNK
7740,"Love this place! Friendly staff. Good prices. Lots of \""locals\"" constantly in here. Great desserts and cakes that are never frozen. Red Velvet Cake was incredible! And now they have DONUTS?!",UNK
7741,Main course was not good however the pot stickers were to die for. I will try again and order something different to see if it was a one tme thing,UNK
7742,"Rude staff, almost made me feel like it was a bourden to them for me being in thier store.... thumbs down all around",UNK
7743,The food and service are excellent.  The prices are very reasonable.  My only complaint is the drinks can be a little stronger. Try the Pork Canitas.,UNK
7744,"Loved it! I got the Mac n cheese burger and it was out of this world insanely awesome! Burger, bacon, cheese and Mac and cheese...how could u not love it. My hubby got fish tacos and they were awesome. You must get bloody Mary's to drink!",UNK
7745,"Yoose wants some good NY pizza?! All's you got is three choices, good pizza, better pizza,  and best pizza! Now get outta here!",UNK
7746,Yum adobo fried rice omelette! You gotta try it at least once. Haven't seen it anywhere else. Have to make this my go to whenever I'm in vegas now.,UNK
7747,Fairly priced and decent home-cooked type of food. Kind of a quirky lil hidden restaurant with interesting plating and friendly staff. They put so much food on the plate it's ridic. I didn't have to wait for service but we prob ate at a weird hour like 10 or something.,UNK
7748,"My husband and I typically go to this post office in the after work hours (5 PM -6 PM) and are always surprised by how empty this place is! Compared to the Green Valley Ranch post office (off Valle Verde), this place is amazing. The employees are decent and I've never seen more than 5 people in line.",UNK
7749,"The food is average.  They have a few items that are just fine, but the pizza is really not that good.  The service is always good and the price is fine, so if you need something quick it's not a bad choice just don't expect much.",UNK
7750,This is nothing like Pink's in Hollywood. It doesn't compare. Chili cheese fries were not good. My hotdog with bacon and tomatoes was just bacon pieces on top. It wasn't bad but it wasn't good. I wouldn't come here again. I rather wait 30 minutes in line in Hollywood any day,UNK
7751,North Mexican food (i.e. beans and rice) at a price you'd expect to pay for South Mexican food (the good stuff). The service is excellent (hence two stars and not one) but the food is not better than what you'd get at a cheap taqueria - probably worse,UNK
7752,"Stopped by just after opening on a Wednesday evening (5 pm). Spent a while talking to the very friendly 2nd generations owner Steve and enjoyed a couple of beers and the excellent pierogis.  Friendly, dive-y place with good food and inexpensive beer.  I would go again.",UNK
7753,Stew went above and beyond! There are no words to describe how grateful I am for his help through my relocation process. He made everything go more efficiently and smoothly than I ever thought possible. He is so very thorough and detail oriented. I cannot recommend him more highly!!!,UNK
7754,"Me & my girl go to this Outback quite a bit.  The ambiance isn't the greatest, but we always manage to have a decent steak dinner w/ drinks without breaking the bank.",UNK
7755,Very thorough eye exam and the doc spent time explaining the tests and results.  Dr Frank has a great chair side manner.  Good selection of eyeglasses on site is a bonus!,UNK
7756,"I have wanted to try this place forever. So this afternoon my daughter & I treated ourselves to the best lunch we have ever had. We shared, there was lots of food & we ate every bite! You could smell the mesquite on the burger and it was awesome. The entire family will go for dinner Christmas Eve!",UNK
7757,"No WiFi!! I think that's done on purpose so people don't hang out there. I'm not sure why this place got DD&D to go there, the food was okay.",UNK
7758,madison has terrible asian food. this place is good. sqash and green curry rec. food is on the salty side.,UNK
7759,We got stale bagels. originally ordered the pizza which looked 2 days old.  And also got the breakfast burrito which had a hair in it. I would not recommend at all,UNK
7760,This dennys has changed a lot in the past 2 months. It appears a new manager or corporate finally came to visit and cleaned the place up. No more mad waitresses or 50 minute waits for 1 plate of food. Way to go.,UNK
7761,Love every bite! Chicken and waffles melt in your mouth and they even keep the maple syrup warm for you! Hash brown are so tasty!!! You gotta go!,UNK
7762,Incredible food! Warm ambience and fair pricing. Definitely recommend one their gozlemes :) highly recommended!,UNK
7763,"This is truly the best place in the city for New York-style pizza.  The staff is always friendly too, and they have good salads and bread if you aren't there for the pizza.  But trust me, you WANT the pizza!",UNK
7764,Overpriced mediocre food. The epitome of all glitz no guts. Would stay away from here unless you want to be robbed.,UNK
7765,"Definitely a great place to get a burger.  I live the little bacon burger with lettuce, tomato, onion, BBQ sauce. This testament to the power of the burger gods is only $6! Love this place.  Daym Daym DAYM",UNK
7766,"Everything I've ordered from here has been pretty good. I will often stop here when I don't feel like cooking and the food comes out fast. The atmosphere isn't the greatest, but I'd you're doing take out that shouldn't be an issue.",UNK
7767,A good Baskin Robbins location. I think Baskin Robbins ice cream is a bit to sweet. This locations has really good employees and are open late which is awesome.,UNK
7768,"It's a Taco Bell, so let's be real, they can't get more than 3/5 stars. The place was hardly clean for being there late night (the floors needed to be mopped) , but the food was served quickly. So, egh.",UNK
7769,Gotta agree with Kelli H.   Bucks Pizza used to be really good.  Now it's borderline terrible.   Don't bother with it.,UNK
7770,Service is terrible.  Management sucks... I never visit such establishments and thank you for proving me right. Your food is terrible too. The guy waiter at the bar is an a**.,UNK
7771,"Great place! I love the \""outdoor\"" seating that's near the canal. Their portions are large and there are plenty of vegetarian options. The burrito is especially good and so is the guacamole. Their sangria is decent as well. You wont be disappointed if you dine here!",UNK
7772,"I'd say 3 stars is pretty accurate. The 1/4 chicken and Mac n Cheese I had were decent.  Its average food.  The cashier needs to be nicer to customers. Overall, its alright, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there.",UNK
7773,"I feel like this Albertsons location is smaller than the one on Rainbow and Warm Springs, sometimes they have less stock of something.\n The staff is always friendly. \nConvenient to stop in after shopping on Blue Diamond.",UNK
7774,"Yeah,  the cuisine  is really good  but  I sort of got disappointed  because  there is just too much  hype  about this place  so unless  you  are stepping in Montreal's  best  restaurant,  you are sort of  guaranteed  to be disappointed.  Same  happened  to me because  I was expecting  the best  there is but got simply  a good restaurant.  The staff  was great though.",UNK
7775,I liked it and it was very good. However it was too sweet for me and I was on a sugar high after eating here. \nI order the Maui Fever with green tea ice cream and I sampled the Banana Foster which I really didn't like.,UNK
7776,"Vegas' Cheesecake Factory, which itself isn't that great. \n\nPizza was pretty good and sustained the 4 of us, but only an 1/8 of the 3 pasta dishes were consumed. \n\nMeh.",UNK
7777,"What a disappointment\nService was non existent\nEveryone around us got chips and salsa but not us\nDid't getting water til we were paying our check\nFood was just ok, some was cold and the shrimp was undercooked so we won't be coming back",UNK
7778,Been coming to La Famiglia since 2004 they recently moved to this location and maybe they are now too big because the service was AWFUL and the food not nearly as good as it was when they were a small local place.  Very disappointing,UNK
7779,"This was my first time coming here. To vacuum your car, you have to use tokens. The token machine takes ones, fives, and tens. After I vacuumed my car, I went through the carwash. I paid $10 for a basic wash and an underbelly flush. The staff were pleasant and helpful.",UNK
7780,"Cet endroit me laisse froid comme la glace qu'on y sert, somme toute bien ordinaire, \u00e0 des prix extravagants.",UNK
7781,Still a classic been to the original in NY the one in the Woodlands in Texas and now Gilbert AZ. Just glad this is close by to have in the rotation.,UNK
7782,the airport has certainly grown over the last 10 years.  great ambiance with the rocking chairs in the atrium for passengers that have a long wait between flights and do not wish to wait at their gate.  continue to grow and hurry up and finish with the construction with the parking!!!,UNK
7783,"Our breakfast was excellent.  The lemon ricotta pancakes were truly inspired.  Unfortunately our waiter-- while friendly-- was too busy eating, chatting with other waiters, and generally goofing off, so our service was sub-par.",UNK
7784,"Awesome mall.  It's a big mall on the strip and offers a good variety of shops.   The part that makes the mall unique are the fashion shows that are held at every hour.  The runway just rises from the floor, pretty cool.  I will definitely come back to this mall next time we visit Vegas.",UNK
7785,I love going to the zoo in Phoenix zoo is really good make sure you don't leave without feeding the stingrays it's an awesome experience,UNK
7786,"Chuck Box is amazing, always super tasty (I recommend the bacon avocado burger!) And the employees are welcoming, always smiling. Very relaxed, fun environment. Would be nice if they were able to increase the seating area though.",UNK
7787,"I have to say this is the worst $150 we spent in our entire life. The show may be good in early 2000s, but can't make me excited in 2013. Any circus show on Asian TV programs may be better than this. Sorry I just don't get it.",UNK
7788,Are here last night. Really enjoyed my meal. I like all the different kinds of exotic meats. Taste is an understatement. A++++,UNK
7789,"Stopped by at random, chefs are friendly and the food is fresh! All you can eat! Try the Tuna Karai if you like sashimi, delicious!",UNK
7790,im a carolina bbq fan.  and sorry..but this bbq is just no that good.  its fast food bbq.  why not do real bbq sonny?  i dont want mcribs from a carolina bbq place,UNK
7791,One of our favorite places to eat! Especially after a good hike on Squaw Peak. We always get the spring mix salad and some kind of pasta. Lately it has been the Roasted Brussels Sprouts & Pancetta Pasta. And don't even get me started on the bread......,UNK
7792,"My wife and I heard great things about this places via word of mouth and this place did not disappoint. She had the berry delight and I had the crepelet. Outstanding service, atmosphere, and food. Support your local small business places and definitely check these guys out.",UNK
7793,Real Cheez Whiz on your cheesesteak... YES!!! A great end to any night of drinking.,UNK
7794,The food is great but the service is questionable.  I'm not sure if they're simply understaffed or just lack training and expertise.  We have been there 3 times and everytime it is so stinking hot in the restaurant.  If it weren't for the poor service I would give this restaurant four stars.,UNK
7795,Les nouilles sont fra\u00eeches faites sur place /// Noodles are fresh made here !,UNK
7796,"I took a pair of suit pants there to be hemmed. He had them done in a few days and I felt the price was fair. The proprietor was friendly and helpful. Parking can be a pain in the area, but that's not the businesses fault.",UNK
7797,"Very lively outside sitting area that I really enjoy , but unfortunately food monotone and completely lack in spices or herbs  despite restaurant  name . My short ribs taco was good portion with great meat amount but completely lacking in salt, paper and all other spices and herbs, not me not or  my wife was able to finish our dishes secondary to that",UNK
7798,The only thing worse than the store manager's attitude was perhaps his hygiene. Rude as all hell. I'm done with this place. I'm off to Fry's.  Update: radio shack price: 10.48. Fry's 3.22,UNK
7799,This place is not very good.  I like their sesame chicken about 30% of the time - very inconsistent!  Everything else I've tried are ok or nasty..  My coworker found a bit of a bug in the plastic wrapping they used to wrap the container.  Would not eat there..,UNK
7800,a great place for late night snacks... love the carnasda burrito... like mexican food... is soo good.. it hits the spot..!!,UNK
7801,"Food... way below sub par, service- below the subpar food...atmosphere- dark & gloomy with teeny bopper music... would never eat here again",UNK
7802,Everytime my friends and I see a midnight here there always out of hot dogs and has stale popcorn. Also we seen a baby cockroach crawling on the counter. If there gonna do a midnight they should make sure they have everything ready. I'm paying the same price as everyone else who goes t earlier show.,UNK
7803,"The selection of tile, and different flooring options are great. The prices are cheaper then what ive seen at Bigger stores. The employees greet you right away and help you find what you need. Great hours as well.",UNK
7804,"The girls are nice, they know how to make you feel special, the food is good too. I had the bbq bacon burger with sweet potato fries. Moderately pricey but I'd go again if invited.",UNK
7805,"I love the chicken sandwich there, but everytime I get it's very dry and when you go thru the drive thru they are extremely slow.",UNK
7806,"Some very cool drinks. Food was tasty too. You can watch the Bellagio fountains while you're eating, great location! Our waiter Tom was very kind and made good suggestions cocktail, thanks Tom K :) price is fair.",UNK
7807,"went there with a group of 6 on a sat night. Ordered a bunch of food, most of it was good, seafood dishes were weak, little to no seafood, \n lots of sauce and bean sprouts. Service was bad. Seems like a bunch of young kids are running the place and really dont give a damn.",UNK
7808,I would give zero stars if I could. They kicked out the wounded warriors group who had reservations for this weekend because another group paid more money than them to stay at the hotel Shame on you for treating our veterans this way. Great appreciation for our troops westin. Where are your morals and values?,UNK
7809,"This is the perfect place when you're sore, tired and need someone to rub out the pain, for the price there's not another place that feels safer, cleaner or better.\nMust go!",UNK
7810,Had a really good time here. The staff were friendly and the steak was good. Only thing stopping this from being a 5 is the slight conveyor belt feel of the large Las Vegas restaurants.,UNK
7811,"I've been using Maid.ly since they launched and have been really impressed by the whole service and staff.  It's so easy to book, they even went out of their way to set up a special schedule for my apartment.  I've used 2 different crews and they are so professional and communicative.  Highly highly recommend!",UNK
7812,I love this store.  Biggest beef jerky store in the world with my favorite beef jerky.  I would recommend this place to anyone.,UNK
7813,I love the souffl\u00e9 crepe with nutella and fresh strawberries. The cons: expensive and far :(,UNK
7814,Try calling them three times and each time is on hold for over five minutes each time I like their food but they don't know how I answer the phone so I guess I'll eat somewhere else!\nJust a big zero!!!!!!!!,UNK
7815,"Best late-night (especially when drunk) food in Madison. The hot plate-I forget the actual name because I'm usually drunk when I eat it-is THE best. The meat is delicious.  The sides of rice/beans/guacamole are nothing to write home about, but they get the job done.",UNK
7816,"Love the atmosphere, friendly staff and delicious pastries! Highly recommend! Great place to relax with a cup of coffee and your laptop.",UNK
7817,I love walmart it has everything. The cashiers never seem happy ever I would be happy I have a job. And the parking lotus always full I still love it though,UNK
7818,Plastic coffee stir? Really? How about bamboo for a greener alternative.  Shame on you. I will give you your 5 star back next time I m here & find greener utensils.,UNK
7819,Nothing great! Waitress seemed annoyed when we asked for more salsa. Food was very bland. Shrimp tacos were blah and the sauce was pretty nauseating to look at. The color looked much like something else.  Customers next to us  not thrilled with their meals either. Would not go back.,UNK
7820,Great new place would recommend Sushi Chefs awesome. Lee is a cool dude. Wish they had Sapporo light in small bottles but otherwise food awesome. Bathrooms should also need to be redone. It seems someone forgot,UNK
7821,Subway is the perfect place for a quick bite to eat when it's 110 degrees out and you don't feel like turning on the oven. Everybody who works here has a great attitude and gets those sammiches done just right. So it looks like there will be a BMT calling my name this week.,UNK
7822,"Rooms are small and have that remodeled feel, too far from everything. I expected more from this hotel having stayed at the SLS in Beverly Hills.",UNK
7823,in my humble opinion the best baba ganough I have had so far in the valley. I had the greek salad w/the chicken. the chicken flavors were very delicious the salad was  fresh and crisp.great little spot for a casual lunch or dinner,UNK
7824,"If you're craving for bagels or breakfast, you need to go here and eat every / any bagel you can think of.",UNK
7825,Beautiful and classy place! I've been a client of Steven's for a few years and followed him to this salon. He is a great stylist with a caring and friendly attitude. Highly recommend!,UNK
7826,Only came here to meet up with friends & play some games. Staff was awesome & I enjoyed HOURS of craps & blackjack. Good times. scenery wasn't bad either,UNK
7827,"With as many people who pass through Vegas, it would be nice if the airport solicited additional vendors for food.  This airport lacks better dining options and with mandatory 2 hour prior to departure airport check in's, there is a lot of time to kill while waiting for the departure of your flight.  Otherwise, it's OK.",UNK
7828,"My favorite breakfast joint in town. Their Chicken and Waffles is to die for. Everything on their menu is deliciously homemade from scratch and all the ingredients are fresh. The staff is very helpful, friendly and fast. The atmosphere is very fun and casual.  I have ordered carryout from them a couple times and all were pleasant experiences.",UNK
7829,"Very Ono! We ate Kalua Pig tacos, Huli Huli Chicken Burritos & Pulehu Beef Bowl.  Makes me feel like home. Definitely recommend!",UNK
7830,It's the Plaza Midwood pizza joint. It also has a Ms Pacman/Galaga arcade which I find myself playing most times I visit.,UNK
7831,"Props to all the performers but it really wasn't worth seeing.  Trust me, I've seen a lot of shows...",UNK
7832,"Very chill atmosphere, beer us of usual trendy quality. Service is very relaxed and quick. Food is a very unique taste from the UK. Much like a meat pie but a pasty. I recommend to all in the mood for something new and fun.",UNK
7833,"Mediocre at best. However, if you get the 2 for 1 coupon by staying at NYNY or MC then its definitely worth the price.\n\nWe paid $18 for the two of us. Considering that the buffet includes drinks, you can't beat that @ Dennys.",UNK
7834,"On a Friday night restaurant was busy, but the service was top drawer. Food was very good and we will be back. Prices reasonable.",UNK
7835,Got the fried oreo sundae expecting that it would be like something special... the waiter said it was the most popular. Nothing impressive. Cookies n cream ice cream with fudge. The oreos were disgusting btw. Glad we didn't order anything else here.,UNK
7836,I took four tops and four pairs of pants. The pants were creased well. They have installed a computer system to provide a professional ticket. Easy to read tickets. My clothes were ready the next business day by 9 am. They do accept debit cards with a $.50 fee. I will return.,UNK
7837,"Ribs are my favorite, I read the reviews and was so happy to try these. The truth is they were not eatable. I hated them and no one in my family would eat them. Do not waste your money here.  They were not cooked right and the seasoning was flat out nasty.",UNK
7838,"Walked in the other day. Looked at the dashboard size buffet of 8 maybe 10 items. One of those being fried chicken, which is probably better done across the street. Walked back out and will never return. The place is a rat hole! The building should be condemned.",UNK
7839,The guys at the gun counter turned me off of this place right away. Just ignorant dicks who don't want to give you the time of day. Asked to look at a rifle and got pure attitude from the guy behind the counter. Won't be back,UNK
7840,Note to self not to eat here again.  Service was terrible...waitress didn't let my husband finish ordering and walked off. \n\nFood was blah. Had much better J food in LA and OC. Nothing special here but the price.  Expected more from this type of rest.,UNK
7841,"They've managed to stay modern enough... but still, this is a cool place to stay, not to hang out. On that note, the only really cool casino on this sideof the strip is the Mandalay Bay... so, try and stay on the other side of the strip if you can.",UNK
7842,"By far worst service, wait staff, and management in the valley, poor attitude, from the front of the house to manager.. Food very average. Over All. Poor dining experience.  Don't waste your time.. Can you take away stars. ? No never mind they don't have any.",UNK
7843,Brought the entire family tonight to taste the goodness! Ordered multiple crazy roller coaster rolls. Love the tuna and salmon sashimi.,UNK
7844,Bad haircut first time.  Went back a day later to get it fixed and they were not very nice. Still doesn't look good.,UNK
7845,"Before I board a plane, my go-to place to pickup the latest magazines for cheap to leave on the flight for the next bored customer.",UNK
7846,"What an amazing experience!! Anna has magic in her hands, feet and elbows too. :) I recommend this to everyone who comes to Vegas or lives in Vegas. The Combo massage of Thai stretching, essential oils, and hot stones is wondrous.",UNK
7847,"we got the 4 people pack for $60 which included 2 photos.. otherwise its $15 each\n\nhad a good time on it.. it was my second time doing it (first was 7 years ago).. it runs through the NY, NY hotel as well which is pretty cool",UNK
7848,"Now that Dr. Chad Campbell no longer with this group, i can say that i tried another doctor there and just not happy at all :( really bummed!!",UNK
7849,"Teri Hastings has been doing my hair for ten years, ever since I moved to Vegas.  She's the only hairdresser who knows how to tame this mess on my head.  She's fast, efficient and talented! And a wonderful person to boot!",UNK
7850,"Thanks for good service.Dependable divas helped organize my son's room. They were fast and systematic. Will recommend to friends and family. Dependable Divas, keep up the good work.",UNK
7851,the food is very good here but the service isnt very nice. they dont greet or thank customers properly. i dont know why the owner is so mean when i come here all the time. so i have to give it three stars for the bad service they need to learn better customer service or at least some manners,UNK
7852,The crew here is the best...The hawaiian guy in the front makes you not even think about stealing. The mobile department always hooks it up when it comes to the best plans. Great staff!,UNK
7853,"Had a great experience with these guys. They came to my house, fixed my tv in about 10 minutes. The previous repair for the same thing cost me $100 more than these guys did it for, and these guys came to my house. Very convenient. Highly recommend.",UNK
7854,We went here about a month ago and had a great meal.... I had Barramundi and they modified what went with it for me.... the place was great.... and our waitress was very good!  We ordered Keoke coffee afterward and they were super....We will definitely go again!!,UNK
7855,"Organized, clean, and I know I can always find something I like there.  Every-time I consign I always sell something within a week and can count on store credit.  Very reputable.  Great spot to shop during lunch from work, and the ladies are always real helpful.",UNK
7856,"The food was awesome. We would have eaten outside, but there was a flash storm that had just come through Vegas. The staff was amazing. We felt special.",UNK
7857,Just stopped in for a drink prior to a ballgame...ritas just lots of sweet and sour mix....bartender very unfriendly to everyone around us.,UNK
7858,"Took another week to stretch them more.  After pointing to the exact pain spot twice, the shoes are now stretched in the wrong area.  I'm talking about LV and Prada loafers ruined.  As nice as the owner seems to be, he did not get the job done correctly.",UNK
7859,"I love that they are trying to use local produce, but it shouldn't take 30 min to make a smoothie. This is the slowest service in the world. Only come if you have plenty of time to kill.",UNK
7860,"Its not bad if you aren't expecting much. You will leave with a full belly, but its not the best buffet for the money. The buffet at the Excalibur is much better for the money.",UNK
7861,"Truly the BEST dining experience I have ever had!! The staff is friendly and informative, the food was incredibly memorable!! I can't wait to go back!!",UNK
7862,Nice hotel. Beautiful rooms. Staff could use an improvement. Both times we needed a cab the people in charge of the line were very rude. Housekeeping was also in need of improvement.,UNK
7863,"If you want good pizza in Champaign, Papa Del's is the place to go. Their Sicilian Pan pizza is some of the best I have ever had. They also have half price slices everyday from 3-4 p.m. Can't beat a deal like that!",UNK
7864,"I have never had a bad experience here. Staff is usually friendly and knowledgeable and never pressure you to buy. You can sample all their flavors, they are made in house and can be customized any way you like them. I only wish they had a few more variations on devices to buy.",UNK
7865,"The dirty chai is delish! I would recommend calling your order in, since they make it right there, small spot but everything looked super fresh and Everyone super nice. This will be my go to lunch juice from now on. Love it",UNK
7866,"The best pizza. Yes what you here is true, the wait is long and sometimes you will wait more then 3 hours. \n\nA good tip not to wait. Get there right when they open and you will be sat almost upon entry. Everything they have is good. \n\nIt's the best pizza!!",UNK
7867,This place has lost it's charm since the original owner sold it.\nfood is not the same anymore neither the service or the the famous tea.\nwhat a huge loss to montreal :(,UNK
7868,"Since it is an older establishment, they are starting some renovations starting in the casino, which is where I have been at. The gambling atmosphere is pretty good, they have dancing girls which is cool. A nice classic touch are the Flamingo girls who stand outside waiting for you to take a picture with them. Party on!",UNK
7869,"Went for breakfast & lunch while attending a conference.  The location was very convenient, but the service was extremely slow.  Breakfast was a little bland, but not bad for a hotel restaurant.  Had a salad for lunch; it was pretty good, but the chicken was a bit dry.",UNK
7870,"It had been a while since we have had lunch or dinner here, sooooo good! We order a feast to try everything and we have leftovers for tomorrow. The brisket was tender and delicious. The ribs are awesome with a little sweet and zesty BBQ sauce! The Mac n cheese was very good, no complaints!",UNK
7871,"Went back a few weeks ago. Not sure if the owner changed or what. The service is not the same, the menu have complete changed. It takes about 20 minutes to get 1 order out to us, and the sushi chef always give you attitudes. (Mind you that I set at the sushi bar). Will definitely not be returning.",UNK
7872,"The worst \""italian\"" restaurant in Montreal area!!! If you really love italian food don't go there!!!!!!",UNK
7873,"Looked good! I walked in at 2:45pm on a tuesday afternoon for a late lunch and was informed they could not serve me because they closed at 3pm with posted hours outside 11am-8pm. Yep, not going there again. Who knows when they are going to be open.",UNK
7874,"very special... \nthe food, the people, the place\nfresh fish is very important for sushi and this place have it...\nan incredible and extensive menu is supported by the amazing chef's\nthey also have very good selection of Japanese sake and beer.",UNK
7875,"Loveeee it here, adorable little restaurant hidden in the middle of a strip mall. I would have never tried it from the look of the outside if it weren't for a recommendation from a friend... it's a hidden gem for sure. Everything I've tried is wonderful here! The decor is classy and upscale",UNK
7876,"OMG, we stayed at Harrah's and happened to past by the cafe after clubbing and saw this huge steak and eggs deal for $5.99. When the food came, the steak was so chewy and wasn't cooked right. The hashbrown was cold, the only thing that was decent are the eggs.",UNK
7877,"for a chefs restaurant it was incredibly disappointing. Horrible service-it took the food 45 minutes in an empty restaurant, and when we finally received our food it was mediocre at best. I won't make the mistake of thinking that a Gordon Ramsay restaurant will be good based on the name again.",UNK
7878,"food was quite good. The menu variety is good. The wait staff is extremely helpful and when we said that were cold, they obliged us by closing the doors.\nCould use more tv's there",UNK
7879,"The atmosphere was pretty cool and it was nice to have a conversation without having to shout. The food is good but it really didnt blow my mind.  Needless to say, it wasn't bad for my first restaurant experience in Vegas.",UNK
7880,"A solid place for a casual bite with a twinge of hipness. Several cuts of steak, bunch of different toppings for burgers, fries, baked potatoes and a few beers and wines. No complaints here! But its nothing to go on about.",UNK
7881,"The food isn't amazing, but it's not bad either. It's just your average breakfast joint. I live really close to this place, so it is a great place to just ride your bike to. We have never had an issue with the service, they are usually on top of everything.",UNK
7882,"Great deals , awesome workout area great staff they are so friendly. Fast results this is the place to be with the music and the lights its like a club!!! Got my membership for a year!!!!",UNK
7883,"I called and left a message at their Summerlin location, as well as emailed their website, per the instructions by the receptionist at the time of my service. I've received no response. That kills it for me.",UNK
7884,"This place was great and cheap.  However, they are under new ownership, and the quality of the food is now awful.  What a shame.  Best of luck to the former proprietor and her family, as they did a great job.",UNK
7885,"Second time stayed here. I really like it. Love sitting right outside the pool and enjoying the sun. Also they have Jean Phileppe in the hotel, which I love! Plus, the internet is complimentary not like other hotels. :)",UNK
7886,First time here. Food is fresh. Place is clean. Great customer service. Got the number 1 and my gf got the number 7. We love it. We'll be back for sure.,UNK
7887,"Marrow and crispy Brussels are a meal in themselves, and we almost canceled the burgers.  Wow, that wouldve been a mistake!  I luckily found my 2nd stomach... mussels were also good.   gin Richard, and  crimson tide were both really nice cocktails!",UNK
7888,"Food is great, drinks are great, recommend grapefruit mimosa. Very small restaurant, close seating. Nice way to say it would be cozy. Servers are very  accommodating.",UNK
7889,"Gross.  If you like your food sitting in pool of grease then you'll love this place.  It just was not good.  Potatoes were cold, the meats were just okay, but once I saw the puddle of grease, that was it for me.  \n\nNever again.",UNK
7890,The owner(s)  seemed to have closed the Freeport Road location with little regard to customers.  This seems exceptionally rude and my patronage seems to have been taken for granted Could this EastSide location be next? Beware.,UNK
7891,"The atmosphere is amazing, the owners are the friendliest you'll ever meet, and the regular workers are very helpful and eager to please, they are very knowledgable about the hookah and can make a great bowl. It's great for single parties or groups.",UNK
7892,"The \""F.G.\"" has apparently closed down... For good. I can't help but feel a little bit bad. I really did want to see it make the \""full transformation.\"" But maybe it just wasn't meant to be. Ah well.",UNK
7893,The beef terriyaki was terrible. It tasted like the meat had been frozen for months. The price was expensive too. We also ordered a couple of rolls. They tasted ok but way over priced for the portion size. I do not recommend this restaurant.,UNK
7894,Good but they need to add a little more seasoning. Very bland.  The best place we had the 4 nights we where there.,UNK
7895,"1. Feta cheese on tacos is interesting once but don't care to do it again.\n2. \""Salsa\"" is Vinegery.?\n3. Chicken and beef pretty bland.",UNK
7896,Ordered but then she kept telling me all their different specials. Finally said ok to 3 roast beefs. Just got home. Order totally wrong. Not going back.,UNK
7897,Great coffee shop and tea house on Roosevelt Row!  I thoroughly enjoyed my Italian soda and hanging at this cool place.  Another great local spot to relax and enjoy the cool side of Phoenix.,UNK
7898,"This place is empty tonight. Spring is the only server. Tiffany is here too but she looks terrible. I ordered the 3 eggs, 3 pancakes with 4 sausage links. Hopefully it will be good. And... It was just fine. Not the best by any means but good food.",UNK
7899,"Really enjoyed it. I got the basic breakfast which was so big I did not eat again until 9:30 that night, and we also got the eggs benidict AMAZING!!!!!",UNK
7900,"Would not recommend, free weight room is inadequate for the amount of members. Only 2 squat racks and very low ceilings make it seem even more packed than it is. Serviceable gym during non-peak hours but I would suggest finding another place to work out if you are really in to weight lifting.",UNK
7901,"Great atmosphere, food is delicious, and the hookahs are prepared to perfection. be sure to ask for Bryaun if you want excellent customer service!",UNK
7902,"Good Thai food, they will make it proper \""Thai hot\"" if you ask them, not that watered down crud. You might have to convince them you mean it though.",UNK
7903,Burger is ok. With all the hype expected more. Fries highlight of the meal tho real good. Still feel that the west valley has a better burger. Sorry east valley. But I would go back again just know now what to expect.,UNK
7904,"Loved it!  Half expected a lame PF Chang wannabe so was very surprised at how excellent and fun it was!  Specials were terrific and cheap, and the bartender Paul made us some of the better drinks I've had in town.",UNK
7905,"Place is great! Family owned, friendly service, clean and awesome Gyros at a really fair price. \n \nWhat more could you ask for?",UNK
7906,The nearest Chinese restaurant near Heinz. Price is reasonable. \nFavor is good. I like fried rice and Chow Fan. \nCan use credit card!,UNK
7907,"Lots of seating area, open windows and coffee related gifts. I ordered the chai and wanted it without sugar but they gave me a sugar free version with sugar substitute.",UNK
7908,Well I love the triple play and the Chicken fingers here. But I know the quality and service is low but it is good for chain restaurants.,UNK
7909,"Only has 1 person working and serving the restaurant. Took 15 minutes to be asked if I wanted a drink, another 15 minutes to get a menu after asking for one. Annoying wait, they need to hire more people",UNK
7910,We were very excited to try his Vegas place.. Boy what a big let down!\n\nDid not get anything that was impressive what so ever! Not going there again! Over!,UNK
7911,The barbeque that they serve must not be what they have won competitions with. Its just ok bbq with ok sides. Not impressed.,UNK
7912,"They have some unique stuff in here, just over priced.\nBut buyer be ware some stuff is questionable.\nI saw some lamps in here for $89 a piece and Marshall's had the same lamps a few months back for $29 a piece.",UNK
7913,"Some of the best pizza I have ever had, and they have great lunch specials. They have everything from the basic pepperoni to baked potato pizza (my favorite). The two times I have dined it for lunch I wasn't impressed with the service.",UNK
7914,"More selection than Trader Joes but also be prepared to pay a little more. Good selection of beer, wine and sake. Place to be if you're the type of person whose into healthy and organic food. Plenty of selection. They also offer happy hour!",UNK
7915,"Really scrumptious crispy wings, but the pizza is definitely FROZEN pizza. only one size offered and no crust to it. Will come back for wings but nothing else. Nice staff.",UNK
7916,"I've only been here once, and it was good. I had the noodles that was basically Pad Thai with added chicken. Yum!",UNK
7917,Don't even bother-apparently they do not provide parking for their clientele. After parking in what I thought was all one parking lot my car was towed and damaged. I had to wait 3 hours and spend $275 cash to get it back-what a racket!!! NO STARS!!! First and last time I go here,UNK
7918,Favorite breakfast place in Montreal. Bacon was out of this world along with the hot chocolate. Service was genuine and prompt. A very special place to take the family.,UNK
7919,Was in there picking up my items as the older guy sat there talking trash about their customers. Also overheard in his conversation was a threat to take them outside and beat them up for complaining - as I looked at my messed up stitching... Will never go there again.,UNK
7920,"Really good food, service was okay. A little on the pricey side, and as good as the good is, I'm not sure it's worth the food to price ratio. Worth experiencing a few times, a good change from the norm aswell but that's about it.",UNK
7921,"I cannot say that reading is just what others called \""pass time\"", because reading is the best moment of spending my time every day. And I want to thank changing hands bookstore that supports what I love to do. Every time I need something to read to complete my day I can always find it here.",UNK
7922,"I bought six cakes from Cake World for six different occasions.  When I went in to order another cake, the cashier quoted me for $45.  The baker recognized me and quoted me the gringo price of $65.  I love their cakes but after that...NEVER AGAIN!!!",UNK
7923,Nicest staff ever! We drive past two other Smashburger locations to go here because of the friendly peeps who work here and will go to great lengths to keep you happy!,UNK
7924,We've been coming here for years.  The food is ALWAYS great and I agree that the service is great without hovering.  Their lunch menu is the best value as well as the best chinese food in town,UNK
7925,this place is great unless you come late at night.  the old guy that works there is super slow and unbelievably rude.,UNK
7926,"My expensive silk shirt was ripped by them, and I was told it was because the shirt was old, which it was, although it hadn't ripped from other cleaners.  I was offered no compensation.  Who does business like that?  I found a better cleaners, that costs about half (Lakes Cleaners).",UNK
7927,"Lemme just add to the wonderfulness that is Lo-Lo's. Although I have only been to the Scottsdale one, I must say it was wonderful. Chicken yum! Waffles yum! Candied yams yum! Mac & Cheese yum!",UNK
7928,"Another old restaurant that you are paying for the view. Ok, but unimaginative food. Overall a skip based on price and style.",UNK
7929,"Michelle is the best therapist I have been to in Charlotte. \nNo frills at Elements, in and out massage and in return they offer reasonable pricing. \n\nThe staff is always very friendly and the location is easy.\n\nMichelle is amazing if you enjoy deep tissue massages.",UNK
7930,We have two sets of middle eastern friends who introduced this place to us on different occasions.  We absolutely love this place. Their kabobs are yummy and not dry. We got the chicken and steak kabob.. Awesome place and great service.,UNK
7931,"We meant to order the poutine, but had burgers and fries instead.  Excellent.  The crowd is mostly 20 somethings, but the staff is friendly and all are welcome.  Bustling and efficient service.  Fun, inexpensive dining out.",UNK
7932,I went here on a number of occasions and was always super impressed with the speed and quality of care I recieved.\n\nFree cold-packs and condoms. What more could you ask for?!?,UNK
7933,"Severn was very easy to work with and we were able to get into all of the clubs and pool parties with little effort. Our group has contacted Severn many times to set up events, and he has been very consistent with the pricing and the ease of coordination. Severn has definitely made our Vegas trips hassle free, fun, and memorable!",UNK
7934,It was like hanging out in a super awkward tree house ....Server messed up our order several times....I will not miss this place.,UNK
7935,"We came to Phoenix for 5 days and came to Scramble 2 times. I didn't love my food, but that was because I ordered wrong. My kids got the chicken panini, that came with applewood smoked bacon, creamy boursin cheese,",UNK
7936,"Nice prices on the rooms.  TI isn't so huge that I get lost, so that's good.  I'd definitely go here again.",UNK
7937,This is the worst wal Mart I've ever been too. It's .5 miles from my house but I will go to another one just to avoid this trashy hole.,UNK
7938,"Good little burrito stand in the Phoenix airport.  Service wasn't great, but never is in airports.  Ordered blue tacos with chicken, very tasty.  If you're nearby, I recommend.",UNK
7939,We went here to grab a burger and a beer.... Service was non existent and when the bartender did greet us she acted as if she was doing us a favor.    We went about 9:30pm this passed friday.,UNK
7940,"Simple but delicious, quick Chinese. Hai Nam chicken with rice! Most likely will come back to try the great and inexpensive menu and not bad service.",UNK
7941,"Came here on a weekday morning. No wait at all, seated right away. Efficient waitress/ Buffet has a wide assortment of items, and tastes really fresh. Coffee is pretty good too, surprisingly. However, maybe it's because I came for the morning buffet, but the Wynn does it better...",UNK
7942,Steve the Pitt boss is a twat. Let you loose then bad mouth you for being there. Wouldn't drop my allowance for those to live. Beware,UNK
7943,"Service was great and the food was tasty.  We started of with snails and pigs ears and then ordered 2 different bacalhau dishes for the main course.  The portions were big.  My only criticism is that they were not prepared the way those dishes are typically prepared in Portugal.  But if you don't know better, go ahead.",UNK
7944,"Such yummy poutine. It's such big portion-- I wish I could have shared it with someone. I think I ate half of it and was done. The drawback was that they charged extra for me to box up the food, but I guess you have to make sacrifices for future promises of yumminess I guess.",UNK
7945,The food and service really was fantastic!!  Just that if I am going to pay this much for food I should be full afterwards. I am a pretty big fan of Fox Restaurants so I am not a hater but overtime I eat at North I leave feeling I didn't get the best value.,UNK
7946,Eh. Long lines for nothing special. Waited inline because I was thirsty. A lot of people had trouble accepting the fact that breakfast time was over...,UNK
7947,Yummy food and good service. Super yummy breakfast burritos!!\nTypical hole in the wall Mexican place. The food is so yummy; don't judge a book by its cover!,UNK
7948,"I liked this place. Got the pumpkin curry with shrimp. Not sure the shrimp are worth the price but I thought the food was good and the service was good. Not sure if I'll return, but would recommend it...worth a try!",UNK
7949,Very noisy and decor is too busy but their fajita isn't bad. I only went on Wednesday special but now I moved from downtown so fajita no more :(,UNK
7950,Great bartenders.   Tight machines.  Players benefits going downhill.  Must leave all VIP dinner food at restaurant.  No take home on leftovers.  VIP dinners aren't so VIP.  Non VIP customers treated better.  Shrimp dinners are a joke.,UNK
7951,This place is AMAZING!!! Everything they make is delish. \nWe just finished a king cake and it was like we were back in Louisiana!,UNK
7952,"I'm surprised at some of the other reviews. I ordered scrambled eggs that were cooked perfect, cornbeef hash and potatoes. My daughter had pancakes and an English muffin. The service was decent but I could see it lacking if it were to get busy. I will return for another meal.",UNK
7953,Yet another tasteless owner has arrived on scene. They have put in a CHEESY VENDING MACHINE in the nice reception area. It \nlooks like a giant pimple on a pretty face.,UNK
7954,Delicious ice cream made on the premises by friendly local owners. Mt Lebanon Uptown has needed a place like this for years. Thank you Betsy and Ryan for fulling this yawning chasm of need.,UNK
7955,I have stayed here three times. They have great suites and an awesome view of the strip. It's also conveniently located in the middle of everything!,UNK
7956,"Finally!  Fruits, juices and smoothies have arrived to the Southwest gates of Vegas airport...  Located just inside security at Gate C25, it's the first vendor you see - can't miss it.  Put your shoes back on and refresh yourself from the heat and the hassle.",UNK
7957,I really love this place and I hope it stays in business. \n\nThe staff is very friendly and I really love the wide variety of vegetarian options.,UNK
7958,"They were just featured today on channel 5's dirty dining. Six major violations. What a bummer, I really like this place, but 6 major violations?",UNK
7959,I really like their food. I recommend the calzones and the pizza bagels. Pretty good price for one person and its very filling. \nI would have given this four stars but the service is kind of iffy. Sometimes the service is really good and sometimes it's eh.,UNK
7960,The service was not great. For a very high end restaurant they should staff people who actually know how to serve. My server was the host just because I decide to sit in front of the restaurant. Also I was advised the menu is different inside and outside. What is up with that?,UNK
7961,0 stars! Show turned off 5 min in! Worst Vegas show experience ever! So disappointed. May never book another Vegas show again. Thanks for nothing Mandalay Bay,UNK
7962,I have had way better chinese food. Not fresh and bad stomach aches later at night. Sick- not overeating. Good walnut shrimp.,UNK
7963,gave this place three stars for what it is ... a hotel in the burbs - hotel was a good value and there was an acceptable indian joint across the parking lot.,UNK
7964,"Great bar-style food. Nice waitstaff. Could have a better atmosphere. Overall, a very satisfying experience that I would recommend. I know I'll be back.",UNK
7965,"If you want a place to drink good cheap beer, and watch hot muscle men and jocks dance buck naked with big boner cocks then this is the place for you. \nFreekin. Hot. Mens.",UNK
7966,I tried this place because of all the wonderful reviews.  I have to say I was extremely disappointed. I ordered the mama signature pizza and a dinner salad. The salad is something I would expect from a lousy fast food place.  The pizza was flavorless and the crust was just a soggy mush.  I will not be eating her again.,UNK
7967,"First time eating at Hungry Howies and will certainly go back. Service was friendly, pizza fresh and hot and we enjoyed trying the flavored crusts - Ranch and Asiago.",UNK
7968,yep yep it is a big azz airport!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,UNK
7969,"I ate here while in town for work. The atmosphere was chill and was a great place for me to sit and have a glass of wine alone at the bar. Good wine selection, and the wings I had were fantastic. If I was in the area again I'd go again.",UNK
7970,"For a food court, this place stands out, and practically towers over most. The food is pretty good, (great if you consider the price for steaks, fish, and other hearty meat dishes), and the service is not shabby. The selection is varied, with daily specials. Great lunch and (perhaps) quick dinner place.",UNK
7971,"The food was good but the service is very slow. I decided to go again the following week to give them a second try but I got the same result, very slow service.",UNK
7972,"Great local place I go at least two or three times a week. \nThey have great wings and great side dish's My all time favorite is the combo terriaki bowl. \nIf you like the one at jack in the box, you will love this one alot more",UNK
7973,"The baked treats are pretty good, and the place itself is small and cozy. It's a nice place to eat some pastries, drink some tea, and chat with a friend. Nothing special, but I'm glad I'd been here at least once!",UNK
7974,Hit and miss sometimes the food is great and other times it is the dried out butts of brisket or the chicken is dry and hard.  Once the bun was so dried out it would just crumble to powder.  Servers are nice.,UNK
7975,"They changed this store recently so it looks like patti's closet now. A lot of their stuff is cute but it didn't quite fit. However...I was able to score an awesome birthday dress for $50, super sexy shoes for $30, and a cute purse for $40.",UNK
7976,This place Snowflake... was real cool :) What a treat :) something different that was really good. The Family that eats together well eats together Loved it.. :D,UNK
7977,"I really enjoy Sunrise. This is a good place to get an omelet after a workout at its neighbor LVAC. Great place to come if you have a dog. The food is simple, fresh, tasty and priced just right. Try the jalapeno bacon.",UNK
7978,Wayyyyyyyy better this time! I made some sort of chocolate coconut concoction that was amazing. I highly recommend trying this spot,UNK
7979,"They have a great buffet.  My Aunt used to live in Vegas and this is one of the \""locals\"" casinos they always went to.    The place was always clean.   My mom and I did stay there once and the room was nice as well.",UNK
7980,I love this store u find all types of decor in here. It's organize and the staff is sweet . Plus I can always find my moroccan stuff here which Is really nice,UNK
7981,Easily some of the worst service I've ever had. Over priced and overrated at even one star. Rude servers. Slow service. Food average at best. Beers ok if you can get any. Stay away. Lots of better options out there.,UNK
7982,Egg roll-not very good. No brown rice and the sesame chicken was too sweet with one broccoli stalk!!  So go down the street to one of the other places. It was cheap so I did get what I paid for!,UNK
7983,If you like a fancy delicious brunch def try this place.  Loved the peach Bellini and the banana pancakes (among the best ever!).  Great service and atmosphere.,UNK
7984,Pink Poodle is excellent. I have two Poodles and always bring them here since I moved to Vegas in 2007. BETH  is the best she will take care of your dog. Fully recommend.,UNK
7985,Absolute ripoff.  I took 3 shirts in and they charged me 19.47.  I'll never go back.  That's what I get for not checking yelp first.,UNK
7986,"Burgers were very disappointing, I was expecting a gourmet burger and got something I would expect from a fast food joint.  Our service was good and also enjoyed their pickles... But got charged when we asked for an extra one",UNK
7987,"This is by far a true church with true followers of Christ. They are so warm welcoming and accommodating to you and your while family. The word is truly from God, as is the ministry and church members!",UNK
7988,"Tried out the new La Unica as a taco tuesday replacement since it is in the former Loco Lime location. Bland, tasteless, is the only way I can describe it. Maybe you can get more from something other than $1 tacos, but it seems a step down from the restaurant it replaces.",UNK
7989,Can you say Chicago Hot Dog?  With the real banana peppers and a long pickle.  They are really good and worth the cook time.,UNK
7990,JD did my rook piercing and he was super nice throughout. This wasn't my first piercing but it has been a few years. He was helpful and made me feel relaxed and comfortable. If I get anything else done in the future I'd definitely go there again!,UNK
7991,"The wave roll was pretty good. The other two rolls weren't. The service was terrible, and I got food poisoning. We won't go back.",UNK
7992,Binging on tacos before you go to the club is the best thing ever!  If you are a fatty lover they will want to kiss that taco flavor from your mouth.  Score!,UNK
7993,Worst McDonald's ever. Full of drunk people off the strip. Bums hang around inside and outside the restaurant. Hookers and pimps hang out there. The employees are loud and ghetto and very unprofessional. Go to the nicer McDonald's by Planet Hollywood instead.,UNK
7994,"The staff is extremely professional and extremely friendly and helpful. I had my flowers re-delivered multiple times because the recipient was not present and they were great with their communication and customer service. Most importantly, the flowers turned out fantastic and everyone loved them.\n\nI highly recommend Tiger Lily!",UNK
7995,"Megan is a superb photographer. She does excellent work and is who I go to for all of my family pictures. Her photographs are beautiful, artistic and magazine quality. I highly recommend her for everything from weddings to newborn photos and more!",UNK
7996,"I worked here about three hundred years ago, and I thought it was the greatest bar ever at the time. However, it is not. However, it is still better than just about every other bar on campus, circa 2002. The burgers are phenemonal, as is the BBQ chicken.",UNK
7997,The tortillas are like air. The filling is allowed to shine whilst encased in a delicious light tortillas. Cheap eats. My first stop from the airport every time. Machaca and eggs.,UNK
7998,"I don't get Heather D.  An omelette, hash browns and an English muffin?  Anyone can make that at home.  El Chorro is an overpriced mediocre place.  You can't eat views.",UNK
7999,This was something really amazing to see.  It's basically like a museum in that you can't touch or use flash photography but what you're looking at is fascinating.  The specimens are well preserved and the little info panels around the exhibit are very informative.  Get the audio tour option for more detailed descriptions.,UNK
8000,Epic food either fancy or simple.  Consistent year around which is tough in a seasonal resort town. \n\nWe have never had a bad meal.  Great staff.,UNK
8001,"Servers are so rude , especially the girl she used to work at Chang restaurant \nI never come back. Horrible service !\nSo many Chinese restaurant in Vegas why we need to take that kind of hassle when we come here ? Go to KJ  kitchen , much better",UNK
8002,"We found this place via Yelp's nearby search. The restaurant looks very nice and it was quite packed for brunch. Since we were two, we were seated fairly quickly. Service and food were excellent. We would go back if in the area again.",UNK
8003,"Been here several times since the casino's ownership change. Service here has suffered along with menu selection. They nixed the Chinese menu altogether. Also, servers are not as friendly or expedient.",UNK
8004,"Been looking for new rugs for my kitchen floor, and since I wanted something with a Little padding, it was hard finding something to fit my expectation. I did find it at Lvesac Galleria",UNK
8005,"Had the worst experience eating at this restaurant. Cashier in front gave us the worst attitude.  I used to come to this restaurant every time I come to Las Vegas, I will not go any more.",UNK
8006,I like rios casino Kuzz the food is reasonable for me that can afford to pay for all my family to eat  room is big and service is good  Oh and the food was great compared to other casino n their price    Good job rios  I am coming back next year again  and hoping getting good service as we'll like this time,UNK
8007,You have to be  friend of the staff to get a table doesn't matter how long you have been waiting.  SVC is non existent,UNK
8008,Never have I heard of such a generous owner doing this for the community the gas is $1.99 right now. This is the best there was a line but totally worth it! Cashier was very nice great customer service! :),UNK
8009,They always have a stock of Jameson half gallons which the greenfield liquor store seems to not carry anymore.\n\nIts a smaller store but has all of the essentials and the employees are very personable.,UNK

8011,"The food was delivered fast and it wasn't bad.  Unfortunately, it wasn't what I ordered and the staff seemed more interested in getting things done quickly that correctly.",UNK
8012,"We used to eat here so much they knew our names. Not anymore. The food, which i love when done properly, is old, dried out, and unappetizing. The service has sadly gone downhill too. I can almost always spot Poor management, and this is one of those cases. Save yourself the trouble & dine elsewhere.",UNK
8013,was here in the middle of March '10. moderate prices for moderate sushi. i've been to the one in Scottsdale a couple years back. that one had really good sushi and a lively ambiance. probably better off heading up to that one instead.,UNK
8014,I do not like going into this location. The wait time is always toooooo long. I usually windup calling customer service to have my questions answered and then use the kiosk. Employees seem to be just chatting it up too much while people's precious time is being wasted.,UNK
8015,Tried this place for lunch on a Saturday. The staff was nice and the vegetarian options were yummy and inexpensive ($14 for two lunch entrees and naan). It's a great addition to downtown Urbana and it's nice to have an option for Indian food outside of Bombay.,UNK
8016,The dog park here is ok - no grass and the water fountains weren't working when we were there in the middle of summer.  But it is a pretty good size park and the pups loved running around.,UNK
8017,Worth the wait. Food quality is great and very fresh. Their dishes are very creative and modern. The beef carpaccio is to die for.,UNK
8018,"I love this place!  It's the real deal, so of course everything is delicious.  The quiches are great to take home or give as gifts!  I bought a pumpkin cheesecake for Thanksgiving that seemed ridiculously and uncharacteristically expensive at $36--until we tasted it.  OMG--worth every cent!",UNK
8019,I am receiving invoices when I paid in full on my visit!!! SO ANNOYING......and the prescription is the worst I have ever had. They tried fixing it and still not right!\nDONT GO THERE!!!,UNK

8022,The food was good and the waiter was nice. I sent back my French toast and traded it out for a cinnamon roll. The chicken fried steak and cinnamon roll is the bomb.defiantly come back,UNK
8023,Excellent food.  Fast service.  Clean restaurant.  My primary complaint is that the thermostat was set to hold at 65 degrees.  Seriously?  It's freezing in here!  Bring your hand warmers.,UNK
8024,Walk in is not correct for they book the whole day. Doctor is not on site all day like they say. So not happy with this location.,UNK
8025,"O M G. I think I died and went to Wagyu Beef heaven... Steak is amazing, service is awesome, food portions make it worth the price!! I'm coming back!!!",UNK
8026,"Good concept for a dark dingy place. Better customer service and they need to open that place up so non smokers can breath a little.\nSecurity is awesome there, very curious",UNK
8027,"The pizza is always good, but when you use fresh jalapenos on something use them sparingly!  Went there for lunch yesterday and while they seemed staffed service was slow. At one point it took 10 min to get a refill on water!",UNK
8028,"Food is inconsistent here. some days, the beef ribs are mouth-watering good. other days, they are a fatty, nonedible mess.\n\ni recommend trying the special especially the catfish!",UNK

8030,"The best pizza in Vegas. No chains. A local shop with fresh ingredients, gluten free crust, and fantastic flavor. There's a great selection of toppings and a some fantastic other-than-pizza menu items.",UNK
8031,Very comfortable atmosphere; like being in their family dining room. Service is very warm and friendly and quick!! $8 for a chicken lunch special with soup and egg roll is awesome. Will definitely be back!,UNK
8032,Thank you Fu Tattoo for completely ruining my husbands tattoo. What was once two initials with a heart is now one big blob. If you can't do a touch up on a customer you need to tell them. Awful. I will make sure to add a picture so everyone can see the work you clowns do.,UNK
8033,Really cool place. I went in right before brunch ended and I ordered the happy hour brunch breakfast tacos. These were delicious! Also tried the crispy fries which were equally as yummy. I will definitely be back for more brunch specials. Service was also on point.,UNK
8034,Believe the DDD hype. The calzone was perfect. Pizza was great. Service was some of the best and friendliest ever. They do not rest on their laurels. A must try.,UNK

8037,"I pass this all of the time but finally decided to stop.  The restaurant is incredibly clean and it was great service, but I felt like the food was just \""okay.\""  Nothing to brag/boast about.  Prices are fair.  Maybe so many groupons because not enough people are raving about it?",UNK
8038,I understand that high school kids work this shop but can anyone teach the Asian kid some customer service? Will not be returning to this shop.,UNK
8039,We were disappointed on a Friday afternoon with the pace of the meal. Onion rings took ages to arrive and my husband's and my burger came 5 minutes before our 3 young hungry children. Were they too busy to accommodate us? Nope. Only 1 other table filled. We won't be back and this place won't last.,UNK
8040,This place was great! I took my best friend for her birthday and she loved it. The service was good we got our drinks and food fast and everything tasted amazing ! Will be back :),UNK
8041,Understaffed and unfriendly service will ruin any sports bar and it definitely did for this old charming building host of a bad sports bar. They had sound on for a game yet no screens turned on to that particular game yet the bartender was to immerse I to her phone to e en notice.Too Bad and sad.,UNK
8042,"Sign out front says open to 2 pm Sundays. 1:30 and you are closed. 1 star. If you are going to post hours, stick to them. You suck.",UNK
8043,"I love this place & I love everything it stands for. Buy local. Kimber and her staff are so knowledgeable & friendly. Its kinda fun to just hang out and talk music with them. I learn something new every time I go in. Thanks Kimber, for all that you do for this city.",UNK

8046,"Partied with Hitachi Data Systems at Tao.  We were served fried rice, broccoli, Kung Pao Chicken, shrimp, and Korean beef.  It was delicious, but I'm dying thirst.  They must use MSG.  :P",UNK
8047,Walmart on steroids... Customer service is a joke. I cancelled my Sam's membership because of the lack of customer service at this store! Sam's Club is fine as long as you don't ever have to interact with an employee.,UNK
8048,"The ambience is great here. Make sure you sit outside overlooking the hills of North Scottsdale. The food is average, but not bad.",UNK
8049,My favorite breakfast/brunch place by far.  They have amazing pancake flavors and they're HUGE.  I had the lemon blueberry and oatmeal protein ... delicious.  It's clean and the service is great.  It's very small inside so you either have to be patient or beat the rush.,UNK
8050,"Went last Sunday for the brunch again.  Was all pretty good.  Not great, but good.   Don't know if we'll be back again, I guess I have a problem with paying $50 for brunch for two.  It's pretty pricey.",UNK
8051,Ah. Disappointing. Small portions. Boring poorly seasoned Japanese chow from 1995. Same old. Will not return.,UNK
8052,Oreganos is very unique Italian eatery. I have never ordered anything here that I did not really enjoy. They're Bellinis are the best I have ever had! But my absolute favorite thing to order here are there meatballs!,UNK
8053,Red potato is delicious! Probably the best pizza on the menu:). Secondly would be the buffalo chicken pizza. \n\nDo not get the wings though! Overpriced and fatty! Ugh. All in all good place for pizza!,UNK
8054,This place is still open because the snowbirds don't know what real Mexican food is all aabout and there is no where else in AJ to eat.  If you have a car there is no reason to eat here at all.,UNK
8055,"Food is good but only if you're eating there. Out of the last three times I've ordered for pickup they forgot to place my order twice and only realized so when I got there, unapologetic at best.",UNK
8056,"Too expensive for what you get. Other reviewers are right. The employees have a bad attitude. Subs are okay, way too salty.",UNK
8057,"My friend reminded me of the best part... When we walked outside after our horrible meal, there was a nasty used green condom on the floor. Yuck.",UNK
8058,"It was alright.  I've had much better Thai food. It had good decore, but that was pretty much the only thing that was memorable.",UNK

8063,The beer was good. I got the pineapple one. The service was good. But my burger should be taken off the menu immediately!  I had the Cancun blue burger. It was gross don't get it. So I give three stars because food was tuck. I'll try it again and get something else.,UNK
8064,"Ate a chicken corn dog & fries from here yesterday. I've been sick ever since. Vomiting, diarrhea, chills, fever....definitely food poisoning of some kind. If you decide to go here make sure everything is cooked all the way through.",UNK
8065,Had a beautiful dinner on the patio overlooking the fountain show for my birthday with loved ones.  Each and every part of our experience was fantastic.  This will be one of the best French meals you'll ever have.,UNK
8066,"Try to avoid if buffet hours are almost over. Waiter was annoyed we came in 25 minutes before lunch close. Felt so unwelcome that I'll try not to go back. Food was ok, but nothing any more memorable than other Indian buffets in the city - there's several good ones.",UNK
8067,Food is good but the customer service is horrible they have never deliver the right order in the four times that I've attempted to try this place,UNK

8069,Amateur operation. Horrible service. We were first to arrive this morning and not one of 10 employees would assist us when restaurant was otherwise empty. Hostess would not lead us to table or patio and table was filthy. My boyfriend and I laughed out loud and then walked out. Simply awful!,UNK
8070,"very good steak frites, onion soup, cocktails, and desserts. the view from the patio is definitely worth the wait. standard french bistro food, catered to an american audience.",UNK
8071,All the hype surrounding this place is warranted. The Reina Pepiada and Shredded Beef were damn good! And the dude slinging these treats was super friendly and welcoming. Will buy again. A+++++++,UNK
8072,This is one of the best sushi places I have been in a long time. I paid for the all you can eat and OMG was amazing to try everything. It was different then most sushi place were paying for a normal small roll which here I receive more then needed. \n\nI shall be coming here again.,UNK

8081,"Found this place to be just average. As a Mexican food lover, the food was ok. Had the fish tacos that we're just blah. Great service though.",UNK
8082,"Very good.  But when they say spicy, you must believe them.\n\nNothing outstanding, just good sushi and sashimi.  Jo-Ann would like to see a better selection of tempura, boxes, etc.",UNK
8083,Cool place to hang out if you like smaller crowds. Dance floor isn't very big so dont come here if you want to dance. Just a cool lounge to kick it at and listen to good music.,UNK
8084,"Watch out , the staff tries to solict your girlfriend for another guest. The punk kids that work there think they are so cool. Are they are hostesses, like in restaurant. I stick with XS next time.",UNK
8085,Pho is $2+ more expensive than OC. C- for service even though the food came out in a decent amount of time. My pho ga was bland 2/5. Hey at least I didn't get any food poisoning...knock on wood.,UNK
8086,"I'm going to start with three stars for Jasmine Thai.  Though the food that we ordered was tasty, it wasn't just what I had hoped for.  I ordered drunken noodles and it seemed like the noodles didn't separate all the way.",UNK
8087,"I have been to this place several times but it has been awhile.  I always had good food here and would recommend it.  It is not fancy, but it is worth the trip.",UNK
8088,Awesome late night hour service with above average pizza. Crispy crust and ok pizza. Only place open but we paid $14 for 2 slices. Depends in how hungry you are :-),UNK
8089,Absolutely the worst service ever. After helping me with my aquarium he took about 500 dollars of my equipment with him and will not return it after months of me trying to get it back. Do not use this company.,UNK
8090,"I gave them a 2nd chance. Still I can go to walmart and buy an 88 cent cupcake that will be MOISTER than these.  Granted it won't be as big or the frosting as glamorous, but the cake part of the cup will taste much better.",UNK
8091,"Arizona burrito, with sour cream and about 6 cups filled with the green hot sauce.  \n\nThat's all I have to say about that.  So good.....sooooo gooood.....",UNK

8093,"I've continued to come to Michaela for haircuts and the service is never short of amazing! She is very professional and my hair always comes out looking fresh. I bring my toddler and everyone is very playful with her, never an issue. A cold refreshing beer with my  haircut how can you beat that!!",UNK
8094,"Amazing food and champagne.  One of the best selections of champagne I have ever seen!  The Sunday Brunch is excellent, make sure you show up for that!!!  We went for dinner and had a wonderful experience.  As it got later in the evening the place got louder and more crowded.",UNK
8095,"This is decent, average Chinese food.  Nothing great, but certainly nothing bad.  Possibly a tad over-priced for the quality, but not the quantity.",UNK
8096,"Slightly overpriced, but the \""Skinny Jeans\"" juice is delicious.  The inside could be a little more inviting & it is a little dark, but is basically just a grab and go place.",UNK
8097,We wanted to come here with a group and they were far less than accommodating. They claimed our wait time to be 20 minutes and we waited for over an hour. They refused to join tables and spoke to us like we were an inconvenience. Very disappointed with this place.,UNK
8098,We had dinner there. The service was very friendly and fast.  The food was very good. I had short rib tacos and house rice. The food prices are very reasonable and the quality is top notch. We will be back!,UNK
8099,"Ok I have been on a burger hunt for a while. Have tried smash burger twice and found it pretty good, the sweet potato fries moved them from three to four stars. They get extra points for staying open late during movie premier events.",UNK
8100,"You've got to sit in the patio out back. I'm in Texas and have access to all types of great Mexican food. This place holds its own. Beer was cold, food was fresh, chips and salsa were good. I'd go back and I don't say that about too many places.",UNK
8101,"Really slow service. Mediocre food that is pricey. Love the bakery, but the bistro is not worth the money.\n\nI had the Croque Monsieur and the omelette du jour. both were just okay.",UNK
8102,"I wish I would have been flying an actual AA flight, but I was put onto a US Airways plane and it sucked.  I was really bummed, they haven't  been good for quite a long time.  Hopefully I'll get on an AA flight on my way back.",UNK
8103,"Bloody Mary was good! Service was a bit slow at times.  Food is warm to touch. Needs to be hotter, temperature wise. Would be a good idea to have stickers on the wing orders so that we can determine what flavor we r eating.  Overall atmosphere was fine. Needs color on the walls a bit plain.",UNK
8104,"Great ambience.  Awesome patio.  The food is greatly overpriced, in my opinion.  But if you are looking for a casual, upscale place for dinner with friends, give it a shot.  The atmosphere is ideal.",UNK
8105,"Excellent meal, great dessert, and so many beers.  I wasn't even mad when they were out of my favorite beer that night, because they had 10 other similar beers on tap, and several house brews/blends to try.",UNK
8106,"If I have to wait ten minutes for my burger to be cooked to order, why can't they cook it to order? Why does it have to be well done? Why can't they have cheddar, provolone, or Swiss? Why are the mushrooms canned?",UNK
8107,New happy hour is terrible. :(    They in one fowl swoop decreased substantial the quality and the portion size of the food offered for happy hour. They did this while somehow charging more.,UNK
8108,"This is a fun place to go and they have some fun items on the menu such as season corn and flavored drinks- however, when the season is off, they are a run of the mill burger place. Very greasy.",UNK
8109,"They just came out with a new vegan menu along with the regular menu and it was amazing! We tried the spicy noodles and the jungle noodles and they were both perfect! I've always loved going to this place, and with the new vegan menu and so many options, I'm excited to come back and try everything!",UNK
8110,"Visiting from LA, looked for a place to eat late at night and found this place. Would recommend the Champion burger, pulled pork fries, sunrise biscuit, and beignets",UNK
8111,The Service SUCKS we sat in the bar at 2-00 in the afternoon the bartender/waitress spent most of her time in the back showing her new baby.We could have D&D she was back there so long. Nachos were good beer was cold. But service is questionable. Was hungry but made me and my wife loose our appetite,UNK
8112,I don't know maybe it was the view from the top or my new love I was with but that aside...... The martini's were great and I I ordered fish that was excellent. all in all the view was worth the price of admission so to speak....,UNK
8113,"Nice and clean. Get a room ending with a low number or ask for one away from the freeway. Breakfast was adequate, not too bad. Fahed at the front desk was able to find a cooler for us to use on a day trip to Sedona. Much appreciated! Would stay tree again!",UNK
8114,"This is a good place to eat Thai.  The staff is great and the food is pretty good.  I love their sticky rice.  Be careful the cook makes everything pretty hot, even if you ask them to make it mild (that why only 4 stars) other wise everything we have tried is great.",UNK
8115,"My man and I were exploring Lake Las Vegas and decided to stop in one of the restaurants for dinner. After looking at the other options we picked this place, GLAD WE DID! I got the Truffled Mac 'n Cheese and he got the Rib Eye. Both were delicious.",UNK
8116,Truffled tater tots here are amazing.  And I'm not just saying that because I was drunk and it was some various hour of the early morning.  The tater tots came out piping hot and with a good truffle flavor. I just wish there had been more of them!,UNK
8117,"I love this place! Great margaritas and fajitas. I've only been there in the summer and it tends to be a little warm in the dining area. If not for that, I'd definitely give it 5 stars!",UNK
8118,"Ordered from the to-go counter.  Sit-down restaurant was closed when I visited at prime dinner hour on a weekday. WTF? Food quality was okay (3 stars) but prices are too high, even by airport standards.",UNK
8119,There shouldn't even be an option for a star. The service is horrible and bartenders are very rude. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone not even my worst enemy!,UNK
8120,"Food ok. I tried a piece of steak, which was ok and also had a grilled chicken and rice dish with steamed broccoli. I appreciated that the broccoli didn't seem smothered in butter. This place is comparable to any other TGI Fridays.",UNK
8121,"There are so many different pizza varieties here that you would think the quality couldn't hold up, but they are all just fantastic.  Beyond the pizzas their green beans are pretty stellar.  Normally I steer clear of green beans, but the ones here are delicious.",UNK
8122,"I just noticed that La Piccola or also known as Andys Place has another online deal, this time on livingsocial. I am puzzled by the thought that this business belittles patrons that use such a coupon and on the other hand keeps promoting them.... What am I missing.",UNK
8123,Love this place! Come in here to wash my dog once in a while but come here more for the dog bakery and pig ears... My boxer loves those! :) Staff has always been extremely nice so that is definitely a plus!!,UNK
8124,"The veggie salad was bland, fried rice was nothing special, lo mein had no flavor and the sweet and sour shrimp was just weird. Clearly not my favorite Chinese delivery place in the Lakes but probably the fastest and most friendly.",UNK
8125,"Service has been pretty good.  Onion rings, cheese fries, wings, and burgers have all been good.  Decent beer selection",UNK
8126,"Disappointing indeed. We eat a lot of phos\nall over. Here, the pho was blend, no flavor and pretty mucH MSG-ed out. Herbs were fresh, service fast, clean interior, thumbs up! Would not recommend the pho here.",UNK
8127,Was not pleased with the selection of food & the taste of it all but the vanilla yogurt & fresh fruit was very bland.,UNK
8128,"I dont mind coming here during the day, but I try to avoid coming here later in the evening. I just always have a bad feeling about this place and the kind of crowd that come around in the evenings. Price-wise, its just like every other walmart.",UNK
8129,I've banked with this bank for almost 15 years. There is nothing special about them. They are impossible to get ahold of. If they call you don't bother trying to call them back because they don't answer.  There are only 3 locations in the valley so hope you live close.,UNK
8130,This store has a great staff that's always willing to help out. Chef Mike has great food and looking forward to tasting the Mr. Wins sushi. Love that they have always asked if we need help out. Keep it up!,UNK
8131,If you like the rustic pine Mexico style of furniture you have to check this place out. They have a large selection with many different styles and sizes. They also have a good selection of decorative accessories to choose from.,UNK
8132,oh my god yaty sucks!!\nshe tottally messes up my hair \nshe is horrible idk why u have someone who doesent know how to cut hair working for you \nthe fade was the worst u could imagine \ni had to have the person that works next to her fix it,UNK

8134,"One of the best Happy Hours in town. 4-6pm Half off all the Tapas (apps) and their beer and wine. We brought the family in and ordered a bottle of wine, and six tapas and walked out stuffed for under $45.00.",UNK
8135,"My favorite Mexican restaurant! Hash brown breakfast burrito is to die for, fish taco or fish burrito is excellent. My other fav is the shredded chicken burrito. Hard to have a bad meal here. Cheap too.",UNK
8136,"Service was extremely slow and the food was horrible. A person in our party had coffee and said it was great, but no one was impressed with the food.",UNK
8137,"I just don't get this place.  The atmosphere is trying to be upscale, the desserts look upscale, but they simply don't taste all that great to me.  Totally not worth the money.",UNK
8138,"Perfect lunch place!  The food was fresh and tasted great!! If they have the bread pudding on the menu, it's a must have...and I don't usually like it.",UNK
8139,The food was never great here. But now it's gotten WAY worse. Talk about dry and horribly bland Chinese food. Wow!,UNK
8140,I found this place to have ok food. The staff is friendly! There is no need for me to ever go back that's how unimpressed I was.,UNK
8141,"Excellent happy hour and it lasts until 7! The food is delicious and so are the few drinks they have on their happy hour menu. Reasonable prices for happy hour. Early on between 4-6 it can be hard to find a place to sit, but well worth the wait.",UNK
8142,Great new Mexican style cooking here! Taco Tuesday's are great! $1 tacos and they always have a $1 draft beer!,UNK
8143,Great service and the food is prepared for every order instead of sitting out like most fast food places. The manager is friendly and the place is clean.,UNK
8144,"Always satisfied when I walk out! I'm a barber so it feels nice to be on the chair and trust me when I say, they know what they're doing!",UNK
8145,"If I could give less then one star I would!! This place was horrible, boiled flavorless, cold meat and way overpriced!! I will never go back! Not to mention the place was swarmed with flies! Ick!!",UNK
8146,"We love this place, it is always clean, well staffed & tastes so good! prices are reasonable & after you spend $50 you get $5 off.  The evenings get very busy, so we normally come in the afternoon.",UNK

8148,"Didn't get the side booth as requested in the online reservations. And didn't get the correct year of Wine. ($80 bottle) waitress said, \""oh its the same thing). Food was very good though. It's was the other things that will make me try somewhere else.",UNK
8149,Excellent presentation.\nNice decor (unchanged from painted pony)\nCalamari appetizer so so.\nGood service.,UNK
8150,I paid $9 for a chicken caesar salad and a cup of soup. They were both really generic and way over priced. I wouldn't eat that chicken again if you paid me. Reminded me of that disgusting pre cooked chicken that comes in a plastic bag at the grocery store for salads. Not coming here again.,UNK
8151,"Disappointing.  After reading the positive reviews,  we gave Vida a try for dinner.  I agree with another reviewer that it was subpar.  Better choices are out there",UNK
8152,I wasn't particularly pleased with the wait or the food.  I felt it was bland and lacked quantity. We waited at least 30 mins in the line before being able to order food and the another 10 for our food. We may try it again if the wait isn't so long.  Bummer that they use chicken stock in rice.,UNK
8153,The teppanyaki was amazing...our chef was very entertaining and the prices werent that bad. The staff was very friendly and accomodating to our needs. No complaints here.....,UNK
8154,"Every time I treat myself to Yeh!, I'm always satisfied. They have great flavours and toppings. As a vegan, having TWO sorbet options really pulls me back in for more!",UNK
8155,Here for dinner tonight and it's not what it use to be.  Changed the menu and the bean dip. Rice was awful.  Why do people fix what is not broken .,UNK
8156,bomb.com .. And Alyssa was such a good server ... We'll be coming here more often not bad first my first time trying it,UNK
8157,"I really like this albertsons. The staff is always willing to help and they're very nice. Prices at Albertson's are okay, I wouldn't recommend buy fruits or meat there since it is pricey. But customer service wise great!!",UNK
8158,"Molto bene! Love being able to get pizza by the slice.  In my opinion, the crust is perfect. The slices are large, so the $5.00 lunch special is a very good deal. My fave is their version of the margherita with plum tomatoes and basil....",UNK
8159,"I agree with Jamie C. BEWARE!!! My dog was brought  in here, now has a cut on her ear. I spoke with the owner about  this her exact words were \""this type of thing happens all the time in all groomer shops\"" No! Just yours! staff also very unprofessional",UNK
8160,4.5 stars.  I had their Bombero Burrito with green chile for the first time today...was SOOOO good.  I disagree with Shaun C.  I love the sauce they have in this burrito....,UNK
8161,"Great steaks! Love this place. I usually just sit at the bar, all the bartenders are fabulous and live up-to that old school bartender/steakhouse vibe. The frisee salad delicious with a poached egg on top!",UNK

8163,Seeking great food in dwntwn location and found it.  \n\nService was enthusiastic and eager to please.  They seemed to genuinely be excited for their product and guide customers to a meal that would please.\n\nMenu was expected but had amazing twists and was delicious!,UNK

8165,"Good time on the weekend, enjoyed live band (but way too loud).  No idea how the food is but it looked good and there were a lot of people eating.  A cool lounge atmosphere.",UNK
8166,"lettuce wraps were great!(not chicken, tofu wrap was better)\n\nalso eggplant was tasty\nsalmon is not recomended..uncooked",UNK
8167,This location is far from helpful with anything. Almost every item on the shelves had been used or broken and out of place. Good lucky trying to find ANYTHING. I'll have to drive to my favorite location on Camelback by the Biltmore.,UNK
8168,"Third time here. Not as good as before. Salmon not tasty, salad over loaded with dressing. Wait staff good. Restaurant clean.",UNK
8169,"Exactly what I wanted...yummy fish and chips, 2$ hefewiezen at happy hour and excellent service!",UNK
8170,Get out your GPS and hunt this joint down. Well worth the trip if you are an out-of-towner in search of seriously good eats.,UNK
8171,Talk about a hole in the wall. No frills at all here. One page paper menu with only a handful of dishes on it. Worth it for the pho and the price can't be beat.,UNK
8172,"My major complaint is that this place is SO SMOKEY! Service its pretty slow, so don't be in a hurry. Love their blacken wings! Come get them half of on Thursdays. Big portions for a decent price.",UNK
8173,Need help right now with an ear ache?  Forget it.  First available appointment is two\nweeks.  By then I will have found a cure myself.  thanks,UNK
8174,"Perhaps it was because this was our last stop on our \""club crawl\"" and it was late in the evening but Chateau left much to be desired. It seemed to be tired and the DJ was only so-so. It was getting pretty empty at about 2am.",UNK
8175,On point! Out of the way for me but I was in the area and stopped by and was pleasantly surprised! The spicy beef and lamb gyro was perfect! And he talked me into herbed fries which came with a dipping sauce that was pretty good. Full and satisfied :) would recommend!,UNK
8176,"Not sure why I'm reviewing a roller coaster, but it's here on Yelp so why not?\n\nThe Racer is awesome, it's one of those coasters you simply can NOT leave KP without riding.\n\nGo blue!",UNK
8177,"The woman in customer service refused to take my item without a reciept. I called their store from my car, she said it's fine. I went back in and she didn't honor it!!!!",UNK
8178,"Shayne was referred to us by a good friend and we used her for our personal and business taxes this year. She was really professional and very reasonable. We also are using her to help us with some IRS debt that we have. She is very friendly, knowledgeable and gets the job done fast. I highly recommend her.",UNK
8179,Too busy.   Too few servers.   Ribeyes. Med well instead med rare and nobody cares.    $23 of dog food I guess.,UNK
8180,"Do not take your vehicle if you value your sanity and your money. This was the worst auto repair experience I've had and if I never have another experience like this one, it would still be too soon for me.",UNK
8181,"never going back. The food was really blend, went with a colleague for lunch buffet, every Indian place I have ever been to at least had good chicken tikka masala but it was just too bad here, paneer was equally tasteless. The place was surprisingly full, probably due to lots of IT companies near by.",UNK
8182,"Even with almost nobody in the hall, it took an hour for the food to come out.\n\nI would not recommend this resturant.",UNK
8183,"Finally a true Tex-Mex place in Vegas! I'm from TX & was told about this place by a friend and the minute I walked in it reminded me of home. The fish taco's are massive & they do their corn Texas style.. My kids loved it and their picky, AWESOME FOOD!",UNK
8184,"Bad service. OK food. Overpriced prices (but hey, its Vegas). I like the decor but a 20 minute meal took an hour because the waitstaff was so inattentive.",UNK
8185,I love Cowboy Ciao in Scottsdale and was so pleased to pass some time here with friends before a recent trip to Mexico.  The mimossas were very good and the breakfast options make Cowboy Ciao a nice respite at the airport.,UNK
8186,I love their subs! They always make them really fast and the prices aren't too bad. I also like that they have cherry peppers. Most sub places don't have them.,UNK
8187,"It's a dive, but the food is world class. There is nothing comparable in the area, though there are many restaurants that serve similar cuisine.",UNK
8188,"Very good Mongolia grill! Taste is really great , lots of sauce and ingredients that you can customize yourself ~~\nLove the small colorful sticks that indicated u want to add eggs, cheese, roti, etc. That's something the other Mongolia grill doesn't have :)",UNK
8189,This location sucks. Always HUGE lines and no help. I have had soo many $5 CVS bucks expire because they are either out of stock on what I need or I end up putting my merchandise down and walking out because the line is crazy. This store needs new management! Someone needs to get off their ass!!!!,UNK
8190,"This Taco Bell is about the same as any other I've been too.  Service is okay, food quality is below average and prices run a bit higher then is justified.  \n\nMuch better food is available up and down Harris, no need to go to sub par places.",UNK
8191,Loved it very nice staff explained everything to me the food was hot the beer was cold they bring every table like 4 or 5 different sides to eat and this rice water had the kimchi pancake and some wings all was very good!,UNK
8192,"If you like good espresso, you need to try this cafe. Darn fine coffee. Whipped the stump town espresso I tried in AZ hands down",UNK
8193,"The only uniquely different buffet in Las Vegas.  Every other buffet in town is more or less the same thing.  Not here, if you want a unique buffet experience, this is the place.  You better like simple excellent French food, if not go to the 100 other crab leg & pizza buffets in town.",UNK
8194,"Love this place. Great wine and beer, fun games, good music...and Shari at the bar! What could be better?",UNK
8195,"Saw this show last month w/ a business associate.  Wonderful!  \n\nIt's irreverent, hilarious, entertaining and fun. A modern and hip vaudeville.  Don't miss it.",UNK
8196,There were at least 4 flavors of crawfish to get here. The sauce was good and it did not leave me sick with an upset stomach. The shrimp was yummy too. The mild flavor was lacking taste but that's no surprise.,UNK
8197,"Great italian food.  My favorite was the half cannelloni, half manicotti plate with red sauce and a splash of alfredo.  Not on the menu, yes I was that difficult.  Great rustic setting too.",UNK
8198,"basic food, nothing special, but all tasted good.  Limited menu, funny wine selection, no multipuciano, or other usual italian wines.  Just the popular basics.  Right next to Goodwill, but better than you'd expect",UNK
8199,This place is good  They have a great selection of beer and wines.   I will be bringing my mom back to try the crab cakes for sure as she is a fan and they were pretty darn tasty. \n\nMake sure to try the garlic fries too - they are fresh cut and tasty.,UNK

8205,I came back for another visit and ordered their signature panini and it was delicious! I also really like the spinach salad that it comes with as well. Hands down one of my favorite coffee shops in AZ!,UNK
8206,"Amazing food, great prices, friendly staff, and a great selection.  What more can you ask for?  I love the mandarin chicken and the homemade ice cream.  Asian Fusion at its best.",UNK

8210,"It was OK, nothing special.  The portions were pretty good, but overall, I felt it was on the pricey side for what was offered.",UNK
8211,"Generally, good restaurant.  However, went in the other day and ordered a vegetable sandwich.  i wanted a little protein to go with the sandwich, however, and my server flat our refused.  He would not even agree to bring out a separate, side of bacon for me to put on the sandwich myself.  This was just plain weird.",UNK
8212,"This has place a horrible server! He talked back to our table and got an attitude, even though he was the one that forgot to place our order. After letting him know we were disappointed in the service he got an attitude and never came back to out table. Red-head server/bartender.",UNK

8220,Beware of Nielson at the drive thru on Lake Mead and Tenaya. Check your receipt for your total to make sure that he isn't pocketing tips that weren't offered to him!,UNK
8221,Place is a great steak house. The family style is the way to go and let the chef pick what he sends out. I have been here a few times and always like to go here if anyone I know is staying at MGM. Thinks it's the best restaurant in that whole hotel.,UNK

8230,"We had a couple hot dogs, jello shots, and fries here. The jello shots were basically the same as what you would find anywhere else. \n\nThe hot dogs were definitely good, but nothing about them seemed fantastic. Overall it was good and very convenient, but not anything spectacular",UNK
8231,"The job is basic the price is high, chair  at bar is very uncomfortable if you just want manicure. I went here for manicure  and relax but the chairs ...",UNK
8232,Breath taking rudeness from the brunette host upon arrival. Embarrassing to show American hospitality at its worst to my International guests. Walked away and went to the excellent Spanish Tapas place next door.,UNK

8240,Enjoy Freddy's but went there today and most tables were dirty.  Not a good thing to see.    A bit more attention needs to be paid to the cleanliness of the place.    Good food but the place also needs to be properly bused...,UNK
8241,"Been to this place once! We were a big group, so we kinda tried a lot of their food. I had the steak which was ok! IChili's steak was better :(\n\nIf you are looking to get some awsome steak, stop by Ruth's Chris Steak House.",UNK
8242,"It's great for grabbing fresh to-go sushi from, however the customer service for sit-in dining is less than desirable. My recommendation is get it to go and enjoy at home. I gave it 3 stars because the sushi itself is pretty great!",UNK
8243,Horrible golf rangers. Harassed me and my daughter all day about being slow. She is a beginner and wanted to show her a nice course. I WAS WRONG! Do not go to this course if you are not PGA quality. Rangers told me I would be happier playing somewhere else!,UNK
8244,"They pick up your food and not far from where is my table, just next to the entrance, there's a bin where the empty dishes go. The waiter throw the dishes instead of putting the dishes in the bin and that is so noisy for the ears. The noise seemed to be forever. The design of the table were nice and our waiter also.",UNK
8245,"Huge, delicious sandwiches.  Take out only and I would recommend calling in your order because the wait for your sandwich can be 10-20 minutes.  A must try!",UNK
8246,"Took 15 mins just for my existence to be acknowledged.  Just waited and waited.  Not one person asked if I needed help, or told me that they'd get right with me.  Keep up the crap job, ladies.",UNK
8247,"I've been her twice for lunch.  Price is great for what you get, and portions are good.  I had the spicy fried Thai chicken rice, double Thai hot. made me sweat!  I'd recommend them.",UNK
8248,"I had Jenny do my hair here, she did a fabulous job! I found where I am getting my hair done in Phoenix! The salon is trendy and very clean while lightly playing great background music. Thank you Snapdragon and Jenny!",UNK
8249,Definitely not worth the price. Too many other good choices try the new Fox place across the street. MUCH better than Chestnut. Sorry to say,UNK
8250,"Line was long on the Friday night we went, but they were certainly trying hard to get everyone served, so you can't be too hard on em' for that! We were happy with our choice to eat here!",UNK
8251,Went there for the first time tonight.....awesome happy hour prices and friendly service. Sushi was also very good!! Coming back for sure!!,UNK
8252,This is like my go to fast food place. The food is almost always fresh and delicious the only problem here is the customer service. They're always rude and act like they hate their lives. But the fast and speedy service makes up for their bitchyness I guess lol.,UNK
8253,Hems...\n\nWill always like this place because of so many great memories there.\n\nThey have pretty decent food and a good selection of beers for a college bar.  Prices are very good but can get extreamly crowded at night and on weekends.,UNK
8254,"As we sit here with blissfully overly full bellies, we decided to take this moment to reflect on our experience at Harvest.  Bottom line: great breakfast experience.  Loved the decor, and the food in our estimation was well done, huge portions, and affordable!  We'll be coming back!",UNK
8255,We ate here last week. The restaurant has a great atmosphere but the sushi was horrible. The fish tasted old and dirty. I would not recommend this place.,UNK
8256,"Barf. Why are humans so lazy. Just because I'm held captive in terminal C, it doesn't mean I deserve to eat dog food.",UNK
8257,"Love Rocco's - seriously reminds me of an east coast pizzeria.  Their white pizzas are great and they have tons of delicious appetizers.  Very friendly staff for the most part, except sometimes the cashiers.  I've even ordered bulk amounts for a work event and everything was made perfectly, on time, and very affordable.",UNK
8258,"Great food that is made to order, I go inside everytime for that reason...fteah and as fast as fresh can possibly be. \n\nP.S. the party melt with extra butter and onions is the bomb.",UNK
8259,"We are from SF, and if this place was in SF, it will be put to shame.\nSushi was lackluster, didn't even offer green tea to wash the rice down. Beer came when almost finished with dinner. \n\nDon't be fooled if you are a sushi pro.",UNK
8260,Great outlet boutique with everything from Armani Jeans to Armani Collection and Emporio Armani...it's a bit of a small store so you have to be patient while going through all options.,UNK
8261,TWC is the worst cable company I've ever dealt with. Each time I've called for Tech Support I was on hold for at least an hour. Their only response is to unplug the box.  I'm on my 2nd DVR box in 2 months & channels go out randomly.  If you can get cable somewhere else do it!,UNK
8262,"Great sandwiches for lunch, offering artisan breads and fresh garnishes. Hearty soups and salads are also available; check out their Lenten specials this time of year.",UNK
8263,Got a Togo order and maybe it's better at the restaurant but the pizza dough was soft and under cooked and the bread sticks were wrapped in this huge tin foil which maybe the very soggy and wet.not worth 26 bucks but like I said it could be better eating there,UNK
8264,This place is A dive. Really surprised this place is still here. red neck heaven. Don't recommend this to anyone. Restrooms are filthy. They don't serve food. Just beer. Liquor.,UNK
8265,"Wow, even with low expectations, this place was awful.  There was over an hour wait, the waiting area was hot, and the food was actually bad.  Not just \""not good\"" - it was bad.  We choked down some pasta and left asap.  Even with a Groupon, we felt like it was a bad decision.",UNK
8266,This place is really awesome very affordable price and it's worth it . Except it's not great when ur watching a good movie and parents brings there infant to the movies not cool,UNK
8267,Met a group of friends here on a Sat afternoon. We had fun despite the rude bartenders. I am not sure who or where they think they are...but quite a joke they are!  Management needs to send them back to etiquette class.,UNK
8268,"Good group of guys work there, overall real friendly which is rare for the bar scene. Limited drinks on tap but prices are very reasonable. good food, no complaints really. the layout is a little odd, but that does not bother me.",UNK
8269,Lame. Waited with a group of 4 outside at a table for 20 mins. Never got service. We all left.\n\nThere were only 10 people in the whole restaurant. The servers and bartenders were too busy talking with regulars to help out new customers.,UNK
8270,Love harkins. They are always good with loyalty cups and free popcorn passes. We love to come here for date night and always have a good time.,UNK
8271,I purchased a living social gift certificate and this was my first visit. I will definitely go back. This is an outstanding service oriented salon. I have short thick hair and Allison gave me one of the best haircuts I have ever received! I have already made my second appointment.,UNK
8272,"Not very good, sadly. The portions were decent and the prices inexpensive, but the food is rather bland and not very exciting. I also had a pi\u00f1a colada and it was milky and and watery at the same time. Can't say I would return when I go back to Montreal.",UNK
8273,"Incredible.\n\nIf you're looking for somewhere to take a bunch of pictures, drink and listen to music then this is the place. Its like being a club, but not...get it??",UNK
8274,"The food is good, but I just cannot get past how horrible the service was. It took us almost 2 hours to order and eat our food, what were they doing? The restaurant was not full, it was not busy. Probably will not be going back.",UNK
8275,Have had pizza at their scottsdale location many times and it was great. The food at this location is not so good! I will definitely never have pizza from here again I was excited when I moved to East Mesa that there was a Ray's close by.. Very dissappointed the pizza tasted very bland!,UNK
8276,I absolutely love this sub shop! Its the only place i will get a sub sandwich! I have been going here for over 10 years and i NEVER get tired of it! Mitch is an awesome owner and he really cares about the customer! MUST GO!,UNK
8277,Yummy but always understaffed. They need to hire folks to just run the cash register while the two main ladies take care of the special orders. Always a constant problem and very frustrating.,UNK
8278,The app says no appointment needed but when I walked in that's the first thing they ask. They were saying they were busy but the people in the back didn't have anything just talking about last night. Well I wish them luck because I know I won't be coming back hope no one else has this experience.,UNK
8279,"Wow, great chocolate truffles... in downtown Madison. Excellent in beautiful boxes. They're made in their factory in Verona, Wisconsin. Fresh and delicious.",UNK
8280,My family loves coming to the Mesa Cracker's for breakfast and sitting on the patio (weather permitting of course)!  We always receive such wonderful service and food!,UNK
8281,Horrible service and this review is based mostly on the service. The happy hour drinks tasted watered down and way too sweet as for the food bland and except for the nachos everything belse was just edible not really enjoyable. Be aware of Raul he needs to be  careful from his choice of words to the customer,UNK
8282,I found this place through yelp. Great hole in the wall with excellent fresh fries to go with a modest sized chili cheese dog. Best lunch for under $10 even with a tip.,UNK
8283,Wanted to give a shout out to Aaron. Great customer service and very friendly. He made our time at Freddy's very enjoyable.Thanks Aaron for the wonderful service.\n\nThe steak burger was awesome and really enjoyed the chocolate ice cream with brownie concrete .,UNK
8284,Meh was ok\nfood is nothing special and the prices were average\n\nguess I have to continue my search for good mexican food in arizona,UNK
8285,"They have a variety of hot pot . We ordered the kim chi hot pot and the spicy beef hot pot , both were delicious . They were generous with the portion. Sae , our waitress had a beautiful smile and was very friendly . She explained the different hot pots . Overall a great experience .",UNK
8286,I went on August 21 with my son. It would be better if one of your employee will let your customer know what's going on with there vehicle rather than just giving a paper.,UNK
8287,"Great selection. I can always find a last minute blouse whether it's for work or a date. Can't beat the savings either. I find some really awesome bargains here on unique items, but I won't say what so that you can go on your own treasure hunt!",UNK
8288,It was funny seeing all the boys in their Ed Hardy shirts.  \n\nA bit older crowd.  Scene not as poppin.  Typical hip hop.  Small dance floor.  Overlooks the Treasure Island lagoon so that was kind of nice.  Open bar until 1am.  Another pre-party spot.  =],UNK
8289,Its a crazy party and its a small location...honestly just watch the bartenders. One of them added quite a bit more tip than I gave them when I looked at my credit statement.,UNK
8290,I am getting married in September and I just had the best consult from the owner and her staff! So excited to work with them and see their vision. Couldn't be happier with my overall experience. Yayyyyyyy!!!!,UNK
8291,Sooooooo good! The carne asada tacos are amazing the last 2 times I ate here I couldn't take a picture because I ate the food to fast but now I made sure so I can post this yummy stuff for everyone to see! Plus it's only $1 a taco!,UNK
8292,"This place rocks! Always a good time and the paintings I love are on my wall at home. Whether its a class or on open studio, every time I've been the teachers and Gia are always so helpful and encouraging. Will definitely continue to come here and recommend to friends!",UNK
8293,Staff was extremely friendly! Very accomodating to large groups! Drinks were great and they kept them coming! Off hours are the best! If you're free on Saturday for a quick bite and and cold brew this is the place to go!,UNK
8294,"While I only went here for the rides, Lets just say that the Stratosphere isnt a bad place.  It definitely stands out as it looks unique.\n\nThere is always a line for the rides on top.",UNK
8295,"I love pizza but didnt like howthe edges of the deep dish were so hard :( next time will order thin crust, sauce is really good here:)",UNK
8296,Bad service and rude employee. She made mistakes with our order and made us feel unwelcome. Like it was an inconvenience to fix the order and refund the overage. Anyone have a good falafel place for the north valley?,UNK
8297,the best church ive ever been to.  i started going to the providence h.s. location about 3 years ago.  the music and teaching is great and the people are wonderful. this is where my friends go and this is where i go when im not going to one of the other loctions,UNK
8298,"We have been coming here for almost a year. Sunday nights after 9pm, they have the best happy hour in town. $2.50 pints, $6.00 Stromboli, and great karaoke music with Sheila.",UNK
8299,This is a great Chipolte.  Perfect location---across the street from Fashion Square.  The staff is always helpful and friendly.  The food/toppings are always fresh and tasty!,UNK
8300,The taxi never showed up. I had this experience twice. They didn't show up after I called at 5 am when no one else would need a taxi. They suck. Don't use them.,UNK
8301,"Sure it looks nice and the room is cool, but I was NOT  impressed with the 10 min wait time to get the front desk on the phone.  They tell you that you get free internet but actually you are charged $20/day for it.  Internet is super slow, too!!",UNK
8302,Their food size is pretty good one . But honestly the dumplings we got were way worse than my home made ones ... Too plain to have it . My order was pork stone rice which was super plain ...totally killed our appetite that night . Hope they can boost their food flavor up.,UNK
8303,Horrible experience! We waited for an hour for our food while tables seated after us were all served. The burger I ordered was awful and our fries were definitely retrieved from the bottom of the deep fryer. Don't bother with this tourist trap.,UNK
8304,"*We went opening weekend* Good pizza, the service was great. Chris & Paul were great. The kitchen was a little slow but it was packed and it was opening weekend, we didn't hold it against them. Even with the kitchen being slow our service was so great we barely noticed. We will be going again.",UNK
8305,"Great potential for a \""local\"" hangout\nOnly downer is the bacon on the burgers....country style - thick fatty and really grisly\nMacaroni cheese with salad was outstanding!\nRecommend :)",UNK
8306,"This is the worst restaurants ever, I ordered delivery 2 hours ago and it is still not here. I have been to the restaurant couple time and it is so ghetto as hell. I will never and won't recommend to go there anymore.\n\nI am a Chinese, I would not recommend going there for sure.",UNK
8307,"Sandwiches are way to big.  Plus nothing but meat and bread, was sick of it only a few bites in.  I had the pastrami and my brother had the brisket.  He also said the brisket was dry.",UNK
8308,"They improvements to the restaurant are great... they place is warm and inviting and the big screen TVs and free Wifi make it a great place to eat there for breakfast, lunch or dinner. The bean and cheese burritos are super fresh and their sauce is outstanding!",UNK
8309,"If you like the kind of \""family\"" Mexican that is served in a million different Mexican restaurants this is the place for you. The chips and salsa are fresh and the fajitas are hot. Its just ok.",UNK
8310,"Awesome breakfast spot! Fast service, great ambiance and easy access!  It is located in the lobby of the Hyatt and is a great, easy breakfast place in Downtown Phoenix.",UNK
8311,"Food was just OK, and service was just OK, too.  Ordered a coffee and it took way too long for it to arrive.  But it's a 24/7 cafe, so how good can you expect it to be, eh?",UNK
8312,"Good, but not by NYC standards. Good on its own. Nothing fancy, cash only. Average for deli service. There are more exciting restaurants in the neighborhood unless you are craving Jewish deli.",UNK
8313,"fun vibe, and great food. I LOVED my chorizo scramble. Scones and morning buns are amazing. Good coffee. Only disadvantage is you have to go downstairs to get your drinks refilled.",UNK
8314,"I've been here once. Couldn't justify coming back. The sushi dishes are rather small and dry and not very fresh. The prices are alright, should be lower for the quality that they are. The atmosphere is crazy loud, definitely not family oriented.",UNK
8315,OMG. Beautiful staff...and they are friendly as hell. Come by to refill your drink for you..burgers and sandwiches are awesome...low on seating on a rainy day though.,UNK
8316,I went there for the first time about 7 years ago and had a much better experience.  This time is was heavy on the UGLY and not worth the free cover we got.,UNK
8317,"They're happy hour is great! It's also just a comfortable place. The bartender is nice and always remembers us. It's a great place to get some pizza and a beer, I recommend it.",UNK
8318,I come here when I want some pho. Think its somewhat better than other pho places. The pho taste a little less oily.,UNK
8319,"amazing food! really cool creations and combinations of food. the portions are HUGE! the staff is polite.  ... word to the wise, bring your appetite and a friend to share with",UNK
8320,Didn't think it was that great. Over priced even for downtown Gilbert. Went by the owner but he didn't say anything or acknowledge.  I guess they don't need the repeat business.  Won't be back,UNK
8321,I came here for breakfast and it was delicious. The service is pretty good and the breakfast deal was only $3.49. Bigger portions would be nice though :),UNK
8322,"Its a very nice big store and good prices but their outside security is not so good mostly at night . Be careful when alone ,its dark and no security around if something goes on out there no one will hear or see if late . Bad bad lighting needs more light",UNK
8323,"What's better than a red beer and people watching?\nI think locals appreciate this more, because I was entertained four a couple hours watching everyone roaming by.\n\nGood bar food and a few great bartenders.",UNK
8324,"2/2/13- prices have gone up $1.00 since 2012.  I got tzatziki on the side .50 extra. If its on the sandwich it's free, but what's the difference? I'm going to take a break from this place for awhile, which is a shame cause I really liked it.",UNK
8325,Went with a friend for Brunch.  She had Croque Madame and I had French Toast  We spent more than $50!  It was tasty but just not worth the money.\n\nWould hsve rather gone to Bouchon.,UNK
8326,"Their menu is a bit overwhelming, but everything we had was very tasty and at reasonable prices, with plenty remaining for leftovers.  We will be back to explore more of this menu!",UNK
8327,"Will not come back...  this place has no windows? Decoration is outdated. Looks scary in there. Food, I didn't like.",UNK
8328,"I had a taste for a blooming onion, its not what it use to be so I said something. It was taken off my bill and received a gift card for a return visit. Very loyal staff and management. They can use smaller plates since the meals are tiny. Really tiny.",UNK
8329,Great tasting Loco Moco!  Very authentic and I left very full/satisfied for only $7.  Can't beat it...,UNK
8330,"went to TeePee while on vacation and looking for good mexican food. loved,  loved the ambiance of this place. and the food and margaritas were great!!",UNK
8331,"Yes, very Americanized Chinese food, but reasonably priced and with great service. They seem to do mostly takeout service, however the dining room is clean, spacious and inviting. Big portion sizes and delicious. This place is a great option in favor of fast food.",UNK
8332,The room smelled so bad when we first checked in. It smelled so bad it became sort of uncomfortable. Like old sheets smell and unwashed smell. Everytime we step in the room it was a nightmare. The fumes got to us. I wouldn't recommend this hotel.,UNK
8333,"Too pricey when you have to cook your own meat - that was ok, but not great.   Selection a bit limited and noisy when busy.   Of course, I did not have the student price - so may be 3 stars if you can get it for $10.",UNK
8334,Greats apps and wine. I got the ribeye and was disappointed. Too much fat and gristle.   Also another person I was with got a similar cut. \n\nThe new york strip looked good. \n\n\nBetter experience at Delmonico's at the Venetian.,UNK
8335,Completely messed up my order. I asked for a burger wrapped In lettuce and fresh onions and gave me a patty with no lettuce and a little cup of the carmalized onions. It was soggy and disgusting and cost me $13.00. NEVER AGAIN!,UNK
8336,"Great stadium, great workers there, nice field.... \n\nLove all that of it, hate parking and leaving the stadium....Dirt parking and small streets to get in and out of the area.  Be prepared for this part of it as well.",UNK
8337,Lowest prices on everything. Period.  I save an average of 5-10 dollars a bottle compared to other stores.\n\nEXCELLENT selection,UNK
8338,The best macarons!!! Cindy makes them fresh and to order absolutely love the flavor and they are better than any other macarons I have tasted anywhere!,UNK
8339,"I'm pretty irritated that my 2 pizzas, quoted at 19-29 minutes just took 1hr 8 minutes to get here. Completely unacceptable. I'm shocked it was even warm at all. Though the cheese was no longer melty. And James was hardly apologetic. I'll order from Val Vista next time.",UNK
8340,"We had to stop here on our trip!  I love the selection of yogurt and fresh fruit.  Even when I suggested the kiwi looked a little beat up, she changed it out to get me fresher kiwi.  If we had one in Seattle, we'd definitely frequent it!",UNK
8341,"New location seems to be the same as the old location in terms of quality of food. Menu is a bit confusing if you're trying to make your own, but I always get the mochiko bento with kimchee fried rice so that's quite easy to order.",UNK

8345,"Freshly prepared dishes, but POOR VALUE. Ordered $6 blackened mahi-mahi tacos which contained about one ounce of fish filling. I get more filling in $1.50 tacos I get at Mexican taquerias.  Two star rating also given due to lack of flavor and spiciness.",UNK
8346,Food and service are so good.\nThe music is so loud that I kind of don't want to come back.\n:(,UNK
8347,"Just happened to be walking down the street and stopped for a frozen custard. It was okay, portion size was good, just nothing amazing about it.",UNK
8348,"Food was okay I wasn't impressed. My girlfriend had a salad and a she got was a lousy iceberg salad. The service was slow , I doubt I'll go back .",UNK
8349,"The food is relatively good but it's hard to get past the ripped booths, sticky tables, marks on walls and just unclean conditions. This location could use a lot of updating and restoration before we come back.",UNK
8350,"The juices are pretty tasty, but their customer service is poor and this is why they don't deserve more stars. Located in an upscale area they refuse hundred dollar bills.",UNK
8351,"Good Brews, nice ambiance, good food, but Kitchen Staff needs a tune-up as the Burrito Special came out barely warm\nthe same as the side of rice.  Had to be sent back to get food to serving temperature.  Will be back.",UNK
8352,I never knew that there could be fancy Mexican food that I loved as much as my local taco truck. I was wrong. Dead wrong. Be sure to order the pork shoulder tacos and a bottle of the Inedit beer straight outta Barcelona!,UNK
8353,"At least one AM breakfast in Vegas involves a crepe and a baguette.  The crepes are very tasty and not too overpriced.  The location along the \""(cobblestone) streets of Paris\"" is very cool.  Ive gone sweet and ive gone savory and both are very tasty.",UNK

8356,"What a great gym! My wife and I were traveling for Thanksgiving and we're looking for a gym to do a drop-in. The gym was beautiful, coaches were great and the wod was well thought out. Oh, and Alexandra Lachance is one of the coaches. Getting a picture and opportunity to meet her was awesome!",UNK
8357,"Sunday football brunch was packed. Pulled pork hash with eggs was pretty good, but the highlight was the $15 bottomless Bloody Mary (had a bunch). \n\nLowlight was definitely the ghost waiter who never visited after taking our order unless we got another server to ask him or got up to look for him.",UNK
8358,"I wasn't impressed with some of the bus drivers I recently rode with. One driver kept honking intentionally at other motorists, the other told off a motorist for blocking the road/bus stop. Public transit should set a good example.",UNK
8359,"A reasonably good kitchen shop that sells all those very specialist impliments that you don't get in many places.  Prices are strange ... sometimes feels like you're getting good value, other times that things are overpriced ... but I can't say exactly why it feels that way.",UNK
8360,"We made a reservation for indoors, and when we arrived they made us sit outside- where it was freezing. The hostess said we would have to wait for 15-30 minutes if we wanted to sit indoors (there was no one inside)! The food was disappointing and overpriced. Really a poor restaurant for being in the beautiful Palazzo.",UNK
8361,This Starbucks is one of the more ornate locations that I have visited.  I enjoying the decor with the crystal chandeliers and all but besides the furniture there is nothing else remarkable to report about this location.,UNK
8362,"Delish!!! I love pho but I hate it that I always come out smelling like fish from Vietnamese places, not this one. The cleanest, friendliest, and one of the yummiest services ever!  I'm going to be a regular since I just moved to the area. :)",UNK
8363,Took over 20mins to just get our drinks. The steak in my burrito came out ice cold then took 20mins to get right.  Never even got my refill on my drink. Never going back,UNK

8365,Fried rice is very dry and the General Tso isn't really spicy. Portions are pretty good size. Never had them mess up my order which is good. Delivery is on part with other places.,UNK
8366,"Yes very salty, It's like Panda Express. But the crab legs flow like water there and they are never overcooked. Plus you never really have to fight over the crab legs like other buffets.  The food is good. And they have lots of sushi that is endless.",UNK

8370,"I was informed by Volvo I Am that I needed a new AC compressor at a cost of $1300. I had a second opinion at the Volvo dealership who told me that my AC unit was just fine. In addition to the unethical business practices of this shop, the owner was extremely rude and aggressive.",UNK

8373,If you're on a budget this place is probably 4 star however it's not for me. It's very bland- not something I'd expect from a Mexican restaurant.,UNK
8374,Fantastic!  The Farm burger was fabulous and the sweet potato fries with powder sugar were great. Huge fan of food.  Service on the hand was slow. They forgot our fries and we had to ask for them and did not get them until we were 3/4 done with our burgers.,UNK
8375,"After wanting a hot bowl of pho, I came across to this place. I got the pho tai, and it honestly was like any other bowl of pho I've had. There wasn't anything special about it, but it was edible. There's a possibility that I would come back.",UNK
8376,This Starbucks is the worst I've ever been to. I've tried to like it numerous times and have finally given up. Weak coffee and the staff is extremely slow with bad customer service. Go across the street to the one at Harris Teeter.,UNK

8380,"Just got back from lunch, and it was incredible!  The staff is so friendly and the food was excellent.  Chicken was so tender and tasty.  The salad, tomatoes & onions tasted very fresh. As always, edens grill will never disapoint.",UNK
8381,"I liked their pumpkin curry. Frankly, of all the restaurants that deliver curry(Thai or Taiwanese), I liked this the best. I'm giving four stars because I found them to be a little expensive for their portions.",UNK
8382,"well ... maybe trying to shake the 1.5 star rating on Yelp ... they are now changing their name to \""Bambino Bistro\""",UNK
8383,Food was great especially the roast lamb. Was a bit disappointed they served boring fries with the steak though and the service was frosty.,UNK
8384,"Was just told that they were out of sushi.... Like KFC running out of chicken. Didn't know that was possible, visit at your own risk!",UNK
8385,"Amazing selection of pastries and other breakfast treats. Pricey but in line with most places in Vegas. The first time I came here two years ago the yogurt parfait was Vanilla bean and in a shallow bowl; the new version does not even compare, it's too bad they changed it.",UNK
8386,"i had a very negative experience and jack was not in the the least bit trustworthy. this shop is really bad karma and i will never go back,",UNK
8387,"Always end my nights out here! Great games, cheap drinks, and fun people watching. If I could change ONE thing it would be the bathroom! Adding a sliver of a stall to make 2 whole toilets shouldn't have eliminated porta potties. We are speed drinking here! We need toilets!",UNK
8388,"This is finally the neighborhood restaurant it should have been a while ago. Stopped in and had some appetizers& a glass of wine. Food was good, wine was reasonable and staff was friendly! And to top it off the place was packed.   \n\nLooking forward to having this in my neighborhood.",UNK
8389,Overall good service when I come here!!   Food was hot & good!!    I would come again & recommend to a friend :-) \n\nI ordered the 2 piece mixed special for $2.99.,UNK
8390,"No tropical smoothie is good but this one is the worst in town. There's never more than one person working, they never know how to work the register, and forget it if you have a food AND drink order. They're always short and rude to customers too.",UNK
8391,"Not impressed so far.  Showed up at 11:30 and they had no rooms avail with a King Size Bed, which was requested.  When I got into the room, the toilet was filled to the rim with the last guests lunch...Nice!",UNK
8392,"This place is SUPER OLD! It's basically ancient, but it's the best place for kids to stay at. Their amusement park, arcade, and Midway are by far the best entertainments for 18-",UNK
8393,Service is awful. Waited over 25 minutes just to have our order taken. There were tables who were seated after us whose orders were taken before us. We were getting ready to walk out when the waitress finally came over. Never again.,UNK
8394,"After leaving my bad review Dana was gracious enough to contact me, which to me goes a long way. So I wanted to add this bonus review that I do love Hula's for happy hour. I will go back someday for actual dining and try it again.",UNK
8395,Eat at the bar great service great drinks. I loved the food I don't  get the negative reviews here   The food is fresh and good way better than any other like place in Vegas. I could come here over and over. My favorite bar and and grill in Vegas.,UNK
8396,Total disappointment. The food was okay but the service was ridiculous.  The only way they stay in business is the captive resort audience. We waited for 30 minutes for a table for dinner during which I counted about 15+ open tables in the restaurant!  The majority of tables were open and still a 30 minute wait and very poor service. Total bummer!,UNK
8397,"Not the greatest place ever. has a pretty massive indoor pool which is great. The beds aren't special, the TVs are old, and the breakfast is horrible. It's not expensive so whatever, that's what you get.",UNK
8398,"Decent prices, nice staff (mostly) and good atmosphere. Didn't try any food but intrigued enough to go back. Had a glass of sparkling rose and a companion had an unoaked Chardonnay and both were enjoyable.",UNK
8399,Really good food at decent prices (for being on the strip).  Not a traditional steakhouse but just as good as many of them.  Sitting out on the strip is very nice at nighttime.,UNK
8400,"Friendly staff, but they think it's okay to serve a burnt bagel.  Check your order carefully or go to the other bagel shop next to the Starbucks that's just yards to the south.",UNK
8401,Steak was good. Chicken was chewy. Service was great. Price not bad. I've had much better for the price.,UNK
8402,"Good breakfast foods, good coffee, haven't tried anything but breakfast. Service is friendly but always slow, day and night. Don't go if you are in a hurry, but if you have time to hang out, you'll enjoy breakfast day or night!",UNK
8403,"Arizona Burger was delicious, fresh off the grill when I got it. It was hot in terms of temperature and spiciness, so it was pretty stupid of me to walk there and back from my office in the Phoenix heat for it. \n\nOK value overall. I'll definitely be back to try more from the menu.",UNK
8404,"Good beer. Food is like beefed up bar food but tasty. Good setting, good atmosphere. Good good good, nothing great. Local business, did I mention good beer? Service is good, but they get slammed quick.",UNK
8405,"staff were very helpful and my order came out fast.  The set up was really great, like a REAL COFFEE SHOP.  There was a performance in the middle of the street and the tables were outside over looking the street of TIVOLI VILLAGE . overall, i enjoyed it and i loved their coffee(:",UNK
8406,"I had the catfish and okra it was cooked to perfection light crisp batter, My wife had the cod and french fries it was also cooked perfect not greasy and not a heavy batter we had the two piece fish which also came with 3 shrimp \nwe will be back",UNK
8407,"I tried their food once...terrible!  I love their chinese food from China A gogo, so figured this might be decent...not even close to my other regular haunts such as Ohana Hawaiian BBQ and Aloha Island grill on MD Pkwy and the one on Sahara.",UNK
8408,WOW!  What a great little store in Chandler.  I fell inspired every time I leave the shop. LOVE the employees because they're so helpful. I took a class and the instructors were great. Green Table Gift store is a must see for anyone who really enjoys adorable gift ideas.,UNK
8409,This hotel is terrible! The beds are uncomfortable. The pillows are uncomfortable. You can hear everything that is going on outside of the window and door.,UNK
8410,"Worst service ever!  They are slow for everything drinks, food, etc.  When you do finally get your food it is cold! Need new servers and new management.  NEVER going again. Poor poor poor.",UNK
8411,"my wife and i went on a saturday afternoon . the place was busy,( always a good sign). The pho I got was good and flavorful But i think that the sandwitches are are the best! yum! Im there for the sandwitches",UNK
8412,"First visit today for a nice fill in on a bad acrylic job from another uptown nail salon.  It was quick, peaceful, and friendly and my nails look great.  There are plenty of magazines now.   I'll definitely be back - it's a nice escape from my office.",UNK
8413,"Was there for my bachelor party back in 2008, ok food, they were 45 minutes late in seating us.  They also pushed 2 round tables together which made people have to sit in a gap.  I had fun just because I got drunk but otherwise this place sucked. I hope that since then FIX got fixed.",UNK
8414,"If they charge $11 for a tiny glass of friggin' Cadillac they'd better make it right. Boy, this place sucks. That is why I live in LA!",UNK
8415,No. \n\nSteak is not great. \n\nService is. That's the only thing that saved this review.,UNK
8416,"Table was dirty and sticky\nThe waitress took forever to get our drinks, salsa was ok . Really bad service  and my fajitas were overcook.\nWe are never coming back!!",UNK
8417,"Realllllly good med food ! The chicken shawarma is good, and the veg medley is too !  I like the hummus also.",UNK
8418,"Food is good to the tummy. To me this is better than in and out burger. Place is spotless,  friendly service, and wide selection.",UNK
8419,Food is good but the wait for take out is always between 45 minutes to 1 hour. I might have to find some other place cuz this is the third time and I don't think 3rd time was the charm.,UNK
8420,"I didn't know Slice of Vegas has the largest vegan friendly menu in town! The food is scrumptious, vegan cheesecake is a fantastic dessert and the staff is the coolest!!!  Love it",UNK
8421,"Dive bar.. Enough said.. dirty and lacking direction, seems like just a place to get drunk and scream at the games on TV... Boring, wont be back.. slso, what is the strange smell in this place?",UNK
8422,I've had several different Korean BBQs. I wasn't feeling this one. The table we had had poor ventilation and I got smoked out and I got so hot I didn't feel like eating. That and none of the food really had any flavor to speak of. There are better options in the area.,UNK
8423,"First time here. Stopped here early morn(6am) for a trip from California to Colorado .. Good food, quick service and a very friendly staff.",UNK
8424,Are you kidding me?  I was disappointed after seeing all the good reviews. It is fast food BBQ. If you want a McRib and McDonalds is not Serving them go here. Do not go here if you want real BBQ. This place sucks!,UNK
8425,"Cold Miso Soup, Horrible Service and this is not REAL Sushi Rice.\n\nCome On, it's not that difficult to Provide Quality Food and Service,",UNK
8426,"Clean and very comfortable. We were upgraded to a suite, which was very nice. \nThe gym was good too. Very clean, tons of towels,  lemon ice water. Too bad it was raining so we couldn't use the pool. \nOverall, clean and comfortable. Definitely recommended",UNK
8427,"Going into it, I did have high expectations based on the ratings and reviews I had seen.  My husband and I got cookie dough and cookies & cream.  We both left completely unimpressed with at taste of sour milk in our mouth.  Maybe we just got a bad batch?  I don't think we will be going back again anytime soon.",UNK
8428,"I had one of the best service experiences dining at Juan Jaime's tonight.  Adam, the bartender, was attentive and fun while waiting for my take out order.  The food is fantastic, but moreover the service was spot on.  Adam nailed it.",UNK
8429,Super authentic. Fast service. House special soup is a great value. The house chicken plater is really good. Beef and scallion is also money. They also have fresh live seafood tanks. Good prices.,UNK
8430,"The food here is pretty food, but the pricing can be a little too much sometimes.  The service at the location is fair and the restaurant is one I'll be returning to in the near future.",UNK
8431,When I'm hungry for Italian...\n\n... I see the Martorano's billboard and lose my appetite.,UNK
8432,The Pickle Juice with the Margarita flavors goes well together.\n\nTry the red velvet! ...And dont forget to get a punch card. Buy 9 (any size) and you get a LARGE one for FREE!,UNK
8433,"Since are restaurant selections back home are limited, we thought we'd try something new.  This place was a short distance from the hotel.  This was another hit.  The food, price, and service was excellent.  The next trip to Charlotte, this will be a go to place.  The four of us loved it!",UNK
8434,"I used to win here all the time, but we haven't hit much in the past 6 months. However, the staff is so fun and attentive that we'll always come back. Nothing beats coming into a bar and having \""your drink\"" ready once they see you.  And the food...AMAZING!",UNK
8435,I like lvac and all but this location is terrible and the streets leading up have very limited access. This location also seems very closed off where as the rainbow location feels more open. So I will probably not go to this location too often. It is deff not my club of choice.,UNK
8436,"SUPER slow service.  My quick dinner lasted about and hour and fifteen minutes.  Portions are good, and food was good,  service left something to be desired.  The server actually told us he had a bigger table than us so he was paying more attention to them.",UNK
8437,In town for one night and tried to find the best Italian food possible.  I found it!  Just back from Italy for a week and didn't notice a difference.  I wish I could give it 10 stars!  I'll be back every chance I get.,UNK
8438,The service was unorganized and the hostess was rude. We karaoke'd with friends and the DJ playing the music was also rude. We won't be going back.,UNK
8439,Great place with great owners! The smoothies are so much better than Jamba juice! Give it a try you won't be sorry!,UNK
8440,Love the music here on a Thursday!\n\nAll about the Hip Hop!!\n\nCant wait to dance here again.,UNK
8441,"Excellent Coffee. Fun atmosphere, Loving Staff. Great Coffee and tea drinks.\nFantastically talented musicians appear here on friday and saturday nights. \nWhat's great is the level of hospitality and the warm people. \nIt's become my home away from home.\nMichael.",UNK
8442,More style than substance.  The garage motif is done in such an adorable way that makes this a great space to hang out.  But coffee is just okay.,UNK
8443,"This place is a staple for when my preschooler needs to let out some energy and we're all hungry. Food is always fresh, service is always outstanding.",UNK
8444,"Want to pay a lot of money ($60) for a mediocre lunch for two? This is your place. As an added bonus you get really loud music, plastic cups for your drinks and you have to pay for chips and salsa. Keep walking, even if you are tired and hungry like we were.",UNK
8445,"While visiting Lee's last night for a post dinner sweet treat, I discovered that they provide free toppings and cones! The topping options are heath bar crunch and other chocolatey treats and the waffles are waffle cone squares that provide the perfect crunch to the Jack Daniels chocolate! Meow that's what I call a sweet find!",UNK
8446,"Long lines, jacked up prices, but it's the airport.\n\nI've never been given an incorrect coffee, my drinks have always come out great. There are better Starbucks in McCarran, but if you need a coffee fix this one will do just fine.",UNK
8447,"Westgate has a few more restaurants now but stil need more shops for shopping to come along.  It is starting to build up but slowly.  It was nice to walk around from dinner, but the amount of teenage kids there were a little annoying.  Guess I am not the mommy type!",UNK
8448,This place is tight!!! Saw all the stuff from the show. Even met Chum Lee. The majority of items that were on the show are expensive. But def worth checking out if your ever visiting Vegas.,UNK
8449,"Long lines, rude service and prices that are \""adjusted\"" for tourists. Come on Mcdonalds! You can do better than this lame excuse. If you want to get ripped off go to this Mcdonalds.. otherwise there are better options near the strip",UNK
8450,"Food is pretty good, but unless you're prepared to wait minimum 45 minutes (even if it's just you), don't come here. \nI've tried all different days and times and still there's always an obnoxious wait.",UNK
8451,ya not so much the lattes we ordered were probley the worst i have had to date tasted like warm milk . the breakfast was ok but served room temp . the employs all lacked personality.prices $$$,UNK
8452,Worst service u can ever imagine and what type of Mexican restaurant can't make guacamole because they ran out of tomatos?!?,UNK
8453,"Very odd admissions policy. Stood in line forever, willing to pay whatever and didn't get in. I think they don't like money.",UNK
8454,"This is by far my favorite thrift store. I've stumbled upon so many awesome things while shopping here, my only complaint is that if the price-tag falls off one of your items they won't reprice it that day, but instead tell you to come back another day. Oh well, I'll still be back.",UNK
8455,"As a rule I will never give a Starbucks more than 3 stars because it's a chain. But this one is pretty good, the line is never long and it is not terribly loud like so many others.",UNK
8456,"Great dancing, love the skits too. If they had more battles i would have given a 5! It was too short. Nice show and you will be close to the stage.",UNK
8457,"So good!  Fresh, flavorful and fast.  Completely customizable and great price too.  I usually get a wrap, but, the bowls are calling my name for next time...",UNK
8458,"Def had better. Seems they cater to the locals...had high hopes and totally disapointed. Went for the meat dishes, not sure how the vegetarian plates are.",UNK
8459,"Pretty good place.  You never actually know who is your server because several different people actually wait on you.  The service can be slow at times which can get annoying.  The space is pretty big, bigger than what it seems from the street.  The food was so-so.",UNK
8460,"The burger is greasy, service was okay, burger had good flavor though. A little pricey for the whole meal. Not sure if I'd frequent. Create down the street definitely a better value.",UNK
8461,"I was in Charlotte to scope out the city to see if I like it. Well long story short, this place doesn't exist so don't waste your time. Neighborhood is pretty artsy though, so you're still in a good place to discover other shops",UNK
8462,We order allot of pizza from Marco's and there's a reason why. The white chessey is my favorite and all others are great! I've never stepped foot inside the place so this is strictly on a food basis.,UNK
8463,"Good happy hour drinks, great service, but mediocre food. We had the fish and chips, they were very greasy and kind of bland. I also had the vegetable soup to start with and was so oily, that I could not eat it.",UNK
8464,"Not impressed. Took forever to find and was basically like a Mod pizza restaurant. And they didn't have any gluten free crust, which is why we sought them out. Disappointed.",UNK
8465,A must-visit for my family when we visit Vegas. Owner and staff are very friendly. We had a steamed fish that was absolutely delicious. Their rice cooked in a hot pot is also another dish we order again and again.,UNK
8466,The Geisha House has the best Happy Hour in Las Vegas if u r a fan of sushi..... Ryan is the best bartender that a person can ask for.,UNK
8467,The hana dog was so colorful and delicious and the tater tots were awesome too. They let us try spam sliders and believe it or not it was pretty tasty and it was my first spam experience of my life. I will definitely go back for more yumminess.,UNK
8468,Sucks. Not fresh.!!.not Japanese style at all. super Slow !! Waitress are like sleeping.. chefs are playing....,UNK
8469,"When you walk in it smells dirty, looks dirty and old. The food is \""OK\"". For the dim sum aficionados it might be good, but I won't go again just because of how dirty it looks. If the outside feels looks run down, I can't imagine the kitchen.",UNK
8470,"This restaurant is expensive but definitely worth it for a special occasion. Great appetizers and entrees. The mixed drinks are incredible - try the saki lemon drop martini, it's amazing. \nThe service is great. The food is great. For celebrations, my first thought is always destihl.",UNK
8471,"It's fairly cheap as far as strip hotels are concerned, in my mind that's the only reason to stay there. I reserved a pyramid king room and they gave me a tower. Eh. The room was ok, no view at all though.",UNK
8472,"Over priced, low quality food.\nI will not be visiting a Firehouse Subs location again as long as there is a Subway or Quizno's close by.\nFrankly, I'd rather get something from the grocery store deli counter.",UNK
8473,This was my second time going to this and gotta say all the food was only okay. I still had a great breakfast and good service provided with good selection but wasn't as good as my first time here years ago. I was bummed they don't have king crab claws anymore :(,UNK
8474,"It's a Walmart not unlike any other I have been to across this great country. It isn't terribly messy as others have been. The staff, though not more knowledgeable than at other stores, are a bit nicer.",UNK
8475,"SMALL, sticky, hot, 2 tiny kiddy pools, OVER-priced 50 girls to 1 guy. Not my thing at all.",UNK
8476,Holy crap this mountain is rough. Made it to the top but now gotta go down. Don't need jabz leg class today,UNK
8477,Breakfast is GREAT!!!  Pancakes and French Toast AMAZING !! Service is GREAT.. Im going up in a week,UNK
8478,I alway love their service and food.  We came with a large group and they service was on point and great.  Our order came our correct and the quality was great.,UNK
8479,The best chicken fried steak in town.  I did try there burger n sirloin steak and wasn't pleased with lunch menu. But if you want a dam good breakfast this is the place to go. Don't forget the fresh squeezed O.j.. ..,UNK
8480,"Ugh.  About every 3-4 years I somehow end up wanting to see if Taco Bell is still awful, and try it again.  Yup, still awful.  Tried a couple of the newer menu items, which of course taste exactly like all the other menu items.  I don't know why I keep thinking they may have changed.",UNK
8481,Update to my previous entry... My go to cupcake is the Brown Velvet! No artificial colors nor preservatives and it tastes uh mazing. They have added a lemon cookie and brownies. You just can't go wrong with Urban Cookies!!!,UNK
8482,The hotel was perfect for what we needed. Great location close to campus and not far from NODA. Great price.  Outdated rooms but can't complain for price. Foyer seemed updated. Only 2 complaints are that the hotel is difficult to get too. They could use more signage and the elevators (2 of them) are extremely slow.,UNK
8483,"I'm really picky with a place that mixes Chinese with Thai. Their pad thai doesn't cut it for me, but their Pad See Ew is as legit as the best Thai places. Therefore I like this place. You might have to do some hit or miss tests before you find what suits you.",UNK
8484,"The coffee is really good. They have a nice patio. This seems to be the coffee place in the Mile End where all the cool kids hang out, but there is also a nice mix of neighborhood folks. A great coffee shop in the neighborhood. I recommend it.",UNK
8485,The best restuarant in the Valley.  I love everything I've had there and have never been disappointed.  Sue the owner walks around and talks to the people.  Our favorite waitress is Annie.  She is superb.. We go there at least one a month.,UNK
8486,"Their Mexican Mocha is my ideal coffee! Service is friendly, and I have to admit that I do love the chocolate covered espresso bean.",UNK
8487,"We lived in Augsburg for 2+ years (near Munich) and got to the 'real' Hofbrauhaus more than a few times. The Vegas version is near perfect in every way. Food, atmosphere, service, entertainment - GREAT!",UNK
8488,"I love, love, love coming here to The Grand Canal Shoppes. Of course there are some shops that are pricey however the canal and the ambiance makes me feel like I'm in Italy. I love just walking through, so pretty!",UNK
8489,"If you love Pinball machines, especially the ones from yester-year, do yourself a favor and stop by the Pinball Hall of Fame.  I'm glad we stopped by here.  Some good (and cheap) fun in Vegas.",UNK
8490,Love the staff the eggs and bacon were perfect. This is the type of place I'd recommend to bring a family to eat at. I am giving it a 5 great experience.,UNK
8491,"The food is more sophisticated than other buffets, but it comes at a price.  It was about $40 pp on a Sunday evening which didn't come with champagne.  The crab legs were so-so and very salty, and the lamb was dry.  The side dishes were creative though.",UNK
8492,"There are a lot of gorgeous dining rooms in Las Vegas, but none more dramatic than Alex. Want to impress a date? Take her (him) here, get the tasting menu, and let Paolo the Master Sommelier pair wines. If that doesn't get you a 'yes,' give up.",UNK
8493,This place was pretty nice. Burgers were delicous. I was disappointed that the ice cream was too sweet and I loooove overly sweet things. Probably will go back but mainly for the burgers... if you want frozen yogurt I would suggest a different place.,UNK
8494,"It was totally empty when we walked in and empty when we left on a Saturday night, not a good sign.   It was ok, not great, but ok for the quick Asian fix. I am looking for a Chinese place that will remind me of back home sweet Chicago. Also want one that will deliver to the Gilbert area.",UNK
8495,"This place was terrible. I don't even know how I got roped into going in here. If I would have know what it is in there, I would have turned around. Lame place.",UNK
8496,"Ya there's nothing like a stroll through this capitalist antfarm to make me fear for the future of humanity.\n\nIf you're looking for a WWJD-embroidered snuggie, tho, they probably have it.",UNK
8497,"Very good shopping experience, good prices - even better with sale prices, but today stock was too low, esp in HeaLth & Beauty Dept. Emps are helpful in locating items & lots of checkout stands open.\nParking is plentiful & close!",UNK
8498,"What a great place to spend an hour just day dreaming. They have RC Planes,Boats,cars,trucks, trainsand everything RC plus they help you work on your stuff and usually people are gathered outside toying around with their RC toy. So few of these model & Hobby store around anymore we are blessed to have 2 in the neighborhood.",UNK
8499,Server was polite. Food was marginal and took waaay too long to come out. Beer selection very limited. The only thing that kept a smile on my face was watching ppl fall off of the mechanical bull.,UNK
8500,"best prime rib in town. 20 bucks for a 22 ounce behemoth, house salad and potato. Add a glass of Cab and im in business.",UNK
8501,The food is simply amazing. A new spot that should not be missed by anyone who appreciates good food.\nI signed up on yelp just to be able to review them.,UNK
8502,"Dirty. Greasy. I got sick. There are so many better options available in Squirrel Hill, so don't even bother going here.",UNK
8503,I had a vegetarian sandwich with fresh avocado. And a decent amount!   Loved the bread. Definitely home made. Had a side salad that was substantial. Wait staff friendly. I will Return!,UNK
8504,"Horrible customer service. Wouldn't return an item 2 minutes after it was purchased. Was sold an incorrect replacement piece, then told all sales were final when I walked back in from the parking lot. I hope this $50 mistake helps someone else.",UNK
8505,The place gets pretty crowded. The people working there were friendly. I tried one of their favorites - Picnic with sweet potato salad. The sandwich was very good. The salad on the other hand was simply too salty to go with the sandwich.,UNK
8506,"This bar is really fun to go to if you want to play darts or chat with the friendly bartenders.  The drinks are cheap.  It's a smaller place and a little dark, but that's okay since it's a little dive bar.  I always have a good time whenever I go here.",UNK
8507,I have been with America First Credit Union since 1993 I believe they were Network Credit Union back then. I now use the Las Vegas Shadow Creek Smith's Branch They are the  Best and always helpful with all my banking needs. A-1 Operation.I wish I could give them 10 no 1000 stars.,UNK
8508,Friendly staff. Rooms need a little TLC though. Wall paper was peeling and table had sticky stuff on it. Beds seem comfortable enough.,UNK
8509,Hostesses were horrible and the manager.\nHostesses reached over table to pass notes while we were eating and didn't apologize.  Manager came over and excused service saying they were overwhelmed.  I was taught by the age of 4 not to reach over someone's food while they are eating.  No excuse,UNK
8510,"Lots of hype for nothing. I've had better waffles, chicken, grits, etc. elsewhere. The service and staff there were upbeat and fun. I'm glad I didn't have to wait. If you want to try it, go early for breakfast.",UNK
8511,Don't need to show diamonds in the rough proof of vaccinations for them to groom your pet. You still need to Vaccinate your pet but proof is not required like some other pet stores.,UNK
8512,"HUsband is from South India and this is where he goes for Authentic South Indian Food. No doubt very nice place, good food and good service.",UNK
8513,I like this place much better then the one across the street. I had a 45 minute massage and about 38 of it was on my feet which is what I wanted. At the end she did a good neck shoulder back massage to finish. Great prices and easy to get in at least during the day.,UNK
8514,"Second time here for brunch. Positively delicious. Roasted cauliflower soup. Tuna focaccia panini and French press coffee. All nicely presented by sweet, fresh faced servers.",UNK
8515,"It was soooo good! I don't like Asian food, and I am not a big fan of spring rolls. BUT this place has the best! A friend years ago told me to try it and I didn't until today. I wish I would have gone before!!",UNK
8516,"Best burger ever. I had the Pork Belly burger. My wife had the guacamole burger. The boys had kids burger, Western, Bang Bang. 5 smiles. Winner. But mine was the best. :)",UNK
8517,"Well stocked, clean but the floor staff wasn't very helpful or friendly. Only 1 out of\nMaybe 3 asked me if I needed help when I obviously did. The cashier was very nice and talkative but their registers were making all kinds of racket for some reason.",UNK
8518,"Great lunch specials! $6 for chicken, beef or pork and $7 for shrimp. Comes with soup, egg roll and angel blossom.",UNK
8519,"Miller's Has the best marinated chicken fingers called \""zingers\"" try the sweet Thai chili yummy. Ton's of TV's  like 40 something beers on tap. This place is the \""poster boy\"" of a sports bar/ resturant",UNK
8520,It was my first time visiting this theatre. The line was long but fast. The seating was comfortable with cup holders which is very convenient. The sound and the picture was very good.,UNK
8521,Went last night for a late dinner around 10pm. The service and ambiance were great. I loved the entertainment. The food was pretty good except for my lamb. I ordered it medium rare and it came out well done. It was the worst lamb I ever had.,UNK
8522,"The food and service at Ann's is great, it just happens to be located in a ghost town! We enjoyed our meal and the atmosphere. Hopefully the secret of Ann's will spread and help breathe some life into their little shopping center.",UNK
8523,"Wonderful food!  We did take out. The food was fresh, hot and exactly the correct level of spice. The summer rolls were amazing!",UNK
8524,"This is a good Starbucks if you don't want to have to walk in! You can either walk up or drive through, i'd rather just drive up and go.",UNK
8525,I'm on a fan of the salad. I have been here twice and everything else is so so. Great wine list and place to start off to have cocktails before heading out.,UNK
8526,"I enjoy the food here greatly - wings, tot-chos, and a good beer selection. The service can be severely hit or miss. Expect the worst and be happy if it's any better.",UNK
8527,"We took the lightrail to the airport, it was great!  $1.75 pp, compared to $25 parking per day!  It tooks us about an hour, we left around 11:00am, made it to the stop, a bus was waiting, and took us to our terminal.  Easy-Pleasy!!",UNK
8528,"Dude, this place ain't half bad and I didn't even have the munchies!  You don't have to be stoned here to enjoy the food.\n\nA variety of sandwiches and such served up with a smile and a side of chips or something.  Doritos anyone?",UNK
8529,"Went out as a family and spent $100 with no alcohol on overpriced, small potions of bland tasting food. I'm not much of a fan of Fox restaurants, and will not come back. Our service was poor until I asked the manager.  To their credit, our waiter picked up his service considerably.",UNK
8530,"Nice location, good ambience, willing server but uncooked sea bass.  Enough said.  We won't be back.  The chef let them down and neither our server nor the manager was surprised.  Guess this happens frequently.",UNK
8531,Exploring this old downtown area I was not expecting to find this!  Cool Comic Book store!  The owner was very friendly and knowledgeable!,UNK
8532,"Lets talk about popcorn.  The worst popcorn is served here.  The amer..Dental Association must give them money to serve this popcorn.  Cinemark popcorn is really good. Only one cashier to sell tickets, 7 people serving food.  The lines were very long on Tuesday.  The theatres are fine.",UNK
8533,"Food was great service was horrible. .. Waitress \""C\"" was just slacking. .. food served not correctly. .. food all over her uniform ... no utensils. . At least food was good",UNK
8534,"Carefree Resort...not my choice.  I can \""care less\"" about this place.  Rooms smell like a sewer and the employees are not friendly.  I hope I won't be returning!",UNK
8535,"Yummy green chili chicken enchiladas breakfast!  Its all outdoors, which could be less than awesome on some AZ days, but it was cool when we went and they had heaters that made it perfectly comfy.",UNK
8536,"When the rates are resonable definitely worth a look.  The place has recently been remodeled and everything in my room seemed new. Had an LCD TV (not that I watched much TV, but still nice). Right on the strip, free parking.",UNK
8537,I love this pizza! Did the thin crust. Nom! Nom! The calamari was light and made in-house. SE Valley has a real pizza place.,UNK
8538,"Had a wonderful experience. The staff is very friendly and makes you feel at home. I've had my eyebrows done before and always cried cause of the pain. Here, They were extremely gentle and careful; even gave me some advice for the in between care. I highly recommend this place!",UNK
8539,Not too shabby lunch deals. NOT DOS GRINGOS ANYMORE.  NOW CALLED ROCKY POINT CANTINA. I dug it. $2 coronas and tacos. looks really cool inside.,UNK
8540,"Went there yesterday they were very busy, but they got my car done really fast. All the staff was friendly and nice. I would recommend this place to my friends. They even took the time to get a dime that fell in my seat belt lock at no extra charge.",UNK
8541,"Great food...get in there and work those crabs! They have specials that get broadcasted via facebook, down-right Maryland roots....crabs and football!",UNK
8542,"This place was amazing! Everything I tried was awesome, service was the best. Out of everything I tried the escargot impressed me the most. I would defiantly be coming back here!",UNK
8543,"Went in for a early breakfast t opening,  we were seated right away. I  ordered a bacon & swiss omlette. It was a standard well cooked omlette, could have used a little salt/peper. But over all a good well serviced meal. I would go back to try other dishes.",UNK
8544,Love Love Love...........nom nom only one little hiccup.......the shakes were very foamy.....not thick and creamy like other in n outs .......,UNK
8545,"The gardens are very pretty.  However, if you are male and under the age of 65, you will likely be bored senseless after about 10 minutes.",UNK
8546,"I Revently stayed at the springhill motel. The asst. G.m. and his staff seemed to lack experience to say the least.I travel to the Phoenix area alot.This was the worst stay ever, anywhere.",UNK
8547,They are really busy Saturday mornings but its my absolute favorite place to get bagels right now. The pretzel bagel toasted with plain cream cheese and a green tea is my favorite combo.,UNK
8548,"No idea this place existed even though I drive by this part of Scottsdale often, I had the Burmese gai, which was super spicy and super yummy. It would've been nice if it had more veggies in it, but good still. Boyfriends meal was ok, nothing to rave about.",UNK
8549,"Staff is really friendly and the food is good, but standard, Mexican food. The drink specials are probably the best in Charlotte.  A 14oz frozen Margarita for $3 and a 22oz Dos Equis draft for $2.75 is pretty unbeatable.",UNK
8550,The only complaints I have are that this place smells bad and the service is shitty. Otherwise it's not too bad for a renovated motel 6 or whatever it was before.,UNK
8551,"Don't go, called in advance to set an appointment at 1:30, showed up having to wait damn near an hour and ended up leaving and not getting anything done. Oh and along with other customers that decided to leave as well.",UNK
8552,Amazing incredible awesome best eggplant ever! I always order for pick up and it's never taken more then 20 mins for them to finish the order. Highly recommended.,UNK
8553,"Really loved Ishi when they were at the old location, because it was cozy and always full. Since they moved they have a bigger place, had to cut costs on certain items but the sushi and hibachi is good and not too expensive. Saki bombs are cun there!",UNK
8554,"Had the store manager pack and ship a package for me, and even bought insurance at his suggestion. But when the package arrived damaged, the owner gave me the run around after days of haggling on the phone.  Don't use these guys if you care about your packages.",UNK
8555,It's the ghetto version of pei Wei.  It's really cheap but nothing to be excited .\nI had higher expectation because the owner  also ones Saigon in chandler.  \nI wish the food is more authentic like Saigon.,UNK
8556,"*for the timeshare presentation\n\nWe knew we'd have to sit through a sales pitch, but not for FIVE hours! Missed our dinner reservations as well as the discounted show they promised us. Total scam.",UNK
8557,"Buffet only review.   Horrible food.  Really dreadful.  It gets 2 stars because the place was acceptably clean, and it was cheap.  The casino is similar to other Station casinos around town, but parking and way finding here is not quite as good as Fiesta or Texas Stations, which are similarly suburban locations.",UNK
8558,"I am thrilled Olive & Ivy is in the airport.  Delicious breakfasts, friendly staff, and good coffee drinks.  Beats the hell out of Burger King.  That stuff will kill ya.",UNK
8559,"The location of this place is pretty unfortunate (in the ghost town that is City North).  And I might be spoiled by other yogurt shops, but the variety seemed to be lacking.  The saving grace would have to be the 1/2 price Tuesday Twitter word of the day!",UNK
8560,"well its like this....very incredibly hokey, but really cool. I could picture this in pigeon forge or branson but it really is worth seeing. Pizza is OK (nothing Special) salad bar and Ice cream are also available...Amazing Pipe Organ+++ lots of extras...we drank several pitchers of beer",UNK
8561,"Beautiful ambience, tasty, traditional coffee, and kind, helpful service. Modern-style coffee house with a gorgeous view. Great hot chocolate, pleasant cashier woman, and robust, rich roast. Great experience at Mtn. View Coffee!",UNK
8562,"If this is a great Supermarche I can't imagine what any of the reviewers would say about a Whole Foods or even a Safeway.  'Mecca', 'House of Religious Worship', 'Taj Majal of grocery shopping', and 'Rapture' come to mind.",UNK
8563,There steaks are amazing and for the price even more amazing. I've been to a few good spots here but this is the spot for now:) place is a bit dark at night if I have to say something negative.,UNK
8564,"While the design and decoration is stunning, the lack of customer service is as stunning for a five star hotel. Every staff member I came into contact with was rude, curt and just plain unfriendly. I work in HR and seeing this type of behavior makes me think it comes from the top.",UNK
8565,Reminds me so much of back home in Chicago. The have the best Chicago style food in Vegas. The restaurant is really nice inside. The staff is nice. I was in the area the other day and had to go in even tho I just had a bite. Cause I knew I would want some later.,UNK
8566,The food here is on point! Also the service that we got from Amanda was incredible! I had the bacon and sliced avocado omelette which was the best omelette I've ever had. Check this place out!,UNK
8567,"I think my car was cleaner before the full service wash. The inside of my car was hardly touched. They did a poor job drying it off. So, I a was left with water spots all over. Not worth the money at all.",UNK
8568,"Well I would recommend not eating there, drink are great. My enchiladas were cold, the cheese wasn't melted, the fish tacos weren't good.",UNK
8569,"I just done happy feet pedicure ( Nu Pedicure) today with Candy so amazing, it's make my feet so smooth and it has hot stone massage so relaxing. i love it.",UNK
8570,"I honestly don't know what it is about this place. We stopped in for a drink and to catch some of the AFC Championship game and it was pretty dead, but the vibe was just weird. Pretty unfriendly, not welcoming idk - maybe its just not my kind of place.",UNK
8571,"The food was decent, the portions are miniature. The only reason we ate here was because when we just checked in at the Palazzo, the restaurant was right there. \n\nDon't waste a meal here if you're visiting but if you are starved like I was, the Shanghai Rice Cakes are good.",UNK
8572,Wow food there is amazing. I went with a local vegas friend and man we ordered way to much food but it was sooooooooooo good. I love eating thai food and this place is authentic.,UNK
8573,"The BEST fried calamari I have ever had!\nAfter 50+ years on this planet, I finally found a place that makes fried calamari without it being rubbery.\n\nGreat atmosphere. Wonderful food.  Must check it out!  AAA+++",UNK
8574,Been to La Comida and 2 out of 3 experiences weren't good. First time I went it was right after it open and it was good then last two experiences were not good.\n\nIt turned out to be nothing extraordinary. Their food and service was average and nothing stood out.,UNK
8575,"Good full bar, friendly bartenders, friendly staff. Food looked good what ppl was eating. Looks like the fish and chips are a hit there.",UNK
8576,"If you want to be yelled at, rude to, and just plain insulted. Go here!\n The owner of this pizzeria does not have customer service skills. \n\nThe pizza is pretty good.",UNK
8577,"The hookah flavor is good, but...more expensive, \""special\"" is a higher price,  they force you to buy beverages or food per person!  charge a high service tax, and close earlier.",UNK
8578,"It's pretty boring...\n\nAnd they have technical difficulties all the time.\n\nIf you do watch it though, watching from across the street is pretty good, because you can take it all in at once. Just use a camera with good zoom if you're filming. ;)",UNK
8579,"Sandwich was good, but the fries were horrible! There are so many good places to get a quick bite to eat in Vegas, I would skip this as a meal place. Did not have dessert, but those looked pretty good.",UNK
8580,I do not know how this place stays in business.  Drive thru orders are never right and service is just bad.  I mean real bad.  I can only guess that it has to stem from management because the service is bad no matter what day you go there.,UNK
8581,We went here because of the high yelp reviews. It was disappointingly mediocre. I left kindof nauseous.,UNK
8582,Seafood lunch red curry plate.  Awesome. Tiny little place but clean and comfortable atmosphere.  As soon as I walked in I smelled good food!  They have free wifi and waitress was really nice!,UNK
8583,Atmosphere a 2 out of 5 and there beer own beer on tap not many choices so it's a 2 service is 3.,UNK
8584,This is the worst Starbucks I have ever been to. The last two times I have been here there has been 2 employees and about 5 people in line and 10 waiting for drinks. It's really sad to have such a bad experience multiple times.,UNK
8585,"Spur-of-the-moment pick for supper on a Saturday night. Not too crowded, really great service. Good food, serving size left us pretty stuffed! Looking forward to going back to try the rest of the dishes.",UNK
8586,"It's pretty good, often times you'll get a coupon for 50% off your meal if you come back the following monday.  Only complaint is they can be on the slow side with everything.. drink, food, bringing the bill, etc.  Nice staff though.",UNK
8587,"Good Thai cuisine, a little more than I like to spend at lunch time but I always have left overs for my next meal!  Seems very authentic.  Very clean place and friendly staff.",UNK
8588,"It was just OK. I would have expected a little bit more Mickey with a Las Vegas flair, but the store is really just an outlet for old inventory from the theme parks. There are a few things with decent prices (very few), but I thought most of it was overpriced considering its history. Nice employees though.",UNK
8589,"This is the first place I've ever gone to receive a foot massage. However, I was completely surprised that for just $20 you actually a full body massage for a whole hour. I always leave feeling super relaxed and they really do a great job working on my back and neck. They get pretty busy now so I would definitely recommend making an appointment.",UNK
8590,"Unique food - I had the Chop Salad, Short Ribs & took home some of the Bacon Peanut Brittle to try later. Each of the dishes were unique but very tasty.",UNK
8591,It is pretty good place to get boba. The snow ice is good and sweet. Only problem i have with this place  is that the service is not that great. I keep coming back because the boba is good.,UNK
8592,"I love this place. The menu was thick with a lot of choices. No matter their class  dishes or bakery, everything was yummy.",UNK
8593,"Yes, the waffle was soft and sweet, the toppings were yummy--but the dirty feel of the place and apathy of the young man waiting on us makes me not want to go back.  No customer service at all.  Hate to say it, but that's what really sealed the deal for me.  Blah!",UNK
8594,Wow Ghada is amazing! I have really thick hair and no one in Arizona can do my hair like her! She is now my hairstylist my moms hairstylist my aunts hairstylist my best friends hair stylist and other friends,UNK
8595,"Very average.\n\nIf I'm paying $70 for a 10 oz filet and $90 for a $25 bottle of wine, it better be the nicest place in town and the food should be fantastic.  I didn't have either at Strip Steak.  Not worth the money in my opinion.",UNK
8596,One if the best sushi places in champaign. We usually go there every 2 week and it is amazing. They have outside dinning over the summer and the inside ambiance is also perfect.,UNK
8597,This place is really authentic Chinese style. Strongly recommended for people who love Chinese cuisine. They even have hot pot from Mon-Thur. Will try next time,UNK
8598,"Not worth the price ( $75 pp + tax ).  The selection of food was vast, but the quality of food was poor and full of MSG. The best part was the desserts, the only reason I'm giving it 2 stars and not 1.",UNK
8599,"This is an OK coffee shop if you happen to be at the Orleans.  It is the only place in e casino with free wifi.  I would give it another star if it was not in the Orleans.\n\nMy cafe mocha tasted like hot chocolate one day, hopefully an exception and not the norm.",UNK
8600,"We love this little restaurant.  Found it when it had just opened, and try to get back often.  The food is excellent and the folks that own the place are delightful.\nWe would highly recommend.",UNK
8601,Love this place.  It has a great vibe and excellent food.  The dogs are served in a pita instead of a boring bun.  The prices are fair.  The place is spotless.,UNK
8602,I enjoyed the vegetarian pho.  I didn't love sitting at the community table but it was an experience.  Great service!,UNK
8603,"My husband and I shared a chocolate peanut butter frozen hot chocolate.  We ordered from the take-out window and enjoyed our treat while sitting outside and people watching at Ceasers. It was tasty but a little pricey for what it was, a somewhat less creamy chocolate peanut butter milkshake.",UNK
8604,"Really good food. Ate there after running 13 miles for a spartan race,  and had awesome food and sides. The mac and cheese was definitely to die for. That and the beef brisket were so good. The staff were very friendly,  and the food came out very fast. Good place for quick eats.",UNK
8605,Was not welcoming...\nFifteen min for a coffee...\nNot a great value...,UNK
8606,Stopped at this vintage A&W restaurant on the way back from Las Vegas last weekend for a nice cool refreshing treat.  We both had the classic rootbeer float.  It was delicious and brough back such great memories as a child.  Only used the drive-through so cannot comment on anything else.,UNK
8607,Their fried rice probably gets five stars (they actually make the best fried brown rice I've ever had); their Korean specialties aren't bad; skip everything else.,UNK
8608,"Delicious food and big portions. Delicious handmade tortillas.  Free chips and sala. Plan on coming back again. Tequila, beer, micheladas and music (not too loud) just enough for a happy atmosphere.",UNK
8609,"So clean and so organized, this is the place to go for some fro yo fun!  This is the place to enjoy some great tasting flavors and enjoy all of the delicious toppings.  Friendly staff and I am going to return again and again...",UNK
8610,"First visit to the new Hickory Tavern since they moved to this location.  The atmosphere is much more hip as apposed to bar-fly-ish as it had been.  Very impressed with the ample menu and, of course the HUGE beer selection!",UNK
8611,Great food.  Good service.  Fun atmosphere to eat in.  With all the other good reviews on this place not much more to say.  Give it a try if you are in the area.  If you are a fan of Italian beef dipped sandwiches you will not be disappointed.,UNK
8612,"Just grabbed some quick drinks.\nGood selection of drinks, friendly staff, cool old house.\nIt was a nice place to kick back on the patio with a cold one.",UNK
8613,"Good pizza, but VERY limited seating.  Good luck trying to get a  table a busy times in the airport.\n\nOtherwise, every bit as good an airport pizza has a right to be...  ;)",UNK
8614,Super yummy !!  Started with \u00e9touff\u00e9e.  Now I try the wings and the barbecue pork sliders.,UNK
8615,good place to go out for late dinner.  Open till 3:00 AM.  Price little bit expensive than what I usually pay for Com thit nuong.,UNK
8616,Free wifi saved my butt when mine at home froze up! And I was there late enough to get a free apple pie that someone ordered but never picked up!,UNK
8617,Pretty standard chain restaurant although if you're searching for a familiar old place this is it.\n\nThe service here was friendly and efficient and overall a pretty good value.,UNK
8618,The staff here makes all the difference! Clean and well maintained accomodations and staffed 24/7. They are also open pretty late in the evening which is very conveniant. Highly recommended!,UNK
8619,"This place probably doesn't need an intro. Upstairs to watch Steelers games, live shows and get loose! Awesome bar that the normal Southside weekend crowd doesn't go into",UNK
8620,"Disclosure:  My cousin is a bartender here\n\nSeriously, she makes the best Mai Tais ever!  They're so good the restaurant decided to add her recipe to the drink menu.  Hang out at the bar, a great cast of local characters always find their way in to hang out with the bartenders.",UNK
8621,"Extremely cheap stay!  Was upgraded to a suite, which was very clean and roomy.  Hotel staff was great, location is about a mile from the strip.  Close to very cheap food and other such places.  Gift shop has incredibly cheap beer.  I wish I would have stayed here instead of the Excalibur widescreen rooms.",UNK
8622,If you like your appetizers before your drinks....this is your place. Table had empty salt and pepper shakers. The hot sauce bottles were empty and dirty. This is NOT authentic Cajun food! The Champagne was flat.....horrible experience. Waiter was aloof.,UNK
8623,"I had nothing but great service... food is excellent and now with the light rail I can actually enjoy a ride to Tempe, without the long ride there.  The best is the lettuce wraps, and to be honest with you, after I eat that, I don't even have to have dinner, just drinks...",UNK
8624,"Got a large steak cheese sandwich, and it is really long!  Enough to feed 3 people.  Ordered with spicy peppers and it was delicious.  Even my 3 to liked it, she said \""Spicy, but it is ok\""",UNK
8625,"I was between a 3 & 4, but remembered they have the best cheese curds I've ever had. Good fries too. MAC & cheese is usually pretty good. Fish fry's not the best I've had. Nice atmosphere.",UNK
8626,"It has never failed...every time I order their Chicken tikka masala, mattet paneer, or navratan korma, it always been delicious. Their server Garry is always super friendly and provided excellent service.",UNK
8627,Been going to Allison for almost 4 years and love her!!  She will take my fuzzy ideas and she brings them to life.  Very friendly and a great hairstylist.  The best!!!,UNK
8628,"I love this place. They have great fro yo and toppings. The staff is always friendly, the prices are good and the place is clean.",UNK
8629,"First off please don't close :(... Could be just rumored but still...\n\nThis place reminds me of when I was a kid and could just \""run in\"" to the store for a few things. Great place!",UNK
8630,Stopped here for a bite last Monday and loved everything about it. Off the beaten path so a spot for regulars instead of the tourist eateries around the corner. highly recommend Vallier Bistro.,UNK
8631,I just got back from Fort Lauderdale and eat mostly Mexican/Cuba the whole time. I was so excited to find this place on line that I wanted to share the Ciban with my wife. To my disappointment the meat was overcooked and dry. Probably won't go back...,UNK
8632,"nothing special here, not sure what all the fuss is about. long line, slow service, mediocre food...... Bofinger is better and thats not saying much seeing as Bofinger aint that great either",UNK
8633,Loved this place!!! Shared the petite plateau from the raw bar. It was fresh and delicious! Our server was very knowledgable. And I thought the wine was so moderately priced I wish I didn't have to hang out w my family so I could have done Easter brunch there! Yum!!!,UNK
8634,"Ugh.  Gross space, rude and slow bar tender.  Did not know the answer to the question \""what do you have on tap\""?  The reply, \""I don't know, I don't really like beer.\""  Not sad to leave.",UNK
8635,The pizza is great  - even the gluten free pizza was good.   The service is good and they always greet you when you walk in the door which  only adds to the experience!,UNK
8636,"Food was good ,ambience excellent . The onlynthing lack was service it was just super slow..since I amhigh on service my eexperience here was ok..",UNK
8637,"The food was good, portions huge, and there was a good variety on the menu.  However it took us an hour and 12 minutes from arrival to getting our food, even though the place wasn't full.  So worth it for the food quality and portions, but be prepared for a long wait to get it.",UNK
8638,Average run of the mill store.  Associates are young teens and they really don't know where anything is.  Luckily I am able to get around to find everything.  Found my puppy treats and moved on.,UNK
8639,"The new location is huge! Been bringing my dogs to Grand Paws for a couple years. Very sweet staff, good follow up, in and out appointments!",UNK
8640,Worst customer service and treatment of women. Each VIP  Controller was inappropriate when touching women and directing  us! I can't believe such an expensive prices for horrible service for women!,UNK
8641,Hands down the BEST raw food in all of Las Vegas. I've taken plenty of meat eaters here and so far every last person has enjoyed their meal.,UNK
8642,Horrible service.  Currently sitting here for over an hour. We've gone to the bar twice for beer but have not once been offered service from one of the two waitresses on the patio. Good atmosphere. Still drinking. But would appreciate an offer of service from someone.... jeez,UNK
8643,Great owners...Average burgers :(\n\nPerhaps the burgers are amazing for some...but when you have tried many places around the valley Lucky Boys doesn't cut it.,UNK
8644,"Very nice ambiance and views.  Incredible food.  My only complaint is that I ordered the 6-course tasting menu, and each course was heavier than the last-- it would have been nice to have something light in between to help me not feel so overwhelmed with richness!",UNK
8645,"Don't come here sober, the waiting time for your food to come to your table is God awful. Too expensive for mediocre food inside the mgm grand. Mai tais are weak. Save your time and money and go to the coffee shop.",UNK
8646,I had the holiday turkey sandwich today and it was amazing!! Turkey dinner on a roll! The husband got the Hawaiian BBQ sandwich and loved that too. We will Definately be back! And for less than 7 bucks a sandwich it is probably one of the cheapest and healthiest items on the strip!,UNK
8647,Service flat out sucked! Their waitresses were all sitting around or making themselves drinks while we waited to put our orders in for over 10 minutes(there were only 3 other groups). When we finally got our food it was undercooked and cold.,UNK
8648,"So this place is a diner and you get what you would expect,  burgers,  chicken fried steak,  breakfast all day, and of course shakes.  Can't complain if that's what you're looking for.  It's a great place for families with kids.",UNK
8649,It's basically what you'd expect from Emeril.  Pretty freaking awesome.  Get the foie gras with your meat.  I just wish I didn't just have The Buffet at Wynn before coming here.,UNK
8650,"The best thing about Family Cafe are the fabulous potatoes or home fries as they call them  The biscuits were unfortunately not home made, kinda hard which was upsetting. The gravy I suspect was also not homemade. Our server was a bit frazzled but the owner was quite nice and thanked us for our patience.",UNK
8651,Great way to break up the debauchery of Vegas. You can go at your own pace and just enjoy a great variety of fish. My favorite is the jellyfish tank.,UNK
8652,"The service was extremely slow. We had to get our own water pitcher after waiting 20 minutes! The good was okay, but over-priced. We won't eat here again.",UNK
8653,"6 Beer Sampler, Belgian, awesome! I loved the Petrus Aged Red the best! It has a strong and sweet berry flavor. The dessert was fabulous! I had the brownie sundae, well worth the 15 minute wait to order, and it would be enough for three people easily!",UNK
8654,"Country club at Wynn not very good. Expect high prices in vegas, but this was just bland. Shrimp and grits bland an boring, porterhouse over cooked and not tasty.",UNK
8655,The ambiance makes it seem like a fancy restaurant but sadly it is not. The food reminds me of Mexican fast food joints like Chilis or Chevy's. Same kind of appetizers and everything. The service is good though.,UNK
8656,"as an employee at the chandler fashion center,  I am always looking for a good place for my lunch break.  Gyro King is delicious, well priced, and the staff are super!  Definately a new favorite!",UNK
8657,"Tiny pool full of tepid piss water w fist pumping idiots....and its $35 for a Ciroc/RB.\nPass. Liquid @ Aria is bigger, cleaner and has better music and vibe.",UNK
8658,Oh how I miss QT\nI was able to get scratch offs and Power Ball tickets. Clean my windows on my SUV get gas and a huge cup of ice I love this place. I damn near cried as we pulled off. I need to move back down south to be near a QT.,UNK
8659,"To be honest, J & N's is not my favorite.  The BBQ is too salty and oversmoked for my taste.  Service is good, and the place is very nice.",UNK
8660,"I don't like their flavor selection.\nI just don't\nCompared with other froyo places nearby, this one is my least favorite flavor-wise.",UNK
8661,Kathy cut my hair and I loved it! She was thorough and kind. I just showed her the picture of how I wanted it and she cut it just how I asked it.\nI passed from a long hear to a short Bob and she did a great job. I felt safe with her and really like my new hair cut.,UNK
8662,Somehow I felt like the waiter was annoyed. He never offered a refill our waters. The food was tasty but it got cold quick :/\nAsked for spicy sauce got sirachi :/,UNK
8663,"i am definitely a fan of their wait staff, the service, and their menu. seafood galore - my favorite was the scallops and pork belly!!! slightly on the pricey side but we enjoyed an extremely pleasurable meal!",UNK
8664,Great food. Baked Mac n Cheese is delicious.  Definitely try the Wasabi Cream sauce.  Can't wait to go back.,UNK
8665,"My toes look great after they were pampered by the doting staff. They are quick, easy and cheap. My polish still looks great 3 weeks later.",UNK
8666,"The food was just OK, with very little meat given, and not very filling. This is just another overpriced place to avoid in Scottsdale.",UNK

We had a fantastic veal pasta dish that really blew us away and a lovely apple tart for desert. \n\nGreat place to bring your family!",UNK
8673,Super greasy. Super fattening. Had to eat with fork and knife. When the food left the wax paper an orange puddle remained. The chili is fine ground grease paste. I am pretty sure I got my entire life serving of trans fat.,UNK
8674,Not really impressed. It's placed had been talked up by so many people I knew and was just pretty average to me. Definitely willing to try it again.,UNK
8675,Ordered the surf and turf. It came with a small rip eye steak 3 shrimp. Also garlic mashed potatoes hard and cold. Extremely disappointed. Small portions and over priced.,UNK

Everything was negotiated up front, and all I had to do is sign and drive.\n\nTheir service department has also been friendly to me.",UNK
8679,"I always feel intimidated when I walk in this store. I know the products are expensive, but I am always floored when I see the price tags, and the staff seems snooty. Yes, they may give a good fit and have great stuff, but I think  more enthusiastic personnel is required here, especially at these prices.",UNK
8680,"I wouldn't stay at a hotel that is currently involved in a major lawsuit.  Management employees are dumbshits and they don't respond well to complaints.  I'd also like to add that rooms are not properly built, so beware...  \n\nI foresee MGM losing this battle.....",UNK
8681,"You know going in that the food isn't going to be incredible, but you'd at least expect the staff to be friendly. This particular OG is very hit or miss. I've had both good and horrible dining experiences due to the waiter/waitress.",UNK

8684,"I went here a couple weeks ago and got the sesame chicken.  I was disappointed when I saw that it wasn't chunks of chicken, but a boneless piece of chicken that was breaded, fried, and then sliced into strips.  The sauce wasn't that good anyway.  I won't be back.",UNK
8685,Awful service... I had a service tech lie and say he changed a warped panel on my Honda ... Made him go get the part that he replaced and he couldn't because they forgot to order it! How can I ever trust them again??,UNK

8688,"I've used this company twice to come and collect debris from construction projects in my back yard. Both times they came out the same day and did a great job. When I call them I immediately get a person on the phone, and everyone I have interacted with was very friendly and uncomplicated. Highly recommended.",UNK
8689,"Fiesta Bowl with quinoa and chicken is really yummy {HUGE portion}, I'm a sauce freak so I of course had to ask for extra ranch. Final impression is that it's plenty yummy but overpriced. Probably won't go back without a Groupon but was fun to try out.",UNK
8690,"Just ate an amazing, very fulfilling meal. We were VERY hungry so ended up ordering multiple dishes and everything was good! The food wasn't too oily or greasy like most other brunch places..just wholesome goodness! Our server was pleasant and very polite. Great experience. Felt like writing this review right away!!",UNK

8693,i loved the place. they have wide variety of cases and other cellphone accessories for iphone and android both. there repairs are perfect.,UNK
8694,One of my favorite spots.  Quality!  Cookies that rival Nancy B's...expensive but worth every penny.  Try the chicken/bacon/avocado sandwich.  It's 5 star worthy...comes with beet chips.  Love love the coffee bar here too.,UNK
8695,Food is bland and overpriced. \n\nAMAZING view but doesn't redeem the boring food.,UNK
8696,"Starbucks coffee is the same everywhere. I love it. This location though, not one of my favorites. There is never any parking because all the cab drivers from the strip are always there. Maybe I just come there at a bad time, but that is my review.",UNK
8697,"I don't know what has happened to RL, but the food is not nearly as good as it used to be, with the exception of the cheddar bay biscuits. My last two visits there were very disappointing. The food was bland. The lobster was tough and lacked flavor. Not interested in returning.",UNK

8701,the food is always fresh and high quality.  my only problem with the place is i don't feel like i get value for my buck.  nice bakery too but it suffers the same overpriced fate.,UNK

8708,"Don't waste your time going to this show. For the price, I was expecting so much more. It was distasteful & not entertaining at all. Halfway through, i was bored & wishing I was somewhere else. I should have paid attention to the negative reviews that were posted. What a joke...",UNK
8709,"I really like this place. My uncle has a timeshare here, so when we come to town we stay here rather then one of the strip hotels. You are still right in the middle of everything, but if need be able to relax and unwind from the chaos of the rest of the casinos.",UNK
8710,we ordered take out cashew nut chicken. my wife and i got diarrhea. we will never order food here again. i hope the AZ food inspector reads this and pays them a visit.,UNK
8711,"Their burgers are different, so if you want a traditional burger, you'll have to order off the menu.  Additionally, everything is a la carte, so the bill adds up quickly.",UNK
8712,Food was amazing. Friend and I grazed on apps and sides and were very pleased and full! Glad I gave this place a shot in lieu of their current yelp of 3.5 stars.,UNK

8720,"Friendly staff, good food and a great happy hour in an awesome modern atmosphere. I've been coming here from about a year and every time I do the food is great. They take classics Mexican cuisine and put a modern twist on it to make it fresh and pleasing.  Plus the chef visits the tables to insure everything was great tasting.",UNK
8721,"The service at this Popo's is not that great!   The original Popo's we never had to ask for anything.  At this Popo's we had to ask to be served, and this site feels like a chain.",UNK
8722,"We've stayed here a couple times, HRH tower. Can't beat the price. It's always fun to wake up to rock stars. We were bummed to find out Chemo is no longer at the Circle Bar, he was our favorite bar tender.",UNK
8723,Had a very pleasant and agreeable sushi lunch here. Service was outstanding and they had some reasonable lunch specials. I'd probably order something different next time as the rock n roll sushi was a little basic. The girl next to me had some sushi that looked outstanding. Overall I was pleased with this place and will be back.,UNK
8724,SOLID taco shop. The machaca and pollo asado do not disappoint! My husband and I enjoy the convenient location plus a drive through. The wait can be a little long but they literally make the food fresh which is a must!,UNK
8725,"Yum yum yum. Never had a bad meal here - food always delicious and comes out fast.  Love the Pad Thai, Pad Kee Mao, Panang, and of course the Tom Yung Goong. The service has always been good.  Great for dine in or take out.  Still my favorite Thai restaurant in Las Vegas.",UNK
8726,"Not a terrible place to grab exactly TWO cocktails.  Anything less and you've wasted your time reaching the densely cocked bar area, anything more, and you've been chatting far too long with some  maxipad who would mainline toilet water given the absence of blow.\n\nGet your two and bug out.",UNK
8727,This is very authentic food. I love different ethnic food and honestly their menu was still a little too authentic for me - and from what I got not healthy and not all that good. I ordered a chicken lemongrass bowl. The chicken was in a lot of oil - all over the chicken - with a plentiful layer at the bottom of the bowl.,UNK
8728,"This only gets two stars because I love Carl's Jr. This one really lacks in everything. Cold food, crappy service. But, I keep going, not sure why.",UNK

8731,Worst Chinese ever!!! Had their pad Thai and it was horrible and the texture was Discusting! Their crab Rangoon was decent but other than that horrible,UNK
8732,"Great restaurant. Has a mug club that is worthwhile if you go here a lot. Their food is great, especially the pretzel rolls you get.  The beer selection is vast.\n\nOktoberfest is a great time as well. A polka band plays while you eat and enjoy authentic German food.",UNK
8733,OK food at best.  Good for beer.  I have gotten unlucky because I have gotten the same bartender the past three times and she has the social skills of my bar stool.,UNK
8734,I am not a vegan but love vegetables and would prefer to not eat meat most of the time. This place has the best spring rolls I have ever tasted. My sister-in-law is vegan and I went with her and she liked it too!,UNK
8735,"Been here an hour, still haven't seen our food that they said would be ready in 20 minutes. The high chairs are dirty and greasy. We have complained twice and no one has offered compensation, or bread or anything to hold over the six hungry kids in our party.",UNK
8736,Seeing the small chocolate factory was pretty cool.  If you read the information you get the history and how they do things.  Chocolates were really good.  We came here for the cactus garden lights for Christmas... Enjoyed the chocolate factory while we waited.,UNK

8744,I've died and gone to Mexico.  Best bang for the buck.  Come with an appetite because the food is filling.  Had steak and shrimp fajitas.  Fabulous!   Get the guacamole for the chips.  Made right in front of you.,UNK
8745,"Spendy bar and grill next to the sports book. Food was not worth the wait or the price, but for a semi drunk midday meal it was fine. Waitress was bubbly and attentive, but i wouldn't go out of your way to eat here.",UNK
8746,"Okay, sure, the Chicken and Waffles and Stuffed Burger were huge and delicious but the service was terrible. The hosts weren't very welcoming at all and our server took a while to take our order and seemed to be distracted and too busy. He wasn't very friendly and were kinda rushing us out.",UNK
8747,"Winner winner Tuna melt sammich. They use albacore white, Swiss cheese on a soft heated bun.  It was Earlicius!!! Sorry no pics, scarfed that bad boy down.  It was also a really good portion, not gijimbo just right.",UNK

8749,The BBQ Pig N Chick Pizza has stood out as a favorite of mine. I enjoyed the Drewpy Fries despite them being a little saltier than I would have liked. The Garlic Monkey Bread is definitely a starter staple. The dipping sauce made it for me.,UNK
8750,"After purchasing a night stay at this crappy hotel. Roberto, the person in the front of the hotel registration desk did not honor our hotwire deal. In fact very rude and told us to pay more. Never go to CRAPPY Arizona Charlie's Casino because of bad customer service and rude Roberto!",UNK

8753,I can't vouch for the rooms because I didn't stay here but I did attend a conference and the service was excellent. Gabriella (Gabby) tended the small bar they had and she was top of the line. If all employees were like Gabby there wouldn't be any bad reviews.,UNK
8754,"Terrible service. We were passed by the same waitress a dozen times and no service, when we tried to get her attention we were rudely told not now. This is a big hang out for Michigan fans and I'm wondering why with lack of service.",UNK
8755,It was our first time here and we're very welcomed by Marty who served up an amazing lunch and dining experience! A very quaint place with amazing dishes! The meatballs were outstanding!,UNK

8757,"I am a big fan of 5 Guys.  Sadly they may have let their popularity go to their heads.  Tonight we had the worst fries ever.  They were over cooked and soggy.  We know they can do better, but the crew working at the Northlake location blew it fonight.",UNK
8758,I've been mis-diagnosed many times by Dr. Austin. The wait is ALWAYS an hour or two and you have to keep calling the office to get results.,UNK
8759,Not fantastic. Drinks were good but the food was VERY LACKING!!! pffffffffffft!,UNK
8760,It's Quiznos.  It's mediocre food.  It's conveniently downtown.  Convenient mediocrity gets eaten.,UNK
8761,"Disappointing. Overpriced. I bought the orange chicken, beef teriyaki and the katsu chicken. \nNothing special. Panda Express does a \""better job\"". I had such higher expectations. \n\nEdamame were stale and boring.",UNK
8762,"This is a company that has a lack of follow-through and punctuality. Blake, the owner, is very disrespectful and arrogant.  I'm a busy professional, and they had no respect for my time or their commitments. I do not recommend utilizing this company.",UNK
8763,"Too expensive for not real cheesesteaks, they were on a sandwich roll not even on a Philly roll. And everything is all a cart. And everything is way too overpriced, $35 for two people.",UNK
8764,Tea heaven! Bought a Chocolate mint tea and a white tea (Red Fruit). Delicious! Got some meat rubs and lavender buds. Definitely coming back.,UNK
8765,"A 3 at best. Mediocre Pad Thai, and the rest of the fare was pretty similar. Came because of the good rating but, alas, the rating was wrong.",UNK
8766,Love this place! Great vegetarian options! Tofu and broccoli in black bean sauce is a personal favorite. The flavored are delicious and the food is very fresh. Great for take out too!,UNK
8767,"Old faithful, no surprises as far as the product goes.  The one thing that surprised me is that they are not set up to take gift cards or the android app.   I charged up my card before i left because I don't like to carry too much cash around.  Oh well.",UNK
8768,"The burgers are large and greasy.  Thats about it.  If you like waiting for over an hour plus to get average food, this is your place.  The diarrhea is free tho.",UNK
8769,"Manager is a joke. Closed extremely  early. Wouldn't talk face to face, had employees running back and forth with messages. This has happened before.",UNK
8770,This place is fantastic. I went here today looking to get a link taken out of one watch and the clasp fixed on another watch. The guy did it on the spot and gave me some tips for cleaning my watch at home. Great service and low prices (less than $12 for that).,UNK
8771,Like some others I was skeptical because the base boards that I bought were so cheap in comparison to Lowe's or even lumber liquidators.  But the quality of the baseboards was great for the price and the service was good,UNK
8772,"Just dined there tonight.  It was delicious. Ordered the spinach salad, vegan style and artichoke pizza sans cheese. Highly recommend.  Delicious bread, as well. Friendly service!",UNK
8773,When I got to the register I thought I had broke a window. There were no prices on anything when we walked up to the counter. I should have walked away because I'm the biggest loser. Fifty three bucks for 2 frickin scoops. I am going to frame the receipt. This is where I got screwed in Vegas.,UNK
8774,Went here Tuesday for lunch. Sat there for nearly 10 minutes no service no menus. Just walked out too bad because I wanted to try food.... but can't give my money to such bad business.,UNK

8777,"All the food is great.  Order from the specials menu.  You wont be disappointed.\n\nService is lacking unless you sit at the bar.\n\nAtmosphere is OK, but the food really is worth the trip, especially breakfast and lunch.\n\nGreat fruit side dish.",UNK
8778,"Very poor service, I was seated for 20 min before they took my order or even offered me a beverage. I would have left but did not want to deal with a disappointed 3 year old. I will not return to this location and will not leave a tip of any amount. I have been here before, with good service, not sure what happened.",UNK
8779,"The Ranchero Omelette is what I always get. The sausage is always fresh and the eggs nicely cooked. I'm not a huge fan of franchise breakfast places. However, when in the run, and in new of a quick-nicely and freshly done breakfast, Paradise Bakery does the trick ;)",UNK
8780,"Wow. If you're looking for a way to relax and get a lot for your money, this is an hour well spent. Kudos to my therapist. I'm coming back! Affordable prices starting at about $30 an hour. And right now, they are offering $30 for 75 minutes for a Christmas special. OMG!",UNK
8781,"This is the worst post office for pickup only line. There were 5 people in front of me and I waited for one full hour.  For one person, the lady took 25 min to take care of one customer. If you have no choice to go anywhere else, expect waiting for a long time.",UNK
8782,It is good bread. I will be back again; will have to remember to carry cash. My only disappointment is they don't take debit/credit cards; this is 2013. Get Square or something.,UNK
8783,It was ok. It was cheesy and I'm not a huge ABBA fan but wanted to see what all the hype was about. Got discount tickets so I guess I can't complain too much.,UNK
8784,One of the better pizza we've had.  The place small but clean.  Service is excellent and the food is above average.  If you want wine you must take your own glass and pay dollars for the glass.  We will definitely go back,UNK
8785,What a great place if you have the time to wait it well worth it. Top 10 pizza places I have ate anywhere. A hole pie takes about 30 min so get a pice of siclan!!!!!!,UNK

8788,They don't always have everything I am looking for but the store is well kept. It's neatly tucked away in the corner but easy to access. The store tends to be well stocked with typical items but I like that this one doesn't overstuff themselves with holiday junk. Sometimes they need more cashiers though.,UNK
8789,Horrible service..I can see staff messing around in the back while I watch them.. waiting for my food.. smh,UNK
8790,"Great pesto chicken sandwich and the white chocolate brownie explosion cake was one of the best cakes I have ever had!  I would highly recommend this, especially for dessert!",UNK
8791,Good food but my service sucked. The waitress brought the wrong dish and insisted it was what I ordered and refused to bring the correct dish. What's with that? I didn't eat it and they refused to take it off my bill.,UNK
8792,Food is ok. Typical bar food. Wings are mediocre.  Never have had great service here. Our waitress this evening never once stopped by to ask how our food was or offered to fill our drinks.,UNK
8793,"Loved this place,  I had the seared yellowfin salad, and it was amazing.  It's pricey but worth it .  I would say to order it raw since I got it medium and it was cooked all of the say through, with no pink.  It was still amazing, even over cooked.",UNK
8794,This is the worst Mcdonalds ever the manger looks like a fucking creep and there service is slow... They forgot my ranch and made my plain Mcdouble with extra ketchup.,UNK
8795,"Have to agree; probably the worst place for \""seafood\"" around. And the corporate atmosphere reminds me of outback or chilis.... enough said.",UNK
8796,We recently tried this place thinking it's a nice sit in restaurant.  It was more of fast food type like Panda Express but with authentic Chinese food.  They had my husband's favorite Egg Foo Young.  Overall it was ok.  I will come back and try other items on the menu.  Saves us from driving all the way to Chinatown.,UNK
8797,***NOW CLOSED***\n\n\nI've been here twice and no complaints. Brought it home when my mom was visiting and she loved it.  The marinade on the chicken is wonderful.,UNK
8798,"Just ok. Very pricy for what you get. $11 for a small sandwich and a drink? Sandwich was way overloaded with mustard, couldn't taste much else.",UNK
8799,"The food here was ok, pretty typical buffet place. The prime rib was good though and they had a wide selection of foods.\n\nThe desserts looked pretty good but i was a little disgusted when a roach crawled on my arm while i was eating my last plate that i just stopped eating and left.",UNK
8800,"Had such a wonderful time. The best parts were the balcony, spa tub, and the view. Everyone was very nice and it was easy to get to the MGM restaurants. Absolutely will be back. Great deal.",UNK
8801,"Service sucked; asked for water 3 times personally and a few times by others at my table, and it didn't come until after we asked over 5 times. Same thing for additional sauces. Huge language barrier in this restaurant; bring someone who can speak and understand Chinese for adequate service.",UNK

8804,"Came here with a large group and loved it. The staff were super friendly, the rolls were great. I recommend the H3 roll or the Oh My God roll if you want something really crazy. Traditional Sushi/sashimi can't be beat for the price. By far my favorite sushi place in Phoenix",UNK
8805,Loved the smoothies and the tea on my first visit here. Also appreciate that they have soy milk. I definitely plan on coming back!,UNK
8806,Terrible!!! The DJ couldn't even figure out what music to play. The dance floor is in a terrible place and way to small. This place needs a major upgrade starting with the music.,UNK
8807,Wow! I am speechless. I have been to so many Thai restaurant and so far this is the best I ever had.  The Chef Special menu is outstanding and nobody comes close.  We have Arun's Thai restaurant in Chicago but still this place is better.,UNK

8809,"Carol has done my makeup for me for special events.  She says she gives me the California girl look.  In any case, I always dazzle after Carol works her magic.  I highly recommend her for make up, make overs, and facials.\n\nCandy Stone\nStone Talent",UNK
8810,Can I put zero stars. At this point it took us 20 minutes after getting seated to get a waitress to stop at the table. Then given a poor excuse about why. Don't know if the food is any good at this time but the beer selection looks good.,UNK
8811,Yummy fajita burro and chips and salsa. Better than a lot of Mexican restaurants!! Wish the person taking my order spoke better English. Sounds mean but my order was wrong and more than I wanted to pay. It was frustrating ordering. That's the reason for 3 stars.,UNK
8812,"Had dinner last night. We each had the chicken fajita a decent sized portion, unable to finish. Pleasant tasting; nothing remarkable, but certainly ok.",UNK
8813,I go to this store because it's close to Design and Wine. I usually just get coffee. The fall flavors are out. Pumpkin Colada (colatta) sp. The people are friendly. The best thing I like is the drive thru. Yay,UNK
8814,"I mostly utilize this place for their fantastic tea selection, though the coffee here is my favorite. Their tea lattes are my go to on school mornings. Great location with lots of selection.",UNK
8815,So I hope the food is good because the service sucks. I sat down for a to go order. It took 20 minutes to place my order and another 25 minutes to get it. One waitress and one cook. All the tables were dirty and there were only Five other people in the place. Don't be in a hurry.,UNK
8816,Toasted sandwiches are the way to go. Such it Subway. The Philly cheese steak and chicken Teriyaki were my favorites. The fries were pretty good.,UNK
8817,"One of the best steak steakhouses in downtown las vegas, it's definitely smart to split a plate, steaks are a real good size :)  Would recommend this place if you're in downtown las vegas for a special occasion or celebratory dinner :)",UNK
8818,"Love Wahoo's! Price for my meal was cheap, food was yummy, and portions are big! The decor is cool too. Reminds me of the beach. Vegetarian and gluten free options. Must try the green enchiladas.",UNK
8819,"It is tasty, standard Cajun food.  The food doesn't live up to the price in my opinion. Highlight of when I've been is the Alligator appetizer.",UNK
8820,"Great burgers\nGood Fries\nFriendly staff and atmosphere. Next to 24 hours fitness.. \nMy post work out meal. Yeah, I now...its counter productive.",UNK
8821,Yum!  My office orders from here often for lunch.  Their fried rice is my favorite and the Satay is good as well.  I'm not a huge fan of their Pad Thai...I've had better.,UNK
8822,Stopped in this morning for the first time and am so happy I did!!  My husband and I each had a Iced Americano and it was Delicious. We will be back for the frozen yogurt next time.  So glad to have found this cool spot.,UNK
8823,"Spa manager welcomes with kindness and hospitality. Spa massage and facial were excellent and great value on Tranquil Tuesday special,promotions.",UNK
8824,"Vegas with Skoti is a different experience.  LV Top Shelf got 15 of my friends in the best clubs at the lowest prices I've experienced in 10 years of doing Vegas hard.  We had the best tables, waited in no lines, and went to all the pool parties.  Can't recommend enough.",UNK
8825,"used to love this place. the wings are great, made the way i enjoy. the pizza is good, but while eating my second slice i just got sick of all the cheese for some reason. My favorite was the crust so soft and yummy. still a good place to eat before going to movies.",UNK
8826,Good sushi and very quick with take out orders.  Have tried Tanaka around 10 separate time over the last three months and they are very consistent with food quality and taste.,UNK
8827,"I'm actually pretty surprised this place has 4 stars. let me start off by saying I did go close to closing so that might have had a part into my bad experience. anyways, I went there probably a week ago and the sushi was just alright, nothing special.  Soft shell crab was no bueno.",UNK
8828,Attempted to stay at hotel in October. The raised the rate on me just before I arrived. General manager has no idea what customer service is. Will never stay there again. Rude staff do not recommend to anyone going to Pittsburg. Would of given negative stars but was not able to.,UNK
8829,"Food is good, but not great. Service is acceptable with no complaints.  It's a local hangout and has a great atmosphere.",UNK
8830,"The Orleans has been very good to me with comps. The rooms are always clean, they have good entertainment (Bill Maher was there last week when I was), and they seem very generous with their comps.\n\nI will be back!",UNK
8831,"I hate this Von's. I will actually drive to the one in Boca Park, which is further away, because I prefer it better. The Pharmacy staff is horrible and so is the check out staff. I've had to go here on rare occasions and always end up dissatisfied.",UNK
8832,"One of the worst managers of a Subway ever!  The workers are jammed, b/c short staffed, the supplies are barely adequate, and the manager is sarcastic and flippant.  There is a much better subway on west Bethany Home near the freeway.",UNK
8833,I Love this bar! The steak was delicious and the waitress was very attentive... What was the most  surprising was the fact that we had a groupon and the waitress didn't treat us any differently.. Some restaurants act like you are using food stamps when you have a groupon.. Thanks ladies!,UNK
8834,"Lots of glitz and glamour yes, it looks nice yes...but the service was abysmal. Be interested to know if others had the same experience but I have to say I wont be rushing back anytime soon.\n\nAlmost warm prosecco from their 'other fridge' was a not a winner!",UNK
8835,My favorite show in Vegas.  Don't try to understand the story - just enjoy the visuals.  Mesmerizing.  I can't say enough how much my family and I enjoyed the show.  Worth EVERY penny.,UNK
8836,"Confirmed that they do not take coupons from http://www.restaurant.com anymore. \n\nVery friendly people, though!",UNK
8837,"We have ordered a pizza and waited long time. But at the end, they gave us a hoagie... The lady there promised to refund us, but we never received it.",UNK
8838,$7 and $1 per kid.  Affordable snack bar.  A fun night for all.  A variety of current and slightly old movies.  Always something for the kids.  Double features too!,UNK
8839,Hubs and I visited for a nightcap and ended up staying a while longer.  Bartender was super nice and the crowd was pleasant.  Drinks were reasonably priced.  Will definitley be back!,UNK
8840,"I will never return to this place again. Horrible, cold and disgusting food. Service was horrible and was a waste of $80! Never again.",UNK
8841,"Fees for \""dormant\"" account stripped me of $20 over the course of a year and a half. Be warned. And be warned that tellers have no interest in helping. The gentleman there in the back office was nice and informative and that is about where the good service ends.",UNK
8842,"Its free, its pretty, its something different on the strip. Kids will probably like it. It didnt wow me as much as I expected.",UNK
8843,"Dr Quan fixes you! I went to her for chronic foot pain. Of course, everything is connected so she actually found misalignment higher up in the body that lead to improper walking and thus foot pain. Who knew?!\n\nThe office is clean. Staff is wonderful! Dr Quan is a gem!",UNK
8844,Top. Preis/Leistung kaum zu schlagen. Geschmacklich gut und f\u00fcr uns in 5min erreichbar. \nWir kommen immer wieder :-),UNK
8845,Food was great. The sushi was fresh. Meals came with a salad and miso soup. Service was slow for a weekday dinner with maybe 4 tables and 4 servers.,UNK
8846,Great portions and good food. Stayed for a week near by. Probably ate here 4 times in a week. The southwest Cobb salad is beyond delicious. Great happy hour 4-7 everyday. Highly recommend.,UNK
8847,Bartender was a heinous miserable female but the drinks were bomb!  I would go back just for the gnarly drinks but the service was totally Yucca yucca!,UNK
8848,The Arizona Humane Society does not rate in my opinion.  I would recommend that animal lovers support any of the other worthy animal welfare organizations.,UNK
8849,Legit Vietnamese food. My husband is a culinary student and we go to a lot of Vietnamese restaurants because it is his favorite genre of food. This is authentic food that is simply delicious. Cute little place in downtown Glendale so feel free to do some antique shopping on foot when you are done.,UNK
8850,I wish I had read some of these reviews prior to taking Rachel Ray's word for it. The food was ok nothing to write home about. I would choose differently next time.\n\nThink twice before going.,UNK
8851,"Absolutely appalling customer service. Employees are so rude. The girl working the register, Diane, was so unprofessional and rude in letting me know my catering order was going to be 20 minutes late, and could have cared less. Never order a catering order from here. Worst customer service ever!",UNK
8852,"Nothing wrong with it.  Not a whole right either.  Poorly shucked oysters, over cooked scallops and frozen butter. \n\nNo one got hurt.",UNK
8853,Clean. Friendly staff. Just what one needs to relax. Always get the strawberry drink unless I'm in the mood for coffee then it's a double shot!,UNK
8854,Best subs in Charlotte...good bread. CHEAP! And speedy polite service :) I am always pleased. :p,UNK
8855,I go here for lunch all the time.  The menu is small but its cheap and tons of food. For  lunch:  Meat (or fish) + rice + vegi+ soup+ desert + coffe for $8.  Can't beat that.  I love the owner as well.  He's totally awesome.,UNK
8856,"Pretty indifferent about InO.  Not the worst, not the best. I never plan going, its more of a spontaneous \""I am hungry and they're the first I see that are convenient to turn into\""",UNK
8857,Had a meeting to attend out on Fish Hatchery Rd.  Saw this as a restaurant near the meeting and wanted to give it a try.  Very glad I did.\n\nI tried the Chicken Karee.  Was wonderful including the smell.  Just a little bite.\n\nI will be exploring more of this menu,UNK
8858,Love their Tex Mex style menu. Chicken chipotle is awesome! Great service and food is consistently good. Highly reccomended...,UNK
8859,"The could serve nothing but their chicken wings and stay in business!  The food is good and you get a alot!  If it was just the entree's i would give 3 stars.  If it was the wings only, it's 5!!!",UNK
8860,I had a huge burger and it was ok. I would have liked a little less quantity and more quality. Not a place I would return to. I ate about 1/3 my meal and was disappointed. The tractor is cool.,UNK
8861,They don't have the usual great subway service that you would expect from a subway. Ive been in multiple tines and employees have not had a uniform. No great and they are mean when attend to you. I recommend the service at jersey mikes better.,UNK
8862,"The sushi was not to bad, I got the \""yo adrian\"" However the happy hour prices even on a Saturday  was a great deal. The pork dumplings were nice.",UNK
8863,"Who charges $3 for a tiny bottle of water? Total scumbag move, Palms. I loved this place until this moment.",UNK
8864,Amazing!  Not only was it my first massage ever but it was one of the best experiences ever. I now feel because of Stacey that I have a better understanding of my body and how much this therapy is very beneficial! I cannot wait to go back,UNK
8865,Food was good. Margaritas were weak. Service was absolutely terrible - perhaps the worst service I have ever experienced at any restaurant. The party at the next table appeared to agree - they got up and left after ordering their dinner. I would never recommend this restaurant and will never go again.,UNK
8866,"I have to say the food at this place is quite delicious, however, the service is absolutely terrible!!! The plates are HUGE and portions are generous. Just be prepared for your server to not be super peppy.",UNK
8867,This place is awesome! !!!!!! Great customer service.  And the pig is out of this world. Its the new Chipotle.,UNK
8868,Been here twice for lunch. Love the hummus app and the salmon salad  & Chinese chicken salad. Servers are very attentative and atmosphere is great inside and out!  This is my fav fox restaurant.,UNK
8869,Yay for local babies! We got a smoking deal on a set of Dwell studio baby bedding here and stocked up on clothes and a few books. Awesome prices and the owner was friendly and helpful. We'll be back once the little one comes!,UNK
8870,"Food is good, but nothing makes me want to become a regular. Too expensive and the concept is more of a nice novelty item. Breakfast quality is at par with your local brunchery or Marie calendars. Check it out once or twice, but the hype soon fades.",UNK
8871,"If you don't mind wading through the drunks and homeless to get inside, this might work for you. Dirty, layout is WEIRD and customer service is non-existent. I will drive farther to go to a better location.",UNK
8872,If you like to be followed around like a dog to buy overpriced cigars that are very DRY. This is the place for you. 15 plus years selling wholesale cigars so I would know. Buy one put it in your humidor for a month and enjoy!,UNK
8873,"Cook Out's are great and this one is no different than the others. Two drive-thru's make it quick. Keep in mind this is drive-thru only. They specialize in \""fast food\"" burgers and milkshakes. The food is relatively inexpensive, but far from fast food quality.",UNK
8874,"Pretty good mall. I hate all the malls around the strip. It just gets so busy. The Galleria is perfect because its away from all tourists and what not. It has your basic shops, so its good enough for me.",UNK
8875,"Food and thai tea were absolutely delicious. The ambiance is a little confusing, you almost feel like you're in a house.",UNK
8876,I was disappointed in my food tonight. The Tom Ka soup was sour with no spicy kick and the noodle dish was very bland.,UNK
8877,Wonderful drive thru service this morning.  I changed the order at the speaker and added on at the window and the wonderful women was so accommodating. Order was right and super fresh. Thank you BK.,UNK
8878,"Good, wisconsin-esque experience.  The flavors of the day, mint oreo, then cookie dough, were just ok.  Would go back, unless I found someplace better.",UNK
8879,"The entrance is cool walking through the kitchen. The main Chef was not there and my NY Steak was over cooked, had to send back. Took awhile to get a new one. Was OK, I will probably not return.",UNK
8880,"This place is Amazing! In less than 30 min my phone was ready! The screen of my phone was black , it was frozen! Verizon was charging me too much . This place has reasonable prices and it has great quality! Thank you! :)",UNK
8881,"Nice menu of Vietnamese and Thai dishes, as well as smoothy drinks and banh mi.  The waiter takes your order which goes directly to the kitchen through a wireless device, excellent for big groups.  Banh Beo was great.  They have plain egg breakfasts as well.",UNK
8882,Second visit with a different child for possible dehydration was HORRIBLE!  Same doctor as the first time but it was seriously a nightmare.,UNK
8883,"I've had better. The food is never great and the service can be slow. It shouldn't be a struggle to get a glass of water, but I'm 2 for 2 here.",UNK
8884,If you're looking for a fun day out during Spring Training... you're looking at the right place. \n\nThe food is decent and the seats are all pretty great. I don't really have any deciding factors that would possibly make me rate the sports complex higher...,UNK
8885,"Pretty nice shopping area. Lots of nice shops all gathered within the same place. You basically get a little of everything. This is definitely a good place to visit if you want to feel outdoor within an enclose place. At any place within the Forum Shops, just look up and you see clear blue skies.",UNK
8886,"Nice facility but massage therapist tend to be below excellent at Massage Envys, for every good massage I must endure 4 - 5 well below excellent massages.",UNK
8887,"We always stay in summer in this hotel, totally recommended, my kids love the beach, lazy river and all the different pools available, great for families!!",UNK
8888,Good food. We tried there Dal and Baigan Bharatha it was very good. Panner was ok. I am not big fan of Paneer anyways. \n\nI will go back here if i am in town. No cocktails on menu,UNK
8889,"The Ainsworth is a swanky sports bar in the LV HARD ROCK Hotel.. The drinks are very good, the bar service is great and the decor is beautiful..  There is live music  later and daily drink specials Sunday through Friday.",UNK
8890,The professional staff helped us thru the\nmmj process from start to finish. They even followed up with the state. Very happy\nthey will be handling the renewals.\nThis is the place that gets the job done.,UNK
8891,This is a good Chinese place compared to other places of similar caliber.  I like almost everything here except for the scallops and mushrooms.  The scallops tasted rancid and were overlooked.  The curry is good and so is everything else.   Service was slow and not attentive.,UNK
8892,"Super cute and modern ambiance, reasonably priced beautiful delicious food, and helpful friendly staff.  I've been here for dinner and brunch it has impressed me both times.  It seems like they accommodate for large groups as well.  I would definitely continue to go here.",UNK
8893,"Gaang Ped (spelling?) with the red curry sauce & chicken... fabulous.  Great service, very tranquil inside.  I'll be back!",UNK
8894,"Although I can not really say much different about this place just yet, I will give it one more star since the manager reached out to me and offered to correct the experience I had. Next time I am in Vegas I will have to give this place a second try.\n\nThank you management for caring, it goes a long way",UNK
8895,Burgers were great but the chicken strippers were tough and chewy. I would think that they would be better being a place known for their chicken wings. Not terribly impressed.,UNK
8896,Horrible service... Wait for food is 20 min. I know it's just McDonalds but this is crazy. If they actually had to compete for business they would fail...,UNK
8897,"Buscuits from the freezer and gravy from a can.  How can your signature dish, which is fairly easy to make, taste like cardboard? So disappointed... And weird atmosphere too:/",UNK
8898,"Wow, what a great place. The shiromi carpaccio app was terrific as was the service. It was a real treat. The food was fresh and unique. Highly recommend.",UNK
8899,"The food was okay, not overly exciting. The daiquiri was not good at all but they did take it off the bill. Service was good and everyone was very nice. The fried jalape\u00f1os was good.",UNK
8900,"Great service to and from the airport. Will use for future visits.  We used both the stretch limo and the SUV. VIP service is great with a large party.  Timely, friendly and helpful drivers.",UNK
8901,Had an awesome breakfast burrito this morning. A lot for your money. Better than the Filibertos across the street & cheaper. Love their Cali burrito!,UNK
8902,The food was very good. The service was very bad. Rather than listing all the specifics let me just say that it was bad enough that it ruined the experience. I would try it again but never on a Saturday night when there's a big show at the MGM. Maybe when it's less busy it would better.,UNK
8903,I really enjoyed the Bloody Mary but I ordered a waffle and it was god awful. Also they sat my party of 8 outside where it was hot and gross. The misters were not even blowing in our direction. The service was not great and they hardly checked on us. What a waste of money! I am never coming back!,UNK
8904,By far the best wings in North Las Vegas! I order from here a few times a month. Their specials are incredible and delivery time is always 30 minutes or less!,UNK
8905,This place was terrible.  I hoped it would be a step up from McDonalds. Big mistake. The food was barely edible. $10 for chicken fingers and fries. The chicken fingers were overcooked. Bbq sauce was bad. Fries were both burned and soggy. Customer service was abysmal. Stay away.,UNK
8906,Hotel and Casino Are Dumpy! Old tvs from the 90's and the toilet was wore out uncleenable i think. Service sucked. Ended up getting rm service to get wings!,UNK
8907,The food and wine were good. The service was horrible.  Our reservation was for 8:30 p.m. and we did not get seated until almost 9:00 p.m.  Took another half hour to receive appetizer whereby we complained to manager.  After that our service improved.,UNK
8908,Great food. Wings are huge and tasty. The green chili is also good. Try the chicken nachos with the green chili on it. Yummy! Drinks are made well and prices are reasonable.,UNK
8909,"Finally we live in a neighborhood with a great Chinese joint.  Love this place and if you like doughy dumplings, you will love theirs.  We get them everytime!!  Service is great and the food comes out quick and HOT!   Love it and highly recommend it.",UNK
8910,"Recommended by our hotel .. Gonna egg the concierge' car. You know you've been misled when the best part of an \""authentic Mexican  meal\"" is the a arugula salad. Bad food, bad margaritas, charming but clueless servers.  Skip it.",UNK
8911,Great food and great service. The hand cut frites are so crispy and flavored. The steak is also perfectly done. Love this place,UNK
8912,Expensive and overcooked... Place was empty and cooking time was quite long. With all the choices in Vegas this was the wrong one,UNK
8913,"This place can be summed up in three sentences:\n\nHas a pretty interesting crowd and it's a really fun Tuesday night hangout.\nHas a truly intriguing interior.\nTERRIBLE, HORRIBLE, GOD AWFUL food.",UNK
8914,"Surprisingly nice for a free zoo! Plenty of parking, a decent array of animals. Unfortunately, many were not out because it was still cold outside. I imagine that there are more animals lurking around in the summer months!\n\nNice way to spend an hour on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon!",UNK
8915,Worst doctor office. Do not go here. Very rude costumer service and do not care about patient health. By far one of the worst experiences I have ever had.,UNK
8916,Very little value.  We had been customers for the past 15 years.  Under it's current management it's a complete ripoff.,UNK
8917,"Outside of china town this is a very good option, it has all the classics on the menu along with a few dishes I had not had before.  Service was fast, and food was very good.  Definitely worth stopping in again the next time i'm in the area.",UNK
8918,"Best massage I've had in a long time. The staff is courteous and helpful.  I was treated so well, the bad day I was having seemed like a distant memory when I left. I'll definitely be back!",UNK
8919,"My stay this time was a little better, they didn't put me in a handicap room.  However I saw foot prints in my bathroom floor so I don't know if the room was cleaned or not.  So who knows.  Unfortunately when I book travel through my company, I don't really have options of where I can stay.",UNK
8920,I absolutely love their breakfast! Their pancakes are fantastic and huge. Other favorites are the wet burrito and the crazy cowboy...the pork chili verde is amazing.,UNK
8921,I love this Ruby Tuesday. Staff is always courteous and food is good. Try the lobster mac & cheese...it is awesome! The salmon is good here as well as the pasta w/shrimp.,UNK
8922,Great sushi.  Friendly service.  A good mom and pop operation. The bonsai roll was delicious.   One of the better sushi places and great prices too.,UNK
8923,"Bigger is not always better, and this place proves it. The sandwiches are plenty, and the dishes are heaping, but the food is not flavorful. Add salt & pepper! Very clean and always busy, so nothing bad... Just decent.",UNK
8924,"I love the curry here! It has a homemade taste - you can taste the vegetables melted into the curry broth, so subtle. I love the simplicity of the menu too. The curry broth is the main ingredient of course, and then you can add a topping. Genuine service too :)",UNK
8925,This is my favorite place to get hangover food...LOL. I usually get the adobo fried rice omelet. If you haven't had it you need to try it...it's delicious. The only thing is if you sit in the dining room the service isn't the greatest. Very slow.,UNK
8926,This card is a scam. Got a bill in the mail before I even received my card. Their fees are insane. You are better off using a secured card to rebuild credit. I use a capitol one card and they are awesome,UNK
8927,"You know what you are getting when you walk through the door.  The menu does change slightly but everyone has their favorites.  \n\nWHat does add to this location is that the staff is usually friendly and in a good mood.  At other locations, you get a fast-food experience from a fast-food staff.",UNK
8928,"They legitimately have the best seafood as far as the crab, lobster, and many others in town. They bring it in town fresh every day. And they are never small crab legs. My husband and I come here quit often, love it.",UNK
8929,Messed up my order and delivered it 2 hours late. This was from the Powers location in Mesa. Is it really that hard to make and deliver a pizza. Obviously this place is in need of new management. I think his name was Rocky. Never ordering from this place again.,UNK
8930,Went on a Saturday night.  Had reservations and was given the option of outside seating or indoor.  Very accommodating.  Recommends the cheese plate.  Great service and atmosphere.,UNK
8931,This was our first and last visit to this restaurant. We split the Cuban sandwich and the pork was terrible.  My daughter had the chicken salad and it was boring.  The inside of the restaurant smells like fried food And you will leave smelling like the fryer.,UNK
8932,"Questionable service, dirty floors, sticky tables - non existent management. Sub par food. Don't get a salad unless you want salad mix.",UNK
8933,"The checkin person was rude... And these rest of the staff seemed either rude or aloof to me... Checked in early, guess that's a problem. I'll go to a different one next time...",UNK
8934,"There is a lot of variety but the food was not that great. The line is long but that goes for every las Vegas buffet that's in the strip. Honestly, if it wasn't for the cheap discount, I don't think anyone would go there. The service also sucked.",UNK
8935,Mediocre dim sum but one of the only places on the east side of town. Nicer atmosphere than some of the dim sum places in town.  If you are having a mid-day har gow craving.  It will fit the bill.,UNK
8936,"The best Ribs in town!  Everyone there is helpful and the service is good. My only complaint was the last time I was there my order was incorrect. The food was still great, and after a phone call they did apologize for the mistake.  I would still say \""GO THERE\"" you will not be disappointed.",UNK
8937,I changed from this dentist to another one.  The office is nice but I personally did not think i was getting quality care.  After going to new dentist they alerted me to all kinds of issues that I was not even aware of and needed to be done.  I feel office was more about profits than patient care.,UNK
8938,"I like going here - there is plenty of choice - good burgers, love their pot pie and they do a good brunch on the week-end.  If you are not sure what you want for dinner, come here there is plenty of variety and you will not be disappointed",UNK
8939,Water is nasty!!!\nWaitress very Unfriendly \nSlow service!\nI would never go back!,UNK
8940,"So the dry cleaning was ok, customer service was average at best but the prices are crazy for what you get. CRAZY. No thanks.",UNK
8941,"Weren't very hungry but really wanted to try the fried chicken .. unbelievable!  Light, crispy, must try it for yourself!",UNK
8942,Looking for a great doctor to tend to your shoulder or knee? Look no further. Dr. Randall Yee is the best. He did my TKR and it was as perfect as can be--no complications whatsoever. He also has an excellent staff--all are congenial and take time to answer questions.,UNK
8943,"Excellent pizza; decent wines (esp. the Cecchi Chianti); great salads (Ceasar and Caprese are excellent).  Nice, friendly wait staff.  The dining room is nice, a bit bare and the bar is small but the pizza and salads keep us coming back.",UNK
8944,Droves of flying bugs were on this hotel rooftop which made it very difficult to relax and enjoy the gorgeous view of the Notre Dame Basilica. Could also use more comfortable seating. \n\nService was really attentive and I recommend the clear sangria (elderflower and strawberries word!),UNK
8945,"Very good pediatrician. I am taking my  2 years old son since birth, I would highly recommend Dr. Robertson to anyone. I am not rating 5 star, because of even it is very easy to do appointment but it takes very long to wait.",UNK
8946,Always great food and atmosphere.  The steaks are terrific and the broasted chicken is top notch. Ask for Sam as your server.  He's attentive but not overbearing. A great experience that I was thrilled to share with my visiting family.,UNK
8947,"We had a decent experience over all, the chapel isn't tacky like I expected. However, the prices are outrageous. The photos are ridiculously over priced. The photographer didnt even make sure everyone could be seen in them. I'm VERY disappointed in the photo experience.",UNK
8948,SerendipiDONT\n\nSunday brunch. Worst restaurant experience of my life! We were served coffee & proceeded to wait an hour and a half- with many interactions with waitress & manager- and ended up leaving without having been served our food!,UNK
8949,"More than 11 dollars for one beer and one diet coke, and this was supposed to be happy hour. And that was before the tip. Which I now regret giving.  They were extremely slow waiting on us even though the place was empty. Lesson learned. Needless to say I won't be back.",UNK

8951,"The store is well organized, clean, and has a good selection of books. Great place to browse for used books.  I've never done any trade with them so I can't comment of that, but if they were closer I might try that. \nThe staff was friendly.",UNK
8952,"Best.Wings.Ever.  The honey bbq is the best and the meat just falls off of the bone, love that they are smoked instead of fried!  Wings + Mac n Cheese= a little bit of Heaven.  YUM!  \nGreat atmosphere for happy hour too, not too shabby on the eye candy either ; )",UNK
8953,good ass food---sweet potato fries are crispy.---ribs and pulled pork were really nice---great beer selection,UNK
8954,I went in one day for a Orange Julius and the machine was not working. A week later stopped in with some coworkers and chocolate cone wasnt available. A number of workers but awkward ordering and delivery system. I could not identify a supervisor/manager on duty during either visit.,UNK
8955,"We had a spectacular view from our room, overlooking MGM and the strip. Other than that, the room was pretty average. Nothing fancy, but at least it was spacious and clean.",UNK
8956,There was a cockroach in the bathroom. I didnt ask for one. I trapped it and they removed it and gave me 10% off.,UNK
8957,"Service (inside) was good, pizza (pepperoni) was quite tasty, Mushroom Risotto was average at best.  Would eat here again.",UNK
8958,Congratulations on selling mexican food with no flavor. Everything we had here was awful and bland. -1 star for this place.,UNK
8959,This place is alright but the mark up on their stuff is ridic. I only stop in here for some dog food and that's it. Anything else and you're getting robbed. Sometimes the lines can get jammed up too.,UNK
8960,"This place is perfect for a young crowd,it's a perfect spot to start your \""day drinking\"" or to catch a game. The beers are cheap, the bar is big and the service is excellent. Lots of young single people hanging around here during the day, tons of cute boys!",UNK
8961,"Love coming here,  the only complaint I have is that there is only 1 location. Service is great. Coffee is fantastic.  I recommend a blushing Gecko and a blueberry scone.",UNK
8962,"Fantastic food, great service, friendly staff. One of my favorite lunch spots in Charlotte. Try the Spicy Udon Noodle Soup and you will not be disappointed.",UNK
8963,Most overpriced margaritas I have ever had. And the salsa that came with the chips that I ordered tasted like it had come out of a can. The only reason they get any stars at all is because the balloon guy was pretty funny and entertaining.,UNK
8964,Excellent food.. Great people working behind the counter.. The pita are always fresh and there is never a long wait for your food. And the owner is almost always the one taking your order.,UNK
8965,I gotta give this place another try .. Only been once!  \n\nI ordered fa few oysters during happy hour and a lunch special.  Nothing special about either of the two.\n\nThe 4 star rating makes me feel like I should give it another try,UNK
8966,It was ok. The pineapple chicken fried rice was so gross.. The food wasn't hot and not the most flavorful. I wouldn't suggest this place.,UNK
8967,"Driving through from the Grand Canyon back to San Diego and found this place thanks to Yelp. It was delish! We had the Bosnian Soup, Stuffed Cabbage, some kind of pickled salad and the large sausage plate. The bread was amazing too! If you are in the area, you should definitely venture to this spot.",UNK
8968,Who can say no to Victoria's Secret? Don't expect much from customer service. They will have their  good and bad days. So just go into the stores with an idea of what you are looking for/wanting to buy.,UNK

8972,"I love St. Lukes you have saved my life. After being an inpatient for a week over a week ago, I have also been attending outpatient therapy for over a month now. Very caring staff but like the other reviewer said, if your a vegetarian watch out, there are limited options!",UNK
8973,"After giving this place a few more chances, I've come to discover their yellow curry to be PHENOMENAL! They also have a special pumpkin curry sometimes which is amazing as well. Definitely worth the trip for the curry alone. YUM.",UNK
8974,The bread here is good.   The flour tortillas are delicious.   The line could be crazy at times but well worth the wait.   As of now this is my favorite panaderia in the county.,UNK
8975,I have gone twice and the service was as bad as the first time.  The restaurant on Sunday night had 5 tables and it took forever to get waited on and to get our food.  We ate the whole meal with dirty plates and glasses on the table and my water glass was empty most of the time.  Horrible experience once again,UNK
8976,"I had breakfast here this morning for a business meeting and really enjoyed the entire experience. The food was great, the staff was wonderful and it was super cool to eat outside while watching the airplanes come and go!  I will definitely be coming back with my kidos.",UNK
8977,This is one of my favorite places for roast duck and roast pork their regular Asian food like kung pao chicken is very good as well.,UNK
8978,My friends and I came here on a wimp and ordered based on the pictures. The strawberry chicken pecan salad was extremely delicious and I'm not a vegetable type of person. Server was very kind and helpful as well. Definitely a must go if you're on the strip!,UNK
8979,Great unique gift idea and every time I shop there I get hooked up with some special offer. Its as though they know I can't leave with just one box.,UNK
8980,Dinner last night with 10 people.  The food was good even though they screwed the order up.  A little bit pricey but the serving was generous.  The chips and salsa were great.  The atmosphere was laid back.  I'll go back.,UNK
8981,Very knowledgable and professional. Unfortunate that their shutters are made in China. Would have liked to use them but couldn't overlook that.,UNK
8982,Avoid this place unless you want your antiquing experience ruined. I don't think the owner has all of her marbles.  She showed me some items that weren't priced yet then refused to another item that WAS priced saying it was too low! I won't be back.,UNK
8983,Tried to eat here about a month ago and there was a sign on the door saying they were closed for good. Haven't been back since to see if that is still the case.,UNK

8988,"Theaters 17-20 are upstairs and only accommodate 49 ppl, they will sell all seats so if you come with a date you will not get a good seat\nLines long for concessions, employees 16yrs old, walking around and incompetent",UNK
8989,"This has got to be one of my favorite places for Pizza in all of Pittsburgh!  When a pizza place does not have to deliver or even have a convenient place to park to pick up your carry out order, but is still slammed day in and out, it tells you something!  Secrets in the sauce!",UNK
8990,Good vegan choice.  The vegan cheese was not off putting on the pizza.  Decent pretzels.  I think i will skip the butter on the crust next time though.,UNK
8991,I have been to what feels like every Thai place in Arizona. This is definitely one of my favorites. This place has pickup and is reasonably priced. My only complaints would be that this place is a bit dingy and old.,UNK
8992,This Pharmaprix is pretty well stocked with pretty much anything you might need. They have a good selection of cosmetics and typical drugstore items as well as a decent selection of grocery items and magazines. The store is clean and relatively well organized.,UNK
8993,"Got carnitas.. good food, large portions.. service was o.k.  I wish it was more authentic.. I'm use to L.A. authentic mexican food..  looking for homemade salsa, mexican cheese and handmade tortillas!!",UNK
8994,"The deli employee, cassity, not sure on the spelling but what a bitch, we have mentioned her attitude to the customer service counter several times, but  it has no effect, friends in my neighborhood agree with me that this SOUP NAZI  of the Frye's deli must go.",UNK
8995,"Just an egg and cheese breakfast burrito, came with random grills scraps.  Just nasty.  Egg tasted like it was cooked with engine oil.",UNK
8996,"ordered the steak sandwich (medium rare).  Came out cooked medium.  Still very delicious.  French fries were not good, way too salty.  Server seemed as though he did not want to be there, with a grouchy attitude.",UNK
8997,"Good food, great atmosphere.  Enjoyed the visit and the good customer service.  They have an egg place card you can flip if you need anything, which is a great idea.  Coffee is a little weak.  4 stars great place for breakfast.  Plus I used their wifi to post this.",UNK
8998,"Great prices and styles, sometimes I find that i have to get 1 full size larger than I normally wear for the shoes to fit. And that puts me at a 10, so sometimes it's hard to find those sizes in the shows I want. Bought these 5 pair for $38 total!!!",UNK
8999,"Worse experience ever! I walked in for just a trim on the sides wanting to keep a manly side part cut and walked out with half my hair gone. The stylist said he was the owner, will not be coming back.",UNK
9000,This place is out of business. Their calls are being intercepted by some other tint outfit in Gilbert.  Verify before wasting your time like I did.,UNK
9001,The room itself was not bad and the prices are pretty good. Unfortunatly the maid service has a lot of room for improvement.  We had dirty towels in our bathroom and the general cleaning of said room was poor at best!,UNK

9004,"Just got a 4 piece meal and just love the chicken.  Best chicken I have had in Las Vegas since I moved here in 1980, hands down.  i will be a regular customer.  The fries, biscuits and cole slaw were also great.  Lucky for me this place is a short drive from my home.",UNK

9006,Food is great!  Happy hour is awesome!  Service is mostly good.  My favorite is the No. 2 roll and Salmon Carpacio on the Happy Hour menu...yum!!!!,UNK
9007,"Fate has great food, but lacks on every other level. I live three blocks away so its upsetting to see a place with so much potential fail.",UNK
9008,Size does not matter...  everyone complaining it is too small?  The racks are packed and I found the inventory to be stacked!  Found exactly what I was looking for and nearly bought a few additional backpacks...  they are on my mind!\n\nThe vets hanging out there are pretty cool too!,UNK
9009,"Yes, Woohoo, as good as it gets!  Awesome business.  The accommodated me as a visitor from NYC - I was only in Charlotte for a few days, but they were very helpful working with my schedule.  Not only that, but my daughter (dog:)) looked amazing when I picked her up!  Will go back!",UNK
9010,"Pretty good gyros and fries! I'm glad this place has a drive thru. I use to have to wait forever when I went thru the drive thru, but it has gotten much better. Prices are reasonable and the Greek salads are always fresh.",UNK

9013,"This is an obvious take on \""O\"". The venue is quite intimate and truly there isn't bad seat in the house. The production values are great but not the best I have seen. Some good music and special FX. The tickets are quite expensive. 3.5 Stars overall.",UNK
9014,"It's literally rock-n-roll!  I like how it was free before 12 and how it brings you back to the 80s!\n\nThe crowd is not that diverse, though.",UNK
9015,I've only been here 3 times in my life and all 3 times the service was terrible. I liked the food so I have it two stars. I will not be returning. And this last time which was last Friday was also the first time in my life I have ever tipped someone less than 20%,UNK
9016,My wife and I went here for a weekend getaway . Very nice rooms . Great restaurant and bar .Excellent service . Very accomindating . It's small in relation to the Fairmont Princess but much more intamate.Would go back in a second.,UNK
9017,"Seafood pasta with white sauce was delicious.  The appetizer with the calamari was rather tough, but the sauce was delicious.  I think the crispy fried calamari would have been better.  Their rolls were served warm and very soft...mmm!",UNK

9019,"Mmmmm....If you can get past the musty and damp carpet smell (prob from the \""lake\"" humidity), the food is pretty decent!!!! \n\nHey Buster's! Replace your carpet for Pete's sake (and clean it frequently once you do!)",UNK

9021,I'm not a great fan of Cirque du Soleil and this show is basically Naked C du S. Having said that it was entertaining and enjoyable. Probably the kind of grown up show that you should see once in your life.\n\nIf you are shy don't get seats at the front of the theatre.,UNK
9022,"Stopped for breakfast with our kids on a Saturday morning. The coffee and cinnamon bun were good, the breakfast burrito was so-so. Overall, not a bad coffee shop.",UNK

9027,I was lucky enough to have seen this show twice - once in the nosebleeds and once in baller seats and it was a night & day difference.  I still don't know what the plot is about but the acrobatics are amazing every time.,UNK
9028,ok after I wrote my last review they offered us 2 free nights . it was like the one we had long ago so it was pretty good. but was getting pretty old.but we had to fly out there again round trip.we stayed the 2 days there and stayed the rest of the time at rio.,UNK

9034,"I ordered wings... Never got them. The server was this blonde girl who had an attitude problem.  I left without eating because at that point, it was past 45 minutes.  I guess they are doing bad, they might really need the 8 bucks that my wings were.",UNK
9035,"Amazing prices, and the tacos taste so delicious and fresh! You eat outdoors so in the summer time it's pretty hot, but the food comes out quickly. Great place to take visitors or someone on a tight budget.",UNK
9036,It is always so beautiful here. This time we were here in March 2013. They had just changed from the Chinese New Year theme to beautiful butterfly theme. \nThis is a MUST DO in Las Vegas.,UNK
9037,Looked promising clean however on ordering the dolmades appetizer got the canned version. Quite disappointing. Next time I'll try their fresh cooked food,UNK
9038,"This place is great.   The menu is always changing, and I've never been disappointed.  The dogs, fries, tacos, sandwiches... everything is top-notch!",UNK
9039,"Not bad. Ate here the other night, service was decent. For an app I tried the butterfly shrimp which was pretty good. Had their chow mein for my main course and it was just alright. Not the best, but not too bad. I'll try again next time and see if I can update this review.",UNK
9040,"Great food, okay service.  Could use harder workers and people who are a little more attentive to the customers and less attentive to how they look.",UNK
9041,"Great wine store/bar.  I have been to several of their wine tastings, and I always enjoy myself.  Cute merchandise, great wine selections.  Very comfortable place.",UNK
9042,"This is a really good Thai restaurant. The food was excellent. We ordered clear noodles, awesome. Pad Thai with shrimp was perfect. My kids had the chicken skewers with peanut dip and loved it. There were no left overs because we ate everything up. MMMMMM. I highly recommend. We will be back.",UNK
9043,Our first server was rude and gave an attitude while we were trying to order. The wings were smaller than expected and it was unreasonably dry.,UNK
9044,I'm visiting Mesa from Denver and I'm burning up. Craving cold ice tea I came to Walgreens.  Bought it. And left feeling accomplished,UNK
9045,"Definitely not a good buffet experience in Vegas.The food is no big deal. The Sushi quality disappointed me, dry rice and few options and also few options of seafood. The staff are not friendly and polite. Takes forever to replace used plates and to refill beverage. I would recommend other buffet.",UNK
9046,"I love Jamba Juice... Just not this one on Power Road. I've given the place three tries after they completely botched my order the first time. They never get it right. Plus, the staff here was always super rude.",UNK
9047,"Came here for the 4th of July Philharmonic fireworks. While we loved the fireworks display, it happened 30-35 later than the advertised time. Too hot to be waiting outside. Hopefully they work out the kinks for next year's show.",UNK
9048,"Before coming here, we didn't think it was possible to have BAD Mexican food. (Heck, we'll even take Taco Bell.) The meat here was cold and the flavor was awful. Don't come here unless you're a big fan of Chef Boyardee.",UNK
9049,Great place. Tons of meat. If you're in to Grilled meat this is the place for you. A bit on the pricey side especially with all the buffets in Vegas.  Good service and atmosphere. A great place for a group dinner.,UNK
9050,"I will not be ordering from here again. The only good thing I ordered was the cream cheese wontons. All of the vegetables had a really funky taste, and the garlic chicken had no garlic flavor.",UNK
9051,Steve and his crew do an excellent job at a reasonable price. They also deal well with last minute changes not charging us an arm and a leg for add-ons.  Sometimes management and crew don't communicate well otherwise we were pretty happy with the final results.,UNK
9052,Usually I like this store but not this time...the whole time there was a dude standing outside my dressing room and the store employees could care less so of course it was a bit uncomfortable :/,UNK

9056,"These guys are great! Always professional, engaging, on time, and always go out of their way to make you feel comfortable.  Doesn't hurt that one of the docs is easy on the eyes. ;) Just sayin. I would highly recommmend this place to get those chompers clean and perfect!!",UNK

9059,"I do not like it. Period. It looks old, pretentious and dark. The coffee....meh... it is ok, but not so perfect.... The place is kinda old, or looks  old and I cannot understand why people think this is a perfect place to study....",UNK
9060,"Looked like a charming, cozy place for drinks with friends but don't go for more than appetizers.  Service was very slow.  So long, in fact, they charged me dinner price although I was sitting & waiting since happy hour.   All the food was very greasy.  Another long wait to get bill & doggie box.",UNK
9061,"I used to love Rosati's Pizza, but something happened and now this location is horrible. The guy at the front counter won't answer direct questions and the double dough sausage pizza I ordered was very thin and had barely any sauce, cheese or sausage. All around it was a horrible experience and I definitely won't be back here.",UNK
9062,"poor in room Quality, but Close in Atmosphere.  The Hotel seemed more personal, not too extreme.  staff is friendly.  The gift Shop sales Liquor and I won $500 one night and $1600 the next on the same machine.",UNK
9063,"We had a groupon here, so we gave it a shot. The food was good and the ingredients were of good quality, but the flavor was just so-so. At full prices it wasn't such a great value for the money, the portions were somewhat small and the salad was boring.",UNK
9064,"Greasy , Wet , soagy . They were out of chicken, so i got a mixed of what ever they had left.",UNK
9065,"These guys are awesome!  They came out on short notice, were very friendly and thorough, had no problem with a large spill on my white carpet, and were gone in under 45 minutes.  They even gave me tips on keeping my carpet clean in between appointments!",UNK
9066,Eh Meh Bleh... Fancy.. good service.. annnnnnnnnnnnnnd.. I think that's about it. Food.. its really whatever..,UNK
9067,"Brian tinted my wife's Lexus and it turned out good, very cool guy. He did a very clean job, no problem.",UNK
9068,"The food here is amazing!, why isn't this place booming?  I don't understand - the service is amazing and the food is super tasty",UNK
9069,"Sorry but we have been to a few Vegas shows like Le Dream, Jersey Boys and a few others, but for money we paid out it just wasn't worth it, they should of had more acts more action, I could have gone to a strip joint and paid less",UNK
9070,"I came here for a quick stop to get some strips to snack on throughout the night. It is definitely fast food like you'd expect. While I can't say it is bad, I also can't say it was good.\n\nNext time I will stick to Cane's instead of using Church's.",UNK

9075,My co-workers and I came here for lunch. We ordered the chicken nachos and found two long hairs in them. It was totally gross. Other than that the food is ok.,UNK
9076,"Terrible music. The guys handling the line were ridiculous and were making everyone go around, upstairs, downstairs etc. Again, the DJ was just terrible.",UNK
9077,"Amazing! Had a 25 minute wait around 11 on a Monday, not too shabby! Fast and friendly service and for a breakfast food junkie like me, it was heaven. Huge portions and the biscuits are a gift from the gods.",UNK
9078,Karaoke & Trivia nights are my main reason for coming back week after week. Bartenders are awesome & drink specials are also great.,UNK
9079,"Go in with an appetite !! Don't underestimate the small tacos, they are filling. Be sure to top it off with some Bourbon Lemonade, and if you're the hungry type, try the chicken bucket and the ribs. AMAZEBALLS.",UNK
9080,Street tacos are not good but salsa and chips are awesome as well as taco salad! Atmosphere is ok and manager was willing to give a replacement meal for the nasty street tacos!,UNK
9081,"We've been here twice now, and both times have been great! The service and food are both top notch. \nI got the bone in ribeye my wife got the New York strip, both were cooked perfectly. The sides and sauce options are all very good. A little pricey but expected in Cave Creek, well worth the drive.",UNK
9082,"Spaghetti sauce was super meaty and hearty, the carrot cake was one of the best I've had, and service was a lot better than people are suggesting it is. Next time I'll try dining a little more adventurously at this place and see what else they have!",UNK
9083,"Thanks again enterprise, my wife really didn't need you to pick her up like promised...she had no problem waking in the middle of the day,  it was only 110 outside.  At least the idiot behind the counter,  gave us $10 off.  Terrible service!!!!  Will not use again",UNK
9084,I love this place the food is always great and super fresh. I think what differentiates this place from the others is their pita bread is so fresh it's almost crispy.  The customer service is awesome as well I will definitely go back.,UNK
9085,"Best pizza we have found in Phoenix area so far.  Delicious sweet sauce and nice thick Chicago crust.\n\nWings are good, not great.\n\nStaff is always helpful!",UNK
9086,"ok, I still love the tacos and burritos from here, but now they don't take cash. still no iced tea and the patio area in the summer time is miserable.\nit will probably be a while before a I go here again, unless I actually have some cash on me, which is rare.",UNK
9087,Besides having a Starbucks in here this is one of the best places to stop and get a peace of mind away from the hustle and bustle,UNK
9088,"Las Vegas Web Design did an amazing job & we wholeheartedly recommend them to all our colleagues & associates as the \""full package deal\"" a great team of cutting edge talent, dedication & passion for web design & development.

9091,Best buy on the west side of madison has a serious problem with the quality of the pavement for their parking lot. Every lane has a pothole the is at least 2 feet wide. Also I thought that the staff not knowing what the internet sale was pretty sad.,UNK

9095,"Food was nothing special, but the waitresses were very cute.  Pretty good service too.  I'd rank this one above hooters for the same cute girls, but a little bit better in the food department.  The decor was nice, but not Hawaiian.",UNK
9096,I've ended up here to end many a drunk nights out. The staff have always been friendly and I usually always get the same thing since I've had pretty much everything else. It's always been good here.,UNK
9097,Great sandwich to have when you are just in the mood for some quick grub. It's very filling. Can't beat the price and the location. If you love to people watch just sit facing Hawaiian Tropic.,UNK
9098,"The clerk was extremely helpful and, because she was preggers too, truly did understand my needs. She was very personable and knowledgeable.",UNK
9099,Please be nice to the people gambling their pension and social security checks at this silent yet smoky casino. They don't have long to live.,UNK
9100,"I really wasn't that impressed.  Plastic table cloth and the place smelled kind funky too.  I got the bone in ribeye - and it definetely wasn't the best steak in the area.  Wine selection is rather lacking.  I'd hit the many alternatives before this; Flemings, Capital, Ruth...",UNK
9101,Turkey burger prepared in the same fashion as the Deluxe burger is amazing!  Add a basket of sweet potato fries and you're in heaven!,UNK
9102,"Usually have a good meal here.  Occasionally, the pizza is burned on the edges, but we love the Caesar salad, and the bruschetta is good, too.  The service is generally timely.  Definitely will frequent again.",UNK
9103,"I was here for my 21st birthday. It was a lot of fun, but it was rather small. It felt like they were double their max capacity. The dj was awesome, but again the dance floor was too small and crowded :(",UNK
9104,"No Wifi. Cash only for most of the hotel services, such as room service.\nPool closes at 7pm. Need I say more???\nAvoid this place, and it's connected resorts. Unless you have Motel 6 expectations.",UNK
9105,"Stopped in for a piece of carrot cake to go.  Not impressed. The icing was very heavy on butter and the cake was extra oily,  presumably to keep it most for longer.  However,  I will come back and try their food and then update my review... But for now,  skip the cake!",UNK
9106,"Identical to Roberto's in every way I can distinguish.  Not great, but not bad either.  I usually go for a chimichanga or asada fries.  Both are constantly good.  The restaurant is clean and has plenty of room for eating.",UNK
9107,Restaurant has a great Parisian look- so quaint and cozy however I've been twice where several items on the menu were not available so selection is sparse. The burger is mouth watering and bread roll is very fresh. What is available is delicious so enjoy!,UNK
9108,"Sunday morning!\nTake-out \nWarm Waffles stuffed with chocolate and banana with sprinkle of powder sugar = GREAT\nService was very slow 1 person taking order, serving and cooking :(\nPrice 3$ a piece (1 is not enough)",UNK
9109,"Staff was wonderful, rooms a bit dated, we were out in the back 40 and had to depend on calling a valet to pick us up.  Will probably call ahead next time to make sure we have a golf course view and closer to parking.",UNK
9110,Generally quiet \nComfortable bed\nRenovations needed\nLackluster breakfast\nGreat service very friendly,UNK
9111,"Go for appetizers, eat dinner elsewhere.  \n\nAll of our starters were great (far better than the entrees).  Of particular interest were the tiger shrimp & roasted garlic tamales.  They earned the 3rd star for this review all by themselves.",UNK
9112,For standard breakfast food this is just ok.  The problem is there is not a whole lot around the Nugget to get breakfast.  If you stick to the basics it will be average.  The service for us the morning we ate here was very slow.,UNK
9113,The staff was super friendly.  They messed up my order but she rectified it quickly. My husband had the macayo tour meal and the portions were very small. Also the margaritas were very weak and tasted like water.  Although the staff was very friendly this is not a place I would visit again when I come back to Phoenix.,UNK
9114,"Really excellent excellent service. The hamburger was off the charts, as we're the flatbreads. Brussels sprouts were perfect' and reasonably priced wine list was a plus.\n\nWill absolutely be back",UNK
9115,I absolutely love their chips and salsa which they offer to you free. The customer service here is excellent and have always had prompt service and the meals have come to you fast. Beers and happy hour is an excellent time to go and just relax. The only thing I thought was annoying was the floor fans that are along the bar.,UNK
9116,Great shop.  I can't 89 agile why anybody would complain about speed of service.  Slow is better when doing mods.  This ain't jiffy lube.,UNK
9117,"I truly love golds. Clean facility , friendly staff, and my favorite part : the cardio cinema ! Not to mention the wonderful personal trainers, namely Jamie. She is always friendly and motivating. I've learned so many great work outs that I can easily replicate at home. The prices are reasonable as well.",UNK
9118,This place is very dangerous when there are lots of drivers and there usually is. Not worth a severe neck and back injury. I had a  guy plow into me after the race. And the kicker they serve Alcohol so there are drunks racing with you!,UNK
9119,"Good drink menu and good neighborhood place but not a destination restaurant be any means.  We enjoyed the food, especially the halibut.  It's tucked into a side street and is easy to miss.  It would be hard for me to go here instead of FnB since they are so close togeather.",UNK
9120,This place is great! Very clean and great massage. Prob better than most massages I have received in a spa. Plan on returning as much as possible. Great prices.,UNK
9121,"Never had a bad meal here and the service is awesome. I recommend \""Lucy\"" as your server. I only come for breakfast but am always happy. I'm here right now!",UNK
9122,We went there once looking for a place with decent thai food. This place is decent. It has the standard thai dishes. Bubble tea was good too.,UNK
9123,"This place is terrible. It smells like rotten food and looks old and dirty. The woman who runs the shop is rude. She will also lie to you about how quickly she can have your clothes ready. This happened to me twice and unfortunately, I was really depending on her to have my dress ready. I will never go back.",UNK
9124,"Yuck....would have been really upset had I paid for this. It's like cafeteria food. I love the resort and casino, but this buffet is not good.",UNK
9125,I was fortunate to stay there for an evening and found good food great accommodations friendly helpful people. Met a pit boss named Steve and a clerk named Grace. Really enjoyed this. A must place to see play and stay.,UNK
9126,"Primanti bros has the best corned beef sandwich in the east, and the coleslaw, fries and tomato right on the sandwich made it totally unique. Oh and they also have a great craft beer selection.",UNK
9127,"In a word: decent. This is the salty variety of Asian food with canned-tasting sauces and meat. It's about as good as the frozen dinners you can get at the grocery store, but it costs more.",UNK
9128,"Ok yes, it is a little shady. But hot damn is it my guilty pleasure. \n\nIf you want that traditional American-Chinese food that we have all had since we were kids go here. Drinks are totally from 1950's. Love it.",UNK
9129,"Nice place, the food was ok I had a sandwich which was slightly above a mediocre deli grade sandwich. Not impressed I heard good things about the food, but it's nothing to brag about. I did go in on a Sunday which was also 4th of July the service was great but the food not so much...",UNK
9130,This is perfect breakfast to recover from an amazing night! They serve large portions of food and I was stuffed after finishing my meal. I highly recommend this place. I'd definitely come here next time I come to Vegas!,UNK
9131,"Very disappointed that they stopped giving the $2.00 off meal if you filled out the customer servey online.  That was one of the reasons why we would choose this palce to begin with!\n\nOther than that, they have great food, and the service is always great!",UNK
9132,"Love, love, love this restaurant.  I've had so many special times at the restaurant with great friends and loved ones.  It is loud and bustling - they brought the ambiance of NYC from their original place.  Superb steaks.  Just terrific - no other way to describe it.",UNK
9133,If your time is limited yet you value your health and fitness Raw is the place...l get so much done in just one hr. the trainers are very passionate about what they do and craft every workout to keep you coming back next day wanting more..,UNK
9134,"Consistently the best Mexican food in Vegas in a gorgeous restaurant!  The beef enchiladas with red sauce are my favorite and a must try.  Great prices, fun atmosphere and good service.......consistently!",UNK
9135,"Love it here. I like Thit Nuong, the best. The staff is slow because there are only one guy. The other guy is the owner. Think they should hire more people. Otherwise, anything else is good.",UNK
9136,My advice just go here for the drinks not the food. The drinks and desserts are the highlights of this place the food is mediocre.,UNK
9137,Walked in last night hoping to have a nice pie and great beer but they took off Four Peaks Kilt Lifter.  I quickly went elsewhere.  Why do they replace such a good selling staple?,UNK
9138,"A great place with good food, friendly people, and french fries with brown gravy. They got 4 stars just for that alone. Plus they are now on Groupon so you get to check it out and realize just what you've been missing. Remember the fries with gravy and finish with the pie!",UNK
9139,"Definitely not worth the money! Boxed mac and cheese tastes better. Weird flavor of just the mac and cheese (with not enough cheese), with crappy mix ins.",UNK
9140,Kudos for bringing sunshine and great coffee from the big Wash!!!! Viva Snohomish!!!!\n\nGreat location right across from Humble Pie & The Main Ingredient.\n\n6 blocks north of I-10 & 7th St. West side of the street.,UNK
9141,"Service was absolutely incredible!!! The wine was Awesome. The calamari was a bit chewy. The filot mignon was a bit salty, the overall quality was outstanding. The menu has a vast selection!!",UNK
9142,"We ate here on our way out of the city.  I thought there'd be decent food here but this adds to the perception that airport food is not that good.\n\nI really don't have much to say except that if you're on your way out, don't stop by here.",UNK
9143,"A longer wait than expected with only one person before me. Also they called in my prescription but transposed the cross streets of the pharmacy. I got a call from the store at 91st ave vs 19th ave, pretty disappointing when you're in pain. Due to this mistake I didn't get my pain medication the day I should have.",UNK
9144,"Staff was friendly. BBQ can be subjective considering the variety of styles. Our party personally did not enjoy the food. That being said, it does seem to be a popular restaurant in the area.",UNK
9145,"Cynthia and her team there are great, she was very helpful and my palce has never looked better\n\nJon Nader",UNK
9146,"Cinnamon and sugar on sweet potato fries. Not what should come with a burger! Buffalo Wild Wings, where ya at? Good beers.",UNK
9147,"Fun morning stop, locals chatting dogs walking etc etc. this was more an activity than a shopping trip. Would have enjoyed it more if it wasn't 110 out\n\nI got some dog treats and salsa. Both I was happy with. Some tents took credit cards and some didn't.",UNK
9148,"Nothing beats going to a cool chippie like this at 2am after a great night out and having a fried pizza summer. I miss living in Scotland for that meal alone. My waist thanks me though. There is nothing better than that greasy, crispy taste of a fried pizza. BOSS.",UNK
9149,"No website for shopping? Over priced tourist trap!! Save your vacation time!\nHistory Channel is obviously paying the bills.. Sorry, just keeping it real as these are not celebrities they are pawn store employees!!!!!!!!",UNK
9150,Came for a drink and my friend for a bit of food. The staff was not too helpful and was pushing us to order. Thw drinks were fine. When and if i go back i might change my mind as one bad experience. However. It was a cute area. Nice for a quiet night out with drinks.,UNK
9151,Get the green curry and don't look back. It's a strong move. I love how healthy this place can be and the food is not processed. I feel like this is how home cooking would be if my mom was Asian. A little expensive though.,UNK
9152,"It is your standard Best Buy. I recently purchased a digital camera here. While it took awhile for the sales rep to acknowledge me and ask if I needed help, once he did, he was able to provide good service and make some helpful recommendations.  He didn't try to \""upsell\"" me, and rang things up quickly.",UNK
9153,"Use to be my favorite AYCE in LV, I wish they take items of the AYCE menu.....I would go out of my way to this place. Now I ratter try new AYCE joints in town.",UNK
9154,This place is a typical cheap dive-y spors bar. It had the feel of an American Legion hall. \n\nI felt much better about my life after seeing some of the regulars there.,UNK
9155,The quality has gone down compared to about half a year ago. Crab legs and prime ribs are so so. The desserts are below average.,UNK
9156,I have problems with ordering delivery..being that my order is wrong and typically missing stuff. I used to like the pizza but for some reason lately it seems bland if not undercooked like the cheese is really white...I always have to put it in the oven for a few more minutes.,UNK
9157,they had this special when i was there in june.. 2 patron shots for $10!! (during 10pm-11pm i think)  that means $5 per shot of patron!!  we took quite a few shots here before heading to XS. \n\nfun times.,UNK
9158,"Thought the repairs would be $160-170 for a belt and motor bolts. Turned out to be $1600-1700. Apparently this is a normal price, but they could have at least been clear and concise when telling me the price. Avoiding Midas from now on.",UNK
9159,This owner of this company will try to intimidate first then finally offer to pay for good reviews to try to cover up their shady practices.  See screen shots uploaded.,UNK
9160,"The family meals here are a good deal.  They provide a lot of food for a reasonable price.  Quality is decent.  Usually the meals will include soup, a veggie dish, some meat dishes, and a dessert.",UNK
9161,The shredded beef tacos and chips and salsa are Devine!!!!!!  The people are friendly and will make anything to order,UNK
9162,"It's what a dive bar is all about.  Great atmosphere,  outstanding jukebox and a very good bar staff.  I'll not come to Vegas again without a stop in.",UNK
9163,"The sushi was delicious! price was pretty reasonable as well. The service could have been a bit better, but other than that, everything was to my liking :) The atmosphere was nice too.",UNK
9164,Decent pizza with enough variety. Not the best pizza ever but good enough. Really friendly and helpful stuff. Not so cheap though....,UNK
9165,"All of my Culture Pass issues were taken care of by contacting Act One directly. They have called and explained to Amanda, and hopefully all other employees of this branch, how a Culture Pass works.",UNK
9166,My boyfriend showed me this place yesterday and I was immediately attracted to the Pink Box! I bought a dozen for my boyfriends mom and she LOVED them! Donuts are delish!! Wish there was one in Henderson/Green Valley area!! I'm definitely coming back soon!!,UNK
9167,This place has good food I think...I don't remember much.\nI only know how much I paid...the next day using the Bank of America app...\n\nCome here if you won a lot from gambling..otherwise stick with Earl's Sandwiches.,UNK
9168,"Surprised to discover this little gem with my buddy.  And loooong happy hour on Tuesday nights so that's great!  Love the Rogue Hazelnut Brown ale and the two for one \""1810\"" cream ale is the bomb. Marsha was awesome and very helpful suggesting all the best drinks.  Love it",UNK
9169,"This is a great place to go in Montreal. The view of the city is spectacular. The park and flowers are really beautiful. After you're done, you can have a drink and some lunch at the restaurant in the park. What's better than that?",UNK
9170,It's a dirty location with a foul smell of piss inside. From my short visit it's apparent their main clientele are transient.,UNK
9171,Place is great and dog friendly! I'm giving 2 stars coz I got my car back from the valet and smelled like burnt rubber. FYI my car has manual transmission. I don't trust their valet anymore. Vdara needs to tell their valet people to respect our cars when they drive it. Big disappointment.,UNK
9172,This is an excellent movie theater. The theaters are kept clean. I don't drink alcohol but they started serving alcoholic drinks by the concession stand. (It was good for my friends that wanted to get a little buzzed before the movie starts.),UNK
9173,"I went there when I was in arizana I got the buffalo hamburger It was amazing. The service was great. There soda could be change to coke, sprite. It was very welcoming.",UNK
9174,"Decent sports bar with an open floor plan.  It's cool to walk in and quickly pan the place to see what the vibe is.  I've only been here late night on Saturdays and it's usually a pretty mellow crowd just \""watchin' the game, havin' a Bud...\""",UNK
9175,Good value. Second visit. Group stop. Food to and fresh. Better when 1st open. Decent variety but for classic Chinese vs American Chinese buffet. Service good. Prompt cleanup. Clean newer restaurant. 3.75 stars based on my second rating.  This one is a 4 today. Visit if you prefer this food.,UNK
9176,"I absolutely love the PFChang's-style food at PeiWei! The staff is efficient, friendly, and knowledgeable. I always recommend PeiWei to friends and family and we have nothing but praise!",UNK
9177,My friends and I came here twice during our visit partially because we were staying at the Wynn and because it was so delicious the first time. We literally sat for hours so we could digest and then eat more. There was just too much enticing food to handle! Be sure to check out the dessert waffles.,UNK
9178,This place is just basic.  Room AC did not cool the room very well.  The door lock did not work.  There was a hole in the wall behind the door. Shower was good and the bed comfortable.  Breakfast was minimal.  I will not go back.,UNK
9179,Worst experience ever with a resort. from the roaches to.the terrible customer service. no house keeping. it's been an hour and a half and still waiting to.speak with management. definitely pulling my items  and leaving,UNK
9180,Do not use Dane as your porperty manager.  He allowed property vacant for months. He does not answer the phone calls and does not return the phone calls either.,UNK
9181,"The food was as good as advertised but the service was not. We sat down for 15-20 min before anyone even said a word to us. Finally, a waiter who didn't even work in our area helped us out.",UNK
9182,"This place has become \""that spot\"" for my partner and I. They have hosted many of our first dates as well as other special occasions over the years. It is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix. \nDrink the white sangria. Eat the margarita Pizza. You will not be disappointed.",UNK
9183,"Hey I think this place is great the bagels are fresh, the salads are fresh, and the Black and White cookies are out of this world. The people are nice and the everything is ready quickly. If you want, need, have to have a great bagel, this is the place to go.",UNK
9184,Sushi was very fresh and enjoyable. Would recommend the spicy tuna. The miso soup was good and they didn't skimp on the tofu. Service was good. Will go back when I'm in the southpark area again. The only thing I disliked was they didn't have a large selection of specialty rolls.,UNK
9185,"Waitress was kind enough to visit on rare occasion, customer service in general sucks....Nick Nicholson was the only good reason to stay in the building and the only reason I would bother to return.",UNK
9186,I love this place. Staff is always nice and welcoming. Pho broth is delicious. They give you enough of everything. Always fill up your water.,UNK
9187,"Staff was nice however food quality very poor. My meal was a ribeye steak, half of it was fat and the veggies were bland. My boyfriend got the prime rib it was completely raw on the inside, pretty sure it was still mooing. First and last time I will ever go there. Would also give a zero if possible.",UNK
9188,I love the fact that happy hour is available  most of the day  . The place is small but always busy . I like their combination plates their California  rolls are the best in town . We love their spicy shrimp rolls  their teriyaki sauce is very flavorful. Their tempura has  many choices and a large amount of choices which are reasonably priced,UNK
9189,I've been back a couple times since my last review and it is safe to say the pizza is still amazing!  I have ventured out to salads and their famous dulce dessert (I highly recommend it!) and have never been disappointed.,UNK
9190,The pro shop is great and the prices are some what reasonable.  The automated tee is cool too.  One thing I didn't like is that there is not ant grass...just mats.  the mats are nice but some real grass to hit off would be better...even if it were just a few hitting stations.,UNK
9191,"A nice hotel in appearance, however the staff is condescending and rude.  House cleaning also never visted our room during our stay.  It was a very poor experience overall.",UNK
9192,"Verrrrrrrrrry good. Nice atmosphere friendly staff. I had fried green tomatoes, grits, , greens & the house salad. All were awesome! But the best of the best was the dessert Chocolate sweet potato cheesecake!",UNK
9193,"$25 really is not bad for a pedicure.  Actually, that's about average for a large city.  If not on the cheap side.  This is a no frills pedicure.  Standard buff and polish with a nice foot and leg massage.  Kim is super nice and did a great job!",UNK
9194,Couldn't be any friendlier.  Where do they get these employees?  The espresso was just okay--a bit ashy.,UNK
9195,Terrible customer service and my drink tastes like crap infused drinkable chalk. Terrible customer service and my drink tastes like crap infused drinkable chalk. Terrible customer service and my drink tastes like crap infused drinkable chalk. Terrible customer service and my drink tastes like crap infused drinkable chalk.,UNK
9196,The manager did send a response which did help my mood on this location. I will try another visit to give them another chance. :0) I will let you know the outcome. I'm confident that it will be a better experience.,UNK
9197,Great place! Breakfast is amazing. Also the chicken fried chicken and steak. The portions are big and great for kids too they have toys for them to play with,UNK
9198,Love the stars!  But you can get them online cheaper.  The other lighting that they carry is WAY overpriced and quite antiquated.,UNK
9199,Waited 40 minutes with no apologies or explanation. So obnoxious.  Walked out and will NEVER return. There are far too many other restaurants in town with stellar service that we will choose to spend our money.,UNK
9200,"\""The bitterness of low quality remains long after the sweetness of a low price is forgotten\"".....I have been going to these guys for years now and would never trust my vehicles to anyone else, they work on all japanese and american cars.",UNK
9201,Ate dinner here last night and we did not enjoy it at all. First sushi place that the shrimp was not cleaned out. Soooooooo grosssss! Service was really slow and they weren't very busy. Really disappointed and most def not going back.,UNK
9202,Don't waste your money on a jimmy johns sandwich. There is nothing special about these sandwiches. This is the worst sandwich shop I have been to. You will get a better sandwich by making one at home.,UNK
9203,The food was really good along with the service but the prices were much too High. I loved how the place gives you such a comfortable feeling though. The chips and salsa were DELICIOUS.,UNK
9204,"This a great place to buy shoes for small children. It is right next to the distribution center, so they have every shoe/size in existence. The sales woman was very helpful and explained how the insole system works. It is a little hard to find, so bring the address and GPS.",UNK
9205,"Stopped and grabbed a sandwich, wanted something different than subway tonight.....italian beef with cheese and hot peppers.....not bad!!",UNK
9206,Went in at 8:55 and the girl said they closed at 8:45 and the machines were already turned off. \nWent to walgreens and picked up some pints for my kids instead.,UNK
9207,"I love the Red Rock Casino, but the kids have ruined this theater.  If you must go, don't look down.  The carpets are gross and really need a change.  Otherwise, they always have a good selection of movies, an IMAX theatre, and they even have a party room if you'd like to throw one there.",UNK
9208,"This place is entertaining as hell.  It was a lot of fun to watch seven or so baseball games at once, and the beer selection was massive.  Unfortunately I got so sick from the food that I had to stay in my hotel room for the rest of the night and miss Cirque du Soliel.",UNK
9209,"I know it's soon to be writing an update, but I wanted to compliment Daniel again. I had to leave before dawn (5 am, shudder). Again, he was five minutes early and the quoted price was great. Support local businesses, especially the ones that hire friendly people and provide good value.",UNK
9210,Great place for lunch.  Loved the atmosphere which had a lot of character with all of the wooden paneling and furniture.  It's supposed to be Thai noodle street market style dishes.  The prices are very reasonable and everything was delicious and spiced well.,UNK
9211,The regular rooms are a bit smaller than other hotels that I've stayed in.  Try to request for upper floors and away from the main building.  It could get pretty noisy.,UNK
9212,"Great pleace, very nice inside the people were very nice,  great to talk to and I felt welcome.  My nails came out great ( I love them ) will be going back and re commending them to everyone I know.",UNK
9213,Love the roast beef panini. The cheese on it is great. It's an order several times item.\n\nThe chicken salad is good for when I am trying to be good.\n\nI am totally in love with the iced tea.,UNK
9214,"Excellent selection of spices, great staff, awesome location.  This is a must stop on The Strip.  There were definitely more than a few things I wanted to purchase in this store.  Can't wait to head back!",UNK
9215,This hotel needs so much work..the service here is completely dead !! we stayed a room that was amazing but other than that it was bad. The pool attendants the cocktail servers the security should all be fired.,UNK
9216,Went there last night to get my home key made.  Saw a uniformed Phoenix Police officer in the store.  Not sure if this is a one-time thing or they always have an officer on-duty.  But overall service was great and fast.  Definitely a place to go to for all your hands on projects.,UNK
9217,"Not. Good.  Shameful Korean food and side dishes being served up to unsuspecting, nice white folks. Why is the soft tofu soup lukewarm?  Where is the egg?  Where is the stone bowl rice? Why are the side dishes so bad?    I'm ashamed for you, Red Kimchi!",UNK
9218,"The Choice Hotel chain continues to be my preferred properties of the mid-$ range hotels.  The only issue I had with this one was the noisy A/C unit in the hallway right outside the door.  Other than that, it was clean with a friendly staff.",UNK
9219,"This place is a gem! Not only is it super convenient from my house (love to go for an evening walk with the hubby to this spot), but their yogurt is amazing! The staff is fabulous & the store is clean.",UNK
9220,Very disappointing overall.  Granted it was New Year's Eve but...  They charge for bread.  Food was OK (Chef burnt one of our steak but the cost was removed from our bill).  It appears there wasn't enough servers and other help.   We would not return.,UNK
9221,The place was a nice relaxed place to eat. Environment was laid back. Host and waiter were both friendly. Our waiter was excellent. \nHad a burger and it was good. Nothing great or different. But tasty none the least. \nWould return. Might try the sushi next time,UNK
9222,"Cindy and Mick are owners of the Stand and make great red chili and fry bread among other items on the menu. I have stood in line only to be told \""sold out\"" because the food is that good. Come early and you won't be disappointed.",UNK
9223,"Review regarding Dim Sum: I used to come here a lot, and it used to be good. When I heard they had dim sum, I was so happy. When they brought the first tray, I wanted to leave. They have a very small selection, and it made me want to cry.",UNK
9224,"Great patio and service, but the food is pretty bad. It's hard to mess up guacamole, and they even managed to do that. Come for a drink, but go somewhere else for dinner",UNK
9225,The pizza was ok. The garlic knots were dinner rolls. The hero sandwich was decent at least it had cappy on it.  But overall a bit disappointed when the service was the best part of the meal. And she was nice..,UNK
9226,"I am not sure why the hype for Freddy's.  2.5 start at the best.  The burgers are ok (meat is so thin, you can  almost see through it), fries are good, frozen custard is ok.  Maybe I like my burgers a little meatier?",UNK
9227,"Really another very good lunch! Tried the pizza this time  10\"" Sausage-Onion-Pepper and I was impressed. Great crust and very good ingredients.  Much better than expected and I am a super critic with pizza due to my Chicago roots. \nService was great again! Love their outdoor area",UNK
9228,Best spray tan ever! They have Custom colors for a natural look. They are all so friendly and fun!! \nFor great deals make sure you opt in their text program! They offer natural teeth whitening and lash extensions too. This is truly an amazing place!!,UNK
9229,"I just wanted to add an update for sound quality for the bands... sometimes it's really bad and sometimes it can't be beat....  \n\nAgain, the friendliness and service are always right on- great atmosphere.",UNK
9230,"Wonderful food.  Service is not consistent.  Fun.  A variety of food.  Great people watching!  However the waitresses can ignore you!  I know from sitting at the counter that the food is preparted fast, wish the waitresses could be more efficient.\nBeen there twice once in June and once last month.",UNK
9231,The best Walmart I've been too. Very clean & well stocked. The same employees have been working there since it opened and they are very welcoming to shoppers.,UNK
9232,"Mmmm! Favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma!!!!!! Great food, and even better staff!!!! You guys are the BEST!!!!",UNK
9233,"Incredible friendly, casual environment with superb service and fantastic menu.  Our table grew in size as friends unexpectedly arrived, the staff was more than gracious and accommodating.  We sampled drinks, appetizers, entrees and even some items off the menu.  Table-wide, consensus was \""Fantastic!\""",UNK
9234,This was a fun club over priced but not bad. \nAnother late review just just so that i can add to the now closed list.,UNK
9235,"This place is big nasty.  NASTY!  Perkins isn't much better.  Just go to any of the downtown Champaign bars, most of them serve food until pretty late and you won't get food poisoning - big plus!",UNK
9236,Really disappointing service.  This restaurant was in my regular list but not anymore.  I sat at the bar for 10 minutes at lunch and didn't have a single employee acknowledge my presence.  I wasn't greeted at the door either.  This is lunch hour.  No wonder the parking lot is empty! !!,UNK
9237,"Great place,  excellent service and a pretty dang good selection of all you can eat sushi and appetizers. There was a little bit of a wait for a party of 6 but it was Friday night close to 5 so not to bad considering. Definitely on my short list of great all you can eat vegas sushi joints.",UNK
9238,"Lazy service, overpriced food.  OK only if you want to pool-watch.  Better food at the same price point is available at Cafe Society at Encore for breakfast or brunch.",UNK
9239,This place is awesome!! A great pick for a group who loves a variety on a budget. It's style is fantastic for my husband and I to get exactly what we want for half of what we pay at any 'ol sushi bar. We would recommend this place to anyone who will listen,UNK
9240,"Went for the first time on Sunday and I was pleasantly surprised. Stephanie was so knowledgable and everything she recommended was exactly perfect...plus she was so nice and attentive. \n\nThe risotto with scallops was simply amazing.  I cannot wait to go again although, I should...",UNK
9241,"The Rio is an older hotel with old Las Vegas style. They have a show called \""Show In The Sky\"" with singing and dancing. They throw beads and you can catch them.",UNK
9242,My favorite pizza place when I come to visit my family up this way. Worked at one when I was 16 lol. Husband loves the thin crust pizza. Breadsticks are great too,UNK
9243,The food was good. Didn't get many choices for spirits. The service was not what I would consider to be at par. Didn't get our waters refilled even once the whole time we were there. But the food was awesome for how much the total bill was.,UNK
9244,"Been here before of course, but what ruined this experience, they didn't put our lids to our shakes on tight!  Yeaaaaa!  They went all over the stearing wheel, emergency break, stick shift ect...Ruined exerience!  Check your stuff before you drive!  Accident waiting to happen",UNK
9245,"I would not go out of my way to eat burgers here. There are so many great choices in Scottsdale, especially for a great burger. Try Hamburger Rehab, Flemings or Z Tejas.",UNK
9246,"So fast, so convenient, less than 5 minutes from our house doesn't hurt either!!! I was smog tested, paid, and registered at the DMV in less than 15 minutes!!! DEFINITELY  bringing the other cars here and ALWAYS coming here!",UNK
9247,Best freshest Mexican food in surprise and I've tried them all I've eaten at all the ritos in town 51 ave 14th st  it's nice to have one this far west great tacos and enchiladas rice and beans,UNK
9248,Jason is a terrific stylist and an awesome guy. He's rebuilt his shop at 520 University Ave near UW Madison following a major fire in his former building downtown. Treat yourself to a tremendous cut as well as Bumble and Bumble products. He's been cutting my hair for more than 4 years.,UNK
9249,"Me and my fiance frequent Kanji pretty often. We absolutely love the entire staff they are always so energetic and welcoming, the food is amazing, and the drinks are always fun.... you have to do the sake sake bomb bombs with your friends or your table!",UNK
9250,Well -- the Steelers obviously couldn't manage the Super Bowl victory.  Maybe it was the late nights at places like Finn McCools or maybe they just got beat.\n\nRegardless -- Finns is still a good bet.,UNK
9251,"Um way overpriced. The food was ok. Nothing to write home about tho. We sat on an edge where the water \""rains\"" and I got wet from it the whole time. Its decorated cute tho.",UNK
9252,Not very friendly! I mailed a package today and had my 2 young kids with me and they rushed me out of the way at the self kiosk so they could help someone else.,UNK
9253,"Although out of the way from the strip, this place serves a whopping meal ! Great service, excellent variety and great cookin' !",UNK
9254,Ok people get it together either you deliver or you don't as my previous reviews state the pizzas are one of the best in the east valley but god dang it every time I want a delivery there not delivering this night for some reason or that night for another reason ..... Either you deliver or you don't,UNK
9255,When this hotel was revella it was phenomenal! My bf and I reserved a suit for a great price and had a great time,UNK
9256,The worst service ever!! Only reason I still come here is because the sushi is so good. But the service pisses me off every time. They forget to bring out wasabi every time. Slow to check up on us. I'd give it a single star but the sushi is the only thing saving it.,UNK
9257,"I love this indoor facility. It's big but intimate and secluded. The amenities around the reservable indoor facility are abundant; enclosed basketball court, volleyball court, horseshoe pit, small playground and walking trails that are dog friendly. Lots of parking too.",UNK
9258,Very friendly and hard working people here. I will bring my car back here anytime I'm in driving into Vegas. They treat your vehicle like it's first class not some $10.00 drive through car wash.,UNK
9259,"good atmosphere pre game.  seemed solid to me. good burger, fries and beer.  wasnt overly crowded so maybe a lot of the complaints about service were not seen by me.",UNK
9260,A taste of Paris in Montr\u00e9al!  The steak frites were very flavorable and tasty.  The drinks were good too.,UNK
9261,I had a problem with my gas guage on my Malibu. My husband bought the part and brought it in. He met Dave himself. He's a real nice and honest guy. Not out to get you for all your money. Definitely recommend this place!,UNK
9262,Pretty good Chinese food for the west valley. This has became our standby since our favorite went out of business early this year. I would not hesitate to recommend this place and we'll be back for sure.,UNK
9263,"Delicious ice cream, love the topping options.  It's a little pricey for what it is, and I wish they had more ample indoor seating for the warmer months.  Overall, I recommend it to others though!",UNK
9264,"They offer generic condiments, not the real stuff: the hoisin sauce is liquidy and not thick. They don't have Sriracha--you cannot have pho with generic sriracha hot sauce. Friend found egg shells in his pho soup. Horrible tea (tra da). Overpriced.",UNK
9265,"Free beer, free admission, hot waitresses in cute outfits. I can dig that.\n\nEverything else, ugh not so much. That pool looks so murky and dirty. Plus it's only a little bigger than any old backyard pool, except with 100 bodies in it. Gross.",UNK
9266,Prices are steep! Macaroons are NYC prices except in NYC they are twice the size. These are samplers size. Overall they taste okay not special by any means. One of those places where you might want to try cause it is there. But probably won't miss it if you don't go back.,UNK
9267,Love my glitter nails (and toes) - - get compliments constantly!  Never chip or break.  Never worry about cleanliness or getting cuts ... absolutely perfect every time.,UNK
9268,Definitely not the same as the one on Northern! This place has a bad sewer smell as soon as we walked in. The waiter seems pissed he has to be here.  Bad service. The burrito was cold and watery.,UNK
9269,Thought this was a good place. Took both of my dogs here and they both got kennel cough. I know I had to bring in my dogs shots records so not sure how this could happen. Just be careful and check and double check.,UNK
9270,"Had the nachos and toquitos. They charge for each additional ingredient; lettuce, sour creme, salsa, and etcetera. The toquitos were a soggy mess. What we did eat left us sick in to the next day.",UNK
9271,The food was amazing and staff was friendly. It was our first time there and we will be returning. The staff handled a pain in the butt customer that sat near us very well.,UNK
9272,"Wasn't really blown away by the prices or the selection. I read Yelp reviews later of other discount ticketing options and it seems that if you're resourceful, you can do better...",UNK
9273,"The food and drinks are good, but the service is slow and kind of hit or miss. I like the patio area when the weather is nice.",UNK
9274,"Best breakfaat place in scottsdale by far! Pancakes, eggs, bacon are all what youd expect from a higher end pancake house. Yum",UNK
9275,"I had gnocchi with meat sauce, huge portion but Very good. then the best part was that I got a free pasta to take home. So I got 3 meals for the price of 1. That makes everything better. I took moms lasagna home with me and it oo was very good.",UNK
9276,"Being originally from the Bronx, I am usually skeptical about pizza outside of NYC. But the pizza here is great! Thin crust, just the right amount of sauce, and awesome, salty cheese. I am so glad to have found this place!",UNK
9277,"Worst Mexican food I've ever had and being from San Diego, I've sampled tons. The food is bland and the workers were constantly getting orders wrong.",UNK
9278,I use to love this place before the new owners.  I won't get into my reasons for never coming back again except it is not comfortable for myself or my family anymore.  I did give this place more then one chance so my reasons aren't based on one thing. My time and money will be spend at other restaurants.,UNK
9279,The dessert bar was amazing and our waiter was great.  The rest of the buffet was below the quality of the Golden Coral.  We had a coupon and at $20 wasn't a bad deal overall.  They had crab legs but they were cold and not steamed.,UNK
9280,"I enjoy stopping by after shooting hoops Sunday nights. The store is well ran. Clean store, fast service. No surprise that they have a line to the door at 9 pm on Sunday nights.",UNK
9281,"Great selection, great customer service, great prices. We looked at a few other bike shops and this place was way cheaper for high quality brand new, brand name bikes. I bought myn used from here and my husband bought a new one. We are very happy with our purchases. We always go back for accessories.",UNK
9282,Excellent food and service. I loved that they use all natural fresh ingredients from local farms. The place is small so get there early on the weekend if you want to avoid the wait and I don't think they have a bathroom so get that sorted before going. I was very happy with the overall experience and  I would  highly recommend a visit.,UNK
9283,"Great place for happy hour.  They were very accomodating for our group of six (pushed tables together, etc.).  Very attentive service, amazing drinks (carmello martini is to die for), and great food.",UNK
9284,"Went to see friend's band on a Friday night, and place was completely empty besides those who were there to support the 3 bands. Much different place than when Dos was here.",UNK
9285,"A bit pricey, but as expected by the decor and menu. The bathroom has real towels, not paper! Try the wild game sampler, very yummy",UNK
9286,"The food here is okay, not bad. Boba tea is average, I've had much better in California :(. Their service is terrible, especially when you order take-out.  The waiters/servers who give you your order is so rude!",UNK
9287,Way too crowded for it's small size. Have to wait 20 minutes for a drink while you are being suffocated by so many bodies. The only escape is the small outdoor area where you are again crammed in. The place looks nice but I'm not about waiting that long for drinks while sweaty bodies press up against me.,UNK
9288,"I work in the Galleria so I was really hoping I'd like this place. After a couple of visits over the past year, I've come to the conclusion that this place is just not for me. My stomach always feels odd after eating here and I just don't find the food all that appealing.",UNK
9289,"Food was tasty, This place has a great wine and beer selection. It has anchor stream on tap. Menu needs expansion though. I would like to see pre made combos on the pizza menu and a kids menu. I think this place has potential though if it expands its menu as the pizzas are excellent.",UNK
9290,"This hotel (I refuse to use \""the\"" in this review) is awesome! I didn't even feel like I was in Vegas - it was sleek, elegant and classy. We stayed here during NYE and it was absolutely FAB.",UNK
9291,"I am hopeful that another visit might prove to be as amazing as my first, and nothing like my second. I was contacted promptly by the manager, inviting to come in for another visit. I have yet to go, but am hopeful it will be better. I am impressed and the quick response time and customer service for reaching out.",UNK
9292,"My husband and I love to see movies together and this is our favorite theater by far! It is always clean, the customer service is great and there is almost always a time that works for us.",UNK
9293,They do their espresso right (or close to it!).  The best in Madison that I'm aware of...,UNK
9294,"When I walked into this place I felt like I was walking into a restaurant from Baltimore's Little Italy. The service was to the point but personal... Wine list was limited but selective, and the menu was excellent. Great bread, nice fresh seafood.",UNK
9295,"great hummus, good food, would definitely eat there again, and has great service, i am a meat and potato girl, but the food is tasty, my favorite is the mushrooms...",UNK
9296,"Not bad, not great either. Really busy when we were there. Some things don't work well, not a great selection of balls. Could also  use screens for bowling related fun, not football. Very distracting.\n\nDidn't try the food, has a bar. Overall if you wanna go bowling its fine!",UNK
9297,Summary based on several trips:\n--ok facilities\n--remote rental car center\n--slow security\n--few power outlets in the gate areas\n--many food options,UNK
9298,Make sure the coffee is fresh and stay away from the breakfast sandwiches. Sometimes the employees can overcook the bread which is hard to bite and chew. The Turkey egg white sandwich is dry. But Dunkin is famous for their Donuts.,UNK
9299,Very pricey. Everything is priced as if it were a retail store. I know that people don't want to give things away - but a lot of stuff I see at these estate sales are ABOVE retail.,UNK
9300,Nice romantic place!\n\nPros?\n-Happy hour prices were good\n-Plenty of seating\n-Mood lighting makes it feel fancy\n-Good selection of food\n\nCons?\n-Service was mediocre\n-Gets very busy,UNK
9301,"Our go-to place in Vegas for pho after a long night of partying. The service is great, the food comes out fast, and the pho is pretty decent. \n\nI've had other pho places on Spring Mountain and I can say this is one of the better ones.",UNK
9302,"Was hoping for more to do around downtown phoenix, but most of the places seemed quiet, not as many people walking around downtown streets. The places we wanted to go to were farther away (like camelback, and the Botanical gardens). Did like the little area around the ballpark as well some restaurants such as The Strand.",UNK
9303,"I love , love love this place. Shala is my favorite threader of all time. I will never see anyone but her. Once you try threading , You will never wax again.",UNK
9304,"Easily one of the coolest bars in Phoenix. I've been coming here for  years, and the service, crowd, and ambience are always cool.",UNK
9305,The only place I rent a car from in Vegas.  Very friendly staff and great prices.  Check the city special on Dollar.com to save a few bucks.  Sign up for the dollar express and you never wait in line.  Took me 10 years to figure that one out.,UNK
9306,"The subs are small and just not worth the money!! Dont take the kids there!!, it will cost a bundle of money,.way too expensive and you dont get much!! I think its a criminal interprise!!",UNK
9307,Paying $3 for $.50 hotdogs on cheap buns I don't get why people are giving more than one star. I'm totes confused. Don't really know what else to talk about. It's a cheap hotdog they overprice...,UNK
9308,Went to get a new phone there was only one guy working the others were in the back. Waited for 5mins then left.,UNK
9309,Yum onion buns~ prices are quite cheap as well\n\nMakes you sorta want to stuff up on carbs instead of getting an actual meal nearby,UNK
9310,"We had the Chicken Teriyaki brown rice bowl. The rice was mushy, and it smelled and tasted bad, we won't go back.",UNK
9311,"Love H&M but hate the costumer service, or rather lack there of, at the Mill Mall store.  If you want to go to H&M and actually enjoy shopping there I recommend going up to the one at the Scottsdale Mall.",UNK
9312,"insipid steak covered in vegas cheeze\n\nWins: octopus app. \nFails: overcooked steak, kobe carpaccio.",UNK
9313,TEMPORARILY CLOSED\nhttp://www.sappororestaurants.com/vegas.html\n\nI've always liked the Happy Hour at this place...  but I'll have to wait until 2009 to enjoy it again.,UNK
9314,"Good price, however my husband was riding car 20 and it got so hot it burnt his side. He let the staff and management know and they really didn't care. Won't be going back",UNK
9315,Best coffee and Danish you can buy. I always get the cheese Danish and the cappuccino. I love the little sugar stick that comes with it too. Skip the buffet an enjoy quality breakfast.,UNK
9316,"Another fabulous home style Chinese food at The Prime Chinese...... If you like combo fried rice, it is the best ever....",UNK
9317,Stopped by for lunch at 11:30am and they were closed because the food hadn't arrived yet??? Waited 10 minutes then left. What a joke!! Won't be going back anytime soon. \nNice curry but not that nice!?,UNK
9318,"I ate out on the patio with a group of friends and the atmosphere was great. I ordered a few different tacos and liked them for the most part. My only complaint is that you don't get very much food for your money. But if you were to come during happy hour, the price per taco would be more justified.",UNK
9319,"Service wasn't very good and pretty slow but I expect that from most \""fast\"" food. Jack in the Box has one BANGIN chicken sandwich though, that's for sure.",UNK
9320,The place is clean and the food looks fresh. The food is really good. This place reminds me of Panera bread. The cheddar broccoli bread bowl soup is my favorite,UNK
9321,"Kinda pricey, apparently because it's organic and gluten free because it's not for taste or portion size. Service was just ok. I don't know, I know people that like it so maybe I'll give it another try. But I know of plenty of really good pizza places so I don't know when.",UNK
9322,I will judge a city by its cupcakes no big deal.\n\nMy perfect Mad Hatter cupcake:\nChocolate cupcake was moist and not too dense. Ganache filling was perfectly sweet and strawberry frosting was to die for! Love the concept of build your own cupcakes.,UNK
9323,"In a word...yuk. Ordered takeout. If you like frozen pizza taste with a cardboard crust and canned sauce this is your place. Maybe kids would like it, but not adults who have ever eaten a good pizza.",UNK
9324,"I had no issues with the Imperial Palace. It was centrally located, rather inexpensive, and the buffet on the top floor was awesome. It's not the best casino hotel, but if you don't care about that, it's doable. The service was acceptable.",UNK
9325,"I like the different way it is set and what makes it unique, but somehow fighting for table, and the yelling of our name for kitchen uhh ,also limited  choices and cash only",UNK
9326,"Yelpers did it again! The free chicken potato soup while we waited on our gyros was amazing! The gyros were great! Only 4 stars because it is the only time we've eaten there. Don't live here, but would stop again!",UNK
9327,I ordered 3 Chicken Caesar Wraps to go and guess what??  The 3 sandwiches contained a half leaf of lettuce...BETWEEN THE 3 OF THEM.  When you sell a chicken caesar wrap you are selling a chicken caesar SALAD wrapped in some sort of pita.,UNK
9328,refreshing new addition to the sea of mediocre pizza & gyro places along Carson .\nno seating .  across the street from where former Pens player Max Talbot used to live .\ni'll be back many times.  hope they stay in business .,UNK
9329,"This is a pretty decent burger.  I've definitely had better, but overall a solid choice if you're craving a burger and want to pass on a fast food burger chain.",UNK
9330,"what is wrong with you people, horrible horrible service luke-warm food, innattentive staff, understaffed, very expensive. never again.  you people must not be used to anything nice at all.never again, although all employees were still polite and smiled.",UNK
9331,"Gotten my haircut twice here and he consistently does a great job....and for $10, can't go wrong.\n\nJust don't ask him about politics.",UNK
9332,The hours are wrong for Sunday. Beware. The food is wonderful but yelp is posting the wrong hours on Sundays. I'm here at 7pm and this amazing restaurant is closed.\nI am sad,UNK
9333,"Okay, our table was wiggly, we tried to fix it, coffee spilled on my head and the waiters grudgingly resat us and made us move our own dishes. Hope the food's worth it.",UNK
9334,"One of the harder golf course I've played at.  They do have really good summer specials.  The courses are nice along with the greens.  Driving around got a little confusing sometimes, I'm not sure why.  The staff is friendly.  I wouldn't mind playing here again.",UNK
9335,"It's decent food downtown, but the service is lackluster half the time and the chow mein is either dry or super soggy.",UNK
9336,"We are always impressed with our meals at Mimitas. I have tried several things on the menu, but always migrate back to the Medianoche sandwich! All sandwiches come with classic Cuban sides including yuca frita or margaritas! Both are delicious. Highly recommended hidden gem.",UNK
9337,Was told by a store in Colorado that my name would be in there system associated with a discount but this store would not honor the discount.  They are not military family friendly! Will not return to this store ever.,UNK
9338,"Shame on you Hilton! Old property, outdated dirty rooms, unkept grounds,  ignorant rude staff and   water park draws the wrong element (police on property every night to remove drunken guests) Look elsewhere.",UNK
9339,Never again. Accidently booked by expedia. Will never book this airline again. Worst. Flight was delayed. Had to pay for baggage before and was way higher than the industry norm. Had to pay for seat. Had to wait even longer for bags. 3 hour one way flight turned into a 9 hour disaster.,UNK
9340,"One of my favorite places to eat at in Vegas. Their burger is pretty delicious, but not the best just yet. Their fries are decently good. But what makes this place special to me is the decor and service. It is one of a kind with a cool fire display wall separating the outside and inside of the restaurant.",UNK
9341,"This is a great savers location! Best place to find unique costume items. Great selection. Parking is limited. Beware of Wendy's lot next door, lots of tow signs.",UNK
9342,Food was terrible service was ok. We were told it would be a 30-45 minute wait and it turned into an hour and a half wait. Totally not worth it.,UNK
9343,"The apple fritter tasted like stale, homemade donut. The lemon filled donut was amazing. The interior is very \""hole in the wall.\"" The woman was friendly but tried to pressure me to buy a cinnamon roll I never hinted that I wanted. $2.50 for the two items.",UNK
9344,the foods are great but the service... well it is ok. \nThe servers are little bit slow and take so long to just get my order. I understand they are busy but some times it irritates me.,UNK
9345,A client of mine recently came to Phoenix and the concierge at the Renaissance recommended The Breadfruit.  It was almost embarrassing because the food was awful and we left after beer and two appetizers.  Do not waste your time as the flavors were terrible.,UNK
9346,"We met with Angel, one of the specialist here at Sprint. We were impressed with the customer service rendered to us by him. He was professional, polite, patient and answered our questions with ease. Thanks Angel. Keep up the great work.",UNK
9347,The service isn't the best..but the blueberry lemon muffin was delicious! I also got a cupcake for my friend & she loved it. I would really like to come back for one of their sandwiches.,UNK
9348,its ok i ate all my food cause i was starving. wont be back again. not a fan of gluten free establishments its a waste of time .....great service tho!,UNK
9349,I went to this hotel and I will NEVER stay here. The female/male who was working the desk was a total bitch. Plus over charge for stuff snacks!! Friend was staying here and she didn't like the person who was working the desk. Not a welcome feeling at this hotel.,UNK
9350,"Be careful when you order the tikki Marsala, I had found feathers in the sauce... I'm not coming back ..",UNK
9351,"The food is excellent, however most employees belong at circus circus, not to the  Bellagio!\nSpending $90 for a breakfast of four which is worth it, it will be nice to crack a smile.",UNK
9352,Amazing sushi that is well priced and sure to please! Best spicy tuna handroll I have ever had!!!!,UNK
9353,Loved it.  We rec'd outstanding service and food was excellent.  I would have given it 5 stars but the seating could have been a little more spaced and intimate.  We had a great time at Switch.,UNK
9354,I love the pretzels with cheese.  Great burger and fries.  I have been a few times.  Always consistent and friendly.,UNK
9355,"Walked in by chance and was blown away.  The place was packed and the food was great.  I had a lengua, spicy pork and asada and all were some of the best i have ever had.",UNK
9356,everything is delicious!!!!---well worth the $25 brunch!!!!!\ndessert bar is my fave!!!!!---,UNK
9357,"Sushi is not as fresh as the other places - service is horrible. The place itself, a good attempt, but feels like it's in the basement of an old bank building. Too many other options to choose from make it tough to give this more than 1-2 stars.",UNK
9358,"I underwent their \""half hour\"" introductory flight lesson.\nBut the experience was way below expectations. I thought they would let me actually handle the flight for long, but it was very very short lived experience.  Their coordination with control was messy & spoiled the whole experience.",UNK
9359,Even despite management...\nFood was spectacular....\nServer (  Cameron) above avg.!,UNK
9360,"Can I give them a negative 4? Worst staff. Worst food. Worst management. Horrible all around. I have never in my life been treated the way I was treated tonight. I am embarrassed for \""Copper Blues\"". Wow. I will never go there again. Ever. Wow.",UNK
9361,"Our room needs serious renovation.  The wallpaper were peeling off, the TV screen was not clear, looks like an analog.  We did not get the deluxe room that we reserved.  The location however is ideal.",UNK
9362,"Big fan of this place!! Been to other Dunns, this one is the best one so far\n\nGood food! Very good and fast service, nice staff, pretty big portions. Not because I'm a girl, my husband too loves this place.",UNK
9363,"Waitress last night was shitty ...,, left her a dollar tip for being rude ....  It's sux cuz this is one of my fav sushi spots,...  2thumbs down on service last night",UNK
9364,We've ordered from Slide and Bounce Around a couple of times... We love what they offer and had a Blast every time!!,UNK
9365,"A good place to meet with some friends for some drinks, but I agree with the space issue.  Just moving from one side of the bar to another can get downright acrobatic.",UNK
9366,"Easy access to freeway, gas station and usual Costco goodies ... what's to complain about. Plus this Costco seems like it has little more options available, comparing to the one on I17/101. I've never experienced huge crowd or long lines at the check out, and that makes it even better.",UNK
9367,"I come here to eat all the time. They serve food late, and the quality of ingredients is as good as it gets in madison. I recommend the ruben soup. Huge selection of beers and ciders. Great brunch. Staff could be improved, but they've only been open for about a year.",UNK
9368,So painful that I was pushed two inches down the chair so my nose was touching the face opening. The first therapist smelled of cigarette smoke. No scalp massage and no sense of body language. If you are clenching your muscles you think they would lighten up!,UNK
9369,I would of given this course 5 stars if they'd had a ranger that had the balls to tell the group in front of us to pick the pace up. Ended up being over a 5 hr round. Course was in great shape.,UNK
9370,Thank god this place is closing because this place is sad.  The only redeeming amenity this hotel offers is that the monorail stop is here.,UNK
9371,This is always hit and miss. I just went and got the works and added leather treatment. My car was dirtier then when I dropped it off. I was one of two cars and 12 employees. Not pleased.,UNK
9372,"I like this place. The employees are very nice,just wished this place was closer to my house. You either hate this place or you love it but  I recommend this place if you live close to this gun store.",UNK
9373,I read some great reviews and checked it out....wonderful!  I am already planning my trip back.  Incredibly reasonable prices.,UNK
9374,My son and daughter go to this day care. I really like that the staff is really friendly. I have had no issues with this place.,UNK
9375,"Love this place!  The people here are very friendly and more than happy to help. Plenty of samples on new foods.  I was impressed when the produce worker came up to is at checkout with a new type of apple.  He cut it fresh, provided us with background info, and offered us a sample.",UNK
9376,Best bbq place hands down!!!! Ive been here twice I get the 3 meat plate with double mac its so much that I always have lots of lwdtover for later!  If you are in Vegas and love bbq THIS is the spot. There is a bit of a wait but totally worth it!,UNK
9377,Food was so-so. Salsa and chips were good. One of my friends really likes this place. I was not super impressed.  Location is good. I think I would only return with my friend when the salsa band comes and plays.,UNK
9378,Thai Chili has just opened. Ping pong Thai restaurant is great too and there is another where Home Depot is located.  Thai Chili I would say is almost as good as Ping pong but I have no regrets going to Thai Chili.,UNK
9379,"GUYS, THE FRIES....what are you going to do about the soggy fries?  Customers are looking for hot, crispy fries and you continue to fail in that delivery.  It really takes away from the excellent burgers you serve up.",UNK
9380,"Delicious. I love their version of Eggs Benny with Turkey and Advocado, instead of ham. The prices are okay too, especially if you use their stamp card program. The location on Rural seems to have a wait on Sat & Sun's, but it's worth it.",UNK
9381,"Standard diner food at standard diner prices. They've got a bunch of pies and baked goods, too. The place is a pretty good size, so they have no trouble seating large groups quickly. Market Street Diner isn't anything fantastic, but I'm glad it's here because restaurants in Sun Prairie are few and far between.",UNK
9382,Great little quaint restaurant!!! And there is parking!!!  Additional lot around the corner. Super healthy and very friendly staff!! I will recommend this little round local burger shop to all my friends.,UNK
9383,"I haven't found the best part of this bakery yet.\n\nI bought some chocolate chip cookies that were on the small side and a little expensive, but not \""out of this world good.\""\n\nI can feel the owner's dedication and I want to give this place a few more tries.",UNK
9384,"Never coming back there was a worm on our food!! And the vegetables were so old it's disgusting that someone can serve food like this ! I will never ever return to this place, besides the fact of the horrible food experience the place reeked like cigarette smoke !!! Wish I can give no stars!!",UNK
9385,Amazing. Traveling from out of town and discovered this place on Yelp. Absolutely wonderful atmosphere and food. Definitely recommend.,UNK
9386,"My husband and I went grocery shopping here on a  Monday evening... bad idea. The shelves were almost bare and what was left was a mess and disorganized. This is unusual for this store, which I usually shop at. Positive for this trip was as usual the salad bar and the tomato bisque soup. A must try!",UNK
9387,80 mins deep tissue massage costs 205 dollars plus tip. However the massage therapist did not perform a deep tissue massage at all. I am always bad at face to face confrontation so I was not able to tell them this was probably one of the worst deep tissue massages I ever received.,UNK
9388,I have been going here like 3 years.  Lani is the best her pedicures always last forever and everyone always compliments my nails and pedicures.,UNK
9389,It's an airport with slot machines... Seeing as I don't gamble... It's an airport. that about sums it up.,UNK
9390,"There's sincerely too much hype to this! You are better going to the RIO and getting awesome views and in expensive drinks from their \""VooDoo\"" lounge at the top of the building!",UNK
9391,Wonderful restaurant. I have eaten my birthday meal here for the last 3 years. The falafel is outstanding. The couple who own and operate the restaurant are genuinely friendly and kind.,UNK
9392,Decent vib with live djs. Can't say the sheesha is anything spectacular though. Limited flavours and only moderately clean hookahs.,UNK
9393,"AMAZING bike ride! My Hubby and I are new to mountain biking, this park was our third ride on our new bikes, and we had a BLAST.  Very fun trail, BEAUTIFUL! Hikes looked amazing also! Only bad was no bathrooms :(",UNK
9394,Food was good. Its close to my house and I had a groupon so decided to try since I love Indian food. Service was good. Saw that they offer a lunch buffet so may have to come back and try sometime,UNK
9395,Guys are very rude! Told me it would take an 1 hour to 90 minutes and ends up taking two and a half hours. Don't go here unless you want to plan on being lied to. There is a perfectly great discount tire on baseline and country club that will take great care of you and will actually value you as a customer.,UNK
9396,I love this place!!! I come to Charlotte three times a year and its the first place I go to eat. I wish we had these in California.,UNK
9397,I've been there four times and I always leave satisfied. You'll most likely spend a hundred bucks for two people but well worth it. Very friendly staff. My only complaint is that there's always a lineup when you walk in.,UNK
9398,"Slow slow slow, you will wait for at least 25 mind to 40 min before food arrives, the restaurant is also filthy.  Floors are messy and so are tsbles.",UNK
9399,This place has great food and a good atmosphere. I have need had a bad roll here and always receive great service. The guys up front know how to do their job well! They usually have some good happy hour specials throughout the week.,UNK
9400,"Maybe it was because we went for a late lunch, and the salad and 'fresh' buffet items (sushi!)  were not so 'fresh'..... overall I was not impressed by the food and would not recommend this place to anyone.  On the brighter side the staff was very attentive and pleasant.",UNK
9401,"great philly cheesesteak, hot bbq wings, fries, pizza. Good place to drink that is not a bar.",UNK
9402,"One star is a little harsh, so mistakes happen Dominos is the best factory pizza place period .. I have never paid 20 plus for pizza from there,5.99 carry out ! enough said..",UNK
9403,"One of the best Chinese places in Arizona by far. Independent from the other Chen's, this one seems to focus on the eating experience. Decor and customer service is a A+ in my book!\n\nWill be back!",UNK
9404,Hamburger was number 1 to me. The hummus I had before was also delicious. Generous portions and good prices. Worthed!,UNK
9405,They overcharge the car wash isn't great I always have to have them wipe spots and it's still never 100%!,UNK
9406,Great burger special super yummy and their fries were really good as well! \n\nThe only thing I did not like was their bottom bun was very soggy. I'm going to give it another try and hope I don't have the same problem if I do my stars will go down!,UNK
9407,Worst service. Could not get waited on left after 15 minutes when they sat a couple at the table next to us and they were waited on instantly.,UNK
9408,"This place is WAAAY over priced for the generic cuisine they serve. Aside from that, the food is only room temperature. You are much better off spending your dollars at Buffet @ Asia. At least there they have a decent assortment of sushi and a standard Mongolian BBQ.",UNK
9409,"Very disappointed. Delivery was late, our gyros were cold and fries were soggy. I wont be ordering from here again.",UNK
9410,"Very loud place,They make you wait at the bar forever.Food was\ngood but way over priced.Won't eat here again.Too many great places\nin town that has better food and service without the need for ear plugs\nand waiting 20 minutes pass your reservation",UNK
9411,We drive a little out of the way to go this target because it's clean and is surrounded but many other stores we frequent.   It's usually pretty busy so plan to park a bit further than most.,UNK
9412,"A simple to go place in the uptown area.  Walk in, order your dish, pick it up at the end of the counter.\n\nWe all enjoyed the hibachi steak and I tried the dumplings and noodles which were tasty.",UNK
9413,oh my!!! Get the corn soup it is freaken heaven!!!!! The meatballs were great too. I have to say the decor was beautifully done- bold colors! The waiter was wonderful.,UNK
9414,"I gave another of Emeril's restaurant a try. The only memorable thing about my visit here was the lobster mac-n-cheese. Other than that, I wouldn't return. Some of the food was bland and others were overly salty. I will pass on this place!!!!",UNK
9415,I must be renting from a different PRS than the previous reviews. I have been in the same rental for 11 years and  I have never received anything but 5 star service.  Maintenance requests are handled in a timely manner and Rondee and Sue have  always been nothing but professional.  I will continue to  recommend them to  my friends and family.,UNK
9416,"I love when chain restaurants can still produce homemade tasting items and provide excellent service. Their seasonal breakfast items, iced coffees (with to go cups!), and friendly staff will have me coming back.",UNK
9417,"On a positive note, grass fed beef is a plus. However for what you get, the burgers are overpriced and NO FRIES!!! Big mistake in my book regardless of the chips you can get a la carte. I won't be going back.",UNK
9418,"We have friends who rave about mu shu. We like it, but not enough to make it regular, and we live just a few blocks away. Price/value is measured in pounds. Friendly service, still it's cafeteria quality",UNK
9419,"The food was okay, however the decor is quite outdated. I would have enjoyed it much more if the restaurant didn't smell dingy.",UNK
9420,Food was okay. Over priced for the amount if food you get. Ordered cheesecake and was told it was frozen. Had to take it home in a to-go box to let in thaw out. Service was okay.,UNK
9421,Sorry to the server at the bar that helped me. I got so drunk I left my card and walked away without writing in a tip. He was all class And he just charged me the bill and then turned the card into security. Thank you-and he was a new employee!,UNK
9422,"the buffet of buffets for $40 is a good deal for 24hrs of unlimited buffets across 7 different properties, we ate here mainly\n\nwhat you would expect, prime rib, shrimp, crab legs, etc\n\ngood quality and taste for the $$",UNK
9423,I figured there would be a bunch of college chicks drinking beer here. There was not. They had Left Hand Stout on draft which is alright. Where the hell were all of the college girls? I didn't get to creep any of them out!,UNK
9424,OVER PRICED!!  $4.78 for a dry -over cooked egg and cheese croissant... the croissant itself was good but can't justify the price or the quality of the whole sandwich - not going out of my way to come back...,UNK
9425,"Great place, worth searching. Don't expect the best pizza of your life. Expect amusement, great quality of pizza to go, but, unfortunately, inequal ratio price / quality die to the position and guerilla marketing around it.",UNK
9426,"Not bad. Not as good as Hawaii, reasonable price, it's clean inside. Employees are nice, large menu, I normally get the bbq chicken and a side, mostly eat there.",UNK
9427,"Take a sports bar, serve eh-ok mexican food and fill the room with testosterone and let the ladies loose!  This place was a way too frat boyish for our tastes and the food was not that great. Over crowed with tables as large as basketball courts. I could never hear the server or the person across the table speaking.",UNK
9428,Happy hour for drinks. Nice ambience and super customer service and Salt fish fritter! I didn't give 5 star due to not trying actual food. But great overall,UNK
9429,"Great ambiance, pizza, salad & wine!  No need to review if you've been to one Grimaldi's their all very similar.  Thin crust quality toppings and fresh salads.\n\nI enjoy them, but I know it's going to cost me. They think highly of their food.",UNK
9430,"Dinner was amazing!! I had the strongola with angel hair which I loved, two people had pesto and one Alfredo and everyone loved their dish. Definitely can't wait to go back to try some more menu items! The staff were all very friendly, helpful and well mannered. Seemed to work well as a team.",UNK
9431,"Everyone is very friendly & welcoming and they don't try to \""upsell\"" you as much as some other places.  They always give me a bottle of water too, which is a nice touch.  Will continue coming here for sure.",UNK
9432,Fish and shrimp tacos are great..LOVE the sauce!! The sides that come with the meal are awful tho. The parking sucks. Last time went on my lunch break..had to park almost 2 blocks away!! Did I say the sauce is really Gooooood?? Lol,UNK
9433,"This is a nice resort no doubt.  Good rooms, good food, isolated and boring.  Not near anything. Any apparently you can't drink the tap water.  Service was great, just not really my type of place, more screaming kids then I expected, and nothing to do.",UNK
9434,"Food gets FIVE STARS, Service takes two stars away. I know they are always busy, but then get more staff!  I do love and crave the shrimp Scampi.",UNK
9435,This place is on a thin line between thrift store and junkyard. It just doesn't feel clean and no one is very welcoming if you aren't hipster enough. There are so many salons out there that I wouldn't give this one a shot.,UNK
9436,"Service department was more than helpful. I just bought my car from another dealership, but I would not rule out buying the next one here.",UNK
9437,"Love this store! I always stop by when I'm in Las Vegas... I only wish they had them in other parts of the country... Oh well, I guess I HAVE TO GO to Vegas again....lol Fran",UNK
9438,Love the comic selections. \n\nI am a comic fans and love anime. \n\nGreat artwork and posters in the store.\n\nStaff is very helpful and friendly. \n\nNot like most comic stores where you feel uncomfortable when you walk in.,UNK
9439,"Excellent service & friendly employees! This place stays busy so you may have a slight wait for a fitting room if you go on a busy Saturday. However, they are very efficient and will get you in and out as quickly as possible.",UNK
9440,Drive Thru is a NIGHTMARE.  Food is cold more often than not and the orders are CONSISTENTLY WRONG.,UNK
9441,This has to be the best Mexican restaurant in town. I am Mexican and I have been looking for a good place like this since I moved to Las Vegas . I do have to say this place just did it. They have great customer service too! It's a must try.,UNK
9442,Great detail work.  I took in my vehicle that had scratches along the side of it from off roading.  They were able to get 90% of it out.  The vehicle looked like a new suv when I picked it up.  No complaints.  I would definitely take it back.,UNK
9443,"This shop does not always open on time, but the selection and prices are amazing. They have an extensive selection to choose from. It does not look like a lot from the outside, but if you like comics this is a great place to stop by.",UNK
9444,"Love WINCO. Great prices, very good meat and produce. Probably 5% less expensive than WalMart and the clientele inside is usually...better ;)",UNK
9445,"Good staff, very good crabcake and pasta dish. I enjoyed it. \n \nVegas as a million different options for food, but I felt like this was pretty reasonable. \n\nI would reccomend it to pretty much anyone.",UNK
9446,"Even the non-office \""nice\"" chairs left us with partial paralysis.  Very hard and uncomfortable.  Also, the high school kids working there could use some customer service training.",UNK
9447,#3 on my vegas buffet list.\n\ndesserts r gross. dont eat it. you will have diarrhea. and die.,UNK
9448,Prime rib was okay in quality. Convenient bar in the middle of the buffet. Crab legs were fresher than the other buffets. Not bad.,UNK
9449,"The staff was friendly, the wine list long and it was attached to my hotel.   The good was a little on the plain and pricey side but if your staying at the Courtyard and don't feel like going far it's easy and good enough.",UNK
9450,I looove Earth Fare! Why? It's because they sell outstanding organic and low calorie/fat food items. Definitely as good as Whole Foods Market. This place also has a great hot food and salad bar section. Worth the trip indeed.,UNK
9451,"I like going here for lunch every now and then.  The place isnt always super packed, which I like and the service is always quick and the people are always nice! I love the No.5 asian salad and the tomato soup!  This is a good place when you want good decent food and nice people helping you!",UNK
9452,"I went here a couple of months ago because my cousin recommend this place. I don't think I will be back here again! I did get my eyebrows waxed here and the lady didn't do a good job.\n\nThe place is clean, staff is friendly but they do try to upsell some of their products.",UNK
9453,Pros: Pretty good burritos.  Good street tacos.  I have found better.  They do have really good Chile Verde.,UNK
9454,"Friendliest Wendy's I have ever been to.\n\nVery clean.  Fast. \n\nNo complaints.  Great staff, great fast eats.",UNK
9455,"Awesome bar, great vibe, good variety of drinks (all $9), unlike any place I've been to. Also known as a locals hangout in Veags",UNK
9456,Just your average streak place. My parents eat here a bunch and they bring me along when i visit them. They only get 2 stars cause in a state like North Carolina if you only serve mass produced beers your doing something wrong.,UNK
9457,"I think you're either a Le Peep groupie or you're not. I'm not. I'll go there, and their food is alright, but nothing special.",UNK
9458,overpriced you definitely pay for all the tvs in there. Service was slow  almost walked out because no one came to our table the first 15 minutes we were there.,UNK
9459,"Good BBQ I personally like meat serve without sauce, and this is exactly what they do, together with soft moist meat it is  great place for quick lunch (except lines ) but its actually best advertisement",UNK
9460,"These guys drove all the way to our house, took one look at the tile I needed cleaning, and told me how I could do it myself without charging me anything.  They were patient, friendly, and honest.  I highly recommend New Look for tile, grout, and general cleaning.",UNK
9461,"The sandwiches are good. Huge portions. However, the ones with marinara sauce taste like ketchup. The sauce they are using is just not good. So just go with a sandwich that doesn't call for marinara sauce. The salads are decent. Reasonable lunch specials.",UNK
9462,"The food was amazing. This place use to be a Moe's so the place isn't visually appealing. Interior could use an overhual. Food was great of  course, the chef's are awesome,  the servers were lacking knowledge.",UNK
9463,Pretty average Mexican food. They have a decent happy hour which was half off their appetizer and drink specials. Chips and salsa were good. Chicken Caesar salad was good. Sangria was good. Everything was just good not great.,UNK
9464,"Hell. \n\nWhere customer service goes to die. They give ZERO sh*ts. \n\nThe Worst, always and forever.",UNK
9465,I normally love this bar but the bartender tonight was Anthony and he is awful. I went to the bar to get a drink and he was off to the side flirting with someone.  As a customer I shouldn't be ignored while you try to get laid.,UNK
9466,The show was ok.  I started to get bored.  My kids enjoyed the show.  We sat in the general admission section and people kept going in and out which got on my nerves because the had to walk in front of you and the person at the door had to open the curtain which let the light inside.  Glad I didn't pay for the ticket.,UNK
9467,Had a great late night here. Molly was awesome! I always love a dive bar and this guy takes the cake! Bras strung around the bar and a gorgeous gal makin the drinks. This is a great spot to unwind after a long night at work.,UNK
9468,I went to this place prior to an Artist Party last night! It was delicious! The bartender was very nice and accommodating. I ordered the jerk chicken with rice and beans.  It was spiced just right. I will definitely go back. I gave it 5 stars because I actually cleaned my plate.,UNK
9469,"Too smokey.  Too annoying.  Too Ballys.  \n\nLook, this place is centrally located on the strip but I would find another hotel.  The casino seems old and the food options were not wonderful.",UNK
9470,"Great tanning place. Clean, good customer service. Excellent location.\nI tan twice a week or so and it is always a good experience.\nI did a lot of research before I actually decided to select a tanning spot. Price and results are top notch here. Totally recommend it.",UNK
9471,This place is SOOOO friendly!\nThe bouncers opened the door for me. The bartender introduced herself to me then actually extended her hand to me to shake it. The manager came over TWICE to make sure everything was ok...and it was!,UNK
9472,"Please don't waste your time or money!  Absolutely horrible, it taste as bad as the building looks! HORRIBLE SERVICE TOO!",UNK
9473,"Food was very good, service was non-existant.  We waited for 20 minutes after dinner to get coffee and we waited for 30 minutes for the check.  If we had service, it would have been 5 stars.",UNK
9474,"It's just like any other Burger King, which we all know is the king of burgers. But this one is in an airport. That makes it so much more exciting!",UNK
9475,"I love this place! the food is amazing and everything is just delicious! the wait is a bit long, but its worth the wait.",UNK
9476,You could wander for hours in this mall.  Tons of great stores all under one roof.  Just don't forget where you parked!,UNK
9477,"If you want to donate clothing or used goods, this may be a place for you to consider.  If you do, you receive a discount on in store purchases.  It is a typical \""thrift\"" store.  You can purchase clothing, shoes, books, entertainment, art, etc.  It is a good store for those aforementioned specific purposes.",UNK
9478,"Good food here the cocktails are great, definitely a bit too pricey for my experience eating at these type of places.  I would recommend it more if they were a bit more realistic with the price for the portion.  Or maybe I just don't like the Scottsdale scene.",UNK
9479,"Delicious! We loved the curry and Thai spice. We thought we would get more seafood/meat per dish, but it was still good. Flavors were fantastic!",UNK
9480,"I will do anything or use any excuse not to go to this place. I hate dealing with all the people here and the staff. If I wanted to be judged, I would rather go to church.",UNK
9481,Have recently enjoyed a couple visits here to use Mad City Cocktail book...Very good service and conversation with both Dana and Holly..Worth a stop if at nearby Farm and Fleet or vice versa.Food looked good..,UNK
9482,This place sucks. It's so expensive and the trainers are not motivating. They are drill sergeants that make you feel uncomfortable in your own skin unless you already have 8% body fat. Then they love you and want you to wear their stupid orange shirt.,UNK
9483,Silvia is an amazing hairdresser.  I have been going to her for over 2 years and I have yet to come out with a bad cut.  My mom and roommate now go to her too!  She is wonderful!,UNK
9484,"YES, I appreciate the undying love and dedication to In-N-Out Burger.  I just don't get it.  To me, the burger tasted like a somewhat better \""Big Mac.\""",UNK
9485,They were great.  One person for 4 hours and we have a large house so they didn't hit all our rooms but Angela did great!,UNK
9486,I eat here all the time. The place is great. Burrito bomb is Awesome! The owner and staff are great and really get to know you. Great local spot in north PHX!,UNK
9487,"I had their Bo luc lac.  Not impressed, the flavor was really off.  Maybe this is because grew up in the San Gabriel Valley and lived near Garden Grove for 2 years.  But all in all I wouldn't go back.",UNK
9488,"Their horchata tastes like caca. That is all I can say about this establishment. It tastes like melted vanilla ice cream with cinnamon, rather than a delicious refreshing Mexican drink. Will never order again.",UNK
9489,Ordered basket of wings today for take out. Told me 20 mins. Waited for 40 mins. Really? The owner Ron was there. Told him.. And he did told the manager to look. That's it. No one appeared to be really sorry as they don't care . Really?,UNK
9490,"Wow, since when do they have patron margaritas? The food is consistently good. I love the brown rice option they have now.",UNK
9491,"Really positive experiences here. Everyone is always friendly and helpful. Even on July 4th,  which must not be fun to work if you have to, all of the employees walked past us with a smile and a wave or to ask if we needed assistance. Tidy and organized... what's not to love?",UNK
9492,"French toast hard, had to use my knife with force.  Never had scrambled eggs flat and perfectly round.  They were not fluffy or tasty. Won't go back I've had better",UNK
9493,Only come here in the morning and get out quick. Because it becomes a war zone here very quickly. As the sun goes down the freaks and ghouls come out until it gets night where its the worst of the worst.,UNK
9494,Don't go...lot of filler in rolls and two of my rolls taste like mold.  They said the mold was the ginger mixing with shrimp.  It want my first rodeo and shrimp and ginger does not taste like mold.,UNK
9495,Subway is the best.  However the rude non friendly people that work there need to go. This is the2nd time I have gone for dinner and the same service.  If you do not like people or like to be a little friendly you should not work with the public.  Ugh! I will chose a different subway next time.,UNK
9496,"What a find! After having humongous buffets at various places in Vegas, this was a welcome change! Definitely give it a try on your way back. My husband had the eggs Benedict and I got the veggie omlette. Very cute little place.",UNK
9497,"fantastic view of downtown you gotta see!  driving up here is  a royal pain, as is driving a lot of places in hilly pittsburgh. you need to find on street parking nearby which seems to be a bit tricky.. run or ride your bike up here and avoid driving and parking hastles!",UNK
9498,The food wasn't bad. But the portions were out of wack for the price I could have gone to a better restaurant and be content with what I ate.,UNK
9499,"Met some colleagues for a business breakfast here. I had a breakfast skillet and coffee. It was OK, not earth shattering my any means. Maybe I'll try some different for the next time.",UNK
9500,Good food. I had the pork belly. Cheeseburger & gnocchi was ok. Their strawberry shortcake was not great. If you live in the area its a great place to eat. I would not make the drive again.,UNK
9501,"3-star best pastry chef, wonderful bread, beautiful dessert. \n16-course menu is flat out disappointing.  any \""try to be modern\"" dish is a bomb\nservice, no rating\n\nif we had reserved thru Wynne, maybe a total different service.",UNK
9502,No clue how this place is rated 4.5 stars. Hair in my pho. Awkward staff that watch you eat. Can I please just enjoy my food in peace please? Colleagues ordered panang curry which was mediocre. Definitely won't go back and stunned by the reviews.,UNK
9503,"Not bad Pei Wei!.. I ordered the Japanese Teriyaki Bowl with fried rice and It was good, I also added some of the chilli paste that Pei Wei has and it just made it that much better. I have not tried any other dishes here, but I can honestly say i enjoyed my meal here.",UNK
9504,"I don't know why they're always so busy, the food was horrible! They make you pay on the way in and then you're stuck! Do not recommend!",UNK
9505,"Rude and slow. Arrived 455 for drug screen for new employment. Still sitting at 520. Not only did the front desk person announce my \""drug screen\"" to everyone but she took all patients in order despite the fact that I didn't need to see a doctor. Simple UA. Never again.",UNK
9506,Saw this on yelp and decided to check it out. So happy I did because these guys are fantastic. They had knowledge of every product and even make custom vape flavors for you while your waiting. The possibilities are endless with these guys. Great prices too.,UNK
9507,"I have seen Mystere about 3 times and I liked all of the times I went.  The acrobats are amazing and so is the sound.  The venue is quite intimate.  This is a good show, especially since the prices have dropped so low.",UNK
9508,"Cheddar burger and fire dogs - awesome.  Burger are dripping with sharp cheese sauce and toppings, perfect slight pink inside.  Dogs are loaded with goodies with the right amount of kick.  Onion rings are crispy, hot and fresh.  Plus they have Star Wars pinball, how sweet is that!",UNK
9509,"So much to choose from.  The only place so far that we can find Yaki Soba.  However, they have not stocked it since, so the place was downgraded by a star.  They do seem to have every noodle possible, also seasonings, etc. that you won't find at a regular grocery.",UNK
9510,"Surprisingly, this TJ Maxx is 100x cleaner and more organized than the TJ Maxx I visit in Newark, CA. Wow! Even with the clearance blow-out, clothes are not on the ground. Everything was on a rack or shelf. Simply amazing.",UNK
9511,"If you are broke and you need used tires this is THE place.  Look, it's 400+ for two tires for my vehicle... I'm selling it in the next couple months...so I got out of here for $70.  Very cool guys...I'm more than satisfied!",UNK
9512,"When my fiance dropped off ten items to be cleaned at the Gilbert location on Val Vista, he was quoted $4.25 per item. At pick up, the price had increased 20%. Not only that, a $300.00 shirt was spotted with grease. We will not be using this location again.",UNK
9513,Ran in here today because I needed a restroom.\n\nThe barista on duty was friendly and efficient. The coffee was tasty and not overly pricey..\n\nThe restroom was clean and fully stocked.\n\nI'd return definitely..,UNK
9514,"I was very happy with the haircut I received. I was treated courteously and on time, which is great for me. I'm always on a schedule. \n\nNow, I have a haircut easy to style and looks adorable. \n\nI also loved the products the stylist used on my hair.",UNK
9515,The food was fine but the service was horrible. The older manager (possibly the owner) was berating an employee in front of customers. The kid didn't deserve any of it. Won't be back to this place if this is how employees are treated.,UNK
9516,"Went this this morning and I am wondering why the hell it tool me so long to go here. Awesome food, fresh and the staff was even better. Won't eat anywhere else for breakfast in the burg! Gotta get here",UNK

9519,Was introduced to Sakana about 3 months ago or so looking for a good Ramen place near my house. Glad to see AND taste good foods. I usually get the Ramen and don't forget to check in for that free edemame!,UNK
9520,HANNAH HANNAH HANNAH! I wish this place was in LA!!! I just left with a perfect pedi and gel mani! Pricey but worth it!!! Hannah is such a perfectionist which I love!!!! Flawless nails! Thanks!,UNK
9521,"This was the worst restaurant I have ever been to.The food has no flavor, the red enchilada sauce was brown.The wait staff was horrible . The waitress asked how everything was and when we said horrible she kept walking.  . Save your money.",UNK
9522,"Really good burgers, sweet potato chips and cold beer.  Skip the onion rings!  Horrible batter,  way too much! \nOur server basically blew off our feedback on the onion rings.  They also forgot my wife's condiments for her burger. \nI'll give them a second try..",UNK
9523,Don't be afraid when you walk into the dimly lit space that mimics the feel of being in a coal mine.  Cornish Pasty Co offers up a wide variety of pasties that are very good.  I think this my new spot for lunch on my way to the airport.    Good beer too.,UNK
9524,"They wrecked my car twice. 1st it was the bumper, and like an idiot I took my car back and they wrecked the passenger mirror. What a joke!! Customer service is atrocious!! They look forward to telling you to bad!!",UNK
9525,"Exceptional work, work done in a few days n the quality of the product are way cheaper compare to the other guys I checked around town.",UNK
9526,"Ugh. Absent service and super rude when he did come by. When we finally stopped someone else to ask for more water and our check, our waiter came over with attitude and excuses. As we ignored him and stood to leave he yelled sarcastically at our backs about whatever he had been doing. Food was 24-hour Vegas food. Blah.",UNK
9527,"They have great pizza and wings. My only complaint with this restaurant is you can order wings medium one time and their great, the next time there really weak, and than you get the medium that's too hot to eat. They need consistency in their wing sauce!",UNK
9528,"Friendly and very knowledgable. I would recommend to everyone. They asked the appropriate questions and were able to provide choices that were suitable to choose from. There were samples and a very large selection. Place was originally intimidating because of the bars on the windows. However, the vast inventory explains the additional security measures",UNK
9529,"Kale salad was delicious.  Great selection of craft draft beer, whiskey, and other liquor.  Great bartender, great late night spot.  Kitchen is open until 10 for the full menu.",UNK
9530,"Would give this shit place zero stars if possible.  worst customer service ever, people are rude and inconsiderate.  Booked a one night stay in a patio suite and was downgraded to a double bed when I was supposed to get a king.  Sorry sir, since you booked your stay online we give you the worst rooms available....",UNK
9531,"Breakfast was alright here, with pancakes being the highlight.  Biscuits were firm and dry.  Staff was somewhat polite, but after ordering I didn't see from them again (is this full service place or not?).  Little pricey for what you get.",UNK
9532,This place is delicious!! Upon entering this cute restaurant the aroma of spices makes you glad you came in. I have never tried Southern Insian food before and I was blown away!! Our waiter was really nice and helpful as well. We followed his recommendations and were completely satisfied.,UNK
9533,"Try the paloma! From the people who brought you Bramble, there is a new kid in town. Lovely little place on Queen street where they choose your cocktails for you based around what you like drinking.\nWe all loved our drinks and the service was great",UNK
9534,"Tacos were excellent. Although, my tacos came about ten minutes before my friend's. The server was awkward and never checked on us. While my friend was waiting for his food, the server kept asking if we wanted more chips, not our actual order. I'll try this place out again in hopes of better service.",UNK
9535,"YUM, great crust and sauce.  Little pricey but never disappoints... gelato good too.  Garlic fries are ridiculous.",UNK
9536,"This place is great!!  Clean, modern and well maintained.  The entire staff is responsive, friendly, courteous and accommodating which make this the ideal storage facility for my household overflow of items.  I've been renting multiple spaces for the past year and am completely satisfied with their service.",UNK
9537,While the service here was absolutely awful (which I think is commonplace for trendy places nowadays) this place was amazing. The food we had was to die for and the s'mores dessert thing was amazing. I highly recommend getting apps dessert and a bottle of wine. To note: seating is weird and small and inconvenient.,UNK
9538,"I felt really rushed at this location, and the steak had fat in it. There was also way to much salt on the chips, and the cashier was rude.",UNK
9539,Two stars is being generous.  But at least I now have a place to go to if I want rude service and milky coffee drinks.,UNK
9540,I love this place.. They're sides are the bomb I always get the brisket dinner w/mac n cheese & baked beans..,UNK
9541,This place is awesome. We had the ramyun and its so flavorful and yummi. I specially loved the egg inside. We were lucky because we came early for lunch and we found a table but within minutes there was a line up. Tables clear out quickly tho.,UNK
9542,"Every time I go here the place is packed.  Being located in the heart of cityscape it's at a great location. There is always something going on here, live bands, comedy, and good friends.",UNK
9543,"Everything seemed so dry, and the color of the sushi looked a little pale in my opinion. So in other words, not fresh at all. I am not coming back, and will choose a different place.",UNK
9544,We go to this Dunkin Donuts just about every time we viisit Arizona. Donuts are of course always fresh and service is good. I fell in love with the Vanilla Chai drink,UNK
9545,"David and his crew catered our wedding. They were attentive, dressed like chefs...bc they are.. and the guests raved about the food. He made special dishes and was a treat to have there. It was so good. Never missed a beat. These guys are awesome. Go to there cafe TK",UNK
9546,Wow! Amazing restaurant on Nun's Island and fast becoming a favorite go to! They are child friendly and provide good service. The sushi is good and there is a good selection between hot and cold dishes. \n\nTry it out! You won't be disappointed.,UNK
9547,It's alright for my lunch break if it lands during the happy hour.  The atmosphere is nice.  I've yet to be amazed there yet and there is much better sushi joints in Vegas.,UNK
9548,"Pro: \n- beautiful hotel \n- amazing restaurants \n- best room service \n- center of strip \n- best staff \n\nCons: \n- many thing in rooms are broken (i.e.. bathroom door lock, mirror lights)",UNK
9549,"Great food, but you'll pay for it!  Not cheap...  Plus some of the servers aren't Japanese, geez.",UNK
9550,Been enjoying this place for years and they never disappoint! Thank Mario and Ginger for making a true neighborhood restaurant to enjoy with family and friends.,UNK
9551,"Very large buffet. They have sushi, too, I even ate a whole squid thingy. Not bad. You can definitely find SOMETHING you like there. And a plus, they have mee fun, which I find very rarely at a Chinese place. Mostly they have lo mein or something.",UNK
9552,Total Diving is a great SCUBA Diving shop in Montreal. Their staff are very knowledgeable of products and they offer great teaching services.,UNK
9553,"I ordered a blonde beer and a 12 oz N.Y. strip loin steak. The food was good, but what really won me over was the homemade beer. It was crisp and light and just plain better than anything I've had from a bottle or can. A microbrewery restaurant that lives up to its name.",UNK
9554,Amazing Macchiato in a warehouse setting / sharing space with East End Brewing Co.I was soooo grateful for the delicious jolt!\n\nFree cuppa with any bean purchase!,UNK
9555,"I just came here for the view but it made enough of an impression that I'd love to come back fro drinks and food. The view is amazing. On par with Ghostbar. Good music, sexy vibe.",UNK
9556,I stopped going to this place years ago. the food is horrible and the people are sooo rude. and the seafood made me sick. don't waste your time or money,UNK
9557,"This place is amazing.  Finally, I have found a place in veg as that serves some delicious soup and salad with fresh fish.  This is a muat go-to place once per week for lunch.",UNK
9558,"We tried out this place tonight because right up the street and bought a Groupon!  It is a good date atmosphere for sure.  Food was good, but not wonderful...I am glad I tried it out, but most likely would not go back!",UNK
9559,I really enjoyed the breakfast.  I'll defintely will be back for the burgers and different bacon flavors. Mmmmmm,UNK
9560,"Fun if you're a drag queen with disposable income. But for a guy who's just buying heels for fun , not the best. I love their catalogues and wide selection , but the prices are off the charts. I'm not a drag queen , and I don't think I'll be back anytime soon.",UNK
9561,Get ready to wait forever for a drink here. So ridiculous. The staff doesn't prioritize or make drinks in the order that they were ordered. I came in before work and waited almost 30 minutes for my drink. I was so close to walking out!!,UNK
9562,Horrible customer service. Takes 20 minutes just for them to print something out. Employees are rude and don't even acknowledge you when you walk up to them. Won't be coming back here .,UNK
9563,I love this place. My husband and I were able to share a meal because the portions are so big. The food is amazingly delicious.,UNK
9564,"Great work, fixed my tattoo an loved it.. thanks Chris..Thanks Ryan for the referral. Definitely coming back..",UNK
9565,a lot of tacky decor\na lot of average wait help\na lot of messiness in the bathroom\na lot a lot of very average food\nand...\na lot of old people,UNK
9566,"Went in there to grab some treats for our Westie, but should have read the other reviews. Overpriced is an understatement. Most treats were $10-20 (compared to same treats that run $5 at PetSmart) and, no joke, saw a chew toy for $40+.",UNK
9567,I've been a customer for several years. David came out on time and quickly found my leaking tub valve.\n\nYou can't go wrong with Citywide.,UNK
9568,"Showed up at 315 pm. Open sign on, says open till 4. Nobody in side getting cut. Locked door, two guys inside talking and looked at me and just ignored me. Very unprofessional.",UNK
9569,Great little Greek place! Gyros are top notch high quality! They use an actual spit traditional style this is not pre-packaged frozen meat. The falafels are excellent as well!,UNK
9570,First time here and we got the calzones. They were very good only complaint I have is that the bottom of calzones the dough was very soggy by time we got home,UNK
9571,"It makes me sad that Peacemeal closed. It was a great idea and the food was pretty damn good.  Peace out, Peacemeal.",UNK
9572,One star removed from the last review. Still slow and disorganized. Food is still over cooked and under seasoned. Honestly I don't know why we went back when we were so disappointed the first time we tried this buffet.\n\nWill never be returning to Lago...and I mean it this time.,UNK
9573,"We made reservations for this place and when we got there, our table wasn't ready. We had to wait 10mins for our table. Once we were seated, we waited for 30mins and nobody served us even after repeatedly asking for service!! We walked out. Also the place looked a little dirty.",UNK
9574,I'm addicted to their burgers and sweet potato tots! \nTheir medium wings are delicious!\nDavid is our favorite server!,UNK
9575,The chicken philly was over priced and under seasoned.  We paid $22 for 2 sandwiches and we were not impressed at all.  The Cheese Wiz was only on the top of the sandwich not on the bread.   The bread was dry and the chicken was bland.  It was a big let down.,UNK
9576,"I would highly recommend NOT visiting this restaurant. Our sea food appetizer was not fresh, our drinks were not refilled and we waited 3 hours to receive our entrees which were heavily salted. Bad service and bad food.",UNK
9577,This company is so easy to work with. They come on time and clean up really well. A guy is out there skimming my pool for fallen leaves right now. Had them last year and they are back working for me again. Their pricing is fair and they do a great job. I definitely highly recommend them!,UNK
9578,"Recently stayed at this classic old school destination.  Every staff member I encountered treated me like royalty.  The room though, while clean and spacious, had a partially clogged sink and faulty shower faucet. I'd rate it 3.5 stars. Would definitely stay again.",UNK
9579,"The name is misleading as they offer a variety of desserts. I've come here twice for their cupcakes, and they are good, no matter what flavor you get. The cupcakes are apparently gluten free, which means nothing to me as to me the dessert tastes like you're eating sugar and fat, which is good!",UNK
9580,do not buy here!!!!! youve been warned. they double charged us for a wedding cake!!! her bookkeeping consists of a ragged notepad that she scribbles in. stay away!!!!,UNK
9581,"Although the menu was fairly limited, the food was excellent. I had a shrimp wrap with chip, delicious! The bar tenders are great as well.",UNK
9582,Boring lunch specials and I was not impressed with their Pad See ew its so close to my work but I will not be returning.,UNK
9583,I'm quite a big fan of Starbucks coffee but this one I tried today no thanks. OK the espresso shot cans and the cakes were nice as was the atmosphere the tea wasn't as great. I would go back to that one but for a cup of tea I think I'll stick to the one in princes street thanks.,UNK
9584,"Perfection!  I have yet to stay here, but this is my favorite casino to lounge around at.  The place is so nice and seems to have much more class than most of the other casino's in Vegas.  Steve Wynn did it right when he build this place!  Not much more can be said that hasn't already been said.",UNK
9585,Muy expensivo but awesome artisan desserts.   And the coffee.. one of the best I've ever sent between my lips...,UNK
9586,"They served us stale rice.  Average main dishes, not as flavorful.  Not enough meat in the lamb dishes.  Overpriced.",UNK
9587,"An entertaining franchise for most of its existence.  But could never get over the hump to be that elite team..  Successful teams in the early 90s, nice run and gun team in the 21st century.  Tough conference, solid franchise.",UNK
9588,You will see that I go here once and while because I have a friend that likes to stop by for a quick hit of sushi.\n\nI've definitely had better.  I only touch the cooked stuff.  I don't eat raw anything circling and circling and circling around.,UNK
9589,This guy is AMAZING!!! I found his work at the Gilbert Art Walk. I now have a beautiful panoramic canvas print of the Swiss Alps hanging in my house. I am hoping to use him soon for some baby pictures. Very professional!,UNK
9590,"Naw, I went to this club at 10:31pm on a Saturday night and there were no strippers on the dance floor! I asked the bartender when they would come out and she was like, \""I think they could be getting dressed.\"" All of them??",UNK
9591,HOLY MOLY!!! This ain't no Taco Bell and I thank everyone and their mother for that. If you want real mexican food than you owe it to yourself to go here.,UNK
9592,"Best Mexican food in Vegas! By far my favorite place! I'd go back in an instant! Fun waiters, good food, great environment!",UNK
9593,"Phucking Phoenix does it again. TSA is off on break, line about 75 people deep and 1 guy checking ID's. I'd rather take my chances with the terrorist than put up this level of coverage.",UNK
9594,Bill was AMAZING!!\n\nHe took his time and made sure my nails fit my hands perfectly.\n\nI will definitely be back!,UNK
9595,"I love their pulled pork sandwiches.  My boyfriend was impressed with their ribs, which he is rarely impressed with any restaurant's ribs.  Also, they have good sweet tea.  Prices are reasonable.",UNK
9596,"This was my first time here and i got the fish sandwich and could barely finish it and my home cut fries.  The fish market side has some great looking fish, crabs, clams, etc.  I'm looking forward to future visits.",UNK
9597,"The very best PASTA. I take Marc's pasta home and prepare it there. It has good texture, great flavor and of course only takes a moment to cook. My only place to buy   fresh pasta.",UNK
9598,Too much butter in the food. Not a wide variety of vegetarian options. Service was good. Asparagus was bland. Just not very impressed with the flavor or presentation of the food here. Portions are a good size and the biscuits are good.,UNK
9599,"Food was tasteless and terrible.  Lemongrass dishes had no lemongrass.  Veggies seemed fresh, but pad thai was bland.  Red curry was neither red nor did it taste like curry.  I'd give this place a miss.  Staff was nice (hence not one star).",UNK
9600,nothing to eat for lunch! I rate 0 star. do not be fooled by reviews. This one is far worse than Bacchanal in Caesars. never come back here again,UNK
9601,Typical Lowes in the growing area of Northlake. Store was nice and clean and the selection was great. This one is A-OK in my book!,UNK
9602,"This place has a terrific patio, great service, and great food/drinks.  Really fun spot for relaxing with friends and good conversation.",UNK
9603,"Where I do most of my shopping. Pretty basic. Missing some Japanese groceries I would like to find but otherwise, expansive and reasonably priced, I was totally surprised to find this sort of place, having looked for something like the past four years in cleveland, to no avail.",UNK
9604,"Located inside Monte Carlo next to Dragon Noodles. They have a Sunday Red Sauce Dinner with 3 course dinner-salad, entree, dessert. It comes with free breadsticks and marinara sauce. The waiter was good on refills. Nice place to eat there for dinner.",UNK
9605,vdara great hotel to stay at what sets it apart from other hotel no casino means no smoking clean hotel great vies from the room very nice bathroom alot of space in the room nice size kitchen area i been here before i will be back again when i come to vegas one of the best on the strip.,UNK
9606,"One of the best independent coffee shops around...\n\nOwners and staff are gracious, the coffee is strong, the wifi is free and flowing, and they even have a waterfront location. Great atmosphere at night - not what you would expect from a coffee shop in a strip mall.",UNK
9607,"I love Sterling [PERIOD]. I do think, however, the bagels, at $0.95, are a bit pricey, but they are great...not NY, but as close as you can get",UNK
9608,This is by far the BEST Food and Service in Las Vegas hands down.  Thank You to everybody involved in making my experience the BEST.,UNK
9609,NOT WHEELCHAIR FRIENDLY!!!  Casual looking place and smells great.  NO low tables unless you want to sit outside and bake.  Terrible over sight on the part of the owners.,UNK
9610,Had my car towed recently by these guys... Customer service is not something they are told to have... Got picked and the moron driving had such an attitude... Never would I use these guys again!,UNK
9611,Cool spot. Hipster looking lol. More of a restaurant vibe than brewery. Their selection was decent. Light tasting ipa and the typical stout to pilsner list. Bar tender not as attentive but she was aight. 2 stories seems like it could be popping but it was kinda dead at 8pm sat,UNK
9612,High Roller was more like Sloooooooow Roller.   So slow that we all thought it wasn't even moving.  Make sure to go at night!  We went at night and all the lights were amazing.,UNK
9613,This place doesn't even deserve one star! My rims are now scraped on my new Mercedes . Either the guy telling me witch way to turn my wheel screwed up or the car wash scraped them. They weren't scraped before ! So pissed ! Also dryers suck.Don't waste your money .,UNK
9614,"They have awesome Pho Thai here at very reasonable prices. The thin slices of beef aren't fatty either! The staff is very friendly every time I come here as well. If you are in the mood for Pho Thai, I'd definitely recommend this place. One of the best I've found in the valley so far.",UNK
9615,"I typically don't like chain pizza but this place always makes the best pizzas and their delivery service, no matter who it is, are always top notch, professional, it gets delivered on time and always warm.  Great group of people here.  Kudos to them ALL!!!",UNK
9616,The sever forgot about us and my katsu curry tasted like meat gravy. What a waste of my precious hard earned money.,UNK
9617,"I live in El Mirage, there are plenty of pizza places closer but I drive the extra miles because NYPD is the best pizza around. Extremely friendly and helpful staff. If you guys could move to Dysart & Thunderbird I would appreciate it.",UNK
9618,"Amazing, It's expensive but soooo worth it. I'm in love with there lobster cake appetizer.",UNK
9619,"Best Chili Renos when they serve them nice and hot , cheese melting out of them!! Great Chimi and Green Burritos!! The staff there is always friendly and very accommodating, specially the Owner, or maybe he is the manager IDK:) I would recommend it to everyone!!",UNK
9620,Amazing ice wine!! Great service - they go beyond for you. Limited vegetarian options though. Expensive but you definitely get your moneys worth.,UNK
9621,"This place has everything for the perfect date. They had a guy singing called Big White Cloud ? lol He was great, the service was perfect , the outdoor heaters are magical. I will be back !!!!",UNK
9622,O.k BBQ ...we had sausage and BBQ sandwich as well as a burger they were all pretty good my favorite part of the meal was the bbq nacho for a appetizer ...,UNK
9623,qualified vets and techs with a lot of patience to talk to patient owners but it is well known that Banner is very revenue focused and not necessarily suggest things that are not needed but if you took your pet to a private practice you would get just as good care and pay less.,UNK
9624,"I would say this is just your typical Mexican restaurant..nothing too special. I tried a cheese enchilada and pico de gallo. They were both ok. Prices are pretty reasonable, service is good, and the drinks are awesome. I would go for the drinks alone :)",UNK
9625,"Saw Afrojack in October of 2012 was the BEST experience I have ever had at a club. Been to XS multiple times and have always enjoyed it. I do agree with some people though, the prices are a bit expensive, think the cheapest drink is 12 bucks but hey its Vegas and it's a Nightclub.",UNK
9626,"Not the best, but good enough when you're craving some filipino food and dont want to go too far.",UNK
9627,First time and did the drive through.  Only problem was getting around the food supply truck  :)   Order taker was super nice and the barista was great too!  Super yummy latte!,UNK
9628,Service started out ok...then waitress spilled grease in my suit jacket and then it went downhill.  She was replaced and then wait staff was distant from my table. Manager apologized and comped entire meal...but suit is ruined.....very incompetent staff.... Never going to return....,UNK
9629,"Best pizza in town!! I loved the deep dish pizza and cannolis! Also they give out free hot dogs to people with specific names on certain days :-) if you go, I hope it's the day for your name!",UNK
9630,"I love their selection of beers, and the artichoke dip is highly recommended. Never really had the opportunity to order an entree, so hard to speak to that. This place is the ultimate hangout at Tempe and is often crowded at all times of the day. Service is always as efficient as it can get in an atmosphere that busy.",UNK
9631,I wasn't that excited about the breakfast I had. We had the breakfast skillet and the kids had pancakes nothing I tried here was rememberable. I'll have to give it another chance since its in my neighborhood.,UNK
9632,"one of our favs in Madison, very consistent and good, sister-in-law and mother-in-law were impressed last night",UNK
9633,Business has been sold. \n\nKC and his adorable Wife are gone.\n\nNew Sushi Chef prepares food different now.,UNK
9634,"GARBAGE! But hey, the portions of it are huge!!! Sorry, I can't testify to any dishes here.",UNK
9635,"I used to love this place when I lived in AZ....the brats were amazing and even the burgers and curly fries were good.  Not too healthy, but then again, you don't think about that kind of stuff when you go to a hot dog restaurant.",UNK
9636,"Well lit, clean, courteous help, great looking produce, organized, well maintained, and the marinated bulgogi and sides taste great.  Will be returning soon!",UNK
9637,This place was amazing. The service was great - super fast. And the Sushi! So good. The All You Can Eat is totally worth it.,UNK
9638,Really nice place. Went with three people and each had a different type of taco. All were outstanding. Fresh made corn tortillas are awesome. Outdoor patio was perfect for a late afternoon lunch.  Will definitely make Chelsea's a regular stop.,UNK
9639,"Positives: Fresh frozen yogurt and toppings. The toppings are unique and are piled on quite generously. Generally, refreshing.\n\nNegatives: Not much variety on yogurts. This is excusable considering they make everything fresh. \nA little pricey for frozen yogurt.",UNK
9640,"Best home cooked Italian joint in NC so far.  Their special was awesome!  I wanted to get the Shrimp Scampi, but they had a special with shrimp and scallops and I couldn't so no.  Glad I didn't.  Absolutely the best thing ever.  Give this place a  try!",UNK
9641,"Drove by this place on Sunday morning and it looked as if had been abandoned years ago. The only reason I bother to try this place were because of the great reviews posted here, but I wouldn't believe a word they are saying",UNK
9642,"Do you like flies (Not just fruit flies but house flies, a lot of them)? Do you like big oppressively noisy rooms (seriously guys, get some acoustic treatment)? Do you like flavorless meat, sandy cornbread and watered down barbecue sauce?\nThen this is the place for you, enjoy!",UNK
9643,"Not very impressed.  Burger was ok, fries Looked great, but mushy\nTry Smashburger!!  Sooo much better",UNK
9644,So happy I found this shop on Yelp. Jason was a lot of help and fixed my car for $400 less than what Toyota quoted me. Looks like I found my go to shop for car repairs.,UNK
9645,Being from Chicago I thought the pizza was totally weak compared to what I'm used to. But I think it is awesome that they supported the protesters and that they delivered late at night right to my hotel room.,UNK
9646,"Not very interesting execution of their lunch items.\nSmoked trout spread was heavy on the mayo.\nBut, very nice staff!",UNK
9647,Low key establishment.  Its consistent so you usually know what you're in for.  Bar tenders are pretty cool - its the same hard working and nice young guys every time I go there (weekends).,UNK
9648,"Smiles served daily? When I went there, no smiles, servers didn't know what they were doing, orders took a long time. However, they did say they were still working out the links. The croissants tasted fine but the coffee was not good at all. Not impressed.",UNK
9649,Great cut. They take they're time and are very friendly. Great price and clean atmosphere. This is my new barber shop.,UNK
9650,"Stopped by for breakfast before we left Pittsburgh.   The service was horrible, the food was served quickly but not all that memorable.    Looks like we'll be sticking with DeLucas' for breakfast next time we are back in Pittsburgh.",UNK
9651,"Yuck, was hoping for good food so close by but once was enough. This place is not for foodies let alone for people who have even few taste buds left.",UNK
9652,"Insanity!\n\nIt is a beautiful place to be, but drinks are nothing but suga and wata.\n\nI did not get drunk, insanity.",UNK
9653,Awful customer service. Friend and I spent a fortune. Wouldn't take my credit card because the numbers weren't embossed. Lied to us and said no rooms after giving us tons of liquor.,UNK
9654,"Had a burger, it was decent, fries are freshly cut. The soda machine features a company that uses pure cane sugar with is a nice touch. The salads looked better than the burger - very big.",UNK
9655,The new French menu has left out some of our favorites and has replaced them with unispired so-called French items. Not a good idea. This is not a French restaurant! Where is the Santa Fe omelette???,UNK
9656,Jamie was my stylist and she was amazing. My blow out was great! I have hair that most stylist shy away from but Jamie went in without a hesitation and took care of my hair with time to spare! She's also an amazing colorist!,UNK
9657,"Carnegie Deli next door at The Mirage is way better than the at best mediocre stuff they're pushing here.  I lived in NYC for 10 years and this isn't even close a 3 star place there.  Thin sandwiches, stingy portions of meat and wtf are they doing with the toast there?",UNK
9658,I know that America's Taco Shop is known for its carne asada but I love their bean and cheese burro. I also enjoy their salsa. I agree that the size of the burro isn't as big as the 'hole' in the wall around the corner from my house but the food is great.,UNK
9659,Pizza was good but the service tonight was not so great. Didn't even get someone to refill after 30min until they heard the last slurp of soda. First time here and even though food was good won't come back due to service.,UNK
9660,"The Clarendon was exactly what I was hoping for. Great room, very friendly staff, amazing pool area, and ultra gay-friendly. Would recommend!",UNK
9661,Brought 3 set of snow tires. Great customer services and good price on the tires. Knowledge people and super fast service to replace new tire.,UNK
9662,Love the bison burger!! And the fries are amazing!! I look forward to going there just for the buger! A definite must try!!,UNK
9663,"I love eating there.  The food is always so good and healthy.  The Mediteranian chicken salad is my favorite, but I have enjoyed every meal.  The seating is too crowded and they are always busy, but it is worth being a bit cramped.",UNK
9664,"This place is totally new and very clean.  Only reason I gave it a 3 stars is that it is really far from the strip casinos which is where we like to hangout.  If you don't go to the strip, then this place is will be a 5 stars for sure.",UNK
9665,"This is an excellent buffet. They have a wide variety of food, including an extensive sushi selection. Everything was hot and fresh, and the price was right. We'll be back!",UNK
9666,Mediocre at best and way over price for what you get.  I'll stick to good old Vig's Deli. \nAt least I get my money's worth!!,UNK
9667,Really enjoyed the wild mushroom enchiladas.  Service was uninspired.  Would have given a 4 if the waitress seemed to have any desire to be there...,UNK
9668,"Awesome food, great service across the board. The patio is big and very inviting even in the hot summer months. Opened three weeks ago, and I've been six times already.",UNK
9669,This is my favorite QT in Gilbert. I am in this particular location at least twice a week. I love they have a large food and snack selection. I love that this location has soft serve ice cream. The staff here is wonderful and the bathrooms are always clean,UNK
9670,"Actually real Chinese food is far more delicious than those in Panda Express, those food in Panda is extremely oily. It tastes okay but remember its not real Chinese food.",UNK
9671,One of my favorite rooftops in Pittsburgh! Great spot for a bit party and the staff there knows how to take care of a crowd. It's become one of my favorite haunts.,UNK
9672,Discovered dessert. Yuzu pannacotta. Soooo good. A great end to a \nWonderful meal. Love love it.,UNK
9673,"No no no: No effective customer service, no quality construction, no proper pricing. Yes: trendy stuff.  The clerk at the register was downright rude. Nobody offered any assitance when we were shopping. My daughter decided to stick with Forever 21 for future trips to the Fashion Show.",UNK
9674,I've come here once w my family and twice w my company. The food is ok- edible but definitely catered to Americans. Not much flavor or spice. Place is clean though and in a good location. If I were footing the bill I'd be headed for some of \nthe better Indian restaurants in charlotte.,UNK
9675,We got to the movie theater 40 minutes early thinking we would get a quick bite to eat. We ended up getting into the theater 5 minutes after it started and getting the worse seats because if the wait time (there was maybe 7 people in the whole place btw).,UNK
9676,"Good local place. Beer was nice, cold and cheap. Food was mediocre,  decent bar food. Service was nice and fast.",UNK
9677,"No nonsense, affordable prices.  Had my Audi in for service with Dan (someone whom I have total confidence in and have known since he worked at Chapman), no complaints as usual.",UNK
9678,Fast and friendly service! The food was flavorful and tasted fresh. Service was efficient and atmosphere was lively and great for families or casual dining.  We'll be back for sure!,UNK
9679,"Consistently great service. Pretty standard food quality for a high end chain. Have really enjoyed this location both when busy and quiet.  Cocktails aren't particularly exciting or strong, but a great wine selection makes up for it.  Best way to describe the experience, 'consistent'.",UNK
9680,Dunkin coffee never seems to be strong enough.  Of course any coffee will do when you need it but I recommend getting it from some place else if you can.  Dunkin is a matter of convenience for me when I am in great need and that's about it.,UNK
9681,I happened to walk in here for an impromptu lunch.  The food is good.  The real deal. I recommend the Chang Mai and Soup #2. Anyone who criticizes this food does not know good Thai.,UNK
9682,Great food at a reasonable price. I have been there a couple of times now and will return. Nothing fancy but good service and tasty pitas. I've had the chicken shawarma and the BBQ chicken. Yum!,UNK
9683,The food and the service here is exceptional. Especially if you are lucky enough to get Ryan as your server. I can't rave about the food enough. I have eaten here countless times and can't recall a single bad dish or experience.,UNK
9684,official update.\n\nmy friend got bed bug bites all over her cheeks and neck on the right side of her body.  We are officially making a complaint.  Its very upsetting and were taking this to corporate.\n\nHave not heard anything from Travelodge yet. -__-.,UNK
9685,Everything I've had here has been very good! The chocolate cakes was amazing.. Great choice of macarons and good price. The quiches are also delicious!,UNK
9686,Oooh this place always has my taste buds going!! I recommend there weekly soups and amazing salads (: and of course there cheesecake and Ice teas. You should never leave dissatisfied here,UNK
9687,SO DELICIOUS! I got three scoops and asked the worker to surprise me and my tummy was happy.,UNK
9688,"Zoyo Frozen Yogurt is always a blast. If you're a tad more money conscious like me, I'd recommend you opt out of the toppings, as here you are charged on weight. Regardless though, there are some toppings you can never go wrong with!",UNK
9689,"The food was good, as was the service for dinner.  Not much of an ambiance to the place, but definitely a relaxed atmosphere.",UNK
9690,took awhile. must explore the rest of the menu. cool vibe. zucchini bread was spicier than i was expecting.,UNK
9691,"One of my favorite restaurants in las vegas! The sauce they use is amazing, i usually get the shrimp and king crab legs, both are always on point! The shrimps are always a great size, and the crab is awesome! Also the Cajun fries are a nice side as well!",UNK
9692,"Not the best in town, and no clear vegitarian/vegan options. I always have to adjust my order to fit my dietary needs and then pray it comes out correctly. My suggestion is to walk across the parking lot to Komol Thai, way better and more bang for your buck!",UNK
9693,"DO NOT TAKE THIS SERVICE- unless you have more than an hour to wait! Took a taxi, more expensive but better than wasting away at the curb due to Showtime's poor, SLOW service!",UNK
9694,"I purchased their Groupon last week.  Overall, I was very impressed with these guys.  The pizza was very good, and we got a small order of wings too.  The wings were large drumsticks, which were excellent.  \n\nI will be giving these guys another shot.  Their groupon worked!",UNK
9695,3.0 / 5 - Asian Tartare with Tuna\n2.0 / 5 - Cuban Sushi Roll: Very salty\n3.0 / 5 - Bistec\n4.0 / 5 - Peruvian Poke,UNK
9696,Delicious seafood. Server was attentive. They need to have claw crackers it was difficult for my party to open the seafood & they don't slice the legs open for uou,UNK
9697,"I will be back to this place.  Its simple, clean, good atmosphere, good concept.  Grab a cup, grab some yogurt, grab some toppings, weigh the cup, pay for the cup.  Its that simple, its that good!",UNK
9698,"simply fantastic, been here 4 days straight since they opened, the lemon custard is amazing in their banana splits. i would go EVERY DAY.",UNK
9699,Claim Jumpers is overpriced and overrated. The fried zucchini from Carls Jr. is better than Claim Jumpers. Their portions are large and filling but the lack of taste leaves you with no motivation to finish.,UNK
9700,"-Irish pub atmosphere (that's what you were expecting, right?).\n-Patio for when you need some fresh air.\n-Occasional live folk music.\n-Decadent bread pudding: totally worth it no matter what you're drinking.",UNK
9701,I would not go to or order a pizza from this place. Raw pizza when asked for well done. Employees have a bad attitude the worst pizza restaurant in Southern Nevada. I will never go back to this place.,UNK
9702,"A favorite casual dining place with great food and great service. Came as you are and enjoy anything from Sushi to General Sao Chicken. Beef and broccoli to Asian noodles it's all great. Beer, wine and cocktails as well.",UNK
9703,There was nobody running the drive through of this location at 1130pm on a Monday night. I stopped in and waited for about 5 minutes at the drive through. I was never greeted or served. Needless to say I was very disappointed to have wasted my time and gas driving to this location for nothing.,UNK
9704,The first time in had a burger and fries. They were ok. The second time had a hot dog here. It tasted ok but made me feel pretty sick later. Won't be going back.,UNK
9705,"I like this casino, even though its small and the floor drinks are bad lol. I like the $1 beer and the fact that it feels like old school Vegas. Stayed here once, wouldn't stay here again, but the slots pay out ok.",UNK
9706,Love brick oven pizza (I have on in my backyard!)  Pizza Brutta disappoints greatly.  Crust is suprisingly below average.  Toppings are average.  Many better places to go for good pizza.  I have been here four or five times and have been dissappointed each and every time.,UNK
9707,Nice ambience and delicious food! Its never too crowded and the salmon green curry is amazing... This is my favorite thai place in the area. I wish they delivered during the day though :(,UNK
9708,"I have been here several times and they have the best cheesesteaks. I was not impressed with the mexican food I ordered, but the classic cheesesteak with onion is the best, and don't forget onion rings.",UNK
9709,Just moved to mountains edge and I really enjoy this bar! Everyone was really nice. We have some BBQ and I thought it was delicious!,UNK
9710,Son said his Mochi was hard. Hubby and I thought this place isn't as good as yogurtland as far as flavors and quality.,UNK
9711,My chai latte was lukewarm. Coffee was more on the watery side. Seating was crowded and inconvienent. Service was offstandish and slightly rude. Croissant was awful and beyond dry. \nOverpriced. Wont be coming back anytime soon.,UNK
9712,"Yum! They have an alcoholic shake that is really yummy..I forgot what it was called. It was green with chocolate. Whatever it is, get that! Oh, and I guess their burgers are pretty good too:-)",UNK
9713,Loooooove this place! Had Dan as my waiter! Whatta hunk! I'll be back for sure!!!!!!,UNK
9714,"Wont be back. Ridiculously expensive, bad service, and tacky decor. Despite our waitress forgetting to bring drinks until we asked for them 20 minutes later, the food tasted good. Wish the portion sizes were bigger.",UNK
9715,Amazing!  Be prepare to eat. The host was great he explain how the dinning experience works.  Staff will come around with different type of meat and you can select what you want. Expensive but worth it.,UNK
9716,"Tried some coffee here and it was alright. It's an alternative to Starbucks, but there isn't really anything here that makes it different from Starbucks in my opinion. I'd love to see a coffee shop that sells coffee at much cheaper prices; that'd be a dream.",UNK
9717,I love this place!  Very friendly and helpful.  And they carry hard to find supplements like GLEE!  It keeps me going!,UNK
9718,"Came here because of the cheap price but a lot of buffets offer specials like this. This place had no character, the waitress had no character either, just came and left. Mandatory to tip 10%  the food wasn't very good. Best thing there was the jello.  Wouldn't return.",UNK
9719,"Just all right.  2 slices of paper thin cheese pizza and a drink for $6.50.  I've had better.  Napoli Pizza, for one, seems to carry a better value for the money.",UNK
9720,"It is a very nice and elegant place, but without the high price tags. Friendly and fast service.  We loved the onion rings, the chicken tenders and the steak. But no so much the mashed potatoes. We highly recommend it.",UNK
9721,"I  worked with Africans in KC and ate a lot of their great food.  This is the best.  I LOVED it.  Tastey and worth the trip from Ahwatukee.  Seriously, if you want great taste go for it.  It doesn't get any better from Africa.",UNK
9722,"HORRIBLE !!!!! don't waste your money here ! i went in for a haircut and got out with my hair looking horrible, it's cheap but you pay for what you get. Horrible place. at least this salon.",UNK
9723,"Food was bad but the delivery was unbelieveable. It took forever and the driver had the audacity to tell me he didn't have change for my order. It cost $13 and I had $20. That's a little more than a fifty percent tip for terrible,  cold pizza and long wait time. Never again.",UNK
9724,This place is sooo super cute! Odorless so you don't have the acrylic smell and they do excellent work! I definitely recommend this place.,UNK
9725,This was my first time here and I really enjoyed it. My date and I got the flaming cheese and a large appetizer platter and we were full! I will definitely go again.,UNK
9726,I was craving a burger.  So I went to Blu Burger and boy did it hit the spot.  The ingredients were fresh and tasty. I really enjoyed the location.  You can bring dogs on the patio. So next time my dogs will join me. :),UNK
9727,"Absolutely delicious. This place came highly recommended, and it is clear why. We shared a variety of dishes and everything was wonderful. The drunken noodle prawns were a favorite, and the pad Thai was the best we've ever had. They also had a seriously impressive and extensive wine list, and great service.",UNK
9728,"This place has a great patio but that is all it has going for it. Mediocre food, weak expensive drinks and TERRIBLE service. Don't waste your time. The servers are rude and you will wait half an hour before anyone even bothers to come by. What a waste of a good location.",UNK
9729,I LOVE this nail salon. Clean! Clean! Clean! Even the bathrooms! They do a wonderful job on my toes and fingers and I always leave feeling pretty and special. I've been to A LOT of nail salons in charlotte and this one is my favorite.,UNK
9730,Found out not too long ago that they're opening up another restaurant in Village Square!! My only concern is that the food stays the same but nonetheless I am STOKED!,UNK
9731,Will not be back.  Was seated at a dirty table had to point out that the coasters were all dirty. Food was not as good as recent visits blooming onion very greasy and ribs appeared to have been warmed up then just cooked my opinion,UNK
9732,"Really friendly and attentive service. Went in for the lunch buffet which was totally worth it for $9. They made fresh nan bread for us and another table, nice touch. Good  chicken tikka masala, perfect rice, everything I tried was good-to-really good. We will be going back!",UNK
9733,"This is a great dive bar.  We were there on off nights and it was a pretty sparse crowd, but we were kept amused by all the straights coming in and getting liquored up before going to the straight bathhouse.  Bartenders were friendly and the locals were welcoming...",UNK
9734,Big dude making the subs has a really bad attitude. He seems like he does not want to be there.  Cheer up dude! At least u have a job! Cashier is cool though. ..,UNK
9735,"Not sure if it was the time of day that we went, but nothing was fresh. I thought the pizza would save it, buy even that sucked. I will never go back and regret not going to the Rio.",UNK
9736,I got the double combo and would have to say I was not impressed at all in fact I threw half the burger away. The burger itself was not seasoned and tasted like sub par quality meat. The only reason it got a two was because the fries were okay. I won't be going back.,UNK
9737,I was surprised to see this fast food type Indian food place.  The food was good and at first didn't think the portions were going to be enough but was full when finished. I would return again at some point.  I prefer the buffet style Indian restaurants where you can choose your menu items and go back if desired.,UNK
9738,"I was unfortunate enough to come here, not of my own decision. I sat through an hour of slow service, terrible food, and noisy children. I walked out to my car across the fake grass as fast as I could.",UNK
9739,Been there a bunch of times and can say decent food crappy attitude until today now even the food is bad. Poor prep employees just don't care. Time for a new manager.,UNK
9740,"My family went here last night, we ordered: butterscotch, chocolate covered strawberry, and drumstick. They were amazing! The chocolate covered strawberry buttercream literally tasted like fresh strawberries! We loved it and will be back for sure!! Also, very friendly service!",UNK
9741,Great service and food!!! Been a customer for years...  Chicken Parmesan sub... And there pizza sub are so yummy!!! always Fresh ingredients...,UNK
9742,Great food. Chef was fairly entertaining. Staff was friendly. Just took 1.5 to get served even with a reservation. Everything else was so good they still get 4 stars.,UNK
9743,"APS is a piece of crap.  Charging me 3 days at house I never lived in. The moron Jason received our transfer to moved, and put the wrong address in.  Stupid monkey talked to a supervisor Pat? and she didn't do nothing.  I wish SRP services this area im in.  One day hopefully.",UNK
9744,"This place has a nice atmosphere, but the food is average I think at best. A little overpriced for the quality of food, but a nice place for a drink",UNK
9745,"I like the food, but every time I've gone (about 7 or 8 times) I've had absolutely horrible service. We even walked out once after 15 minutes of not even being brought drinks. Finally learned my lesson. It isn't just 1 waiter or 1 cook. The whole place moves at a snail's pace.",UNK
9746,I have only been to this Village Pub location but it has set the standard I expect from all of them. The beer is brewed locally and hits the spot every time and I was particularly pleased with the food. For bar food it is pretty damn good. Kudos to Danny the bartender.,UNK
9747,The food was good.  I enjoyed their sides and cornbread and thought the ribs were decent but not the best I ever had.  The staff was great and we even got a complimentary bottle of their famous sauce for being a firstime guest.  That was definitely very thoughtful and I would go again for the great service and food.,UNK
9748,"I've eaten here twice. It is rather good food for airport food. While the items themselves aren't that memorable (burgers, sandwiches, etc.) the ingredients seem really excellent and the quality is high. If I need to eat at the Phoenix airport, this is where I'll go.",UNK
9749,Great food & super friendly staff! Older hotel but clean & well kept! A historic gambling site for those who want the old school style treatment.,UNK
9750,Eh. Blase menu and food execution. Excellent location and pretty nice interior but atmosphere is sterile. \n\nMany better options in Charlotte.,UNK
9751,"Gross...got the carna asada steak, so bland...it was just a bad quality piece of meat and not marinated nor seasoned.  Also had a quie a bid of fat on it which carne usually doesn't.",UNK
9752,"I'm a big fan of Lipp. Yeah, they can be pricey but the array of clothing should make any woman happy. I've purchased several items here including a red snake skin purse which I just love. The jewelry is amazing. I really need to stay away from this place!",UNK
9753,"I'll keep it short. The decor is boring, chicken sausage skillet flavorless, walnut toastie dry and forgettable,BUT french onion soup was delicious.\nAll in all for the price there are other options nearby to \""EAT\""",UNK
9754,"as a big fan of Lidia's, i was anxious to eat at her restaurant, and it was totally awesome. would highly recommend.  Food was excellent. wait staff was attentive. we arrived early for our reservation and they were able to seat us.  it was a lot of fun and the decor was awesome too.",UNK
9755,"Dirty, old fitness equipment that always has one or more pieces a visit that is out of order.\n\nI am actually canceling my membership today. \n\nMy wife really enjoys body pump classes. She would rate it a 4.",UNK
9756,Super friendly service!!! there was a good amount of available cheap ($10) flower arrangements to $80+. not a huge selection but enough to fit my needs on short notice.,UNK
9757,Blake and his crew at Window Pro came through for us 100%.  They quickly and professionally handled my sunscreen needs on our house from initial questions to perfect installation.  Their service and product quality meet the highest standards.  I will definitely be using Window Pro for my next job and have already recommended them to someone else.,UNK
9758,Honestly I always wanted to try this place and was disappointed....I ordered a poutine to go and honestly you don't get much for $5.16 after 4 bites its gone  sauce nothing special....oh yeah maybe its the olive they put on top that costs a fortune!!,UNK
9759,Excellent lunch today for the six of us. The food was delicious and our server was just great. Brisket and pulled pork were both cooked to perfection.,UNK
9760,Papaya milk tea with boba.  Too much powder.  Nice flat screen TV though.  The quality of tea is highly dependent on who is working that day.,UNK
9761,"For a taco shop, those were some pretty tasteless tacos!  I was so uninspired with what I was served that I did not even take a picture. My wife had fish tacos that were dry and also tasteless.",UNK
9762,"Updated...not that it matters cuz the location dictates that this place will stay open but I have to say, they have the ABSOLUTE worst service.  Horrible.",UNK
9763,"Save your money! Go gamble, go eat a wonderful dinner & drinks, go dancing somewhere less pretentious and more fun.  Overcrowded in dancing areas!!! Empty rooms where nothing was going on. Terrible layout.  Rooms were categorized by race! Weird vibe overall.",UNK
9764,"WORST HOTEL EVER. \n\nIf there was a prostitute hotel. This would be it. \n\nThere was more problems with this hotel than working things. \n\nThe internet doesn't work, EVER. Thank GOD my phone has hotspot.",UNK
9765,"Had a great time!  The bartender was very nice.  Good blues music.  Played an Earth, Wind and Fire song that was off the chain!  We did a little dancing too!  We will definitely be back.  :)",UNK
9766,"There bathroom Is nasty!  Really Dillards!\n\nI like Dillards, but this bathroom.....OMG, I felt like I was in the  Walmart bathroom!\n\nThey have some good sales going on right now 50% off.",UNK
9767,What can I say it's a bus station right?? Well this one is at least clean and doesn't have a bunch of crack-heads running around like in the big American city stations. Restrooms seem to be clean as well. I have nothing to complain about.,UNK
9768,Service was awesome had a waitress that was very attentive and gave great recommendations! Leak soup by far one of the best soups I have ever tried. Very unique food but good,UNK
9769,Everything about this place is amazing! The atmosphere and tasty food and drinks are amazing. I strongly recommend the Nutella hot chocolate. The cupcakes and cake pops are also amazing! This place is wonderful and it's a great place to bring your kids or meet up with a group of friends!,UNK
9770,The worst service I ever saw !! Especially if you are not from USA. They just using the high rating on Yelp and do nothing to keep it. I recommend to go to Cabo Wabo instead.,UNK
9771,"I love the wings but the service is atrocious, I come here every week and every time I'm shocked by the lack of management and disregard for basic customer service. If you come here DO NOT I repeat, DO NOT make plans for after. You will be here for a while.",UNK
9772,"Looooved this garden, it was very beautiful and peaceful, I couldn't stop snapping pictures. I was in luck because they had the butterfly exhibition, I felt like I was in a butterfly wonderland. :) great place to get inspired and have a peaceful walk.",UNK
9773,Worst ever all sorts of plumbing issues. Water is shut off for hours and hours up to 26 hrs is the record don't live here,UNK
9774,Komex is amazing. You must get the flautas with spicy guacamole and the pork belly musubi is to die for.,UNK
9775,I really liked the atmosphere here but I went when it wasn't very crowded (around 2). Otherwise I wouldn't have liked it nearly as much.,UNK
9776,"Nice hot, perfectly made Latte.\nGreat Customer Service, but feels under staffed, resulting in tables not being cleared.\nHowever, it is certainly worth 4 Stars.",UNK
9777,Good pizza... When they get it right. This pizza joint used to be great but after 4 consecutive bad pizzas I have given up. They don't really care about the customer feedback as nothing changed.,UNK
9778,Food was marginal at best and too expensive. Service was attentive but borderlined being pushy and oppressive. It was pretty clear they were trying to turn over as many tables as possible. I am not interested in going back.,UNK
9779,Rooms were not bad.  Breakfast bar was horrible.  Dry and cold food.  Missing some items that were not restocked.  Limited selection.  Don't waste 11.00 on garbage.,UNK
9780,"I like to drink as much as the next person but Essen Haus promotes binge drinking and throwing up.  The food here is beyond reproach.  With so many choices in Madison why go to some place and force feed yourself beer to the point of throwing up when you can get drinks, better music and better crowd in tons of other bars.",UNK
9781,"Great groomer, great pricing, they always go the extra mile. Our dogs doesn't play well with others but they always make her feel comfortable and take great care of her.",UNK
9782,"The surgeon was good, but the Anesthesiologist was a joke.  Full of himself.  Thought he was a top notch surgeon.  not impressed.",UNK
9783,Horrible.... simply a horrible manicure .... I will never return here again cut me 5 times in a 12 minute manicure,UNK
9784,I attend a lunch seminar here so my review is not based on a personal dinner or lunch experience. The steak was excellent and prepared perfect. Very upscale and great seafood items on the menu if you are not a meat lover.,UNK
9785,"Here for conference.  Convenient location, attractive setting. Service was fine (not exceptional). Calamari and Greek fries a virtual sodium fest. Saganaki was good. Three humus platter a disappointment - they only had one flavor left. Over charged us, we had to have the bill corrected.",UNK
9786,"Stopped in for lunch had the maza plate,stuffed eggplant and beef kabob everything was very fresh and delicious We will definitely  be back",UNK
9787,"I went here for the first time about a month ago and I was really impressed with the selection of wines and the food as well. The night I went, there was live acoustic music and the atmosphere was great. I highly recommend going here for a fun night out with some friends!",UNK
9788,"Since there are not a lot of good Chinese restaurant, I thought I give it a try. Well, the atmosphere is better than typical Chinese restaurant. The food is average fusion. Not too expensive. But not worth it.",UNK
9789,"Well, I ate at the bar. I was expecting more - the burger was 'ok' but nothing special. I had better elsewhere in Vegas. This place is probably good if you're in a rush.",UNK
9790,"I used to go there to get a massage once a month, when they;ve had some REALLY nice local discounts (90$ per session...), it was incredible!\nCame back after they changed the prices, it was still very good, but too pricey for me...",UNK
9791,It's my first time coming here and the place is pretty good. I like they're menu choices ill be sure to come back again. Try the Kalua Pig Benedict for breakfast.,UNK
9792,Best Poke in Vegas! Love this place and the selection.  Little disappointed when I walked out to my car and realized I was still in Nevada! Friendly people serving great food.,UNK
9793,"Bad service, the hotel is VERY old and not well maintained.\nI give the two starts only for the location: kind of cool to be right in front of fremont st.",UNK
9794,I come here regularly.\n\nTheir fish and chips are very good and the seafood chowder is excellent.\n\nThe beer is cold and they have a very decent selection on tap.\n\nMy only complaint would be that their happy hour includes no decent beer.,UNK
9795,Food is ok but more upset that they add 10 percent gratuity  to all takeout orders. That should be my choice. Not thrilled!,UNK
9796,The food is below par. I asked for the best steak available and it was horrible. It's not as good as I remember from 7+ years ago. There are too many other local places that are better.,UNK
9797,"For some reason this Canes just taste better than all the Canes, like its really amazing! But anyways, I really only like Canes because of the sauce and the bread. The chicken actually has no flavor by itself and the fries get all soggy in the box, but that freakin sauce makes you forget all of that!",UNK
9798,"I love this airport... whether your arriving or departing, you move quickly.  I love how well organized parking and taxi/shuttle service is.... the taxi lines move quick.  Tons of shops, food, and slots to pass the time. Free wi-fi is a PLUS!",UNK
9799,"Food is great, drinks are better.  The beers is almost a slushy, which I love!  Service could be better, server seemed put off by questions... Never a good sign.  Service affects my experience immensely, so this place gets two stars\n\nService much improved!",UNK
9800,Kept waiting in a line for a Buffett at entrance for 20 minutes ... No excuses!!!)\n\nDumb dumb,UNK
9801,I will definitely come back to this place when am craving for good pad thai. I have to say so far the best in phoenix.,UNK
9802,"I have family out in Vegas..And its a MUST to stop by when we come into, In the middle of our stay, and right before we leave. Carne asada fries are the shit! The shrimp Burrito is pretty gnarly too..",UNK
9803,Well when they say cheese they mean nacho cheese! If I wanted nacho cheese I could have made my own food! It was soggy an an kinda gross but my husband loved his burrito! So at least one of us was happy!,UNK
9804,Best all you can eat sushi place in town!!! I come here all the time!! Amazing!!! The seared tuna is out of this world!!! If your a local they have a stamp card and after 9 purchases you get one free!!!!,UNK
9805,New management reached out to me about my bad experience. Upgraded to 3 stars based on the effort it took to do so. I will update again when I get a chance to go back and see how things have improved.,UNK
9806,Wow.  What a great addition to the mid-Scottsdale dining scene.  Lots of good wine choices and fun little plates to share.  My favorite was the orrchiete pasta with sausage.,UNK
9807,This place is a nightmare. The price is appealing but not worth it. The room I was given has water damage in the ceiling near the window. The light fixtures were hanging out of the ceiling and were surrounded by mold. And the door would not lock. I asked for a refund and left immediately.,UNK
9808,Excellent southern Italian style dishes. Food is served family style so a small portion will feed two people. Avoid anything made with aioli as they do not do a good job with this.,UNK
9809,\u00a35 surcharge for paying by card. It's that difficult seemingly for the hassle. I didn't use them and got a 5% instead from another firm. 60pence,UNK
9810,"Fantastic cocktails, service, lots of thoughtful complimentary tidbits offered through dinner, and an AMAZING 3 month aged ribeye.  The background music did take me off guard, but I have to say it doesn't detract.  Truly, the service was fantastic.  This place deserved better than 3.5 stars.",UNK

9814,"The rewards card is great. This is the place to go in Sunny Slop for Great Food, Wines and Service. Smoked salmon for Sunday brunch is traditional and delicous",UNK
9815,"Hawaiian Philippine breakfast fusion.  Place is small service is great.  Unfortunately didn't get to try one of their specialty pancakes, just got the regular pancakes.  Had the Kahlua pork Benedict and a Santa Fe omelet.  Guess I need to get the specialty pancakes to make the food experience better.",UNK
9816,"Pros: friendly staff (???)\nCons: took too long for the food to come, ambiance is really confusing, food was ok, nothing special. TVs are playing sports making the ambiance even more confusing.",UNK

9830,"I call in here as little as possible. The bar staff are tone faced. Its a working mans pub. Regulars dour faced. No sky TV, no atmosphere, no food. The only redemption I can think of is,there are two exit doors. Not for me I'm afraid.",UNK
9831,"I absolutely love this place. It's not too pricey compared to other french restaurants in town and definitely not stuffy. The beef and asparagus crepes are the best. They often have live music and people singing on the weekends, which I love.",UNK
9832,"We had to have our patio roof replaced. These guys did excellent work, quick turn around, great price quote and very professional. We are very please with the work completed and will be using them in the future!",UNK

And even though a slight misunderstanding when I first purchased the jewelry ended up with me getting another size, they were so nice and understanding and didn't charge for the new jewelry. Highly recommend.",UNK

9837,"I literally walked in a giant circle looking for this supposed \""waterfront\"" and when I finally discovered it, I just had to stop and laugh. It has potential to be a neat place to hang out, but they gotta do some more development. At least it's close to other stuff!",UNK
9838,Terrible pizza.  I can buy a better pizza at HT.  Staff is very unfriendly. I don't see why this has so many stars.  Nasty is the word to describe the unsavory taste. I would rather drive 15 miles to Wolfmans Pizza.,UNK
9839,I am VERY VERY picky about eating out at italian restaurants but La Stalla definitely made the grade.  The bread was very flavorful and satisfying and the sweet potato ravioli was magnificent.  Prices were very reasonable as well plus the service was great.,UNK

9841,"If you're looking for high-end cigarettes, you'd be better off trying Smokes Unlimited or One Stop Smoke Shop.  This place doesn't even carry many of popular higher-end US brands.  If you're looking for imports, good luck.",UNK

9844,"A bit blah really.. They USED to have huge portions - not any more... Menu is a bit restricted, especially when compared to somewhere like The Cheesecake Factory. Service was mediocre... All in all, underwhelming and uninspiring.",UNK
9845,"Not liking Red Robin is analogous to not liking freedom. It's a good burger at a good price. It's family friendly: arcade games, TVs, and the 'Red' bird mascot will bring a smile to people of all ages. I've gone for many years and I won't be stopping anytime.",UNK
9846,"Quick fix, good prices. Not the brightest light bulbs in the pack (making me visit with return trips to finish one small project) but all in all I know what and where to find what I need.",UNK

9851,"Late night food prepared with no regard. HUGE menu with a lot of options, but it's just not very good. I've had quite a few things on the menu. But hey, if it's late and you just need food- food is served quick and they seem to be pretty helpful towards the intoxicated.",UNK
9852,Tucked in a small plaza. The service is fast and employees are welcoming. The only reason I gave then 4 stars is because they do not deliver past jones and tropicana. Great subs and price is not bad,UNK

They aren't usually well-organized or clean and no matter when I stop by they are always crowded. \n\nI have stopped at this location on a number of occasions out of pure convenience but there are plenty of better locations in town, so I avoid whenever I can.",UNK
9854,am a retired chef the stuff i used to trim or throw away is what they served!\nwe are a group of  men on way to airport\ni think maybe they served us crappy food because we looked like tourists,UNK
9855,like other restaurants on the LV strip.. you're gonna pay a bit of premium.. nevertheless.. they pour a proper black and tan.. and their fish and chips are pretty damn good.. it's pricy.. but the food is solid.. they also have plenty of beers which is always a plus,UNK

9858,Great dim sum place inside the gold coast casino. If you are brave enough to take in second hand smoke then go for this Chinese restaurant. Service is fast. Once you are seated the dim sum carts would come to you like flies. They are great tasting esp the congee and shrimp dumplings.\nCheap  and affordable.,UNK
9859,Love chick-fil-A but I ordered 2 chicken sandwiches and only got 1 today. Luckily they didn't charge me for 2. Guess it was just miscommunication still love this place though. Seriously Chick-Fil-A sauce is a gift from the Mormon gods.,UNK

9863,Needs help in all refrigeration containers; the refrigerated products are not as fresh or last as long as other store locations.,UNK

9874,"I don't bank at Chase.  But my brother does.  He needed to go the bank, and this branch was the closest one he found from strip.  So, as an convenience, this is the place to head for Chase customers.  Problem is that the line moved slow and the parking was not so good.",UNK
9875,Eat here once a week. The food is great. The service is friendly. The drive thru is fast. All in all it is a A+,UNK
9876,It's the best Mediterranean food I have had in Madison do far but that really isn't saying all that much.  The food was good but nothing special.  Service was overbearing and annoying.  How many times do you need to ask me how the food is?  4 times was a bit much.,UNK
9877,"This is a very decent airport with a good variety of shopping and eating. In terms of drop-off and pick-up, this is definitely one of the easier airports to navigate.",UNK
9878,Been there 3 times.  Food is okay.  Big infestation of flies.  Can't eat outside.  Nobody washes the tables.  No wonder there are flies.\nCoffee shop is quaint.  I would suggest just walk around the place and get a cup of joe.,UNK

9883,"Really small, really busy. Not the cleanest, hard to find stuff I felt , staff was ok I felt like maybe they were understaffed .",UNK
9884,"Tastes like home made! Better in some cases.. \nThe tortillas tasted absolutely amazing, the carne asada was great. You gotta try the breakfast burritos. Customer service was great, our orders were ready pretty quick and it was inexpensive. I will definitely go back on my next trip to Vegas.",UNK
9885,"After the comment I received after my review, I checked my inbox and indeed had a message regarding my visit. They asked for additional information about the visit and further contact info which I provided. I never heard any further feedback.",UNK
9886,Two stars for the food. Good portions good bar food. Service at the bar?? Bad bad bad. Was very slow. Girls paid more attention to bitching about customers amongs themselves than actually trying to earn a tip.,UNK
9887,"Jason's Deli is pretty good, but not great.  The sandwiches are definitely above average, but they don't seem as big as everyone else says they are.  I personally like the turkey panini.  Bonus points for delivery service, and online ordering.",UNK
9888,"Take it from a local, don't walk by this place without getting a loose burger. Or 5 of them. Or one one of the best gyros ever.",UNK
9889,I love IKEA. The best time to come is during the week. You can browse around and find a little of everything for every room in the house without breaking your budget.,UNK
9890,Very Beautiful restaurant - that's about it.\nI didn't expect fine dining but this was tasted like overpriced tv dinners.  It used to be ok now it just falls way short of acceptable.,UNK
9891,"Truly exceptional .......plate by plate, Chef Chris is sure to delight your palette with his fantastic flavors and fresh ingredients. Go there, just not on the days I want to go back...I don't need you getting in my way! :)",UNK

9893,This place was nasty... I wouldn't eat here ever again... It cost 60$ for 2 people and the food isn't worth 5dollars ... I would have rather ate at McDonald's ...,UNK
9894,"This place is amazing.  We reserved a private room for our wedding rehearsal dinner and brought in our own tv to watch a football game during.  The food was fantastic, the wait staff was friendly and on point, and I would recommend this place to any and everyone!",UNK
9895,Visited this location on 8-22. It was a great way to end a drunken night. And at this location the food was extra hot,UNK
9896,It's a typical gym.  Nothing spectacular. Treadmills and stair climber seem to be out of order often. Kids Club is convenient for us mommies that need to workout without trying to find a babysitter for an hour.  I do enjoy the classes though.  The instructors are friendly and full of energy.,UNK
9897,Terrible!   Super expensive for a rundown hotel.  Poor service with staff making terrible decisions.   Water park is so crowded we went to another pool.  Not enough chairs anywhere to accommodate guests.   Everybody I talked to shared my feelings on this resort.  We are checking out early and heading to another resort....buyer beware!   Find another resort!,UNK
9898,Like the other reviews this place is a joke. I would not waste my hard earned money here. This place has some of the worst customer service I have ever experienced. Of course all the employees act like they're better than you because they work for a video game store.,UNK
9899,"I work in a nearby office building so I have been eating here for the past 3 years at least once a week. The staff is always friendly and my order is always ready for me. My faves are the bacon breakfast burrito,the turkey cranberry and the chicken ceasar salad. I highly recommend Ladybug Cafe to anybody.",UNK

9902,"Nice hotel, nothing fancy, but away from the glitzy tackiness of the Strip. My room was quite large, and clean. Overall, a pretty good experience.  The website offers pretty good rates.",UNK
9903,"Decoration is eclectic and interesting. The food was good, but nothing out of this world. The service was good too. Will give it another try.",UNK
9904,This is the first place I ate in Montreal and the best. My boyfriend and I shared the smoked meat poutine to start. He had the smoked meat sandwich afterwards and I had the turkey melt. The portions were huge and just great. Highly recommended.,UNK
9905,"These guys are great. I dropped my Android S3 and the glass shattered. Even though I pay sprint $12 a month for insurance, they wanted $150 to fix it. These guys did it for $79. I also used the Yelp deal to save $10. The phone looks like new.",UNK
9906,"It was okay, went for breakfast, meal was decent, service acceptable. Coffee was horrific, waitress changed the cups and resolved that. Just not that great.",UNK
9907,Employees here really take pride in their restaurant.  They made sure the dining area was clean and their napkins and ketchup station was stocked up and clean.  Well organized restaurant.  Great job!,UNK
9908,Dinner and music for 4.  This place was packed.  The food is always great and our new waitress did a great job!  The band rocked the house as usual (Mogollon) and the people watching was top notch.  \n\nWe come here several times a year and it is always worth the drive.,UNK
9909,I think Tee Pee is getting a bit of a bad rap.  I come here frequently for lunch and haven't had any problems with the service outside of waiting a bit too long for drink refills (understandable during a busy lunch rush).  It's utility Sonoran style Mexican food and it does the job.,UNK
9910,Hours during the week are shorter than shown on website and Yelp. Pizza was tasteless and cold. Crust was hard as a rock. Won't be back. Totally disappointed at the waste of money!  If this is what people think authentic Italian food and pizza is like they are sadly mistaken!,UNK
9911,"Came from LA to Vegas and we wanted Mexican food. Yelped it and came here. Great tortas,  burritos and taquitos. The beans didn't taste homemade.",UNK
9912,As good as it gets!  \n\nThe ice cream is great. My favorite was the sundae with salty caramel. They offer exotic flavors as well as traditional ones.,UNK
9913,"I like the Athena. Friendly service, and it was quite quiet the night we went. Food very good, I particularly enjoyed the kleftiko (lamb shanks). The stuffed vine leaves were also very tasty. Prices quite reasonable too.",UNK
9914,We ate here out of convenience. Once they sat us I noticed no less than 6 un-bused tables around us. Gross. My husband ordered a chocolate shake which took a while to show up and was runny and warm. Burgers were mediocre. Advice: make reservations. Elsewhere !,UNK
9915,Our waiter was from Detroit and way cool dude. Bottomless boneless wings were very good and able to take a bunch home. The bar area was loud and didn't like that.,UNK
9916,"Terrible. Didn't even have the food. But service is everything.\n\nWalked in, waited about 7 minutes. And no one was there to take an order.  I guess they don't take their business seriously.  Go to hue thai or even Lee's.  Forget about this place.",UNK
9917,"I would have loved to have seen this shop, but apparently it's closed for Labor Day. The website and Yelp both say it's open, but the sign on the door says it's closed.\n\nMaybe next time...",UNK
9918,Food was ok. Pallea had shell fish that wasn't properly cleaned...got a bit of sand and one of the giant shrimps still had most of its vein...yucky. The service and callamary was great. Red sangria was great also!,UNK
9919,"We bought a new home and the carpets weren't dirty but I felt like cleaning them either way. This is a great company they did everything they said they would, they were careful and I will be using them again. Great service and clean carpets!",UNK
9920,"Ich mag es einfach!!!\nChillen,\nSport schauen \nund das Karlsruher leben genie\u00dfen!!",UNK
9921,"This place gave me the shits, like pissin outta my ass kinda shits. I went there right after new years for a chicken club and the flatbread was stale and tomatoes were definitely not fresh like the hills of Mangolia. The smoothie was good though.",UNK
9922,"Good service, great tastes, but a little pricey for the portion size. Food came out super fast, which is a good thing, but if it comes out that fast the prices shouldn't be so high for such a small portion imo. I'll go again, because the flavors were amazing!!!!",UNK
9923,"Flew in here for bites on a yelp lead: did not disappoint! Vegas either has high end or low rent, there is no real decent culinary middle of the road in these parts high roller. However Mon Ami is not a gamble and delivers on minimum chips ;)",UNK
9924,"Food was good, service was bad. Had to wait over 10 minutes just for menus. Food took a long time and when we ask how much longer the waiter replied this is not Mc Donald's very rude. I won't be going back.",UNK
9925,"I've never had Thai food before so I suppose I have nothing to compare it to, but this restaurant didn't serve very tasty food. Maybe it was just what I ordered. I don't know. Plus it had a funny smell. It wasn't terrible but I'm not going back.",UNK
9926,"This is a completely fine place to eat/drink. The drinks are pretty good, and the food is ok. As far as chains go, it isn't bad. However, I live within walking distance from one of these and go maybe once a year, which I think speaks volumes.",UNK
9927,Worst airport for baggage claim. They move carousels all the time and take forever to deliver the bags. Should be so much easier than what they make it.,UNK
9928,If you aren't afraid of the atmosphere you'll probably like this. Not for anyone that has any diet restrictions. But man was it packed and cheap. I felt like we had found the Dallas Buyers Club of z Mexican Food.,UNK
9929,I was very disappointed with the quality of food and service.  I ordered a bacon cheese burger that arrived without bacon. My order came with fries bur I ordered chips and when they brought the chip they were cold and stale.\n\nThe fries were good but they were not what I ordered.,UNK
9930,"I think I'd like to try staying in different hotels in Las Vegas.  Seemed a bit run down and worn, too difficult to get into and out of due to construction.  Hash a go go restaurant was a huge plus, as was accessibility to the monorail!",UNK
9931,"Ok.... Been over a year since last visit.  Where shall we start...... Server was in a rush to take out order.   No bread was offered.   Ordered side of soup, no crackers were served.  Had to ask a manager for crackers.  Food was fairly decent.",UNK
9932,"Ordered wood fired rotisserie chicken. It was gold, tasteless and smeared with BBQ sauce - sent it back!",UNK
9933,I love this bar! Bartender was very friendly and attentive.  Plenty of room to lounge and a large clean pool. Best happy hour margarita I have ever had. Classy decor. I hope this place sticks around!,UNK
9934,"Not enough moving sidewalks. Not enough \""wow\"". This is Vegas! And who did Southwest Airlines piss off to get the gates a half-mile from the security entrance? The nicer hotels in town should chip in and spruce this place up.",UNK

9936,I like thin crust. I have only tried one pizza from this place. It was a thin crust Hawaiian. It was hands down the best pizza I have ever had. I have had Nello's and everybody else's pizza. I used to live in Chicago. Spinato's is the best and I am getting another today!,UNK
9937,"There clothing is a 5. However, at this location the service was horrible. I couldn't find someone to help me get something down, no one asked if we needed anything, the two girls were behind the counter and too busy talking to themselves and ignoring the customers. Usually this chain has great service. I was very disappointed in this location.",UNK

9940,"Stopped on our way to Chandler Arizona. Really good food and nice atmosphere. A little off the highway, perfect if your looking for that local feel.",UNK
9941,The food was so-so and the service was VERY slow. Need to figure it out if they are going to last here! Taco Tuesday ends at 4pm (kind of a bummer) but the 99 cent margaritas were fairly decent!,UNK
9942,"The food is run of the mill Mexican food - decent and filling. However, the service is slow. The waitresses are friendly, but a weekday lunch with few customers should not take an hour.",UNK
9943,Just ok...had the salad which was very fresh and tasty. The pizza was just so-so as the crust needed to be much thinner to be considered a NY style. Prices are good. If they could just thin out the crust it would be rated higher.,UNK
9944,Good food. The place is great for families with young kids. They have cherrios and diapers available for free. Very friendly staff. This location is my favorite chick fil a.,UNK
9945,"Save your money and spend it on a reputable food truck like slidin thru. \n\nFor the money that you spend here, the quality of the food is terrible. \n\nPlus the owner like to single out groups of people.",UNK
9946,The worst place I have ever been. The service was horrible and the food was even worse. If u are someone who values customer service this isnt the place for you.,UNK

9950,Great Happy Hour . Great Desserts. I don't care much for the main courses.  Wait time can be a bitch on weekends. Staff is courteous and friendly . One of the better casual dining establishments in the East Valley. Did I mention the awesome desserts ?,UNK
9951,"This is place is awesome. The price is reasonable considering the portion size of the meal. I'm 5'10\"" 210 lbs. and I'm getting full half way through my plate. Love the atmosphere,  down to earth. ... The food is great. ..",UNK
9952,"Cool, convenient location w/ friendly & helpful sales associates who know what they're talking about. This location always has something for me.",UNK
9953,"It was okay. Didn't make the impression on me that I expected. Considering it's in Luxor I expected it to be a bit nicer I guess. We were there for \""Cougar Night\"" and it was not an exciting event by any means.",UNK
9954,"The food was just okay even though I really liked the jerk wings. Maybe I wasn't in the right mood for it, but the music was too loud and there were too many TVs and hyper-stimulation. I was a little overwhelmed and underwhelmed at the exact same time.",UNK
9955,"Raised prices and coupons don,t include any 12 inch sandwich specials. Used to buy here weekly but no longer can afford it especially with the fact that they give less meat and cheese then Port of Subs.",UNK
9956,"So uh yeah they sell sporting goods here. They have a great selection and the store is really nice (it's 2 stories) and the sales men don't bother you to much. I like the store but the prices are about average, which really doesn't make it special in my book.",UNK
9957,"Customer service is horrible! Not one \""Thank you\"" on my visit (My receipt says Josh). Improve your customer service, and you might make up for the wait time. Food is okay...",UNK
9958,"Don't come here if you want to see the strip. The promised shuttle service is unreliable and the hotel doesn't care to take responsibility, blaming a subcontractor and admitting sometimes they don't show up. If you want to spend all your time in the casino, maybe it's a better choice. Rooms are clean.",UNK
9959,This open air bar sits in a central location inside the Miracle Mile shops. It's a great place to hang out when you when you want to take a break from shopping. They have plenty of big screen TV's with ESPN sports.,UNK
9960,"I love Invision Auto Body for a number of reasons, Brian Hosford being one of them. He is a honest hard working representative of theirs. They get you the quote for your auto work right away and are reliable. They are well respected and do quality work at a great price.",UNK
9961,"Sushi is ok, service was alright.  \n\nThe staff at Geisha's a Go Go (which is literally across the street) is MUCH MUCH more friendly.",UNK
9962,"I wanted to try something new and decided to give this place a go. The pizza was delicious, I had a deep dish meat combo. The dining area was a good size and the staff was really nice. This is a great neighborhood pizza spot. I will be going here in the future!",UNK
9963,This place was very disappointing! The food is mediocre at best and the service was terrible. We waited 40 mins for an appetizer and then another 40 for the food.,UNK
9964,Was in town for my friend's 40th birthday and stayed at Bally's. Dirty room. Found toe nail clippings throughout the room including a massive big toe toenail clipping.,UNK
9965,"It's a Robertos, what do you want?\nWhen you're craving the cheap Mex on the go it's good.\nTonight is carne asada nachos.",UNK
9966,dude where was my pickle??????????.......food was awesome....thx you just forgot my pickle....suzy,UNK
9967,I posted a negative review earlier. I would like everyone to know that Marcel Painting sent a foreman to my house to correct the problems. I appreciate the extra  effort to make me a happy customer.\n\nAndy,UNK
9968,"Clean with lots of good furniture/decoration ideas. They change things up often so coming every couple months or so is typically a new experience! Some of the product are more poorly crafted than others, but essentially get the job done.",UNK
9969,"This is my new favorite place for Mexican food. Great food. Great price. Always friendly. We love eating Rudy's as takeaway since the seating is limited and we can call it in. Street tacos are good, Chimi's are great, and I love both types of hot sauce.",UNK
9970,Meh... short review for posterity sake... bland burgers make me sad.wont be going back... unless its my birthday... then its free right?,UNK
9971,"The food was good. Not what you'd normally find in a traditional Mexican restaurant.  The guacamole was excellent. Great selection of tequila. Chips were fresh, green sauce was great.",UNK
9972,"Terrible service at the Service on 83 and Union Hills , the ticket writer was inconsiderate and rude .  I would never get my car detailed because of his lack of customer service. Mycheal",UNK
9973,"OMG, I now leave for the airport four hours before every flight, just so I can hang out in this lounge. Spacious, comfortable seating, delicious buffet meals, high-speed wifi, and everything is so clean. I almost LIKE traveling again.",UNK
9974,just had a great cottage pie pasty and brought home banoffee pie which I fear will have to wait until tomorrow. neat little spot unexpectedly tucked away in a pretty pedestrian shopping center. Definitely give it a try!,UNK
9975,This place is located in China town in a very popular part of town. I love their milk tea boba and mango slush. The workers are kind of weird and don't really have manners. I still go here often despite the service. It's a good place to hang out.,UNK
9976,"I give it three stars because their coffee was very indifferent to me and I think I should try their coffee twice before judging it. I will say the hours are bad for a coffee house, because they're only open until 7. I will definitely say there are better coffee places to go to then this.",UNK
9977,Go for a lowerkey Las Vegas club experience (i.e. the staying up till 7am at a bar?!?). But they put plastic tops on the mixed drinks???? Cause of skeezee roofie guys? WTF?,UNK
9978,This place was the highlight of my Phoenix trip.  Walking in was like discovering a parallel universe.\n\nI can't imagine that the new place could match the feel of the old......,UNK
9979,It was pretty crowded. It reminded me though of being in college but the food was better. I got sick of waiting in a line though after awhile and the hole thing was kind of barbaric.,UNK
9980,"This was my 3rd or 4th visit to Del Frisco's. I have always had a great meal. \nThe steak was perfectly prepared, the oysters were delish and the sides were great!\nIt's always a treat!",UNK
9981,"Not a bad place for ramen.  Broth was nice.  Meat was okay.  Service was decent.  But after having ramen at Santouka in the Mitsuwa Japanese stores, it just doesn't compare.\n\nIt's good ramen though.  I just can't say I'm a huge fan of it.",UNK
9982,"Donuts and coffee on the go. This location is convenient since it has a drive through. I still don't love Dunkin Donuts, but in the area this place is hard to pass up based on convenience alone.",UNK
9983,Ehhhhhhhhh... They need better buns... and actually they need better hotdogs. I can get a better dog @ Costco. Probably won't be going back anytime soon.. sorry guys.,UNK
9984,"Not many places motivate me in such a way that I feel compelled to walk out but say for 40-minutes, at least 25 of which were unattended.  The 25-minutes were order-to-walk out.",UNK
9985,"I took a sampler plate which was good but it was pricy, almost about CAD23, personally I didn't like the salad, there was a kind of sea vegetable and not my type at all. Place is quite and good service.",UNK
9986,Great place for Sunday brunch with the family - they have all of my favorites - pancakes are hot and the omelette a are fresh,UNK
9987,Sing Hi Chicken maybe one of the best in town. Does not matter what else you order but this is a must.\nPlace and location is not the best but go for the food. \nService is generally pretty good and prices are very reasonable,UNK
9988,"I've try calling them, to order for pick up and the phone kept ringing and ringing, so I decided to walk there, and found out that the phone was off the hook on purpose so the phone won't ring, I've waited for 30 minutes for a salad, worse service ever!!",UNK
9989,"GREAT Chinese food \uff0cspicy\uff0ci like spicy food , spicy crisp chicken ,spicy string bean,\\eggplant with spicy gralic sauce,thin wrap pork in sauce , sichuan style cucumber,its awesome\uff0c",UNK
9990,"It's Chili's which means it tips out at three stars, but in this ones case it is small with slow service. Better to wait in line at Burgatory...",UNK
9991,Worst Chicken Parm ever (including frozen meals) but very good pizza.  I give it 2 stars. If you are an Italian place it is not acceptable to have terrible Chicken Parm...Sorry,UNK
9992,Best food cart in the city.  I am so lucky that it is parked right outside my building downtown.  Sweet Thai Chili Wrap sandwich is AMAZING!  The soups are absolutely delicious.,UNK
9993,"Horrible. Sub par job. Paid for a pedi and got lotion rubbed on my legs and bad paint job on my toes. The nail polish didn't even last a week, and the customer service was not great. The price was ridiculous for what they did.",UNK
9994,Great food! Great buffet! There is a vegetarian section in the buffet! All buffets should be this good. And the garlic naan was amazing and hot.,UNK
9995,"Wish I could leave a zero star review, my buddy and I were kicked out for non payment of a lap dance which was not requested. We were relegated to an outside curb, then ushered into a limo.  Overall it was a really terrible experience. Head elsewhere for you vegas strip club experience.",UNK
9996,"The food was delicious! Our waitress was great and the decor is minimalist but original. I wish that we lived closer to this place.  Please put one in Louisville, Kentucky.",UNK
9997,Been here twice so far in 2014!  Excellent food and great service.  Even my picky teenager loves this place and the menu has options for the whole family at reasonable prices.  We ordered Happy Hour sized servings of an appetizer last time and three of us didn't even finish!  And it's perfect for an afternoon lunch on weekends.,UNK
9998,"Well I didn't have much choice. I don't eat pork,  and their most of the dishes have pork.  I would suggest they keep more seafood items so that people who don't eat pork can enjoy! :)",UNK
9999,"The food overall is average, nothing special, but the Sunday Brunch is small, good quality, and reasonably priced. We go there during the winter when it is nice time to sit outside on the patio.",UNK
10000,"Great choice for Thanksgiving dinner! Food was great, including mini pumpkin pie and our server Mike was awsome! Even had leftovers to take home.  Can't wait to come back!",UNK
10001,It just wasn't that great to me.  It's fine for BBQ and the baked beans were different (in a good way) but it just wasn't up to the hype I had  heard about from so many different people.,UNK
10002,This store sucks !! Don't tell me what form of payment to use what if I don't want to use cash what if I would rather accumulate points . Don't use sharpies for your brows either I can't take you seriously .,UNK
10003,Always a great spot to get your burger fix! If you can eat like a Champion try the Bacon Burger on Steroids or the Bad Ass Burger!,UNK
10004,"Food was amazing just the right ammount of spice i had the green curry, for those who think they like spice id go with medium so you can taste the food the girl friend got number 58 dont knowhow to spell it but it was amazing def coming back again great firt time experience.",UNK
10005,"Frequent diners with little complaints however our last visit was the worst.  Our sever was more focused on pleasing a group of \""family/relatives\"" to the owner then she was on her other tables.  We had to remind her several times to bring us a drink & that we were ready to order.",UNK
10006,"I enjoyed the small tour they have, and my daughter thouroughly enjoyed making a chocolate pizza. I am very impressed at the quality of candy. The french mint chocolates were my family's Favorite.",UNK
10007,"Check your order, they will mess it up or forget stuff. Friendly staff inside not in drive thru. Food is hot and fresh. Drive thur does move fast it seems.",UNK
10008,This location is okay but most of the time when I come here the food sometimes is fresh and sometimes so it's hit and miss all though with that negative the customer service here is good the times ive come here and they do there best to get your food to you as fast as possible.,UNK
10009,Average food. Was okay but have had much better Hawaiian food. This one is at least better than Aloha Kitchen. If I am ever in the area I would stop in and eat but I wouldn'tgo out of my way to come here.,UNK
10010,I stopped by here to check it out because I loved Postinos.  The wait staff is unfriendly and rude. They can't make a good martini to save their life.  There are much better places to go in that area that are a ton better.   If you are thinking of going here move on.,UNK
10011,Not bad. I was there just 1 night and I think is a nice hotel. Of course old fashion but is not so bad and have low price. Inside there several restaurants and the Irish Restaurant Galagher is really special.,UNK
10012,Sister in law loves this place.  Had a bad experience the first time so we tried it again.  This time the Chicken was very tough and stringy and tasted bitter.  Felt nausea after eating just a piece it and sent it back.,UNK
10013,This restaurant is closed down.   Even though the in room hotel guide at the Hilton still lists it.  (Of course it also lists Quarks which was part of The Star Trek Experience that closed years ago),UNK
10014,Needed to send a fax quickly. The two employees that were working were both very bored looking. Did not greet me when I entered the mostly empty store. The female asian employee was rude when I asked her about faxing.  I felt very unwelcome and I will not be returning.,UNK
10015,"Horrible in every way. Not only will I never come to this location, but it was so bad I will never go to any of their locations.",UNK
10016,Stood in line 20 minutes as the cashier tried to sell the customer in front of me a protection plan she didn't want! Screw the upsell deal with your waiting customers 1st,UNK
10017,The New York cut is amazing. Cooked perfectly. The server was very attentive with whom provided great service. \nA revisit for sure.,UNK
10018,"Wow, I just gotta say, WHO THE HELL COMES HERE FOR THE FOOD? Really now! You come here, you get the frozen hot chocolate (which is its specialty) and you enjoy it. THE END\n\nYou like chocolate? You'll like this",UNK
10019,I wasn't impressed at all. There is was way too much frosting. They look pretty but that's about  it. They aren't memorable...bottom line make your own.,UNK
10020,"Stopping in for happy hour drinks and apps.  Great patio, service as so-so.  Would return for happy hour, but menu was not appealing enough to come back for dinner.",UNK
10021,"I was treated to a lovely dinner here and found the restaurant to be A-OK.\n\nThe service was good and the food was delicious.\n\nThe prices are reasonable too...after drinks, dinner and dessert, we weren't left feeling like we paid too much.",UNK
10022,"I have only been to the Sunset club for networking events.  It's a fairly decent place for that.  There food is decent and prices aren't pretty fair.  They have nice seating for cassually socializing. However, it is extremely dark.",UNK
10023,This QT is just a short distance from the 51 Freeway and is a great spot to grab some gas if needed and all your snacks and drink needs.  Very busy location so be careful driving in and out.,UNK
10024,We eat here every trip to Vegas!  Never ever had a bad meal here!  Drinks are really good too!  Excellent staff...and they will help you navigate the menu!\n\nSo many good dishes we can never decide!\n\nLove Sushisamba!!,UNK
10025,"Pricey, but nice. Its got hipster-y food (read: kale and quinoa) and a fairly nice ambiance. The employees here always seem irritated, but maybe that's just because I go at peak times.",UNK
10026,"It's fine. The dining area is too dark and the lunch buffet is mediocre. I have a feeling dinner is a better bet than lunch, but haven't had the desire to bother given the mediocre service and lack of options at lunch.",UNK
10027,Lobster roll is yumz but overpriced!!\nI redeemed with 7 second beer challenge 2X!!\nCasual laid back atmosphere is a nice break!!,UNK
10028,I have been going here for about a year now and every time I go I'm never disappointed with the service that I get! Jessica is an amazing stylist. Her haircuts are very clean and she pays very close attention to details. I have recommended two of my close friends to her and both loved what she did for them!,UNK
10029,Franchement rapport qualit\u00e9/prix/emplacement top ! Et la pool party est top\nDemander une chambre en \u00e9tage \u00e9lev\u00e9 avec vue sur la piscine,UNK
10030,The food was like a 7-11 food and the price was $$$\nWould not RECOMMEND\nIf your a visitor you'd be better off taking a cab and go else where~,UNK
10031,Food was good. Cookie was great. Service was awful. Young workers who stand around and wait. Thank goodness for the one person who decided to work today.,UNK
10032,"The breakfast (ham & cheese omelet) was the best, but the service was not the best. The toast was cold, my wifes blueberry pancake wad terrible.",UNK
10033,"I love the chips and salsa here. The servers here are always prompt and they have great food, big portions for leftovers, and very reasonably priced. We have been here multiple times and will keep giving them our business.",UNK
10034,Very friendly and such great pastries.  We really enjoyed the lunch soup and have had nice breakfasts.  You might think of sharing as some of the sandwiches are large.  I like their choice of coffee.,UNK
10035,"Not a fan, not terrible, but not great either. Service here is mixed and food is average. Good for novelty, but little else.",UNK
10036,I love that the booths are high for extra privacy. The lady serving us was sweet. I got the chicken teriyaki bento box with the Lisa Lisa rolls. My hubby got the all you can eat which he enjoyed. I liked it all though I feel like I've had better sushi elsewhere.,UNK
10037,This review is really for the service and Cuban Pork Sandwich.  It was SUBLIME and makes my list of best sandwiches EVER. I'd go back in an instant.,UNK
10038,"The food is great. The wait is insane. I ordered online, they said it would be 20 minutes, it was 50 minutes. For three meals. Are they catching the fish?! Then they tell me that I'm having to wait because they had to fill a catering order. Well don't I feel special.",UNK
10039,"Stayed there when I got married last weekend.Really nice staff thaat was willing to help with everything. Upgraded from a manor room to a skyrise room. Very affordable, room was very clean.  Buffet was almost half the price of the one at Mandalay Bay and I enjoyed it more.  Will definitely stay there again.",UNK
10040,"This place is just the type of bar we have been looking for. Bar tender was great, I think her name was Lindsay. The drinks were cheap enough but good. They have specials on during games. This bar has definitely made a couple of more patrons.",UNK
10041,"Good food and wonderful staff! I was there for the Restaurant Week promotion, and while I'm certain portion sizes were smaller to accommodate the price, the food was still great.",UNK
10042,"Great coffee, nice ambiance, ecclectic crowd, I went in planning to people watch state street while enjoying a caffeine boost and spent most of my time eavesdropping on the bizarre conversations going on around me...very entertaining.",UNK
10043,The woman behind the counter told me she could not give me a glass of water due to the health department concerns over their sanitation. Disturbing for a place that sells food.,UNK
10044,"Came here for dinner tonight. The weather was so nice, we sat out on the patio. We ordered the Gorgonzola Mushrooms for appetizers and shared the Sea Bass that was one of their specials. They were both Wonderful!! The staff was really nice also! Highly recommend it!!",UNK
10045,"Very disorganized. It took 25, minutes before we were helped. Once the order was in it took over 40 minutes to get our sushi order. We never received our short ribs or edamane. Sushi was fair. Salad was very good. But will never go back because of the wait and the confusion of the service staff.",UNK
10046,"I am a little surprised this place has so many stars. I thought the food was pretty average. It was a good value for takeout but nothing special. I like the fact that they have such a large delivery area. Overall, I think Chopstick Express is better for the same style of food.",UNK
10047,This was my first time at The Nail Room. I had a fantastic experience. The staff was very friendly and helpful. My technicians were very skilled and detail oriented. Overall great environment. Had a wonderful afternoon and would deff go back and recommend it.,UNK
10048,We had a nice meal here. Our waiter was great.He was very attentive and visited us often. I don't understand why others have written about poor service.,UNK
10049,"The coffee is terrible, I was really hoping this place would be a little gem. Not the case. I love supporting local coffee shops, but my latte was poorly made and tasted like warm milk more than espresso. My girlfriend ordered a cold brew coffee, her experience was the same.",UNK
10050,"Allen Hall was the only thing I enjoyed about my Tenure at U of I.  The students were awesome to be around, artsy without being obscure, funny, and all-around good people.  Low Greek density, and right next to one of the only all-girls dorms?  Yeah.  I'm into it.",UNK
10051,Service has gone down.. We've been coming here every year for past 10 years for a weekend trip to watch football .. Service and food have gone down.. Very disappointed.,UNK
10052,"\""Am I a little drunk? Maybe, but I still give it a five,\"" my husband.\n\nBright, clean, open atmosphere. Small tables for small groups and one large table for, I presume, communal dining. Very casual and delicious food. It feels healthy in here :-)",UNK
10053,"Good because its serves food 24/7, but food is just meh.  Fries were 4 bucks and tasteless.  Entertainment is kinda cool, but the singing is loud and can get annoying. Ok, if there's nothing else open.",UNK
10054,"These are the most amazing sandwiches I've ever had. The sandwiches are pretty tall and stuffed with coleslaw and fries instead of having the coleslaw and fries on the side. Also, prices are reasonable and food preparation is fast. One downside, if you're physically challenged, is the restrooms are located downstairs.",UNK
10055,I had the pleasure to meet with Drew who works at this organization. \n\nHe was very knowledgable and an absolute pleasure to deal with. I am looking forward to having my whole family use this business and I am looking forward to recommending them to my friends.,UNK
10056,I can concur with Adam Z. Putrid diarrhea post consumption. Food is meh. Won't be ordering again,UNK
10057,I had the ribye sandwich and it tasted really good. the problem with it was open face! the mushrooms were very salty. I did a pick up order at 1-2 am and i must say for a call in order in the AM service was perfect and promte. The food specials are amazing !,UNK
10058,Once again I had a wonderful time. They w very busy it the service was still great! We had the salmon salad was so yummy!the sushie tasted perfect,UNK
10059,I was underwhelmed with the food here.  I've definitely had better food.  \n\nThe parking lot can get VERY full on weekdays for lunch.,UNK
10060,Brian and his team are extremely friendly. They attend to your concerns and solve them. I love renting cars from this location. Any day!,UNK
10061,This place sucks there's 3 different prices? Car wash 10 cents cheaper cat wash with a bag of ice 20 cents cheaper.  So tiny of a car wash in the back.,UNK
10062,"The wait was too long. I think any local such as I, will agree that bachi burger is way better and way cheaper as far as fancy burgers go that is. Food isnt bad but just not worth the money and the experience.",UNK
10063,Sushi is pretty decent and not horribly overpriced. We have only done take out and both times we have allowed more than the quoted time for it to be ready but still had to wait at least 20 minutes for our food to be ready when there was no one in the restaurant.,UNK
10064,Great Furniture and a GREAT price. Even made a special delivery to accommodate my schedule last minute! Defiantly a customer for life.,UNK
10065,"I vaguely remember walking through here before getting to Moon. It had a very upscale feel to it, with a great view of the city without having to be outdoors, and the Bunnies seemed nice enough. I have a memory of taking pictures with some really funny and amiable big black bouncers guarding the VIP area...",UNK
10066,"5 Star Barbershop, and a total throwback place that does good work...mainly they made sure I dont look like a dumbass. straight razor, hot towel, and can give you the exact style you want.   Its hard to make my dumb head look good, but they manage to pull it off...Nice!",UNK
10067,Food sucked way not worth the price and the service was horrible. Waited an hour for our food!!! Not going back to that bdubs!,UNK
10068,Outstanding .....\nFrom San Diego and needed a burger fix and boy did I get it...\nHad the beach house recommended by the guy at the counter and he was right on.\nI will be back next time I'm in Phoenix,UNK
10069,"\""Children and pet friendly while outlet shop\""\n\nDecent outlet. Selection not as good as Cabazon, but not bad either. Surprisingly very Dog friendly with plastic baggies and dog fountain. Very children friendly with water fountain and train rides.",UNK
10070,"Terrible service, waitress messed up two orders and couldn't even come out and apologize. Food is decent but the kitchen and staff need to step up their game and not act like timid children when they get things wrong.",UNK
10071,The orange chicken and house rice were perfect together.  We added in a pork dish and it was a great combo.  They seated us quickly and had our drinks out right away.  The server checked on us consistently but wasn't annoying!,UNK
10072,Homemade Paletas! Delicioso! New & old flavors! Great place. I had strawberry with big ole strawberries & my daughter had the cereal one & it was pretty tasty! They also have ice cream & shakes with a Mexican twist! Very interesting flavors they have! I'll be back,UNK
10073,I've been here a few times and there Are A few good dishes.  Great creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e but that's it.  Service subpar and I've had to send back soured wine.  It's just super trendy which I find obnoxious.,UNK
10074,"Took my kids for ice cream midday Saturday and they were already out of my son's favorite kind - the Spider-Man. Should have at least stock up for the weekend. Service was ok, but both salespeople wore super DIRTY shirts. Just disgusting. Not my favorite place to go.",UNK
10075,"I was quite impressed very charming and kinda romantic to have a nice lunch , The service was friendly and attentive the lunch specials were good too ! The only disapointing thing is there is no soda fountain but other than that it's all good the pasties were very tasty and I look forward to going back soon.",UNK
10076,"Good chinese vegetarian. Lots of vegan options. Vegan ice cream and brown rice. Chinese Malaysian owned, so some Southeast Asian goodies. Go to place for chinese veggie in lv.",UNK
10077,The servers were really nice but the food takes awhile. I waited an hour for my poki salad which I ended up canceling after they followed up on it the third time.,UNK
10078,"This would be my restaurant of choice when I want pho in Vegas.  Having gone to Vegas quite a number of times, I've been able to try different pho restaurants and I will probably keep going back to this place for my fix, which would be after a long night of drinking.  It's nice inside and the pho tastes good!",UNK
10079,"Very big outdoor mall! Has good stores like my favourites: j crew, gap, banana republic, etc. there's a store for everyone. There's also le sportsac outlet, which I have never seen elsewhere!",UNK
10080,Really great pizza and awesome business model. I think they need to get themselves a bit more oriented to conducting business as the service isn't all that great and a little confusing at times.,UNK
10081,"If you want great tasty boba, head next door to Super L Ranch Market.  If you want fresh daily baked breads, again, head next door to Super L.  All products are made fresh daily, no shipment come in weekdays.  All are freshly made for your enjoyment.",UNK
10082,"Technician was prompt, very knowledgeable, and had the re-keying of my house done in short order. Price was very reasonable. Would definitely use their services again.",UNK
10083,Rooms aren't bad but the rooms bathroom is disgusting. AC didn't work and the maid stole something from my room. \nGood music at the pool but overall place was whack.,UNK
10084,Yogurtology has a great selection of flavors and toppings. The store is always very clean and much nicer than a lot of other similar shops in the area. We are always happy to go there.,UNK
10085,"Astronomically priced, poor quality food. Terrible selection. It was completely empty when I went in, it's no wonder. Never again!",UNK
10086,ALWAYS very consistent. Food is ALWAYS good.. but lately I have noticed that with the new management and chef.. the service has been a little slow. I highly recommend the Macadamia Nut Chicken! So yummy!,UNK
10087,"This Gap location is pretty large and has a good selection of women's clothes. I'm a big fan of most things Gap sells, though some of it seems priced too high. This store usually has a good-sized section of sale racks, which is way better than the pathetic clearance area at other locations.",UNK
10088,"I live this place. Great drinks. Awsome entertainment!!!! Not for the faint of heart. Profanity a plenty. But oh so Damn funny. The singers will commemorate engagements, wedding anniversaries, birthdays, and promotions (for a tip.) \nSuch great interactive fun.",UNK
10089,Boo... Learning the hard way that there is nothing easy about ending our Hyundai lease. Glad to know the aren't interested in getting us into a new Hyundai and more worried about what a hassle we are. Plus side- guess we won't have to worry about this in the future.,UNK
10090,My wife love to do her grocery shopping on this Store. The lights outside the store is bright which is very helpful to us especially we do our shopping late nights. Security keeps patrolling the area. We feel safe every time we shop. Thanks Walmart.,UNK
10091,"They really are freaky fast! I always go here and I didn't even know you could get your sandwich on wheat bread, but it changed my life. If I'm feeling healthy I'll sometimes get it without the bread just on lettuce which is equally as good and filling!",UNK
10092,Worst hotel. Just checking in was a horrific experience. Over half an hour to tell us they don't have a room ready even though we paid for it,UNK
10093,Thought I would give them a 2nd chance... Bad idea! Employees make you feel like your putting them out for ordering overpriced pizza. this place will be out of business If  the owners don't  make a change quickly.,UNK
10094,"Great selection, friendly and knowledgeable staff and they had exactly what I needed for my upcoming plane ride (I get nauseous).  Great prices too!",UNK
10095,I had chicken shawarma I got sick to my stomach when I came back to work ( it was a lunch break with a folk). I'm not sure if it's their food? Or maybe this happens when you try a different cuisine for the first time. But I'm coming back I just dont like the atmosphere inside.,UNK
10096,Anticlimatic.  $10 for a glass of cheap cab? \nI won't be rushing back. That is for sure.,UNK
10097,"I loveee this place. One of the best boba in town. \n\nTheir drinks are so rich in flavor, boba is tasty and chewy, little ice, and cheap.\n\nA must place to go for boba drinks :)",UNK
10098,"Excellent food, service and atmophere.  Everything I would expect from another Wolfgang Puck installation.  I had the club sandwich with a salad and a beer.  Everything I ordered has its own subtlety and was not like every other place that serves something comparable.  The prices were reasonable for the quality of the meal.  I would definitely go back some time.",UNK
10099,"Pour un brunch entres amis, tr\u00e8s bon accueil, service extra.\nLes plats y sont copieux et vraiment excellents. Choix vari\u00e9s, pour toutes les bourses.",UNK
10100,"Save your money, take a cab up the street to Firefly. Especially if it's after 10pm. Their menu only has your typical bar food items, at Hard Rock prices. If you're desperate to stay at HR go get the Gambler's Special at Mr. Lucky's.",UNK
10101,Go here if someone else is paying.  Don't eat too much guac if you don't want to diarrhea.  The margaritas don't have alcohol in them or the sangria.  No real vegan options except for more guac and beer.  Go to Pancho's,UNK
10102,Waffle House\n\nPretty standard where ever you eat at one.  Service at this one is also descent.\n\nWaffle House seems to keep raising their prices every 3-6 months.  They are becoming a little expensive for breakfast compare to their competition like IHOP and Denny's.,UNK
10103,Amazing pasta that's full of flavor and texture to the tee!! The pizza ain't too bad here either with a staff that's always courteous and friendly... Well laid out restaraunt overall with a decent sized patio,UNK
10104,This is one of the worst McDonald's locations I have ever been to. It's always bad and doesn't matter what time or day they consistently disappoint.,UNK
10105,Le nouveau bar ''in'' d'HoMa ! /// The newest bar in Hochelaga-Maisonneuve ! On y sert de la bouffe du terroir + bi\u00e8res / cocktails !,UNK
10106,"We had a bday party there last night 18 of us.the platter of food we got was really good, the buffalo chicken egg rolls were not spicy or seasoned at all. The pork belly app is awesome.  The only complaint we had was the wine pours were very small, other than that we will be a regular there.",UNK
10107,"Sandwiches are always great, prices are worth it and delivery is crazy fast (I've never been in the store - Delivery only). That's that.",UNK
10108,Very interesting and authentic NM food.  Lots of different places to be seated.  The Habanero burger was great and as hot and spicy as promised!  I also tried the burrito - it was good but the green chile seemed more like Bueno's (hence the 4 stars).  Will definitely be there again!,UNK
10109,Saw disturbed here and the acoustics were horrid. It was loud as hell and the instruments sounded ok but the singers voice just sounded like he had a cloth stuffed in his mouth. Really surprised at how bad that concert sounded.,UNK
10110,"Not sure why there are so many positive reviews.  Food was very so-so, lamb and beef were both chewy and had little flavor.  Saw a lot of signs for steaks nearby for $9, and wish I had gone to one of those places instead.",UNK
10111,These guys were super!! We dropped off the car and didn't have a ride back to our hotel-so they offered to give us a ride. Yes the diagnostics was $94.00 but that's standard at a BMW mechanic. They were very nice and I would highly recommend.,UNK
10112,Place was average. Ordered a $15 shrimp app that was basically grilled shrimp but it wasn't very good at all. Very tough with a bit of fishy taste. The location was great because it allowed for great people watching in the casino on a Friday night. I would try another Japanese restaurant in the area before coming back here.,UNK
10113,The past three times I have been here I have gotten sick!  Talked to another person the other day that had also been sick the next day after eating here.  Won't be going back.  Not worth getting sick over!,UNK
10114,"Impeccable is how I'd describe the property, staff, and service. An absolute delight, would definitely stay there again!",UNK
10115,I've been coming to rice paper for about a year now. They have -- Great staff ! Great food ! The best happy hour with $2.75 drafts everyday. I will most definitely be a long time costumer,UNK
10116,"Don't write many reviews but had to for this place. Amazing first impression !!!. It is authentic, friendly, tasty, and satisfying.  So glad it's in downtown.  I hope to become a regular at this restaurant.",UNK
10117,"Love this place!  Great, homemade brats!  Everything they serve(except for the bread) is made in house which is cool.  They have a great beer selection.  Nice open, patio area out back!",UNK
10118,"Only had 1 bad drink in vegas, and it was a mango margarita from the walk up bar.  Bar tender was nice and place has great atmosphere but margarita was so sugary couldn't drink it.  Burned my throat and my friend threw his away too.  Not what I expected from margaritaville.",UNK
10119,"Dr. Parsanko and Rhonda are the most friendly, caring ever.  They are updating the office too.  Highly recommend them!!!!",UNK
10120,"This is great German food - without all of the noise and hoopla of the Hofbrauhaus.  My husband is from Germany,and this is where we go when he wants a taste of home.\n\nThe staff is friendly and helpful, the portions are huge - so go there when you're hungry!",UNK
10121,Too slow !!!!!!!!\nForgetful !\nFood is so so.\nDon't go there wast your time and money.,UNK
10122,Had my gf office party here. It was meh. Probably won't go here again but I can see the appeal to some folks,UNK
10123,"Grade: Pure Evil\n\nLousy service. Putrid food. I truly hate this place. This is a hippie's idea of fine cuisine. The hairy-legged waitress, with 4 nose rings and doused in patchouli oil was the cherry on this turd sundae.",UNK
10124,I'm sitting in here right now trying to work and they are blasting Glenn Beck super loud. Ay yi yi. Time to leave.,UNK
10125,The pharmacy staff is the best. They remember you and do what they can to help if there are problems. Pearl and Wayne (pharmacist) and some of the best people.,UNK
10126,Kristie came all the way to Henderson to meet me for one signature I needed notarized took care of business done and done! Thanks Kristie your the best.,UNK
10127,"Not great but not terrible. Big units that offer very spacious layouts, however the abundance of asu students makes living in the area stressful",UNK
10128,Stopped in this place and could not get past the lack of cleanliness and the terrible odor upon entry. This location definitely needs some attention to detail and cleanliness. We decided not to eat here based on the lack of cleanliness.,UNK
10129,This location was very cool...  I loved the feel of the 5 levels with wide open staircases.  It was fun to browse but difficult to shop.  I did see many more colorways of styles we have back home in Milwaukee.,UNK
10130,I love Bruegger's Bagels. The staff was very friendly and I was able to get what I wanted very quickly.,UNK
10131,"The evening started out nice but quickly turned bad when my boyfriend's food never showed up. On  top of that, the server was not attentive. However they did take off my meal as well as his, from the bill to compensate. My food was really good...too bad the overall experience ruined the evening.",UNK
10132,"Drinks are overpriced with no happy hour, which is a deal breaker in spite of some good drinks and atmosphere before the late-night hipster flood descends on Fremont East. If you come bring a friend who will buy your drinks and arrive early for a chill vibe",UNK
10133,"Good neighborhood bar/restaurant. Always good food. Never got sick, or anyone I was with get sick. Have been there with another person upto party's of 10. Always friendly staff. Usually goto Billy's once a month, maybe more. Living right on top of the hill from Billy's, we are regulars there!",UNK
10134,The service was 100% better here than others where I've been.  The food presentation needs just a little work and the oysters were a tad in need of more judging before serving (minus 1 star).  Not a bad choice when you're in Uptown Charlotte...,UNK
10135,The yogurt is good. But the toppings here suck when it comes to fresh fruits. Just a lot of chocolate chips and cookies. It is a convenient location though so I keep coming back. I think Mojo yogurt is a better option.,UNK
10136,"Pretty good for Scottsdale Chinese food. Got delivery as well and they were quite quick, delivering 15 minutes earlier than expected! \n\nGot the house lo mien, pepper steak and home style bean curd. Pretty good compared to the other places around here and we had plenty of food for leftovers.",UNK
10137,David is great.  He knows what he is doing and has great stories.  I have been going to this salon for about a year and he knows how to cut my hair.  I have really thick and course hair so it's hard to find someone good.  The  place also looks great inside big glass garage doors that are open when it is nice out.,UNK
10138,"i'm From Atlanta GA, stumbled on this little jem. Best fish tacos i've had and better caesar salad i've had in long time, got the dressing just right. HIGHLY recommend",UNK
10139,"I agree with Sal , the drive thru is horrible and parking lot is way too small. I have been told this location is the third busiest in Pittsburgh only bhind Monroeville and mcknight Ed",UNK
10140,My favorite Mexican restaurant ever. I love the chile relleno and the aqua de sandia is THE best I have ever had in my life(including in Mexico).,UNK
10141,I live thriftys ice cream. And now homemade cookies? This place is awesome. It's 20 minutes away but well worth it. Such a simple idea and better than buying an ice cream cookie sandwich at Walmart. Delicious!,UNK
10142,"Jimmy Johns has got to be my guilty pleasure. Love the Beach Club and the salt and vinegar chips. This location is fairly new and it does the JJ chain well. Although they do keep the music louder than I'd like. Great place, great sandwiches.",UNK
10143,"This is hands down the best Veterinarian Hospital in the 89031 zip code. Dr's Bullard, Lavigne have always treated my pets like they were their own. I would recommend any one looking for an honest and compassionate veterinarian hospital to give this place a try!",UNK
10144,Drive through takes forever in the morning 20 minutes for one burrito. Egg Shells in my Carne Asada Burroito after I waited forever  :(,UNK
10145,"Lots of food, good selection. I'm a little leery of  Asian buffet's, but you get your dollars worth here.. fresh Sushi.  Mongolian wok made to order. Lunch price of $ 6.99. not bad.",UNK
10146,Horrible stay!! Never again one of the rooms gave my sister a nasty rash. Got charge with room damage for something that was broken already! And for that we got kicked out and when we tried to talk to a manager about it  we were escorted by officers to leave we couldn't even leave a complain. I don't recommend it!,UNK
10147,"Love, love, love the Pesto Chicken pizza with mozzarella!! I can eat one daily! All my picky kids love the pizza too and the fact that you can choose the style of you want and the toppings! Salads look great too although I've never had one. Fresh!",UNK
10148,"realized they forgot my fish sandwich and Mc-chicken after i got home. Called back several time, no one ever picked up the phone. What do you do in this situation? i wonder i will ever got my food/money back... sign...",UNK
10149,"Nordstrom is high end yet within reach. Though it comes across as ritzy, there are plenty of sales and affordable items. The shoe department always has a great selection.\n\nThe upstairs cafe and downstairs e-bar always have great food!",UNK
10150,"nice, fresh mexican food, fast food with an elegant flair.  Nice salsa bar and portabello mushroom tacos  were awesome....no high fat feel after finishing your food.",UNK
10151,"Very loud, bad service, and the food doesn't met the expectations. We came w a party of 10 people, we didn't even get menus for a while, it was so loud we could hardly listen to our server. Dirty plates were sitting in our table for a long time. Super disappointed",UNK
10152,We had the burgers and the nachos both were just mediocre. I expected much more from the way the place looked and the prices. Service was just ok our drinks remained empty for most of the meal.,UNK
10153,"I'm on a wait list... 45 min later, I'm still waiting. Then one of the techs goes to the back leaving only two techs at the floor.\nUGGG!",UNK
10154,"I like the place for cocktails, but it has a horrible menu - sandwiches and salads.  The food is not great either.  Needs a new chef/menu.  Good atmosphere for drinks.  \n\nLots of smokers on the back patio - ugh.",UNK
10155,"Excellent place, super friendly staff. It's under construction.. remodeling it but still much better selection than \""neighborhood Wal-Mart\"" for healthier organic foods.",UNK
10156,"I'm not one to usually eat frozen yogurt, but went here with some friends and loved it! Tons of great yogurt options and toppings. I like how you can build it how you like it. I will definitely go back again and recommend you try it yourself too!",UNK
10157,little disappointed. couldnt tell pork and brisket apart.. chicken was overcooked. cobbler and potato salad were excellent. would give a second chance,UNK
10158,"LOVE this place. Whenever we have guests in town we take them here, and everyone loves it. Such a unique experience with all the couches. Their happy hour offers some really nice pricing.",UNK
10159,"I love makeup and so therefore I love CosBar for what if offers...however, not such a big fan of the customer service. I have been to the CosBar in Aspen, CO and the people were much more friendly there. However, at this location, you are clearly reminded that you are in Scottsdale :(.",UNK
10160,They charged us for water. They didn't even offer tap. The food was poor to mediocre for ethiopian. We ordered the veggie combo. Merkato is better.,UNK
10161,It takes a little bit to understand the owner but this is one of my favorite places to eat. Lunch prices are great and u get a lot of food.,UNK
10162,The room was clean but very small. Looks like the rooms could use some updating. The staff was very courteous and accommodating. The workout area was extremely small and only has 4 cardio machines.,UNK
10163,I had both of my card spray painted and they worked with my insurance to fix both cars with no cost to me. It took a little longer than I would've liked but they did good work.,UNK
10164,I would rather eat a raw fish out of Tempe Town Lake than have to sit through another disgusting meal at Red Lobster. Gggggeeeeerooooossss!,UNK
10165,Kaylynn is very professional & very friendly. She is an extremely talented aesthetician & a master of waxing and skin care. You will love your experience as I did.,UNK
10166,Horrible. The service was slow. The food wasn't any good. It is pretty expensive for what it is. Very disappointed. After seeing the rating in yelp I was expecting a lot better  of a restaurant.,UNK
10167,And little box by the river serving delicious lobster rolls in the summer at a reasonable price.  Also does lobster pizza and a surprisingly good clan chowder.  Lobster was fresh and you are given a good sized portion of it.,UNK
10168,decent food at a decent price.\n\nThink Denny's and then add a Chinese menu to it...that's what the Victorian room entails.,UNK
10169,"Imagine if the burger restaurant islands had a baby with rubios. Great fish and chips, clam chowder, and perfectly cooked calamari. All wrapped up with a very casual Hawaiian surf theme. Would recommend to anyone to try.",UNK
10170,"As good as advertised.  Go it alone if you want to avoid the lines.  I walked in, signed up on the list and was seated in 2 minutes.  Food took about 15, but it was nicely prepared.  I'll come back.",UNK
10171,"Love this place...even better than the Arcadia location!  Great atmosphere, good service, great food and drinks!  Great way to spend a Saturday afternoon hanging out.",UNK
10172,"Ok so went back and ordered the full sandwich and soup.  It came with chips also, which you do not get when you get suckered into the half soup half sandwich thing.  This time: I felt like I got what I paid for!  Much better and will be back!!",UNK
10173,"I was excited to try this place on vacation. However, was very disappointed! Service was so bad it ruined the restaurant for me, but the food was also sub-par. Do not go here.",UNK
10174,"Good show...better for the younger audience. Take your kids they'll really enjoy it. The costumes were amazing, they looked like the real thing. Just not my cup of tea but the wifey thought it was great.",UNK
10175,These guys really need to step it up. This location is haggard inside and out. The service is really bad. Nobody is communicating with each other or their customers. And the food is not consistent with the other locations at all.,UNK
10176,Update: Orange Theory has since refunded the fee they withdrew from my account. It took a lot of effort but finally did the right thing because their records were incorrect.,UNK
10177,Genuine stuff with so many unique options. Love they offer calzone.  Spicy olive oil a hit. Good for business or pleasure.,UNK
10178,I've been to a lot of Thai restaurants and none has ever been this disappointing. I always judge each by their Pad Thai and this place has the worst I've ever tasted.  Highly recommend you try someplace else first!,UNK
10179,"They were friendly and nice, but I ordered chicken curry wrap and immediately found a hair that stretched from one end of the wrap to the other in my first bite. For $11 I expect more. I won't be returning or recommending them to anyone I know.",UNK
10180,I will give two stars just for the sake of their smoothies and by using fresh fruits. \n\nI've been here once and tasted some of their menus. Not a fan of their food. So tedious and just an ordinary Chinese resto.,UNK
10181,BOMB DOT COM!\n\na $6 amazing sandwich at any hour of the day in Vegas? YES PLEASE! You can't beat the price nor the taste. They are so yummy! \n\nmy favorite is the Earl's Club\n\nenjoy :),UNK
10182,Ordered the hakkah fried rice Ginger chili tofu and the Curry noodle  The portions were tiny AND food was very oily. Would never order from here again,UNK
10183,I hate it when I call a store and can't get a live person on the line or anyone to pick up the phone once I've been transferred--which was the case with the plumbing department at this location. You suck.,UNK
10184,I'm from Chicago and I thought the pizza was excellent.  I would go back again for sure!  There was no mold by the way. ;),UNK
10185,Great fast Asian food. Place was packed during lunch. Everything was fresh and flavorful. I like that combos are so cheap and cone with fresh potstickers.,UNK
10186,"Don the owner is friendly but his shop is pricey and the bicycle mechanic that worked on my bike is rude. Worked on it twice, the idiot couldn't get it right so had to take to another shop and I will never return.",UNK
10187,"I came here with $400 and left with nothing. I went to the manager to complain but he was unsympathetic. I got to play some fun games but they would not return my deposit when I lost. This enrages me and I do not seek to return. Why, then, did I keep playing?? WHY?",UNK
10188,The new location is amazing.  Jimmy carries just about every trade paperback you can possibly imagine.  There are two big couches in the middle of the store to let you sit and talk to othe enthusiast.,UNK
10189,"I got my mani and pedi here...decent job but over priced, I was told when I called it would be $65 and when I went to pay they charged me $85...I always leave tips so I ended up spending $100 on a mani, pedi. Will not return.",UNK
10190,The food is average. Worst part is those stupid waitresses there. \nThey are the meanest people in the entire experience.  \nI advice my friends also not to go there - and go downtown to someplace else. \nThey should learn how to work in serve in the restaurant,UNK
10191,Typical Vegas hotel American restaurant. Very classy and modern decor which makes this place an easy (if not safe choice) for entertaining clients or taking a date.\n\nI tried the ahi tuna burger and found it good though nothing mind blowing.,UNK
10192,"Cool little hipsterish dive bar located just at the end of Fremont street experience.  Came here to take a little break from the strip. It's nice, clean and the prices are decent. I'd definitely go back.",UNK
10193,Otten is the worst Dr. ever. The office staff isn't all that great either! He gave me a few shots in the knee and it didn't help at all. I would NEVER recommend this office or this Dr. to anyone.,UNK
10194,"The 3-item omelet was HUGE and loaded with ingredients! The pancakes were large and fluffy, just perfect! Service is a tad slow, but super friendly... not bad for only one waitress in a full diner! We will be back for sure!",UNK
10195,"Not a huge fan. Went with high hopes. But, grumpy staff. The name is deceiving because the food took 30 mins to come out.  And no coke products.",UNK
10196,"Okay lunch special.   Get what you pay for.  Too much breading, hush puppies were a bit tiny, salads were soso",UNK
10197,"This place is awesome.  We live a half mile away and never knew it was there it is so tucked away.  Beautiful farm with tons of shade trees.  They have fresh produce for cheap, fresh breads, jams, honey etc.  Homemade butter is soooo good.  We bought some produce then walked around the garden.  Highly recommended.",UNK
10198,Really enjoyed the pub today for lunch. My husband and I shared a few different appetizers and everything was delicious. Little expensive but isn't everything in Vegas? Kinberley was our waitress and she was very good! We enjoyed her! Great experience I would recommend!,UNK
10199,"Always have the best service & great food. Plus I forgot my wallet there & when I returned to retrieve it five hours later,  everything was in it. I appreciate the honesty & the character of it's staff.",UNK
10200,"Always fun to shop here. Have been going to this location since I was twelve. The SAs are always friendly, funny, outgoing, and sweet! Of course they need to be, but they really do a swell job. They make it so that you don't leave empty handed :) A pit stop for anyone looking for fun and individual pieces.",UNK
10201,"Pretty great pizza but when I pay for double pepperoni on a pizza that feeds \""2-3\"" and it runs me about $20..I'd love to see more than 2 pepperonis per slice.",UNK
10202,"BBQ sauce was good and so were the sides. A bit of sweet and a bit of spice. Not bad at all and we will be back. The sides are a bit lacking, but, add more sauce to the beans and they're MUCH better. Try the coleslaw on the pulled pork...very nice.",UNK
10203,Visited recently. Nebula has a comfortable atmosphere and very friendly assistance. The tasting table is great. Loved the flavors - even though the selection was limited. Being able to try the flavors is a great plus. Limited selection of hardware - but what they do have is very good.,UNK
10204,They keep deleting my negative review that the SharpStone grinders they have are knockoffs and they only acknowledge this if you inquire directly if they are knockoffs.  They sell them as if they are true SharpStone grinders.,UNK
10205,"Happy Hour staple...house wine 1/2 price on Tuesdays.  Ordered pizza to go...chicken BBQ...I loved it!  Thin crust, flavorful toppings...Bartenders are fantastic! Cozy bar.",UNK
10206,"\""The friendliest airport in America...\"" God help us... Basically I view this airport in the same way that I view AZ as a whole... Fake, rude, and somewhere I only go out of necessity. Very excited to go back to beautiful, friendly, and delicious New Mexico!",UNK
10207,The food was so-so and our service was slow. Also the music was so loud that I couldn't hear half of what my wife was saying. Now that's not a bad thing but when it was my turn to speak it was annoying. We won't be going back. There are many better\n places to dine.,UNK
10208,This is a calorie friendly food truck. I had an amazing turkey pesto panini for lunch. It was so filling and satisfying. Everyone raved about the mini keylime pies. That will be my next mission of sabotage.  Give it a try if they arrive at your next event!,UNK
10209,Outdated. Rooms are not too bad but tv channel lineup is nowhere to be found. And there is like 4 channels that come in. Paper thin walls as well. Stay somewhere else.,UNK
10210,My best friend and I went here after lunch for a treat! At first I didn't really want to try it. I was only there because my friend insisted we go. She ordered a taro with green tea mochi balls and I have to admit it was delicious! Don't judge a book by its cover!,UNK
10211,The guy with dreads whom I will assume is the owner was standoffish.  Very unfriendly like.   My bill for a combo meal was $8.00.  As I sat there eating noticed on their billboard menu that the same meal listed as $5.99.  Wings were nothing to brag about.  Not impressed.,UNK
10212,"WOW!  All the 4 and 5 star reviews.  I'll not question their opinion....I'll only say that after 6-8 visits here, (usually at lunch), I would never go there again.",UNK
10213,Just went in for my 3rd and last time. Incredibly horrible customer service. I use the 3 strikes rule - so I'm out. If I ran my business of 25 years with staff like theirs I would have been out of business a long time ago.,UNK
10214,"Happy I decided to stop in. I was greeted and taken care of like they really appreciated my business. These days when you see a business who cares about their customers, knows what they are doing and does the job with a smile, you keep going back, I will. Thank you Jiffy Lube, Scottsdale for being there.",UNK
10215,I've stopped here a few times now.  Not much on a regular basis.  Subway makes an OK sandwich.  The staff here has always been friendly and efficient.,UNK
10216,My husband and I order from this place when don't have time to prepare dinner. I can pretty much tell you everything on the menu is awesome!,UNK
10217,Awesome service from these guys! I highly recommend them to anyone looking for good customer service from an insurance company! Call and ask for a quote.,UNK
10218,CRAZY overpriced unappealing boring entrees with a pretentious atmosphere...move on...  there are way way WAAYYY better choices in town.,UNK
10219,I've been to PHM several times and every time I received the same compassionate care.  We are so fortunate to have such a great hospital in Matthews.,UNK
10220,"nothing good happens at club rehab lol\nHampton Beach NH is the same, just add cocaine and E-junkies make the world go round-keep rollin crackheads",UNK
10221,The front desk is rude. My appointment time was not honored and they expected me to wait over an hour. I can't say enough bad things about this doctors office. And it looks like you'll catch something in the waiting room.,UNK
10222,Haven't even had my order taken. 20 minutes since waitress told us she would go get a pen. Terrible service. She was the only waitress around since we got here. Finally a different waitress came and then told me I couldn't have all three meats on my sliders! Well policy is policy. But dang.,UNK
10223,Love this place!  I don't know what I would do without it.  I'm into just about every kind of craft and they have something for it all.,UNK
10224,"The decor and vibe are way classier than the Peoria location, however the service is a bit lacking. It's large, clean, and has indoor and outdoor seating, but it definitely is suited for the Old Town Scottsdale crowd. Their menu is pricier and more upscale than the Peoria location, as well.",UNK
10225,This mall is just not the same as it was about 15 or more years ago. I really miss the Ice skating place and the department stores are closed up. Not much in business here. :(,UNK
10226,"the room is dirty especially the bed which has bread crumb. i guess they didnt clean the room when we check in. the room is small. compare palm place to other hotel, this is the worst.",UNK
10227,Great spot to eat lunch and dinner. Sundae roll is amazing!!!! The charge for the tea is the only reason they are getting 4 stars :),UNK
10228,Went here on 12/28/13. Had a Thai Ice Tea. Didn't taste right. Would never go back here for the Thai Ice Tea. Not sure about the food though.,UNK
10229,Marty was incredible to work with! He did a wonderful job with our pool fence- showed up on time and the fence is fabulous! We would recommend him to anyone!,UNK
10230,"Best white sauce on a pizza I've ever had! The crust was a little bland for my liking, reminded me of a frozen pizza you heat up in the microwave BUT strangely enough I would go back. A sign on the door said the restaurant was under new ownership so maybe they are still feeling it all out?",UNK
10231,Absolutely loved it!!!! I am a vegetarian and the had two different types if tacos that were so delicious. The only thing I didnt like was they CHARGE you for chips and salsa!!!! As delicious as they were. I think that is just not right :(,UNK
10232,"Excellent food, an excellent service... This place is very nice and clean, food is so fresh and tasty...one of my favorite spots in Vegas... :)",UNK
10233,"Beautiful and impressive building, inside and out, worth visiting for itself. Main auditorium not ideal for chamber recital - de Silva's piano managed to fill the hall but from first row of dress circle Perlman's musicality & virtuosity was often drowned out. Big shame.",UNK
10234,"Love this place!   My 11 yo daughter who is down right terrified of dentists absolutely LOVED Dr. King (Dr. Angel was on maternity leave).   Very nice, cool, young, and awesome.   I'm even changing who I see to do to Angel Dentistry.",UNK
10235,pernaps i was expecting too much.  had the blackberry pancakes.  kindy pricey.  it wasn't bad but just didn't stand out.  the noise level was not average it was kind high and the tables are way too close together.  i might give them another try sometime but no hurry there.,UNK
10236,My main reason to go here was because we has a groupon. Boy am i glad we went! Excellent food and fantastic service!!! Their menu is huge and yummy margaritas!,UNK
10237,"Love this bar! Great mix of people, good drinks and cool, relaxed atmosphere...what else can you ask for in a bar?",UNK
10238,"I really like Fresh & Easy.  However, this is not my favorite branch.  They don't have a fresh bakery, and they don't seem to have as good sales as other branches.  But it's still a good market.",UNK
10239,"there are a lot of italian restaurants in town, but none are as good for the price.  we love the angel hair pasta with meatballs.  great comfort food.  we also have them pack sandwiches for us when we're picnicking or enjoying jazz in the park.  try it for lunch or dinner.  you won't be disappointed.",UNK
10240,Wow...great food and wine makes for a wonderful experience.   The setting with the doors open makes this a must visit place to eat.  Strongly recommended after two dinner visits and a breakfast visit.  Consistantly excellent.,UNK
10241,"Yummy!! The pizza is delish, the fried mushrooms heavenly, the carrot cake to die for and my family loves their wings!! I highly recommend!",UNK
10242,Terrible pizza! We ordered the monster pizza and it was literally a preheated pepperoni and cheese with all of the works added afterward and reheated. Very disappointed!!!!!,UNK
10243,"Im not a huge club man, too old ;-) but this place was a nice stop.  Like others have said, no cover, no long wait etc etc.  for vegas is quite amazing.  stop by, even if you don't like the place, without a cover you can leave without feeling like you are losing money leaving.",UNK
10244,"Just as everyone else mentioned, they will fee you to death! I was fortunate enough to have them waive the late fees since THEY input the wrong cc number. The gym is not worth the hassle involved when you do have to cancel.",UNK
10245,So... I've never actually eaten here but the drinks are pretty awesome. My friends and I come down once in a while to enjoy the live music and drink ginormous beers with souvenir glasses. I've definitely got enough glasses now so I guess I should try the food so I can update this review.,UNK
10246,"Can't really go wrong with chips and salsa, $3 mexican beers and fajitas!  The service is always great.  Somehow I end up here on Sundays with my Mom and boyfriend for beers and lunch.  We watched the final World Cup game there, which was super fun.",UNK
10247,This is the worst store in Las Vegas. They never have anything you need. If I could I would give them 0 stars I would. Their customer service is beyond poor and I am done ever shopping at this Vons. Someone from management needs to really pay attention and either care or someone needs to be reported.,UNK
10248,Service is good and they have a managers special during the week that's nice.  The manager seems to really like her job.  The people who clean the rooms are #1 and Ashley at the front desk.,UNK
10249,"the best thing about this place is the food options in the lobby.  Otherwise you can stay somewhere else and walk there lol.  Their customer service was horrible.  I've been to Vegas many time, in many casino's, they do not give you the Vegas experience you look to receive.",UNK
10250,Our waitress was attentive. We ordered the combination meal and were highly pleased.  there was enough food to share for two people. The pace was leisurely and the food was tasty,UNK
10251,Only 8 lanes and they are over priced.\nHate the concept of reserving lanes.\nDecent music and crowd.,UNK
10252,Ed Hardy is tacky as nails. I ate at social house above it. I'm not fond of this club and the fact that Costco sells these shirts. No cheerios here.,UNK
10253,"Great burgers and free drinks on your birthday. However, they have apparently started taking reservations (something they didn't do in the past). If you don't have one, prepare to be condescended to by their snooty host, who seems unable to believe that people don't make dinner reservations at bars.",UNK
10254,This place is closed. Please remove from the list. I saw the store on yelp and I went in. It switched to a different business.,UNK
10255,Went there during when their site said they would be open and they were closed. This totally ruined a group outing and watching the All-Star game today. We gladly gave our business to someone else and will never try to go here again!,UNK
10256,"The menu was small and underwhelming. The flatbread pizza most likely came out of the box. They didn't have the sauces, so the gave us ketchup to go with over cooked shrimp/bacon and extremely greasy fries.",UNK
10257,"not that i have anything to compare this to, but the lighting was too dark and the women not very friendly.  if you're getting paid, you should be able to afford feigned interest...",UNK
10258,"over crowded, under staffed, and not very clean.  my suggestion would be to go on a Monday or Tuesday.  It is not a fun place for little ones any more. Apparently now tweens and teens like to spend friday nights there instead of at the mall",UNK
10259,Trying this joint for the first time love the friendly atmosphere so many choices I am almost overwhelmed but I did the semi serious burger couldn't do anything larger will let you all know how it goes when I am done devouring my burger lol,UNK
10260,Rip off 8 dollars a beer!  Seriously not kidding!  Insane!  Truly beyond belief!  Pizzas also very overpriced!,UNK
10261,In heaven every time I step foot in this restaurant. I can't say enough about Joe's Seafood and I can't think of one entree that I haven't loved! Great lunch menu as well and the seafood salad is to die for!,UNK
10262,The food wasn't the best but it was decent \nThe price is a little high for the quality of the meals. Friends got drinks and they enjoyed those.,UNK
10263,"Claim Jumper is always pretty good, but this is an extra nice place to eat.  Town Square is a great pace to hangout and go to movies.  How the area is always packed on weekend, Claim Jumper never seems that busy.  The staff is helpful, and the food is above par.",UNK
10264,"Appetizers and pizza both fantastic.  The eggplant pizzetta was super yummy!\nService was okay, but it took 30 minutes to get dessert out.\nOverall worth the trip.",UNK
10265,"My wife and I stopped in last weekend for a fish taco plate. The place was filthy, undermanned, and hot. I hope management will take corrective action,  or we will find a new place for one of our favorite meals.",UNK
10266,"Servers were nice and attentive, the draft beer was tasty, and the trivia fun. Will return. I didn't eat anything this time, but i have in the past. I had the Beef on Weck and it was tasty. I would return again and try something different.",UNK
10267,Great beer. Good food. Great atmosphere.  My only beef is that they don't have happy hour prices on food.  A little overpriced for the poor college crowd but it's within stumbling distance of my apartment so I think it's great.,UNK
10268,I tried the mint cupcake and the raspberry truffle cupcake. I wasn't impressed with either. They also are little for the price you pay.,UNK
10269,small casino area but i did have better luck with the $5 min roulette table beats the hell out of aria $15 min bet. the buffet was good for its price wish they had more food options. free luggage storage great for an early check out an late flight out.,UNK
10270,"Their shrimp dumplings are my favorite! The service is quick. I have never dined in, but their carry-out never disappoints. This is one of my favorite Chinese restaurants in Champaign!",UNK
10271,"Bad service at this location.\n\nGood iced coffee, breakfast Wrap with just egg and cheese and hash brown bites.  Very inexpensive and I like the hot sauce to put on it.\n\nI also like that they are open till 8 pm and I can get breakfast anytime.",UNK
10272,"This is a pho is soooo tasty, the crispy egg rolls are delish. I would pass on the shrimp fried rice. Nice friendly a atmosphere.",UNK
10273,They give you a free chocolate square when you walk in the store. The chocolates covered strawberries are huge and delicious. There's free wifi at the Linq.,UNK
10274,Fun spot! Service was great. Food was so so but that's what I expect eating at a bar.  Drinks were great.,UNK
10275,I've have stayed in Las Vegas many time but most recently at this casino and let tell you it's was nicest casino I've ever stayed at their new tower is really nice and clean the shower was really nice as well would definitely stay here again without hesitation unlike other casino in Las Vegas.,UNK
10276,"It is a clean place and they have good service. The Koi pond is pretty cool. The sandwich I ordered was pretty awful, don't get the turkey because it is like packaged meat you can buy at a supermarket. The prices were on par with other delis, but you can get a much better sandwich for the same price elsewhere.",UNK
10277,24/7 weekdays & long hours on the weekend. Plus if your with a Black Card member it's free. This place leaves little margin for excuses not to get/keep healthy. It's a full blown no brainer & if your not getting busy live'in ... your getting busy die'in,UNK
10278,I make a weekly vist to this place because I feel they have the best breakfast I have ever had. Very clean and friendly staff. The extra giant is me standby. Food is freshly prepared and timely. Cash only. You can not miss this place for breakfast. Give em a try you won't be dissapointed.,UNK
10279,"Service was slow. Waited for 45 mins and no food.  High End Vietnamese food, not worth the wait or the time. Find another place to eat.",UNK
10280,"Pizza Old Roma is definitely the Best Pizza I have ever eaten. Great service always, and very reasonable. If you are out and just looking for a Great Pizza this is the place. My husband is from Jersey and loves this place. Says Jersey ain't got nothin on this place. lol",UNK
10281,"Always makes me feel better to have pho when I'm feeling sick. They make amazing food, have outstanding service and great choices.",UNK
10282,"Food is ok but service is good, I mainly come here to watch the football game and have a few drinks TVs on every wall with different games going on and the patios big screen it's awesome.",UNK
10283,"Haven't eaten here in years but decided to give it a shot again. Went in, was seated immediately, then the wait began. After being ignored by 5 different servers attending to other tables next to us for over 15 minutes we walked out. They weren't even busy.",UNK
10284,$10 huge gyro's for two on Tuesday's can't be beat. EXCELLENT.  Only complaint is they kept the restaurant a little on the warm side.,UNK
10285,Food was okay for buffet standards. Don't be fooled by the inexpensive rating. The place was quite spendy - over $70 for 2 people and no drinks.,UNK
10286,"wow. horrible experience here.  \""Tina\"" the bartender, rude, confrontational, a little bit scary.  sad, since we've been coming here for karaoke a lot recently, and its always been great,  until tonight.  we will be reversing the charges on our card and never returning.",UNK
10287,"The happiest staff in Champaign-Urbana! Great breakfast and lunch, coffee, or just a light meal! I will definitely frequent this place!",UNK
10288,"Huge, like a Walmart inside but I was a bit dismayed since they seem to have a worse selection of items than other Ross stores. They didn't have a huge housewares section but this seems to be a good place to find clothes since most of the store's space is utilized for clothing.",UNK
10289,"Pour du poulet toujours juteux et genereux et une livraison fiable. Oui, certains mentionnent la dame particuliere au telephone, mais elle fait partie du charme ! \nOubliez le St-Hubert!!!!!'",UNK
10290,Really small selection for an H&M store. I would call it H&M express or something. It's about 1/8 the size of normal H&Ms.  I was however fortunate to find a shirt to wear that night because I didn't like the one I brought from home.,UNK
10291,Il s'agit ici d'un des meilleurs restaurant de sushi en ville. Les sushis sont excellents.  Seul point n\u00e9gatif: le restaurant ferme assez t\u00f4t.,UNK
10292,I appreciate that they clean their hands and yours in front if you prior to beginning.  I'm always satisfied with my eyebrows afterward :),UNK
10293,Stopped in after doing some shopping at Fashion Place. I loved the rock n roll music. We had the bbq chicken salad and my wife had the penne chicken pasta. Food and the service was good. We would go back next time in Scottsdale,UNK
10294,Great course-nice fairways and the greens rolled well too even though it's clear they get a lot of play.  I hope to come back now that I know the layout better.  Definitely worth playing once since the PGA tour has an event here.,UNK
10295,I have been recommended this restaurant from my boyfriend. He loves sushi and said this place is great. Thank you C for the tip xx,UNK
10296,"Sure miss our Rubios in Surprise but this is a nice treat near the movie theater on Deer Valley! Food is solid, staff was friendly, salsa was yum as always. Can always count on Rubios for consistent food.",UNK
10297,"I try this place last Sunday let me get straight to the foo we order humus dip, duck banh fit, souls roll and and pork belly. The humus haft of them were burn the duck banh fit bread we cold and chewy the roll were too small and the pork belly too salty .never again",UNK
10298,"Love this little place! Had a great flavored coffee, caramel chocolate, and a pumpkin chocolate chip scone.  Both very very good.  The staff was very pleasant and helpful. It's a great space to relax.  It does get a little busy around lunch time, but not too bad.  I enjoy the quiet mornings.  Great place!",UNK
10299,I'm a firm believer in juicing and this place delivers the goods! Friendly staff and great fresh selection. So glad I have one more option for juice! And it's right by my work so it's totally perfect for me.,UNK
10300,she never showed up for the appointment... I called a couple of times. I even bought a Yelp deal and never got to use it... Booo,UNK
10301,"Grass fed beef. Can't go wrong there. No complaints about the burger. The beef was juicy and the jalape\u00f1o bacon had exactly enough heat. Just wished the fries had a little more seasoning, though.",UNK
10302,"Great addition to old town dining. Great brunch, lunch, and dinner. Their patio is very nice, as it is at the waterfront. Selection for brunch is small, but spanning. Sandwiches for lunch are eclectic and delicious.",UNK
10303,"Really good, really expensive pizza joint. Out of the 5 times we've ordered from them, it was on time and delicious 4 times but cold and burnt the last time. But if it's 2am and you're hungry and too lazy to go anywhere and have $50 to spend, I recommend this place.",UNK
10304,Womp womp. Weak strippers. Weak drinks. The only time this place is worth it is when they have an artist and even then it be so packed with kids that you don't really wanna be in there. This place is just so ugh ...,UNK
10305,Apple cinnamon cake with cream cheese frosting is like eating a piece of autumn! Get there. Get one. They'll be gone before long!,UNK
10306,"Regardless of which HP I go to, I am happy with the food...except for the chicken wings.  blah.  They're soggy.  But the pizza!  Love them!  as well as the chopped salad.",UNK
10307,"Tasty pasta, but the quiche has a weird sedimentary crust and they serve rocky roasty potatoes with EVERYTHING. Also the vegan soup usually... tastes it.",UNK
10308,Food was amazing! Their pizzas are a knock out and so were their mixed drinks. They have some great selections on the drinks and craft beers as well. Atmosphere is very nice. Has that modern feel with some warmth and class. We will be back for sure!,UNK
10309,This guy is full of shit he lies to get you to buy from his store the markup is double or triple the other fish stores in town and does not even give you a receipt for your purchase most of the time. The store is cramped beyond comfortable the selection in freshwater is second only to trop aquarium.,UNK
10310,This is the kind of independent country place we all need to get behind and support if we don't want the entire landscape consisting of the big chain restaurants.,UNK
10311,Food was good.  Service was mixed.  Wierd interaction with a bartender who said the place had nothing to do with San Francisco.  All the marketing in the hotel seemed to lend itself that way.,UNK
10312,The best time to go is @ night if you're able. We had a pick up @10:30pm and was able to pick an suv out of three different models. Customer service wasn't too bad either. There were two other workers and the guy helping us was able to help with any questions we had.,UNK
10313,Not impressed. Noodles were bland. Food was too expensive for what it was.  House chow mein was not very good. Cuttle fish ball soup didn't have much flavor. Overrated.,UNK
10314,We split a Barbabietole Pistacchio e Caprino (beet salad) and then had Rigatoni Toscano which had just the right amount of spice! It was a great dinner and had Monetti LaRossa beer. Great dinner to start the weekend. Can't go wrong with this place!,UNK
10315,Stopped by for dinner last night. Unlike the first few times this was disappointing. Fries were soggy and the burgers were just ok. Consistency is the key for a good food joint whether a burger place our a sit down restaurant.,UNK
10316,Stopped in for a birthday card and ended up getting a Mother's Day card for my mum and my mother in law and a valentines card for my husband. Great selection and nice wee shop,UNK
10317,"Great food, reasonable prices and EXCELLENT SERVICE!   The owners get to know you and recognize you on return visits!   What more can you ask for in a family style restaurant?  \n\nThey are very accommodating for large groups too!!",UNK
10318,"Great service, fast communication. Prompt and reliable service.  Used Matthew for our soccer teams uniforms and he came through with flying colors.  Made it so much easier for us that nobody had to be assigned laundry duties and could be out doing other things.",UNK
10319,"Nice ambiance in the patio area behind, but the food is mediocre at best. Soggy and bland tacos. Very slow service and a bit uptight as well, like not enough help.",UNK
10320,Food was great but server got order wrong maybe because music is to loud. They play a good mix of music that we like. Over all we would come back here.,UNK
10321,"Amazing! This is my new pizza place! The seafood pizza is fantastic; think better than Pizzeria Uno's seafood pizza. We also had an excellent salad, and their Smore Pizza is decadent! The owner was so nice. Definately give this place a try, you won't be disappointed.",UNK
10322,"Was a real letdown...\nTried to book, told to come...\nStaff was quite rude... Left!",UNK
10323,I'd give it 3.5 stars if I could. From the other reviews I was expecting a more dramatic space. Just had a few glasses of wine though and a cheese plate. No dinner.,UNK
10324,"Great service, but almost always packed! Definitely should make appointment if you're not willing to wait 20 minutes. Also a little on the expensive side for gel manicure.",UNK
10325,This place is poo! Their jumbo Burrito should be called baby Burrito. Over priced by way too much. It's total trash! And the new id law is stupid!,UNK
10326,"Pita jungle is pita jungle is pita jungle. They're all the same, No matter which one you go to. They all have the awkward hipster  staff members and the food is the same at each one. Beyond that the food is always good and I appreciate they're being a healthy alternative on this side of town.",UNK
10327,"Super average burgers. Not sure what all the hype is with these 5 star reviews.\n\nTook a large family here and out of the 8 of us, 8 of us agrees it was average and In n Out or Fatburger would have been money better spent.\n\nSkip.",UNK
10328,Not a big Denny's fan ...but let me tell you this place gives you greatest value for your $ on the strip. If budget conscious or over 55 ask for their budget menus & Over 55 menu options.,UNK
10329,"Pizza is very good, and if you go on Wednesdays, they have thier Wacky Wedneday special, Large 1-topping for 5.99.  Free Flavored crust and usually quick service.  The employee even offered us free drinks while we waited in the dining room.",UNK
10330,one of my favorite restaurants.  Love to visit Gabi.  \n\nthe baguette is extraordinary.  the butter is out of this world.  breakfast is outstanding.,UNK
10331,Great breakfast place inside Mandalay bay. The cafe over looks the walk way to the pool.\n\nThe corned beef hash is excellent and so are the waffles. \n\nIts too bad they don't have refills on juice. Great place none the less.,UNK
10332,"Not sure why it say's closed. I was just there 2 days ago. Dirty, grimy, poor service.. Over priced semi-fresh food. (I guess, fresh is 'relative')",UNK
10333,Had a wonderful stay! The rooms were nice and the lobby bar area was really neat! Enjoyed the service at the W XYZ bar with a beautiful bartender Rebecca!,UNK
10334,Saw this show on my honeymoon. I had seen a couple Cirque shows before and dragged my new husband along.  After seeing the show my husband is now a huge fan.  We've been to 4 since this one.  He's hooked.,UNK
10335,"This place food was not memorable to me.\nBut I remember service was bad.\nThe waitress kept insisting to cook for us, but the problem was that she didn't cook enough meat. My friends and I wanted to cook ourselves, but she refused to.\nIt was frustrating.",UNK
10336,"I got the Joey bag of donuts burrito with chicken.  It was OK.  Smaller in size compared to Chipotle, and the favor just did not do it for me.  The free chips that come with the meal were GOOD!!!  Chipotle still captures my heart.",UNK
10337,"DAMN. this show is GREAT.\nyes, the tickets are expensive, but well worth the price.\neverything is spectacular about the show. i think every seat in the theater is a good seat.\nacrobatics and stunning visuals complete this show.",UNK
10338,"The food is great. The atmosphere is very comforting. The wait staff is always friendly.\n\nBe sure to try the Bennet Burger (it's not on the menu anymore, but they can still make it).",UNK
10339,"I searched for a long time to find a barber that could cut hair the way I want it. About 2 years ago a guy I work with told me about Andy at Lynn's and he has been cutting my hair ever since. Excellent haicut and good conversation, reasonable price. Highly recommended.",UNK
10340,"So many better places on Spring Mountain.  One dish tastes likes the next at this joint.  The \""white\"" chicken is anything but.  Cathay was once one of the best in town.  Not any more.  As they say, \""no more business from me to you!\""",UNK
10341,"Went there last night ad had a great time. Did some slots, people watching and even saw some friends there.  A good time was had by all.",UNK
10342,The food was very fresh and tasty. We ordered salads (chicken and Ni\u00e7oise ) from the lunch menu. For desert we took caramelized apple and cappuccino. Well it was nice though I was not trilled :-). Overall service and food were excellent.,UNK
10343,"Meh. Is about the perfect way to describe this place. First, it's too expensive (I know it's Vegas, on the Strip, but improve quality if you're going to have such high cost). Food was okay at best. With so many other places at all different price ranges no need to eat at this one.",UNK
10344,Don't be fooled!  This place serves awesome food and drinks!  I'm very picky and was pleasantly surprised.  I definitely will be going back.,UNK
10345,"Having lived in NYC for a few years, I know a little something about pizza.  I was so thrilled to see grimaldi's open in vegas.  It usually is the only reason why I would cross town to the eastside.  But now they have a summerlin location so it's easier to get my fav pizza in town.",UNK
10346,Had a great pizza and a folded pizza sandwich Chef Marc was playing with today for lunch.  Everything was delicious and the staff were all friendly.  I'm excited to go back soon.,UNK
10347,This is the location closest to my house. Never had any issues. Service is always quick and friendly and in my opinion one of the best cheesesteak you will find in town. Haven't tried the other sandwiches.,UNK
10348,"I love Harrah's for the mass-roulette table.  Aside from that, it's your average hotel on the Strip.",UNK
10349,"Great coffee, fun atmosphere, and the staff were super friendly. We stopped here on our way to an event around the corner, and it was great. Their specialty is the dirty chai (chai tea w/1, 2, or 3 shots of espresso). We really liked it.",UNK
10350,"Bad service, expensive food. There are other  Venezuelan places in the city that showcase the typical flavours on a better way and at a right price. Again, service was awful.",UNK
10351,"Owner Paula, contacted me and said she would send me a gift certificate to come back or give to a friend, but I never received it and have not heard from her since. It is well over 1/2 a year now.",UNK
10352,"Big portions, good flavor, great prompt service, great price.  Pancakes  than IHOP, waffles better than Waffle House, French toast better than...making it yourself.  Will be back.",UNK
10353,"They collected over $50M in donations last year, spent 25% of expenses, gave $1.6M to US cancer patients, and sent $39M overseas to various offshore accounts in the form of \""medical supplies\"".   They've been doing this for 5 years.   Shameful!",UNK
10354,"I love their eyeliner the best, I don't wear much make up as is ... When I do wear it I always buy mac eyeliner",UNK
10355,get the extra shot!!!! I love this place play some pennies get lots of drinks the best place to start your downtown adventure!,UNK
10356,"Do not fall for the \""free show ticket\"" its an intro for hidden upgrade fees they only talk about when you go to the show! Bbbboooooo",UNK
10357,"this was not yummy or freshish or really ok. but if you insist on a california roll and happen to be trapped in the illini union at the time, how bad could it be?",UNK
10358,Live down the street and love great Cajun food. They serve authentic plates. We have had the gumbo and \u00e9touff\u00e9e. Both are incredible! Prices are reasonable and worth the quality. Definitely recommended.,UNK
10359,The worst pad Thai noodles ever! It is not suppose to taste sweet.  I had plaque build up immediately on my teeth.  Worst than eating a bag of candy.,UNK
10360,"We had rib tips, fried okra, chicken, brisket, smoked artichoke and it was all soooo good.  The sweet tea was excellent too. Good portion size, excellent service from Ashley, glad we beat the crowd.",UNK
10361,This is no longer the dog wash its called alicias dog wash. They are 20 for self wash which is ridiculous in itself. They dont keep it clean and they dont have the best shampoos.  I believe i spoke to the owner because she was very rude and defensive.,UNK
10362,"FANTASTIC value menu! 1.50 regular hot dogs, cot dogs, pop, and tiny bag of popcorn! I love this place. It makes coming to a game affordable. So affordable I can see 15+ games a year:) thank you double headers & diamondback organization",UNK
10363,"Did the trick as far as airport food goes... I grabbed a small pizza and a drink, gobbled it all down, then caught my flight. No complaints. \n\nBOTTOM LINE: One of the few choices out here in E-terminal. Good for a quick slice of pizza.",UNK
10364,"Go to the one in Hollywood...\n\nThis one is not even close to taste and old school-ness.\nOur food tasted old and stale.\nNo crush sodas in the old school bottles.\n\nPositives include no 2-hour wait, and much cleaner.",UNK
10365,Big clean well groomed park.  Some rude dog owners don't pick up after their animals but otherwise a great addition to the feel and ever-growing charm of downtown.,UNK
10366,"YUM!  Another great outing.  Terrific fish, great sushi, sashimi, and rolls.  Can't wait to get back here.  TREMENDOUS value for the $.",UNK
10367,"Limited decent buffet menu, but the taste is good, esp., when compared to other north indian food located of the strip",UNK
10368,"Un petit resto sympathique pour d\u00eener, souper ou tout simplement prendre un verre entre amis!",UNK
10369,For the price they add way too much rice to your sushi with little fish. Staff is so wonderful though. But doesn't make up for the food. I regret going here with my family.,UNK
10370,"Family and I tried this restaurant for the first time! It was nearby and decided to try. Comforting atmosphere, great server(PETER) plus he also ordered for us since we didn't know what to try first. Great sushi! I am definitely going back!",UNK
10371,Fits the bbq needs but is not worth the prices for a family. $2.50 for a non-refillable soda when the food is on the overpriced side was a little much. We'll stick to coming here on out birthday when you get $10 off. That makes it about right.,UNK
10372,I think I've watched something in each theatre here. Nice place. \n\nI can't believe how nobody complains of the price of snacks. You'd think if everyone who goes to movie theatres complains about $8 popcorn would result in affordable popcorn.,UNK
10373,Eggs were yummy with hash browns. Waffles were average.. Great and speedy service too!!! Very friendly waitresses. Satisfied!,UNK
10374,"First time visiting this mall and it definitely has a good spread of shopping and food. We weren't on a mission to purchase anything so we were just walking around but it was clean, bright and buzzing with activity.",UNK
10375,Free Breakfast!!! Yeah it is hard to beat that but it's still a dive bar. Pretty dark inside. Let's just say it's the perfect place on a Saturday morning if you want the hair of the dog that bit you.,UNK
10376,"Worst mistake of my life. I'd give it 0 stars if I could. These are the worst \""students\"" ever. I'm sure I'd be more comfortable having a monkey work on my teeth.",UNK
10377,"This is just an elegant mall.  I like how it looks, and everything seems to be spaced properly.  It's a clean mall unlike many others I've seen.  There are a good amount of stores, and it kind of reminds me of the Fashion Show Mall in Las Vegas in a way, but it definitely has its own unique look.",UNK
10378,"I come here all the time for their subs. They slice the deli meat in front of you and use fresh toppings. They offer a huge selection of baked goods, none which have disappointed me yet.",UNK
10379,"This was some of the best Thai food I've had and I've been to Thailand. On the outskirts of Vegas, it was refreshing to find a vegetarian restaurant (they also have meat). If you are looking for authentic, delicious Thai food that is reasonably priced, eat here!",UNK
10380,The service here is disgusting! Spent over an hour waiting for my food. Just to find out the cashier never placed my order to the cooks! All they did for me was give me a cheap apology. I will never come back!,UNK
10381,"Sorry, this place doesn't get it. I went two years ago and it was ok but this week it was C- at best. The catfish was greasy and the oysters were soggy. Must have changed hands recently.",UNK
10382,"Tana has been a blessing in my life. I have been seeing her for over 4 years off and on now. When ever I need her, she is there to give me positive support and a lifetime of wisdom I can use to get me through the rough times. I appreciate her and definitely recommend choosing Tana as your Life Coach :) No doubt",UNK
10383,Only one complaint about the management being rude to his employees.  There is a time and place and neither are infront of customers.  Other than that all is well!!  Food is good and makes me HAPPY!!,UNK
10384,Delish!  I've been here a few times and my favorite dish I've had was huge tasty scallops with polenta and mushrooms!  Divine!  \n\nAmazing ice tea.  Gorgeous restaurant.  Smells terrific inside!,UNK
10385,"Got the assorted pastry basket. Fantastic. The berry fruit salad, also good. This place is solid on baked goods.\n\nTip: they don't take reservations, but you CAN call and get an idea on the current wait before trekking out there.",UNK
10386,"This place is fucking garbage and should be condemned. First room I got was fucking filthy, internet drops in and out and the dumb motherfucker at the front desk is NO help.",UNK
10387,Me and my wife ordered Wor Wonton Soup. It was delicious! Our new favorite. Cream puffs also were excellent. Some reviews stating that the food is bland but we thought it is better than being salty. Little bit of soy sauce can get the taste to your liking. Place is nice and quiet. Excellent service!,UNK
10388,Good atmosphere and good food.  The garlic fries are very good and the falafel is solid.  The Mill location is fun as is the location in Chandler.,UNK
10389,"Cupcakes are alright, not a lot of selection. Staff is incredibly rude and unprofessional I literally walked out of shop due to the rude sales girl.",UNK
10390,"Great local spot for a meal with the family. Get the steak dinner, it's a affordable and delicious! Great because they separate the dining room from the bar area.",UNK
10391,"I LOVE this place! We've been to both the Chandler location and the Anaheim, CA location. Every single thing on the menu is incredible!! Can't wait to go again and try something new - you literally can't go wrong with any choice! Highly recommend this place to anyone who hasn't been here!",UNK
10392,"Expensive and plain, just paid 8 dollars for a protein shake, watched the girl make it wrong, and then when I said it was missing an ingredient they said \""nope\"".. Took one taste and chucked it in the trash. Have been here several times before, it gets worse and worse, never going back.",UNK
10393,I loved the bread..amazing..I loved the ribeye..parm truffle fries..tuna tartare. .and cheesecake lollipops,UNK
10394,Standing room on the side balconies was waaaaaay over packed. We paid big bucks to see Muse and could barely see them at times. They really over sold this show.,UNK
10395,please avoid this place. Rude and unfriendly hair dressers. They need to learn and take classes on how to welcome customers. As long as the two ladies who were there the day I took a visit still employed there I will not go back. May 7 2012,UNK
10396,My husband and I love our sushi and just moved to Vegas. We've eaten at 3 sushi spots and so far this is our favorite. Fish is always fresh. The uni tastes like it just came out of the water. Price is very reasonable. I recommend eating here.,UNK
10397,"Always good service and the food is tasty. Drinks are likewise very good. They have gluten free items which is a plus. The atmosphere is festive and a mixture of families, date nights, and parties. It's one one of the better places in north Scottsdale.",UNK
10398,They have the BEST pizza in Vegas !! The Margherita DOC is the best .... never fails !! Oh and by the way ... if one of the weekly specials on the board looks good ... GET IT .... they only serve them once a year :-),UNK
10399,Omg... Delivered the wrong order 3 times.... How can you be this off... Bill was wrong......do yourself a favor and stay away....,UNK
10400,"Tasty tacos in a slightly too-cute interior.  While the tacos were tasty (I tried three of the meat variety), I thought the rice and beans were a little bland.\r\n\r\nI'll head back but if I'm craving Mexican, there are better options.",UNK
10401,"Good food, nice waitress, and CHEAP - meal would cost twice as much in California. Next time we're in Phoenix we'll be here.",UNK
10402,Terrible. Dirty airline. Charges ridicules fees for carry-on's.\nThe upgraded service is expensive and not worth the cost.\n\nPlease fly another airline. Jet Blue is a better service.,UNK
10403,"I do love the architecture and interior design, but idk, it's kinda dark and depressing, and not up to date with alot of stuff. My room was kinda crappy and did not have a flat screen like in the picture. Also the pool is less than mediocre.",UNK
10404,"This was my first time here, and I cannot wait to come back! What a unique experience, made even better by Underground Food's cured meats and Nessalla Kombucha. YUM. One pizza that really stuck out to me was a pie that had smoked trout and summer squash. Beautiful!!",UNK
10405,This placed is designed for the people that demand perfection.  I have stayed here once before but I myself am a little too dirty to enjoy the high class atmosphere this establishment provides.,UNK
10406,"Service was friendly but slow, like bumped her head too hard slow... too many errors for such a small breakfast order.  Food was okay.",UNK
10407,Went here when we got in town. Everything was old or frozen or just not fresh I was told good food it so wasnt. Waitress was rude had no sense of customer service we were pretty much abandoned worst service and wasnt even busy.,UNK
10408,To-go pork products are good - but spendy. Dont go for lunch/dinner. Heat lamp burritos with a bit extra. It's like a butcher shop that only has pork.,UNK
10409,Terrible sound. Terrible lighting. Screens cut out half way through the encore but that really didn't bother me bc it was bad quality anyway.\nGood job on making a Yeah Yeah Yeahs show suck.,UNK
10410,I had a very bad experience trying to enjoy our food but cannot cuz their services suck .. It's a very loud buffet and over price,UNK
10411,"Hubby and I went to celebrate our anniversary and the worse service and seafood.  They served crab legs ice cold.  My halibut was so-so.  Waiter was handing us bread, etc. over a wall.  Never again.",UNK
10412,I know you should not except so much from this establishment but even with lowered standards I very disappointed. Service was slow and I was unable to decider if it was laziness or ignorance on the part of the staff,UNK
10413,"Fantastic and fresh every time I dine here.  The sushi is always fresh and the Asian dishes are, too.  Can't go wrong here.",UNK
10414,"This place blows. It is a plague upon the earth. Overpriced, bad food, and we waited over an hour to get our food on a Friday afternoon. I fervently pray that the Fates do not have another trip here in store for me. Once per lifetime is too much.",UNK
10415,I normally order the Crepes here when I am in Vegas.  This location is a lot less crowded than other location in Bellagio.  It's cool to see the decorations that he made at each location.  But you really can't go wrong with the crepe here.  It always made perfectly.,UNK
10416,Didn't understand I wanted the lunch special and not the lunch plate. Mostly vegetables in the Kungpow chicken. Place is run down. Large portions.,UNK
10417,Dropped in for bike week. I think it was a bit pricy to get in just to walk around and see vendors & buy stuff. But I guess they really need to rake in a crap load of $$$ to compete with the oil companies,UNK
10418,"One of the better places for all you can eat. Quality is good considering price. Rolls are not as crazy as I like, but the price is right.",UNK
10419,"If I ever have enough disposal income that I feel the desire to spend $5 on a 6oz container of raspberries, I know that Whole Foods can help me achieve that goal. In the meantime I'll continue to shop at Trader Joe's.",UNK
10420,It was my second time here and I love this place came in for lunch extremely busy the manager with red hair had time to help us with our selection and was great!! She was all over the place helping everybody with a smile thanks for the experience\nTanya,UNK
10421,"I downloaded yelp specifically for this place. It is bad. I could go into a deep explanation of exactly how bad it is but I think I'll save us both time and say...don't go there, pal. Giving her the ol 1 star. Over and out, barnstein",UNK
10422,Good food. Prices are a little high and the restaurant does not smell like the meat is smoked onsite. They have pretty limited hours. The people are very friendly !,UNK
10423,It was ok. Pulled pork was barley warm. BBQ sauce was cold and made the pork cold. The bottles of sauce are big and slippery do to being in the refrigerator. Really a pain to get the sauce out. Probably will not go back.  Price was good for BBQ.,UNK
10424,A nice tribute to a great band! The show was fun and cleverly done with songs. Try to sit closer to the front for the full experience. Discount tickets available so search before paying full price.,UNK
10425,"Service is to die for! Ambiance not so much. Floor molding and walls were dirty. Its filet mignon is very basic and if you expect flavor its not for you. Lastly, theyre white truffle chips and bbq shrimp appetizers are worth the price tag. I probably wont go back.",UNK
10426,"We were in town from California and this Chilis was near our hotel. It was late and we wanted to grab a drink. The Bartender was super friendly, she had several customers but she made us feel as if we were the only ones.  If I remember right, her name was Bree. We will definitely return next time we are in town.",UNK
10427,"I love Jersey Mikes! I usually get the Italian sub, and it's amazing! I also got the Philly Cheesesteak and it was the sooooo good! They are friendly whenever I go in. I do think it's a little pricey, but way better quality than Subway.",UNK
10428,Got the chicken enchiladas and they were mushy and gross.  We also had the brunch tapas which were OK.  The whole in the wall Mexican joints I go to are ten times better than this place.  Not coming back.,UNK
10429,"Best subs, period! Although it is almost always busy (even when I go at night), it is worth the wait. Affordable and fast service as well!",UNK
10430,"Big disappointment. Spring rolls were pasty and salty, not crispy. My friend's ginger chicken was soaking in soy sauce, she returned it and the replacement was no better.",UNK
10431,"My family and I came here a few years ago ( I know, late review! ). It was a very awesome Cirque.\n\nMy brother had college discounts, so he hooked it up and we saved $30 per ticket in our family. Wouldn't mind watching it again if given the opportunity.",UNK
10432,"We checked out the casino, we didn't stay here so I don't know about the rooms. All in all its typical but with all the rock n roll memorabilia,  which is cool.",UNK
10433,"Best Vet ever!  No nonsense! No trumped up charges. Tells ya like it is. Awesome disposition. Genuine, sincere, considerate, caring personable demeanor.",UNK
10434,"well they've got the fishbowl... that is pretty awesome.  The rest isn't the best.  A bunch of people looking to get some.  Its three floors which is unique but because there's so many people its just crowded getting around the stairs.  The drinks are cheap which is another plus, but just not it for me.",UNK
10435,Love the original in NYC and love the Vegas duplicate... Highly recommend the stuffed clams appetizer and the meatballs. Broad and reasonable wine list. Food is always awesome. Very pretty and romantic interior decor. Highly recommend!,UNK
10436,"...just finished. Wow. Service was great, good was amazing ...I could go for another round. The roll with the Kobe beef on top. Get that one.",UNK
10437,Bought my R6 in march of 2010. Best service and still receiving discounts on gear. Manager is awesome and made my life a little happier by selling me my Yamaha.,UNK
10438,"Their food is awesome but I stopped eating here after I found a long black hair baked into my pizza. I took a picture of it, showed it to the manager my last visit there, and he apologized by giving me a 3$ off coupon. I will never eat here again. Fatburger is a lot cleaner.",UNK
10439,I was kinda disappointed.  I think my expectations were too high based on other reviews and now I'm still searching for a go to Chinese place... For now its Dragon Bowl Inn..,UNK
10440,Very yummy FRESH AND CLEAN! Very friendly and prompt waitstaff and there's a candy place next door!!! Love this place! This will be my spot for Mexican food!,UNK
10441,"I think my husband and I were looking for the seafood buffet and was mixed up. Food was good, but we were hoping for the seafood buffet.",UNK
10442,"Not great at all. Service is horrible. It was slow when my husband and I went, still service was slow as well. Only had a appetizer then went next door to Sandbar where I know I get good service each time.",UNK
10443,"Love the food.  Ceviche, yoshi roll, and their roll with no rice that is wrapped with cucumber are out of this world.  Many other things I want to try on the menu, so will be back for sure",UNK
10444,We bought one of the 9 stage systems and love that it balances the PH of the RO water. The prices are the best we could find for high quality equipment. It's also nice that it's made in the U.S. instead of China.,UNK
10445,Can't comment on the food.  After 20 minutes and no server we left. Too bad my wife and I enjoying new dishes.  Not recommended!,UNK
10446,Over the past 6 months my wife and I have tried just about every dish on the menu and we've liked them all! It's great having a restaurant like this in Henderson. We usually start with papas a la huancaina and go from there!,UNK
10447,"My husband and I came here on .30 cent scoop night. The wait line wasn't horrible, there were a bunch of people waiting but the line was moving pretty fast. I ordered the strawberry cheesecake which was BOMB!",UNK
10448,"Went there the other day for lunch and was really surprised at the quality of the food and reasonable prices.. I had a cobb salad that was excellent and my friend had a burrito that he really enjoyed. If you are looking for something fast, reasonable, and good food, I would highly recommend this. !",UNK
10449,I've been to Dr. Waring now twice.  He is an outstanding physician!  The Doctor and his staff are very professional and nice.  I have high anxiety every time I go to Dentists and Doctors and these people make me feel very comfortable.  His office and facilities are very nice and modern.,UNK
10450,"Typical copy cat Hawaiian food with similar menu of L&L but terrible greasy food and customer service. Save your good money and good stomach space for better food elsewhere. Still want HI food nearby, try L&L at Flamingo m Maryland.",UNK
10451,Janessa Is really details oriented I like how took care of very nail with love ! I love that she didn't file of the actual nail so my nail can keep growing healthyshe tooks her time and I can feel she like what she does. I highly recommend it for anyone who want a professional personalize service!Will be back ;),UNK
10452,"Been coming and staying here since 2002. We live here now and enjoy staying at the hotel. Me and my kids booked a junior suite and as always, are enjoying our time together here. So many choices for food not to mention Starbucks is onsite as well. Love it here.",UNK
10453,Have tried ordering from here again and have achieved the same results....cold food...over an hour wait.  I really want to like this place but the service is just too lousy to be forgivable.,UNK
10454,"Wasn't really for me. \n\nThe food wasn't bad, I just didn't really enjoy it. It was bland and I'm not a fan of meat and noodles in water. \n\nI probably wouldn't choose to come back here.",UNK
10455,"fantastic! loved everything about it...especially the fact that the guy taking tickets upgraded our seats from the upper mezzanine to orchestra.  highly recommend seeing this show, it was the highlight of our trip.",UNK
10456,"Was ere today for Brunch with my girlfriend. The food was very good, ad the price was very reasonable. \n\nIf I had one thing to say would be I waited quite a while for my bill after the table was cleared a good 10 minutes. Excusable because the food was delicious.",UNK
10457,"Good breakfast and lunch choices. I love the eggs benedict and they have many varieties of it.  Also if you order an ice tea or soda, its unlimited refills and you can even ask for a to-go cup, which I think is awesome!",UNK
10458,I hurt my neck yesterday and couldn't move at all. Instead of just sitting at home and waiting to get better I went and got checked out by Dr.Troy. When I left there I was feeling 100% better and was able to go back to work. Thanks Dr Troy!!,UNK
10459,Awesome bakery.  Everything i have tried has been fantastic.  I even take things out of state when I visit family because it is so good.  I would recommend anything with marzipan as it is very flavor full.,UNK
10460,Excellent happy hour menu! Free Miso Soup with check in. The salmon nigiri sushi off the happy hour menu was soooo melt in your mouth! Reasonable prices and quick service.,UNK
10461,If you are vegan or vegetarian and you have not ate here yet stop reading this and go! This is one of my Favorite vegan Friendly restaurant i love the Rainbow Chicken Chunk i know it sounds really gross but it's to die for.,UNK
10462,"Slow, slow, service. Did I mention it's slow? The food was fine, but not worth waiting 30 minutes for it. Go somewhere else if you have a hankering for Mexican and anywhere to be soon.",UNK
10463,"Great bar/lounge!  Cozy atmosphere with candles and fireplaces, friendly staff, good-looking but chill crowd, and good drinks at reasonable prices.",UNK
10464,We usually enjoy the food but hard to get into the price structure. They often have coupons to lessen the blow. First time we went packed lately was dead in there.,UNK
10465,"An interesting bit of history.  My curiosity about this landmark was finally satisfied as I became a Master Gardener and volunteered with classmates to help Jason replant the garden.    The rehabilitation of the house is underway, but the tour of the gardens is definitely worth the trip.",UNK
10466,We had a lovely meal after a long day of site seeing.  The food is tasty and the service was good. My husband had the mushroom Gorgonzola  soup special that was delicious.  All our entrees were well prepared and very good.  The atmosphere is fine - but not trendy.,UNK
10467,"Lately I've been doing a lot of business in Madison and this has become my home away from home.  Property is new and it lives comfortably for a good rate.  Great view if you get an even numbered room.  Be sure to ask for that.  Also, a very very short drive from great shops and restaurants in the East Madison area.",UNK
10468,"Rented a fat tire bike from staff recommendation for the local area. Bike was a blast, They charged me only for a day and a half when they could have charged me two. Staff was friendly and helpful. Breakfast sandwiches and fresh squeezed OJ was great too. Will definitely revisit on my next trip.",UNK
10469,"Lovely accommodations in the casitas. Nice living room, patio, private plunge pool, outdoor shower. We were traveling with a small dog and it was very comfortable.  Room service breakfast was great!",UNK
10470,I walked in and was seated right away.  The people are nice and my mani/pedi turned out well.  They are a little on the expensive side however I would recommend them to friends.,UNK
10471,"The food is pricey but good, that's why I would recommend stopping in for the early early happy hour specials and then grab a late dinner elsewhere else. The service was good and the bar was casual.  I will go back.",UNK

10473,"I think their pasteries used to taste better before , wish if they let you buy smaller pies or a piece instead of the whole thing",UNK
10474,Sad to say we will not be eating here as often due to the fact they stopped buying sour cream wtf?! Food has always been great and sour cream may not be that much of a deal breaker to some people but I don't enjoy breakfast with out it :(,UNK
10475,I have seen all the Vegas shows and this one is the best.  If you do not like sex or swearing then don't go.  The funniest and up close show in Vegas.,UNK

10477,"My wife and I had an appointment at a specific time and we were running behind. We decided to try and find someplace to eat breakfast and after using Yelp, we stumbled across this place.  The food was amazing, the service was exceptionally fast and friendly.  We will be back!  Biscuits and gravy were off the hook!",UNK
10478,"Descent sushi for Scottsadale.  No brown rice option was odd considering the recent health movement away from white breads, rice etc.  Very friendly staff.",UNK
10479,"Used to be a great place with fish tank inside, now it gets worse.\nDoesn't matter what I order.\nMy stomach can't handle it and ruin my fun in Las Vegas.  \nThere are resturants in San Jose and Los Angles are better than this.",UNK
10480,"this place sucks! everywhere you go has the smell of cigarette smoke, even in your room! the ceiling was leaking water, ventilation was crap, floors in the room were stained and nasty, and it's a damn maze just to find your room.",UNK
10481,Culinary sin.  You dont put uncooked garlic on a plate\n  Fries tasted good but the uncooked garlic was unacceptable.   Had kobe beef burger.  It was under seasoned proportionally to the over seasoned fries.  Really im biening nit picky would eat again but would request some changes with the chef,UNK
10482,Love the garlic shrimp & thai tea w/ boba. However the cashiers should STOP answering the phone while they take your order. This happened 3x...,UNK
10483,Went there only for dessert and had to pay a mandatory $2 per person filtered water fee. We shared a waffle banana split with one extra scoop of ice cream and our bill was $25. It was pretty good but way overpriced which is the reason for the 2 stars especially when service was mediocre at best.,UNK
10484,"Been here twice now and I can say with extreme confidence that these are the greatest Tortas in Arizona, if not, the entire southwest! Life-changing food !!",UNK
10485,"As far as campus bars go, this is as good as it gets. A great place to gather with a small group of friends and drink some beer.",UNK
10486,"Be warned, this is the second time I've had thai me up and its just okay. The food is not spicy at all and I ordered an 8. In addition, the food is overly priced. With so many places to eat nearby, spend your money elsewhere.",UNK
10487,Honey Bears BBQ is definitely worth checking out. What they lack in variety and options is made up in quality. The ribs were nice and the pork sandwich was tender. Unfortunately I will chose elsewhere next time for more options and a little more meat on the bones. Overall the food was good but nothing wow'd me.,UNK
10488,"These guys are always on point. Cheese steak FTW every time. Best cheese I've had in Phoenix, so far...",UNK
10489,"I love this place. You can get anything here! Gifts, food, and a large selection of beers and wines. I never get what I came for and leave because there's always a great deal or item you don't think you can live without.",UNK
10490,Turns out the bug infested part was BED BUGS by the way!  Yes that's right BED BUGS!,UNK
10491,"Pbr on tap, best cheesesteak in scottsdale and the pizza is good too.  If you are nearby go there, drink a beer, eat a cheesesteak and some fried mushrooms your stomach will thank you. This place rules!",UNK
10492,"Anything BUT Tex-Mex!  Great Mexican dishes served as you never had them, with great Panache.  Great food served in a marvelous decor, hardly old Mexico.  Should not even be called a Cantina.",UNK

10495,"I was starving and went Pei Wei - it was lame, here's why:\nSLOW cooking (this could mean it was fresher, though)\nNOT TASTY :( \nBig portions were good, though!",UNK
10496,"It's ok, it needs more fresh produce somewhere in the market. there are nice vendors there, but it needs more market types.",UNK
10497,"Give it a 4 star solid stuff, second or third best in town.  Best in sw.\nMmmmmm.  Mmmmm good.",UNK
10498,"I actually love everything about this place except one critical problem. The buns are probably the worst buns I know of anywhere. They are horrible, and they fall apart. I took the time to write the company, no response. I can walk there, love everything else, but cant go for a burger. sad",UNK
10499,"A very so-so buffet.  Disappointed that food looked prettty shabby.  Service was excellent; it was the food that let me down.  I saw some mussels, clams and one fish dish as far as seafood was concerned.",UNK
10500,"It's ok.  I think they survive more on presentation, big portions, and name recognition than actual taste of food.  There are a bunch of better breakfast/brunch options in Vegas in my experience.",UNK
10501,"Heads up! Get to this place early if you want to eat there special.\n\n5 stars for great tasting food, minus 2 for and an unfriendly hostess.",UNK
10502,I went into the boulevard salon cause I read of the great reviews it received! I was booked with Jorge! He did an amazing job coloring and styling my hair!!! The staff was very warm and friendly!!! I highly recommend him to anyone who needs their hair done cause he did an amazing job with mine!,UNK
10503,I used to work there and quit because there so unsanitary they smoke while prepping the kitchen the mix fresh lettuce with gross older lettuce to save money this place may make you sick avoid the lettuce and cheese.  Wings are okay they tend to over cook them.,UNK
10504,Scaled down version of rainforest cafe! Water show was lame. Food was less than average.\nWish we could have sat at the bar...Looked fun but it was full. Would not go back just for the bar! \nOnly pro was that we did not have any problems with the service and waiter was pleasant.,UNK
10505,Awesome. The place is well kept and I can't wait to go their again. The prices are good and the service is excellent! Highly recommend!,UNK
10506,I went to Binion's the other day to eat with my family. I had not been there in years. Like 20 years. It seemed like half of the casino was shut down. There were a bunch of cheap shirts for sale in the back lobby. It was kind of sad. It did not look like Binion's is doing well.,UNK

10510,Excellent fish tacos! Arguably the best I have found in Phoenix. The atmosphere leaves a bit to be desired which is why only four stars. It's very quiet and very slow paced (not the service)  since its tucked back in the museum district of Old Town. Other than that everything was excellent!,UNK
10511,Good place....I ordered the pizza as my friend order the wings. The price was reasonable with a lot of food. The staff is great....so funny and approachable.,UNK
10512,"Great! Love the Pho Soup. I was a little sad it was not vegetarian, but otherwise it is great food and friendly staff.",UNK
10513,"The casino floor smells weirdly of cheap car air fresheners.  But once you get used to it, it covers the smell of old people pretty well.\n\nEven the staff seemed peri-menopausal.  But whatever, it's a chilled out place to play if you're cool with that.",UNK
10514,Every meal I have had from here is great.  Even when I am not in the mood for a big meal.  Their side dishes are plenty yummy.  I am a fan of their potato salad.,UNK
10515,"Very professional, kind and passionate staff. The burgers however are just not my taste. Thin, well done and free of any juices.",UNK
10516,Food is tasty and the drinks are outstanding. Try the prickly pear margarita. Service is generally poor and keeps me from becoming more of a regular.,UNK
10517,"Great affordable breakfast. I went here the other morning with my family. We was seated quickly can the service was great. The only thing I have to complain abut was the desert menu that was on the table was extremely sticky. I would defiantly return, great spot right off the strip.",UNK
10518,"Tons of fist pumping guidos, overpriced weak drinks and the pool was full of warm piss water. Enjoy!",UNK
10519,Cool place...great show...funny as hell. The downside is they let in any geek off the street who can pay for a ticket. That being said you get a bunch of drunk douchers that don't know when to keep their mouth shut!,UNK
10520,"I have died and (literally) gone to hog heaven. Great food (ribs, brisket, sausage, sides, etc). Quick service & Eric the manager  very helpful with us newbies.",UNK
10521,"Havnt dined at this location in over a year, so my 19 yr old took her parents. I had the ultimate feast lobster,  crab legs and schrimp scampi and fried schrimp.  Meal was really good cooked to perfection.",UNK
10522,"If by burrito you mean a large corn tortilla taco then I guess some burritos are not created equally. Terrible and bland taste, nothing like what I expected. I probably should have read some reviews before ordering. Everything including salsa costs extra... I literally walked out without eating.",UNK
10523,The myth of the farther away from the bar the worse the service has been broken! Jesse is the best server that has walked into this place!,UNK
10524,This place is definitely not one of my favorites.  I have visited on various occasions and it seems as if I eat less and less with each visit.  There is definitely nothing extraordinary about this buffet.  I would probably prefer to visit the casinos food court instead.,UNK
10525,This is a filthy place.  Several times I saw cockroaches crawling around.  The service is terrible.  Only thing I like is their barbecue items.  Now I don't even go there because Mekong has better barbecue.,UNK
10526,"I love how this place is \""hidden\"". How fun!\n\nThe white pizza is amazing and great for a quick snack or meal. Not a bad attempt at a New York Slice!",UNK
10527,"I took my parents here because it's one of their favorite places, but I wasn't that impressed.  The service was impeccable, but the food - not much different than Outback or Texas Roadhouse.",UNK
10528,Service was ok but Philly cheese sandwhich was not great.  Mom pare the senior discounted menu to the other menu and not much difference in price and you get less food. At least on the breakfast menu that's the way it was.,UNK
10529,Good food and good service. I am glad to live somewhere with good Thai food options again.  Warning the spice is on the mild side I asked for 5 the spiciest and barely tasted the heat...,UNK
10530,Waited over 30 minutes to be seated. Ordered steaks. Not very good. Tough and chewy. Salad and bread were the best part of the meal. Will not be back.,UNK
10531,"We have been here a couple times food is usually ok, on our last visit we found 2 hairs in our food, one in the rice and one in our sag chicken... we will not be going back. I would not recommend.",UNK
10532,"Love this place.  Accepted all sort of Groupons, smoothie and juice, unless other locations where they only accept one or the other.  Fast and accurate service too, great place to get a healthy drink on the go.",UNK
10533,Not enough buses running that we have to wait in line for 30 minutes !!!\nStupid !!\nStupid !!Stupid !!\nStupid !!,UNK
10534,"Best Sicilian pizza in Phoenix.  \nFrom a Brooklyn native\nRegular pie is good too\nNot a fancy restaurant, but the place is the real deal.",UNK
10535,"Happy hour with my girls, drinking $5 a glass wine and eating their red pepper hummus...delish.  \nThis place is quite far, but I was extremely impressed with the site.  Very elegant yet not snobby (like Scottsdale).  Food was very, very tasty.",UNK
10536,"Customer service here is the worst!  Don't even bother ordering ahead of time because they won't have your order, or any record of your order.. Although I really like the food here, I won't be back.  2 strikes is all it takes for me,",UNK
10537,I haven't had any of the issues with this location that previous reviewers have had. My drinks have consistently been made correctly and they have great customer service. I bring my dog here (thank you drive-thru) and they always fawn over him which makes me a proud puppy parent :) Will return!,UNK
10538,I understand retail sucks but it retail. Do not give my wife and I attuitde because you are tired. Do work retail then.,UNK
10539,"I like this place, it has a nice setting and a great vibe. We went there on a Friday and they had a great blues band and the place had a lot of energy. They have a couple tasty beers on tap, my only complaint would be slow service.",UNK
10540,We went for an extended weekend and had a great time!  The staff was awesome (very helpful).  Easy access to the tram which made it nice getting around.,UNK
10541,"Great stadium to watch a game. Went to camp to see practice, ordered a hot dog which took almost 15 minutes! What would happen if there were 60,000 people? The concessions are the worst I have experienced - MICHAEL BIDWELL listen to your fans, big fix needed",UNK
10542,The customer service didnt live up to the reviews I read on here.  They just waived me off and didnt really help me at all.,UNK
10543,This is the best pita I have ever had!\n\nThe staff is friendly and the food is delicious.  \n\nWish I could eat there every day.,UNK
10544,"An employee at this location stole an iPad from our friends car, and they will not come clean. Valuables policy or not, this was brazen, desperate and wrong. Boycott this location.",UNK
10545,Tom ka coconut soup w flat noodle and the tom yum special w flat noodles are excellent choices. Appetizer- tried the papaya salad. They all rate a spiciness between 1-10. Got a 5 on all and still had a kick to it.,UNK
10546,"Friendly service and quality products. This is not my regular store, but didn't let me down from my high expectations for this chain.",UNK
10547,never been done wrong at this location.  the staff is always friendly and the food is always bomb.  Love me some El Pollo Loco!!  Keep up the good work!!,UNK
10548,The baked ziti was good as was the Green Giant salad.  I spent $120.00 for 10 people to eat from my office and we didn't finish the all the food.  The salad was probably my favorite as the dressing was different but very yummy.  I've heard from other employees say that breakfast is really good.,UNK
10549,This place is a spice wonderland! Whatever you are looking for they are likely to have it. The little kitchen vignettes are so cute and if you sign up for the catalog for this store through out the year they will send you free spice coupons plus there are great recipes provided as well.,UNK
10550,"I enjoyed this intimate little spot. I had a drink names \""Gods Gift\"" and it was delish! The atmosphere is wonderful and I can see myself going here with friends just to chill out and enjoy some laughs. The drinks are affordable for what you get! I've had crappier drinks that were twice as much.",UNK
10551,"Terrible Mexican food..nothing authentic here...their \""Con Queso\"" cheese sauce is disgusting, You can get better nacho cheese from a little league baseball park.",UNK
10552,Melissa takes every customer into perfect consideration when choosing to make a style.  she gets to  know each customer and does the perfect style for them. She is the best.\nShe really can address any hair issue with class and understanding. Her portfolio is amazing.,UNK
10553,I really felt like I was in Vegas when i got off the plane and saw  MANY SLOT MACHINES in the airport!!,UNK
10554,"I wouldnt waste your time or money... It really is just mostly prints, and sculptures... The history, etc. is all stuff  you can read online, etc and get just of good an experience.",UNK
10555,"Arrived at the stated address,  and nothing, only a note saying they're closed and moved. When called their phone number connected to this address,  the message provided this address with operating hours. Not very helpful for out of town people.",UNK
10556,"It's September 26, 2014 and still no resolution. Glad that my fingers still work and that I can do their work myself. DON'T BOTHER WITH THIS COMPANY!",UNK
10557,"I love the atmosphere,  good music and happy hour.  Service not so good. Bartenders slack in customer service. Messy bathrooms with no toilet paper.",UNK
10558,"Really good food, especially if you have ever had Richardson's New Mexican Cuisine.  Not too bad to get seated.  But, overall service was very slow, and below average.",UNK
10559,"It's okay, but that's about it.   I also worry about cleanliness.   When the bathroom is dirty, and it was, I suspect the kitchen is worse.",UNK
10560,"If you want the House of Blues you enjoyed in 2010 or earlier, spare yourself the trip. The restaurant has a new chef who decided the menu should lose the new orleans flare for a more modern American fare (think high dollar Dennys). Totally unimaginative now.",UNK
10561,Just awful. Terrible room. Beat up furniture. Dirty carpet.  Terrible room. Despite being a non smoking room it smelled of cigarettes.  Font desk gave incorrect check in and room change information.  I will never stay here again.,UNK
10562,Yep it's in the hood and no I don't even think twice about shopping here for toys during the Christmas season for 2 simple reasons 1) I don't have to fight for a parking spot and 2) there's hardly ever a crowd.....nuff said and see ya next year!.,UNK
10563,"Service was slow and in attentive. We ordered the Sashimi dinner along with an eel roll, the food was decent but the roll lacked flavor. There are better choices in the area if you're looking for A sushi joint.",UNK
10564,Hell to the No! \nGo the regular hospital or find somewhere else. \nThe staff is incompetent and rude. I was misdiagnosed and had to visit a hospital anyway. \nDon't waste your time here! \nThe billed my insurance incorrect and sent me a bill.,UNK
10565,"This place is horrible. The service is so bad and the beer is inconsistent, at least they had some this time. The food was great but I don't know why it took over an hour to get it. Long story short I will not be returning to this place. Whoever owns this establishment should look for a new line of work.",UNK
10566,Went in here to eat dinner with some friends they said didn't have very much and a menu tonight we have everything we wanted didn't have we asked for this didn't have was okay just make us this didn't have that mean why did even stay open what a joke so we're going somewhere else.,UNK
10567,Holy sweet mother of mercy!  Can't believe how good the food is. Don't skip the soup. So many options are GF. Short stack of pancakes were oh so good and loaded with berries!  Off the strip and a bit hard to find but well worth the journey.,UNK
10568,I went here for my 23rd birthday dinner. I came her for their Kobe burger and it was a good choice. It was soooo yummy! Next time I want to try their drinks in the hug mug :),UNK
10569,"I had one of their sandwiches with a mini  picture of beer for lunch the other day.  The building  and atmosphere are great, however the sandwich (paninni) was mostly bread.  The have a geat wine list, and in the cooler months, the patio looks inviting.",UNK
10570,Had a coupon they sent me via email. They said I couldn't use it for my car cause it not the right oil that my car uses or that they have been putting in won't go here again,UNK
10571,I've been coming to Eastwind since it was Tokyo Express years ago.  I love this place although I never eat the sushi.  I love their miso soup and their teriyaki chicken.  It's always consistently good.  My boyfriend usually gets the bento box which he loves and allows him to sample a variety of different foods at once.,UNK
10572,"Boring sandwich. Period. I fell for the \""hype\"" and while it was filling for $7 bucks, it just did not satisfy a craving...I had the corned beef.",UNK
10573,"New place in Cave Creek, welcome to the neighborhood.   Very good curry and pad thai.   Looking forward to our next visit to try more things on the menu.",UNK
10574,"D*mmit! We went here for breakfast. Was I impressed? No. Cause you can't do wrong on scramble eggs, sausage, bacon, etc. Ahhhh.",UNK
10575,"Best customer service I have experienced in a long time.   From the initial phone call to my service rep Nic was friendly, but most of all helpful to my situation.  I was listened to, Not just sold to. The wait was shorter Than expected and they provided bottled water, popcorn, soda, hot dogs. Excellent!",UNK
10576,Fantastic food!  Cool atmosphere. Seems to be pretty popular. Small place. Great selection. Sauces are fantastic!  Might be some of the best food I have ever had!  Would go here again in a heartbeat!,UNK
10577,"A little pricey, but amazing food and great service.  I reccomend the chicken cuban sandwich. Sit outside, great bartender taking care of you.  Try the mojito with kumquats!",UNK
10578,"\""Food and ambience was great, but staff completely misinformed us about the price of the buffet; it was Way pricier than i thought...bad service\""",UNK
10579,"Our server, Kai was awesome! I'm totally recommending this place to all my friends. Chef paco even came out and introduced himself to us! This place rocks!",UNK
10580,"Great place to get black and gold gear.  Mostly Steelers clothing but lots of Pirates and Penguins paraphernalia, too.  Many discounted items and plenty of small, inexpensive odds and ends.  Friendly staff, good prices.",UNK
10581,"The beer selection leaves a lot to be desired. Also, the playlists need to be updated every now and then. But, the location is killer and service is acceptable. The open seating area in the back is killer!",UNK
10582,Best sides dishes of any of its competition and the chicken ain't half bad either.  They have changed their service to ceramic plates and metal siverware if you eat in.  The chicken has always been good and the sides great for a fast food environment.,UNK
10583,"I don't usually go to the movies, but when I do, all of the theaters are the same... This is also the same... What makes them special?",UNK
10584,"Food was pretty good, service was great, and the atmosphere was alright.  The Wynn Burger did not live up to its name, but who cares.",UNK
10585,"Yumm! Salted carmel yumm, raspberry yumm! 4 dollar creme brulee yummmmmm!",UNK
10586,"This could be a great park...ball fields, playgrounds, picnic areas, walking path, skate park, bathrooms, good parking...but there is dog s**t everywhere. There are ample opportunities for dog owners to be responsible and I'm sure some are but it's hard to tell here.",UNK
10587,"How does a sandwich shop only have one choice of cheese? They are great for when you don't want to leave the office and you can have them just deliver. But for the price, there are way better options in the area. I have tried a few different sandwiches there, and they all kinda taste the same.",UNK
10588,Didn't get to try this place.  I ordered a personal pizza.  My tab was $5.40 (approx) and the owner said cash only or spend $7.00.  I explained I only brought my debit and he just shrugged.  I wont return!,UNK
10589,Decent sushi but not amazing. Rolls are average and fish is fresh for the most part. The sweetheart roll was my favorite item since I love anything with spicy scallop and tempura flakes.,UNK
10590,"Tuna app was amazing, best raw preparation I've had in a long time. \nThe flatbreads are great too. \nI had the tenderloin and it was tender, juicy, and delicious. \nI highly recommend!",UNK
10591,"Wasn't really impressed, the location is great and I got a good deal for the round.  The staff is not all that friendly and a bit disorganized, I was double charged for my round, the course is just average.  I'd play Kierland 100 times over before I played at this place again, course has more personality.",UNK
10592,The surly girl behind the counter acted like we were imposing every time she had to explain that they were out of everything except one option after asking us which option we wanted.just based on service alone I wouldn't ever go back again.,UNK
10593,"Dissatisfied. I heard such great things about this place and low and behold, the food was bland. The egg salad sandwich was eggs and mayo, with no taste at all. The tomato basil soup was horrible, and the \""garlic\"" hummus had less flavor than my glass of water. I would not recommend.",UNK
10594,Slowest service ever. !!! Waited almost an hour for our food during lunch with 7 other tables in restaurant. Not quite sure why but as a GM of another restaurant i would be embarrassed,UNK
10595,"My son and I were their 1st customers of the day and the floors were nasty, with yogurt toppings under the tables that had obviously been there a while. In a place that serves food, cleanliness is everything. While the yogurt is OK, I will not be going back.",UNK
10596,Atmosphere great and fun. \nBreasted chicken and rib dinner = chicken great tasty and juicy.\nRibs tough = these babies will never fall off the bone. \n6 guys went for ribs all agreed. Too bad the ribs are what you come for.,UNK
10597,Had a nice dinner here. I had filet mignon and it was awesome! Very good steak. But my husband had the ribeye and wasn't too impressed with it. But all together we were satisfied!,UNK
10598,Just off the boat from NYC looking for a good bagel saw reviews thought I would give it a try they are ok nothing special about it maybe its the best in the area like I said just off the boat but not worth my 40 min round trip drive will keep looking,UNK
10599,I work in the corporate galleria center so its convenant for me to jst run upstairs and grab something quick. I love there chicken tequila spiked soup and there chef salad. Although it is a bit pricey. All the staff there are friendly.,UNK
10600,"Good local place, pretty decent food, and the best cinnamon rolls ever!  I can't eat any baked goods from super markets (yuck).  I am very picky when it comes to sweets but these hit it out of the ballpark!",UNK
10601,Fab park to burn off all the poutine!!! Lots and lots of stairs to climb but worth it for a memorable view of Montreal.\n\nThey need to improve signage and have trail maps more readily available so women with no sense of direction can avoid getting lost.,UNK
10602,"Patience required! The service and apparently the kitchen moves at an extremely slow pace.  It took about 20 min to be seated, which was completely fine, but took an hour plus some minutes to get our food!! Once the food arrived it wasn't bad, but nothing spectacular. The service was maybe slightly less than okay.",UNK
10603,"So much good food! Large portions (and smaller ones if you're not super starved), delicious bubble tea (which now comes in three levels of sweetness and can be customized to whatever you prefer), and great for all ages! Try the Hong Kong Chow fun beef or the Singapore rice noodles.",UNK
10604,"Terrible meal, terrible waitress. Nothing good to say about this place. Waitress dumped drink in my lap, forgot 1 out of 4 meals. Would never tell anyone about this place.",UNK
10605,"Still one of my favorite sushi restaurants in Arizona! Was super excited to eat it one Monday afternoon, however, and found out they now close on Mondays...literally had us standing in front of the locked door frowning haha So if it's a Monday and you want sushi catcher.... Sad day :(",UNK
10606,"I ordered the flat steak and found it to be tasteless.  The frozen margarita, my bad, order the drink on the rocks. The service was great.",UNK
10607,"My mother and I ate here last Sunday afternoon...Excellent panang curry & pad thai! It was not greasy at all, had an excellent flavor! I ordered spice level 7 and loved it! I like it spicy!  The atmosphere was also very nice!",UNK
10608,"Service has been good to us. Erin is a great bar tender. The food or  the other hand is awful. Don't get the pizza. It and many other item are previously frozen, then microwaved tasting.",UNK
10609,Pretty good place to come and grab a bite to eat. The service was great and when we checked in we got free fresh spring rolls. Nice! The Philly cheese steak is decent with fresh fries and the waffles are fluffy.,UNK
10610,Dead Roach on the Bamboo on my steam dumpling basket. I got up and left. This is the only time i've gotten up and left besides an hour wait at Denny's.  F'ing gross!!,UNK
10611,"McDonald's should never disappoint, but this one certainly will as they are slow as heck and 9 times out of 10, your fries WILL be cold!",UNK
10612,"I've been coming here for 8 years and still just as good as when I first came in at the old location. They relocated about 2-3 years ago and the office spa is much more roomy and the reception desk is much wider. Overall, it's clean and friendly office.  Both dentists are USC graduates.",UNK
10613,What a disappointment. Had shellac manicure and a pedicure. I could have done a better job on my pedi and the shellac mani which usually lasts two weeks began chipping within the day. This place is an incredible rip off!,UNK
10614,This Ranch 99 is a little creepy. Somewhat dirty with a distinct odor. The prices are better than other locations I've been to but I'd rather fork out a few more bucks a trip for a better shopping experience.,UNK
10615,Do not waste your time and money here!!! You would think they were giving free food the way Everyone kept jumping the line. Disappointing food selection.  Overall not a good dinning experience. Suggest trying a different location.,UNK
10616,"You know when I like to drink my coffee?\n\nIn the morning, when this \""coffee shop\"" is not open.\n\nNo opinion on bike shop. Made me drive off the freeway for a cup of coffee before work, only to note they open at 8am. When I'm at work.",UNK
10617,mmmmm chips with melted cheese!!!  so simple yet so good!!  I might be biased though because this was a post-drinking midnight snack...,UNK
10618,"The casino and hotel are dive city.  The area is sketchy and the hotel seems to lack security.  The casino itself is tiny and smells like an ashtray.  I kept it at 2*, because the slots are loose and the bar was friendly.  Will I go back, I don't think so.",UNK
10619,Ordered their pad Thai to go and as you can see the noodles are twice the size of normal pad Thai noodles because they are overcooked and mushy... \n\nThe color of it is really bland too... Meaning they don't put enough sauce... So disappointed.,UNK
10620,"I came in for the ox tail soup!  They give you a lot of meat!  I enjoyed it.  If you are alone, you can skip the line and sit at the counter.  Good service, but not spectacular.",UNK
10621,nice little greek style diner great for breakfast ive havent ordered lunches but all the breakfasts ive tried have been excellent always had fast service and they check up on you,UNK
10622,"Prices are ridiculous, we didn't even order alcoholic drinks nor big stakes or fish, and yet the bill came back for the 4 of us for $435.00, incredible, never again.\nService great!, food (appetizers) OK.",UNK
10623,If your looking for something different and new try this place! I eat here once a month at least. The shrimp ceviche is bomb! Not to pricy for the food and a good spot to have some drinks too! It's not a Scottsdale spot so don't expect the world! Try it u won't be upset,UNK
10624,"Went into Denny's to get my all you can eat pancakes once out of the year for Veterans Day and got denied.  Apparently they already have deeply discounted menu options like there value slam, so they disregard there promise of all you can eat pancakes on Veterans Day(only Denny's near me)",UNK
10625,"Just like all the other Firehouse subs that I've been to.  They make great subs, much better than Subway.  Service was fast here, even with a group of 15.",UNK
10626,"Pretty good stuff.  Cheap, no frills, etc.  Good quick bite for lunch, but probably not the place to go if you're trying to impress someone.",UNK
10627,"3 out of 5 based on Sushi alone. Sushi wasn't prepared very well, it fell apart easily and the taste was just ok. \n\nWilling to go back to try again as the staff was nice and there seemed to be a lot of regulars. \n\nBYOB.",UNK
10628,I am thankful every day for you and your team Michael Barnes!  You guys are awesome and I will recommend you to anyone that will listen!  :),UNK
10629,"it's cool beans.  reminds me a lot of Bank @ The Bellagio.\n\nif you don't have a hookup to get in, you might not really enjoy your evening if it's busy.",UNK
10630,Customer service is disgusting. Employees won't leave there department to help you or page/call someone over to the department you need help in. No wonder best buys are closing down. I will not be returning. If i wanted wal mart customer service I would of went to wal mart.,UNK
10631,Ordered 2 pizzas an hour and a half ago. Was told 40 minutes. Called them at the 1 hour mark and they said the driver should be there any minute. 30 minutes later and no driver. Called again and they're not even apologetic and refuse to let us speak to any kind of manager.,UNK
10632,"What an amazing experience, every bite was delicious. The pistachios were yummi. The DIY spicy tuna was very good. The scallops I really liked. Best Japanese food I've had in Vegas. The ambiance is very relaxing and the music pleasant.",UNK
10633,Great food but service is awful. Wasn't even crowded and waited 20 min before someone even acknowledged our presence at our table and that's after we had to ask for a server.,UNK
10634,"I love everything about this Crossfit.  It's the best in the valley and worth the drive- no matter where you live...  Still not sold?  Come to the Saturday workout, it's free to first timers!\nI love crossfit and I love this gym!",UNK
10635,Huge shopping with tons of upscale stores.  I really love how close I live from this mall and on a hot day it's a great place to do some mall walking.  You will see some interesting people in here including celebrities and fake scottsdale women with plastic everywhere. This mall seams to always be busy.,UNK
10636,Delicious. We ordered the shrimp roll and crab soup. Our server was extremely helpful by showing us how to wrap the shrimp rolls and what sauces to use with specific dishes. Our server's name was Mimi.,UNK
10637,"First time and I will be back. I am a fan of handmade tortillas and they have delicious ones, both corn and flour. Staff is very friendly and attentive. Looking forward to more good food.",UNK

10644,This place is flawless. It is adorable and the staff are full of energy and charisma. I lov how all their products are natural and guaranteed to never harm your skin or hair. I LOVE coming into the Mandalay Bay and into Lush. I wouldn't go anywhere else for my ocean salt!,UNK

10646,"Long lines. good cars, far from airport (well, the entire car rental depot is far!), friendly staff. That's about it!",UNK
10647,"The chicken teriyaki was overcooked, overseasoned and very oily. The mongolian beef is okay for an airport food.",UNK
10648,"OK, from a facilities standpoint...but all tables were min of $50 on friday night...is $50 the new $25?",UNK
10649,"My boyfriend and I live in the neighborhood and come to this location quite frequently to eat and have some drinks at the bar. We have always had good, friendly service.  The 2 for $25 is our favorite! Also I recommend their Pinot Grigio if you are a wine drinker :)",UNK
10650,Food was well prepared and tasty. The service was quick and attentive. They serve generous portions and the three of us left satisfied.,UNK
10651,I found Ashley through a Groupon and I'm so happy I did. She was very professional and explained how each product worked as she applied it- which I really appreciated. Her studio was very clean and relaxing. I will definitely be coming back to Ashley for my future facials!,UNK
10652,Nice comfortable atmosphere.  Very clean indeed. \n\nI went alone (again!) so I thought that would be a bit awkward sitting by myself but everything was nice.  The girls were friendly.  \n\nI would go back there.  \n\nI wish they had the Omakase courses though...,UNK
10653,"Reasonably priced place for a good, healthy dinner.  The atmosphere is quaint and cozy and the food is pretty good too!",UNK
10654,I get all my crafting supplies from\nThis store.  It's an awesome place to shop if you know what your looking for.,UNK
10655,Excellent food. Absolutely the best al pastor in the valley (that I've found so far). Everything else is great and prices are reasonable.,UNK
10656,Waiting for a drink at the beer garden on the rooftop bar and it has been 22 minutes and counting for the drink to arrive. I love sienna mercato and all of the food there. But this was so ridiculous. Hopefully this place will get better.,UNK
10657,"Convenient and easy place for shipping, fingerprinting and mailing services. It acts as a physical address if you rent a mailbox. Last, if you're lucky Killer the Yorkie may be holding down the fort.",UNK
10658,"This place is just ok for me. The burgers are ok a bit messy and kinda dry. I did really like the smash fries but the fried pickles were grossly over salted. I prefer fatburg, in n out, or 5 guys to this spot.",UNK
10659,i love this little place.  And I do mean little!! The menu is twice the size of the restaurant.  But it's a great place to load up on affordable sushi.  The servers are always super friendly.,UNK
10660,"Carpets looked great. Had some high traffic areas that were black. They did a deep cleaning and restored them to original color. The only thing that sucked was that there was a old wet dirty dog smell after the job was done. Other than that, Good job. Also they were on time and the prices were pretty good.",UNK
10661,"There's not much to say about this Best Buy other than they have decent service. Pretty happy. Will return. BUT, I do wish they had more foreign movies to buy.",UNK
10662,We go every year with friends while in Vegas. Love the atmosphere and live entertainment. It's a nice change from the standard issue Vegas neon lights. Well worth a short cab ride to get there!,UNK
10663,"I was not impressed. I had the pulled pork sandwich with mac & cheese and waffle fries. The pork was dry, bun was soggy and the noodles in the mac & cheese were hard. The waffle fries were good. We will not be back.",UNK
10664,"Tad is a great guy and not afraid to take chances with hair.  Jason was also a great help with a nice scalp massage.  You can tell they are all having a  good time, and excelling at their craft.",UNK
10665,"Always friendly workers! Extra seating upstairs, great balcony, and very cozy! The only problems I have found with it are lack of seating, like any other Starbucks, and poor Wi-Fi. Other than that, the service is amazing which is sometimes hard to find at busy coffeeshops.",UNK
10666,Deep dish is pretty good. It reminds me of a Chicago deep dish type experience. I do like the thin crust as well. The place is always busy and noisy but worth the effort for the pizza.,UNK
10667,Sunbum here with Jill eating the sea urchin. (First time for Jill) \nI say this place is the best sushi place in Scottsdale Area!! Very fresh and well cut !! and great appetizers !! Go there right now and try for yourself ! Bring few people! You need to share the experience!!,UNK
10668,always come here late at night to do homework and everyone is so nice! service is always fast and friendly. beats starbucks wifi!,UNK
10669,"Very much a dive bar, but comfortable. Not typically my scene, but they do offer (through outside source) free learn-to-play-craps tournaments on Monday nights.  Its fun and the winners usually get little freebies such as a gift card to the bar.  Fun for a last minute drink on a weekday after work.",UNK
10670,Stopped in for lunch with my wife as we had never been to a Some Burros before. Staff here are very efficient and friendly. Food came out to us promptly and it was right on target flavor and spice wise. We will be back!,UNK
10671,"Here in CLT on business. I dig this place. Service was good, pie was good. I went to another location not too far from here a year or so ago. Seems like they had more beer selections but that's ok. I love the retro look!",UNK
10672,Fast food in a resturant setting.  Considering this food is good and cheap plus you can get food to go.  Must be a reason why this place is always packed.,UNK
10673,Meh. Not impressed at all. Pizza tasted ok. Pretty annoyed my spaghetti and meatballs is actually a soup bc they didn't drain the pasta. Prb won't order from here again. Giadas and Angelina's are WAY better options.,UNK
10674,"Competent, clean, professional, talented, enjoyable.  Manny produces what the customer wants still providing his own minor creative touches. Overall great experience.",UNK
10675,"Friendly service, dated rooms but it's well worth it for the price paid.  The adjoining rooms are a big plus when traveling with kids",UNK
10676,"I have used this place a couple of times and they always do a great job.  I was in a pinch the other day and had to get my friends wedding dress steamed, this was wednesday and I needed it by Friday.  They had it ready Thursday evening.  Great job.",UNK
10677,I literally waited in the car 10 mins before the order came out in the drive thru! Did someone say fast food!?? Oh and it wasn't even for me,UNK
10678,"The food is the same as as the rest of the franchise.  The service is horrible, go to the concord mills restaurant.\n\nThey don't seem to care.",UNK
10679,Had to get my radiator and thermostat replaced.  Martin was kind enough to explain everything that was going on and friendly while doing so.  Great customer service and quick.  Got everything done in about a couple of days.  Definitely coming back here for my car maintenence.,UNK
10680,B.i.n.g.o started 30 minutes late. 10 minute break was 30 minutes. Was suppose to end at 9 but went till 930. Kinda boring.,UNK
10681,"Classic 50's diner look and feel. Great Cheap menu, good food,good coffee,good shakes  and friendly service.\n\nWhat more can you ask for? If you are looking for a great breakfast spot-check it out, you won't regret it.",UNK
10682,I walked in without an appointment and was not told that without an appointment my chances of being seen were slim to none.  The front office staff were rude and disinterested and could have let me know that I should make an appointment and come back later.,UNK
10683,"2 Stars because of the ambiance (artwork), the manager was very accommodating and the service was really good. The food wasn't what it should have been for its Michelin-star rating. I did the tasting menu and I found all the dishes to be pretty bland.",UNK
10684,"Disappointed I stop this morning to try them out, but they were closed even though the door said open at 7AM at 7:20 they were not.... Off to Jamba Juice I go...",UNK
10685,Some of the best sushi I have had in the area! Their lattes are no joke either! Will come back every time I am in town!,UNK
10686,"The food was excellent, Bruschetta was yummy and pizza was thin and crispy! Atmosphere is nice but the waiter was blah! He took forever for everything! But I ain't gonna judge the place by just the waiter, I would go again!",UNK
10687,Worst food I have ever tasted. We ordered the appetizer sampler so we could try several different items. Some food was hot but mostly lukewarm. The wings looked and tasted terrible. The rest was just so-so. Definitely not a place to visit again,UNK
10688,"7th Street Market is one of my favorite hang outs. There are so many awesome businesses to check out. They have everything- pizza, sandwiches, sushi, desserts/sweets, coffee, cooking salts, and handmade bath products. They have something for everyone here.",UNK
10689,Great place to stop. The service was good and so was the food. Simple menu with all the basics.  This joint is pretty small though but still a good stop for early or late breakfast.,UNK
10690,Happy hour rocks!! Kaitlyn was a very attentive server and a tons of fun. Great suggestions!! It was half off bottles of wine which made my night twice as fun.,UNK
10691,Overall place was okay it was nice and the wine good but my rib eye was very bland.   Service was perfect though and for that reason I give it 3 stars.,UNK
10692,"This place is great. Decent food, great beer, great service. They let you bring your dog, which I love. The down side is their limited parking. But, they have valet parking,  so they are trying to help mitigate that issue.",UNK
10693,"Was tricky to find but well worth the hunt!!! Great tacos, and friendly chef! We will definitely be back for more!!!",UNK
10694,New lounge open at Bally's. Had some drinks with friends. Comfortable atmosphere with comfy couches and a DJ to boot!,UNK
10695,I love their vegan / vegetarian menu! The food is so good! Just remember to ask them to hold the MSG! \n\nFriendly service. Clean. Nice atmosphere.,UNK
10696,Couldn't fault them. Spring rolls were good. Sesame chicken extremely good. The pad thai was yummy but could have done with a bit more flavor and the cashew chicken could have done with a few more cashew but overall it arrived hot and tasty!!,UNK
10697,Amazing Asian Fusion in Vegas - yes please!  The sea bass appetizer was hands down the best piece of fish I've ever had. Make sure to get a dish with some Peruvian corn and some sake to top it off.  I'll be back here again next time I'm in Vegas!,UNK
10698,"I'm not sure how this place stays open as it's always empty. The lounge is ok but not very atmospheric. The prices are decent if on a budget. Otherwise, go elsewhere.",UNK
10699,Friendly but not the same since Josh left. I see many new people working here and they don't seem to offer the friendly service as before.,UNK
10700,"Love this place, I've been going for lunch for years- you just can't beat it for under $7!! Staff is amazing and the food is delicious!",UNK
10701,The price and variety of the menu is a plus but the quality of the food is not great. I got the chef special that had all three meats but it tasted bland and wasn't worth it,UNK
10702,"If you're hungry and you want a good breakfast sandwich with egg whites, turkey sausage, hot temperature and something that tastes like food...Do not go here.  Worse food I've had since castor oil...",UNK
10703,The best Indian food in the valley!  We moved here 6 years ago and never found an Indian restaurant we liked until this place. Now we are regulars.,UNK
10704,"Terrible service, cold food, nothing compared to Bachi Burger. Sweet potato fries are cold and soggy, and the manly burger tasted like it was sitting out for 20min before they brought it out. The only reason this place gets one star is because they have decent beer.",UNK
10705,"Great food! Can't wait to go back and try the seafood enchiladas. The jalepeno margarita is great, still sweet, unless you eat the jalepenos ;)",UNK
10706,"Eh,  Just average food. Very slow service. They drop off the food and don't return until halfway thru the meal. Horrific chicken parmesan.  Pass",UNK
10707,"This particular gas station is hard to get in to.  Their gas prices are a little bit more than the other stations in the area and only have a few pumps.  When you have no other choice and are out of gas, this is the place to stop.  Good luck getting back on the main road.",UNK
10708,"Fabulous. Spotless, beyond curteous, great views. Love, love, love.  The atmosphere is a tiny bit stuffy for this slightly younger lady, but it is so peaceful and relaxing. I think about having breakfast delivered to my patio every morning and sigh wistfully. Can't wait to stay here again.",UNK
10709,Just ok.  Really expensive for what you get. \nNothing great. Other casino are better and more value for your money.,UNK
10710,I've passed this place several times and finally ate there. I've been twice now and the food is decent. The pomegranate margaritas are awesome! They have a good selection of things and are usually quick with service. It's not amazing but its been pretty good both times.,UNK
10711,Love me nails :) reasonable prices. Had my\nEyebrows waxed as well. Friendly people. My daughter had her nails and feet painted as well. Discount if you use cash! :),UNK
10712,"Two weeks ago went in late on a Wednesday entertaining some friends from Paris.  From the host who greeted us to the server to the kitchen helping a few vegetarians, everything was wonderful.  Thanks Tornado!",UNK
10713,"Very slow service. had three people  bring the food, but it the follow up or service after that. No drink refills, waited 10.minute between boxing leftovers a d getting the check.",UNK
10714,"Remember how the manager the second time said he'd give me a call back about \""whether there is anything he could do for me\"" after the whole stir? (insert sarcastic exclamation here): I never heard back! Well, at least they are consistent...",UNK
10715,"This place is awful.  I bought a package for massages which they have refused to honor and refuse to refund my money.  They either double book, don't show up or show up late.  Do not go here.",UNK
10716,"Frys is awesome, but like all supermarkets do not come here in the late hours. Unless you want to people watch. It is great... Anthropological enthusiasts come here.",UNK
10717,Trying to figure out why they charged me $14 for two pairs of dress pants. They did offer me a 10% off coupon bringing the total down to $12.60. Still not good enough.,UNK
10718,Pita Cafe is great!  People are always friendly and the food is awesome.  I have gotten this for takeout 4-5 times now and it is very consistent and delicious.,UNK
10719,The gluten free bun was actually worth the purchase/calories! Side note: Blue cheese was so good too! Highly recommend going here.,UNK
10720,"Service was good, granted we were the first people there at 7AM on a Wednesday. \nI was expecting fluffy pancakes and instead, they were really hard. Maybe I just waited too long to eat them. \n\nThe portions are generous and the coffee is really good.",UNK
10721,The service here is terrible. I went my whole meal with an empty glass that was never refilled. My sons order was incorrect after repeating it three times.,UNK
10722,This was a forgettable show.  It's like all the rejected stunts from the other Cirque du Soleil shows all rolled into one big disjointed mess.  If you've seen other Cirque du Soleil shows you've already seen Zarkana.  Skip it.  Good thing our tickets were free.,UNK
10723,"I feel silly admitting this, but the only reason I was in the Excalibur was for their buffet.\n\nYep.",UNK
10724,"I've only ordered carryout pho from here and it was phenomenal. The broth is a tad nontraditional, but very flavorful and totally delicious.",UNK
10725,"Decent course for the $45 off season price. Greens were in terrible shape but I'm told they are better during the summer. Be sure to practice good \""etiqueccy\"" here and watch out for the Dbag wearing all black.",UNK
10726,"Pippa is a healer. A+++++ I am a dancer and couldn't have been happier. Left rejuvenated. Her leg and arm work is perfection. Run, don't walk!!",UNK
10727,I had links removed from my watch. I was in and out the door in 15 minutes and it was only $12. The owners were friendly.,UNK
10728,Their best item is the crispy tofu. They also have great eggplant. The portions aren't as big as the ones I get back in SoCal but this place is arguably one of the best Chinese sit down restaurants in Champaign.,UNK
10729,"this is the best video store i've ever been to, and i've been to a lot, all over the country. their foreign film selection is unsurpassed.",UNK
10730,"Absolutely nothing bad to say about this place! Amazing food, amazing service. Our server put all of our leftovers in a box and refills while our glasses were still half full. Ps. Get the Mongolian Beef!!",UNK
10731,My first time here and I will be back! I was craving mad Greek gyros but this was the closest gyro location with the best reviews. Far better than the mad Greek! It tastes so fresh and if you're like me and enjoy REAL food you'll love this place. Just look at the picture,UNK
10732,Great place that my boyfriend and I like to go to. We always get the ravioli. Love the passion fruit tea. Can't wait to try the pizza!,UNK
10733,Really fun experience.  Went with a group of 10 and had a blast.  Very creative puzzles and setup.  We are already planning a trip to try the other room.,UNK
10734,Several orders later and still fantastic!\n\nThe only criticism I have is that the delivery guys don't offer to give change. They just take whatever you hand them and then bolt. I would likely tell them to keep the change anyway but I would prefer it if they at least offered to make change.,UNK
10735,Overpriced mediocre pizza. Our family of four (2 kids 2 adults) dined here for lunch and dropped $82 (including tip) for pizza that was just OK and a good beer selection. \nThe pizza is too bready and not very crisp. There are better pizza choices in the area.,UNK
10736,"Was at D's this afternoon! I was so excited to find real vienna Hot Dogs in Pittsburgh since I am a born and raised Chicago guy. They were good dogs, had mine Chicago Style of course! Not sure it was Pollmans Mustard. It the buns had poppy seeds! A great place with plenty of atmosphere!",UNK
10737,The food was very fresh and appetizing. We were not sure what to expect but were completely satisfied. I especially liked the dim sum options. They had warm and iced crab legs. The pita bread was made right in front of you. They have a huge gelato selection as well as other desserts.,UNK
10738,"It took over a quarter of a century for me to find really good crab rangoon since I left Missouri for California and then three months ago Nevada.  Here it is now, where you can even get a good taste of crab and see crab in it.  5 stars for the crab rangoon.",UNK
10739,"I had Pad See Ew, it was good but I had frequent chewy bits of beef. Thai Tea doesn't come with free refills. Bathroom is creepy to find (took like 2 hallways to find)\n\nI might come back for the bar and live entertainment.",UNK
10740,I went to outside walk up lines.  Service was bad.  Wait was way too long to receive order.  Food (nachos) were literally thrown together.  Looked like mushy mess.  Pretzel was dry and hard.  Frozen hot chocolate was just a shake in a plastic cup you could get anywhere.  Very disappointing.,UNK
10741,"We got take out and it was a big disappointment.  I didn't think the flavor was all that good. Also, I ordered 8/10 on their spiciness scale, and it was really weak.",UNK
10742,Took my girlfriend here for their signature hand-pulled noodle. She thought it was the best noodles she ever had.\n\nWill repeat!,UNK
10743,Nice casual dining location with delicious food after a night out in Vegas. I enjoyed a Bistro cheese sandwich and salad and we shared a espresso martini for dessert which had a great kick to knock us out of our food coma while satisfying the sweet tooth!,UNK
10744,I loved this place! Amazing food and service. The servings are just right and very flavorful. Would highly recommend this place if you want a nice quiet dinner.,UNK
10745,Okay hot dogs........ticket times way to long! Mmmm bathrooms right by entrance kind of gross.,UNK
10746,"The food is delicious, the brucetta is a personal favorite of mine.  The place is sometimes over crowded and the service is not always friendly.",UNK
10747,Don't bother.  Visit the grounds and stay somewhere else... So called upgraded rooms are tired.  I have stayed at the Waldorf Astoria in NYC and this is considered one of their Premiere Properties..  From the outside and grounds maybe from the standard or upgraded rooms in the Villas  .. no way.,UNK
10748,"This is by far the worst place to get coffee. They don't have liquid flavored creamers, no sugar packets. Everything is powder and it's dispensed from a machine. And the supposedly baked daily donuts were hard and stale. They felt like bagels. This place sucks.",UNK
10749,"We arrived with about 20 minutes to spend eating on dinner before our concert started, they sat us quickly and started to shove all the beautiful meat at us. It was great! Staff was friendly and accomodating, would definitely go back for more!",UNK
10750,"Dr. Bates is the best doctor I've ever dealt with -- listens, provides real solutions, and doesn't require 4 appointments for the things that are able to be done in 1. \n\nExcellence is rare these days.",UNK
10751,"Loved this artsy eclectic bar. Not a \""scene\"" but makes you feel cool anyway. Amazing handmade cocktails- just wish they were a little bigger!",UNK
10752,This is a great place and the people are the friendliest. I really enjoy their food. It is always fresh. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone. The management is the best!,UNK
10753,"The food is excellent.  However, it is close to impossible to find a parking spot around lunchtime. Also, people using the free Wi-fi set up shop at the booths during the busiest hours and prevent others from having a place to sit.",UNK
10754,"The tacos here are street style, which means that they are muy tiny.  I have been here around 4 or 5 times and they are always overloaded with cilantro.  Customer service is very good however.",UNK
10755,"Availablity is hit or miss, have been trying to rent a new release for about 3 weeks now! Service has also been below average.. also whatever you do dont forget your card!!!!",UNK
10756,Horrible company that lies to employees and withholds pay without any communication or reason. The people who are suppose to support you jump to conclusions. \n\n\nDon't work here unless u want to make 60% of what you earn.,UNK
10757,"The area is sort of run down and the store looks to be in a similar state. Some Safeways are incredible, although expensive. Good thing we only needed a few items. \n\nOn a positve note, there were cart wipes which were definately required. \nIck!",UNK
10758,Surprisingly decent. All the Grand Cafes have special late night menus with good deals on breakfast items like steak and eggs. Nice after a late night of drinking or gambling.,UNK
10759,"Place is great. It was recomended by a friend and now I wont go anywhere else.  Haven't found a place that can give a great razorfade in years, till now.  I will continue to go here for as long as I live here.",UNK
10760,"I shop this location because it is close to home and easy to get to off of Hwy 51, the staff are very helpful and friendly. There is a Starbucks at this location and they have, a breakfast sandwich/lunch sandwich bar at this location. The prices are good and it is convenient stop.",UNK
10761,I love apple pie and See's apple pie truffles are like an extra sweet version of the pie.  Every once in a while I just have to indulge!,UNK
10762,Not what I thought it would be at all. Very greasy and staff not friendly. They DO give you a lot of food.,UNK
10763,This place is an awesome place to go for unwinding or happy hour. The setting is relaxing!  Bartenders are great but the manager (Kim) is not friendly at all.  That is not good in a customer service / hospitality industry.  It would have earned five stars otherwise but the interaction with manager was not positive.,UNK
10764,"They had some OK clothes here and a few bargains, but terrible customer service.  Someone totally cut me in line and the cashier didn't do a thing about it.  I walked out without making a purchase.",UNK
10765,"The place is a really cool place, but the food was nothing special at all. We had some appetizers and then ordered sandwiches since we thought anything cooked would be a bit disastrous, the bread was hard as a rock and there really was not too much flavor in the sandwiches.",UNK
10766,"The manager Adam was very friendly, helpful and patient while assisting me with my order and questions that I had, all while training a new employee. Thank you very much for your help and kindness.",UNK
10767,"Every time I'm in Vegas, this is the one place I have to eat at. Definitely some of the best pizza I've ever had. Their wings and cheesy bread are average, but their pizza is awesome. I've tried different specialty pizzas and have never been disappointed. Highly recommend this place.",UNK
10768,"This place is definitely a classic.  A fairly well run casino and hotel, lots of great shows.  But the rooms definitely need an update.  I was half expecting Sinatra to pop in at any moment.",UNK
10769,Food is good. Customer service lacks a lot....lady is so rude.  They charge 50 cent additional if you use your card no matter the amount.  So your breakfast burrito will be nearly 6 dollars. That's one of the cheapest food items.,UNK
10770,Customer service is garbage they don't care they work at a toy store an have horrible attitudes wish there was a way to have their corp contact me...,UNK
10771,"Totally ignored me. Waited 15 minutes for two drinks. Missed 15 minutes of \""Stand By Me.\"" Didn't listen to me. Had attitude. Never going back.",UNK
10772,"I tried sashimi deluxe, not fresh, some pieces were too cold and little hard because some ice in it.\nMaybe trying sashimi in Pittsburg is not a good idea.",UNK
10773,Ordered lunch special w/bowl of chili. Received it luke warm. They did heat it up in microwave. Came out nice & hot. Rest of meal came out great. Waitperson was nice and attentive. Will come back again.,UNK
10774,"The happy hour bar menu and drinks were very nice. The bartender made the \""rita\"" for me on the tart side which is what I wanted. The shredded pork was fantastic. Very nice atmosphere. The servers seemed friendly and efficient.",UNK
10775,Phx city grille is amazing !!!!! We go at least once a week great atmosphere and  food is great. A True gem to phx ....,UNK
10776,Loved this place! I had the calamari and came with rice and eggplant slice. Very delicious and the waiter did a great job!,UNK
10777,place wasnt so great.\n\ni came here earlier today for lunch with my dad and some of his coworkers. the staff wasnt great. they got orders all wrong. food was average. ive had wayyy better in southern california. doubt i'll go back to this place.,UNK
10778,"Above average for M & S. chain,good seafood,but pricey. Other PGH restaurants that serve good seafood at the same price range that are not chains, so visit them instead.",UNK
10779,Cookies - YES. Other food - Forget it. The meat and toppings are the same quality as Subway. Save your money and do not buy the overpriced poor quality sandwiches that can be purchased elsewhere for much less.,UNK
10780,"Pretty standard sports bar. Good layout, with plenty of HDTV seats. Beer selection is expansive. Feature beer night I went was watermelon. I tried it... Yech! Why even put it on the menu?\n\nI only ordered the french fries, which were good.",UNK
10781,Giani has done amazing work on me for a while now. He's got talent like no other! I won't go to anyone else! His shop is awesome and he has alot of great artists. Thank you G! See ya soon for some more tattoo therapy! :),UNK
10782,I'm sorry. If you've never had good chinese or mexican food you'd never know the difference. The food leaned to the very salty and not well prepared. Reminded my a lot Panda Express. The problem with fusion places is like this is they try to do everything and frankly dont do anything well.,UNK
10783,"The food is great, very relaxing.  The service staff is not in your face every ten seconds, but if you need something they are right there to get it.  Parking is a little painful, as you will need to valet your car, otherwise your forced to walk about a block to park.",UNK
10784,"Food was okay, but kinda plain. Wasn't sure if there was seasoning on the burger or not. The cashier also said we had to use all of the $40 on one visit, which it does not say on the groupon, so beware",UNK
10785,Very nice service..Servers were very friendly and prepared our food on time and efficient...Food is on point..Everything  was delicous,UNK
10786,"Best grilled cheese with ham I've had in years. Service was amazing. I've heard that the breakfast is great, so I am going to try that since it was also suggested that the wait, unlike at every other place in town on the weekend, isn't painful.",UNK
10787,"Food? Service? Atmosphere? Meh. Side note bartender gets visibly annoyed when you use the check-in promotion. \""Sorry bro must be tough to have to look at my phone screen and then touch a button.\""",UNK
10788,"Best Fry's in Arizona! I love shopping here. Everything is nice and clean and the prices are great especially if you have their V.I.P. card. Their staff is friendly without being fake and I love the layout of the store. After recently moving, I go out of my way to shop here.",UNK
10789,Overrated. I took my girlfriend here and now she is in the toilet puking... ok not really but this place sucks. \n\nbad everything.. wasted $65. :(,UNK
10790,"Totally enjoyed our pedicures,Gary and I,and my pink and white set! Jaclyn did a great job on my nails, I would recommend this place to anyone. Go try it and see for yourself.",UNK
10791,"Not bad, not great, but a lot of pool tables.  Not too much else to say other than parking sometimes sucks due to popular shows at the High Noon next door.",UNK
10792,"Could do a bit better on the friendliness tip.  We weren't asking for much more than a smile or a nice welcome.  The hotel itself is ultra modern when u enter the lobby, and the room is great, large tub is great, but the check-in experience put a bad taste in my mouth.  The Heart Bar is cool though.",UNK
10793,"This is a great little park in North Scottsdale. I love it because it is so close to my house and during peak times there are some great dogs for Milly to play with. Two drawbacks of the park are that there are not any lights, and that it is half dirt, so humans and pups get very dirty.",UNK
10794,"I booked a room this weekend with the MGM because I purchased tickets to watch the Mayweather fight however I was very disappointed upon entering the room because it seemed like no one had cleaned it. Yes sheets were made, however there was forks on the floor, a small bottle of baby oil, and other items. That's gross.",UNK
10795,"Absolute worst customer service... The staff knows nothing about products, how to be friendly or even how to ring items and sales up.  So glad my friend's shower is over and I can direct her to shop at target for baby needs instead... Disgusting how this store is run",UNK
10796,Don't order your keg from them.  They will sell it to someone else.  We ordered ours over 2 weeks ago for pick up today.  We were told they sold it two days ago to someone else.  What is wrong with this place???  That's not how you do business.,UNK
10797,The chicken salad tastes divine on a croissant. I'm hooked. \n\nCaveat: there have been issues with wi-fi not working a few times.,UNK
10798,Carne Asada fries! Open 24hrs and never too packed! Minus 1 star cause they got no Mexican Cokes!,UNK
10799,I went here with a few friends to try it out during restaurant week.  The servers are attentive.  The food is amazing and very french.  Overall great meal.,UNK
10800,"Generous, fresh and well balanced donuts!  Love this place.  The creme filled do not have overly sweet creme--delicious.",UNK
10801,"After dealing with a disaster from a 1-800 Flowers store, I went to The Blossom Shop and they were great! The flowers were top quality, and the service was what you should expect. I will definitely use them every time now!",UNK
10802,"Overpriced rip off. $10 for 6 bun-sized, spicy diarrhea bread. Cold. I say spicy diarrhea, since that's what happens after eating the overpriced obesity & diarrhea inducing bakery item.",UNK
10803,Great atmosphere and friendly service. My fiance had the #2 and I had the fish Tacos. Food was great and it was nice to get away from the hipsters that infest old town Scottsdale.,UNK
10804,$5.45 for a bowl of soup and 1/2 a roll (literally the roll was sliced in half). While the broccoli cheese soup is very good I could get more for my money elsewhere....a lot more!,UNK
10805,Great coffee!\nGreat atmosphere!\nGreat service!\nSo glad I found this place. Wish I was local.,UNK
10806,We absolutely love this place!!! They make the best tom yum goong EVER! We used to eat here all the time when lived close and never had a bad experience. By far our favorite tai joint in AZ and we have tried several others. The pad tai is amazing as well!,UNK
10807,Ordered their flavor of the week smores. Extremely strong dark chocolate taste overpowered any other flavor. No Graham cracker in the icecream. Almost threw away the cone. Cold stone is way better.,UNK
10808,"It's priced well and it's clean. Don't expect this to be a 5 star hotel. The price is well worth the stay, as long as you remember that you will have to get your own linen and kitchen supplies at the front desk.",UNK
10809,"Lite tacos were actually pitas. Tasteless. My husband loves it as its a greasy food sports bar. But if I cant get a decent meal...even a basic salad or taco, they're dead to me.",UNK
10810,"Ok maybe its a bad night. The sauteed calamari smelled like fish out of lake mead, we've been here for over an hour and a half and there's only 2 of us here and the las Vegas roll is as big as an onion ring. Seriously?",UNK
10811,Big fan of this joint.  Like the location and have always had a great time when going. The employees are polite and the service is very good.,UNK
10812,"This is how to watch a movie. Recline, order you meal and wine and enjoy. It's the service and theater experience that we lost. Love it. The 3d movies are excellent. Saw Guardians of the Galaxy in 3d. Awesome!!!! Don't just pick make sure you are in the full service nice  theaters",UNK
10813,"I don't get the attraction , This place has a cold not so friendly atmosphere. The food was ok , but kinda pricey. didn't look very clean or sanitary considering it was a CHURCH !\n\nI'll just go back to Mario's in the south side.",UNK
10814,"As of Jan. 2012, they're closed, by the way, this isn't in Ballantyne, it's in Pineville.",UNK
10815,"Had Buffalo Chicken sandwich, it was not that bad.   My friend ordered chicken tenders, it was horrible.   Good place for people who had drinking.   Nice environment.",UNK
10816,Great hotel with a good ambince.  The city centre is huge though and the probably is they all look the same so hard to check out all the casinos.  The casino was fun to play at and a large selection of games. The security though is very tight.,UNK
10817,food was okay but the place is filthy. Tables were dirty. Dead flies in window seals. Window blinds have food residue splattered on them.  Ceiling fans have dust caked on them. Gross...,UNK
10818,Loved the peanut sauce that came with the spring rolls. Good place to grab some pho when you want to avoid the traffic of China Town.,UNK
10819,Prices are not consignment store prices. The prices are way high. Furniture is ok but not a bargain by any means.,UNK
10820,Nice salad bar. Reminds me of Souplantation. I will be back. Wish they had clam chowder and a more desserts!,UNK
10821,We have talked to you Candice and your Dad (if that's what you'd call it). No changes to my review. It takes a lot to get me to the point of writing a good or bad review. I won't bore everyone with all the details.,UNK
10822,"Very friendly service and nice atmosphere. They also allowed me to order the kid's bean & cheese burrito, which was only $4 and very large! It was also very good. Hopefully I will be able to return in the future to try more of the menu.",UNK
10823,This customer service is really bad and the food is just as crappy!! Stay away! I have gone there a couple of times and they just don't seem to get the order correct. Will not go back.,UNK
10824,"Food choices seemed excellent until every thing tasted salty. It got to the point where one bite was taken and you knew that that was the end of that food item. The smoked salmon tasted disgusting, as if it was left out for hours. Only edible items: beef pho and tiramisu.",UNK
10825,"Awful, dirty, food not cooked all the way, shakes are with syrups!!!awful.  Will never go there again, workers are rude.",UNK
10826,"Horrible Customer Service, if you can call be ignored service.\n\nAlso, not to customer service individuals, customers do not want to hear about the internal drama of your work situation.  Especially when they are there to sign up for a bridal registry, which would bring a lot of money to your store.  Just sayin'",UNK
10827,"If you have any common sense at all, please don't stay here.  Once, it almost burnt down...and I'm pretty sure most of the locals were chanting \""burn, baby, burn.\""",UNK
10828,"We came here to buy some groceries, and we are surprise how friendly the whole staff are.in every parts of the store they greet you and asked if you need help. And the Cashier has been so cheerful and funny. My overall experience is Great.",UNK
10829,Came here because we heard Leonardo Di Caprio was going.  Lol.  No sight.  I didn't really iike the DJ- cut the songs too short and not hype enough.  The space was small with lots of tables reserved for bottle service- so no where to sit at all when your feet hurt.  Nothing too special,UNK
10830,This place is a great dive. The wings are my favorite in Charlotte with a wonderfully-flavorful sauce and not too expensive. Don't expect great service though if there is a crowd.,UNK
10831,"Kids, kids everywhere. The place is a huge daycare center. Pools always running some type of swimming class for kids. Basketball courts have daycare classes in them, the other side of the court mostly 11 year olds. I'll be avoiding this place.",UNK
10832,I agree with some of the other reviews.  Overall this resort is a disappointment.  It's just ok.  Just ok.  Expect more from the Hilton name.,UNK
10833,"I got a double helix mixed drink here while the wife went shopping.  It kind of seemed like a strawberry mojito.  Very refreshing, and makes shopping with the wife less boring!",UNK
10834,Took my wife there based on a Yelp review. We had a nice dinner for two. Everything was fresh and tasty. We split the a la carte salad. It was on the high end of moderately priced.,UNK
10835,When we arrived they tried to place us away from the dance floor when we reserved bottle service. After arguing we got down to the main floor. When we finished our bottle that we payed over $1000 for they kicked us out of our table and tried to kick us out the VIP section. Wouldn't recommend to any1 they do shady business,UNK
10836,"What a great way to start the morning!  We enjoyed our fantastic, European breakfast on the patio with a beautiful view of the fountain.  The orange marmalade for the toast and the cheese danish were to die for!  The omelet with steak, peppers and mozzarella was quite tasty too!",UNK
10837,"I ate and drank at the lounge here during a recent summer stay at the Buttes.   I My favorite is the chips - the ones with bacon, blue cheese, and chipotle sauce...YUMM!",UNK
10838,"Who doesn't like a sub stacked high with meat, toasted to add a little crunch and mayo or mustard to taste?  A great place for lunch or dinner or whatever.  The one recommendation I would have is to eat it there.  Trying to take a toasted sub home never works out as great as you think it will.",UNK
10839,"Had an appointment with Allison today. She took my ultra thick, natural curly and long mess of hair and sculpted it into something amazing and stylish. My hair needed Allison and the love and expertise she put into every single second of the appointment. The shampoo and scalp massage was amazing.",UNK
10840,Good thai food. I ordered the spicy noodles with tofu..and I asked for maximum hot.....oo and it was good. Good service. Not the greatest thai food I ate but still good.,UNK
10841,"So i have some friends in AZ but none of them wanted to hang so I ended up hear . The pizza is like the size of Jacksonville ,Fl (largest city per sq ft. in the U.S.)it takes like 10 min to eat one slice .",UNK
10842,"Not the real thing, but almost. Overpriced, like most things in Las Vegas, but definitely the best deli in the area.",UNK
10843,"Chris, the owner, and staff are super nice and friendly! The artwork inside is unique. The pizza crust, ranch, & fried Oreos were delicious. Would've like more cheese on the pizza. Other than that it was yummy. We will definitely be back! Can't wait till they can serve booze :-)",UNK
10844,"This is a bar trying to be more. The small plates were heavy and riffs on burgers and fries. The beer selection is what you would find at Harris Teeters and is marked up. Go to Gallery 22 if you want an amazing selection of beer, better prices, and a true tapas restaurant upstairs.",UNK
10845,"If you are Las Vegas bound and want too see the Grand Canyon the best way to go is by Helicopter with my peeps Maverick Helicopters!!! Stamp by \""MrVegasVip\""",UNK
10846,"Nasty, tasteless nuggets of over-fried batter. Even Long John Silvers is better than this dump. Of course if you're a drunk college student you may enjoy this after a night at the bar.",UNK
10847,"Want to drink something expensive in a trendy little spot before the show? Hey, why not?! It's Vegas!!\n\nP.S. GO SEE BEATLES LOVE @ THE MIRAGE. Spectacular!",UNK
10848,They have a lot of things of choose from but nothing I liked.  The fabric on the couches were scratchy and colors were dull.  Most of the furniture are made from China and they don't have a lot in stock.  Everything takes a few weeks (2 to 3).  But the prices are reasonable.,UNK
10849,The service was great. The waitress was attentive enough but not overly. \n\nThe food was mostly fine with the exception being the bacon. It came out burned. It wasn't like accidently burned. Judging from the other plates this is how they cook the bacon.,UNK
10850,Can't complain had a great time here. Hotel was very nice. Room was spacious and clean. Hotel pool was awesome! Overall the hotel was a great choice.,UNK
10851,"Outside Inn is a great places for locals to go. Since I am new to the Las Vegas area I wanted to find a bar that gave good drink specials, and a friendly environment. The bartenders are friendly, and always make you feel welcomed when arriving!",UNK
10852,"I came after the first day of a work trip with a coworker. \n\nThe service was great, all the food was delicious, but both of us ended up sick for the next two days. \n\nI wanted to go back for the food but getting that sick it just isn't worth it. :(",UNK
10853,CLOSED. I went to go catch a drink and something to eat while I caught the game... only to find the place shuttered.,UNK
10854,"Went there during lunch.  Lunch prices were very reasonable, the service was good and the food was delicious.  Would definitely recommend and will be going there again.",UNK
10855,Terrible restaurant !!! Do not come near this place!!! Food was tasteless. I have never paid for such disgusting food in my life. I will def not walk in there again. The only reason why I gave them 2 stars is because service was very good.,UNK
10856,I don't understand how they stay in business?  I'm trying to think of one time I've gone to this Kmart and left with what I was looking for?  They have shelves upon shelves of nonsense?  Low quality and the employees seem like they'd like to saw off their arm.,UNK
10857,"I don't understand all these good reviews? This place is horrible. We didn't get ranch with our hot wings or soy sauce with our rice, and once the waiter left good luck catching him again! The food was completely inedible! I have nothing good to say about my experience and I won't be going back!",UNK
10858,"Great Duck Tour. If you want to see Pittsburgh in an hour, this is the best way to do it. It was entertaining, the speaker was funny and the driver was great too. A beautiful way to see the city and figure out what you want to do next. Fun.",UNK
10859,This is the newest of the Zipps clan located off Bethany Home in Central Phoenix. It's a smaller bar but still a great place.  This used to be the old COX building so maybe that has something to do with all the HD TVs they have.  Practically every seat had a good view of the games going on.,UNK
10860,"Pizza is normally cold and hard- tables not clean, restaurant dirty.  Crowded, dirty restrooms... i could go on all day.  The pizza is bad, to say it nicely.  Only good thing here is the price.",UNK
10861,"I purchased 7 items from here and only enjoyed one. The Tres Leches was awesome, one of the best I've ever tasted, but the doughnuts, churros and assorted sweet breads were incredibly dry and flavorless.",UNK
10862,"Cakes are moist and absolutely delicious.  Great variety.  The food is 5 stars however, the staff friendliness is not great.  If you want great cake, you will be happy just realize the staff won't be overly nice to you.",UNK
10863,"Sometimes Active body has great things but nothing you can not find in other stores, In addition to poor customer service they are rude. Who needs that aggrivation.",UNK
10864,Caesar salad was great. Everything else was ok. Wait staff is excellent. Disappointed in the food. Rigatoni ala vodka was bland. Chicken parm was very salty.,UNK
10865,"Fish had no flavor, Chips were soggy and tasted strange.  Took my order to the counter and said that is was terrible.  The young woman replied, \""we don't give refunds\"".  She didn't offer something else or ask what was wrong.  Never going back.",UNK
10866,It's ok inside.  Fried chicken was average and overpriced.\nNot sure why anyone would go here when there are other options near by...it's VEGAS!  Don't do a chain.  Do that in the Midwest.,UNK
10867,"Food and service was good not great but  certaintly not memorable. The noise level is horrendous with the waitress having to almost yell to describe the specials,etc. This was in the dining room too not in the bar. Also, the table are way too close together. Better places can be had nearby.",UNK
10868,"The only good thing about this apartment is how big they are, and my neighbors. The stag was friendly but they switched since I've moved here and i don't like the new staff. Work orders take longer now, and if your ever late our need time to pay your screwed.",UNK
10869,"Super dirty, unsafe, and slow. I have tried going to this Walmart during all hours of the day and they never have enough lanes open. \u00be of the times I'll see the police arresting someone and outside the doors are homeless people hanging out. \n\nGo to the target around the corner.",UNK
10870,"Way overpriced! My husband paid $7 for one Pacifico! Yikes!! The guacamole and chips were ok, but the one star is becasue my husband was sick all night after having their steak tacos.",UNK
10871,"The store looks and is laid out great. Not enough selection though to warrant the trip. Can get a better deal with the free shipping and being in South Carolina, on-line is tax free. The store is not near as big or the selection as good as the stores in outdoor havens Seattle,WA or Anchorage,AK which was disappointing.",UNK
10872,Meh - I've had better sushi for a cheaper price. I guess they can charge whatever because you are trapped. Vegas.,UNK
10873,"It's too expensive for just okay food. I had a steak last time and for the price, I could have had a better steak at Black Angus or surf and turf at Red Lobster.",UNK
10874,"I live nearby  and have driven past this place many times. Today my wife called me and asked that I bring her lunch. Needless to say, we were not disappointed by these gyros. Savory meat piled high with the right amount of sauce atop a a fresh pita was a great lunch.",UNK
10875,"I live nearby so I go to Bogey's every now and then.  For a bar, their food is really good.  I especially like the pizzas.  Service is not that great though.",UNK
10876,The main function of this review is to certify that a real Yelper has been here and has received reasonable service and food that was about the standard of any other Panda Express. No rudeness or food poisoning was involved in the production of this review.\n\nEnjoy.,UNK
10877,"Don't expect good customer service unless your a mild age white person, or look like you just got off the course. Not once was I asked if I needed any help. -_-",UNK
10878,Meh.... $20 for a chicken Caesar salad is a tough sell even in town square. Too much good competion in the same mall for that.,UNK
10879,"Solid bar food!  We stopped in for lunch and had the chicken quesadillas, loaded nachos and chili verde burritos and everything was excellent.  Reasonable prices and huge portions.",UNK
10880,"Great service. However the food was such a bad deal I will never go back. Way over priced and the \""custard\"" is not custard at all. If u want real custard then go to Ritas. Don't go here if you are hungry. I just was very disappointed.",UNK
10881,I don't eat Thai food anywhere else. The food is so good that you will crave it. Do yourself a favor and run to this place for dinner. You will not be disappointed.\n\nGreat customer service and a great atmosphere.,UNK
10882,"Relatively new facility with a real commitment to providing excellent customer service.  Staff is very friendly and always helpful.  The price is reasonable.  This Hampton Inn is very close to the LAS airport (and rental car facility).  The \""Las Vegas Strip\"" is only about 15 minutes away.  I would certainly stay here again.",UNK
10883,"Kind of expensive and you have to work to get your crab out. The don't have the shell crackers, only a zip tool.",UNK
10884,Went with three other sushi regulars and one newbie.  All enjoyed immensely.  $45 out the door despite several shared beers and sake.  I'll go back for sure.,UNK
10885,Went yesterday with a girlfriend... got 4 different cupcakes.  Yummy!  I highly recommend the chocolate marshmallow :),UNK
10886,"Very helpful staff.  Very nice facility.  Great products, loved the tour. So much info about olives that I never knew.  Totally would do it again.",UNK
10887,"I am absolutely wild about their garlic pepper chicken. I have it almost every time I go, which has been quite a few times. Love the view out the big windows, love the decor, love the service. A Phoenix treasure!",UNK
10888,"Excellent meal and high quality service.  Had an excellent chicken and fries meal and a fantastic salad.  Though this was way better than Joel Robuchon.  Also, much chiller with nice bar dining area if you are not interested in a table or doing Vegas solo.",UNK
10889,"I made my first visit here this past weekend and I have to say the food is legit.  Some of the healthiest eats around town.  Sandwiches and shakes are amazing.  Don't waste your time going to Subway or Panera, eat fresh local produce at Presto!!",UNK
10890,"This place was fantastic! We had the beef and kafta kanob meals, hummus, lentil soup and baklava. Everything was so fresh and delicious.  Nice atmosphere and excellent service. The servers made it even more enjoyable for us. We highly recommend and will be back!",UNK
10891,"The food was OK, mccallisters is better but I would go back.  It's the same type of atmosphere.  They were very busy but they took care of us.",UNK
10892,Pretty darn tasty but you better like Carne Asada as it's damn near the only thing on the menu.  Yes that's an exaggeration but the menu is ridiculously limited and nothing but pork and beef.  The horchata is excellent.,UNK
10893,"It's a good place of you love MSG and food that tastes all the same. The only dishes I enjoyed were the fried squid and the noodles/veggie plate. Besides that, whether you eat pepper beef or pineapple shrimp, it all tastes alike. Not impressed",UNK
10894,maybe not what you are looking for but a good introduction to find out\nI tried two times...once at lunch...and once for BBQ dinner....both meals were interesting....neither was bad...but neither was great....3 sums it up,UNK
10895,Yummy breakfast.  Wait is as expected.  I ordered the portugese sausage hawaiian breakfast because other than in Hawaii this is the only place I have been able to find it.  It is a whole sausage they don't skimp.  Good food!,UNK
10896,My life would be incomplete without this place. My husband and i go weekly in the summer for tacos. The grocery store is great for specialty items for a decent price that you would otherwise pay much more for in a larger grocery store.,UNK
10897,A great place to stay if your in town for a game. Within walking distance of everything. The rooms aren't that bad either.,UNK
10898,Came here two guests from India - pretty dead around midnight. Ordered some chicken item and tofu soup. Soup was good so is the chicken. \n\nServer was very good - she served us extra appetizer ( korean small plates with veggi).,UNK
10899,"The hostess seated us fairly quickly, and I like the outside tables. Our waiter was rude, and didn't really take care of us, but it's open 24-7. Important in VEGAS.",UNK
10900,"This is the most stellar restaurant in Charlotte. It is my go-to place for great cheese, amazing wood-grilled meats, and good wine. The waiters really know their stuff. Try the duck confit or hanger steak for entrees and macaroni and cheese or corn for sides.",UNK
10901,"Caterpillar roll BBQ eel and Hass avocado, honey walnut shrimp and combination fried rice, Vietnamese shrimp pho.  Pricey for so so food.  Suggest going to Sushi Fever or Sushi Tower and Steakhouse.",UNK
10902,"Great lunch and amazing service.  Their smoked brisket sandwich was incredible.  Plus their patio is perfectly covered and comes with misters, which will make this a great place to stop by during the summer.",UNK
10903,"Alright spot, service was okay, and food was mediocre.  Probably will opt for Zipps next time across the street.",UNK
10904,Didn't review when I ate there and felt ill. Who knows? I might have been sliding downhill before I went to dinner...so I didn't want to unfairly hang it on them. But now...hmmm. I am sure they will undergo a thorough review before they reopen.,UNK
10905,I have only ordered take out twice but the thin crust pizza is amazing!!  What I am most impressed by is the customer service.  Great people on the phone and great service when I pick up my pizza.  My new favorite pizza place.,UNK
10906,"I had the fish tacos, hubby had a bacon cheeseburger, and the kids had corn dogs. The fish tacos were very tasty!",UNK
10907,Positive: fast and accurate service. Close to my office. \n\nNegative: Nothing ever tastes right. The fries are limp and the frosties have an odd taste and texture. The chili is served the wrong side of warm.,UNK
10908,This place is in a mall so it's hard to park and go upstairs but the food was fine\nWe ordered the candy crush roll which was way too sweet but the Toro roll was just excellent and the fried rice could have used some more stuff in it.. only some chunks of beef and that was it.,UNK
10909,"Good burger, but pricey.  Skimpy sides.  Shaky service.  Very shaky service...  I'm probably not going back.  Five Guys is a much better option and right across the street.",UNK
10910,Didn't really fancy this casino.  Small and didn't have any slots that I wanted to play.  I really like the facade of this casino.  It is really swell.,UNK
10911,"Honestly the food is good.  I have to give this review because the person behind the counter is staring at me while I eat and I can feel their hate for me coming off in waves.  I'm not sure why, but I'm positive he is imagining my death. \n\nAlso the table is really sticky.",UNK
10912,Best garlic knots and pizza in Las Vegas.  I drive all the way from south Las Vegas to come eat this pizza.\n\nThey have the nicest staff and amazing food!,UNK
10913,"We made a reservation on a Monday night about 2 hours before, and got a great table - half inside, half-outside with a great view of the Bellagio fountain. We really lucked out. The steak with bleu cheese was excellent. The place has been there for 11 years and there's a reason. Highly recommend.",UNK
10914,"Room was better than I expected given all of the rave reviews on yelp ! The room was clean and what can you expect for 35 bucks per night . Plus, when in Vegas you are not supposed to live in your room. \""Change clothes then go\""",UNK
10915,"I've been to this place a few times before, they're always friendly and have a good selection of food.  Overall great food and great service.",UNK
10916,"Yep, Tony is on it with this one.  Great menu.  Crowd is really cool, not at all stuck up or showy.  Low key.  Great place to hang out late night.  Great place to eat in the early evening.",UNK
10917,"Went in on a Saturday late afternoon, not sure if they were made the day prior but the 3 cupcakes my daughter and I got were all dry and even HARD on the edges. obviously stale. what a waste to pay $3 a cupcake for stale, DRY cupcakes.  so disappointed!.",UNK
10918,"I really wanted to like this place.  The people working there seemed quite cordial.  It is convenient to both work and home.  But I just couldn't get there.  The ambiance is nil, and the food is average.  Let's just call it an adequate feeding trough at a reasonable price.",UNK
10919,Lieu un peu trop bruyant \u00e0 mon gout mais excellente poutine ! Les cocktails ont l'air top !,UNK
10920,"Another excellent breakfast! I know they have other food, but I can't get past the green chili chicken hash. It's delicious! Service was great with a lovely table out on the patio. Can't say enough about how great this place is.",UNK
10921,"I love the new flavors including salted carmel, butter finger, and cookies and creme. But they no longer take American Express? What a small minded business Blunder...",UNK
10922,Mediocre food. Unlimited eating for $30 per day. Go to Belagio buffet for lunch at 3pm instead. $20. Much better. \\,UNK
10923,"LOVE this place. Great prices,  awesome food, great service... I'm so happy this place is 2 minutes from my place!!!!!!",UNK
10924,Try the frangia. I saw a review that it was weak but I ordered it anyways and it was far from it! Good deal on the strip. Good place to people watch if you sit outside. Food is good too but the frangia was the best. =),UNK
10925,"We had a great experience.  Service, food and view were excellent.  The bread with tapenade was delicious.  We both ordered specials, free range turkey and lamb chops, and thoroughly enjoyed.  Wish that I had room for dessert! Sabine was our server, she was very attentive.  We will definitely return.",UNK
10926,"good place for a quick Guinness, or grab a patio seat\n\nfood is good, their Rachael is worth ordering (to-go especially)\n\nA good neighborhood joint!",UNK
10927,"HOLY Moly!!! WOW, this dude knows his stuff!! Every single one of the dips we tried we fell in love with.  And everything but one was Gluten-Free!!!  The Tzatziki was my fav & he makes GF chips :)",UNK
10928,"Horrible the worst service. No take out. Terrible attitude. No English speaking. Totally annyoing place. When I ate there the food was below average and no substitutes. Just the worst service, unfriendly, no coffee, no refills, mean waitresses. Hated it!",UNK
10929,"Went here on a Sunday afternoon, and only one employee was working. The line was long, but she kept her attitude up and got through everyone's orders flawlessly. \n\nClean restaurant, clean bathrooms, good lacation.",UNK
10930,"If you're looking for somewhere to watch a game on tv... Keep looking. Walked in & right back out.. Very smokey, nothing special, & prices weren't worth toughing it out for.",UNK
10931,"The environment was very untraditional since its a vacated church. The food options were a good reflection of what's popular in Pittsburgh. I ordered the Pot Pie, which was good. However, I wasn't particularly impressed with the food.",UNK
10932,Cheap place to stay. Good location but that's about it- HEAVY smokers in this hotel and little to do other than gamble. Charge for gym use (as a guest paying to stay) is an extra $25 per person per day. This place needs a clean up!,UNK
10933,"Great Que, and great service. Greens were great, Mac was great. Only complaint was that everything was drenched in sauce. I'll ask for it on the side next time.",UNK
10934,I love my espresso machine and the coffee but the staff in this shop\nbehave like snobs and it's unnecessary. They aren't selling $4000 hand bags they are selling coffee. These people need a serious attitude adjustment. I'd rather order on-line.,UNK
10935,"our wedding at mon bel ami was personal, professional, the photography was outstanding. I felt like a princess from beginning to end!!'",UNK
10936,"High price for only so-so food.  I didn't bother staying for the Flamenco dancer... the poor atmosphere was a turn off (large empty room, shabby decor).  One positive: the service was friendly and responsive.",UNK
10937,"Very nice restaurant, our server Matt was friendly, genuine and knowledgeable.  The food was great, the mac and cheese was amazing (we try it at every restaurant we go to), cant wait to go back!",UNK
10938,"Not that great, didn't even get to stick around for NFG when our friend got thrown out for BREAKING UP A FIGHT. Can't believe I paid $20 for that.",UNK
10939,I have tried a few tanning salons in Vegas and this is by far my favorite. The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable of the beds and the products that they sell. You almost never have to wait for a bed and the monthly package prices are reasonable.,UNK
10940,"I woke up a week before my marathon so sore I could barely move. I needed help. After reading the positive review here on yelp, I went to my first chiropractic visit. Like others have said, Dr. Conway was knowledgeable, professional and took away the pain in one visit!",UNK
10941,This was one of the worst Chinese food meals I've ever had. Diabetics should steer clear of the General Tao chicken -- it would be less sugary if they just doused it in maple syrup. I've had better food out of a catering truck at half the price.,UNK
10942,"The burger was amazing, it was cooked perfectly. They have a lot of different ones to choose form as well, definitely one of the best burgers I have had in Charlotte. It was crowded but we were able to sit in the bar area no problem. Outside patio area looked nice as well, good for a cool summer evening.",UNK
10943,"Basic hotel. U pay for what u get. There is a resort fee, but I didn't get to use any resort amenities while I was there. Not bad  of a place though. Hallways in the pyramid freak me out though (if you are scared of heights)",UNK
10944,"WOW!!! Amazing service.  I came in and ordered 24 custom shirts on Wednesday, then Daniel, the owner, called me at 3 the next day to say they were done.  Affordable, honest, quick, and professional.  They have all mu printing business forever!@",UNK
10945,"Try them for the first time and it was pretty good, my kids love the chicken tender. Service was fast and friendly. Everything on menu are bar food.",UNK
10946,"I've been here a few times. Love the teachers. Downside is its a little pricey and they don't really have a membership type of package. Also, because the rooms don't have \""walls\"" you can here the music going on from other classes. Friendly staff and nice teachers.",UNK
10947,"Very clean, quiet & new apartments! I never ever hear my neighbors & the maintenance staff always shows up within the same day. The owners are committed to the place, as evidenced by them having all the roofing in the complex redone this summer & upgrading the gym equipment. Love my apt! :-)",UNK
10948,Gerry's talent is something that has to be seen to believe. Highly suggest getting tickets if you're looking for a value show instead of the expensive ones.,UNK
10949,"Earth burger was absolutely fantastic. However, the service was below average at best. Go for the food, not the service and you'll be fine.",UNK
10950,I only come here to see Jet! He's been doing my nails for years and i love him because he puts so much effort into the details that my pedicure will last a month!  Ask for him when you come!,UNK
10951,"It was ok. I think most of the cupcakes are buttercream. Prefer more icing than buttercream. But hey, if that's your preference this is the place to go for you!",UNK
10952,"I wish I could tell you how the food was. We were sat on a Sunday afternoon around two, and after twenty minutes of not seeing our waitress, we left.",UNK
10953,I am not a fan of buffets. Had brunch here while visiting my family.  Really average all around. Nothing memorable. Just lots of boring food with little taste.,UNK
10954,"The pictures looked tasty but when you eat it, it's not all that great at all. Soggy fries and almost cold burger is what I got from this joint. Maybe its just this spot and it could be different from another joint but in the end its all not that great.",UNK
10955,It's burger king! If you don't know about it....try it. Their Burgers are good but their milkshakes are better! Try a milkshake! Then go play slot machines!,UNK
10956,"We just went here this past saturday with a party of 8. I would have to say that the overall food was good but, nowhere near the quality of Ocean Club in Kierland commons.",UNK
10957,"I really like the deco of this place, but the service and quality of the food didn't justified what I had to pay.  We had to remind our waiter two out of five orders did not come.  Food quality was average.  I live one mile away of this tapas, wouldn't go there again.",UNK
10958,I live in North Carolina and come all the way out to see Topher Miller to get my hair done in Tempe. I have NEVER had so many compliments on my cut and color as I have in the past year. Topher is FANTASTIC and I recommend him for anyone looking for a stylist!,UNK
10959,"I like this place. Very friendly staff and it has always seemed pretty clean to me. I like the seat massagers and hot moist towels for my feet! They always have clean tools, very sanitary!",UNK
10960,Food was good.  Took much longer than I expected.  Watched drive thru line get food before me (2 cars) and the lady behind me got her food first too.  Ordered bacon burger and fries ... nothin fancy or special ordered.  Wont come here if I have limited time.,UNK
10961,"Good service, quick ticket time and live music on the Saturday I ate here. The food quality didn't blow my mind, but it was definitely above average. I would come back.",UNK
10962,"Champagne brunch is phenomenal value ($16 w/ SP card for unlimited food and champ). We come out here from the strip on Saturday morning for brunch, champagne, and some relaxed gambling on low min tables until going back to the strip for the evening.\nGreat sportsbook, too.",UNK
10963,"The best. I love their drunken noodle and pineapple fried rice dishes. The owners are a husband wife duo, she is from Thailand and handles the cooking. Cute little place to get together with friends or for a romantic night out... the food is excellent, the prices are right, and it's BYOB!",UNK
10964,"The service is always very good.\nPrices seem to be about the same where ever you go, so IMO it's pretty much about service and convenience.\nPolo definitely delivers.",UNK
10965,"Excellent. Clean, quiet, humidity controlled air, relaxing scents, good massage. It is in an old shopping center, but worth the trip.",UNK
10966,"Terrible. Other than cold beer and good chips & salsa, there's not much to like here. I think they need a new manager or better management training.",UNK
10967,"Food was pretty tasty and the waitress was very nice and friendly... Overall, if I'm really hungry and in the mood for sushi, would probably come back...",UNK
10968,Starbucks is Starbucks is Starbucks. If it wasn't like $9 for a muffin and a smoothie I'd go here more often.,UNK
10969,Cant complain about anything here......Excellent  is the word I would use to describe my experience. Try the hummus and the pickled vegis are a great addition.,UNK
10970,Madison's most quaint and romantic little italian bistro (there aren't that many of them).  Their wine cellar has a very extensive beer and wine list.,UNK
10971,"Love this place.  Great food. Great service.  Kids love it.  I know I have said it before, mac and cheese dogs, come on!",UNK
10972,Honestly as I was eating the burger it wasn't even that good. Def not worth $20. The second I left I felt sick. Nonstop vom for days. It was the first place I went to off the plane ruined my whole trip. DO NOT EAT HERE MADE ME A VEG,UNK
10973,"Meh, don't know what all the fuss is about. I'm from Michigan where we have something similar called Potbellys. Hot and cold sandwiches on a toasted bun. The soups suck, don't waste your money.",UNK
10974,"Food was good, service not so good. Was happy they had biscuits. \nDidn't have to wait,   which is great, but do think they need to understand customer service better.",UNK
10975,"3.8/5 Stars - Pizza was better than average but didn't blow me away. Service was outstanding, but I can't include that in the rating. Had really good happy hour prices which I do include in the rating. Would go back a second time and try the pasta.",UNK
10976,The watermelon gelato was heavenly and very refreshing but it also cost an arm and a leg....$4 for ONE scoop!! what a rip off. So go if you're willing to splurge on gelato.,UNK
10977,Great place.\n\nI really enjoyed the open WiFi. I was able to get work done and grab lunch. I wouldn't hesitate to go again.,UNK
10978,"I lump this along with the IP as a cheap and bearable place to stay. I also have to give it props for being the hotel that I won 1100 bucks at playing roulette. Being drunk and gambling sometimes does pay off, kiddies!",UNK
10979,"One of my favorite sushi places in town. The sushi is generally very fresh, and it's generally decent quality. The prices are competitive and the fact that you can eat immediately upon entering is great. The atmosphere is fine and the service speaks better English than many Chinese restaurants, but not better than most sushi joints.",UNK
10980,Veggie sandwich is delicious. Love the sweet potato fries.  I cannot complain about a sports bar that carries La Crema Pinot Noir just for me!,UNK
10981,"Over priced. Grumpy driver. I could get 2 subs at Jimmy Johns for the price they charged me. The dessert (Cheese cake) sub parr...thick bread, hardly any meat. I do not recommend it.",UNK
10982,"Food is fantastic but service at times can be slow. They usually only have 1-2 people fuming the floor, not enough.",UNK
10983,A very sad visit when last night I found out they have removed it from Circus Circus. One of the best bars for a good look back as LV history. Also a Fear and Loathing must visit spot is gone. For those who make the homage to this area the gorilla is also gone.,UNK
10984,The food here has great variety and is quite good. Prepare to stand in line to get in during peak hours. Try the ice cream it is terrific!,UNK
10985,"Meh... overpriced and service is just so so. The decor and seating is nice and plush though, but I guess that's what you're paying for. Food was ok.",UNK
10986,Solid Pizza at a fair price.\n\nI get this for work a lot and have found the quality to be consistent.  It's not the greatest pie ever but for the price it's good and the pies area good size.,UNK
10987,"I love that they are now at Canyon Ridge church on weekends, they have a great grinds, the coffee is so good, get a jolt of energy.   woot woooooooo",UNK
10988,"Best experience at a car wash in a very long time treated the kids fantastic treated my car like it was their own.  Nice job team, MJB",UNK
10989,I love this place My father loved this place! You guys rock ! The mac and cheese great pulled pork great! Thank you for the great food!,UNK
10990,Super spendy but the only thing open late with Vegan options. The brussell sprout and potato pizza was pretty self-explanatory and nothing special. Great service though.,UNK
10991,Just like all the other expensive buffets in Vegas. Can people really tell the difference between this place and Bellagio?\n\nI dare you to finish one of their candy apples.,UNK
10992,"Loved it! Great vibe, excellent service. We had a wonderful meal and even better drinks! The cocktails alone are worth the visit - amazing! Excellent choice for food and drinks in Montreal!",UNK
10993,"Breakfast was good! Everyone was really nice and friendly. On your way to the bathrooms, you will be able to see the chefs at work. It's nice that you can see how they are preparing the food. The bathrooms are pretty cool as well! I recommend it. The French toast was delicious!",UNK
10994,"There food speaks for itself !!!!!!!!!!\n  Very wonderful family run Chinese restaurant. My Boyfriend and I where looking for a new place to try and we picked Mr Beijing and the min. we walked in they where so nice and friendly, and the food was GREAT and you get a lot of food!",UNK
10995,I'm from the south.\nI found the menu choices to be limited.  The food is only okay.  \nThe food is definitely overpriced.\n\nThe Friday live music is nice though.,UNK
10996,If you like fancy rubber this place is awesome! I even got some soy ice cream (which normally I am a huge fan of) and it tastes like mud pies after a rainy day near a sewer.,UNK
10997,Great coffee. Free refills just keep your receipt. Hazelnut coffee?! with more hazelnut? I'm in heaven. I also got bottom of the pot coffee and my mouth is tingling from the caffeine. LOL. The bagels here are also worth the price.,UNK
10998,Great meal tonight...only wish my sweetheart was with me as the place is a home that was converted into a quaint romantic restaurant. Calamari is excellent!,UNK
10999,"Great spot close to my house. Definitely get the $20 all you can eat as you will spend more if you order a la carte. Great BBQ, kinda fusion. Fresh fish and meat.",UNK
11000,Some of the portions are ridiculously small and they are somewhat overpriced. I was not impressed and I have been there twice.,UNK
11001,"We just stopped here as Slices no longer exits at TMP :(\n\nFor JUST cold meat sandwiches...they are over priced. Short variety and more than $3 for some salame, cheese in average white bread.....no thank you.",UNK
11002,One of the BEST happy hours around!  Staff is very friendly and so are the customers....  you have to try the chicken nachos and pizza!!1,UNK
11003,"Terribly maintained. The greens are worn and ripped all over the place. Nice layout, but I just had to shake my head at how poorly maintained this place was. It was as if management never took a look. Just awful.",UNK
11004,"I got the Sac'n'crack service and have to say I was very comfortable and treated very nice by the staff. I believe it was Bree who was doing my service. She was totally cool relaxed, great convo, didn't take that long, and it wasn't as painful as I thought. And very worth it!",UNK
11005,"Both times we have been there have been very enjoyable. We knew what to expect, a nice and slightly snooty wine bar. And we were happy! They have beer, and handcrafted cocktails as well. The bar menu is limited  to charcuterie platters, but they are very very good!",UNK
11006,"The service was excellent. Jennifer was the server. I had the lodge breakfast with andouille sausage and coffee $12.22 without tip. The potatoes were just ok, the sausage was disappointing. I'd try someplace else for breakfast, but if you do come here, the service will be good. The food is mediocre.",UNK
11007,The staff is every nice and they have a large gel color selection but nail tech did a terrible job. Kim is a very sweet girl but my nails have never hurt after a mani before won't ever go back to that nail tech again. Also a little too pricey especially when your not receiving excellent skill service.,UNK
11008,"Okay branch.  No drive-thru window, only drive-thru ATM.  Two ATM's outside the branch side-by-side.  Forever to do my deposits as the tellers are working very slowly.  I think I'll skip this branch from now on.",UNK
11009,For $7.50 it's a great value.  This is my first time here & I had the Miso ramen.  It was very salty and I had to ask for water to tone it down.  The ramen was nothing special but the pork slice included was tender and tastes good.,UNK
11010,This was a nice surprise. Was not expecting much but the staff was friendly and the food was good. Very much a mexican style southwest cafe. Not a huge amount to eat for kids or vegetarians but overall a good option when nearby.,UNK
11011,"I like to get away from the Starbucks chain every now and than since I AM from Washington state. ;0D I really enjoyed my Iced White chocolate Mocha here! The customer service was good, very attentive, and a well made drink! No complaints from me!",UNK
11012,"This is a pretty average coffee place. The owner is super friendly and the coffee is good enough that I have no complaints. There is food available though it wasn't the most terrific. I'll definitely stop by again, because it is definitely worth stopping by when in the area.",UNK
11013,Food was blah service was great. The gnocchi with filet tips was fatty and tasted old the gnocchi was over cooked. Risotto balls were similar to something in the frozen food isle. The couple next to me sent everything back to the kitchen.,UNK
11014,Was just passing through town and stopped on a whim.  The food was excellent and a full serving.  The service was great.  Clean and friendly.  I wish I could visit more often!,UNK
11015,"Went there for Christmas vacation and the Buffet was not good.  Food was not fresh, paid extra for the Holiday buffet, but it was worse than Denny's restaurant and costs 3X as much.  Our waiter was nice, but it was not worth $40 for dinner per person.",UNK
11016,Get the jalapeno cheddar grits. You will NOT be disappointed. Tasty food. Little on pricey side but it's Scottsdale.,UNK
11017,"hard to rate a massage place, seeing as they definitely make you feel better than when you came in. it should be \""yes\"" or \""no\"" rating. whatever the case, the mo membership is worth it.",UNK
11018,"Our favorite family place to go out to dinner! The people are so kind, even making my son a special \""face\"" dessert! Feel good about eating out!",UNK
11019,"Nice Giant Eagle, not as nice as their new Market Districts, but you can look at this Giant Eagle and see how they came up with the Market District Idea and rolled with it. Fresh made sushi, good cheese selection, awesome bakery.",UNK
11020,"Authentic NY pizza and fantastic Italian food. I have eaten pizza all over the United Stares and this ranks with some of the best! If you're in Goodyear,AZ stop by and try or for yourself.",UNK
11021,"I just love Lux. It is one of those places that is an iconoclastic phoenix gem. The wonderful teas, coffees, yummy eats, fabulous music and eclectic crowd make it this the best spot in town. I do wish they did a few more gluten free treats :)",UNK
11022,They gave me an occupied room to start. No free Internet access like most Hilton brands I use. No free breakfast with nerve to ask $13 for the buffet. Bathtub drain was broke. It's a nice clean comfy place to sleep. But today's markets demand key amenities like Internet and breakfast.,UNK
11023,"Great breakfast restaurant near Desert Ridge in North Phoenix--good natural, organic food.  Had chorizo and eggs, great presentation and absolutely delicious!\n\nWill be back for dinner service and can't wait to sample some organic wines!",UNK
11024,I really like this place. Service is good & food is great. We've been for dinner & brunch. What a unique place for brunch! Excellent selection. We will definitely be back.,UNK
11025,"Very slow. Waited for about 4 min before someone would take our order, and it took 5 more min to get kids smoothie. Other Jambas we're in and out in less than 5 min.",UNK
11026,"Bummed - this place had good salads and great soup options, but went for lunch about three days ago and the place has closed down.  Boo.  \n\nFingers crossed it's temporary?",UNK
11027,"The terrace is always full. Get there early. The lineup  is worth the wait. New \""porchetta\"" sandwich is a winner. Just like Mama's home cooking. Dog-friendly. We brought our dogs and they brought water for them. How nice is that!",UNK
11028,Would never go back and never recommend.  Just paid $542 at our regular vet today ( Friday ) to fix the bad neuter they did Monday. My poor dog was in so much pain. Never. Again.,UNK
11029,What a great place to have in Surprise! I finally stopped by New York Flavor yesterday and was greeted with the friendly staff. I ordered the cheesesteak and fries and it was fresh and delicious! The atmosphere was great and I will definitely come back.,UNK
11030,The food is good but takes for ever  the bartenders are so rude and so was the server I asked for ranch for my fries and she said is there anything else I don't want to go back and forth a bunch of times rude rude rude,UNK
11031,"Worst pool service ever.  Not accommodating, horrible customer service, and disrespectful staff.  I would never recommend these guys to anyone!",UNK
11032,"Confused about the low reviews.  We have a lot of different asian restaurants in NorCal that we go to, and I thought this place was awesome.  The hand stretched noodle bowls were awesome.  We actually went back for a second meal during our 4-day stay.\nRecommended!",UNK
11033,Beer garden was nice. The inside section seemed like being in a warehouse.  Didn't have the Vegas look I expected.  Staff was unfriendly. Took forever to get our drinks & she messed up the 1st round too!,UNK
11034,"Been going here for over 6 years now. Owners and staff are honest & genuine. Doesn't matter if you are spending $100 or $10K, you will get the same level of service every time. They also pay top dollar for gold.",UNK
11035,Great cheese steak.  Add the hot peppers and the sweet peppers and the mushrooms.    Italian sub is a good second choice.,UNK
11036,Meal was so so at best. Had tomahawk ribeye which was raved by the waiter. The ribeye was like $70 and didn't meet my expectations. We'd a table of 15 and barely got service. Very disappointed.,UNK
11037,When you enter Yummys you're greeted by the chefs That is always very important to me. The service is great. The food is so good. The presentation is beautiful. Great experience. I will continue to come back here and recommend to others. Thanks Yummy!,UNK
11038,"We will never go back.  Everything we ordered was either overly spicy, grainy, or bland.  The chili rellenos were soggy.  The onions were burnt.  We were so disappointed because it is so close to home!  YUCK!",UNK
11039,"I have never seen one of the Dr's. here, but I have always gotten excellent care from their awesome PA's. I will certainly be back as it was easy to get in and get an appointment.",UNK
11040,"I had the salmon and he had the pasta with chicken, both were great, make sure you say hi to Jackson he's great, oh and ask for Mathew at the bar outside.",UNK
11041,Decided to try this place for fun....the food was GREAT...had the chili cheese tots....awesome.  The burgers were tasty and seasoned well.   We will go back for sure!!,UNK
11042,"Great spot to stay at if your looking for a no thrills, no frills off the main strip and in the heart of the Fremont Street experience.",UNK
11043,"What you gonna do? It's fast food. Very basic and devoid of character.  The only saving grace here is the communal salsa bar.  Sure fine, this place is alright, not disgusting or the best ever.  Just as average as you can get.",UNK
11044,"Great experience. My salesperson, Marion, was super helpful. Got quite a few cute things; many of which she picked out for me which is what I need!",UNK
11045,"Great service, great food. Get the queso and quac. This place is excellent:) their portions are large but the service is on point too. Affordable date night or bring the kids.",UNK
11046,"Food was not good. It's all mushed together & you have to disassemble their \""presentation.\"" I wouldn't go back at all.",UNK
11047,Awesome cheep food. Great steak special. You get a whole meal and a beer for the price of a beer on the strip. Metro pizza is awesome too.,UNK
11048,"Good quality \""new\"" American food with twists. Enjoyed this place a lot. Limited menu selection (for my tastes) is the only thing holding back a fifth star.",UNK
11049,Super slow service and the food was so-so. Great place if your a student with lots of time to study and not a lot of cash on you.,UNK
11050,"Good overall quality, a nice selection, and they deliver to my office. I tried the crab puffs and the sampler platter for my last order. The egg drop soup is especially good with a side of crispy noodles. You can order via Grub-hub.",UNK
11051,"Although the employees are kind, this place is a mess. Poor location and ridiculously expensive. They didn't even have fish and chips on their menu. I think the man himself needs to clean this place up.",UNK
11052,worst restaurant ever!!!!  hostesses were rude.  service was terrible-they threw the bread on the table-literally threw it.  food was disgusting and way over priced (both ordered seafood).  i would never come back nor recommend this place to anyone.  go somewhere else!!!!,UNK
11053,"one extra star because they are consistent, well priced and chicken tempura and chicken teriyaki are tastey. this is my go to spot when i want something cheap and \""asian\""",UNK
11054,"84.5.  That's their health sanitation score!  Eater beware.  I used to love this place but they constantly have poor sanitation scores. I can't eat here anymore, for my own GI health.",UNK
11055,"My new favorite hotel for vegas! I was pleasantly surprised when I got my room. They gave me a view of the Bellagio fountains which was amazing. I was there with many friends and they had parking lot views, so they came to my room to watch the fountains. Will definitely return next vegas trip!",UNK
11056,Very good quality sushi and I love the Robata grilling technique very flavorful meats and veggies.  Definitely a great place to check out.  The service is always friendly as well.,UNK
11057,KFC as a whole is just not worth the money. This store sells you overcooked hours old chicken to boot. Frys has better chicken. So sad.,UNK
11058,Great food and plenty to choose from. However the salad bar was very small and not a lot of options. \n\nWait was not to long and the cashiers were very engaging which was nice. \n\nwill be back. one of the better buffets in town. a little pricey.,UNK
11059,"Great gym. Has everything you need plus more. Staff is super friendly. Plus they got a cardio theater, that shit is baller.\nIf you complain about how packed the gym is at certain times, hand stamps, and an occasional faulty machine then go do crossfit.",UNK
11060,"Lisa is an amazing therapist and a lovely person.  I've been having some chronic back and muscle issues, and plain massage therapy was getting me nowhere, but Lisa is a magician.  I've seen her twice now, and she's done an awesome job finding and alleviating my pain. Highly recommended.",UNK
11061,"I love Mojo. The only downfall would be that they are a little expensive compared to other do it yourself yogurt shops around town. However, you can sample to your hearts desire which is awesome! SO GOOD!",UNK
11062,"Excellent, beautiful custom iron work.  Jorge is very professional and got my security gates completed in a short amount of time (he said 3 weeks but had the job done in less than 2).  Highly recommended!",UNK
11063,Over priced beer. Second rate food. Beer came after my appetiZer and main dish were delivered = poor service. What's to like? I'd go hungry before eating here again.,UNK
11064,It's comparatively much better than most other buffets I've tried in neighbor hotels. A little expensive but worth every penny if you have a good appetite:),UNK
11065,Score ethnic food! I will say that I love their hummus. It's very tasty as well as their pitas (which appear to be sold all over the city). The staff is friendly and helpful and they have many things that you can't find anywhere else.,UNK
11066,"Was back in town for a weekend and went to the bank to make a deposit.  To my surprise, this location is Open Sunday!  Wow, I lived nearby for over 4 yrs and never knew that!  Good stuff.\n\nReturn Factor - 100%",UNK
11067,Water is great!! Perfectly cooled and nicely filtered. The fish on the other hand was dry and way over seasoned. And they don't have a option to order double meat made me pay for another meal.,UNK
11068,"The high pressure sales tactics before and after totally ruined my massage. Can't I just pay for a massage, get a massage and be left alone. It felt like a used car lot.",UNK
11069,This place was delicious. They just didn't have any of the beers I wanted. They said they ran out of my selections. That's why I only gave 4 stars.,UNK
11070,"Crickets chirp, chirp, chirp... Seems pretty touristy but I did find a candy shop with Mallo Cups! MMMMM , And a shop with a ton of Steeler Apparel.",UNK
11071,Rene and Mavis are amazing at costumer service. Be careful to return on time tho. They are super strict on time of return.,UNK
11072,"I called for pricing and although their prices are very reasonable I will be using another limo service for our roundtrip from the airport to the hotel, in Las Vegas.  I found the young lady who gave me the information slightly rude and unprofessional.",UNK
11073,Came here with my girl.  She got the bahn mi dog and I got the angry dog.  Both were amazing!  I recommend stopping in at least once especially if you like spicy stuff.  Also the bulgogi on the fries was killer as well :),UNK
11074,Place is a cute little beer bar! Great beer selection too. Our server megan was really nice and helpful! We had the hummus and the pretzel pizzas and they were both really tasty!,UNK
11075,Scale of 1-10 (single visit):\n8 Food\n9 Service\n9 Atmosphere\n7 Value,UNK
11076,"nice, but kinda pricy for that quality... well since it's at Hilton, should see that coming. btw, the cheese there is really tasty, I bought some extra to enjoy back home.",UNK

11078,"I judge a bbq place by a couple of menu items.  First, hot links.  Lucille's are not good.  They're not hot and they're kinda mealy.  Second, beans.  Lucille's beans have too many other things in them.  Big chunks of undercooked veggies.  Not good.",UNK
11079,"The worse Bun Bo Hue and bad com Bo Luc Lac, rice is dried,  Bun Bo Hue tasteless.  Not recommended.",UNK
11080,"Got their chocolate cream pie, the filling was very yummy! The crust wasn't amazing but it did the job. $5.50 for a mini pie that can be shared and saved for later. Looking forward to trying the key lime pie next time!",UNK
11081,"Best place u could have breaksfast at. don't expect much on the services, coz everybody is busy. they could forget to give u ur drink, which they did to me. but that doesn't matter, I was there for food, not the service.",UNK
11082,"Ordered the spicy peanut tofu, picnic salad and lemon pesto bowl with tofu, brown rice and vegetables and it was amazing!! The staff was very friendly and the restaurant had a great vibe to it! Highly recommend and not too expensive! Currently moving to Tempe so I will be back soon!",UNK
11083,"Poor service, crap steak ($52 for a 1/2 inch thick ribeye?) and merger  wine pours - the Brussels sprouts were really good but, gimme a break here....this sucked for the money spent. Avoid.",UNK
11084,"If I can give 0 stars I would. This place has no organization. The wait time is always if not longer 2-4 hours dr. Flanagan is really nice but the hens that work there either need to work or lay that egg  cause the wait is very, very bad. Will be definitely changing centers ASAP",UNK
11085,We're back the very next night! Our beautiful server is Julie. We HAD to have smoked whisky again with those DTF surf and turf sliders. We also tried the bacon wrapped bacon - YUM!,UNK
11086,"Good prices, awesome staff! Not rude or pushy.. Always willing to help and answer questions. Truly a one of a kind shop with awesome products and accessories!",UNK
11087,Was quite a bit of a wait......BUT it was well worth the wait.  The entire meal was Freakin Delicious!   Would definitely come back to Vegas just to try other menu items.,UNK
11088,I love shopping here!  They always have the cutest clothes & accessories at the best prices & they work hard to make sure you are happy with your purchase by showing you the best to dress up or down an outfit...this is a must see location!  Great staff & atmosphere!,UNK
11089,"Great place to spend an afternoon eating and listening to music.  Places to go is the Taco place and BQ Joint and the places NOT go, the bar BOOZERY, JO JOs Beefjerky and Pork bean, these places are over priced.",UNK
11090,Cute little place to get iced coffee near my hotel. Friendly employees. \n\nMy only complaints were no Equal (sugar or sweet n lo only) and no fresh fruit!,UNK
11091,"5 stars, this place is as good as it gets! I drive 30 minutes to come here! Best donuts I've  had in my life!",UNK
11092,"Great place great service Michelle is an amazing Waitress,  you will given great service for sure if you are fortunate enough to have her as your waitress!",UNK
11093,"A Montreal classic that is worth a visit at least once. Orange Julep is definitely the star, but hotdog with poutine wasn't bad.",UNK
11094,"Decor-5.  \nManicurist's Manner-5.  \nCleanliness and Health Consciousness-5+\nCreativity and Ability-5\nSo, be sure to call in advance as they are popular.",UNK
11095,A little dirty and could be a little nicer of a place to put the shop in but otherwise - all games were in good condition and playable.  I did enjoy the old school (50's era) pinball machines.  Cultural goldmine and this place will only get more popular in the future.,UNK
11096,"The Good: easy parking, good food, good service\nThe Bad: location is so-so\nThe Ugly: hmmm, I would have said the decor, except that its so bad it sort of comes full circle back to cool, or something...",UNK
11097,"When you order two pizza at the same time and they are given to you at one time with one undercooked and one overlooked, that takes talent.  This place has talent.  I love CPK, but need food to be consistently well prepared.",UNK
11098,"Great food, friendly staff! We had the papaya salad and mussumun, both were great. The fried papaya appetizer was really interesting.",UNK
11099,"I went in for Italian meats and cookies around noon and there was hardly anything in the whole place! No pastries, very few meats, and nasty looking cookies. Uhhh no thanks, sorry I drove all that way for nothing.",UNK
11100,"Tom Yum Soup here-need I say more! Packed with lots of Seafood and generous portion, says two but we had multiple bowls. I went with the shrimp pad Thai-delicious. The decor is casual but with a modern simplicity.  Bar in front with lots of good looking young people and you can eat there too.",UNK
11101,"I have been to Carrabba's at least 4 times and have taken food out two or three times. I normally will not eat at a chain. This place is just too good to be a chain. Good food, great service, clean, reasonably priced large portions - what not to like.",UNK
11102,The food is okay if you're hungry. But it's kind of pricey considering what you're getting. I'm guessing the cost is attributed to the location.,UNK
11103,what wine bar serves its wine in clear plastic party cups?!?!? \n\n#icantevenrightnow,UNK
11104,"Eh, I have reviewed the one on Sahara and have gone there twice.  This one, I do not know why, left a lot to be desired. The staff is different, the food was not that good, and it definitely did not have the usual Hash House a Go-Go atmosphere.",UNK
11105,"Not good, not bad.   Average.   The Wedding Cake cupcake is the way to go.   Friendly counter help.    They did not offer any information on any specials or loyalty club though.",UNK
11106,It's IN N OUT good...that's what I use to praise other food places that's really good. So that says it all. ANIMAL STYLE!!!,UNK
11107,Nice ambiance but the rib eye was overly seasoned. The brussel sprouts where not oven roasted but burnt. The lobster bisque was excellent but the mac n cheese was dry and not saucy. The only good thing was the two bottles of wine we drank.,UNK
11108,Great sliders especially when they're $5.99 for the Monday lunch special. Other food is good but not great. Service was friendly and attentive but slow.\n\nI'm not a drinker so I can't comment on the wine.,UNK
11109,The food was okay. Nothing that I would pay $20 for. But I didn't like the atmosphere. I was really bothered by the aquariums. It looked over crowded with fish. I hope someone is taking care of them because they looked really stressed.,UNK
11110,"Having been to various Apple stores, the Madison location gave very good service at the Genius bar (I had made an appointment online). The employee I dealt with was very friendly and dealt with my problem quickly and efficiently. This is rarely the case at Apple stores! So, yay Madison West Towne!",UNK
11111,"I heard this place is great yet for some reason they find no need to take your order after ten or so minutes of waiting. Considering we were the ONLY table seated, we decided to leave and go next door. Our order was taken within a minute. Maybe next we will call in our order and then eat there.",UNK
11112,"I discovered this great little place through a Groupon I had bought for valentines day. My spouse and I had 2 tea pots and many cupcakes, macarons and cookies with it. Everything was so delicious! I definitely recommend Bar A Beurre for any avid tea fan!",UNK
11113,"Amazing pho for a great price.  We have tried the other pho places, and this one is by far the best in the area.  By far.",UNK
11114,Nice service.  Incorrectly over or under cooked almost every steak on the table.  Reported promptly to wait staff not willing to correct.  I would never come back here.  Plenty of great restaurants in Pittsburgh.\nIn summary overpriced and overrated.,UNK
11115,"We should have came here instead of Mothers Bbq Grill. I loved their selection! You get your own meat from the bar. I didnt like that they didnt have too many sides. But they had egg rolls, soup, and fried rice. I would definitely come back here when i come back to vegas!",UNK
11116,"First time here today. The pad Thai and cashew chicken was great! The atmosphere was quiet and the servers were very attentive. A very clean and crisp restaurant, and definitely recommended.",UNK
11117,"Really clean sites, excellent staff,\nRestaurant serves breakfast and lunch\n2 great pools, general store, full hookups,\nDirectly across 15fwy from Bass Pro Shop",UNK
11118,Do not go during lunch. The waitress spent all of her time on one table and left the other ones out to dry. The food was room temperature and the potatoes were cold. The services was the worst service that I have had in a long time. I will not eat there again.,UNK
11119,"This is the regular hotel I stay whenever biz take me to Vegas. Just another Holliday Inn express. Internet sometime spotty, some room are not maintenance well. Overall it is clean, quite, free breakfast.",UNK
11120,First class service and the best seafood on the strip.  You definitely get what you pay for here.  Loved the food and experience.  Chef Josh is a great guy as well.,UNK
11121,"It's Olive Garden and it's in Surprise, so it's always busy. I've always had decent service and good tasting food. If I have my choice, I'm always going to choose a less chain place, but it's not bad in a pinch.",UNK
11122,I used to really like this place but the last time I was there the sushi was not fresh. Salmon tasted yucky. I think the standard is going down.,UNK
11123,The service was good.  We entertained a large group and several joined in for their signature steak plate of several different cuts.  The one platter was ok and parts of the other platter several thought the meat was slightly over down.  Good place but I think there are other better places for slightly more money.,UNK
11124,"This has to be one of my favorite spots. I love the croqutte potato, and the house salad has a delicious homemade dressing that is off the charts. \nI hit this place up about once a month and am never disappointed.",UNK
11125,"Yeah, okay, the girls are pretty. So what? I just paid $14.50 for one drink. I must be an imbecile because i paid. I will not be back.",UNK
11126,"Do not recommend this place at  all. Hertz gave me always a lot of trouble. I had often rental cars, but with Herta there are only problems. Especially in the return of the car. It seems that want to make additional money there.\n\nWould recommend to to got to any other place then Hert",UNK
11127,This place exceeded my expectations.  The fish was very fresh the night we were there.  The bartender was great and the fish portions were bigger then average.  I enjoyed the sashimi a lot more then the sushi and the rolls.  The quality of fish seemed better on the sashimi.  I would go back.,UNK
11128,I would definitely come back. Service was great. The greeter was very traditional & attentive. The selection is good for any type of sushi eater. Spicy garlic edamame is good also.,UNK
11129,We came for breakfast. I got the pancakes. What I received was the frozen silver dollar pancakes you get at the store. Complete with frozen centers. The entire plat was cold. \n\nI had high breakfast hopes. Do yourself a favor and avoid it.,UNK
11130,"In love with this place! Just love the cocktails and the vibe it has. Moscow mule is sooo yummy! Service is always great. Make sure you make a reservation if you want a booth, they get pretty busy.",UNK
11131,"This place is like is like Culver's though the burgers are a little better and the fries are much much better! \n\nIf I am going to shorten my life with fried foods, it will be at places like Freddys,",UNK
11132,"They had just the cake we needed for a last-minute birthday celebration--and it is delicious!  Friendly service, perfect cakery, yay!",UNK
11133,"The Veggie Bowl is the way to go. But the Gyro is delicious also. I have been here a handful of times and I'm always happy with my choices. The service is outstanding, the food is fresh and the prices are amazing! Don't miss this place. It's worth the stop.",UNK
11134,"Bouchon offers fine bistro style fare in a gorgeous and classy setting. However, I've been looking forward to a Thomas Keller dining experience but just wasn't wowed. To be fair, the food was executed well and I wasn't disapointed by the quality.",UNK
11135,"This is the best little cafe. My husband and I go often on the weekends. The breakfast is delicious, and they have very reasonable prices. They have a board with daily specials that rotate. Nothing fancy, just good food.",UNK
11136,Had good flavors but the yogurt just left a funny feeling in my mouth afterwards. The d\u00e9cor is cute but gets crowded. Layout is kind of different. I'll stick with my favorite place U-Swirl,UNK
11137,WORST service I have ever experienced. I don't normally write reviews but the service was so bad I needed to let people know. Waiter never came to check on us and we had to leave after an hour of not getting our food.,UNK
11138,I was not impressed. Mainly because the fruit toppings were lack luster. What can I say? I'm a topping snob. The amount of variety doesn't make up for the mediocrity of texture and flavor. Boo.,UNK
11139,"I I wouldn't recommend AYCE unless you can really put it away.  The prices are already cheap, and the price is about $29 pp.  The food was cool not a big variety like other AYCE sushi places.  The fried scallops and baked mussels were probably my favorite.  Staff was friendly though.",UNK
11140,"This place is a disaster!  The restaurant was dirty, they ran out of lobster, the manager was a total jerk...  I can't think of a single good thing to say about this place.",UNK
11141,"I get a lot of my supplies for my jewelry business here. They have a lot of staple items that I need at a great price. Word of advice, sign up to be one of their loyalty members and you'll receive 40%off coupons in your email practically every week. I save so much money using those coupons.",UNK
11142,"Not the best nightclub out there...\nMusic isn't catching & the crowd isn't happening.\nDance floor? Who know exactly where it is.\nBut at least there's shot drinks that ladies go around for, only asking for tip.",UNK
11143,"Awfull, chicken undercooked, bartender a got order messed up, there were 6 people in the place total, awful experience",UNK
11144,"I must start my review by stating that I stayed on the strip, but visited the Golden Nugget during my stay and was pleasantly surprised. This place is beautiful!!! My heart skipped with joy and delight over this Legendary landmark.",UNK
11145,"Dr. Frye is great, but the office/staff is the worse ever! They don't care at all. Sad the money we pay and the lack of servuce we don't receive! Don't watse your time or money here.\ns",UNK
11146,I'm not sure I get the appeal of this place.  It's like Main Street in Disneyland only it has a Pottery Barn.\n\nPeople seem to like to bring their dogs here and it seems to be a community gathering place for Green Valley.  But I'd rather hang out somewhere a little more urban.,UNK
11147,I don't know how they do it but this place has some of the fastest delivery times.  Even living in greenfield it would still get there in 30. Love their vegetarian options and I'm not even a vegetarian anymore ha.  Crab rangoons are the best ever and the fake orange beef is amazing.,UNK
11148,"My last experience is this establishment was that it was dirty, the employees were rude, and were not helpful. The food is good, but service and sanitation make this a no brainer, and a 1 star place.",UNK
11149,The service is great but the food was very basic. We had the bake pasta and the Margarita pizza. Based on the price point and reputation we expected more :(,UNK
11150,I'm a big fan of the beer selection and the gnocchi bolognese.  It's tough to get a drink from the bar when it's crowded and you're waiting for a table.,UNK
11151,not a big fan of burgers and i thought the burgers tasted like mcDonalds burgers. but i was hungry. it's a place seems like everyone after clubs and bars go to.,UNK
11152,Its way too cold in the dining room. I cannot even enjoy the free WiFi because I am freezing. They should offer free hot chocolate because of the icy temp inside. What we need is heat not cold...its cold enough outside...,UNK
11153,"Place has really gone down hill since they opened. Sad but true.....they have expanded but cut quality. Service is very very slow.....we continue to go, for now though",UNK
11154,I like this place for the food and reasonable prices.  It is nice to take a couple steps away from the casino and have a good meal.  The staff is always helpful and breakfast is really good.  I recommend the Protein Breakfast.,UNK
11155,"This is my usual take out place. A must have is their black property steak. Yumm!!! Unfortunately, i've tried their other dishes (vermicelli) & I pretty much puked it out. Taste was extremely off for me. So I recommend everything else on the menu except vermicelli :)",UNK
11156,"This is only an update, I still love their ribs. \n\nWe called on a Sunday @ 12 noon (they open at 11) for ribs delivery and they were out of ribs!!!!!!!! Very disappointing!",UNK
11157,Always busy but impecable staff they have a solid team and they all work together. Lots of attention to the guests and move people through as quickly as possible.,UNK
11158,"We came here only as last resort. Our experience really confirmed all the negative reviews online. The food is mediocre at best, HORRIBLE service. And best of all, tips are automatically included, so you can't even voice your discontent. Never again.",UNK
11159,"what an amazing diner, all the comfort food, priced right, fast friendly service, clean restroom, I'll be back again and again!",UNK
11160,"Super busy the Saturday night we went, but we were seated within 5 minutes of arriving.  Food was great; waiter also great... Made our evening memorable.  Pricey for pasta, but I'm sure we will go back for a special occasion.",UNK
11161,not open at 8pm on a wednesday...\nno website.\n\ndud for me :/ maybe ill get a chance to try it when it's actually open,UNK
11162,"Pretty nice hotel. The Sahara hotel was pretty small so they didn't have a lot to work with. I am dissapointed though in the Celling. They just painted it black, they coulda been more creative with it",UNK
11163,"My Massaman Curry tasted like peanut paste, I couldn't tell if there was any coconut milk in it at all. It was just poor quality in my opinion.",UNK
11164,Went here on a date a while back with the lady. The food was delicious and it was served quickly. They had a pretty solid craft beer selection too. I'd definitly go back.,UNK
11165,My friends and I actually had a lot of fun here.The reason why I'm giving this place a two is cause the lady working was so rude about us finishing our last hole because they were closing.,UNK
11166,Good food and reasonable prices. My wife loves the place they include miso soup and a little salid with sushi. Nice staff as well,UNK
11167,Worst buffet I have ever been to in Las Vegas. Absolutely a rip off  what chef? I see nothing worthy that is here warranting a good rating for a buffet. Waste of hard earned money. Management could care less if food bad.  Never ever would I recommend this place 100%,UNK
11168,"Got really sick after eating at this Taco Bell - up all night with an upset stomach after just two chicken soft tacos.  I generally like Taco Bell but won't be going back to this one (or any, any time soon).",UNK
11169,Grossly over priced Chinese food that is mediocre at best. The pepper filet was ok. The orange chicken was downright bad. \n\nThe pros are the dumplings and the atmosphere is nice.,UNK
11170,"Bland, unsalted foods but wonderful drinks. Wish they had more vegetarian\n\nBeautiful decor",UNK
11171,"Slow........service. They just can't get it going. Avoid this place unless you have a couple hours to kill watching TV on a 13\"" screen.",UNK
11172,"Lettuce, tomatoes, onions and cheese smacked between thick white bread.  It's nothing amazing, but gets the job done for this vegetarian.  Meh, 3 stars.",UNK
11173,I've been to a few Moe's around town and this is my favorite.  The line moves quickly and the food is good.  They have a check in where you enter your phone number 10 times and get a free meal.  Added bonus.  I asked other Moe's about this and they laughed.  It's a nice perk.,UNK
11174,"Really nice mall. I visited it while walking down the strip. I really enjoyed it and bought a few things. So did my mom, we love to shop! I love the design of it also, great architecture. If you're in Vegas, definitely stop by!",UNK
11175,"Nice beer specials, good service, nice atmosphere. It's a cool bar. I went during an off peak time. Middle of the day during work hours so it was quiet. I'll be going back during a Friday night to check out the real social scene",UNK
11176,"This place is very good. Great. Just two very minor and easy to fix things: the music and the beer list. The music is way too loud and the beer list is too short. But the food, service, decor, and food (yes I said it twice). Is amazing.",UNK
11177,Good breakfast. Good service. Good location. Needs more parking and one of the chefs doesn't known the difference between sunny side up and scrambled...,UNK
11178,"Great steak burrito and they were busy, but FAST! Our server was swamped but was attentive. We had the steak burrito and chips, salsa, and guacamole and all of it was great!",UNK
11179,Group of 8 and had no desire to seat us!! Did not want to let us split up I to 4 and 4. Wanted to put us all on one check!! Not toe room receptionist was pushing 50 in buttless chaps!,UNK
11180,I think this is a great show for the money. It was only $27. The singing and dancing were great and I laughed a lot. My main complaint was the seating. It was hard to see at times since everyone was on the same level.,UNK
11181,"Hopefully you never get Erica as a server. She was very rude, rushed, and does not know the golden rule. She argues when questioned. I think because we all look younger she thought we wouldn't tip well, her mistake. \nWILL NEVER RETURN TO THIS CHILIES!",UNK
11182,"Yeah,I'm going to have to agree with everyone that this place is all hype...only good thing was that I didn't have to wait in line..the first time I tried it was more than an hour wait so I left...",UNK
11183,Scam!  Signed up for the Puppy Plan.  Paid for plan up front.  1 year later I noticed money coming out of my account.  I called them to ask what was going on.  They told me it was like a Gym membership and it auto renews.\nDon't go there!,UNK
11184,"The only minor complaint I have with this place is that it feels kinda like a subway inside. Other than that it's top notch. Very simple yet creative sandwich recipes and the prices aren't bad either. The Dilly Bird sandwich is awesome. It's Turkey, cream cheese, avocado and Mayo. Delicious. :)",UNK
11185,Will never call to order for delivery again at this restaurant. From the moment I called until I received it toke 1 hour and a 45 min!!!! Can't believe it until it really happen. Even if it was supposed to be good the food was cold and mushi.,UNK
11186,"You go here because it's a gimmick and you are stuck on the Vegas Strip. \nThe giant ice creams are fun, but the food is mediocre, just like every other mid priced place on the Strip.",UNK
11187,"Horrible service, they only gave me one sandwich and I paid for 2. Just a bunch of clueless teens. Waste of money and time",UNK
11188,"One of the best Chipotles in town. Friendly staff, quality food and one of the few locations that has a liquour license. (Margaritas and Coronas.) ;-)",UNK
11189,Didn't get to eat. No parking without walking a Mile. Plenty of handicapped lots with no one in them.,UNK
11190,Not bad but not great.   Recommend the spinach calzone.   Very tasty.   Service has improved.   Extensive menu. Pricing is rather reasonable. Outdoor seating available. Good location for after Red Rock Canyon activities,UNK
11191,"Hefty price to pay but when you're the only one doing watch battery replacements in San Tan Mall, you have a monopoly and can get away with charging exorbitant rates. While they replaced the battery in a timely manner and provided a \""5 year guarantee,\"" I think we'll try Donaldson in Gilbert next time.",UNK
11192,"I drove over here from the southpoint so i didnt need to eat their nasty buffet, I was happy to see a regular restaurant without smoking or gambling... they also have these amazing cinnamon rolls that come in a cup. what a good idea they are delicious.",UNK
11193,"Have no idea if the food is any good. Waited for 10 minutes in the bar without even a hello. The place was busy but no packed.  Really, greeting a customer isn't that hard. Walked out and no one said a word. So much for my first dining experience in Pittsburgh.",UNK
11194,The trivia nights here are pretty fun. Check it out on Mondays @ 6:30pm. The food is decent. It seems like bar food so it isn't anything special. The service sucked and was slow.,UNK
11195,"Really good burger and fries. I thought the burger was a little small, but very good. I got a sample of the seasonal beer before committing. I really liked it as well. Service was excellent. The young woman at the checkout checked on us later to make sure everything was good.  I will probably be back.",UNK
11196,I really liked the quality of food. And it is weird that I liked the coke they provide.\n\nThere were so many choices of food and I wished I had bigger stomach so I can eat more.\n\nThe desserts were absolutely delicious and not too sweet.,UNK
11197,Saw the reviews & tried this place. Expensive for the small portions received. Pork cutlet was dry and had a strange taste. Tasted like it was pre cooked & then heated. Shrimp tempura was the same. Blah! Sushi was just ok.,UNK
11198,"Food lacked in flavor...however, the presentation was decent and the quality was good. I wouldn't come back though...it's pricey and I think I prefer cheap sloppy fake \""Chinese food\"" from Panda express or your local wok anyways.",UNK
11199,All our food was bland and burnt. 2 nights in a row. Probably cuz we stumbled in past 3am. But still. Come on.,UNK
11200,Big surprise no one has contacted me to follow up. A woman from corporate emailed me on yelp asking for my number and never called. \n\nTruly impressed with their complete disregard to protecting their patrons and following up with something that effects every guest.,UNK
11201,"I can tell by the way it tastes that the falafel sandwich, baba ganoush and tabbouleh are totally vegan, and delicious too. I didn't bother asking them about ingredients because it's so obvious.",UNK
11202,"Just go to Costa Vida and save yourself some time. Their sauces are too salty and their steak is not as good as Costa Vida. I don't care which one came first, Costa Vida dumps on Cafe Rio, hands down.",UNK
11203,"Went here for dinner, good food, good service, and good atmosphere, but could not believe a nice place like this serves \""cheap ketchup,\""  where is the Heinz ketchup?  Would have rated it a 4 or 5, but because of cheap condiment, could only rate it a 3!",UNK
11204,"I am not a big coffee gut, but time to time I'll stop in for a pastry and an Izzie drink.\n\nIt's a short review, but I'm not a coffee guy so I don't really have anything to say, it's a starbucks",UNK
11205,The atmosphere is very warm and friendly. This would be a great date night place. The food was very good and served piping hot. Loved this place and will be back to try something else.,UNK
11206,"Not for vegetarians but I stopped and had a cocktail anyway on a sleepy, cold winter Monday night. Less than 6 bucks for a top shelf cocktail. Interesting decor. Casual, neighbourhood-y bar.",UNK
11207,"Pretty standard medium airport. We fly in and out infrequently and never hate the place, but never find ourselves wishing we flew through more often.",UNK
11208,Has all of the usual suspects that one needs from a Starbucks but Holy Long Lines!!  All day!  It's right near the elevators so it's the main Starbucks in the MGM. (I think there are 3 on the main floor of the MGM).  OK selection of food.,UNK
11209,"Has some electronics component which are decent if you are in a pinch. Over all not the electronic wiring nerd paradise it used to be, but a decent place to start.",UNK
11210,"Treated horrible, hotel staff very inconsiderate And doesn't work well with the guest here, i was forced to stay out of my room for hours, even though we had the money to get into our rooms, basically leaving my service animals, left in the room unintended for hours!!!",UNK
11211,Two stars for having my product. Rude lady wouldn't go back in ever. She's very condescending sounding. Tanks are WAY overpriced.,UNK
11212,"This was the hotel I stayed at for my 21st birthday and I almost think that was the last time as well and to be honest I don't think I really notice much of a difference in their gaming, amentities, or layout. The rooms to this hotel really reminded me of a Holiday Inn or something of that caliber.",UNK
11213,Went here today and the place was closed! I read online that they closed due to health code fines. Too bad i didn't get to try it! :(,UNK
11214,Cant go wrong with the tostada pizza and all the other unique pizzas. I always enjoy trying something new here. The price/portion is just right for me. The salads are also very large portions and tasty.,UNK
11215,"Stopped in to get a late night bit to eat. Its off the strip and was easy to get to. Had the chirizo plate and enjoyed it. It was a good size portion of chirzo and eggs, beans, rice, and 3 tortillas. Will stop by again and maybe I'll try the carnitas.",UNK
11216,"Hazelnut bread is awesome, I even take some home to make sandwiches. Prefer this place for breakfast and coffee. Nice location and staff!\n\nThe coffee is way better than Starbucks.",UNK
11217,"I hate it here, smell, feel, parking, rooms, casino it all sucks ass, so bad.\nTwo stars because it is, after all, in a great location on the Strip.",UNK
11218,This is a solid choice for good pizza. It's not gourmet but is certainly leaps and bounds above a Domino's or Pizza Hut. They are consistent in both the quality of food and delivery time. We are now loyal customers to this little strip mall gem!,UNK
11219,"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh, it was like finally finding the spot you've been wishing for. Saturday night 70's funk music, exceptional service, and delicious food. You have to try their gyro.",UNK
11220,"Food was great. Drink was questionable. Service was truly sad. I'll try it again, because I've got a $25 certificate, and the food really was that good. I'll report again after that.",UNK
11221,"Excellent customer service, but the breakfast I had was disgusting. The manager was super funny and really sweet. I just had to sit down and eat the whole thing. The egg kind of tasted like rubber, the cheese was pretty gross, and the bagel had my breath smelling like garlic until I went home from work and got the chance to brush my teeth.",UNK
11222,$80 for 2 people $7 for parking & $8 for a locker .... Yep I'll never go there again beside the line for the rides are to long,UNK
11223,My one experience here involved squalid conditions that looked common occurrence.  The next few days I spent trying to get over the food poisoning.,UNK
11224,The food was horrible. The steak had no flavor and was dry. My friend had ribs...which were burnt. We will not be returning.,UNK
11225,"Unfortunately, I almost always have a negative experience at this particular petco. I walk in and am ignored the entire time, no asking if I need help, no hello, nothing. They have a huge natural foods selection, which is awesome- except literally every other item I was looking for was lacking. The cat section is tiny.",UNK
11226,The kids had fun but totally overpriced for what they have to offer. Cashman did the photos...what a joke that was still waiting for their system to come up 2 days later and they are offering nothing to compensate for the hassle.,UNK
11227,"Oh Twisters is fun. We had ice cream here not long ago. I had some Blizzard-type thing, and it was delicious. The girl behind the window was a sweetheart too. I loved her hair and piercings.",UNK
11228,The food was ok....not as good as it should've been for the price. The wait staff was horrible!! Took forever to get a drink and menu. They disappeared when it was time to place my order. I WILL NOT be back. It was not worth the price,UNK
11229,"Nice creative dishes.  Pork belly was very good.  Other dishes good.  Very expensive.  Would have gone to Nobu, but they aren't open for lunch.",UNK
11230,Fries are great but everything else is terrible.  I would eat here more often if they improved their burgers even just a little bit.,UNK
11231,I honestly didn't care for this place in Chicago but I figured I would try it out. Not only did their food suck like usual..they got my order COMPLETELY wrong. Needless to say.. I will not be going back.,UNK
11232,Good food and good service.\n\nIf you're planning to eat at this location on a Friday or Saturday I would recommend making reservations to avoid the long wait.,UNK
11233,"I've lived in CU for 8 years, visited both Merry-Ann's locations at least three times, and never had a decent bite of food. \n\nSkip it and go to McDonald's.",UNK
11234,My wife and I have had dinner at this location about ten times. Food has been consistently very good and hot.  Service okay but not warm and friendly. Good and fast and satisfying for the price.,UNK
11235,beautiful view on top of mandalay bay's the hotel. Good fun with good people! I wish it was a bit more cracking though with a younger crowd!,UNK
11236,"I love me some Wrangler butts! Too bad it's an expensive habit, and they don't have the regular jeans they used to have, and they are out of stock on a lot of things.",UNK
11237,"I had high hopes for this place, and did not get what I was hoping for.  Service was very slow, they were out of what I ordered, and the prices were VERY high.  Food was just OK, nothing to rave about.  Very odd place.",UNK
11238,"This is one of the few bars that I'll order takeout from. The buffalo chicken wrap is sooo good, and it comes with fries so it basically makes 2 meals for me. I've only gotten drinks here a few times but always had good experiences.",UNK
11239,"A small shop with a limited selection of paper that I found to be a bit expensive and uninspired. I walked out empty-handed, but this place might be better suited for someone looking for stationary. The woman behind the counter was a little condescending, too. Clean and organized, but a disappointing experience for me.",UNK
11240,"\""Meh.  I've experienced better\"" is exactly right.  While the bagels are somewhat tasty (I would hope they have this recipe down), service is SLOW (takes a healthy 10 minutes to get a bagel and coffee with 1 person in front of me) and everything is on the pricey side.",UNK
11241,12.00 to Valet? Yeah right. Best to treat locals better. DownTown Grand? You are 86'ed!!! Plenty of other places to go out and hang.,UNK
11242,"If it was possible to provide negative stars I would.  The entire experience was so awful, the only thing they have going for them is they are better than greyhound, but not by much.  \nThe only thing they are consistent at is being consistently awful. I fly over 100 segments a year and they still manage to surprise me.",UNK
11243,"I stayed at west tower, it was ok, rooms smelled great and clean, affordable.\nThe buffet was awful. Next time I will pick another hotel.",UNK
11244,If want a list of place to stay away. this is one of them. I think my one star tell you how I feel about this pit.,UNK
11245,"Not real impressed at all. The food was so so, kind of tasteless. Seemed pretty expensive for what you get. Go to Subway and don't waste your money",UNK
11246,Put my feet up and ordered in. What came was a thin crust Pizza could be faxed to you and taste just as good. I also got one with everything that looked liked it could scare Jeffrey Dahmer.  So many options in Surprise why bother with this one.,UNK
11247,Nice reasonably priced place for tasty gluten free options and even gluten free empanadas. Arepas are prepared very well and patacones are a good filling option. Order the beef or go vegetarian. Service was also quite nice.,UNK
11248,"This salon is nice and friendly but my nails were chipped by noon the same day. The nail tech was sweet and listened to what I wanted done, but the top coat they used is not a good one. I used to own it and stopped because it's crappy. I would go back but would do gel next time.",UNK
11249,the Sandwich had too much mustard on it... place was empty and service was just okay.. no more kids eat free on wednesdays which was why i went there,UNK
11250,"I had dinner at this restaurant and was sorely disappointed. The service was slow and the food was below average, at best. Hopefully, this was an isolated experience.",UNK
11251,Last night was my first time there the fries were recooked with a bottle of salt and the veggie burger fell apart....35 dollars later for two no thank you my last time,UNK
11252,I miss this place. I love the food and the atmosphere. I cant wait to go back to vegas and eat at the great greek again. \nThat lamb is delicious,UNK
11253,Horrible haircut. The lady did not want to hear how I wanted my hair cut. She kept saying that it wouldn't work. And she didn't even know how to do a taper. Just awful. Not to mention that the TVs weren't working.,UNK
11254,I was in a bikini contest here and had a blast! The only thing I didn't like is I had to go through like three security checks when getting in... Kind of ridiculous.,UNK
11255,"Great food, Great service. Owner Operated and they care. Great place to go eat any meal of the day like coming downstairs and mom says she will cook you anything you want. A nice addition to local restaurants for all of us industry peeps.",UNK
11256,"A contrived, overpriced faux irish pub that's perfect for Vegas. The live music was ok though.",UNK
11257,"I like this place. The coffees are good and the food is tasty.  Probably the food isn't as good as the ambiance of the place, it just a has a real cool vibe to it so who cares?\n\nParking is usually a problem but the staff is very warm and friendly.",UNK
11258,"Two thumbs down. The atmosphere is great... But waiting an hour for a $10.00 sandwich that you could have made at home is not. This place is good for people who want the \""Starbucks experience\"" without regard for time or taste.",UNK
11259,"Gross... I saw my server outside smoking and walked straight back into the kitchen... I \nWatched him take plates to be served out to the main room without washing... Good food is one thing, bad cleanliness is another.",UNK
11260,Bar - expensive\n\nStaff - judging\n\nLocation - alright\n\nDecor - good\n\nwine -warm\n\nToilets - BAD BAD BAD,UNK
11261,Bad food and expensive beer. The fries were way too salty and pretzels were super greasy. Won't come back.,UNK
11262,"Always good service, never much of a wait.  Other than that, it's Applebee's...you should already know what to expect.",UNK
11263,"This place was ok for Champagne-Urbana. Stayed here for my cousins wedding. Rooms were spacious and the kitchenette was a plus as a serious lack of decent places to eat was evident. I don't plan on staying here again, but, then again, I don't plan on heading down to UC any time soon.",UNK
11264,"I go here alot.  The line is usually always super long and some of the workers are not too friendly.  If you go at a not too busy time, then you can get in and out fairly quickly.  They do have a self serve machine if your items are quick and easy to mail.",UNK
11265,"Used to always be awesome and worth the high price, but lately the quality has really dropped. I have been disappointed with 2 of the last 3 pizzas I got.\n\nMostly the topping have been really skimpy and usually the sauce is very very light.\n\n-See the pic",UNK
11266,Food wasn't that great the bread was the best part of my meal. Try one of the other 10 restaurants in the area to avoid disappointment.,UNK
11267,A Thai person recommended this spot to me so I already knew this was the good-good. \n\nHidden gem in Las Vegas. \n\nSuperb. Excellent. Met my expectations. \n\nGet the fried garlic shrimp. My favorite thing on the menu and well worth the price.,UNK
11268,"We went on a Tuesday night. We were the only people in the restaurant. Service was fast and friendly. The chef was really good, funny and did some awesome tricks. Everyone at our table of 4 was pleased and had plenty to eat. Get hibachi steakhouse!",UNK
11269,"The sauce is terrible, zero flavor, dough is okay, toppings are not the best. As pizza goes, this is the bottom of the line.",UNK
11270,This is where I usually do all my grocery shopping. Their produce is usually fresh and their prices are decent. Sometimes I find things cheaper other places but I think that happens everywhere. Albertsons is across the street and I prefer Smiths just for the produce.,UNK
11271,"food is good but service horrible! slow, inattentive and wasn't even busy when we went only had 2 other tables. ALso tried to call for take out and was on hold for a long time so gave up.",UNK
11272,We ate here on our last night in Montreal.  Food was excellent.  Service was a bit slow but fairly typical for a French restaurant. A good splurge meal.,UNK
11273,Will probably never go back. Called and told them exactly what I needed - said cheap models are $60-70 and better models are up to $150. When I got there I was told $200. When I asked why I was told they probably thought I meant something else. Felt like a used car salesman moment. Not cool.,UNK
11274,"The only reason why I am giving this a 3, is because the Bison Burger was great! Other then that, coming from So.Cali, this Mexican style of food does not compare. But I would give it a try again.",UNK
11275,"Great addition to area - which is missing good breakfast options. The brie, turkey, fig, egg combination was yummy and the Pete's steak sandwich was definately worth a return trip...",UNK
11276,"Little slow going through the drive-thru, then was able to see teens goofing around inside as I waited for my order.  I can understand a wait for the egg based sandwiches, but donuts & coffee should be in and out fast.",UNK
11277,Like having a backyard-grilled burger. It's good but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here.,UNK
11278,I agree with everyone's reviews.  Even the drive through is slow.  It isn't the greatest location but I do have hopes that they plan to upgrade the location.  There isn't many choices in buckeye for food add it is,UNK
11279,"We went by here tonight and Manny's was closed and it looked like the kitchen was being loaded onto trucks. Shame, as we liked the place.",UNK
11280,"Thank you Tanda M. for reminding me to review this.  I went to the casino two weeks ago.  It was cool, but not as exciting as most casinos I've been to.  Usually the atmosphere is enough to make me want to stay awhile...",UNK
11281,Everytime I shop there ...the line to check out is so long.\nGood for them..they are busy but geez open up another register so your customers don't have to wait in lines.,UNK
11282,"Le Village buffet was always a fave dining spot, but the quality and variety isn't as good now as it used to be. Okay for buffet bit there are better options for your money.",UNK
11283,"I went to this location to eat one evening.  The waitress was great the food was okay.  I prefer the Arbors or Gastonia locations.  However, each is consistent in the staff is very friendly.",UNK
11284,Your normal 3 star residence inn.   Roof top view pretty cool.  Parking $25- OUCH!  Great location. \n\nCould use a face lift soon.,UNK
11285,Awesome customer service. All sales reps are very knowledgeable and knew what was in stock without checking. \n\nI ended up buying the Alti Spike Pumps.\n\nOnly complaint is that they were out of size 37 in most styles.,UNK
11286,"Menu looked promising. Ribs had good smoke ring,but were dry, not what I was hoping for. Chicken had interesting spice combo, hard yo eat. Baked beans were good. A bit pricy for the portions served. Probably would rate this place as a one & done.",UNK
11287,"They have excellent food, but the portions are average to small and the pricing is expensive for this type of cuisine. I'm not sure I would go again compared to other options I have for chinese food. The staff was average as well. I'd like to see better staff and bigger portions in the future if I were to go again.",UNK
11288,Wasn't a fan. The wings had no flavor and the fries we received looked and tasted like they were made 4 hours ago. Waitress was great. Watching games here isn't the best since the TV's are like 47 feet in the air.,UNK
11289,Very stylish restaurant with a great street view. Food can be on the spicier side here which is a plus. Worth checking out based on the price point.,UNK
11290,Great pizza. The owner use to work for metro so you know he can make a good pizza. I'm a NJ former resident so I know my pizza and I recommend trying there's.,UNK
11291,Went there once and the fish was old and felt rubbery with a room temperature feel. Maybe I went on a bad day but it was enough to ruin it for me,UNK
11292,"Waited FOREVER for our food; pizza was alright, pasta wasn't fully cooked and the meat and marinara sauce tasted store-bought at best. Atmosphere was non-existent. Bathroom was hot and NASTY. Waitress was nice.",UNK
11293,"Really nice indian. Location could be better, but that's just nit picking. Delicious food, hot is important, service adequate.But again GOOD FOOD.",UNK
11294,Was there just before the remodel and thought the food just okay. It was 7:00 pm and we were the only ones in the front dining area. The waiter was nice but not as attentive as we would have expected since there was no one else there. Not somewhere I would choose to go to again.,UNK
11295,"Tried this cute little place while on Mill Ave with my boyfriend. Pretty good food, and the people are wonderful! Very personable. Didn't get to try the dessert, but the fresh pineapple juice is delicious!",UNK
11296,"Whole experience is pretty cool if you have never done it. It's a bit pricey but with all you can eat filet mignon, it's to be expected, salad bar is good and all of the meats were amazing",UNK
11297,Good food and great service! We got the vegetarian sampler and my favorite was the chickpea one (i forget what it was called),UNK
11298,food was great. wine pairings were great. but my mouth isn't watering as i type this so i can't give it 5 stars. would go again if someone else wanted to go.,UNK
11299,"Nice rooms, basically like a condo however their pool is tooo cold... i hate cold water.stayed here bc of time share",UNK
11300,"Awesome hot dogs, fries are ...OK small portions but for a smaller price at least, service  was mediocre. Restaurant is very clean though.",UNK
11301,"I haven't been here in a while, maybe I just went there when they weren't having a good sale.  I usually love there accessories!  ummmm, I didn't see much of anything worth purchasing!  So I walked out with nothing.......This time!",UNK
11302,"Was taken here by my Dad because it was a Mario Batali restaurant.  The setting was awesome, inside of the never-dark Venetian Hotel.  The food was pretty good and the ambiance was nice.  I just think the menu was expensive.  Sorry, can't remember what I ate, but I do remember that the food was really good.",UNK
11303,Was in vegas for vacation.  My friends and I ordered napolis at our room. Was soggy and ok. Nothing great.  Just ok,UNK
11304,Amazing Thai restaurant. I would eat here again. I had the dumpling special & Salmon special. A colleague recommended this place & I am recommending it to others :-D,UNK
11305,"This store has the worst customer service. Had a question fitness equipment and no one helpd us. This is not the first time; matter of fact, every time. The only thing good about this store is its location and selection on clothes.",UNK
11306,"Yes, service is a little slow at times but food is very good, hot & smokey mac & cheese is awesome, and the patio is dog friendly. A much needed addition to the neighborhood.",UNK
11307,"I used to use Aliante cleaners all the time....well there was a huge problem with my alteration they did make it right. Thank you to the manager and owner, greatly appreciated!! They stand behind their work. I like that.",UNK
11308,Nothing's special about the breakfast here and some of the stuff looked old and stale. It's very similar to the Luxor breakfast buffet - just normal American breakfast fare. At least the Luxor had decent croissants and food looked fresh.,UNK
11309,In there website they had 2012 yamaha raider s with 3100 miles for $8995 I called the dealer before I drove 15 miles I asked them if they had the exact one he said yah. When I got there they were trying to change the story that pissed me off!!!,UNK
11310,Employees were helpful and its exactly what you expect.  Its been a while since Ive been here so I dont remember what i got.  But I liked it.,UNK
11311,"We love coming here for happy hour. The service staff is very attentive the sushi is great and the \""rock n roll\"" music on the patio is fun. We always have a good time at the location in Kieland. Try the shishisto peppers. Excellent!",UNK
11312,"Using my last prepaid wash today and won't be back. Slow service, rude cashier AND they are blasting country music while I wait. This place has gone way downhill",UNK
11313,"Just a nice dive bar for the LGBT community. \n\nReasonably priced drinks. \n\nThe tempo of the night is unpredictable, but when its a good night.. It's definitely a great night !",UNK
11314,"This store is always nice, and is well laid out, but today I made the mistake of taking a free paper from a lady at the door on my way out! Don't do it!!!  She will curse you out and tell you to lean to read if you don't want to subscribe.",UNK
11315,They advertised they had espresso coffee. Waitress said machine was broken. I had the feeling  they did not want to make cappuccino. Either way i was very disappointed.,UNK
11316,Meh. The fish taquitos weren't very tasty and the rice and beans were OK. The food wasn't very tasty but the restaurant was very clean and the staff was superb.,UNK
11317,"Rating: 3.8\nShort description:  Brewery\nPluses:  Good beer, interesting building\nNegatives: Not the best price, Not the best service, need a better menu overall\nRecommendations:  Decent enough if you like their beer styles.",UNK
11318,The place reeks of burnt cooking oil. I went for breakfast. I ordered the one egg option with a fruit bowl. the fruit was obviously not fresh and looked gross. Waiters are nice but service is very slow. I would never go there again due to the smell of the place which made me sick and the food quality is poor.,UNK
11319,"Every time, I order the bacon cheddar fries, and I still can't finish them. SO worth the money---suuuuper large portion.  I wish there were more drink options than beer and wine, however :/",UNK
11320,"We stopped for dinner want to have a steak.  The mash potatoes and salad were good, but the steak was tough and of low quality..  The price of the food didn't match the quality of the food",UNK
11321,"Decent service, clean toilets and a very well-priced and tantilising range of meals/small portion combinations on offer. A nicely laid back and welcoming atmosphere is attained and I'm very glad to have now managed to have eaten here, having heard its praises sung for some time by a number of friends.",UNK
11322,"Nice atmosphere and location, but WAY overpriced. I paid $11.38 for an iced tea and a cannoli (which turned out to be 3 mini cannoli). Too much $$ for so little.",UNK
11323,DJ was good! But this place is too small and no place to sit. To reserve the seats it's really expensive and not worth it.  It's a big turn off when there are no seats wat so ever!!,UNK
11324,One simple explanation... Great food in small town environment restaurant. This was some of the best Mediterranean food I've had in the area and the relaxed personality of the restaurant made a great impromptu dinner.,UNK
11325,love the products love the location semi love the employees..... not all of them though some are very rude or annoying! especially the one with brown hair (forgot name) other then that i love the products!!,UNK
11326,"Their sushi is great, highly recommend the summer roll and caterpillar roll. The rest of the menu is average phoenix area Chinese food (meat covered in sweet gelatinous goop)",UNK
11327,"I'm assuming this is pretty standard for a hotel restaurant to not be amazing, but this one was mediocre at best. Underwhelming service, unimpressive food, small menu and pretty pricey at that. I'd say take the shuttle to a different restaurant in town.",UNK
11328,"I'm not going to judge you for eating at PF Changs, after all, I did eat at Pei Wei two nights ago-thus the 2 stars, not just one. However, I did wake up the next morning with the shits.. maybe I oughta rethink that extra star!",UNK
11329,"This review is for the Boba: This Boba tastes excellent and is the best that I have had in this town so far, it does not taste powdered or overcooked. The service is friendly and I didn't feel unwanted being white",UNK
11330,AVOID!! Yogurt is bad. They try to get you ti sign up on the website so annoying. I've also heard that they  will harass you with emails if you write a bad review about them so I'm sure they will email me soon.Anyway its crappy yogurt. AVOID!!,UNK
11331,"I was there for an hour, in between flights.  It has bathrooms, planes, overpriced food and gift stores, and is moderately clean and well tended.",UNK
11332,"The patio area was busy but inside was slow.  The atmosphere is dark and dreary, gloomy.... but the food was ok.  Many better places to eat in Charlotte that make you feel welcome, too.",UNK
11333,"I like it here, it's across my office. It's perfect for lunch, they have a lunch menu both healthy and unhealthy choices. I like their salmon dish, salads and Iced tea. Their muffins are great too. Good service.",UNK
11334,Portions were small but good. Would try some of the other close by restaurants. Service was ok @ best. Wolfgang has become high end McDonald's chain.,UNK
11335,First time and last time. Came in for a drink and some food. Bartender was cold as ice. No thanks and come again from her after leaving her a pretty good tip. She could care less. First impression was very awful. Food was ok but super greasy. I would never return with so many options in Las Vegas.,UNK
11336,stopped in for lunch to go. the waitress recommended the chicken sandwich. pretty much the worst chicken sandwich ever. won't be back. to bad as i love to support local businesses.,UNK
11337,"Okay... so my tastes have changed.... I still like this place, but after my last visit it's not as good as my previous visits.  It's still good, just not as good as I remember it to be.  I will try it again next week and let you know if it meets my standards again!",UNK
11338,"They make that pizza where you think it's just a slice of cheese, but hidden beneath all that cheesy greasy goodness is the good stuff (pepperonis).",UNK
11339,"It is large, has everything you need, and the employee's are nice and helpful. There also seems to be an employee always in an aisle so you can ask them where stuff is. I love having employees scattered around, it makes shopping so much easier. They also have 40% off coupons print out with your receipt and that rocks!",UNK
11340,Awful food. Horrible date place. Too loud. Beer list rarely changes. This is the place you go to to break up with someone.,UNK
11341,Really bad place very rude staff did not like the dancers on the bar. Can't dance no room to small have to watch out for the other dancers that are tossing the girls in the air or throwing them between there legs. High price place not worth it!!!!!!!!,UNK
11342,Nice folks but the water softening system has a CAM/Piston that fails often.  Unless they change that I would not buy this unit.,UNK
11343,"Service was terrible! I will never return!!! We waited in the bar and were never greeted or spoken too. People walked in after us and were seated. Not sure what their structure is for seating, but they suck at it. I will not be back.",UNK
11344,"Meh. Service was not very quick but it was friendly. The sushi was decently priced but seemed uninspired and was not particularly fresh. The spring rolls were strange to say the least, mushy inside with a fried doughy shell instead of the usual flaky shell. Not worth the trip in our opinion.",UNK
11345,"Tasty French Toast, no powdered sugar,  too messy for that! Turkey patty sausage, scrambled eggs. Busy time and mob level folks! Noise level up! Waiters and waitresses still calling you GUYS! #RUDE. But nice otherwise. Mgt. Issue!",UNK
11346,Worst service ever sat there for 15 minutes another server brought us water but that was it..it's ashamed food looked pretty good but the service was the worst,UNK
11347,I brought 15 clients to this restaurant to enjoy a nice dinner and it was most disappointing.   To list my complaints about horrible service and bad food would take to much time an effort.  Las Vegas has way to many better places to eat than Morles.  Spend your money and time and elsewhere.  You have been warned!,UNK
11348,"Burritos got smaller, flood still flavorful, but the attitudes of the servers aren't positive and enthusiastic as they use to be. I dont think I'll be eating here again for a while.",UNK
11349,You should try it just to say you have been there and done that.  Food not so good - they only have the burgers and fries.  The waitress we had was very nice and it can be a fun environment for some - once you've been though you most likely wouldn't go back again.,UNK
11350,Under construction when I visited. Small storefront with a modest selection of comic graphic novels and action figures. Also a selection of Fangoria and similar magazines. Kinda dismal vibe but that could be the construction. They also sold some snacks and drinks.,UNK
11351,we have been to multiple thai restaurants in the SE Valley and this restaurant was by far the worst thai food we have eaten around here!! Service was alright but food quality was sub par... not returning,UNK
11352,"It took a few visits to find the ramen I liked best, but they are all good. Very sizable portions, and quick service. Employees are very friendly and I enjoy making regular trips.",UNK
11353,"Cheap food and drink. Again, cheap food and drink, so don't expect much. Nachos come out too soggy and staff can be really slow and forgetful.",UNK
11354,A pandasal is a pandasal...But this bakery has the best Turon I have ever had...For you that don't know what it is...It's a banana and jack fruit eggroll fried with a glaze on it...Just YUMMY...,UNK
11355,"The food was bland and the service was slow.  My Mom ordered a shrimp salad, and it had a ridiculous amount of lettuce in it.  The burger was undercooked and had no flavor at all.  I was not impressed, expecially for the prices.",UNK
11356,"I went and I asked for my eyebrows to be cleaned up and instead they made them way thinner than I wanted. I have been trying to grow them out for a year, and they had just started to look how I wanted them and now they are ruined!!\nAlso it hurt pretty bad.",UNK
11357,Food is too expensive. Over priced. Only 1 star.\nService is ok. 3 stars.\nI don't recommend this restaurant.,UNK
11358,"We came here for lunch while waiting for our next flight.  For airport food, it was pretty decent.  I wish that I had known that some dish already includes beans / rice such that I wouldn't accidentally an extra side of it.  The service was as expected for a busy airport food stand.",UNK
11359,"Still slow. Still sucks. Still forced come here because it by my house. \n\nCome here to view the wonder \""cup traffic jam\"" on the counter at any given time.",UNK
11360,"Great little dive bar, I live in the neighborhood and love the casual laid back atmosphere. Great patio and they have a a great happy hour 2 times a day. A must try if you like local bars.",UNK
11361,The brisket will make your tongue slap your brain out your head. Big beer selection and a great wait staff. Cool atmosphere offers a place you can unwind with a friends.,UNK
11362,This was really quite horrible... you kind of expect a certain standard of food in a Las Vegas buffet... the price is right... but the food was disgustingly substandard... I literally almost threw up eating the crawfish and also the sour Boston chowder...,UNK
11363,Eh... This doesn't taste like any sort Hawaiian food I've had. The quality of the rice bowls are similar to what Jack n' the Box sells. Not great whatsoever.,UNK
11364,CA native; this place was recommended to me. Great pretzel appetizer with Queso dip. The Mac Burger was juicy and filling. The Kale and Sweet Potato salad was excellent.  All my favorite ingredients were in this dish. \nThe portion size was plentiful and the price was reasonable.,UNK
11365,"The desserts failed.\n\nFood was good. I was really hyped up to go here from the reviews...it was not that amazin but food was good. Indonesian curries , prime rib , etc.....sushi was surprisingly fresh for a buffet.",UNK
11366,"Don't ever come to Harmon Medical Center with a loved one as they refuse to let you be with them in the exam room.  And, they won't let the patient use their phone. So shady if you ask me. No communication or sharing of information. Even if patient requests it!!",UNK
11367,Wow! What a fund! We went for breakfast and they had $5.99 steak and eggs. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the service was a little slow.,UNK
11368,"The only thing that this place sells are truffles, and they tasted extremely bitter and nothing like what the specified flavors suggested. Wouldn't recommend at all! Each truffle is priced at $2.00 a piece, I'd recommend going to Walmart and getting truffles instead, being that they actually taste good.",UNK
11369,Won't go back EVER. After two year of going to this place I have had enough.\nHorrible customer service. Rude Rude Rude.....,UNK
11370,Alan and his team were not very proactive. It was awkward ordering from them. Also they didn't seem to not know what was in there products. They need extra training and better customer service. Get it together,UNK
11371,"Yes I agree, the girl didn't offer to toast my sub, however, they still pack a big punch with a list of 30 different sandwiches. Great selection, amazing watermelon tea, and an employee that really knew the menu.",UNK
11372,Burgers are good.  Service is very slow.  Two for Tuesday burgers are very small - its almost not a deal.  Eh.,UNK
11373,"Poor service in the lounge. Not at all accommodating! They also made me leave my credit card for dinner, I guess they thought Id run! Not a good experience",UNK
11374,"Chicken Marsala and alfredo sauce were delicious, but the marinara sauce left little to be desired. I would have preferred the bread that was brought to the table to be warm or at least soft. All in all ok but we probably won't be back.",UNK
11375,"There are far better Mexican places in Phoenix than this place. The atmosphere feels like a run down diner, their margaritas are not good, and the fajitas were alright I guess. Been there twice and I felt the same coming out both times.",UNK
11376,This place is beyond horrible.. Bad experience waitress was rude from the beginning... The shrimp ceviche had a hair in it and they didn't even apologize and still charged us for the food saying the hair was mine... I would never recommend this place to anyone,UNK
11377,I had not been to Bev Mo for a long time and when walking around I remembered why this place is so overpriced.  Save yourself some money and head over to Total wine plus a lot better craft beer selection.,UNK
11378,"Bad experience, rushed out, they usually close at 230 but they close earlier whenever they feel like it I guess. Usually like this place but won't be coming back. Not going to pay my money to be watched constantly and rushed out.",UNK
11379,They are closing this location which is no loss. The service is horrible. I like grimaldis but this one sucks. Try the one at santan mall. Doesn't matter I suppose since this one closes in 2 days.,UNK
11380,Went here tonight and had either glass or plastic in my food. They took down my name and number incase I needed to visit the hospital and gave us our meal free. I'm still upset about the carelessness the cooks had to allow that to happen.,UNK
11381,I was here for brunch and found my meal to be dry and unfufilling.  The restaurant was nice - did a great job of feeling like a french brasserie but it also felt a bit like a fancy Denny's in the morning.  The wait staff was good.,UNK
11382,Capriotti's 21st birthday! Had a lot of fun about 300 people and the bartender remembered what I order drink came fast to!,UNK
11383,"Good location between PNC Park and Heinz field. Solid tap list as well. Food wise, I went with the shrimp tacos and they were pedestrian. If I go back, I'll probably go with something safer like a burger.",UNK
11384,"EVERYBODY is here right now. For the budget & kids, this is the spot though! There is plenty PG-13 things to do within Excalibur, MGM Grand & New York New York. Put on comfy shoes unless u hitting the club cuz you will b walking.",UNK
11385,"Good food, but overpriced as is most of Las Vegas.  But at least the food wsa really good for all 5 of us.",UNK
11386,The food is good. Portion size is BIG! Wait-time during lunch hours is kind of long. Restaurant is clean and staff is friendly enough. \nDefinitely a recommendation.,UNK
11387,I didn't think it was even as good as most of the chains as far as the filet went.\n  My wife did like the rainbow roll though.\nI would not come back.,UNK
11388,"Very friendly staff, both when checking in and again when checking out.  Clean and quiet--except when the door to the outside staircase would slam shut and shake the wall of my room.  If I'd been staying more than one night, I would have been going nutzoid.  But for a quick visit, it was pleasant enough.",UNK
11389,I attempted to place an order here tonight and was shot down by the person taking the phone because I was on the other side of their border for delivery. Even after offering to order extra items and add another delivery charge on top of it. Good Job of throwing away a 50 dollar order and at least 15 dollars in tip for your driver.,UNK
11390,This place is awesome! They have such good food and drinks and it's so cheap! The atmosphere is awesome and so is the waitstaff!,UNK
11391,"Very cool spot in Vegas (in the new Cosmopolitan Hotel). You essentially sit inside a giant crystal chandelier. Drinks are priced fairly, but as with all of Vegas, it's smoky. \n\nGet the signature house Cosmopolitan, and chill here for some great people watching!",UNK
11392,Lower your expectations. This place ain't gourmet.\n\nHit this joint up for breakfast cuz that's when everything is freshest. Come later and you're gurranteed not-so-fresh items.,UNK
11393,"CD/DVD/BLU selection? Great.\nUsed vinyl? Awful. \nA few years ago this place had a huge selection of used records. Now, it has dwindled down to just a few measly bins. What happened?",UNK
11394,I prefer domino's over pizza hut for sure. Sometimes I crave it more than toppers. Its good for when you're feeling lazy and want some yummy pizza. Plus the parmesan bites are delicious.,UNK
11395,"Too inconsistent for me.  Crust tends to be overcooked so if like that, this is the place.  Ingredients are fine, especially the sausage.  NYC atmosphere is interesting and seating area small but adequate.",UNK
11396,"This pizza was a disappointment. The young people molding the dough did not use gloves and when I mentioned this I was told they didn't need to! GAG! I left my purse at the table and returned to find it there, untouched. Is anyone paying attention in this store? I won't be back.",UNK
11397,"Came tonight wanting a steak but they were sold out!  The staff is great but, seriously, who does the buying here?  Ordered a hamburger instead.  It was fine but the baked potato was under cooked & cold.  They have some work to do here!",UNK
11398,"Long waits (2+ hours at dinner time weekends)\n\nNo reservations\n\nGood food, not great.",UNK
11399,"This is a lunch staple when we are doing conventions in The Venetian/Sands. It's close to the show floor, the food is good and the prices are reasonable. It's got something for everyone and is nice enough for a business lunch. The Pasta Telephono has never disappointed.",UNK
11400,"Im going to be honest, i had NO FLIPPING idea what was going on!\n\nbut it looked cool as hell, i say its an assault on your senses. prob wouldn't pay to watch it again though.",UNK
11401,Tried there pizza  a month ago I can say I will not be going back because the pizza I got didn't taste good too me I'm just wondering where did the cheese go when they cooked it in the oven brick  lol,UNK
11402,"This is not the Big Apple from my childhood. I have tried this place twice in 8 years, they ran out of ribs the first time and food was just not good the second.....waitress was cool and a bit cooky, couldn't make up for the meal though.",UNK
11403,"I've been here twice. Pretty inconsistent IMO. The first time food was awesome, second time it was very greasy. Also, pretty expensive. 27 bucks for 2 burgers and sodas is a little steep for a non sit down restaurant that isn't in Manhattan.",UNK
11404,For diner food it was good. As long as you go in expecting that you'll be fine. Got the Spanish omelet. Very tasty. Service is a little slow though,UNK
11405,This place has gone down hill. What used to be in the normal exhibits are now in a paid exhibit hall. It's sad that they have resorted to that to make money. I won't be renewing my membership.,UNK
11406,Food is to spicy for me.  Plus I hate that I have to go in the store to pay for my food if I forgot cash.,UNK
11407,I'm really surprised when I read the reviews of the haters here. We live nearby and have been getting pizzas for years and have loved every one. Just had my favorite - the Classic Combo. Are the haters other pizza joints?,UNK
11408,"Good, will be back if I am in the neighborhood, but not make an extra trip.\n\nEmployee was SUPER friendly, nice and helpful.\n\nChicken and beef were just too sweet for my taste.",UNK
11409,"Fricken waiter spills soda all over us, then charges us 37$ gratuity for 2 friends that didn't even eat with us, for sitting down at our table. What a ripoff!",UNK
11410,Pizza didn't live up to the hype. Pretty standard fare. The restaurant itself is cozy though I'm not a fan of the low ceilings and feeling trapped underground. Oops.,UNK
11411,Very busy Saturday night. 30 min. wait for 3 people. Mourn party ordered 2 salads and the Chicken Enchilada Stack.  The salad plates looked small but were deep...plenty of food all the way around. No room for desert. Would definitely come again.,UNK
11412,"Decent service, and good food. I like their happy hour. I wouldn't come here if I was starving but portion sizes are adequate.",UNK
11413,"I went here for lunch on 3/29/2013 with 4 of my friends. Turns out that all 5 of us have food poisoning now, so I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone (especially considering how mediocre the food is).",UNK
11414,"This is a good value especially the egg and spring rolls. The Pho is good but not close to \""the best\"" The Chinese style lunch specials are average at best. We prefer Pho 43, but Da Vang gives you a lot for a little",UNK
11415,"Get your morbid on!\nGreat Halloween theme, drinks are\nlike shitty candy.\n\n\n\n(b)",UNK
11416,Overall a good property choice in Vegas if you want to be away from the crazy scene and have an oasis to relax. The pool service could certainly be better. Housekeeping was great. Spa was pretty good overall.,UNK
11417,"Eh, it's average. \nWe were here on Valentine's Day, we had a reservation but may not have needed it. The food was OK, they forgot our bread, they were kind of pokey.\n\nI'm not in any rush to go back.",UNK
11418,It was absolutely disgusting. I think I had the bulgogi burger and it was covered in this gelatinous muck. The garlic parm fries were covered in salt and over cooked. The guys there seemed nice but I will not be returning!,UNK
11419,We order take out from here every so often and the process is seamless.  The staff is very helpful and efficient.  Our order is very consistent and they have never made an error or left anything out.  I think the food is average but I do enjoy the Lawrence's Original Pizza.  The ingredients seem fresh and the pizza is prepared well.,UNK
11420,Service was quick and friendly.  Price was reasonable.  But food was at par level.  Not wonderful and not bad either.  One or two bites of my Kung Pao Chicken tasted a little off.  Everything else was fine.,UNK
11421,"Food is good. Great pulled pork and guac. The Margs are NOT modern, and use the same sweet and sour they use in Minnesota. The service is habitually slow and unattentive. Definitely go to get some beers and tacos. Just don't be in a hurry.",UNK
11422,"Okay but the noodles were over cooked and some of the vegetables were frozen,  not fresh as we would have preferred.  It's worth trying but it wasn't the caliber we were hoping for.  We've gone to a few different build your own wok houses in different areas, and this one was just so-so in comparison.",UNK
11423,"Service people seem nice, but I requested a sticker on the window after my oil change as a reminder.  They forgot.  I requested the tire pressure be increased.  They forgot.  Where has good service gone?",UNK
11424,They charge more than the services they provide are worth.  Since they currently have a monopoly on cable tv in the madison area there is nothing anyone can do about it.,UNK
11425,"Cheap , fast and good quality Panini's. Small shop with a hole in the wall feel and a large open door.",UNK
11426,I'm not a bit Penneys shopper but there's a Sephora inside and I do love Sephora!   The store itself was bright and well merchandised and if I hadn't just dropped bank at Sephora I would have stopped in the jewelery section because there were a few things that caught my eye.,UNK
11427,Came here on a weekday afternoon and found the place to be pretty empty even though it was prime lunch time. I ordered the salmon which was pretty good but nothing extraordinary. The service was good too and the ambiance was casual. It was a bit pricey for the quality of food we got.,UNK
11428,"Just came from here with a dozen box of Donuts, and a large Cappuccino Boba.  I didn't know Bobo and donuts went so well together!  The donuts are very good, but I think I will be coming back for the Cappuccino Boba.  Delicious!",UNK
11429,This place used to be great except their service has always been terrible. \nSo I started to just pick up my food to go but now their food is getting bad too! \nTheir desserts are the only thing saving this place.\nSuch a shame,UNK
11430,"The food is very good.  Convenient location.  The immediate parking area is always full.  Won ton soup is wonderful.  Try the kung pow shrimp. The service is great, they are very friendly.  And yes they do deliver!  You can't beat the lunch specials!",UNK
11431,Only good thing I can say about this place is the food was hot. Service sucks they don't pick up your plates or refill your drinks. Food was so-so. Defiantly NOT WORTH how expensive it is!!!,UNK
11432,"The employees are not nice, they had the nerve to give my friend old fries, and the dining area was not clean. 0000000 STARS!!!!",UNK
11433,"Great place if you can find a deal on rooms. It's cenrally located and has every amitinty you can ask for, not to meantion it's beautiful.",UNK
11434,Very nice people. Good service. Drunken noodles spiced 2+ on a scale of 1 to 3 were great. Very fresh ingredients. Tasty crab puffs. My wife enjoyed chicken noodles. The sticky rice served too early and rates 1star. Overall a place I will happily return to.,UNK
11435,Good selection of different poutines but otherwise nothing special.  Fries weren't the greatest and couldn't taste the pepper sauce.  Plus is that it's open 24h for those times when you got the munchies post bar hopping.,UNK
11436,Very nice sushi bar and restaurant. Service is unusually good for the valley and the Shumi is to die for. The sushi is passable nothing outstanding. Location is kinda weird but once inside the atmosphere is great.,UNK
11437,"This location is just a faux SB, it's run by the supermarket it's located in and you can tell.  THey don't take SB gift cards and the staff is rude and make terrible drinks.",UNK
11438,"Nice atmosphere, nice people, fresh food, flavorless and bland....can we have some seasonings or something please!",UNK
11439,"Hit or miss on service. Some of the staff is excellent, others are rude and not willing to accommodate even simple requests it substitutions. One child asked for a baked potato instead of fries and they refused. Even though other wait staff had been happy to do so previously.",UNK
11440,Had a margarita here. They put zero tequila in it and it cost $15. Ridiculous. Never again wil I come here nor do I recommend it. Like they are hurting for money. Save your time and money. Was there July 27th about 8:30...,UNK
11441,"I love love love little hole in the walls, not so much this one.  It was full of gangsters and dirty.  Their fish and produce was gross!  There was a line for the carne, but I wasn't willing to try.  Walked in.....walked out.",UNK
11442,Country fried steak and biscuits are good. Potatoes seasoned just the way I like them to be and mu egg fried prefect. I will come again to try other items :),UNK
11443,Just don't go.  We went for happy hour and was a joke.  Drinks were just deplorable. Apps were ok.  Service felt more like self serve.  Save your time and money.,UNK
11444,The worst hotel experience ever. I will write a longer review later about my horrible experience. I DO NOT recommend this hotel at all. DO NOT stay here.,UNK
11445,I don't kno why my friends keep dragging me here. I'm  never  coming  back here.  I was at the East location off of  Tropicana and I saw a mouse by the bar. Disgusting.  And why does it always smell like butt hole in there?  Health department needs to go in there.,UNK
11446,"Let's see, $40 for crab legs that aren't fresh.  I thought I was at Red Lobster.  Won't be going back.",UNK
11447,"It's super expensive, super stuffy, and just not worth it. Maybe we caught them on a bad night but restaurants who demand these kinds of prices shouldn't need a second chance, neither will they get one.",UNK
11448,"My fave place to get a quick mani-pedi. Can  get busy and the wait gets a little long, but they are great about making and keeping appts.",UNK
11449,"If you like to play the waiting game, come to prive.\n\nOh, also if gyrating mofos knocking you around is your thing, prive is the spot.",UNK
11450,Good food for a good price! This would be 4 stars if we hadn't waited 10 min before even getting our drink order in.,UNK
11451,Nice local place! Great late night specials and the bbq ribs are fall off the bone great.  The bartenders are friendly and know how to make a great drink.,UNK
11452,"Fish tacos were a bit dry and they needed a little bit more seasoning but the seafood chowder, breaded shrimp and French fries were fantastic. Staff was super friendly and helpful. We'll be back to try some other entrees for sure. Definitely be back for the chowder.",UNK
11453,"I really like the place.  I go on Thursday to the ballroom dance night.  They also have it on Monday I believe.  Also, I have eaten there a number of times and everything is excellent.  Good place for a bithday or party especially if your from the Phillipines.",UNK
11454,This place blows. Foods ok but service is terribly slow. Maybe I have just caught them on off days but I will go to Big Heng down the street from now on.,UNK
11455,"Guacamole. That's all you need. That and margaritas. Boom. Good meal. But really both were delicious. The food was okay, nothing out of this world but I still enjoyed it. The bartenders were awesome and really entertaining to talk to. Good experience all around.",UNK
11456,"I like this one, nice people, nice atmosphere, great location, I just for the life of me can't figure why whether in drive thru or in store, the service is sooooo slow and they often get drinks wrong! Not sure where the blame should go!",UNK
11457,"Good food, service a little slow, a little dated and you do have to put up with a lot of whiney elderly clientele who send the waiter back for a lot of petty trivial stuff that takes away from handling other customers,  more like babysitting seniors.",UNK
11458,"Boring, bland and over priced for what it is. Originally we liked it but prices went up and food quality slightly down makes it not worth going.",UNK
11459,"I tried straberry waffle, it was fluffy and delicious... Coffe was ok. This is comparable with a Denis (if you ask me)\nI Did not expect to much from this restaurant; andIi liked what was served at my table.",UNK
11460,"My regular spot for a yearly eye exam. The wait is usually reasonable and the optometrist has been helpful in answering my questions and offering advice. I don't buy my glasses here though, online prices just can't be beat. Location at The District is great for me and I plan to continue to come here yearly.",UNK
11461,"This is a quality market with good selection and good prices.  I was pleasantly surprised by their \""Grab and Go\"" options as well as their selection of individual, cool drinks.\n\nI'll come back again for quick meals, heat and eat snacks/meals and \""in-between\"" shopping trips.",UNK
11462,Worst service I've EVER EXPERIENCED at a restaurant. Sat there for 20 minutes before getting up and leaving. So if you like tap water and have lots of time on your hands try this place!!!,UNK
11463,"Nice place, good massage and great value for money. Wasn't too thrilled with the front desk service. Also, the person next to me kept snoring which was disrupted my experience.",UNK
11464,Dam good Sushi here.  Scallop roll was the bomb.  Me and the wife faught over every last bite.  The service was fast and fiendly with good portion sizes.  I also notice that the menu prices are about as good as anywhere with plenty of specials and lots of variety.,UNK
11465,Love this place! I've stopped here the last three times in Vegas. The food is pretty good but I come here for the margaritas! Patron Silver Chambord Margarita! All of a sudden I am thirsty...,UNK
11466,"Great pad, delicious curry and the best sticky rice and mango. Small portions and pricey but definitely still great. The place itself was hard to find and doesn't look like much from the outside, but the inside has a really nice authentic feel to it.",UNK
11467,"The location is perfect, next doors to our dentist... and I think their chicken is awesome... the Spicy Honey Mustard and Asiago Parmesan... also MUST TRY.... their homemade Asiago Chips... nice!!!",UNK
11468,"Custard filling is bland.  Also, lately their donuts have been making my tummy sick.  First time I thought it was me then bought more later in the week and sure enough my tummy was very upset again. I ended up throwing nearly a dozen donuts away. :(",UNK
11469,I give 2 stars for their hours. It's not the greatest feeling when you are embarrassed to hand off one dozen roses as a birthday gift after spending $70 on them cuz the presentaion was so poor. I would only recommend this place if you need emergency flowers at 1am.,UNK
11470,"Sorry, but $3.00 for a bagel with nothing on it?  Seriously?  I know this is North Scottsdale but really?",UNK
11471,"This Bojangles is new, modern, delicious and has quick service.  I go here only when I have a craving for a country ham biscuit - yummy!",UNK
11472,i.ivanov\nDon't bring your Volvo to this dealership for repair They mess up your car any time you bring you Volvo even for oil change.I bring my Volvo for oil change my air was working when i drove home no cold air. The service department is crooked  it's a jock  .,UNK
11473,I am from out of town and was looking for a place to get my nails done for a wedding. Found this place from reviews on Yelp and was really impressed with the staff and service :-) Good recommendation!!,UNK
11474,"I love Chipolte but not this location!! Food is always cold! and then when they add you meet they end up take half of it of like they put to much!! come one now Staff is pretty \""ghetto\"" sorry for the word but its true. Ill drive tothe Quedoba near by.",UNK
11475,After a crappy visit here the manager contacted me to invite me back and send me a gift card. I am still looking for my gift card 3 months later. I tried to email the manager with no response what a shitty establishment!,UNK
11476,"Drive-up ordering box broken for months, today at lunch ordered a Double Del Cheeseburger but they had no meat to make burgers.  Need I say more! Off too Whataburger.",UNK
11477,"We opted to dine from the vegan menu on our first visit to Bar + Bistro and were not disappointed.  Service was prompt and courteous and the meals were well seasoned, flavorful and well presented.  My favorite dish was the chilies stuffed with oats and all sorts of other goodness.  I'll be back!",UNK
11478,"Nice old school corner pizzeria.  These are a a dime a dozen in NY but in Phoenix, it's a special treat.  Can be very warm to eat here in the summer and there's not much in the way of seating so if you visit in the summer months, I would take it to go.",UNK
11479,Greedy! They'll resell your table like nothing.. The staff lack common courtesy. Dance floor is packed.. Take your money elsewhere,UNK
11480,"Overall the rooms were very nice, well appointed and clean.  I had an inside view of the indoor pool.  The indoor pool area does have the distinct smell of chlorine, but I believe they also have an outdoor pool.  Service was friendly and room service was pretty typical for a chain hotel.",UNK
11481,"Never again! I give this place -3 stars. One, for leaving the meat completely raw red. Second, the burger fell apart in my hands. Third, I found a thick black hair in my already shit*y burger. Worst place in all of the land. Such a waste of honorable time!",UNK
11482,Was told they deliver to Nellis Suites. Too bad I'll never know because no one answered my 6 attempts to call at 5pm.,UNK
11483,"Located right across from Symphony Hall, we decided to have a drink before a show.   Networks was not that busy with many watching the games on the flat screens.  We sat there for about 5 minutes, no one came by to greet us or take our orders so we moved to the bar and had a quick drink.  Not my first place for a drink downtown!",UNK
11484,Had to walk a ways to get to this place. When in Las Vegas you plan to walk a lot. The food was well proportioned. The fries were awesome and loved the special sauce.,UNK
11485,they had a nice section of plus sized dresses when I went in there this time...yea!  this place is fun to shop at and definitely not a secret to the die-hard shoppers here in the valley.  Be ready to fight for a parking spot in the lot or park around on the side with the library.,UNK
11486,"For being fast food, this place is great...I honestly haven't tried the actual food, but the frozen custard is rich and delicious.  The chocolate is really chocolatey and the mix-in options are great.",UNK
11487,"Real german food (sausage, etc) and decent beer in family friendly atmosphere.\n\nThis is one of the good joints.",UNK
11488,This review is based on the Drive Thru Only. All my experiences have been through the drive thru. The customer service at the driver through has always been superior. Friendly service with a smile. Orders were repeated. Cash handling has been accurate. All my orders have been correct. All my food has hot and fresh.,UNK
11489,We had beers and appetizers here.  It's a nice bar with lots of TV to watch the NFL playoffs.  The decor is also very nice and fun to be in.,UNK
11490,"Sadly, I was going to give 3 stars, the food tastes wonderful, but, shortly after leaving there, both my son and I got violently sick. I will spare details, but it was not the flu. No return trip for this family!\nWe had eaten the ground beef, my wife did not.",UNK
11491,Ok. Kind of overpriced. Beer selection is pretty good. Nice place to watch sports as the TV's are in a good location and big. $28.00 for a speciality pizza and $15.00 for a calzone...Meh... I think not. I get better pizza in LA.,UNK
11492,this place is weird. it's a facade of a city inside another city. but i have won $150 on a slot machine here within 5 pulls.,UNK
11493,"Ate here for my first night in Vegas before EDC. The food was okay, not nearly what the reviews had me expecting. \n\nMore importantly, I got food poisoning.  Not an awesome way to start my weekend. Stay away from this mediocre poison factory.",UNK
11494,I consigned a dress at this shop. I have made several attempts to contact the owner over several months. No return contact. Seller beware. Buyer keep in mind that the dress you might,UNK
11495,Absolutely horrible service. The waitresses need to brush up on their knowledge of drinks (you work in LAS VEGAS for God's sake) and work on their people skills. Rolling your eyes and attitude will get you no where in life.,UNK
11496,A pricy place in the airport. However we liked the club salad. And they turned it over fast for us. Good lookin' beer selection too.,UNK
11497,What can I say? I LOVE the hummus and pita. The Greek salad is also wonderful. The gyros and wraps also are very good. It is a small artsy atmosphere that I enjoy and has a European flare that is nice. They sometimes have live music on the weekends. It is a nice spot.,UNK
11498,I ordered food for delivery and they when I called they failed to mention that they charge for delivery and when I said thats fine they all of a sudden said that I was too far for them to deliver but according to yelp they are only less then 2 miles from me...I will never order from them again lying asses,UNK
11499,"Always enjoy ourselves here. Unprententious with great paninis, cheese and meat plates. North Peoria gem. Watch calendar for tasting events.",UNK
11500,This has to be some of the worst sushi and burgers I have had in a very long time.\n\nSushi was loaded with rice and not very flavorful.  Burger tasted like a frozen patty and again lacked character and flavor,UNK
11501,"I have loved this place for years, but tonight they lost me as a customer. We had a party of 5 for like an hour and a half, then a friend joined at the end for 15 minutes, while we ate dessert. So we were automatically charged for a large group gratuity. This is ridiculous! Rip off!",UNK
11502,Wings were not good.  They did not have any celery. Wait staff seemed distracted and not all that interested.\n\nLots of TVs for you sports aficianados.,UNK
11503,It's so pretty in here. They have a good selection but everything is pricey. If you don't have a Fry's rewards card I suggest getting one. We used my aunt's number since we don't live in AZ. At least this way she'll get the fuel points and I got the discount.,UNK
11504,They have some awesome bartenders. You'll always get your drink fast. . . . .wish the tv's were decent. Nice nice patio!,UNK
11505,"A great little retreat to enjoy French music, food and wine. They have a wonderful happy hour with 1/2 premium wines and a good selection of eats. Sit at the bar and enjoy.",UNK
11506,"Why does the line cook who handles the foodnot use gloves!?!? Is this not illegal?\n\nFor delivery, wait times are ridiculous - even in winter, 1 HOUR to receive food that is a 10min drive away, and arrives cold. NOT WORTH IT.",UNK
11507,"Sorry my friends, but it appears that this place has closed its door for good.\n\nIt also appears the laundromat next door is gearing up to expand into this store front.",UNK
11508,The Red Velvet pancakes was good Not Great like everyone Hype it up to be. Don't like that they close so early. Not everyone can get up so early in the day. People work all different hours in Vegas.,UNK
11509,"Still leaving 1 star because this place sucks... But hooters did reach out to me from my complaints on trip advisor and refunded 100% of what I was charged. So, I will give them kudos for that and handling this in a positive way for me.",UNK
11510,I got the garlic chicken and kalbi ...they both had great taste the bad thing was my kalbi was all fat :( mac salad was blah this was take out next time we will try dine in,UNK
11511,"arrogant, unprofessional, disinterested sales people.  We were treated poorly on 3 consecutive visits - basically treated as if we should be extremely humbled and grateful that they'd deign to sell us an Audi.  We didn't buy one - went across the street to Mercedes.  Far better service and professionalism.",UNK
11512,"There are better amusement parks, sure.  But Kennywood is traditional style including a wooden coaster.  http://www.kennywood.com/",UNK
11513,"Import connections triggered an electronic malfunction while changing my oil. When I took my car back to them, my problem was not prioritized, and also they tried to charge me for fixing their mistake. I will never ever take my german car to them. If you like your automobile take it somewhere else.",UNK
11514,Over priced for what you got.  Didn't see the slices only until we ordered that might have been better.  Very disappointed.  Also $6 for a soda is outrageous.,UNK
11515,"If you have 15 minutes open in your schedule, go ahead.  Maze took only a few minutes - seriously disappointing.  The Laser Maze thing was 1 minute for $5 -- really??  (BTW I totally love all the 5 star rvws, this Maze being their ONLY raving rvw).",UNK
11516,"Very nice and new hotel.  It is a bit away from the strip, so either bring a good pair of walking shoes, or extra money for cab fare. However, being a little distance from the strip can be a good thing, because it's quiet.  For the price, I would stay there again.",UNK
11517,They do a nice job and the staff is very friendly.The basic wash at $5 is a good valeu as they also dry off the car and do the interior/windows.,UNK
11518,Late lunch...... Large variety on the  menu. I had the filling station special (grilled ham and cheese) plenty of thin sliced ham with a very good Dijon mustard sauce. My friend had the fountain hill club wrap which was enough for two people very good! Service was prompt and courteous,UNK
11519,"Had the ceviche tostada, mister had the carne asada tacos. Both were ok. Queso fundio for an app. not good. Service was slow and I probably wouldn't go back.",UNK
11520,Dull and uninspired crepes with little taste and no finesse.\n\nAt least they do offer real maple syrup for $1.75 extra.\n\nClearly this place survives only on American tourists.,UNK
11521,"Solid!   Great cocktails, great service for our large group of 7, good food and good atmosphere!\n\nWe had a blast!",UNK
11522,Nope! Keep on looking if you want good food this is not for you. It looks nice and it's clean but food not worth stopping for. I take it back the dip was pretty good.,UNK
11523,After my internet problem was solved (installer plugged me into the wrong port and left old fittings on the lines according to the new tech that fixed it) overall the people you talk to are super nice- the cable and internet are just really not up to date...,UNK
11524,Absolutely horrible service. They refused to do propane after their streetlights come on even if it's a bright out tried to tell me he would get fired. Five people waiting for propane and he refused to come outside told me the propane tank turns off because the sun starts to set.,UNK
11525,"Food is tasty; however, food establishment REFUSED to honor purchased coupon from Living Social.  DO NOT spend your hard-earned money at India Palace.",UNK
11526,Haha pretty whack when we came. I am glad I didn't have to pay cover cause if I did I'd be pretty upset! Used my money wisely to gamble instead...,UNK
11527,"Good food, not to far from strip. And cheaper then most places around. Food is a little different then what I'm use to in Vancouver which is also cheaper. Place looks a bit sketchy, but who cares, food is good!",UNK
11528,"I'm not sure I understand the constant hype around Four Peaks.  It's your typical good beer, bar food restaurant. It is also very crowded and loud. It's good, just not as good as people make it out to be.",UNK
11529,Awful... not even mediocre. I am giving them one star out of sheer awe that they have managed to stay open this long.  I am shocked at the positive reviews and can only surmise that the owners have lots of family and friends or there are a lot of folks in this area who just don't know any better.,UNK
11530,"I think we need to go back and try the desserts on display. I was craving a chocolate chip cookie, and they had them wrapped in plastic. It was okay, but nothing special. Not really worth the $2.",UNK
11531,First time here. I ordered the beef & lamb gyro on a whole wheat pita. It was delicious. One of the better ones I've had. I love that they offer the wheat pita. I will definitely be back to try there other menu options.,UNK
11532,"If I do not get sick from the buffet, it might suddenly become worth 2 stars. The highlights were the price and the rubbery beef lo mein. The low lights were everything else, including the fact that the chopsticks gave me splinters.",UNK
11533,"After getting one of their \""famous\"" burgers, I really don't understand the hype. Mediocre food and mediocre service.",UNK
11534,Greatest French Toast on earth. \nNot cheap ..but well worth The price . It's a must every trip to Vegas for me .,UNK
11535,"Hype precedes realty here at Chocolat Bistro. Unfortunately the Las Vegas tourist TV plug doesn't help matters... It is a good crepe by non enthusiast standards, however this is Vegas,  so giddy up and REALLY indulge at a 4 star buffet!",UNK
11536,A few weeks ago I would have given this place a 5.  But it's now under new ownership (it's not Tony anymore) and I wasn't impressed.  They only put one coat of polish and charge an extra $5 to use the pumice stone.\n\nNever again!,UNK
11537,"Called to cancel my membership,   I was told I needed to coffee in.  Okay fine.  Came in and now I am told I can only cancer in person Monday through Friday b from 10:30 am to 7 p.m..   really?",UNK
11538,Thought to try something different and stopes by but it was not good at all won't stop again for sure. I ordered curry chicken with fried rice and wonton soup and the curry is worst I have tried and doesn't have any test the fried rice sucks. Would recommend to go somewhere els than trying here.,UNK
11539,"New location! same great service and tasty food. I got the cannelloni again and no regrets. I wish they had more pasta options, like cappelletti or other salsas like boscaiola!. Still, the antipasto is a winner!!",UNK
11540,"Chance, the bartender, makes this airport bar feel like a bar in a busy city somewhere.  She's hard working, straight asks for ID no matter what, cocktails have a good pour of alcohol.  I'd come here again.",UNK
11541,Delish!  Loved the crunchy cinnamon French toast.  The bacon was great also.  Portions are HUGE.  Will definitely go again.,UNK
11542,"Had the curry chicken...found it to be a bit bland,  Would come back and try again, this time trying something that isn't breaded.",UNK
11543,"Great happy hour spot.  Very tasty food and cheap prices during happy hour.  Use the Yelp check in to get a 1 cent house shot, which is usually 5 bucks.  Love the steak tostadas and the margaritas are excellent.",UNK
11544,"Troubleshooting was worthless, and irritating.  The service is intermittent.  Very frustrated, I have had the same issues with this company in Philadelphia as well...",UNK
11545,"Omg they give out toppings like they are going out of business and trying to make their last bits of food last.  I feel like I'm being rationed.  What the heck, how much can beans and rice really cost!?",UNK
11546,"Awesome southern inspired cooking with their own twist. You can't go wrong with much of anything on the menu, but it is a little pricey. The staff is great, ask for Johnny if he is working.",UNK
11547,I recently went to Henry's after reading wonderful reviews on Yelp. I had the pot roast meal that was absolutely amazing! The service was great and price was even better. I will be coming back as often as I can!,UNK
11548,Good thing they are expanding to several locations. Try their ready made hummus. My favorite is the spicy chicken wrap which is huge!,UNK
11549,Went to a wedding. The food was ok and the drinks were way over priced 5 for a soda and 6 for a bottle of water! Really! 16 for a mixed drink.,UNK
11550,"This is a surprising find in downtown Scottsdale.  Extremely sophisticated food, interesting takes on vegetables, small plates to share.  Really hip, relaxed environment.",UNK
11551,As a parent of a swimmer this is really not a great pool for watching a meet. The stands are small and the tiny results scoreboard is blocked by the crowd if not directly behind you. Parking is atrocious. The positive is the pool is pretty new and in good condition .,UNK
11552,"My cab was 30 minutes late -  I didn't receive a heads up from dispatch,  and they were reluctant to give me an  estimated arrival time. I almost missed my flight and will not be taking Union cab again.",UNK
11553,"Nothing special about this place. Drinks are weak (Especially the frozen ones) and overpriced of course. Message to the skinny pale blonde wimp at the entrance with the clipboard. You arent tough, you arent cool and you couldnt get laid in a womens prison.",UNK
11554,"How cool is this place?  Great staff and lots to do.  As mentioned, though, the lines can be incredibly long.  Don't expect to do everything in one day.  Luckily their passes are reasonably priced.  We met a father and son who were on their 49th visit there.  Wish we lived close enough to make this a weekly activity!",UNK
11555,Always mess up my Menudo.  Always ask for no pigs foot and they always add it. They might think this is funny. That's okay. Going to El Mirage from now on. Added picture.,UNK
11556,The food and service here were above average. The selection left a little to be desired at some high prices. The restaurant was comfortable but parking is certainly an issue in the bustling uptown area.\n\nI would like to see Jade Grille expand their menu offerings to appeal to a wider audience.,UNK
11557,This place needs better management. The food took a while to come out. Our server said there was only one chef and apologized. He did try hard to please us and gave us a free starter. Nice atmosphere. Food was very good. Not likely to go back due the overall poor service however.,UNK
11558,"Worst product for the price. One month after getting a $400 handbag from Michael Kors, it started to peel off on the handles and the body was falling. Went to store with receipt for help and was treated like s***. Michael Kors never again!",UNK
11559,Wanted to like this place but the quality of the food and the service just wasn't there for me. Plus something I ate there gave me a really bad stomach ache after.. So I'll stick to the other spots around town still.. Sorry guys.,UNK
11560,Most overpriced canned tomato soup and two bite green salad I've ever had--came to $19 with drip coffee. Complete waste of time even for the tourist trap that is Old Montreal. Coffee was extremely weak as well--you could see the bottom of the cup.,UNK
11561,"Terrible service, terrible food. This is not the same as Lindo Michoacan's although it has many similarities. \nDo not go.",UNK
11562,Frying chicken and shrimp and fish in the same grease is cheap and disgusting. If you don't mind it then maybe you will enjoy it. I was certainly not a fan. I'd rather pay more and get more than pay less and get a mess,UNK
11563,The same great food as their Phoenix location but it is just missing the same old school charm of the owner yelling at the cooks to get the food out fast.  It has a nice patio next to the ice rink. The main advantage of the Scottsdale location is the extended hours and larger seating capacity than their Phoenix place.,UNK
11564,"Stifled my pizza fix but I found the sauce a little too sweet.  The place was packed so they are clearly doing something right.  Employees behind the counter were very friend, great local feel.  Very little seating so be ready to grab take out if necessary.",UNK
11565,"This swap meet no longer exists! Was very disappointed when I went looking for it only to discover that it had been turned into a Mariana's Super Market. There is one further up the street on Bonanza and Owens but that location had so little stalls that I don't believe that it can be called a \""true\"" swap meet.",UNK
11566,"Not impressed. Food was barely warm, bland chicken parmesan, service was not service, lobster ravioli had ok sauce not what I expected from all the reviews. The balsamic vinegar was the highlight! Disappointed.",UNK
11567,Lots of beers. Good food. Nice staff. Tend to walk by you at the bar when you need a refill.\n\nAnd the bathroom stall door needs repaired.,UNK
11568,good place to grab a nice sit down lunch. order at the counter and food is brought to you. wine beer. pasta. good thin crust pizza. nice salads. kids menu. some outdoor seating to enjoy the great weather,UNK
11569,"My son asked for help to look for an item and he was told. ..\"" I don't know go find it\"". Thanks! Jerk. I've gone in before and gotten rude service. 99 cent store from here on.",UNK
11570,Horrible customer service! Walked in on a Saturday afternoon & there were several workers and we were the only customers yet no one said hello or offered help. We were looking for a new road bike but will never give business to a place like this that won't even offer help.,UNK
11571,"Been here once, loved the idea of it. The sweet lady that served us just kept bringing us different foods, I thought that was awesome. We had our 2 year old with us and she was sweet with him and catered to what little kids like. The food was decent, not exactly super memorable.",UNK
11572,"Great service, but the food was horrible!!!! The service was the the highlight of the night. Our server was friendly and always made sure we were take care of.  The food was over spiced, very salty and was heated in a Microwave. It was a pre made TV dinner. Would never return to this place!!!",UNK
11573,"As far as Taco Bell goes, this is one of the best. It is a very heavy traffic area, so I believe that keeps the food fresh at all times.",UNK
11574,"This used to be a favorite of mine, but recently when I eat there I do not feel well afterward. The quality of the food is no longer where it once was.  I will not eat here again,",UNK
11575,"Never disappoints! Great Union coffee and delightful pastries, and their deli cheeses and numerous ham, salami, etc are high quality and delicious!",UNK
11576,This Safeway is okay but it seems to be understaffed and there is no self check out! This store is almost a ghost town all the time and if you come here you will see. The only reason I give it a few more stars is because they have a Starbucks.,UNK
11577,"The great thing about my visit was the VERY cold beer.  The food was alright.  If I am going to splurge on wings, I have better options around here.",UNK
11578,I love UO but this store reaks of sewage.  Blech.  \n\nIf you wander around for a few minutes (and singe your nose hairs) you will get used to it.  If you have a weak stomach you are better off doing an about face and getting the F out.,UNK
11579,Very cool place to eat just outside of main Charlotte downtown area. I has the burnt ends and baked beans. Baked beans are AMAZING! 30 bucks for 2 people including an app. And you can smell it from the parking lot and shops nearby. My wife said the turkey sandwich is the best she ever had.,UNK
11580,Place is cool. Staff was friendly. Food is just ok. Nothing special. You would think this place had burgers that are to die for. Its not. I also tried the hotdog. Costcos hotdogs are better. no lie. A bit disappointed since I had such high expectations.,UNK
11581,Top of the world restaurant is a place you must visit when your in Las Vegas .The food is great and the service was the best.,UNK
11582,"Very disappointing-- Was so excited to eat here. Tried many dishes as we ate family style. Had 3 apps, 4 pastas, and 2 entrees. All the pastas tasted the same and everything was very salty. Will not be returning here. Very sad.",UNK
11583,Great place to take the kids. All-you-can-eat buffet plus video games for the little ones. Keeps parents sane.,UNK
11584,"The price is right, but the pumps are the slowest around. So slow that it isn't worth the savings in the heat.  There are also always pumps that aren't working making it difficult for customers to fill up. It's ridiculous.",UNK
11585,"No too bad of a place, bit a bit pricy for what you get. Atmosphere is fairly decent, but parking is terrible for that entire plaza. I probably would not go back unless I was meeting friends there that I really wanted to see. Decent selection of craft beers.",UNK
11586,"It was so hot on the day I went to this place, they were baking the pizzas on the roof! hehe!  I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the pizza, pretty damm good. I have 2 slices and one of Sicilian; all were just like NYC. The service was good too, unlike in NYC. :)",UNK
11587,It's a decent hotel that's in the middle of everything on the Strip...  Hopefully they renovate it shortly since some stuff is dilapidated.  The front desk girls here are cute too! =),UNK
11588,"great food, service and view of the Strip. Beautiful room. Yes, lunch fixed menu price is a steal. Go before they realize.",UNK
11589,"This place was priced very well.  I would rate the massage average, as the pressure was not deep pressure as requested, but it was very relaxing and I felt good afterwards.  Therapists were very friendly and the ambience was great.  They used some great aromatherapy techniques.",UNK
11590,This place has terrible customer service.  There is only one manager on duty at the front desk.  If u have any problems here they wont be resolved.,UNK
11591,"Nice simple place, good food - but not clear on why there is such a long waiting list to get a table. It's not that earth shattering...",UNK
11592,"This buffet is small but don't mistaken it because of the size of the restaurant. They also have special if you don't want to eat as the buffet. Not many variety of food but its still a great little place to grab some Chinese.  Will back again, hopefully he added more food.",UNK
11593,"Pretty flavorless... Barely warm, $15 for Stromboli combo.. Most confusing ordering process ever. The lady kept barking at me to choose a side but it doesn't say anywhere what the sides are.. Keep walking",UNK
11594,What great burgers!  Burgers are very unique.  I got the br\u00fbl\u00e9e burger which had burnt sugar on the bun and a fried egg.  Very cool!  The French toast fries were pretty greasy and over cooked but had potential.  Overall great place.,UNK
11595,Very friendly service but unfortunately their stock always seems low. \n\nI tried for several different types of walking shoes and they did not have my size in any of them.\n\nSo although they have great prices in the ads the actual stock is very limited.  But I always hope for the best.,UNK
11596,"I debated giving this a 2 for the price - it's very OP, but I saw this week you can get coupons in the val pack. It's a cute 'local feel' place - everything tasted fresh and adequate - I enjoyed that the toast from their bread was more than just your soft boring typical toast bread.",UNK
11597,"This Target is approaching Targhetto  and moving away from  Tar'jet...\nTime for a cleanup on Aisle 5 and a major make over!! Reorganize the Womens clothes and get it cleaned up , pronto!!",UNK
11598,Over priced and underwhelmed. The burger was ok the only memorable item was the bacon. The fries which I watched come out of the frier were forgettable. For a better meal at half the price I will stick to in n out.,UNK
11599,Horrible with descent service.  Margaritas pizza was simply cheese pizza with dried oregano and the spaghetti was bland.  The only thing I enjoyed was the Pinot,UNK
11600,"Feels a bit sparse in selection in comparison to the one in Boston. Zaras are always such a hit or miss, and this one was definitely a miss. The selection seemed a bit \""old\"" rather than trendy.",UNK
11601,Bad at calling back about schedule changes..or waits last minute for needing something. I had reschule 2 times with my work because of not letting me know ahead of time.,UNK
11602,Yummy WINGS.. waitress was attentive!nice experience!! luv buffalo chips with toppings on the side!!,UNK
11603,"YES!  Brought my bestie here for a pedi, because he needed it - BAD.  The girls are awesome, they joke with you, don't act like you're bugging them just being there, and the place is clean and nice.  I will be back!",UNK
11604,My family and I had been seated and we waited for 15 minutes for someone to take our orders. No one even offered us a drink. My dad had called for someone to take our order but none of the servers gave us any recognition. We then walked out and no one even noticed. They obviously do not no how to serve their customers.,UNK
11605,The absolute slowest Starbucks drive-thru I've ever been through.  Been through it 3 times with only 3 cars in it each time and it's take 15-20 minutes to get through it.  With only 3 cars in line!  I could see that with maybe 10 cars but not 3 each time!,UNK
11606,So y'all know I already hate Walmart NOW my Aunty scheduled these family photos with them and these people closed down with NO NOTICE not a phone call or anything BUT they went ahead and collected the money for our photos in advance to say I am PISSED does not begin to cover it!!!!,UNK
11607,"Workers were on-time, friendly, thorough and quick.  Carpet looks 100% better. Price was at the high-end of what was quoted over the phone but still decent as they also cleaned three throw rugs. Carpet took longer to dry than I was told but I would recommend them and will have them back.",UNK
11608,"I was introduced to this restaurant by my parents, as we found out later on this is one of their get away places... I love this restaurant the location is very nice for special occasions.... We have dined and lounged at their bar many many times.",UNK
11609,Do not waste your time. Sanitation grade is a 90. Overpriced for the quality. It costs $67 dollars from me and my two young children to eat there. I will not make that mistake again . I will not recommend this restaurant.,UNK
11610,Guilt-free guilty pleasure. Great for those days when you want to eat something delicious without feeling greasy after. I had one of their panini's and and loved it. I wish they stayed open a little later.,UNK
11611,"OMG, awesome wings! Casey Jones on Bell is always a great place to meet a bunch of friends. Service is always on point and the staff is super friendly. The food is never disappointing and always hot and fresh. It was disappointing to see the one on 43rd Avenue and Thunderbird close but I know that was a different owner.",UNK
11612,"Horrible, Terrible..........Overpriced!!! Tipical colombian place... But the food not good enough. The service really bad, slow and poor. They can offerd more because they can't.",UNK
11613,"My experience there was ok. No more. It's one of the new flavor of the month type of places. Service was good, a little pricey as was expected. But I wasn't left with the urge to return. Certainly not if I had to wait in line.",UNK
11614,Pretty average to less than average. I got a bacon burger w fries. Was really nothing to it. In fact if u eat there u leave full and can not remember what u ate.. not bad.. not good.. just there,UNK
11615,"Good food, but you are paying for the view of the Bellagio.  Go at night and try to get a table near the windows to watch the Bellagio fountains.",UNK
11616,"A spring training favorite and the last year it's in service.  I will be fascinated to see what the new stadium feels like.  I'm sure as long as it has beer that is Krausened and people from the St. Charles area, it will be fine.",UNK
11617,one of North America's premiere museums devoted to architecture and the built environment--FREE film screenings on Thursday nights from time to time--great bookstore,UNK
11618,Food is going down the tubes fast.  What a way to kill a restaurant!!!  BREAD CHARGE!!!!  REALLY??????????????,UNK
11619,"Save your dough not to mention time and go somewhere else. The place wasn't even a quarter full and we waited at least 30 minutes for our over cooked, over priced burgers. I'm chomping on some antacids as I write this cause my $40 burger is giving me indigestion, so sad.",UNK
11620,"What more can I say!? This place is fantastic for a chain. They are very friendly and the have a great business model! The food leaves something to be desired, but that doesn't mean it isn't good. They are a bakery after all!",UNK
11621,This is the worst place we have EVER eaten!!!! That's all I have to say!\nWait one more thing YUCK! I just threw up a little in my mouth after that horrible meal! Stay away! Treat it as if you would get A rash just for eating there.,UNK
11622,"I went to Blue Marlin a week ago. The bread was delicious and the fish was good, but I found it to be quite overpriced for such small portions. I don't plan to go back-- I feel like I could go somewhere else and get more food for those prices.",UNK
11623,Had dinner with the special banquet menu. Very disappointing. Food was not good. The crispy chicken was over done so it was dry and salty. The fish was small. And most disappointingly was the food wasn't cheap.,UNK
11624,"\""I don't no what happen..but..the food here was blah! Rice is not included with d main dish..not right. Rip off..don't bother\""",UNK
11625,"Great for people big on beef and pasta, not so great if you're more of a sushi and seafood fan. I liked Caesar's Palace's buffet better.",UNK
11626,"Tao beach on a Tuesday...dead and they still wouldn't let you use the couches without the promise of a $100 tab. Of course, who doesn't reach a $100 tab? ALL of the couches were empty ALL day. There were more people at the regular pool than this place.",UNK
11627,"Bagels are pretty good. A little kindness goes a long way though. I felt like I was being rushed and everyone behind the counter was annoyed and not very nice at all to customers or each other. They need to be patient, grateful and smile once in a while.",UNK
11628,"Nice staff. Good ice cream- it's a mix of Dreyers, Blue bell and one other ice cream. Open late which is great! Also have Sparkling ICE zero cal water- SO GOOD!",UNK
11629,Best rice I have ever had. Wonderful lunch had the chile relleno burrito and it was large and very tasty.,UNK
11630,"This place is horrible, the pho soup is so greasy, very poor service, I came here looking for great pho but instead it was a dissapointment, I was out of town and leaving Arizona that day and wanted some Pho and it was unpleasant.",UNK
11631,"I have been here several times and the donuts are good.  They have a nice selection, like most places do.   Everything appears to be made on site since there is a kitchen in the back.\n\nThey also offer a variety of sandwiches for breakfast and lunch.  Starting at $3.99 for a combo.",UNK
11632,Real cool place.. And a shout out to the waitress who did not kick me out for breaking like 10 glasses! it was a accident i swear.,UNK
11633,The two star review is solely because the restaurant was closed at 6:25 PM when I went by to pick up dinner. Very disappointing when an establishment does not uphold their posted hours.,UNK
11634,"If your goal is to eat stuff, but avoid a place that serves meat, then this is your spot.  However, if you seek decent food that holds up to comparison with actual restaurants rather than your high school cafeteria, then you may be disappointed.  This is truly mediocre, yet totally veg, fare.",UNK
11635,Over priced and under whelmed I'm a sugar junkie but when your lemon bar is so bad I actually throw it out over eating it that's pretty bad.  I've tried this place a few times and its just horrible,UNK
11636,Their lunch specials are always quick and delicious. Reasonable price for lunch and you can get your appetitie going with chips and salsa.,UNK
11637,Go sit at the Bar.  The drinks are great and the SUSHI is very good.  The women in there are smokin hot.,UNK
11638,"Happy hour drinks were overpriced and under poured, the service on the patio was super slow and unprofessional, and the appetizers were bland.\n\nThe lone bright spot was the walleye appetizer. I would go back for that but will most definitely sit at the bar for quicker service.",UNK
11639,Food here is good. It's a 24 hour restaurant. We had the #16 and #20. Will definitely be back. The place is really busy. We were in there around 11 and it was packed. As we were leaving there were folks lining up to get in. They have so many items on the menu.,UNK
11640,"A friend ordered a Vesper here, which was advertised to contain Belvedere vodka. Instead, he saw the bartender pour Stoli into the glass. Top shelf prices for low quality liquor? Cmon now Cosmo.",UNK
11641,What a pleasant surprise!  Talk about JUICY BURGER...this place cooks/grills to order.  I had the buffalo burger that just melted in my mouth.  highly recommend this place if you want a good burger in Vegas.,UNK
11642,This is one of the better restaurants in Vegas!!! Service/Food excellent!!!  Outdoor seating of the water show Amazing!! We always make this a regular dinner stop on our Vegas trips!!! You will never be disappointed!,UNK
11643,Meh. I find it hard to like a place that charges upward of $9 for a burger but doesen't include fries. On the upside the chocolate shake is great!.  The burger was better than good but less than great.,UNK
11644,"My favorite coffee place. The staff are awesome and the atmosphere is great too! Free wi-fi, lots of places to sit and great drinks!!",UNK
11645,"Know what sucks about this place?  As you sit here having a late night snack before stumbling back to your hotel room, you realize that there are about 10,000 better places in Vegas that you could be.  \n\nYou came to Vegas for this?  Seriously?  Get the fuck outta here and hit the clubs!",UNK
11646,"Just checked in and found out that there's no wifi in the room, no HDTV and you'd think they'd offer a discount or credit to us disabled veterans on Veteran's Day Weekend. .... never stay here again.",UNK
11647,I went here once to get my pants hemmed and got yelled at for not purchasing proper pants in the first place. I was too startled to respond but have since thought of many  witty replies. Oh well.,UNK
11648,"Fuck this place, I waited in line for 2hrs and they cut me off zero s stars as far um concerned . Horrible costomer service. Don't go their.",UNK
11649,Definitely not what I expected. Flavors were great but was left some what hungry. Meal was messy and our waiter was kind of frazzled. Like he didn't know what he was doing or how to answer our questions. Not sure if we will come back.,UNK
11650,"What a waste of time.   Been here before and it was fine.   I had no problems.   Apparently, the people who work here kicked my friend out of this place, for no reason.    And?   My friend got jumped right outside of that place.",UNK
11651,"If you like long lines and awful customer service this is the store for you.  Plus if you want a drink at their Starbucks, and dont mind waiting at least 15 for the guy to make your drink.  Then you truly have a store that fits your every need.  Wish it wasn't the only grocery store close to me",UNK
11652,Remind me to never come back here. The employees are crazy and the customers even crazier. Two stars cause I like the food.\n\nEmployee wanted to argue with me about cell phones. Customer wanted to argue with me about the health of beanie wells.,UNK
11653,"Yummy! Ate here on the east coast, so glad they brought it out west! I love how you can customize your toppings for no additional cost, it's a very meaty burger though. Fries are so so but the burger is worth trying.",UNK
11654,"If you advertise a breakfast menu and also advertise you open at 8 am...since most employed people get their breakfast between 7am and 9 am, I guess that makes sense...I see no reason why you'd have your doors locked at 8:33am and waste my time and gas.",UNK
11655,"The \""moving sidewalks\"" make it efficient to get to your gate quickly through the hustle and bustle. \n\nNot enough time for food between connections, so no comment.",UNK
11656,This is my favorite place for chicken... everytime i stop in charlotte my first stop is at bojangles....,UNK
11657,"Horrible. There's a reason its so cheap.\n\nDry burger, and the guys obviously have no idea how long it takes a potato to cook, because mine were still raw.",UNK
11658,"~$44 for dinner and a 30min wait were worth it.\n\nKing crab, prime ribs, briskets, cream puffs, crepes, you name it and they have it... done to perfection, at least by buffet standards.",UNK
11659,Went here with some colleagues for a drink after work. Seemed like a great place for 20 somethings looking to get drunk and have a night at the bar; however was a bit noisy and too much like college for us.,UNK
11660,"This place is nothing special. What really needs to stand out at pho places is the broth. If their broth isn't amazing, most pho places are just ehh. As for Mr. Sandwich, their broth was decent. Nothing special, but not awesome. It was pretty cheap though and for a decent size.",UNK
11661,Great staff. Fun atmosphere. Be sure to try the veggie melt--I'm not even vegetarian and thought it was delicious! Parmesan fries are also worth the extra dollar.,UNK
11662,"This Macy's is terrible.  This may sound ridiculous but it's worth driving across town to go to the one is Scottsdale.  The selection here is horrible, the staff are unhelpful and everything always seems to be out of stock.",UNK
11663,"It's a typical Panda Express, but the plus is that they have a drive-thru. I'm not typically a fan of Panda Express, but I was in a rush and I was hungry, so I sped through the drive through and it's quick and pretty good if you're on the run.",UNK
11664,Food was cold! Not so great service only one waiter was taking car of everything such as bussing seating and wait inert and other waiter was so lazy. Five stars to the one guy in that whole place.,UNK
11665,Hands down the best Chicken Gyro and/or combo plate I have ever had.  MUST have the lentil soup cause you will find no other like it.  REALLY REALLY big fan of Babylon Gyro and the GREAT people who own and operate this establishment.,UNK
11666,"We visited while in town for work, and had a nice evening on the patio with some sangria (both white and red were yummy) and a couple of tapas. The servers were a tiny bit slow, but very nice. Overall a good visit!",UNK
11667,"Long lines, food is just okay.  The list of menu offerings is reasonably authentic but the quality of the individual items is only just okay.",UNK
11668,I was disappointed with booking a room here & attempting to check in was ridiculous after a long days journey. Beautiful place otherwise but stay the night somewhere else.,UNK
11669,"I would not recommend going here.  There are so many better options.  The food was very dry and made 2 of us sick.  They do not serve alcohol and the meat tasted months old.  Save yourself, don't go.",UNK
11670,"This place was decent enough.  Nothing stood out about it though.  Service was good....waitress was friendly and made good recommendations.  Decent margaritas.  With so many other restaurants in the area we probably wouldn't choose this place again, although I might try out their happy hour somtime.",UNK
11671,"Awful service, mediocre food, will not return. For a lunch that cost us $111.00 we would have fared better at Panda Express or Chick Fil-A....skip this place, not worth it.",UNK
11672,"We've eaten here frequently but have cut back due to poor service and high prices, compared to other bakery cafe's in the area.  Paradise and Wildflower are both within a mile or two (Arrowhead locations), and offer more choices.  Recently, when presented with a problem, manager on duty expressed no desire to resolve.",UNK
11673,Great food and excelent service.  Highly recomend this First Watch to anyone.  Only complaint is that there is not one where we live.,UNK
11674,Not a fan. Ordered the fish and chips--they were greasy and bland. We had a waitress who didnt have a clue and never checked on us. Overall bad experience. I wont be back.,UNK
11675,Worst customer service reps I have ever dealt with. They're rude on the phone and on site. About to terminate my membership with them.,UNK
11676,"ummmm no.  \nSure its fast but , its really greasy and more greasy..\nNo thanks..",UNK
11677,"Great place for good food n great music. \nDimly lit nice atmosphere , the staff are very friendly and courteous to tourists , even help us to Ina a place to hang out after we ate ... Great food, good service and fantastic music !!!!!",UNK
11678,"This store gets one star specifically for the soul fact that one of the baristas made it his job to tell me that my beverage order was \""DISGUSTING\"" multiple times. Guess what? Being in guest services for 8 years, I know better than to talk down to/about a guest or their order.",UNK
11679,Go here probably to often but oh we'll. the food is normal for t bells but be sure to check any special order especially drive thru orders. Seems every time I say no tomatoes I get extra tomatoes.,UNK
11680,I've eaten at over 40 pizza places in town. I think this place has the best Chicago style pizza in Vegas. People are friendly and the price with coupons is unbelievable.  Well eat again.,UNK
11681,Enjoyed a yummy lunch using Ballantyne discount card for a great deal. Chicken soup was full of flavor with big pieces of chicken. Quarter chicken was crispy and juicy,UNK
11682,"lovely to look at but ac up way too much in the building, hard to get a seat inside when they have a whole floor off limits,",UNK
11683,"pf changes but faster, right?  decent prices and pretty good food.  not paying for the crowded atmostphere of course, but the food is really consistent so if you find something you like (which you probably will) it is a good consistent chow hole...",UNK
11684,"If I could give 0 stars I would. There is always a long long line to check out . Place is a constant zoo unless you're there at 6am. Pharmacy customer service is horrible! Also if you bring your kids , look out for all the people that drive around in the scooter carts, they apparently think they own the store",UNK
11685,"Sat in the patio area, very nice with the heaters. Started with bean dip, really good. Chips and 3 salsas were great. Cheese/ chicken enchiladas were really tasty. Tortilla soap was good. Service was a bit slow, more servers were needed.",UNK
11686,If you are looking for a great old steakhouse off the stop and out of the hotels this is the place. Don't let the outside scare you off. You'll get a good deal for about $75-100 you'll get prime quality beef and a few sides.  Try the caesar salad tossed table side. Awesome.,UNK
11687,"I come here at least every couple of months because it's close to me and has great subs. It's usually not very busy which is a plus, and my food usually comes out pretty quickly.",UNK
11688,"Run for the hills this is the worst hospital ,(as far as docotors )I've ever been to...the nurses were nice...",UNK
11689,Poor customer service- I called ahead of time to make an appointment. She told me to come in there was not a wait. I get there 10 minutes later and she tells me I now have to wait a half hour since they got busy in those 10 minutes. Wasn't that the reason I called ahead. I will not be returning.,UNK
11690,"This location is probably my least favorite. It is very noisy here all the time. The food is ok but not always great, kind of hit or miss. Service isn't bad but also not great like the signal butte location or val vista.",UNK
11691,You must try the big unit hot dog bases loaded! It is amazing how large that one hot dog is and is great to share with a group of friends. We all have different tastes but all of us enjoyed it. I wish more fries came with it though because it is equally as amazing. Eating here always has a fun atmosphere.,UNK
11692,"I've eaten at PF Chang's a few times and it is always a C-.  I really didn't like any of the dishes I had this time and I think I have to remind myself that even when desperate and starving, I should find somewhere else to go.",UNK
11693,"We get our first and this year second drink here on our yearly trip to Las Vegas. Order up an incommunicado, grab a seat on the bar overlooking the side walk and people watch. You are inches from the pedestrians on the strip.",UNK
11694,"Horrible!  False advertisement.  If you have purchased a groupon or a deal for this cinema, they will not honor anytging.  Even if their cinema is listed as participating. The manager Janet was very cold & obviously did not care!",UNK
11695,"Great food and charming ambience!  We ordered about 6 dishes for 4 people and shared. My favorite dish was the hamachi and the soft crab salad. \n\nExpect to spend, portions are small and prices are high..... Treat yourself!",UNK
11696,Horrible money hungry girls. So many that you never have a chance to breath. Many of them are fat! Hustlers is better!,UNK
11697,Paid $15 for a signature ice cream and it was melted before I even received it. Waiter said it was due to the humidity but really that's no excuse since its Vegas. Not worth your money.,UNK
11698,They now take credit/debit cards. This makes it easy and convenient. My morning dash to the ATM was unnecessary. Cash in pocket - swipe of the card- fingerprints completed in under 20 mins... I'm a happy camper!,UNK
11699,Tried this place for the first time and the food was good.  We ordered the lasagna dinner.  It was reasonably priced and came with French bread and a small salad.  We also tried their Stromboli...also very good!,UNK
11700,"Beautiful stadium, especially at night. Try the Arizona Club in the second deck, right field...your game ticket gets you a seat over looking the field. $34.95/ gets you a terrific buffet, served on white linen tablecloth with all the trimmings.",UNK
11701,"oh, i forgot to mention that they HIRE  people to dance on the dance floor. LOL!\n\nthat's how you know it's bad. :|",UNK
11702,Good price but the food was only so so.  I probably won't go back.  There are too many great places to eat in Vegas to settle.,UNK
11703,if u hav been to medival times in buena park\n\nthe show with the knights is very similar and the food is similar too\nits quite interesting,UNK
11704,Shave was OK but WAY overpriced. Don't waste your money. Go to older established barber shops for a good shave at a reasonable price,UNK
11705,"Food had nice flavor but the restaurant is so loud that it ruined the experience.  2 cocktails, 2 guacamoles, chicken taquitos, 2 types of tacos and refried beans for $78.  Didn't mind the portion sizes or the price but I wouldn't return again because of how noisy it was.",UNK
11706,"It could have all 5 stars if the service was better... Food is very good most of the times, but yesterday my pork kebob had way to many bones! They made me wait for my drink and then for my sauce, so if you like your food without soda and ketchup go for this place:))",UNK
11707,"Yes, it's yummy but oooooo my tummy :( Unfortunately, I am lactose intolerant and there are no vegan options to choose from. I would definitely go back if they gave me milk free options. I loved the pearls!",UNK
11708,"Service a little slow but when I think about the quality it all came together. Great food! Ambience was great for two people, romantic dinner in a both. Menu it's mostly steamed, broiled and fried very little chargrilled items.",UNK
11709,Order fish and shrimp grilled for tacos!!! So good! We sat outside today and they had two men playing authentic music. Great atmosphere :),UNK
11710,"Very cool! There is not much to say that the other reviewers have not covered--this show is amazing. Acrobatics, skaters on half pipes, people flying around on bungee cords expertly choreographed to the Fab Four's famous tunes. A visual delight that kept my eyes darting and my breath bated.",UNK
11711,"There are no complaints here.  Sure it is a little cheesy, but it's FREE.  I hate when people complain about free stuff.  No one is forcing you to watch it.  Plus, it is really cool to watch from the patio of Social House.",UNK
11712,"The service was exceptional...like nothing I've ever experienced.  Unfortunately, I can't say the same for the food which was borderline inedible.  I honestly don't think that I would ever go back (even if I were offered a free meal).",UNK
11713,"I want to LOVE this place!  However, after getting 2 botched haircuts from 2 different stylists I have learned that the super cute location and decor does not make up for my need for a straight hair style.  Disappointing.",UNK
11714,"Only $8 for a really neat museum in an AMAZING building?  Sign me up!\n\nI really enjoyed perusing the collection - very thought provoking pieces, and the little audio guide was easy to use and provided lots of interesting insight.  We had tons of fun taking pictures with the sculptures outside too :)",UNK
11715,"Great atmosphere, great food and love all the little extras they bring you as you wait for your meal.  And cotton candy at the end! Too pricey for me to eat dinner there every weekend but a good place to go if you don't mind $100+ for dinner and drinks for two.",UNK
11716,"I went in for and met the Dr. very, very briefly. We decided not to do anything. I still got a bill. I don't recommend going here.",UNK

11718,"Frequent their quite often, will probably never go back after tonight. Rich is gone from what I hear and the bartender tonight in his place had quite the attitude. She might get her drinks right if she got off her phone while making them. Sounds like Rich went to Sago's I will be spending my money their instead.",UNK
11719,"Carry ons?  we got to carry them up to the plane then they asked everyone for the bags and ended up putting them in storage anyway.  wtf???  What does \""carry on\"" mean then? am i confused?",UNK
11720,"3 words: Chicken Fried Steak! Treat yourself and order it! Most of the times I've been here it's been packed yet they still managed to seat me within a few minutes. When you combine great service, with great food, and huge portions - you've got a customer for life in me!",UNK
11721,"Let's be honest. Gigantic frozen daquari's are the draw, and they're worth it! also, REFILLS are around $8 but a fresh glass is twice as much, so make a few trips to make it more worthwhile =)",UNK
11722,"Cool little place, you can they've been there forever and have a great following.  The biscuits and gravy were okay but nothing to write home about.",UNK
11723,the guy has issues.\n\nI think unless your're a good looking girl won't even help you. \n\nDon't waste your time,UNK
11724,"I've never been a big fan of mall restaurants or bars. Though this is an improvement over Maria Maria, I'll go back if hunger or thirst kick in while shopping, but its not worth going out of your way for.",UNK
11725,"Whaddya expect? Well, it's a good middle-level chain restaurant with a lot of noise and activity and decent food. If that's your thing, you'll find this place just fine. I like from time to time, but others better.",UNK
11726,Got a nice yogurt parfait here- YUM!!!  Various flavors of yogurt (I got original and pomegranate) layered with a mix of berries and kiwi and granola on top- a perfect breakfast start!!  SO glad this is in this airport!!,UNK
11727,"This place might not be so \""visually appealing\"" thats okay, im not coming in to admire the floors and walls, I come for a tan, in and out. Stopped in here over the weekend and took advantage of some of the deals I was offered. The girl behind the counter was very informative. Cant complain.",UNK
11728,"It's typical USPS, big building, quite fast service although it was busy as always. \nThe thing was, I couldn't find public restroom in here. Well, I can't complained since all the USPS in here no restroom for public (I guess)...",UNK
11729,"So far, not impressed.  Was told it would only be 20 minutes in and out for 10 min oil change.  It's now going on 30 min and just saw them pull my car back to start the oil change.  Not happy about being lied to.  If they can't be honest about the wait time, can they be trusted for anything else?",UNK
11730,Really disappointing. The inside is nothing great at all. It really  doesn't stand out. The restaurants and places to eat were not that great at all.,UNK
11731,"This place is terrible.  Utterly disgusting.  I had their trademark Blue Burrito and nothing about it was good.  All I wanted was one last good burrito  before leaving Arizona, and I should have eaten at the BK nearby. Yes, it was that bad.  STAY AWAY!",UNK
11732,"Don't bother. The three draft beers our group tried were tasteless, even after we specified we prefer hoppy brews. The Irish Stew, a signature dish, had the consistency of chili, rather than having recognizable chunks of meat and vegetables, and was overly salty. Decor is passably pub-like.",UNK
11733,"Waaaaay too flippin slow! I walked out. I wanna grab coffee and go, not stand in a line with two people In front of me for 4 minutes.",UNK
11734,Get to the airport early and relax with a nice drink and some tasty food at Chelsea's Kitchen @ Sky Harbor Airport. \n\nGood beer selection.\n\nTasty appetizers.\n\nWait staff is friendly.,UNK
11735,Once again I decided to call ahead and was told there is a long wait about 45 minutes. Decided not to go again. what kind of place everyday has such a long wait for dinner and it is only 5:30pm on a Tues in summer. Give me a break. I will wait until all of the hoopla dies down.,UNK
11736,This pizza is really really frickin good. I like the arugula. Go here when you go to trader joes. The other restaurants aren't as good,UNK
11737,"Not the greatest service but sure they have some killer burgers in here and belive it or not a 24/7 joint aint that easy to find in Las Vegas these days, esp. not downtown.\n\nThis is one of the few places in vegas that serves Coca Cola and not Pepsi.",UNK
11738,From the GM to the day front desk clerk. EVERYONE was extremely helpful. I was there due too the fox group and I must say it made me smile too stay at this very cool place. Close to restaurants and clubs. The room was classy and very clean. Bed was comfortable.,UNK
11739,Great place to hang out on Thursday nights and Saturdays. I come here with my friends when we want a change of scene from old town. The bars are cool and id check out gringo star and el hefe. Mill is fun just be careful on the streets alone. Also la boca is great along with z Tejas and ra.,UNK
11740,This place is a bit out from the strip. The casino is OK looking - new and clean. Lots of parking of course....and the fake grass in the front is pretty awesome. At least this casino is being conscious about their environment that there is not enough water to water their grass outside..so the fake turf is awesome.,UNK
11741,3 words - s car go\n\none of the few places that serves it and they do a bang up job\nthrow in a Manhattan and I'm happy,UNK
11742,"Been here a few times since my last review and the food has been consistently good, so I think that deserves a star upgrade and I now think this place has the best Jerk Chicken in Las Vegas. The Curry is nice and the Meat Pies have a good spicy bite to them. Of course I'll be back.",UNK
11743,"I've eaten here once after having it suggested by numerous people, I was totally disappointed with the service, food, and the place itself, I will not be headed back......ever\nSave your money, or starve either would be a better option",UNK
11744,"They carry Tito's vodka, so my Texas friends are happy!! The band was really good and the DJ filled in while the band was on breaks. Very entertaining!  We didn't eat here so I can't tell you about the food, but the drinking and dancing is good!",UNK
11745,"Overrated.  The concept is great, it's the execution that is lacking.  Jerk chicken was nowhere near spicy enough, jade chicken was too sweet.  I want to like this place, but it didn't really do it for me.",UNK
11746,Wasn't impressed with their Honey Walnut Shrimp. But their deep fried King Crab was delicious! Garlic fried Tofu was tasteful.,UNK
11747,"The first time I ever went to Smashburger was here... The girl working the cash register was extremely nice and helpful, but it took awhile to get our food (not that many people were there) and the food was mediocre. Probably will not go back.",UNK
11748,"Just ok.  Not very much meat in #8 grill chicken sandwich.  Ordered 2 iced coffes, but they could only make 1.  I still choose Hue Tai for vietnamese sandwiches.",UNK
11749,"As far as the sushi goes, I'll have to pass from here on out. I can never understand why this place is so packed as it is when I pass it sometimes. Oh, I know why. Because people are clueless. Yes, that's it. (And it has a good location.)",UNK
11750,"The maple bacon cupcake was amazing, as for the others we tried, nothing special. The macaroons were yummy though.",UNK

11752,"I went there as treat for my birthday with two of my closest friends..The prices..well is a bit pricey, but the food there is asboslutly mouth-watering! The service there was slow... it took about 25 mins. for the waiter to come and ask us for our order.",UNK
11753,"Only 10 miles from the strip, but a 25 minute drive because of all the lights.\n\nThis location is less busy, way newer, way cleaner, and way spacier than the Paradise location.\n\nFood portions are small and pricey, but very flavorful.",UNK
11754,"It's a cute place from the outside, VERY small inside, and the food is really mediocre.  The hamburgers were barely edible and the fries weren't even as good as McDonald's.  The servers were nice but I won't go here again.",UNK
11755,Listen to the guy that said this place says one hour then it progressess. Horrible wait times. The guy was greasy and gave me chills. I felt like my car was being violated,UNK
11756,"Good food, decent prices, and the service at this location is good. \nI love the new Jalape\u00f1o Chicken Sandwich!",UNK
11757,20 minutes I have been waiting around and asking for assistance from someone to make 2 simple wood cuts for me. There is NOBODY around here.,UNK
11758,"I am sad that this excellent bakery only has two reviews! The assortment of pastries and breads is very fine, and overall Mr. Pinchot should be considered one of the best boulangeries in the city. It is hard not to want one of everything when you stop by.",UNK
11759,"Went early tonight, Wed., to beat the crowd but we beat the main cook. Salad was wilted, main course lacked flavor other than the taste of the scorched vegetables. Our previous visit was just ok but this was our last visit.",UNK
11760,If yelp had a 0 star option I would choose that! \nWORST place to get threading done!! They NEVER hear to what the customer want. Its been a couple of times I have been here and this would be my last time.,UNK

11762,"Terminal c needs new carpet and more electric outlets. Not as bad as LaGuardia, but with all of the airport fees it should be spiffed up once in a while.",UNK
11763,Finally went to check it out in the afternoon and really enjoyed the food.  I was expecting a new decor from the previous Lis Doon Varnas but nothing had changed. The atmosphere on a Sunday afternoon was a bit blah but the food was good.,UNK
11764,"If you have estate changes, good luck.  Their forms are ridiculously long and take a lot of time to figure out.   Customer service is only available by calling 800 number, so good luck with the long wait times and multiple call backs required to finish paperwork.   Ughhh!",UNK
11765,"One of my person favorite haunts, the employees are all friendly, the food is good and the beer is amazing. This place is always packed being right next to the college",UNK
11766,"Last time I went it was about 3pm on a weekday and there were 3 guys sitting at the bar Ttalking with a male bartender.  I stood there for approx 5-7 mins before I was even acknowledged.  Needless to say, they haven't gotten any more of my business",UNK

11771,I'm only low-balling it because I had high expectations and felt like there wasn't a lot of filling in my sandwich.\n\nGood flavors though.,UNK
11772,"Cafe has new owners that are very nice as well as the staff.  We ordered burgers, fries, salads, and grilled ham and cheese sandwich.  All were delicious!",UNK
11773,"Open late which is great, but the food was just OK, certainly better burgers out there. The milkshakes on the other hand are not to be missed! We had the adult milkshakes - one with Twinkies and one with Sour Patch Kids. Will definitely go back just for milkshakes and skip out on the food.",UNK
11774,I am so disappointed by the food at this establishment. My husband and I both ordered the Sheperd's pie and it was bland. Definitely not worth the price of $12 a plate.,UNK
11775,Horrid. This is my fourth time to Vegas and probably my 10th to a place like this. Wine was bad-even your mid range price wine should be good. The mix of flavors though risky and supposed to be exciting was just stoopid. Go to Prime or Nobu.,UNK
11776,"Don't waste your time or money.  The service is poor and the food is below average, nothing to write home about.  The restaurant is also very small.",UNK
11777,Bomboba is the BOMB simply put.. The Thai tea blended is my fave Ive had it many times. Although it does depend on who makes the drink for maximum goodness. Plus the frequent Bomboba drinker punch cards are an awesome incentive. Look forward to trying somethin new soon..,UNK
11778,"Atmosphere is great as restraunts is modern and has a nice open environment.  Food was good, nothing extremely special though in the food department as I felt it was normal. My husband and I both got the pizza and although it was good it was nothing to write home about.",UNK
11779,"Only TWO $50 hold em poker tables? TWO??  This place is massively huge, it's the size of an entire block.  And they have TWO hold em poker tables with $50 buy-ins.  Next thing available, $300.  Pretty ridiculous.",UNK
11780,"My family came from out of town and they are hard to please because of their pickyness. But, I will say Pita Jungle isn't too bad, I just felt like I was entering in hipster territory.. But I digress, it was good food our waitress was very helpful.",UNK
11781,"The outdoor patio area is very charming and the restaurant is very clean and well decorated. The food was alright, I prefer the Mangoes location on Main St. in Mesa over this one. We ordered a bean dip, bean tostada plate and cheese enchiladas. I would go back if I was passing through.",UNK
11782,They get 2 stars because of the employee not there prices. She was very helpful and happy. But 22.00 for 1 box small bag of packing peanuts and very small roll of tape. What a ripoff.,UNK
11783,Wow. Omg. Wow to the garlic shrimp arepa. SO flippin good! I'm so mad I didn't get 2 lol. One star off bc the beef empanada I got was just ok and nothing special. I can't wait to go back already for more arepas!!!,UNK
11784,"I enjoy the take out section and the grocery selection of \""healthy foods\"" I cannot find elsewhere.  Most especially, I enjoy the produce and amazing cheese selections they have.  \n\nFrom the take out section, I enjoy the sandwiches, salads, and lasagna.  Always tasty and fresh.",UNK
11785,Ha! Only in Scottsdale could this pass as pizza. \n\nThe bruschetta was salty and soggy. The pizza was barely edible. The menu had misspellings on it...the prices were outrageous. I'll take Tessio's any day!,UNK
11786,HOCKEY!!  It's got a real ice rink... for those from the north.  Some video poker.  Food ok... but again... HOCKEY!,UNK
11787,"Food is okay. I got the Thai chicken salad and it had too much mint in it which was unpleasant. Bartender Travis is awesome. Hostesses sucked (seemed clueless and did not adequately tend to waiting customers), and the waitress was a little kooky (not in a good way). Restaurant was way too cold to be pleasant.",UNK
11788,I thought the food was ok. Not amazing. My girlfriend did not like the upstairs bathroom one bit! She did like the horses on the ceiling though. I really liked the tortilla chips.,UNK
11789,"Horribly overpriced poor greek food.  I have been to every greek restaurant in town and this is by far the worst.  Save your money and time, eat anywhere else but here.",UNK
11790,Do not go here. I was yelled at in the resturuant and called names and my food tottaly disgusting and I was refused a replaced order and my money back. I hope this place burns down. I do not reccommnd this place.,UNK
11791,"Good stuff. Ordering can be a little awkward sometimes, but the food is worth it. Love the polish sausage with sport peppers and grilled onions. The fries are crisp and tasty too.",UNK
11792,Bookman's is kept up much better than any other used book store I know. They have a nice selection of used electronics as well.,UNK
11793,"Pretty good burgers. Outdoor seating. Cool place to hang out and grab a bite after hitting up the shops at Fashion Mall. Their orders of fries are huge and they can do half fries, half sweet potato fries if you ask. Nothing out of this world, but it hits the spot perfectly after a long night of partying.",UNK
11794,"Steak was a hockey puck.  Still somewhat tender actually but burnt burnt burnt and tasted exactly the same.  Food nothing spectacular, I could've cooked at better meal at home.  Asparagas tasted the best.  Expensive.  Skip it and spend your money on something better.",UNK
11795,Zumanity burger\nCajun salmon burger\nLong wait for food\nSoggy fries\nBurgers were good\nPickle is good,UNK
11796,"When you're going to Target, make a quick stop here, too.\n\nCheap and cute dresses, shoes, purses, eyelashes and bling for the clubs. Cute flats for around $20. Standard clubbing clothes for around $15-30.",UNK
11797,"Hotdogs were no better, in fact worse, than would come out of my microwave.  What a total and complete waste of my time going all the way out here.  Bought a groupon, as I love hotdogs.  Won't be making another trip here, that's for sure.",UNK
11798,"My neighborhood grocery store.  Good hours, gets the job done.  You absolutely have to have a Safeway discount card.  It's to the point where it's less a discount with the card and more a severe surcharge for people who aren't paying attention and don't get a card.",UNK
11799,Sushi was pretty good and the best green mussels I've ever had. Service was slow but $35 for all you can eat and drink??? Hell Ya!!!!,UNK
11800,"Hong Kong styled Chinese food. Great to have the option in Squirrel Hill, but not the best Hong Kong styled Chinese food I've had.",UNK
11801,Excellent service!\n\nThis is a big airport to get through coming and going and it sure helps when your rental car retrieval and drop off are quick. This location has the process nailed down and got me through super quick.,UNK
11802,"Don't expect a tall beer here. They will only serve 32oz beers in miller and blue moon. Why? No reason. I just wanted a big Fat Tire to end my day, but the bartenders insisted it was out of their hands. I hope this gets changed ASAP.",UNK
11803,We stopped here last week to try the sushi. Nice atmosphere and the staff was friendly. We ordered a special of the day roll that we cant remember the name of and also a rock-n-roll. The rolls were fresh and good. An average place for sushi. We rate it A-Ok...,UNK
11804,If ur into Asian desserts this is the place to go...  Its nice to taste some of the drinks and desserts I grew up with when I was a kid,UNK
11805,"This is a Denny's, so the food is pretty unremarkable. However, when I've had to forego Matt's Big Breakfast and Mel's Diner for whatever reason, I come here because the food is consistently decent and the staff is consistently friendly and attentive.",UNK
11806,"I don't know what the appeal is of paying $5 cover to have your eardrums pummeled as you stand with little breathing space on a sticky dance floor, but hey, new experiences like that are kind of fun.",UNK
11807,Tried to stop in for lunch on Thursday and they were closed. It looks like the restaurant has been abandoned.  So sad! We will miss them and those tasty firecracker eggrolls!,UNK
11808,"Wow, the airport is close to the strip but that is about it. When our flight was delayed, we could choose between burger king and a burrito joint that didn't even have seating.  Food service could use major improvement!",UNK
11809,Came in near closing time just for a butter cake dessert. Service was a bit concerned by our arrival but happy to know it was just for dessert.\n\nIt was fabulous as expected and we ate it all. The location in downtown is great.,UNK
11810,PF Changs has delicious food in a quiet beautiful place. The lettuce wraps are succulent and not too salty. The salmon and orange chicken were fantastic. Our waiters were knowledgeable and gave good suggestions to help us 4 girls order the right amounts. I'm so glad we came to PF Changs.,UNK
11811,Bad food. Bad service. All around bad restaurant. If you decide to eat here beware the all you can eat and drink is falsely advertised. You can only drink for one hour and they won't tell you that until you've only ordered one drink and you hour is up. Scamming people is no way to run a business.,UNK
11812,This location is closed.  The restaurant is being REMODELLED and eventually will become an Italian restaurant.  Will expect it to be on same level as Nicks,UNK
11813,"I've been charged twice with my account and they refused to give my money back, I had to make a claim against them. The place is not very bad, but the staff are rude, and as well as residence.",UNK
11814,"Cheap Chinese food specials for lunch here at Noodle Exchange. I had the Sweet and Sour Fish with fried rice that came with a spring roll. It was pretty good, but I would still recommend eating at Ping Pang Pong at the other side of the casino.",UNK
11815,I prefer to go at lunch since it is a buffet and I can have a little of everything (plus fresh fruit for dessert). I went once for dinner but it was more expensive and took a long time. Good Indian food and a great value for lunch.,UNK
11816,"Good course - especially for the price. BUT the staff is rude and abrasive - they act like the customers are an inconvenience to them. If you ignore them, it's a pretty good experience.",UNK
11817,"For west coasters, Carnegie is equivalent to Jerry's Deli in California. I had the potato pancakes and the pierogi, both were great but I was also very buzzed. I would return here.",UNK
11818,They do a good job and they will come back out to retreat if you see any bugs.  From time to time I have needed them to come back because of scorpions which they gladly do.  I have used them since I moved into my house in 2001 and their prices seems fair.,UNK
11819,"Worst I've ever had. Gyro meat was way over cooked and was similar to beef jerky. Fries over seasoned and the customer service sucks. Also, they don't have provolone. They only have white american cheese, which in my opinion ruins the cheesesteak! They won't be around long.",UNK
11820,I got the Gyro and my husband got the Ruben. It was ok nothing special. The bread on my gyro was really soggy. The only good thing were the chips. Not coming here again. The Ruben was supposed to be got and a lot of the meat was cold.,UNK
11821,"Port of Subs is really good, but you have got to be in a money spending mood. Port of Subs is like an upgraded Subway. The people are nicer, the service is better, but their subs are more expensive.",UNK
11822,"Food was mediocre. Service was mediocre. Nothing special about this place but they still got 4 stars? In California, when a restaurant got 3 stars and a half, it had to be really good. I'd give 3 stars for everything though.",UNK
11823,Typical sports bar.. Server was good and cute.. Food was greasy but done well.\nThey did mess up on the fried pickles but fixed it\n\nI would recommend this place as a sports bar,UNK
11824,"The very first time I went the buffalo location and I  thought it was just ok. I found out they had another restaurant on Durango and not only is it around the corner but the restaurant bigger, all of their staff is always pleasant but I thought the quality of food was better at this location!!",UNK
11825,I like the bar. Nothing fancy but I like the low-key vibe there. Staff is pretty friendly during happy hour. Gets a little too crazy at night. I prefer to sit at the bar and watch a game on their flat screens then leave before it gets packed. Food is 50/50 hit or miss.,UNK
11826,Didn't know you could screw up breakfast and yet they did. Eggs and bacon were greasy. Hash brown and seasoned potatoes were dry. Even the salad was lukewarm. Never again!,UNK
11827,"Gutes Restaurant zum tapas essen.definitiv das beste in der Innenstadt das ich ausprobiert habe.Service war gut, essen lecker und preis/Leistung stimmt.komme definitiv wieder.",UNK
11828,"This bar is fine as a meeting place before hitting the town or for a nightcap. This is not a main event by any means, but service was fine and the drinks weren't too weak.",UNK
11829,"This place is alright. It's large, and has a ton of large TVs which I think would be good for watching a football game. The beer selection is large, the food is average, and the service is good. I'd go back, but probably just for drinks to watch a game.",UNK
11830,"GHETTO\n\nThank you and Goodnight.  Avoid this place unless you like the chances you wont make it out alive.  \n\nEspecially if its a fight weekend.  Every wild animal and they mama will be up in there.  MGM, I dont like you.  Nope.",UNK
11831,I would give this place 3.5 stars because there was nothing wrong with this place but nothing outstanding either.  Average bar food.  Good sports bar atmosphere with lots of TVs.  A little more upscale from the average sports bar- in a good way.  Waitress was kind of rude.,UNK
11832,"First spot/bar that I saw to have a beer at the hotel we stayed in.  They did have on bar table with a beer tap actually on it, have to try that out next time.",UNK
11833,Everything was amazing. I mean everything (4 kids and 6 adults). Minus one star for not refilling water jug and a bug that was there for the whole hour right by it.,UNK
11834,Great location and very friendly baristas. Pretty standard selection; the cappuccino I ordered did not change my life but was tasty.,UNK
11835,"Food good, service not so good. For 4 people on duty and 7 patrons I would say waiting over 20 mintues to get our bill is ridiculous but try them for yourself.",UNK
11836,Pricey drinks.. great atmosphere and a place to unwind after being at a trade show. Cute little cocktail waitresses too!,UNK
11837,This Place SUCKS lets just put it at that they have a buffet going on and let me tell you that no service and honestly the food was. About a day old horrible food really sad I wasted my money here,UNK
11838,"Slowest McDonalds I ever been to, to be honest. No matter what time of the day, busy or not. Takes 15 minutes for 2 mcdoubles and the workers always seem to he doing something else at the weirdest time no matter when I come. The late morning is fast but any other time, expect to wait.",UNK
11839,Just bought a groupon showed up at the location to use - thru are no longer doing teppan at the tables. They have changed it to all you can eat Korean there.   Glad I was able to cancel my groupon :),UNK
11840,"it was 6pm, and i was drunk.\n\nour server kalvin was pretty cute. too bad he had \""susan\"" tatted on his wrist.",UNK
11841,"I wish I could give this half a star. It's just absolutely awful. We watched several people walk out after the first act and saw even more sleeping. Save your money for Beatles love. The men wear man thongs... If that's your thing, then go see it.",UNK
11842,Very disappointed after all the hype. Too sour: crispy rice. Very weird: garlic prawns. No vegetables in panang curry.,UNK
11843,"This is a handy Rite Aid, located next to Southpark mall. The parking lot has lots of spaces close to the entrance, and the store is large and pretty well maintained. I frequent this one a lot and end up getting lots of weird stuff, I never feel judged and the staff are friendly.",UNK
11844,I had been here once before a couple years ago. I should have stayed away. The gyro meal was terrible with no taste. I do not recommend. The bartender and waitress seemed nice though.,UNK
11845,I really wanted to give this place 2 stars.  The service is fine and the food is very good even though the portions are small.  Believe this or not the Margaritas are terrible?  I do really like the atmosphere and they have plenty of space inside and out.  I would give this place another try.,UNK
11846,"Horrible staff, night manager is very rude. Beds are hard, bathrooms are dirty and tub gets clogged all the time. Otherwise, location is great. Not staying here ever again.",UNK
11847,It's always yummy pizza and the have gluten free pizza as well. Nothing like a cold beer and a delicious pizza on a hot AZ day.,UNK
11848,I used to LOVE this place but it has quickly gone downhill as it gained popularity.  Long waits and the quality of foods is sub-McDonalds-quality.  Barf.,UNK
11849,Honestly one of the worst Mexican restaurants in the entire valley. All they do is pile more and more cheese on everything. Nice patio and beer  is cold but do not order food ever.,UNK
11850,wow the equipment is old...but on the up side its never as full as some of the other ones in the area. rather use  old equipment that wait for a dirty one.,UNK
11851,I took my son there to play and the play place was filthy....it was so loud I couldn't even hear myself think..my son is two and had to fight through all the big kids to even play with anything! Overall..just won't be going back!,UNK
11852,"Pretzels with the Fondue cheese sauce.... off da hook yo! This place is a killer restaurant tucked in between the coffee shop and Nobu, Don't pass it by! It is really really good. Fresh Seafood, Burgers, Curries...   It's a must have.",UNK
11853,"The service and ambience are good, but the food was pretty mediocre for the price. A solid option for a group BYOB dinner, but don't forget to bring your own booze as you can't buy it there.",UNK
11854,"I have been to a few yarn stores as I'm relatively new to the crochet world. But I was rather disappointed with this store. I had a funny smell, it was spare and not inspiring. I will not be returning and hope to find better stores in town to satisfy my yarn craving.",UNK
11855,Men. Men. Men. Good Vibe. Good Music. and Unisex restrooms- Cool! \n\nDrinks are not bad and the price is just right. Pool tables. Dart board. Shuffle board. TV's. Sports. Poker machines- Available!,UNK
11856,"Absurd prices, they fail to tell you that most of their \""conventional\"" produce and products are full of chemicals and GMO cancer causing ingredients but still charge you double what others do.  Check out www.drvita.com for products at 50% less cost.",UNK
11857,"Go to Home Depot, unless you don't need any help and know exactly where to find what you need. Never enough staff and they don't know anything.",UNK
11858,"gross nothing but flat chester boyish looking bartenders that these dudes were drooling over, it was too damn loud and for a Sunday too over the top all those chicks were beat and the vibe was very unwelcoming to women.  Women visiting Las Vegas a very unfriendly bar to women",UNK
11859,First time here. Enjoyed the atmosphere. Great omelet selection. Service was good. Definitely a notch better than Denny's or IHOP.,UNK
11860,"After much prodding from my Sister in Law, we went.  Awful.  The eggs on my plate were overdone, while my daughters plate was raw.  My husband's omelet was wrong and we didn't even get a sorry.  \n\nWe felt rushed to eat and leave.",UNK
11861,"Beer selection:  amazing.  Location:  across the street from my office, so, highly convenient.  Food:  not so amazing.  Well, except for the Sheboygan side-by-side with the hot German potato salad.  It's the closest thing to Wisconsin you can get in Charlotte.",UNK
11862,"Decent food, only thing memorable is how much of a douche Jo$h is from behind the counter. I didn't realize personalities could be that pretentious but after my second encounter I'm convinced otherwise. I'll be attending a different rubios going forward!",UNK
11863,"The food tasted good,not great, definitely edible...the portions are very small.  Way to expensive for what you get. Also, everything comes in throw away containers and they don't recycle!!!!  I will never go there again.",UNK
11864,"Small sparse store with a limited selection of books and products. Well intentioned, but sparse. Maybe their classes are good..I do not know!!",UNK
11865,"The macaroons here are good, but a little on the too-sweet side with an extra flaky cookie.  The chocolate banana was a nice twist and the pistachio had a smooth, creamy filling.  It is really a matter of personal taste preferences when it comes to here and Point G.",UNK
11866,"There are many better places to get Pho in Vegas than here. It's located in a run down building, a definite hole in the wall. The atmosphere isn't too great either. They messed up my order, which was as basic as can be. Would definitely not recommend.",UNK
11867,"Wanted to compared to another \""mushroom burger\"" I had had in the recent past and it didn't stand up to the quality. It was okay, but not the best burger I've ever had.",UNK
11868,This place has raised price and stopped sending sale flyers and coupons since the new owners took over.   Expired items are left on the shelf for sale.  You can do better.  Shame on Fresh and Easy.,UNK
11869,Sunday afternoon you would think they would have more than two people running the place.  I only went there to get to burgers and fries to go....\n  took a good 10 mins before my order was placed.   waited another 30 mins for my order to be finished.   will not be  eating this location again.,UNK
11870,"Its just Ok. Very slow service. Pizza was not bad but nothing spectacular. I do not know what else to say. I was hungry, i ate some of their pizza, it was not too bad, i became unhungry. End of story.",UNK
11871,"Not very impressive. Male bar staff unattentive to customers. Chicken tenders served for our non-profit fundraiser. We will be somewhere else next year.\n\nSee Amy H. review (8-11-13), I ditto her reaction.",UNK
11872,Worst zoo I've ever been too. Way over priced for a filthy facility. Will never waste my money here again. The only nice thing I can say is that all of the staff are very friendly,UNK
11873,"if there was an option to pick zero i would select it.  this place needs to be shut down.  horrible facility..dirty, food is horrible, no attention to detail, too many excuses and no one knows anything.  i would never recommend this place orthe staff.",UNK
11874,Closest off the strip reasonably priced JewFood in the Northwest side of the valley. Matzo ball soup and Pastrami spell comfort food. Like the other reviewer writes this place is hit or miss on the service depending on when you come in. Great place to sit and read the paper when you are not in a hurry.,UNK
11875,Definitely nowhere as good as Schwartz's. Service isn't any better and the smoked meat isn't in the same league as Schwartz's. I was a bit disappointed after reading so many positive reviews here. It wasn't bad but it wasn't Schwartz's.,UNK
11876,"Was craving KFC for a while, Love their Famous Bowl! However food is pricey for what you get it, they charge .39 if you pay with card and they don't take bills larger than a $20! They also take forever in Drive Thru!",UNK
11877,The ambience is nice but the food is only ok. My chicken dish was extremely salty and service was slow. Won't be in a rush to go back anytime soon.,UNK
11878,"Pretty dead location, inside, and outside. One girl at the register was okay, paying attention to customers, another girl filling the donut boxes looked like she's been whipped by sprinkles, and could care less.",UNK
11879,So glad Summerlin finally got a great restaurant!!! We love this place the food is great and the atmosphere is fun. Ricky and Anthony (manager) are awesome!! Their service was out of this world along with everyone else.,UNK
11880,"Terrible quality work and ruined my repair work prior to painting. Left lights loose, ruined my lock. Rip off don't go here.",UNK
11881,"Great beer selecton, and the white pizza is delicious!  Good hang out spot wit sports on the big screen and board games/darts if that's your thing.  \n\nThey also have a wide selection of exotic beer for sale.  This is a beer paradise!",UNK
11882,"Been going there for years.  Sadly, after the manager left, this place has gone down hill very rapidly.  It is too bad cause this drycleaner use to operate pretty smoothly.  I can't possibly recommend them to anyone if they can't keep good help around there. So long...",UNK
11883,"Good atmosphere to watch a game. Very organized on Sundays with seating. Staff is great about sitting you next to a TV with the team your rooting on. Solid specials and good food. Pizza is not bad, good burgers. Fav place to watch a game.",UNK
11884,"My cousin suggested dinner here and I'm glad he did. Good food, cute atmosphere, good service and I really enjoyed the live music that night. I'd go again to try some\nof their other dishes.",UNK
11885,I usually try to shy away from 7 days cause I think it's over priced butttt it was one if the only nail salons open today (new years).,UNK
11886,"I'm very satisfied with the food for the price. It's not crazy greasy, you get a very filling portion and it's inexpensive.\n\nIf you're looking for cheap Chinese, go to A8.",UNK
11887,"Went here back in April after taking a header at work.  Front desk staff were friendly, but never stayed shorter than 1.5 hours, even with scheduled appointments.  Felt like the Doctor didn't understand my pain and problem...  PT onsite was great, highly recommend that.",UNK
11888,"Went there for the AYCE and the food was really great. They even made something for my vegetarian girlfriend. Service was good too. Overall, had a great experience..",UNK
11889,"I got the French toast with scrambled eggs and bacon. Although the French Toast was sufficiently fluffy, it was nothing special. Reasonable priced. Ok service. I think there are probably better choices for breakfast.",UNK
11890,The friendly staff helped me get in get what I needed and get out.  I come here every so often and I'm just impressed by how quick my trips are.,UNK
11891,"Food was ok, not what I expected. Kinda disappointed. Had the buffalo chicken pizza. It was really dry. Could have used more sauce.",UNK
11892,"Great little tobacco store. I roll my own ciggs for about $1.15 a pack (yep, that cheap) and found very good prices on tobacco and cartons of cigarette tubes. My ciggs taste exactly like Winston's used to taste before they started adding all the chemicals. 15 minutes to make a pack in front of TV.",UNK
11893,Food was undercooked and not fresh. Got food poisoning from there. The restaurant was not well cleaned. Coffee is terrible. The food maybe be better cooked during the mornings; I went to IHOP at 11pm. I would not recommend this IHOP.,UNK
11894,Food is terrible. Obviously not consistent. But the service is terrible. Young girls serving who are rude. No please no thank you and they slam our stuff down. I wot e back. Goodness this food is terrible!,UNK
11895,"The pyramid building is cool. The rooms are okay - not big, not too small. I don't have anything to complain about, even though the alarm went off in the middle of the night. Nothing wowed me in the hotel, either. It's just A-OK.",UNK
11896,This is the only gas station I have every been to in my entire life to charge you to use your debit card and pump said they did not take credit. LAME. Poor beer selection. This convenient store is not very convenient.,UNK
11897,"Had shrimp vertuta, sauce was like soup. The chopped salad starter was wilted. What Italian uses feta cheese on pasta and salads anyway. Service was good, food was Horrible! Not even remotely authentic! Never again!",UNK
11898,"The parking and long wait, mentioned by many, is worth your time if you love Texas style BBQ. The resemblance to Franklin BBQ in Austin is uncanny in quality and concept. Only suckers show up at the longest line at 11:00am, come after the rush at 1:30pm to wait in a shorter line.",UNK
11899,"Decided to give this place another try more recently. Is have to say that it's definitely improved. Food is good. Not bad prices. Only issue it's still the sauces, off you want extra on the side, they charge. But if they put it on the food, they don't charge.",UNK
11900,"Eh. Not the best pizza of this type I have ever had ( Try Pizza Bruta, but that's a review for a different day). Atmosphere was nice, prices were decent, but the food really wasn't as good as it was cracked up to be. Worth a shot though.",UNK
11901,"Went here for a late breakfast.  It's nice that they serve breakfast 24x7.  I ordered a mixed scramble which was fine.  One friend ordered steak and eggs and he wasn't happy with the steak.  All and all ok, but expensive for breakfast.",UNK
11902,"I used to like this place, until they hired this rude female barista with short hair, so I stopped going.  If she has left, I will go back.\n\nThis place should do a better job of hiring polite and helpful baristas.",UNK
11903,"Went once because it was close to home, definitely not going back. The man who did my nails was rude and said I was no fun because I didn't want wine. Really? I just wanted to have some quiet time and relax!",UNK
11904,"Wow...Tao is like a P.F. Chang's with mediocre food, clueless bartenders and pounding music.  The business model is sad really, they created a gorgeous space, disregarded all other details and then watched the tourists flow in...",UNK
11905,They replaced the transmission on my company vehicle.  I drove it home and it bled out all over my driveway.  Had to get it back to them.  They forgot a seal...\n\nFind another Chevy dealer for service.,UNK
11906,Dinner food is high quality/fresh and the recipes are interesting.\n\nFresh pear butter and biscuits were a nice bonus.,UNK
11907,"There is a shuffle board table and pool table, but that is about all this place has going for it.  The bar staff is friendly, but this is a dive bar.",UNK
11908,Their products are good however the customer service is not. I've been in a handful of times over the years and each time the employees act like they have a stick up their asses.  I'll go spend my money somewhere else.,UNK
11909,The week end brunch is not worth $19.  The food was sitting out to long and looked dried up.  The only stuff worth eating was the made to order omelets and crab legs.,UNK
11910,I have seen almost all the Cirque shows. This is a sad excuse for one. It is a great show for 18 and 19 year olds but adults will be bored by its sophmoric humor. Its theatrical value is fair but when compared to the other Cirque shows in Vegas it is low.,UNK
11911,"What it love about BWW is that it's open 24 hours, with the kitchen also open all night. I really like their sauces, I suggest the \""wild\"" and the \""parmesan garlic\"". You can play video poker at their bar also. Good staff, good late night food",UNK
11912,"I went back for a second time to Brio since the first had been un-memorable in a large group. The decoration is nice and seems to have a cool bar.\n\nThe food is mediocre at best, overpriced for what it is, bad mixed drinks. Service is OK.",UNK
11913,Another bar serving nothing larger than two thirds of a pint on draught. Still not a fan of that option myself but there are a good number of taps & options.\nService-wise certainly no complaints. Reserving further judgement for when I get round to trying their food.,UNK
11914,"Food was outstanding and portions excellent for price. However, the service leaves a lot to be desired. After initial drinks/order we were mostly neglected. Took awhile to get the check/box.",UNK
11915,Another burger joint of the week place. OK so I get it. Good burger and I do not like soft fries anywhere so I will not comment on the fries. Interesting taste in the burgers. Very popular niche type place. Again it will satisfy the occasional craving.,UNK
11916,"Busy night on Thursday but solid service. Pho was mediocre with the broth arriving to our table lukewarm. Not ideal. Also had beef spring rolls, good not great. Overall I've had better Vietnamese in Vegas.",UNK
11917,"Great big Tostones, very nice hot sauce and mojo! Everyone at my table (two who had never had Cuban food) all cleaned their plates :)",UNK
11918,Customer service is not the best and neither are the bagels. I'm from NJ and the bagels are not as good as back home. I always find that the bagels don't taste very fresh. They're a little dry and somtimes taste a bit too salty.,UNK
11919,"Taste of Chicago is an interesting place to enjoy some Vienna Beef Red Hots.  I particularly liked their Italian Beef, but the best part is sitting around looking at the Bears stuff and watching the Cubs on TV.  Not a lot of south-sider stuff, though.\n\nJust look the Super Dawg statue.",UNK
11920,This the best buffet I've been to.  It's expensive but worth it.  Also it's a guaranteed good recommendation for friends.,UNK
11921,"Watch for a living social/groupon voucher available for this place. - 2 frozen drinks, 2 salads & 2 entrees.",UNK
11922,"Good food. All made fresh, everything \""homemade\""! Service friendly and prompt. Clean and comfortable. \nMostly meat based, but they have some vegetarian and can make other vegi combo requests not on menu. Just wish they could have fish added to menu.",UNK
11923,"The atmosphere is nice and modern, and you can smell all of the yummy Chinese food when you walk in. I especially love the Beef Chow Mein. The only thing I haven't liked is the Fried Rice, which just seems like white rice with veggies and meat thrown in. Great place for take-out!",UNK
11924,"A great dining experience in the heart of the Venetian waterway. The cuisine is a hybrid of American & Italian, but oh so good!",UNK
11925,"Enjoyed our first visit for the most part. Food was good, but service was mediocre at best. Started pretty strong and then really tanked. Had to find a different server to help settle our bill.",UNK
11926,Had some work done here in the past which tbh was quite expensive but they didn't do me wrong so I tried giving them more work. After calling and following up THREE times I just gave up. This company is nonresponsive.,UNK
11927,I like JCP's. The clothes are good and the employees are nice. Plus JCP is the only one that sells LEVI's for juniors so this is my go to place for Jeans. \n\nThere are also a great variety of other things. I come here a lot for Christmas.,UNK
11928,"Ice cream deserves 5 stars but the food was meh.  Nothing to write home about but our \""can't say no\"" sundae was divine.  I've been to the Serendipity in NYC before and remember really liking the food and desserts there so this Serendipity 3 needs to step it up.",UNK
11929,"I really don't have much to say about the Imperial Palace, the parking sucked, from valet to get to the Hash House was quite confusing, staff not that helpful to get you there. I think it was my 1st & last trip to the Imperial Palace.",UNK
11930,"Terribly disappointing! The hamburger from the one undaring person was the best thing in the menu. If you want want true, good authentic German food, look elsewhere.",UNK
11931,Don't ever get the trout taco special.  They are crap!!!  Cabo fish taco has really gone down hill lately.  The service is good the food is crap!!!,UNK
11932,Artsy\nDecent price\none of the worst haircuts of my life.\nYou will not see me there again.,UNK
11933,"The food was just OK.  Maybe that I am pretty much over Prime Rib, but this was just passable.  \n\nNice surroundings, and a great booth.",UNK
11934,"If you want to pay $10 for a small bowl of noodles , come here . I still cannot believe a family of 6 each having a bowl of noodles cost $98\n\nThe place got ok reviews and we thought we would give them a try \n\nNever again !",UNK
11935,"A beer while you wait us cool, but getting 3-4 strips of steak and 1 cheese crisp sized tortilla is very disappointing when ordering a fajita meal. Honestly could've got more at Taco Bell. I don't know why I didn't remember my last bad experience there. Ugh!",UNK
11936,"I wish this was in the squirrel hill/oakland area, since that area is mostly where we end up going if we have to eat out. But the food is great. I have always enjoyed sitting in the patio outside for an early summer dinner before catching a movie at the water front.",UNK
11937,"The ride was okay.  It's about 30 seconds.  Not worth full price, but luckily we had Groupons.  Get the Groupons!  We went in December on a Saturday afternoon very short line.  The view on the roof top is beautiful.  Great for pictures.  Wish it was longer.",UNK
11938,"Good Irish breakfast.  Even though this is chain, there are staff from Erin who are happy to serve you.  The Guinness is good and the craic is better when with friends.  Only complaint is that I think they deep fry the white and black pudding which is a no-no...",UNK
11939,"Maybe its the Mill bar strip proximity, or the ASU campus...but this place never has what I need and at some times and days it is messy that you just want to go back the way you came. \n\nRecently they added self payment machines, that could help, but still needs lots to improve.",UNK
11940,"Well, as an artist that was showing art there, they stole 3 of my paintings and refuse to get back to me no matter how i try to contact them.  i would say be very wary of doing ANY business with them.",UNK
11941,"Cupcakes and frosting shots, oh my!  This place is always busy and I think its the cupcakes.  My absolute favs are the Cinnamon and Red Velvet cupcakes!  I can't wait for the Pumpkin cupcakes that come out in the fall.",UNK
11942,Decent breakfast buffet. I liked the omelet station. Some stuff was fresh and others tasted like they had been out a while. But decent selection for $15. Ours was free with our hotel stay.,UNK
11943,"The different sets of parents at our table agreed that The Old Fashioned has the best cheese curds. Our 14-year-old son says that this is his favorite place for bacon cheeseburgers. The have their own root beer, enjoyed by all. Always packed.",UNK
11944,"We ate here last Saturday night.  We were really disappointed in our meals.  The service wasn't great, either.   I think the location is what is keeping this place in business.",UNK
11945,"Cheap, quick, but if you are looking for tasteful food it's not the right place. In fact, the 2 stars represent the value per dollars of the food. 4 stars for this place is insane. AZ people - you know better Mex food!",UNK
11946,Food is as good as anywhere else you might go for breakfast. We had breakfast so I can't rate anything else. \n\nPretty pricey for breakfast but maybe because a lot of business people go there. \n\nService is better than other places I have been too.,UNK
11947,Just had these guys food via take out at work. mild and bland. Beans were runny.little flavor from the enchiladas. Definitely recommend carrumbas or macayos over these guys.,UNK
11948,"The pizza stinks, and it's a pre-teen grindhouse on the weekends. If you want pre-pubescent STD's to go with your pizza look no further...",UNK
11949,"Not very happening. Our VIP hostess was nice, and Laura, the Hookah girl is off the hook. \n\nThis is the place where hoodrats go when they get old. I had fun dancing with that one girl... AND HER MOM.",UNK
11950,"Pricy.  Not my idea of a breakfast place, where are the eggs and hash browns?\nBetter located on the strip or a high end area.",UNK
11951,They don't allow for online ordering and did not pick up the phone when I called in the order. Either they are shut down or they are the worst Domino's Pizza I have ever encountered.,UNK
11952,"Lots of great Vegas souvenir crap at cheap prices!\n\nLooking for tee shirts, shot glasses, ashtrays and magnets? Look no further.\n\nMy fave item that they sell happens to be used deck of playing cards from actual hotels. I like stuff like that.",UNK
11953,The prosciutto pizza was good nor great. The beet salad was a little over dressed. The shrimp coconut skewers were fantastic. Service was excellent.,UNK
11954,I'm soooo glad to hear other people are surprised by the rave. PF Changs is AWFUL. Over-priced and truly disgusting. I have had one horrible experience after another. I will never return. So many other options that are less expensive and more appetizing.,UNK
11955,I asked for Chicken Chow Mein... this doesn't look like chicken or worth 7 dollars. It is dark meat at its finest. Never coming back.,UNK
11956,"Well drinks are decently priced. Some nights have drag shows after midnight. Crowd is mixed, which rocks. DJ sometimes is so drunk he plays whatever he feels like playing - even if it's 10 techno songs that no one likes/knows.  Great venue to watch bands!",UNK
11957,Maybe it's Edinburgh.\n\nWhere I live All Bar Ones are the certified watering holes for lawyers and accountants.  This one appears to be anything but.\n\nVery cool to see that it features local labels in its range of on-tap brews.,UNK
11958,"Decent corn dogs - they make them right in front of you too (which can take awhile). I had to pop down to the Orange Julius to get a Coke (they only have lemonade here). I abhor mall food in general, but this is passable for a quick cheap bite.",UNK
11959,"Slow, slow, slow. Over 15 minutes for an iced green tea. Weren't busy and I could see her making it the whole time. Was like she was trying to move through the Labrea Tar Pits to make the tea...",UNK
11960,"It was weird coming to this place. Some of the employees do not know their teas. when asking for advise they had to go ask each time i had a question... I spent 10 minutes waiting for an answer. I love the teas, but this time i left with nothing :(",UNK
11961,I overheard a male manager and female employee making very rude and racist remarks about chinese culture. This sort of behavior is ignorant and unacceptable in any situation. I found it to be extremely offensive and refuse to visit this location ever again.,UNK
11962,Wombo was our server tonite and he was great. When he heard we were locals he treated us to the broccoli dish and it was savory and delicious. Another item that was unique and flavorful was the crunchy rice w/ahi tuna. I will order this again and again.,UNK
11963,"Cool nightlife and great place to wander during the day.  Shopping, dining, club, casino life.  Fun area.  One end is the famous Las Vegas Strip, the other end is the new giant wheel-High Roller.",UNK
11964,"Been to this place only once.  Coming from Chicago the experience at this place was ok, but I've had much better.  Would not go again since I think there are better places out here.",UNK
11965,"Off strip casino, supposedly 'where the locals go' but the machines were tight so I think that's just an urban legend. Dirty and very very smoky. Sketchy clientele.",UNK
11966,Not your regular Genghis grill where you get to pick and choose your ingredients. They have a limited menu but still a good option compared to what you get in airports. The food is freshly made and served hot. Had the chicken teriyaki bowl which was well made. The portions were generous and I walked away happy.,UNK
11967,"Nothin to write home about,.. We stopped in from the long walk down Vegas Blvd.. Happy hours best deal",UNK
11968,hahahahah this place wont be open much  longer !!!!!!!!!!!!underage co-works alchohol,UNK
11969,This place is a total dump and no one is there to gamble because it sucks and everyone is rude. We only went there because they were advertising a sports bet that they didn't have. Don't ever go here. Ever. It's horrible.,UNK
11970,"Lots of stuff to look at. The staff is unfriendly and unwelcoming. They acted like they didn't want my business, so they won't get it. Plenty of antique stores with friendly staff in the Valley. Thanks anyway.",UNK
11971,"I ordered the BBQ mix plate for 7.95. Definitely not the best Hawaiian food I've ever had. Short ribs were tasty, chicken was bland, beef tasted like liver. \n\nThere are definitely better island eats in town!",UNK
11972,"Worst glass and after market products used here. DO NOT GO HERE! Better off buying new phone, or claiming insurance. RIP OFF",UNK
11973,The portion sizes are pretty big.  Definitely recommend the junior salad if you aren't a huge eater.  Service was great and the staff seemed very knowledgeable.  All the ingredients looked fresh and I love the variety of options.,UNK
11974,"Decent.  Room was clean and staff was mostly friendly.  The bar closes way to early!  Breakfast bar in the morning is nice.  With so many other choices around, I'm not sure if I'd stay here again though.",UNK
11975,Concerning Flautas (4.00) very small basically two rolled small  tacos. In my opinion not worth it. Try something else.,UNK
11976,Exorbitant prices.  Heavy flavor.  Lots of rice.  Little meat.  Long service and wait times.  Smelly dark interior.,UNK
11977,I only walked around inside this place but the music was jamming on a Friday night and Mr. Jessie (Manager) was so sweet to talk too! If you like looking at flat cakes in tiny shorts and plaid tops dancing on an elevated stage while you shoot craps then this is place for you.,UNK
11978,Wow!  I wasn't let in because I was wearing the wrong kind of shoes. They said my nikes were too nice. What crap.  Won't ever go to that place again. One star is too generous.,UNK
11979,"i had just had indian food the night before, that made me slightly ill, but deicded to eat here and was so glad i did! the food was reasonable and the service fairly good. the portions were just right-the chicken tikka masala is a must-have!",UNK
11980,"Food is great and so is the service.  I have been here on multiple occasions and have enjoyed it every time.  The waiters and management are very friendlly and make sure everything is great.  \nPlus, they have a putting green, which I sunk three hole in ones, kind of fun.  \nFree champagne on ladies night rocks.",UNK
11981,This place has the most delicious chips and salsa!!!!!! Yummy!!!! But because I was on hold for so long when I tried to cater and then transfered and not correctly and then lied to they only get 4 stars. I'll change in the future if the customer service gets better :),UNK
11982,"Nice little franchise.  Cute.  Friendly.  Food tastes nutricious.  Very inexpensive.  \n\nBut honestly, the food tastes uncooked... bring it home and microwave it.",UNK
11983,go to spot for cheap and quick meal outside of the strip. fyi a lil ghettoer than the one on the strip though in case you're uncomfortable with ghetto.,UNK
11984,"If you live close by, this is a great spot for some good old-fashioned karaoke (on Thursdays and Sundays) and really, really cheap drinks. We went for the first time last night and had a great time. Staff and patrons were all very friendly.",UNK
11985,"Gotta say, food is alright for Hawaiian local food, but old Asian lady gotta not run register...lmao! And seem like haoles only get served faster...",UNK
11986,"Stayed 2 nights in December 2013. Room, East tower, 65th floor overlooking the Strip. Great.!!!!! Room was well set up and appointed. Balcony was a nice touch.\nWould definetly stay again. Tried different resteraunts, all good.",UNK
11987,"I have never really had a problem with this place. Karaoke on Wednesdays and Saturdays and Happy Hour everyday. The place is spacious inside with a pool table, a dart board, and a machine golf game. 4 Stars because it's by the house :)  Done deal!",UNK
11988,Gone to Sushi time several times and have never left that not feeling satisfied. The atmosphere is nice and cozy. The sushi is pretty damn good given it's economic price. Go to this place during happy hour and you can get hot sake!,UNK
11989,"I just didnt have a great feeling after my meal here.  Nothing stood out as awful, but the food wasnt that great, our server was seriously slow, and I didnt feel the selection was that great for the price.  Once was enough for me.",UNK
11990,"Not your usual magic acts! Lots of amazing illusions that makes you wonder \""how do they do it\"", venue was a little smaller than expected and there was more dance performances than I would have expected for a magic show.....Jan takes the time to hang out with you after the show which is really nice and unexpected.",UNK
11991,"We went around lunch time on a Saturday, but I didn't think this buffet was all that great.  There was nothing wrong with the food, but there was also nothing spectacular.  I far prefer the Rio which has multiple international stations and a ton of desserts.  I'm not sure this buffet would be worth the long line",UNK
11992,"I was supposed to receive my dress in the mail a month ago.  I have not received in and I'm not getting a response from the store as to when it will arrive.  I have no idea what their products are like, but I definitely will never shop here again.",UNK
11993,"Waiter was very helpful, prompt good service. Burrata was just ok. I had the spicy shrimp that was something that I could have microwaved at home. Boyfriend had chicken pasta and he said it was ok. Redeeming: great house red wine for $5.",UNK
11994,"The Arthur's menu offers a wide variety of options, including burgers, sandwiches, wraps, soup, salad, & grinders...plus wine desserts & other treats.\nA great spot found in Southpark Mall, to avoid the food court and maybe select something a little healthier.",UNK
11995,"Clean place and the staff was very polite and helpful.  I wish other Albertsons were as nice as this one, especially with staff.  Beer selection was good but not great.  Parking is on a somewhat steep grade so choose wisely where you park your car relative to the cart corrals.",UNK
11996,the atmosphere and ambiance are priceless\nlike visiting a old speak easy \nso dark in there that they put flashlights attached to the menu\namazing brucchetta and chicken parm\nfun place,UNK
11997,Was there Saturday night for dinner.  Very mediocre.  Nice ambience.  Food was average and expensive.  Service was sub par.  More than likey will not be going back.,UNK
11998,"Friendly staff, and tasty sandwich I went on a Saturday and it was kinda empty which is nice since it is near a couple of business parks so I can imagine lunch being packed. Love the raspberry lemonade that Quiznos offers and the condiment station is always a plus.",UNK
11999,Service was not bad. Food was pretty bad. The fennel mint soup was really good. It was extremely busy so maybe that played into it.  Wouldn't return,UNK
12000,"First time ordered a large 2 topping thin crust pizza and wings. Pizza very bland, too much sauce. Mushrooms you could tell were  from a can or jar and placed under the cheese. Wings hardly had any flavor or sauce for being medium, ranch was watered down.",UNK
12001,"yes it smells but when I've been here I just imagine traveling to all the countries, ,depths and dark places to get all the things they have here.",UNK
12002,This is a cute country bar and the band was good. It did get a crowded later in the night. Bartenders were friendly and I didn't have to wait long for my drinks.,UNK
12003,If you get a good deal it's still just okay.  Aging in all areas.  If you can get it for under 500.00 for a three night stay then it's decent.,UNK
12004,"I was really hoping for a five star restaurant, but at the end the terrible service made me regret ever stepping foot in this establishment. Our server Harmony seemed like she hated her job and not very knowledgeable in regards of the menu. Additionally she was very rude and had a bad attitude. The food was delicious, but did not makeup for the experience.",UNK
12005,Tout ce  que j'ai command\u00e9 :un  hamburger frites \u00e9taient vraiment mauvais . Je n'ai pas aim\u00e9 ce caf\u00e9 java .,UNK
12006,"Worst front desk staff ever. I books my room in July for a conference in Oct, and only upon arrival was I told that they moved me to Fairfield Inn. HORRIBLE",UNK
12007,Worst service I've ever gotten. McDonald's has better manners than the girl serving us. It took a minute to get our food which she couldn't get right. And who fills my sprite with water? I'll never go back. This place went to garbage quick.,UNK
12008,"Food could have been better, but it was nice; all of the employees were super fun and dressed with the theme. I loved the Thai Tea w/ Boba, it was so good. Most places don't put enough milk so the taste is bitter, but they put a lot and I loved it :)",UNK
12009,"Prices comparable to swanky bars on the strip, not sure this works downtown. Didn't feel very mob-like and cigars were not permitted... The vibe didn't match the name so it fell way short of my expectations.  Maybe a new moniker would make more sense.",UNK
12010,Thank god this place closed! \n\nSomeone needs to tell the owner Mike his shit stinks.  His ego is so big it fills the entire salon.\n\nWould love to see more specials that you guys don't run throughout the whole year,UNK
12011,I take my mom here to pick up herbs and medicine for my grandpa. This place is like any other Chinese herbal medicine shop. There is one older gentleman that works here who needs to take a class on customer service...,UNK
12012,I called to schedule an appointment to meet with the practice to see if it would be a good fit with my family.  They told me they do not do that and I can only make an appointment for my kids.  Even if they don't need anything!  A pediatricians office should meet with parents!  The receptionist was extremely rude and not helpful!,UNK
12013,"Good prices, decent food, and huge portions.\n\nThe food definitely isn't bad and the prices are really good, but there aren't quite enough healthy options for me to give it a 4.  I like the place better than your average breakfast place, but not by much.",UNK
12014,"Pretty tasty burgers. But if you don't have a car and need to drive from the strip, I dunno if it's worth the cab ride.\n\nAll the burgers were pretty good. Had the spicy miso burger which was rich and good.",UNK
12015,"It was okay...The lady behind the counter was very nice but the \""Big Choco Chip Cookie\"" was boing.\nNot much in the way on ambiance,not someplace I'd find myself just relaxing for a bit,but was okay to stop in on my way to elsewhere.",UNK
12016,I meant to leave a review the last time I ate here this place is truly AWESOME!!! I had a great experience and the food I ate was tasty and there was a great variety. Best Buffett I have eaten at in a long time. Highly recommend!!!,UNK
12017,"The employees who answer the phones as a rule say whatever is necessary to get people in the door , multiple times I've called from the parking lot with view of the front door and was told everything from no wait to not more than a couple minutes. Always a great exaggeration.",UNK
12018,Great place for casual Mexican fare.  Very flavorful and colorful.  The Chile Relleno was very different and totally enjoyable.  Friendly atmosphere and quick service.\nI have been back a few times to try other items on the menu and I have never been disappointed.,UNK
12019,We were here for a private party and it was amazing. The service was wonderful. The appetizers were excellent. The staff was quick with the drinks. Great time! \n\nI'd be interested to go back when it is open to the public.,UNK
12020,"5 star view...\neverything else is average...\nbar is small, food is ok, drinks are blah",UNK
12021,"This has been our preferred hotel since they opened. A nice casino free haven away from but still close to the madness. Love the rooms, extremely dog friendly. However, I knocked off a star because the room service is questionable.",UNK
12022,"We were in the area and decided to stop at this Starbucks.  The staff was super friendly and competent.  It may the stop so pleasant.\n\nWireless, of course, allowed to me to download their new app without using my own data time.  Kudos to Starbucks for this freebie.",UNK
12023,Very good food and wine list!! Service was a little on the slow side but still very good!  The charred corn was a little too smoky / lamb was great / overall very very good!,UNK
12024,Went in on Sunday after 5 and waited a while. It wasn't busy but this tourist location needs TWO servers! Only one server doing 4 tables & the counter. What happened to quality customer service with a full staff. Hey Johnny! Do your homework! Backup staff & Location knowledge equals succsess!,UNK
12025,"Ok, I get it...you're busy. It's Saturday night. But do your guests a service and tell them it'll be a bit. Don't let 45 mins go by after they order and ignore them until they're walking out the door.",UNK
12026,Cool atmosphere and many occasions I run into a celebrity here but I don't come for that. The food is large portions and decent but pricey and service sometimes lack. Upscale casual with a side bar to get more privacy.,UNK
12027,"Head sized pizza slices! The pizza is pretty good, but you would really only come here for the giant slices. Per square inch, probably the best deal on the strip.",UNK
12028,The food was ok not as good as a particular veit. Pho. SERVICE was not that good she didn't exactly get my order right no check ins and did not understand me well,UNK
12029,ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE!!!!  Bad Hospital Cafeteria food is the best thing I and the other 5 people with me could say about it.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY,UNK
12030,Nice neighborhood place.  The only drawback is number of flavors.  I feel the yogurt texture is much creamier than other stores.  Easy to get to if you live in Mountains Edge.\n\nCute benches for chairs and great music.,UNK
12031,Have been here twice already for massage. The first time was real splendid. The second one I tried a different hot massage which I personally did not like it much though. The place is real cozy and the people are very welcoming. Should definitely try once. The best thing is it is in prime downtown. A bit over priced though.,UNK
12032,"It was alright. Sushi was acceptable, the price was one of the most reasonable meals I've had on the strip (lunch).",UNK
12033,"I enjoy visiting Mike. He does a great job on my nails. He is very efficient and super fast. This is a very relaxing, laid back shop.",UNK
12034,"Love this place, good prices, good service and the food is awesome! Now let us dance......with swords!",UNK
12035,This cafe is nothing like it used to be and not in a good way.  \n\nThey have s super tiny grave yard menu! And the selection is not what it should be for being on Fremont street,UNK
12036,Mullen's is your standard sports bar. Filled with people after Pirates' games but you can still find a seat. The service has been friendly and memorable for me - one of the bartenders comped a beer cause I was waiting long to pay. Plus for the ladies there is an attendant in the bathroom who provides simple fresheners!,UNK
12037,"Good food and very affordable.  We ordered the wanton soup with BBQ pork, hot beef dish, and roast duck,  we also ordered the guy land dish not knowing the guy land comes one the side of every dish.   The duck is kinda dry but this place is good and fast service.",UNK
12038,Slow service. The business is empty at this time with only two other clients waiting for their card but each sits unattended. The division of work slows down the progress.,UNK
12039,"Great selection of flicks, but management refuses to hire enough staff to man ticket window. Got here 15 minutes before start and couldn't buy tix in time. Line for tix machine ultra long too. No respect for customers.",UNK

12044,"Stopped in to the British Open again last night for a bit of food & a few beers.  Cheese & Onion Pasties & Toad in the Hole paired with Boddington's & Modus Hoperandi.  Great Pairings!  As usual a comfortable atmosphere, good service & always a good time!",UNK
12045,"Not bad, not great.  We had two dishes... Pad Thai, which was not that good.  Also Orange Beef, which was good but salty.  Next time I will try the Chinese place at the Wynn.",UNK
12046,"Food is great as always, however the past few times their service has been horrible. We ordered 6 items at once and each dish came out about 15-20 minutes apart. Between the four of us we were starving.",UNK
12047,"The staff at this location was very friendly but I was not impressed by the food. It was too salty and lacking in other flavors. It may have been the dish I had because I have heard good things from others. However, I'm not tempted to try it again.",UNK
12048,Waited an hour to get our food when the place was empty. We were a party of 8 for a work lunch. The drinking water tastes like it is out of the fish tank,UNK
12049,"Food was good, service could've been better, it wasn't crowded at all. I still prefer Olive Garden, but this place was close and we had a resturant.com certificate. Fettuccine was good Cannoli not so, maybe I'll try again not sure cause pricing was not great.",UNK
12050,Went for a second time barber messed up my hair from the back it was uneven now it has to grow back so it can look normal again. Plus I was cut badly on the line up and side part on my head. Will never go back. Fix your clippers !!!,UNK

12053,"Went there yesterday at 130pm and I was the only person there. They did not have a menu, only offer a limited buffet, and didn't have ice for drinks. They had a huge menu board but nothing was featured on it.   Seemed like maybe this may have been a great place at one time but that time has passed.",UNK
12054,went to see Grownups. Nice little theatre. Lots of choices for snacks. the cinema was small which was ok. Nice and clean. I would see a movie here again but never stay at the hotel again so i probably wont ever be back to see a movie,UNK
12055,"Very average Italian food.  If you're looking for a pasta+sauce experience, it's pretty boring.  Eggplant parm was a little better than average.  But all in all, not any more exciting than what I can make for myself with a jar of sauce and box of pasta.",UNK
12056,"Awesome dinner in a strip club...not really in the club but in the building.  service was outstanding and everyone of us loved the carne asada and carnitas.  I'd go back just for quest fundido with mushrooms alone,  really enjoyed the experience.",UNK
12057,Just a good ol' American breakfast with hearty portions and good presentation - not to mention delicious!  Love the hash browns with grilled onions ... oh so GOOD!!,UNK

12066,"Lot's of Tony's around, this one is good food, but after many tries, I prefer other locations. Sad because this is very close to me. Seems there may have been a management change recently and this location has slipped a bit more.",UNK

12068,"Went here for a nice dinner before a show at the Mirage. Wished we had gone somewhere else. Our waitress hovered near our table the entire dinner, very awkward. We had the potstickers which were good, the chicken chow mein and the kung pow chicken were tasteless with zero flavor. Save your money!",UNK
12069,Outstanding filet mignon.  Absolutely delicious Dover soul. The only thing we did not enjoy was the crab cake which was overfried and reminded me of a Mrs Paul's fishstick.,UNK
12070,"this place IS NOT GOOD for crepes.. too doughy and thick. The sweeter ones were better. But they should just make pancakes, not crepes... It is expensive also.. we got 2 crepes for 32.91 with tax, were still hungry, and wanted to vomit after eating them.",UNK
12071,"While I like the cheap flicks I am increasingly disturbed by dude's hair.  Mr. Pollack is displayed here and there around the theater as well as on the screen adverts before the show starts.  My kids have nicknamed him \""Creepy Hair Guy.\""\n\nPhoto incl.",UNK

12073,"With a slew of franchise pizza places in the neighborhood,  this is a really good pizza spot. Pizza is always good after ordering here several times. They never disappoint",UNK
12074,Very nice and grassy park- I wish the seating would get washed down more often or some bleacher type seating was installed- but over all very nice- people usually pick up after their dogs here.,UNK
12075,"I like the new Panera Bread bakery at Boca Park . Service is good, bread consistent with freshness and taste , very clean , reasonable price, excellent ambiance and location! You should try all the bagels ,bread and pastries. Sooo good!!!",UNK
12076,"This was my first time at a Studio Movie Grill.  The movie experience inside the theater was fine.  However, the restroom facilities were awful.  I visited 2 different ladies' room and they were both unkept.  They should consider getting complete automatic restrooms.",UNK
12077,"Consistently the worst customer service that I come across of any whole foods, if it wasn't for such a good product I would never spend such an amazing amount of money per month with such consistently bad customer service, bad attitudes from employees and a place that takes 30 minutes to get a green smoothie.",UNK
12078,I was so excited to go here after reading the reviews.  I got there yesterday and there was a sign up front saying it was closed until further notice and their phone was disconnected.  Does anyone know if they are planning to open up again?,UNK

12080,"The staff at Lonnie's is horrible, not just once, but every time. They are rude, slow, and rush you out at closing. The reason I go back is there selection of cane glass beads are the best I've found anywhere and that's all I buy there.",UNK
12081,"The Hash house on Sahara severed me cold eggs and meat loaf.  The waiter did not deliver the food and was not available to send the food back imediately.  When he did arrive I told him the eggs were cold and meatloaf, which he offered to take back and warm up.",UNK
12082,"Pleasantly surprised. Was expecting to be overcharged for mediocre food--but it turned out to be a very good meal. The Shaking Beef was great, perfectly seasoned and generous portions.",UNK
12083,Was hoping for a decent Mexican restaurant in South Chandler but instead got a Mexican Denny's. Lots of sloppy food with no taste and a bit overpriced. Do have a nice patio and drinks were OK if that's all your looking for.  Too bad doubt it will last very long. Take your money elsewhere.,UNK
12084,Worst service ever. Started off with apps quickly and then the food didn't arrive for over an hour with no apologies and the hot dishes were cold. We watched them sit under the hot lamps for 20 minutes and asked what the status was Don't bother with this place.,UNK
12085,"Quick and easy... Thank god!!!  I do make a point, however, to never come on a weekend if I can help it.  My favorite location is Tempe Marketplace because it is MUCH bigger, but for convenience sake, I'll stop by here when I need something.",UNK
12086,Some stuff is cheaper. Other stuff is more expensive. I do like the deals at the deli. They have really good turkey and roast beef. They also give a 10% discount on cardinals home game day if you are wearing a jersey. Love that they support the local team. Go cardinals!,UNK
12087,"Hard to find as you have to go down a side street that is gravel and looks like you might be able to buy some crack and a bj. Shady. Pulled right in, told the Dude what I wanted, paid, he loaded 3 bales of hay, and was on my way!",UNK

12089,"Holy cow.  It cost me like $25 to get a couple of sweaters dry cleaned here last year.   Granted, they did a good job, and they packed them in some really nice covers, but ouch.  Check pricing before you drop off your stuff here.",UNK
12090,Overhyped....by a ton. Ordered to go because there was no seating available. Got the Italian crepe with pepperoni. Just a soggy mess. Never had crepes before so if a soggy bland roll with soggy pepperoni is top notch crepes this is the place.,UNK
12091,"This place seems great and cool on paper, but then you try the food and its just a big disappointment. Its fairly bland and lacks flavor. The service was slow and they even messed up our order. Its a shame because I had read the story about the manager and I wanted desperately to support the business and see him be successful. Such a shame.",UNK
12092,"Really nice rooms, we had adjoining rooms so it seemed super large. Super clean and great view. \nIts conveniently located on the strip and they have a nice office area. Things that they could improve on: ipod docks for music, have a microwave. There is not one microwave in the wholeeeeee building!",UNK

12094,Drove 30 miles to purchase a membership for my mother-in-law. Was supposed to be a Christmas gift but was told we couldn't buy one for someone else. Really? I guess Sams Club has all our future business.,UNK
12095,Just an update.  Went again last night with my daughter and GF.  Still very good and nothing for me to complain about.  All my previous comments are still applicable.,UNK
12096,"I had high hopes for this place because I love a good taco. I was disappointed and probably won't be back for three reasons: the food is way overpriced, the portions are too small and the food was just ok. I'll stick to Los Taquitos down the street.",UNK
12097,This is like a Slurpee stand for adults! I had the Hurricane Punch which was good and it wasn't too strong. It came in a Pilsner  cup which was about $12.00. A little pricey even though you can take home the plastic cup.,UNK
12098,Nice staff and great clothes but HORRIBLE return policy.  No returns after 14 days.  No exceptions.  I won't be buying there again.,UNK
12099,3 hours at the tables and I got 1 drink. . 1 Damn drink over 3 hours. Hostess had bad attitude too. You bring me drinky I tip well. 1 weak ass drink does not deserve my 3 hours of play. Mgm properties way better. I normally stay at Ceasars properties. I think I am done with them.,UNK
12100,"Delicious!! Not a vegetarian, but this place might convince me to switch over. Had a few breakfast options and was blown away by the Greek plate and the QTF. Excellent coffee too.",UNK
12101,"Awesome, unique place!  Pastries were delicious, had the strawberry-cream cheese croissant and a variety of fudges! All great!",UNK
12102,"Grumpy staff, mediocre casino, and there is some fucking construction going on. It starts at 7:00 am like it is necessary and it does not stop until everyone in the hotel is awake early. I will not come back ever again.",UNK
12103,"Got sick from the feta cheese I bought here, which was spoiled. Asked to return it but was told there are no returns on perishable items. I have always liked shopping at Winco, and they often have better prices than competing stores for many food items. Never had a problem with their foods before.",UNK
12104,"The hookah is good but other than that nothing, the rest room is not clean (men and women) the waiter is nice but never smiles. \nIf you just care about the hookah its good but for total package there is better.",UNK
12105,Not very fresh. Rice was hard. Beans crusted over. Taste was ok. Maybe it was a bad nite but the service was also uninspired. With many other burrito options no reason to come here.,UNK
12106,I think it's so cool how they have a lions' habitat inside. I saw a lion's derri\u00e8re for the first time! I stood under the glass ceiling where the lion was taking a little siesta. So cool! Check it out!,UNK
12107,"Spicy tuna role is good, staff friendly and nice, but their noisy neighbor Korean karaoke is too much to endure.   On the other hand, for people who sing in the Karaoke, they can get decent sushi conveniently, so, good for them,  :D",UNK
12108,"We went on a Tuesday night and my friend and I shared the entire restaurant with two other people. Huge wine rack on one wall, candles on the tables and pillows on the booth seats. Portions were large and food was hot off the stove. I can see how the limited seating can fill up quickly though.",UNK
12109,"food was decent, beer was cold but the servers looked like they just rolled out of bed.  They didn't comb their hair and if the front of the house doesn't look presentable can only imagine what is going on in back of the house where my good is being cooked.  I will not be coming back.",UNK
12110,Worst pizza I have ever had.  I could have done better with something from a gas station .  They do not get orders right.  The chocolate cake is gross!\nGo get a food from 7-11. You will do better.\nRip off pricing for what you get.,UNK
12111,"Do not go here.   Misdirection, Misdiagnosis, Miscommunication.  Result: Our sweet dog died the next day.",UNK
12112,Driver got mad at me asking for money when I had paid using Paypal and tipped him using Paypal as well.  I explained him but without trusting called his store.  Lack of communication between management and drivers.  Food was terrible.  Won't order anymore from this place.,UNK
12113,"I special ordered a 2014 calendar from this store and they never called me to tell me it was not available or anything. Once again, horrible customer service!",UNK
12114,"Poor service and food is overpriced. The food should taste a lot better for what you pay. Also, it's really hard to get a table.",UNK
12115,"What a bad deal, stale fries under cooked onion rings and an absence of service.  There's even a charge for to go orders. Save your $20 go elsewhere.",UNK
12116,"Not the worst, but by far not the best either. Service was very slow, food was bland, and experience was lacking. Will not return.",UNK
12117,"just OK. the pho dac biet lacked tripe, etc. decent broth. other diners said other dishes were a tad spicy. still, it totally hit the spot, and i would probably go again, after trying many of the other pho spots within blocks. solid pho, but nothing gastonomical.",UNK
12118,Small. Staff not friendly. Lunch special did not offer a variety. Uncharged $1 for rice. Will not be returning. Food was tasteless.,UNK

12120,"I know what to expect when I'm in mood for fried chicken, so I don't give ratings based on the food quality. However, the service was really too slow, and the chicken were so dry that they were almost powder. Ok not powder but dry and tasteless. Horrible.",UNK
12121,"Small place, few breakfast choices but good and delicious I had breakfast sandwich simple but made right way no grress at all, satisfying Angela had oatmeal with fruits that she also enjoind, it not fancy at all place, but I really enjoyed patio",UNK
12122,We will not be returning... EVER! Certain staff members are really creepy (you feel as though you need to keep an eye on your purse). And why does this place smell so bad? It's hard to enjoy a meal when you feel like gagging from the over-whelming smell of a backed-up toilet.,UNK
12123,THE WORST SERVICE EVER!!! NOT like other C.A.S your better off @ the one's Downtown where at least there they know how treat their customers.,UNK
12124,i have been there three times and never again. first two times the wait for spicy strips was more than five minutes. last  i got a food borne illness from the strips. i know it was the strips because i only eat once a day and that was it.,UNK
12125,"A great little corner shop that's not on the corner. Simple little review here, fresh fruit and veg which are twice the size of Tesco's produce, about every Kelloggs product under the sun and a few bottles of alcohol to wash them down. \n\nA good cheap alternative!",UNK
12126,Is it just me or did the bus service get WORSE after the drivers went on strike?  It's rare that I ever wait at a stop and have the bus arrive on time.  At a minimum it will be 5 minutes late.,UNK
12127,This is a great place!  We got protein bowls with steak. So good!  The portions are large. We sat outside & people watched while we ate !,UNK
12128,Great service. The food was very heavy. We felt like we just gained 20pounds. Not fantastic. We r full in a bad way. Unsatisfied. The food looked appetizing. Menu looked appealing but food did not taste good.,UNK
12129,"It bothers me that employees, deli staff, sushi staff sit outside the front doors smoking. I've caught the sushi staff returning from a smoke break and didn't bother to wash their hands. I wont be buying sushi here again.",UNK
12130,If your kid is under school age it is a good museum. It's a little boring for those over 6. For the size of Madison having a childrens museum at all is an accomplishment.,UNK
12131,This is small sports bar/restaurant hole in the wall place and it's very relaxed. The seafood is very good. The only really bad thing about this place is the prices. That's the only reason I don't come here more often.,UNK
12132,"I love this place. The cupcakes are the best I ever had from a bakery. I like the cotton candy, and  the retro cupcakes. Homemade butter cream and everything is always fresh! It's a must for anyone in the area",UNK
12133,Not sure I would call it heavenly. I assume it all depends on who you get and I am sure there are many other people that would give a better massage then the one I got.,UNK
12134,"If you are looking for Ono grinds that remind you of home cooking on the islands, this is the place. Boiled peanuts are a nice surprise. Good service. Cabbage, turnip and cucumber kimchees are delicious.",UNK

12141,"Customer service is worst. The night buffet is worst. The food doesn't look fresh. Recommend not to go there, specially in the night.",UNK
12142,Not you average experience.   Come and plan to wait long times at the table.    Enjoy the views and wait long times to place drink orders.   Enjoy seeing wait staff walk around without taking your order.   Plan to spend an hour just to place and order once seated.,UNK

12145,"This place is on par with airport restaurants. They know you can't really go anywhere else so there is no hurry to serve you and the food doesn't have to be affordable because you only eat there when you really have to. Consequently, I only eat here when I really have to.",UNK
12146,"Average airport. The layout of the place is pretty odd. Its spread out pretty far and wide (lots of walking). On-site rentals would be nice, but not here. Taking a shuttle to the 3 different terminals is a bit of pain as well, especially when your airline is different then what is printed on your ticket.",UNK
12147,"Growing up just outside of LA, I know good mexican food. This joint is solid, from the salsa, dollar tacos, to the killer burritos. You just gotta ask for cheese and avocado in yours!",UNK

12154,"Have been here a few times now, both for dinner and for breakfast.  Huge servings, reasonable price around $10/person per entree, except for over night shifts. Overnight breakfast is around $2.\n\nWill certainly recommend.  Like steak, try the $10 steak dinner!",UNK
12155,I dont normally like pancakes.... but I love Babystacks. Bless them for adding a Henderson location! They have a very diverse menu. Just know their bacon is turkey bacon. They even have cookie butter french toast! Treat yo self  by coming here for breakfast!,UNK
12156,"Ok food, found a hair on my honey dew melon slice, disgusting. \n$4.50 for a glass of cranberry juice. Nothing spectacular. Rather try something else.",UNK

12161,"Been here twice but still don't know why people were raving about this place. Burgers here taste like any other burgers. Maybe there's a special sauce there that I don't know about? Overall, can't differentiate this burger from Burger King. Waste of money.",UNK
12162,Love this place! It is awesome food. I have ordered here a few times and each time I have tried something different and loved it. Glad I found this place,UNK
12163,Nice place to eat. Good Food and service.  My only concern is the inside looks very old. It should be remodeled with better tables and chairs.,UNK

12166,Been here a month ago and decided to try a few things. Ramen was ok at best. Gyoza was forgettable. And there teriyaki steak was some of the worst I had in a long time.  Overall cool concept but they really need to revamp their food to survive.,UNK

12181,"not gonna say they're all horrible but some of the people here at the counter are completely rude, full of attitude and down right IGNORANT. they need people skills training. But then again it is not just my personal experience that LA FITNESS does not care for their image nor for their current members.",UNK
12182,Looks like this place recently had renovation work done and it looks awesome. Cheap gambling and food as well. Crazy how in January they have the pool open. The big slide looks really fun to go down since you slide through the fish tank-- looking forward to visiting here in the summer.,UNK
12183,======  CLOSED  ======\n\nThis not-very-good place finally folded & has been replaced by a 5 Star Smashburger!!     :-)),UNK
12184,This is a cozy place for locals and hotel guest to hang out with no pressure. The best part if having Holly singing on Friday and Saturday.  It livens up the place. Too bad unless you know about it there is no sign on a marque for people traveling in the area.  That would be my only suggestion.,UNK
12185,"Had dinner here before and thought the food was pretty good!  Can't remember exactly what I ate, but was definitely surprised by the food quality at a club!  Aside from that, pretty cool club to party at in Vegas, but not as cool as XS!",UNK
12186,This night was a blast! My only wish was if they would of had more brewery's and focused more on the hard working contributions from the brewers from SNAFU!!!!! More Food trucks would had been nice also.,UNK
12187,"For the last three times we have it has taken forever!  We are talking 45+ per time to get our food.  One time we were there over an hour, luckily our kids were well behaved.  The food is decent, every time we go it seems as if the back of the house does not have their act together.",UNK
12188,Service is very fast and friendly. Price is on the average slightly high side but at least here you get what you pay for. Very yummy food.,UNK
12189,"Food is ok.  Wanna hear a brassy NY accent from the owner who \""open carries\"" a pistol as she makes sandwichs. No thanks. There are other places downtown.",UNK
12190,"nothing beats the terri beef, except of course manapuas and musubis to go along with it, good food and friendly service equals great times",UNK
12191,I really like their roasted root veggie hash.  I get it with eggs over easy and a side of bacon (for a bit more protein).  Yummy!  Carl's Cakes is based in the same place so you can always walk out with goodies after your meal.,UNK
12192,"Good food, friendly staff.  The quantity you get is a good value.  As for taste, its not really blowing me away.  Just ok, but good for a quick dinner.",UNK
12193,"I love port of subs, go literally multiple times a week but this location is a joke. \n\nEnough said.",UNK
12194,This place is only good if you have that seafood craving. Other than that is just not worth the money and sometimes the wait. The food is decent but it's just not living up to the hype. It's just sad how a huge chain could turn into a Seafood Applebee's,UNK
12195,Very good mexican food... delicious drinks... too pricey for mexican food but I guess you are in VEGAS... highly recommend... Crab tostadas +A... Bartender was friendly so the server... Enjoy and TEQUILA!!!,UNK
12196,Tried it based on the reviews before me and I was not disappointed.  The food was simply delicious.\n\nI would go back without have any reservations.  \n\nThe place was BYOB as far as I could tell and the clientele was thoroughly enjoying the food.,UNK
12197,"Worst service and attitude I've ever experience. If you don't want to work  in the service industry it's very easy and simple \""just quit!!\"" If you are still working at a burger joint thats means you have no where to go and means this is where you belong.",UNK
12198,"I waited FOR 35 MINUTES tonight just for 2 brisket meals to go. They weren't even hot when I arrived home and I live less than 1 minute away. It was still a fine meal, saved by the amazing cornbread!! But, I have no intention of going back any time soon.",UNK
12199,"come on.... if you want Chinese, dont go to a chain owned by Americans.  THis is a waste of time and money.",UNK
12200,"Had the godfather. Crisp bread but salami is inexpensive type. Hubby had firemen. Bread and bacon crisp, hamburger patty premade/prebought. Would have been better with fresh patty. Curly fries are good. Great and fast service.",UNK
12201,"Drinks expensive. Music not for anyone over 18 (maybe 16). Compared to similar clubs in NY or LA, well below par. Will NOT return.",UNK
12202,"Yes, it is reasonably priced.  Yes, my food was tasty (6 on a scale of 1-10).  However, the place did not look clean to me--I won't be back because of that.",UNK
12203,"Had dinner last night there and as always it was fantastic!   The employees were courteous and friendly, especially Rosie who was our waitress.   We love going there and the food is always the best.",UNK
12204,Really good food!  I was pleasantly surprised!  Do I have a rival to my coveted Thai Spices????  One more visit to decide!,UNK
12205,I'll never fly Spirit again! No matter the price. I'm surprised they don't charge to use the bathroom! Nickle and dime on everything. There is a dent my knee from the seat in front of me.,UNK
12206,"Great food, service, and location. Can get pretty busy and noisy at times but I like the environment. They have a huge menu with tons of options. Overall a good experience.",UNK
12207,"Another strip mall joint, this place has pretty good pizza, but their entree items are better. Have had some good lasagna there, and eggplant Parmesan. I just don't like the atmosphere... I feel like I'm dining in a storefront ... Oops, I am!",UNK
12208,"Along with Chick-Fil-A, Chipotle has been the greatest asset to the Food Court at SouthPark. They deliver consistently fresh items with generous portions (what else could you expect from a Chipotle?!). My only complaint would be the limited amount of seating at this location.",UNK
12209,"Great coffee, inside location isn't the best for hanging out and spending time catching up though.  The outside is fairly nice and offers more space.",UNK
12210,This place was terrible.   I'm 99% sure they just take Campbells vegetable soup and add a little crab.   Crab cakes were expensive and only slightly above average.   The hush puppies were pretty legit though.,UNK
12211,"The hibachi is disappointing even for a cheap hibachi place. Way too salty and not enough veggies, even when I requested extra veggies for no rice. The sushi is better than the other food, but not worth going back for.",UNK
12212,Food is terrible.   Chicken was definitely frozen and just microwaved.   Lo mein is a 4 out of 10.   Will never order from here again.,UNK
12213,"This place is as good as it gets away from Spring Mountain Road in Las Vegas.  I would definitely return because 1) it is close to my house and I don't have to drive 20 miles to the city 2) it is clean and 3) the staff are friendly.  \n\nAs far as pho goes, it is ok.",UNK
12214,"OK, sometimes it's not all about the money. Sometimes you really want a clean, curated selection and you find that at Revolve Charlotte. It's an upscale men's consignment shop, but how many of us refashion menswear for a sexy and unique look? I know I do!",UNK
12215,"This place is so overrated. The service is awful -- they were so rude to my girlfriend that she was crying by the time my flight landed. The decor, food, etc. are nothing special either. Our room was large. That's the only good thing I can saw about the place. I'd never stay here again.",UNK
12216,"Great choices - crepes, eggs and much more. Large portions - easily split between two people. Nice seating outdoors. Speedy service.",UNK
12217,Cajun wings were a little dry with some sort of seasoning that tasted like Lucas candy. Next time just sticking to regular hot. Fries were good.,UNK
12218,I decided to reduce my original review by one star. America's Taco Shop is pretty pricey. I realized that today when my quesadilla and Mexican coke came to over eight dollars...,UNK
12219,"Nice pool, there were lots of older kids playing basket ball and driving off the diving board. Pool chairs were great but at 3;00 on a week day this pool turned ghetto! The teenage kids were using bad language and it seemed like the place for the hood rats to hang out.",UNK
12220,Food was good the peanut butter shake was delish.  Service was OK.  The management was horrible.  Very smug and not at all apologetic for mistakes that were made with our order.  I might come back for the food but some definite changes need to be made if the restaurant is going to stay open.,UNK
12221,"The positives:  Really good food, great setting not too far from downtown.  \n\nThe negatives:  Parking is nonexistent.  Even if you allow for the downtown location, it was almost impossible to find a space.  I had to park in a nearby neighborhood that was a five-minute walk away.",UNK
12222,"The good-Clean store, well stocked\nThe bad-Horrible service, NEVER enough cashiers and the self check outs rarely work well.  Always tired at the end of the day.  The last thing I want to do is stand for 15 minutes waiting to buy a quick dinner.",UNK
12223,when it comes down to the graveyard hours...\n\nbut the prices are not.\n\nthe food is pretty much compareble to that of DENNY'S or Norms\n\nwith $7 dollar charge for bacon,UNK
12224,The bagels were pretty good. The yogurt parfait is probably the best I've ever had. Definitely worth driving if you're staying at the strip and don't want marginal overpriced food.,UNK
12225,"I moved away for a year, and looked forward to eating here, but was disappointed, I'm wondering if the have changed ownership or are cutting corners??",UNK
12226,"Their baked goods are good. Especially the Ensaymada but as for the Food its so so, Nanay Gloria seems to be a better choice with  regards to home cooked Filipino Food.",UNK
12227,The dirty rice was good but you dont get very much when you get carryout. The meat was good however the sauce was strange...like it had cayenne pepper in it or too much of  it.,UNK
12228,The sushi here is pretty good I came the other night with my husband and they had great sushi but the service wasn't great and the wait was long. It's okay!,UNK
12229,"Went to adults night out at the SciCenter. I didn't think it was worth it, even though it was free. Granted, we didn't get to see everything in the museum but could quickly tell it wasn't up to par what other cities offer.",UNK
12230,Inside a gas station all good. Just wish they had there own building. Overall not bad. could be better. I pass up this gas station many times with my lady and the  outrages menu. But small but ok. I had better.,UNK
12231,Garlic fries are a must and a place that serves arrogant bastard on tap has to be pretty good.  Wife and I ordered the cowboy and mushroom burger.  Holy cow!  Awesome and good riddance of the old place yeah it was cheaper but you skimped on taste and quality,UNK
12232,Awesome food.  Went for lunch.  Owner and his family were very nice.  I thought that pricing was a little high...but it did match the high quality of the food.  Had some great Udon and Loco Moco.  Would recommend either.,UNK
12233,"Went to the store in terminal A, service was not very good. Manager was talking loudly on cell phone while not doing anything. They wouldn't fill my travel mug and had to waste an additional paper cup to keep my hand from getting hot while pouring the coffee into my cup. Not impressed, not what I expect from Starbucks.",UNK
12234,Best steak tacos we ever had..tasty and big portion. The chicken tacos is kind of dry. We love to come here. Prices are very good..highly recommended,UNK
12235,"Overpriced, and underwhelming, seriously, I paid $15 for moderately tasteful food and a lunch sized portion (even though it was dinner).  Will not be returning.",UNK
12236,the house spaghetti was so so bad. i would have paid $6 for it. it was plain and i can't believe that is their house specialty.\n\nthe foie gras ravioli was good. \n\nservice was not so great.,UNK
12237,Burgers are very low quality. Service is cordial and bland. Tots taste like food you'd eat after a night of drinking. Wouldn't dine again.,UNK
12238,"Don't go out of your way to eat here. It's fine for a small snack while you're shopping, but if you want a good hot dog, the Pinks over at Planet Hollywood beats the dog piss out of Nathans.",UNK
12239,"Meat was really dry...\nReally greasy with no spice...\nWas disappointed!\n\n...On a side note, I'm wondering if they seasoned either the pork or the beans with  cinnamon...",UNK
12240,"Wife and I went on one of their cruises for my birthday! It was an hour in a half cruise. We had the opportunity to see two bald eagles, and quite a few big horn sheeps! We had a great time, and we will diffidently going to try their dinner cruise.",UNK
12241,The New York sub was delicious!!!! And I loved that a pickle came with it.... The staff was very friendly and explained the menu since it was our first time there,UNK
12242,"Ordered delivery through Postmates for the late night movie at home - the name wasn't revealed at the time, but the Wingstop name was on the tag when delivered.\n\nThere's nothing to rave about, but maybe because it's just chicken wings. Heh.",UNK
12243,Food was decent. However this is the most overpriced burger in town. $7.99 burger. Fries and drink brought total to $12.77 before tax. \n\nPlenty of other burger establishments where you get more value for same or better quality food.,UNK
12244,"Hard enough to find organic restaurant, these guys have a drive-thru. It can get over-whelmed during breakfast time they need to expand.",UNK
12245,"Grade: D-\n\nTranslation:  Don't eat here because this place sucks. Make sure to clarify with your server that the putrid, steamed mussels they serve will only make you sick rather than make you die.",UNK
12246,"Whipped in with the wife's car due to a low air indicator. Guy hooked me up with a quickness! Friendly, fast service, good job!",UNK
12247,"Over priced, average service. Nothing special with the food. Bland and typical micro waved food. Bread not fresh and wine menu over priced with cheap italian wines. Get costco carry out instead.",UNK
12248,Liked the food a lot. Exciting and exotic taste no matter how you choose to mix up the ingredients. However I'm not always happy with the service. Staff a little rude and inpatient. Maby just to busy? Also portion varies each time I go there.,UNK
12249,In relation to the other options at Gila bend......probably 5 stars...but reality is more like 2 stars....so ends up around 3 stars.,UNK
12250,"The service is great, front, and efficient.. The lady who took care of me, was very polite, very happy, and up beat.. The food flavor was as expected, the cleanliness was great. Food portion were generous. I recommend it.",UNK
12251,"Sitting in bar area waiting on 6 wings. Its been an hour and they are 20% full. Took us 20 minutes to get drinks, too. Will never be back.",UNK
12252,"This place has a good selection of coffees and fancy brewing equipment (i.e. the Clover). I wanted to like it, but it has a cold, generic, kind of industrial interior and both times I've been, while friendly, the service was slow as the barista chatted with friends and/or just moved really slowly.",UNK
12253,"Brigette was very sweet and attentive. Even as busy as they were for Sunday brunch, she helped make our experience here a great one. Ask for her when you come in!",UNK
12254,Food here is consistent.  Is it Wo Hops in NYC? No.  But it's a he'll of a lot cheaper and just as good as PF Changs.,UNK
12255,If you are a South Park yuppie you will love it. If not stay away. Nuff said.\n\nStaff is rude. And they are idiots,UNK
12256,"Good was great, horrible service and place was dirty. Bathroom had no paper towels and toilet was clogged, trash all over floors in dinning area and vinyl on booths needs to be replaced due to shredding. Won't be returning;(",UNK
12257,"I live next to a different Smith's so when I walked into this one and saw how neat and clean they keep it, I was jealous! Freshly baked bread, deli counter, friendly employees and even hot soup that you can eat in the store! Wish I lived closer to it :(",UNK
12258,"This place is no longer in business... It's now Villa Peru I believe. I went searching for this place to go eat breakfast, only to find that other place (and it wasn't open... *tear*).",UNK
12259,"We go here at least once a month. A good selection of interesting sushi. Late night happy hour starts at 10pm. 1/2 price on 1/2 size sushi, but it's the beer prices that make happy hour worth it.",UNK
12260,"Only cool thing about this hotel is how it looks from the outside. We booked last minute and probably got the cheapest room. But it was still 140. The room was like an ok roadside motell. No wifi. Also this is a party hotel. I would stay here again, but not for that price.",UNK
12261,"It's out of the ordinary Mexican food, but darn tasty!  Service seemed a bit rushed when there wasn't much of a crowd.  It's not a place I would drive out of my way for, but if I'm in the area and craving gourmet Mexican, it's solid!",UNK
12262,I don't like any gas stations that have different prices for cash/debit/credit payments.  Why can't they all be equal?  Not coming here again.,UNK
12263,Interesting underground facility on the St-Laurent Main street.  My first time in that place for the Yelp Montreal - Bouge Bash event and I thought that it was interesting.  Could be a nice place for experimental theatre or a small band concert.,UNK
12264,"Overpriced, save some money and go to Famous Dave's more bang for your buck and the food tastes the same if not better.",UNK
12265,another old school Italian restaurant...a number of pasta dishes under $15 and depending upon when you go you might be able to catch some live music...interesting place.,UNK
12266,"The guys at the door have a stick up their ass.  8 cute girls? wait in line? oh- hell no, we had a better time at Pure.",UNK
12267,One of the better restaurants in the land of chain restaurants (Desert Ridge).  Solid Service and delicious food.  I would compare the food to Ra Sushi but the atmosphere is more laid back and less stuffy!,UNK
12268,"Used to like this location.  Green corn tamales are good.  Service and food have gone down hill.  I am going to skip this location, going forward.",UNK
12269,"Update.  According to Groupon, the Mesa location's A/C was broken for several weeks, and they should reopen soon.  Still waiting to try it for the first time.",UNK
12270,"Note: this is a delayed review. The last time I was here was in 2010.\nDelicious appetizer bread sticks. I have tried various fish, lobster, and veal dishes, all of which were very well-sized and appropriately flavorful. Prices are very reasonable for this kind of food.",UNK
12271,The facility is pretty top notch but the help/service here falls a bit short. Twice I've been here and there have been between 4 and 6 employees behind the front desk doing absolutely nothing. A few glancing up at the long line and just continued to stand around.,UNK
12272,Whatever Mexican food and crappy service.  Go find a million better restaurants on the strip.  They also charge for the chips and salsa.  This place will be gone within the year.,UNK

12275,"This was a celebration type dinner for myself, my fiancee, and my future in-laws.  Quite pricey for what they're serving, but everyone really liked what they ordered.",UNK
12276,"Great pizza! I even liked the salad. There are so many pizza places, but I like variety and good quality toppings. Everything was fresh and hot! The food came out pretty quick as well. My little one enjoyed the pizza too. Great for families!",UNK
12277,"Jollibee = fried chicken. & that's about it.\nEverything else is too salty or too sweet. Meals & desserts, respectively.\nThe TFC they play gets pretty old, but I think that's just me.\nOh, the tocino breakfast is pretty good.",UNK
12278,"Not a big Starbucks fan, don't go often, but usually have friendly staff. This was an exception. The young man that was making the beverages was grumpy at best both with me and the other young man working. The drinks were fine but not used to this type of attitude.",UNK
12279,"You're better off going to Chompies down the street. Service here sucks, food is average at best. At one point I noticed the manager come out and grope one of the waitresses. Every time I come here I am more disappointed.",UNK
12280,DO NOT EVER Book ANYTHING with Jet Luxury Resorts.  WORST customer service ever!  I haven't even checked into my hotel and its been a complete disaster!  Vdara needs to drop Jet Luxury IMMEDIATELY!  So awful!,UNK
12281,"Always a pleasure to eat in a Japanese owned sushi restaurant.  Ambience is bucolic (weird description, I know, but the atmosphere was very calming).  Lots of thought goes into the presentation.  My friend ordered the blackened cod which was served on an expertly fashioned banana leaf.",UNK
12282,Got a Groupon for this place and it did not disappoint.  Carne asada taco was amazing. The other tacos were ok too. First time eating Mexican corn and it has a very interesting taste but in a good way.,UNK
12283,Best Italian food I have had. Carbonara and alfredo are excellent accented with the homemade sausage. I agree that this place is located in an odd place. After you eat here you won't believe this place is located in a strip mall. Would have given five stars but kinda slow with the entrees and the check.,UNK
12284,Fun eclectic menu.  Friendly staff. Good food and the roasted Pig is awesome. \nGood selection of fresh oysters. Patio dining with fire pit is a great feature.  Look forward to attending wine events to sample their wines,UNK
12285,"This is one of my tops for tacos, this is great for a weekend nite and for dates because of the setup.  Good food and wine selection",UNK
12286,I was disappointed with the menu as it was very generic. When the food came it tasted fine but just nothing memorable. I do have to give them credit as they served a large group but they added on appetizers without asking in hopes that we wouldn't notice.,UNK
12287,"I've eaten here three times and three times I got the Jewish sliders.  You really just can't go wrong with them :)  The only downside is because it's right on ASU campus, this place is PACKED basically at all times during the weekend but it's SOOOO worth the wait.",UNK
12288,This place fucking sucks it's a very expensive virgin slushy .......... Or someone forgot to put the alcohol in the mix because I drank a whole half yard and don't feel anything,UNK
12289,"Very unhappy with this place, booked it for a friends birthday received a text at 8.11 got to the restaurant at 8.14 and they gave our table away because we were considered late! WTF!!!! I have never seen such bad service, rude staff and the management is even worse. Never will you see any of my money.",UNK
12290,"Somewhat slow service, expected with new staff though. Sandwich took about 15 mins to get, but was fairly tasty, if not a bit messily constructed. Nothing earth-shattering but exceptional choices, this menu runs deep! The bread is good, too. Overall I think it just needs some time to come into its own.",UNK
12291,Texas Roadhouse is a great value. Big portions that you can actually split and share to save money and still be full. Unlimited peanuts and bread rolls. My only negative is that I always have to send my steak and or prime rib back because its never prepared as requested.,UNK
12292,I tried them when they first opened and it wasn't good.  Everything is frozen and reheated/microwaved.  That includes the mac and cheese.  It's Stouffer's - straight outta the box from Costco.,UNK
12293,"I like this little restaurant. The food is affordable, the waiter was funny and very friendly, and they appeared to have a cute back patio with misters for those hotter days. The food was fine, but the most memorable part was the service! Also the cheesy rice and beans on the side and the salsa are very good!",UNK
12294,"This is a nice little coffee shop.  I really like that they have almond milk, not many place do.  The lattes were ok, very average.  Cute place, very nice people working there, great environment.",UNK
12295,Food is good. Says they're open until midnight on Saturdays but I just tried walking in at 9:30 and they told me the kitchen was closed. Bogus,UNK
12296,Sit at the coffee bar when you go to Liberty Market. Order the cortaditos (cuban style micro-latte). You'll most likely order a second round.,UNK
12297,The food/ drink was decently priced but the service was horrible. All i needed was a cup of coffee and waited 15 minutes to get to the counter. \n\nThe people working there are just not efficient at all. \n\nRecommend going somewhere else!!,UNK
12298,Plats excellents. Service client impeccable.\nLa soupe Azt\u00e8que et la barbacoa sont d\u00e9licieux...,UNK
12299,"Corral is right. You get herded in and fed in an overcrowded, messy and loud feeding area, just like animals. \n\nSo sad. I went once and never again. \n\nTake a few steps away to the BJs or Chilis for a much more enjoyable dining experience.",UNK
12300,"Great place to watch sports. The food is good and there are always drink specials. Last time we were there, we had a really great server, Christina. There is a lot of stimulation with all the TVs but that's why you go, right?",UNK

12302,"My rating reflects the excellent atmosphere and cuisine. Additionally, the cigar bar is the perfect place to enjoy a cigar during the cold winter months. Unfortunately, the outright hostility and unpleasantness of the waitress/bartender at the cigar bar has singlehandedly forced my friends and I to head to Lawrenceville to enjoy our cigars.",UNK
12303,"Came here expecting greatness, was very disappointed. Ordered my burger med rare, got it well done. Don't think it would of mattered as nothing on my burger stood out from a burger I could of gotten  from my employee dinning room at work.",UNK

12307,I had a free dozen originals coupon my boss sent me there with. When i told the guy what I was getting he rolled his eyes at me! I get it you're not making a profit from me today but I won't be going back after that. How rude!,UNK

12310,"Terrible customer service, no sense of urgency in this establishment. Three people ordered after me, two of which had been served before my small to go order of spicy shrimp tempura (which I'm still waiting for). Sucks. Where is the order? FCFS.",UNK
12311,"I was hoping to be able to put 4 or more stars like so many others have but I cannot.  The food isn't bad, the service isn't bad, but I cannot say this has been a memorable experience.",UNK
12312,Omg!  I just had the worst shanghai steam dumpling and the preserve pork is too salty. I failed to run a yelp review prior to going in.,UNK
12313,"This outlet location is okay. I liked that they had mens, womens, and kids clothes. I went during winter and they had a good amount of sweaters and jackets. The prices were reasonable but the store was pretty disorganized. Not a bad place to shop if you already know what you're looking for.",UNK
12314,My friends been telling this place has the best dim sum so I always wanted to try out so I did it's not that good at all.,UNK
12315,Rosati's was my go to while in Kansas City so i was glad to have one close that delivers. The pan and double dough are my favorite as well as the calzone and a decent salad.,UNK
12316,"I've been to both Stingrays a few times.\nThe ambiance is nice, but that's about it.\nOn a good night, the sushi is average at best.  \nIf you want quality sushi, look elsewhere.",UNK
12317,This place was a huge disappointment. The cookies were not chewy as they state but over cooked and crunchy. The ice cream itself was also not very creamy and a bit icy.  The only positive was the customer service was good.,UNK
12318,I used to live in the area and was so excited when I came across this one.  One night after a concert my friends and I went their and ordered just about everything on the menu.  All was tasty.  My fav is the Southwestern Pork Quesadilla!!  Nice bar area...too...always important :-),UNK
12319,"a pretty neat museum.  it's not a large one, maybe 20 planes or so.  the largest attraction is US Airways Flight 1549 (miracle on the hudson) ... the actual plane is here.  lots of neat footage/coverage/detail.",UNK
12320,"ASIAN NACHOS: IS  A MUST HAVE!!  \n\naffordable food, great for big parties!! just make sure you reserve ahead of time!",UNK
12321,We thought the food was good but very expensive...which made it just ok.  Make sure you check your bill; we were charged double for desserts.  The waiter told us it happens all the time.  Won't be back anytime soon.,UNK
12322,"Stopped for dinner and it was slow time and service was still slow. The food on the other hand was plentiful and delicious. Had a Ruben with some yummy almost 1/2 pound of meat on it, and the curly fries were yum too. The price was fair too.",UNK
12323,"some of the food was cold. it is an odd take on Mexican food, with unique sauces and such. It is what I would expect from great Midwestern Mexican. Overall disappointment.",UNK
12324,There were six of us and only two people like their food.  That tells you something.  Most of the dishes were not very flavorful.  It was kind of bland and boring.  For the price we paid I much rather go to Roy's for better food at a cheaper price.  Whats with these mediocre fine dinning?,UNK
12325,Really enjoyed the gladiator pizza.  Not a big fan of the salted chocolate chip cookie--maybe an acquired taste.  Would go back for other desserts.,UNK
12326,"It was ok. I have experienced better places that have the same food. I felt pressured to get certain items, being that it was my first time. What's weird is that they have kebobs but no gyros. Probably would not go back especially with Culinary Dropout and Olive and Ivy right nearby.",UNK
12327,"This store has it ALL!!! No more running to all different craft stores. The prices are good and they have mobile coupons just like Joanne's and Michael's. The only down fall so far is that it is closed on Sundays. But, you can spend hours in this store.",UNK
12328,"Got it delivered. Chicken was dry, and some of the potatoes were as well. Salad is completely uninspired. I wouldn't order again considering how many better options there are on the Plateau for authentic Portuguese chicken.",UNK
12329,"Very good, crust and sauce just right, closest to a home town San Francisco pizza..  We had the antipasto salad for the Ist time recently and I was sadly disappointed especially based on other reviews.  It is a good salad but a poor antipasto salad, 80-90% lettuce, it should be labeled Italian Salad.",UNK
12330,"Public house was really good. Good food,  good drink and good service and ambiance. Had the full flight, marrow appetizer, and the pork chop which was really good.  Prices were a bit inflated but hey you're in Vegas so it's too be expected. Would go back without hesitation.",UNK
12331,2 of us wanted to try this place for dinner on a Saturday evening. We were told 20-30 minute wait when they had at minimum of 12 tables open that we counted. Can't foresee trying this place again.,UNK
12332,Not bad but nothing special. it is just in the lobby of the Palms place hotel. Decent size and simple. A little over priced by I guess everything is in Vegas.,UNK
12333,"The great Beijing Noodle Cafe is no more. DO NOT go here. I used to go all the time for yummy potstickers, pork wontons and General's Chicken. New owner new cook and the result is BAD FOOD.  All of the recipes start with \""Open bag\""",UNK
12334,Good stuff.... I always have more sides than I should. ( mac and cheese is awesome) quick and tastey place for lunch.,UNK
12335,Bland bland boring bland flavorless flat dull generic tasteless bland hum drum weak \n\nLet me say boring and bland one more time.,UNK
12336,Mexican food the way my god intended it to be....huge portions and dirt cheap.  The fact that it's good is just a bonus.,UNK
12337,"DON'T SUBSCRIBE!! When you cancel, they will keep calling and calling and CALLING!! I don't want your paper anymore; hence the cancellation. Stop calling me!!!!!!!",UNK
12338,Gross gross made me and my daughter throw up! Go to the deli. If there closed denny's is across the street.  I hate denny's but it's still 100 times better.,UNK
12339,"Medium wait, fast hot coffee, good food....what can you say, it's breakfast for the champions. The Greek Omlette, French Toast and short stack all received thumbs up.",UNK
12340,At$8.00 for a plain hot dog it is a total ripoff. Can buy their hotdogs in the supermarket.  For suckers and tourists.,UNK
12341,"bad crowd. bad people. bad bartenders. bad atmosphere. Terrible food.\n\nA crowd of wanna be tough guys, overly drunk locals, obnoxious owners, and horrible menu.\n\nTO BE AVOIDED!",UNK
12342,Still a cool spot but so understaffed....in my near future I see long waits and confused bartenders...,UNK
12343,This local Bloomfield bar embodies what a dive bar is. Always holding different type of live shows plus a few karaoke nights here and there. Good bartenders. But keep in mind this bar is cash only. So head to an ATM or make sure you carry cash before heading inside.,UNK
12344,"While the food at Fox restaurants is always good this location, on a slow afternoon, had very poor and indifferent service.  We were made to feel unwelcome and as if the staff could not be bothered despite the place being almost empty.  I will continue to dine at Fox places but not this location",UNK
12345,"Didn't enjoy the food at all. The only reason they get 2 stars is because the staff was super friendly. The steak wasn't cooked the right way, actually sent it back twice and they still put in on my bill. Never going back there that's for sure. Total rip off !!",UNK
12346,Great little place. Fun 50th diner theme. Food was good and inexpensive. Homemade deserts were fantastic! We will definitely be back.,UNK
12347,"This place is a lot like your local BJ's, with more beer and crappier food. I only give this place such a favorable rating because they've got a beer for everyone and they've got it on draft. Holla.",UNK
12348,"Salty as hell but so yummy! Every year we come for the pork chili, tortilla soup and huckleberry margaritas! Nice service.",UNK
12349,The servers took like 10 mins to say hello when I sat down. And Julie seems really angry about her job and the coupons people bring in she was going off with someone in the back about it.\nFood was good and quick once we ordered,UNK
12350,I ran into an ex-waitress of this restaurant recently and I was told that the ownership indeed changed and that the new owners were clueless.  Hence most of the staff left (allegedly).  I also heard that this place has now gone out of business.  Anyone know if this true?,UNK
12351,"Don't bother with the grilled chicken it was mostly bread, the club was better and whats the deal with refills.",UNK
12352,Love this store! Close to home and is open 24 hours! Great for my late night cravings. Never have to wait in line and they always have great sales! Not to mention the fresh sushi. Best thing a pregnant woman can ask for.,UNK
12353,very much a tavern with a very industrious feel.  If in the area good tavern but i did not feel like it was a destination place for dinner.,UNK
12354,"The pizza is ok, not great. It is also a bit over priced. However, customer service is pretty bad. The young girl that took my order was impolite and acting as she was making me a favor. Anyway, try it out, not bad but be cautions of people working there.",UNK
12355,Thanks dude with the glasses. You were tacking in charges without explaining anything. Oh and usps does give you a tracking number bro. 70 cents. Thanks a lot for not offering all of your services. I would've left zero stars if I could have. The dude at the cash register was so rude and uninformative.,UNK
12356,Went for the country sausage potato pancakes. Seemed to have forgotten to put eggs on it. Something just didn't taste right.  My other ordered VIB.  Took awhile.  They only had one cook in the kitchen.  VIB was done and then the pancakes came out. At least they where hot. :).,UNK
12357,"I've stayed at worse and better.  The room was fine.  The \""free\"" breakfast was okay.  They had free internet in the lobby.  In a pinch I'd stay there again.",UNK
12358,"SLOW SLOW SLOW. We waited almost 45 minutes for them to change the oil in two cars that were in progress before we ever arrived. Then it was another 30 minutes to change our oil. No \""jiffiness\"" here. Always try to up sell you unnecessary services and products using fear tactics. We won't be back.",UNK
12359,The buttercream coconut frosting was the best part - but the vanilla cupcake was dry and just so-so.  I was disappointed as I was expecting a great tasting cupcake having read some glowing reviews.  Now I know...,UNK
12360,"Terrible, tasteless food\nChicken Asiago sandwich was bland, dry, tasteless.\nChocolate ice cream cup melted\nFrench fries over salted and cold",UNK
12361,"Terrible...empty dining room, food cold, no love in this franchise location like the NLV location...it's 6 pm and empty...ace your appetite for a different location.",UNK
12362,This place is shit the workers lie about transfer fees and when they find out you dont have an AR or Glock they are dicks.,UNK
12363,Walked in on my lunch break. 3 people in the salon and was asked to come back tomorrow. No big deal if they were busy. They do a good job the times I've been there though,UNK
12364,"We had a nice light lunch of French onion soup, Caesar salad and shrimp in a sweet red pepper sauce that was perfect for the beautiful fall day. The outside tables very comfortable and and allowed for some nice people watching. Our waiter was very pleasant. Over all a very nice yummy break in the afternoon",UNK
12365,"Stopped in recently on a Friday night, place was pretty empty. I think I know why. Dim the lights and maybe the place will have a sports bar atmosphere. Didn't stay to eat, I forgot my sunglasses.",UNK
12366,"The bridal salon was packed, dresses stuffed so tight it was difficult to see selection and dresses were dirty. The staff seemed immature and was not dressed appropriately. I tried a dress I liked but then found it at another salon in a better designer/higher quality for less money.",UNK
12367,No repeat visit here.  Service was bad and took too long to get our food.  When we got the check it had a total but didn't show how she got the total.  I still think she ripped me off.\n\nFood was ok but not good enought to make up for the bad service.,UNK
12368,"I really love the experience at Joyride! The atmosphere is very fun, the decor is colorful and trendy, and there is a lot of patio seating! I'm a huge fan of their drinks, especially those on the $5 happy hour menu, and their tacos are pretty delicious too!",UNK
12369,Very bad comunication...after a year of nothing from them i called to find out my ticket was never filed and was dissmised.....at that point i wasnt refunded any mony...thanks for taking my money and not doing a thing,UNK
12370,"Decent drink prices($8.50 for jack and coke), really attractive go-go dancers and blackjack dealers right in the bar!  Is this heaven? No, it's lucky bar.",UNK
12371,"I couldn't try their beer when we went, so this is more of a review on their food and location.  It's different.  We were visiting and friend brought us here.  The food wasn't anything special (we had sandwiches) but the location was interesting.  Worth a visit. Seating was quick.",UNK
12372,Had to find a new optometrist due to a change in insurance and Dr. Grant was the closest provider that accepted my insurance.  Office was quiet and staff was friendly.  There was a nice selection of magazines for the short wait.  Dr. Grant was very friendly and easy to talk to...very good experience.,UNK
12373,"Nothing great and feels like your in a convention center. At 41 per person go upstairs to many of the fine restaurants and enjoy your meal. Bone marrow was disgusting.  Crab legs, skimpy. The only thing I enjoyed was the octopus salad. It was just odd and unique.",UNK
12374,"Not great. Very empty at dinner time on a Thursday. Odd crowd and wait staff seemed uninterested in our table. Food was pretty meh, will not return",UNK
12375,"Walked in here on a Saturday evening and I was really disappointed. The place was a mess, it was over crowded and the music was horrible. I had really been looking forward to coming here and I was sadly disappointed.",UNK
12376,"Decent.\n\nA lot of upselling, but I did great with my compact Toyota.\n\nThe pick up and hand off of the car downstairs could be a bit more streamlined ;)",UNK
12377,Staff was nice and helpful explaining the menu. Food was great. It hit the spot. I had the ham and cheddar panini and chicken noodle soup. Little pricey but worth it. I will be back. I'm excited to try the rest of the menu.,UNK
12378,The worst Starbucks in LasVegas!!!!!! Drive the extra miles to get the service u deserve!!!!! Always out of everything service is the worst ever,UNK
12379,"Got marguerita pizza, Crust is amazing. Flavors good. Hard to eat like a pizza when it's flooded with water from the canned tomatoes. Had to get a fork and knife. Had they used fresh tomatoes pizza would be perfect 5 stars if fixed!",UNK
12380,I would stay away from this Store. They do not care for you . They just want your money. \n\nHave never seen people just not care so well its like their job to not give a damn about you,UNK
12381,"Faux-exposed brick?  Fuck you, Brocach.  Small menu but the food's pretty decent.\r\n\r\nupdate: I can't get an appertizer at 4 PM?  As the kids say \""omgwtf?!\""",UNK
12382,"People seriously over do it with these reviews. Mac n cheese is not good at all, way over creamed, and taste terrible.  sandwiches are very sloppy, not much meat. And the fries...thanks for the small handfull of fries you gave me. I would give this half a star if I could.",UNK
12383,I'm not impressed by Ned's choice of staff lately. The last few times I've come in the ladies at the register have been rude and totally uninterested in what they are doing. This is the reason I haven't been in as frequently as I used to.,UNK
12384,"Great food, fresh and friendly service. Best italian restaurant in North West Las Vegas.\n\nInconsistent service",UNK
12385,"Customer service was amazing. Waiter was super friendly. With this place you can special order which I liked. The sushi was \""okay\"". I would come back if I was in the area. I def did not have to wait 45 minutes like I did with another sushi place so it was worth it.",UNK
12386,"Fell short of expectations. Oysters were tiny! Their Lobster tempura roll was ok not as good as a sushi restaurant would do. \nMiso glazed salmon was okay not as tasty as I've had. The sides of cilantro lime rice , mashed potato and broccoli were excellent.",UNK
12387,"Food was solid, but not necesarrily a must have. Everything looked good and they had a huge menu. I got the Oreo cookie pacakes and they were great. Tasty but not too sweet and overbearing. Was also a ton of food and I could only eat half of it",UNK
12388,"Excellent food. Fantastic service! Highlights of the meal: raw yellowtail with jalapenos, kobe sliders, and the crispy eel specialty roll.",UNK
12389,"We walked out.  Never got to eat.  The waiter was to busy hitting on the 15 year old girls sitting behind us then come up and take our order.  We waited a good 15 minutes and no love.  \n\nNot to mention, the food looked over priced for what is was.",UNK
12390,"The Ulos Batak Sumatra was hands down the worst cup of coffee I have ever had. Way too acidic- as in that \""I just vomited a little in my mouth\"" flavor. Nothing helped the flavor except pouring it down the drain.",UNK
12391,"If you were considering the veggie fried rice, just swing by your local supermarket and buy an onion instead. \n\nAlso, don't expect them to put sweet & sour sauce in your take-out bag if you order egg rolls. They won't.",UNK
12392,Pricey for what you get. Pretty good flavor. Service was ok. I'd say go to Elmer's right down the street instead.,UNK
12393,The drink was good but we also came for food and they were out of 10 items... And they only have like 20 on the menu. I wouldn't come back. Sad face.,UNK
12394,really !!!!!! 20 minutes for cheesy bread and hot n ready pizza lol this place is a f*cking joke. get the kids out of there !!!!,UNK
12395,"I have been here plenty of times....lunch as well as dinner. The food is almost always good. In fact, the location on the west has a nicer ambience so I would go there, especially for dinner.",UNK
12396,"I was very excited about Le Cirque and it turned out to be a disappointment. While the service was good, I thought the food could be improved. I found it to be too rich. What I was most impressed with were the plates themselves. They were very nice plates and probably some of the best I've ever eaten on.",UNK
12397,Eh! Overrated! We aren't dry aged type of meat eaters. It always tastes rotten to me... Sides are OK. Nothing to rave or return for here.,UNK
12398,It's been 2 1/2 years since I posted my original review and this McDonald's still sucks!  We have learned to drive to the McDonald's on Alma School near Ocotillo as it has much better food and service.,UNK
12399,"I went to this store to look for some home d\u00e9cor/furnishings. They really didn't have much that I would want, and the things I did want were way over priced. They have some cute baby gift items and a small selection of jewelry that was nice. The staff were very friendly.",UNK
12400,"I am not a big fan of meat, anything that's inside a can, or sugar  anything however they do have Hawaiian pineapple and its only $1 :) , grapes .79 cents a lb and i got some oranges 6lb for $1 \nI would definitely return just for the produce :)",UNK
12401,"This Costco has a toasted turkey, provolone pesto sandwich on the menu for $3.99... VERY good sandwich. The croud can be pretty thick at lunch time from all the people trying to get free samples, so I recommend going during the week or later on the weekends (after lunch).",UNK
12402,"Horrible!  Ramblings of an old man. The show put us to sleep! The past two vegas shows have been a complete rip off with the host even telling the audience \""ha ha got your money now sit in detention\"".  No more pride.",UNK
12403,You are better off staying in a roach motel. Older than the hills and twice as dirty. It is possible that this broken down shit hole is zombie headquarters.,UNK
12404,"Love BWW. The boneless hot wings are great and there are lots of flavors to choose from.  It is fairly busy when I come which is usually game nights, and the service is good. If you are looking for good wings fast, BWW may be a great choice for you.",UNK
12405,"Moved in last year, it was great at first....then my rent started changing every month or two....so no idea where they get this from. Can't wait to move out now, as the rent keeps changing and they keep gouging for money.",UNK
12406,"As Monte Carlo guests, we were handed some coupon for $3 drafts while we were out at the pool. That was how they got us hooked in. Decent food, however $18 for fish tacos is pretty ridiculous.",UNK
12407,"Mediocre BBQ for North Carolina.  The atmosphere is nice and the people are nice, but the BBQ is middlin' at best.  It is indeed a cool place to eat.  The SouthWest salad is very good and the Pulled Pork Sandwhiches come in 3 different sizes.",UNK
12408,"The lemon Bundt cake with cream cheese frosting was like eating a little piece of heaven. I was torn between the caramel praline, carrot cake, and lemon cake, but I'm so glad that I went with the lemon. It was absolutely fantastic!",UNK
12409,"Just AWFUL. Dirty, stained rooms. Complete lack of hospitality, hoards of wild, loud weekend partying jerks, gobs of screaming, unruly children. Way overpriced everything. They were completely bad. Unless you are a gluttony for punishment, NEVER stay here.",UNK
12410,"Well, my order was wrong...but what I received was pretty darn tasty, so I can't complain too much. Fries were hot, and so was my sandwich.  That's about all I can ask for in a BK.",UNK
12411,"The food is okay, nothing spectacular. The price is a little high for what you get. The service was pretty good. I would go back but wouldn't be my first choice.",UNK
12412,Very poor value for price paid and when they write fresh fish everyday. They might mean fresh frozen products as most of the dishes are tasteless.\nPlease improve the dessert section too!!\nYou have much better option in Vegas for $50 per person...,UNK
12413,"First time at Giant and I have to say, the employees are super friendly, building is gorgeous and coffee was delicious. I will definitely be coming back! Bonus, Bunky boutique inside is fun to walk around in as you drink your coffee!",UNK
12414,"Let me tell you its a hit and miss sometimes the food is good other times its too salty, there mac salad was good but the chicken katsu seemed so thin and the kabi ribs were more bone then meat wasnt very satisfied.",UNK
12415,"Went back a third time. Not sure if they were off their game or what but the food wasn't that good. Sent food back twice, then gave up. Probably wont go back",UNK
12416,"Totally cool place.  Got the whole black metal and dark wood theme going on.  Hip \nbarkeeps, good looking waitresses, hot front desk girls, look to get inside and watch people who want to be seen at this place. Food is secondary to the social scene.  None of us had anything poor but none of us had anything outstanding.",UNK
12417,"Severely overpriced. 42.00 for 3 cocktails. Service for lunch was slow. French dip had no flavor and French onion soup was just \""ok\"". Great view of the strip.",UNK
12418,"Great liitle mexican restaurant in the heart of old port Montreal.  Unique (this it has roasted eggplant in it)  spicey salsa, good guacamole, and frozen drinks.  We stayed at the hotel upstairs. Say hello to Fanny, she runs the place and adds a friendly touch to everything.",UNK
12419,Very bad food. Honestly couldn't eat it. Had to go get more lunch elsewhere and ended up tossing most of the food i got at Zita. Chicken was full of fat and cartilidge GROSS! Salad tasted like someone dumped vinegar all over it!,UNK
12420,This place is delicious and the service was great.  I had the trio tacos which gives you a variety of meats and flavors.,UNK
12421,"Poor food quality, limited menu, wait staff unable to handle our large party (12). Took two hours for low quality bar food",UNK
12422,Went for lunch this afternoon. I got the Tuesday lunch special. Two ground beef tacos rice and beans. All for $4.99. Great price for as much food as I got.,UNK
12423,"I really like Dr Wysong- his nurse practitioner could use a little help on her bedside manner. But- they were able to get my son in quickly as a new patient, and the Doc was thorough, friendly and informative. So, I will be switching my family over.",UNK
12424,It's alright.  Not as good as TuttiBella.  Much nicer inside though.  Great that it's open late.,UNK
12425,You are a prominent bar in downtown Champaign. Why are you serving lousy chips out of a bag and bad salsa out of a jar?,UNK
12426,"I like this place since the remodel - they have decent snacks and beer. Hot sauce for popcorn and an unlimited supply of jalapeno slices for your nachos. Easy to get in and out of here too. Don't bother with the \""rumble chairs\"" - waste of money.",UNK
12427,I like this place.  I don't get a chance to go very often but every time I go it's always good.  I always have the Seared Tuna.  Great place to sit outside and eat when it is cooler.,UNK
12428,"Don't bother going. Walked in very excited to enjoy a cigar & watch the game. No TV's!  They said they didn't want to take away from their sports bar, which you can't smoke in. So I left. Horrible business model.",UNK
12429,The manual car wash is very expensive. I am going to do my car at home from now on. The price of the manual to do a good job approaches a full service wash with interior clean up.,UNK
12430,Beautiful hotel with decently friend staff. Came through this hotel to have dinner and visit Marquee. Great place to party and eat :)\n\nHighly recommend it,UNK
12431,"We always enjoy coming to Coconuts. It's a great alternative to the ubiquitous burger or taco places. The food is delicious and healthful and the staff always friendly. If you're undecided, try the Cajun style Mahi over brown rice- yummy!",UNK
12432,i thought it would be better with all of the positive reviews. Not really impressed. The chips were stale tasting and salsa was average.. the chicken fajita was good but not great. huge portions but i would have preferred smaller better tasting..,UNK
12433,Stopped on the way to Payson.\n\nI was hoping for a good traditional down-home breakfast. What I got was denny's quality,UNK
12434,"When you want a nice cheap fast breakfast on a Sunday night, this is the place to go. Always decent service, and the food is always great. It is clean, and I like that they have a TV on one side.",UNK
12435,"Never ever EVER eat one of their sandwich. The \""cook\"" took literally 1 minute and half to prepare two cold sandwiches which were supposed to be Philly Cheese Steak, Meat was stale. Mushrooms were barely defrosted. Avoid at all cost.",UNK
12436,This place is good for lunch...not breakfast!! Also if your coming for lunch be prepared to wait a while there is always a huge line. I think this place is over rated..deserts are good and a few of the sandwiched but definitely nothing special.,UNK
12437,"Well, ordered pizza with black olives and pineapple. Came with black olives and pepperoni. Since I am a vegetarian that won't work. The salad was OK and cheesecake ok. Nothing special. Very sad excuse for a Streets of NY.",UNK
12438,Co-workers and I ordered pizza as we were working thru lunch.  Ordered at 10:22am for a 11:30am delivery.  Called at 11:50am to find out where our pizza was.  Was told it was in transit.  Pizza arrived at 12:00pm.  Pizza was barely warm.  Usually have no issues.,UNK
12439,"Been here twice and it's awesome and authentic. Same top quality as Los Gemelos on State. Tender steak is what makes or breaks it for me and the steak is delicious and tender. It's small and cramped seating though, so I'll take away one star for that.",UNK
12440,Great place for big group of friends to hang out for some beer any great German food. There Munchner Weisswurste was not bad at all I enjoy in very much. The Creamy Bavarian Potato soup was also good. I'll definitely come back but the next time without the hangover ........,UNK
12441,"very clean, well lit..only wish they had a cover for blocking the sun on some of the benches that are located in the middle of the park that way when its really sunny ur not 2 uncomfortable",UNK
12442,"Since posting my review below, the office contacted me in writing stating that they can no longer see me as a patient. As if I would have ever tried to return there! This place is a joke.",UNK
12443,WOW! I normally wouldn't review a gas station but this place is so bad I felt it warranted it. The angle of the lanes is absurd and it seems everyone there is pissed about something.,UNK
12444,"Unimpressed. Service was bad, the manager couldn't speak English. He didn't know what he was doing and after a 15 minute transaction his employees had to fix the payment problem that he couldn't. I will never go to this one ever again!",UNK
12445,"\""You get what you pay for\"" is an accurate statement here. I wasn't too happy w/ the prices(I've never heard of being charge for gel Polish 'take off' when your getting gel polish again), BUT they did do a great job",UNK
12446,"Still not in love with it.\n\nAgain with the overstaffing and employees huddled, eating/drinking and chatting instead of hurrying up and making my drink.  it is okay to hurry--or is that just my strange, city-thinking?\n\nmeh.",UNK
12447,A litTle confusing when you check in in your mobile! The airport itself quite clean. Really like the layout. Traffic just flows thru there without a hitch.,UNK
12448,"I came here on a Sunday afternoon. My waiter was on point and did a great job. The food was good, but I can't say I really enjoy the decor. Overall I enjoyed my lunch and I would come back.",UNK
12449,I went here for the philly cheesesteak but wasn't that impressed.  The cheesesteak I got from Pellegrino's was far superior.,UNK
12450,"Good hotel experience. Close to airport. Clean property with very friendly service. A bit sprawled out, but on site transportation is easily available. Good gym. Heavenly brunch. Try the huevos rancheros!",UNK
12451,"Crap instruments, will not take back. We had our violin a week bought brand new and it does not hold tune, horrible sound. These people are not helpful, nor do they care. Very cheap products. Look elsewhere.",UNK
12452,"Doesn't even deserve 1 star. Dirty store, the most Ghetto, worst customer service including management, aisles always blocked at night so customers can't walk through loud vulgar employees yelling through the store. More people begging in parking lot than customers. Products never labeled correctly. Never enough cashiers or employees at customer service desk.",UNK
12453,Lovely shops...lovely fountains and statues inside. There are high end and shops and more affordable stores as well. Beautiful.,UNK
12454,So I'm not a big gambling fan to start with. They don't build big facilities because they pay out. I'm at a conference there while getting a beer I ask for a water and the only option is a 12 oz $3 bottle which I don't know until after I drink it.  Lots of suckers in here:(,UNK
12455,"Hey, I loved the breakfast bowl I got here. I think all the breakfast bowls here are really good. Other than that though, the service is just extremely slow.",UNK
12456,Food was mediocre and expensive. Our waiter acted like he couldn't be bothered by us even though we spent a lot of money. This was our most disapointing outing in our Vegas trip.,UNK
12457,"The itty bitty tiny portions they give you is delicious.  Our bill was seriously $63 for a sandwich smaller then an english muffin, cut up romaine with beef over it, and a bowl of fried rice.\n\nWe ate at the airport about an hour later - we were starving!",UNK
12458,"I am really happy with the quality of the food. Price is all right, not the best sushi in madison for sure but not bad also. Come here for the teriyaki.",UNK
12459,"Small portions compared to the rest of the asian places on green st, especially when the price is almost the same. The food is good though.",UNK
12460,Food is generally pretty good but the snotty little brat that answers the phone to take our pick-up order couldn't be more rude and almost ruined our appetite once again. It's a shame how one person can negatively affect a dining experience. The owners should hire someone new before losing more business.,UNK
12461,"Can still say that I haven't been disappointed having gone back to the Blue Saguaro  Jen is right.  The menu may not change but it;s always a good eat,",UNK
12462,"A Mecca for the morbidly obese!  Whatever it is they are putting out on those warming tables, I'm not sure that you should call it pizza!",UNK
12463,Way too over-priced for a not-so-great bowl of pho. The pho was bland and not worth $16. The duck noodle soup wasn't great either. The duck was on the dry side. I will never coming back!!!,UNK
12464,My pizza with goat cheese was excellent. The fries were really good. The buffalo chicken dip was just okay. I wouldn't order that again.,UNK
12465,"Chips and salsa are sooo tasty. A friend of mine had her wedding reception at Las Velas so all I really got to taste were appetizers which were all scrumptious. I'm excited to sample more, but I'll have to wait until they re-cooperate from the fire.",UNK
12466,"Loved them on ABDC.   The show however was more about the miming less about the dance.  They seemed tired and lacking energy and to be very relaxed, half doing the moves.",UNK
12467,"A mean-ass green sauce.  Fantastic attention from the wait staff, and an owner who goes out of his way to make your visit special.  What else is there to like?",UNK
12468,"Thought maybe, just maybe the service at a Denny's in a tourist town would be better that at home in Denver.  NOPE!  Still is extremely slow and horrible!",UNK
12469,Casino management was nice enough to give me a personal call to apologize. He also comped my stay for the first night. It's nice that they still take time to address complaints. I'll probably be open to staying again at their hotel at least.,UNK
12470,The dolly steamboat is very nice and relaxing. The ride is a bit long but it is very nice. The crew of the boat is extremely nice and try to help you see things. My only complaint is that I would of like a little more history of the place then what was said.,UNK
12471,Do NOT eat here! Customer service sucks! We were waiting for almost an hour and we haven't gotten our food so we left! Run far away from this restaurant!,UNK
12472,I love their gyros! It was one of the best. $6.99 special and you'll get fries & a drink. It was delicious.,UNK
12473,"Staff very friendly and helpful with explaining menu items, and making recommendations based on how many you will serve and how soon you will eat. I ordered the food \""to go\""\n\nGenerous portions. Tasty!",UNK
12474,just wondering why they advertise a heated pool when clearly they dont want to have one. also they lock the pool gates so that tenants cant even go sit in the sun.,UNK
12475,Overall it has a good selection of traditional American food with some hints of other great styles.  The best part is they are open late.  The only place in town if you want to sit down after 9pm and get good food!  Lots of TVs - great for sports enthusiasts.,UNK
12476,"When Bob Ostercamp was the manager, this place was the BEST! He had the best mechanics and gave you great service at a discount price. Bob has retired & this place is horrible now. Say they fix things and don't. Don't go, waste of money!",UNK
12477,"THIEVES! Do not pay with a credit card here! My co-worker and I ate here one day, and her husband the day before, and ALL THREE of our credit card numbers were stolen and fraudulently used. This restaurant was the only common denominator between the three of us. Unbelievable.",UNK
12478,"Very tasty food. Great grocery store for Mideast products. I have British Lebanese parents, grew up eating all the different styles of this food, one being a bit different than the other. I like this place.This is worth trying..Cheers",UNK
12479,"Good Chinese take out...never been disappointed here. \n\nThe food is always good, service is friendly, and delivery is extremely prompt.",UNK
12480,"Automatic star awarded for having a salsa bar and a damn good one at that. Nachos were good, but the cheese wasn't melted, which, I will never complain about cheese in any form, but this was a bit different then what I am use to.",UNK
12481,"I love the banh mi sandwich ... and of course, boba! Who doesn't love boba tea? My faves are honeydew and watermelon.",UNK
12482,"This location is horrible. In the 3 times that I've visited, they are rude, never thank you for coming and never seem to get my order correct. They're around the corner from my house, but I will not be spending money there again.",UNK
12483,We went here for the winghart heart attack Pizza. When the pizza came it was  small and had such little bacon on it you could barely taste it very disappointed. Maybe we should have went to the original in Market Square we definitely won't be back here,UNK
12484,"This place is located inside the M Resort in fabulous Las Vegas. They have a selection of pretty pastries and we sampled a few. I've had better, I've had worse. Nothing special. A place like this probably wouldn't survive as a stand-alone store but can make it as tourists walk by in a Vegas hotel.",UNK
12485,"I had the pineapple rice. Overall it was good. I was hoping for more shrimp. In the whole dish their were only two shrimp. Service was good. If I knew there was going to be non existent shrimp I would've ordered something else instead of paying $12.95 for rice, pineapple & chicken.",UNK
12486,"I like to layout but its always crowded and hard to find a table.  Also, the music is too loud and distracting, an okay place to go chill maybe but not if you need to study or get work done.",UNK
12487,"Yeah, um, no. Just don't. Read my quick tip if you can. And if you're interested in that kind of thing, go for it. Otherwise, do not wait in any line or pay any cash to enter this place. Just don't.",UNK
12488,"Been yelled at by other customers (today for instance)...place is super ghetto...avoid at all cost. Today, left a full cart bacause a woman (with a baby in a stoller) shouted at me for \""cutting in line\"". Will never go back. At night it is a nightmare.",UNK
12489,I will never get gas at this disgustingly dirty gas station ever again. Not to mention the false advertising on the sign make sure you read the fine print that says you only get that price on gas if you're paying in cash visit the Circle K next door much cleaner better establishment no cheapskates,UNK
12490,Worst Goodwill I have ever been too. I shop for mens dress shirts and almost exclusively buy from Goodwill. This one was terrible.,UNK
12491,"The entire vibe of this place just felt \""off.\"" The dancers seemed unhappy to even be there. The private dances seemed more like an opportunity to milk as much money as possible from the clientele. Oh, and there's a cover every night for some unknown reason.",UNK
12492,Overall not bad for the price: ordere tempura and fried rice. Both were pretty plain and I gotta express some disappointment with the low amount of shrimp and lack of sweet potato. Also the fried rice could have Used some veggies and egg. Otherwise not bad and A+ for quick and courteous service.,UNK
12493,Good food every time.\nWe get a lot of take-out from here and occasionally dine-in. \n All noodle dishes are great.\nTofu saute appetizer is a favorite of ours.\nSoup is yummy too!,UNK
12494,"A few of us ordered a delivery to work. When i opened my steamy lunch combo, it was super greasy with a  hair to boot. ( which i discovered only after my first two nibbles) nice. i have never ordered from them since. yikes.",UNK
12495,Two stars because the ambiance and service are good.  The food sucks.  It all sounds fantastic but just doesn't come through.  Had the bone in ribeye and a ton of appetizers.  The appetizers were okay and the steak was awful and I mean a w f u l,UNK
12496,Went to this location down from the one on McDowell to get some asthma pills and again they have cards in the slots and again they were out. TAKE THE DANG CARDS OUT when you don't have the product.,UNK
12497,"Bland, greasy, uninspired Chinese food... dark and dated atmosphere... no quality for price paid.",UNK
12498,The food was DISGUSTING!!!! Service was fantastic and the drinks were weak. Not really a place I would flock to with friends for lunch. Kind of a weird atmosphere. The couches on the patio are comfy though.,UNK
12499,"ATTENTION this place taste like crap. And even by crap standard it's too crappy for other craps to like it. Spend your extra dollars in McDonald's instead, because that's more of a 'paradise'",UNK
12500,Nasty beef lo main #nasty egg rolls taste like theres curry and something else....oh no meat when we came,UNK
12501,Very strange walked in and asked to be seated. .. They said they were full and we could make a reservation for an hour later.  The restaurant was empty.  This happened two nights in a row ... Both times we ended up eating at upstairs restaurant.  Service was amazing and food Delicious.,UNK
12502,Used my dry cleaning coupons from the entertainment book in the past years for laundry shirts. Not no more so just stick to all the cheaper same quality shops down Sahara or durango. It will cheaper on your wallet and same if not better quality.,UNK
12503,"We went to the bar for a drink and appetizer.  Service was good enough and the food was acceptable, but the waitress admitted that the bartender was screwing up drinks because he was more concerned about the NBA game then working.  I think this place has potential if you weeded the dead weight.",UNK
12504,"I'm not a fan of gimmicky restaurants or country music.  I met a friend here and even though I wanted to hate it, the loaded nachos were excellent. The music sucked though.",UNK
12505,We go here very often cause we work near by. We always send a food runner to pick up food for about 6 of us since we work the night shift. It might just be their night shift but they are always forgetting for peoples food. ALWAYS!,UNK
12506,Horrible. Being Italian and from the east coast I am a snob when it comes to good italian food. This place was horrible. I had the baked ziti and antipasa. To much dressing on the salad and no sauce on the ziti.,UNK
12507,Food and environment are cool but service is pretty slow. We went in on a slow Sunday night and waited over 30 mins for food with zero refills,UNK
12508,"I only ate lunch here and perhaps I would have experienced something different if not elevated.  Having said that, the Palm was good.  It is located inside the Caesar's Forum Shops and has that outside cafe feel due to the wonderful mall design.  The staff was extremely helpful and friendly.  I probably need to return to get a steak.",UNK
12509,The customer service is horrible. Called them 5 times with 30 min waiting time each. The manager will HANG UP ON YOUR FACE!!!!!! All I need is just to send me the confirmation email. Poor service. Not recommended.,UNK
12510,"This place is great! I had a take out order of Kung Pao Chicken Chinese style extra hot. They were able to crank it out in about 5 minutes!  They gave large portions that made for easily two meals, I would definitely recommend at least giving it a shot.",UNK
12511,"I ordered a fish dish that was too buttery for me, but the rest of the food was good. We had great scallops and oysters. It's a fun atmosphere too.",UNK
12512,Went to the mirage volcano tonight. We just moved here and I have been looking forward to it. Ok for a free show it was good BUT it was only like 3 minutes. Seriously it could have been at least 10. I walked away disappointed. The highlight was the fact that a hungry duck came up so we fed it.,UNK
12513,"A very dated, old hotel with only one pool that is crowded. Terrible coffee shops with terrible quality food court. Yuck!!!!!!",UNK
12514,This place is awesome. What I think an old fashioned supper club would be like.  Huge bar and lots of seating.  The cheese curds are delicious and the fish fry is a must order! Good parking too.,UNK
12515,"A nice quiet retreat. Some humble offerings (soup, olives, peanuts, chips) and a rather basic bar. Comfortable seating and a fair amount of power outlets. Nothing fancy or luxurious here though...",UNK
12516,"disgusting.  i'm here right now and it smells horrible, like urine. note to jasons deli: clean your bathrooms thoroughly. if you have tables (8 tables) near the restroom, remember......people are eating and dont want to smell pee!",UNK
12517,"They need to find a better way of washing dishes. Our coffee cups had stains all over, cutlery had pieces of food and had egg smell all over.",UNK
12518,Compared to Toronto the food was not that great. I had the sweet soy noodles and it tasted like sugar. The place also smells weird and the service was horrible as the waitress could never be found.,UNK
12519,The manager Berry has no people skills or know anything of customer service. Just imagine a knuckle dragging guy who walks around with his mouth open and that's what you get to work with. They are selling second hand defective boots. Don't buy here!!!,UNK
12520,Food was very average and the inside wasn't very welcoming or cozy. Very cafeteria-esque. The food was a little over priced. But if I was really hungry and I needed something convenient I would go here again...,UNK
12521,The drinks and the service at Tavern were just fine.  They had a decent drink special.  But I couldn't really stay too long because it was so freakin hot in there.  We stayed for a little while and moved on to the next place.,UNK
12522,Portions are small for the price and burgers are not that great. Service was not good. they shouldnt leave open kitchen to see them messing around while you wait for your food and the place is empty. Many better options if your craving a good burger.,UNK
12523,"The only time to come here, (If you desperately have to) is early in the morning. As the sun starts going down the store starts getting worse and worse until all the freaks and ghouls come out at night. I never let my mother go by herself here. Its too dangerous.",UNK
12524,This place is really awesome! The food is very fresh and the prices are totally reasonable. The people are really friendly and I will definitely be back :),UNK
12525,I've only tried the happy hour rolls and they were super tiny and falling apart with barely any fish in it. They workers were super nice and had great service so I see why it was busy in there. All the customers and staff were happy so I'll try it again one day.,UNK
12526,"Very good buffet,allot of great fancy selection of food and salad and desserts,buetiful design and decor,good service and friendly...",UNK
12527,The staff were very nice and attentive - shame the drinks ( flavorless and seemingly devoid of alcohol ) and food were not of the same quality. The food was greasy / and sloppily presented and disappointing.\n\nThere are better options on the Royal Mile,UNK
12528,"the cook on the burgers is soo off, service is slow. It is wayyy too busy for the quality of the food and service. \n\nDon't think i'd come back",UNK
12529,The food is not the best. Service is ok but they forgot to give silverware. We had 4 different servers not sure why? Very unorganized.,UNK
12530,"Love that they have a huge selection of flavors.  Their gelato and sorbetto is pretty tasty as well but can be icy sometimes.  Really depends on your luck of the draw.  I think I would appreciate this place more if things were a little cheaper.  Overall, okay place for gelato considering you're in Vegas.",UNK
12531,Ate there twice. Which means we chose to come back. 4 of the 5 of us grew up on Italian food ( mothers are Italian) and we gave it an authentic thumbs up. We will go back again,UNK
12532,"The service was curtuous and knowledgeable... The food was quite ordinary, not the level of what I expected from the critics I read on that restaurant.  The decor is rather dark and sad, the tables were too close to a point that you cannot hear the people sitting at your own table.\nA disappointing experience",UNK
12533,"Ugghhh- called ahead and told it was ready in 25 minutes and totaled $50 for 3 large pizzas.  Upon arriving, I waited 35 minutes longer and was charged $73....blamed on the \""new guy's lack of knowledge\"".  Can I get my tip back?!?!",UNK
12534,Awful. Service poor. Beef short ribs tasted sour. Risotto very salty. Many better places ti eat. Avoid,UNK
12535,"This is a nice place to hang out and have a Burger or chicken dinner.  The pizza is so-so, but they have a lot more on the menu.  They have local entertainment that is surprisingly good.  The bar has added a lot to this community staple. A nice addition to the local food offerings.",UNK
12536,Processed fries nowhere near Belle Pro standards.  I specifically walked to Belle Pro to get some good fresh cut fries but the generic processed fries served here are not up to any of the chain standards.,UNK
12537,"This is THE WORST walgreens i have ever been to. Every single time I go, there is a huge line of people and ONE register open. The cashiers are moving as slow as possible... I can't.",UNK
12538,"The inside of this place was good. The free dessert sucked. The steak had no seasoning, and they were out of iceberg lettuce salad and prime rib. Maybe this deserves a two star rating.",UNK
12539,"Yeah, the service is slow due to the cutbacks in staff.  But all-in-all, this place has good food and good prices.  One of the best Vietnamese restaurants, in our opinion.  Contrary to popular opinion, they are not related to the one in Tempe.  Give them a try.",UNK
12540,"I enjoy Indian food, but this place had the worst service.  We had a table of 6 and some people got their food in 15 minutes, some people got their food in an hour.  What a horrible experience.",UNK
12541,Why do all Panda Expresses fill the serving spoons full to the top then dump about 1/3 back into the bin then give you whats left? Now all you have is a ton of chow mien a bunch of soggy veggies  with sauce and a few pieces of meat..!  This location is really good at that.,UNK
12542,"For a quick bite to eat this is the place, it is inexpensive and filling. The staff is always super nice, and food is always good. Cant go wrong just wish they would open one in Surprise.",UNK
12543,"Desert cabbies are always forced by company to take the longer more expensive route, driver told me company will fire them for \""low-book\"" if they dont tunnel every ride this company is horrible and evil NEVER USE!!!",UNK
12544,The food was good but not spectacular. The atmosphere and service was great. I love the bocce ball court is great. Fun to play while enjoying a cervesa. I'm very willing to give this place a 2nd chance.,UNK
12545,"Anything they say is vegan is not! Everything has fish oil, or oil that has been used to fry fish. There is a lot of cross contamination, and some of their employees are not being paid properly.",UNK
12546,Went back a second time no hostess waited 5 minutes no one greeted us or even acknowledged us I walked out wife stayed and spoke to management on duty that night and they acted as if they didn't care that there staff was offering such poor service. They have one more chance to get it right three strikes and your out,UNK
12547,"Hated it. Even after a 45 min wait for a table, we had to wait an hour for the food. This is no joke. And it wasn't just us it happened to this is the norm. Food not so great.  It was equivalent to Dennys. Sorry but that's the truth!!!",UNK
12548,"Stone crab was nothing special and not worth the price. Steak I had was overpriced, overseasoned and overdone. Service was ok  With so many awesome restaurants in Vegas.  I wasted time, money and a meal here.",UNK
12549,Solid Chinese restaurant.  I always get the Egg Moo-shu and it is amazing. Definitely would recommend Hong Kong Cafe.,UNK
12550,"Never again will I bring my business there. 2nd visit . Waited 3 hours and could only get one of sons hair cut. I understand making an appointment is better, but I know no one there. Just take appointments and no walk ins. There is no list to track walk ins. I'll just take my business elsewhere",UNK
12551,Excellent shrimp cocktail and shredded beef tacos....some of the best I've ever had...customer service was very welcoming and friendly,UNK
12552,"Food is decent and the wait is much, much better than Olive Garden on a Friday night. Service was OK. If it is authentic Italian that you're wanting, you're not getting it here or the Olive Garden...",UNK
12553,Pretty good. There coupons make it a good deal. The only downside is they charge a $1.00 to use a debit card which is crazy to me....,UNK
12554,The casino is nice the only problem is you have to go thru an army of very aggressive sales people to get in. \nNot worth it. One of the worst spots on the strip. \nI yelled at one of them to leave me alone and they surrounded me and my wife. \nYou have been warned,UNK
12555,The Gameworks at townsquare was such a disappointment. They barely had any good games and is smaller than the original gameworks. They could have fit in more games if they left out the bowling and restaurant area that nobody was using. Oh well...the best game in my opinion was the Family Guy pinball game.,UNK
12556,"Be careful when ordering! Apparently, they put roe (fish eggs) on everything but don't specific whether it comes on it. I ordered sashimi and it came out with roe.",UNK
12557,"This place does a pretty good job with the car wash but the attendant that takes your money is always saying inappropriate things to me. If you are a woman, be warned.",UNK
12558,"This owner also runs Ground Control in Verrado, my suggestion is to STAY AWAY. \nPoor service.  Poor food",UNK
12559,Another fine dinner at China Village.  I ordered Ma-Po bean curd for dinner.  I had enough to share with my dinner mate.  The service was excellent as usual.  The hostess was very concerned that my group enjoyed their dinner.,UNK
12560,Not a bad place to eat. A little pricey for what you get. Nice location with a patio. Good place for happy hour.,UNK
12561,I came here on a recommendation on how good the food is. I was disappointed with the salad that had brown wilted lettuce that tasted old and the Sausage sandwich was just OK. Next time I will try the pizza only.....that's if I make it back.,UNK
12562,"This place only offers meatballs and they are terrible. The meatballs are flavorless, mealy and have more bread crumbs in them than meat. This place wants to be hipster but they're missing the good food. Don't go here.",UNK
12563,"Menu was nothing spectacular - pasta dishes were okay, but nothing to write home about. Prosciutto wrapped chicken was pretty good and their bread is addictive. The overall quality of the meal versus the high prices was not worth it.",UNK
12564,"Horrible customer service. Didnt make the repair i dropped a pair of pants off for. Came in with cash and the owner couldnt make change as \""everyone\"" uses a card!?!\nSent me away to get change. Horrible. Never go back.",UNK
12565,Should have never changed the recipes. I have been back twice since new ownership. I have to say I will give them one more shot. The place has lost the touch of service that was given. I feel while talking with workers that they can do better since everyone was really nice.,UNK
12566,Best Cheap Eats at Planet Hollywood.\nVery consistent and nice price. Not the best sandwich but I tend to go their often!,UNK
12567,"Great experience! Went in for gel polish change, no manicure. They only charged $15. I've been charged up to $30 at other places. No nonsense, quick service, no annoying upselling. The place was a little messy but nothing that made me concerned about safety or sanitation. I will go back for sure.",UNK
12568,"Love the sandwiches. Roommate introduce me this place and now I am addicted. I really enjoy there hot sauce selection. I recommend backdraft, it's a 7, feels like a 9.",UNK
12569,"The tacos and salsa are some of the best in town.  Overall I love Los Olivos, however the atmosphere at this location is only one step up from a Denny's.  I prefer takeout at this location!",UNK
12570,"This is my least favorite airport to fly into. It is usually crowded (Vegas, duh!) and I never seem to have any luck with connecting flights being anywhere close to each other.",UNK
12571,"Not amazing, not bad. I would go back some time if I was craving Mexican food and happened to be at NYNY.",UNK
12572,"Would not use as a shipping service, they are extremely slow to process even if there is no one in line. Makes even the post office look good.",UNK
12573,A nice variety of asian plates are offered in this place. Not the best ones I have tried in all categories but if you want variety this is a good place.,UNK
12574,"I've eaten here twice now. The service has been outstanding. The steaks good, the braised short ribs are to die for.",UNK
12575,King Putt is fun for about 20-30 minutes and your done.  Other than that the concept and black-lighting  are pretty cool.  \n\nCheap with plenty of price discounts but for how fast you can run through the course you may want to save this for a slow night when you can't find something to do.,UNK
12576,"Wow,  spent $65 for breakfast. Service was poor, food was worst. It was disappointing. Bacon taste like .......nothing. pancakes was worst.",UNK
12577,"I'm currently looking for a new nail salon, which can be stressful. Thankfully I found T2 Nails. Not only were they friendly and professional, they did an excellent job for a reasonable price. I am definitely going back.",UNK
12578,If it was possible to give 1/2 a star I would.  The staff (all look to be teenagers) could have cared less about the customers.  Two employees were complaining about another employee coming in late.   The sundae I ordered looked like it was slapped together.  My husband said his blizzard was fine.,UNK
12579,"I love the ambient lighting and artsy decor. Wine was good. Great flavoring, slight hint of sweetness. Would recommend the Truffled Mushroom Pizza or one of their bruschetta planks. Tiramisu once again proves itself. :)",UNK
12580,Friendly staff \n\nDecent lunch specials\n\nThe chow mein tasted a lil off than what I'm used to. Entree portions are decent.\n\nBoba! Good serving of boba ...,UNK
12581,Prices are ridiculous and the food is mediocre.\n\nSave your duckets ($$$$) for China Town where you can get 2-3 dishes for the price of one dish here and have the flavor smack you and your fellow diners.,UNK
12582,Calamari is awful.  Hot wings are salty.  I know the pizza is great and so are the stuffed mushrooms but tonights choice of wings was a let down.  *I miss Hefs wings. \n\nOn the bright side the bartender is kinda cute.,UNK
12583,"After eating at this establishment a number of times, I must say that it's very eh. It's a chipotle influenced Hawaiian style restaurant . Every dish I've tried here was kind of bland, save for that strong seaweed flavor in the rice. I don't think I would ever have the desire to eat here again.",UNK
12584,A coworker and I came here while in town for a trade show.  The burger selection and combinations was impressive and while it wasn't cheap (what in Vegas is) I felt that it matched it price.  Nothing jumped out at me but I left full and satisfied.,UNK
12585,"Delicious roasted vegetable salad and Earthy Delights sandwich. Many creative menu selections. Lots of comfy seating, Friendly staff. I would come more often if I knew they were buying from local sources...was disappointed to see that the butter came from Minnesota, What's up with that?",UNK
12586,"I am usually a huge fan of Wildflower, but not of this location. The coffee was old and the food was cold. When I asked to get cooked potatoes they were very sweet but still gave me cold food. Disappointed!",UNK
12587,"This is just awesome bread and some great breakfast treats - they don't have as a big variety for the breakfast stuff as I would have hoped, but man do they have the options on bread - definitely give it a try.",UNK
12588,"The view is good.  The food is alright.  For the price you pay for fine dining, atmosphere and service, you have better choice in Vegas.  The only good thing is the souffl\u00e9",UNK
12589,Terrible. Had the brie app and rabbit app. Both less than stellar.  Beet salad was good but SMALL portion for 11 bucks. The only thing that was good was the pour....which should have been for 11 dollar house wine. This place gets and F.,UNK
12590,Waited over 25 min in the drive thru because I had no choice (blocked in) after the cashier took an order from a guy on foot... Boo this place. Disgrace to the Starbucks chain.,UNK
12591,I'm pretty sad the one in Scottsdale makes an amazing gluten free pizza. This one wasn't cooked and super greasy in just didn't  taste good I'm so surprised of the big difference. Bummer,UNK
12592,"Cheap haircuts, done quickly, especially if you check in using their app. My only complaint is that I never seem to see the same person twice, so there is no way to have someone used to the way you want your hair done.",UNK
12593,My boyfriend and I had 2-1 drink coupon. We some chips and salsa with margaritas. It was fine. Nothing special take it or leave it. Waitress where nice.,UNK
12594,What a joke. We were seated promptly and then quickly forgotten about. Were ignored while others were seated and orders taken. After no acknowledgement for 15 minutes we left hungry. F U Wendy. F U and your noodles.,UNK
12595,Nice clean restaurant with plenty of parking in a strip mall.  Menu has nice variety of Vietnamese cuisine.  Pho Dac Biet is good. Plenty of noodles and meat to fill you up.  Spring rolls were delicious as well.  Good came out really fast when they not busy.,UNK
12596,"You get what you pay for. The beds were horrible and the bathroom not much better. There is parking (a little expensive--you would think that they would allow guest to park for free..) The only good thing about it was that it was close to everything, and that it was somewhate affordable.",UNK
12597,"They do not have a key cutting shop, very deceptive as they provide an address, the address they gave is the store owners \""base\"".",UNK
12598,This restaurant has one of the best Caesar Salads i have had in a very long time! Frisee salad was also delish. My girl's pizza was very good. The service was great - our waiter was wonderful. The prices were right.\n\nOverall a very nice dining experience.,UNK
12599,If I could give them a ZERO I would.  Forget customer service.  If you have a technical problem....hire someone.  They NEVER answer the phone!!!!!  I wish they didn't have monopoly.,UNK
12600,It's average for a steakhouse and definitely not worth the price.  We've had better food but the service was great as you'd expect in Vegas.,UNK
12601,For Delivery I received 2 club lettuce head sub. seriously ?! where's the turkey ? oh look I found three slices I paid $7.99 each  I don't think I'll be ordering that again,UNK
12602,"It would probably be helpful to remember that if you set expectations it is better to under promise and over deliver.  Also, if you have too much business, raise your prices.  People will pay a little more for better service.",UNK
12603,The quality of sushi was excellent.  That was the only good thing about this place.  There is no reason on this earth that it should take over 45 min to get 2 rolls and I nigiri.   Terrible service.  Nearly walked out.  Also a bit noisy.,UNK
12604,"Sloppy, slow, waiter wiping his nose as he brings my sandwich. Ask for a substitution to fries and for got a quick no. Bathroom outside the restaurant?",UNK
12605,"i got a giant fucking burger. The beef and grilled onions were really good, but the whole thing was super salty. Saltier than the fries. The pickles are a waste. Zero flavor. The worst is the awkward silence between the terrible country/90s rock. Get a tv or a fish tank or something!",UNK
12606,"Service 4/5\nDecor 4/5\nFood 2/5\n\nNothing we ate had much creativity. The frog legs were okay, the salad, and Jambalaya were mediocre.",UNK
12607,"Food was mediocre, desserts underwhelming, terrible service. Happy hour drink prices are excellent. Mist likely won't be back. Too bad, had such high hopes! The only redeeming thing is that the food runner was dancing as he delivered food, nice to see an employee who enjoys his job.",UNK
12608,Went here for a happy hour and was very disappointed with the food and service. We even had to call the manager over. Hopefully it was just that one time. The 2 stars are only for the beer and atmosphere!,UNK
12609,Don't go here if you aren't Chinese ...they will help everyone else first. We got there and they tried to sit the people behind us first until they said no they were here first. We sat for 10 minutes and watched them seat and serve 3 tables after us until we got up and walked out.,UNK
12610,"Had reservations and were excited to eat here. Unfortunately, the kitchen was excruciatingly slow, and the waitstaff did not seemed concerned about the delays in the least. The food did not redeem the poor service: scallops were rubbery, spinach overcooked. I wouldn't recommend Fishers in the City.",UNK
12611,"The shrimp and grits are delicious, as is the chocolate pecan pie.  Some of the other dishes are a little more mediocre and they seem to have a problem getting the food out hot.  Still a good bet if you are in the area.",UNK
12612,"My friend was super excited to get some crazy bread - she kept talking about it since we left Portland.  So I headed over to the Luxor food court from Mandalay for them.  The bread sticks were a little tough and needed more parmesan cheese.  Luckily, we got the dipping sauce to soften it up.",UNK
12613,Gross.  I was here with coworkers and we should have known it wasnt going to be good by the name.  I ordered the Chopped salad and the sausage pizza.  The salad was fair but the pizza a terrible.  The service was good from Eddy,UNK
12614,"Gotta admit, this is a great place for take out.  Our whole office orders from them and they are quick, yummy and cheap.  It's our go-to take out place!",UNK
12615,"Very small portions, but stellar food. Great patio dining. Their grilled polenta and sweet corn ice cream is one of the best desserts I've ever had!!",UNK
12616,What can you say about Chilis... it's a Chili's! The menu has improved quite significantly though...,UNK
12617,"The most expensive sleep I ever had.\n\nNow, I dont mind spending $150 to see a good show.  Heck, I'll pay more if I have to.  Phantom is definitely not worth it.  The show put me to sleep.",UNK
12618,"Great donuts, bad service.  I've been there three times, ordered the same donuts (6 gourmet) and was charged 3 different prices.  When I told the salesperson, she had an attitude.  This review is for the store at Town Square.  Thanks to the service, I'm not going back!",UNK
12619,Great food at a great price! Almost everything is under $7!  Even better when you can score a groupon now and you get $8 worth of food for $4!,UNK
12620,"I had heard a lot of hype about this place, but it was overpriced and the meatballs are better at subway. This place is gross and I won't be back, ever!",UNK
12621,"Great Carne Asada and Chicken Tacos. \nSimple menu, REALLY well prepared food.\nSalsa and Condiment Bar was a win. \nCrowded interior (because the food is so good)",UNK
12622,"I like this place for business travel.  Within walking distance to lots of cute restaurants.  Good breakfast, comfy beds and quiet nights sleep.",UNK
12623,"My advice to the upstairs bartender: take a deep breath, sit back, and reassess your career choice if working at a fun, packed show in a cool city is that much misery for you.",UNK
12624,Ended up here because several other places were closed for holidays to reopen Sept 2.  Disappointing meal to say the least.  The hot and sour soup was neither hot nor sour. The Xin Jiang chicken wasn't nearly as good as the one at Waterloo Star and the portion was smaller.  There are better alternatives in the plaza.,UNK
12625,I've been there twice and had very poor service both times.  I also got food poisoning from one of their salads this past weekend.  I will never go back!  Read the worst reviews posted here.  They may sound like horror stories but they are the average customer experience at CASA.  Stay away!,UNK
12626,"Best red velvet cupcake ever! The sugar cookies just melt in your mouth. The fondant work on the cakes is great, but I do think they are bit expensive.",UNK
12627,"Really bad service ! Stick with Discount Tire!  They can't ever seem to get you in and out quickly, even when there not busy.",UNK
12628,"Good service, sweet waitress, food was horrible and over-priced. Do not get the potato pancakes they taste like they were frozen and than heated up, cheap Motts applesauce for a topper. Beer was good but still expensive!",UNK
12629,Was not impressed. Don't come here if you are trying to watch a game. Came to watch a playoff game and couldnt even see a tv. The Gila monster was disgusting. Didn't even taste like anything. Not worth the $9. Also the pretzel platter was nothing special.,UNK
12630,"Very nice, polite, clean and air conditioning! The staff was a little short handed when I went, people were waiting a long time. But, call ahead if you can it and would be alright.",UNK
12631,"Change the times of business operations of this place on here. They close at 10PM on Fridays, not 11PM. Not sure about the other hours, but maybe it'd be a good idea if the hours were updated. It's a bit annoying for customers and other yelpers.",UNK
12632,"DO NOT ORDER THE HOT WINGS!! If you enjoy eating hot sauce flavored gravy paste, then by all means these are the wings for you. If not, stay away. My boyfriend and i each ate one and couldn't even finish the rest of our dinner. Don't waste your money!",UNK
12633,"Fig on a pizza? Yes please!  Add some prosciutto? Yes, please some more!\n\nGood wine, great company and thin crust that doesn't overpower the flavors on a piece of pizza pie...I'll be back!",UNK
12634,"I had fun, but wouldn't likely do it again. Everything was cool, just not that exciting at 43 years old. Glad that I did it, but wasn't that impressed with the overall experience for the cost. The packet pickup line at Sports Authority was a joke.  Most people loved it and definitely worth trying once.",UNK
12635,Made us buy two entrees under groupon. Kimchi good but overpriced. Never visit again. Bathroom will be your friend after.,UNK
12636,What's the point of of a store front if you don't keep consistent hours. I refuse to support this place any more because they can't seem to be open other than when it's convenient for them. I could over look the high prices if they kept better hours.,UNK
12637,Baby back and St Louis sale ribs are awesome. Love the coleslaws and baked potatoes.  Will sure be back next time we are in town!!!\n\nCorn bread is also very very good!!!,UNK
12638,"9 holes ,I have been going to this place last year & this year once a week. It's always great, well maintained, nice putting green. Yes I seem to loose balls in the water also. MMMMmmm? The price seems very reasonable to me.",UNK
12639,"Place is a rip off, they over charged me for an A/C job when the machine did all the work while they worked on other cars. Place try's to find work so watch out for over charge and breaking things on vehicle this place is communist",UNK
12640,"Food had no flavor and was pricy. Should have just gone to chipotle.\n\nRice was so bland only had one bite. The beef in the chimichanga was horrible quality meat, I get a lot better quality meat from street tacos.",UNK
12641,Came here not knowing it was the clearance store. It was worth the trip for the New Year's Day sale but the store is old and run down,UNK
12642,"The food and wine was amazing, but the super high price is going to make this a 4-star.  Although I must admit that the price was a direct result of ordering numerous glasses of wine rather than a bottle.  Dumb.  But it was the best meal we had in Vegas, so call it a 4.5",UNK
12643,very bad service and give wrong items.i will. never come this restaurant anymore. dont come for your nice vocation.you will get mad,UNK
12644,"Good to have a Filibertos in S Phx., food was gud but I think their California burrito needs to taste like the ones made in mesa :)",UNK
12645,I do not recommend coming here for breakfast. The menu is over priced for terrible food. I had the scrambled eggs with bacon and wheat toast and my mother had the french toast. The food was luke warm to cold and wouldn't recommend either.,UNK
12646,Quick Trip has always been my fav in the valley. Usually clean and great on service. EXCEPT THIS ONE'S BATHROOMS!  WOW. Towels on the floor and toilets that were not clean. I believe the staff need to clean the bathrooms more frequently.,UNK
12647,"Great service and well thought out menu. It's a solid chain destination that offers fresh options for everyone. It's a true chain with its consistent portions and seasoning, and it's always a solid experience. Bar and dinner service are always quick and efficient. Make reservations.",UNK
12648,We got in for breakfast & brunch just because it is too cold outside. The lunch menus has very limited choices. The food is so so average for the price. It looks very normal. The service is good though but I would rather save my stomach for nicer food in other restaurants.,UNK
12649,"The food is pretty decent, but over priced.  Given that this is pretty much the only authentic Korean place in Pittsburgh, I guess they can do that.  You do get a fair amount of food, I always have leftovers.  Service is friendly and quick, and the food hits the spot when you're craving Korean cuisine.",UNK
12650,stopped in for drinks at the lobby bar.   they have a fair seating area and a great beer menu.   The service is good and prices are a little higher that the beirmarket across the street.   They have 4 large tv screens way up high with the latest sports and news channels.,UNK
12651,Definitely try the Blackened steak panini. Ridiculous flavor and it Destroyed every ounce of hunger in me lol,UNK
12652,"Great customer service in the begining. Nice floor layout, but the rooms were small, no fridge, coffee machine, probably wont stay here again but would like to cpme see the shows.",UNK
12653,The best Mexican food!  The chicken and cheese burrito is the best on the menu!  But I would suggest to do take-out because the place is not that nice to stay at.,UNK
12654,Really good food!!!! You can taste the flavor of whatever you eat!!!! You must try it!!!!!,UNK
12655,"Been coming here since it's opened and I'm still impressed with the consistency and friendly atmosphere.  Our bartender Lori is always smiling and never ceases to amaze me with her knowledge of cocktail concoctions and ability to make them great.  The food always taste well prepared and fresh, never been disappointed.",UNK
12656,"The food was good, but I order an appetizer and they brought it out with my food. I expected or receive my appetizer before I my maine meal. Over all had fun I only gave 3 stars because it's an average place to eat nothing special.",UNK
12657,"Excellent value, if you can't afford (or have already seen) Penn and Teller, check this show out. Mac King is an inoffensive, family friendly magician. The jokes are funny and the magic is excellent.",UNK
12658,"The food here was good! Needing a break from the Strip prices and fancy Casino restaurants, I ventured out and found this place. I was really pleased with the food and portion size. Pho had a great flavor and loved the peanut sauce for the spring rolls.",UNK
12659,"I got a price quote to compare to plumbing medic and it came out nearly half of what Plumbing Medic wanted to charge for a simple job.  Use EZ Flow Plumbing/Scott.\n\nI will never call these guys again, hope this was helpful to someone!",UNK
12660,Came in for lunch today one person ahead of me cafe not full took 1/2 hour to get my food.  Don't understand how this happens doesn't even take this long to get food at a full on Mexican restaurant that is packed full.  Pretty rediculous if you ask me. Should have gone to subway next door,UNK
12661,"This is the worst Hard Rock ever.  Our server did not know what the word means and had a hard time finding our table back.  We got the only thing we wanted, a t-shirt and will not be back.",UNK
12662,This place gets two stars only cause the waitresses we hot and nice.  The food SUCKED!  it was so bad I didnt even finish it.  and the next day i felt like CRAP till i crapped it all out of my system.  100% low quality CRAP!!  Worse than Taco Bell.,UNK
12663,"nope. nope nope nope nope nope nope. \nservice was poor and every beer i asked for they were out of. i dont want to sit here and write a long, bitchy review so i'll just go with this: never coming here again.\nthe end.",UNK
12664,"At these price points I expected a Ruth's Chris or similar steak house. I had great service, but my steak just didn't seem to be at the quality it should be to justify the price. If you truly want a high end steak house then keep looking.",UNK
12665,"This kind of bar isn't my thing, but out of town guests may like it. It's a pricey venture and the inside, while fun for the first 5 minutes, is grating and hard to deal with after a while. It's too bright and too loud...and the music is awful to boot. Yikes.",UNK
12666,Highly overpriced and food was cold. Our waitress seemed confused and didn't know the menu. She had no idea about gluten free. The gluten free bun was awful.,UNK
12667,"Yummy Duck tacos!!!! They are a must have if you come here. Pizza was eh ok, kind of greasy.",UNK
12668,This is a small italian joint nestled in near Anthem. The food is good and prices are reasonable. The staff is so italian I would be suprised if everyone here is a made man. The stories they have are great and add to the atmospher. I recommend at least trying this place out.,UNK
12669,"Priced right & yelp got coupons...with that said, parking space was a little tight for larger car or suv. Also, getting out of the Terminal 3 parking lot was a little scaring as the one way sign was off and almost went backward. Yikes!",UNK
12670,"\""Went to Valley Luna on a Sunday for the specials I found using the Happy Hour app. $2 drafts and mimosas. Got there asked about the specials, they would not honor those prices, said they're $2.50. I decided to leave and the waitress bad mouthed me to my girlfriend...\""",UNK
12671,"The burgers are pretty good, especially all of the choices available for customization. The different types of fries are also good. My main complaint is the interior--it is cramped and not all that exciting. As well, the service is sometimes off.",UNK
12672,"I remember when this place opened in 1988 -- it was sleek, served great drinks and eats. I've been back once or twice since then, and it never seems to disappoint.",UNK
12673,"Small, overcrowded, unfriendly staff.\n\nThe food is okay - typical Italian fair that could be better seasoned. \n\nThere are much better options nearby, but in a pinch, it's decent.",UNK
12674,Great food & music. The tea is as sweet as their staff. I would give them 5 stars if they would stay open. It is always a treat to see the open sign light on.,UNK
12675,"Your usual big box steak place.  Nothing fancy, I had your standard ribeye with mushrooms and Bordelaise piled on top.  It was cooked correctly(medium rare) and the sides were fine.(mash potatoes and vegetable)  Service wasn't bad either.",UNK
12676,"Very bad service. Book one for 8:15am, never shows up. When called, said the driver stuck in traffic? but it is already 2 hours late and there is no traffic at all.",UNK
12677,"Horrible pizza, paid $20 for a large pizza and the mushrooms are from a can. I rather have purchased a pizza from the grocery store for $10",UNK
12678,got a pancake and double americano. Both were really good. Pancake was maybe a bit underdone but overall it was all very good. Didn't need to sugar the coffee.,UNK
12679,We were looking for a new Asian restaurant and found it here. I had the Pad Thai and it was wonderful. Great chicken soup and service,UNK
12680,Overall one of the better high end buffets in Las Vegas.  Lots of selection and food generally good quality for a buffet.  The other buffet I would definitely recommend is the Bellagio buffet.,UNK
12681,"Love this place. My friends and i go here often for breakfast. The mardigras omelette is good as well as the eggs benedict. this place gets busy in themornings on Sunday so there will be a little bit of a wait sometimes. Overall good breakfast or brunch place, they also serve dinner as well.",UNK
12682,Very very mediocre sushi in tiny portins with slow service.  This only gets two stars because of the happy hour special.  Head elsewhere for sushi.  Takumi is better and Muramoto is much muich better.,UNK
12683,"What a joke. Went there for \""happy hour\"" on Friday and paid $16.00 for a 16oz drink that was 90% ice.  No AC and no waitresses. No!! I will NOT be returning.",UNK
12684,Sent my son down to get his car washed. Checked with him later and found they did a horrible job. Dash was not cleaned and the interior looked like it had not been vacuumed. I contacted the company through their email but no reply. I guess they do not need my business.,UNK
12685,This place really isn't all hyped up to be. I had a champon spicy and it was way too salty. I'd rather have Vietnamese pho any day.  It costed $15.  I will never go back.,UNK
12686,This place is completely overrated. It's a Korean infused Noodles & Company at best. It blows my mind to hear that people are waiting almost 2 hours to eat here. Don't waste your time and money. Madison has way better to offer.,UNK
12687,Food is ok but service sucks. I though they were having an off night but then it happened twice. I prefer Jewel of The Crown in Scottsdale. Their food is superb and the service is ALWAYS good and fair.,UNK
12688,"I don't know why people disliked this place.  On a late night in Vegas, this was the go to spot for pizza delivery. I thoroughly enjoyed the flavor of their pizza.  This being open late night was a good look.  Liked the Spinach and Feta, the crust, the sauce.  Bam!  Thank you Cafe Verdi!",UNK
12689,"I still stand by the previous review. I do stop by if I am in the neighborhood and need coffee. However, this just isn't a place to hang out on a whim anymore.  It's usually PACKED between the hours of 10 to 6.  Outlets are at a premium. Bring an extension cord AND a power strip!",UNK
12690,"The food is delish, but the service is so SLOW and not good. Also, the dining room is filthy! Dirty tables, disgusting floors, dead flies in the window seals. It wouldn't surprise me if the restaurant ended up on dirty dining. It's ashame because the food is very, very good.",UNK
12691,"Decent little bar, grill and pool hall. Bottled beers are icy cold.  Oysters are always good and cheap too!  Chili is pretty good as well.  Definitely deserves better than 2 stars! Music can be a bit loud at times...",UNK
12692,"It's honestly the best boba we have here in LV. Though the service can definitely improve, their drinks are always consistent which I like. I love boba milk green tea and would recommend it to any newcomers to boba.",UNK
12693,I was a big fan of this place initially but they are very inconsistent with the quality of their coffee. The temperature of my coffee is always a surprise. I do recommend buying their bagged coffees.,UNK
12694,Service was a little slow at the bar but it was a Sunday evening. Great Big Screen televisions with good visibility  from all areas of the bar. Food was good though! Kind of a unique menu with some homemade options.,UNK
12695,"Food is awful and so greasy. Service was good, but food is bleh. Go to Doan's instead.",UNK
12696,"Tasty cocktails, unique and historical recipes.  Not so great appetizer menu.  Prices seemed a little high and the only food on the \""happy hour\"" menu seemed to be steak.....strange.  Exterior definitely does not match the interior, which is cooler than it first appears when you drive up.",UNK
12697,This place SUCKs !!!\n\nWaited 2 hours for the food\nThen get hit with a 18% service charge\n\nFOOD taste NASTY,UNK
12698,Best thing about the place was the giant TV screen so I could watch the Eagles while in Vegas.  Food was very fair and overpriced.  Maybe the food tastes better if you're drinking a lot.  Wouldn't recommend the place.,UNK
12699,"Not even worth to try. No complaint for service and I respect that, but food quality was very poor. It felt like all microwaved food...specially when food comes to table in five minutes or less.",UNK
12700,Good was good-had the duck poutine which was good but very salty. The service was lovely; very kind. The music is very loud- expect a lounge feel. It is pretty pricy for the food but overall a good experience,UNK
12701,Bland!!! The worst rolls I have ever had. No taste at all and the soft shell crab ... Eww what was that? A strip of flour! and .. didn't know edamame could be bad. Will not be back!! Terrible experience,UNK
12702,"One of my favorite places to eat in Las Vegas. Great music, great vibe and most importantly great food. Their buffalo wings are some of the best I have ever had and drinks are really affordable too. Overall a great place if you want to catch a game so or simply to dine out.",UNK
12703,"The buffet was ok for $11, but it was not worth the drive from the strip.  Definitely a spot for locals and not snobby tourists like me.",UNK
12704,Customer service must be the worst in las Vegas in the casino. Lots of apologies but no one doing anything to fix the problem the entire slot area malfunctioned waited over an hour to get paid,UNK
12705,"Service at this location is on the decline.  I used to be able to go in and see personal I knew and trusted, but they have recently been running through desk persons pretty fast, and I often feel like I have been given the run around upon leaving...instead of long term customer care, they only seem interested in the $!",UNK
12706,I never thought in my life I would leave a KBBQ place hungry.  The meats are if poor quality.  While the sides have a good selection I did not enjoy the flavors.  The service was good but that's the only thing I can say.\n\nNever again!,UNK
12707,They are cool because they are a dropoff point for The Bra Recyclers!  The donation slip also entitles you to a 10% discount in the store.,UNK
12708,"The owner followed-up with my about my experience, which I do appreciate. Not sure if I will come back but to take the time to respond to negative reviews is something worth noting.",UNK
12709,Went on a week day for dinner. Service was so so and so was the food. Nothing to really brag about. Place is old and had a funky smell when you walk inside. I would say this is more a local watering hole then a restaurant.  There are better places to go then here for Oysters and other food.,UNK
12710,Good stuff but didn't take my yelp coupon. :( cuz it wasn't the right size appetizer. I would of known if they offered different sized appetizers.,UNK
12711,"Not happy with the cut and color... Plus I asked for a partial and got full foil, which of course costs more.\n\nI wouldn't recommend this salon. I was in town and took a chance, and it was a mistake. Now I use Yelp for everything! :)",UNK
12712,"I was not happy with my meal.... most of my friends weren't either... although gravy was good . Too expensive , expected better , but I love Paris HOTEL :)",UNK
12713,"good cheap filling meal big ass portions, don't eat before a pool party or you'll be trying to hold your gut in.",UNK
12714,"What a dump. They must have hired all the rejects from McDonald's. EVERYTIME they mess up my order, very rude whenever ordering, they ask for sauce but always forget. Seriously, how hard is your job.",UNK
12715,"We have only been here 30 minutes into Sunday night football game and we have gone through THREE waitresses.  The Manager Jeffrey was very arrogant said that it was normal because they were slow.Boy Bye ,  I have never experienced such horrible customer service and I eat out at least once a week",UNK
12716,Ecasketch bad service. Wrong order. Poor chris ..super hereo sosa to rescue! Dipped chocalate cone check. Lol!,UNK
12717,This basically is a cess pit.  It's awful.  Drunks outside and inside.  Bar staff unfriendly.  I wouldn't take a dog in there.  Please everyone give this a massive body swerve.  I couldn't even finish my pint.  It stinks. Feel I need a wash. Yuk!!,UNK
12718,"The food is good, but no better than any other Mexican restaurant. The prices are ridiculous! $3.50 for one taco. Probably won't be going here again, unless I win the lottery.",UNK
12719,Really a fun place to eat right in the middle of all the hustle and bustle of the Forum Shops. Service was perfect and the food was surprisingly good. Fruita de mare is really nice.,UNK
12720,"Some of the best Thai food I've had in Arizona. I had the Basil Chicken level 4 spicyness which was delish but not spicy enough. Next time I'll try level 5 Thai hot. The chicken satay appetizer was a little dry, but the sauce was great. The service was great as well.",UNK
12721,Tequila that you never heard of or even thought about hearing about.  You want it they have it.  Didn't have the food but the bartender seems to be knowledgable about tequila.  They should because the drinks are pricey.,UNK
12722,"Too bad we can't rate with a 0!  ...A '1' is too generous!  ,,,\""Boooo!\"" to Brewer & McLame!  ...Terry Goddard & Rodney Glassman, ALL THE WAY, here in Arizona!!    :)",UNK
12723,"Not too bad. I had the tortilla soup, and my husband had a mushroom, sausage, and cheese pizza. The tortilla soup was traditional style, and was hearty. The pizza was gone, so assuming it was great. Always a line at this location, so if in a hurry eat at the bar.",UNK
12724,"Delicious! Perfect spot for a laid back brunch with the convenience of multiple options for everyone within the market. I had the steak and eggs, after being undecided on what to get. Did not disappoint. The staff is very welcoming and friendly as well. Highly recommended.",UNK
12725,"delicious, unique, great tapas spot.  Chicken kabob was amazing! Make a reservation or go early because it is a little small.",UNK
12726,"Love Joe's Grotto! Great live music and fun bar scene. Fun little patio area outside. Darts, pool, great drink specials and awesome music. Not too crowded but crowded enough. Joe is there most nights and great fun! Will be back next time in AZ!",UNK
12727,Good for business but not for a family type gathering.  Support staff somewhat robotic...is it not ok to smile?!   Food good and wine list extensive.  Water show outside a nice touch.,UNK
12728,The staff here is great.  Knowledge is key. Smiles are key.  With any doctors office your gonna wait.  Whether u have a appointment or not.  They have a pharmacy on site which is way cool and convenient,UNK
12729,Food is excellent as always. Out of some of the wines too frequently. Ambiance is very good but stop taking my food and drink away until I am done! Seems like they are rushing us out so they can pack more people in. Too bad.,UNK
12730,"I recently started getting my hair done here. The shop is really small and can sometimes get a little crowded on the weekends. Heather does my hair, and she is great! She does a wonderful job with the color/highlights and is VERY quick and reasonably priced. I would definitely recommend her if you decide to visit this salon.",UNK
12731,"Pros: coffee caraffe at table so no waiting for refills. Cons: Mediocre service, terrible commercial food- sent my cold omelette back to kitchen.",UNK
12732,"I've only utilized the UPS drop off here, and nothing else.  Twice I've dropped off stuff, and twice I've gotten my refund, so I think Postalmax of Scottsdale is a-OK!",UNK
12733,angry man working there...we were harassed by angry employee who accused us of taking a picture in the store... I will never step into this store again... I'd rather shop at Urban Outfitters.,UNK
12734,bengning looks good and but the food was avarage. I spent the night in the restroom so no more zupas for me.,UNK
12735,"Beef chow fun, Salt and pepper pork, and the roast duck was delicious. I do not advise of the sweet and sour chicken and the calamari.",UNK
12736,ew don't even bother. I always see a long line here too.\nonly came here because we stayed at ballys and didn't want to migrate far for food.\n\nworst buffett ever.,UNK
12737,"I understand the \""farm fresh concept but 4oz. burger is $3.99, little pricey.  Buns were dry and beef patty wasn't juicy.  WFB special sause was very good.",UNK
12738,Good food.  Best in the area for BBQ.  Really long wait and not the best service.  I wouldn't mind but when its cold there is no space for those waiting. Got yelled at for trying to get a drink from the bar while waiting for a table.,UNK
12739,This is the  is worst pizza place u can go to everythings gross health dept needs to visit this place asap and they say Italian ya rite,UNK
12740,"Food was pretty good, not fantastic.  Music was so loud that a normal conversational tone was not sufficient. Not sure if I'd recommend it, not bad...not great. Go next door and get a pizza.",UNK
12741,final update. We have heard from a number of ppl from the MGM and MLife program.  Mostly through letters and emails.  Although these people apologized and empathized the managers and supervisors that were on duty that night still have not apologized for their behavior towards us.  In the end this is still a fail.,UNK
12742,Better think twice or three times about spending you money in this Bar not friendly or nice I guess your making them do their job and they sure make u feel that way.,UNK
12743,This place is cool and jukebox is great but the bartenders are all facing premature mid-life crisis. The only friendly bartender is the girl whom I wish would be there more often.,UNK
12744,Fresh nigiri was good. The baked rolls had way too much cream cheese; it was overpowering. The rice was overcooked and burnt. The wait was too long and there were not enough sushi chefs working.,UNK
12745,"I have eaten here once before and was very satisfied, but yesterday did a take out order.  I had the pancit and mongo beans.  OMG===horrible. Pancit was ok but mongo beans tasted like soap. Made me gag.  I think Elena's is sooooo much better.",UNK
12746,"Not bad for a Sonoran Dog place outside of Tucson, but nothing compared to real Sonoran dogs down south.\nRest of the menu is good and tasty, but lacks some of the true sonoran flavors.\nBut it is some of the most authentic in the Valley.",UNK
12747,Incredible nachos.  Incredible food. Try their best sellers.  Atmosphere is quaint. Great for a casual date night. Enjoy!,UNK
12748,"Really not my scene.  The staff tries to push the drinks way too hard, trying to mandate 1 drink every half hour and the crowd sucked, unless you like drinking with your grandparents.  Definitely not for the party-animals!!!",UNK
12749,"The feeling of being inside a gigantic chandelier was truly a novel experience, however it wasn't worth the pretentiously pricey drinks. Weak drinks, average service. Boring",UNK
12750,Ok went about a month ago just forgot to review this place first off when I went only one person was working he was the cook and cashier? The food was cold I rather have a mcdouble at McDonald's people over rate this place,UNK
12751,This is a standard American Bistro attempting to appeal to the masses. We took my Mother-in-Law their before the symphony last fall. I like their 3 course menu for early seatings - but it was far from memorable.,UNK
12752,Decent... ok food. Good atmosphere. Long wait when you're at the table if you're there for a game. Otherwise...just an average sports bar with average character and nothing special that really sets them apart.,UNK
12753,"Drinks are $2.50 on Friday nights?!?  Fun bar -- actually, bars. Drag show downstairs, dance music in one upstairs bar, hip hop in the other. Diverse crowd all having a good time.",UNK
12754,"Service Dept needs better management.  Dropped of bike for saddle bag installation & waited 3 days for update on it.  Finally i called them.  After 1 ride of about 60 miles, the bolts were loose! \nOverpriced bikes & poor service dept",UNK
12755,"Started off with a bang. The appetizers were awesome (steak bruschetta and loaded tater tots). The service for our large group was very slow.  Took an hour to get our entrees.  The entrees were just ok.  No one from our group raved about their meal.  Overall, disappointing.",UNK
12756,Very pricey. The food is good and environment is very nice. The servers will be waiting for you right when you need them. I got lamb and it was a good choice.,UNK
12757,Pretty small and filled with geese poop.\nThe water looks dirty.\nStill came here just to take a walk because its the closet to my house.,UNK
12758,The desserts are okay tasting so I would give it a 3. However as the prices are outrageous I would have to lower my rating to a 2.,UNK
12759,"i love the food ..spinach dip , fish tacos and amazing peach and bananna margaritas ....only complaint is service can be poor ....there is a older gentleman who works lunch that does ok but i suggest sitting in the bar area usually the best of the service.",UNK
12760,"what can i say? i doubled my money, got hammered most nights and got to talk to hubert keller in his restaurant and susan feniger in the elevator on the way up to my room. that rocked it for this foodie.",UNK
12761,"I'll be full for the next 6 hours. I don't think I needed chicken, black eyed peas, spinach and Mac and cheese, but I got it. You're southern grandma would make this food and also probably call mac and cheese a veggie, but who cares when it's that good? No one.",UNK
12762,"dont come here if you want decent steak.  come here if you want snobby steak.  which means small overrated portions of food.  the filet mignon was ok, but what i paid for it, NO WAY.  service was really great though, and the food arrived quickly.  crab cakes were the highlight of the meal.",UNK
12763,"Pretty frequent lunch destination when I worked at Gangplank down the street. Love the service and the owners. The food is good but a little pricey. Nice atmosphere and OK for groups if you get there early enough. The restaurant itself isn't too big, but they're happy to push tables together for you!",UNK
12764,"I used to love this Place, but it's going down hill from a Service perspective.\n\nValet Nightmare!!!",UNK
12765,"The food here is awesome and very flavorful!\n\nIf you are looking for a wide selection of Japanese food that is fresh and delicious, look no further!",UNK
12766,"It's always a tradition for me to eat here when I visit Vegas. The food is cheap, like $7 for a good helping of food. There is no cheap Filipino food in Alaska! The food quality is OKAY and the atmosphere is OKAY, but if you're hungry this place will satisfy.",UNK
12767,"I absolutely adore this place. They have a great beer selection, wonderful bar food, solid service and are very reasonably priced. \n\nThe only down side is that they allow smoking everywhere, which can be a problem for some people. Otherwise, it would've gotten five stars!",UNK
12768,"I wish I had better things to say, BUT we won't ever return here. And thats with 25 dollar rooms.\nIt's the smokiest casino that I've walked through in Vegas and left us feeling ill from breathing it in each time we walked to and from our room.",UNK
12769,"While on a pitstop in Vegas, went to the store to look for a panorama head. Unfortunately they had none in the stock, but Steve was very helpful and  provided me information where to get one quickly. I also received good tips for photo locations, very helpful for a foreigner. A+ for customer service!",UNK

12771,"I was there during the 4th of July weekend,  worst buffet In Las Vegas,  $40.00/pp, drinks are extra.",UNK
12772,"Not impressed. A couple of dishes were good (onion soup, flatbread, coconut lime sorbet) - everything else, including service, was very mediocre. Took 1/2 hour to get my first glass of wine. Ceviche was basically guacamole, short ribs were tiny and nothing special.",UNK
12773,"Clean, quick airport to navigate. Lots of places to eat, grab a quick bite before a flight. \n\nClean restrooms and seating was comfortable at the gates.",UNK
12774,"A Wonderful Place made so, not only be truly excellent food, but also by Outstanding Service.  Great Italian dishes with homemade pasta and wonderful sauces.\nWe be back!",UNK
12775,"Can I give no stars? This airport needs to be torn down and rebuilt. It feels like it was designed by some kids on a beach somewhere. It's poorly marked, nothing was open, it was spring break for some but all the vending machines were about empty. Driving into Phoenix would be much better.",UNK
12776,"Wow. Stopped in before a concert and ordered a appetizer platter and a couple of margaritas. I am not exaggerating when I say the apps hit the table in 2 minutes and they were luke warm. The drinks came 6 or 7 minutes later. We drank, we left, we won't be back.",UNK
12777,"The best thing about this Albertsons is that it makes you feel like your life isn't so bad.  The various crackheads, meth addicts and other true Las Vegas characters that seem to inhabit this location make it seem like a tour of what your life could be if you didn't stay away from meth...",UNK
12778,My Grandson loves it says burgers are bigger and better then other fast food places but I find the price you pay for a meal you could go to a restaurant and get full service for the same price or less.,UNK
12779,"This place was awesome! I called them 30 minutes before they closed to see if they had some items, they did and they had them ready for me when I arrived just before closing. It was In and out, and they were very helpful. A little pricey but I guess most vitamin supplements are. Definitely coming back!",UNK
12780,"More spacious than the other Book Gallery, but doesn't have the same quality of books as the other location. Still plenty of books to catch your eye, and the same fair prices. \n\nLots of parking in the public lot behind the store.",UNK
12781,"I'm only giving 2 stars  because the only reason I come here is for the green chicken chile soup and they got rid of it. Plus our server was kinda slow, took other orders while just staring at us. Even tho he was nice.. U need to be a good server too",UNK
12782,The Worst Customer Service Experience in a long time.  Long wait times while giving off lots of attitude while you wait.  Amazed at the consistency of the poor attitude of every single employee in the place.  Do yourself a favor and stay away!,UNK
12783,"Mediocre at best. Not worth the money... Oh and bring your own water because they charge 25 cents for tap water. I know it's only 25 cents, but really?",UNK
12784,"I just don't get how this place is popular. The only redeeming items here are their overpriced guac and overpriced margaritas. All the food is very average, with very little flavor. Do yourself a favor and go pretty much anywhere else in Scottsdale for better options at a lower price.",UNK
12785,Three stars sums this place up. Food is average. Bar is average. The massive amount of TVs is average. I could step outside and head to the sportsbook and maybe my drinks would be cheaper there.,UNK
12786,"This isn't great food, it's simply a place you hit up when you are trashed and need to fill your belly with grub so you can sober up.",UNK
12787,"It's probably one of the better ones around here, but overall it's not that great. The soups, general tso, beef and broccoli are just mediocre. It makes me miss Hot Wok in Ahwahtukee!",UNK
12788,check in line sucks been standing here forever. You'd think they'd at least have all the front desk spots open and working.,UNK
12789,"Well, i'd only come here during happy hour. Good drink menu and a tasty mango martini (wango mango.) I just don't think the sushi is worth the high price when it's not happy hour, sorry my blue friend...",UNK
12790,Called in the service department to request a price quote for lowering springs installation on my prius.  The person I talked to in the service department quoted me $750 just labor cost.  Their own website lists the price for the part and installation at $432.  Either the service staff has no clue what they're doing or it's just a robbery.,UNK
12791,"i dunno bout yall, but i ate here 3x in one weekend and everything delicious. this is the best 24 hour hotel cafe, ever. seriously.",UNK
12792,"Sushi is great here!  The presentation is always impressive.  The service is a bit slow, but friendly.  The atmosphere is so fun!  I love the decor and outstanding music concerts playing on their enormous tv.   The prices are reasonable.  I think this is a date-worthy location.",UNK
12793,"Love carne Asada fries,but when the fries are darn near burnt,it just ruins them.bo quality control when the over cook something.",UNK
12794,Food was bland and uninteresting. Even for cheap Chinese the food was not good. I ended up throwing it all away.,UNK
12795,"Nope not any better this time around. Still hectic, still tons of people. If you have a connecting flight out of CLT - put your running shoes on - because it's a long way from gate to gate and usually you'll have to rush to make your next flight.",UNK
12796,"If I can give 0 stars I would. This is got to be by far the worst IHOP restaurant in the history of all IHOP restaurants. Not only is the food bad and you think they could do breakfast correctly, yuk! And the service by the worst inexperienced staff ever!",UNK
12797,"Great place to get away from the city life and unwind. Beautiful, simple, casual. Great trails for everyone. Not exactly a strenuous hike, but if you jog it, you'll get a great work out. I'll be frequenting North Mountain Park often.",UNK
12798,This place is really cool. They provide amazing tasting tea with decent service. The shop is clean and the products are all laid out very neatly and organized. The employees seemed nice but rather pushy. Overall I did enjoy this place. They could work on there customer service a bit more. I will definitely be going back.,UNK
12799,"Mini golf review: course in bad condition - sunken greens, torn and worn astroturf, gravel on greens, beat up carpet. Pretty crappy. Bathrooms disgusting. There must be something better in area!",UNK
12800,"Solid Sichuan food at the accessible Cofco Center. Everything I've had is good and cheap, with plenty of garlic and ginger. \n\nThe service is about as good as you're going to get in a place like this.",UNK
12801,I Attend a annual Rockabilly Event Viva Las Vegas here its great for this event ! The Ball Rooms Have a lot of Room and Air so you can move and dance about very nicely.\nTom Ingram Hosts this even at this hotel its Great Every Year.,UNK
12802,Meh.... I don't really care for the vibe. It's kinda like an upscale dive bar. It's bland and full of bland people. The food is pretty good and that's why I'm giving it a little credit.,UNK
12803,I was in the mood for breakfast and stopped in.\nI was not disappointed.\nI was seated immediately and was able to promptly place my order.\nEverything came out hot and tasty.,UNK
12804,They would not even bother calling me back about getting a quote. Had to call three times to see what the deal was. Receptionist was very nice but apparently Dennis is a bum. Can't attest to any work since I was apparently not worth calling back.,UNK
12805,"Pizza is the worst I have ever had. Ordered an extra large and got a large. When I called them to tell them all they said was \""sorry\"".  They also charged me $5 more for the pizza then the online price. First time ever having Pappas John's, and it will be my last.",UNK
12806,I went there once with a friend for her birthday.  She was head-over-heels for the place.  I was unenthused.,UNK
12807,Went for dinner the other night.  The salsa bar is the best part of the meal.  We both got the Frito Burrito.  LOTS of filler - rice/beans. Don't know that we'll go back.,UNK
12808,"The food was alright but they are completely disorganized in terms of seating and service. Tables are super small but they clog it with a HUGE basket of milk/creams for coffee.  Costed us around $40 for two people and breakfast, quite expensive.",UNK
12809,"I LOVE this place. I had their Farmers Hash and it was so delicious! The customer service was also really amazing! I wish I could go here more often, but I only travel to Madison a few times a year.",UNK
12810,"Their service was nice, but the quality of bagel wasn't what other reviewers said.  Very disappointed since I am new to Phoenix.  I don't know how other reviewers gave 5 stars.",UNK
12811,After trying curry corner I went on an indian binge. The Dhaba is just as delicious but the service lacked...a smile from the waiter would have made this review 5 stars.,UNK
12812,"Although not my favourite Indian restaurant Sahib is the place we often fall back on because they deliver in Pointe-Claire. The food is fairly good quality and the quantities are good. The \""feast\"" packages are what we usually order and it will feed a good number of people.",UNK
12813,They serve Ellis Island Microbrews!!! Decent eats while in the Las Vegas Airport. The outter bar has outlets. Food was not badly priced for an airport. The microbrews were reasonably priced. Got the burger and fries and it was tasty! Amber microbrew was a great compliment to it!,UNK
12814,"Out of all the thrill rides, this one was the quickest.  The lines were short, the staff were very friendly.  Since I had done so many other thrill rides, this one was very calm by comparison but for the price and the view, I was very happy that I did the ride!",UNK
12815,"Terrible sanitary condition. Daughters burrito had a bit off nail in it and the General Manager had the nerve to say an I quote \""I'm not entirely sure the nail is ours\"". Unbelievable. I will never go to a Dos Gringos again. I will encourage others to do the same!",UNK
12816,"My friend recommended this place.  Bomb.com!  Only bad thing was after realizing how awesome the food looked and smelled, I asked to move to a bit larger table to accommodate all the food that was coming our way.  Overall, still worth small wait.",UNK
12817,Decided to check out Taps for the first with my girlfriend. Immediately upon walking in it was extremely uncomfortable. Everybody stared as we walked in and there was no hostess and no seat your self sign posted.  Couldn't even tell who was an employee or a customer. Eventually receiving no service we walked back out. We will not be back.,UNK
12818,Only open a couple of weeks but not a good experience. Waited over an hour to receive our food. Waitress was nice but had way too many tables. Food was just ok.\nI normally do not write reviews but felt like I should share.,UNK
12819,"They take a while to make the food but they're good. Always order ahead of time before getting there. Otherwise, the tea is superb.",UNK
12820,"Hey folks,\nWe just had an awesome experience at House of Brews (Gilbert). \nGreat Food. And great people.  \n\nT. D.  From Gilbert, AZ",UNK
12821,"I was not impressed. By anything. I will say that now I am more determined to make ceviche at home, which I'm sure will be better.",UNK
12822,"Basic sushi spot, nice setup for decor,  but nothing special. There are too many sushi spots in Charlotte. I went here on a business lunch meeting , I'll have to go back.",UNK
12823,Horrible food very salty and greasy. They forgot one of our orders but the food was so bad we canceled it and left you pay for what you get gross never again,UNK
12824,This is a very trendy restaurant - Gastropub.  The food we enjoyed was quite tasty.  We sat at the bar because it was a busy evening with post college graduation diners filling the place.  The mixologist provided much entertainment.  My only complaint is that they did not have non-alcoholic beer.,UNK
12825,While visiting Phoenix we went downtown to ice skate and have lunch. The Corner was busy however 25 minutes for a sandwich and salad is too long. The food quality was fine but the service was below average,UNK
12826,"Wish I had seen these reviews before going. I will keep it simple. In my opinion this place is a total rip-of as far as the prices charged and the quality/authenticity of the food served. I must say the portions were large, but i guess they have to get rid of the stuff somehow.",UNK
12827,"Really cute furniture and accessories shop in downtown Mesa. \n\nIt's a fun place to stroll around and discover a new scent of candle or a must-have home decor item. The have some nice local artwork, too.",UNK
12828,The lunch buffet at Spice 9 is just wonderful! Each dish was clearly labeled and everything was very fresh and kept fully stocked. It was a nice mix of vegetarian/non vegetarian dishes.  The wait staff was pretty standoffish but I was fine with that.  A huge improvement over the express location uptown.,UNK
12829,"Its unfortunate because the coffee is really good and its a cute atmosphere inside but I always feel like I am bothering the staff when I walk in.  I'm stared at until I do the greeting hello and they seem to unhappily take my order.  After many attempts for better service, I won't return.",UNK
12830,"This restaurant is fabulous! The sushi is great, and priced... within reason. The food is fresh, tasty, and traditional. Would recommend! \nThey also do teriyaki and bento boxes for lunch and dinner. It's (good) Asian to go!",UNK
12831,"The good was TERRIBLE! In addition to that the service was even WORSE! No ice, the food was not cooked properly as well as it took forever for anything to finally make it to our table! We will never return to this particular place AGAIN!",UNK
12832,"I don't recomend this restaurant; poor service, no customer service they don't give you water unless you ask for it, and when about time to pay and were waiting for our change and waiting and waiting they ignore us to give our change until we just left the restaurant. SMH",UNK
12833,The good:\nDecent food\nGood price \nGood drinks\n\nThe bad:\nCompletely disorganized\nMessed up both our orders\nPoorly trained wait staff\n\nI will give this place 4 stars once they get their act together.,UNK
12834,"The green wellness drink was awesome. It took them a while to make it though which I didn't understand because people after me had already received their order. Must've been a mix up. Either way, still a yummy spot.",UNK
12835,"This little take away counter is overlooked  and some people might not even know it exist, but I can't even walk into this Harris Teeter without some hot red curry coming home with me.  It's also really reasonable. There are a few tables if you want to sit inside of the HT.",UNK
12836,I had my first loco moco here. What an awesome dish.\n\nSo close to UNLV and reasonably priced. I will always have a special place in my heart for Aloha Kitchen. Awww.,UNK
12837,"Eh, if you're looking for quick, casual food this is your place. It's really nothing special. It's great if you're with a group of friends and are wandering State Street, but nobody can seem to decide/agree on a place...those are the only times I've stopped here.",UNK
12838,"The food was okay, the cocktails were very good, the waitress was terrific,...but the whole experience was overpowered by flies that relentlessly buzzed about our heads and food (I killed two).  it overlooks the botanical gardens but the interior looks like a remodel/re-purpose job that missed the mark.",UNK
12839,Ultimate calamari was an ultimate fail. Pricey for a mediocre teriyaki spot with a cool name. Manager was rude to a neighboring diner and I think she was the manager because she was the only person not in uniform that was addressing orders.,UNK
12840,"Paid for a car wash, left with damage to the car in a dirty windshield!! Asked the manager Jason Zane for a rewash and he said no way. My car is almost as dirty as it was when I pulled in. \n\nSave Your time and money do not stop at this location!!!!!",UNK
12841,"Its basically a wanna-be fine-dining restaurant/deli open during select hours for the yoga chicks upstairs. The food lunges outside the box, and aims to be a bit pretentious. But honestly its just a rich man's Jimmy John's with better furniture and House music.",UNK
12842,I went there last week it wasn't even busy I waited 15 plus min and no one came to take my order! I had to walk out of this joint   It should be ashamed to be have a location on old town and piss people off and run their business like an amateur little kids! I hope you guys shut down very soon!,UNK
12843,"First time going in the restaurant had a great view of Lake Las Vegas. We we're waiting for our food too long. Unfortunately, one of the orders for our group had hair on it. Yuck! The waitress felt like she didn't even want to be working that day. Unfortunately, I don't think I will be going back.",UNK
12844,"Just went here let me say it was lots of fun , very pact seating wasn't too great, drinks were good make sure you get JOAN he is beyond dreamy, sexy and just BEAUTIFUL you definitely won't regret it!!!!!",UNK
12845,"Rock hard Panini- nasty. They messed up or order a tad but the GM- Rich,was super friendly about it and took care of it. Regardless of who is at fault, being pleasant about it makes a huge difference between \""never again\"" and \""repeat business.\"" But I won't go back",UNK
12846,HATE this walmart. i used to work here for a month and i would never ever ever ever work here again. i drive 10 miles to the walmart on pima and chapperral (spell check) aka the only descent walmart in phoenix (my opinion).,UNK
12847,I walk in and mike the barber wants me to read his fricken manifesto that makes no sense.  I go to a barber shop for peace and quiet maybe a little chit chat.  not to read some bullshit opinion piece that clearly was written by someone in terrible need of an English writing class.,UNK
12848,"This is a cool place to get drinks in the bar with friends, and definitely worth going for dinner!  The pizza is tasty and the specialty cocktails are sheik and delicious!  As a fan of architecture and design, the Parlor has one of the best atmospheres in Phoenix!",UNK
12849,"Paradise Bakery & Wildflower put this place to shame.  I tried to customize my order and it wasn't allowed! Seriously, I wanted to add an item to a sandwich combo and willing to pay for it too, but they couldn't.",UNK
12850,The long line at CPK for a weekend dinner is testament to the triumph  of good location over mediocre food and not very good service by the  frazzled staff.,UNK
12851,"I came back after the renovation, thinking they had improved. Atmosphere, furniture was an improvement. However after they took our order, it took them at least 30 min.to bring ut out, and our orders was not complete. Not coming back....",UNK
12852,"I came here with a large party and the service was on point!  They were very attentive, the food took a while but the restaurant was busy.   The food was very savorful and authentic.  Try it out!",UNK
12853,Ice cold $10 egg sandwich: check.\nIce cold $4 coffee: check.\n\nThis place sucks.,UNK
12854,"This place is terrible. It dirty, the food sucks and the service is terrible. Do not waste your time or money. I came here once before and it had just opened and it was terrible. So I came back 3-5 months later and the food still sucks and now this restaurant is filthy.",UNK
12855,"Went inside with my boyfriend around 10pm on a Thursday and it was a ghost town. Sat ourselves at the bar and waited five minutes. Saw two servers walk into the bathroom but no one greeted us and no bartender appeared, nobody came to talk to us! Left and went somewhere else! RED FLAG.",UNK
12856,The delivery took a hour and half. When we got the food it was horrible! The wonton soup had no seasonings at all and the rest was just as bad !! Will never order again. So disappointed and we spent $50!,UNK
12857,BBQ is not good.  Go to Midwood Smokehouse or Mac's Speed Shop if you want good BBQ in the Charlotte area.,UNK
12858,"And it'll remain an unknown pleasure as it's now currently shut on tue, wed and thurs. Long way to walk to find that out.",UNK
12859,"If you can get past waiting in a long line, the food is worth it! They have many different delicious desserts, and their sandwiches as quite good as well! This is a place you should try at least once!",UNK
12860,"Chicken Andouille Sandwich and Fries. Pretty much as expected. \n\nSausage and peppers were fine, though bun was very stale. Fries were surprisingly tasty with some spicy-ness. \n\nStaff was actually quite friendly.",UNK
12861,"Not only overpriced for too small of a portion (did expect that being in an airport), I did not anticipate the server being completely incompetent and rude! Needless to say, won't be back!",UNK
12862,"Simply put, the sliders taste like mini \""Big Macs,\"" which is just fine with me.  For what I got, I felt the prices could have been a little bit cheaper, but I'm glad that I made the effort to find this literal hole-in-the-wall burger place.",UNK
12863,"It's a nice little place, very friendly staff.  Curteous, and less snutty then buffalo Exchange.  I like it, it feels less trendie, everyone knows it, line buffalo.  It also seems like there stuff is much more high style instead of 80's closet left overs.",UNK
12864,"overall the food was pretty good! be sure to ask for salsa and guac in the burrito, unlike chipotle they dont put inside. the horchata is great!",UNK
12865,I agree with previous review. Butter fish was awful.  Onion rings tasted like cardboard.  Thank goodness it was happy hour prices otherwise we would have let the mgr know how awful the food was.  We will never return!,UNK
12866,"Out on a walk and had to get some ice cream. Only bad part about this place was amount of employees. There were two there, but only one serving on a Saturday afternoon. Line was long but the girl did a great job trying to serve and ring up the prices. Need to fix this management.",UNK
12867,"It wasn't \""A-Ok\"", but I am not a huge fan either. Macaroni grill deserves a little more than an A-okay. It's for sure better than Olive Garden and great for a fast Italian chain. The food was actually decent and reasonably priced.  I will come back again.",UNK
12868,"Long wait for food, waitresses that don't know what they're doing, grumpy hosts, and crappy food that keeps us off the lake for 2 hours is not somewhere I plan on going ever again.",UNK
12869,Well I thought for the price we payed we would've been treated like VIP's but I guess we were just another set of tourists to them. \nWhere they really lack is there service! We waited and waited....and their  Broads were a little annoying rather than helpful! No good,UNK
12870,"Food is great, service was good and the atmosphere is casual and cute. Rolls were fresh and tasty and you can't beat the price for their ayce. I've been here a few times before and I'll definitely return again.",UNK
12871,Located in New York New York Hotel. Slow service but they make a good burger and a tasty bloody mary to cure your hang over. I am a firm believer in NOT bringing your kids to Vegas. Too much Adult stuff to do.,UNK
12872,"This Marshalls is great for dresses and accessories! I loved shopping here, when I lived in Charlotte. They always have a wide variety of dresses and you will always get a good deal. A large portion of my closet is from this Marshalls and everything I've bought from there is still in great shape.",UNK
12873,"We had build your own omelettes. They were great, not too greasy but fluffy and light.  Their hash browns melt in your mouth yet maintain the crispiness.  They also have delicious jalapeno biscuits those were very good also. Overall one of the better breakfasts I have had.",UNK
12874,Terrible service. Very disappointed. I live the beer but if you're not spending money with a group then forget it. Come on. If I'm not getting good service being by myself for a quick beer why would I come back with a group or even another person? The second star is for the good tasting beer I had.,UNK
12875,Not impressed.  Limited menu. I give it two stars because of the healthy menu. It was just very limited and bland. How do you have a gyro place with no lamb?\nHealthy does not equal tasteless.,UNK
12876,"Tried the Strawberry Gorgonzola salad here. Quite sweet as warned by the waitress. Candied pecans were good, but it was a little overdoused in champagne vinaigrette. The outdoor patio was pleasant as was the service and bathrooms. Food was just OK in my book though.",UNK
12877,"Timbers is a step above your average Vegas dive bar overall, but definitely a step below a Sierra Gold or even Pt's.  The food is decent but the bar gets smokey easily making it very difficult to eat late night.\n\nThe restaurant side is good, with fast friendly service.",UNK
12878,The room and bathroom are huge! I love the big bathtub too. \nThe pool area is also amazing because the swimming pool is huge. The drinks were a bit too pricey and the poolside service was slow. I will definitely be staying here for now on though.,UNK
12879,"Got the original gyro. Average at best. Agree with other poster, for a great gyro go to Med. Grill.",UNK
12880,I eat here at least once a week. The food is great and I also love how they've expanded their menu as of late to include dishes. I am a huge fan of their blackened salmon.,UNK
12881,"I was a fan of the original menu at MIMi's. Now that it's all changed out I won't be back. Jalape\u00f1os not available either? You know this is Arizona, right?",UNK
12882,Great choice of toppings but bland beef. Loved the spicy relish and wasabi mayo on the Hawaiian burger.,UNK
12883,"How do you run out of all your brewed teas at dinner time (5pm) on a Saturday? Food was as expected, service was so-so. Looks like the other reviews were right on. This location could be better kept to keep up with the rest of the brand. I won't be going to this location again.",UNK
12884,A little less than mediocre Chinese food but it is what it is. Has some really good lunch and dinner special prices though. Nothing to brag about.,UNK
12885,"As far as salon-cafes go, this has got to be one of the better ones.  The sandwiches, while not particularly ground breaking, are thoughtful and assembled with quality components.  Also has a pretty good old-town ambiance.",UNK
12886,"Terrible! went there for lunch.\nSushi had only rise, I had a hard time finding or tasting the fish. Rise was undercooked. Wasted my time and money. I suggest you Try New Zealand, although their location is not as prime.",UNK
12887,"Outstanding Food. Rib Basket awesome. Prime Rib Wrap great.  Good Beers on Tap. Great Value.\n\nToo many TV's a distraction, but Food and Value make it a must!",UNK
12888,pretty mediocre place.   when you go to a steak place shouldn't the steak be even close to how you ordered it.  not to mention how my wife felt after about two hours. the service was fair to good.,UNK
12889,"The food here is amazing and the atmosphere is so inviting. Every meal I've had here has been fantastic. Love their pomegranate iced tea. The only problem is they can sometimes be a little slow during lunchtime. They need a little bit speedier service for weekday lunch hours. Other than that, everything is wonderful.",UNK
12890,"What a great hotel, the room I had was real nice huge bathroom and shower! Remote curtains also, great nights of sleep even if they was boozed filled! Casino is a little pricey can find cheaper on the strip. Brunch Buffet also very good deal.",UNK
12891,"Have eaten here a few times and each time we enjoyed quality food, great service, and friendly staff! We eat a ton of sushi and they are good at it. Only issue is their pieces are smaller than their competitors (Red Bowl) and price is higher too. Good food and good service, tho! Check them OUT!",UNK
12892,"My favorite is the tropical slushy, light on sugar. I ordered a coconut slush recommended by someone on foursquare. Too rich and milky. Yummy though. I put it in freezer and had a little at a time. Always add boba.",UNK
12893,"I'm sorry to say that I finally left this place. Many of may favorite instructors did as well. It's a ghost town, sad hot steamy place with bad instructors. One value that any business owner should know is to keep your employees happy. Obviously they weren't.",UNK
12894,My second visit was rather disappointing.  I thought he would make a few changes in the show but not so.  I went with a group and we all decided that Anthony Cools show is better.,UNK
12895,One of the most disappointing pizzas I have ever had. They tried to over Foo Foo pizza and the flavors just didn't work for me. I should have known to keep walking when they have a GIANT Blue Moon sign in the window and the server tells us they don't serve Blue Moon... Huh?,UNK
12896,I've been to other churrascaria. This is one of the better ones. We went there kind of late. Everything was very good. I only wish my tummy was bigger so I can eat more. Service was excellent!,UNK
12897,Food was good and waitress was friendly but we waited almost an hour for our food. And to top it off the parking lot was so crowded our car got towed. Won't be back again,UNK
12898,I have had nothing but problems with this post office.  They fail to hold or forward my mail when requested unless I notify my mail carrier personally.  Staff is rude and unfriendly.  Horrible to deal with.,UNK
12899,"Just went here today for the first time.  Nice, clean, well lit, spacious dining experience.  Bloody Mary was good, and the pesto pasta was tasty and very fresh.  Also, nice clean personal restrooms, with nice scented soap!  Thanks!",UNK
12900,I liked the food here.  Got some enchiladas with a side of margarita.  Nothing really good or bad to report.  Service was fine.,UNK
12901,"Waited 20 mins for my turn. New guy comes in, waits 10 mins and is invited ahead of me. Hate when that happens.\n\nPlace looks nice and everything, but won't visit as they don't care about this basic thing.",UNK
12902,"Good quality food and great help for the business guy on the go.  Phone order for 2 dozen bagels, in and out, no stress.  They always come through.",UNK
12903,"I walked in and the place looked really nice, honestly. Front desk was super helpful, really nice and charming. Management, however, seemed unorganized and lazy. There was an odd atmosphere. I ended up leaving.",UNK
12904,I picked up a couple of pies for a kickback and it was good.  I struggle to find good Pizza and good Chinese in Phoenix but this is pretty good.  We also picked up a Caesar salad which was sub-par.,UNK
12905,"They always have some really nice things in stock, although the bags can be a bit more pricey than other places. However it is definitely one of the nicer vintage stores in Montreal as it is clean and the selection is usually good.",UNK
12906,They charged me $1275 for a part that retails for $600.  And why am I thinking it was a used part at that?,UNK
12907,"Compared to other FatBurgers I've been to, this one is lackluster.  Despite being a chain, the burgers here are not as tasty for some reason, maybe due to cooking technique?  The shakes are more watery than thick, and employees are generally disinterested and indifferent.",UNK
12908,"Its Domino's. The service was on-time, and very friendly. But, it's just Domino's, so the pizza was basic and served the need for a house full of last minute guests.",UNK
12909,"I was shocked at the low sticker price at their burgers. Their triple burger is like $4.99, but was it good? You can make an arguement that in-n-out is better, so I guess you get what you pay for. Cheap burgers, cheap taste. Not worth trying.",UNK
12910,"2.5\n\nGood for people watching, but pretty touristy. We knew this, we just wanted some place where we could sit and enjoy a few snacks and drinks. Would I go here again? Nah! No need to since there are so many other places on the rue.",UNK
12911,I had a great time here. Lost my money on a Ladybug penny machine and had some drinks. If you like casinos you will like it if you don't like them then you won't like it. The place is beautiful and overlooks the water.,UNK
12912,I liked this place as it had some nice cookies and drinks that I didn't see at other United Clubs.  It is small but very relaxing and I appreciated the amenities here.  Nice to have this club at the Phoenix hub.,UNK
12913,its frozen yogurt !!!! what can be wrong..awesome flavors here and very clean.. the peanut butter yogurt was out of this world! and low fat...,UNK
12914,"Worst customer service ever. I live in Optima, and want to love this place, but it is truly dreadful. Don't set yourself up for failure, go somewhere else.",UNK
12915,"Food is not worth the price,  eggs were dry, chorizo dry and no flavor, I could have made pancakes at my house and they would have tasted better,  all the glasses were dirty, and lipstick stanied, the coffee was good and the waitress was great, the food was just not worth the price and will not go again.",UNK
12916,"Free toppings on tuesday and the specials continue for each day of the week.\nI think I am going to keep this place for the kids.  Neon colored frozen yogurt was totally up their alley. While I give them kuddos for keeping little people happy, I would rather have something without all the coloring.",UNK
12917,"I went here for lunch a couple of months ago. The service was not very impressive,  tables were wobbling and diner looks outdated. I wasn't impress with the food either, very bland! Somehow it took me over 30 minutes to get my food.",UNK
12918,Great place for a happy hour glass of wine.  Outside seating has a nice view of the lake.  The pizza shop next door will deliver to your table.,UNK
12919,"Tons of cute Hooter's girls, but I've been there twice since moving to Champaign and it seems like their wings consistently lack any crunch, even soggy. Everything tastes fine, just missing some texture.",UNK
12920,"Water, pooper-scoopers, and lots of room to roam.\n\nThe Shawnee Bark Park also includes a fun obstacle course.",UNK
12921,Done here!  Stop the high-pressure sales tactics.  Telling me that using non- synthetic oil will void my manufacturer warranty is a complete lie!  Never again will I patronize this intentionally dishonest company!,UNK
12922,"it is not worth the money.  nothing special about the show, if i can give no start, i'd give no star.  there's absolutely nothing to rave about.",UNK
12923,"Like it, don't love it. Mostly like it cause it's down the street.... Food kinda all tastes the same. The waitresses have always been nice and owner is always around making sure your table is doing good. Good for kids because it's never too quiet.",UNK
12924,"Great new building, same sh*t service and food. Go there for drinks but not if you're hungry. 'Nough said.",UNK
12925,Close to a philly steak but just not the same. It was rather small for the price of the sub. Just writing about this makes we want to go back to Philly and grab myself a Tony Luke's! i like the cheesesteak place inside the sinclair station on patrick and pecos as it had much more flavor,UNK
12926,"My family had the Brooklyner, sliders, and soup.  All the food was excellent.  A bit on the pricey side for a sandwich place but I will return since I love New York Pastrami on rye.  It was served warm like a NY deli too.",UNK
12927,It was fine.Typical outdoor Mexican place.Niceview of the strip from the upper bar where we sat.It was hot out that day and I was tired so maybe I wasn't enthused enough to enjoy it.Friendly folks and the Jager girls were out that day giving away free stuff if you bought a Jager shot.,UNK
12928,"Poor experience, tuna roll is a rip off for 6.50. Even if you request for canceling the order they wont accommodate. Thanks for an awful birthday experience.",UNK
12929,"Great food even better ambiance. If the menu was more diverse, especially the dessert portion, this review would be even better. Will be coming back to Bandera again for sure.",UNK
12930,"This event was horrible. Lines, lines, lines. Has anyone been successful in getting their money back?? Ticketmaster won't budge.",UNK
12931,Great place to eat/order to go a quick shawarma. Its a family owned restaurant and the food clearly shows that. I like it!,UNK
12932,Too packed with college kids and too much of a sweat box. I would rather spend my time somewhere else and save up to hit the clubs in Vegas. This was a disappointment and I was expecting more from Scottsdale. Only good thing was a bartender who kept giving me free drinks!,UNK
12933,"Great little cream shop! Stopped in for desert one night on a whim and was not disappointed! Friendly people, and salted caramel ice cream, so delish!",UNK
12934,"Never even knew this post office existed, but found myself here to mail an international envelope.  Quick and easy with the Automated Postal Center.  There's a Public Storage next door... wish I got a storage unit there plus a PO Box here.  Would've been convenient!",UNK
12935,"wasnt busy at all, but took 10 minutes to make an iced carmel latte, not as friendly as the others, and the mark up of it being on the strip is sad.",UNK
12936,Terrible. The General Tsao's chicken was clearly a reheated leftover from the prior night. The mystery meat in the BBQ pork dish was indigestible. The only decent item was the crab Rangoon. First and last time ordering from here.,UNK
12937,"After my nightmare of eating at a Paris Buffet, I was relieved to find this buffet. A huge selection I enjoyed the noodle bar and fresh veggies. So many choices.",UNK
12938,"The breakfast is suitable. The pool is adequate. Nothing really wowed me.\n\nOh, one thing that sucked was that they allowed someone else in my party to change information on our reservation when the reservation was on MY card.  AKA WITHOUT my permission. So, that was pretty sweet.",UNK
12939,Everyone loves Santans! This brewery produces some wonderful beer (although watch the hang over in the morning if you drink too many of them!) and has awesome bar food (beer bread/batter anyone!?) They usually have live music on Friday or Saturday and it gets pretty crowded - it's always a good time!,UNK
12940,"I just can't seem to win in this place even with outrageous amounts of luck and skill. Rigged I tell you, rigged.\n\nNext time I'm betting on the house or going back to the Palazzo.",UNK
12941,Went on a Friday afternoon and waited 45 minutes in line with 1 cashier working.  Someone was being trained behind the counter and the trainer was very rude when approached by multiple customers about opening another window.  The only reason why I'm even giving 2 stars is because the woman who actually helped was extremely helpful and kind.,UNK
12942,I love the food and do most of my shopping at fresh and easy. However this store smells soo bad when you walk in. I prefer driving to another one then shopping at this location. Why can't this be fixed.,UNK
12943,Great Food and Fun. We tried them when they were at Carefree Brix Wine Bar. Had never done a food truck before and the lamb with salad was really great. Looking forward to seeing them again in Cave Creek.,UNK
12944,No happy hour or 15% discount from hotel because it was a Coyotes game day.\nHerb Crusted Chicken was over cooked so it was dry but at least the baked potato was ok. Service was good she kept my drink filled.,UNK
12945,Must try the pork ramen!  The broth is out of this world.  Was not a fan of the pancake...too fishy for me.  Great atmosphere.  The sake nigori and the blueberry mojitos were delicious.  I'm going to introduce everyone I know to this place!,UNK
12946,"Great mussels, which is their specialty. Nice little restaurant for an intimate dinner that isn't dressy and all about the food!",UNK
12947,"You won't find Franco American here.  Just simple, rustic, and flavorful recipes from the old country.  No heavy sauces, the flavor comes from simple preparation and quality ingredients.",UNK
12948,"Had more the 25 minutes left before they close, and right off the top was told to take out instead of sitting, I am posting this, so the owners know what there employees r doing",UNK
12949,"Had the Mongolian beef, it wasn't even average. Can't believe we paid $15 for a entree I always thought was hard to do wrong. Pho was average. Atmosphere's nice if you're out for a good time. This is basically a food court, great variety.",UNK
12950,"05.09.13 Cafe mit Stra\u00dfenbewirtung.\nSchneller freundlicher Service, gute Caf\u00e9, sehr gute Kuchen",UNK
12951,Waited about 3 hours in  four Thanksgiving buffet food here. Was it worth waiting that long? No. The food was alright for the most part. I did eat a lot though since it wasnt that bad. The desert section was the best part. Yay for food coma.,UNK
12952,Service was so slow/nonexistent that we left after 15 minutes and a server still hadn't stopped by even though they weren't busy. I would rate the night staff negative stars.,UNK
12953,I've stayed at the Luxor for over a month in the pyramid. It is one of the coolest hotels and every experience was great.,UNK
12954,Pizza here is decent but a bit overpriced. And counter service has sucked sometimes. \n\nThey do have good lunch specials. I tried a slice of their white pizza for lunch and it was really yummy.,UNK
12955,WAY overpriced!  Great view and friendly staff but food is out of this world expensive!!  Drinks are as well!  That is why you have to take an elevator up so you don't run away screaming when you see the prices.  Food = above average.,UNK
12956,"I've been taking my vehicles here since 2008. No complaints. Love the shuttle service. Free coffee, coffee, & wifi if you want to wait. Friendly and proffessional staff. Clean bathrooms",UNK
12957,"No Rating!  Terrible job, nails polish came off my toes the next day.  Came back to have  Lui re-polish, she was not very happy to see me and made me wait 20 minutes.  Lui re used the foam toe separator!  Will never go back, very dirty my right toe is infected!",UNK
12958,I tried this place after seeing it in the loafer so many times with rave reviews. I enjoyed my burger and fries although my guest didn't so much. I will note that they DO NOT have air conditioning. I was melting...,UNK
12959,Went here and only stayed for two beers. Had a funny smell to it that didnt seem to go away. They had a bunch of weird $1 beer that we all considered trying but wussed out.,UNK
12960,"Priceline had this resort as 4 star but it looks and  feels like 3.\nThe employees are nice, though. WiFi 13$/24hrs.\nGrounds are nice.",UNK
12961,"Slow service, staff needs more training. There's like 4 managers and none of the know what they are doing, i don't think this place is going to make it. Sorry but you lost 4 very good patrons Saturday night because of your poor customer service",UNK
12962,It looks and feels like a great coffee shop with a great menu and decent selection of  beers.  Great atmosphere and a friendly staff.  Free WiFi.,UNK
12963,"Just to let everyone know, Namaste Indian Restaurant has moved (January 2013) from it's old location in the Banksville Plaza to 1150 Banksville Rd, adjacent to The Days Inn. I've notified Yelp.",UNK
12964,"Nice place in the old port,  but to me the unfriendly waitress ruins everything (the blonde girl behind the bar). No smile at all... you almost feel that you disturbed her. .. unfortunately,  there's nothing there that makes me wanna come back, especially with the overpriced drinks.",UNK
12965,"Average at best. Eye is off the ball.  Average food.  Weak service.  Too many other better choices.  I knew I should have questioned this place as I came from the covered parking section and noticed trash and boxes were left out by the wood pile.  I almost didn't go in for that reason, now I regret that I did.",UNK
12966,place sucks.... if you want to pay $20 for a small burger and fries then come here. way to expensive for  a simple burger.,UNK
12967,Didn't even get to eat.waited to be helped no one would seat us.After 5 min someone finally told us it would be 15 min before they could seat us then made us put our name on a waiting list after people who had just come in were put on the waiting list before us. Not impressed with the service and just decided to leave.,UNK
12968,"Fun and spontaneity are sucked from you right at the door.  This should have been a fun girls night out...we were in fact on the guest list and comped at the door.  The scene is without class, the staff is crass and after what I saw and experienced, you couldn't pay me to go here again.",UNK
12969,"Great drinks, great view. Disappointing service all around. What's with the patio servers and the non-existent bar-tender? Can not believe that a place like this does not welcome you when you sit down, offer you drinks and service the second you walk in.",UNK
12970,"Besides the fact that this place has awesome interior design and an amazing and authentic menu, they have half liter Mexican Cokes. Nothing beats a Mexican Coke.",UNK
12971,"Perfect place for a romantic night out or to listen to live music on a Friday or Saturday night or if you enjoy an extensive wine list.  A lot of people really like Arooji's.  As far as the food, I think it's mediocre for the price.",UNK
12972,Always fresh produce and their seafood section ROCKS!  The meat section usually always has what I need as well.  They have a pretty great checkout system so I've never had to wait more than 1-2 people deep.  I love this Smith's.,UNK
12973,I feel that this place is very overrated.  The wait is ridiculous if you try going for dinner and I think the food is so-so.  I would prefer to go to Cibo over Pizzeria Bianco.,UNK
12974,My husband and I came here for an early dinner. Service very slow and the wait staff walk around like zombies. Food just ok and overpriced. I would not recommend this place.,UNK
12975,"I ordered the chicken parm slider. Mmmm, it was ohhkay. The crispy chicken wings were tasty! I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again. Our server was very nice though",UNK

12977,"I would have rather starved than gotten sick from the \""gluten free\"" options they offered. Clearly they weren't. Save yourself.",UNK
12978,"I love this place, but the line situation is out of control. It's dreadful. There's not enough cashiers and there was like 15 people in line waiting.  They gotta figure this out better.",UNK
12979,"I'm always impressed with the staff here. There could be five people or 30 people in line and they just move it along. Nice!\n\nI like the bagel sandwiches... both breakfast and lunch. But really, the garden veggie cream cheese is the BEST!!! Love the fresh bagels :)",UNK
12980,"Love the look and feel of the place but I've eaten better food. Came here for breakfast and it was alright, nothing great. The service here was fantastic.",UNK
12981,"I believe they are the best of the rotisserie types of restaurant. The salad bar is a great addition to roasted chicken, good customer service and very reasonable price",UNK
12982,"Food was horrible.  Way overpriced.  Not recommended at all!   Pad thai noodles extremely dry, chicken tasted reused.  Steer clear!!",UNK
12983,"Rooftop deck! What else is there to say? The service was good, the signature drinks were yummy, the venue was awesome.\n\n-1 star for the high prices and no happy hour.",UNK
12984,Worst restaurant that I ever eat in LV!!!   They have the worst service and you can't choose the amount of tip!!!   Do not come !!!,UNK
12985,Definitely a good place for breakfast!! Very good potatoes would go here just for the potatoes. But very bad that they dont accept card and just accept cash. I want to go many times but I stop myelf just because I dont keep cash so much :(,UNK
12986,"We had a very nice meal here last night. The curries were pretty authentic and carried enough spice to make them very tasty. Unusual location but it wasn't hard to find. Good service, though we were only ones there when we finished at 8pm.",UNK
12987,The sushi quality is ok. it's near my house and during happy hour it is pretty good value for healthy food. it's definitely a college crowd.,UNK
12988,I've ordered pick carry out from here multiple times but today I decided to stay and eat. For some reason the food didn't seem as great. The service was a little lacking and there was a but of disconnect between the waiter and us. I think I might just stick to ordering to go.,UNK
12989,uhm i get that im in vegas and things cost more...but ROFL WOW. theres a reasonable point in paying for something. \n\nto be dramatic...its like paying 10$ for a piece of gum.,UNK
12990,"Greasy spoon in Belmont! Quick, cheap, and tasty :)  The type of place with loyal regulars.  Great country ham and eggs.  No muss, no fuss, just how a breakfast spot like this should be!",UNK
12991,Delicious food from a local place. The staff are friendly and the portions are huge. Highly recommend if you have a hankering for chinese food at a good price.,UNK
12992,"This place has the worst service of any bar I'm currently in.  20 minutes in, nary a waitress.   Then they finally bring my girl the wrong drink.  I am, however unimpressed with the staff here, quite happy with the gent next to me... My father.  He also thinks it sucks here btw.",UNK
12993,"Quick and easy stop...\nSometimes helpful, sometime not...\nRuns-out of produce...",UNK
12994,So so so slow.  Been in drive thru for 30 minutes.  With two cars in front of me.  Avoid this place at all costs if you are in a hurry.,UNK
12995,I hate this place. Every single time I go here they either get my order wrong or forget something. The staff is full of teens that have no care in the world. \nIf you must come here make sure you triple check your order.,UNK
12996,"Unless you have kids and low standards, I'd stay away from this show. The show wasn't very good compared to other Vegas shows, and the server refused to give us water to drink. He said Pepsi was all they had. The food isn't very good either. Very dry chicken. The tomato soup was alright.",UNK
12997,be prepared for over seasoned and over cooked lobster..... Watery lobster bisque and flavorless bread. 40$ of nothing. Totally disappointed. Who puts oregano in a lobster roll?,UNK
12998,"This place sucks.  No customer service skills, just a bunch of monkeys getting in your face hustling you.   One individual named bernard got in my face for no apparent reason.    No professionals here thats for sure.   Discount tire on the other hand are always there for ya.   And friendly.",UNK
12999,"Ok but not great. Expensive considering. The beet salad was great, but The bread was hard as a rock. The wine was good, and the service was good. Unfortunately the main course was nothing special and quite a tiny portion. I'm not sure I will go back any time soon.",UNK
13000,"Paid $7 for a two second pour on a well gin and tonic, bar tender was nice but main focus was his cell phone. I don't eat dairy so my only sauce option was BBQ for pickle chips. No marinara or honey mustard or anything..",UNK
13001,Four of us came here for drinks on our girls night. The were great tasting! A bit pricey but we knew what we were getting into. Didn't try the food but it looked delicious! I would go back to try the food. Michael was our waiter & he was awesome & made our experience fun.,UNK
13002,The food is ok. Not worth the price. Portions are very small. Did not feel like I got my money's worth. Service was friendly but slow.,UNK
13003,"This place reminds me of what Goodwill used to be although I daresay they have better stuff.  The \""home\"" section is rather junky but they have a ton of clothes priced very reasonable.  And not all uber faded shirts with bleach spots either.  Check it out!",UNK
13004,"Pepsi!!! And regular Pepsi was not available! Worst hot dog ever. 7 Eleven hot fog is better. Tasteless fries. If you must eat there,burger is ok. I won't be back.not even with the half off groupon....",UNK
13005,Well although quite tasty I must admit dirt is a part of the decor. The wait staff were not rude just cold. Probably better places to go!,UNK
13006,California has much better vermicelli. The fish oil had no flavor. The grilled pork wasn't seasoned like it should and the vermicelli not good.,UNK
13007,"30 minute line for the to go window, a $14 frozen hot chocolate from a powder mix. Meh. Tasty but not worth the money or wait. I like the frozen chocolate drink from Godiva better n for a third or the price.",UNK
13008,This place is worth all the hype it is a great sandwich for a good price. It just sucks its IN the planet hollywood i wish it was off the strip.,UNK
13009,"Food was just o.k. Had the ocean perch , the dessert that came with dinner for free was rice pudding.it was watery,like it had been sitting there for a long while.Iv'e had better.",UNK
13010,"I dont why this place has 2.5 stars.. great food, great staff and it's Red Frigging Robin!.  I found a new love for the original burger with the relish.. yummm...",UNK
13011,This Starbucks has a walk-up window and it's awesome and fast. The barista asked me if I wanted my banana nut bread warm and it tastes so much better that way. The lines in the drive thru are pretty long in the morning but the wait time is fairly short. Overall great attitude and good service.,UNK
13012,Your food service sucks and. Your personal can't do anything to. Help me.....  Really....   Wow..,UNK
13013,"Pricey cupcakes, beyond underwhelming.There wasn't much out, so ordered a simple chocolate cupcake and they couldn't even get that right. I've baked better at home.",UNK
13014,I ordered the cheese chicken and found a piece of the plastic bag cooked in with my chicken. I didn't find the bag until I had eaten half of the chicken. They got one star because I had to give at least one.,UNK
13015,"The first Filipino establishment I visited in Las Vegas.  Nothing particular stands out at this place. If you've been to a Filipino Restaurant/Karaoke place before, you'd find the same things here. \n\nThe food was ok...and the service was prompt. It was pretty dead for a Thursday night though.",UNK
13016,People were very friendly. Not much on the menu but hey why not keep it simple. The chicken is crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. What will keep calling me back is the cane sauce and Texas toast.,UNK
13017,"The lay-out of the place is cool. The menu is nice, and good beer selection. However, service was SO slow.  Not any place I'd get too excited about going back to.",UNK
13018,I love love love this place! I went in there to get a bunch of macaroons I tried pretty much all of the different flavors and not one disappointed!! I would recommend this to anyone looking for delicious and very reasonably priced macaroons.,UNK
13019,"Absolutely disgusting!  Would never go back, food terrible, service rude, can't imagine there are enough tourists to keep this place open for much longer.  Stay far far away!!",UNK
13020,"Place is hippie, almost too much so.  The dining room and bathroom need cleaning. Otherwise the juices are tasty and made fresh, there is also amazing art on the walls.",UNK
13021,Went in for lunch and had a really good cheese and bacon burger. Love the Frankenstein theme with Bride of Frankenstein playing on the big screens,UNK
13022,"I don't see why this place gets such great reviews... maybe because it is cheap?\n\nThe food is OK, not great and they don't give you much inside the bread.",UNK
13023,"Saw the baxcon and cheese commercial and thought I better get one of those. Big mistake. Where's the bacon and cheese that's supposed to be in the crust? Mine just had air in it, what a letdown. I'll call someone else next time",UNK
13024,"I wish they had a fridge in the standard room. And I'm lazy to walk the strip and through their long casino before getting to the hotel part. Other than that, everything was just like any standard Vegas hotel room.",UNK
13025,I'm giving the place three stars as an average of all the times that I've been here. Sometimes the place is a two star mess (like when Fergie hosted NYE and couldn't count) but other times it's been a lot of fun (my most recent visit in December was pretty decent).,UNK
13026,"Late night munchies after you hit the clubs? This is the place to be! Along with the good food, there is also an annex type kareoke bar you can enjoy after the food! Please do not come in intoxicated and annoying though, because you will get kicked out!! No soliciting please!",UNK
13027,"The blood Mary was ok, but the bar tender didn't get the memo about \""the friendliest airport\""!  Sorry we gave you any biz!",UNK
13028,"The wait time is horrible , being close to the strip doesn't help but it is unreal. The urgent care  is under staff and from what it seems overwork . On the plus side it is clean  but there is no plus given for the time you lose.",UNK
13029,This dairy queen is always clean and they have a good  2 for 1 special every day. Mondays is the Oreo Brownie Earthquake which is yum. I normally get a chocolate cone or blizzard and it is always good. They are really patient with my 5 year old as he likes to order and pay on his own:),UNK
13030,"the sunshine roll is a must! a seriously stellar roll.  the octopus and hamachi belly sashimi were just as good. avoid the Hama Kama, yellowtail collar deep fried, it's weird and too much work.",UNK
13031,"The Matisse of chocolate, Pastry Chef Jean Phillippe Maury has a new gallery for his edible works of art  at the Aria. \n\nAesthetic enthusiasts will give high marks for the chocolate artworks and very pretty cakes; but foodies will find its cafe offerings (e.g. crepes) less than meeting expectations.",UNK
13032,"Nice atmosphere. Great patio for outdoor dining.\nThe most standout dish of the night was the soup.\nPasta e Fasioli- it was delicious. Well balanced, hearty, great flavor.\nThey have a fairly large menu for a small Trattoria, and the prices are fair.",UNK
13033,"This place feels like it is on its last legs. They don't have wait staff, and the place feels run down. I had a shrimp tempura roll, and the shrimp was cold and soggy. The poke was OK, but the rice was mushy.",UNK
13034,Do not use this company!  Bought a living social deal that seems like a scam as I have called 7 times to try and book with no returned call . If you too bought the deal file a complaint with living social ASAP.,UNK
13035,"It's a Shell Station. What do you expect? There's always somebody there. They know where all 30 items are. I've never had a BAD experience at this location, but I've never had my mind blown, either",UNK
13036,"I've been going here for more than a year . Their buffalo chicken dip was great, then it was really bad, and now, its amazing! (No lie, it's way better than it ever was.) The beer is still so so but I recommend this location. It's better than most neighboring bars.",UNK
13037,Went on a Thursday and the service was excellent. The food however was high priced but not very tasty. The bang bang shrimp just had too much sauce. Everything else was just bland. In my opinion it's just not worth the price.,UNK
13038,"Very good quality, not crowded, service was good and $27 for dinner seems reasonable. Only reason I didnt give it 5 stars is the dessert bar wasnt that great.",UNK
13039,"Ugh. I love Filbertos cheap, tasty food but I hate the service! I called earlier today to see if they could deliver. A girl picked up, said \""hold on\"" and hung up. Then I called back several times and nobody answered. Pretty obvious they were dodging my calls.",UNK
13040,"I have since moved on to bigger and better establishments. My opinion was clouded over by my five foot lover's insistence that I not \""waste\"" money....sayonara, GC.",UNK
13041,"The studio is really new and awesome. Lots of new fresh instructors who do great warm-ups, exercising , and cool downs. The classes were well priced and they played great music!",UNK
13042,"Just say \""NO!\"" to this store. It is filthy and smells. It looks like a Government Surplus store and the prices are not all that great. 1 star is too generous.",UNK
13043,Decent Pizza and bread sticks. Glad to know of a place with root beer in Charlotte. Went when moving a friend to Chicago. Took about 30 minutes to get the pop we spilled cleaned up though we did move tables. That was weird!,UNK
13044,3 stars is gracious.  Service was okay gal behind the counter could have had better customer skills and they were out of basic toppings. We will try a different location.,UNK
13045,I wrote a review 3 months ago about the Jura Capresso j9 and again the machine broke down.  Save yourself the money and frustration and go to Starbucks.  Great coffee during the short time its working but its in the shop again.  Not worth it and Sur La Table does nothing to back it up.,UNK
13046,Rooms are somewhat tired however it is handy for the airport. Not anything within walking distance but bus stop is close by and parking was free,UNK
13047,Total disappointment. They were out of many flavors...they did not explain any kind of ice cream process like the rest of the reviews did. My girlfriends and I walked a mile from downtown in midday and were totally disappointed.,UNK
13048,"Great buffet for a good price! At breakfast, they have both an omelette and a crepe station. Their selection of food is very nice, at a better price than most of the other buffets on the strip. The line isn't too long, and stays the same during breakfast to dinner.",UNK
13049,"Nice people and clean. But another car shop ripped me off for oil filter change, air filter change and brake fluid exchange 100+ for parts and $200+ for labor....?! Totaled $400+. :(",UNK
13050,I don't know how this place got 3 star average.  The place is a wannabe hooters.  Bad service and even worse food.  Just stay away !!!!!,UNK
13051,"Hello friends,\n\nSmells like Auto Bell in the lobby.Lol.. Free wash with oil change, and vacuum. Usually takes about 10-15minutes for your regular oil change. The guys there are young and pretty nice. I have no complaints.\n\nTTFN",UNK
13052,"Food is tastey and consistent.  The chips and queso dip are great.  Service is fine.  \n\nIf it's nice, do yourself a favor and sit outside and watch people going to and from...  great people watching.\n\nWe go here at least once a week.",UNK
13053,"Decent doughnuts, coffee is strong as hell! I drank one and a half cups and was up all of the following night! :-)",UNK
13054,"Unless you like heavy country music, alot of gamblers, and heavy smoke this is your place. However the bartenders are great and very knowledgeable.\nFYI: the No Smoking signs are just for show.",UNK
13055,Great asparagus split pea Parmesan soup! Cesar salad had a bit too much dressing. But chicken on it was perfect!,UNK
13056,"Dim sum and pizza - strangest combo but this place is a favorite of mine.  Drinks are on point.  Hipster vibes but the lighting and atmosphere are so great, who cares?",UNK
13057,"Not a great place for chicken. Fried was bland, mac and cheese tasteless, grilled strips were OK. Great service and ambience, but as a restaurant, not phenomenal overall.",UNK
13058,"If you go you can say, \""Been there, done that\"". Then you can move on with your life.  The best part, it's free",UNK
13059,I've  been here a few times and the food is consistently good. Great lunch specials. Nice portions. Can't  go wrong eating  here.,UNK
13060,"We ordered a NY steak and an omelette. The steak was too well done, and as tasteless as the omelette. Very weak food and not worth the price. Good music and good ambiance, so it may be good for drinks.",UNK
13061,"Cute place. The service was very good, really nice friendly waitress. The food was good. I had fish tacos, they were tasty. My husband's ribs were very good. My daughter tried the buffalo chicken salad and she really liked it. I would absolutely go here again.",UNK
13062,Worst sandwich place in the world. My chicken was undercooked and was mostly fat. I asked for light mayo and mustard twice and they seemed to ignore the request  because my sandwich was 80% mayo and mustard. I ended up trashing pretty much the entire sub and as a consequence my money...Never again!!!,UNK
13063,"Super good Chicken Pad Thai! Huge portion for a cheap price. Go there about twice a month for the same exact thing!\n\nThe food is good for about a 20 minute window however, don't try and bring this home...",UNK
13064,"Not bad, but a little pricier than other kabob places. Loved the spinach and squash side dishes. Overall, good if you don't have time to drive to another kabob place and have to have it now, but not my first choice. Naan is terrific!",UNK
13065,"The place smells wonderful.  The selection runs to mostly white flour breads and a few sweet items.  The bagels are decent--not water bagels, but there doesn't seem to be anywhere in Vegas that makes REAL bagels.",UNK
13066,"I had the Sirloin and it was just \""okay\"" ... \n\nThe place itself is about a generic as you can get. The service. I see a lot have problems with it but we had no issues.",UNK
13067,"I can only speak of the bar scene, and not of the food.  It was a good time!  Wish they had been playing better music, however.",UNK
13068,Roast beef and Gorgonzola sandwich was okay... Hard to mess up. The soup I had and the soup my friend had were both cold and gross.,UNK
13069,"One star, zero if there was a zero rating! Walnut shrimp was terrible! Hair in my beef wanton noodles and service wasnt that great either, definitely not coming back",UNK
13070,"I used to love their cakes, but lately the cakes just full of very sweet cream. Just disappointed with my last 3 purchased of chocolate cake, carrot cake and black forest cake.",UNK
13071,"The wait was RIDICULOUS.  We purchased our tickets at 12pm for a time slot of 9pm.  We got there at 9 and didn't get to ride until 10:30.  The ride was super fun, and I would give 5 stars, but the wait really made me ill.  \n\nB+",UNK
13072,Thumbs down!  Low quality overpriced food.  Can't say much about the service everybody else got but my waitress disappeared every 15 minutes.  Total time wasted from beginning to end of my meal for two people was 70 minutes.  Too long for a burger and chicken sandwich.  Nothing special here.  Will not return.,UNK
13073,"Great quality gas!! Always nice to get a little Techron in the tank, to give it a nice cleaning. Helps my V8 run smoother too. That's for sure!!",UNK
13074,"I know, I know its airport food. We'll the food was just bad, and that's all I really have to say about that.",UNK
13075,The food is okay. Not something I crave for let alone want to go to with so many other choices around. It's food is average at best.,UNK
13076,"Eh...If in Tempe, go to Khai Hoan for Vietnamese. The only thing this place has is it's late night hours (open until 2a on weekend).",UNK
13077,stopped by sunday 8am\ncrowded but no wait yet\nwaitress friendly/attentive\nfood spectacular\nbanana muffin was tasty,UNK
13078,"The food was great, but I could get the same food and quality at other restaurants for much less. The dark atmosphere was almost too dark, but that seems to be an issue at a lot of restaurants, though.",UNK
13079,"Best for a quick bite or an on-the-run pick up.  Got a chance to stop in for a visit as well as did some takeout.  \n\nAll you need to know are 2 words:  \""Scooter Monkey\""\n\n... you're welcome!",UNK
13080,"I am here in the middle of a weekday. They are busy and only ONE employee is working both print and shipping, plus she keeps having to stop working the customer line to answer phone calls.",UNK
13081,Worst service in recent memory. After an hour they came out and told me they ran out of pizza dough so my kids meals weren't coming. Then 2 seconds later they tell me their orders made the cut. No one knew what they were doing. Never going back.,UNK
13082,"Complete sausagefest. I was with a group of 4 attractive ladies and they kept letting in nothing but white guys. Seriously, WTH. I understand there has to be a certain ratio, but while we were waiting there was nothing but guys going in and a ton of good looking girls outside looking pissed. Complete fail.",UNK
13083,"Fun, cheap, exactly what I expected, the roof is cool. The staff is friendly and attractive, specifically the bartenders...they were fast and nice to me. Thank you. And thank you place.",UNK
13084,"This store is great, I do very good at Miu Miu, I got a new pair of heels that I love.  The sizes and styles seem to fit me very well.",UNK
13085,"Booked Xmas eve dinner reservations online! They called to cancel them 2 hours and 15 minutes before the dinner! All they had to say was \""sorry\"" ! Worst customer service ever! Do not give them the courtesy of even a taste! We as consumers need to demand better treatment!",UNK
13086,This Ball Park is pretty cool with the modern moving roof and a pool.  Who knew you could go for a swim at catch a live baseball game all at the same time.  No budlight lime though.  wah wah,UNK
13087,We were very happy with our experience at Sekai sushi. The food and service were great both times we have been. The prices and location are very reasonable as well. We will definitely go back and we will be referring others.,UNK
13088,Food was great\nService was great\nRelaxing atmosphere\nFriendly servers\nHighly recommended,UNK
13089,I'm posting this review as I'm sitting in the drive threw line.  It's been 20 minutes since I ordered and the line isn't moving... Service is slow.,UNK
13090,upgraded us to a tower room.  Room sucked. If this was a upgrade I could just imagine what would have happened if we didn't get one maybe they would have made us sleep in a shopping cart.  Horrible horrible. Would rather be in Reno but I have to go here twice a Month.  Never again.,UNK
13091,Owners are a joke. Especially the one with the gambling and drinking problem that tries his best to have sex with the staff....fail.,UNK
13092,"Mediocre at best. Rolls aren't that great. Rice is dry. Rainbow roll doesn't taste the best. The rolls here aren't that good.\n\nThe cooked foods, however, are pretty decent.",UNK
13093,"Cool for children... Not so much for adults. I came especially for the mummy exhibit and I was kind of disappointed. I liked the little computer stations that talked about Egypt and the actual mummy. Other than that, it was mediocre. I wouldn't recommend paying extra to see it.",UNK
13094,"This review does not apply to sushi. The Chinese food here are typical American Chinese, which is ok. I do enjoy the friendliness and clean dining area. Nothing special, but good place to go for lunch. I might try sushi next time.",UNK
13095,Burgers are ok. Fries are to plain with no taste but over it's an ok place to eat. Great friendly service.,UNK
13096,"Had a lunch-sized pizza which was really good and the friend that I with said he always has good meals there. Clean, efficient, with friendly staff. The only thing keeping it from 4 stars was the price. A tad too pricey to eat here for lunch regularly.",UNK
13097,"I hired a contractor through home advisor and when the contractor stole copper wire i though i was protected by home advisor but they did very little and never contacted me again. The contractor was AG spa service , aka Copper thief!!!",UNK
13098,My only negative is cigarette smoke smell. Ok with that out of the way. Cheese curd is good brat was good. Beer was good. Waitress was good. Decor is cool. They have signs everywhere that are fun to read.,UNK
13099,"Casual Michael Mina. Little bit PF Chang in some moments. Went for a work function, so can't complain, and everything was tasty if a bit salty. Large portions. It is Vegas, after all.",UNK
13100,Do not stay here! This place is falling apart. Defiantly not what was advertised. The elevators take forever and are usually to full accommodate any more guests. You are better off spending your money on a room at the Flamingo.,UNK
13101,"After waiting for an hour to do a wire transfer the bank representatives at this location are by far the worst Wells Fargo employees I have ever dealt with, customer service here is terrible at store #00754224.",UNK
13102,Maybe I am too picky with my Fish & Chips.  These ones sucked too!  We keep getting gift cards for this places but I have not had a meal I was happy with here.  The water is good.,UNK
13103,"I called to place an order for delivery and the guy simply stated \""we have a $30 minimum and you have to place the order through grub hub\"" and then hung up. Congratulations on losing a customer before ever even earning one.",UNK
13104,Chix noodle soup is heart\nPastrami sandwiches were soggy\nSkinny fries were good. \nPortions are huge \nPricing is a lil High compared to other delis\nConvenient if staying at TI,UNK
13105,"Shall i shall...tis worth the calories, tis.  Ummm...me likes.  Five dollars drinks add up to 50 dollar bills b4 five in a minute.  The 63 goes down like a gatorade.  It's a five star place.  Nice, affordable fun...",UNK
13106,"In general sakura has decent sushi, not bad not great.  But their spicy tuna sandwich roll is life changing, every friend whose tried it has been converted for life.  Get that or their tempura fried ice cream and you will not be disapointed.",UNK
13107,For shoppers this is a great place to go.  They have shops that most outlets don't have.  They have a black and white market that my was really want to go to.,UNK
13108,"The food is good, and the hookah lounge is fantastic. Location? Well, not as good as the one on Sahara, but near UNLV so you work with what you got.",UNK
13109,"Pretty average all around; decent decor and drinks, lackluster music and WHERE IS THIS ALLEGED LUST AND DECADENCE??? I have only ever been attemptedly groped there by misshapen people and there's always some girl crying in the bathroom.",UNK
13110,"Kind of expensive, not that much food for the price. The quality was decent, but nothing too elaborate, and the vibrant flavors you'd expect from Greek food just wasn't there.",UNK
13111,Went for just a pint and hoping to get a smoke salmon appetizer.  But to my surprise not smoke salmon appetizer to be found.  Service was kinda slow but I was there mid week and early afternoon.  If I had more time in the city I'd give it another try.,UNK
13112,"This place is always a good time, and the food is delicious. I've been there for the all-you-can-eat wings as well as other food. Definitely a spot worth checking out if you like sports bars and 'bar food'.",UNK
13113,"This is, by far, the slowest Starbucks in the whole entire nation. Why is there only one person working. The line wraps around the damn place. And apparently it is always the case. Terrible. \nAs far as the actual coffee, it was fine.",UNK
13114,"This place is bad all around, the food, the drinks, and the service. I saw the bartender go outside and smoke and make out with some guy and then come in without washing hands. Majorly gross!!",UNK
13115,Really nice place service was great. Meat was fresh I don't think there was anything to complain about. Even when the line was long for the for to be cooked it still came out pretty fast. I would recommend this place to eat,UNK
13116,"I can't believe I went to a loud rock show....and I can't wait to go back. We bought these tickets as a treat for our 4 daughters . They loved the show and so did we...especially the \""RANDOM COOKIE BREAK\"".  So much fun.",UNK
13117,"I ordered the Garlic Chicken and it was delicious, hot, fresh, flavorful and the chicken was tender. Large portions and inexpensive.",UNK
13118,"Soggy overpriced fast food burger with allot of hype. When you have to cover the walls with quotes how good your product is, then you have to something to hide.",UNK
13119,"I have made an appointment here several times, and each time I still have to wait at least 30 minutes.  Everything they do is good.  It just seems like if you make an appointment you shouldn't have to wait for more than like 5 minutes.  I am currently looking for a new place because I just don't have time to waste.",UNK
13120,The food is just amazing. A little over price in my opinion. Oh and registers need to be more specific in regards add-on pricing.,UNK
13121,"Food and drink were ok, but kitchen closes at midnight and even though hours say open until 2 they were circling our table to leave from the moment we walked in. A group walked in at 12:48 and they told them that they were closed. Won't come here again.",UNK
13122,Stayed here for 1 night and the room was really nice. The bed was super comfortable and the bathroom was a nice size. My only complaint was that there was no outlet by the nightstand to charge my phone.,UNK
13123,Not impressed. The prices here seem to keep going up and up and nothing changes in the store design or layout. Seems dated. Produce could use a makeover.\n\n8 out of 10 times I will drive all the way to Madison to another store.,UNK
13124,"Wednesday's nights fun with the 2-4-1 all night, But sometimes get crowded and too many overweight people push everybody around and also many people have in their luggage on the dance floor meaning that the purses I like pieces of luggage it's ridiculous to bring dancing.",UNK
13125,"This is, in my opinion, an above average store. It's always clean and well stocked. The staff is friendly and very helpful.",UNK
13126,Hubby likes the pork fried rice. I like the appetizers. Entrees are fairly good. Service is so friendly. I like dining in because it's quaint and the girl working is so sweet.,UNK
13127,"Being from NM originally, I hate TEX MEX and this is authentic stuff with red chili pepper sauce.  This place does not rate higher due to being a little dirty and bad wait staff.  The food speaks for itself and it is hard to find good tamales which they have.",UNK
13128,I took a cab of lucky company in Las Vegas. The driver drives longer than it is supposed to be. I called the company to complain. It also turned me down for the reason that I don't have the cab number. However this does not happen in other companies. This made my trip so uncomfortable! Really bad.,UNK
13129,Airport bars are never really great and usually leaving me wanting for more.  This place is just a notch below that.  Beer selection is lacking and food wasn't appetizing.,UNK
13130,"Great club at the Wynn/Encore. This club reminds me of xs because of the bathroom, decor and layout. Great crowd, not too over packed. Great music and atmosphere.",UNK
13131,"We get to their booth at 11PM with a reservation and they were no cars available for more than an hour. Everyone was pissed a the staff was totally unrespectful, unhelpful and unfriendly. Next time for $10 bucks more I will go Hertz or National.",UNK
13132,Beer and service was great. Our waiter gave my wife samples of beer since she wasn't a beer drinker but wanted to try.\nThe food was blah. Had the shepards pie and didn't like it compared to others I had.,UNK
13133,"First time here and very happy.  This is a great, small family oriented place.  The Tom kha soup was excellent.  The fried rice was pretty darned good too.  Very busy at lunch and for good reason.   We will be back to try different menu items and these stars may go up.",UNK
13134,"Yes, the Pel'meni heyday has since passed, but it's still cheap, quick, and pretty tasty.",UNK
13135,Good burgers and Bloody Mary's.\n\nI had a buffalo burger cooked to perfection. The boyfriend had a spicy lamb burger that was really unique - the seasonings were complex and went well with the lamb. The fries were ordinary - we should have tried the sweet potato version.,UNK
13136,"bad food , high prices, arrogant owner . If it wasn't  for the the people from out of town in  need some hot soup after a long night of gambling. This place would not even make it. I would never come back again.",UNK
13137,I wait for around 7 weeks for a response from the OUTBACK Steakhouse Customer Service. Despite two requests no reaction. This is a bad customer service,UNK
13138,"The service at counter sucked! The girl that took my order was very rude and not helpful at all. Seem like she didn't want to be there. The food was great, I recommend the family special wich includes a large pizza and wings. Very good! I recommend the food just disappointed with the service.",UNK
13139,"If you need a quick fix of mexican food on the go at CLT, this works, but don't expect  anything incredible. Cheap, quick and basic. The chicken was dry and sub par, the rice was likely from a box, but it was pretty much what you'd expect for an airport burrito bar.",UNK
13140,Waited for over an hour for my scheduled appt. Barely any leg rub. My nails lasted half the time than normal. Will never go back.,UNK
13141,"I ordered the spicy chicken and sweet potato hash for brunch. It was very different. The sweet potato was not soft enough but the spicy chicken was tender and the sauce was good, which made it taste better and balanced it. I also tried the Mesa burger which I enjoyed very much and the fries were seasoned well.",UNK
13142,"Omer's right: If Barry White were a bar, he'd be Chez Nous.   \n\nIt gets 4 stars instead of 5 because the funk band moved from playing old skool MJ to a J-Lo song.  That just ain't right.",UNK

13146,"These reviews are sort of confusing me.  I went there today and had a really great manicure and it was pretty cheap ($12).  However, next time you're there...I urge you to look at the floor by the pedicure chairs.  There is an enormous amount of toe-nail clippings.  Eew.",UNK
13147,"Service sucks. Food is decent, except they never get the order right.  Every time I have been there I have either been treated so poorly for no reason, I would rather go to a different location so I don't get snarled at by the staff.",UNK
13148,"Definitely my least favorite Starbucks in the Charlotte area. The service is lackadaisical and the seating is limited but not that comfy. There's nothing that terrible about it, but with Starbucks, it's the little things that make a big difference, and this one just falls short.",UNK
13149,This place has more employees than the population of most towns in the state of Nevada.  Expect huge.   MGM Grand is ever-changing.  From the restaurant choices to their soap wrappers.  And the lion exhibit is my favorite free thing to do in Vegas.,UNK

13162,"This was THE WORST take out / delivery I've ordered, of any cuisine, ever.  Large amount of food, some inedible.\n\nMost things were completely bland, some had more oil than any other single ingredient. The korma was OK, and rice was OK. to be fair.",UNK
13163,"Gf liked the boullabaise, spinach tempura interesting at first...fish cake rubbery but flavorful.  Very nice decor. Great napkin folding.  Waiter hawked a phlegmball just as we were taking our first bite in an otherwise quiet restaurant.",UNK

13173,"Heard all the hype about this restaurant but I think this restaurant sucks. I ordered the halibut and it came out uncooked in the middle. Sent it back hoping to get a new piece of fish, but they just cooked my fish a little more. Rick should fire his whole chef staff and start over.",UNK

13184,"This was my first time by this place and wow. The proportions are huge! Prepare yourself to eat because the size of the plate infront you you will have your eyes gleaming.

13187,"Everything was great until I experienced a colony of flies at the corner of my table, and spent the whole meal killing them by snapping a wet rag at them.  I've been there many times, but it will be a long time before I come in again.  A customer should never experience that.",UNK
13188,I actually expected more... I don't know - maybe some flea markets? But this was literally an extended version of NYC's subway system - several tunnels leading to an entrance to either a subway or a mall...,UNK
13189,Very nice facility. Some of the staff were great and others need a swift kick in the tail. The VA has far too much nepotism and needs to clean house.,UNK
13190,"Terrible  we sat at the bar and never received service ,,,, bartender was rude and spoke only to the locals.\nNot worth free beer",UNK
13191,Friendly staff seemed to actually enjoy their job. Very prompt service.\n\n Place was packed and yet we were seated quickly. Food came out and served quickly\n\nAdequate portions and great tasting food! \n\nOnly downside was only one bathroom so had a 3 person wait for mens a room,UNK

13193,"For some reason, this Target store did not impress me.  They had a very poor selection of clothing in all areas. I would recommend the Target at 43rd Ave & Peoria.  We were only here because we had a $50 gift card otherwise I never go to Target as their prices are slightly higher anyway.",UNK
13194,"The place I went was on the Strip, so not sure if I have the right spot.  Had a guy rolling cigars out front.  Cool novelty.  Cigar was pretty good.  $10.\n\nI would not buy another one, but it was totally worth the $10.",UNK

13197,"Very unprofessional. I have had delivery from this location in the past, and now suddenly they won't deliver.

13203,"It has an unique layout, and although there is a lot of space- it is crowded.  I did find it easier to get a drink here versus other clubs on the same weekend.  The crowd is a little older, but not old.  The night I was there, I didn't see any issues with the dress code as others have commented.",UNK
13204,I love this place!  The group runs are awesome and the employees are great too.\nThere's always something fun going on down here.  The clearance merchandise is great too\n\nI like that they take the time to do a gait analysis too when you're buying shoes.\n\nI would highly recommend,UNK

13206,"The food is good, nothing special though. The Menudo is good but everything else is mediocre at best. The service is horrible. Took us two hours to get our food the first time and the second time, we decided to give it another shot, it took about an hour and a half. Will most likely never go back.",UNK
13207,Came in for a pedicure... a great way to have use of the spa but not pay crazy money ... Jennifer was a sweetheart and made my toes look fab!,UNK
13208,"I thought I would really like this place, but I just don't find anything really special. \n\nThe burgers and fries are just so-so. Pretty pricey for a burger joint even for Vegas standards!\n\nGood that it's open 24 hours.",UNK
13209,"Pros: easy to spot, clean, decor is pretty nice. \nCons: terribly slow service and meh beer. \n\nIt's basically a place to dive into when you can't find anything better or are too tired to make it to a better place.",UNK

13211,Reviews were great for this place so we ordered on a Friday night....pizza was ok...no flavor really. Chicken finger and garlic fries were good.\nNothing special...,UNK
13212,Snooze is the ONLY breakfast restaurant I know of that has a wait for their bar. Went to Over Easy instead. Change your bar wait policy and we'll try your establishment.,UNK
13213,"Worst room service I don't think. They clean the room ,  no slippers. No robs is there. Less than. One star",UNK
13214,The barbecue was cold and certainly nothing to write home about.  I was hoping for some amazing Carolina-style BBQ.  This was not the place.  I should've ventured farther from the hotel in search of the real thing.,UNK
13215,a 3 day kitchen remodel has turned into an 8 day job. all these 5 star reviews must be from people they know.  the only good thing I can say is that at least they answer their phones.,UNK
13216,"Again, Vegas....Quit bringing LA nightlife to your city and ruining it's name. \n\nThis place is RA just with a new name, to attract the mindless american visitor for status.\n\nWorthless and disgusting.",UNK
13217,"Ordered the pancake, bulgogi, galbi, and some shrimp dumplings... Worst Korean place ever. No flavor in anything. Meat was bland and was disgusting to eat. The sides were no better. Would never return!",UNK
13218,"I went through the drive-through and ordered a torta de milanesa de res. The service was quick and the food was pretty good. Definitely nothing special, and prices were higher than other places, with smaller portions, thus the lower rating.",UNK
13219,Fish dish was decent but really salty.  Didn't like the taste of the broccoli. The green beans were very good.,UNK
13220,My number 1 pizza place here in AZ so far and I'm on a mission! Don't leave without eating the garlic cheese knots !,UNK
13221,Some friends took us here to eat.  Everything was OK.   The pepperoni pizza was average.  There was not very much pepperoni.  The hot wings were nothing special but the honey wings were very good.  Service and atmosphere was good.,UNK
13222,"Huge portions, and open 24/7.  The food was just okay, nothing unforgettable. There was no waiting at 230am!",UNK
13223,I love the atmosphere and the food. Not a fan of beer or wine as my only options. And I hate forced valet parking. If it weren't for the forced valet parking I would visit more often.,UNK
13224,This place was not good although the staff was friendly my 5 year old son ordered the cheeseburger for kids and it was raw on the outside of the burger. My gyro meat was hard and dried out. And my husbands kebobs had no flavor!,UNK
13225,"I prefer the Palazzo.  Maybe it was just the wing our room was in...but i felt it inconvieient to get to the lobby from the hotel room.  that alone took me about 10 minutes.  But beautiful hotel, nonetheless.",UNK
13226,"Good beer selection. Understaffed for a light Monday night crowd, it wasn't her fault she was the only server. But it took about an hour to get our sandwiches. Mine was one of the best reubens I've ever had.",UNK
13227,Avoid avoid avoid! Tried this place with a friend because the name sounds authentic. The food is not well seasoned. Taste like water with umami preservatives the shrimp are too sad to be on a plate!,UNK
13228,I was treated very rude by the owners and will tell anyone I cross paths with not to patron this establishment.  They think they can treat customers rudely without getting a reputation.  I watched them kick out a mother and her children because she had a barking dog in her Bentley outside.   O.K. I am that mother. The nerve!,UNK
13229,Service was good extremely noisy. I ordered a club sandwich with fries and was told they charge 79cents for ranch.  Are they this hard up?,UNK
13230,It was a small little sushi place. It had really good service. The sushi was quite average. The people were really friendly though. I enjoyed the SSS roll and the salmon nigiri the most. The all-you-can-eat price was fair; $21-26 per person. It was overall a good experience.,UNK
13231,"Flavor and quality, great! Accuracy of orders, not great. Every time we come here, EVERY time, they prepare one of our burgers completely different than ordered. While they are good to correct it, it does mean we are eating separately as we wait for the incorrectly prepared burger to be cooked properly.",UNK
13232,No more than average serve and food quality with above average pricing. This is my second and last visit. They just can't pull off the fine dining restaurant concept.,UNK
13233,Stopped in here on a whim and LOVED it. The chefs started bringing all kinds of stuff out as soon as we said AYCE.  Amazing flavors and great quality.  A Must try :),UNK
13234,I took my family here the other night. All in all it was ok but not great. The service was good. The food was average but not great. I've been to Indian restaurants all over and have never been charged extra for rice? 4 dollars for a small bowl is just not right.,UNK
13235,Not worth paying for. Make your own salad better and for less! It was clean- that's about all I can say for it...,UNK
13236,"I had poor service, the chili was so dry it was like eating paste.  Service was poor, had to ask for the check...won't go back.",UNK
13237,"Went to Henderson location it's ok, another sports bar with a lot of tv's , bartenders are nice but boring, even for old guy like me!  I guess Burger King just promoted them...",UNK
13238,This place is as average of a buffet as it gets.   There are many different places where you can get better food for the same price.,UNK
13239,Terrible service.  Waited in 15 min. One two people served. The line did not move.  Two workers. Don't know what the problem was. Our party of 5 left after the 15min. Pretty sad.\nBy far the worst Dunkin Donuts in the Valley.,UNK
13240,"Not only did they damage a sweater, they told me they would take care of it with my tailor and never did.  On top of that, they write in PERMANENT MARKER on your clothes! Unbelievable! Stay away from this place.  Take the time and take your clothes somewhere else.",UNK
13241,"I have eaten at the Cosmos uptown, but only have stopped in for beverages at  this location. The bar here is large, well appointed, and the bartenders are friendly. I like the layout and decor.   If you stop in right after work, it is not too crowded. However, later in the evening it is certainly more happening.",UNK
13242,This airport (the Southwest terminal at least) is so old and outdated. It smells like an old basement. Food choices are seriously lacking though there is a new Pei Wei. \nThe B gates have seriously not been updated since the 50's. \nTime for a revamp!,UNK
13243,"We liked this place 10000x better than the chateau. So much fun! Great hosts, fun diverse atmosphere and need I say it....Beer pong!",UNK
13244,"the salsa bar is good, free chips and salsa.\nthe  people working on the counter are rude.\nhad the california tacos so plaine has no flavor\nwont be back",UNK
13245,"Service is slow for an informal sandwich place but if you're hungry, you just need patience. \n\nQuizno's  is located at the food court in the Riviera.  You can enter through the casino or from the Strip.\n\nAverage sandwich.  I prefer Subway over Quizno's.",UNK
13246,"I have not taken any time to look at the clothing sections, but the house wears seem to be a pretty good deal. This place always seems busy, so if you need assistance, you may be on your own.",UNK
13247,The food is ok here. Nothing compared to Japan though. I've had better in Japan. We need more restaurants like this in Vegas. One thing bad is that the food is very very OVERPRICED!,UNK
13248,"One of the best Kohl's in the valley. I drive an extra 10 minutes to go to this location rather than the one near my house. Clean, neat and friendly employees. Whatever this manager is doing, they are doing it right!",UNK
13249,The Seaboat sandwich is the best fish sandwich I've ever had. I love the okra and the collard greens.  However their customer service is the worst.,UNK
13250,"It was ok.... Over priced for some rogies, they were good but not the best I've ever had. . I'll give this place another chance tho. I really like the fact that they are open until 2 on weekends ...",UNK
13251,"After sitting at our table for 30 minutes and not getting any service, we left.  But not before the hostess said thanks for coming in. Needles to say I will not be returning.",UNK
13252,"New Jersey Italian.  Too much pasta, watery sauce and  only a few pieces of processed chicken; no flavor.  Great interior design and servers were friendly and attentive.  Hope with time and practice it improves.",UNK
13253,Good sweet tea\nHorrible everything else\nGenaro's was generic!\nDon't get me started on the horrible server,UNK
13254,"I really wanted to like this place. Sadly, our pizza was cold and underdone. It didn't improve, even after being put in our oven. We ended up throwing it out. Two stars for their use of organic and local ingredients.",UNK
13255,"Service and food was great. The salad bar had a huge variety of quality food. Clean and great ambiance. The only negative is that the bill included an 18% gratuity but the server never mentioned it - easy to overlook. Would have been better if he told us a gratuity was included,",UNK
13256,"Classy, great service!  Fun atmosphere.  Lots of interesting choices on the menu.  Our waiter gave us some good tips.  \nthe sangria was delicious and my husband said it was one of the best martinis he's ever had.",UNK
13257,This place has a heck of a philly! the 8oz was split between 3 guys along with a large sausage pizza. I took a half and a slice and I was stuffed. They truly pack the philly!,UNK
13258,I would love to say something nice about the food here but I've been waiting for my noodles for over an hour now. The expectations are so high now and can't possibly be fulfilled.   Don't come here if you are already hungry. You'll pass out waiting. Will post again if I ever get to eat.,UNK
13259,I sat in the drive thru waiting for my food for 10 minutes and was not even busy.  slow service. And they gave me the wrong order.,UNK
13260,"Most of the food was dry, cold or tasteless. Services was so slow and we needed to remind the waitress for our drinks several times. It wasn't crowded it was the wait staff spent most of the time with the loud bird. Atmosphere is the only nice thing. Not with a return trip though.",UNK
13261,Absolute GARBAGE! This place was a total let down. The food lacked flavor and seemed like it had all been canned or frozen. Nothing seemed fresh. The service was slow and the employees appeared as though they had 10 years left of indentured servitude.,UNK
13262,OUT OF BUSINESS. Spice Asian Bistro now occupies this space. Can't wait to try them out and post my review!,UNK
13263,One more time while I'm here!\n\nGreat eggs benedict here but going to try something different. Going w the pancakes!\n\nBreakfast of champs!,UNK
13264,"They don't have notary services here, strangely. Hit the UPS Store down the road. Otherwise, they do have copies and workstations you can rent by the minute.",UNK
13265,"great pizza, pretty fast and good quality and freshness.\n\nThis place is affordable, you have your usual big screens, the breadsticks were fantastic.",UNK
13266,Met some friends with my Family.  Everything was very good except for a young server who could not be bothered.  Owner was really nice and helpful with the menu.,UNK
13267,"I just ordered a regular cheeseburger with grilled onions and fries.  Burger was good, fries were about 1 minute under-cooked and you could tell if it had cooked that one extra minute they would have been awesome.   We called ahead to pick up and they were very fast and friendly.  I'm a fan.",UNK
13268,"Very fun evening dining experience. We sat outside under the stars. The service was excellent and the food was very good. We had a light fare of guacamole, chips and carnitas. After diner we enjoyed a walk through the colorful  hotel lobby and around the beautiful grounds. Would definitely eat here again.",UNK
13269,"I think I'm being generous with a 3 star review, the food is very so so, we went with a group of 5 people and I honestly didn't like a single entree.  I do like the open feel of the place though.  Great marketing also.",UNK
13270,"Story is always the same here.. Great atsmosphere , great food but the service as always super slow.. Employees are super cool",UNK
13271,"The lobster tail in the seafood platter was excellent, as was the guacamole ceviche. The steak came out well done even though I ordered medium rare, but the waiter resolved it pretty quickly. The food was worth the wait.",UNK
13272,"I liked the experience but amidst the performance the show came to a halt. The ushers informed us that it was some type of safety mechanism that stops the performance to prevent a mishap. With that said, this whole issue that lasted a good 30 mins brought the overall review down a peg or two.",UNK
13273,"Nothing memorable. Nice setting, average food. Fair prices.\n\nThe lamb was too salty. The fries were too little and in general the typical lame LV restaurant.\n\nThe service was OK.",UNK
13274,"This place cant even make what they have on the menu. Every time I come here for dinner the food is different and never what is stated in the menu. They are frequently out of items as well, but wont tell you till you order. This place is good for drinks only in my opinion!",UNK
13275,"I have a food allergy so I emailed the address on their website and asked if there's any gluten free options because my friends said the food is so good. Minutes later I got a one word response: No. Ok I guess but why not talk up the salads? Drink specials? Sorry to bother you, manager.",UNK
13276,All I wanted was the big bowl of macaroni and cheese but it is no longer on the menu.  Despite the place being half empty they sat my pregnant wife and I right next to the wait station.  Tonight we dined on pasta and ass.  We won't be back.,UNK
13277,Great comfortable place for the price. I don't care about jacuzi and swimming but I do care about the service here which is decent.,UNK
13278,"Rathole. I like dive bars, but some basic cleanliness needs to be observed. They do have a good beer selection, which is what got them the second star from me, but I will not be returning.",UNK
13279,"Wasn't the best experience, I have been here a couple times it was really good! Today it wasn't the best. I love that they have Wyland posters! But the service took forever it took us probably about one hour and 45 minutes just for 3 things.",UNK
13280,"I absolutely love the jerk chicken pizza! The beer selection is great and it's a good place to go after a concert at the symphony. The service is okay just a little slow. I wish the prices were a little cheaper, but overall a good place.",UNK
13281,"It was our second time ordering.. Our first pizza was good, it could have used more sauce, so this time around I just ordered more sauce, the house salad is soo good too!!  Its big enough for two people!",UNK
13282,"This was a very inefficient operation that doesn't represent the Mandalay Bay brand well. There were many people working, a lot of activity, many customers waiting and not a lot of results.",UNK
13283,"I don't like sushi enough to get the all you can eat, but a friend of mine is a sushi fiend and loved it. I got the bento box and it was very good. The vanilla mochi wasn't bad either!",UNK
13284,"Pizza is tasty, thin crust, although too much sauce for my preference.  Lots of menu choices. Did not like the garlic knots! But overall decent, clean and friendly.",UNK
13285,"Be aware, BE VERY AWARE! ?f you're departing from any terminal after 11pm local, you will have access to ZERO food or drink, other than a water fountain. Be prepared, you have been warned!",UNK
13286,"Went to Centrifuge on a Sunday night. The ambiance is great Drinks were good the bartenders get up and dance every so often. The place was kinda empty, but i am sure it is more fun on weekends.",UNK
13287,"I m a new fan of Belk !  Great Bargain!  blazers, sweaters and shoes.  My new favorite store. If u have the time the clearance items are great bargains.",UNK
13288,The staff at this office were wonderful!  The lobby was comfortable with updated magazines.  They also have cookies and coffee for patients which is totally awesome!!  There was a long wait before I got called back and there were not very many patients.,UNK
13289,"Good selection for a Las Vegas buffet - quiet environment and good views of the pool area.\n\nBreakfast selections were awesome - meats, breads, steak (yeah) and exotic fruits.\n\nA little pricey for a Vegas buffet",UNK
13290,The yellow chicken curry and shrimp pad Thai were great. Trying to order online was a bit of a hassle but over all they delivered rather quickly. Good to know it's right down the street too.,UNK
13291,Horrible!!!! It took an hour for us to get our food!! No apology for the server! We will never go back!,UNK
13292,"We eat here every time in Vegas.  It very consistent.  It is very good for large groups as it serves the traditional large sizes.  Service is always good, food is always good.  My noodles were a little over cooked this time so I knocked them down to a 4 star otherwise they are 5 star all the way.",UNK
13293,Best dogs I have had at a restaurant in Charlotte. The big deal is they toast the buns so they are not all doughy. The onion rings are thin and the right level of greasy. Service was friendly. Will return again.,UNK
13294,"Nader, the grave bartender on weekends is the best. He used to work at PT's in Henderson and now, to my absolute pleasure, he's right next to my house! Yesss!",UNK
13295,"Service was good as was the food, portions were great. We ordered a bit too much the first time so when we go back we will chose less. Lots of leftovers.",UNK
13296,"Metro is OK. They have good Pizza's. I'm personally all about the Foundation (Crust) so that why I give them 3 stars. If you can't eat the crust by itself, its not Great Pizza. Just OK.",UNK
13297,"Slow service...mediocre pizza and the worst wings EVER!  We ordered for an office lunch, and were very disappointed.  Phoned in complaint and the 12 year old who answered phone,  placed us on hold three times.  They argued with us about the quality of the food.  No more for us.",UNK
13298,I am a member there only because there are no other country clubs close by.  Welcome to Gilbert/ Queen Creek/ San Tan Valley!!! :(,UNK
13299,"Not a bad place but much overprice considering quality of food and service... At least not qualified for more than 3 stars... / During this holiday season, I found Oyshi Sushi nearby is much better for my taste.",UNK
13300,They don't accept Arby's gift cards. Shame on them!\n\nThey have since closed their doors for good at this location.,UNK
13301,Un fortunately this is the best pizza in the area.  Just had it tonight because the dbacks won yesterday so it's 50% off here.  Chicken poppers were good tonight.  Not great food but not terrible food either.  Good for half off,UNK
13302,Horrible service. I told the hostess I was uncomfortable wearing the hospital gown provided because of a recent hospital stay. She told us that I had to put it on or I could go away. Seriously. That's all it took for me to turn around and walk out. I will NEVER go back here.,UNK
13303,"came for a fraternity reunion a few years ago and for a friend's bday... not impressed. this club is probably on its way to being played out...like tao, pure, etx...",UNK
13304,Good place if you like under-cooked (not-cooked) raw burgers - dangerous combination with drunk hungry people. \n\nAside from that OK place with ping pong and foosball table. Nice service and music as well.,UNK
13305,"Burgers were bland, extremely overcooked, and overpriced.  $50+ tip for 2, couple burgers, an appetizer, beer and a soda.  Skip it.",UNK
13306,"$50 in play and I had to pay full price for my 2 beers. Super lame. It sucks, because I actually like this place. You can't swing a dead cat in this town without hitting a local bar willing to comp for play..",UNK
13307,Slow service at deli.  The meat department was in disarray  some of the meat cases were broken   check out was slow and customer service was bad,UNK
13308,"Treated so horribly when I asked to speak with a manager after hong was so rude, had cut me and then been super rough with my manicure after giving a horrible pedicure.  \n\nHorrible service and I loved coming here so bummed!",UNK
13309,This is a good Big Lots location with a large selection of items. The aisles were well stocked and organized and I enjoyed my shopping visit quite a bit.,UNK
13310,"Weird mix of local drunks and school crowd. Drink specials were nice. Had a pint of Brooklyn stout that was only $2.50. Pretty good deal compared to the Miller Light only type specials in other local bars. No tabs or credit cards, though. Isn't it 2010?",UNK
13311,"I visit this location often, enough that an employee should mention their rewards program and when someone asks about it don't make assumptions and then distrust what someone says to you.  It makes this store look awful and ugly.",UNK
13312,even the air is saturated with grease. \ni literally went straight to Kohl's and bought a shirt off their clearance rack to wear back to the rest of my work day.,UNK
13313,"Ummm... I hear this place is new so hopefully it's a work in progress... Appetizers were pretty heavy and some were awkward to share.  The ladies behind the bar were very friendly and professional (and probably the best part of the experience).  I see the potential, sadly its not there yet though.",UNK
13314,"I haven't tried the food here yet, but I love the location and wine. It's peaceful and on the quiet side - right by the lake. And it is dog friendly. So this is a great little spot to sit out on the patio and sip a couple of glasses of wine.",UNK
13315,My husband and I came here for our last date until our baby arrived. I was 9 months pregnant and just wanted to go somewhere fun and out of the ordinary. This place was an excellent choice. Great atmosphere and great food. One tip I would give is to just valet at Caesar's Palace!,UNK
13316,"We went here for drinks and a bite before a concert at nearby Byham theater. We had wings and a piece of cookies and cream cake. Both were outstanding. We both had the Fat Gary's Ale, but in hindsight I would have preferred a Guinness. The ambiance was suitably cave-like as a good bar should be.",UNK
13317,"This place has EXCELLENT food, with generous helpings!\nMaybe that's why in the AM it usually has a bit of a line.\nI've never been disappointed, and the prices are very reasonable.",UNK
13318,They make a great Chicken Fried Steak and its HUGE!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Great Value.....,UNK
13319,Finally made it and it was just OK! Music was wayyyy tooooo loud. Plain waffle was very dry. Service was just OK. Will try one more time...I think.,UNK
13320,"Really. Really. Booooring. Beautiful to look at, but i wanted more acrobatics and entertainment. Too artsy for my taste.",UNK
13321,The food was ok.  Service was a little slow and not very attentive.  I went with the family and the kids thought the place looked pretty cool but other than that they left saying they never wanted to go there again.,UNK
13322,The wait staff are really marginal no sense of dedication lack manners and serving skills. Food is expensive for the lack of quality. Bread horrible the loaves of bread that are on display in kitchen as props look  better. Would absolutely not return.,UNK
13323,Sadly I had a two star experience here last night so needed to update. Had horribly salty dish and was unimpressed by the overall experience. Even the good is sometimes horribly bad I guess....,UNK
13324,Rio pool! No longer a hot spot free pool for local son the weekend. They started charging for pool entry a month ago for Friday - Sunday.  $20 per adult and $10 for children.  No wonder it's completely dead for a Saturday!,UNK
13325,"Terrible service. Drinks were never served, I got my food but the person I went with never got theirs so we left. Absolute mad house. I will never go there again.",UNK
13326,"Been here a few times while in town.  Usually get the typical Thai dishes when I come here w friends.  The papya salad, lad nah seafood, half an order of duck and chinese broccoli.  Looking forward to trying other things on their menu, but so far...so yummy!",UNK
13327,Receptionist was fine...Nurse was fine...Doctor was a joke.  All we were looking for was advice and she dismissively treated us like narcotic pain medication seekers.  Rude and uninformative!,UNK
13328,"Great service, and fast..   You can build a serious burger at this place.  JOHNNY ROCKETS.  Inside Silverton Casino.",UNK
13329,"Horrible service. Wish I could have given it a zero. We waited an hour for our food, no one addressed the wait and I was charged for something that never arrived.",UNK
13330,I tried Dutch Bros a few years ago and didn't like it at all.  I tried again today and thought it was pretty good.  Not great...good.  I still love my other coffee place but this was a pretty good substitute and the service was excellent!,UNK
13331,Food was very good and service was awesome.  We ate here before a show and they served us super quick as requested.  Would definitely eat here again.,UNK
13332,When we ordered our food it came out great. Then we ordered a burger for our brother at home and it took 15min and it was cold. :( very disappointing,UNK
13333,GO TO THE ORIENT HOUSE NEXT DOOR....Had the double cooked pork and instead of pork it was bacon. I don't know if they forgot which type of pork is usually used but it was very disappointing. I recommend next door instead.,UNK
13334,"They definitely know how to cook that meat. But just like any steakhouse this one is nothin' special. It's poorly lit, cluttered with Texas ephemera and peanut shells. Good place to take those relatives you only kinda like.",UNK
13335,Worst place ever I will never come back here bottles are expensive and the music is shittty !! U will get ripped off... I never been to a place where women pay for a cover charge and they play all kinds of weird fucking music. Whatever tho will never go back there again,UNK
13336,"Price went up recently to $10 + tip.  Suddenly expensive for downtown.  The food is still good, but it's now a special stop and off the weekly rotation.",UNK
13337,Great food!   But stop being so stingy!!!!    I'm being charged $2 for extra guacamole then give me $2 worth!    I hate always having to ask for more..,UNK
13338,Poor service and very open sketchy (drug?) dealings in the parking area. My friend and I walk here for cigarettes and often see questionable activity going on. The second star is solely earned by the giant American flag that flies on this property. That thing is glorious!,UNK
13339,definitely worth it when you get a $5 coupon via email or on your receipt.\n\nnot as good as sweet tomatoes but good. i like their tuna snickerdoodle salad which is always on the menu and the make your own strawberry shortcake bar!,UNK
13340,"We arrived the Palm Beach one minute before they close and they welcomed us and even tough we were the only group left in the restaurant they gave us their full attention. \n\nThe food is amazing, they have a huge menu of all \""traditional\"" western Saudi foods. Their dishes taste like the food in an average Saudi family house.",UNK
13341,"I want to like this place but it just never seems to hit its mark.  The hummus is okay but they use way too much tahini in it.  The food is consistently ok, but it is just ok.  The service is always slow.",UNK
13342,"Chicken fried steak = winner, catfish = winner, anything else I have tried = winner.  Great spot, good portions, and friendly + quick staff.  \n\nEnough said, except a Thank You TEXAZ!",UNK
13343,"I lile their food and the fact that you can see is great. The employees are nice, however, their system disorganized. Ididnt know how to order and i didnt see the menu until i payed...i",UNK
13344,"The pizza has too much cheese, is too greasy, and is not great. The gyro is average to good. The burgers were surprisingly good for a pizza delivery place. Better than a lot of delivery pizza in the area, but nothing special.",UNK
13345,"No problems here at all, and the room was very clean and the bathroom was perfect. Decent bedding and no issues with parking, checking in or checking out. We didn't arise in time for the breakfast so I can't comment on that. But I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.",UNK
13346,"Dinner was so good I had to try breakfast. Unfortunately our breakfast experience was BAD! We got there at 7:10 am. Sat ourselves, read through the menu, and waited while a 3 member wait staff drank coffee fraternized and completely ignored our presence!  it's no wonder why the place was empty at this time of day.",UNK
13347,Love going to Town Square to escape the superficial atmosphere at the strip.   Makes me feel like I am back in Cali.  Love the place and there is always something to do in the day time and evenings.\n\nA great place for kids.\n\n4 big stars,UNK
13348,"High hopes. Fading fast.\n\nSmall, more community style bank.  I had a good experience mostly, but they have been inconsistent between me and another new customer.  Different answers, delivery dates, and I still have not received my referral credit.",UNK
13349,"Nice little place with good, solid French food.  The steak tartar was great and the other food pretty good.  Great little patio to dine in is a big plus now with our current best weather in the country status.  THis is the kind of place we need about a thousand of.",UNK
13350,"3-4 stars. This is a fine Irish bar. I would return, however I wish the female server would have picked up her game a bit. The prices were acceptable and the atmosphere classic. The food was nothing to write home about, but it was traditional Irish fare.",UNK
13351,Jaymee Galvan was my stylist! She did an awesome job highlighting and cutting my hair just in time for summer!!! She knows what she's doing (being a color specialist). She was very professional and attended to my needs. I would definitely recommend her to anyone I know. Thanks Jaymee!!!!,UNK
13352,"It's all about the gas station here. More often than not they are one of the cheapest in the valley. \n\nNot a huge fan of the store itself because of the customers, not the staff but I love the gas prices here so I have to give this location a 4!",UNK
13353,"Located right on the strip. Horrible mixed drinks and expensive food. The service was not good. Our server was wearing a hoodie and called me \""bro\"" ....i am not a bro.",UNK
13354,The food had a nice flavor to it. And I enjoy the fact that they serve breakfast all day. On the negative side of things; the wait to be sat was way too long. The server was mediocre at best and the food was cold by the time that it got to us!,UNK
13355,"Have never heard a word from corporate, even an apology email would have been nice.  I'd be willing to bet they get SO MANY complaint letters they just can't keep up.  Or they just don't give a shit.  My money is on the second.",UNK
13356,Not bad.  Not the best. \nUsually people are friendly and service is timely.\nI wasn't impressed with the Drs.  But the regular staff is fine.\nSelection of frames is small.,UNK
13357,eeeeeeeeeehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh it was ok.\n\n...continues search for best pizza in the 169,UNK
13358,The pizza is better than any other choice you'll have after leaving marquee and may possibly save your life by soaking up all the liquor you've had. No sign but just follow the smell and the line of people coming out of the hallway from the marquee club exit.,UNK
13359,Horrible staff!!!! Bartender constantly asking me if I'm playing (for comp drinks). my husband being accused of picking up someone else's money by the pitboss. Worst casino experience in Vegas!!!!,UNK
13360,"An outstanding restaurant.  We arrived a bit early and had drinks in the lounge before dinner.  Once seated at our table, the service was excellent and our dinners (surf & turf aka lobster & steak) were all top shelf.  They have an excellent wine collection and their desserts and quite good as well.",UNK
13361,I'm updating to say this place has improved in both service and food quality.  And the value is there when compared to other sushi places in the city.,UNK
13362,"This will be a short review since my sister just reviewed it below and said pretty much everything I wanted to say already.\n\nOnly thing I disagree with is that the Pad See Ew and the roasted duck were the best! Duck was amazing, and very worth the price.",UNK
13363,"Touristy relic from the 80s that serves decent flavorful Mexican type foods and on the really cheap for lunches. The place needs to be madeover, the menu as well. But hey, its a good spot when you're jonesing for a tasty Burrito.",UNK
13364,So we arrived there for dinner yesterday after spotting it last week leaving walgreens . Dining room was empty and not one clean table available . Place was dirty so we can only imagine what the kitchen looks like . With that in mind we left and don't plan on ever going back .,UNK
13365,"Food is good but staff/service is HORRENDOUS. Every single time I go there they mess up my order, in my opinion they need to hire all new staff. And when I complained, I got attitude from the manager. Worst McDonald's.",UNK
13366,Sweet place.  Came here for the first time a few days ago and had a great lunch.  The caprese egg salad sandwich was fresh and full of flavor.  The coffee was good and the service was prompt.  Chill vibe- I will be back!,UNK
13367,"Nice location love the ladies. But food was just not that good tried their chicken pasta which was runny and just plain. Mushrooms weren't cooked thoroughly and the mashed potatoes were awful. I will come back just to give the chef another try. The only three things I loved was the ladies, TV's, and steak.",UNK
13368,"I've always been a bit underwhelmed at the food here, and as a result, the price has become a little more than I'd like for lunch. I always seem to spend around $10 for lunch. Not to say the food is bad, but it's just not great. Service is always good.",UNK
13369,First time visitor on New Years Eve. Was pleasantly surprised at how good it was. Much better than some of the chain Japanese restaurants. Service was great and all the meals we had were excellent and reasonable price.  Had filet scallops and chicken as main entree. Side dishes excellent also. Our chef was friendly and entertaining. Will return soon.,UNK
13370,This place needs help. I came for the batting cages. It looked closed when I pulled into the big parking lot. But at the end of the creepily quiet building is where we buy the tokens for the cages. I only saw two employees for this place. I so wish more people come here. It could be a real hot stop.,UNK
13371,"The service was great. The decor is nice. The Shashimi was lacking. I've had better at lower tier restaurants. \n\nI didn't have tappanyaki, so you can throw the baby out with the bath water.",UNK
13372,This place is so slow. Easily the slowest Jimmy johns I've ever been to. It seems very disorganized.,UNK
13373,I had a lunch there once. The food is ok but it's on the pricy side. I don't think I will be back.,UNK
13374,"I came here most importantly for the view of Bellagio fountain from the patio, and luckily I got a patio table!!! The food & service was decent as well. Make sure to make a reservation ahead of time. You can reserve very easily online.",UNK
13375,"I get a chili cheese dog from here on occasion - the price is right, and the food is decent enough.  I'll try some of the other fare from here in the future.",UNK
13376,well it was the best we found in charlotte in the first 4 hours. we met the hot guy at the bar and his hot d.j. fella. they didn't go home wth us. which pissed us off. \n\nso far charlette is making me angry and bored.,UNK
13377,Went there several times for buffet. They only have maybe 10 selections of fried dishes and some desserts that look old. \nHaven't tried anythin else there.,UNK
13378,Breakfast isnt worth the price. Jerry in the restaurant is not very froendly. Sidarish on the other hand goes out of his way to please.,UNK
13379,This place usually rocks but not tonight. Walked in and I was the only customer. The guy behind the counter said we'll be with you in a minute. I waited for more then a minute. The guy just stood there...I finally walked out.,UNK
13380,Worst restaurant during our entire stay in Vegas. Service and food was horrible. Our waiter gave us bad service. You're better off going to McDonalds. Very expensive.,UNK
13381,The lines begin early and even though I was there at 7:45. I did not get out until past 9 AM. I would bring things to do. The staff all look well put together and were friendly :),UNK
13382,"So after sitting for 30 min, the service is horrible, if u wanna pay for 39 dollArs for steak. So don't waste your time",UNK
13383,"Filthy, too busy, horrible layout for the playground area, and there are bees and wasps everywhere. The train and carousel are overpriced. Not a fun park.",UNK
13384,"I waited to write this review to let my nerves and emotions calm down, but in all honesty they have not. Worst experience ever. I'm just glad me and my son are alright.",UNK
13385,Terrific service in a comfortable environment and delicious Venezuelan food at a fair price.  Looking forward to a second visit... I wonder why more restaurant managers aren't this excited about their food?,UNK
13386,"Delicious food but terrible service. We waited for ages to place our order, ran out of water, then had to beg to pay the check. Most tables turned over while we waited for everything.",UNK
13387,The drinks are amazing!! But the places so bad from smoking and being old... its kinda a trade off.... I would go back if a group of friends were going but I wouldn't make it a point to want to go there with just me and the hubby!,UNK
13388,"Been here for years.  They have the BEST NACHOS in Phoenix.  If you're in the mood for a huge helping of chips, cheese, jalapenos, and all the rest, this is the place to come!\nThis is all I ordered and could not eat anything else for hours.",UNK
13389,"We got the Takoyaki which is octopus balls from Japan, glad to have finally tried it here in Las Vegas, The Ramen is good what I like about the menu is that it indicates the Noodle as thick or thin. What I want to come back for is the Tsukumen. Will give another update.",UNK
13390,"Great food and the staff was very nice!!! Good value as well. Definately try the bakudan if youre into hardcore japanese food. Opens late, we will stop by next time if we are looking for a late night meal.",UNK
13391,If you like piss food and piss slots come here you'll love it!!! I'd rather eat mcdonalds than the slime than serve here. Worst slots I've seen and I've been in Vegas a long time. I'd burn hundred dollar bills before I spend one of them here.,UNK
13392,"We stopped in for couple of drinks last night, the wife had the shark-nado a spicy blend of sweet and rum. I had the sazerac cocktail a nice lightly sweet bitter drink served up, very good considering I really only drink whisky neat. I really like the ambiance with the menus labeled hunger and thirst.",UNK
13393,"It took more than 45 minutes to get our food. When it finally arrived, 3 of our 4 meals were cold. No dishes were amazing - disappointing considering the higher than average price.",UNK
13394,not a good ole Mexican restaurant. \ncan't manage to make guacamole properly. enough said. \nToo touristy and I think I'm the only non white in the join other than the server/waitresses.,UNK
13395,"Decent local pub.  Food is mediocre...beer selection is not substantial.  Can get noisy and tight.  Beantown Tavern accross the parking lot is better, but only marginally.",UNK
13396,Betty ! \ni visit you every time i come to Vegas ! just to get 'bear claws' for breakfast and ice cream while i am there and \nto play on the Internet \n\nsometimes  you can be a little slow - even when there is no one in the place !  but i forgive you darlin !,UNK
13397,"Sadly I'm downgrading Rosati's. The more I have it the worse and worse it gets.  The crust is too much like cardboard for me.  And the ingredients are really, really cheap. \n\nRosati's its me, not you...well, its kind of you.",UNK
13398,"American/Italian macaroni and cheese is available as cheddar mac, pepper jack, mac or asiage blue mac yummy. Patrons also can choose a pasta 9 (gluten-free available) and a sauce and add ingrelients for 50 cent each and proteins for 1.50 each.",UNK
13399,Cool Place it has changed alot since I went there for the first time years ago.  still a cool place togo in and kill some time and see some high end toys.  I do want to try out their fountain shop though did not have time last time. I will try it on my next Vegas Run,UNK
13400,"Great atmosphere, out of ice and regular coke, and thermostat turned way down. Was bothered by solicitors handing out pamphlets while sitting down - how wierd! !?? The cooler started leaking during the meal, and started pooling water - yup time to leave. My hamburger was great though.",UNK
13401,Loads of fun to be had here. Fun for everyone who is willing to have fun. Even as an adult I find it just as fun. Staff is friendly. Decently priced. Course is big enough to get lost in. Will return.,UNK
13402,Horrible \nAgent was really pushy. I was looking for commercial business insurance.\nAgent kept trying to get me on plans I didn't need.\nAfter I found something cheaper and passed on there quote\n the agent sent me a rude email talking crap to me.\nWhat a joke.,UNK
13403,Horrible food. The server didnt even give us plates and forks. The duck fried rice is so disgusting.  It's so chewy and greasy. Worst food ive ever tasted.,UNK
13404,"cool bar , lots of games, kindve too pricey drinks for being so close to the strip.  terrible bartenders....the girl who books all the DJ's and bands is a huge asshole who stiffs them from time to time, so if you're an artist of any type, i urge you to boycott this place.",UNK
13405,"changed planes here on my way home from New Orleans. This airport was clean and seemed new. There was a Nathan's in my terminal so I got a delicious wiener before boarding. A pretty decent airport, much better than either Denver, Saint Louis or Philadelphia!",UNK
13406,How do you do a all white chicken teriyaki wrong? Go here! Very dry & bland. Already left with it to go... A few bites and it went in the trash.,UNK
13407,"we got food poisoning here - egg drop soup.  in addition to being contaminated, the food was poorly prepared and tasted terrible.  i am amazed that some people reviewed this place favorably.",UNK
13408,The worst green tea frappucino I ever had came from this location. They charged me 10.00 for a grande frap and a grande cup of coffee.,UNK
13409,Service sucks so bad here. Food is alright and drinks are pretty tasty. But this time it took our server forever to get us any thing to drink and take our food order. She checked on us once-we had to go up to the bar to get new drinks. Disappointed,UNK
13410,I don't know if people have really eaten here or not but it isn't all that great. The salsa is bland and the meats are not seasoned at all. I don't think we will be back.,UNK
13411,"So I ordered a carne asada quesadilla, having ordered quesadillas in many restaurants I was disappointed when I got home and I got a quesadilla no sour cream no salsa no guacamole just a plain dry quesadilla.  Also they are not very friendly so I have no reason to go back.",UNK
13412,If you're looking for a nice place to avoid the average club scene then it's the place to go. I'm not into country type of music so I waited until after 11pm for the more mix music and it was decent.,UNK
13413,Has this place ever heard of a mop? The floors are FILTHY! Can't you hire somebody to mop the floors? Every floor in this place was filthy. ALL OVER THE STORE!!!!!,UNK
13414,"We tried to go to Forequarter, but there was a two-hour wait, so instead we decided to try this place, where none in our party had been before. And what a huge treat! The food was divine, the service attentive, and the atmosphere was downright darling. We'll be back!",UNK
13415,"Are you serious?  Hooters sold enough hot wings to open a Hotel/ Casino/ Hooters?  Well, they hired enough *ahem* talent  to pawn off their mediocre wings across the country.  Gotta admit though that they have some hot waitresses here.  Food still sucks.  Might as well enjoy the view while I choke down the food.",UNK
13416,"This is a very busy place and not much room for sitting or hanging out. Still, Starbucks is Starbucks. Good coffee.",UNK
13417,San Fran based boutique hotel chain.  Kinda an oxymoron.  Their decor theme is an outrageously bright desert sunset which turned out to be the ugliest decor imagineable.  I think their flamboyant designer needs to lay off the acid trips before designing their next chain link.  Not an ounce of charm.,UNK
13418,I had my first Sonic burger yesterday.  It wasn't what I expected it to be but it was good.  The Sonic Blast w/ Reese's was damn good though!,UNK
13419,"Very old, dated and unbelievably smokey.  Our company had a conference there. The conference area was good but getting from the front door to the upstairs conference area was gross.",UNK
13420,"They use a marketing company to solicit calls. They call everyday, I've asked to be taken off their calling list to no avail. Now they call  eight times a day and hang up, would never use them if their marketing strategy is harassing people over the phone.",UNK
13421,Great beer selection and staff.  The bartenders are attentative and friendly and their sunday bloody mary bar is something else.  A great place to watch any type of sporting events since they have almost 20 TVs surrounding you.  Their outdoor patio is awesome.,UNK
13422,"This is great if you are in a hurry, they have slices and salads ready to go. Above average quality and a nice open space too. Perfect stop before or after catching a movie next door.",UNK
13423,I love this place! The staff is wonderful and they make you feel totally comfortable! They know what their doing and will answer any questions you possibly have; I had a ton! Laser treatment isn't a peach but it's fast and totally worth it.,UNK
13424,"My overall rating for this place is a  \""meh\"". Staff was not overly friendly or helpful.  They did not have any helpful signage in the store. They were not overly patient. Just an overall \""meh\"" experience.",UNK
13425,I stayed here during a business trip...older crowd and a little quiet but it was nice that I could play any game I wanted without a wait. I learned how to play three card poker and I made $350.00.,UNK
13426,"Too many extra costs for little benefit. 1/2 the pool was closed, extra cost for tables, extra cost for umbrellas, plus the $18 resort fee - better value elsewhere.",UNK
13427,"Yummy pizza that offers both delivery and carryout. Much better than most of the other chain pizza restaurants; I despise Papa John's, Pizza Hut, etc., but Hungry Howie's is a great place to get some tasty food.",UNK
13428,"No continental breakfast for $200.00 a night?! The pizza was good though. I would say just an okay hotel, not great.",UNK
13429,"A-OK describes the gyro to a 'T'. We ordered four of their lunch specials (sandwich, fries, drink for $6.99) and had them delivered. A great deal! Delivery was reasonable. I would recommend this place for a quick lunch.",UNK
13430,"Excellent thin crust pizza served in a pleasant rustic Tuscany style restaurant along with the Pizza we enjoyed a very nice caesar salad with anchovy and a fresh zesty citrus dressing\nThe wine list is also very good, heavy on Italian wines with some good by the glass specials\nService is professional & prompt",UNK
13431,The burgers are amazing and the other food does not disappoint!  Always looking forward to the latest Chef's special!,UNK
13432,"I love this restaurants food and was super excited about their delivery option. It's been two hours and my food still hasn't arrived and we've called twice! Dine in is ok, but avoid delivery!",UNK
13433,"Overall, an average Best Buy.  It does seem smaller than normal for a Best Buy.  The staff is average at best, but that is common among Best Buy experiences.  But when visiting Vegas, this is the store we usually frequent, when shopping for videos/CDs.",UNK
13434,This review is for the Mexican Restaurant.  It's pretty good.  The salsa bar is great.  Big portions.  I would give it 4 stars but the decor is old,UNK
13435,The staff at the restaurant was very rude and I will never return again. The food is nothing to right home about and service sucks. I also felt as if I was being discriminated against because of my race.,UNK
13436,"Its a fun place. There usually is an annoying line up, but the different atmospheres make it nice with the option to change bettween musics.",UNK
13437,They were packed so it took a bit to get breakfast but the staff really hustled and the coffee was very good for a diner. 'Joe' even came out to check on people who were waiting.,UNK
13438,"Just called the nurse's station phone lime provided on the web site to ask a few questions. Probably the rudest woman in Nevada to answer the phone. Could not believe what I was hearing. Called Thursday around 10:20 AM - January 1, 2015",UNK
13439,"This is a cool place with a great beer selection and it has a ton if potential to b a great spot - it's a bit pricey for it's out of date decor, filthy bathroom, and sticky tabletops.",UNK
13440,"Egg rolls were amazing.  I especially loved the sauce it came with.\nCame here because people swear up and down that their mac n cheese is the best.\nWell, not in my opinion. I ended up taking it to go and never even finished it.",UNK
13441,Burgers are good but be carefull with the sliders and toppings. They are super expensive. It will cost you like buying 2 big burgers but you only get 3 mini,UNK
13442,"Nice place, huge selection.  Nice people.  Onr th8ng they need is a PRIVATE place to to try on the wigs. Thanks guys.",UNK
13443,"Had a chicken sandwich with 'supposedly' large fries last week. Bland sandwich tasteless, fries were said to be large but they were so less that I cud count them on my fingers! I don't think I wil ever visit them again.",UNK
13444,"Quality of food is okay and with normal price. I had the eggs & bacon and the hash brown was greasy Service was also a very slow and there weren't more than 8 people at the whole place.\n\nThe staff was polite but need help on service, cooking and presentation of the dish they are serving.",UNK
13445,"Good service, but more of a \""Japanese flavor\"" to their food. Want excellent Hawaiian food? Go to Ross J's on sunset and mtn vista",UNK
13446,"After going to the wrong location, we arrived just before they were closing between lunch and dinner. The server made sure we didn't feel awkward about the timing, which was so nice!\n\nThe food was tasty and reasonably priced! If it wasn't so far away, we'd be back for sure!",UNK
13447,"I've never felt more disrespected in my life. The security guard outside of the restaurant was rude, inappropriate and incredibly racist and I will never return to this restaurant again. I hope you don't support this behavior either.",UNK
13448,Came because they claim to cut high tech auto keys. Not only did I not get a key cut but I was told they could not cut the key for my Honda. If you are going to advertise that you cut high tech keys then you should be able to.,UNK
13449,Nice place. Good food. Gorgeous view. Sunday thru Wednesday 1/2 price off all bottles of wine. Not a bad deal for a great wine list!!,UNK
13450,"It's fast, it's friendly and about as inexpensive as you can get in Desert Ridge.  Wasn't blown away by thier food, but I would go back.",UNK
13451,"Regular sports bar with a couple of unique amenities.  Large patio on the Scottsdale greenbelt.  Menu where every sandwhich has a corresponding salad version (essentially replace the bread with lettuce).  Lots of specials, and a fun birthday offer.  It's quite large with multiple sections, and televisions all around.",UNK
13452,"I had the sweet and spicy chicken, and loved it! This place is somewhat expensive, but you get a lot of food for the price.",UNK
13453,"Try the curry chips.  They are the best I've had & try them at every Irish Pub I go to.\n\nThe beer is tasty & if it's not too hot outside, the patio is great.",UNK
13454,"Champagne brunch was a big disappointment.  Cost $39.95 with unlimited champagne or bloody marys.  $31.95 without alcohol.  Food was nothing special and the selection was limited.  Your better off at Cravings in the Mirage.  There were no crab legs, no Kobe steak and no turkey.  They did have prime rib.",UNK
13455,"Can't go wrong with pizza, wings and beer. The staff were all very friendly .Good job Nino for keeping real down to earth with great food, and service.",UNK
13456,"Closed at 10:45 on Friday, not midnight as listed on Yelp. This was extremely inconvenient as I left a party venue early to make it there on time!",UNK
13457,Good food. We had cold yellow and red beet soup. It was ok. The beets needed to be cooked before purring it had really uncomfortable taste if raw beets. I had scallops - Off the wall good and my husband had steak frittatas. Amazingly melting in you mouth. Just like cotton candy. Loved it,UNK
13458,"Long wait time, Waited 45 minutes for order. I requested the pizza be well done, it was actually under cooked and soggy. Will never order from there again.",UNK
13459,"So we ordered pizza and wings both were tasty. We had our food delivered, they said 45 minutes and the food got here in a little less then 45 minutes! The driver was kind and polite. We will order from here again.",UNK
13460,I've been going here for years.  I use groupon most of the time. I never really had any complaints. Only thing I would change is the 10x13 picture to on optional 8x10 or more 5x7. I have a folder full of the 10x13s they are just too big for the wall.,UNK
13461,"i'd go here lots if i lived here. affordable prices (esp. happy hour), close to lots of stuff and the terasse is perfect for people watching. mediterranean menu items were simple and refreshing. perfect for a hot and humid day.",UNK
13462,Not safe \n\nlock on door doesn't work\n\nStaff is unhelpful\n\nThey made lots of mistakes\n\nEach mistake cost a few $$\n\nGo elsewhere,UNK
13463,I went before a game in April and It  was awful!  The food is terrible and way overpriced...  Never ever eat at this place!,UNK
13464,Great delicious burgers and shakes. A bit pricey of course.I didn't have to leave my hotel for a great burger.,UNK
13465,"Way over priced. Food waa okay, but I had a salad with four shrimp on top and a bottle of mineral water. Came to $20! For salad and water!",UNK
13466,Friendly staff and great options for sauce. But quality of food of comparable to cafeteria food. Feel like Im eating at high school again.,UNK
13467,"Been here twice in the last three months. Chicken and sides are OK, employees are very friendly, but when I ask twice for BBQ sauce for my strips and don't get it...\n\nCan't speak to the interior cleanliness as I did drive-thru both times, but outside looks decent.",UNK
13468,"Bread and Butter perfect name. Don't go here on a Diet! Not much for salads, like none which is what I was hoping for. Moca coffee ok nothing special, my mean was ok, not that impressed. small resturant with limited seating.",UNK
13469,I've heard good things: http://en.maplaza.ca/adresse_des_comerces-rep-addr,UNK
13470,Warm decor and friendly service!\n\nOur waiter was not kidding when he said the portions were big! There were four grown adults in our party and we could not finish the fettuccine pasta and pepperoni pizza we ordered.\n\nOnly gripe was that the pizza was extremely oily.,UNK
13471,Many choices! King crab legs are always attractive. Desserts are good. The GARDEN is very beautiful and good for date ;-),UNK
13472,This is also another cool little gaming bar. I like this place because of the no smoking and when the weather is nice they can open the doors completely so you can enjoy the nice temps.,UNK
13473,"Had very high expectations but wS disappointed.  Beer selection was excellent, enjoyed the ambiance and layout of the restaurant.  Burgers were disappointing, also didn't like that you had to pay for any dipping sauces for the appetizers.  Sweet potato fries were very good and the speed of service was good.",UNK
13474,Two of the the soups look like they've been sitting there all day your server never even greets you or gets anything for you so why tip?,UNK
13475,"The chocolate factory tour is about 100 feet of glass wall where you can see a few employees and machines.  Definaltely not worth the $60 round trip taxi tour.  The cactus garden is pretty sad too.\n\nThere is one highlight, they do give you a sample piece of chocolate, a very expensive piece of chocolate",UNK
13476,We loved the food. The service was good and we were grateful to be seated right away. We have eaten Mexican and TexMex food while living and visiting in Texas.  The food was very good and authentic.,UNK
13477,This is the absolute worst McDonald's I have ever been to in my entire life! This place was filthy. Nearly every empty table was littered and in our 30 minutes there no one came to clean the dining area. Owner should be ashamed and management fired!,UNK
13478,"The rudest person answered the phone he was  mean, acted like I was bothering him, he was short, raised his voice, and had few smart remarks.   After five minutes of outing up with moron, I hung up on him!  He was insulting and was wrong person to have working the phone.   We got pizza from another pizza shop!",UNK
13479,Not sure what place all the reviewers are writing about ..... This place was horrible!!!! How does an Irish food place have awful Corned Beef and Cabbage???? Fish and chips were equally bad as well. Had to go to Jersey Mikes after.,UNK
13480,"After canceling their service over 2 months ago because I moved and calling several times to request my credit balance be mailed out to me, I find out that they transferred my balance to someone else's account! \n\nVery incompetent, please consider better options before Cox.",UNK
13481,"Within an hour of being home after eating there, the three of us had food poisoning and got SO sick!  Never eat there!  Horrible!",UNK
13482,"Not a good restaurant!\nNice atmosphere. The food is over priced, not very good, and it's not even served on a plate. Really?\nI was disappointed enough in it that I decided to post a review!",UNK
13483,"My fianc\u00e9 and I went on a Friday night and we were big fans! Our burgers were fantastic, the fries were good and the beer was great! The service was friendly and quick considering how busy they were, the atmosphere was nice, and the drink menu was great!",UNK
13484,"This place was disappointing. The Service was excellent, but my pasta was extremely salty and I couldn't help thinking that although the others in my group enjoyed their meals,it wasn't good enough for the prices. They did give a complimentary dessert to apologize for the salty dish which i appreciated. Probably wont go back though..",UNK
13485,The cheesecake was one of the best I have ever had if not the best xD.  Their prices aren't too high and the service is spot on.,UNK
13486,"Love this place! Staff is super friendly and work fast during the lunch and dinner rush. Food is amazing. The satay is my favorite appetizer and it's much better than the one at Thai Taste. They always give you a mountain of food, especially when you get take out. If you love Thai food, definitely come here!",UNK
13487,My wife and I  came here for a quick lunch and were disappointed. The breakfast burrito was bland and the mushroom burger was made with canned mushrooms.\nThe service was extremely slow and we had to wait 20 minutes for our check,UNK
13488,"We stopped by to check out the happy hour specials\n\nThey have a great draft selection on tap, and the beer was extremely cold.\n\nI ended ip getting the Mom's Pot Roast, fantastic!! \n\nWe will be back",UNK
13489,"This place is great! The burgers are amazing and the coleslaw is fantastic. 4 stars because it's pretty pricey, but worth it for a fabulous meal.",UNK
13490,Service was horribly slow and not very friendly.... Would NOT suggest eating here.. 50 minutes and still not cooking and no refil!,UNK
13491,"Fantastic, fanciful French cuisine. Loved the foie gras and sliders. Ambience is modern with swings that serve as seats for the side tables. Service was a bit slow at first but the waiters were very friendly and charming. English was also widely spoken by most of the waiters which was convenient for us tourists.",UNK
13492,"Wow. Staff work hard, but service slow. Ordered edamame and mini crab cakes. I've been ripped off in airports before but this takes it to a new level. Super small quantities of poor quality food. Would not return.",UNK
13493,Very visually appealing. The sound is good for shows. Food and drinks are expensive as with all the new vegas places. Bring your wallet and plan on spending alot for a good time.,UNK
13494,Went in on Saturday to get a full set of nails. I asked for gel clear polish which I did not get but was charged for. And all the nails on my right hand are lifting off already and its only been two days!,UNK
13495,"Pizza Parma delivers through GrubHub, which is the primary reason I ordered sandwiches from them. BBQ chicken was ok. The bread is a little more on the burnt than toasted side, leading it to be dry. The value is good. The 20\"" sandwich was about $11.",UNK
13496,I wanted to like this place. They play oldies inside and I think that's cute. I dunno though- my meal was all fried and grease. Chicken strips and those cheese balls. Maybe if id ordered something else :-/ no urge to try it out again.,UNK
13497,"After a recent dinner I am less enthused by the food.  Curds are good but the rest of the menu is extremely heavy and not very high quality.\n\nDrinks, location, appetizers all nice but I will avoid it for an actual meal from now on.",UNK
13498,I was going to give higher as i did like my room. It was comfortable.. But now it is 1230am and they are doing sone kind of construction STILL outside my room.. Yuck.. Cant stay here again,UNK
13499,Been going here for 23 years... Never clean... Last night was the worst filth I've ever experienced and may never return. If the bathrooms and eating area is that bad... What's going on in the kitchen?,UNK
13500,I lived just a few blocks from Indie over the summer and it was my favorite spot to take care of my morning emails and read through the news. A great spot to warm up before your day or meet for delicious waffles with a friend! The staff is super friendly and have great suggestions for drinks.,UNK
13501,"A ok it is.\nI thought the food was all good- but not great.\nI was NOT impressed with the portion sizes, and would have preferred a bit more food in my tummy when I left.\n\nBut it was ok.",UNK
13502,Locals are really nice! Come here for the local dive. The food should be avoided. Dining room is dead for a reason.,UNK
13503,"Standard Bojangles food. Nice atmosphere, like a carpeted foodcourt. There are other restaurants nearby (and a DQ) so you have choices.",UNK
13504,"if you can get in for free somehow, that's the way to go. otherwise, i'm over it. and don't even get me started on the drink prices. other than that, we always have a great time dancing the night away here.",UNK
13505,"I hate this place so much! The smell of burnt fry oil consumes you when you arrive. Then we sat at the bar which smelled even worse and tiny fruit fly's everywhere. If you are reading this and you are the health inspector, please drop in and give this place a much needed wrist slap.",UNK
13506,Still Dirty.\nStill Overhyped for what it is.\nStill Overpriced for what you get.\nStill sick of hearing about it.\nCookie still good ~ big whoop...still.,UNK
13507,"My husband and I went in August 2013...the service was really good and the manager is a great guy.\n\nFood was terrible, but I guess you go for the views.",UNK
13508,"Def a good scene to have in Vegas that offers locals a different option other than he strip or locals casino. Hipster vibe, good beer selection.",UNK
13509,Never seen so many desperate people queuing on a busy roundabout - so dangerous.  We're only talking doughnuts but I guess you are speaking to a nation that eat fried mars bars.  Surely doughnuts are not the latest Scottish craze?!,UNK
13510,"Maybe not the most romantic restaurant for dinner, but offers an amazing lunch and has great drink offers from the quaint, little bar.  Very good Phad Thai and Spicy Basil Chicken...  Have a Flo's Bloody Mary while you are there.  Great food!",UNK
13511,"This review is for the crepes. I tried both the dessert and savory crepes during my visit in vegas. While both were decent, it was definitely not worth the $12. If you are coming here I suggest getting the gelato",UNK
13512,"Service was very good. Our waitress was nice and stopped by a lot. The meat skewers came fast and furious. Problem was, the meat was not that great and the \""salad\"" bar was okay, but nothing special.",UNK
13513,"Great and quick service, the fries and sandwich were delicious! I've never been to Chicago, but I've had Portillo's in California and I think this is just as good, if not better!",UNK
13514,"Great club! Patrons be weary . . . We attended this club when Diddy was hosting and everybody knows ain't no party like a Diddy party. Guys I would highly recommend bottle service, a table, and a trendy suit.",UNK
13515,"Tried to eat there once, got sat at a table, picked out a beer..enjoyed the artwork all around...but no one ever came to take my order! I was in plain view of the hostess, and the only person of 8 in the place that wasn't eating, yet. I got up and left.",UNK
13516,"They got two out of three orders wrong, and the service was horrible.  It took over 20\nminutes to get our check.  I am done with this Cheesecake Factory.",UNK
13517,$7 dollars for a luke warm Corona never even offered a menu and the bartender carded the girl who sat down next to me after he noticed he didn't know how to make what she wanted.,UNK
13518,Yuck again. Reminded me of BAD high school cafeteria pizza. Aiello's and Mineo's are both better,UNK
13519,Don't order the gluten free. Obviously they don't know that you have to bake the crust first!  Under the cheeses my pizza had the consistency of oatmeal ! Yuck !,UNK
13520,"4.5 stars\nThe menu is pleasant, the food was big in size and taste.  The service was minimal.  The tables had crumbs on them.  But, for the mall it definitely beat the alternative.",UNK
13521,"Came 2 days in a row. Thursday great service, today, rude rude rude.   Doesn't even matter about the food when you feel like you're bothering the staff.",UNK
13522,"Every time I go to this Jack In The Box I get approached by a homeless person, either inside or outside.\n\nI will stop going to this location. Nothing wrong with the food or service.  \n\nSave for people begging for money.",UNK
13523,"Pizza was good, but nothing special.  Seriously overpriced - every topping is another $2 and they double charge you if you do half and half with different toppings.",UNK
13524,"While the price may lure you in, food poisoning will certainly keep you away. Basically don't get anything after 10 PM that isn't deep fried or you'll run the risk of getting a sloppily cooked, half-raw pile of poison.",UNK
13525,"cheap chinese food here, large portions, there dumplings here are very good. 10 for like 5$ or something. good deal. There chicken cashew was okay, F/R is good. everything else was good, but nothing else stuck out that amazed me. There sesame chicken was edible and taste good, but they could do better.",UNK
13526,Two stars (even though I couldn't be stranded too far from a bathroom for a couple of days after eating here) for the lack of decent thai restaurants in Madison.,UNK
13527,"Exceptional soup, and great value lunch. We'd heartily recommend a visit. We summed it up: \""the Whiski Rooms is a tremendous addition to the Edinburgh lunchtime circuit. We'd recommend you head along soon, to sample their superbly superb soupy soup delights.\""",UNK
13528,It's a bit old fashioned and not a big variety of rolls.  The place was dead when we visited which didn't help the ambiance. Overall the rolls had little flavor and were bland. It wasn't bad but i don't think I'd go back.,UNK
13529,Great Ribs & Jambalaya! Nice atmosphere with great entertainment. Excellent friendly\nservice located right outside the casino at Madalay Bay so you can gamble once you finish eating & drinking. Overall the place is really cool the food is awesome & the drinks are great no skimping on liquor at all!!!,UNK
13530,The staff is nice the place is nice but it is WAY overpriced.  They take advantage of people in emotional states and pick their pockets.  Also way under staffed for emergcies,UNK
13531,"I had a Valentine's dinner here, and it was pretty much the atmosphere that made the meal for me. The food definitely wasn't bad, but for the price it definitely wasn't the most amazing Italian food I'd ever had. Like I said, very nice atmosphere, very cozy and classic feeling.",UNK
13532,"I've been ordering here for years. Always had good experiences, except for tonight. The manager was extremely rude about me receiving cold pizza.  She definitely needs more training and needs to be kept off the phone!",UNK
13533,Super helpful staff which is knowledgeable about their products and can offer advice on how to use ingredients. \n\nThey stock a lot of spices and rices. You can also pick up specialty ingredients such as tamarind and Indian desserts. Kohli also sells some hot foods to go such as samosas.,UNK
13534,"Food was decent- nothing that blew us away. Rice on the sushi seemed soggy.  Service was so-so. We felt rushed, timing of food was bad, and staff wasn't as knowledgable on the menu as I would expect for a place that has a lot of hype in this area.",UNK
13535,Quick in and out. Soda's any size 79\u00a2 always. gas is reasonably priced at this location. kids working the counter are always very polite and eager to help.,UNK
13536,Must-go for brunch in Vegas.\n\nCorned beef hash. Never really was a fan but this place was awesome!\n\nGood service. Good company.\n\nGood times.,UNK
13537,"Worst place to eat, food doesn't have any flavor , I had lasagna ,smells and tasted bad, my son had spaghetti with meat balls,, ..  Bad, bad choices .The worst  way to spend your money.",UNK
13538,Was excited to get some Pita Jungle. Drove 15 minutes from our house because website said they were open till 10 pm. Pulled in to parking lot at 8:47 pm to find the employees locking doors and closing shop. The door even said 10:30 am to 10 pm. Very disappointing. Mist likely will not be returning.,UNK
13539,"It's cool. It's free if you're staying here. And unless you're willing to fork out $$$ for the cabanas, there isn't much places to chill out. It's quite crowded. I'd prefer some other pools to just lounge.",UNK
13540,Dr. Ohriner is very nice and my family and I always get accurate prescriptions but the wait time is so long. The price is right and the frame selections are good which is why we keep coming back. I just wish they would do something about the wait times. They aren't the only people whose time is valuable.,UNK
13541,Best quality of food restaurant that I've had in the Gilbert area. I'm from the east coast and finding that its hard to find decent food around here. This place is just simple good food.,UNK
13542,"If you want to be pushed to the end of the line, this is your place, Linda and Tina along with Larry will push customers into chairs to wait \""5\"" min. or let you soak for 30!\nSun City Crowd.....Have at it!",UNK
13543,Service was good but the food sucked. Chicken was way too salty so sent it back decided to get dolmades. They came out water logged. Yelp reviews were good for this place maybe their chef is just off today.,UNK
13544,"Nope, this isn't the real deal. You want a real fish taco? Head to the Baja or the California coast. BUT, locals rave about this place. If you don't have any point of reference, then apparently it's highly recommended. It redeems itself in cold brew.",UNK
13545,"This is ok for Boulder City Asian food, but it's definitely not anything special when compared to a good Asian restaurant anywhere else. The service is not great, the food is not very flavorful and my picky husband said \""it just tastes like cafeteria food\"". Probably won't be coming back.",UNK
13546,"The food here looked great.  After reading several great reviews we decided to head in.  Specifically to try the knots.  They are really delicious.  The biggest problem i had was the smell of smoke in the building.  I am pretty sensitive to second hand smoke and of all the casinos on Freemont, this is definitely the worst.  Yuck!",UNK
13547,Pamela's was awsome I went there just about a year ago exact and I had flapjacks and chorizo   and the food came as soon as we ordered it meaning very fast can't go wrong with it even with an out of towner like myself!,UNK
13548,"Ate here with my fianc\u00e9 late one evening.  Excellent restaurant...delicious food and a nice wine list.  Ambiance was very nice...classy, elegant.",UNK
13549,"Solid healthy meal was enjoyed at this location. The large bowl was only $7 and the white meat chicken was very good quality and was plentiful. Needed an extra teriyaki sauce, but will get that next time. Could use more veggies, but overall a great choice.",UNK
13550,"This place is really fun and eclectic.  The servers look like a mix between hipsters and homeless, but the food is amazing and the service is fantastic.  I felt right at home and will definitely be back.",UNK
13551,"Awesome set up! I love the river with the boats carrying sushi!  It was so much fun picking my dishes from the never-ending stream of sushi! Great service too! I usually dislike sushi, but I thoroughly enjoyed what I got. Still pricy, but then again, it IS sushi.",UNK
13552,"After sitting at the table for 10+ minutes we were finally acknowledged...when our food arrived, the kids burrito was super spicy, my rice and beans were cold and our drinks sat empty...for a long time.  Nothing special - from the service to the food....no need to go back.",UNK
13553,"Never got to try the food because nobody made eye contact or tried to take my order, REALLY??? for fast food, MAJOR FAIL!!!",UNK
13554,"Racist club.  Said a black friend couldnt get in cause of his hat, when we said he'd take it off they still said no.",UNK
13555,"It's a pretty good cheese steak, but they are hit or miss.  I have been here at least 10 times in the past five years, and it is a little bit different every time.  Sometimes really good, other times not so great.  But the bun is always spot on for authentic Philly Cheese Steak style.",UNK
13556,We came here both before and after a show for the lounge.  Had drinks before and food after.  The rabata lobster was good but thought $20 was a bit steep for a small lobster tail. The drinks were also pricey but well made. We found sitting at the bar more comfy and inviting than the lounge seating.,UNK
13557,"My husband and I both ordered pasta, and we both ended up with food poisoning, the sauce was super salty and, something was cross contaminated or under cooked for as sick as we both ended up.",UNK
13558,"Very detailed and nice presentation... a little bit pricey for Vegas. It's unlikely I'll eat there again, but it's worth it to try it for a special occasion.",UNK
13559,The people here are super friendly and nice. Yhe reason I gave only three stars is one their liquid flavors was missing somethin.  I think if they remixed a few  flavors it would be a little better. And the second reason is that their liquid is pricey. Like 21 bucks for one bottle.,UNK
13560,"Pretty expensive compared to Ghandi's just down the street.  Food was fine, but not wonderful.  A bit nicer ambience than most Indian places",UNK
13561,Food is very good - a bit higher for Vietnamese but worth it for the venue and the food - love the d\u00e9cor - service a bit slow but they just opened so we will try again - we love this type of fresh Asian food - thanks - we made it to the movie on time for hubby's birthday last Monday.,UNK
13562,I just don't get it.  I read all these reviews and I was expecting some delicious dinner.  Instead what I got was what could be found in any kitchen in the county.  Under-seasoned and over-cooked meat and potatoes.  Obviously Quivey's Grove really DOES cater to the midwestern palate.,UNK
13563,Meh....decent Filibertos knockoff but the place feels like a major health hazard considering how new it is.\n\nJust think Filibertos with less quality control and smaller portions.,UNK
13564,"My fianc\u00e9e got her wedding dress here! The selection is unique, outrageous, and well worth a look. They have some very strange looking clothing here, but mixed in are some gems. Their clerk was very helpful and polite, and made us feel welcome.",UNK
13565,"Unlike it's line, I'm going to keep this short.  Tasty but small, expensive and slow.  Maybe worth going back every now-n-then for a date night dessert but no more frequent than that.",UNK
13566,"We had dinner @ Excalibur buffet.  I would say it is good has all sorts of salad, pasta and carving roast beef, sausage and chicken.  It also has all sorts of wonderful dessert.",UNK
13567,"Jersey Mike's is probably one of the best if not the best chain sub shops in Charlotte. The meats and breads are always freshly sliced and super tasty. This particular store is very well ran. The staff is extremely friendly. They are always polite, professional, and fast.",UNK
13568,"Every time time I schedule services with Total Bliss there is an issue; services requested not being scheduled,  messing up my appointment times, different technician than told.  Used to be a quality place to go to. 3 times is enough, the techs are great....which why I went. The front desk definitely needs to be addressed.",UNK
13569,It could be that I went here on a slow night (Tuesday) but I wasn't a fan. Good selection of beers though.,UNK
13570,"Staff sucks, just plan rude the older lady has such an attitude. Food was blah, nothing  special about it. Won't be going here anymore.",UNK
13571,Cool and hip bar with great d\u00e9cor and art display. Great outdoor space to gather with a group of friends. The menu is interesting and def. worth a try.,UNK
13572,Great new sandwich spot in old town. I went there for the first time today. Sandwiches are around $10 but they are huge and really tasty. I would recommend it to any sandy lovers.,UNK
13573,I've been here a few times and the food is always great!  Come early on the weekends because they are busy. The only downside is that my apartment's plumbing always gets overwhelmed by all the pooping my friends and I have to do afterwards.,UNK
13574,"Nothing impressive, DJ spins the same music like every other DJ around here. They were letting people in wearing tennis shoes and baseball caps. Service was okay, nothing special. First and last time.",UNK
13575,"Terrible bone in ribeye, let's see how the filet is.\n\nFilet was perfect.  The manager tried to convince me that well done was medium rare.\n\nOnce thing I know is steaks.",UNK
13576,"This place, I don't know, maybe I am prejudiced after going to Italy this summer but the food (specifically the lasagna) is just so plain and, well, bad.",UNK
13577,My wife and I went here last night.  The food was very good but the arepas can be a bit pricey.  The business was very clean and the man who helped us was nice with good recommendations.  We will go back very soon once we finish our leftovers.  Thank you.,UNK
13578,"Filthy store, terrible selection, only two checkout lines open.  Absolutely the worst grocery I've ever walked into.  The store needs to be demolished and rebuilt -- with new employees.  Better selection and prices at a drugstore or a convenience store.",UNK
13579,"A fun place to hangout and shop, it's pretty much like every other mall shopping. Except the fact you can buy some booze and walk around with it. And definitely more on the mid scale of shopping prices.",UNK
13580,"Just stopped in for a few beers with a few friends and we were met with friendly staff, a moderate selection of brews, and a relaxing atmosphere to enjoy each others' company. The prices were reasonable as well. I'll probably be back to try out their menu in the future.",UNK
13581,The ramen was too salty for my taste. I can't tell if the ingredients were tasty.  The saltiness masked or overwhelmed everything.  Too bad.  Nice place and good service.,UNK
13582,"Love the atmosphere and our server, Tracee was so kind and enthusiastic about the food! Our Mac and cheese nom noms were really tasty. Salmon burger and Caprese burgers were great!",UNK
13583,Ok so it's advertised $0.99 coffee yet I get charged regular pice what am I being charged for the sugar too. Employees reak of cigarette smoke. Very unpealing. Who wants to eat a doughnut or drink coffee with a side of smoke. Come on managers have your employees spray something on.,UNK
13584,"This place is really really budget and that is the truth, It is an old hotel, it has that strong smoke smell everywhere, but there are low limit tables and its a clean place to crash after you have partied all night. The cilent is mostly older adults and the food options are dismal.",UNK
13585,Very quaint but very small. Not somewhere i would visit again. It was a nice stroll and had a great view.,UNK
13586,"I purchased a Groupon. I called and emailed several times, got no response. I am very disappointed by the poor customer service, because I was really excited about this deal and Nelly seemed well-rated.",UNK
13587,"Be very careful,  they don't  listen to what you say when you decline coverage. Check EVERYTHING  before  you sign it, as they will slip it in even if you told them that you do not want it. The car was nice, but needed washing.",UNK
13588,The worst wait staff I have experienced in a long time. Felt compelled to write a review. Need new management!  Hurry!  Not worth visiting. A shame - my experience with this chain had been good...,UNK
13589,"Attached to the Capital Seafood restaurant. This place is a pass. $6.35 for pho, $7.29 for a large bowl. The noodle wasn't good, the broth was ok, and the place was uninspired. \n\nGo to another pho place.",UNK
13590,"Dont come here unless you want your personal items stolen given a two bit story about how they will reply to your incident report within 30 days and never hear from the hotel again.  Several calls and several months later, lets just say I decided not to hold my breath.",UNK
13591,Pizza is not very good and the staff lets you sit for long periods with out help. I know a lot of people that like this place but if I am going to have a meal that is not the healthiest then at least I want it to taste pretty outrageous. Will not go here again!,UNK
13592,I sent an email thru the Mastro website to let them know I got food poisoning at one of their restaurants. No response from them yet. I guess the restaurant doesn't care about their customers...,UNK
13593,I don't know if its the time I'm going but the attitudes are unbelievable. I cannot express how rude Tasha was to me. Which is fine because frankly i didn't need it anyways. Needless to say i will not go back .,UNK
13594,"Decent sushi joint, but the quality of their rolls was not as good as their old town location.  Definitely try the garlic edamame appetizer - it does not disappoint.  For a premium roll, the \""Las Vegas\"" is incredible.",UNK
13595,It's a great place to run into people you might know. I am sad they don't have the tangurittas anymore. Good selection of local beers but not cheap. Food is great. The MAC and cheese is awesome. And the fittest.,UNK
13596,"Well I ordered the street tacos & were great. Very disappointed about the shrimp nachos, we didn't like those & obviously were expecting great nachos from Nacho Daddy. What really bothered us though was the tap water that we ordered, it was disgusting so make sure you actually order a drink if you go to this place",UNK
13597,Joe D.  please contact me about service on 22 Feb.  I can't contact you other than via an update.\n\nmitchkotula(at sign)yahoo(dot)com,UNK
13598,"Slow, slow, slow. And not a useful corporate center. Waited 15 minutes in line to be told they couldn't help me. Overall AT&T is the most frustrating company to work with, I've never been so limited with regards to rights to things that I actually pay for.",UNK
13599,"There is a lot of food on the plate, but it is really just average. The Bloody Mary was fabulous, but nothing about the food would make me want to come back again.",UNK
13600,"Macayos has great Lunch time Specials! I had the Chicken Fajitas which comes with sour creme, guacamole and salsa and only 9.99! They were delicious! They also make very good Magaritas with different specials!The atmosphere is very Rocky Point and we love the decorations very festive!",UNK
13601,"Food bland, they made us Guacamole because if the reviews, but we had to ask for lemon and we also put extra salt.   Would not go back.",UNK
13602,"Great atmosphere with ok (the jerk pork was good, but it seemed to be missing that extra kick of cinnamon; the korean style wings and poke were very good) and probably a little overpriced food.",UNK
13603,"This is my all time favorite Starbucks. Great location, super outside seating, really friendly staff; truly feels like your home away from home!",UNK
13604,Friendly service at this location but this is the second time the juice has been like water and that from two different location and it doesn't vap right at all its like they made it thinner so you go threw it faster or there using cheaper juice they have now lost my business for good,UNK
13605,Car washes are good. BUT I wouldn't get my car services here.  My wife did and they put the wrong oil filter in which made her car leak and the whole thing took way longer than they quoted.,UNK
13606,Fun atmosphere but not as kid-friendly as other places in the area.  The wait-staff is hot but not overly friendly.  Better for happy hour and late night madness for 20-somethings...and food is just okay!,UNK
13607,"Not bad for the price but def had a lot going on inside. I'm used to really really great Greek food so maybe I'm bias. Just wasn't up to the \""best Greek\"" food name as I was hoping.",UNK
13608,"Took 45 min to get 2 veggie dishes. They told me \""they are packing it up\"" for 20 min when I asked for my money back they finally had the order ready. It was average. Too oily and way to spicy for the number I ordered. Used to be a good place needs better staff",UNK
13609,"This is one of my favorite casinos to gamble in (not that I gamble much anyways).  The gambling floor is huge, and the cielings are tall.  It's a good way to keep me feeling great while losing my money.",UNK
13610,"Food was okay, drinks were good, DJ played unusual mix which I appreciated but there is nowhere to dance and the crowd/ambience is relaxed so it was an odd combination.  I might return, but it is not a favorite.",UNK
13611,"Delivery fast but the food was not fresh......chicken fried rice was ok, orange chicken good but cold, chow mien cold!",UNK
13612,Staff is rude food is not good. I have been there a few times and have had to take fries back because they were so old or had to go get the rest of my order. Go to another one much better service and better food,UNK
13613,"Was about to order delivery,dinner for one, (bf took the car to work) BUT your order has to be over 15 dollars! Guess I'll just have to pick up some other day looks like pizza night :(",UNK
13614,Food is great. Love the skirt Steak and the guacamole is fabulous. A must stop whenever u are in mandalay bay.,UNK
13615,"Solid beers, nothing exceptional but better than I was expecting to find out in AZ. The black bean burger was super tasty.",UNK
13616,"I lived in Germany for three years so I can expertly review this :-). Food was delicious, portions were huge, salad bar was beyond fresh and lots of variety to include German specialties. Would def go back again.",UNK
13617,The tacos were delish.  The way to order was too long.  People were everywhere so I was starting to get a headache from just trying to focus and wait patiently in line.,UNK
13618,"I ate here 19 October 2009. I had the chicken wrapped in it skin, an order of pig cheek, and the house special home made tofu. The day's special was half cold tofu and half warm tofu. All was wonderful. What a cozy place with an absolutely wonderful staff. They truly made the dining experience special.",UNK
13619,"Ok, so I had never even been here until about 2 weeks ago. Talk about M&M overload! But that is the point, right?! There are four floors of M&M merchandise. Very cool; and the whole place smells like chocolate. Yum. Fun place.",UNK
13620,"not good when I went back when they first open, but I heard that they have gotten better. Still, I will not even waste my time going back and trying anything form there.",UNK
13621,"I really wanted to like this place, because I think that she is adorable.   It was on the pricey side for very simple food.  I was expecting more complex menu revelations, butt it was very basic stuff.",UNK
13622,Amazing price for decent rooms.  But don't plan on spending more than 30 minutes in the casino as it is a secondhand smoke cesspool.,UNK
13623,A good option for watching sport on the big screenm pint prices not horrendous yet and a decent range of ales. I particularly liked the fact there's a framed photo of one line-up of The Exploited amidst the decoration on one wall of the back room.,UNK
13624,"This place takes everything that is lame about Scottsdale and wraps it into one neat little package in Phoenix.  I was so excited for a new bar in the hood, but then this showed up.  Bad food, plastic people, crappy music, too sterile.  Pretty poopy.",UNK
13625,"My husband and I got shrimp and fish tacos. They were bland, nothing special. I don't understand what the hype is about.",UNK
13626,"I'm pretty sure the burger made me sick.  I ordered it medium, it came medium rare and I ate it anyway.\n\nThis rating is for the front as I didn't know there was a back and was not going to spend the big bucks on a steak by myself.",UNK
13627,I read the good reviews  and decided to go try it out. not to impressed the pizza was just ok. The pizza wasnt cheesy. I probably won't visit them again .,UNK
13628,I had a nice shopping experience here. The racks were organized according to size and style. It was easy for me to maneuver around the store and overall I thoroughly enjoyed myself shopping here. I definitely will come back again.,UNK
13629,CMU food truck. \nRice is dry and old. Clumped together. \n\nChicken and vegetable  - has only vegetable \n\nShould have gone with General Tso,UNK
13630,"It's your typical coffee shop. The bathrooms were clean and service friendly. We did have a guy come in and try to sell us stuff, saying he was a wholesaler which was annoying. Thankfully he didn't try the hard sell. Otherwise the place was fine.",UNK
13631,The Nugget was good to play a few games and drink. I think thats where I learned not to play craps and not be the only one there.,UNK
13632,Terrible!  We had awful service and worse food.  Like having a used car salesman for a waiter.  I ended up with food poisoning.  Wouldn't recommend to anyone.,UNK
13633,"First time coming here but won't be my last.  Although they have a limited amount of food options what makes the difference is the taste and preparedness of the food, absolutely delicious.  I recommend the sticky brown rice with chicken added in it, mouth watering",UNK
13634,"Servers are very polite but chips are stale, salsa has great taste though. Carnitas are very tender and portions are suitable. Place is kind of small and cramped.",UNK
13635,"I agree with what others have said: it's a shame it's not better because it's such a cute place.  Sadly it's also expensive with less-than-alright food, and slow service. Went once, but never again.",UNK
13636,This is a great sandwich shop and the owner is so personable.  There is soon to be 20 of these restaurants in California.  Many in the San Diego area.  One currently in Beverly Hills.,UNK
13637,Last night I called Green Cab to come out to a location on East Washington Ave. below liberty tax.The dispatcher said nothing about the long wait-over an hour.Also green cad drove right pass me and never stopped!Plus they never called me.they had my number and asked for it.NEVER again.,UNK
13638,"Can you really dislike Slices? You have 53 drunk people wanting pizza and they deliver and deliver it in good time. Probably not the best pizza in town, but good.",UNK
13639,"The BEST fries in town! All other items are very good, everything is fresh and hot which is a plus @ a buffet. Been here for over 20 years, they must be doing something right.",UNK
13640,"Very average sushi chain. The food came out a little too fast, and the rolls looked hastily made. Taste was average. They do have good happy hour deals though!",UNK
13641,"I generally avoid any type of chain but decided to make an exception and was glad I did. The Thai coconut curry was exceptionally good, I was really surprised. Think I will have to make an exception to my rule and come back here again.",UNK
13642,Went to Vanity  on Friday night. Worst music set by a DJ at any club in Vegas that i have ever been too. This DJ needs to go on iTunes and download better shit. I've been to many clubs in Vegas and by far this was saddest of them all. We left thank God we got in for free!!!,UNK
13643,i enjoyed the visit.  the lake was a pleasant surprise.  went for lunch and ordered the 1 entry with rice and beans with fried ice cream.  i thought everything was yummy and filling.  the ice cream was topped with carmel!  would go back.,UNK
13644,Nice looking place.  Too bad you can't judge a book by it's cover.  The more you like the looks the more disappointed you will be when you get into the food.  Nice looking place tho.....,UNK
13645,"A nice place for lunch or dinner. However, on two occasions employees had brought children to work which is not a good idea at all.   The music is always a real pleasure--not loud or intrusive--very pleasant.  The food is good.",UNK
13646,I went to Dr Maebin because dr. Brown was on a leave of absence. After some research online decided not to ever go back. Dr. Marvin was very nice and seemed knowledgeable but didn't trust someone that would work with Dr Brown. Do your research!!,UNK
13647,Great place to get a pizza. It's always good and very consistent. The only complaint I have is their hours but it's a small ran family business.,UNK
13648,"Horrible customer service... The employees are more concerned about talking with each other and joking around than they are listening to customer orders. IF there is even anybody at the register... good luck. It'll still take forever! Very sloppy, unorganized, and lazy store.",UNK
13649,"The place is like attending an event that will never happen.  The ceiling was too high, and the atmosphere anything but cozy.  Sound bounced off the walls like a bus station, and the food at best....mediocre.",UNK
13650,The lady at the register mean... The wait was like they left to a different restaraunt to get out food...,UNK
13651,"Awesome food, portions are a lot better than most places, prices are good too... well definitely be stopping in when in that area... friendly staff",UNK
13652,The meat quality is low - perhaps suitable for canning but not for serving at a restaurant. I do not eat here for this reason.,UNK
13653,"fresh watermelon being cut right in front of your eye for your slush. I'm not a fan of boba so i got a \""virgin\"" one. It was a very refreshing slush on a hot day",UNK
13654,"I've been twice, underwhelmed both times by both service (inconsistent and not particularly friendly) and the burgers (fine, but ...). I see lots of other raves, so maybe just not a good match for me.",UNK
13655,"Biggest redeeming quality for this place is food was excellent. However, waiting 35 min for a sandwich was terrible. While I liked the food I am unwilling to wait that long with so many other options around. \nTip: call ahead to order.",UNK
13656,"If I can avoid flying into McCarran I will, and Henderson Executive is the place to go. Friendly staff and great location make this a great spot for ingress and egress from Sin City.",UNK
13657,If you wish your soup tasted more like the Pacific Ocean then this place is for you. More sweat tasting liquid than you've ever hoped for.,UNK
13658,Great food and service! Place is small but comfortable. As soon as we sat down we had someone come to us for drinks. I will definitely go back to try some of the other menu choices.,UNK
13659,Self Service restaurant. \nFood is Ok. You can try once.\nYou will not find smile on the Owners Face.\nNo cooler hot like hell.\nNot Clean to expected standards.\nInexpensive food. \nrestaurant is crammed.,UNK
13660,Service was really bad.  Completely under staffed. Out of pulled pork. What type of BBQ joint sells out of pulled pork?  And the food we did have was cold. Won't be going back.,UNK
13661,It's about $150 for 3 people with two rounds of drinks. If you really like cheese and chocolate than this is the place for you. But I found that the entree selection was a bit limited for the true foodie. The strawberry salad was delish though. Desert was simple. Just dip everything into chocolate.,UNK
13662,"OK, you should know what to expect from a chain restaurant. This location continues to deliver as expected, although the waiter staff can sometimes not be attentive enough and drinks go unfilled. It's OK food, nothing special, but again it is what you would expect. No signature dish they rave about.",UNK
13663,Went in for a pair of used tires and was told about a great deal on some brand new tires. I decided to go with the news tires for the safety and piece of mind. One month later I find myself with a blown rotted tire. Staff was great and helpful but I feel they aren't the most honest be careful.,UNK
13664,The food was pretty okay but the restaurant is based on a disposable economy that I abhor. Everything is served on plastic. There are no dishes and everything gets thrown away. The only way we can stop this kind if waste is refusing to eat in places that serve food this way. I won't eat here again.,UNK
13665,My experience has been mixed. Many of their items are in my home. Price and product  are 4-5 star but personnel are 1-4. Hopefully the lesser people are gone. If I am going to shop I go to Phoenix which I find consistantly pleasantt.,UNK
13666,"Not so very good, and definitely not better than any big chain fast food. The fries had no flavor, O rings were strangely sweet (cornmealy?), burger was just \""meh\"". Won't go back unless I need some frozen slushy high fructose.",UNK
13667,"Stopped in to have lunch with my wife and we did not have a five star experience; however, upon our second visit we were impressed and would gladly return there to eat again. The staff and service are always great!",UNK
13668,"Great place to get some ideas.\nI purchased a couch, the delivery was easy  and fast. \nIf you like the south west flair, this store is a must ..",UNK
13669,I was at Palais de Congres last week and was disappointed to find that this place has closed. There is currently nothing else in its place.,UNK
13670,The people that work here are lame . \nDon't act act they know stuff but they don't. \nAll they do is trying to sell you extended warranty.  Even on a cable.,UNK
13671,I love the Hot Pastrami. My fiancee loves the Tuna Salad. I really find it hard to believe you could go wrong with anything on the menu. This place is a deli at it's finest!,UNK
13672,"Dry cleaned items came out great, but my laundered shirts were very wrinkled. \n\nCheap though for 6 items I paid 18 bucks.",UNK
13673,Stopped in for a breakfast burrito.\nChorizo Special.\nJust OK. Chirzo was kind of bland. Lacked spices.\nThe place was very clean and they were all friendly.\nFood just was nothing outstanding.,UNK
13674,"Whole Paycheck as I affectionately call it is a wonderful store but not worth the extra money to shop there on a regular basis. people, just wash your fruits and vegetables after you buy them.check out this podcast on Skeptoid by Brian Dunning and you'll learn the fallacies of the organic food processing business.",UNK
13675,"So slow! Waited 30 min between courses. Entree dish was barely warm- the manager removed the charge for the dish. Food was good, not the service I expect at its price point. Disappointing.",UNK
13676,"I've been waiting for 15 minutes for the store to open and still nobody has shown up. The hours posted say 9am, and it is now well after 9.",UNK
13677,"Great ice cream, but still just ice cream. Really enjoyed the salted caramel alongside a scoop of sweet corn. Feel a little silly for driving from Phoenix just for the taste but no complaints.",UNK
13678,Something has changed at this location...I'm a regular here and the drive thru service has been slow for the last 3 weeks...If doesn't improve looks like Dutch bros will be worth the trip.,UNK
13679,If you like getting the fright of your life (litreally) this is for you. I went acouple of months ago liked the beginning likes the stories but when I entered i freaked out.,UNK
13680,"See my post on Bachi Burger. In a nutshell, this place is overhyped in my opinion. Food is good but not worth the price. Adult shakes were probably the best thing here.",UNK
13681,"As many times as I have strolled past this coffee shop, I almost never see many of the tables occupied.  I may have discovered why on this trip.  I stopped in and purchased a pair of relatively small apple fritters to take back to our room. These turned out to be flavorless and slightly stale.",UNK
13682,You can't even give this place a star. We went in there and took forever to get service. We ordered chips and cheese dip. The FDA needs to step in because that is NOT cheese. We got up and left immediately,UNK
13683,I've been to this place several times with family and friends.  You MUST do the all you can eat for $25.00.  We tried doing the a-la-cart thing but it wouldve been cheaper to go the all you can eat route....,UNK
13684,"As far as pizza goes this ranks with the best I've ever eaten.  The crust, sauce, toppings and cheese are fabulous.  \n\nService was kinda slow and the tables are packed into the place so you are close to other tables.",UNK
13685,I had a Groupon and was pleased with staff and food. The waitress was pleasant and we enjoyed the afternoon. When the busboy noticed that I looked like I needed something he immediately came over and offered to help.,UNK
13686,"Good food but overpriced.  Paid $55 for two small portions. Service was horrible. After waiting ten minutes for a server,  the waiter did not even say hello when he finally arrived.  We only saw him again when he delivered the check. Not the wonderful Vegas dinner I had hoped.",UNK
13687,"This was the most over priced buffet I've eaten in a long time. The Indian casino's in the Inland Empire are better then this. The selection is good but the quality stinks. \n\nI thought this was nothing but wasted calories, and to a huge eater that's a sin.",UNK
13688,"This building is going to be turned into another location of Robbie Fox's Public House, from Tempe. Let's hope they keep the awesome d\u00e9cor and feel that Lis Doon Varna created.",UNK
13689,"Wanted to book an appointment with Corrie.  However, girl at front desk was so rude I thought.............why bother?  Like they are the only hair salon in Las Vegas",UNK
13690,"On my very first visit to this provider, he decided to biopsy the skin on the bridge of my nose and ended up leaving me with a huge scar...looks like a crater.  I will be supplementing this review shortly, as there is much more to describe about my experience.",UNK
13691,"The atmosphere is nice and the TVs with sports on everywhere is a bonus. The food was good. I would recommend the nachos as a starter. The burgers were good but not the best I've ever had. The server was friendly, but scarce. The price was reasonable. I would come back.",UNK
13692,"Great spot for good pizza and beer. EXCEPT for the local \""drunk\"" passed out, snoring in the booth next to us in the middle of the afternoon. People who worked there knew the guy, but they didn't do anything or seem to care til we said something to our waitress.",UNK
13693,This place has way bigger portions than Panda Express and the price is the same! Plus free delivery and free spring rolls with delivery...can't beat it! Wish they stayed open super late though! :D,UNK
13694,"The smoked meat was solid, i had the plain poutine which was good too. Overall the food was good and fairly cheap. Definitely worth a visit. Especially with the declining smoke meat across the street.",UNK
13695,"Stopped by this IHOP before heading out of Vegas. They usually do things fairly ok, pretty similar to every other branch. \n\nService was a bit slow at this location and cleanliness was lacking. Probably wouldn't visit this location again.",UNK
13696,"Best Buffet! Such a large selection! Only downside is the LINE for this place. But if you plan ahead, and get in line an hour before you want to be eating, you wont regret it!",UNK
13697,Don't waste your time. Equipment is not well maintained and there hasn't been a working scale for months. I advised them on these matters and they did nothing. I joined 24 hour fitness instead.,UNK
13698,Wow this place has crazy prices for a sandwich come on get real I don't understand what justifies paying so much for a soup or a sandwich and the portions are extremely small do yourself a favor and pass unless you have money to blow,UNK
13699,I booked here with a very good deal from expedia and it was on the LV strip. That's why I chose there. It wasn't that bad but if it wasn't on the strip I would look for somewhere else.,UNK
13700,"Sorry, sorry, sorry. \n\nI am sorry I wasted my time! money! and the calories that I took in from this place.  Worst BBQ I have EVER had.",UNK
13701,Really underwhelming. My husband's pot pie was a disappointment. My onion soup was marginal. We are unlikey to try it again.,UNK
13702,Food was really good. Salad with grilled veggies and goat cheese amazing.  Service was very poor. Automatically included an 18% gratuity so no reason to pay any attention to the guests.  Seriously didn't come back to refill drinks until they brought our bill.,UNK
13703,I'm a regular. The place is great for friends and family. Great selection in wing sauces. The service is awesome. Bike night is amusing and great wing specials through out the week. 32oz beers for $4 dollars. 100 OZ of beer for $9.99! Great outdoor area.,UNK
13704,"The winter creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e trio is amazing!  Vanilla bean, ginger snap, and cranberry...it's just delicious!",UNK
13705,"95% of the time it's clean in here.  I like to eat in here from time to time. It's the second nicest McDonald's on this side of city.  Food is sometimes hot, I ALWAYS check my FOOD.  Make sure it's right before I leave.",UNK
13706,Loud.  Musters are horrid. Danny hall the manager a dick. Don't go. Over rated. Loud inside. Wet outside.,UNK
13707,Pretty good I wouldn't say great but it's the type of place that is trying to push class yet the people have none. The staff does though . Also good on a sat night to find older women,UNK
13708,"I had the vegetarian sammich.  It was a bunch of veggies between two pieces of spongey bread, with a hot sauce that was not flavorful, just hot.  I guess I should try something else because eating spongebob squarepants wasn't enjoyable for me.",UNK
13709,I had heard amazing things about this place and I tried it and got the BLT and it was just ok  Nothing special about it.  I would recommend trying a different sandwich place.,UNK
13710,"Love the name.  Kim did my mani & pedi in no time flat.  She did a great job on a traditional mani, which is a rarity these days.  She said they also do hair in the space.  I'd go back.  Very clean.",UNK
13711,"Food looked bomb but it wasn't even that good.. The Red Snapper Carpaccio wasn't fresh, I was really disappointed. I'd say Raku is way better.",UNK
13712,"Laughably, appallingly bad for the price point. You can do much better for $8 than bland noodles, boring fried rice, and awful egg rolls that left a bad taste in my mouth. I'm shocked it took 30 minutes to prepare the sweet and sour pork I carried out of the restaurant.",UNK
13713,Bad service. Got both of my coffee orders wrong and my food order. Lady was rude on the intercom and they took 20 min. This is just another reason why Starbucks does so well.. Always great customer service and your order is always right. Maybe this place should learn a few things from them!!!!,UNK
13714,Not a bad choice if you want to change it up. Lots of things with a waffle you probably wouldn't think of. Service is a bit spotty.,UNK
13715,"If you desire good Mexican food, eXit-Tapa Joe's immediately.  While service is friendly and polite, and the bar'TV setting is nice, the food reminds us of our trip to the themed restaurants at Disney World.  Bland and boring is saying something nice -- though even that's a stretch.",UNK
13716,"Enjoy the \""art house\"" feel and quirky aesthetic. People are interesting too. Love the name. Hate the metered street parking.",UNK
13717,It's still a pretty new establishment but the staff is always very friendly and the food is always perfect. Just recently tried the orange jello for dessert (there's a free coupon on the menu) and it was surprisingly good! Would recommend to anyone who wants to get full and eat good food for under $10!,UNK
13718,I visited Macayo's with a friend last night before a concert. The food was wonderful (love the half-price appetizer happy hour!) and we had great service. I was a little disappointed at the beer selection for happy hour. No Dos Equis Amber on draft but you have Corona Light? Bummer!,UNK
13719,Basic breakfast buffet boredom. What other hotels offer as complementary breakfast will cost you $13. Food is acceptable. Service is acceptable. Coffee was acceptable. Nothing to rave about. Nothing to complain about. Meh..... Hence 3-stars.,UNK
13720,"I am so sick of anyone saying this is a good casino/resort. I live and play here and there is nothing to give a positive review about.  The dealers suck,  no one ever wins and all the management team sticks with the dealers. Shit!",UNK
13721,I didn't get a haircut here but I did come in to purchase some things during the holidays as well as some gift cards. \n\nThe hairdresser came to the register as quickly as she could and made sure to acknowledge me waiting for her despite being pretty busy with customers.,UNK
13722,"A friend brought me a strawberry and cream croissant at work today, it was perfectly sweet and buttery. The croissant was light and flakey and the strawberry & cream cheese was the perfect balance of sweet cream! Look forward to trying out different flavored croissants!",UNK
13723,"This place has discount food nights with vegetarian options, enough to earn it an OK rating. The beer selection is pretty good and the atmosphere is divey but friendly. If you don't mind smelling like cigarette smoke at the end of the night, it's a good time had by all.",UNK
13724,THIS PLACE IS FILTHY! I dont know what kind of salons these other reviewers are used to but this place is disgusting. The customer service was way below sub standard and the pedi was something i could do better.  I honestly think the other reviews were written either by employees of the salon or their family,UNK
13725,"The show took only a little over an hour.  The tricks, while good, had quite a bit of lead time, so not many were able to be performed during that time.  While the theater provided crowd intimacy, the seats were uncomfortable.",UNK
13726,"I would give negative stars if I could.  RUDE employees and my car was damaged from the wash.  I am speaking of the Northern location.  I will NEVER go here again, and will make sure everyone I know, does not use this terrible \""car wash\""!!",UNK
13727,"German cafeteria food. period.  I had the special: stuffed roast pork, red cabbage and spaetzle. (sp)",UNK
13728,"Wow, it looks like Dr. C is now begging (or paying) people to write \""5 Star\"" reviews for her on Yelp. I wouldn't put it past her...",UNK
13729,"There food was really delicious, the only reason i didnt give them, 5 stars was because of the service we had to wait a long while before we got served. I would go back though. I highly recommened octopus sushi and the spicy tuna roll :D",UNK
13730,It's a rip-off for a simple passport photo. It's 12 bucks-- way too expensive for such a low quality passport photo!,UNK
13731,"Friendly, fast service. My appointment was scheduled quickly & they came out on time. \n\nThe issue ended up being human error :), so they did not do any repairs, but charged a consultation fee which is waived if repairs are done.",UNK
13732,They are now owned by different people and I go there all the time. My acrylics always look great and they never lift.,UNK
13733,"Service is friendly although not too fast. \""House edemame\"" comes doused in garlic salt - if you like that sort of thing. Gyoza was awesome and the rolls were good. Somewhat overpriced though.",UNK
13734,The food is really good. We like their food but the waiting time is too long and it kills the pleasure. People come later than us finish sooner. Twenty minutes is ok but we waited for over forty minutes. The last plate was not here after a whole hour so we had to cancel it.,UNK
13735,"The atmosphere was great but the service was not so great. The drink selection was great. The food selection and presentation was great but it was a little overpriced and extremely oily, I was sick the rest of the night after dinner. Cool place to hang with your bros but not so cool as a dining experience.",UNK
13736,If I could gives this place 0 stars I would! Worst experience ever! Horrible customer service and the lady who cut my hair messed up my bangs so bad! I can't believe she has a license to cut hair. Beware of the chola lady with red dike hair!,UNK
13737,Very unhelpful for the handicap i asked the mgm employe if i could swirch my ticket and that i have dshd i was toled no,UNK
13738,Is this place still open? We went by to have lunch at noon on 9/26/11 & there was a sign on the door saying the business had closed & the windows were all covered up. I guess it went out of business.,UNK
13739,"$5 for a drink and original pollo bowl (rice, beans, chicken). Not a bad deal for a fast food place. It reminds me of a cheaper Chipotle. Definitely get the avocado salsa!",UNK
13740,"Wish I could give this place no stars,  dirty inside, food is terrible and over priced, wait staff is not customer friendly,  5 years ago this place was great, not anymore, avoid it at all costs! Even coach & willies is better and that's pathetic!",UNK
13741,"Great food here.  Not some place that you would wander into, but well worth going.  Nice patio out back when the weather is nice.  Bring your own bottle and enjoy!!",UNK
13742,"I can only vouch for the rides, and they were the best part of my last trip to Vegas.  Suffice it to say that my last trip to Vegas will not make it onto my BEST VACATIONS list, but it was fun nonetheless, if not outrageously overpriced.",UNK
13743,Not what I was expecting. I was told that this was a great place and what I ordered was not worth the money. The service was ok. Will not be going back.,UNK
13744,Food was good! Service was horrible and they were not that busy! All the girls look really slutty. We did find a hair in our food. Not the most recommended.,UNK
13745,Ordered the prime rib special an hour after the doors opened and they were already out. Found crab shell in the sweet tortellini. The service was great though and the manager did end up giving us the apps for free.,UNK
13746,"I would never stay in the hotel and have only gambled there.\n\nThis is what to expect: nasty craps dealers who would rather be rude and condescending than polite or helpful. I think I saw one employee smile once.\n\nYet, I won. So the joke is on them.",UNK
13747,"Solid lunch spot when you want something more than the standard soup, sandwich, salad.  I ordered some chicken medallion / side of potatoes dish and it was really good.  The queso dip was also good, too.",UNK
13748,Avoid at best. Poor car wash over all. You pay top dollar for low quality. Poor management and customer service. Never going back. Do better job myself.,UNK
13749,"This dog park is heavily used. The water feature for water dogs is really cool but it does not seem like people pick up after their dogs much. Boo, lots of poo!",UNK
13750,Side dishes were good but the New York strip was the worst I ever had! Very disappointing this type of restaurant should be top notch- skip it.,UNK
13751,Food is great but the service SUCKS even for take out orders. Employees are RUDE & LAZY. I now go to the one in San Tan Village ....EXCELLENT service & VERY friendly. Definitely worth the drive.,UNK
13752,The Carnival World Buffet was a great dissapointment.  When I went several years ago it was awesome.  I guess because of the economy the quality of the food has went downhill.  I would not recommend this buffet to anyone.  I would've been happier trying a buffet elsewhere.  Not worth the money.  :(,UNK
13753,Southpoint bowling center is a a fantastic place to go bowling in Las Vegas...\nIt has 64 lanes a bar a a cafe...the bowling center is located on the second floor by the movie theater and is open 24 hours a day and has 1$ bowling from 12 midnight to 8 am,UNK
13754,"I like to judge a place by its brisket, and they did NOT disappoint!!! it had a good quarter-inch smoke ring on it, and it was delicious! based on other bbq disappointments around town this could be some of the best bbq in Vegas.  The prices are pretty good too.",UNK
13755,Eh... Not enough bartenders for the grand opening. Little different layout than the previous Amsterdam... Maybe with time it will get better.. So many lights it's really bright in here as well... Drinks were good!,UNK
13756,Love the drinks... When they are actually open. Store is just closed on random days and opens late. Kind of hard to continue being a customer when the business is not reliable..,UNK
13757,I am not going to complain about the quality of my manicure! They did a fabulous job...On the other hand their customer service was a little off. Very unorganized and they could just not get it together. It took them forever to assist us since we didn't have an appointment and are not regulars.,UNK
13758,"We ordered a club sandwich and asian chicken salad. Based on the sandwich alone, I would have given 3 stars but the salad was gross.  Maybe the burgers are the best thing to get here...",UNK
13759,"Had the ox tail soup which was very good. The steamed rice was undercooked, service was horrible.  Also had some dim sum which was all very good! Lucky for us the meal was on the house!",UNK
13760,Ordered the Fish & Chips...HORRIBLE!!! They changed the Cod Fish to Pollack. Menu still says fluffy white fish. Since when is Pollack considered a White Fish?!?,UNK
13761,Dated but still somewhat fun.\r\n\r\nThis is probably still one of the best places to abandon your kids while you gamble irresponsibly.\r\n\r\nHad a chili cheeseburger at one of the cafe/restaurants. It wasn't bad.,UNK
13762,"Great views of the strip, I loved it. But to me overpriced. $34.95 a ticket at night. We did the family pack for $79.95 for 4. We still had a great time.",UNK
13763,"Fair price for the food. The owner is fun to chat with, and they have good service. A great place to eat on campus town.\nLike their Uno w/spicy noodle soup! It's like tom yum!",UNK
13764,We've eaten here several times since my last review and the pizza has never been excessively salty.  Also discovered honey hot boneless wings and me likey-likey!!,UNK
13765,"Very status conscious mall.  Prices are inflated to match.  If it weren't for Dry Bar, I would make it a point to avoid this place.",UNK
13766,"The food is just okay, never horrible but never all that great. It is a fun place for a group but it is a tad gimmicky if you ask me.",UNK
13767,"Excellent food. Ordered the lamb chop,  picxto chorizo,  cannelloni,  manchego bread,  fried peppers I got two orders they were so goo.  Service is a little slow but good food if u don't mind the wait",UNK
13768,"Four visits to understand why my phone was not activating correctly. Each visit offered a new insight on what was wrong with my switch from an Iphone to an Android. It was not really their fault for not knowing. As long as they put in the effort and eventually addressed the issue at hand, I am satisfied with the service.",UNK
13769,"It's a decent sandwich that for the money is a very good deal. I had the cappicola. It was a perfect ratio of meat, cheese, fries, tomato and coleslaw. Very filling and decently tasty. This is not fancy food, just hearty sandwiches. Nothing more.",UNK
13770,Seasonal place that is always a favorite. A bit off campus but worth the drive.\n\nTake your friends here when it's hot and you'll be guaranteed thanks all night.,UNK
13771,"Nice mall. Clean, cool shops, good choices in the food court. You know what would have been really helpful? A directory. Yeah. Directory would be good.",UNK
13772,"Absolutely terrible service, absolutely amazing Kobe Skirt Steak. Avoid this restaurant if you want to drink and have a good time while eating, but do come here if you want good food.",UNK
13773,"Had a really good brunch here.  A small serving of waffles with eggs, fruit, and sausage.  The restaurant opens up into the sidewalk, nice with the spring weather we got.",UNK
13774,"Got us where we were going, not quickly however.we waited about 30 minutes to bored.driver was ok, poor customer service.to wait 30 minutes we could,ve been at a car rental spot and gone.use a rental.",UNK
13775,Tacos here suck. The shell is always broken and I have found cut fingernails in the beef. Stay away don't need to be jumped by gang members here who spit their fingernail clippings into the food.  Be careful and can I take your order please?,UNK
13776,"The buffet was really delicious, lots of different tasty meats.  The guava juice and baklava were also delicious.  A good meal at a good price.\n\nFor the buffet, make sure you get there early since it gets busy quick!",UNK
13777,Closed for business as of now.\n\nThe whole building is vacant as a matter fact.\n\nThe other 7/11 is on the North end of the strip by the Ross.,UNK
13778,"Horrible Customer Service, with stink eye from everyone. Takes too long to get your contacts. Crappy service from start to finish. BBB will definitely get a complaint from us.",UNK
13779,"Food quality is there..\nService / waitresses could be a little bit more happier about their job..\nThe garlicky, buttery, Hot n Juicy smell in your breath and fingers need to go..",UNK
13780,"Everything I had was great... My wife on the other hand, got food poisoning. She had the California Chicken sandwich and a caesar salad...",UNK
13781,Very long wait times. Place is a fairly dirty. Room was hot while we were waiting. This is true for each our first 4 pediatric visits. We are changing doctors.,UNK
13782,I tried calling customer service to see if they carried a specific plumbing item. I should have just gone to the store and checked for myself as it would have taken the same amount of time...,UNK
13783,After my work i was just get in to the mall to get my shopping and eyebrow done. OMG! this place is Closed! i mean went out of business! So Going back to my favorite place FABULOUS EYEBROW THREADING on my way home........!!,UNK
13784,"Delicious chips and salsa! I was shocked that we had to pay for chips and salsa, but it was worth it! Some of the best salsa I have had. I got a combination with a beef burrito and chicken taco. Shredded beef was delicious. I would eat here again.",UNK
13785,"Food was good, service was excellent, my ice tea must have been refilled once every 2-5 minutes depending on how much I drank. The pho came in a huge bowl and was very tasty. The veggies in the spring rolls tasted very fresh. Definitely would go back for a second time.",UNK
13786,We booked the hotel rooms because it was cheaper. We checked in  rooms are very outdated. It smells old. This hotel needs to update itself. \n\nIt took us 1 hour switching between rooms but none of the room was up to our expectation.,UNK
13787,"The boba here is decent, depends on what you get. The food is horrible. Don't bother with the food menu.",UNK
13788,Went for Halloween and was on guest list.  Wait was long!! We waited for over and hour and decided to leave.  \n\nWe have been there before and there wasnt a wait but place isnt that big.  \n\nMay try to go back next time if someone wants to go but not for Halloween.,UNK
13789,"Like some of the others, I don't think they'll be around long. Too bad 'cuz the food wasn't bad, but the service, the lighting, the art, and the ambiance left a lot to be desired.",UNK
13790,"We ate here for breakfast twice and dinner once.  It was pretty cheap for strip buffets. The food was decent, the atmosphere was good it was a decent time. The food was good, and you can get your own drinks which can be a pro.  It wasn't super fancy, but sometimes that's a good thing.",UNK
13791,Very nice clean establishment. great patio! service was wonderful! Food okay and i'm kind of particular with my wine and glass did not meet my standards glass was dirty and had lint inside with wine! Very nice selection of wine. My suggestion would be to find another restaurant :),UNK
13792,Went here for lunch today and it was good! I got a cheese steak with fries and drink. It's was pretty standard fries were kind of bland. I liked the cheesesteak tho! May be returning!,UNK
13793,$1 extra for grilled peppers and onions is ridiculous. Rather go to Chipotle food is better and not so many up charges and their portions are big enough to make 2 meals out of it. Will not be returning.,UNK
13794,"Ok so the girls are hot, love the little librarian thing going on BUT other than this this place is nothing all that great.  Full of horny college guys and the bartenders seemed a little rude.  Still had a good time here but there are better places on Mill for sure.",UNK
13795,"great atmosphere and great food. while the menu changes seasonally, my group all enjoyed the food - crab/scallop pasta, pumpkin risotto and rare tuna.\n\ncasbah also has a great wine list, and great service that is there when you need them, but doesn't annoy.",UNK
13796,"We're regulars at LGO. Amazing desserts, delicious homemade English muffins (can't go wrong with the commuter sandwich w/ avocado and bacon). They sell a great bottle of inexpensive wine- Klee. And always revolving retail area w/ unique gifts. Great place to eat, shop & relax.",UNK
13797,"Great pizza, but not worth the trouble of the wait.  You can get wine next door, while you wait, but the attraction of the place is due to great publicity.  Try once and decide if the hassle is worth it.  I won't go back.",UNK
13798,$4.45 for Hammond lollipops that are $1.99 at WHOLE FOODS? What a rip! And teen-age clerks being too familiar and inappropriately jokey in front of me? Me thinks not!,UNK
13799,"The service could have been a better and this is coming from someone pretty empathetic with service professionals. It was taking a long time for our drink orders to show up, but our server was very friendly. The food was alright. I'll certainly be giving it a second chance.",UNK
13800,"I just had the all you can eat sushi here and it was amazing, the food was amazing the service was very good, the atmosphere was very nice. I would recommend this place to anyone.",UNK
13801,"This is a nice place to visit, Rainforest cafe is a good eat but otherwise i wouldn't stay here. I have to be honest, I havent stayed here but the feel that I get from this place, i have definitely seen better in Vegas!!",UNK
13802,"I saw BMG about five years ago and again tonight. Both times I can't seem to figure out what all the hype is. I find the show pretty boring and almost fell asleep both times.\nI think it's probably good for some people but just not really my thing, I guess.",UNK
13803,Food was okay. Nothing spectacular to write home about. The Mac n cheese was not done and the ribs taste like they were boiled before being baked in an oven.,UNK
13804,"To be honest, I really enjoy the chinese food, but not this one. My wife and I were setting there like 45 mins, the food that we ordered were take forever. I don't know why they took so long. They mess up the chinese food, shame on them.",UNK
13805,"Better than average sushi w/nice selection in wonderful ambience.  Veggie food leaves a lot to be desired.  Nice salads, ramens and cooked Japanese dishes.  Friendly and efficient staff.",UNK
13806,Overpriced garbage. A burger that would cost $5 at Carl's Jr. and taste better there costs $15 here and made me feel sick. \n\nThe service was poor as well. I could have probably left without paying - the server was nowhere to be seen.,UNK
13807,"Another failed attempt to find good Pad Thai in Madison. The summer rolls are good, but for the most part the food is bland. I eat thai food for the richness in flavors and the sauces here just don't cut it.",UNK
13808,"All the way from Northern California. A promoter promised us to get my female friend and I and my guy in for free. We went, made that our plan and they had the nerve to make us pay for my guy. The door person didn't care. The cashier said it happens a lot. That's pathetic.",UNK
13809,"This place I more hype and fluff than substance.  The customers think that being there makes them cool which masks the mediocre ingredients, copy cat recipes, and tough crust.  The pizza isn't bad it's just not great, but when you have to deal with this caliber of stuck up clientele, I'd say go elsewhere.",UNK
13810,"This is my 3rd visit and I have to say it has been terrible every time. Tonight the service was the worst, i. Will not be back.",UNK
13811,"The manager there is the very worse, a Hispanic lady who was totally unhelpful addressing my needs. Stay away from this location if you want to keep your sanity.",UNK
13812,"It was great the last few times...\n till I found a dried piece of spinach stuck on my fork when I unwrapped the silverware, and dishes had crumbs encrusted on them.",UNK
13813,"This place is right around the corner from my house. Thought I'd give it a shot. Restaurant was not that busy and there were three wait staff. Wait staff was very friendly, BUT service was very poor. Prices were also over priced for the portion sizes. Not a terrible place, but I've definitely had better.",UNK
13814,"We are here for lunch at red robin. The burger was mediocre and the bun was not wrap so it's soggy . I mentioned to the waiter about the soggy bun, she said we can ask for the paper wrap. The place is not clean, dusty and notable on shades and lamps.",UNK
13815,I love popeyes chicken but this location wasn't as good as I had in Atlanta and Arlington.  Every table in the place was dirty. Chicken was not great seemed to be sitting to long. Won't come to this location again.,UNK
13816,"I was not really happy with the food there. I know Lebanese food well, the food at this place is more of a fast-food. The restaurant did not look so clean either. Even though the price was cheap, still had the same price for similar food elsewhere and the quality was so much better.",UNK
13817,"I really wanted to like this place. I'm Greek and my family cooks a lot of Greek food.  Their tzatziki sauce was runny and not flavorful. Everything was just real commercialized, nothing tasted right or even close to homemade.",UNK
13818,So so food. Had to send back a sandwich twice. But they were very nice about it. I agree with who ever posted the comment a few weeks ago about them putting up stickers blighting the neighborhood on street signs and light poles.,UNK
13819,Attempted to speak to them over the phone regarding alterations - no one was helpful or understanding apparently! They transferred me 3 times- ended up hanging up.,UNK
13820,I had high hopes for this place... But believe me when I tell you that the only thing you are paying for is the view and some half ass made food.,UNK
13821,The wine angles are kind of what you pay for.  The food was merely adequate for the price.  They must have let the Michelin critic fly around in the wine tower to earn the star.,UNK
13822,"this is a total scam, I used the coupon in todays paper and the tech wanted to charge me double to do a double steam clean. told him no... he cleaned 4 rooms and 15 stairs in 15 mins. you get what you pay for, terrible company. would never do business with them again",UNK
13823,Went through the drive thru  for just dessert and waited 15 minutes. Maybe longer.  the time i went through was at 12:17am in the morning. Usually the service here is pretty quick.,UNK
13824,standard typical hotel cafe fare. nothing to write home about really. caution: the juice is $5.50/glass. you've been warned.,UNK
13825,"This is a nice little location; off the strip so it feels less crowded and more relaxed.\n\nThe girls seemed to be bothered by having to help us, but they weren't rude.\n\nI wouldn't mind coming back here.",UNK
13826,"Horrible management, horrible staff. everyone is rude and unhelpful. \noh and my room smelled like poop the whole time. \nroom 1818 . dont stay there.",UNK
13827,There is never anyone here to help you .\nThe most understaffed store I've been in.\nAvoid !!\nAlso they never seem to have stock of the stuff you need.,UNK
13828,Food has always been delicious every time that I have gone here. Unfortunately the service is not very good. I only return because I love the food.,UNK
13829,food was okay. a good amount to chose from but nothing blew me away except for their dessert! bellagio buffet probably has my favorite dessert selections out of all the buffets i've tried in vegas.,UNK
13830,"Pathetic !!!  dirty, poor management, terrible food..... needs to close .. dont waste your time or money......",UNK
13831,"Burger had a good home grilled taste, kids hot dog was good tasted like a Costco hot dog, smash fries had zero garlic taste, and the Az Cobb was very fresh but not exceptional. Overall good food but not worth the money. Did NOT have any ice cream but that did look good.",UNK
13832,"i just finished eating a burrito from this spot. i dumped out nearly all of the chicken... if the saying, 'you are what you eat' is true then i am so fuckckin nasty.",UNK
13833,The staff was very friendly but it's just not my kind of food. The soup I ordered tasted dirty socks. Should give it a second chance but I just can't do it.,UNK
13834,"Went for lunch. Food tasted fine. Portions were small and WAY overpriced. Terrible service...servers were inattentive and indifferent, the manager bordered on rude. Will never return.",UNK
13835,"I like this buffet. It doesn't have a wide, wide selection but it still has great food. The first time I got up to get food I came back with a full plate and two full bowls of salads. \nSince the price is reasonable I would recommend this place, especially since the place itself is really nice.",UNK
13836,"Apparently they are doing a pre grand opening event by invitation only... My response is WTF WHAT KIND OF FAST FOOD JOINT DOES THAT???!!! we were turned away at the door. They just lost customers, we won't be back.",UNK
13837,"Barro's has been our Go-To take-out for years. Last night we got a large cheese and noticed the crust has changed and not for the better. I hope it was a fluke, maybe someone forgot a key ingredient.",UNK
13838,"couple of concern, charging for wifi in Vegas?\nThen Encore tried to charge me for early checkout. yup, early checkout. Like booking for 3 days, they will charge u the third day even u check out the second day.",UNK
13839,Good and cheap!!!!!!! It was pretty basic but everything was good. The pastry chef must be well versed in the culinary arts because that was the best part. This place is on par with Hometown buffet so its not top notch...but you can't beat the price.,UNK
13840,"Went for a grown-up birthday. We didn't wind up playing as there was a 40 minute wait. But the main room smelled terrible, like stale french fries and urine. Yes, urine. Staff was friendly, but I will  not go back. Kids inside seemed to be having fun.",UNK
13841,"The staff was nice enough, the food was good, but if management is reading this, the restaraunt itself was really dirty. There was no lunch rush so there is no excuse for dirty floors, tables, chairs, and a full trashcan.",UNK
13842,I will be delivering at this hospital in March 2014. I would not like a C-SECTION. I will advised them on arrival date if it make sense.,UNK
13843,"OK Chinese food, mix in the Thai and Vietnamese and lots to choose from.\n\nHighlight for me was the chicken meatball dish was very tasty with lettuce wraps.  \n\nGreat finish with coconut ice cream.",UNK
13844,I give it 3 stars because a- i used the atm outside and didn't get to experience the bulletproof teller windows inside b- there were no robberies while I was there.,UNK
13845,"I have tried the pizza several times and find it rather bland.  Recently I tried the breakfast sandwich to go, they put two huge eggs on it and a lot of bacon but the container was filled with grease and liquid which made a soggy inedible mess.  The service is always friendly though so I keep giving it another try.",UNK
13846,"as i've mentioned, I had the unfortunate displeasure of being diverted by ambulance to this hell hole( my opinion) and being treated by joseph mengler, i mean my arch enemy chris appleton. He showed absolutely no respect, and left me in an emotionally and psychologically hole . Stay away be warned!",UNK
13847,"We caught quite a few fish, but the guide was pretty rude and full of himself.   Acted like it was a privilege for us to be fishing with him.\nWon't be going back.   Don't need an attitude on what should be a relaxing fish trip.",UNK
13848,RM Seafood is so overrated. I was really disappointed with the food. It is the equivalent of an average seafood restaurant back in the Boston area. I have heard such great thing about Rick Moonen's restaurants. This place is overpriced average food.,UNK
13849,"Sunday football head quarters. If I want to see my best friend during football season, this is where to find her. Cheap happy hour and cheap food specials. Decent neighborhood bar, way better than T-Birds or The Lodge, in my opinion.",UNK
13850,This place is horribly slow. They promised 45 minutes and it was an hour and a half. Would not return or use again.,UNK
13851,Very friendly service with very mediocre pizza.  THe caesar salad was fresh and yummy but the pizza was caca.,UNK
13852,"the location at Camelback and 16th Street no longer exists.  There's one that opened 1 week ago at E Roosevelt St and N 1st St, and they say there's one at Sky Harbor Airport",UNK
13853,Was very good service at the beginning. Problem was that when I lost my id they were very mean and treating like I was under 18 even though everything was in my name and they knew I was 27 years old no doubt. I will not come back to a place that has no common sense.,UNK
13854,Appears to be CLOSED.\n\nPhone number not in service. Went by last week & was all locked up with a realtor sign on the building.,UNK
13855,Food is expensive and not worth the price. Service is horrible. Waited for ever to receive my check and another long time for them to run my card. I will not be returning here,UNK
13856,They have to be open on the saturday! at least half a day! The only reason I come to this location is because its walking distance. I think at all Wells Fargo Banks they have great customer service. But PLEASE be open on saturday!,UNK
13857,"He may be a 5-star plumber, but if he can't be bothered to return phone calls, that's a 1-star business in my book.",UNK
13858,"Decent Calamari, Caesar salad and Chicken Pamigana.  Tomato sauce was not as tasty as I would have liked.  Went late on a Tuesday not very crowded.  Waiter was a little annoying; came by too much.  They have bar bite specials after 9PM.",UNK
13859,"Went here shortly after it opened. We had dinner and not sure if they were still training the wait staff and cooks, but it was not a good experience. May return to try the bar, but it will not include dinner.",UNK
13860,"Careful when you order large. Cause while it says large, what it really means is huge. You won't be able to finish it.\n\nI like this place because it's not too fancy and doesn't put on airs.  Simple. Plain. Gets the job done.",UNK
13861,Had someone from monsoon come look at my roof to give an estimate. The guy left and I never heard from anyone for a couple of weeks. I called back and they were clueless. Sent someone else out and completely started over from scratch. Very frustrating. Going with someone else.,UNK
13862,"Its an ok place.  Nothing to distinguish it from hundreds of other \""irish pubs\"".  They do a lot of toursit business and it seems that tourists aren't all that picky.  They carry no ciders and use American pint glases.",UNK
13863,"The music was a way too loud but the food was delicious. We ended up eating in \""silence\"" because having a conversation was impossible.",UNK
13864,"Nice basic LV hotel.\nClean, nothing special.\n\nI spoke here at a topical conference, but the venue was mediocre.\n\nYou can rent 1,2, or 3 nites here to sleep OK.\nNothing more.",UNK
13865,"This place has a good selection of toppings and fair choices of frozen yogurt flavors.\n\nI deducted one star because I've been to better, and the second star because it's always filled with kids and everything is sticky/messy. I usually get it it to go.",UNK
13866,Hotel is putting false charges on my card. There was a dirty Band-Aid in the shower stuck to the wall. There were needles and syringes is in the armoire below the TV. Front desk is rude and I still haven't been refunded my money.,UNK
13867,"Food so bad I had to throw it away! (was delivered).   Greasy, overcooked, and disgusting textures. No resemblance to the delicious Chinese food I am used to.\n\nDon't say I didn't warn you .  .",UNK
13868,Bad cheessteak. Dry bread. The meat looked funny and dry too. Tasted below average. Won't be rushing back anytime soon.,UNK
13869,was good enough bread.  As a vegetarian i can't say anything about the meat.  Produce was standard enough.  The staff is friendly enough.  A little better quality food than subway type sandwiches so worth a little more as reflected in price.  Still feel like its fair for the food.  Worth checking out!,UNK
13870,They suck!! Go for a smog they tell me there's 6 people ahead of me and it will be an hour and a half wait. That's way too long when a smog is only about 3 minutes.,UNK
13871,"Good food, but not worth the price. Me and my husband paid $100 (tax and tip) for waffles, the duck omelet thing, and French toast. That's it! You're pretty much going to pay for the ambience, because the food was not up to par.",UNK
13872,I just had a white mocha latte....and it was way-way too sugary!  I was only able to have a couple of sips out of it.  Everything looks good here.  I'll have to come back and try something else.,UNK
13873,I'm not even going to start. \nThe bed was comfortable and it was close to the Sands Convention Center. \nOther than that BAAAAH,UNK
13874,"Solid breakfast, a local hangout.  It does have outdoor seating.  Breakfast is always good and the place always accommodates changes in the menu.  I do like it and come back again and again with my parents, who have been coming here since the 80's.  The service is always good.",UNK
13875,"Took a long time to get our food,we asked for a cheese crisp to be extra crispy, it was not,very bland rice, and not much meat in the green chili, Salsa and chips were good",UNK
13876,"It just didn't seem like much of an effort was put into the food or experience.  It was all pretty 'blah'.  They were even out of rice.  Workers took care to make sure you got what you wanted, but the whole interaction was pretty stale.",UNK
13877,"Nothing great to say, nothing terrible. Lunch menu, Pepper Beef-- no better than 2 stars. Won't go again.",UNK
13878,The burger that I ordered was still frozen in the inside and the meat smelled like it was going bad but the french fries were awesome.,UNK
13879,I ordered a Latte and for the first time I felt I drank the worst ever coffee in my one and half years in the US. The Caribous and Starbucks were closed and this was my only option. I threw the coffee into the trash even before it's half done. It sucks big time.,UNK
13880,"Lack of variety, theres shrimp, beef and thats it.\n\nNo salmon, king crabs, or any of that stuff needed for a good buffet.\n\nRather pay 15 more dlls and have the real buffet experience. Woulndt come back here.",UNK
13881,This place has good food and the price is right so definitely check it out. My only real con about this place is their hours of operation. I've come to the restaurant several times only to find it closed for some reason or other posted on their door.,UNK
13882,"Lots of candy to choose from here. Pricing is a bit more than I would have anticipated paying for the same sweets you can get at Walmart & Target. I guess your paying for convenience, so if you need candy asap this is your place.",UNK
13883,"Closed for the week the day before Thanksgiving...you have got to be kidding me. Next stop, guru palace. I check it out eventually.",UNK
13884,I've had lunch here a few times but have never really been impressed. My last experience was probably just that. The food is nothing special and the service seems to always be worse. Not sure the servers like walking up the stairs to the top dining area.,UNK
13885,"One of the worst restaurants in Scottsdale. New owners need to take a look at the food. I had delivery tonite. The salad had old brown lettuce--thew it out. The turkey was processed, not cooked today. Never again!!!!!",UNK
13886,Went there with some friends who had the hibachi which looked okay. I just had sashimi which was very underwhelming. Have had much better elsewhere.,UNK
13887,"Ridiculously unprofessional! Steer clear- if you do get paid, it will be only a portion for no reason. First job was paid eventually, late. After that the issues began, still owed $$, it's been a year!",UNK
13888,"The story of this free show is dumb, but it's free and fun to watch them sink the pirate ship, so I recommend watching the show anyway.",UNK
13889,"The food was delicious, however the service was horrible. It took 30 minutes for our waitress to bring tomato juice for one of our partymembers as well as charging another one of our partymembers 60 dollars for french fries on their debit card.",UNK
13890,"Zero stars. Came in 10 mins before close. Female manager on duty asked for $100 in exchange for a pizza. When we refused she said she could not serve us because her employees had been working since 9am..,it is currently 2:00 am... Sounds pretty illegal to me",UNK
13891,"I much prefer the Pamela's in the strip. I've only been here once, but the food was beyond salty. Even the potatoes that I love were super salty and oily. Maybe I just went on an off day, but I'll be going to the one in the strip only from now on.",UNK
13892,"Ate there with the wife last night. Everything tasted to us like it was straight out of a can and came to the table cold. Server was nice, but the everything home made speech is a crock. Just because it was put in a pot, then from a pot to a plate does not mean it should be called homemade or hand made.",UNK
13893,"I stopped here for some green tea and the employee kept looking at me like I was going to steal something. I asked for assistance and she spoke to me in her language. WOW. Lesson learned, I will stick with my normal places. Rude Rude Rude. I will not be back.",UNK
13894,"Service is good, location on the strip  is good, the logistics of the parking garage in relation to the hotel is not convenient. You can tell its an older building, but functional. The miracle mile shopping center is very nice to walk thru and shop.",UNK
13895,"This place is dirty, dreary, depressing and filled with smoke. The dentist music they play really LOUD is icing on the cake. Yuck!",UNK
13896,This place is dying. Shot specials at 5.75 a shot? Im from pit and will never come back here. Place is crazy expensive and was not busy. Better off at applebees,UNK
13897,"I went back and had the steak frite special and it was excellent . Flavorful and tender and the sauce and  seasoning on the frites very tasty . Some of the old American comfort classics are back and all in all , it was pretty good.",UNK
13898,"Worst McDonald's ever! If you're looking for customer service this is definitely not the place.  How hard is it to get an order right? Or, I don't know,  how hard is it to work the drive thru window and pretend to know what your doing!! Ugh",UNK
13899,Nothing fancy. It was convenient as I was staying in the Aria. Drink prices were average for Vegas. Will I come back? Possibly. Is it a must-go? Definitely not.,UNK
13900,"Came out to my house, seem very genuine, promise to email me a quote the following week, never heard from Ryan again. I called and emailed him....Oh well, I'll find somebody better.",UNK
13901,"Rookie place. If you don't care about decor go to US Egg around the corner. Better service, food and coffee. Bacon took 25 mins to cook bad pancakes and serve cold coffee by a very annoying waitress.",UNK
13902,"after reading review had high expectations, unfortunately not me not my wife was able even finish our crapes, nothing else I can add to that",UNK
13903,"Didn't care for the service.  Felt as if our patronage was inconveniencing there time.  However, The food was great, but kinda pricey - $10.00 a burger I expected much more for what we got.  LOVED the sweet potato fries!",UNK
13904,1.5 miles from my home. They told me that I was outside of their delivery area. Huh? a mile and a half!! It's ok.. The party of 20 that Jimmy wouldn't feed? We called the Cheba Hut.. 6 miles away. And they delivered! Freaky nothing...,UNK
13905,Great pub for a beer after work.  Decent selection of beers at decent prices.  Plenty of large tables for groups and very attentive bartenders.,UNK
13906,"Love their smoothies, but at this location I think a monkey could make one better. My sunrise sunset was basically blended ice and turbinado. Will stay away from this one in the future.",UNK
13907,"Pretty good.  You should give it a try.  I wasn't \""wow'd\"", but the food is prepared fresh.",UNK
13908,Last time!  It was great to hear the manager yelling and cursing at employees while young kids are in the place!  Don't waste your time.  It didn't feel like the a/c was on.,UNK
13909,The decoration was good...people friendly..but cake was VERY DRY..VERY DISAPPOINTED,UNK
13910,Barber Capes is not clean at all! Others' hair is still left on it ! The worst experience I have ever had. \nI went for just hair wash and blow dry. They charged me 16 box without showed me any kind of price list. My scalp feel more itch before wash.,UNK
13911,"Nice place.  Found some really good  buys on the furniture side  Well organized.  Could use a few more vintage things, but that's just my taste.  I think my daughter would like it.  Friendly on the furniture side kind of snooty on the clothing side.",UNK
13912,"Tried 3 rolls, don't even remember the names. Wasn't the worst I've ever had, but I'll be making a point to avoid ever coming back here. Bad sushi. Ugh.\n\nSo many sushi options in Vegas to give this better than 2 stars, especially for the price.",UNK
13913,"Location is great, restaurants are great. The rooms are dated, and the remodeled ones are kind of weird. Lets just say there is no privacy when you go to the pooper, echos like a motha.",UNK
13914,You do not want to waste your time at Jolly Bob's. Yes it has fun drinks if you can actually get one. The bartender there is plain rude and it takes forever to get a drink. Food if average. Trust me a lot better places in town.,UNK
13915,"Good place to watch games. They really need to work on their food.  Nachos were cold. And a friend who was with me just said \""the ribs are better at Friday's.\"" I realize it's a sports book. An expensive one, though.",UNK
13916,wow must i say dat we went saturday night maybe cuz its october it was dead but never again..........,UNK
13917,The butter cake was the best part. Food was good but not great... Its expensive so be  prepared to drop a hundred bucks per person.,UNK
13918,Don't try to talk me in to the additional insurance you muthafugaz. You can see from my paperwork that my normal car insurance covers me in this rental. \n\nThe car you gave me was dirty and it smells like old man feet.,UNK
13919,"This place was dirty, pedicure tubs filthy, nail stations with previous clients nail clippings....FILTHY! Also, I got gels there, and when I went back to my regular lady, she had to pretty much remove my natural nails to get off the previous junk that was placed on me!",UNK
13920,I have to say I wasn't too impressed with this place. Food was ok but the service was pretty awful. No salsa or drink refills. Ive been twice now and I don't think I'll go again.,UNK
13921,"Location hurts this place. It's fun to sit outside and watch what North Tryon has to offer the first couple times going here, but it loses its luster. \n\nNo complaints, but nothing stands out here.",UNK
13922,Food ok we ordered the pork chops the menus said that they were 10oz I worked in the meat business for many years the pork chops we got were closer to 6 oz,UNK
13923,"Ok, maybe this isn't the best pizza. The one pie I had tried was the sausage mushroom melt, which was always delish! I tried another combination last time I ordered and it was cardboard-y and not so good. Meh.",UNK
13924,Totally dissapointed in this one.  Very limited menu with no salads or soups or sides to order.  Not a single starter that i would consider.  The food was good and the chicken tender.  The female waitress we had was not helpful and a little rude to us.  The setting is awesome.,UNK
13925,"Incredibly rude service from Andrea on Sept. 13. Clearly annoyed I was\n\""interrupting her\"" to make my purchase. I will not use this location ever again.",UNK
13926,"Terrible experience here. They cut up my foot when trying to remove a callus. Also, they told me they used shellac when it was really gelish. Wish I could recommend, but I wouldn't want anyone else to go through the same experience.",UNK
13927,Watery pasta and burnt garlic bread... Havent tried the pizza yet \nI couldve just as easily made a pasta and garlic bread way more worth while!  Not going to be lazy about it again smh,UNK
13928,"Overpriced for pretty-average. Being from out of town, I relied on Yelp reviews to find a nice restaurant. Restaurant looked great - but pretty empty for a Friday evening. (Why?). Food was just OK, but service was pushy.",UNK
13929,"Beautiful restaurant, awesome service, delicious bread & oil/parmesan. Very mediocre food. \n\nHowever, if you like donuts... I highly recommend Bomboloni.. one of the best deserts I've EVER had. (+1 star)",UNK
13930,Service pathetic I had to actually get up to track down my server in the kitchen...pretty much speaks for itself. ..The food was decent..the experience was not.,UNK
13931,Love the Blarney Chips!! They are waffle fries with nacho toppings on steroids! The late night menu rocks! Bar service was much better the second time around.,UNK
13932,"Our stay here was crummy from start to end. The wait to check-in was ridiculous and on top of that the person checking us in had major attitude. We were suppose to get a room in the pyramid, but they gave all the non-smoking ones away, so we got stuck in a regular tower room. boring.",UNK
13933,"A little pricey for what you get, but a cute shop close to the action on campus.  Baristas were a little cranky, but not overly so.",UNK
13934,I've given it 2 chances lately and both times it was mediocre food and disappointing service. Won't bother to go back.,UNK
13935,I hope you don't have a customer service question for the fitting room department! I literally waited 10mins with 3 employees around me trying to get their attention and  I gave up. Went to customer service and expressed my complaint. I refuse to make a purchase here.,UNK
13936,"False advertising, they say they deliver & they do, but they do no tell you they only deliver to companies not residences!  THAT REALLY, REALLY SUCKS, EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED!!!!",UNK
13937,"Nice atmosphere and food was surprisingly good, I liked the good beer selection\nThe servers were slow and needed to be reminded of drinks a few times but were helpful and nice\n It was worth it especially during happy hour\nI'll be back to try again!",UNK
13938,"Great for a no frills breakfast. Service is fine and the food is fresh and well cooked. Wished they had a more diverse menu, if you are looking for breakfast other than pancakes your options are limited.",UNK
13939,"I had high expectations from all my friend's photos, I thought it was going to be like Rehab, but no it wasn't. Small, cramped, and not a lot going on. My friend said it was good for me to try this because now I would appreciate Rehab & Wet Republic more. I guess.",UNK
13940,"Spread out. Water ride wasn't working. We did ride the train though. Staff was helpful and friendly.  They had signs posted not to bring in outside drinks and such, however I observed several individuals carrying cups from McDonalds.  Hmmmm",UNK
13941,"Pretty good resort. Our room definitely needed updating, but none of the issues that I read about in some other reviews. Restaurant was decent. Staff was good. Four pools (all with hot tubs) were all nice and clean.",UNK
13942,Its not that great. And pricing is above average compared to others. Food was just plain. Gotta love the fake reviews....,UNK
13943,"The exterior gives you and idea of what to expect inside. That being said if you want to place a quick sports bet without waiting in line, theres always available parking spots out front and the staff is always friendly.",UNK
13944,I was on my way to Paradise Bakery when this restaurant caught my attention. Looks nice and tidy and the gentleman who took my order seems so friendly and confident about the food they serve. He said that they have Chicken Slovaki which is somewhat the same like Chicken Shwarma. I had a good lunch and it was OK.,UNK
13945,"Very confusing...their Dan Dan Mien tasted like a Pad Thai, and how is it possible to make a hot & sour soup taste like tomato bisque???",UNK
13946,My first time here. I ordered the kalbi ribs which had no taste to it and I could tell it's been reheated before. Gross. I won't be eating here anytime soon.,UNK
13947,"Went last night, as I was having a salad craving and *THIS LOCATION HAS CLOSED. What a bummer! I still recommend Z as a whole, so check out another location!",UNK
13948,Sign says they open at 8am.. I was in a huge hurry and I needed something printed.  The lady in there made me wait until 8:15.  Terrible!! Just terrible,UNK
13949,"Great patio area with TVs and fireplace, but service is terrible. There was a dirty plate and glass left on table next to is for over an hour as other sat on the couches. People were complaining all around us. On Saturday night they had some sit com on instead of a football game. Left without eating dinner due to poor service.",UNK
13950,"Coming from Texas, with burger places on every corner, it's hard to view the burgers here as above average. The service was OK, the setting was entertaining, and I liked the fries. If you're in the mood for a burger, this place hits the spot.",UNK
13951,it was fine until they started letting a child take orders and ring up food.  I have three recommendations.  1. Learn the child labor laws in this country.  2.  Teach him respect.  3. Teach him to count,UNK
13952,"good ambiance, iffy wine (the house was better than the listed wines) and the cheese was not appropriate as spreadable and quite frankly the bread was bad. stay for 1 drink and move on.",UNK
13953,"Staff could use some brains, food could be better, style could be less predictable. Two bad experiences are enough, I'll eat elsewhere from now on.",UNK
13954,"I've eaten at BLT several times over the years.  The food and service are good, but it has never wowed me.  Unremarkable would be the best description.",UNK

13956,This has to be the worst Tex-Mex I've ever had. The fare is way over-priced and the margaritas are triple-sec heavy so there you go. If you want to pay too much for bad food and drink this is your place.,UNK
13957,Something about their drinks seem off. I've had Coffee Bean at several locations and this one has seemed weird every time I've been.,UNK
13958,This place Sucks.! The carne asada was terrible. They just grilled a piece of top sirloin and called it carne.! The margarita was so water downed that I couldn't even drink it.! Chips were stale and nasty.! F this place..!!!!,UNK
13959,"This nice little place is a hole in the wall. Love the service and serves fresh food. It's inside cleanness is yet to be desired and the soda machine is \""out of order\""",UNK
13960,"Ordered from them through an online delivery service once last year and despite of the generally good reviews here, the experience was largely disappointing. Food was average and the two delivery kids were acting like clowns. Apart from being able to get food from them later than anyone else, there really was no upside to it.",UNK
13961,Loud!!! Train your staff before they are on the floor. Rolls over spiced to the point you did not taste ingredient. Food served quickly and efficiently when ready. Other than that not a repeat restaurant.,UNK
13962,We've been here a number of times.  Great Pho!  Great prices. My only complaint is that the service can be slow at times and the staff isn't very organized at times to efficiently get people to their tables and served.,UNK
13963,"They have the best prepared salads but I just can't see spending such outrageous prices just for the Whole Foods Experience...which is shopping among pretentious, arrogant, tree-hugging snobs that are rude and obnoxiously unfriendly...I'll shop in Marin for that!!!",UNK
13964,"Food was very good, but a little over priced. Find it crazy this day in age that you have to pay for refills for a soda. $6 for a soda & 1 refill :(",UNK
13965,"Quick stop right across from my gate before boarding my flight back to Orange County.  Nice little bar like Fox Sports Grill with many TVs with sports on.  Food and drinks are overpriced due to being inside the airport, however I enjoyed my $9 Stella pre-flight.",UNK
13966,There's better greasy pizza to be had when you're drunk and craving food that's bad for you (particularly now that there's an Ian's on State St).  I might consider this pizza almost inedible if not drunk.,UNK
13967,Nothing to write home about....a txt will do. \n\nGood food \nGood service \nNothing special \n\nWould give it another shot. Pretty atmosphere....yes...I said pretty.,UNK
13968,"if you sit outside be prepared to wait a long time for service.  it's unfortunate :( water should be served right away. the foods good that's why I'm giving it 2 stars, but do not come hungry or thirsty.",UNK
13969,"Came here for brunch and wasn't impressed with the selection on the menu, ordered the scrambled eggs which were OK.  I will go back to try dinner at some point but I am not in a rush.",UNK
13970,"The lady working there was nice and the actual play and courses were fun for kids.\n\nThe only neg is as everyone else says, we finished in less than 20 minutes and is probably not worth the cost except for a one time visit.",UNK
13971,I have flown in and out of PHX many times and have found it to be a nice airport. Well laid out with decent food options. Of course the weather here helps with its good reputation about being low on delays.,UNK
13972,"OK you can gamble here but the retail/dining is a total, TOTAL suck fest and even though they have tons of land in Vegas the airport feels cramped and small: more like oakland then los angeles. It is spared the one star because of the very convenient location.",UNK
13973,Menu changed and the food is horrible and horribly overpriced. They are trying to go with a French flair and failed. DO NOT GO HERE. Gross!!,UNK
13974,"Service staff was friendly, though a little slow. Pretty busy for a Wednesday late morning. \nFood was your standard iHop fare. I appreciate being able to sub egg whites and fruit for a bit of a healthier start. Overall positive experience.",UNK
13975,"We literally just walked out of te restaurant after waiting at the bar and being ignored. Like other posts noted, there were tables available, but a line and 10 minute wait. Dude - get it figured out.",UNK
13976,Probably the rudest server I have ever had in my life! Very unorganized staff. Definitely will NOT be going back!!!,UNK
13977,Have been coming to this location for about 3 years now and I have to say that the level of service has declined. While I realize that payroll is always top of mind for any business I can't begin to understand why you lack sufficient staffing during your peak business hours. \nVery disappointed...,UNK
13978,"Really quite good!  Reasonably priced, lots of selection! The pizza I had delivered was delivered HOT and the ingredients were fresh. LOVE the garlic knots! Sauce isn't the best, but still very good. Will update my review when I try something other than the pizza.",UNK
13979,"Got the tortilla soup( flavorless), chorizo stuffed chicken( tasted like some something frozen, def not homemade), childrens burger( completely dry), and hot wings. I wouldn't order of them again except for maybe the wings which were ok, cause you really can't screw up wings...",UNK
13980,"Thirsty. Driving by. Got drink. Found that the Diet Sweet Tea is WAY SWEET. Multiple homeless people lying on curb, seeming to be disoriented. Really not a great location.",UNK
13981,"After La Reve, very convenient location, but really mediocre food. The Carbonara was horrible, over-cooked pasta, tasteless sauce. Mozzarella and prosciutto appetizers were beyond boring.",UNK
13982,"It's 445pm on Sunday, and it's supposed to be open, but no one is there. A little unreliable...",UNK
13983,They raised the prices on the machines by a quarter.  There still aren't enough laundry carts to go around. There are like only 7 in the entire laundromat. When it's packed it's every man for himself.,UNK
13984,It's not the best nor the worst pizza I've had. I ordered the thin crust pizza. It just tasted really average to me. Nothing stood out but it wasn't terrible either. The garlic knots were alright too.,UNK
13985,"Well haven't gone inside room yet, but walked in and receptionist don't even look T me or say hi, she says after 1 minute sign in and I'll call you when I'm ready!!  Still don't even look up, how rude!!",UNK
13986,"We try this place every few months just cause when u watch a movie at the cannery, the options are limited...and every time, it has horrible food and worse service...",UNK
13987,"We came in for $1.5 (Some were $2) tacos and $5 margaritas.  The tacos were good, nothing exceptional but for $2 or less they were good.  We were in and out pretty quickly, nothing really inviting about the place - but it was nice for a quick, cheap meal.",UNK
13988,This is a great spot. Our only complaint was the waitresses and their lack of waitressing. They didn't come to out area once all afternoon and they only seemed capable of taking 1 drink order at a time and then standing at the bar while it was made. They need some tips off of the other pool bar/clubs like Aria,UNK
13989,"I just spoke with the manager (JP) and he was VERY nice about the whole situation, so I will give Mesa Grill another shot next time I'm in Vegas.",UNK
13990,"The past three times my order did not arrive until over one hour after ordering online. Last night it took 2hrs 15mins. The service is not reliable. I was refunded the full amount, which was nice. I can't see using them again, because of the inconsistency.",UNK
13991,They are no help at all! Drove 10 miles to be told they would deliver a package without signature only to come home to a tag saying nobody there to sign. Now 10 miles back to pick it up.,UNK
13992,Food was horrible. Not comparable to LA. \nService was even worse. No one came to get us drinks for 20mins. Wave them down but get ignored. The only somewhat good service were the dim sum cart ladies. Everyone else was rude.  I rather pay more for places on the strip.,UNK
13993,Sadly this is the best Roller-coaster in Las Vegas. It's not a bad one but it is a little pricey. The best part is the view of the strip.,UNK
13994,"service WAY TOO SLOW... It's a very pricy restaurant, which it will be ok with me if it meet my expectations, but not at all!",UNK
13995,This mall doesnt contain alot of high end shops so you can actually afford to buy things here. The best thing about this mall is that it is not designed to get you lost and keep you imprisoned inside like Caesars Forum Shops.  This Mall actually has several points of escape should you become bored with shopping :),UNK
13996,"My man likes the burgers and dogs here. I am not 100% sold. I ordered the Italian Beef and if you are from Chicago, or have enjoyed a really decent beef sandwich in Chicago, This beef sandwich was a huge disappointment. So next time I will stick with a burger or dog.",UNK
13997,"I got the lamb kebab and 5 mins after I took a bite I had to pull over and throw up, NEVER AGAIN!!!!",UNK
13998,My father wanted to take his grand daughter   out for ice cream.  He suggested a national chain. I suggested we support a local business. HUGE MISTAKE!  Snarky service and attitude from the woman at the counter. First and last time I set foot in this place. Over priced mediocre product.,UNK
13999,"Paid for breakfast, and stayed til lunch.  Got to enjoy both meals.  Not a bad deal.  The downside is that the quality and service lacked.",UNK
14000,"It's a great please if you want something greasy - I do like the lasagne wrap. very good. If you go during the \""Furry\"" convention - it's always a sight. And you can get lunch in a dog bowl.",UNK
14001,The Worst buffet ever! Almost everything is un-freshed and the price is ridiculous high. It is even not worth 10$!,UNK
14002,"Wanted to try this place out from the great reviews I had heard from friends. Long lines, no where to sit, overpriced pastries, and service wasn't that great..",UNK
14003,"Fair at best. Equipment has been somewhat upgraded from the old unusable equipment, but is STILL not particularly usable. Other LA Fitness centers in the Phonix area are much, MUCH better with equipment significantly easier to use. I would be embarrased to work at this club.",UNK
14004,This bakery opened in January and features Texas-style donuts and kolaches.  I took a pass on the kolaches in favor of an apple fritter and a cake donut which we shared in the room.  Both were good.  \n\nA rating of 2.5 would be most appropriate.,UNK
14005,"Not the best bakery, but okay, given you're in a cultural wasteland. The cafe serves Harney Teas (my favorite) and has tasty chocolate-covered strawberries. Don't go out of your way, but if you need a quick snack, there's not much else around (without tons of walking).",UNK
14006,"Uggg. Went here during lunch this past week. Sux. The lady who did my nails was very stale. Now, two days later my nails are chipping the color. Not to mention the nail where half the acryllic chipped. Save ur money. Go somewhere else.",UNK
14007,Anyone think that over $800 to replace a fuel pump is a bit pricey? The ol' bait and switch is in effect. $94 per hour labor charge plus markup on parts. Go there if you have too much money in your life.,UNK
14008,Over priced breakfast all hype sorry just my opinion I was really let down since friend always talked about it ..you will pay 10$ for breakfast ..eggs and hash browns,UNK
14009,Naan is definitely not indian..... i like it but it's not naan it's more off a domino's garlic bread type of thing,UNK
14010,"Pretty good BBQ,  pulled turkey was a little dry but the green been casserole and the mac and cheese redeemed it for 3 stars. The ambiance is cool so i would still definitely come back. Live music outside is a huge plus.",UNK
14011,"Prices here are crazy high for being a big lots. I'll give them that the store inside looks nice and they have many things to choose from compare to other big lots, but $15 for a pillow? When I can get the same one at Target or Walmart..Methinks not.",UNK
14012,"Very dirty seriously needs updated. Stains on chairs in room, horrible shower will not stay here again. To top it off a homeless bum urinated in middle of casino and guest services did nothing to remove him or even care. He was allowed to wander around casino. Dont stay there.",UNK
14013,Not even close to the best BBQ!  I don't understand the high reviews for this place!  Honestly you can get better BBQ at a chain!,UNK
14014,"This was my second time seeing it and it's just OK. maybe not my thing. I fell asleep in the middle of the show. It gets slow and boring sometimes. Best part is the drumming, the balls and the ending!!!",UNK
14015,Came for the vegan pizza on Wednesday night and none available.  If you are going to advertise vegan than please offer it.,UNK
14016,Horrible dentist. Tried to upsell me on literally everything and told me I needed six fillings replaced (that had been done all within the last few years). Plus the facility itself was dirty. Gross!,UNK
14017,"My husband and I went here on a groupon so I'm not going to be too judgmental. \nJust a few points, the clientele are in their 70's, store bought salad dressing, $13 for THREE shrimp. Food and service were mediocre, not worth the high price.",UNK
14018,The food is good but the service is awful... But then again I am not here for the service.... it's all about the food and no need to leave a tip for the waiter - saves me money,UNK
14019,"I deem this place middle of the road.  Seating is comfortable and the noise level is low - good for a business lunch.  But the food is average at best.  Did not \""pop\"" with flavor.",UNK
14020,"Don't order the pulled pork sandwich. It made me sick all night long and couldn't leave the hotel room all the next day, ruined my trip to Vegas",UNK
14021,"Mediocre food, super fast service, good sangria.\n\nUnimpressed with the four dishes we had. Lamb chops were good. Polpo overcooked. Again; very fast service. Fed and full in under an hour on a Friday night.",UNK
14022,"In the District, outside seating...like having a lil shindig in your garage! For some reason it doesn't get at busy as it used to be still doing their thang! food is pretty good, drinks specials.",UNK
14023,"Yes, its part of a chain.\nYes, its better than TGIF or CHILI'S.\nNo, its not a 5 star expierence.\nExpect average food and service.\nThey have a wonderful bread basket.",UNK
14024,Hour and a half wait. Tried to talk to nurse and she just walked away. There's plenty of other urgent cares in the area. Try someone else.,UNK
14025,Good pizza and wings.  Just have to be super clear on any special requests.  Like extra sauce on side plus regular sauce on wings for example.,UNK
14026,I ordered HOT WINGS and got REGULAR FATTY WINGS. My pizza looked like a card board burn disc. The lady on the phone always RUDE. I will never order again.,UNK
14027,Don't buy the Yelp coupon. It's not good during happy hour and Yelp doesn't say that (which it should before you buy it),UNK
14028,Small and simple location. They have lots of flavours to try out. It is a nice quiet atmosphere. Very relaxing and I like the dim lights ...,UNK
14029,"This is sub par to the other frozen custard places that have pooped up like weeds as of late. The place smelled and was dirty. The food was over priced and tasted bland. The concrete was okay, nothing special. This is place will close down before to long.",UNK
14030,"Nothing gourmet here, greasy fried food. Barely any crab legs.I didn't eat much and I kept throwing good away cause it was nasty. Save your money and go elsewhere.\n\nNot going there again",UNK
14031,Great Customer Services ... Stella And James Erique is awesome... I took my car to get my struts change but it was a defective one... Will re-update my review until its fully fixed .... Stella is awesome.....,UNK
14032,"Food was good, only thing is that in our party of 7 they tried to charge us an automatic 18% gratuity when this is not stated on the menu. For most places is when you have an 8 group. Awful experience, even they called security.",UNK
14033,"Definitely not a fan. Coming from Orange County, CA, I have high expectations when it comes to Asian food.  Suffice to say that Panda Express would have been a better choice, which is pretty sad.",UNK
14034,OMG huge sandwiches.  I could not even fit the monte cristo in my mouth without heavy squishing beforehand.  It wasnt the best but it was the biggest I had eaten.  Big menu but things tend to be a little greasy and the  bakery stuff was a bit stale when we got it home.  Still pretty good!,UNK
14035,"this is a fun place to have dinner with your loved one or with friends. Food is good, and service is always friendly. I dont crave it very often though, its not very different from an applebees or chilis per say, but its a nice place.",UNK
14036,"I like this place.  The people are friendly and the food is good.  It is definetly quiet.  I must say though, I enjoy a good quiet setting from time to time.  It is a wonder how they stay in business though.  It's always sparce on the patrons.",UNK
14037,Bad bad bad service. Stood at the bar for 10 minutes and still never got acknowledged. Some of the most absent minded bar service there is. Food is not worth the price. I know it's a chain but they could do so much better. Chains usually mean some sort of consistently. Not here. Cross it off your list.,UNK
14038,Inexpensive by Vegas standard but you get what you pay for.  Much of it seemed to be pre-packaged frozen or out of a #10 can.  It was edible and if ya get enough it'll fill ya up.,UNK
14039,"Ice cream is ice cream in my opinion no matter where you go, so when I want an ice cream break while at work I'll make a stop here. Only problem is the customer service is so-so and the employees definitely like to take their sweet time serving you (no pun intended).",UNK
14040,"I have had the pizza and wings many times, but it's just because of family purchasing it. It's just boring. \n\nNot enough toppings, sauce is exactly as the same as all other pizza companies. \n\nThey just don't stand out as anything fresh or different.",UNK
14041,"I actually prefer this Lodge to the others in the area. For whatever reason, it just seems lighter and prettier. It is less of a party-like scene and more friendly. And the bartenders are nicer. Plus, karaoke nights are kinda fun and awesome.",UNK
14042,"I had an appointment for 1pm, and the lady clerks are very rude, not energetic,  look tired or if they have a gun to their head like their forced to work here-I'm didn't get in till 2pm. ..really sad, whoever is in charge of this place-you need new front clerk staff",UNK
14043,"Hit this place up for a quick happy hour meal. Had to have the enchiladas, they were a little dry. Parking may be an issue if this place was busier.",UNK
14044,Service sucked!! Food is salty and the price is expensive. The three main category of a restaurant! Just did not do it for me. Will not come back ever!!,UNK
14045,So looking forward to this anniversary meal with my wife and so disappointed! Great service but the scallop risotto and beef wellington we were so looking forward to was almost inedible. The standards we see on Hells Kitchen were not present tonight.,UNK
14046,"Wings were tasty. Ordered by phone and 10 minutes later we took our delicious smelling wings home. Asked for extra crispy, but they steamed up up in the boxes. Sill tasted very good.",UNK
14047,"Poor service, cardboard cookies, flavorless cakes. A huge disappointment, everything we bought ended up in the trash uneaten.  Bouchon just down the corridor is much, much better.",UNK
14048,"All I ever get here are the chicken fajitas and those are fairly hard to screw up.  Anything else I've tired here has been sub-par.  Really, the best thing about this place is the freshly-made tortillas.",UNK
14049,"I am not happy about the service, the waitress seemed absent minded. The sashimi is not fresh. I used my groupon and will not return. Not a repeat guest.",UNK
14050,"They're closed!!  Went to go have lunch there today, door was locked, looked inside and it was empty.  Hoping they're opening somewhere else in the area, but no note on the door.  Very sad...",UNK
14051,Do not fix your I phone here. They use cheap parts and everytime you get something done here another part fails shortly after. Not worth all the trouble.,UNK
14052,"Great food and decent prices, but small portions so it's a little pricier. Gave it a three because I like good breakfast places that give you a good amount of food for decent price... Not this place. However, the food is very good!",UNK
14053,"Clean taxi but these people are unreliable. 30 minutes late when I needed a cab ride to the airport. They already \""picked me up\"" without even calling to tell me the taxi was here. Poor service.",UNK
14054,McDonald's has the best diet coke hands down! Other then that I really try to avoid the food. I do appreciate the fact that all Phoenix McDonald's have beat regulation to the punch and started posting all the calorie counts for food on their menus. Now you can more easily make an educated decision on your food choices.,UNK
14055,"I really liked the burger, get's 4 stars. Quality meat, veggies, good cheese, cooked right.  The fries were good too.  But $11.30 for the combo, that seems a bit expensive to me.  Thus, 3 stars.",UNK
14056,This place is a ripped off beware of them !!! They lie so much my experience same as Nicole m I never recommend this  place to anyone they r not honest people I'm going to bring my business somewhere else where I know they don't cheat on me,UNK
14057,Very dissatisfied with the Customer Service. Walked in and the gentleman was on the phone and yelling for a employee. Before I could tell him what I had he said not interested. There was no reason to back up as to why.,UNK
14058,"My knee replacement in 2011 by Dr. Koe was described by another specialist as the \""worst surgery I have ever seen\"".  I had to get the knee replacement done over again 6 months after the original surgery with extensive reconstructive titanium rods put in my legs.",UNK
14059,"It's like they moved the suburbs into a blighted town and tried to ignore there used to actually be a town there. \n\nIf you like chain restaurants and retail stuff, this place is for you.",UNK
14060,Did not enjoy my meal ... In fact all for of us didnt. The enchilada sauce was watered down. the tostada shell was  burnt and soggy . Possible. Very nice people and a clean restaurant. But would not go back.,UNK
14061,"Decent for a \""farm\"" located in town - though a little pricey for what you get. The larger east valley farms put on much more of a spectacle. This is good for children under 7 I suppose. Oh, and someone save those poor chickens that have been stripped of half their feathers!",UNK
14062,Disappointed to say the last.  \n\nAmbience - 1\nService - 1\nFood - 2\n\nReminded us of a place headed for Kitchen Nightmares.,UNK
14063,"In the east end of downtown Charlotte, this place is in a very good location.  It's mainly for the public transportation system.  It's also really close to different venues in the area.",UNK
14064,"I admire what this place does, they collect and restore old fashioned furniture to an excellent standard, so much so that they offer a 15 year guarantee on everything.\n\nWhat I don't admire is the \u00a3995 for a table...",UNK
14065,one specific member lacked on customer service...  And for a starbucks employee I expected more. Its not busy yet it took awhile to receive just my Black tea.... Manager was polite and assisted with my short n simple order. But oh well I guess ... tsk tsk,UNK
14066,Really nice people working here from the shuttle bus to the lobby and breakfast service.  The rates are fantastic and they're close to the airport.,UNK
14067,"The beef cheeks ravioli was the highlight of the meal -- the chop salad was just okay, and I make a better ribeye at home on our grill, unfortunately.  Still a really nice restaurant, but for $400 for two people, I would have wanted it to be a very memorable steak.",UNK
14068,Worst waitress ever with horrible customer service! I'm still pissed that they required our table to give her an 18% tip. And happy hour apps....well I've had much better! Will never go again.,UNK
14069,We ordered delivery on a night we didn't want to go out based on the reviews. This was not good! It came hot but the crust tasted like it was previously frozen. The wings tasted like someone threw hot sauce on a rotisserie chicken. This won't be somewhere we order from again. Yuck!,UNK
14070,"the phone number is disconnected. and it looks like a new smoothie place has replaced this. it used to be next to as you wish, right? and it stinks cuz I have groupons that I intended to use at this location.",UNK
14071,"Waitress was very nice and responsive. A lot of hot food items were actually way under temp, potential for people to get sick. Very low quality food for the amount of money we paid.",UNK
14072,Interesting place. I have eaten here before but not enough to correctly rate it so I gave it 3 . Mexican American & Chinese food. All things to all people? Perhaps. We'll see.,UNK
14073,Bad customer service and also food wasnt fresh.\n Also try tonorder some stuff in the menu but they didnt have....,UNK
14074,"***Heads up, the free Garlic Knots are not available for free with just a check in, I was informed I had to buy a large pizza in order to receive!***",UNK
14075,The hotels pretty cool. I mean after going to every casino on the strip its just like the others. The scenery is pretty cool yet  nothing great stands out about it.,UNK
14076,I only recommend this location for the beer and sports. The food is not the best and the service is less than average. If you're looking to grab a drink and watch a game then this is a good spot. Anything else and you may be disappointed.,UNK
14077,The food is DISGUSTING and I would never patronize a place that treats its employees so horribly.  Does not deserve my business or yours.  Stay.  Away.,UNK
14078,It's harder to find because it's located under the steps in the plaza.  It looks dodgy but this is a legit place.  Service was good and it's decent in pricing for the area.,UNK
14079,This place was ok for a quick bite to eat... their was only one chef and a very long wait  about 20 min. the food was medium priced and was good.  would eat again if was hungry and didnt want to go to far.,UNK
14080,The Party was fun despite the doorman.  I am not used to spending a lot of money on a cabana and being treated so rudely.  He was a jerk and acted like we were such an inconvenience to him.,UNK
14081,"Up-charges most of their products that you can find on B&H for way less money. Sales person treated me like I was a very inexperienced. Not a bad place if you're in need of camera gear without a moments notice, but overall definitely order offline.",UNK
14082,I had high expectations when I came here. I think this place is popular because it has no name and just known as secret pizza. The pizza is ok. Hardly any seating. It kind felt like I was getting pizza at the mall. The staff was friendly and it wasn't too expensive.,UNK
14083,"Walked in on a busy fish fry night for the first time.  No hostess spot, so we wondered around until a waitress barked at us to go to one of the bartenders.  The bar was two people deep so that was nearly impossible.  Maybe the food here is that great but we left after feeling very unwelcome.",UNK
14084,"Other than the spiciness, I was very underwhelmed by their pad thai.\n\nThe employee who took my order messed up twice while trying to take my order over the phone only to be told by a second employee that I can't place the order and receive the discount unless I do it online.",UNK
14085,"Not bad, but have had much better anywehere else... can skip it for the cupcakes. Staff was very friendly and nice, the facility was comfy and drinks were good; go because of that and you'll enjoy youself.",UNK
14086,"Worst service ever! The server spilled hot food on me and did not even acknowledge, let alone say sorry. She was flat out mean. I would rather starve than eat here again.",UNK
14087,Went in at breakfast time it was semi busy. ..but not packed. Walked out after 45 mins of waiting for a sandwich. I went to the waffle house instead.,UNK
14088,Al's is your basic bar. Twelve or so item food menu on the wall. Four or five tap beers. Coors light happy hour specials for football and that's all folks. Charger bar for you bolts fans,UNK
14089,"Went to this place trusting Yelp to guide me right.  Overall feeling was \""meh\"".  It just seemed there was no love in the food.  Tempura was just sufficient.  Nothing really stuck out as amazing.  I have absolutely no idea why it gets so many good reviews on the site.",UNK
14090,"Our first steak sandwich from you and it was good but I'm sorry to say its only half the size of a \""philly cheesesteak\""...maybe raise the price a bit and make it bigger! I had to buy my guy a taco from lulu's after dinner to fill him up....",UNK
14091,"While on a rode trip, my front driver side wheel was making some squeaking noise. I took my 1998 Volvo v70 to them for service. I recently found out from my trusted local mechanic that Volvo of Las Vegas used a cheap Made in China wheel bearing and charged me for the higher end stock Volvo part. Very dissatisfied!",UNK
14092,food is ok.service!!?? lets just say rude!!! our server didnt say much other than how many ppl ..no refills unless we asked..!i should have listen to my friends..this place sucks!!,UNK
14093,Food does not taste good.  The food is boring and bland.  I regretted eating there the moment I tasted the food.  I will stick with the other Mexican food place down the street which is cheaper and the food tastes better!,UNK
14094,"I was in last night for a little nibble before the Symphony.  The bar area is very attractive.  I had an Erath pinot noir, crab cakes and the bacon wrapped dates.  All pretty good but nothing to right home about and a little pricy for what you get if it's not happy hour.",UNK
14095,"Got myself al pastor and tripas , and they were pretty good , but never compared to the tacos el gordo from Tijuas.....I will recommend still , but be prepared to spend above average",UNK
14096,Pasta sauce had no flavor on either of our dishes. My Chardonnay tasted watered down and I didn't finish it.  My husband's dish really wasn't any better.  I would definitely not recommend this place to anyone who actually likes good Italian.,UNK
14097,"I will drive out of my way 10 miles to got to the Southeastern location rather than go to this Cafe Rio. They have the slowest service and the portions seem to be smaller as well. Please open another location in the area, preferably in Southern Highlands. I think the all around service and customer satisfaction would improve that way.",UNK
14098,"The only reason you go to coffee shop is because you have to. Either other lines are longer, everything is closed, or it's breakfast time. The service is kind of crappy. While the servers are friendly, they are always seem understaffed. The food is fine, nothing special.",UNK
14099,I wasn't too impressed with the food. It was kinda of a let down since our Friends raved about it. \n\nEven the service was poor. I most likely won't go back.,UNK
14100,"My husband and I have been here twice for lunch and twice for dinner. I'm just not impressed. Food is okay. Service is okay. Gelato is really good. Casual place, okay prices. Sorry I can't say much else!",UNK
14101,"Can't say I'm a fan. Sad cuz I love hummus. The pita was hard to choke down, it iis served cold and it was very dry. However, the place is very clean and a cool atmosphere. I will give them another try and get something different. Maybe it was just an off day.",UNK
14102,"I was severely disappointed in Geno's. Their food was dry and bland. For a place the advertises cheesesteaks in their name, you would think their cheesesteak would be special.  it was far from it. I won't go there again,  and I wouldn't recommend it for anyone.",UNK
14103,"The menu online sounded great, however upon arrival I wasn't impressed. I got a Caesar salad. I was disappointed that they didn't have croutons. That makes the salad. I ordered the quesadilla. I wasn't impressed nw hitched we had eaten elsewhere.",UNK
14104,Great atmosphere for sports enthusiast especially Michigan fans. Food is average but a little pricey. Service is also pretty good as long as you don't mind waiting for about 15 minutes for a beer.\n\n   Personally I think for a social hangout for the average sports fan this is a great place for you.,UNK
14105,"Visiting from out of town wanted to cut my waist length hair, walked in no wait, Rhonda did my cut exactly how I envisioned it quickly. All the staff were friendly and kind made a hot. Made a Busy day of errand less stressful, THANK YOU!",UNK
14106,Im on this Thai kick and couple of friends told me to try this place out because its super close to my place but I guess this place is closed down it says they closed at 10 p.m. But it's 7:11 p.m. and it's close????,UNK
14107,Pomegranate margarita: to die for! Other than that had horrible service. Now to make matters worse my boyfriend and I ate here around 10pm one night. Let's just say he ended up with food poisoning. Stay away from the mahi mahi tacos. Vomiting and everything. Horrible experience.,UNK
14108,"Burgers are all good, nothing great.  The milk shakes are bomb though, and even though small, they are thick and rich.  Great view and tasty milk shakes make this a nice lunch spot, but thats it.",UNK
14109,Usually in the past they have been pretty fast and getting people through.  At least that has been my experience. I'm here several times a year relating to my daughter.  Today is not that case. They have more windows then I have evr seen open at once with sllllooowwweesstt service I have ever seen.,UNK
14110,"Bad place to eat, tastes like dog food, bland and no taste, I swear they use canned dog food or some garbage, this place I will never go to again!",UNK
14111,"I give it a one for the fact my buddy and I did not shit our pants on the way home... That being said, it was due entirely to the extreme efforts our colons put forth!!   DO NOT EAT HERE UNLESS YOU LIKE MILD FOOD POISONING!",UNK
14112,"Poor customer service. Do not hold to their quote. Techs who come out don't know pricing, neither does the office person answering the phone.",UNK
14113,"nice club. playmates on bottom floor. Dance floor and balconay (like rain) on the 2nd. Music was great, women was great, and bottle service was fast. 3 stars because i still had to wait 2 hrs to get in with VIP priviledges. 3 stars because it cost 40 bucks to get in.",UNK
14114,"Stay away as far as you can from this buffet. Got food poisoning after eating at this place. Besides for the price they are charging, the food selection wasn't that good all. Stay Away.",UNK
14115,Located at the edge of the strip next to Hooters.  Great selection with decent prices.  Watch out for the bums panhandling!,UNK
14116,"I ordered a taco salad, as I was eating it, I almost cracked my tooth on a small rock or pebble. When I called to tell them, they said it was impossible and I must be mistaken. Ridiculous.",UNK
14117,This was the most disorganized mess   I will never go back.  Even when they gave us free tickets for the inconvenience that the performer loni love canceled.    I wonder why she canceled.,UNK
14118,When I called I started talking and she said hold and put me on hold about 5 mins later she finally got back on and was very rude.\n\nWill not send people there!!!!,UNK
14119,"Ugh, this place is terrible!  It looks good, and it smells good, but it unfailingly ALWAYS disappoints!  I seriously have not had one dish that tasted close to right.  Its salty and very flavorful, but somehow it just tastes off.  I've tried a lot of dishes here too.",UNK
14120,"Best place to go if you're  DRUNK. Never knew cardboard could tastes so good... At 5.88 a slice real, bargain here in Vegas, lol wasn't even worth a picture I'm certain  y'all know what pizza looks like.",UNK
14121,"Basic breakfast you can get anywhere. They didn't serve real butter, the biscuits were dense, and coffee weak. Atmosphere is nice and staff was great. I will not be bookmarking this one though",UNK
14122,"Why are all our reviews being filtered or deleted? Something is very wrong here and this needs to end! If you are researching moon doggies rescue, make sure you click on the very bottom tab (filtered) there are about 10 reviews that were filtered with true stories regarding this company.",UNK
14123,I wish I could do zero stars! I scheduled an appointment (and received a confirmation) only to wait two hours with no show and also no call back! I was extremely disappointed and wish I had read the reviews ahead of time.,UNK
14124,Food is good but not the waitresses.  Phyco waitress won't refill your coffee.  Weekend waitresses are to busy gabbing about their personal life's.     Service not good,UNK
14125,"Actually, want to give this 0 stars. I was asked to sit at the chef counter when I did not want to and they had about 6 booths open....ridiculous....will never step in that restaurant again.",UNK
14126,"Bought a mattress and delivery was scheduled a week later. We changed our mind to cancel it next day itself but they won't cancel it even though delivery date is still few days later. Avoid this place, there are so many good places where we can return/cancel if not satisfied.",UNK
14127,"about what I expected (for better or worse)...but they closed before 2am on a holiday weekend (actually kicked us out when we wanted to run back in to use their photobooth, the only reason I'd go back) - this ain't a real bar, not in Vegas...sorry",UNK
14128,Was not impressed my last visit.  Sushi quality has gone downhill or something.. What is normally cold sushi was literally at room temperature. The hot items were literally at room temperature as well.  My stomach did not feel too well for 2 days after my visit here..,UNK
14129,I do not understand how a plate of pasta and a glass of wine can turn into a $60 bill. Quality of the dish is more in line with a $5 plate fom a food court.,UNK
14130,Good food...CRAPPY service!.(and they werent busy)...how hard is it to bring us refills on drinks?!...The server got a tip she deserved-which was nothing!!...,UNK
14131,"Pros: Decent basic rooms (Clean but nothing great),  nice location, price \n\nCons: Elevators and room numbers are confusing, too crowded",UNK
14132,Chips & salsa AND bean dip.  Salsa seems to have improved.  \nGreen chile con carne.  Mmm.,UNK
14133,"After 10 PM they stop serving mashed potatoes. Service is usually slow. The cooks don't really know how to cook properly. Not impressed at all. If you want a sit down late night, go to Arizona Charlie's.",UNK
14134,Horrible service.  To and from drivers changed every pickup/dropoff resulting in inconsistent pickup time/location. We had the bus for 3 nights.  Pickup was late one night and bus literally broke down the other.  Save yourself the hassle and money--stay far far away from this service.,UNK
14135,"Food tasted less than average, kind of Chef Boyardeeish.  The owner complained how business is nothing what it used to be and snuffed at my Groupon and spoke under his breath and complained about people using plastic instead of the good ole days when everyone paid cash!  Go figure.  I won't be back again.",UNK
14136,It was not what this thing hyped it out to be. A total fail. I wouldnt choose this place over Wendys.,UNK
14137,Gross. Paid $68 for 2 adults and 1 11 yo child.... What a waste of money! Barely any food selection and what they do have is just plain nasty. I tried to play it safe and have a salad... The dressing tasted funny... I wish I could have gotten my money back!,UNK
14138,The hostess/waitress was stained with food from head to toe.  The food was not appealing looking and the taste was comparable to the fast food chains.  The aftereffect is what pushed me to write this review as I am now very sick.,UNK
14139,"The only other restaurant in Rio where you can get a burger and fries on a late night. It was ok. I had the Jalapeno Burger. It was a bigger than a normal size, but it I mean it is a little bit more pricey. Good for late night snack. That's all. =]",UNK
14140,"Very friendly staff, $7.99 breakfast, couple bucks more for \""nicer Station\"" with fancy decor. Ordinary food, a couple exotics, omelette station.",UNK
14141,"We went here on a Sunday afternoon and they weren't too busy. Sunday is when the kids eat free, so we were happy.  The food was great, maybe not the ambience of a Kansas City smoke house, but good BBQ none the same.  Try the pull pork, sausages or brisket.  Enjoy!",UNK
14142,The custard wasn't bad but not good enough to want the hostile unfriendly attitude from the Asian woman who served us. She was too unhappy to be serving frozen delights to anyone. Eating dessert - that's a happy event - not sour gummie style! Meh.,UNK
14143,"Drinks were good, me and wifey had margaritas.  The service was fast and the food was pretty good. I do believe the timely service and friendly attitudes out shined the food.",UNK
14144,"I went on easter Sunday because most places were packed. One of the worst places I've been to. Their food was terrible and was just overwhelming. And we asked what the waiter thought was good, but it wasnt wat we hoped for.",UNK
14145,"The food is of decent quality and relatively inexpensive. It is a typical  Asian-fast-food  joint, so don't expect anything fancy. Location is convenient (Camelback Colonnade area), and parking is ample.",UNK
14146,"Standard gyros, salads and fries kind of place. Great deal on the combo meals for $8. The restaurant is good for take-out or you can eat it there, plenty of seating for their average traffic. Parking lot right in front has plenty of space.",UNK
14147,"Nice patio and atmosphere, but food is mediocre at best. Too many other good breakfast places out there like JJ's and Soul.",UNK
14148,I have no idea what the buzz is about unless they hired a good PR agency. The burgers are as average as possible which makes the place over priced. Try Smashburger or Lucky Boy if you want a really great burger.,UNK
14149,"very surrealistic, they had a guy mopping the floors and water girl who was always caring water classes, no one to take orders, I think water girl was supposed to, hopefully not mop boy, after almost a half hour waiting for someone to take our orders we left.",UNK
14150,Wow. Im a local and im in the service industry. The service was probably the worst ive ever had in my life. If you want to be treated like complete crap when you dine out then this is the place for you! I wish there was a negative star rating for this place!!!!!,UNK
14151,One word... booger.  On my strawberry shake there was a booger that got stuck to my finger. Never never again will I ever eat at Del Taco and will try to convince anyone else not to as well.  When I tell someone about the booger it's pretty easy to sway their decision.,UNK
14152,"My fault for not yelping this place before I ate here. THE FOOD IS TERRIBLE. if u go here -  have a drink and go somewhere else for dinner.  Service is excellent, food sucks!",UNK
14153,"I hate this McDonald's. With all my life. Slowest service of all time and out of the 4 times I've been here, they made me wait/pull around because they couldn't get food out in a normal time. Worst ever.",UNK
14154,I waited forever for our food and it was just two of us. The entrees were incredibly bland. I will probably not return\n\nNice atmosphere though.,UNK
14155,"we came here for show around 9pm. The service is not too bad, but food is hard to swallow. Food is way to salty, very few choices.",UNK
14156,"Very poor customer service. Waited in line for just under an hour. After I told the salesperson I was declining all coverage, he still tried to sell it to me, and then asked me to give him the deductible of my insurance, which I have never been asked for before, and declined to give him.",UNK
14157,wish the pool was open last week all the pools were dead only a wading pool what a waste of a 500 + cabana we got,UNK
14158,"Nobody in here, and service is horrible! Waitress hasn't come around one time. Flies everywhere (and we're inside), no excuse. I had a pizza that was not good at all.",UNK
14159,"I had the avocado club regular burger with sweet potato fries and a vanilla shake. The burger needed some seasoning, fries were good and the shake was watery. Burger King shakes are much better. For the price, I'd rather go pick up a burger at Blue 32.",UNK
14160,"Another Roberto's!\n\nThere's no difference to me between this location and the one on Blue Diamond, except for the fact that it has a little bit more seating.\n\nStill a solid late night choice for food. Hell yeah.",UNK
14161,"Underwhelming amount of flavors (really, no pistachio?) and overpriced. The gelato itself was just ok.  I've definitely had better. I guess if you're in a pinch and really hard up, maybe get this? But I wouldn't recommend it.",UNK
14162,This is a cute little place to grab a bite to eat. I didn't think my veggie burrito was anything to write home about but it was alright. I felt things were a little pricey but I might be willing to go back and give it another based on others rave reviews.,UNK
14163,"It tempted us with unconventional, sunny Mexican style architecture, but amount of time we had to spend inside to get regular coffee added up to about 20 min. And we were almost only ones there! Worst sbux ever.",UNK
14164,wasnt the great experince but who knows... maybe i jsut came on a bad night. the bartenders were very accomodating tho. ;),UNK
14165,I was extremely disappointed by the rude treatment I received.  I would not recommend this shop to anyone.  As a matter of fact I got a Yelp account for the sole purpose of rating this shop.,UNK
14166,"Take two shots of penicillin and a tetnus shot after eating/drinking here.  And for god's sake stay out of the bathrooms.  Don't believe me, check out the expert reviews on Maricopa.gov, restaurant ratings...pretty yuk!",UNK
14167,"I was excited to try Rao's, but sadly quite disappointed by the food. Other than the meatball, which I thought was good, the rest of the food I tried was just ok. Not worth the money in my opinion. There are so many other great restaurant in Vegas, that I wouldn't go back.",UNK
14168,"All of the dos gringos are about the same, unique atmosphere but food isnt that great and only beer on special is pacifica. Does have some games like bean bag toss so its an decent place to hang out in the late evenings but I never eat there anymore.",UNK
14169,"Always super busy when there's a game or fight-- food isn't bad, servers can be kind of rude but in a fun way.\n\nI recommend coming here to watch a game, otherwise I don't know what the point is.",UNK
14170,"When El Vino first opened and up until recently they have been my favorite but things are staring to go downward decline in thier cooking.\nThe staff seams service is still exceptional but the cooking has changed. I hope they go back to what made them great,  I ate thier last night and was not impressed.",UNK
14171,Best view of any bar restaurant in the world.  Terrible decor and average food. Looks like a high school kids basement. I do believe this place needs John Taffer and bar rescue BAD. Come here for apps and beer and bring a camera,UNK
14172,"Tried to redeem a voucher I purchased on Living Single, they denied it. Instead they tried to upsell me to pay twice what I paid on Living Social. They also wouldn't refund the price of the voucher.",UNK
14173,Great outdoor patio on the strip to people watch and just relax!  Went for lunch.  Had the salmon and egg salad tartine and the seafood crepe.,UNK
14174,honestly this starbucks is so slow and sometimes i get lukewarm lattes or incorrect drink orders (mind you. this is the only place that screws up my order and sometimes im just ordering a dopio over ice)\n\nhowever its walking distance from my house and very conveniant and i know all the staff,UNK
14175,"Great Gyros!! Don't be deterred by the long line as they move you through fairly quick. Friendly, attentive staff that prepare a great product at a fair price. Will visit again next time I'm in town and attending an ASU baseball tournament at phoenix municipal stadium.",UNK
14176,"Sort of \""chain-ish\"" but the food we had was pretty good. I liked that the side of beans were fresh (not refried & covered in cheap cheese) and the rice had roasted sweet corn in it (also not smothered in cheap cheese). Overall, enjoyable.",UNK
14177,"This place sucks and It's overpriced..fat boy behind the counter was trying to get funny, he should feel lucky i didn't knock his ass out!",UNK
14178,"After waiting for hours to get a table, FINALLY!!!  I can't believe that I consumed so much sushi in an hour.\n\nThe fishes are fair, the service is sub-par, but the prices are really good.",UNK
14179,It has closed. Just a warning to all you other restaurants putting out mediocre food followed by poor service... THIS COULD BE YOUR FATE. Only saving grace this place had was decent live music.,UNK
14180,Not all that its cracked up to be. I'm giving it an extra star just for the amusing conversation I had with this drunk gentleman. The dancers are not even aiit.,UNK
14181,"despite only being 2 other tables at 7pm, it took a whole 15 minutes for anyone to even acknowledge us, limited menu, the food took forever and it was below average. the only reason i gave it two stars was for the atmosphere.",UNK
14182,New to area was looking for a hair cut for my son. Short haired lady cut his hair. I showed her a picture of a short haired taper. She left long on top and the shape of his Mohawk in the back. I won't return.,UNK
14183,"If food poisoning your wife (+) \""we'll make her another San Francisco roll for the trouble\"" = worth it... then this is your place for you. Have fun.",UNK
14184,"Good, but still just a cupcake, if you need a sweet go to Bosa donuts..   If you need a cupcake do the Pineapple upside down...",UNK
14185,Greasy unappetizing fried food. Low quality ingredients. Pretty much tastes all the same.\n\nNever again.,UNK
14186,Wonderful food but the owner is RUDE and Disrespectful.  I would not take the chance.  There are many other restaurants that want the business.   Go somewhere else!,UNK
14187,This place was just okay.  The food I felt was mediocre however the service was very good.  There was no one in the restaurant when I went which seemed a little bizarre.  I had the chicken kabob and it wasn't that great.  The chicken seemed a little dry and kinda bland. Overall just average.,UNK
14188,I guess their pizza taste great if you're drunk. Slices are so bland and bad. Nothing special here. Overpriced as well. Villa Francesca has much better slices. Check them out instead.,UNK
14189,"Food is average to below average; I'd say about 2.5 stars quality. But for the price they are charging,  2 stars.",UNK
14190,"Cool hotel.\n\nA bit off the strip :/\n\nHey, I won money!\n\nEvo 2011 was a blast though.",UNK
14191,Lunch buffet...poor tasting food.. they tried to cover the taste w spiciness.. would not recommend,UNK
14192,"I ordered delivery based on positive yelp reviews and was wildly disappointed.  Worse than school cafeteria pizza.  Flaccid crust.  Nasty ketchup-esque sauce.  Just abysmal.  I assume the wings are amazing, because the pizza is among the worst I've ever had.",UNK
14193,"The course was in very bad shape and is outdated. I wouldn't play it again, especially with so many other options in the area",UNK
14194,"Went back recently for a Schlitz in a can, but ended up getting smoked out, and not in the good way. \n\nIn the 6-12 months since I've been there, I may have actually grown too old for the place. My bad....",UNK
14195,"It's ok. The beer prices are decent and it's cool that you can bet on horses. My biggest complaint was that the men's bathroom was filthy and disgusting, even for a sports bar!",UNK
14196,as another reviewer notes this is a rebranded goodwill store with a little more consistency as it relates to quality of merchandise...worth a stop but will be hit or miss like all thrift stores.,UNK
14197,Have not been here in such a long time. Went there got such great ice cream. But the service there was horrid. The all seam to hate working there...,UNK
14198,"This place is dumb. The music SUCKS, the table limits are high, they act like it is a gift to get in while charging you $40 a head, and there is rarely anywhere to sit.  I prefer the main floor of the Palms casino by miles and miles and miles.  Don't do it.",UNK
14199,"TERRIBLE PLACE! Got BBQ for 4th July and the worst I ever had.  Pulled pork was dried out and gross, the ribs undercooked. I ended up sick from it... Don't waist your money. This place is expensive and disgusting.",UNK
14200,"Went late night, got 4 dollar coffee, 8 dollar carrot cake, and other outrageously priced and not very good food.  I wouldn't go back.  2 stars for being open late and for really nice service.",UNK
14201,Horrible food. This food is nowhere close to the North Indian food you get in India. The severs were snobbish and rude. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.,UNK
14202,"Food was great, dinning room is to small and located next very loud bar.  The bar and dinning room are separated by a thin sliding door and there are no views this is a golf course not a strip mall restaurant.",UNK
14203,"You are a Mexican restaurant and you guys are showing the Mexico World Cup Soccer game with no volume ???? ! Freaken total sell outs . You should be called Jimmy's . What a let down . Headed over to another real Mexican bar that is hosting the game , nice and loud to pay respect to our soccer team .",UNK
14204,I love this place and have been coming here ever since they opened but the last few times I've been here they can't seem to get the eggs right.  I'm kinda picky and I don't like any brown on my eggs. I've stopped ordering them. Everything else is great !!!,UNK
14205,"Way overpriced!\nService is OK, but their prices are killing all of the good experiences.\nThe other night forked out $600 for a party of four (no alcohol).\nUnless you got $$$ to burn, go somewhere else.",UNK
14206,"1980's decor meets Hometown Buffet. If you are doing the obligatory Buffet, choose another. The crab legs were okay, nothing special. The rest of the food was also okay too. $51.25 for two people with no comps. Cocktails are expensive!!!",UNK
14207,This is the 1st Fresh and Easy that I've been to since I've moved so can't compare to others but I was sorely disappointed that they didn't carry the yummy french bread that they bake right in the bakery.  That's all I came for and it wasn't there :(.,UNK
14208,All you can eat Brazilian barbecue.  The food is pretty good.  My only complaint is that there is not a huge selection so eating the same cut over and over becomes boring.,UNK
14209,"If they spent as much attention to their food as their atmosphere this place would be good, but it's not. They might have just served us MREs now that I think about it...",UNK
14210,Worst place ever to watch a game. Audio up audio down audio up audio down the entire game. Who ever complains the loudest gets their way with game sound. Until the next person complains. Food average.,UNK
14211,"Just checked into a 16th floor, upgrade strip view room.... hallway to room is dirty and littered with trash and strip view is less than spectacular.  Not impressed, would go back to MGM",UNK
14212,I've had pizza at Ray's Pizza in NYC and this pizza does not come close. It was all soggy. The staff was really nice. I might come back and try some of the other things on the menu.,UNK
14213,"Not sure what all the hype is here, I've been a couple times, the sandwiches werent that special, they were quite small, and just seemed mediocre. Pho was mediocre too, solid place, but definitely been to better. \n\nIf you do come here, I definitely would get the sandwiches",UNK
14214,"Nice dessert, love the ham, seafood area is disappointing, about 15 mins to start your food including line up to pay, get to seat, not bad for Tuesday lunch.",UNK
14215,"Good prices here, but better if you have a discount coupon. I kind of wish they give you additional access to the salad bar portion after you have been through the line and paid, because I kept wanting to go back for the fresh veggies and only ate a little soup and pasta.",UNK
14216,Bad service. Food is uninspired. Not a fan. They brought my dinner out first with our appetizer. My dates dinner was brought out 30 minutes later. No explanation as to why. Teenage employees who don't care about customer service basically run this place.,UNK
14217,"This is a very nice and clean gas station. They have a large convenient store, car wash, and air and water station. But they are pretty over priced. I paid 20 cents more per gallon to fill up here compared to my normal Frys gas station in Phoenix. I guess it comes with the location.",UNK
14218,"I don't have much to say because I really just popped in here from the casino floor for a glass of wine...which cost $13. Ugh. If you want the swank atmosphere, I suppose it's ok, but if you want cheaper drinks you can find them elsewhere.",UNK
14219,"The food was sub par. Kind of greasy for Thai which is generally clean, fresh and balanced. The flavor was on the bland side and the price was a bit higher than other places of a similar style. It wasn't awful but I left without the feeling of needing to return again.",UNK
14220,They dropped United Concordia and failed to inform patients. Now I owe $85 for a routine cleaning without X-rays. I cannot recommend. Make sure they take your provider before getting service done.,UNK
14221,"Houston's, you're a national chain.  Please tell your staff at this location that you are not a three star Michelin restaurant.",UNK
14222,Yuk.  No casino.  No view.  Small open shared pool. \n\nWhy would you want to go to Las Vegas and stay at a hotel like this?  \n\nLuckily the staff was nice enough to not charge us for bailing.,UNK
14223,This location seems to close earlier than the sign says on the front door on Sundays. It says 1 am but by 1230am its closed up. Why???,UNK
14224,I really liked the massaman curry here but then the food poisoning.... errrr not so much.\n\nGreat service though!,UNK
14225,great place for some sushi. food overall is good but pricey. make reservations bc the wait will be long. dinner time the service can be slow and you might have to wait for your food for a bit.,UNK
14226,"Another loyal customer lost!  Unless you want to throw your money away on over priced unnecessary \""recommended\"" repairs RUN AWAY!  Charged me nearly $100 more than GoodYear quoted.",UNK
14227,$10 cover nude side and top less side did not deliver.  Drinks over priced dancers not shapely protruding guts and don't know how to use the pole :(,UNK
14228,"Small menu, hard to avoid dairy.  Next time I'll make it on a Wednesday so I can try the Brunswick stew.  The hot bar at Harper's To Go next door reminds me of Mac Kelly's in Chicago so I'm looking forward to going back there for a quick lunch.",UNK
14229,"Delivery is super fast. If you think you can jump in the shower after you call in your order, you'll end up answering your door in a towel.",UNK
14230,They gave me the wrong order! The smoothie tastes too sweet..the pasta  salad has too much mayo. This wrap is tasteless and taste like everything was canned.,UNK
14231,"It's on the Royal Mile so expect quite a few tourists, especially during the peak season.\n\nOk range of beer, with good food, you should see the size of the Shepard's pie, huge ;-)\n\ngood place for a quick pint",UNK
14232,"After \""Love\"" I wasn't expecting much.  Nonetheless, the show was enjoyable.  Not a lot of \""Cirque\"" to it however.  The fact that we got our tix fairly cheap has colored my impression of the show: if I would have paid the full price, I would have been pissed.",UNK
14233,"It's basically $5 for a slider.  I had a bacon cheeseburger, and the short rib.  Both were average if not forgettable.  Beers are $5, so there's really no reason to ever go back.  I would much rather go get a burger for $10 that comes with fries anywhere else.",UNK
14234,I am currently sitting in this chair after  waiting for 45 minutes. Nothing done to speed things up. Everyone seems to love socializing and not actually getting people in and out with their lives. Probably worst eye doctor visit ever and it hasnt even technically started. Avoid this place unless you enjoy waiting and waiting and waiting.,UNK
14235,"Dirty rooms, old dirty hotel.  Pool was ok.  Shitty elevators, just a cheap all around hotel.  The low price per night and great location give it 2 stars instead of zero.",UNK
14236,"As I begin to write my review I realize the server I am about to disparage is gossiping with the hostess behind me discussing her discontent with her most recent tip. This is NO Houston's! What happened to ensuring a well manicured table, timely service, and a full glass of wine. Boo.",UNK
14237,"A little wait, a little slow, a little greasy, was just OK. Tough to do lunch here and get back to work on time.",UNK
14238,Price were decent especially on a busy weekend when I went. The room were nice and clean. The only problem I had was room service. It took them over two hours to get to get clean towels.. Imagine if I had a hot rendezvous in another hotel and I couldn't dry myself..,UNK
14239,Normally I like this place but I was just there a few days ago and the service was horrible. Waited a hour to get the food. I heard it's under new management. So if that's true then this is how they will run things. Not going back..,UNK
14240,"I was here Thursday night and the place was boring and dance floor empty.  The decor and atmosphere is terrible. The DJ is terrible, I think he is playing for himself. No one is into his tunes.  This joint is over hyped and boring!",UNK
14241,Just called for reservations was told to call back they were busy. Wow really that's how you treat customers? Thank goodness there are soo many other great options -restaurants who understand what good customer service is,UNK
14242,"I don't know why people say this place has good service. The food always takes ages to come, e.g. waiting upwards of an hour for a lunchtime salad and soup. The last time I was there I had a salad adorned with recently thawed pre-shredded cheese. Um, no thanks.",UNK
14243,"The food is delicious as it should be at this price point and the chocolate soufle was hands down the best I have ever ever ever tasted! The atmosphere is \""diner\"" and the attitude of the service staff is deplorable, sorry but they are a bit rude. I would still come back, however...maybe",UNK
14244,"Neat building, average bar but the the dinner menu was extremely weak and then what was delivered was nearly inedible. Note: someone send the pizza was ok, i didn't try \n\n If you are able to get service be prepared for it to be bad.",UNK
14245,"The food wasn't too bad, but it wasn't anything astounding either- particularly for the price you pay. I'd give it four stars if the prices were cheaper. \nCornbread is pretty great though!",UNK
14246,"Yes, this place is just OK. Unique ambiance depends on if you like to share a table with strangers. I can't believe they had no horseradish for their sandwiches. Quality is what you would expect of a deli that was not in New York city.",UNK
14247,"They advertise some great specials but the food quality is average at best. Service was okay, not great. If staying at the SunCoast, I recommend eating at the Bagel Deli instead and avoid TGI Fridays at all cost.",UNK
14248,Overpriced very average Chinese food in lovely elegant surroundings.  My favorite thing about the meal was the beautiful china.  Service was lovely.  Guys must wear a collared shirt.,UNK
14249,"Needless to say, this hotel is one of the older buildings on the block. If you have stayed anywhere else on the Strip, STAY THERE. The only props I gave was the poolside band, King B. They are off the chain. But that may be the alcohol talking.",UNK
14250,Just. No. \n\nThey rushed all of our mani/pedis. Looked like I could have done them. Not worth it. At all.,UNK
14251,"As my husband so accurately put it while we shared a drink on the crappy patio, \""I've seen better ambience in a Chuck E. Cheese.\""",UNK
14252,The food is pretty good but not outstanding. Nice atmosphere. Outdoor seating. I had a great strawberry margarita and their fideo soup is very yummy.,UNK
14253,"Location is perfect view to the lake but services pretty slow, food average a place to get a beer and see the lake ......",UNK
14254,I just don't get it.........but I respect those who do. French fries and cole slaw don't belong two thick pieces of bread with 8 pounds of meat. Count me out.,UNK
14255,If I could give them a Zero star I would. I bought a facial as a gift and they never answered their phone AND never returned phone calls. Then the message box was full so you couldn't get a hold of anyone!!! Worst company!!,UNK
14256,The hotel is beautiful. The restaurants are great. Love Grand Lux. The shopping is alright. The gondolas are fun (the first time). The only negative is everything cost a lot extra. $50 to work out...rip off.,UNK
14257,Pretty gross breakfast. The only reason they are getting any stars is because the waitress was nice enough to take some of the food off the bill when she asked how I liked it and I answered honestly,UNK
14258,"hannah's is closed...its been closed a few years now...too bad, they had the best garlic noodles  :(",UNK
14259,"Conveniently located near good food and a Starbucks. This in my world is a \""trifecta of awesomeness.\""",UNK
14260,One lady was great.  My friend was going to just ask for a pen and all the lady did was cut us off and day she couldn't help.  I agree with everyone.   Worse service.  Even worse them the California dmv.,UNK
14261,BEST PRIME RIB..  but the side dishes lack.  You wont leave hungry however.  The biscuits with honey are the bomb!!!    Other great items are the Ribeye steak and of course the chicken fried steak.......,UNK
14262,"Overpriced food and drinks. Crowded, terrible music and overall a turn off for locals. Last time I was there they took my industry card (for 50% off) and replaced it with a new one with only 25% off and raised their prices. Over it and won't be back.",UNK
14263,There really isn't that much on the menu and where was on themenu wasn't worth it and This place has horrible service and it wasn't even that busy. I wouldn't eat there again!,UNK
14264,Poor customer service - I was at the register to pay & the guy is standing there having a conversation with someone about moving - completely ignored me so I left. Not sure I'll be returning even tho they did have a nice selection of costumes.,UNK
14265,"Not exactly an upscale mall by a long shot.  Service is horrendous and it is crowded and messy, with a poor selection of low grade stores.",UNK
14266,"Disgusting Food !!!  Slow service !!! Waste of money.. I'm not coming back. All three dishes were bad, we left it almost untouched except French fries which was ok",UNK
14267,"Guns Etc have a pretty good selection and above average customer service, they just don't have the greatest retail prices. I enjoy coming here to shop around but most times make a final purchase elsewhere, I do use Guns Etc for all of my gunsmithing needs however, superior work and more than fair pricing.",UNK
14268,should get more stars for the taste alone but the price and the portion size kills it for me. dozen of us walked in for dinner and none of us left satisfied.,UNK
14269,"Being an OC native, home of Del Taco, I've been hooked on it for a long time.  Love their fries more than all other places with the exception of In-n-out.  Value can't be beat. This location is clean with friendly service.",UNK
14270,"Ate there tonight. Took quite awhile to be waited on. Manicotti was good, fish was overcooked but okay. Only complaint was the service. Asked four times for water and never got it.",UNK
14271,The manager is really rude! They deliver for a minimum of $10 and my order was $9.60 and they wouldn't do it! And I'm only 5 mins from them! We order everyday and now we are boycotting this establishment because they had a rude manager! Fire him and you'll get my business back.,UNK
14272,This one facing Walmart is the worst Subway location as far as customer service.\nThe one inside Walmart is much better than this.,UNK
14273,"Surroundings were dirty, took forever for our waiter to arrive and get our drinks.  We would have been understanding if it were busy, but it was mostly empty. \nWalked out and went next door to Island's burgers. Way better!",UNK
14274,"Not a bad place to get lunch. The only thing good here is the chicken joy with gravy. The new 99 cent corned beef sandwiches are gross, the tasty burgers has too much lady's choice or mayo. If you had to choose, go right next door to chow king.",UNK
14275,Shitty drive thru service!! Asked for a Chicken quesadilla and got a burnt quesadilla with onions in it!! Employees need more training.,UNK
14276,"They should call it Modern Bun because there is 6x more bun than burger.  Remember the commercial \""where's the beef?\""   This definitely applies here.",UNK
14277,"Management, listen up.  You're quickly losing good will and patience.  Your front desk staff enjoy WAY too much expressing the wait time.  Not possible it's two hours.  Table went out of business for a reason.  Jade was excellent.",UNK
14278,"A good steakhouse but definitely not worth the price. The steaks were good but the portions on the sides and appetizers were dismal. The apps were also over salted, over fried and underwhelming.",UNK
14279,The service was absolutely terrible. The chicken wings didn't even look like real chicken it was purple. The workers were rude and the manager looked like he was drugged. Multiple people got there food before us. Never going there again,UNK
14280,I went there for Brunch time. The food was okay. There was different varietys to pick from. I have to admit that the dessert section looked the best! Make sure you save room for dessert.,UNK
14281,"Decent crowd fun atmosphere,  Didn't get to try the food?  Watch out for adding gratuity on bill.  we had a four top of all drinks and got autograted???  ROOKIE move server would of got a bigger tip than the auto grat.  Oh Well her loss",UNK
14282,We have lunch and dinner there and we have enjoyed it almost every time.  We have had two instances where we were truly unhappy with the food.  Once they forgot about us and we left with to go boxes of cold food.  The service has always been given with happy faces and good atitudes.  Over all it's a good place to eat!!,UNK
14283,They close at 10pm.   We got there at 9:15 and the host refuses to seat and serve us.  Will never go back there and give them anymore business.,UNK
14284,Just purchase coupon called them to confirm  they said you need 24 hours notice we only in town for tonight it dose not say any thing about that on the voucher and I thing all the review are fake  on this place,UNK
14285,I was very happy with my calamari taco. It had just the right amount of flavor and it was a nice break from more traditional seafood or Mexican. I'd probably go back next time I'm in Charlotte.,UNK
14286,"This place has wonderful Pho, pork b\u00fan, and Vietnamese egg rolls. Those are essentially the only things I absolutely love there. It's also open 24 hours which is great when I'm digging Vietnamese late at night. I would give them 4 stars, but the service is either a hit or miss.",UNK
14287,"If you like mindless, generic music, then this is the place for you.  The dance floors are on the small side, and seating is inadequate.  Have been a few times [always being dragged after the first time].  Crowded with pretentiousness up the wazoo.",UNK
14288,"Lovely hotel. Amazingly helpful staff. The noise level from the street is extremely high. Beware. Otherwise this is a perfect location. Great for young travelers, not good for older folks or someone who needs their rest.",UNK
14289,decided to give this place a try since of all the reviews.  \n\nNice staff.\n\n But i just found this place just to be on a salty side. There is definitely some interesting combinations but nothing that I would re order again or come back for.,UNK
14290,"this place is pretty nice but expensive for italian food.  after dinner, this place becomes a bar/club, and it's pretty hopping (but VERY cheesy).",UNK
14291,"Meh,\nThey used to be better. Now the prices gone up slightly and the quality lessened. Even in their heyday they were only \""As good as it gets in Vegas\"" but that's coming from someone who grew up on good Italian American Cuisine.",UNK
14292,I've never actually been scared staying in a hotel until I stayed here.  Druggies hanging out in the parking lot on a week night!  Cheap hotel but I don't recommend staying here if you want to feel safe.,UNK
14293,"Four words - expensive, old people food.  \n\nI wish this place was good because of its very convenient location.  Its just not my kind of food.",UNK
14294,Oml this food tastes like crap!!!The waitress is so damn slow!!They should get someone faster!It is also in a really bad area!!The food is disgusting.Dont recommend it,UNK
14295,"It's always hit or miss if the person helping you is knowledgeable about the product. I for one would stick with Amazon, as you're getting the same product far cheaper. Also, I'd avoid their product protection program, cause they'll replace your item with something of much lesser value.",UNK
14296,"Cheap breakfast that is mediocre.  The service is mediocre.  The bathroom is stinky, I had to hold my breathe.",UNK
14297,"Really enjoyed the food, but i didnt get full and it was kinda pricey.. It's a fun enviornment with lots off friendly people. Will go again but just not even im really hungry",UNK
14298,I walk in and saw a lot of lil bugs running around the floor sorry but i turned around and walk back out....fuck all that ....,UNK
14299,"3 stars for the outside appearance of Caesars. It's huge as hell! I like the Forum Shops here. I've never stayed here before: Way too pricey for my taste, but at least it's nice to look at for free! LOL",UNK
14300,"Worst experience at a restaurant ever. I will definitely never ever come back. My food was cold, my drink had no ice, and everyone there had a terrible attitude to me. Sorry all I wanted was ice in my drink considering I didn't ask for no ice. It's July I would like ice in my drink!",UNK
14301,The food was very good and the service was good too.  The only reason I only went there once is because I am a poor college student and the prices are a bit expensive.  The food is very similar to Bombay Grill (I've heard it's the same owners) but the prices were a little high for me.,UNK
14302,"This isn't one of the better Half Price Books I've found. It's too new, I guess, and hasn't managed to buy as many interesting books from customers (for a pittance, as usual). Convenient location, though.",UNK
14303,"The crowd in this one is mostly Japanese--which is the first good sign. So are the staff and the ever-important sushi master. Not cheap, but genuine Japanese food experience.\n\nThe place is big but quite dark though. Not a single window.",UNK
14304,"The service was slow that our waiter celebrated his 91st bday and got promoted all in the time we had our mediocre burger. I deserve it though, I was too lazy to eat anywhere else.",UNK
14305,"Quirky and small boutique in central Phoenix.  I think I would have liked it better had I not felt so incredibly cramped.  Still a cute little shop that I might pop back into, I just have a hard time getting past the claustrophobia of shopping in it.",UNK
14306,we ordered garlic bread & veg pizza...veg pizza is ok.. bread was dry...cheese and veggies are perfect..garlic bread was burnt on the edges... difficult to eat...overly seasoned... over all its just ok..,UNK

14309,"What happened to this place ??? The last time I came here 2 years ago, I was in love, but now this place has gone downhill. It's horrible the food is gross. It makes the Japanese buffets look like 7 stars. Avoid at all costs. Don't believe me just ask to walk and look.",UNK
14310,"Brickhouse has been on my list to try for several months and after finally getting the opportunity it was not hit.  The sides, mac-n-cheese and greens, were better than the meat.  The ham was dry and ribs tasted like they have been warmed over for the past couple of days. Was definitely hoping for better.",UNK
14311,You comped us 2 dinners out of 6.  You forgot 2 drinks out 6.  Your busboys were very good but your waiter was in the weeds. Wanted it to be better.,UNK
14312,"Their food is alright, but it's a good atmosphere and they have great happy hour deals. They often have live music which is always fun!",UNK
14313,SERVICE HORRIBLE!!!\nHostess could care less and server at bar was too busy flirting with some girl to pay us any mind!\nFood way overpriced and not that good!\n  What a huge let down!!,UNK
14314,"I had higher expectations for this buffet.  I will say that it was just OK.  The crepes for breakfast were pretty good, and they did OK for dinner.  But it's not the best in Vegas.  Some dishes were hit or miss.",UNK
14315,"This is a typical Chinese buffet with Sunday crab, clams, shrimp, fish.  There are sushi options like tamago, eel. This is typical of large pans pre made food. Service was so bad that we had to repeatedly ask for water, clearing our plates, and refills.",UNK
14316,horrible people\npoor customer service.\nangry that you have interrupted their day.  can't say enough bad things about this place.,UNK
14317,The place used to be awesome. Last night we ate there and service was off. The food was definitely below par. Really bummed to have to call out this place. Hopefully they work things out. I will not be going back but I will check the reviews in a few months.,UNK
14318,"Mediocre, overpriced, uncreative. Nothing on the menu that you wouldn't find in an Olive Garden, and it's not particularly well-executed.\n\nGets two stars instead of one because of the helpful service.",UNK
14319,Have you thought of downtown Chandler lately? It's got a lot of personality and great Mexican food. Their patio is great. Be prepared to wait on a weekend night.\n\nI like the tacos and the house margarita. Music can be a bit loud.,UNK
14320,I usually get gasoline here. Not a very well kept location. Rebel needs to invest into cleaning up their locations. The credit receptacles don't always work at the pumps.,UNK
14321,"It just isn't as good as it used to be. Even using a coupon, the quality of the beef and bun were just sub-par. I won't be wanting to go again for a long time, if ever.",UNK
14322,Gr8 omelettes and other breakfast items.  Pancakes and waffles are good.   Lunch is less impressive.   Bread seems smothered in butter so ask for dry.  Service is efficient and friendly.  Gr8 coffee.  Good specials.,UNK
14323,"I was not all that impressed with dinner.  For me it's a more enjoyable spot for happy hour, drinks & a few appetizers.  The White Peach & Hibiscus margarita is absolutely delicious.  Go during happy hour, get 50% off, then you won't feel like it was such a waste/rip-off!",UNK
14324,"Literally walked out after waiting 15 mins for a waiter/ess and we got nada! The bartenders kept looking over at my bf and I, yet no one came to our table. Thumbs down BWW... 3 bartenders and the manager and still no service.",UNK
14325,"Horrible service.  They try to nickel and dime you.    Chicken portions are extremely meager.  When I asked for a normal size portion of chicken, they tried to add an additional $2.   The staff is extremely rude.  Don't ever come here.",UNK
14326,This location is terrible. Save yourself a headache and go a mile down the road to the UPS store on 44th and Oak. I bought a box to ship my laptop in and they said I had to go put it together in the parking lot even though I bought it and was shipping it at their store.,UNK
14327,"This store has some pretty funny sayings on shirts and other items like key chains and bumper stickers. If you don't have any gift ideas, you should definitely come here for some humorous items.",UNK
14328,"Watch your drink! We loved going in to have a cold one every time we are in Ole Town, one of our party experienced being hit by a drug. It could have been really bad, had we were not a large group and was able to care for our friend!",UNK
14329,"Very old place and you can't even get a drink at a decent price, we paid $8 a Stella Artois...On Tap! BS! Don't bother going.",UNK
14330,This place is a shit hole! Food was not good and there was hair in it! Nasty! And to top it all off the people working were very rude! Would not recommend it unless you had zero taste buds and could not hear or see....,UNK
14331,Not sure what kind of sheesh they use but it tasted like ash. After the owner yelled at me for having my feet on the table he changed the hookah. It still tasted like a cigarette. If you're looking for a good hookah lounge go to white cloud.  Also I wanted a coffee and they're machine was broken.,UNK
14332,Filet with wild mushroom sauce was VERY petite (3-4oz) and overcooked. Told server but no offer to correct.  Otherwise food and service pretty good. But we are leaving a tad disappointed.,UNK
14333,"This place is awful. Our take out order took over an hour and a half. When we finally received it, the toppings were wrong on our pizza and they messed up our salad order.",UNK
14334,"Way overpriced. I paid just about $21 for a burger basket, an order of cheese curds, bottled water, and two custard cones. Not even worth the price!!!!Culvers would have been a better option. the food was ok, but I suppose the custard was good.",UNK
14335,I had such a bad experience with the Ahi Tuna burger. I wish I could say I want to go back and try something else but I don't!,UNK
14336,"Tex Tubbs is in my neighborhood but I don't go to it much. The food is more Americanized, especially the salsa, so if this sounds like your kind of thing, the service is always delightful (but not enough to go back very often).",UNK
14337,"Tried this place for the first time today. Gyros are good, Greek fries are okay. Place was real messy when I came in, dirty tables with food plates still on them. They have free homemade soup, which there was none left when I looked to get some. Reasonably priced.",UNK
14338,"So disappointed - this use to be my favorite place to lunch in the Valley.  Went today and the food was mediocre, the server was curt and inattentive - not the standard I expect for the price.  Think it is time to move on....",UNK
14339,Really disappointed with their selection this year and the only really cute styles they had were in size 5 in women's pretty much a waste of time unless you're getting the standard solid colors,UNK
14340,"If you like paying a million dollars for gelato, this place is for you!  Looks pretty in the case but the sticker shock is not worth it.",UNK
14341,Ok.  So.  We played slots for 1.5 hrs.  And never even came close to having a waitress come and ask us for a drink.  Told later by bartenders that call in absenteeism is a habit here,UNK
14342,"48 Dollars and a 20 minute wait should equal the best buffet you'd ever imagine.   But I found it par-for-the-course.   \n\nLots of options, but the food was average. \n\nIt turns out the premier Vegas buffet is more hype than substance.",UNK
14343,Great to grab a drink before your flight and watch sports on the many tv's. Don't order food or you will be sorely disappointed,UNK
14344,Nice location but none of the 4 people behind the counter talked to me until I was told the total of my order.  So not much more to report.  I took my coffee and snack and left!,UNK
14345,"It's Cracker Barrel. I haven't eaten there for years, at least 8 or more.\nWe ordered take out last week.\nHusband said to give excellent feedback based on the manager fixing a problem with our order.\n4 stars for  the manager\n-1star for the chicken fried steak",UNK
14346,The portions are WAY too small and really pricey. Our grilled chicken under-seasoned and the service was really slow. Don't understand why it's for stars. Maybe because of the neighbourhood but not worth them for sure. Ganadara in guy concordia is better and cheaper.,UNK
14347,"Decent coffee, okay atmosphere, good juice.  The place is a little crowded - a few too many tables (many of which are wobbly).  Three stars.  Minus one star for not taking credit cards.  Hello, 1995.",UNK
14348,"Not the best, not horrible. Waitress not being able to make a recommendation or knowing what anything is, pretty lame. This place is very overrated.",UNK
14349,Good employees but the management is terrible! I went in a few months ago and the manager was nowhere to be found.. The girl that did my lashes took forever but they came out okay. All in all its a cute little place but would definitely not return,UNK
14350,This is THE worst excuse for a Chinese buffet I have ever seen. Zero flavor to any of the dishes. Can't believe they are as busy as they where.,UNK
14351,We have been here about 5 times since they opened and every time we come in something changes at first they had happy hour food now they dont because thr the kitchen can't keep up. Sad thing is their food isn't bad. They need to get their act together or they won't last just like every other place in this location,UNK
14352,Came here on a Saturday night. Supposed to be live music at 9pm an hr later still no live music. The food is mediocre at best. By pass this place and go to boardwalk Billie's around the corner. Much better bang for your buck.,UNK
14353,"The PT's bar here is great! The staff is really fun and the vibe is very relaxed! But there are better, and need to work better on sanitation! Good thing is there great locations and ope 24/7",UNK
14354,I've lived in AZ for 26 years and never been here before. Wasn't outstanding but ok. Got the bittersweet chocolate sundae with one scoop of mint chocolate chip ice cream. Didn't taste bittersweet. Better places to go than this place. Like Sweet Republic.,UNK
14355,"This will be short since we didn't get to see it all - we couldn't stay longer.\nAvoid this show - terrible, borring, I totally wasted my money.\n\nI guess you either have to be going through that or have gone through that to get it...",UNK
14356,"Don't go there! Noisy and rude waiters. Never got to eat. After waiting nearly an hour after being told a 20 min. wait, we left. Hostess was especially rude and told us we would need to wait another 20 min.",UNK
14357,If I could give a no star I would. Worse place ever the service is awful. They have no idea what they do and the times they open or close. Food burned and once again service is worse than go to mcdonalds  no wroth the stop ever.,UNK
14358,"Three stars would've been a 5 had I not witnessed a few of the lifeguards not being so nice to kids. I get that it's hot and crowded but if you don't like kids go work at a retirement community pool. Other than that, the facility itself is great. Can't beat $1 admission!",UNK
14359,"Well, the rolls here are pretty special. The \""Jimmy the Attorney\"" and the OMG roll are fantastic as is the price, $18.95 all you can eat. The carpet was in need of a vacuuming and some of the \""food safe\"" practices were questionable. I will try it again in a few weeks.",UNK
14360,Definitely not coming back ever. Though the sushi was good but you can find much better places around town for cheaper. Their servers are pretty bad and not attentive enough.,UNK
14361,"The eel and yellow tail pieces were brownish and the rice fell apart. The sushi here is consistently poor quality (I've been 5-6 times living nearby) I don't understand why it got \""super fresh\"" label, maybe we just showed up on the \""wrong\"" days?",UNK
14362,"Update....took friends there to get cupcakes for champagne in our suite @ Palazzo. So embarrassed! After telling our friend how scrumptious they are, the cupcakes were so dry we couldn't eat them. Threw them out. So disappointed.",UNK
14363,This is a great place to see a movie. But try getting your soda and popcorn in a timely manner. forget it! One person selling tickets. Two people taking tickets. One person at concession. With a line of 8 to 10 people! Manager must be sleeping in the back. Get your act together!,UNK
14364,"Gosh, we love this place but not at this location. Slow service and terrible food. We nearly missed our flight to bring breakfast on board. The burrito was filled primarily with potatoes. I don't mind spending money at the airport for a good drink and grub, but our $60 dollar tab was a huge disappointment.",UNK
14365,"I came here on a Friday night and remember being terribly bored.  \n\nA big part of the allure of Vegas clubbing for me is the venue, and the venue here is mediocre at best.",UNK
14366,"Disappointing to say the least... Good service but the food was terrible!  We would not return here there are many better places nearby,,,,,,,,",UNK
14367,The food was terrible slow timing.Bad waitress also. This was the exact timing [2:43 coming time 4:57 leaving  time .,UNK
14368,We went on a Friday night and the place was empty. I ordered the special for the night Prime Rib. I had a good meal. They have received a lot of bad reviews but I will go back.,UNK
14369,"Nice spot a bit pricey. \nBut had a Vodka with some gunk on the glass, sent it back and mGT was not happy with bartenders. Problem fixed quickly. Not a bad place to have a drink and a meal all n all.",UNK
14370,"Usually really good but today food was horrible.  I order carne asada nachos,  chips were full of oil, beans and carne asada tasted dry/old, hardly had a guacamole and sour cream and cheese didn't melt. Salsa was watered down had no flavor very disappointing.",UNK
14371,There isn't much of a dress code to get into this place.  It's awkward to go into a club to see middle aged women wearing jean skirts and flip flops.  We lasted one drink and bounced.,UNK
14372,"This place was gross. The pizza was bland and had no flavor, the salads were the same, but drenched in dressing and soggy. The tables had residue on them, and I didn't want to eat on them. I definitely won't be going back.",UNK
14373,"My girlfriend and I are Pad Thai enthusiasts - this place didn't measure up. I can't speak for the rest of the menu, but what we received was bland and tasteless. The drive-thru pickup window was awfully convenient, though.",UNK
14374,"Absolutely worst car wash! Had my truck for 5 hours after a $200 detail and it looks like a cheap wash..step boards and tires still filthy, mirrors and windows dirty, cup holders in back seat still full of gunk. Will not return and should of checked yelp reviews before I went!",UNK
14375,Everything here is just average.  The service sucked and the place was only half full.  The food is just average as well.  \n\nGood beer selection though.,UNK
14376,"Came for the famed Outlaw Burger. Hoped that it would remind me of some burgers from restaurants I grew up with which are now long lost. It didn't.\n\nFood was OK. Service was quite nice. In the end, probably won't be back.",UNK
14377,i would have loved to give more stars but i am not completely convinced. the oysters are tasty but small. i love the fried green tomatoes. my husband usually gets the fish and says its okay.,UNK
14378,So every other Jiffy Smog charges $19.99 for a smog check except this one.  $26.99.  They only do this because this is their busiest stop. Lots of other locations to choose from!,UNK
14379,"Nice place! Located in MGM, this is a nice place to grab a drink and lounge on a comfortable sofa. This is nice to relax from the craziness on the strip. There are a few table games inside this bar area that have table minimums of $200/hand. Did i mention the drinks selection is good!",UNK
14380,Last year we ate here.  It was quite good that we came back this year.  Total bust this time.  The thit nng and sn nng tasted like rubber. Ch\u00e8 ba m\u00e0u had burned beans.  Others in my party were disappointed with their food too.,UNK
14381,This place is nothing to write home about. It is about as good as Denny's. \nFries are not so great. Burger was ok.,UNK
14382,Burger Bar offers a good burger and good beer.  It is cheap by Las Vegas dining standards but still a darn expensive burger anywhere else in the free world. (Average burger price around $13),UNK
14383,Tastes like Mexican food made by Canadians. It was so far from anything that I think of as Mexican food. I won't be back.,UNK
14384,"The food here is mediocre and overpriced.  I have been here twice and both times the I was not impressed.  On my last visit the food that came out was incomplete (missing sides, not as described on the menu, etc)  The service was slow and the food was just not that great.  I will not be returning here.",UNK
14385,"Called in for a simple question about if they had a specific jersey or not, and once was hung up on after being on hold, then the girl was completely rude and short when I called back. Learn some customer service.",UNK
14386,Did not get to eat there.  Walked in at 9:05 pm.  Was told they were closing 30 minutes and only take out could be ordered.  They close at 10pm.  I was told that service wasn't good.  I agree.  Lousy and lazy.  A disappointment in true Bellevue fashion.,UNK
14387,"The only substitute for Korean food on the strip.  The other Ginseng farther down is not much better and just as expensive.  If you can get off the strip, go down Spring Mountain Rd for better Asian food.",UNK
14388,"This place is alright. Kitschy name, fine food. Nothing spectacular at the bar. Nothing amazing on the menu. \n\nThis is a neighborhood bar, there are always regulars in. Not a bad sort, some of them can be quite drunk at times though.",UNK
14389,This place can suck my balls. I was excited to have a neighborhood bar with live music (even if it is country). I went and after 2 beers was kicked out with no explanation. I didn't even pay for my drinks. Weirdos.,UNK
14390,"I emailed nypd, with no response from them. I expect much more from them as I usually recEive good customer service.  Oh well....",UNK

14394,"Ok hotel but resort fees are expensive and taxed. Still have to pay the fees even though pool was closed for the season, no wifi in rooms only a tagged wired cable for a laptop. Intermittent hot water in shower. Only good thing was location and fast elevators.",UNK
14395,Last time they gave me less meat on my sandwich so you're lucky to get 2stars bc I like to eat.. Be NICE to touristy yelpers!  Just go to Toronto Banh Mi Boys for the real good stuff..I'm going there next (very meaty).,UNK
14396,Stains in the carpets. Fixtures falling off the wall and a big green line through the Freaken TV overall this place is a ratchet shithole. No wonder Paris Hilton sold this piece  of shit hotel before everything fell apart on her.,UNK
14397,"Mediocre, forgettable experience. We ordered pineapple fried rice, pad thai and something else I can't recall. One note flavor in all the dishes. I've had better Thai in a mall food court.",UNK
14398,"Quaint studenty kind of place. Good for a quick sort of healthy lunch. Vegetarian. Considering the other quick dining options in the neighbourhood (Subway, Quiznos, McD's, pizza slice joints), it's tough to beat.\n\nExpect to spend $10 on lunch.",UNK
14399,My spousal unit tried to find a cartridge for her CRICUT.  She tried to choose several different ones but they were ALL sold out. \n\nAlso it was very difficult to hunt someone down.  It took about 45 minutes to find someone for assistance.\n\nThe seriously need a better system.,UNK
14400,"Terrible service but great food.  Made us wait 30 minutes for our check and box. Also barely checked on us, and we asked for a refill on our waters but only gave us one extra water. The busser was a better \""waiter\"" than our actual waiter.",UNK
14401,"This is a very average breakfast restaurant. They don't do anything bad, but they don't blow you away either. If I had to complain, I would say that they pack the place a little too tight with the tables.",UNK

14404,Slowest Starbucks in history no matter how many people they have working. The best Starbucks in the area is at the frys at 59th or safeway at 67th. If the kiosks could give the reward drinks I would never have to go to a store again.,UNK

14410,Car wash always has issues with equipment.  Poor suction on the vacuums.  Oil sprayed all over the bottom of my vehicle from the tire polisher which I did not even pay for.  Cleaning equipment seems to always miss parts of the vehicle.,UNK
14411,"The food was just ok,  the beer was overpriced, and the service was sub-par.  I've been there twice and the first time I actually stuck around to eat and drink.  On the second trip, we waited at the table 30 minutes with no service, then finally left.  I will not go back.",UNK
14412,"Bad food, but lots of it.  If you have a hangover and need grease, this is your place.  Other than that, drive a block and eat at Mucho Gusto down the street--now that is real mexican food!",UNK

14414,"Reviewing the Casino only.  If you like a Casino on the strip that is pretty mellow this is it.  However, dealers on the craps table were very rude and looked down-right grumpy.  The craps table itself is actually a medium sized one.  I didn't enjoy the club music playing loudly in the background.",UNK
14415,Pretty cool ride but a little bumpy considering the age. Might be more fun during the day when you can see where you're going...,UNK
14416,"Service was ok. Food was ok. Didn't impress me. Didn't seem fresh. Flavors seemed to be boiled out of it, and then covered with seasoning. I think it would retained the flavor better if it was steamed. Just my opinion.",UNK
14417,"Kind of impersonal as a shopping experience, but I love the selection available. There are always a ton of clearance deals and they send out lots of coupons which helps as well. Just wish it was easier to find someone when needed.",UNK

14419,This place sucks. The food is so expensive and tastes like shit. The gm is a nazi psycho who treats all employees like garbage so obviously theyre not in the best mood when they serve you. i hate them. fridays at home rules way harder than this stupid place,UNK
14420,"Grade: C-\n\nGood food except you have to order it at the \""food counter\"" and bring it to yourself. Very lame concept.",UNK
14421,"You get what you pay for and although the pricing is high for where we come from, it's inline with Vegas strip costs. I had a caesar salad, and sandwich with a blondie beer(Great brew). It was accurate and on time. No arguments here. A good stop to fill the appetite and grab a drink.",UNK
14422,C'est pas cher. C'est bon. C'est des grosses portions. Id\u00e9al en groupe durant soir\u00e9e bien arros\u00e9e. Pas fait pour un couple seul.,UNK
14423,I had the lunch buffet and I was not really blown away. The price is on the low side as far as buffet goes but I was not really that satisfied. The service was good but the food was not memorable. Typical buffet food.,UNK
14424,The WORST customer service I have ever experienced!!!! So far my gf's and I have been here for 30 minutes and no one has bothered to offer us drinks or food. NEVER coming back!!!!!!,UNK

14426,"No offense to Dianne O but if you serve a \""Mac and Cheese\"" pizza, there is nothing NY about it. This is not NY pizza. It is pizza with interesting toppings and unique combinations. Is it good, not really. Its different, and if you have been drinking, it tastes better.",UNK
14427,"ho hum bar with nothing spectacular to give it an edge.  Beer selection is week at best.  Food is so so.  Only reason to go here is the neighborhood,  dont go out of your way.",UNK
14428,"Here for the first time. Outside enjoying the live band, but not enjoying my experience since this venue allows smoking within 20 ft of door. Apparently AZ law's do not apply here at this venue.",UNK
14429,The fish tacos rock here as they're grilled orange roughy. The fact they give you great guac before your meal is fantastic also.,UNK
14430,"This may be a gross generalization, but what kind of joint calls itself Two HIPPIES and serves their food on styrofoam?!",UNK
14431,"Gave this a try for lunch. Like the idea of the fast food mexican but found this a bit bland.\n\nFast service, okay prices. Service could have been a little bit more informative, never asked if we knew about any of their deals.",UNK
14432,"Got here at lunch at first it wasn't that busy, everything was smooth, service was ok at first when they handed our food but when we reach and we had to pay and started getting busy the cashier was so rude.. We definitely not coming back they just ruin our lunch after we experience that.",UNK
14433,Food was great once we got it. Cooks missed up/ skipped our ticket so it took more time to get our food. Server was nice.,UNK
14434,I would tear a hamstring to run as fast as I could from this place. Went there for the first time last night. Food is gross. Service sucks. It's uncomfortable. There really isn't one good thing I can say about it. Run away. You'll thank me.,UNK
14435,"Classy.\n\nThat is sarcasm.  But, it's only restaurant on Lake Wylie. So there.",UNK
14436,"I ordered the classic chili cheese dog, minus bun. I'm a fan of the fried hotdog, however they really need to look into a better cheese to use. I would try one of the other many styles of hotdogs they have. They do also have good fries.",UNK
14437,"Everything about this place is cute:  their store, their cupcakes, even the boxes they put the cupcakes in.\n\nUnfortunately,  the actual taste of their cupcakes are not so great.  All the ones I tried were really dry.  Could have been a bad day, so I might give this place another try.",UNK
14438,I thought this place was just okay. I had the fried chicken and it was not that special. I hear the brunch is good. I might give that a chance someday.,UNK
14439,"I hate to diss an icon, but I thought it was bland. And when I'm inhaling food that will eventually result in death, it'd better be damn good.\n\nFlies buzzing around, kinda gross. The servers were really friendly, though.",UNK
14440,This is the kind of bar that everyone turns around to see who entered. Not comfortable atmosphere unless your from this side of town. Two small tv sets at bar and not much else.  Skiperooni.,UNK
14441,If there was an option for no stars I would choose it. The entire place smells like sewer gas.  The owner was aware of the ongoing smell but apparently didn't really care about it when I spoke to him.,UNK
14442,"Got carry out, better than before. I think I can reinstate this place for carryout. Good (but nothing spectacular) sushi, stick to basics, very reasonable prices, Friendly\nService. It's nice to see a completely Japanese sushi place. I go for carryout mainly because they are on the way home.",UNK

14445,"Ordered a cheese pizza, it was $9 for a 8\"" pizza. Pizza was cold and cheese was hard. It wasn't good at all.",UNK
14446,3 measly chicken fingers on a pile of soggy fries. How do you mess up chicken fingers?! 9 bucks...no thank you.,UNK
14447,"The positives: cute little donuts, location.  \n\nThe negatives:  a bit pricey for tiny donuts, owner announced disdain for gays, feminists, abortion, government-based education, and, well, pretty much everything that cute little peace-loving donuts represent.",UNK
14448,I will never come here again.  This place is so terrible I'm not even going to waste my time writing anymore of a review.,UNK
14449,"They showed up 2 hours late.  One guy went home sick in the middle of the move.  What should have taken them 1.5 hours to load, they spent 4.5 hours.  A lot of our furniture is dinged up.  They showed up in a rented 14 foot Budget truck for a 2 bedroom apartment.  Would not recommend.",UNK
14450,"Fish tacos are good most of the time.  My problem with this place is the crappy attitude of the little manager.  He's just a rude person and has been on several different occasions.  With that said, I've moved on.",UNK
14451,"This mall is a bit confusing to me, so many turns and SOOO LONG! But the design here is very chic and attractive. The stores are never-ending...especially when you are walking with heels...Thankfully there are lots of seats everywhere...BREAK TIME! =)",UNK
14452,Visited during the Urban Wine Walk. Did not care for their wine selections but their snacks/appetizers were tasty.,UNK
14453,"Came here this past Veterans Day weekend.  The woman needed her Asian food fix.  I don't know why she likes coming here especially when she is used to having good Asian cuisine.  Had the duck, a noodle dish, and a waiter recommended crab noodle dish.  Just okay for all of it and I've definitely had better.",UNK
14454,"Drinks are great, good is alright and service is....none of the above. Great location downtown and awesome decorations. Had the ceviche and that was good. Make sure you come with people to share. For sure tapas plates.",UNK
14455,"--Good variety of beers.\n\n--Great location near Arrowhead Mall.\n\n--Plenty of parking.\n\n--Food was decent for chain food.\n\n--Service was a tad slow, but the Server was friendly.",UNK
14456,"Very slow and unresponsive service, at one point the waitress didn't stop by for 20 minutes.   The food took over 45 minutes and was cold when it was served.  $300 meal for 4 people, better to spend your money elsewhere.  Only good point was the key lime pie.",UNK
14457,"Stay away from here if you're on your lunch break, sat and waited 40 damn minutes for our food that  never came and was never started. Terrible service",UNK
14458,"The concept is honestly pretty cool, but it's also completely impractical. For those with children, aloft is simply impossible to work with. The property was clean and the service was good, but the strange rooms with things like a pocket door bathroom providing little to no privacy just make it a place I won't be visiting again.",UNK
14459,"Don't wasted your time here,  we got bottles services and was waiting 2hrs in their reservation line.  Finally left and went to Taos",UNK
14460,"I went for lunch in between classes at ASU, and got the chicken chimichanga at the recommendation of my waiter. The most tasty part of my meal was the free salsa. I smothered my bland chicken chimichanga with it.",UNK
14461,When it first opened it was great! But as of late the quality and quantity of the food is lacking. This evening I had a burrito al pastor and the meat wasn't freshly cooked and barley warm not  mention the girl behind the counter has a sour look on her face.,UNK
14462,"Went for Saturday brunch with 8 others and it was such a disappointment. Paid so much for a buffet which was really dry, flavorless, and fruits either really sour or going bad.",UNK
14463,The staff here were vultures. They kept sending different people after me to try to talk me into something I wasn't asking for and didn't want. I wouldn't even consider going back. People like that need to find different jobs because they are giving dealerships and car brands a bad name.,UNK
14464,"$2 Mexican beers on Sunday night.  Probably a good chance of catching something if you went home with any of the sleazy folks that were packed in the bar and patio.  No idea on food quality, but it looked passable from the few people I saw eating.",UNK
14465,Good food. OK prices. Just hope you never have a problem you want resolved because the management is no help whatsoever. You can't expect much from someone who manages a grocery store though.,UNK
14466,"Just had the worst, greasiest, saltiest calamari ever. I typically like this place and eat here often. I've had their calamari before too. Never has the food been this awful. Must be new kitchen staff. Service from  the friendly bartender was great; which is why I offered the extra star.",UNK
14467,"Paid for the yelp coupon to have someone tell me that I needed a new water softener.  Glad that didn't cost me the normal $80.  The service person was ok.  He was nice but like I said, it wasn't worth the cost.",UNK
14468,"Still not a big fan of their pho or service, but I have to admit there are quite a few dishes that I enjoy here and how can you not give them an extra star for the name alone. \n\nI go here on occasion and I actually quite enjoy it.",UNK
14469,Food was ok.  Prices are decent for a place on the strip at New York New York.  It was cool to sit in the patio area in the streets of NYC.,UNK
14470,This is an absolute a stinker. Dont bother to visit..the food is bad - especially dosas and idlies..made from stale Gitz mixes?! Stinky place overall. Does not deserve to be patronized to stay in business.,UNK
14471,Very busy and hard to find a seat. Maybe it's because Saturday morning. The food took much longer than usual. It's OK for quick breakfast. Food was still good tho.,UNK
14472,"I have been here a number of times, going back to when it was a Old Chicago's.  On our latest trip I couldn't help but notice a really foul musty moldy aroma that really turned me off.  The food was good as was the beer, just got the feeling that the clenliness may be going downhill.",UNK
14473,"This Albertsons is pretty average, but one of the better options in the area.  Reasonable service in general, but the checker was nice.  For everyday groceries, the prices are good.",UNK
14474,"Gross! We found some weird pellet thing on the Kung pao chicken! It resembled mice or rat poop, totally turned us off and we never will go back again!",UNK
14475,"Wether the customer is a high roller VIP spending almost 1k on dinner alone (which we were) or just an average Joe, you can NEVER EVER ask him to leave because you need the table for your next party. Bad form.",UNK
14476,"I had the Fish Curry and it was tasty. The onion bhaji was different than I\""m used to having. No buffet on weekday evenings.\n\nThe staff was friendly. \n\nWish they had more kabob choices. Did enjoy the Bollywood music videos.",UNK
14477,"I think The D sucks. Fitzgeralds was more comfortable.The staff was great and friendly,the waitresses came around a lot more.there were more places to make change and cash in your tickets.I miss the Blarney Stone.I was there in April.Atmosphere was cold.",UNK
14478,"At $50/night, a very good value. Nice little pool area. \n\nDecent rooms, private parking. Bathrooms are quite small. \n\nWalking distance to food and Papago Brewery. Easy access to Scottsdale Road.\n\nNot luxurious by any means, but worth the price.",UNK
14479,It's a KFC. It does whatever any other KFC can do. All I can say about this one is be careful going here on a Friday night because people are buying food for their families and sometimes the line gets long and it might be a 20 minute wait to get your  bucket of chicken.,UNK
14480,Nice little breakfast and lunch neighborhood spot with friendly service.  We enjoyed the Monte Cristo with sweet potato tater tots and a chicken salad.,UNK
14481,"Attended a seminar here. The rooms were spacious, and catering for breakfast/snacks and lunch was good. The parking lot here is fairly large, so finding a space isn't too much of a problem.",UNK
14482,"the atmosphere is really nice, the music's good, and the service does fairly well.\n\nit's too bad the food doesn't taste better. there's actually none of it that is really poor, but there's none of it that's very good either.",UNK
14483,"Good service , but warning if you plan on going thru the drive thur you might be in line for 20 mins plus...",UNK
14484,"Stopped by during a weeknight, late at night (near closing time). Seems like a good local sports bar that's reasonably priced. They have TVs everywhere so I'll definitely be checking it out again once football season starts. The bartender (who was nice) said they would show any team if asked.",UNK
14485,"Great food but not a great value. This is an expensive restaurant relative to the portion size. This is not a good value compared to most Asian restaurants but it is a different experience. Food tasted great, just relatively too expensive.",UNK
14486,Food was okay. Slow service even though it wasn't a full house. The staff also were annoyed of us because we kept asking for more salad??? I mean we were a party of 13!!! I prefer TOFU HUT!,UNK
14487,I only tried a calzone. It was huge and greasy. Not a whole lot of flavor. i did enjoy the bread. I am near this place a lot so I'll have to give it another try. Will update accordingly.,UNK
14488,Stopped in here while shopping because there was no place else to go. I did not have high expectations and my expectations were met. The food was marginal although the service was good. The burger just wasn't very good.,UNK
14489,Over rated! Doesn't compare to the pasties of the U.P. over priced for what you get too. I don't think I'll go back anytime soon.,UNK
14490,"You get what you pay for. Cheap rates, but the service and maintenance of the hotel isn't that great. The walls in Tower I are pretty thin as well. Not sure how Tower II is. Probably not staying here again in the future.",UNK
14491,"Excellent food, easy five stars on that. The service however is horrible. Have went here about 10 times, and never been asked for a refill on my soda or anything. When you approach him about it, he just mumbles and gives you one. The food is spicy, so refills are needed.",UNK
14492,"The service was very, very good, but the food was awful. If you're gonna do BBQ, just drive 15 minutes west to Rudys and get some great grub.",UNK
14493,The food was only decent and overpriced. The main reason I wouldn't go back is the uncomfortable atmosphere - something is just off.,UNK
14494,"Casual bar.  You usually get two free drinks if you stay at The Excalibur. This is a good place to use the coupons and to hang for a bit. Jim, the bartender, has been there for a while, and provides great service.",UNK
14495,"The buses are filthy, but it's cheap. That's the only reason why I'm giving it a high rating. It's great from coming down from NAU.",UNK
14496,Stayed here a couple nights.   Only payed about $40 per night.. room was okay.   Smelled weed walking dow. The hallways..  but what do you expect only $40 a night lol.  Not the worst hotel I been in.,UNK
14497,"It's just really close to work....that's why I go there. Cheap food, quick service. I don't do their coffee as Crazy Mocha is also close to work.",UNK
14498,"One word review \""meh\"". This place was seriously average, mediocre, nothing special. Great service but beyond that it was nothing to write home about.",UNK
14499,"It's Copps...East, West all the same. Poor selection, poor lighting,  bad layout and overpriced. Always has been and  always will be. I prefer Woodmans or Metro market.",UNK
14500,Great price and decent food selection. Discount available if you have Player's Card. \n$6.99 Breakfast\n$8.99 Lunch,UNK
14501,"I was here randomly with my step-uncle one day.  It's a low key place with some interesting folks.  Mostly of the 40+ age group.  Drinks are cheap.  As far as I know, most people come here for the off track betting.  Although, I also heard the pizza is good.",UNK
14502,"Venue is alright, nothing special compared to the other venues around. The only decent aspect about it is the open bar policy for girls.",UNK
14503,"Only LVCC direct option, but rooms are very run down and food options are horrible on site. They have a captive tradeshow market and have done few upgrades in past 10+ years. Decent suites for client events and catered food is good enough to impress clients with a view of the strip.",UNK
14504,CHEAP FOOD for when you are drunk and hungry. $2 for burger and fries\n\nBut the sweet potato fries here are seriously delish.,UNK
14505,"Just okay. The  salon is in the  hood. Nothing special. No follow up. Prices  comparable to high end salons. Meh. No offer for water, or refreshments on a 3 hour process.",UNK
14506,"It's food isn't as the waitperson. She super at explaining some of the dishes, my daughter didn't know.   She was prompt at with refilling our ice tea, but not hovering.  3 stars for her, 1star for the food.",UNK
14507,"Andrew our server was great! The pizza not so great. The sauce, like other reviewers have commented, lacked any flavor other than tomato. The crust was okay and the antipasti plate needed a bit more bread to enjoy the different flavors.\n\nSadly disappointed.",UNK
14508,Went with a group of 10 and I had the tilapia Bianca and I was not impressed at all. Although my Absolut lemon drop drink was good and the dessert was awesome I had the warm butter toffee cake.  Service was ok not great.,UNK
14509,"If you don't mind being looked at like a criminal by some stuffy suited workers, that you're not exactly sure are workers, whispering towards your direction and ignoring you..... then come here.\nOnce you want to purchase a $150 shirt they're nice though.",UNK
14510,"Beer is pretty decent. Garlic knots tasted like wonderbread. Pizza crust tasted like chewing on charcoal.  Come here for drinks, but not to eat.",UNK
14511,"An easy thing to do if you're in the area and looking to burn time, but thought it'd be a little more interesting than it actually was.  I guess looking at really old structures and reading hypothesis' on what they could've been used for may be your thing, but in this case it wasn't mine.",UNK
14512,"Veracruz is the greasy spoon of the Forbes Avenue Mexican restaurants.  The food is surprisingly good, considering the cheap prices.  I recommend the veggie quesodilla!",UNK
14513,"Just a small pub that we hit during our \""crawl\""  Nothing special, but had a real good time drinking german beer!",UNK
14514,"The service was good but  the food was  way too rich and heavy  for me.  It seems like everything has butter, cream or pork fat.  I guess thats Emeril style of cooking.  Not my type of food for that kind of money.",UNK
14515,"Fell into the \""it was on Food Network so let's visit\"" trap. It was an okay breakfast, but the service was pretty lackluster. Not worth driving from Phoenix for the food, however; the drive itself is very nice and they have a lovely patio on which you can eat your eggs.",UNK
14516,I was visiting and was sent here by some locals. The bar atmosphere was good and the prices were well suited for the portions. The server we had was was quick and nice. Being a bar we were told we were too loud. So maybe this place should re think the whole bar thing and just make it more of a Applebee's.,UNK
14517,"The food is usually fresh. The only problem is they have some SALTY ass fries. It never fails, no matter what time or day I go they are always super salty. Hate it.",UNK
14518,"Not happy this year, bad customer service, bed bugs, not willing to refund for my inconvenience. The 2 stars r only for the Go Room, its sheek. Management does not care. Must wait 5 days for someone to call regarding refund. Bunch of bs.",UNK
14519,"Great server, Amos.  Wine was good.  I had the Malbec special.  We all enjoyed the food.  not so bad for a crowd from Boston in Madison, WI.",UNK
14520,BBQ ribs were pretty tasty.\n\nAlso the mens bathroom by the bar smelled like trix cereal. I was oddly satisfied.,UNK
14521,Great outdoor patio...but that is about it.  Went last night and the highlight of my meal was the cheese on the nacho appetizer.  I tried their signature margarita chicken dish...what a disappointment that was....had no taste and wasn't hot.,UNK
14522,mall is ok..just somewhere to go when its snowing and cold outside but want to get out the house..and my cousins like the carousel.,UNK
14523,"Entrees were very good, but the soup and egg roll were at least a day old. I'm sure it's a great place when there are actual customers, but the lack of patronage seems to have made them a little lazy.",UNK
14524,"Nice starting point for walking up one of 7 Hills' seven hils, and you'll be rewarded with an expansive view of the Strip. The park has tennis courts and sand volleyball, and the dreaded basketball courts. Hate'em, they are way too noisy to be in the middle of a neighborhood. Leave them indoors only.",UNK
14525,"Service was nice, but the food.....my second time here after 3years.....don't recall the first time if I liked it?  but my husband wanted Chinese.....really sorry to say that we felt even Panda Express was better than here =(",UNK
14526,"Conveniently located at the entrance of the Mirage, its a great location for grabbing a quick beer.   My only issue is the two fat tire beers cost 15 bucks...yikes!",UNK
14527,"It's a nice book store I have only been there once, cause I got a gift card. My mother in law loves the place. Myself I find it a little over priced and not a big selection it's a book store but nothing amazing. It's just meh.",UNK
14528,"The kitchen is open until midnight which was very convenient when my friend and I were starving and nothing nearby was open. \n\nSt. Hubert restaurants are ubiquitous in the province. The food is reliable and good, and their dipping sauce is like crack. It's damn delicious.",UNK
14529,"cute, good location, but all hype.  they screwed up my order and charged me extra, go figure.  a friend also got bad food poisoning. also, vegetarian / non-meat options are tofu, tofu, or tofu.",UNK
14530,"Every time I go into this store I feel very uncomfortable! The security guard followed me around the store peeking at me from behind aisles! Not so slick, and very annoying!",UNK
14531,"It is a McDonald's in the middle of Oakland. It is a fast food chain and they are usually busy. The only good thing is that they are open 24 hours so you can always get your late night greasy snack! I had a coupon, so I went there. I wouldn't pick it for an every day meal.",UNK
14532,selection isnt the greatest and that speaks for the staff as well. \n\nthe rent a cop takes his job a little too seriously.,UNK
14533,Automic gratuity for a party of 3? Really? \n\nIt would be fine and all expect the gratuity charge was separated from the actual printed receipt and was just hand written on a different piece of paper. Kinda weird.,UNK
14534,This place has decent food. The sevice is slow and staff is often pleasantly confused. If you don't mind waiting this is a good spot for lunch.,UNK
14535,"This place Is very laid back, good service and the bartenders sing a tune or two for you. Great place to bring a date.",UNK
14536,"Would def skip this place. Service was terrible, barely any employees spoke English. Took forever to get three sandwiches. Portions are def large but not would have rather gone to subway for the cost/outcome of the meal",UNK
14537,"Delicious, not earth shattering. Potbelly is better. However, in a sea of overpriced and mediocre food options, this place is well-priced - cheap, even! - and thus a standout.",UNK
14538,the food is WAY too salty.  portions were generous and my favorite was the giant fortune cookie- definitely the highlight.  everything else was ehh.. \n\nThe ambiance and decor was nice as well..\nI'd say this restaurant is more for booty shakin than dining.,UNK
14539,"It saddens me to the core that they don't open until 10:30am. So, so not Vegas of them. Weak. I need beef",UNK
14540,"They have an amazing variety and the owner was really helpful and friendly. The quality and freshness varied a bit across the items; however, the pieces that were really fresh were delicious. I will definitely come back and try out some of the other pieces; it seems the cake slices held up better than the smaller individual miniature cakes.",UNK
14541,"I had lunch here and we ordered the fried zucchini as an appetizer that was yummy but the cod with chips was overly greasy, the grease is still stuck to my pallet. Sorry to say but Pete's fish and chips is better.",UNK
14542,"This Starbucks is alright. Their drinks are good but they aren't as customizable as other Starbucks. I tried ordering things found on secret menus but they won't allow customization of any kind. Not only that but their drive thru service is really hard to drive through, and parking is very scarce.",UNK
14543,"I had them manage a couple of my properties for a few years and they were OK then their office manager or the main person I dealt with suddenly was gone then the service went downhill, really very poor service which was costing me money.  Hired a new management company and am much happier now.  Overall not a good experience with them.",UNK
14544,"Brauhaus, you have the best range of foreign beers but sadly this obsession with showing football all the time spoils it all.  Your seating layout is pretty rubbish too.\nI will thus keep buying your awesome beers in your sister's shop Nina's round the corner where I always get good banter anyway.",UNK
14545,"Pretty cool place.  Not very attentive staff and a bit elitist, but thats Scottsdale for you.  Who has a waterfall-pool in the middle of the club that you can't swim in?  whats the point?",UNK
14546,It is a coffee shop. also sells yogurt. WiFi did not work. If you need your fix it is better than nothing,UNK
14547,For the price and the amenities this place is nice. They give you access to Gold's gym across the street which is worth my stay there. It's close to the 10. There are lots of food options closeby. Fridge in the room. Free internet. What else could you ask for?,UNK
14548,"I love the coffee here, and the pastries are very nice as well. Although the nocochi cookies are very overpriced and miniscule compared to other Persian bakeries.",UNK
14549,"Service was OK, staff was nice.  Decent beer selection.  Food was pretty good.  Comfy chairs at the tables.  GOOD appetizer / tapas menu if you don't want to go with full dishes.  Note: I was here for lunch not dinner, not sure if the menu changes for dinner.",UNK
14550,Nice clean buffet. Half the food was cold and the service was almost non existent. For the money I would drive the extra way to Lins.,UNK
14551,Wanted to give there cupcakes a try.  I have to admit they are not my favorite. The cake was very crumbly and had only a slight amount of flavor.  The cream cheese frosting was gooey and messy.  I really don't feel they are worth $3.00 a pop.  Just my opinion.,UNK
14552,food is pretty bland. been here a couple times just to make sure i didn't just come on a bad day. There are way better places in Las Vegas for Indian food.,UNK
14553,"Phenomenal food at a great price. Had never heard of Pupusas until this week and ended up going for lunch twice. However, lack of servers make for an extremely slow dining experience so be prepared to have a long lunch.",UNK
14554,"Holy moly!  Don't come on a Sunday!   Out of veggie burger's, mac & cheese bits and coke!  Then the fryer went out!!!\nThere were 7 of us and at least half of us got something spilled on us by our server!",UNK
14555,"Am dying to try this place after reading the reviews. I'm 3rd-gen Cuban & also curious---has anyone checked out the live music here? Is it authentic Cuban music, and if so, when does it happen? Thanks!",UNK
14556,"Is this place under new ownership?  It has new faces and the ambiance has changed.  The jazzy funky coffee shop feel is disappearing to oldies music.  The food and coffee is still the same, I just hope they don't install a big screen and show espn all day.",UNK
14557,Great service and okay food. I ordered 5-Spicy level ( where 4 is Thai hot) and the food came out tasting sweet. I love La's Thai on McDowell and Hayden much better,UNK
14558,"This is a decent happy hour spot.  I go here occasionally with a group of my girlfriends (ages 20s and 30s) and we reserve one of the big corner booths.  Sushi is good, drinks are excellent.  Bill is usually around $30.  Service is decent.",UNK
14559,"EH.....Items on their menu are definitely hit or miss.  Burgers are great as are the ribs but I would stay away from the tri tip.  their spicy wings are really spicy and would be great with some ranch but the ranch they brought us tasted more like blue cheese, YUCK!",UNK
14560,"Overpriced, even on things you can get the same of at walmart or food4less. They try to upsell you at the ice, people think its free when they ask if you would like ice, but its not. Ill start shopping here again when I am rich.",UNK
14561,"Meh. This is a repurposed Roberto's and let me tell you, it does not compare at all. It's ok or whatever, but... meh.",UNK
14562,"Way overpriced. Mustard salmon is weird and I generally love mustard. Service has been horrendous/rude at times. Desserts are so-so ... Go to Cheesecake Factory. Also, twice baked potato that waitress recommended was way overcooked and flavorless.",UNK
14563,Some of the dishes are good but others are better.  This place needs a remodel and more organization.  They have a strange way of ordering your food.  I won't  be back! I have had much better!,UNK
14564,Worth eating here but not exceptional. I am a poor person so restaurants that are *slightly* more expensive have to be worth the extra cash for the marginal improvement of food quality. I can't say spending more money was worth it to me. Ok bar to drink at.,UNK
14565,"This location does not do reloads on your card, sorry, not all of us have smart phones with the app.  Also, no free wi-fi.",UNK
14566,"They do have a really lovely salad with a mystery dressing that none of us can identify. But the service was awful, had to bang on the bell several times, and the girl who came out from the back seemed irritated by us being there. Won't go back, as I can get as good elsewhere and not feel like I'm bothering them.",UNK
14567,"4stars for cleanliness and atmosphere. 2 stars for the food i had on my first and probably last visit, menudo. 2 stars for the mild salsa.",UNK
14568,Ate here on Friday night the food was great. The stand outs were the byson and souffl\u00e9. The service however was very poor. I would have a hard time returning for just that reason. It's a shame that the chef's creations were overshadowed by the horrible service!,UNK
14569,"This is strictly a BREAKFAST review.  For the price, you can't beat it in the area (Centennial Hills).  The service is a little shoddy, but overall a great deal to recharge on a Sunday morning",UNK
14570,"If you are planning on having food delivered from Joes think again. Called this place 3 different times with the same result every time, being put on hold for over ten minutes. Pizza is great here its just a shame you cant get it delivered to your home if you want take out. Stills gets a favorable rank due to the quality of pizza.",UNK
14571,I have been going to Siena Animal Hospital for a year now and it is ok. I do think the prices are rather high but the staff is good.,UNK
14572,"Daniel Fast friendly restaurant with good food. Stopped for an early supper before Saturday night church service after searching Yelp for vegan restaurant options. Food was good, service was good, price was very reasonable. Think I just found a new Saturday evening supper spot.",UNK
14573,The omelet and hash browns were just a pile of warm calories but the biscuit was good and the service was friendly.\n\n2013 #182 / 365,UNK
14574,It used to have a bigger selection but they closed the back wall. It's one of the better buffets. But nothing amazing. Dinner is a lot more worth then breakfast. Breakfast does not even have a omelet/pancake station which I thought was weird.,UNK
14575,Steak N Shake in name only. Disappointing if you've ever been to the real thing. I'll stick with In N Out,UNK
14576,Went there to drink... I hardly pregamed and I paid for it... I spent roughly $70 on beer and liquor.. one bill of 2 beers and 3 shots was 23... so not horrible but geeeeez im broke. lol,UNK
14577,"This restaurant was clean, and nice, the service was good. However, stay away from the bun bo hue, it was a disaster. I've never tasted anything so horrible!!! The pho was decent though, I've never tried anything else there. I will probably not come back.",UNK
14578,"Really good salad... not so much on the hummus. If I wanted stewed green beans, I would have ordered them. You don't have to put them on top of my delicious chickpea spread.\n\nAlso please warm up your bread.",UNK
14579,We enjoyed the Friday Fish Fry in the past.  Just called--number is disco'd.  I heard they went out of business.,UNK
14580,"It was OK beer and  so so pizza.  Chain restaurant in Old town Montreal, looks unique from the street, but ends there.  Seems to be the Canadian equivalent of TGI Fridays.",UNK
14581,"Ate here because of free buffet with room stay which is only good for lunch or breakfast. Food was ok, sushi is not edible. Deserts were disappointing.",UNK
14582,"Overall not a bad steak sandwich, the French fries can use a little help.  Price was fair and the size of the sandwich was perfect.",UNK
14583,"The complimentary trio of duck fat fries w/various dipping sauces was a great start to a nice steak dinner. If you've won big, splurge on one of the market priced Japanese A5 grade wagyu steaks (up to $350).",UNK
14584,So I went to check out this new place and although they do not have a lot of the plates I was expecting they have really really really good ceviche!!!! And there prices and fair!!,UNK
14585,"Not the best breakfast in town by a mile. The service was incredibly slow. When we got our breakfast, both my daughter in my pancakes for ice cold. I will never come back here again.",UNK
14586,"Like all US Airways clubs, I'm not too impressed.  Stopped here twice in the last week on two layovers, and was super disappointed with the food.  They only carry chips and cookies, which left me pretty hungry.",UNK
14587,"The customer service sucks, like all Lee's locations I've been to. But, the beer and booze selection is pretty darn good and it's right around the corner so we come here frequently.",UNK
14588,"Ceasar side salad was awesome. Bleu \""Blues Burger\"" was very mediocre. Dry and overdone. \n\nAll-female string band was tons of fun.",UNK
14589,"Flamingo was my favorite with GO delux rooms, but my goodness their customer service is so terrible I would never go there again! There is a manager by the mane Ron or starts with the letter R, maybe Ramon. Total jerk! You do not believe me please go ahead",UNK
14590,"1st of all, those wanting plain coffee are put in line waiting just like the complicated orders. While waiting, at least 3 orders were called twice, including ours. Waited 5 minutes in line to order and add'l 5 for coffee. Not good in an airport. Need a better system.",UNK
14591,Worst service. I would think that because of the new restaurant you would increase service. But nope service was slowwww. Took about 15 min till we even got water. We just got our drinks and didn't get anything else. Plus the people around us were soo loud and obnoxious it was horrible,UNK
14592,"I happened to stop here after my daughter had a dentist appointment on the recommendation of the dentist office staff.  The food is just your average quick Japanese style grill.   Nothing special.   The portions were nice, the staff friendly and the food came out ultra quick.  There is a nice outdoor patio that is enjoyable for people watching.",UNK
14593,Ambitious menu with dishes and prices that would rival Barrio Cafe.  Unfortunately it hasn't distinguished itself from such lofty company or even pulled ahead of the multitude other Mexican spots in the Valley.,UNK
14594,Neat concept but over priced for what it's worth. Coffee and food were pricey and nothing to brag about. My 1 year old didn't care for it much. It's definitely geared toward toddlers to about 7 years old.,UNK
14595,Ok...just ok. The first time we went the food was great. This time it was ok. The bread was disappointing. It was less than Olive Garden quality with Ventano prices.,UNK
14596,The service and view are great. We found the food to be mediocre at best. Way overpriced for the food quality.,UNK
14597,The service was pretty good. If you love salt get the meat meatballs because they are salty! The classic was the perfect combination of taste. Classic sauce was great. The problem is the prices are over priced for the portion sizes. At least offer bread while waiting for food. I would come back if I'm not starving.,UNK
14598,"Mike is a nice enough guy, he just needs to manage his time more efficiently.  If you decide to use his services, you will need a lot of patience. Just saying!",UNK
14599,"Very marginal food, service, and atmosphere.  there is a live bill out front, and it really makes the whole area smell like cow flops. Disneyland atmosphere.",UNK
14600,I personally wouldn't come back here again. The waiters were wonderful but the price I paid wasn't worth it. I felt like my sushi was meh and my miso soup tasted like it came out of a bag. Salty. gross.,UNK
14601,Customer service is so so but what do you expect when your establishment is in the New York New York casino and you cater to a-holes all day. Food is a great value. Large selection of sweet and breakfast style crepes for under $10. Good value,UNK
14602,"We stopped here on our first trip through the airport.  It was about 6am and they already had customers eating their breakfast.  So we joined the small crowd.  We got the basic breakfast (eggs, bacon, potatoes and toast).  It was good.  Service was very good, she kept on top of all her guest needs with a smile and cheerful words.",UNK
14603,"Wildflower is a great place for a quick breakfast or lunch, food is generally good and service fast.  However with the lunch crush it always puzzles me why people who are not eating are allowed to use booths to work on their computers...so rude!!  Mushroom soup was pretty good today.",UNK
14604,Not impressed... Connecting in PHX . They did not have shrimp and ran out of guacamole... What Mexican without Guacamole?,UNK
14605,"Nice lunch special & very reasonable.  Don't know what it's like for dinner, though.  Had the chili paste & was asked how spicy I wanted it on a scale of 1-10.  Got a 5 & it was just about right for me. Very filling, too!",UNK
14606,"Cool bar, fun crowd, horrible service.  I paid $25 for 4 drinks which is awesome, but cheap drinks comes at the price at bartenders who were slow to customers and smartass about that.  Every bar has a different appeal, but bad service ruins it for me.",UNK
14607,"Went to lunch Sunday of Memorial Day weekend. The music was too loud and all the booth tables were occupied or dirty. I'm sure the workers would have rather been else where. However, they still have the best Boston Clam Chowder and the featured sandwich of the month \""Club West\"" was really tasty.",UNK
14608,"The beer selection is limited to what you might find in convince store (in states where this is possible. Sandwiches are Pittsburgh landmarks though and the food is good but nothing truly special. Great place to hang with friends, catch a game and chow down.",UNK
14609,Incompetent manager that wasn't able to cancel an order on one card so it could be put on another card....luckily for this place there is no competition so their customer service can be as poor as they want it to be,UNK
14610,Pink's seems to be undergoing three changes as time goes on.\n1)Price increase\n2)Lower quality\n3)More customers,UNK
14611,"Acoustics are all right, but seats are not that comfortable.\n\nGood location, good selection of movies, but if you watch a late night movie it is very deserted.",UNK
14612,"Nope not a fan.  I got cheese popcorn, I mean how can a person go wrong with cheese popcorn right?  My taste buds didn't like it, it tasted like popcorn from a bag.   I was just expecting so much more.",UNK
14613,"Food was very average...Entree selection was not impressive, deserts were very good.   Ambience was low key-boring....... \n\nNot bad for the price, but not memorable...",UNK
14614,"Mexican food was mediocre. However service was great, very friendly staff. Its a touristy place located in the Hard Rock casino. It was a good experience. I recommend it if your in the area.",UNK
14615,"2nd time not a charm...cold soup, overfried chicken, fishy fish...this place used to be ok..not sure what happened.The server was very kind and apologetic, server was great!",UNK
14616,Mmm...peppermint mocha\n\nIn my quest to visit every Starbucks in the USA I have stopped at yet another location.  This one is located in the center of a circle road -- very cache and in a newer part of the area.,UNK
14617,"The food here is really good. I've had both the tacos and burritos. Their gucamole is also quite yummy. On the downside, I think their portions are a little on the small side.",UNK
14618,"It was alright, but if I'm driving that far I'm going to Maggiano's. The aroma that you smell when you walk in gets you excited about their food. However it doesn't WOW you or anything. Service was good and attentive.",UNK
14619,not happy.\nThe to-go containers of Hummus shouldnt leave you questioning the order.....curved sides ONLY work with __________ (will refrain from being funny),UNK
14620,Was recommended by a local as the best place for steak in Vegas.  Service was great but food was marginal at best. I would not go back.,UNK
14621,"Came here on a groupon. Had bacon wrapped shrimp. good flavors, but the shrimp was over done. Typical beans and rice. Nothing special. The food did come to the table hot. Nothing really stands out about this place.",UNK
14622,really nice hotel with great rooms.\n\nit would be four stars except for the bartender who a. didn't know what a negroni was and b. only realized there was no compari after the gin and vermouth was prepared.,UNK
14623,"Pretentious, and they charge a high cover charge and don't open until 9:00 p.m.\nRed-flocked wallpaper complete with raised designs of velvet.  Dark and tattooey.",UNK
14624,Possibly the worst service I've had at a valley restaurant in years. The manager must be trying to save money on the electric bill this week as the indoor ambient temp is a very uncomfortable 87 degrees tonight. Wings were decent enough to earn two stars. Probably won't be back to this Chandler mall location again,UNK
14625,"This used to be my favorite sushi place, due to the variety and desserts. (Tempura ice cream yuuuum) but their service became slow and it was always too busy .\nThe sushi is not really wow to me , it's just yummy",UNK
14626,"Had burger and the wife had the buffalo chicken sandwich. Fries were good but the burger and chicken were average. Considering the quality, I thought $12 for each sandwich was a bit high. Nothing special here.",UNK
14627,Ace usually has those hard-to-find items you can't get anywhere else but it's so annoying going out of your way to come here to spend 2x's more than anywhere else. Plus all the Ace Hardwares don't take back stuff from other Ace Hardware's. How ridiculous is that?,UNK
14628,"Had to wait for a lane for twenty minutes for no apparent reason. Fun, but overpriced. Good luck if you want a ball under ten pounds and you are not a chipmunk or a midget.",UNK
14629,If you're over fifty then this is the place for you.  If you're over sixty then you'll be in heaven.\n\nI was here tonight and enjoyed a couple of glasses of wine and catching up with friends.  The circular bar is great and the front patio is pretty nice as well.,UNK
14630,"Pretty good going down, but the fire is still coming up on me 5 hours later! I guess I should have gone with the mild instead of hot.",UNK
14631,"My beer was watery and service was not good. Our server obviously forgot to enter our food order into the computer, and never even apologized for her oversight. We prefer to grab a beer and watch sports at House of Brews right down the street.",UNK
14632,"A subway is a sub way no matter what but i jut thought that this one had a little better servis and was a little more clean than the rest,",UNK
14633,"Expensive and nothing that wows you.  Service was great though.  If I ever find myself in the area again, I'll drop by for a drink.  They have cool drinks on their menu.  Otherwise, pass on the sushi.",UNK
14634,Service is hit or miss. Pretty typical of a small nail salon. Shirley is fantastic..I'm not sure what to say about some of the other nail technicians..they've always done a consistent job with my manicures and pedicures but bad attitudes can definitely ruin the experience.,UNK
14635,"Both times that I've gone to Drybar I leave with my hair looking pretty good, but an hour later the curls have fallen out and my hair has gone flat.",UNK
14636,We had a group work dinner so it was a pre fix menu so it's hard to judge but the food was just so-so.  The steak was SO salty.,UNK
14637,"Feels like a high school dance sometimes. People don't seem to be having too much fun.  Kinda fun to dance on the risers, but those same predatory men (every time) are not fun at all.  The music has its high points but is usually just tolerable.",UNK
14638,Service was great - very nice servers. Food was awful - tasted like something created from a can or TV dinner - pizza was not cooked all the way and cheese was very poor in quality - as pizza cooled the cheese became clear? The Alfredo tasted like cheese whiz :(,UNK
14639,"I have only gone here for kids/baby gifts and it's a great place to find that perfect, unique gift. It's really pricey, so be prepared to spend a lot. However, they have complimentary gift wrap and it looks really nice when they're done.",UNK
14640,The atmosphere is pleasant.  There was a very short wait on a Wednesday night at dinner time.  The food was served hot and was very attractive.  The portions were huge enough for another meal tomorrow.  The fried chicken came with two fried chicken breasts.,UNK
14641,"We go there mostly for tea and have recently been trying the food... The food is just ok. As much as I wanted to like the prepared meals and baked goods, I have yet to like anything I've eaten. After 4 failed (and expensive!) trips for lunch/dessert, I'll just stick to the tea.",UNK
14642,"Got a message from the owner. I appreciate that at least - though it doesn't really change my view on my experience and my review still holds. To soften it though, I'll just say this place definitely isn't for me.",UNK
14643,Service was nice. Pork loin was very good and kale salad was pretty good. Overall most dishes were average. Drinks were reasonable but this place doesn't compare to its sister restaurant beckett table and they ran out of 4 things at 8pm on Saturday night...come on...,UNK
14644,"The food is good, the wait staff not so much, ordered a sandwich with sweet potato fries and got a small handful of fries for as much as I paid I think they could spare more disappointed",UNK
14645,"A really terrible bar, with $9 miller lites and lots of people waiting around for someplace better to be.\n\nWe sat at the bar and had a couple of beers as we waited for our gang to get together. the bar staff were friendly but they gave us a dog of a recommendation to go an eat somewhere.",UNK
14646,"Entertaining. Recommend sitting 4+ rows back from stage. Loud speakers and if you're too close you see too much to let your imagination drift. Favorite puppet, Vicki the cougar. Too funny! Cowboy Christmas theme was very clever and well orchestrated. Band members looked terribly bored.",UNK
14647,"1.5 stars.  I agree with Eszter, this deserves 2 stars only because of the service.  A sad little \""Chinese\"" buffet with a smattering of overcooked options.  Soups were borderline offensive.  There probably won't be a wait!",UNK
14648,"They have a decent selection but make sure to look at the expiration dates of the condoms you buy here. They frequently sell expired condoms. Or at least, condoms with incorrect expiration dates. I have better luck buying condoms at gas stations. Watch out.",UNK
14649,"Not a fan. I visited here 4 times over a year ago. Thought the food was mediocre at best. The atmosphere was cool and the service OK. Not interested in returning. Have lots of other options. The atmosphere is unique and cool, but not enough to return.",UNK
14650,The food is good... When u finally get it. The service here sucks. I'm an employee of Caesars and it's really sad that they offer such poor customer service on one of our properties. And they charge $2/person  for water. WATER. really!!!! Wtf,UNK
14651,Love Krispy Kreme but I do not like this location...it has only been open a short while and already the floor behind the counter is filthy. No free glazed as you wait for service...understaffed and no atmosphere makes this a take away spot...,UNK
14652,I love getting all dolled up and going to South Park Mall!  Dont show up here (or anywhere really please) in your sweats and hoodie!\n\nPlease get an H&M!!!!  Other than that everything I love is here...always clean and classy :-D,UNK
14653,"FINALLY. Bubble Tea that is made using real tea! I have had such a hard time finding real bubble tea in Montreal. This place delivers and to a high standard. Great range of flavors, topping and so delicious.",UNK
14654,"This is my first \""Mexican\"" restaurant that I encountered in las vegas. The food is not so good. The margaritas are good. Simply said.",UNK
14655,This place has not gotten any better over the past 10 years. The service is still bad and they are always running out of food and the food isn't that great either.  Will have to say that I will not be going back to this location or the one off of Glendale and 19th ave.,UNK
14656,"The food was good, really awesome interior. Only fault was they didn't have many vegetarian options. That was a huge bummer.",UNK
14657,"They did eventually call us back.  She said her brother died which is sad, that is why I added a star bc I'm sure she was distraught.  Things are fine now, though we are not using them on a regular basis anymore of course.",UNK
14658,So this is the first Indian place where my palak paneer was orange and not green and my roti was a wheat tortilla cooked on a stone. But it is a big portion for 5.50.,UNK
14659,First time to this Chain and it was Okay! Service was good and the food was just okay nothing I would rush back for to be honest,UNK
14660,The hotel has great location at the middle of the strip with access to the monorail. Entrance was hard to find. Cafe waiting staff sucks. ghe Buffet was surprisingly good with great service staff.,UNK
14661,Went here to watch the College National Champ game.  Was not as crowded as you would think but it was a Monday.  I didn't eat here.  Had a few drinks is all.  Cool place to hang out.  Would like to go here again,UNK
14662,"Pho wasnt all that great, but a great way to cure a hangover...\nbroth wasnt good and the waiters and waitresses forgot alotta things that we ordered.",UNK
14663,"Calamari, overcooked. 2 orders of veal, overcooked. Drunk guy walking around the entire meal screaming? priceless.",UNK
14664,Got the burger of the month.  Was good but not exceptional.  The menu is a little pricy for the quality and service.,UNK
14665,They have alot of clothes.  They recently expanded the back to allow for more furniture.  They have a decent selection of items but I think that their prices are sometimes way too high for a thrift store.,UNK
14666,"\""A-OK\"" is a nice way to put it. \n\nThe show isn't much, but the price you can't beat. I would say nice way to start the night with a few laughs.\n\nIt's a good time if the crowd gets into it.",UNK
14667,Plan about 15 minutes for your drink since they only staff with one worker. I've been in enough times to find it's the norm.,UNK
14668,It would only be fair that I update everyone about Wimpy's. Here is their new rating which they happily hung in public view I may add!!,UNK
14669,"We came here for drinks after the Pacquiao fight. We didn't eat anything, but Yardhouse always has a solid selection as far as adult libations are concerned. The servers are cool. Pretty on par with other Yardhouses, although this one seemed to be pretty packed.",UNK
14670,Stratosphere is a decent place to stay especially if you are on a budget.  My room was comfortable and clean.  The casino is large and not smoky.  The restaurants were conveniently located throughout the casino floor with a lot more quick cheap options on the second floor.  The only drawback is it is a few extra minutes drive from the Strip.,UNK
14671,It's a chain restaurant what do you expect? ..... Chips and salsa to go... Watching the cowboys hot chips seems like good start,UNK
14672,We got our moneys worth during Tiger hour after 11 PM. The sushi was good. Not a lot of ambience. I go back again for a late night happy hour.,UNK
14673,I like everything about this store and it would get a five star but their produce does not last beyond a day or two once you get it home.  If you buy produce here you had better use it that day.  Very poor quality in their produce.  However their Deli rocks!,UNK
14674,"I can't understand where the good reviews are coming from, the employees were pretty friendly, but other than that the pizza was mediocre at best. They gave me about the smallest side of Ranch in existence when I asked for it, and we couldn't be on their patio with beer for some reason. Won't be going here again.",UNK
14675,"Now that they are back up & running, we tried again. Food is back to good & prices are decent. I don't feel like the service is where it should be, but I get it. I'm gonna go now & then, I like the food & location.",UNK
14676,"Had the chicken here. Was somehow unevenly cooked and bland. So bland. Friend had a vegetarian special, which was better, but still unimpressive. Realize it was only 12$ for dinner, and yet somehow still entirely not worth it.",UNK
14677,Disappointing.  The savory crepes I was looking forward to was dry and chewy.  My wife's was same dry crepe and way too sweet.  At least the frappe wasn't bad.,UNK
14678,"This market is not my usual go to market unless there's a sale going on. The quality and selection doesn't really compare to most markets around. What can you say, they're cheap?",UNK
14679,"Food is nothing close to special, service is decent.  They recently upgraded their beer list which is great. I usually come here for PPV events such as UFC, place does get pretty busy since not many places show UFC PPV events.",UNK
14680,"They have a weird process of getting ppl in, but the place isn't that bad. Reminds me of just any typical Hollywood club, the sound system bangs pretty hard +1. Interesting acrobatics on the dance floor, pregame beforehand or your wallet will come out a lot lighter....",UNK
14681,"I have yet to try other options but between this and Aloha, pretty much same. Descent. I need to try Roy's, although I am sure it is going to be much pricier!",UNK
14682,i went there on new years eve. We arrived at the club around 10:15 to pick up the tickets. We got into the club at 11:30. so people that got there at 11 rung in the new years waiting in line. The bouncers were on power trips. Everyone got so sloppy drunk.,UNK
14683,"Place has a smokey smell, beer is expensive (for what ever reason), staff is nice, Too many Wisconsin people in one area of Las Vegas, Music is nice, TVS and seating is well-placed...Floors appear dirty (dark for a reason)...",UNK
14684,"I haven't had the food, but the scenery is great. I like that they play rock music because I'm not really into house/club. Get there just a little before the crowd, get a seat and enjoy the view.",UNK
14685,The atmosphere is relaxing and gorgeous.  Had the dynamite with tuna and crab ($20). It took forever to get my food and it was gross. The rice was old and the seafood either wasn't fresh or wasn't cooked right.  The staff was nice and friendly.,UNK
14686,"Food just okay nothing special. As a lunch that is okay, for dinner NOT.\nThe staff customer service is mixed. Been there twice and the hostess in the front was terrific, the bartender was cool, the waitress - oh no!",UNK
14687,"Super awesome event. They managed to cater to my veggie needs. The set up was nice the yelpers were super cool and the Moscatohad to be the strongest ever. We loved it, the first two dishes win the others no so much. One person said they could see they're reflection in the cheese!!!  Yikes",UNK
14688,"I hate walking in here because it always stinks.  They really need to ventilate this place.  My daughter loves it, always had a great time, whether she is skating or attending Club 54.  Great place for birthday parties, she loved her party.  She also got a butt-load of tokens with the party package.",UNK
14689,"Bar and Patio a solid 4 stars.  Food and restaurant 2 stars. (4+2)/2 = 3 stars.  The cocktails are good, but the food completely uninspired.",UNK
14690,"this place is okay. i didn't really care for the music or the atmosphere, but the drag show was good enough to earn it an extra star.",UNK
14691,Yes it looks a bit sketchy on the outside but inside not that bad at all booked it for a night after staying the on strip for a couple of days. 45 is a great price just pay cash and your good to go. I would definetly stay there again.,UNK
14692,We sit in bar.  Like the food and people watching.  Many TVs with sports channels.  Kind of pricey.  Quick service when not busy.   Wait staff great and friendly.  Outdoor seating covered and misters,UNK
14693,"Steak was ok... Service was ok... Extremely loud. The kids liked their meals, but steak is bland.",UNK
14694,I was only impressed with the Seviche (hope i spelled that right). Other than that the place is more about the atmosphere than they are the food. The fish tacos were dry and lacking flavor.,UNK
14695,"Usually a pretty solid bet - both food and drink are predictable, good, but predictable. Love their wings though, definitely have their specialty down pat. If you're in the mood for fried food (you name it, it's fried here) and a cold beer, come on down!",UNK
14696,The service is very poor. You might see your waiter once or twice. My food was cold and not very good. I won't be back.,UNK
14697,Food was good. But remember this is chandler Arizona not downtown Chicago. A little overpriced. Hostess forgot to seat us until we reminded him.,UNK
14698,For Arizona it was ok.  The menu was a little heavy on the fried rolls.  Waiter was very friendly.  The soy sauce dishes were the size of soup bowls and they gave us metal soup spoons with the miso - must be authentic Arizona sushi.,UNK
14699,It was okay.  Husband orered the carne asada burrito .. husband said it tasted like nacho cheese sauce was used instead of shredded cheese.  Combo meal was okay.  Got the chile rellano and a shredded beef sour cream green chile enchilada.,UNK
14700,We liked the old menu much better than the new one at the recently moved location. Chicken tortilla soup used to excellent.  Now it is mediocre. Margarita was terrible.  Not even a lime slice. Expensive new menu sucks and we will not go back nor any of our friends.,UNK
14701,"I go to this place one time per month....the food is ok..it's not the best in Chinatown,they offer the soup and the Chinese sweet soup free,this is the point I comme here...they make the Chinese dessert red bean soup,it's my favorite!!!",UNK
14702,"South Park is a really nice, really fancy mall, but I generally hate being there. It's the kind of mall that requires you to be dressed up to shop there. If you just want a normal mall with all the normal stores, check out Carolina Pavilion.",UNK
14703,Not up to par as our last experience there. Food was just mediocre and the wait staff although busy was not pleasant this time. Might just be a bad day . We went on a friday morning. really was surprised.,UNK
14704,"Although, I really liked my lash extensions and Patrice, I purchased a pre-pay to get my fills, and now they've closed SHOP!!!",UNK
14705,"The price was reasonable for a veggie quesadilla, but I would probably not visit this place again. The food didn't seem fresh, and seemed to be almost \""fast foodish\""\n\nWorth the price though. 3.00 veggie quesadilla, cool!",UNK
14706,"cute presentation but food wasn't so great.  the dessert especially was too sweet, too dry, or just bleh. not really worth the $35 for sunday brunch.",UNK
14707,"Did not live up to the hype. Tried chicken, beef, and carne. All of them lacked flavor. The horchata was good.",UNK
14708,I havent had a bad experience yet.... takes a long time to get food out tho.. thats the only bad..,UNK
14709,"The wait was 2 hours.  They give you a ton of food, but it tasted just okay.  I don't think its worth the wait.",UNK
14710,"50.00 for dinner, drinks are an extra charge.  Not that good.  No Shrimp or Fish.  I would still feel a little slighted at 30.00.",UNK
14711,Normal cheap hotel. Needs to be updated but very clean and fine especially for the price range. Was able to get the room for $75 for off nights and they did offer a military discount on prime nights for $84. 5 minute drive to hospital and close to multiple restaurants and bars.,UNK
14712,The service in the deli SUCKS. The female behind the counter has no personality and she is ride as hell. Can't say hi how and you. She just look at me and kept doing what is was doing.,UNK
14713,"Rice was really dry so they brought out fresh rice, however they never should have served that awful rice in the first place. This one is not as good service as home in la/oc but what do you expect in Vegas",UNK
14714,"Food is ok. Large portion. Service is below average. Comparing with another Sam Woo, this one is expensive one.\nWhy I stay on a long line for this ok but pricy food?",UNK
14715,I really hate cold buffet food. Nd today all items were cold. Maybe we arrived too soon after opening but we had to leave and I asked for a refund. I was given a gift card for a return visit which was nice.,UNK
14716,Great prices.  Good prime rib. Noise level is a bit high.  Would have given it a 5 but I did not like having to yell my order across the table to the server and my colleague got sick from the peanuts.,UNK
14717,"Prix \u00e9lev\u00e9 pour le type de nourriture. Par contre, la qualit\u00e9 des produits ainsi que le go\u00fbt sont au rendez-vous!",UNK
14718,OVERPRICED!  I'm willing to pay $25 for a sushi roll but it had better be good.  The food here lacked flavor.  Only good things were corn bread muffin and crispy  in bread basket.  Fish was not fresh. Service was good.,UNK
14719,This buffet was my favorite in Las Vegas until my recent visit.  Now it/s just not worth the price.  The quality has fallen while the price has risen.  Apparently the economy has taken it's toll.,UNK
14720,"Went here on a double date. I would say that everything was \""good\"". I found it to be a little over priced. Nothing wrong- nothing great.",UNK
14721,"Food was delicious. I had the chicken fried steak, eggs, hash browns and a biscuit with gravy. Wife had the Texas omelet which was yummy as well.  Huge negative though. Place was dark and dirty. There was a thick layer of dust every where.",UNK
14722,Not the worst pizza but definitely not very good. The crust isn't very thin and everything is just fair. The quest for good pizza in madison continues,UNK
14723,I've only been to this place once to eat and see a show. The casino floor is really nice as well as the gaming areas.\n\nThe customer service for one of their shows was horrible. All in all average newer casino.,UNK
14724,Dropped off my old oil here. Easy although it was weird just trampling to the back and having to find it myself. LOL.,UNK
14725,"Ugh ugh ugh! Man, for being such a great chain for wings, this place STUNK! The dressing and dip is no longer freshly made, but Ken's best ranch. Not ok. It was just a disappointment.",UNK
14726,"Stopped here for breakfast one morning during our recent stay in Vegas.  Food was average as were portions,  decent enough but nothing special.  Wait staff was ok,  nothing special.  Doubt I would repeat going here again.  Breakfast for four was @ 65.00.",UNK
14727,"Bad sushi, do not try the coconut nigori, it's not that good. Everything is overpriced for the poor quality fish. Avoid this place, or just order the Kung Pao Chicken. You can never go wrong with that. But at this price, you'd be better off at Panda Express.",UNK
14728,"I know people either love this place or hate it. I don't like it at all. Yes they have great portion sizes, but I was disappointed with my meal the two times I have been there. To each his own",UNK
14729,Chips and salsa were great! The margaritas were decent and the food was yummy! This is probably the closest to authentic that we've gotten since we got down to Arizona.,UNK
14730,"Fanz has apparently closed. Maybe 2-3 weeks ago?\nI can understand why....Not the best sports bar around, mediocre service and OK food.",UNK
14731,"Slow Slow Slow service.   The food was good for me, my husbands filets were tough so he did not like it.  Kids liked their food but waiting 45 for the main course was a big turn off for us.",UNK
14732,"Nice clean bookstore with clean bathrooms.  Stopped by and bought a notebook for my trip.  Standard bookstore.  Older female cashier completed my purchase at the register.  Didn't greet me when I came up to the register, but did say \""have a nice day\"" at the end.",UNK
14733,"Came here for dinner with the wife, the service was great and the burgers were good. I really enjoyed myself here, I will likely return to this restaurant.",UNK
14734,"I went there this weekend.Though the place is smaller and there is only one common washroom(ughh), we really enjoyed the food.we had tandoori chicken,naan,kadai chicken and mango lassi.But i must say the price is a bit high than other places.",UNK
14735,"Food was good, service was NOT!   Waiter walked by several times,  and didn't fill my water.  He had a pot of coffee and didn't offer to top off the cup.. Not impressed at all....",UNK
14736,"Living in Oklahoma, one thing there are plenty of are casinos! This was on the small side in comparison, but was designed nicely. Not a bad place to kill an hour, but would not be somewhere I would spend an evening.",UNK
14737,It was good. It wasn't great though. I guess I should have gone to little italy for great italian food but this place was decent. I think it was a bit overpriced though.,UNK
14738,"The enchiladas were very good!!!!!\n\nService was ok.\n\nchips and salsa were ok, not great.",UNK
14739,"We received an upgrade due to overbooking at the hotel. The suite was aesthetically pleasing. However, the bathroom had a weird sewage smell and the shower water puddled at my feet even after calling maintenance. Everything was nice to look at in the room but definitely not as functional as it should be.",UNK
14740,Blah nothing special carne tacos bland. Was fresh but not much flavor. Chicken burritos same reaction blah fresh but lacking flavor.,UNK
14741,"At 3 a.m. for some reason buying more food than I can eat for under $4 is a good thing.  In the realm of late night eating Taco Bell earns it's three stars for taking credit cards, having armed guards, and coining the euphemism that is \""fourthmeal.\""",UNK
14742,"Yeah I kinda have to agree with the other two reviewers here. It's kinda ok. The atmosphere is not really well thought. The food is okay. I order fillet mignon, it was good. The Caesar salad not so much. It's kinda pricey too.",UNK
14743,This place is run down and seen better days. It almost impossible to find someone on the floor to help you. There wedding section is virtually non-existing and disappointing. I really wish hobby lobby would open on this side of town,UNK
14744,"Personally, I would not pay that much for a hot dog that is not even hot when you get it. My friend bought me lunch there once and though their waffle ice cream was good, as well as their peanut butter one, I won't go back there.",UNK
14745,"Went here today to register a firearm and it is taking a very long time to get done.  Been waiting for over a hour.  Try other sub stations around the city for faster service.  Staff is friendly and professional, however service slow.",UNK
14746,Hostess a sweetheaet...but wait staff not cleaning tables and delaying drink service...a shame because the place has a nice view...wait staff actually nice but its not ok to leave four dirty plates on table when offering buffet style brunch...food quality also subpar,UNK
14747,"I was unimpressed with their measly house \""Ri Ra salmon and spinach salad\"".  I don't even think it was big enough to be a side salad, let alone an entree. Bleh!",UNK
14748,Awkward vibe! Not to friendly customer service either. I waited 10 minutes for just a regular coffee. It's like all the staff had no communication. Food is pretty good.,UNK
14749,"Overpriced food, that wasn't very good. The service was so-so. The really only redeeming quality about this place was the decor. Felt kind of like Pirates of the Caribbean meets Vegas.",UNK
14750,"I absolutely Love Red Lobster.  I will go out of my way to eat at a Red Lobster for shell fish.  Unfortunately, I have never had a good meal at this Red Lobster.  They do not know how to cook seafood.",UNK
14751,"Other then the high prices, I was on the phone for almost an hour to add ONE package! I beg of you to hire employees with some type CUSTOMER SERVICE BACKGROUND!",UNK
14752,Overpriced for what they offer.  $7 for a double scoops of glorified ice cream.  It's not gelato.  I've been to Europe and know what gelato is.,UNK
14753,"it was pretty cheap to fly to las vegas. depending on how many days you book ahead, you can save considerable monies. southwest has easy checkins. a long list of departure times and they leave from oaktown!",UNK
14754,Loud music. More bar than resturant. Shepard pie had large portion and great taste. Food fair priced. Service slow and not responsive. Server appeared more interested in bar customers than table customers.,UNK
14755,"Divebar..where the drinks are cheap.. its in the Phoenix  ghetto , and you can play darts and bar games. Sounds o.k. ..\n\nWouldn't seek this place out.. Wouldn't avoid either\nSome of my friends have before\n\nnuff said",UNK
14756,"music selection was entertaining but my ears got tired very quickly. Either the speaker systems could not handle the volume that the DJ was projecting, or the DJ put the Treble up too much. I was putting my fingers in my ears to block the noise. I looked across the bar, and I wasn't the only one.",UNK
14757,"I had heard a lot about this place, so was excited when I finally got to eat here.  Sadly, I was not impressed.  The salsa was mediocre, and my chimi was soggy and tasteless. The beans were tasteless as well. Will not be going back.",UNK
14758,"The greeters are very friendly and nice as you enter the store. I noticed the different sections of the store are managed by certain people via photos and tags on the isles, but I visited late at night and there weren't many people around. The prices are much higher than online stores like Amazon.",UNK
14759,"Pretty standard cafe faire. They do offer gluten free sweets and a few token vegetarian dishes. If you're already in the neighborhood, the food is tastey. But I would not go out of my way to eat there when there are so many great and 4-5 star restaurants in this valley.",UNK
14760,"This place seemed really cool. Great atmosphere and location.\nOrdered the chicken pad see ew level 3 spicy and I couldn't handle it and I'm Mexican.\n\nCool place, tone it down on spicy though. \n\nWill try again next time",UNK
14761,"The only thing I can add to the other 3 reviews, plan to spend 1 hour to an hour and a half, plenty of time for the candy tour, if it isn't crowded, and the cactus garden.",UNK
14762,"I went with my friend and got boba. However, the boba was disgusting. The middle was hard and outside was soggy. Just by looking at the boba, I could tell it was \""bad.\"" Maybe it was just my drink that one time?",UNK
14763,Customer service here is terrible!  The teenage Asian girl there never has a clue to anything. Please hire someone with more common sense and a better personality and maybe you'll have more happy customers,UNK
14764,"I was hoping for a better experience.  Beer list is slight above average for \""neighborhood\"" bars in Las Vegas.  Food is average:  I've had chicken wings, french toast, and chicken fried steak.  Bartenders were great, wait staff wasn't too friendly.  I might be back for a beer.  Maybe.",UNK
14765,A nice place but they shut down Hachi\nRestaurant. Went to have drinks at a bar that was suppose to be open but didn't have a bartender. It appears management in this place is questionable.,UNK
14766,Disappointed.  The food was not bad but they nickel and dime you for every add on.  Not worth the money.  Cute candy store but very expensive. Had to keep telling the waitress we needed refills.,UNK
14767,"Quite and relaxing for a thursday night, I wasn't there to long enough to have a drink and know that we were all ready to move on to the next place!",UNK
14768,"Perfect for a hot Vegas day. They serve \""island-style\"" shave ice complete with mochi balls, li hing mui, and condensed milk. Most ninth-islanders would appreciate the attempt, it's good but not quite like the shave ice back in Hawaii.",UNK
14769,Maybe you have to come here at night? At lunch it was just OK. The burger was fine bit nothing special and the fries were good. I had heard a ton of hype about this place and it didn't live up to it.\nIn'n'Out for me next time.,UNK
14770,I have been waiting for this place to open up for a while. Anything with cheese can't be bad. I ordered the spicy Mac which was wonderful. It had fresh jalepinos and hot dog. It cost about 8 bucks with a drink. The staff was friendly and I'm sure I will be back to try something else!,UNK
14771,"This is a great college bar. If you're looking to play beer pong, flip cup, etc with friends and get tanked, this is the place you want to be. We have been here before for lunch and the food and service were lacking, so I would only go here to drink",UNK
14772,Great breakfast Bloody Mary at excellent price along with real breakfast combos! Our server Julie was fabulous! Only problem is they can't get eggs over medium right! 2nd try and they keep coming back runny.,UNK
14773,It puts a bad taste in my mouth when the servers are more concerned about the other guest just because they are the same ethnicity..my first couple experiences of this place were great now I don't know if ill come back,UNK
14774,"Three floors, multiple bars, university type crowd, open very late, expensive but hey its a club and centrally located near lots of other night clubs.",UNK
14775,I wondered when was the last time they dust the room. Spending almost $300 a night and i had to dust my bed headboard so that i dont have to sneeze all night. And finger prints all over on the funiture like CSI  came in to investigate.....just disgusting.,UNK
14776,"Seems like a nice place if you just have to have sushi and you don't want to leave the strip. I would not seek this place out though. We had a variety of sushi rolls and none were bad, but neither were any of them great",UNK
14777,This place is overpriced and isn't real Italian. I was shocked by all the 4 and 5 star reviews of Sutti Santi. Don't waste your time here.,UNK
14778,"I've been here a few times and the service and food have always been just so-so.  I do think the drive-thru takes longer than normal to complete your order,  but no major complaints.",UNK
14779,"We have been eating at  Kincaid's for several years. It's a bit pricey but the ambiance and food have always been a decent value. Sadly, though, both the food and service have deteriorated recently to the point that are sorry to say we will not return.",UNK
14780,Was a bummer to see that my hot food was microwaved in front of me.  Aside from that their cold sandwiches and wraps are tasty,UNK
14781,"the portions are generous and the staff is friendly and helpful. but the food is just ok. nothing to write home about. i was really interested in going here for quite sometime, maybe that had something to do with why I thought the food was so bland. I had it built up in my head to be better than it was.",UNK
14782,Pretty good pizza. Thin crust with lots of toppings. I like that the waitress advertised the beer special without me having to ask. I'll be back.,UNK
14783,"Always and busy place. \nThe blonde sisters are great during dueling pianos, the other groups are mediocre. The drink selection lousy dismal and way over priced. All and all, it is a decent dueling piano, no Pat O's.",UNK
14784,"I don't know why it is that all these airports have such a major lack of seating.  The staff here are friendly, and security is quick, but I just wish they'd work on the gate areas and add more seats.  Need an example?  Sacramento International's new terminal.",UNK
14785,I have been here many times and usually the food is pretty good although it is never hot enough for us.  Went yesterday and had the seafood curry in young coconut off the specials menu YUM!!! It was really really good although a little pricey.  Also tried the Mint Duck which was OK.  The fish cakes are always good.,UNK
14786,This McDonalds is no different then any other McDonald's even if it I the rock in roll one. Great place to come if you want to see schwasted people of all\nShapes and sizes:),UNK
14787,"Decent food here but come on, is it really the food you come here for? I like coming here when I have my irish cravings and need a good ol glass of guiness.",UNK
14788,Good food but had to FIND our server every time we needed anything. Unacceptable when you are paying to eat out.,UNK
14789,"The food here is okay, there is nothing in particular that has ever impressed me. Not even anything uniquely bad  but nothing ever sticks out. I have eaten here a couple of times and though the service is good, the food just comes across as bland and boring, almost like everything is pre-packaged or came to the restaurant as frozen.",UNK
14790,"Dennys, whats has happened to you? This visit  turned out to be like other visits to Dennys locations in California. Long waits for food that is warm at best.",UNK
14791,"Beer are good and the atmosphere is excellent, a must see as it's in an old church converted into restaurant & brewery. I was not impressed with the food. The French onion soup was too salty, although the fries were pretty good.",UNK
14792,In the big scheme of things this is just fine food. The joint is a bit scary but the ribs are good and the portions are big. The hot mustard is just packets so not good. The server was not very attentive. Overall just ok.,UNK
14793,"Food was ok, nothing great. Food network would say it needs salt. Worst thing was that they are cash only. Who does that anymore? Even the old lady behind me was digging for quarters.",UNK
14794,It never ceases to amaze me just how UN-impressed I am when I order a pizza from Domino's.  I guess you get what you pay for.  There's a reason this Domino's is consistently ranked in the bottom tier of their franchise stores.,UNK
14795,"Seriously wasn't all that impressed, wasn't GREAT but wasn't the worst I've had. I don't think I'd return.",UNK
14796,"If you are thinking about going here because someone told you it's like Chipotle but better... they lied!! We went at about 8pm the meat looked old, they charge extra for peppers... The freshness you would get from Chipotle was lacking.",UNK
14797,Very gorgeous hotel but restaurants are a little too expensive for a locals place. The shows are good there yellow brick road and steel panther. The pool is great but last Saturday they kicked us out at 4 to host a wedding and rushed us out and I had a tab running.,UNK
14798,"I love the strombolis here they are delicious. The pasta is also very good. The pizza is ok, sort of average for my liking but i've only tried the meat lovers. This is a family owned local business and that says a lot since there aren't many local places on the west valley.  Try it out!",UNK
14799,Subs are pretty decent.  For the price it's pretty awful.   $6 and change for a 5 inch sub is crazy but I will admit my sub was pretty tasty.,UNK
14800,"Renegade has gone under new management since my last review, and the quality of their food is not as good. My family does not go to our local spot any more because of too many mediocre dishes for a steep price.",UNK
14801,"Always liked this place in the past, Vegas and Miami. The other night it missed big time, had the rib eye, $50 steak tasted terrible, the truffle Mac \nand cheese was so so, and the service was fair. Just like Mastro's over priced and not that great. Go to Ruth Chris, it never varies.",UNK
14802,"I don't know about this one, since it's really nothing to it and the truffles and all variety of chocolate was just okay.\n\nNice merchandising and friendly service.",UNK
14803,"We have been here many times and as the previous reviews have stated. The service is lacking in most areas. However there one bright light in this otherwise abismal restaraunt chain. The server Theresa. We will eat there now only if she is our waitress. She understands customer service, and what a patron is looking for when eating out.",UNK
14804,A bit pricey. Portions are rather small but the food is good. The decor is beautiful. The ahi tuna is my favorite. Unfortunately I never had the opportunity to have a cocktail here. :-(,UNK
14805,"I always wanted to try the Rio buffet.  Finally got a chance to go.  The food is not that great, but teppanyaki is the bomb!",UNK
14806,"Hey, what do you know, this place is pretty good! Fixed my hangover real nice like. I don't know what the 777 deal is, but the burger is good. Just don't spend too much time in there, you're in Vegas and Rehab is right outside....get your priorities straight!",UNK
14807,I've been here two times. Both times my pizza was slightly burned in the reheating process. I like my pizza extra crispy but it was definitely overdone. The combination of flavors were good otherwise.,UNK
14808,"Luxor has always been a \""middle of the road\"" hotel.  The price is fair, the rooms are \""ok\"" and the serive is good.  It is a cool hotel in terms of the design.\n\nI would recommend if you are a tourist and don't want to spend a ton o cash.",UNK
14809,"What happened?  Poor service, loud rap music, so-so food and $9.00 glass of wine?  Wow, it must be the Mill Avenue curse.",UNK
14810,"First time staying at a hotel where nobody came to clean the room, and I even told staff today that I was leaving the room, so it was available.  Very poor service, because someone had to know the room wasn't cleaned.  \nNicely appointed room otherwise.  Tomorrow I see if they go two days in a row without room cleaning.",UNK
14811,"Food is great. Especially the smoked salmon appetizer and Thai steak salad. \n\nUnfortunately, tonight (Saturday) I tried to order take out but was told the kitchen was too backed up so call back in an hour. \n\nLooks like I'm eating something else tonight.",UNK
14812,"hostess is nice, server was ehh... Managers way of greeting a table is in a rush and with no smile asking \""How is everything\"" as he is rushing past your table....",UNK
14813,"Really so so with that price range. However, we enjoy the view that we can see people enjoy sun tanning and swimming. However, the bread pudding was pretty good there. Worth to try",UNK
14814,"4 Stars for efficient and polite staff at Blue Chip counter, but the car they gave us was in desperate need of mechanical work.  Needed a wheel alignment and tire balancing.  Drivers mirror glass was broken, and interior could have been a little cleaner.",UNK
14815,"Pretty good. Not impressed with the fancy fries, and it's fairly expensive for what you get. B&G just down the street has in-house ground fresh wonderfulness burgers and it's the same price! And they're a high-end restaurant!",UNK
14816,"This place is different.  When you walk in you expect it to be ultra fancy but it really isn't.  The food was okay, really bland.  I expected it to all taste better.  And unfortunately it took forever for us to receive our food. \n\nI won't be returning.",UNK
14817,"I ordered the personal pizza with onion, garlic and basil. The onion and garlic were both raw. The pizza lacked cheese and sauce. Two days later and I still taste garlic.\n\nWill not return.",UNK
14818,"Very un impressed with the food. The fact that they charged $19 for an average tasting sushi roll is somewhat insulting.  Service was pretty good however, and the only reason for 3 stars.",UNK
14819,"2 stars is high for a biased Texan. It will do in a pinch, might be the best around, and reminds me of home down to the Imperial Sugar.\n\nThe facility is clean & well run.",UNK
14820,"It's a big mall.\nAnchored by Belks...very nice.\nI like the AMC Theater, easy access from outside and inside the mall.",UNK
14821,"I loved the room and hated the service. I had the city corner suite which was lovely but the room service lost our order, they charged me incorrectly at the spa, and they checked us out before we had checked out.",UNK
14822,"Gone down in quality and service.   Mashed potatoes are horrible now. The meat was still just as good as ever, but two stars cause they changed the portion size (but same price). Don't know if I went on bad day. I'll give another chance since I'm such a huge fan but this was sad today.",UNK
14823,"First time at a cicis, not impressed. We paid the extra $8 for their garlic parmasan and buffalo wings...they were not very good, for the quality, they should, have been included in the buffet.  Good place for kids to eat a slice but not much of a selection.",UNK
14824,"Took my mother here for her birthday. I had a burger, fiance had some pasta and mom had a pizza. All the food was very good. Service is slow and un-attendng though.",UNK
14825,I pick up a boba milk tea here and it was really good. The only reason I'm giving 3 stars is because  I ask for no ice and they left a huge gap empty on my cup leaving 25% of my milk tea gone.,UNK
14826,"Second time we ordered delivery.  First time we ordered extra mushrooms and the pizza was good, this time was a pepperoni mushroom and there was nothing on it.  Delivery was fine but the pizza was below average.  There are better places in town.",UNK
14827,"I've been a fan of Napoli for years, but my last 2 pizzas were both underdone - very doughy crust, underdone. We got onion and hot peppers on the pizza, and they were mostly uncooked. Something has changed, and we just got our last pizza here.",UNK
14828,Very decent wine selection. Nice selection of ice wines (one of my main reasons for going to Canada!). The prices aren't bad - way cheaper than the hotel's wines.,UNK
14829,"A chain place. Pretty consistent with every other Qdoba.  However, this location has outstanding customer service. The staff is friendly and always on top of their game. Generally busy establishments near the mall does not usually indicate good service but this place really meets the needs of their customers.",UNK
14830,"The place had a modern feel to it, and the pho is actually pretty good, haven't found better pho elsewhere in the area. In my opinion, there's nothing that makes the restaurant stand out, but overall, a pretty decent place to eat at.",UNK
14831,"One of the best coffee shops in Phoenix, but when the pricks behind the counter tell you they won't make you a doppio over ice, I want to punch them straight in the baby maker. When I'm paying don't tell me what I can and cannot have, I'm boycotting until they get over themselves.",UNK
14832,So many great places right in this area.  This place is a disappointment compared to most of them.  No wonder they sometimes give away random stuff to nice customers (we got cotton candy).  At least the service was good.,UNK
14833,Went here for a family birthday with 9 people. Everyone claimed the ribs are phenomenal. Ours couldn't have tasted any worse. Very tough and hard to bite in to. The only reason I'm giving 3 stars is because our server was very good. This place is overrated and over priced. Far better options now in Scottsdale.,UNK
14834,Must take shuttle to rental car building\nLocation has two counters (you go to first then second)\nService is quick,UNK
14835,"Everything was just mediocre. I've had 100 times better of just the milkshake and hotdog alone. Its great for a quick snack though. I wasn't even close to impressed, well the location is great for me.",UNK
14836,Took 30 min for a to go order. Poor service. Manager didn't seem to care. I would not recommend this establishment.,UNK
14837,Nothing special.  Icing is heavy and there is too much on each cupcake.  The flavor in the chocolate cupcake was good though.  Better than Sprinkles.,UNK
14838,Older theatre but it still does the job! It's got a lot of character to it and sometimes you can see a pretty decent concert there!,UNK
14839,This place was OK. the prime rib was good but not the beat I ever had.  The waitress was cool which almost made this a 4.  Asparagus was not the best. Clam\nChowder is very good.   Lava cake was to die for. We were stuffed and still ate it all.,UNK
14840,Place is pretty busy but my hot and ready was just that so not too shabby. It is still just a five dollar pizza don't expect restaurant quality.,UNK
14841,"Great service, great decor and ambiance, but food was weak.  Wedge salad had undercooked, fatty bacon on top. Roast duck was over-done, not juicy, but skin was rubbery.  Lots of folks do it better than Delmonico, keep looking.",UNK
14842,"Great opening. Hot happy hour, relaxing bar\n\n--tree branch sculpture, varnished wood bar from China\n--hip patio with rebar relief sculpture.\n--six beers on tap\n--ally mcbeal bathrooms \n--awesome happy hour specials, 3-6",UNK
14843,"Ordered chicken club, lots of avocado which I loved. Husband ordered double burger, he liked it but didn't rave about it. Fries were so/so. His golden and crunchy, mine limp and kinda soggy- I'll give it another shot before deciding if I like this place or not.",UNK
14844,"Good venue to watch a show.  I've never gotten seats and always hang out on the lawn.  That's the best place to be.  Also, watching a concert outdoors has that added extra element of atmosphere.  Watch out for HIGH concession prices! OUCH!",UNK
14845,"I was really excited to check this place out by I was sorely disappointed with the service. Being someone who has worked in the service indstry, I get really annoyed when I am not acknowledged and have to wait throughout the night like I did a cadillace ranch. Slow service and average food add up to 2 stars.",UNK
14846,They view and service were absolutely incredible. The food was bland and had no pop. Don't mind spending the money for great food and experience but it definitely was not worth the $500 I spent on the chef tasting for two.,UNK
14847,"Good service, food was okay. It's sort of a tapas-style place, with slightly bigger portions. I'd note the beer selection is good, however.",UNK
14848,Flavorless. Almost no veg options. Bland hot sauce.My husband likes  it so I have to keep going there.,UNK
14849,Fun little local bar for a quick drink or night cap. They have a lot of video poker machines and pool tables. They also serve Roberto's food when it's open.,UNK
14850,I wasn't that impressed. I ordered the Kobe burger and it was mediocre to say the least. I have not returned since.,UNK
14851,As far as airports go... this one does the trick.  I flew on allegiant air and booked the extra shuttle package. Very easy to get to strip with only a few min. drive.,UNK
14852,"The place has gone downhill. Smaller everything and higher prices. Service was prompt and friendly. \nWe came in on Saturday morning. Years ago you would have to wait to be seated, today we walked right in. Go next door to Babystacks.",UNK
14853,"My first Sonoran hot dog.  Overall, good.  I was nearby for a convention, saw it on Yelp and stopped.  I would not necessarily go way out of my way to visit, but if you're nearby, give it a try.  Oh, and the cabeza tacos are also very good.",UNK
14854,"I want to like this place, it's fun but not worth the price. Took my three kids and it was almost $30... No sibling discount. My kids had fun, but really, not worth it. I wouldn't recommend it to others. I was going to do a birthday party, but no way.",UNK
14855,i had fun here.. fun big kid games for me!!!\nO.. But the bartender Melissa was a SUPER bitch and RUDE \nHope they fire her..,UNK
14856,"Their sandwiches are good, but not my favorite. Fries and cole slaw on my sandwich just aren't my style. Always dirty in the store, I don't mind brushing a few crumbs off the table but darn it, clean up a little.",UNK
14857,"Not real sure what happened here, but the service has really gone downhill. The food is still good, but I'd drive the extra 10-minutes and go to Cave Creek.",UNK
14858,Nice hotel for a one night business stay. Very convinent to airport. Walls are paper thin. No WiFi in rooms??!!,UNK
14859,"2.0/5 - Ocean Roll (Tuna/Salmon)\n2.5/5 - Spicy Pork Bowl: Generous portion, good flavor, very spicy, a tad dry.\n4.0/5 - Galbi Beef: succulent flavor and tender",UNK
14860,"Came back recently and their noodle soup bar is not the same anymore.  I think because they had such demand, they couldn't make the broth from scratch anymore.  It tastes like a broth made with bouillon cubes.",UNK
14861,"The night I was there there were way too many sloppy-fall-down-drunks and the crowd looked \""ridden hard and put away wet\"". \n\nIt was like amateur hour at the Roxbury.",UNK
14862,"I don't understand what all the hype is about BT's. Went there once it first opened and the burgers are nothing spectacular which I would expect at a restaurant labeled \""burger joint.\"" Go across the street to Five Guys which has phenomenal and super fresh burgers and fries.",UNK
14863,I made the mistake of going here once for lunch. Blah. The food wasn't good and the service was bad. They seemed to hate me for some reason.,UNK
14864,"Their shrimp dishes are great- but you can get the same meal at any of their locations.  Drinks are average.  Service has always been good, so for that I'd pick this PF Changs over others.  Who am I kidding?  I just love Kierland Commons!",UNK
14865,The place looks exactly like it did before only the food changed and is now mexican cuisine. Average and good food but nothing special. If you want a quick bite to eat this place will do.,UNK
14866,Three huge buildings and three tents with only about 15% occupancy. Mostly home furnishings. But cool ideas.\nThey have a very long way to go to reach the same status as the Dallas World Market or Denver World Marketplace.,UNK
14867,I had the tuna tar tare and it was not that good they put a little bit of tuna and a gigantic amount of guac on it not to mention it was pretty tasteless,UNK
14868,"Doesn't offer free wifi, which in my book is a sin in 2013. Full disclosure, my requirements for a room aren't high. Many times I've stayed at a Best Western for the free wifi over more expensive alternatives. The resort is comfortable though. Nice location.",UNK
14869,"HORRIBLE FOOD. My chicken sandwich tasted like rubber, the curly fries weren't cooked enough, and the wings were mediocre. \n\nStop supporting horrible chains like this and they will all go away.",UNK
14870,"Service and cleanliness and such were okay, but the food was mediocre compared to other places in town and it was expensive for the low quality and taste they offer. Their BBQ to go for the duck and pork are much better, but this isn't a good dine in place.",UNK
14871,This place was great for the Wildcard NFL Sunday!  So many t.v.'s and seating areas.\n\nHowever the waitresses are hit or miss.,UNK
14872,Shite!! I do need to be more sober  to explain but basically the waitress is super rude and trying to kick if out7! How rude we just spent 120 bucks lady!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nTo be updated!!!!!!!!!!,UNK
14873,"Since Chef Jet Tila opened this shaved snow place I expected amazing coming from him.  We came in excited but left disappointed.  The green tea snow had no flavor!  It was lacking and not satisfying.  I don't think we will ever come back.  Service was really good though, but that's about it.",UNK

14878,"Coffee is good here, not amazing. Everyone here is super super nice. Definitely worth coming in to support a local shop!",UNK
14879,2nd time I've come here after 6pm..just needed to exchange an item for different size.. Twice now I have to wait 20min because they only have one person  working customer service. There were couple guys behind desk not acknowledging people in line. We all felt ignored. Poor customer service.,UNK
14880,The waitress was excellent but the food can be better. Salty.... on every dishs and they gave me tap water no filter at all.,UNK
14881,"It's not bad.  Not the best pizza in town.  It is good in a pinch and I would recommend if you are in the area.  I would not really go out of my way for it though, to be honest.  The staff was friendly enough.",UNK
14882,This place is pretty fun and there is lots of food at a decent price.  There's lots of neat stores including Hershey's! The music is pretty good. This place is good for a gambler on a budget (foodwise).,UNK
14883,Apparently they are in the process of remodeling but I was very sad to see that they will no longer have the kids tubes and slide. This Chuck E Cheese is the closest to our home and I'd have to say it's one of the smallest locations we've ever been to.,UNK
14884,"Food was just ok, was with 3 other people.  On the burgers; buns not fresh, need more flavor.  Fries were blah, although friends said the sweet potato fries were good.  Service was mediocre, and the place was dirty, and this was a regular Thursday night, so it not slammed with people at all.",UNK
14885,"Food has gotten better! The curries are better, I'm not sure if they got someone new in the kitchen or just started to get better ingredients. I tried it out a few weeks ago and it's considerably better! Good job!",UNK
14886,"Not sure why people like this place so much. The dishes seem to all come with the same brown sauce (except curry), which seems lazy to me. The servers are always rushing around and the place seems understaffed. I've eaten lots of thai food and this place is less then memorable.",UNK
14887,I went here with no reservation and they took me on however is little bit pricey and the level of nail game is not up to par. They gave me a discount using check in and still came out to $95,UNK
14888,"I like the food here very much, always have. I also believe they have the best Margaritas in town. Its the service that is remarkably below average. I should try visiting them during non-peak hours, perhaps the service would improve then.",UNK
14889,Love the park and the trails. They need to get the leash policy better enforced though. I'll avoid this place until they enforce the leash policy.,UNK
14890,They used to be good but lately are over cooking everything. Wings are very dry.  Service is great but too expensive for the type of eatery that it is.,UNK
14891,The desserts are decent but a bit overpriced at times and the coffee is kind of bitter. It's a good place to hang out with free wi-fi but it is always busy and a bit noisy.,UNK
14892,"got 2 free   dinner buffet from playing on myvegas.com . expected better food . most things I tried , didn't taste good . the only good thing was the made to order pasta station. dinner was 34.99 $  mon- thur",UNK
14893,"It was alright. The chocolate shake was pretty good. The burger was average tasting, but you can tell that the ingredients are very fresh. The staff were nice and everything. It just didn't live up to the hype.",UNK
14894,I don't know how they managed to serve me a cold burrito but that just happened. Also 70 cents cheaper than in San Diego.,UNK
14895,I learned that eating here at night except saturday night is a different taste. I will only eat here for lunch and saturday night because of the cook.,UNK
14896,Nice place and a good staff. But the food prep falls short. My scallops we're on the overdone side. Kumumotos were a bit skinny. \n\nI'll go back another night. May have just been a tad off.,UNK
14897,"In a word: forgettable. This is AZ, you can get better mexican fare on any corner. Largely bland and uncreative, food was just ok. Service was good, food was more than it was worth.",UNK
14898,Good Price\n\nI cam here for a breakfast buffet and it was pretty good\nThe selection was pretty good and would come back....,UNK
14899,"Disappointing.  Too many selections that don\""t belong in a Chinese Buffet.  Food is barely passable and is poorly seasoned.  Too bad.",UNK
14900,Bone in ribeye very poor quality and overcooked     Poor example of a Flemings \nServer did a good job   Manager was poor at his job \n\nI Would recommend any other steak house,UNK
14901,"Its not the best, but it's the closest. Two things that are consistent are the bbq skewers and crispy pata. Everything is either oily, too salty or rice is soggy.",UNK
14902,"Very chic spot. But too expensive for the service. I got a pedicure there and they didn't even do the basics. Don't recommend, paying $60 for what would cost $25-$30.",UNK
14903,"It was like a real outdoor bbq, complete with flies everywhere. Only problem, we were sitting inside! Gross. Food was okay but I was too grossed out by the flies. Won't return. Doubt this place will last.",UNK
14904,"Very disappointing experience. Rooms are stark, with a few James Bond photos to seemingly make them feel \""hip.\"" Service is at best, indifferent. Really underperformed the hype. The restaurant has a pedestrian menu. Lot's of improvement needed to justify 4 star prices.",UNK
14905,"The service was extremely unprofessional and our order was missing several items. The food quality was still good, but no one seemed to know what they were doing.",UNK
14906,I would normally give this restaurant 4-stars but the service that me and my friend reviewed was not the greatest. She was just chit chatting for about 10 minutes with a coworker while we were waiting for our checks. The wings were very good though.,UNK
14907,"OK place but had better.\nSteak was OK although for the price i was expecting better.\nwe were seated on a table and the seats were small.\nNo parking, had to drive around till i found a ramp (with pay meters) not too far.",UNK
14908,Javier's in California gets 5 stars! I'm new to Vegas and really miss it but this one wasn't the same. I will try it again some day. I'm glad the chips and salsa are the same.,UNK
14909,"If I absolutely MUST eat fast food, I choose BK because they carry a veggie burger (vegan if you hold the mayo). Their fries are also vegan and fried separately from the meat products :)",UNK
14910,Middle-of-the-road sushi joint.  I'd recommend going here during happy hour so you can get decent prices.  Service was very friendly and helpful despite what many others have said.,UNK
14911,"nice selection of fixtures, but once they have your money don't expect to get any service.  they didn't  return several phone call or emails.  When you do finally get them on the phone after placing several calls they promise to get back to you but they don't.",UNK
14912,"The food is pretty good for a coffee shop. The amenities is lacking, we got our food but we had to wait for the silverware.  We had to ask for condiments and plates which took a while. The server looks like he's walking on sand that's how slow he was. Never again not worth it.",UNK
14913,"You know the saying, \""You get what you paid for\""? Well, that's just it. Not the best quality. Their meats were dry, vegetables and other platters were over cooked and some looked like they were sitting out for a while.",UNK
14914,"I have heard negative reviews about the staff, but in my experience they have always been really nice. What I don't like about this salon is the bathroom is all the way downstairs, there aren't many mirrors, and the beds aren't that great. It is convenient for college students.",UNK
14915,Service was good but the food did not have any wow factor..to be honest I could have saved money and had Roberto's for a better time..tacos el Gordo is a far better taco spot for sure!,UNK
14916,"Ate lunch there today, and was pretty happy with the food and service.  Pleasant atmosphere, and because of the large windows,  it felt open and airy.  The pies are yummy and fresh.",UNK
14917,"I like the over-all atmosphere of the Sierra Gold bars and the food at all of them is pretty good.  My favorite is the Soup.  Rice, carrots, celery, straw mushrooms, bell pepper, and meatballs in a rich chicken broth!  Comfort and goodness!  The service is nice and attentive.",UNK
14918,I do find myself still coming here time to time. The patio is beautiful but they still havent invested the money into the inside to update it. It's dark and dirty. The prices are similar to uptown but the service and atmosphere dont even come close to matching. Parking is always difficult. The food is really good for pub food.,UNK
14919,Average at best.. I had the Kung Pow Chicken and it was flooded with too much sauce. The sweet and sour soup was alright. Prices are very reasonable though. Nothing spectacular.,UNK
14920,"I ate \""The Bobbie\"" which the girl said was their most popular. Well I guess I'm not a conformist excuse it was a fairly bland sandwich that basically just takes like canned shredded turkey and chewy bread.\n\nNot a fan.",UNK
14921,"I wanted to like it.... but after $20 for two sundaes and a rip-roaring case of heartburn, I'll pass. Gah!",UNK
14922,"it was Ok, the meat lack some salt or some magic spice (like other places). The place looks kinda crappy but attention is ok. Still I think I'll stick to my carl's...more juicy and tasty",UNK
14923,"We had BBQ from Mac's for the super-bowl party, take out.  It was excellent, very lean and both pork and beef were quite nicely done.  We used our own sauces, so can't rate the sauces well enough to add that opinion.",UNK
14924,I really wasn't impressed with my sandwich. They don't put enough meat on it.  The taste was ok but I mainly tasted bread.  For the price of the sandwich I'm better off going to subway.,UNK
14925,Nothing to write home about. I ate there tonight and was not impressed. Mostly locals with their hoochie mammas getting ready to go out on a Friday night. Not sure if it is even worth a second try...,UNK
14926,"The food here is very bland, nothing special. But it'll have to do as there aren't very many veggie places in Vegas (as expected).",UNK
14927,This place is clean and new. I agree with other reviewers that it doesn't smell like feet and the overall appearance is very nice. The price is a bit high though even with a military discount. Was disappointed in the toddler area. Need more than just trampolines to keep a 3 yr old occupied. Overall it was ok.,UNK
14928,"I had not been here since they remodled and it looks fantastic, movesld it to a shopping destination of the twentieth century. Only problem is when it is crowded it is REALLY crowded and the isles get a little tight with the vendors down the middle, otherwise happy shopping!",UNK
14929,"Cute atmospehere. Jerky app was good. Duck curry wad decent as well. I had the combination soup, which tasted like someone had spilt cinnamon in it. Not worth the drive. Cool that it has a full bar. Bass from the music was too strong.",UNK
14930,"Slow service, tables and floors not clean, coffee really old in the carafe, and soft drink dispensers spray you with some of the flavors.  Food was just ok, and that usual mistake of making your food to go instead of dine-in even though you clearly said dine in.",UNK
14931,"Great Filipino food,all you can eat Adobo...Chicken,Beef,Pork got ur Pancit behon,Pancit palabok,and soups",UNK
14932,Food was just okay. They serve dinner on serving platters which is way too much food. Waiter was obnoxious and became extremely annoying as the evening went on. Felt like he was rushing us and just wanted us to pay the bill and leave. Not sure we will go back.,UNK
14933,"This place is always crowded and they have the over stock in the way which makes the crowded place harder to move around in. And the vegetables are NOT fresh!! The staff doesn't know how to put up an \""out of stock\"" sign when they run out of whole milk!",UNK
14934,"MehBQ. Abysmal service. Would have been a total bust but for the Mac & Cheese side and cornbread. But probably the worst, driest, most overpriced pulled pork sandwich I've had in the Valley. I won't be going back.",UNK
14935,"I had high hopes for this place since its really close to where we live, but sadly I won't be returning. I've never had a worse pink and white fill, the guy seemed to have no idea what he was doing. I've already had one nail break less then two days after my visit :(",UNK
14936,"the outdoor seating was nice.  margaritas were pretty good.  food was not good at all.  So if you want to hang out on state street and have a drink, it's nice.  If you want good food, go somewhere else.",UNK
14937,We stayed there this weekend and the room was nice. We had a good time and love the Elvis memorabilia. I know next month there is an Elvis event which should be good.,UNK
14938,It's a decent pub but doesn't stand out from the crowd in that area. It does have a huge selection of single malt whisky and the bar staff know their stuff about the products and are willing to spend time with customers to make recommendations.,UNK
14939,"Food was good service was bad. The hostess and our waitress were not friendly at all. I regret giving our waitress a big tip since her service sucked, but im a firm believer  in Karma and since I live mostly on tips I always feel the urge to always tip 20%.",UNK
14940,"I usually love this place, but I just ordered 20 wings and not only did it take way longer than I was told, but there are 20 drumsticks and that's it. All drumsticks! Who does that!?",UNK
14941,I like this airport as it is simple- normally that is!!! My shuttle dropped me at the wrong terminal and i had to ask 3 different staff members to get to my destination.\nAfter this a member of staff after getting through security was rude to me for now reason!!!! A joke!,UNK
14942,This restaurant is not very good. Got the lasagne and it was one of the worst I have tasted. Had eggs inside and the meat felt processed,UNK
14943,I like coming here to get my haircut. The prices are good and it's never too crowded. I like when Kim cuts my hair she always does a good job. I have had my haircut by others in her shop and just didn't like it. So if she's not available I'll try back another time.,UNK
14944,Not a dive bar by far but cute. Some really great bikes hanging esp the Orange richie.$2 pbr. No complaints.,UNK
14945,"For a membership only place, this place was very sub par. The food was something I would expect from a local dive bar, not a country club.\n\nThe only redeeming factor is the view of the course/camelback and the strong drinks from a limited bar.",UNK
14946,"The food is really, really good but the service is horrifically slow.  If you are golfing or live in the community it is well worth the wait if you have a few days to spare.",UNK
14947,"Service was good. Food average but overpriced. The pizza was not tasty and exciting and the side spinach tasted like it had too much flower. The shrimp diavolo was ok and Mac and Cheese was sweet, thick and blend. Would not go back.",UNK
14948,We checked out this hole in the wall after staying at a nearby resort just because of yelpers. It was good. We weren't overly impressed and never made our way back but it is worth checking out if you're in the area and want a fast food feel but more authentic mexican.,UNK
14949,"Third visit here... No real improvement.  Sticky floors and tables, slow service and bland food.  \n\nPositive:  the sangria is yummy !",UNK
14950,I did not enjoy my massage here. The lady was way too rough and it was just so painful from beginning to end. \n\nMy boyfriend said his was ok.\n\nThe really annoying thing too is that the ladies kept talking to each other so it was really hard to relax when they were talking loudly the entire time.,UNK
14951,This use to be my favorite place for a happy hour.  However - recently they changed the menu and I was disappointed.  Higher prices for drinks and they eliminated the Tapanakki from the happy hour!  That is a huge loss and will cause me not to frequent as much.,UNK
14952,"You really can't expect much, 24 hour pho place in Vegas..\n\nThere's always a line and when they tell you 10 minutes, they really mean 20. I guess you really can't complain about Asian places...",UNK
14953,"The room was nice but NO FREE WiFi and you are charged for everything under the sun. \nNext time for sure staying on the strip, Free WiFi and your given gifts for staying, not charged for everything.",UNK
14954,Went here with a group of 9 and after getting sat we just ordered waters since we weren't given a drink menu and then literally waited for 20 minutes just to put our order in. Our server wasn't around the entire time and we were contemplating whether we should leave or stay. \nThe food was just okay.,UNK
14955,The burger and fries are nothing special....but not bad.  Be prepared for patties cooked in old grease.  The fries taste like frozen pre-packaged from sams club.\n\nParking is scarce.,UNK
14956,"Great food, but on a Sunday afternoon it was extraordinarily slow. We waited almost 2 hours for our food. There was one person working the front and one person cooking.",UNK
14957,Food was decent and service was good.  We were the only people in the restaurant for dinner which was a bit odd.  I would eat here again if I were in the area but would not go out of my way to eat here.,UNK
14958,"Ummm - no, I don't think I will be returning. I should have read the Yelp reviews before coming in. The food is bland, absolutely not taste whatsoever. I actually asked for it to be spicey and still got no taste. Go figure.",UNK
14959,"A little disappointed they didn't have a chicken gyro, but the chicken pita was pretty good. I enjoyed the creamy flavor of the taziki sauce and the oregano infused salad dressing. Side salad was nice and fresh. It wasn't the best Greek food but it was good.",UNK
14960,"Came here with a local after needing a change of scene in Vegas.   It was still prop-ish but atleast you did not feel overwhelmed with so many people like in the hotels.  Food was decent, not the greatest just somewhat different and there was live band.  Not really some where I would come to Vegas for.",UNK
14961,"Maybe I'm getting old but this was not for me. The music is a mix of hip hop and electronic which is okay. It's a typical vegas price (you get in free if you buy a drink, oh and the drink is 20 bucks! grr). Eh, just not my cup o tea!",UNK
14962,Horrible service. We received our milk shakes melted after waiting 35 minutes for them. We also ordered fries but never received them and waited another 25 to get our check. Milk shakes we're okay but not great for the bad service.,UNK
14963,Not such a bad place. It has a reputation in some quarters as a sort of Mecca. You'll get good prices on decent Mexican in totally unpretentious surroundings. Not really Mecca,UNK
14964,"Small portions, terribly overpriced. The quality was passable but nothing great. For the price you can hop a cab to chinatown and get way better food. Even with return cab fare you'd be ahead.",UNK
14965,"Landmark is definitely a favorite place of mine the service is good the food is plentiful and the prices are low, it's not a super fancy place but a good old fashioned diner..",UNK
14966,"Tried to like it. Steak was way too salty. They tried to fix it, but the next steak came out way over done. Chocolate cake looked good.",UNK
14967,"Nice place to go to celebrate an occasion.  This place can accommodate big groups of people.  The place is loud and not so romantic, so not ideal for a date.  Food is decent.  I expected more for the prices they charge.",UNK
14968,I thought this bagel shop was ok. The bagel sandwich I got was relatively lackluster. I think I will stick to Einsteins for the time being.,UNK
14969,"Cheap, old, dirty. The only reason I am giving it two stars is because of the location. But you get what you pay for. The pool was nice and I recommend renting a cabana for the day. The beds were hard and uncomfortable but tower II is probably the easiest as far as in and out goes.",UNK
14970,Food is not the best but was okay.  We ordered rice bowl with steak and they didn't mention about the extra cost for steak meat.  They don't give you a lot of fries so the extra 2.99 was not worth it. I feel like I paid more for drinks then fires.,UNK
14971,"As an earlier reviewer said... this bar is something of an anomaly on William Street: you'd expect warmth and welcome but they weren't there today. Surly staff, cursing customers and a reduced range of drinks. There's plenty of character on W Street, but it wasn't to be found here, not today.",UNK
14972,"Good location, and prices are really reasonable for Vegas. The service was great and professional. The food was OK--the pizza and the bruschetta were just fine. The sangria was good.",UNK
14973,"Happy hours prices are VERY good, but sit at the bar.  I don't know if my waiter was new or what but service was very slow.  Never came by to check if we needed more drinks.  Only stayed for one round and appetizers.  Food was pretty bland but cheap.  Probably won't be back.",UNK
14974,"Service was very slow. Waitress was very pushy trying to pickup our food while we were still eating! Food was very basic and no signature dish to bring me back. I see others rating this much higher so I may take another look, but with do many good restaurants out there I am not in a hurry.",UNK
14975,Age old burger no-nos.  Bun way bigger than the burger.  Too fat so it was burnt on the outside.  Too fancy for its own good. A real Gut Bomb.  Bread Pudding was runny and burnt.  Waitress was nice.,UNK
14976,"A group of us went here for lunch. The food was average. Not yucky, but not memorable either. Everyone had the same feeling towards their dish.",UNK
14977,Ordered some beer mugs and they only had one of the four made up when I arrived.  I had to come back the next day for the other three.,UNK
14978,"I think this is the most expensive in Wickenburg for breakfast.  2 people normal meal; eggs, bacon, hash browns and toast $25.  Go to Cowboy Cafe - service is slow as molasses but same food for $15.",UNK
14979,"Well here again not much has changed. Brisket is really fatty, 4 out of the 5 ribs are good. Last one was all gristle. Salad was rubbery and the side where ok. \n\nOh well",UNK
14980,I love going to Chompies but I am seriously disappointed. Your egg sandwiches are usually too big to eat but now you barely put  any egg on them! You all need to stop being so stingy with your food and start serving us the right amount of food for our money. I spent $6 on this and it's just sad...,UNK
14981,"Ordered the padthai and it was meh.  It's pretty bland and boring compared to most Thai food place.\n\nAlso, the fountain soda was stale and doesn't have free refill.  Not recommended.",UNK
14982,"The kale salad with chicken was disappointing. It's a pile of shaved kale without much else. The chicken is tasty, but there isn't much on there. All things considered, I think the food is overpriced. I wouldn't recommend it to a friend.",UNK
14983,This rating is quite unfair since i came on a thursday night. we got in free. the music was meh. the people were meh. nobody fun enough to dance with. we left for a fat tuesday. thats how much fun we had.,UNK
14984,"Cute little cafe! Very whimsical decor. Server was friendly and attentive, food was good and coffee was great. Would love to try more items from their menu.",UNK
14985,"Friendly waitress, blah food. This is a dive joint that needs the awesome food to keep it going of course, I went there for breakfast. Bad coffee",UNK
14986,"If you're looking for Hawaiian fast food, that's it.  It reminds me of the mall kiosk back home kind of fast food.",UNK
14987,I thought this nice newer location would be just as good as the original location in Gastonia but I left disappointed.   The food had a different taste and I didn't care for it.  This location is very nice and upscale looking but I'll stick there the less attractive Gastonia location.,UNK
14988,"I'll spare you the details but the service was less than subpar and I even gave it a second shot, got the same waiter... And he still operated as if he was in his first day of training. Long story short. Good sushi, cramped environment and service that was seriously lacking.",UNK
14989,"Had the Pho Tai there.  Service wasn't bad, but the food was overpriced and medicore.  You're better off going somewhere else nearby like Khai Hoan or Pho Thanh.",UNK
14990,"We occasionally find ourselves going through Florence. My wife loves their fresh baked breads and I find their pizza is really pretty good. We've been there three times and the service has been pretty slow, but not bad for a small family business.",UNK
14991,now in Tempe Enterprize one of my friends rented a Nissan LEAF for 2 weeks. You have to ask and hope you get the person who can connect you up.\nMaybe the Tesla will be available for renting some day.,UNK
14992,"not sure why people love this place. It is unique but not chic, more bohemian or punk i think...if u r into Italian designers, this is not ur place",UNK
14993,"Yah for good donuts.. Coffee, not so much, lol. . . But it's such a cute mom and pops shop you can't help but not mind the diluted coffee. ^__^ anywhoo, they have nice prices and good donuts. Recommend for a quick stop.",UNK
14994,"The food tastes good, but over the 20 times I've been here, the service is lacking and I've seen cleaner bathrooms at coachella.",UNK
14995,"A bit overrated if you ask me. Don't get me wrong, it's good, but Natt Spill has brick oven pizza that is just as good if you ask me, especially for the price.",UNK
14996,"Waitress was miserable to deal with, very curt without any provocation. Not the best service, too bad, that is very important to me! Food was just okay, she didnt bring me what I ordered, but I didnt feel like putting up a fight in front of my elderly family during lunch.  Probably wont go again",UNK
14997,"Sat on patio, tables and chairs way to close. Wait stuff was good but sushi was inconsistent, ie pieces not same size. Rice wasn't wrapped all the way around rolls. Salmon seemed old.",UNK
14998,The pad kee mow was awesome! The country curry was bland and tasteless.\n\nFor the price there should've been a much larger size of the pad kee mow.,UNK
14999,Take a friend and split an entree.  I had a loaf of bread on my French toast entree.  It was pretty good but it seemed a bit dry.  I guess there's no easy way to batter a loaf of bread.,UNK
15000,I was disappointed the very last time I went here. And it made my guts feel funny =[ not cool...thank goodness it was not a date.,UNK
15001,Eve is very pretty and I like the set up.  I would consider it more of a lounge like Blush then a club.  Although at least at Blush you can sit without VIP.  They played decent music and I like the video screens.   It didn't impress me enough to make me want to go back though.,UNK
15002,Ill stick with applebees!  They didn't have the table ready by our reservation time...food was nothing special...  Hostesses Courtney and Stephanie screwed up our reservation!!!  Our server Alan was great though and fun!!!  I give him 5 stars!!!,UNK
15003,We walked around and chilled at one of the bar/lounge. The hotel is one of the newer ones and is very contemporary. There are a bunch of interesting designs. P.S. Parking is a tad confusing.,UNK
15004,"Crowded, did not have enough seating or parking. Qdoba down the street has way more menu options and much nicer staff. Over all not impressed with Chipotle.",UNK
15005,"Pretty decent food, popular with the older community. Service is hit and miss. Not a fan of the salsa, very tomatoey not enough kick.",UNK
15006,"We ended up leaving the show early. As much as we appreciated his enthusiasm, his humor is geared towards an older audience. I would only recommend this show if you are over 45 and enjoy potty humor. I don't mean blue, I mean middle school humor.",UNK
15007,One of my favorite traditional (more NY style) Italian food here in AZ.  A total joint just like a mom and pop pizza place in NY.  My son's absolutely favorite place.  Service always very good.,UNK
15008,"I don't understand why people love it so much, I think they're just like a sandwich you could make in 2 minutes at your house.  I guess it's cheap semi-healthy fastfood, just not for me.",UNK
15009,"Employees friendly, but do a terrible job cleaning. I rather deal with the long waiting at Fabulous Freddy across the street.",UNK
15010,"Coffee coco rub was outstanding. \nService was OK.  \nDining room was loud, no background music- tables so close you feel like you can't have a private conversation.",UNK
15011,"The outdoor second-level deck at this Hooters is a surprisingly nice place to sit with a cold beer. There are plenty of TVs, and the girls were attentive but not intentionally overbearing as at other Hooters. The food still sucks though.",UNK
15012,Greatest prices for buffet on the strip and the food is not bad either...comparable to a place that charges you twice as much.  Well I came here one time with coupons and it was an Easter Brunch so maybe they stepped it up with the food quality but I got no complaints.,UNK
15013,This place looks really nice inside. I was surprised when the food was mediocre. My husband and I sampled quite a lot too. We heard good things about this place so we were truly disappointed.,UNK
15014,"Maybe I just don't get it, but I really don't think this is the greatest pizza in the world. Not even top 5. It's good stuff and I support local businesses so I'd visit again, but it's not my top choice.",UNK
15015,Good drinks with some run of the mill tapas. Nothing was innovative which I don't mind since it wasn't to expensive. My food taste a little burnt which is what cost it the fourth star. Overall it's worth trying and you may like it better than I did.,UNK
15016,"I wouldn't stay here if it wasn't for Rehab Sundays at the pool.\n\nRooms are mediocre compared to other Hard Rock locations. The location isn't too bad for being off the strip (near City Center, but east of Las Vegas Blvd).",UNK
15017,"I can now say I've waited 25 minutes in a drive thru line... The food was decent, definitely made fresh as it was hot when I got it... but the fact that there was a small child running around the kitchen was a bit unnerving. Overall not worth the wait...",UNK
15018,"The bussers are better than the server and that says a lot considering there are only four tables seated in this joint. I am giving a two star because the sangria is awesome and only $2, however, the service is lacking. I'm fairly positive that my server is high. Plus who wears a limp Mohawk to work!!",UNK
15019,"Taste wise I love del taco, and maybe it was just this particular one not sure, but there food made me incredibly sick after eating it.",UNK
15020,I went here on a Sunday night...so glad I didn't have to pay to get in...we stayed long enough to have one $8 bud light....it was a HUGE sausage fest!!!\n\nI'll give it 2 stars for good music!!,UNK
15021,"I wasn't impressed. I went at 7:00 p.m. on a Saturday to a seafood buffet and they were all out of fresh shrimp. Unacceptable! \n\nI did like their mini dessert tarts and muffins, they were pretty good.",UNK
15022,"It's alright.  I  mean it's entertaining but at the same time, it's not flashy Vegas luxurious type of show.  For me, I had a livingsocial deal $56 for 2 so it was worth it.",UNK
15023,great niche.  People go in cuz of the awesome birthday deal.  Minus that it's pretty much just there.  Food's decent.,UNK
15024,I run by for a slice here about once a week but I need to stop that. I just do not think it should take more than 5 minutes and it usually takes closer to 10! (Even when they are not busy.) I am never disappointed when I stay and get a table but sometimes I don't have time for that.,UNK
15025,"A typical diner food with a desert feel. Okay, doesn't feel like the desert, but does the job. Not that expensive and has enough selection for what you might be looking for if you end up in this place. About $7-10 a plate.",UNK
15026,"For the same price, the M buffet is a lot better.\nNo alcohol include. Small selection. Cutting the prim rib was like cutting grandma's meatloaf. For that price, I wanted more.",UNK
15027,"Steak tasted like chewy rubber, had to wait forever to get water, games are over priced. Really feel like there is no organization, I only go here when forced or because its on someone else's tab.",UNK
15028,"Came here for some fast food Italian and got lasagna, grilled potatoes, bread stick, and a drink for 16 bucks. Taters and bread sticks were good but the pasta was way too salty and cold. Definitely not coming back...",UNK
15029,"Took way too long.  We waited over an hour for our food- the fryer broke then some how our food got mixed up.  We watched quite a few people arrive, eat and leave even before we had food!!",UNK
15030,"I really wanted to like this place, as I miss dim sum.  Unfortunately, if this is the best Phoenix can do, then I just won't be having dim sum in the Valley.  Just wasn't that good.",UNK
15031,"Ethan is definitely not the best asian in the city - by any stretch of the imagination - but their congee is pretty darn good and they happen to be one of the rare spots in Mtl that make it. So if ever congee is what you're in the mood for, Ethan's the place for you!",UNK
15032,"The place is really nasty, dirty baseboard with sticky food, dirty chairs and sticky too. Toilet is small, dull and dirty. I don't think I will ever come back here. Service is slow and hardly understand the cashier lady, language problem. And too darn hot in here.",UNK
15033,"Wow rudest staff ever, place seemed pretty nice but the lady who \""greeted\"" us was so rude we left shortly after we walked in",UNK
15034,This place was much better when it first opened a long time ago.  Now its overpriced and disgusting.  Today was the last time you will see me here......  I know that most of the employees are young but NONE of them want to help you out...,UNK
15035,"RA's Happy Hour is the best thing about the sushi restaurant... Their Vegas Roll is to die for, but their non-happy hour prices are very expensive. This is not the greatest sushi restaurant in Vegas, but not bad for the Strip. The decor is nice and their service can really be hit or miss.",UNK
15036,"Well I'm expecting more variety like lobster,tempura etc.Food taste good.but way to expensive for the price!!'",UNK
15037,"Not impressed with the chicken sandwich I got. Not well made at all with poor flavor. Friend enjoyed their meal so may be back to try something different. Service was quick, picked up an order to go.",UNK
15038,Would not go back.  Terrible service and the food was mediocre.  Too bad because the location and atmosphere are really cool and the desert ridge area could use more cool places like this.  There are other much stronger options in city north to choose.,UNK
15039,"I ordered my steak medium rare, it lacked flavor and was overcooked. The service was good though. So if you're a fan of good service and sub par food give it a shot.",UNK
15040,"This is the bar where you walk in with $25 bucks and walk out not remembering the night. A true classic dive bar! Good times, which is usually based on who you are with.",UNK
15041,This is an okay place. I've had way better hot dogs before. The hot dog itself was a joke (so thin and small). I specifically said no mustard and yet they still put it on there which ruined the taste for me. The main thing I enjoyed were the French fries.,UNK
15042,"The service here sucks basketball sized balls! 30 minutes to get a server to my table, 30 to get my burger to the table. Should've gone to the Waffle House",UNK
15043,"The variety of beer and portion sizes are great, I really liked my salad, however the service is NOT. My order was forgotten twice and then not excluded from the bill. Second time's the charm to get me to not go back to this particular location.",UNK
15044,Pretty decent place to see overrated Euro-pansies get bounced out of the second round of the playoffs.\n\nICE BURN,UNK
15045,"Te coastal credit union doesn't exist anymore, i had lost my credit card from the michigan state fcu and needed to cash a check, the new bank at this location is NOT part of the credit union consortium, and i ran out of gas in my car because they wouldn't cash my check.",UNK
15046,"Very disappointed. American Chinese food, not authentic at all. Also I am not sure why one of the dishes had some really weird smell , not fresh....",UNK
15047,"Tried their ranchero breakfast burrito today, not a fan. I'll stick to the bean and cheese because I know I like that.",UNK
15048,I ready about this place and had great reviews. The items I wanted were sold out. It was hot and dirty inside. Food was so so but nothing to go crazy about.,UNK
15049,You can play games here. It's a fun place to hang out while you eat dessert after eating at Cherry Blossom Cafe next door.\n\nIt definitely has some good flavors! Try it! I didn't see a lion dancer in the store. They should have one on request. That would be awesome.,UNK
15050,"I stopped in here yesterday for a quick bite to eat.  I was surprised at how many people were here on a Thursday morning!  Quite a line.\n\nI got a bagel with cream cheese, and it was yummy.  I had a very positive experience here considering it was Einsteins!",UNK
15051,"I was there because the bouncer from Tao gave me & my girls VIP tickets with complementary drinks so it's like why not, lets go check it out. The place is pretty small, & crowded, The crowd mostly 30+ we were there for less than an hour and left. I just wasn't having fun there. =(",UNK
15052,The Pizza was cold and stale. Definitely not worth 6 bucks. That was my first and last time taking my family their.  The place was clean and the workers are nice but the food was just unbearable.,UNK
15053,"Oishii has some pretty good food for reasonable prices. I always liked the teryaki bowl, but I have tried the Oishii roll, which is really good, too.",UNK
15054,"Good Mexican food, but it is like sitting in a basement (no windows, no ambiance).  Food is solid though.  I would go back if I was in the area, but would not make a special trip.",UNK
15055,It's a nice addition to downtown wait staff is dicey at best.  Weird happy hour times. Blue martini goes till 7 and commonwealth goes till 9 pm.  Downtown cocktail room goes till 7 to.  There happy hr ends at 6 pm.  Hello!! Give it a one and done.,UNK
15056,Delicious but way over priced and extremely hipster. I'd been hearing great things and put up with over an hour wait to eat here. I still recommend but I'd try to go at a slightly off time.,UNK
15057,"I ordered the French toast plate.  It came with egg, bacon, and fruit.  Everything was decent.  Nothing spectacular.  Didn't taste any different than Denny's.",UNK
15058,"After expressing my dissatisfaction with my previous experience, we were able to come to an agreement about my bill that made me appreciate their willingness to be flexible. So I'll upgrade my review. That's fair.",UNK
15059,"Was there 2 nights ago.  Weird garbage smell around the desert area.  Food was sitting outside way too long.  If this wasn't in the Bellagio I would not have paid 20 dollars for it, instead out of nostalgia I paid 40.  What a waste.",UNK
15060,This was my first visit to this brand location and my first visit to this brand since to moving to AZ from OH.  I only hope that the service recieved on this visit was a fluke and not what can be expected in the future.  Our server wasn't that attentative to our table and had to be hailed more than once.,UNK
15061,I heard the original owner JC is taking the place back and scheduled to reopen in a few weeks! looking foward to checking it out! It was horrible with the asian lady owning it!,UNK
15062,"So apparently the trick is to come when it's not busy - the service is better. When they get busy, everything goes to hell. \nFood this time was again so-so.",UNK
15063,"So nice to have a little wine spot in the neighborhood.  Unassuming but a nice place.  We had the meat/cheese plate and a nice little bottle of wine.  Little pricey but if you want something different than a bottle at home, this is a good alternative.",UNK
15064,"This place was alright. Burgers didn't really stand out for me, it could have been better. Decent size portions. It didn't live up to my expectation. I would suggest buying it from groupon when they have the deal. Not really worth payign the full price. I'll probably give this place another try, maybe.",UNK
15065,"Not local friendly.not very accommodating for groups larger than 6 or so.average staff at best. Foods ok,service needs work.I would not recommend this place.",UNK
15066,"Listen there isn't anywhere else. This place reminds me of car trips in the 1970s. Clean enough, big rooms and a pool, plus very inexpensive. If your looking for a W hotel your out of luck:)",UNK
15067,Close to  Hockey Complex.  Not too far to walk to the old USX building or Federal Home Loan bank.  Some places downtown will be a good 20 minute walk or need a cab.  Decent restaurant in hotel and few minute walk to Friday's.  Otherwise restaurants are a good 20 minutes walk for dinner.,UNK
15068,If you are looking for Hip Hop this is a great spot located in the Mirage Casino near the side Valet.  Not a huge club but good size and nice table set up and layout.  The host here are good people. Let me know if you need a referral.,UNK
15069,"Over priced , mediocre food! Don't understand why? Clean place , nice staff.\n$ 13.99 for spring rolls?! $10 for a vermicelli bowl with BBQ pork bits that tasted like it was pre-cooked? Came out in like two minutes!",UNK
15070,First timer at Mimi's Cafe. I was extremely hungry.. The service was alright but the time bring out the food was too long. It's okay... Solid 3.5 ..,UNK
15071,"The fish was great quality, I could tell...but everything just tasted a bit bland.  I tried every single sauce they had and nothing really popped out at me.\n\nI love fish tacos, but these could use some type of flavor...not sure why but it wasn't coming through.",UNK
15072,"I can't comment on the coffee I'm not a coffee drinker, but their chai tea was horrible. It was by far the worst I've ever had.",UNK
15073,"Service was good, ask for nick.  Steak and egg skillet minus the gravy.   Check groupon for a good deal.",UNK
15074,"If your drunk you can come here. I mean, it's greasy and taste a LITTLE better then Taco Bell. But not by much. It's fast. It's greasy. The people are nice that work there?",UNK
15075,"Gluten Free/Allergy Sensitive (menu on-line)\n\nIt was clean and the service was good but, the food was medicore at best. If you can't have a great cheeseburger at a steak house then you have problems.",UNK
15076,"Great space and extra bonus for the young scantily clad waitress's roaming the place. The food, very forgetful. But, I gather people come here to drink and not expect fine cuisine.",UNK
15077,"My brother and I ate here because the buffet was closed (at 9 PM on Saturday). I thought that the food and atmosphere was good. Our waitress was friendly, and discouraged us from rushing.",UNK
15078,"I really enjoyed this place when it was a smaller coffee shop.  Now it has grown too crowded and the lines are too long.  I primarily drink black coffee, so imagine my surprise when after waiting in line for awhile they put my cup in line after all the other specialty drinks.  Just too much time for a quick cup of coffee.",UNK
15079,The carne asada was pretty good but I wouldn't go back. No napkins in the holder and there were dead gnats in the soda machine. Very gross.,UNK
15080,"Bacchanal is a go buffet when you are Vegas, but it just seems they don't have too many selection on foods for the $$$, but the desserts are really good!",UNK
15081,"I drive past this place all the time so I decided to finally try it. I was surprised with the menu, it wasn't what I expected but overall it was alright. The service was great and I liked the atmosphere. Nothing spectacular about it though. I tried the turkey sandwich and some fries, which were okay.",UNK
15082,Can you say- alot of food. First time patron and wasn't that impressed. It's alright nothing spectacular. Just feels like and taste like your at olive garden on steroids.,UNK
15083,Burgers were nothing special at all and arrived cold. Calamari appetizer was overcooked. Service was inattentive. Best part was the fat tire. Go elsewhere.,UNK
15084,This is probably the best north indian restaurant in Pittsburgh (Lawrenceville/Bloomfield). A bit of a dive with a traditional menu but the food is made fresh and the prices can't be beat.  The lunch buffet is a prety good deal (much less than $10!).,UNK
15085,"i had the tonkatsu ramen. it was good. the place was small, and the broth was too salty for my taste. but everything else (in the bowl) was yummy!",UNK
15086,"1st experience-  Decent sandwich; would return.\n\n2nd experience-The salad bar was surprisingly good; would return.\n\n3rd experience-Very un-tasty sandwich, would only return for the salad bar.",UNK
15087,"I absolutely loved the food,and we tried a variety. Major issue is with the service. It was the worst of ANYWHERE I have ever eaten.  There is no excuse for this,especially on a Tuesday with only 4 tables occupied. They really need some management present in that establishment!",UNK
15088,"I won't be coming back here for a long time. The bartender that served me and my friends was incredibly rude! He charged us full price for drinks during happy hour and when we asked him about it, he gave a sarcastic answer along with an eye roll. He didn't even bother to apologize or anything! Horrible!",UNK
15089,The food was mediocre compared to the Taiwanese type food I have at home. Mostly the same dishes but different flavor... I will not come back here.,UNK
15090,"Great Wings & Fresh Raw Oysters with a great view of Uptown & greenway. This Location has less amenities than it's Sibling locations. i.e.: sans pool table, less TV Screens & a surprisingly smaller Draft and Beer Selection. Good Service and ample outside seating will have me coming back!",UNK
15091,I can't imagine why so many people have rated this place to highly.  Mediocre at best.  Don't waste your money or your time.,UNK
15092,"this is a great little escape, right on the strip.  too bad it's only 9 par 3 holes.  nevertheless, it's a fun place to stop into if you're just looking for a 2 hour diversion.  btw, the course conditions were horrible.  it's WAAAAY overplayed.",UNK
15093,"Unclean, unfriendly- yummy Sandwhich- thintastic asparagus eggwhite on thin everything bagel toasted.\nWhat would it be like to receive 5 Star service in Las Vegas?\nHow great would this be?",UNK
15094,Very poor service.  Orange chicken was just chicken nuggets with a little sauce that didn't taste like orange.  Way to much breaking. We took friends and all were very disappointed in quality.  We ate here when it first opened and it was better.  Sweet sour soup was OK someone said.,UNK
15095,"I wasn't sure what to order so I ordered  one of my favorite side dishes. Mac and cheese. I was extremely disappointed it was very dry and bland. It cost almost 4 bucks im really glad I didn't get more i really was hoping that it was good.  The portion was a good amount , just lacking taste and cheese.",UNK
15096,"Buffet is worth 4.95 very dissapointing coming from Aria. Only French toast, tofu salald and gelato were good.\n\nThe wait and price totally not worth it, save your Vegas Money and go somewhere else!!",UNK
15097,Burgers were good but not great.  Service was just fine.  \nTheir concept of getting a beer while waiting in line is kind of gitchy but we bought into the concept and actually enjoyed it.  \nWe weren't overwhelmed but will try again.,UNK
15098,Overall food and service of waitresses were okay.\nBut the owner's attitude towards customers were not good at all.\nHe was bossy and rude to customers as he was treating his employees.,UNK
15099,We opted for the $35 buffet plus unlimited mimosas/bloody mary's. This place is ran poorly but the deal is unbeatable.  $35 buffet plus bottomless mimosas and bloody mary's.,UNK
15100,"We had reservations but still had to wait 30 minutes, the waitress was hard to understand, with a heavy accent.the food was plentiful and it continued, the salad bar wa s adequate we added the seafood extra, a lot of the meet was way overcooked",UNK
15101,I'm not a fan of the Panera in Oakland.  Often when I have been there the salads have no dressing on them or are missing a vital piece.  Last time I went I ordered a breakfast sandwich on a bagel and they pressed it on a panini press making it flat as a pancake and burnt.  Very unappealing.,UNK
15102,"I've only been here for drinks, but the bartenders have been, for the most part, very nice. Service has been pretty quick, even when they are super busy. I just wish they had a better whisky selection.",UNK
15103,"This mandarin has great staff and good service. If you are going for authentic Chinese food , don't come here. But if your looking for an awesome dessert experience...this is the place to go!",UNK
15104,"I guess this is supposed to be efficient and convenient, but I wish it was a bit closer to the airport.  It is nice to have one bus instead of a different bus for each rental car company.",UNK
15105,Nice atmosphere and the frites were great but we expected the meals to be more flavorful and we found the drinks to be overpriced. More welcoming to kids than many similar restautants.,UNK
15106,In St Andrews Sq...\nLast impeached in UK...\nA simple column...,UNK
15107,Great for the older crowd and international travelers. away from the strip but not to far but not walking distance. tables are very old and dirty but gambling isn't the cleanest of games. Restaurants are ok but nothing to write home about. If you want a cheap vacation LV is always the place to go.,UNK
15108,"Ambiance.  Nothing more. 15-17 bucks for a sandwich  burger or wrap.  Showed up cold, bland and soggy.  Good for kids. Thats it.",UNK
15109,"Love this place, their fresh squeezed grapefruit juice is probably one of the best I've had in a while, the place is relaxing, alive and refreshing, perfect spot for brunch.",UNK
15110,Sub-par food.  My mom found a mosquito in her food.  That was enough for us.  \n\nOn a bonus - the mommy in me - They have a baby changing station in the bathroom.,UNK
15111,"Great idea for a healthy drink place but was not impressed. They were out of items (muffins, ranch, mayo) and lacked table seating even though try offered food. My turkey wrap with sliced carrots was dry and had no dipping sauce. The staff was friendly and helpful with what they could offer.",UNK
15112,I found a pair of Prada pumps here on sale for $90!!!  Crazy good deal.\n\nI have to deduct one star though for the appearance of the store and shitty outdated outlet it's located in.,UNK
15113,Over priced. Average food. Slow service. Bellagio really could improve the menu at this spot! You don't really have any other choice!,UNK
15114,"The service was outstanding.  The waiter and general manager nailed the whole experience.  The food was good, but I have had equally as good cuts of steak elsewhere for 1/2 the price.",UNK
15115,"Quality burger and fries, nothing mind blowing. The chili is really tasty but a little pricey for \""fast food.\"" Bonus points for the fry sauce dispensers inside.",UNK
15116,"A lot of options a little taste.  This place is really overrated and in fact I think all of the restaurants at the Wynn and Encore suck, outside of the Italian Seafood spot.  Save your money and go to a much better buffet at Paris.",UNK
15117,"This place is not a bad place for a bowling alley. The food here isn't that terrific, but what can you expect? Had a group party here and it was a fun place to go. Overall not a bad place to hang out.",UNK
15118,You get what you pay for and the Riviera is no exception.  The Casino is definitely dated but doesn't feel as dingy as it could.  The rooms are comfortable and the pool is decent.  Worth leaving the property to find good food.  The walk to the strip is fairly quick too.,UNK
15119,"I have always felt the price point at Mimi's is high for what you get.  Menu selections are average.  My wife loves this place, she would give it 4 stars, but unfortunately I am writing the review,",UNK
15120,"They don't do AYCE :( but prices are reasonable otherwise..since we pretty much ONLY do all you can eat, we won't be back. Picked up a few rolls to go and quality was okay, not the best.",UNK
15121,"Boo. They had no bug spray here! In fact, this wasn't a very well-stocked gas station. I imagine they mostly get people bringing back their rental cars and other people near the airport who are interested in going inside for convenience store amenities... :(",UNK
15122,They need to speed up their food prep time or something needs to change. Waiting more than 30 Mins every time I get here...it's not THAT worth of quality.,UNK
15123,"Very small burgers, to expensive for the size. Good concept but my meat was raw inside still. Not sure of the safety of their meat to ever eat again.",UNK
15124,"This establishment has outgrown it's community, patients hidden in every nook & cranny.  Staff are knowledgable and friendly. The building it's self is extremely old and in need if repairs.",UNK
15125,I still don't understand why people write good reviews for such cheap produce/meats. Terrible cheap farm raised salmon and corn fed (ie chock full of hormones) beef. Low quality all the way.,UNK
15126,*-*-*-* Got an Hour To Waste *-*-*-\n*-*-*-* Want a POOR car wash *-*-*-\n\nDanny's won't let you down on both of the above.,UNK
15127,"Super long wait,  so we went to the to-go order window outside.  A plastic cup of frozen hot chocolate was $11 and let me tell you... it is not worth the wait nor the money.!!! Tasted like watered down cold hot chocolate. Sad day.",UNK
15128,Poor experience and terrible service. Waiter was rude and gave extremely lackluster service. They a get two stars bcs the music was good.,UNK
15129,"fast, semi-cheap takeout. place is kinda dirty on the floors but it didn't bother me.\n\ntransfriendly- should be very accomodating plus if they talk shit and you don't speak chinese you won't know anyway!",UNK
15130,"A bit tacky (plastic sheets on the tables) and a WAY too loud juke box, but the service was good.  The food is nothing special.",UNK
15131,"Used to go here for sushi all the time. Good food, decent prices. We stopped going because the wait staff was always very rude to us... we were good, frequent customers, so I don't know what was up. We go to Takara now... just down the street and they're awesome.",UNK
15132,"Terrible, terrible service. 15 minutes to take a drink order, and after 20 more minutes, nobody has come back. Coffee, water and Ice Tea...really?",UNK
15133,"After going here several times I have to update my review everything has always been very good but today after stopping in for cupcakes I'm disappointed, they were stale and  the frosting was also not very good. I don't think we will be returning.",UNK
15134,"Overrated, I first ordered bone-in ribeye steak, it tasted really bad, not seasoned at all. Then i returned it and got the fillet which was better. I dont recommend it if u are really into steak..",UNK
15135,"Dumpy dive bar with normal/nice bar prices.  WTF?  Scary location & parking, broken glass everywhere, homeless guy out front begging for spare change, graffiti in bathrooms, etc.  Beer selection nothing to get excited about either.",UNK
15136,Overpriced. Not a great dining experience. Atmosphere is like an employee dining room instead of a restaurant. Food is just ok.,UNK
15137,No bueno. I liked the fries but that's about it. Maybe I didn't order the right thing but so far I'm not impressed at all. The tables were all dirty and iwont be back anytime soon.,UNK
15138,"Be very careful ordering here. Wonton noodles and dumplings are pretty good, but just about everything else is really sweet and corn starchy and under spiced and etc etc",UNK
15139,"Beer was cold.\n\nFood was meh.\n\nOrdered two burgers and you could tell they were the frozen ones that are made in bulk for restaurants.\n\nNothing special here, except for a lot of TVs.",UNK
15140,"Need to add 1-2 $100 table on the regular. Poker room and the casino itself  is small compared to Wild Horse Pass Casino. But, it'll do. Food selection is great.",UNK
15141,"Made the mistake of giving them another shot. Small, overpriced and flavorless carne asada. We won't be back.",UNK
15142,"It's ok. If it's late and you want a place to eat, it's a good place to find some ok food.",UNK
15143,"Waited 30 minutes and no one even got my order (even w/ 3 people working). No one  even offered me a menu. \n\nI never walk out of a restaurant, but this is the 3rd time going in with terrible customer service.",UNK
15144,"I wasn't impressed.  Casino is dirty and still has that run down feeling.  I wanted to like it being from the \""real\"" D, but I'm just not a fan.  The Coney Island was OVERPRICED and so so.",UNK
15145,At first this apartment complex was great. Then things started going downhill. The management did a terrible job on the end of lease process and I would definitely advice others of looking else where for a place to live.,UNK
15146,"It's been awhile since I've been here and I was really looking forward to the create a pasta since it's been awhile.  Apparently they don't have it anymore.  The quality wasn't what I expected. The service was alright,  just not sure if I would return again.",UNK
15147,Really amazing porch but the rudest service I have ever had in my life. Kept trying to give her the benefit of the doubt but at each interaction she was so rude. I think her name is Ruthann. Horrible. Won't go back because of her.,UNK
15148,The male bathroom was very dirty. There were crap stains on the back toilet and urine on the floor and foot prints in it. They are not keeping the bathrooms cleans at this QT,UNK
15149,"Good service, but too much over price, $400 after tips for two of us, that price I can eat much much moore better sashimi at Los Angel, won't go back anymore",UNK
15150,"The food is subpar, and far too expensive. We ordered the wings, and they were rubbery and dry. The staff was friendly enough.",UNK
15151,I wouldn't go to this location at night by myself. The catfish was fishy and too much breading. I'll be sticking with Papa Joe's. The pizza was blah. Those $5 no wait pizzas taste better for less. It was something new nearby to try. It won't be a repeat.,UNK
15152,50 bucks for two adults and a kid. Way over priced breakfast. The atmosphere was great. The service was very slow. Thank goodness the drinks are self serve.,UNK
15153,Not so great.  The deluxe room is 2 queen beds with a big tv and plain bath/shower.  The tub had several chips in the porcelain (how does that happen?).  The pillows and bedding are pretty good but I still felt like I needed to check for bed bugs.,UNK
15154,The service was good but that's about it.  My tuna was cold and was not cooked well. The rice was the best part of the meal. Definitely not worth the prices. Steak was over cooked. Croutons were rock hard. Deserts tasted store bought. Atmosphere was casual but prices were upscale.,UNK
15155,"I washed my care here over the weekend, and found it to be terrible. They vacuumed a little bit of it, but when I go the car back there were still leaves in it. Don't waste your money!",UNK
15156,"Not a huge fan, but my husband whats his burger with egg...YUCK!  Although now he doesn't eat meat, so he opted for the patty melt with the meat patty substitute....defeats the purpose of going their at all.",UNK
15157,Came here for lunch with a larger group. Service was mediocre. What was supposed to be a 1 hour gambling break turned into a 2 hour waiting game between food and the bill. Food was standard bar type food.,UNK
15158,"Came here 12/20/14 & ordered the chicken fried steak meal... Well the chicken fried steak, was not chicken fried steak, it was beef... The food had no flavor, but they give you a nice size proportion. So if taste is not important to you, then you will enjoy this place",UNK
15159,"The food was Ok and so was the service, my issue is the portion sizes. We had a private room and a fixed menu, I left this place hungry and I'm of normal height and weight... made a pit stop to Capriotti's afterwards.",UNK
15160,So so food. Had kung pao chicken and its just like every other strip mall Chinese joint around here. Lots of celery in the food. Wife had cashew chicken and it looked about the same. Actually if it wasn't for the nuts you couldn't tell them apart by looking at them.,UNK
15161,"The drink  machine was broken and they didn't have soypaper ,,,really ? ice tea Had stuff floating at the bottom gross",UNK
15162,"When adult women try to sell something to me in the voice of a ditzy, confused six year old, I tend to run far away. Too bad I like the underwear here. In all seriousness, not all of your clientele take pride or want to identify with the helpless school girl persona. Give me a break.",UNK
15163,"I live close to this place so i drive by all the time, looked interesting.\nAs far as being the best pizza in Las Vegas is not true by any means. Thick crust plenty of cheese but ultimately  BLAND, also the toppings few and far between. \nI dont know.",UNK
15164,"The chicken teriyaki was very fatty and mostly dark meat. The sauce seemed to have a lot of cornstarch or other thickening agent. It's open late, has low prices, and has relatively fast service.",UNK
15165,The owners are extremely nice here. Polite and friendly. The food is just barely average however. I would NOT order sushi here and I doubt I would return.,UNK
15166,I thought if I go inside and order in person it would prevent mistakes. I was wrong they ordered 3 extra things that I never said I wanted that were expensive. I didn't think The total sounded right but wasn't sure until I got home. Unreal!,UNK
15167,The Capital Tap Haus is an average burger place with a limited selection of beer. They only serve Capital Brewery beers which is just okay. The food is nothing special and I would try other places around the square before I stopped back here.,UNK
15168,"Tried this place again after waiting over a year. The employees were some of the friendliest people ever. Still as much as I wanted to like this place the food doesnt cut it for me, I quit halfway through my dinner because it was so bland. I had the shrimp chow mein and general tso's.",UNK
15169,"Ordered a large cheese pizza. The crust was ok, not very flavorful. The pie had a pool of grease covering it. This pizza had a bland sauce and very little of it. It just seemed that minimal effort went into the pizza. This pizza is not worth a second visit.",UNK
15170,Kind of a dump. Lots of homeless hanging around. People inside using the computers talking to themselves and in desperate need of some serious personal hygiene. I think I will make the drive to another branch from now on. This one's not for me.,UNK
15171,"I was excited to try a new Italian restaurant close to home. It's a cute little restaurant, good vibe, server was friendly. BUT when I asked questions about the menu she was not very knowledgeable. I do not know if I will return to give this place another chance. I wasn't too  impressed with the food.",UNK
15172,This place is way under seasoned.  The beans were ok.  I hate that they use store bought tortillas.  I don't plan on returning.  There are better places near downtown Chandler.,UNK
15173,"The bagels are small and not salty enough and definitely do not live up to all the hype and long lines.  It is great to watch them make the bagels as you are in line, however.  The cream cheese they use is much lighter and cheesier than the everyday Philadelphia cream cheese, which is nice.",UNK
15174,The salad was good but nothing you couldn't get at a supermarket's salad bar for far less money. The man behind the counter was surly. I'm not too demanding when it comes to customer service but he seemed genuinely annoyed that we were there. It was a weekday during what should have been lunch rush and it wasn't busy.,UNK
15175,I called and didn't even bother leaving a message after reading the reviews. If you advertise that you are open then you may want to consider answering your phone. You just lost another customer.,UNK
15176,We went in for the steak and shrimp advertisement that was posted outside but it was so smoky we couldn't even go in and stay. We went upstairs to the buffet it looked ok not very many selections though so after dealing with the smoke and the not so plentiful Buffet we decided to take off,UNK
15177,"Dunno why it is called \""fine dine\"".... There is nothing fine about dining there. I thought it would be an upscale place by its name. But it is not and there are other Indian restaurants in this area which server better food.",UNK
15178,Just a dumb concept to have to stand in line to get food.  We wanted drinks first (unwinding after work) and then decided on food. The server can't get us food. So then we have to stand in line for an hour!   Not doing that. So we should just keep drinking and then drive.  Makes no sense!,UNK
15179,Okay bagels though a little overpriced. Been to squirrel hill location and Ellsworth location once each. Have consistently had rude customer service. Really turns me off. Won't be going back even though the bagels are okay.,UNK
15180,"I love the idea of the drive-thru and the service was very friendly.  But the brewed coffee (decaf, black) was very weak!  I need a strong,bold coffee in the morning!  I was looking at some of the other reviews; looks like the espresso-based drinks are better.",UNK
15181,"Compared to other Starbucks in the area, this is one I usually avoid unless I need to get on the freeway right after. Pretty slow service, drinks are mediocre... But what does it for me is that it's never a welcoming experience here and the employees make me want to leave quicker than they can serve coffee!",UNK
15182,Awesome atmosphere. Bartender was laughing on his phone while we were patiently waiting for our order to be taken. Then he wanted me to yell my order across the loud bar to him while he continued to stay on his phone. Very inconsiderate. Worst tortilla soup I've ever had!,UNK
15183,"Very nice space, and food was good, but far too expensive. Dropped $20 on one 10 oz beer and one glass of wine. Ordered ravioli for dinner and was served 5 lonely raviolis (raviolii?) for $17. No sides. No bread.  Still hungry. Won't be back.",UNK
15184,"Not very good food. Too much $$ for not a very good quality. Biscuits were hard, Caesar dressing watered down and sour. Not very exciting BBQ either. Despite all of that, Elizabeth \""Lizzy\"" was an excellent waitress.",UNK
15185,I am very glad there is a sonic finally close to my home. I really just like to come here for the beverages. Why is the service so slow every single time I come?,UNK
15186,I tried this with a social coupon. The skinny margaritas are not that good. The food was o.k. but not worth the effort when I have better closer to my house.,UNK
15187,"Had the combo plate.  Three out of four meats were dry/overcooked.  Last time, I had pulled turkey, so dry nearly inedible.  This can't be the best bbq around...",UNK
15188,"Rooms need updating but the casino was fun.  In addition I left my jacket in the closet and called their lost and found when I got home that night.  The room had been cleaned and re-occupied and my jacket was no where to be found.  The casino floor was nice, but that's it.",UNK
15189,Way over hyped!  Food was eh and service was mediocre.  Was hoping for something so much better after seeing them on TV.  Boo!,UNK
15190,"Good price and great location only a few minutes walk from the shops and the theatre. However, the room was terribly cold because the windows aren't double glazed. Saved money by staying there but ended up very cold at night.",UNK
15191,"I don't know, maybe I am spoiled by Old Mexico, but this place didn't do it for me.  The seasoning was non existent in the beef taco, and enchiladas, I couldn't even finish.  I won't be going back!",UNK
15192,"Nothing going on here on a Friday night. No mix drink menu, they just made up one,which was ok. \nTurn off: dirty restroom and two of the three employees working,  we're drinking and mingling with customers.  Regulars I guess,  because we didn't get much attention.",UNK
15193,"And the only reason I gave it two stars was the fact that our waitress was on the ball and felt so bad that I had to return my steak 4 times. The manager there, when the place gets busy, is well in over his head. I doubt that we will go back anytime soon or at least not on a sunday for lunch.",UNK
15194,Way too much for lousy margaritas. Jimmy should take his name off this restaurant as it is an embarrassment compared to something like the Cabo Wabo Cantina. Now there's a very cool place with good food and drink.,UNK
15195,We came here after a wedding.  We were hungry and looking for a bite.  Didn't know too many places around Madison.  I found this place on Yelp. We ordered the late night tacos (3 each).  I asked the server if they were the authentic Mexican kind and she replied that they have a twist on them.,UNK
15196,"We ate there yesterday and all I can say is the food was ok, average no the best Mexican I ever had but good, the real downfall for me was the waitress , bus boy was good and quick with chips and salsa but other than that service sucked!!!!",UNK
15197,"Mediocre food, slow service... My wife and I went to lunch and it took forever to get a cheeseburger and a salad.",UNK
15198,"Not impressed - bagels were okay but eggs, sausage, etc came out of the microwave, smoothie was a cup if sugar with no real fruit, out of the bagel I wanted, coffee my dad wanted, creamer another customer wanted, and the place was filthy from kids destroying their food all over the place. Will not go back.",UNK
15199,The food was sub par and way too hot to eat at first. The cook was a little intimidating and the cashier was not dressed very appropriately. I felt uncomfortable going in with my girlfriend..,UNK
15200,"Friendly girl taking the order, boss in back asking her questions while she was trying to make my order. I guess he is more concerned about his work then his customers... Coffee was good but I was looking for a drive thru and there was none.",UNK
15201,"This bike shop has a lot to offer when it comes to bikes. The shop is awesome as well. The one thing I noticed immediately though was the price gouging. I will not be paying $350 to get fit on a bike. Yes thats right, thats the going rate at this shop.",UNK
15202,"\""I don't know I just work here\"" should sum up the service given at border line. This was the answer I got to a question from the one and only employee we could find in the restaurant. She was impatient with taking our order.",UNK
15203,"it was extremely loud and it took forever to get our food.  i'll try this place another time, but this visit wasn't up to par.",UNK
15204,"By far the slowest Starbucks ever. The drive through is unbelievable! Nice people just amazingly slow. The one on Maryland and Silverado Ranch is quick and although it doesn't have a drive through and  is out of my way to work, it's faster to go in there than wait here!",UNK
15205,"Ordered the iced coffee with sugar free hazelnut. The coffee tasted horrible, I've had better come from a can of Folgers.",UNK
15206,"Food is terrible. Fish does not taste fresh. Only sushi spot in town that I've experienced having a hard time eating the most common item due to strong \""fishy\"" flavor associated with old fish.",UNK
15207,Loved the name and design of their logo so we thought we would try it. We ordered 4 different rolls and they were unimpressive and the tuna did not taste fresh.,UNK
15208,"from a visit a few months ago....when it was still hot outside\n\nI had the bahn mi dog w/ fries. it was very good.\nonly major complaint was that the A/C was not working in the restaurant, so it was VERY hot.",UNK
15209,"This is for the nightclub. \nIt was pretty empty. No line, no cover. \nMost people have not heard of it.\nMostly people there for bottle service since it was cheap there.\nNot the place to go for a Vegas clubbing experience.",UNK
15210,"Food was mediocre at best, the only thing that I actually thought was okay was the shrimp, but even that was extremely extremely salty. Everything that was fried was either as soft as jello or as hard as a rock. Won't come here again even if it's free",UNK
15211,"The food could have been served hotter, the gyro meat could have been moister and more flavorful, the staff could have been a lot more knowledgeable and friendly, and the soda machine could use more carbonation. Too many other Greek food options in town for me to ever consider returning.",UNK
15212,Service was slow waited for my smoothie for like 20 minutes.\nMy wife liked her smoothie I didn't like mine at all,UNK
15213,"It's been how many months, and the A/C still isn't fixed?! Major fail! Nice looking place...just need to get their act together!",UNK
15214,"I'm sorry, but...well...\nYou're wearing pasties.  PAS-TIES!\nI'M HERE FOR TIT-TIES!!!",UNK
15215,"Another location that is pre-cooking their Carne Asada, then reheated when ordered. Tough as leather and overcooked. This trend will only take them farther downhill!",UNK
15216,We don't even go here anymore.   Every time they don't have enough chicken and we have to wait for them to cook it for 20\nMinutes.   Bummer because I really like the ol original recipe!!,UNK
15217,My wife had the feast. Did not like the crab legs the lobster was great the shrimp was average. I had the Ny steak. The steak was average. Service was friendly but the food came out cold and had to send it back.\nIf we could I would give it 2 1/2 stars,UNK
15218,Clothes are overpriced for quality of items - poor customer service. Sales associated used to be more helpful and would always have a smile...,UNK
15219,The workers here have grown jaded from having to deal with university students on a daily basis. We sat a a dirty table for awhile before someone came in and finally cleaned it. I ended up getting a breakfast burrito which was fairly average. It's a place to go if you don't care about lazy service and want average diner food.,UNK
15220,"It was an okay burrito. It's a chain of course, but i prefer Chipotle's burritos over this one. Nice fresh made tortillas though! Obviously not authentic Mexican, but nice to have more than burgers and fries on a menu.",UNK
15221,"Pretty average, overpriced chophouse/grill. the bone in ribeye was kind of weak but the cream spinich was awesome.  really expensive for a poor grade of ribeye though.",UNK
15222,What a mess ....I would just like my paper to be delivered and not look like it was already read. \nI would like for  At Republic  to follow through like I was told  and put the paper on my porch in the same manor as you would buy at the store...Come on,UNK
15223,"This is my local pharmacy and I must admit I\""m not very impressed.  They either give me the wrong amount of my prescription or they forget to list whether there are refills or not.  I'd suggest to check everything before you leave the store.",UNK
15224,The food was only so so.  The shredded beef tacos and pork enchiladas were on the bland side and the rice was very dry and tasteless. The dips that came with the chips were good and the margaritas were pretty good for the price.,UNK
15225,"I am Mexican and didn't like the food but the guacamole and the elote were good I think that was the only thing that I liked, the service was really good though.",UNK
15226,Food was good .. Service was terrible. We waited almost an hour for our food then another 20 for our check. Will not be back .,UNK
15227,"Just don't. Food was not very good and the price was high. The \""complementary\"" beer and wine offset some of the disappointment. Next time I will hit up the burger place.",UNK
15228,"Food is good but the service is bad. It doesn't seem like they are happy to have you. While I love the strawberry crepes, fighting the crowd, standing in line pushed up towards the door,  being told \""cash only'  and being served bad coffee makes me wonder why I went there in the first place.",UNK
15229,did I eat at the same place all of you other reviewers ate?   nothing fantastic about it - just a sandwhich.  I can make better.   this really is along the lines of subway or blimpie - the only thing that is better than those 2 is that the  service was fast and good.,UNK
15230,"Politically, JJs is absolutely the worst. But the subs, OH the subs. That said, for some reason, this is the worst Jimmy Johns in CU. Not sure why, but it's never as satisfying as other ones. I highly recommend the one on Lincoln, though.",UNK
15231,"The food wasn't very good.\nThe enchiladas were more like microwave food and he fish tacos were dry :(\nThe location isn't very nice too, right of the casino lobby.\nI wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.",UNK
15232,"if you must, sit at the teppanyaki table where the food isn't too bad (unless you have a problem with copious heapings of garlic) and the teppanyaki chef makes some attempt at diner participation. avoid the sushi at all costs. you're a long way from japan, baby.",UNK
15233,I order the same drink every time and each time it's made differently. I never have trouble with my drink at most locations. They just don't listen to what you're ordering.,UNK
15234,"Food was okay. Atmosphere was quaint. Can only speak for the ladies but if you have to potty you may wish to go somewhere else. As for the service, it was awesome.",UNK
15235,"We did not stay here, but went to check out a show, walk around, etc. (We took the monorail.) The ventilation system is obviously quite old and the whole place reeked of stale smoke.",UNK
15236,We were charged 50 cents each for a single small cup of ranch and ketchup to go with our wings and fries. My partner was also charged 50 cents extra for his BBQ burger when he requested his sauce on the side. Burgers were ok if a little bland but patties were not evenly cooked.,UNK
15237,"Watered down milkshakes, the place smells like the nail salon next door, Egg Cream was EXTREMELY small along with too much soda. Liked the fry seasoning but they were under cooked.  Long wait time for our food. Given the burger competition on Eastern Ave., the space will be vacant by Summer.",UNK
15238,They need friendlier associates and need to be trained with greater customer service. Its like they hate their jobs or something.   Or maybe the employee is just having a bad day?  I don't know...  I'll still rate your ice cream as amazing!  :-),UNK
15239,"There were a lot of options, but none of them blew me away.  It was either too cold, not enough flavor or just bad.\n\nThe dessert was the best.",UNK
15240,"I know there are quite a few reviews, and I'm not saying go or don't go.  I just can't seem to figure out the big draw of this place.  I was not impressed...at all.  Meh..for sure.",UNK
15241,"Price matching to online stores IS advertised in the store but as soon as you bring it up, they start with the bad attitudes and make you walk all over the store to deal with multiple employees. It was worth it for me price matching to Amazon and saving more than $50 on a $140 though.",UNK
15242,Too many stairs!  I can't believe they make girls in tight skirts and high heels walk up and down the fire escape stairs.   So dangerous.\n\nHuge club with three stories.  Hip hop floor was not big enough.  The electronica main stage was like a rave and not in a good way.,UNK
15243,"Okay, I don't mind standing in line for good BBQ, but Joes doesn't have it anymore.  Portions were smaller, meet was dryer and prices were still high.  Joes was a good place to go, but they lost their tough.  Went for quantity over quality.  Eat at your own risk.",UNK
15244,"The food here is very oily and it looks like need a big clean here. Some dishes taste ok but it still very oily. The guy is very friendly ,but the lady ,she is so rude  for many times. I came here because it is closer to my location, but  the food is really unhealthy. Too much oil.",UNK
15245,Nice staff.....starters were totally tasteless.....main courses were pretty bland and not spicey at all....not the worst Indonesian food I've ever eaten but not good enough to eat there again.,UNK
15246,The now only price match total wine. BUNK!! all drive the extra 200 yards to get my poison at DANNY'S FAMILY CAR WASH thank you!,UNK
15247,None of the 3 copy machines they have in the lobby work. If you want copies you have to wait in line for someone behind the counter to make them for you and that can take forever!!!! How bout you FIX at least ONE of the three copy machines you have just sitting there?!?!?!,UNK
15248,2 stars are the the insane prices. \nAlso a review for the location on the casino floor. The customer service is outstanding. But for a daily cigar smoker; your normal smoke will be 5 times as much. But you can find a smoke if you know what your doing.,UNK
15249,"$20 an hour, I've paid for less and gotten more in LA.  I have to tell the lady to go harder like 3 times and they still expect a $10 tip.\n\nDefinitely not coming back for sure.",UNK
15250,Only order the steamed potstickers. Mongolian beef tasted like stir fry. The Cobb salad was nothing to write home about. The chicken was drizzled with butter but just too dry...even with avocado.,UNK
15251,"This review is not for a weekend buffet. I was mostly unimpressed with the actual food. There was a pretty diverse offering which was good, but nothing was truly great. Nothing special with desserts either. Kind of what you would get at any decent buffet place in vegas I feel.",UNK
15252,"This place used to be good, but that was years ago.\n\nToday it's very dirty with food that just doesn't cut it.\n\nThe salsa is still good so that gave it a star.",UNK
15253,"What's so special about this place? The sauce is okay, but Chick-fil-a has more choices of chicken and sauces. The \""texas toast\"" I got was not even toasted.",UNK
15254,It's a Saturday night and I've been sitting on a booth with two friends for over 30 minutes and NO ONE working in this place has asked us if we want a drink or food.  I realize I could walk over to the bar but then why the hell are there booths in here. Very poorly run.,UNK
15255,The meat department is aweful. Where it is stored looks filthy. Also expired and brown meat put back on shelf for resale. Beware...,UNK
15256,Service was terrible and the restaurant had very few customers. Our chicken wings came out cold so we sent them back. Salad that I ordered was missing some of the ingredients on the menu . Would not return to this location.,UNK
15257,Boring and bland. Slow service. You'd be better off going to Pastamore in the March\u00e9.,UNK
15258,"The frozen hot chocolate was a nice treat on a hot evening, but $11 for a 16 oz. drink that wasn't nearly as good as a standard Frappuccino...probably won't be back.",UNK
15259,"This Place is pretty good , been to numerous hookah lounges around the valley. \nThis place earns a 2 star from me. 1 for hookah, and 1 for the pool tables . Everything else nope.",UNK
15260,My experience was average. Wasn't amazing. Customer service was lacking. I do like my nails. $80 for acrylics (pink n white french) and pedi with design on 2 toes. Still looking for my regular nail salon :(,UNK
15261,These wings are kinda dry and the flavor does not go through the whole wing...they are good in a pinch when it's late and you are hungry.  But I've had better wings from the frozen food section,UNK
15262,"Ramen Jinya, I love you but a C rating for health inspection is NOT okay. Also, you should visit your studio city location for quality control as the spicy chicken ramen was watered down and not nearly as flavorful. Server was really nice and decor looks great but step it up!",UNK
15263,"Used much better than now. Now have to buy a seat section $1,500 + depends how many couches- suck!!!! Just a couple - can't enjoy all time",UNK
15264,"I was honestly expecting this to be quite a bit better. Their Stout was bland and my mushroom cheeseburger, while good, lacked something. This place gets a lot of good reviews, and the service was pretty good, so I guess I'll just chalk it up to my personal taste. This is me whining. Wah!",UNK
15265,"Stayed in alot of shady Vegas hotels.  And this isn't the worst one..that warrants the dual stars.  Other than that, location is decent and price is right.",UNK
15266,Very loud place. Fries were weird. Just didn't really get the overall theme. \nIn and Out still reigns.,UNK
15267,"Pros: Large portions, and good service - very friendly, sweet girl behind the register\n\nCon: The food just isn't very good. The only flavor the Pad Thai has is salty.",UNK
15268,Staff good! Decor is awesome! Food is gross & greasy! Salsa is the only good thing! I wouldnt go back!,UNK
15269,Food is what I expect from Yard house. But the hold time was way longer than conveyed. While waiting by the kitchen observed kitchen staff handle trash and then food without changing gloves.,UNK
15270,"Pretty average.  I've tasted better dogs at Venice Beach and many other places.  Very easy access,  just next to the Miracle Mile Shopping Center and Planet Hollywood Casino",UNK
15271,I was expecting a little more from this place. It was a nice ambiance and as most of restaurants in Vegas are its beautifully decorated but the food was just ok. I had the pesto fettuccine dish and it was very 'woody' tasting for lack of better term and just not that good.,UNK
15272,"Now that the wonderful PIrate battle has been replaced with the \nidiotic VIxens or Sirens or Sluts of TI,there is little to recommend \nthis hotel. No great restaurants and guest rooms are very ordinary\nand overpriced. Check out the clubs,but stay and gamble elsewhere.",UNK
15273,"Ate at the bar today. Was very looking forward to it but was not very impressed. 8oz soda, cold fries, spent $60 for 2 and not happy. Thought it would be better. For how much they get on the chefs on the show somebody was asleep in this kitchen.  The romane on my sliders was garbage.",UNK
15274,"Don't believe the positive reviews. If you've had really good sushi before, this place will disappoint. What makes it really not worth the money or time is the rude wait staff.",UNK
15275,"I came here after a recommendation that it was the it place for fries/poutine.. the service was slow, the fries were kind of cold and it didn't even taste that great, it wasn't the worst place but I wouldn't go back here",UNK
15276,They were nice but there was some Health inspector there and it didn't seem to be some routine check...and the staff seemed nervous and were doing a lot of whispering.,UNK
15277,"The coffee is good, but the customer service is horrible. They usually rush us thru the drive-thru only to get our order wrong almost every time. They are also very rude. We have a Starbucks and a Dunkin close to our house, which one do you think we will go to?",UNK
15278,"I'm waiting for return calls on an issue with their survey, that (AMC) asked me to do. They want your $$$$, but don't want your opinion!",UNK
15279,Disappointing. I waited over 45 min for a $25 pizza that tasted like a frozen deep dish pizza you get from the grocery store.,UNK
15280,"slow service. The banana blueberry bead was so so. Rolls were so so.  Sushi wasn't bad, not awesome. Service was total poops.",UNK
15281,"Super strange food. Very VERY expensive. I think people like this place because it's weird. No one needs portions like this and it's all odd. I'm not saying the food is bad, but $50 for two people to have weird breakfast food isn't worth it. Bring on a diner omelette!",UNK
15282,Seems like each time we go to this Black Angus it gets worse and worse. The service has always been slow but at our last visit it took 2 hours for dinner. The portions keep getting smaller and the staff is less than helpful. Flagging someone down for drink refills and to pay our bill is unacceptable especially considering the cost of the dinner.,UNK
15283,The food is good.  But i'm always missing something when from my order.  They always remember to charge for a side or something else but fail to include it.  This was the last time Im going here.  This has happened to many times.,UNK
15284,"Food is mediocre. The private room for larger parties is very depressing. It was like eating dinner in a lifeless conference room. Drab curtains, no music, Wine is overpriced. Nothing special on this menu. Wouldn't recommend it.",UNK
15285,"Well I was so excited when I seen a new restaurants was popping up the block from me... yay food! But honestly for me the food looks better than it taste. I love the idea but didn't care for the food. I may swing in again for their sangria it awesome, but the food not for me.",UNK
15286,Lousy service. Staff ignores customers and socializes among themselves. Food is slow and meh. No sign of a manager anywhere onsite. Better burgers elsewhere. Main problem here is lack of leadership and no management.,UNK
15287,"I only come here to play pool. $1.25 per game (quarters). If you want to eat, check out all of their neighbors. Definitely not a tourist spot.",UNK
15288,"It's not for me. The Mac 'n cheese did not taste homemade or fresh and for me that is a big no-no in the South. The pulled pork had way too much black pepper for my preference. Too bad, I just moved close by and wanted this place to be our go-to place for dinner out.",UNK
15289,"If you can afford it, go to Scarpetta. Disappointed in DOCG.\n\nService is nice and it's easy to get a table.",UNK
15290,"Used to eat here once a week until it changed ownership. Food went from a perfect 10 to maybe a 4. The chef that yells at everyone is gone and as much as I didn't care for him, he pretty much made the place. Don't think I will head back unless word around town changes about their food.",UNK
15291,"Very average, amongst beautiful scenery. Not a lot to say here. Very average food you can get almost anywhere. Not a ton of flavor, service took about 35 minutes in an empty place for 2 simple sandwiches. If everything else is closed, and you're starving, go here.",UNK
15292,"First time here today me and my husband, i don't like their Taiwanese traditional dishes and actually the price little higher compared with food quality.",UNK
15293,This Sonic had good food (for a Sonic) but service was very slow.\n\nBe advised that they use fake whipped cream as a topping on their shakes and (presumably) ice cream.,UNK
15294,"I usually rave to friends about the quality of the prime rib at Raffles.  My recent experience there was not pleasant though.  The prime rib was rubbery (normally, its melt in your mouth good).  I dont know if they reduced the quality of the beef they purchase or maybe it was just a bad night.",UNK
15295,"This place definitely isn't bad considering the prices. You might want to stay away from the filet mignon, but everything else seems ok. I've been to this place maybe four, five times and it doesn't seem to get better, doesn't seem to get worse.",UNK
15296,"This place was just OK.  \nAfter eating at SO CAL CRAWFISH in California, it's hard to compete.  I just love the flavoring at SO CAL CRAWFISH!  Hot N Juicy Crawfish was.....eh???",UNK
15297,"My husband and I used to go here a lot, but under new management and different workers, the food just isn't that great anymore.",UNK
15298,"Not great. Pretty bland. Food was cold. Hardly anyone here. I'd probably give it another try, but the prices were a bit high for so little flavor.",UNK
15299,"I went here once with one of my friends whom loves this place; however, this was not a place for me. The music was very loud in the lounge area and the place was uncomfortably over crowded.",UNK
