UNK	WORST PHONE EVER.

UNK	"Simple, lightweight and great fit."
UNK	"All in all, I'd expected a better consumer experience from Motorola."

UNK	I'm a bit disappointed.

UNK	Worth every penny.
UNK	Excellent wallet type phone case.

UNK	Internet is excrutiatingly slow.

UNK	Sending it back.
UNK	Now I know that I made a wise decision.
UNK	Someone shouldve invented this sooner.
UNK	Good price.
UNK	Everything worked on the first try.The device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good.
UNK	I received it quickly and it works great!!
UNK	Has been working great.
UNK	"As many people complained, I found this headset's microphone was very weak."
UNK	My 5-year old Nokia 2160 from Tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this.
UNK	They do not care about the consumer one bit.
UNK	"This is a good battery, and it got here really fast."
UNK	The instruction manual is lacking.
UNK	Also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case.
UNK	Phone now holds charge like it did when it was new.
UNK	The battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena.
UNK	It's uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone (Razr) or with my previous wired headset (that plugged into an LG).
UNK	We have gotten a lot of compliments on it.
UNK	This is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving.
UNK	I want my money back.
UNK	I love this device.
UNK	I am also very happy with the price.
UNK	I ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately.

UNK	"However-the riingtones are not the best, and neither are the games."
UNK	The plug did not work very well.
UNK	AMAZON SUCKS.
UNK	Rip off---- Over charge shipping.
UNK	VERY comfortable.
UNK	The battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago.
UNK	The reception is excellent!
UNK	"It fits comfortably in either ear, the sound is clear and loud, and the charge lasts a couple of days."
UNK	"very clear, quality sound and you don't have to mess with the sound on your iPod since you have the sound buttons on the headset."
UNK	1. long lasting battery (you don't have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones)2.
UNK	Obviously there is a problem with the adhesive.
UNK	Very disappointing.
UNK	"It was an inexpensive piece, but I would still have expected better quality."
UNK	It is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after I bought it.
UNK	Excellent sound quality.
UNK	Was not happy.
UNK	A PIECE OF JUNK THAT BROKE AFTER BEING ON MY PHONE FOR 2 DAYS!!!

UNK	"Comfortable, Nice Range, Good Battery Life."
UNK	Their network coverage in Los Angeles is horrible.
UNK	Excellent starter wireless headset.
UNK	"The loudspeaker option is great, the bumpers with the lights is very ... appealing."
UNK	The only thing that I think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset.
UNK	"First off the reception sucks, I have never had more than 2 bars, ever."
UNK	The phone gets EXTREMELY HOT!
UNK	"The microphone also works well, but (according to people I have called) it applifies everything."
UNK	Nice design and quality.
UNK	"Also, if your phone is dropped, this case is not going to save it, specially when dropped face down."
UNK	"It is light, easy to use, and has very clear reception and transmission."
UNK	"bad fit, way too big."
UNK	It definitely was not as good as my S11.
UNK	awesome device.
UNK	Waste of money.
UNK	"I had ordered a motorola data cable, got a very well finished and working product."
UNK	Love This Phone.
UNK	I was looking for this headset for a long time and now that I've got it I couldn't be happier.
UNK	"I'll be drivng along, and my headset starts ringing for no reason."
UNK	Display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year.
UNK	Battery life is also great!
UNK	The worst phone I've ever had.... Only had it for a few months.
UNK	Not a good item.. It worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player.
UNK	This is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if I try to push the ear plug into my ear.
UNK	Protects the phone on all sides.
UNK	This is a VERY average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network.
UNK	"Clear Skype Calls, Long Battery Life, Long Range."
UNK	Soyo technology sucks.
UNK	Great Hands Free Device.
UNK	"you can even take self portraits with the outside (exterior) display, very cool."
UNK	Same problem as others have mentioned.
UNK	After trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well.
UNK	Magical Help.
UNK	The worst piece of crap ever along with the Verizon customer service.
UNK	Poor sound quality.
UNK	The best phone in market :).
UNK	It worked very well.
UNK	The company shipped my product very promptly and it works well.
UNK	Exactly what I wanted.
UNK	The picture resolution is far below what other comparably-priced phones are offering today.
UNK	This is a great deal.
UNK	"Excellent product, I am very satisfied with the purchase."
UNK	I highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try.
UNK	Better than you'd expect.
UNK	"Using all earpieces, left or right, this thing will not stay on my ear."
UNK	Great product and price.

UNK	Very prompt service.
UNK	Excellent product for the price.
UNK	Very pleased with this headset.
UNK	don't waste your money and time.
UNK	I especially love the long battery life.

UNK	Works great.
UNK	Plantronics Bluetooth Excelent Buy.
UNK	I came over from Verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones.... the first thing I noticed was the really bad service.
UNK	I'll be looking for a new earpiece.
UNK	I highly recommend this device to everyone!
UNK	Jawbone Era is awesome too!
UNK	We received a WHITE colored battery that goes DEAD after a couple hoursTHe original used to last a week - but still lasts longer than thereplacement
UNK	After a year the battery went completely dead on my headset.
UNK	"I have used several phone in two years, but this one is the best."
UNK	An Awesome New Look For Fall 2000!.
UNK	This is the first phone I've had that has been so cheaply made.
UNK	"Att is not clear, sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk."
UNK	The plastic breaks really easy on this clip.
UNK	Price is good too.
UNK	Don't make the same mistake I did.
UNK	Oh and I forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone.
UNK	I'm using it with an iriver SPINN (with case) and it fits fine.
UNK	Also the area where my unit broke).- I'm not too fond of the magnetic strap.
UNK	"Overall, I am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception."
UNK	"every thing on phone work perfectly, she like it."
UNK	"Another note about this phone's appearance is that it really looks rather bland, especially in the all black model."
UNK	IT'S REALLY EASY.
UNK	My Sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect.
UNK	Fantastic earphones.
UNK	It finds my cell phone right away when I enter the car.
UNK	Low Quality.
UNK	I highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone.
UNK	But it does get better reception and clarity than any phone I've had before.
UNK	Warning - Stay away.
UNK	I wish I could return the unit and get back my money.
UNK	Awsome Device Works Great!!.
UNK	I used to talk on it for 1 - 1 1/2 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying.
UNK	"If you don't find it, too bad, as again the unit comes with one earpad only.I would not recommend this to anyone."
UNK	Very Displeased.
UNK	"I might have gotten a defect, but I would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone."
UNK	They made this case too small and is very difficult to install.
UNK	Restored my phone to like new performance.
UNK	"I would recommend purchasing the Jabra JX-10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my Moto Q, go figure."
UNK	"I searched the Internet, and found this one to be the best value."
UNK	Does not fit.
UNK	Very happy with this product.
UNK	"The screen size is big, key pad lit well enough, and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone."
UNK	There's really nothing bad I can say about this headset.
UNK	"i'm glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find, it wasn't high priced."
UNK	Portable and it works.
UNK	"My colleague & I now get great reception.A little expensive, but performance is great."
UNK	I even fully charged it before I went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wi-fi and noticed that it only had 20 % left in the morning.
UNK	I've also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which I always turn it on and then off again.
UNK	Not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses.
UNK	Timely shipment and quality product.
UNK	Nice solid keyboard.
UNK	Very well made and fits my Surefire GX2 perfectly.
UNK	Horrible phone.
UNK	BT50 battery junk!.
UNK	We would recommend these to others.
UNK	Cant get the software to work with my computer.
UNK	Disappointed!.
UNK	poor voice clarity.
UNK	The battery works great!
UNK	No buyers remorse on this one!.
UNK	Very disappointed in AccessoryOne.
UNK	I find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers.
UNK	"Looks great and is strong."""
UNK	"I have had TMobile service for 2 or 3 years now, and I am pretty happy with it."
UNK	The update procedure is difficult and cumbersome.
UNK	Disappointment.. I hate anything that goes in my ear.
UNK	Great software for Motorolas.
UNK	The delivery was on time.
UNK	Very easy to use.
UNK	"Uncomfortable In the Ear, Don't use with LG VX9900 (EnV)."
UNK	The volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown.
UNK	"It holds a charge for a long time, is reasonably comfortable under long-wearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous."
UNK	I'd like to return it.
UNK	The keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough I don't expect any problems.
UNK	"Verizon's bills, however, are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple."
UNK	"After charging overnight, these batteries work great."
UNK	You won't regret it!
UNK	I love this phone!.
UNK	A Disappointment.
UNK	Its not user friendly.
UNK	Unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect.
UNK	"Then I exchanged for the same phone, even that had the same problem."
UNK	This results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute.
UNK	This PDA rocks.
UNK	"It is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtop/camera/cellphone, and excels in those roles."
UNK	"I would definitely recommend the Jabra BT250v for those who are looking for comfort, clarity and a great price!"
UNK	I had Verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service.
UNK	Pretty piece of junk.
UNK	Plug was the wrong size.
UNK	Works as described.
UNK	Save your money.... I've had this item for 11 months now.
UNK	Bad Purchase.
UNK	WELL IM SATISFIED.
UNK	"The bose noise cancelling is amazing, which is very important for a NYC commuter."
UNK	This battery is an excellent bargain!
UNK	Defective crap.
UNK	I would have given no star if I was able.
UNK	I wear glasses and it fits fine with them.
UNK	"The sound quality for the device is unacceptable.Unless you are in a really quiet area, you almost hear nothing."
UNK	I would not recommend this item to anyone.
UNK	The holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad.
UNK	great...no problems at all!.
UNK	"As an earlier review noted, plug in this charger and nothing happens."
UNK	This frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching.
UNK	You never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not.
UNK	The sound is clear and the people I talk to on it are amazed at the quality too.
UNK	I got the aluminum case for my new Palm VX and it worked really well--it has protected my handheld perfectly so far.
UNK	"very good product, well made."
UNK	Mobile Phone Tools are a must have.
UNK	I am very impressed with the job that Motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone.
UNK	"I received my orders well within the shipping timeframe, everything was in good working order and overall, I am very excited to have this source."
UNK	The phone is sturdy and waterproof.
UNK	I am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone.
UNK	My only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5(of 5)
UNK	Thanks again to Amazon for having the things I need for a good price!
UNK	I ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead.
UNK	I had to go to a store and bought a new NOKIA phone which is working great.
UNK	Works great!.
UNK	REALLY UGLY.
UNK	"horrible, had to switch 3 times."
UNK	The noise shield is incrediable.
UNK	No real improvement.
UNK	Razr Battery - Good buy.
UNK	Keep up the good work Amazon!!
UNK	They refuse to refund or replace.
UNK	Unfortunately it's easy to accidentally activate them with the gentle-touch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening.
UNK	So I basically threw my money out the window for nothing.
UNK	Great case and price!
UNK	All it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was cracked.I am not impressed and I am not laughing.
UNK	"Bluetooth range is good - a few days ago I left my phone in the trunk, got a call, and carried the conversation without a hitch."
UNK	"Small, sleek, impressive looking, practical setup with ample storage in place."
UNK	The eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity.
UNK	none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly.
UNK	I am glad I purchased it.
UNK	I've missed numerous calls because of this reason.
UNK	"Perhaps my phone is defective, but people cannot hear me when I use this."
UNK	Don't buy this product.
UNK	"sucked, most of the stuff does not work with my phone."
UNK	"No shifting, no bubbling, no peeling, not even a scratch, NOTHING!I couldn't be more happier with my new one for the Droid."
UNK	Worst software ever used.... If I could give this zero stars I would.
UNK	Trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration.
UNK	The case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever.
UNK	"I own a Jabra Earset and was very happy with it, but the sound quality, especially outgoing, on this is better."
UNK	"I love the camera, it's really pretty good quality."
UNK	Thank you for such great service.
UNK	Its a total package.
UNK	"The seller is very understanding and patient, I would definitely buy from them again."
UNK	I give Wirefly 1 star.I will contact Cingular/AT&T; and inform them of this practice.
UNK	It's AGGRAVATING!
UNK	Great product for the price!.
UNK	"I have purchased these for both family and friends, and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use"
UNK	Virgin Wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone!
UNK	"None of it works, just don't buy it."
UNK	"Muddy, low quality sound, and the casing around the wire's insert was poorly super glued and slid off."
UNK	Please dont waste your money.
UNK	"All in all, I'm quite satisfied with this purchase."
UNK	"If you are looking for a good quality Motorola Headset keep looking, this isn't it."
UNK	Yet Plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design.
UNK	Disapointing Results.
UNK	Cumbersome design.
UNK	"Great it was new packaged nice works good, no problems and it came in less time then I expected!!!!"
UNK	Great Product.
UNK	It's A PIECE OF CRAP!
UNK	"My experience was terrible..... This was my fourth bluetooth headset, and while it was much more comfortable than my last Jabra (which I HATED!!!"
UNK	This fixes all the problems.
UNK	Worst ever.
UNK	I am very happy
UNK	"I've had no trouble accessing the Internet, downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions."
UNK	"I can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying ""what?"""
UNK	The battery life is highly unacceptable.
UNK	That company is a joke.
UNK	It does everything the description said it would.
UNK	Due to this happening on every call I was forced to stop using this headset.
UNK	"It works great with a car charger, especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time."
UNK	"Verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures, none of which worked and I ended up having to do a hard re-set, wiping out all my data."
UNK	"Voice Quality, Signal Strength, Dropped Calls."
UNK	"It plays louder than any other speaker of this size; the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking, however, it's not."
UNK	Better than expected.
UNK	"It feels poorly constructed, the menus are difficult to navigate, and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them."
UNK	Battery is holding up well.
UNK	Also difficult to put on.I'd recommend avoiding this product.
UNK	"I only used it two days, and it wasn't always easy to hear with."
UNK	I got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was broken...I went to plug it in and it started smoking.
UNK	Sprint - terrible customer service.
UNK	Linked to my phone without effort.
UNK	THey are so cool!
UNK	Easy to use.
UNK	Better Than New.
UNK	"What possesed me to get this junk, I have no idea..."
UNK	Piece of trash.
UNK	A pretty good product.
UNK	This is a great phone!.
UNK	"For the price on Amazon, it is an excellent product, which I would highly recommend."
UNK	Their Research and Development division obviously knows what they're doing.
UNK	"The real killer is the volume, and of course it breaking."
UNK	Those phones are working just fine now.
UNK	I am more than happy with this product.
UNK	Poor Construction.
UNK	This is infuriating.
UNK	"Overall, I would recommend this phone over the new Walkman."
UNK	Sprint charges for this service.
UNK	"It is cheap, and it feel and look just as cheap."
UNK	It fits my ear well and is comfortable on.
UNK	It doesn't work in Europe or Asia.
UNK	clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cent's up-and-coming.
UNK	I like design and look of Jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear.
UNK	I was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price.
UNK	the worst phone from samsung...crap..... this crappy Samsung E715.. is the worst i have ever seeen.
UNK	the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone.
UNK	Poor product.
UNK	However I needed some better instructions.
UNK	You need two hands to operate the screen.This software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs.
UNK	Worked very well paired with a Treo 700w and as a Skype headset on my PC (using a USB Bluetooth transceiver).
UNK	"Steer clear of this product and go with the genuine Palm replacementr pens, which come in a three-pack."
UNK	DO NOT BUY DO NOT BUYIT SUCKS
UNK	This is a great product..... sure beats using your fingers!.
UNK	"Plus, I seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point."
UNK	All the other cases I've tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul.
UNK	Very Dissapointing Performance.
UNK	Don't make the same mistake that I did and please don't buy this phone.
UNK	This phone might well be the worst I've ever had in any brand.
UNK	Case was more or less an extra that I originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear.
UNK	I recommend iGo to anyone with different brand cell phones/mp3 players in the family.
UNK	Don't bother - go to the store.
UNK	"I posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone, but i have the Fire Red and it's a great color!"
UNK	I did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed.
UNK	You get what you pay for I guess.
UNK	"Not only did the software do a great job of this, I could also make my own ringtones form my existing CDs without an internet connection."
UNK	im surprised this is a good quality car charger and there's not much reviews about it.
UNK	These are fabulous!
UNK	"However, BT headsets are currently not good for real time games like first-person shooters since the audio delay messes me up."
UNK	I used bitpim (a free program you can find on the internet)to transfer data to the phone.The price of the cable was excellent.
UNK	Disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer.
UNK	"Performed awful -- muffled, tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call."
UNK	Very wind-resistant.
UNK	"Obviously they have a terrible customer service, so you get what you pay for."
UNK	"They do not last forever, but is not overly expensive to replace.Easy to operate and the sound is much better than others I have tried."
UNK	"I contacted the company and they told me that, although the unit was still under warranty, if I couldn't produce my receipt I was out of luck."
UNK	Linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something!
UNK	Phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are.
UNK	Great phone.
UNK	"When I placed my treo into the case, not only was it NOT snug, but there was A LOT of extra room on the sides."
UNK	I'm pleased.
UNK	Battery is terrible.
UNK	I found the product to be easy to set up and use.
UNK	The earpiece on this is too large or too heavy...it keeps falling out of my ear.
UNK	Utter crap.. Sound quality is TERRIBLE.
UNK	"The charger arrived within the promised timeframe, but it did not work."
UNK	"No ear loop needed, it's tiny and the sound is great."
UNK	"Finally, after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and I could not use it any longer on the visor."
UNK	"The handsfree part works fine, but then the car tries to download the address book, and the Treo reboots.Overall, I still rate this device high."
UNK	Talk about USELESS customer service.
UNK	"It felt too light and ""tinny.""."
UNK	This does not fit the Palm Tungsten E2 and it broke the first time I tried to plug it in.
UNK	I'm happy about this purchase- good quality and low price.
UNK	I love the look and feel of Samsung flipphones.
UNK	Its well-designed and very sharp -- the blue is a very nice color.
UNK	Does everything it should and more.
UNK	I could not recommend these more.
UNK	Nice Sound.
UNK	"Looks good in the picture, but this case was a huge disappointment!!"
UNK	Much less than the jawbone I was going to replace it with.
UNK	Setup went very smoothly.
UNK	its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it.
UNK	"A must study for anyone interested in the ""worst sins"" of industrial design."
UNK	The first thing that happened was that the tracking was off.
UNK	"It is well made, easy to access the phone and has a handy, detachable belt clip."
UNK	Then I had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping.
UNK	Can't upload ringtones from a third party.
UNK	"Bluetooth does not work, phone locks up, screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked."
UNK	Truly awful.
UNK	"It works fine on my Motorola 325 cellphone, and a lot better than the worn-out battery did."
UNK	The volume for the ringer is REAL good (you have choices how loud).
UNK	And none of the tones is acceptable.
UNK	camera color balance is AWFUL.
UNK	"This product is clearly not ready for prime time, I don't care how cool it looks, if you can't tell a call is coming in it's worthless."
UNK	I love the ringtones because they are so upbeat!
UNK	Chinese Forgeries Abound!.
UNK	Easy to pair with my Samsung Cell.
UNK	The instructions didn't explain that a microphone jack could be used.
UNK	i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well.
UNK	Too bad you have to pay up to $$$ a month for the service!
UNK	Works well.
UNK	The nokia CA-42 USB cable did not work with my phone.
UNK	Clear crisp sound.
UNK	"I have to use the smallest earpieces provided, but it stays on pretty well."
UNK	"The biggest complaint I have is, the battery drains superfast."
UNK	The design might be ergonomic in theory but I could not stand having these in my ear.
UNK	Do NOT buy if you want to use the holster.
UNK	The phone can also take great pictures and even video clips.
UNK	It doesn't make you look cool.
UNK	"Because both ears are occupied, background is not distracting at all."
UNK	"Comfortable fit - you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time, if not for an entire day."
UNK	"Also, the phone doesn't seem to accept anything except CBR mp3s, preferably ripped by Windows Media Player."
UNK	You can't beat the price on these.
UNK	"* Comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots, and even flash SOS signals (seriously!"
UNK	lightweight and works well.
UNK	So just beware.
UNK	I love this cable - it allows me to connect any mini-USB device to my PC.
UNK	So anyone near you will hear part of your conversation.
UNK	This is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up.
UNK	I bought this phone as a replacement for my StarTac and have regretted it since.
UNK	Appears to actually outperform the original battery from China that came with my V325i.
UNK	Can't store anything but phone numbers to SIM.
UNK	"It lasts less than 3o minutes, if I actually try to use the phone.My wife has the same phone with the same problem."
UNK	Poor quality.
UNK	"jabra ear gels ""R"" the best!."
UNK	Not worth it.
UNK	The phone crashed completely and now I have to get it replaced.
UNK	"It quit working after I'd used it for about 18 months, so I just purchased another one because this is the best headset I've ever owned."
UNK	"Unfortunately it will not recharge my iPhone 4s, despite connecting it from multiple power sources (iMac, external battery, wall outlet, etc)."
UNK	It was a great phone.
UNK	if you simply want a small flip phone -- look elsewhere as the extra bells & whistles are mediocre.
UNK	"Good value, works fine - power via USB, car, or wall outlet."
UNK	My phone doesn't slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand.
UNK	This is simply the BEST bluetooth headset for sound quality!
UNK	Think it over when you plan to own this one!This sure is the last MOTO phone for me!
UNK	"In the span of an hour, I had two people exclaim ""Whoa - is that the new phone on TV?!?"
UNK	I have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful.
UNK	"This case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear, it is 100% functional."
UNK	"Other than that, the leather is nice and soft; the fit is very tight; the cut out for the face is a good shape."
UNK	It has everything I need and I couldn't ask for more.
UNK	After receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke.
UNK	This product is great... it makes working a lot easier I can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something.
UNK	None of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears.
UNK	T-Mobile has the best customer service anywhere.
UNK	Arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold.
UNK	We have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months.. Pros
UNK	"Provides good protection and looks classy, too."
UNK	Krussel Always good.
UNK	"The tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate, etc."
UNK	The design is very good.4.
UNK	I great reception all the time.
UNK	I would highly recommend this product.
UNK	"Couldn't use the unit with sunglasses, not good in Texas!"
UNK	It dit not work most of the time with my Nokia 5320.
UNK	"Bought mainly for the charger, which broke soon after purchasing."
UNK	"If you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations, then this phone is for you!"
UNK	Fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is
UNK	"stay away from this store, be careful."
UNK	This BlueAnt Supertooth hands-free phone speaker is AWESOME.
UNK	Does not fit.
UNK	.... Item arrived quickly and works great with my Metro PCS Samsung SCH-r450 slider phone and Sony Premium Sound in ear plugs.
UNK	"It is light, has plenty of battery capacity, and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time."
UNK	disappointing.
UNK	Blue Ant is easy to use.
UNK	Cheap but hey it works.. Was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item.
UNK	The camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors... I'd rather be using a disposable then this.
UNK	Then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use.
UNK	It's very convenient and simple to use - gets job done & makes the car ride so much smoother.
UNK	The nano stated it.My son was dissapointed.
UNK	The sound quality is excellent as well.
UNK	Its the best headset I have used.
UNK	Would not reccommend.
UNK	They have been around for years and carries the highest quality of anti-glare screen protector that I have found to date.
UNK	Just what I wanted.
UNK	This particular model would not work with my Motorola Q smartphone.
UNK	wont work right or atleast for me.
UNK	in addition it feels &amp; looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic.
UNK	"But now that it is ""out of warranty"" the same problems reoccure.Bottom line... put your money somewhere else... Cingular will not support it."
UNK	"I really wanted the Plantronics 510 to be the right one, but it has too many issues for me.The good"
UNK	Great product.
UNK	Crisp and Clear.
UNK	AFter the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes.
UNK	"VERY cheap plastic, creaks like an old wooden floor."
UNK	"I get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment, where with other phones I have not had this problem."
UNK	The reception has been generally good.
UNK	"Excellent sound, battery life and inconspicuous to boot!."
UNK	Great bluetooth!.
UNK	I highly recommend this case.
UNK	WORTHWHILE.
UNK	This is a great deal.
UNK	"After my phone got to be about a year old, it's been slowly breaking despite much care on my part."
UNK	I am sorry I made this purchase.
UNK	I bought these hoping I could make my Bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear.
UNK	Treo and T-Mobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount.
UNK	It was horrible!.
UNK	I don't think it would hold it too securly on your belt.
UNK	This allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first.
UNK	They work about 2 weeks then break.
UNK	It is simple to use and I like it.
UNK	"It's a great tool for entertainment, communication, and data management.Oh, be sure to use ActiveSync 4.2 for optimal data synchronization results!"
UNK	I can't use this case because the smell is disgusting.
UNK	NOT WHAT I WANTED.
UNK	I own 2 of these cases and would order another.
UNK	Great Phone.
UNK	I bought this battery with a coupon from Amazon and I'm very happy with my purchase.
UNK	"The internet access was fine, it the rare instance that it worked."
UNK	Perfect for the PS3.
UNK	"Five star Plus, plus."
UNK	A good quality bargain.. I bought this after I bought a cheapy from Big Lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldn't hear me.
UNK	$50 Down the drain.
UNK	I tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and I was still told it wasn't great.
UNK	"Good , works fine."
UNK	For the price this was a great deal.
UNK	"Great price, too!"
UNK	"If there is a wind, it is completely useless."
UNK	Yes it's shiny on front side - and I love it!
UNK	Does Not Work.
UNK	"At first I thought I was grtting a good deal at $7.44, until I plugged it into my phone (V3c Razr)."
UNK	The reception through this headset is excellent.
UNK	2 thumbs up to this seller
UNK	"I have a Verizon LG phone and they work well together, good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight."
UNK	Improper description.... I had to return it.
UNK	#1 It Works - #2 It is Comfortable.
UNK	Battery charge-life is quite long.
UNK	The Jabra EarGels fit my ears very well.
UNK	Battery has no life.
UNK	I checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing.
UNK	Product is exactly as described.
UNK	Gets a signal when other Verizon phones won't.
UNK	Doesn't do the job.
UNK	I would recommend it.
UNK	Plan on ordering from them again and again.
UNK	"That being said, for a phone, the camera is very nice; many cool effects to play with, and video is decent as well."
UNK	I have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one.
UNK	They keep getting better and better (this is my third one and I've had numerous Palms too).
UNK	Awkward to use and unreliable.
UNK	The shipping time was also very quick!
UNK	Not as good as I had hoped.
UNK	Good case!.
UNK	Doesn't Work.
UNK	Really good product.
UNK	Unfortunately it did not work.
UNK	All three broke within two months of use.
UNK	dont buy it.
UNK	"My father has the V265, and the battery is dying."
UNK	"However, the ear pads come off easily and after only one week I lost one."
UNK	"The calls drop, the phone comes on and off at will, the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently."
UNK	"Horrible, horrible protector."
UNK	I don't like this Nokia either.
UNK	"Reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable, and the send and end keys are not where I expect them to be.3."
UNK	I have bought this Nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare.
UNK	It would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with Amazon.
UNK	the only VERY DISAPPOINTING thing was there was NO SPEAKERPHONE!!!!
UNK	Terrible.. My car will not accept this cassette.
UNK	"Product is useless, since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones I was planning to use it with."
UNK	It's not what it says it is.
UNK	Stay Away From the Q!.
UNK	Used and dirty.
UNK	Very unreliable service from T-mobile !
UNK	Not good enough for the price.
UNK	I bought two of them and neither will charge.
UNK	It looks very nice.
UNK	"This is an excellent tool, especially when paired with your phone's auto-answer."
UNK	I have read other's reviews here but I haven't had any problem with it.
UNK	These products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet.
UNK	Comfortable in my hand.
UNK	Just does not work.
UNK	Poor Reliability.
UNK	(It works!)
UNK	"If I take a picture, the battery drops a bar, and starts beeping, letting me know its dieing."
UNK	"Terrible product, and waste of money!"
UNK	Last time buying from you.
UNK	It was a waste of my money.
UNK	So far it has worked like a charm.
UNK	"I have only had it for a few weeks, but so far, so good."
UNK	"But, in any case, the best part is, you can download these pictures to your laptop using IR, or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone."
UNK	Would recommend this item.
UNK	It's been my choice headset for years.Great sound; good volume; good noise cancellation.
UNK	"Nice case, feels good in your hands."
UNK	The item received was Counterfeit.
UNK	"Just really good.. So far, probably the best BT headset I have ever had."
UNK	Works fine.
UNK	I received my headset in good time and was happy with it.
UNK	I was very pleased to see that I could replace my well travled swivel holster for my Blackberry flip.
UNK	My sister has one also and she loves it.
UNK	Good Quality.
UNK	This is by far the worst purchase I've made on Amazon.
UNK	Excellent dual-purpose headset.
UNK	Excellent!.
UNK	Does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125.
UNK	"It seems completely secure, both holding on to my belt, and keeping the iPhone inside."
UNK	"The bottowm line...another worthless, cheap gimmick from Sprint."
UNK	Having trouble with volume.
UNK	The only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears.
UNK	WARNING - DO NOT BUY!!.
UNK	"I am pairing this with my iphone, and I could not be happier with it so far."
UNK	"When it opens, the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off."
UNK	"I didn't want the clip going over the top of my ear, causing discomfort."
UNK	Best headset ever!!!.
UNK	Don't trust their website and don't expect any helpful support.
UNK	It was that loud.Glad to say that the Plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use.
UNK	The speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap.
UNK	"Fits comfortably, came with three sizes of earbud tips."
UNK	Excellent product for the price.
UNK	Bad Reception.
UNK	This product is very High quality Chinese CRAP!!!!!!
UNK	It was quite comfortable in the ear.
UNK	Great phone.
UNK	Don't buy this product - It fails!.
UNK	Everything about this product is wrong.First
UNK	The pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before I started making calls with the voice dialing feature.
UNK	"This was utterly confusing at first, which caused me to lose a couple of very, very important contacts."
UNK	Terrible phone holder.
UNK	The cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly.
UNK	I love being able to use one headset for both by land-line and cell.
UNK	Problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily.
UNK	Not nearly as good looking as the AMAZON picture makes it look.
UNK	"But despite these few flaws, this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official OEM product."
UNK	How stupid is that?
UNK	"I can hear while I'm driving in the car, and usually don't even have to put it on it's loudest setting."
UNK	Seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors.
UNK	"Good show, Samsung."
UNK	So I bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money.
UNK	It always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed.
UNK	Couldn't figure it out
UNK	"My phone sounded OK ( not great - OK), but my wife's phone was almost totally unintelligible, she couldn't understand a word being said on it."
UNK	So I had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it.
UNK	"While I managed to bend the leaf spring back in place, the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop."
UNK	Leopard Print is wonderfully wild!.
UNK	Works for me.
UNK	"Saggy, floppy piece of junk."
UNK	much better than the hard plastic cases.
UNK	It also had a new problem.
UNK	Happy so far!.
UNK	cool phone.
UNK	Works good.
UNK	Motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right.
UNK	It looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two.
UNK	"but it is great, i would really recommend it"
UNK	Makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when I'm not wearing it.
UNK	As I said above....PRETTY USELESS!
UNK	Never got it!!!!!
UNK	This pair of headphones is the worst that I have ever had sound-wise.
UNK	[...] down the drain because of a weak snap!
UNK	Does not charge the Cingular (ATT) 8525 phone.
UNK	"You get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off."""
UNK	"However, after about a year, the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and I couldn't receive and place calls."
UNK	I kept catching the cable on the seat and I had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off.
UNK	The headset fulfills my requirements so I am happy with my purchase.
UNK	Logitech Bluetooth Headset is a 10!.
UNK	"I like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear, rather than inside."
UNK	A lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do I.
UNK	I have tried these cables with my computer and my iPod and it works just fine.
UNK	"The mic there is a joke, and the volume is quite low."
UNK	I'm returning them.
UNK	I does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap.
UNK	It is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable.
UNK	I have had mine for about a year and this Christmas I bought some for the rest of the family.
UNK	"Otherwise, easy to install and use, clear sound."
UNK	nice leather.
UNK	I had to purchase a different case.
UNK	It is a joy to use.
UNK	Very much disappointed with this company.
UNK	Very satisifed with that.
UNK	It didn't charge for me.
UNK	This is the phone to get for 2005.... I just bought my S710a and all I can say is WOW!
UNK	Buttons are too small.
UNK	Just reading on the specs alone makes you say WOW.
UNK	Love it.. Great armband.
UNK	I really like this product over the Motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic.
UNK	"However, the keypads are so tinny that I sometimes reach the wrong buttons."
UNK	I exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and I'm pretty happy with that decision.
UNK	I was very impressed with the price of the cases.
UNK	Also makes it easier to hold on to.
UNK	"I use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment, and it works great!"
UNK	It's pretty easy.
UNK	I cannot make calls at certain places.
UNK	"however, my girl was complain that some time the phone doesn't wake up like normal phone does."
UNK	Beautiful styling though.
UNK	This company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back.
UNK	I'm trying to return it for a refund.
UNK	I plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked.
UNK	Excellent product.
UNK	Earbud piece breaks easily.
UNK	Lousy product.
UNK	This phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at it's very ability to be a phone.
UNK	It is the best charger I have seen on the market yet.
UNK	SWEETEST PHONE!!!
UNK	":-)Oh, the charger seems to work fine."
UNK	It fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal.
UNK	Not enough volume.
UNK	Echo Problem....Very unsatisfactory
UNK	you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor.
UNK	don't waste your money.
UNK	I am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product.
UNK	Adapter does not provide enough charging current.
UNK	"There was so much hype over this phone that I assumed it was the best, my mistake."
UNK	You also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered.
UNK	Phone falls out easily.
UNK	"It didn't work, people can not hear me when I talk."
UNK	The text messaging feature is really tricky to use.
UNK	I'm really disappointed all I have now is a charger that doesn't work.
UNK	Painful on the ear.
UNK	Lasted one day and then blew up.
UNK	disappointed.
UNK	Kind of flops around.
UNK	The screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face.
UNK	What a piece of junk.. I lose more calls on this phone.
UNK	Item Does Not Match Picture.
UNK	The only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port (irda).
UNK	"You can not answer calls with the unit, never worked once!"
