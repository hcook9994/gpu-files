UNK:UNK	WORST PHONE EVER.
UNK:UNK	I'm still infatuated with this phone.
UNK:UNK	Freezes frequently4.
UNK:UNK	It's kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly it's embarrassing how child-like the company is.
UNK:UNK	"Simple, lightweight and great fit."
UNK:UNK	"All in all, I'd expected a better consumer experience from Motorola."
UNK:UNK	There's a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that I have never experienced before.
UNK:UNK	These are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent.
UNK:UNK	I usually don't like headbands but this one is very lightweight & doesn't mess up my hair.

UNK:UNK	Worth every penny.
UNK:UNK	Excellent wallet type phone case.
UNK:UNK	Nice headphones for the price and they work great!
UNK:UNK	Internet is excrutiatingly slow.
UNK:UNK	"It is very comfortable to wear as well, which is probably the most important aspect about using a case."

UNK:UNK	O my gosh the best phone I have ever had.
UNK:UNK	It's very attractive and appears to be of good quality.
UNK:UNK	I love all the features and form factor.
UNK:UNK	This product had a strong rubber/petroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it

UNK:UNK	This one works and was priced right.
UNK:UNK	Customer service was terrible.
UNK:UNK	Battery life still not long enough in Motorola Razor V3i.
UNK:UNK	Sending it back.
UNK:UNK	Now I know that I made a wise decision.
UNK:UNK	Someone shouldve invented this sooner.
UNK:UNK	Good price.
UNK:UNK	Everything worked on the first try.The device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good.
UNK:UNK	I received it quickly and it works great!!
UNK:UNK	Has been working great.
UNK:UNK	"As many people complained, I found this headset's microphone was very weak."
UNK:UNK	My 5-year old Nokia 2160 from Tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this.
UNK:UNK	They do not care about the consumer one bit.
UNK:UNK	"This is a good battery, and it got here really fast."
UNK:UNK	The instruction manual is lacking.
UNK:UNK	Also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case.
UNK:UNK	Phone now holds charge like it did when it was new.
UNK:UNK	The battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena.
UNK:UNK	It's uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone (Razr) or with my previous wired headset (that plugged into an LG).
UNK:UNK	We have gotten a lot of compliments on it.
UNK:UNK	This is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving.
UNK:UNK	I want my money back.
UNK:UNK	I love this device.
UNK:UNK	I am also very happy with the price.
UNK:UNK	I ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately.
UNK:UNK	The Ngage is still lacking in earbuds.
UNK:UNK	I was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem.
UNK:UNK	"I have 2-3 bars on my cell phone when I am home, but you cant not hear anything."
UNK:UNK	"good item, low price."
UNK:UNK	"However-the riingtones are not the best, and neither are the games."
UNK:UNK	The plug did not work very well.
UNK:UNK	AMAZON SUCKS.
UNK:UNK	Rip off---- Over charge shipping.
UNK:UNK	VERY comfortable.
UNK:UNK	The battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago.
UNK:UNK	The reception is excellent!
UNK:UNK	"It fits comfortably in either ear, the sound is clear and loud, and the charge lasts a couple of days."
UNK:UNK	"very clear, quality sound and you don't have to mess with the sound on your iPod since you have the sound buttons on the headset."
UNK:UNK	1. long lasting battery (you don't have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones)2.
UNK:UNK	Obviously there is a problem with the adhesive.
UNK:UNK	Very disappointing.
UNK:UNK	"It was an inexpensive piece, but I would still have expected better quality."
UNK:UNK	It is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after I bought it.
UNK:UNK	Excellent sound quality.
UNK:UNK	Was not happy.
UNK:UNK	A PIECE OF JUNK THAT BROKE AFTER BEING ON MY PHONE FOR 2 DAYS!!!
UNK:UNK	New Battery works great in phone.
UNK:UNK	Worst customer service.
UNK:UNK	"I've dropped my phone more times than I can say, even on concrete and my phone is still great (knock on wood!)."
UNK:UNK	Reception is terrible and full of static.
UNK:UNK	Good audio quality.
UNK:UNK	This little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier.
UNK:UNK	"I was sitting in my vehicle, with the cradle on my belt, and the headset lost signal."
UNK:UNK	Were JERKS on the phone.
UNK:UNK	Works like a charm.. Works as advertised.
UNK:UNK	"Comfortable, Nice Range, Good Battery Life."
UNK:UNK	Their network coverage in Los Angeles is horrible.
UNK:UNK	Excellent starter wireless headset.
UNK:UNK	"The loudspeaker option is great, the bumpers with the lights is very ... appealing."
UNK:UNK	The only thing that I think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset.
UNK:UNK	"First off the reception sucks, I have never had more than 2 bars, ever."
UNK:UNK	The phone gets EXTREMELY HOT!
UNK:UNK	"The microphone also works well, but (according to people I have called) it applifies everything."
UNK:UNK	Nice design and quality.
UNK:UNK	"Also, if your phone is dropped, this case is not going to save it, specially when dropped face down."
UNK:UNK	"It is light, easy to use, and has very clear reception and transmission."
UNK:UNK	"bad fit, way too big."
UNK:UNK	It definitely was not as good as my S11.
UNK:UNK	awesome device.
UNK:UNK	Waste of money.
UNK:UNK	"I had ordered a motorola data cable, got a very well finished and working product."
UNK:UNK	Love This Phone.
UNK:UNK	I was looking for this headset for a long time and now that I've got it I couldn't be happier.
UNK:UNK	"I'll be drivng along, and my headset starts ringing for no reason."
UNK:UNK	Display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year.
UNK:UNK	Battery life is also great!
UNK:UNK	The worst phone I've ever had.... Only had it for a few months.
UNK:UNK	Not a good item.. It worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player.
UNK:UNK	This is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if I try to push the ear plug into my ear.
UNK:UNK	Protects the phone on all sides.
UNK:UNK	This is a VERY average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network.
UNK:UNK	"Clear Skype Calls, Long Battery Life, Long Range."
UNK:UNK	Soyo technology sucks.
UNK:UNK	Great Hands Free Device.
UNK:UNK	"you can even take self portraits with the outside (exterior) display, very cool."
UNK:UNK	Same problem as others have mentioned.
UNK:UNK	After trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well.
UNK:UNK	Magical Help.
UNK:UNK	The worst piece of crap ever along with the Verizon customer service.
UNK:UNK	Poor sound quality.
UNK:UNK	The best phone in market :).
UNK:UNK	It worked very well.
UNK:UNK	The company shipped my product very promptly and it works well.
UNK:UNK	Exactly what I wanted.
UNK:UNK	The picture resolution is far below what other comparably-priced phones are offering today.
UNK:UNK	This is a great deal.
UNK:UNK	"Excellent product, I am very satisfied with the purchase."
UNK:UNK	I highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try.
UNK:UNK	Better than you'd expect.
UNK:UNK	"Using all earpieces, left or right, this thing will not stay on my ear."
UNK:UNK	Great product and price.
UNK:UNK	"Sounds good reasonably priced and effective, Its that simple !"
UNK:UNK	Still Waiting...... I'm sure this item would work well.. if I ever recieve it!
UNK:UNK	what a disappointment
UNK:UNK	Very prompt service.
UNK:UNK	Excellent product for the price.
UNK:UNK	Very pleased with this headset.
UNK:UNK	don't waste your money and time.
UNK:UNK	I especially love the long battery life.
UNK:UNK	"It's so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers, car chargers, cradles, headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out."
UNK:UNK	Works great.
UNK:UNK	Plantronics Bluetooth Excelent Buy.
UNK:UNK	I came over from Verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones.... the first thing I noticed was the really bad service.
UNK:UNK	I'll be looking for a new earpiece.
UNK:UNK	I highly recommend this device to everyone!
UNK:UNK	Jawbone Era is awesome too!
UNK:UNK	We received a WHITE colored battery that goes DEAD after a couple hoursTHe original used to last a week - but still lasts longer than thereplacement
UNK:UNK	After a year the battery went completely dead on my headset.
UNK:UNK	"I have used several phone in two years, but this one is the best."
UNK:UNK	An Awesome New Look For Fall 2000!.
UNK:UNK	This is the first phone I've had that has been so cheaply made.
UNK:UNK	"Att is not clear, sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk."
UNK:UNK	The plastic breaks really easy on this clip.
UNK:UNK	Price is good too.
UNK:UNK	Don't make the same mistake I did.
UNK:UNK	Oh and I forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone.
UNK:UNK	I'm using it with an iriver SPINN (with case) and it fits fine.
UNK:UNK	Also the area where my unit broke).- I'm not too fond of the magnetic strap.
UNK:UNK	"Overall, I am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception."
UNK:UNK	"every thing on phone work perfectly, she like it."
UNK:UNK	"Another note about this phone's appearance is that it really looks rather bland, especially in the all black model."
UNK:UNK	IT'S REALLY EASY.
UNK:UNK	My Sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect.
UNK:UNK	Fantastic earphones.
UNK:UNK	It finds my cell phone right away when I enter the car.
UNK:UNK	Low Quality.
UNK:UNK	I highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone.
UNK:UNK	But it does get better reception and clarity than any phone I've had before.
UNK:UNK	Warning - Stay away.
UNK:UNK	I wish I could return the unit and get back my money.
UNK:UNK	Awsome Device Works Great!!.
UNK:UNK	I used to talk on it for 1 - 1 1/2 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying.
UNK:UNK	"If you don't find it, too bad, as again the unit comes with one earpad only.I would not recommend this to anyone."
UNK:UNK	Very Displeased.
UNK:UNK	"I might have gotten a defect, but I would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone."
UNK:UNK	They made this case too small and is very difficult to install.
UNK:UNK	Restored my phone to like new performance.
UNK:UNK	"I would recommend purchasing the Jabra JX-10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my Moto Q, go figure."
UNK:UNK	"I searched the Internet, and found this one to be the best value."
UNK:UNK	Does not fit.
UNK:UNK	Very happy with this product.
UNK:UNK	"The screen size is big, key pad lit well enough, and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone."
UNK:UNK	There's really nothing bad I can say about this headset.
UNK:UNK	"i'm glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find, it wasn't high priced."
UNK:UNK	Portable and it works.
UNK:UNK	"My colleague & I now get great reception.A little expensive, but performance is great."
UNK:UNK	I even fully charged it before I went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wi-fi and noticed that it only had 20 % left in the morning.
UNK:UNK	I've also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which I always turn it on and then off again.
UNK:UNK	Not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses.
UNK:UNK	Timely shipment and quality product.
UNK:UNK	Nice solid keyboard.
UNK:UNK	Very well made and fits my Surefire GX2 perfectly.
UNK:UNK	Horrible phone.
UNK:UNK	BT50 battery junk!.
UNK:UNK	We would recommend these to others.
UNK:UNK	Cant get the software to work with my computer.
UNK:UNK	Disappointed!.
UNK:UNK	poor voice clarity.
UNK:UNK	The battery works great!
UNK:UNK	No buyers remorse on this one!.
UNK:UNK	Very disappointed in AccessoryOne.
UNK:UNK	I find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers.
UNK:UNK	"Looks great and is strong."""
UNK:UNK	"I have had TMobile service for 2 or 3 years now, and I am pretty happy with it."
UNK:UNK	The update procedure is difficult and cumbersome.
UNK:UNK	Disappointment.. I hate anything that goes in my ear.
UNK:UNK	Great software for Motorolas.
UNK:UNK	The delivery was on time.
UNK:UNK	Very easy to use.
UNK:UNK	"Uncomfortable In the Ear, Don't use with LG VX9900 (EnV)."
UNK:UNK	The volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown.
UNK:UNK	"It holds a charge for a long time, is reasonably comfortable under long-wearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous."
UNK:UNK	I'd like to return it.
UNK:UNK	The keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough I don't expect any problems.
UNK:UNK	"Verizon's bills, however, are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple."
UNK:UNK	"After charging overnight, these batteries work great."
UNK:UNK	You won't regret it!
UNK:UNK	I love this phone!.
UNK:UNK	A Disappointment.
UNK:UNK	Its not user friendly.
UNK:UNK	Unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect.
UNK:UNK	"Then I exchanged for the same phone, even that had the same problem."
UNK:UNK	This results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute.
UNK:UNK	This PDA rocks.
UNK:UNK	"It is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtop/camera/cellphone, and excels in those roles."
UNK:UNK	"I would definitely recommend the Jabra BT250v for those who are looking for comfort, clarity and a great price!"
UNK:UNK	I had Verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service.
UNK:UNK	Pretty piece of junk.
UNK:UNK	Plug was the wrong size.
UNK:UNK	Works as described.
UNK:UNK	Save your money.... I've had this item for 11 months now.
UNK:UNK	Bad Purchase.
UNK:UNK	WELL IM SATISFIED.
UNK:UNK	"The bose noise cancelling is amazing, which is very important for a NYC commuter."
UNK:UNK	This battery is an excellent bargain!
UNK:UNK	Defective crap.
UNK:UNK	I would have given no star if I was able.
UNK:UNK	I wear glasses and it fits fine with them.
UNK:UNK	"The sound quality for the device is unacceptable.Unless you are in a really quiet area, you almost hear nothing."
UNK:UNK	I would not recommend this item to anyone.
UNK:UNK	The holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad.
UNK:UNK	great...no problems at all!.
UNK:UNK	"As an earlier review noted, plug in this charger and nothing happens."
UNK:UNK	This frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching.
UNK:UNK	You never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not.
UNK:UNK	The sound is clear and the people I talk to on it are amazed at the quality too.
UNK:UNK	I got the aluminum case for my new Palm VX and it worked really well--it has protected my handheld perfectly so far.
UNK:UNK	"very good product, well made."
UNK:UNK	Mobile Phone Tools are a must have.
UNK:UNK	I am very impressed with the job that Motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone.
UNK:UNK	"I received my orders well within the shipping timeframe, everything was in good working order and overall, I am very excited to have this source."
UNK:UNK	The phone is sturdy and waterproof.
UNK:UNK	I am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone.
UNK:UNK	My only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5(of 5)
UNK:UNK	Thanks again to Amazon for having the things I need for a good price!
UNK:UNK	I ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead.
UNK:UNK	I had to go to a store and bought a new NOKIA phone which is working great.
UNK:UNK	Works great!.
UNK:UNK	REALLY UGLY.
UNK:UNK	"horrible, had to switch 3 times."
UNK:UNK	The noise shield is incrediable.
UNK:UNK	No real improvement.
UNK:UNK	Razr Battery - Good buy.
UNK:UNK	Keep up the good work Amazon!!
UNK:UNK	They refuse to refund or replace.
UNK:UNK	Unfortunately it's easy to accidentally activate them with the gentle-touch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening.
UNK:UNK	So I basically threw my money out the window for nothing.
UNK:UNK	Great case and price!
UNK:UNK	All it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was cracked.I am not impressed and I am not laughing.
UNK:UNK	"Bluetooth range is good - a few days ago I left my phone in the trunk, got a call, and carried the conversation without a hitch."
UNK:UNK	"Small, sleek, impressive looking, practical setup with ample storage in place."
UNK:UNK	The eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity.
UNK:UNK	none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly.
UNK:UNK	I am glad I purchased it.
UNK:UNK	I've missed numerous calls because of this reason.
UNK:UNK	"Perhaps my phone is defective, but people cannot hear me when I use this."
UNK:UNK	Don't buy this product.
UNK:UNK	"sucked, most of the stuff does not work with my phone."
UNK:UNK	"No shifting, no bubbling, no peeling, not even a scratch, NOTHING!I couldn't be more happier with my new one for the Droid."
UNK:UNK	Worst software ever used.... If I could give this zero stars I would.
UNK:UNK	Trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration.
UNK:UNK	The case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever.
UNK:UNK	"I own a Jabra Earset and was very happy with it, but the sound quality, especially outgoing, on this is better."
UNK:UNK	"I love the camera, it's really pretty good quality."
UNK:UNK	Thank you for such great service.
UNK:UNK	Its a total package.
UNK:UNK	"The seller is very understanding and patient, I would definitely buy from them again."
UNK:UNK	I give Wirefly 1 star.I will contact Cingular/AT&T; and inform them of this practice.
UNK:UNK	It's AGGRAVATING!
UNK:UNK	Great product for the price!.
UNK:UNK	"I have purchased these for both family and friends, and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use"
UNK:UNK	Virgin Wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone!
UNK:UNK	"None of it works, just don't buy it."
UNK:UNK	"Muddy, low quality sound, and the casing around the wire's insert was poorly super glued and slid off."
UNK:UNK	Please dont waste your money.
UNK:UNK	"All in all, I'm quite satisfied with this purchase."
UNK:UNK	"If you are looking for a good quality Motorola Headset keep looking, this isn't it."
UNK:UNK	Yet Plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design.
UNK:UNK	Disapointing Results.
UNK:UNK	Cumbersome design.
UNK:UNK	"Great it was new packaged nice works good, no problems and it came in less time then I expected!!!!"
UNK:UNK	Great Product.
UNK:UNK	It's A PIECE OF CRAP!
UNK:UNK	"My experience was terrible..... This was my fourth bluetooth headset, and while it was much more comfortable than my last Jabra (which I HATED!!!"
UNK:UNK	This fixes all the problems.
UNK:UNK	Worst ever.
UNK:UNK	I am very happy
UNK:UNK	"I've had no trouble accessing the Internet, downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions."
UNK:UNK	"I can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying ""what?"""
UNK:UNK	The battery life is highly unacceptable.
UNK:UNK	That company is a joke.
UNK:UNK	It does everything the description said it would.
UNK:UNK	Due to this happening on every call I was forced to stop using this headset.
UNK:UNK	"It works great with a car charger, especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time."
UNK:UNK	"Verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures, none of which worked and I ended up having to do a hard re-set, wiping out all my data."
UNK:UNK	"Voice Quality, Signal Strength, Dropped Calls."
UNK:UNK	"It plays louder than any other speaker of this size; the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking, however, it's not."
UNK:UNK	Better than expected.
UNK:UNK	"It feels poorly constructed, the menus are difficult to navigate, and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them."
UNK:UNK	Battery is holding up well.
UNK:UNK	Also difficult to put on.I'd recommend avoiding this product.
UNK:UNK	"I only used it two days, and it wasn't always easy to hear with."
UNK:UNK	I got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was broken...I went to plug it in and it started smoking.
UNK:UNK	Sprint - terrible customer service.
UNK:UNK	Linked to my phone without effort.
UNK:UNK	THey are so cool!
UNK:UNK	Easy to use.
UNK:UNK	Better Than New.
UNK:UNK	"What possesed me to get this junk, I have no idea..."
UNK:UNK	Piece of trash.
UNK:UNK	A pretty good product.
UNK:UNK	This is a great phone!.
UNK:UNK	"For the price on Amazon, it is an excellent product, which I would highly recommend."
UNK:UNK	Their Research and Development division obviously knows what they're doing.
UNK:UNK	"The real killer is the volume, and of course it breaking."
UNK:UNK	Those phones are working just fine now.
UNK:UNK	I am more than happy with this product.
UNK:UNK	Poor Construction.
UNK:UNK	This is infuriating.
UNK:UNK	"Overall, I would recommend this phone over the new Walkman."
UNK:UNK	Sprint charges for this service.
UNK:UNK	"It is cheap, and it feel and look just as cheap."
UNK:UNK	It fits my ear well and is comfortable on.
UNK:UNK	It doesn't work in Europe or Asia.
UNK:UNK	clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cent's up-and-coming.
UNK:UNK	I like design and look of Jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear.
UNK:UNK	I was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price.
UNK:UNK	the worst phone from samsung...crap..... this crappy Samsung E715.. is the worst i have ever seeen.
UNK:UNK	the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone.
UNK:UNK	Poor product.
UNK:UNK	However I needed some better instructions.
UNK:UNK	You need two hands to operate the screen.This software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs.
UNK:UNK	Worked very well paired with a Treo 700w and as a Skype headset on my PC (using a USB Bluetooth transceiver).
UNK:UNK	"Steer clear of this product and go with the genuine Palm replacementr pens, which come in a three-pack."
UNK:UNK	DO NOT BUY DO NOT BUYIT SUCKS
UNK:UNK	This is a great product..... sure beats using your fingers!.
UNK:UNK	"Plus, I seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point."
UNK:UNK	All the other cases I've tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul.
UNK:UNK	Very Dissapointing Performance.
UNK:UNK	Don't make the same mistake that I did and please don't buy this phone.
UNK:UNK	This phone might well be the worst I've ever had in any brand.
UNK:UNK	Case was more or less an extra that I originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear.
UNK:UNK	I recommend iGo to anyone with different brand cell phones/mp3 players in the family.
UNK:UNK	Don't bother - go to the store.
UNK:UNK	"I posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone, but i have the Fire Red and it's a great color!"
UNK:UNK	I did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed.
UNK:UNK	You get what you pay for I guess.
UNK:UNK	"Not only did the software do a great job of this, I could also make my own ringtones form my existing CDs without an internet connection."
UNK:UNK	im surprised this is a good quality car charger and there's not much reviews about it.
UNK:UNK	These are fabulous!
UNK:UNK	"However, BT headsets are currently not good for real time games like first-person shooters since the audio delay messes me up."
UNK:UNK	I used bitpim (a free program you can find on the internet)to transfer data to the phone.The price of the cable was excellent.
UNK:UNK	Disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer.
UNK:UNK	"Performed awful -- muffled, tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call."
UNK:UNK	Very wind-resistant.
UNK:UNK	"Obviously they have a terrible customer service, so you get what you pay for."
UNK:UNK	"They do not last forever, but is not overly expensive to replace.Easy to operate and the sound is much better than others I have tried."
UNK:UNK	"I contacted the company and they told me that, although the unit was still under warranty, if I couldn't produce my receipt I was out of luck."
UNK:UNK	Linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something!
UNK:UNK	Phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are.
UNK:UNK	Great phone.
UNK:UNK	"When I placed my treo into the case, not only was it NOT snug, but there was A LOT of extra room on the sides."
UNK:UNK	I'm pleased.
UNK:UNK	Battery is terrible.
UNK:UNK	I found the product to be easy to set up and use.
UNK:UNK	The earpiece on this is too large or too heavy...it keeps falling out of my ear.
UNK:UNK	Utter crap.. Sound quality is TERRIBLE.
UNK:UNK	"The charger arrived within the promised timeframe, but it did not work."
UNK:UNK	"No ear loop needed, it's tiny and the sound is great."
UNK:UNK	"Finally, after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and I could not use it any longer on the visor."
UNK:UNK	"The handsfree part works fine, but then the car tries to download the address book, and the Treo reboots.Overall, I still rate this device high."
UNK:UNK	Talk about USELESS customer service.
UNK:UNK	"It felt too light and ""tinny.""."
UNK:UNK	This does not fit the Palm Tungsten E2 and it broke the first time I tried to plug it in.
UNK:UNK	I'm happy about this purchase- good quality and low price.
UNK:UNK	I love the look and feel of Samsung flipphones.
UNK:UNK	Its well-designed and very sharp -- the blue is a very nice color.
UNK:UNK	Does everything it should and more.
UNK:UNK	I could not recommend these more.
UNK:UNK	Nice Sound.
UNK:UNK	"Looks good in the picture, but this case was a huge disappointment!!"
UNK:UNK	Much less than the jawbone I was going to replace it with.
UNK:UNK	Setup went very smoothly.
UNK:UNK	its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it.
UNK:UNK	"A must study for anyone interested in the ""worst sins"" of industrial design."
UNK:UNK	The first thing that happened was that the tracking was off.
UNK:UNK	"It is well made, easy to access the phone and has a handy, detachable belt clip."
UNK:UNK	Then I had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping.
UNK:UNK	Can't upload ringtones from a third party.
UNK:UNK	"Bluetooth does not work, phone locks up, screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked."
UNK:UNK	Truly awful.
UNK:UNK	"It works fine on my Motorola 325 cellphone, and a lot better than the worn-out battery did."
UNK:UNK	The volume for the ringer is REAL good (you have choices how loud).
UNK:UNK	And none of the tones is acceptable.
UNK:UNK	camera color balance is AWFUL.
UNK:UNK	"This product is clearly not ready for prime time, I don't care how cool it looks, if you can't tell a call is coming in it's worthless."
UNK:UNK	I love the ringtones because they are so upbeat!
UNK:UNK	Chinese Forgeries Abound!.
UNK:UNK	Easy to pair with my Samsung Cell.
UNK:UNK	The instructions didn't explain that a microphone jack could be used.
UNK:UNK	i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well.
UNK:UNK	Too bad you have to pay up to $$$ a month for the service!
UNK:UNK	Works well.
UNK:UNK	The nokia CA-42 USB cable did not work with my phone.
UNK:UNK	Clear crisp sound.
UNK:UNK	"I have to use the smallest earpieces provided, but it stays on pretty well."
UNK:UNK	"The biggest complaint I have is, the battery drains superfast."
UNK:UNK	The design might be ergonomic in theory but I could not stand having these in my ear.
UNK:UNK	Do NOT buy if you want to use the holster.
UNK:UNK	The phone can also take great pictures and even video clips.
UNK:UNK	It doesn't make you look cool.
UNK:UNK	"Because both ears are occupied, background is not distracting at all."
UNK:UNK	"Comfortable fit - you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time, if not for an entire day."
UNK:UNK	"Also, the phone doesn't seem to accept anything except CBR mp3s, preferably ripped by Windows Media Player."
UNK:UNK	You can't beat the price on these.
UNK:UNK	"* Comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots, and even flash SOS signals (seriously!"
UNK:UNK	lightweight and works well.
UNK:UNK	So just beware.
UNK:UNK	I love this cable - it allows me to connect any mini-USB device to my PC.
UNK:UNK	So anyone near you will hear part of your conversation.
UNK:UNK	This is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up.
UNK:UNK	I bought this phone as a replacement for my StarTac and have regretted it since.
UNK:UNK	Appears to actually outperform the original battery from China that came with my V325i.
UNK:UNK	Can't store anything but phone numbers to SIM.
UNK:UNK	"It lasts less than 3o minutes, if I actually try to use the phone.My wife has the same phone with the same problem."
UNK:UNK	Poor quality.
UNK:UNK	"jabra ear gels ""R"" the best!."
UNK:UNK	Not worth it.
UNK:UNK	The phone crashed completely and now I have to get it replaced.
UNK:UNK	"It quit working after I'd used it for about 18 months, so I just purchased another one because this is the best headset I've ever owned."
UNK:UNK	"Unfortunately it will not recharge my iPhone 4s, despite connecting it from multiple power sources (iMac, external battery, wall outlet, etc)."
UNK:UNK	It was a great phone.
UNK:UNK	if you simply want a small flip phone -- look elsewhere as the extra bells & whistles are mediocre.
UNK:UNK	"Good value, works fine - power via USB, car, or wall outlet."
UNK:UNK	My phone doesn't slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand.
UNK:UNK	This is simply the BEST bluetooth headset for sound quality!
UNK:UNK	Think it over when you plan to own this one!This sure is the last MOTO phone for me!
UNK:UNK	"In the span of an hour, I had two people exclaim ""Whoa - is that the new phone on TV?!?"
UNK:UNK	I have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful.
UNK:UNK	"This case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear, it is 100% functional."
UNK:UNK	"Other than that, the leather is nice and soft; the fit is very tight; the cut out for the face is a good shape."
UNK:UNK	It has everything I need and I couldn't ask for more.
UNK:UNK	After receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke.
UNK:UNK	This product is great... it makes working a lot easier I can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something.
UNK:UNK	None of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears.
UNK:UNK	T-Mobile has the best customer service anywhere.
UNK:UNK	Arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold.
UNK:UNK	We have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months.. Pros
UNK:UNK	"Provides good protection and looks classy, too."
UNK:UNK	Krussel Always good.
UNK:UNK	"The tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate, etc."
UNK:UNK	The design is very good.4.
UNK:UNK	I great reception all the time.
UNK:UNK	I would highly recommend this product.
UNK:UNK	"Couldn't use the unit with sunglasses, not good in Texas!"
UNK:UNK	It dit not work most of the time with my Nokia 5320.
UNK:UNK	"Bought mainly for the charger, which broke soon after purchasing."
UNK:UNK	"If you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations, then this phone is for you!"
UNK:UNK	Fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is
UNK:UNK	"stay away from this store, be careful."
UNK:UNK	This BlueAnt Supertooth hands-free phone speaker is AWESOME.
UNK:UNK	Does not fit.
UNK:UNK	.... Item arrived quickly and works great with my Metro PCS Samsung SCH-r450 slider phone and Sony Premium Sound in ear plugs.
UNK:UNK	"It is light, has plenty of battery capacity, and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time."
UNK:UNK	disappointing.
UNK:UNK	Blue Ant is easy to use.
UNK:UNK	Cheap but hey it works.. Was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item.
UNK:UNK	The camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors... I'd rather be using a disposable then this.
UNK:UNK	Then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use.
UNK:UNK	It's very convenient and simple to use - gets job done & makes the car ride so much smoother.
UNK:UNK	The nano stated it.My son was dissapointed.
UNK:UNK	The sound quality is excellent as well.
UNK:UNK	Its the best headset I have used.
UNK:UNK	Would not reccommend.
UNK:UNK	They have been around for years and carries the highest quality of anti-glare screen protector that I have found to date.
UNK:UNK	Just what I wanted.
UNK:UNK	This particular model would not work with my Motorola Q smartphone.
UNK:UNK	wont work right or atleast for me.
UNK:UNK	in addition it feels &amp; looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic.
UNK:UNK	"But now that it is ""out of warranty"" the same problems reoccure.Bottom line... put your money somewhere else... Cingular will not support it."
UNK:UNK	"I really wanted the Plantronics 510 to be the right one, but it has too many issues for me.The good"
UNK:UNK	Great product.
UNK:UNK	Crisp and Clear.
UNK:UNK	AFter the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes.
UNK:UNK	"VERY cheap plastic, creaks like an old wooden floor."
UNK:UNK	"I get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment, where with other phones I have not had this problem."
UNK:UNK	The reception has been generally good.
UNK:UNK	"Excellent sound, battery life and inconspicuous to boot!."
UNK:UNK	Great bluetooth!.
UNK:UNK	I highly recommend this case.
UNK:UNK	WORTHWHILE.
UNK:UNK	This is a great deal.
UNK:UNK	"After my phone got to be about a year old, it's been slowly breaking despite much care on my part."
UNK:UNK	I am sorry I made this purchase.
UNK:UNK	I bought these hoping I could make my Bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear.
UNK:UNK	Treo and T-Mobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount.
UNK:UNK	It was horrible!.
UNK:UNK	I don't think it would hold it too securly on your belt.
UNK:UNK	This allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first.
UNK:UNK	They work about 2 weeks then break.
UNK:UNK	It is simple to use and I like it.
UNK:UNK	"It's a great tool for entertainment, communication, and data management.Oh, be sure to use ActiveSync 4.2 for optimal data synchronization results!"
UNK:UNK	I can't use this case because the smell is disgusting.
UNK:UNK	NOT WHAT I WANTED.
UNK:UNK	I own 2 of these cases and would order another.
UNK:UNK	Great Phone.
UNK:UNK	I bought this battery with a coupon from Amazon and I'm very happy with my purchase.
UNK:UNK	"The internet access was fine, it the rare instance that it worked."
UNK:UNK	Perfect for the PS3.
UNK:UNK	"Five star Plus, plus."
UNK:UNK	A good quality bargain.. I bought this after I bought a cheapy from Big Lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldn't hear me.
UNK:UNK	$50 Down the drain.
UNK:UNK	I tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and I was still told it wasn't great.
UNK:UNK	"Good , works fine."
UNK:UNK	For the price this was a great deal.
UNK:UNK	"Great price, too!"
UNK:UNK	"If there is a wind, it is completely useless."
UNK:UNK	Yes it's shiny on front side - and I love it!
UNK:UNK	Does Not Work.
UNK:UNK	"At first I thought I was grtting a good deal at $7.44, until I plugged it into my phone (V3c Razr)."
UNK:UNK	The reception through this headset is excellent.
UNK:UNK	2 thumbs up to this seller
UNK:UNK	"I have a Verizon LG phone and they work well together, good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight."
UNK:UNK	Improper description.... I had to return it.
UNK:UNK	#1 It Works - #2 It is Comfortable.
UNK:UNK	Battery charge-life is quite long.
UNK:UNK	The Jabra EarGels fit my ears very well.
UNK:UNK	Battery has no life.
UNK:UNK	I checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing.
UNK:UNK	Product is exactly as described.
UNK:UNK	Gets a signal when other Verizon phones won't.
UNK:UNK	Doesn't do the job.
UNK:UNK	I would recommend it.
UNK:UNK	Plan on ordering from them again and again.
UNK:UNK	"That being said, for a phone, the camera is very nice; many cool effects to play with, and video is decent as well."
UNK:UNK	I have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one.
UNK:UNK	They keep getting better and better (this is my third one and I've had numerous Palms too).
UNK:UNK	Awkward to use and unreliable.
UNK:UNK	The shipping time was also very quick!
UNK:UNK	Not as good as I had hoped.
UNK:UNK	Good case!.
UNK:UNK	Doesn't Work.
UNK:UNK	Really good product.
UNK:UNK	Unfortunately it did not work.
UNK:UNK	All three broke within two months of use.
UNK:UNK	dont buy it.
UNK:UNK	"My father has the V265, and the battery is dying."
UNK:UNK	"However, the ear pads come off easily and after only one week I lost one."
UNK:UNK	"The calls drop, the phone comes on and off at will, the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently."
UNK:UNK	"Horrible, horrible protector."
UNK:UNK	I don't like this Nokia either.
UNK:UNK	"Reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable, and the send and end keys are not where I expect them to be.3."
UNK:UNK	I have bought this Nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare.
UNK:UNK	It would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with Amazon.
UNK:UNK	the only VERY DISAPPOINTING thing was there was NO SPEAKERPHONE!!!!
UNK:UNK	Terrible.. My car will not accept this cassette.
UNK:UNK	"Product is useless, since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones I was planning to use it with."
UNK:UNK	It's not what it says it is.
UNK:UNK	Stay Away From the Q!.
UNK:UNK	Used and dirty.
UNK:UNK	Very unreliable service from T-mobile !
UNK:UNK	Not good enough for the price.
UNK:UNK	I bought two of them and neither will charge.
UNK:UNK	It looks very nice.
UNK:UNK	"This is an excellent tool, especially when paired with your phone's auto-answer."
UNK:UNK	I have read other's reviews here but I haven't had any problem with it.
UNK:UNK	These products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet.
UNK:UNK	Comfortable in my hand.
UNK:UNK	Just does not work.
UNK:UNK	Poor Reliability.
UNK:UNK	(It works!)
UNK:UNK	"If I take a picture, the battery drops a bar, and starts beeping, letting me know its dieing."
UNK:UNK	"Terrible product, and waste of money!"
UNK:UNK	Last time buying from you.
UNK:UNK	It was a waste of my money.
UNK:UNK	So far it has worked like a charm.
UNK:UNK	"I have only had it for a few weeks, but so far, so good."
UNK:UNK	"But, in any case, the best part is, you can download these pictures to your laptop using IR, or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone."
UNK:UNK	Would recommend this item.
UNK:UNK	It's been my choice headset for years.Great sound; good volume; good noise cancellation.
UNK:UNK	"Nice case, feels good in your hands."
UNK:UNK	The item received was Counterfeit.
UNK:UNK	"Just really good.. So far, probably the best BT headset I have ever had."
UNK:UNK	Works fine.
UNK:UNK	I received my headset in good time and was happy with it.
UNK:UNK	I was very pleased to see that I could replace my well travled swivel holster for my Blackberry flip.
UNK:UNK	My sister has one also and she loves it.
UNK:UNK	Good Quality.
UNK:UNK	This is by far the worst purchase I've made on Amazon.
UNK:UNK	Excellent dual-purpose headset.
UNK:UNK	Excellent!.
UNK:UNK	Does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125.
UNK:UNK	"It seems completely secure, both holding on to my belt, and keeping the iPhone inside."
UNK:UNK	"The bottowm line...another worthless, cheap gimmick from Sprint."
UNK:UNK	Having trouble with volume.
UNK:UNK	The only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears.
UNK:UNK	WARNING - DO NOT BUY!!.
UNK:UNK	"I am pairing this with my iphone, and I could not be happier with it so far."
UNK:UNK	"When it opens, the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off."
UNK:UNK	"I didn't want the clip going over the top of my ear, causing discomfort."
UNK:UNK	Best headset ever!!!.
UNK:UNK	Don't trust their website and don't expect any helpful support.
UNK:UNK	It was that loud.Glad to say that the Plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use.
UNK:UNK	The speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap.
UNK:UNK	"Fits comfortably, came with three sizes of earbud tips."
UNK:UNK	Excellent product for the price.
UNK:UNK	Bad Reception.
UNK:UNK	This product is very High quality Chinese CRAP!!!!!!
UNK:UNK	It was quite comfortable in the ear.
UNK:UNK	Great phone.
UNK:UNK	Don't buy this product - It fails!.
UNK:UNK	Everything about this product is wrong.First
UNK:UNK	The pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before I started making calls with the voice dialing feature.
UNK:UNK	"This was utterly confusing at first, which caused me to lose a couple of very, very important contacts."
UNK:UNK	Terrible phone holder.
UNK:UNK	The cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly.
UNK:UNK	I love being able to use one headset for both by land-line and cell.
UNK:UNK	Problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily.
UNK:UNK	Not nearly as good looking as the AMAZON picture makes it look.
UNK:UNK	"But despite these few flaws, this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official OEM product."
UNK:UNK	How stupid is that?
UNK:UNK	"I can hear while I'm driving in the car, and usually don't even have to put it on it's loudest setting."
UNK:UNK	Seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors.
UNK:UNK	"Good show, Samsung."
UNK:UNK	So I bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money.
UNK:UNK	It always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed.
UNK:UNK	Couldn't figure it out
UNK:UNK	"My phone sounded OK ( not great - OK), but my wife's phone was almost totally unintelligible, she couldn't understand a word being said on it."
UNK:UNK	So I had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it.
UNK:UNK	"While I managed to bend the leaf spring back in place, the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop."
UNK:UNK	Leopard Print is wonderfully wild!.
UNK:UNK	Works for me.
UNK:UNK	"Saggy, floppy piece of junk."
UNK:UNK	much better than the hard plastic cases.
UNK:UNK	It also had a new problem.
UNK:UNK	Happy so far!.
UNK:UNK	cool phone.
UNK:UNK	Works good.
UNK:UNK	Motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right.
UNK:UNK	It looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two.
UNK:UNK	"but it is great, i would really recommend it"
UNK:UNK	Makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when I'm not wearing it.
UNK:UNK	As I said above....PRETTY USELESS!
UNK:UNK	Never got it!!!!!
UNK:UNK	This pair of headphones is the worst that I have ever had sound-wise.
UNK:UNK	[...] down the drain because of a weak snap!
UNK:UNK	Does not charge the Cingular (ATT) 8525 phone.
UNK:UNK	"You get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off."""
UNK:UNK	"However, after about a year, the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and I couldn't receive and place calls."
UNK:UNK	I kept catching the cable on the seat and I had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off.
UNK:UNK	The headset fulfills my requirements so I am happy with my purchase.
UNK:UNK	Logitech Bluetooth Headset is a 10!.
UNK:UNK	"I like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear, rather than inside."
UNK:UNK	A lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do I.
UNK:UNK	I have tried these cables with my computer and my iPod and it works just fine.
UNK:UNK	"The mic there is a joke, and the volume is quite low."
UNK:UNK	I'm returning them.
UNK:UNK	I does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap.
UNK:UNK	It is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable.
UNK:UNK	I have had mine for about a year and this Christmas I bought some for the rest of the family.
UNK:UNK	"Otherwise, easy to install and use, clear sound."
UNK:UNK	nice leather.
UNK:UNK	I had to purchase a different case.
UNK:UNK	It is a joy to use.
UNK:UNK	Very much disappointed with this company.
UNK:UNK	Very satisifed with that.
UNK:UNK	It didn't charge for me.
UNK:UNK	This is the phone to get for 2005.... I just bought my S710a and all I can say is WOW!
UNK:UNK	Buttons are too small.
UNK:UNK	Just reading on the specs alone makes you say WOW.
UNK:UNK	Love it.. Great armband.
UNK:UNK	I really like this product over the Motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic.
UNK:UNK	"However, the keypads are so tinny that I sometimes reach the wrong buttons."
UNK:UNK	I exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and I'm pretty happy with that decision.
UNK:UNK	I was very impressed with the price of the cases.
UNK:UNK	Also makes it easier to hold on to.
UNK:UNK	"I use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment, and it works great!"
UNK:UNK	It's pretty easy.
UNK:UNK	I cannot make calls at certain places.
UNK:UNK	"however, my girl was complain that some time the phone doesn't wake up like normal phone does."
UNK:UNK	Beautiful styling though.
UNK:UNK	This company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back.
UNK:UNK	I'm trying to return it for a refund.
UNK:UNK	I plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked.
UNK:UNK	Excellent product.
UNK:UNK	Earbud piece breaks easily.
UNK:UNK	Lousy product.
UNK:UNK	This phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at it's very ability to be a phone.
UNK:UNK	It is the best charger I have seen on the market yet.
UNK:UNK	SWEETEST PHONE!!!
UNK:UNK	":-)Oh, the charger seems to work fine."
UNK:UNK	It fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal.
UNK:UNK	Not enough volume.
UNK:UNK	Echo Problem....Very unsatisfactory
UNK:UNK	you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor.
UNK:UNK	don't waste your money.
UNK:UNK	I am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product.
UNK:UNK	Adapter does not provide enough charging current.
UNK:UNK	"There was so much hype over this phone that I assumed it was the best, my mistake."
UNK:UNK	You also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered.
UNK:UNK	Phone falls out easily.
UNK:UNK	"It didn't work, people can not hear me when I talk."
UNK:UNK	The text messaging feature is really tricky to use.
UNK:UNK	I'm really disappointed all I have now is a charger that doesn't work.
UNK:UNK	Painful on the ear.
UNK:UNK	Lasted one day and then blew up.
UNK:UNK	disappointed.
UNK:UNK	Kind of flops around.
UNK:UNK	The screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face.
UNK:UNK	What a piece of junk.. I lose more calls on this phone.
UNK:UNK	Item Does Not Match Picture.
UNK:UNK	The only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port (irda).
UNK:UNK	"You can not answer calls with the unit, never worked once!"
